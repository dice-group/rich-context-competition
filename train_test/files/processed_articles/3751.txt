More\nrecently, extensive neuronal pathology has lead to its clas-\nsification as a neurodegenerative disease as well. While the\nimmune system initiates the autoimmune response it re-\nmains unclear how it orchestrates neuronal damage. In our\nprevious studies, using in vitro cultured embryonic neurons,\nwe demonstrated that MBP (myelin basic protein)-specific\nencephalitogenic CD4 T-cells induce early neuronal damage.\nIn an extension of those studies, here we show that po-\nlarized CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells as wells as CD8 T-cells and\nNK (natural killer) cells induce microtubule destabilization\nwithin neurites in a contact-independent manner. Owing to\nthe cytotoxic potential of these immune cells, we isolated\nthe luminal components of lytic granules and determined\nthat they were sufficient to drive microtubule destabilization.\nSince lytic granules contain cytolytic proteins, we determined\nthat the induction of microtubule destabilization occurred\nprior to signs of apoptosis. Furthermore, we determined that\nmicrotubule destabilization was largely restricted to axons,\nsparing dendrites. This study demonstrated that lymphocytes\nwith cytolytic activity have the capacity to directly drive MAD\n(microtubule axonal destabilization) in a bystander manner\nthat is independent of neuronal death.\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1These authors equally contributed to this work.\n2To whom correspondence should be addressed (email: bonnie.dittel@bcw.edu).\nAbbreviations: APC, antigen presenting cells; BBB, blood\u00adbrain barrier; CA, conalbumin; CNS, central nervous system; DAPI, 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EAE,\nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; FBS, foetal bovine serum; IFN, interferon ; IL, interleukin; MAD, microtubule axonal destabilization; MAP2, microtubule\nassociated protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; MS, multiple sclerosis; NK, natural killer; OVA, ovalbumin; PFA, paraformaldehyde; TCR, T-cell\nreceptor; TGF, transforming growth factor ; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\n",

Although MS is considered a demyelinating disease,\nit is now well recognized that neuronal damage and loss\nis a major component of the disease (Nylander and Hafler,\nand/or Th17 phenotype with specificity to myelin antigens\ndrive lesion formation in the CNS (central nervous system),\nresulting in immune cell infiltration, demyelination and neu-\nronal damage/loss leading to a variety of neurological deficits\nIn newly diagnosed MS patients, brain biopsies exhib-\nited evidence of axonal injury in demyelinated plaques and\nnormal appearing white matter, suggesting that neurode-\ngeneration occurs simultaneously with the establishment of\nlesions by immune cells (Bjartmar et al., 2003; Ferguson et al.,\nN. M. Miller and others\naccumulating neuronal damage/loss is thought to be the ma-\njor contributor to the decline in health status of the patients\n2009). While the correlation between the presence of immune\ncell infiltrates in the CNS and neuronal damage is strong, the\nexact mechanisms whereby the immune system induces such\ndamage are unknown. Potential immune-mediated mecha-\nnisms include direct cytotoxicity or indirect mechanisms such\nas glutamate excitotoxicity, vulnerability due to demyelina-\nRelapsing and remitting MS is not consistent with wide-\nspread neuronal loss, but rather reversible neuronal damage.\nTo this end, using the animal model of MS, EAE (experimen-\ntal autoimmune encephalomyelitis), we previously demon-\nstrated that neuronal damage evident in areas of immune cell\ninfiltration was reversed when the mice underwent sponta-\nneous recovery (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Interestingly, this\nneuronal damage occurred prior to overt demyelination. Fur-\nther support of this concept is evidence of immune-mediated\nneuronal damage in the absence of co-localized demyelinat-\ning processes in MS (Aboul-Enein et al., 2006; Bitsch et al.,\ncytes have recently been shown to provide metabolic support\nloss is not the sole predictor of vulnerability to neuronal\ninjury in MS.\nPreviously, we reported that encephalitogenic CD4 T-cells\ninduced neuronal damage (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Here,\nwe extended these findings and demonstrate that CD4 Th1,\nCD4 Th17, CD8 as well as NK (natural killer) cells induce neu-\nronal damage via the induction of MAD (microtubule axonal\ndestabilization). Furthermore, we provide evidence that neu-\nronal damage is mediated by a protein expressed within the\nluminal contents of lytic granules expressed by immune cells\nwith cytolytic activity. We also found that MAD occurred\nrapidly after exposure to lytic granules and prior to signs of\nneuronal cell death. In addition, the restriction of MAD to\nthe axon indicates that immune cells have the potential\nto contribute to axonopathies in diseases with a strong im-\nmune cell component such as autoimmunity and infectious\ndisease.\nRodents\nGzmatm1Ley/Gzmbtm2.1Ley/J (granzyme A/B- / - ) mice\nwere purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

We next asked whether cell\u00adcell contact\nwas required and found that it was not since the continu-\nous YFP fluorescence in unmanipulated embryonic neurons\n(Figure 1A) was disrupted by both supernatants from en-\ncephalitogenic T-cell cultures (Figure 1B) and their presence\nin the top of chamber of a transwell (Figure 1C).\nMicrotubule destabilization is mediated by CD4\nSince EAE is induced by CD4 T-cells of the Th1 and Th17 sub-\ntypes (El-behi et al., 2010), we next asked whether one or both\nwould drive microtubule destabilization. In our previous stud-\nies, we determined that alterations in YFP fluorescence was\nassociated with destabilization of the microtubule network\nas visualized by staining with anti-3\n-tubulin (Shriver and\nDittel, 2006). Because the detection of microtubule desta-\nbilization by immunofluorescence proved more robust than\nalterations in YFP fluorescence, all subsequent studies were\nperformed using the former method. When we stained unma-\nnipulated neuronal cultures with anti-3\n-tubulin, we found\nthat the microtubule network was uniformly expressed in all\nneuritis, which we used as a general indicator of the health\nof the cultures (Figure 2A). Owing to differences in granu-\nlar composition and secretion profiles of lymphocyte subsets,\nwe choose to use cellular lysates instead of supernatants to\nnormalize the potential of each cell type to drive micro-\ntubule destabilization. Using MBP\u00adTCR transgenic mice, we\ngenerated Th1 (Figure 3A) and Th17 (Figure 3B) cell lines and\nconfirmed their differentiated phenotype by intracellular cy-\ntokine staining. We found that both Th1 (Figure 3B) and Th17\n(Figure 3C) CD4 T-cells drove microtubule destabilization re-\nsulting in a 3-tubulin punctate `beads-on-a-string' staining\npattern in a subset of neuritis.

Scale bar: 30 m.\ntheir inability to induce EAE, CD4 Th2 cells would not drive\nmicrotubule destabilization (Khoruts et al., 1995). Using the\nure 2C), we confirmed that it lacked the ability to drive micro-\ntubule destabilization (Figure 3D). We then examined other\nimmune cell types and found that CD8 (Figure 3E) and NK\ncells (Figure 3F), but not splenocytes, B cells, macrophages nor\nmicroglial cells, were able to induce neuronal damage (results\nnot shown). The use of cell lysates in this study also demon-\nstrated that intracellular proteins such as calpains, lysosomal\nenzymes and cell-signalling molecules that are common to\nall T-cells do not play a role in microtubule destabilization.\nMicrotubule destabilization is driven by a\ncomponent of lytic granules\nOne common feature of CD4 Th1, CD8 and NK cells is their\ncytotoxic potential via the secretion of lytic granules follow-\ning activation. To determine whether the ability to induce\nmicrotubule destabilization was due to a component of lytic\ngranules, we used several approaches. First, we treated en-\ncephaltiogenic CD4 T-cells with nocodazole to disrupt the\npolymerization of microtubules required for the release of\nlytic granules and found that the treated supernatants failed\nto mediate neuronal damage (results not shown). Secondly,\nwe generated NK cell cultures from Beige mice, which har-\nbour a frame-shift mutation in the Lyst gene leading to\ndefects in vesicle trafficking resulting in defective cytolytic\net al., 1979). When we compared the staining pattern of\n-tubulin in control neurons (Figure 4A), we found that\nsupernatants from Beige NK cells (Figure 4B) did not alter\nmicrotubule stability. In contrast, cellular lysates from the\nsame NK cells did exhibit the activity (Figure 4C). We then\nisolated the luminal contents of lytic granules from CD4 Th1\nCD8 T-cells (results not shown) and found that they drove\nmicrotubule destabilization. These data demonstrate that T-\ncells with cytotoxic potential and NK cells are similar in their\nability to drive microtubule destabilization. In addition, the\ncomponent of lytic granules that drives microtubule desta-\nbilization is probably a protein because the methods used\nto isolate the luminal components of lytic granules enriches\nfor proteins and eliminates small molecules such a peptides,\nnucleotides or amino acids.\nThe ability to mediate microtubule\ndestabilization is conserved among species\nTo determine the applicability of our current findings to hu-\nmans, we asked whether human NK cells were able to induce\nmicrotubule destabilization. Using mouse neuronal cultures\n(Figure 5A), we found that cell lysates generated from human\nperipheral blood NK cells were able to induce microtubule\ndestabilization (Figure 5B). Likewise, lytic granules from the\nhuman YT `NK-like' cell line (Figure 5C) were also able to\ninduce microtubule destabilization. In addition, splenic rat\nNK cell lytic granules exhibited similar activity (results not\nshown). Furthermore, we found that human embryonic neu-\nrons (Figure 5D) were susceptible to neuronal damage when\ntreated with mouse NK cell lytic granules (Figure 5E).

Neurons were then\nfixed and stained for 3\n-tubulin and imaged by confocal microscopy. Arrows indicate neurites exhibiting microtubule destabilization.\nMicrotubule destabilization is independent of\nneuronal apoptosis\nPreviously, it has been shown that cytotoxic lymphocytes as\nwell as NK cells can induce death of neurons (Backstrom et al.,\nstudy, we demonstrated that membrane integrity remained\nintact in neurons co-cultured with CD4+ encephalitogenic\nT-cells, indicating that the viability of the neurons was not\ncompromised (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Because the treated\nneurons could have been undergoing stages of apoptosis\nprior to loss of membrane integrity, we next examined that\npossibility using TUNEL to measure DNA fragmentation, a\nhallmark of apoptosis. We found that about 25% of mouse\nembryonic neurons in the medium alone were undergoing\napoptosis as determined by computing the percent TUNEL +\ncells among the DAPI+ nuclei (Figures 6A and 6G). DNase\nI treatment was used as a positive control for DNA frag-\nmentation and was about 100% (Figures 6B and 6G). The\naddition of lytic granules from YT cells had no effect on\nbasal levels of apoptosis (Figures 6C and 6G). To confirm that\nmicrotubule destabilization is independent of apoptosis, we\nstained for both TUNEL and 3\n-tubulin. Control neurons ex-\nhibited a continuous 3\n-tubulin staining pattern and did not\nexhibit signs of apoptosis (Figure 6D). DNase I treated neurons\nwere positive for TUNEL staining, but did not exhibit micro-\ntubule destabilization (Figure 6E). In contrast, treatment with\nYT lytic granules resulted in microtubule destabilization but\nnot apoptosis (TUNEL-) (Figure 6F).\nThe lack of apoptosis induction in our model of neuronal\ndamage is important since the lytic granule components per-\nforin and granzyme A/B have been implicated in neuronal\nconfirm that these cell death-inducing proteins are not me-\ndiating microtubule destabilization, we compared 3\n-tubulin\nstaining in control neurons (Figure 7A) with neurons exposed\nto NK cell lysates from granzyme A/B double (Figure 7B)\nor perforin (Figure 7C) knockout mice and found that both\nknockouts retained activity. These data indicate that the early\nmicrotubule destabilization that we observe is mediated by a\nmechanism independent of neuronal death.\nAxons, but not dendrites, are susceptible to MAD\nAs evident in Figures 3\u00ad6, microtubule destabilization only\noccurs in a subset of neurites, suggesting that dendrites and\naxons are differentially affected. To investigate this question,\nwe stained neurons that had been exposed to lytic granules\nwith anti-3\n-tubulin (green) to stain microtubules in both\naxons and dendrites in combination with anti-MAP2 (blue)\nto mark dendrites and anti-ankyrin G (red) to mark axons\n1987). We found that microtubule destabilization was largely\nlocalized to axons (asterisk). The ankyrin G+ axon also still\nexpressed MAP2 within the axonal initial segment, which is\nconsistent with early stages of axonogenesis (Boiko et al.,\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 19\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nN.

We propose that\nmyelin-specific CD4 T-cells enter the CNS, and at or near\nthe BBB (blood\u00adbrain barrier) become activated via interac-\ntion with APC via MHC II: self-peptide, resulting in their cell\nproliferation, cytokine production and the release of lytic\ngranular contents. The inflammation driven by the CD4 T-\ncells would lead to a breakdown of the BBB allowing other\nimmune cells including CD8 T and NK cells to enter the CNS.\nCD8 T-cells interacting with either APC, oligodendrocytes or\nneurons via MHC I: self-peptide interactions would become\nactivated and release lytic granular contents. NK cells, which\ndo not require a specific antigen have the potential to inter-\nact with any cell type within the CNS and would also release\nlytic granular contents upon activation. Most likely via a by-\nstander mechanism, some soluble protein component of the\nlytic granules would induce a signalling cascade in neurons,\nultimately resulting in the destabilization of microtubules in\naxons.\nDISCUSSION\nNeuronal damage is a prominent feature in MS and has been\nwell documented in EAE (Kornek et al., 2000; Nylander and\nHafler, 2012). In this study, we first investigated the immune\ncell types that could contribute to neuronal damage and\nfound that both CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells (Figure 3), thought\nto be the drivers of MS and EAE, induced MAD. Furthermore,\nwe found that CD8 and NK cells also induced microtubule\ndestabilization. Using a variety of strategies, we next found\nthat MAD activity resided within the lumen of lytic granules\nand did not require direct cell contact between the immune\ncells and neurons. Although lytic granules contain cytolytic\nproteins, we found that microtubule destabilization occurred\nearly in the absence of evidence of cell death. Finally, since\naxonal injury is thought to play a key role in the progression\nof MS, we determined that microtubule destabilization was\nrestricted to axons, largely sparing the dendrites. Together,\nthese data provide strong evidence that the immune system\nhas the potential to directly cause neuronal damage result-\ning in axonopathy in both autoimmunity and in infectious\ndisease.\nUsing the EAE model, it is well established that both CD4\nTh1 and Th17 cells contribute to disease. Although the exact\nmechanisms whereby CD4 T-cells drive CNS autoimmunity\nare not well understood, both cell types produce GM-CSF\n(granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a key\ncytokine required for the initiation of disease (El-Behi et al.\nboth also produce chemokines, which draw other inflam-\nmatory cells into the CNS. In addition, IL-17 is a potent\ninducer of chemokine production and has been shown to\ninduce chemokine production by astrocytes (Awane et al.,\nprovide evidence that both CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells also di-\nrectly drive neuronal damage (Figure 3).

However, this study did not determine the na-\nture of the T-cell:neuronal interactions and thus it is not\nknown if direct cell\u00adcell contact was required.

Of interest to our observations is a recent study,\nwhich demonstrated that collateral neuronal apoptosis fol-\nlowing the antigen-specific attack by OT-1 CD8 T-cells of\nOVA expressing oligodendrocytes in coronal brain slices was\nprobably due to spillover of perforin and granzymes from\nthe T-cell itself (Gobel et al., 2010). These data provide addi-\ntional evidence that T-cell:neuronal contacts are not required\nfor the induction of neuronal damage by proteins contained\nwithin the lytic granule.\nNK cells also kill via lytic granules and have been shown\nto be present in MS lesions (Kaur et al., 2012). While their\npresence within the CNS may suggest a pathogenic role, in\nEAE most studies point towards a protective role for NK\ncells (Kaur et al., 2012). The antibody-mediated depletion\nof NK cells prior to the induction of EAE led to increased\nZhang et al., 1997), whereas NK cell activation had the op-\nposite effect of greatly reducing disease (Jahng et al., 2001;\nSingh et al., 2001). Potential protective mechanisms include\ndirect lysis of pathogenic CD4 T-cells or antigen present-\ning dendritic cells and neuroprotection by the production\nof neurotrophic factors (Al-Falahi et al., 2009; Hammarberg\n1997). Consistent with a protective role, the trend is for\nFigure 9 Model of MAD\nMyelin-specific Th1 and/or Th17 cells drive inflammation within the CNS that results in the breakdown of the BBB and the release of\ntheir lytic granular contents. In addition, CD8 T and NK cells enter the CNS and if they become activated also release the contents of their\nlytic granules. The destabilization of microtubules within axons occurs via a bystander mechanism as a consequence of the presence of\nlytic granular contents within the CNS microenvironment.\n22 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCytolytic lymphocytes induce axonal damage\nreduced numbers and function of NK cells in the peripheral\nblood of patients with active MS disease (Kaur et al., 2012).\nIn contrast, a recent study using a similar NK cell antibody\ndepletion strategy resulted in less severe EAE that was ac-\ncompanied by a reduction in IFN and TNF- production\nby draining lymph node cells following antigen-specific ac-\ntivation (Winkler-Pickett et al., 2008), suggesting a role for\nNK cells in tuning the extent of adaptive immune responses.\nNK cells migrate into the CNS via CX3CR1 and when defi-\ncient mice exhibited more severe EAE, indicating that the\nsite of NK cell regulation is within the CNS (Huang et al.,\n2006). However, once in the CNS, NK cells could contribute\nto pathology by directly lysing CNS resident cells including\noligodendrocytes and neurons (Backstrom et al., 2003; Saikali\net al., 2007), or as our data suggest, induce MAD via a by-\nstander mechanism.\nThe majority of MS patients exhibit a relapsing and re-\nmitting form of disease (Compston and Coles, 2008), which\nis consistent with reversible neuronal damage. To model re-\nversible neuronal damage, we used an acute model of EAE\nand previously demonstrated that accumulating neuronal in-\njury paralleled the clinical signs of EAE and was reversed\nwhen the animals underwent spontaneous recovery (Shriver\nand Dittel, 2006). Here, we extend these observations and\nprovide evidence that the damage is probably due to a loss\nin the integrity of the microtubule structure in axons, the\nconsequence of which would be a defect in axonal trans-\nport. Interestingly, transport defects are a common feature\nof many neurodegenerative diseases, including MS (Morfini\nfect both neuronal function and survival. Neuronal transmis-\nsion is dependent upon the anterograde delivery of synaptic\nvesicles containing neurotransmitters and proteins synthe-\nsized in the cell body to the axon terminal. Similarly, neuronal\nsurvival is dependent upon the retrograde transport of neu-\nrotrophic growth factors towards the cell body (Guzik and\nGoldstein, 2004). Intracellular trafficking largely occurs upon\nmicrotubules composed of - and -tubulin subunits (Conde\nand Caceres, 2009) on which the motor proteins dynein and\nkinesin carry cargo consisting of vesicles and intracellular\norganelles, including mitochondria that generate the ATP\nrequired to drive the motors (Hirokawa et al., 2010). Micro-\ntubule stability is maintained by the binding of MAP, the\nbest studied of which is tau (Johnson and Stoothoff, 2004).\nTau is a substrate for numerous protein kinases and its hy-\nperphosphorylation negatively regulates the stabilization of\nneuronal microtubules (Johnson and Stoothoff, 2004). Desta-\nbilization of microtubule integrity has been associated with\ntransport defects resulting in the accumulation of cytosolic\nproteins in discrete domains along the neuronal processes,\ntermed `beads-on-a-string' (Coleman et al., 2005; Trushina\net al., 2004). While highly studied in AD (Alzheimer's disease),\nhyperphosphorylation of tau has been reported in primary\nder et al., 2004). In addition, changes in mitochondrial func-\ntion altering neuronal metabolism, consistent with a trans-\nport defect, is becoming increasingly reported in MS (Camp-\nWhile a sustained transport defect puts the neuron at risk\nof death, our data demonstrate that MAD is an early event\nthat occurs prior to signs of neuronal cell death. What is not\nclear is the contribution MAD makes to the ultimate death of\nin vitro cultured neurons exposed to granzyme and perforin\nthat are present in the cell supernatants, cell lysates and\nlytic granular protein preparations. The sensitivity of neu-\nrons in situ to granzyme and perforin-induced cell death is\nnot clear, but such bystander cell death would be occurring\nin the presence of MAD as well. Thus, our observations are\nof clinical importance and indicate that if neuronal damage\ncould be reversed prior to the induction of irreversible cell\ndeath widespread neurodegeneration could be circumvented\nand may extend the time for patients to enter the progressive\nphase of MS.\nOur data indicate that cell\u00adcell contact is not required for\nlymphocytes to induce MAD and thus this pathology is prob-\nably due to bystander collateral damage due to the release of\ngranules following their activation within the CNS. It is un-\nclear why lymphocytes evolved the ability to disrupt axonal\ntransport, but we speculate that it is to prevent access of\npathogenic agents to the CNS. Viruses, toxins and even pri-\nons gain access to the CNS from the periphery via retrograde\naxonal transport. Given that cognate antigen is not required\nin our model of neuronal damage, bystander effects on neu-\nronal function probably follow the activation of CD4, CD8 or\nNK cells in the tissues at the site of infection. For instance,\nimmune cells responding to a dirty stab wound that are reac-\ntivated at the site of inflammation causing the release of lytic\ngranules could induce microtubule destabilization causing a\ntransport defect thereby preventing the spread of tetanus\ntoxin into the CNS from the peripheral site. Thus, we propose\nthat a least some axonal damage associated with MS is po-\ntentially a consequence of immune protective mechanisms\nthat are inadvertently triggered during a CNS autoimmune\nresponse.\n"
