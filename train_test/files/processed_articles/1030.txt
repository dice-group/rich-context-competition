This study used a person\u00adenvironment (P\u00adE) framework to examine individual capabilities and social and\nphysical environmental attributes for their association with unmet assistance needs in activities of daily living (ADLs).\nAnalyses were replicated among five ADLs (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating) and test the relative risk of\napartment dwellers compared to those living in houses.\nMethods. Data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey, Supplement on Disability Followback\nSurvey. Analyses consisted of a nationally representative sample of aged and nonaged adults with one or more ADL\nlimitations.\nResults. Slightly less than 1 in 5 subjects with a specific ADL limitation had unmet needs for that ADL. This was true\nacross all ADLs. The likelihood of unmet ADL assistance increased with the number of ADL limitations and other health\nstatus indicators. It was at least 50% higher among those living in apartments than in houses and higher among Hispanics.\nThere were no differences by age or gender.\nDiscussion. The P\u00adE framework postulates that individuals seek settings matched to their capabilities, but findings\nsuggest that many are at risk for adaptation at any one time. Specific risk factors are identified. Selection factors like\npreferences, expectations, and adaptation options available have not been directly measured.\nMORE than 5.4 million American adults living in\ncommunity settings need assistance from another person\nor special equipment to accomplish basic activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) like bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and\neating (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 1998).\nGrowth in home- and community-based care during the 1990s\n(e.g., Spillman, Liu, & McGillard, 2002) has afforded the\nopportunity for many individuals to live in the community who\nmight otherwise be in nursing homes or housing with services.\nPublic concerns about the adequacy of assistance in community\nsettings have paralleled this growth (e.g., U.S. General\nOne definition of adequacy is the extent to which needed\nassistance is unavailable or insufficient. The prevalence of at\nleast some unmet ADL assistance needs has been estimated.\nThese rates range from 2.6% to 34.6% (see Desai, Lentzner, &\ntensive review) among the aged. Much of this range results from\nwhether incontinence is included in the definition of toileting\ndifficulty. In all studies, rates of unmet need increased as the\nnumber of ADL limitations increased and if instrumental activ-\nities of daily living (IADLs; e.g., getting about inside, getting\noutside, getting places, shopping, preparing meals, doing light\nand heavy housework, using the telephone) defined tasks for\nwhich more assistance was needed.\nThese prevalence studies have found that living alone, the\nnumber or type of chronic health conditions, race and ethnicity\n(i.e., Black or Hispanic), marital status (i.e., divorced or never\nmarried), and limited insurance coverage were also associated\nwith an increased likelihood of unmet need. Living with a\nspouse and use of equipment and assistive devices (e.g., canes,\nwalkers, bathroom and/or kitchen modifications) were associ-\nated with reduced unmet need.\nThis article extends the examination of unmet needs in two\nways. First, we use a person\u00adenvironment (P\u00adE) framework and\nbroaden the factors considered, assessing the extent to which\nphysical and social environmental factors are associated with the\nlikelihood of unmet task assistance. This perspective recognizes\nthat disability involves the match or fit between individual capa-\nbilities and the demands and supports available from the envi-\nronment and that environment includes a host of physical and\nsocial dimensions. Second, we assess whether the risk for unmet\nneed varies among housing types and among specific ADL limi-\ntations. The population studied had at least one ADL limitation.\nP\u00adE frameworks trace back to such individuals as Helson\n(1984), among a number of others. The P\u00adE framework guiding\nour work is that of Lawton and Nahemow. They postulate that\nindividuals seek congruence between their capability and the\ndemands made by their setting and that a match or congruence\nbetween capability and environmental demands (or supports)\nhelps produce outcomes for the individual, such as life satis-\nfaction and optimum performance, within that setting. Capability\nin this framework includes physical and cognitive functioning,\neconomic resources, intellectual resources, and social skills.\nEnvironmental factors include physical features, services, and\nsocial components like roles, cultural norms, and social relation-\nships. Mismatches, where demands exceed capability, are\nthought to produce stress and inadequate performance. Demands\nbelow capability are thought to produce understimulation and\neven an erosion of ability. As capability declines (e.g., due to\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nchanges in health status or cognitive functioning), other things\nbeing equal, an individual's adaptive range is thought to decline,\nwith the individual becoming more sensitive to or affected by the\ndemands from his or her environment. This is known as the\nenvironmental docility hypothesis (Lawton, 1969). We are con-\ncerned with identifying the extent of any mismatches, here re-\nflected as unmet need for ADL task assistance.\nThe Lawton\u00adNahemow framework and variations on it have\nbeen used in many studies, predominantly of elders. Among\nother things, these studies adjusted for individual capabilities\nand examined the appropriateness and availability of such envi-\nronmental attributes as social supports and service assistance\nfor their effect on individual outcomes like life satisfaction\n(Kahana, et al., 1995), social activity, and relocation (e.g.,\nSpeare, Avery, Lawton, 1991). The Lawton\u00adNahemow frame-\nwork has also been used to examine moves among the nonaged\nwith disabilities (Newcomer, Kang, Kaye, LaPlante, 2002).\nP\u00adE formulations beyond the Lawton\u00adNahemow model seek\nto incorporate individual preferences or predispositions along\nwith individual capability and environmental components (see\na review of these perspectives). These P\u00adE frameworks have\nfew empirical applications and require measures not available\nto this investigation.\nMETHODS\nThe study used data from the National Health Interview\nSurvey--Supplement on Disability Followback Survey (NHIS-\nD). Phase I of the NHIS-D was administered as part of the 1994\nand 1995 core NHIS interview. The NHIS-D was designed as\na nationally representative survey of community-resident\nhouseholds. The NHIS core interview is conducted annually\nby the Census Bureau for the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) and provides an overview of the general\nhealth and health care use in the civilian, noninstitutionalized\nhouseholds are surveyed through personal interviews. Items are\nself-reported or reported by a household representative.\nNHIS-D respondents identified with an indication of disabil-\nity in the interview (criteria included functional limitation,\nspecific disabling diagnoses, perception of disability, and use of\ndisability-related services) were reinterviewed 7 to 26 months\nlater in Phase II of the NHIS-D, also known as the Disability\nFollowback Survey. Median lag between interviews was 13.6\nmonths. Included in the Followback was information on the in-\ndividual's housing, the length of time he or she had lived in\nthose quarters, and his or her current functional ability (as\nmeasured by ADLs and IADLs). The NHIS-D Phase I began in\nThere were 25,805 respondents to the NHIS-D Followback\nliving outside of nursing homes and receiving or needing help\nfrom another person (including supervisory help) with either\nADLs or IADLs. Our analysis included the subset of persons\n(representing 5.4 million people) who reported receiving or\nneeding hands-on and/or supervisory or standby help from\nanother person in performing at least one ADL task. Inclusion\nof those needing supervisory or standby help with those\nneeding hands-on help allowed for a widened margin for\nidentifying persons with ADL limitations.\nMeasures\nItems in the NHIS-D Followback Survey reflected a fairly\ncomplete array of individual and environmental measures rep-\nresenting dimensions of the Lawton\u00adNahemow framework.\nThese are shown in Table 1 with sample counts and weighted\npopulation estimates. Here we discuss the expected theoretical\nrelationship of each measure to the outcome of unmet assis-\ntance needs.\nIndividual capabilities. --For the purposes of analysis, the\nmost commonly used individual capabilities are financial and\nintellectual resources, health and functional ability, and sensory\nand communication ability. Financial and intellectual resources\n(i.e., education) are thought to influence access to and pref-\nerences for various situations or adaptations. Both household\nincome and Medicaid eligibility are used here to represent finan-\ncial resources. The income item is self-reported and includes\nincome from employment, business, investments, pensions,\npublic programs, and other sources. This item does not include\nassets. Higher income may provide a family more potential\nresources for obtaining assistive services. Medicaid eligibility\naffords access to publicly funded community-based services.\nSelf-reported health status and the ability to perform ADLs\nand IADLs are representative of self-maintenance abilities. The\nuse of 5 ADLs (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating)\nand 10 IADLs (getting about inside, getting outside, trans-\nportation or getting places, shopping, preparing meals, doing\nlight and heavy housework, using the telephone, medication\nmanagement, money management) are commonly used to\nmeasure disability. We used these 15 items. Another consid-\neration in defining task limitations was whether to include only\nindividuals receiving or needing ``hands-on'' help or to also\ninclude those needing only supervision or standby help from\nanother person in performing a task. The selection of subjects\nfor this study was inclusive of need or receipt of both hands-on\nand supervisory ADL assistance. This was done to assure a\nwide net for identifying at-risk individuals.\nIncontinence, the use of special equipment (i.e., wheelchairs\nor walkers, feeding tubes, catheters), and difficulty opening or\nreaching cabinets represent inabilities and describe individual\nself-maintenance limitations. The latter may also reflect some\nadaptations. Cognitive ability reflects limitations requiring spe-\ncial adaptation by the individual caregivers. Hearing and vision\nproblems may be either life long or of recent onset. The varied\nnature of these limitations complicates the expected direction of\nassociation with the outcome of unmet need. In the context of\ncross-sectional data we might expect that higher frailty and\ncomplex care needs may be seen in a steady-state situation and\nthus may be positively associated with more attentive supports.\nFor example, self-reported health status and financial resources\nare associated with home modifications and the use of assistive\nequipment (Mathieson, Kronenfeld, Keith, 2002). On the other\nhand, a number of studies (e.g., Desai et al., 2001; LaPlante\nthat unmet need increases with the number of ADL\u00adIADL\nlimitations--conditions that may be more subject to change over\nthe short term.\nTable 1.

The presence of\na spouse and/or family members may increase the likelihood of\ninformal assistance. Frequent contact with family and friends\nmay be associated with better quality of assistance and possibly\nserve as additional sources of assistance. Paid providers may\nsupplement family members or primary assistance for those who\nare not married or living with family members--decreasing\nunmet need. A physician seen regularly is another type of social\nresource. We have included this because of possible influences\non disease management and quality assurance relative to the\nlevel of informal care.\nSocial roles and norms. --Social roles and norms were\nrepresented in our analysis by demographic attributes rather\nthan direct measurement. Gender may have represented an\nindividual's experience in various IADL tasks (e.g., shopping,\nmeal preparation, housecleaning) and expectations about them-\nselves or others as to the amount of assistance that might be\nappropriate. Age served as a marker for possible generational\ndifferences in attitudes and expectations, including perhaps\nsome difference in preference or expectation about self-suffi-\nciency and self-directed care. Race and ethnicity may have rep-\nresented cultural attitudes, such as preferences and expectations\nabout self-sufficiency, filial responsibility, and even tolerance\nfor various levels of discomfort or inconvenience. Race may\nalso have been a proxy for barriers to access to alternative\nliving situations.\nPhysical features. --The physical features of one's living\nquarters and setting and how these are associated with unmet\nADL\u00adIADL need have been studied through work focused on\nhousing modifications (e.g., to the kitchen or bathrooms), design\nfeatures (e.g., single multistory units), or the presence of special\nequipment (e.g., ramps, handrails, and elevators; Verbrugge &\nSevak, 2002). These features are thought to improve access and\nself-efficacy. In cross-sectional analysis the direction of this\neffect may be ambiguous, as adaptations may have been made\nfor those who need them and not all adaptations reduce unmet\nneed for assistance.\nAnother element of living quarters is the potentially intrinsic\nmeaning of ``home'' (Gitlin, 2003). Relocation studies have\ndrawn attention to this in noting adjustment consequences for\nthose who have moved. Studies of community-dwelling resi-\ndents have found strong preferences to remain in one's home\nand the presumed buffer this familiar setting may offer for the\nloss of personal autonomy and control (Rubinstein, 1989). The\nmeaning of home is seldom measured directly. It is much more\ncommon to use proxy measures (as we have done here), such as\na differentiation into owner versus renter, length of time in the\nresidence, and housing type. The assumption is that extended\nresidence engenders familiarity with one's home and commu-\nnity and a stronger social network. These in turn are thought to\nfacilitate adaptation and accommodation. Owners may be more\nlikely to modify the physical features to better meet their needs.\nOn the other hand, ownership may constrain relocating to a\nsetting more adapted to one's ability.\nApart from the intrinsic meaning of home, the rights and\nprivileges of an individual regarding the amount and duration of\nassistance may be affected by housing type. For example,\npersons living in a house may have fewer constraints (such as\nfrom zoning, fire and safety codes, or concerns from man-\nagement or fellow residents) on the services that may be brought\ninto the setting than an individual living in an apartment. On the\nother hand, persons living in houses may experience higher\ndemands (including IADLs) for the maintenance of the setting.\nThe direction of effect on unmet need is unclear, but evidence\nfrom the relocation studies cited earlier suggests that moves are\nsometimes reflective of adjustments to declining ability, and/or\na preference to remain living independently rather than with\nfamily members.\nBoth ownership and housing type were used, as the effect\nof ownership status would be confounded by the inclusion of\nindividuals in service-rich settings without adjusting for\nhousing type. For example, among those with ADL\nlimitations in the NHIS-D, 79.6% of those in houses were\nowners, as were 30.5% of those in houses with services. The\nbalance in both housing types were ``renters'' (with or without\nactually paying rent), as were those in apartments. We have\nincluded measures that distinguish houses, apartments, and\nhousing with services. These were consolidated from the\nhousing types in the NHIS-D (Phase II, Section A, question\n9). Information about services available in a facility distin-\nguished places providing supportive care (e.g., maid service,\nmeal preparation, medication supervision, assistance in ADLs)\nfrom apartments.\nThe last element of the environment considered was the\navailability of community resources. This was measured indi-\nrectly using community size, with the assumption that larger\ncommunities may have had more services and providers\navailable. Such availability was expected to reduce the prev-\nalence of unmet need. More specific measures of locality are\nnot available in the NHIS-D.\nOutcome of unmet need. --The outcome of the P\u00adE match\nrepresented in our analysis is the reported perception of unmet\nTable 1. Characteristics of U.S. Civilian Noninstitutionalized\nPopulation Aged 18 and Older With One or\nMore ADL Limitations (Continued)\nVariable Sample\nPopulation\nEstimate\nWeighted\nPopulation\n(%)\nSpecial features\nNotes: ADLs \u00bc activities of daily living; IADLs \u00bc instrumental ADLs; HS \u00bc\nhigh school; MSA \u00bc metropolitan statistical area. ADLs help is defined as\nreceiving or needing hands-on help. Population estimate has a low statistical\nreliability (standard error exceeds 30% of estimate). Table data are taken from\nneed for personal assistance. The NHIS-D used branch questions\niterating through each of the ADLs and IADLs to derive\na measure of unmet need. Those receiving or needing help with\na task were asked whether they need more hands-on or super-\nvisory assistance with that task. Following a convention used by\nLima & Allen (2001), a person who said they have a limitation\nbut reported that he or she had enough help was classified as\nhaving ``no unmet need.'' Those reporting that they were\nreceiving help but that they needed more help were considered as\nhaving ``inadequate help'' or unmet need. Those who said they\nneeded help from another person but did not receive it from\nany source were classified as having ``no help,'' and in our study\n(due to the small number) they were included in the unmet need\ncategory. Unmet need as a dependent variable was defined in\ntwo ways: (1) those with unmet need for only hands-on help,\nand (2) those who had unmet need for either hands-on or super-\nvision or standby help.\nAnalysis\nAnalyses were conducted using SUDAAN multivariate\nlogistic regression software (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1997).\nSeparate models were estimated for each ADL dimension. The\ntwo variations of the outcome measure were used in separate\nsets of models. Results were similar with either measure, but\nthe goodness of fit was slightly higher using only the hands-on\nhelp outcome. Only these results are reported.\nAll models adjust for differences by the main effect of age\ngroups, by housing type, and by whether the study subject\nreported for themselves or via a proxy interview. We selected\nthe approach of representing age groups and housing types by\ndummy variables (instead of having separate models for these\nsubgroups) after testing the association of age and housing\ndummy variable interactions with each of the other independent\nvariable relative to unmet need. No such interactions were\nstatistically significant. The presence of proxy respondents\nraised a concern that such respondents might overstate helper\navailability or otherwise have differential reporting on other risk\nfactors relative to self-reports. The effect of proxy respondents\nwas first evaluated using sets of models that systematically in-\ncluded and excluded these respondents. No meaningful differ-\nences in the models' risk factor coefficients were found. A\nsecond step reestimated the model using a proxy main effect and\nproxy by covariate interactions. Again, no statistically signif-\nicant interactions were found. All dimensions of our P\u00adE\nframework are represented by the measures shown in the\nmodels. All measures were entered in a single step.\nRESULTS\nWe investigated the extent to which individual and environ-\nmental characteristics demonstrate an association with housing\nadequacy as represented by unmet need for personal care\nassistance, and whether the direction of association conformed\nto P\u00adE theory-based expectations. We gave particular attention\nto whether the risk of unmet need differed between those in\nhouses and apartments once other housing features had been\nadjusted for.\nUnmet Assistance Need\nTable 2 shows the number of persons receiving or needing\nmore help in each ADL and IADL and a corresponding per-\ncentage of those reporting unmet need in that activity. There is\na substantial difference in the number of people in these com-\nparisons depending on the criteria used to define need. For\nexample, 4.4 million persons receive or need hands-on as-\nsistance in at least one ADL. This estimate increases to 5.4\nmillion if need for supervision is included.\nA somewhat less differential pattern occurs among IADLs.\nFor example, among people needing or receiving help in at least\none ADL, 4.5 million report receiving or needing hands-on\nIADL assistance, compared to 5.0 million receiving or needing\nany IADL assistance. The number of people with unmet need\nvaries across ADLs, but the proportion with unmet need is\nrelatively similar in each ADL. There is more variability among\nIADLs. In both ADLs and IADLs the proportion with unmet\nneed diminishes going from hands-on assistance need to the\nsons reported unmet need for hands-on assistance in at least one\nhelp is also considered. Bathing, transferring, and dressing were\nthe most prevalent unmet ADL needs. Almost 1.2 million\npeople with at least one ADL limitation also had unmet needs\nfor at least one IADL task, with housework, assistance walking\nor getting outside, preparing meals, and shopping being the\nmost common unmet IADL needs.\nCorrelates of Unmet ADL Assistance Needs\nTable 3 shows logistic regression results for each of five\nADLs using the outcome of unmet need for hands-on assis-\ntance. The sample in each model was limited to persons with\nthat particular ADL limitation. Similar results (available from\nthe authors) were obtained using the broader outcome of unmet\nneed for either hands-on or supervisory assistance.\nWithin a sample defined by having a limitation in at least one\nADL, intellectual capabilities represented by education level\nhad no statistically significant relationships to unmet ADL need.\nBeing eligible for Medicaid (the one financial capability\nindicator used) tended to have a protective relationship toward\nreducing unmet need, but this achieved statistical significance\nonly in bathing and transferring. Household income failed to\nshow any statistically significant effects. Physical health and\nfunctional capabilities revealed varied effects. The indicators of\nlimitations in physical functioning (e.g., number of ADL or\nIADLs, incontinence, and fair to poor health) were associated\nwith increased risk of unmet need in all models. Most of these\nodds ratios were statistically significant and of similar mag-\nnitude. Persons using special equipment (e.g., use of tracheot-\nomy tube, respirator, catheter, or feeding tube in the past 12\nmonths), and those having difficulty communicating with per-\nsons outside the family tended to have a lower risk for unmet\nneed. About half of these odds ratios were statistically signif-\nicant. Indicators of specific disability subpopulations (e.g., use\nof a wheelchair or walker, vision limitations, frequently con-\nfused, disoriented, or forgetful, or difficulty reaching or opening\ncabinets) tended to produce odds ratios approaching 1.0 and\nwere statistically nonsignificant.\nSeveral social resources variables (i.e., living with others,\nhaving a spouse provider or a paid helper, and having a proxy\nrespondent) were associated with a reduced likelihood of un-\nmet need. Most of these odds ratios were statistically significant.\nThe frequency of getting together with or talking to friends\nand family members outside one's household tended to be\nassociated with reduced unmet need risk, but only one of the\nmodels (eating) was statistically significant. Seeing a physician\nregularly and length of time in the current residence had no\nsignificant association with unmet need nor a consistent pattern\nof effects.\nAmong the social roles and norms measures, gender generally\nhad odds ratios approaching 1.0 and no statistically significant\nassociations. When compared with younger adults with\ndisabilities, those aged 65 and older showed an inconsistent\npattern of unmet need and no statistically significant odds ratios.\nWhites compared with the other racial groups showed a lower\nlikelihood of unmet need for all but eating. These effects were\nstatistically significant for bathing and dressing and for any\nunmet need. When compared with other racial/ethnic groups,\nHispanics showed an increased likelihood of unmet need across\nall ADLs. These effects were at similar levels in all models and\nwere statistically significant in all but the two least prevalent\nconditions--eating and toileting.\nPhysical environment included items representing features of\nthe living unit and its geographic location. These items were\nevaluated for their independent effects on unmet need, but their\nmost germane function was to adjust for features that might\notherwise be confounded with the living quarters classification\nof the house, apartment, or housing with services. Being in\nurban areas of greater than 1 million persons and having ramps\nor a street level entrance were both associated with a reduced\nlikelihood of unmet need. Half of these odds ratios were\nstatistically significant. Features such as having more than\na single floor, having widened doorways or hallways, and\nTable 2.

Table data are taken from the National Health Interview Survey on Disability, Phase II,\nkitchen modifications tended to show increased risk of unmet\nneed, but only two odds ratios were statistically significant.\nAutomatic or easy-open doors and an elevator or stair glide had\nodds ratio tending toward 1.0. Bathroom modifications, while\ngenerally showing no association with unmet need, had\na statistically significant association with reduced risk for\nboth eating and transferring unmet need.\nApartment dwelling, compared with those living in houses,\nwas generally statistically significant, with apartment dwellers\nhaving an increased risk for unmet need. The robustness of\nhousing type relative to homeownership was tested using\nseparate models both with and without housing type. Home-\nownership was not significant even when housing type was\nomitted. The odds ratios on most of the other covariates were\nsimilar with either the inclusion or omission of the dummy\nvariable indicative of apartments and housing with services.\nThese relationships remained testing apartment and design\nfeature interactions (e.g., by race and unit modifications and\nfeatures) and interactions among some features (e.g., number of\nfloors by the presence of an elevator and unit modifications by\ndifficulty using cabinets). These interactions (not shown) were\nnot statistically significant. Housing with services, although\nsuggesting an association with increased risk, was rarely\nstatistically significant, perhaps due to the small sample.\nAnalyses of unmet IADLs need were conducted among our\nsample of persons with at least one ADL limitation. These\nresults are available from the authors. Compared with the\nprediction of unmet need for ADL assistance, each attribute\nshowed similar patterns in associations with unmet need, but\nfewer measures in the P\u00adE model had statistically significant\nassociations. Living in an apartment, as compared with living in\na house, showed a statistically significant increased risk for\nunmet IADL assistance in walking assistance (OR \u00bc 2.1) and\ngetting outside (OR \u00bc 2.6). Odds ratios approached 1.0 for the\nother tasks.\nDISCUSSION\nThis article applies a P\u00adE framework to examine individual\nand environmental attributes for their association with living\narrangement adequacy. The analyses involve a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adults with at least one ADL limitation.\nLiving arrangement adequacy was represented using reported\nunmet need for hands-on ADL assistance. We sought to deter-\nmine the relative contribution of individual capabilities, social\nresources, social roles and norms, and physical environmental\nmeasures and adjusted for these factors to assess whether those\nTable 3.

Table values are odds ratios.\nliving in apartments were at higher risk for unmet need than those\nliving in houses. Services available from the housing facility\ndistinguished apartments from housing with services.\nThe P\u00adE framework postulates a propensity to seek settings\nmatched to one's capabilities, but it is notable that just under 1 in\n5 of those with an ADL limitation had unmet needs for that ADL.\nThis was true across all ADLs. The consequences of unmet\npersonal assistance needs (e.g., housing changes, relocations,\nfamily interventions to change primary helpers or to augment\nhelper assistance) cannot be determined from cross-sectional\ndata, but the rate of unmet need suggests that many with ADL\nlimitations may be seeking adaptations at any given time.\nAmong the several dimensions of the P\u00adE framework,\nfinancial capability represented by Medicaid eligibility (and its\npotential access to public programs) was associated with reduced\nunmetneed in all ADLs, withthe exception of eating. Asin earlier\nstudies, the likelihood of unmet need increased as the number of\nADLs increased. Other physical capability measures (e.g., fair or\npoor health, incontinence) were also evidence of an expected\nincreased likelihood of unmet need, but there were important\nexceptions. Persons using special equipment and those with\ndifficulty communicating had a lower risk of unmet need.\nPhysical capability findings taken together (consistent among\nindividual ADLs) suggest that at a point in time long-standing\ndisabilities may be reasonably well accommodated and that\nconditions subject to change over a short period are more likely to\nbe out of P\u00adE match. A corollary is that if special needs have not\nbeen addressed, then those with these disabilities likely have not\nremained in the setting.\nThe inclusion of social and physical environmental features\nadds further insight into influences on unmet need. Several social\nresources (i.e., living with others, having a spouse or paid\nproviders, and having a proxy respondent), in common with\nfindings of unmet need in the literature, were associated with\nlower unmet need in ADLs. Living with others, at a minimum,\nlikely affects the timeliness and availability of assistance. This\neffect seems to be further enhanced by having a spouse provider\nor a paid provider. Counter to expectations, social resources--\nlike frequency of talking to or getting together with family and\nfriends (that they are not living with), years in one's residence,\nand seeing a physician regularly--had no significant association\nwith unmet need. When viewed within the context of the P\u00adE\nframework, this finding may reflect the situational adjustments\nalready in place. For example, the absence of an observed effect\nfrom the social contact measures and years in one's residence\nmay be attributable to the high prevalence of social contacts\namong the sample and a function of individuals having previ-\nously substituted among social resources (including living with\nothers) to obtain acceptable levels of social interaction. Physician\neffects, also nonsignificant, may be explained by the high\nprevalence of physician use among the study population--those\nwith at least one ADL limitation.\nAge, gender, and race were used to represent social roles and\nnorms and had varied effects. Whites, when compared with other\nracial groups, tended to have lower risks for unmet ADL\nassistance, especially tasks of bathing and dressing--ADLs that\nare perhaps the most easily addressed and that are the least\ndisruptive to a household. Hispanics tended to have higher risks\nfor unmet needs than non-Hispanics. This pattern was present for\nall ADLs, with the exception of eating. Whether these findings\nare the result of cultural preferences or individual expectations\nabout appropriate levels of care or differential access to assistance\ncannot be determined from the NHIS-D. Nevertheless, one might\nconsider whether the lower prevalence of unmet need among\nWhites is due to the presence of more assistance in the home\nversus a prior period selection and relocation to alternative living\nsettings (e.g., housing with services or nursing homes) where\nsuch assistance might be available. Conversely, higher unmet\nneed prevalence among Hispanics may be a reflection of either\na willingness on the part of caregivers (or the respondent) to\naccept higher levels of frailty among household members or an\ninability (including possibleracial discrimination) to findsuitable\nalternatives.\nAge and gender did not show systematic associations with\nunmet ADL needs. In the context of the P\u00adE model, this suggests\nthat there are few gender or age group differences in preferences\nor expectations about appropriate ADL assistance. Such a finding\nlikely requires further investigation with direct measurement of\npreferences and expectations.\nPhysical environmental features were incorporated into the\nanalysis to assess the extent to which they modulated and/or\ncomplemented the individual attributes and social resource\naffects commonly used in analysis of unmet ADL needs.\nParticular attention was given to possible differences between\nthose living in houses versus those living in apartments. Those\nliving in apartments were about 50% more likely to report unmet\nADL needs than those living in houses. The analysis controlled\nfor specific design features (number of floors, room and door\nmodifications, presence of lifts and elevators) to partial out any\neffect of these features and not spuriously attribute them to\nhousing type. Additional analyses (not shown) tested interactions\nof housing type with the individual capability measures and\nsocial resources. These tested whether there were any capability\nand resource differences associated with living quarters. These\ninteractions were not significant.\nThe finding of higher unmet need among those living in\napartments is consistent with the notion that apartment residents\nmay have more restrictions on services or unit modifications\nthan those residing in houses, but at least three other\nexplanations are suggested by theory. One is that the familiarity\nand even meaning of ``home'' may be stronger among those\nliving in houses than apartments. Some would suggest that such\na connection may enhance the ability to accommodate to one's\nlevel of needs. Another interpretation is that selection factors\nmay be differentiating those living in houses from those living in\napartments, with apartment residents perhaps being more\nwilling to ``accept'' certain levels of unmet need as a trade-off\nfor living independently or because the alternative may be\na transition into a higher (and undesired) level of care. A\ncorollary to the selection hypothesis is that those living in\nhouses have a lower threshold of unmet needs adaptation\n(perhaps due to the higher daily living demands of a house,\nthings such as housekeeping and maintenance, and poorer\nproximity to shopping). A lower threshold would suggest that\nadaptations, such as obtaining higher assistance levels or\nrelocation to alternative settings, may occur either more quickly\nor in anticipation of assistance needs.\nWhile there are theory-based explanations for the finding of\ndifferences between apartment and house dwellers, there is still\nthe risk that this difference may be attributable to unmeasured\nattributes. For example, even though we adjusted for income, the\npresence of paid providers, and household size in our models,\nthere may be differentials we did not measure. One of these might\nbe that those in houses have more disposable income to hire more\npaid help hours. This might be particularly true among home-\nowners with paid-off mortgages. Houses, too, might provide\nmore room for family and other helpers to stay as needed,\nincluding short-term stays.\nFinally, while the P\u00adE framework suggests several plausible\nexplanations for the risk of and/or reduction in unmet personal\nassistance needs, it is important to recognize that this study has\nnot directly tested the adaptations that are attempted and/or made,\nnor examined the consequences of continued unmet need. Panel\nstudies are needed to determine whether unmet need is protracted\nand whether those withoutsupport relocate outofthe community.\nIn this vein, we call particular attention to those with special\nequipment needs, cognitive impairment, or social isolation. The\nobserved low prevalence of unmet need may belie avoidable\ncircumstances that in a prior period may have ``selected'' against\nthose with these limitations.\nSimilarly, physical features, including many unit modifica-\ntions, were found to have little relationship to unmet need in the\ncontext of cross-sectional data. These findings should not be\ninterpreted as evidence that design features have no value for\nthose with limitations. The main function of these items in this\nstudy was to help achieve unbiased estimators on housing type\nand to minimize a spurious attribution of a housing type effect\nwhen the underlying factor might be a design feature. More\nrefined and time-specific comparisons are required for an\nevaluation of efficacy. Our analysis measured the presence of\na feature, but not whether it was appropriate or sufficient for the\nlimitations of the individual in that setting at that time. An\nillustration of the potentially complex relationships is that of\nkitchen modifications and widened doorways and hallways.\nThese tended to be associated with increased, rather than dimin-\nished, unmet ADL need. Such a counterintuitive relationship\nseems more plausibly explained by these modifications having\noccurred in a prior period than in causing the unmet need.\nIn addition, more work is needed for better understanding of\nthe multiple factors that may be operating to influence the\nobserved race and ethnicity differences. We suggest possible\nselection effects associated with preferences, expectations,\nstructural barriers, and discrimination, but a full investigation\nof these issues requires direct measurement of these phenom-\nena.\n"
