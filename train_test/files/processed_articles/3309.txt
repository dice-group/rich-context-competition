    "abstract": "Abstract\nA new typology of school-level values is reported in three cultural contexts. School values were assessed by aggregating the\nEuropean schools and 163 teachers from 6 of these schools (Study 2), using Schwartz's Portrait Values Questionnaire. Six\nschool values emerged in both studies: achievement, autonomy, egalitarianism, harmony, compliance, and dominance. The\nimportance of studying school-level values was demonstrated by relating the values of compliance and dominance to violence,\nand harmony values to student support measures (Study 1). Strong (minimal r = .64) school-level correlations between\nstudents of different ages and teachers supported the validity of the findings (Study 2).\n",

One of their main goals\nis socialization to specific values, considered by the society\nto be desirable (Halstead, 1996). It is therefore crucial to gain\na better understanding of the values prevalent in schools.\nSurprisingly, however, no coherent typology exists that out-\nlines the cultural dimensions of schools and allows research-\ners to study schools by their values. In this article, we address\nthis gap by providing a typology of school values, testing it\nin three cultural contexts, and looking for meaningful rela-\ntionships of school values with several additional variables.\nValues are abstract trans-situational goals, varying in\nimportance, that pertain to desirable end-states or behaviors,\nand guide selection or evaluation of behaviors and events\nitly or explicitly shared among group members. For example,\nnational and organizational cultures are distinguished by\ntheir values, the ideas they hold about the right, wrong, and\nthe desirable in the group context (Hofstede, 1991; Schwartz,\nnorms, symbols, rituals, practices, and ways of thinking.\nThey are the vocabulary of socially approved goals used to\nmotivate action and to express and justify the preferred solu-\nWe suggest that schools can be characterized by the val-\nues prevalent among their members, students, and teachers.\nMoreover, schools differ in the values they stress. The dif-\nferential importance placed on values may be manifest\nthrough school rules, teaching practices, relations among\nteachers and students, and more. Describing a school by its\nvalues can allow researchers to predict behaviors at schools,\nand provide focused tools for intervention in case of school\nmalfunctioning.\nIn Study 1, we propose several potential value dimensions\nthat are likely to differentiate between schools. We test for\nthe existence and replication of these dimensions using\nschool-level value scores derived from the aggregated\nresponses of students in 32 Jewish and Arab schools from\nIsrael. We also relate these dimensions to several school-\nlevel variables, such as school violence and ethnic school\nsystem.\nGroup-level values are shared to some extent by most\nmembers of the group (Schwartz, 1999). Although, for\nexample, there are likely to be average differences between\nteachers and students, all school members are expected to\nshare their values to a large extent, because they belong to\nthe same social environment. In Study 2, we replicate the\nvalue structure, and test the hypothesis that the values of\nteachers, older students, and younger students across schools\nare positively correlated in a third, Central European, cul-\ntural context.\n1University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\n2University of Potsdam, Germany\n3Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, Israel\nCorresponding Authors:\nElla Daniel, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5L 1C6\nEmail: ella.dn@gmail.com, and\nAriel Knafo, Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel.\nEmail: msarielk@mscc.huji.ac.il\nSchool Values Across Three Cultures: A\nTypology and Interrelations\nElla Daniel1, Nadi Hofmann-Towfigh2, and Ariel Knafo3\n Keywords\nvalues, school values, school culture\n2 SAGE Open\nTheoretical Background: School Values\nAs a Private Case of Group Values\nPast research on school characteristics described schools\nusing a number of dimensions in the purpose of predicting\nschool outcomes and especially achievement. Among the\ndimensions researched, one can find past abilities as well as\ndemographic characteristics, such as mean socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) of the students' families and level of education\nof parents (e.g., Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2001;\nRaudenbush & Bryk, 1986). Other characteristics measured\nare school climate, such as the social-emotional climate at\nschool (e.g., whether the school is characterized by enthusi-\nasm or suspicion; Emmons, Efimba, & Hagopian, 1998;\nLehr & Christenson, 2002; Lynch, Lerner, & Leventhal,\npractices and beliefs (Phillips, 1997), cooperation among\nstaff, and the importance assigned to orderly atmosphere\n(Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2001; Raudenbush & Bryk,\nIn the current research, we propose that a characterization\nof schools based on the values they endorse will be useful for\ndifferentiating between schools, and predicting norms and\nbehaviors in them. Research on school values can be under-\ntaken using a number of techniques, each holding advantages\nand disadvantages. Values can be extracted from artifacts of\nthe schools, values of school principals and teachers, and\ndescriptions of the school values by the students (e.g.,\napproach, relying on students or teachers as reporters of their\nown values, and using the aggregated responses as indicators\nof the priority given to each value at the school level (mean-\ningful within-school variations in values notwithstanding).\nOur approach is based on the notion that school culture com-\nprised the opinions, attitudes, and values of those inhabiting\nthe schools. The aggregation of individuals' values keeps in\ncheck the individual variability, revealing the values com-\nmon in the school.\nPast studies found the aggregation of individual charac-\nteristics a reliable, valid, and useful technique to measure the\ncultural values of nations (Schwartz, 1999) as well as organi-\nzations (Hofstede, Bond, & Luk, 1993). The values of the\nindividuals in organizations are a product of their shared cul-\nture as well as the unique personal experience. The variation\nbetween individuals can express the uniqueness, while the\naverage priorities reflect the central thrust of the shared\nenculturation. The variation between the aggregated scores is\nlargely independent of the variation at the individual level\nleading to independent analyses and results (Hofstede et al.,\nAlthough little theoretical work has been done regarding\nthe meaning of school values, there is extensive work about\nvalues in other groups, particularly national cultures. We rely\non this work in defining school values. Similarly to national\nabstract goals that are shared to some extent by members of\nthe school community, such as students, teachers, and other\nstaff. Group values prescribe norms for individual members,\nthus directing their behavior (Fischer, 2006; Schwartz,\n1999). In schools in which prosocial values are considered\nhighly important, for example, school members are likely to\nbe encouraged to engage in mutual aid, and be responsible\nfor the welfare of others, through behaviors such as help in\ndoing school assignments.\nNot all school members are likely to have the same impact\non school values. For example, school principals may be\nmore influential than the typical student or the typical\nteacher. However, over time, the school community comes to\nshare values to a certain degree. This process occurs through\nselection of like-minded members and socialization to value\npreferences (De Cooman et al., 2009). The value preferences\nof the school are conveyed to the members through everyday\nexperiences, such as the content and perceived difficulty\nlevel of the learning tasks, the dominant patterns of interac-\ntion among students and teachers, and the evaluation proce-\ndures used (Boekaerts, de Koning, & Vedder, 2006). Thus,\nschool regulations and practices should reflect in part the\nvalues of the schools. These regulations serve the purpose of\nsocializing new members to hold these values (e.g., Chatman,\nThe existence of shared school values does not preclude\nindividual differences within schools. For example, Ferrari,\nKapoor, and Cowman (2005) provided evidence that institu-\ntional-level values of universities do not fully overlap with\nstudents' personal value systems (see also Astill, Feather, &\npressures are expected to increase adherence to school values\nwith time, there is still room for individual differences in the\nextent these values are accepted by school members due to\ntheir individual personalities or backgrounds. These within-\nschool differences in value priorities are reflected in within-\nschool individual differences in behavior, school\nContent of School Values\nIn proposing a typology of school values, one may consider\nthe values of individuals (Schwartz, 1992) and the values of\nnational cultures (Schwartz, 2008) as possible reference\npoints. We see cultural values as a more relevant value typol-\nogy, as schools, like nations, are an assembly of individuals,\nlinked by common goals, practices, and norms. School val-\nues, like national values, can be seen as ideas about what is\nright and wrong, desirable and undesirable, which are implic-\nitly or explicitly shared among members of the group.\nThe cultural dimensions of values reflect the basic issues\nor problems that societies confront to regulate their mem-\nbers' actions. Schools face somewhat similar issues or prob-\nlems to the ones confronted by nations, such as regulating the\nnature of relations between the individual and the group. We\nDaniel et al. 3\ntherefore choose to base the typology of school values on the\nvalues of national cultures and not on the values of individu-\nals. Nevertheless, schools also face issues and problems rel-\nevant to their unique social role of teaching and socializing\nchildren and adolescents, and we should therefore also con-\nsider school-specific issues that may lead to value priorities.\nSuch issues are the questions of evaluating students and\nemphasis on cognitive functioning. Hereinafter, we will\ndescribe the school value dimensions hypothesized to be\nsimilar to nations' value dimensions and the value dimen-\nsions expected to be unique to schools.\nEmbeddedness Versus Autonomy\nAn important issue confronting societies is the nature of the\nrelations between the individual and the group. Particularly,\nsocial entities differ markedly in the extent to which indi-\nviduals are considered autonomous or embedded in their\ngiven to embeddedness (emphasizing group identification\nand conforming to group norms and rules and the traditional\norder) versus autonomy (viewing each person as an autono-\nmous, bounded entity encouraged to pursue and express his\nare also relevant to organizations, which differ in whether\nthey put an emphasis on interdependence, rules, and codes,\non one hand, or on independence and change, on the other\nApplied to schools, valuing rules at school has been found\nrelevant to variables such as parental school involvement\n(Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002). Autonomy has also been\ndescribed as an important ethical principle distinguishing\nbetween schools (Schulte et al., 2002). For example, some\nschools may vary in their views about students' personal\nresponsibility for their academic success or failure. In sum,\nwe expected schools to differ in the importance given to\nembeddedness and autonomy values.\nHierarchy Versus Egalitarianism\nThis second issue is especially relevant to schools because of\ntheir hierarchical structures. Groups must find a way to guar-\nantee responsible behavior that preserves the social fabric,\nincluding cooperation and mutual consideration. In their\nsolution to this problem, societies are differentially posi-\ntioned on the spectrum of values going from hierarchy (legit-\nimizing an unequal distribution of power, roles, and\nresources), on one end, and egalitarianism (an emphasis on\nequality pursued through unselfish pursuit of others'welfare;\nSchwartz, 1999), on the other. Hierarchical organizations\nemphasize the chain of authority, in contrast to egalitarian\norganizations, which assign flexible roles and enable nego-\ntiation as means of motivating members (Sagiv & Schwartz,\n2000). To ensure the smooth activity of the school, decisions\nhave to be made on whether to establish a hierarchical nature\nof school organization, with teachers as more powerful and\nstudents as compliant (and perhaps also with power differ-\nences between different students, such as older and younger\nstudents), or whether students are considered equal to teach-\ners when important decisions are made. Indeed, Pang (1996)\nfound school differences in how much each school has a for-\nmalized, centralized, and well-established system of superor-\ndinate\u00adsubordinate relationships.\nHierarchy values at schools were expected to focus on\nhumility and compliance, on one hand, and on dominance\nand social power, on the other hand, because in a hierarchical\nsociety it is important for members to acknowledge their\ninferiority to some as well as their superiority to others\n(Schwartz, 1999). For example, in hierarchical schools, older\nstudents can give high importance to their higher status as\ncompared with younger students, but accept the higher status\nascribed to teachers.\nPrevious studies have also indicated that schools vary in\ntwo aspects of egalitarianism as described by Schwartz\nparticipation of teachers (Pang, 1996) and students (Harber\nreflect the egalitarian aspect of this value. The caring aspect\nof egalitarianism is reflected in past studies indicating school\ndifferences in the importance of collegiality and students'\nmutual support (Doyle Lynch et al., 2012; Higgins-\nPeled, 2002). In sum, we expected a dimension of school\nvalues contrasting egalitarianism (and care) and hierarchy at\nschools.\nMastery Versus Harmony\nA third basic issue that cultures encounter concerns our rela-\ntion their relations to the natural and social world. According\nto Schwartz (1999), harmony values describe acceptance of\nthe world as it is, trying to fit in rather than change or exploit\nit. Harmony values emphasize fitting harmoniously into the\nenvironment (Schwartz, 1999). In organizations, this issue is\nreflected in the level of competitiveness versus cooperation\n(Sagiv & Schwartz, 2000). Harmony values may be impor-\ntant to school functioning through the regulation of relation-\nships inside schools, and between the schools and their\ncommunities. For example, in high-harmony schools, deci-\nsions may be made through agreements rather than through a\nvoting procedure or simply principal-initiated regulations.\nThe opposite solution to the issue, mastery values, empha-\nsizes getting ahead through active self-assertion, by respond-\ning to challenges, mastering, and changing the world (note\nthat despite the similar label, this concept is very different\nthan that of mastery goals, for example, Elliot & Church,\n1997). Mastery values have two major aspects. One aspect\ndescribes an emphasis on facing challenge and adventure. A\nvalue representative of this aspect will be the value \"daring.\"\n4 SAGE Open\nIn the school context, this aspect may be of secondary impor-\ntance. A second aspect of mastery values, the aspect of striv-\ning ahead and achieving, may be of supreme importance to\nschools. Values representing this aspect may focus on ambi-\ntion and success. Due to this differential relevance, we\ndecided to emphasize achievement as the defining feature of\nmastery values in the school context.\nAchievement\nThe role of individual students'achievement values has been\nStudents'achievement goals were demonstrated to be impor-\ntant for predicting success (Harackiewicz, Baron, Tauer,\nCarter, & Elliot, 2000). Moving on to the school level, all\nmodern schools share the task of helping students reach a\ncertain standard in their studies. However, schools differ in\nthe relative importance given to achievement of this stan-\ndard. This emphasis is expressed by multiple characteristics,\nsuch as reinforcement and incentives for high academic stan-\ndards (Pang, 1996), as well as physical plant, and teaching\nmethodology (Roeser, Urdan, & Stephens, 2009). Not only\ndo schools differ in the level of achievement value but they\nalso frame achievement differently. Schools can emphasize\nlearning, thus supporting effort and self-improvement. They\ncan also emphasize performance, thus encouraging demon-\nstration of ability, comparison among students, and striving\nfor high grades as a main goal of learning (Anderman &\nSchool culture of achievement has important contribu-\ntions to student-level characteristics. School achievement\nculture was found related to the motivation of students, their\nidentification with the school, and their engagement in the\nschool; to students' self-esteem; to self-regulation strategies;\nand finally, to the achievement of students (Church, Elliot, &\nimportant characteristic shaping the everyday lives of stu-\ndents at schools, we expected to find achievement values to\nbe a defining feature of mastery values, differentiating\namong schools in a substantive manner in our study.\nThe Structure of Value Types\nThe value types suggested above are hypothesized to form\ndimensions that express the conflicts between alternative\nresolutions to issues faced by schools. Because of these con-\ntradictions, we expect an emphasis on a value to go along\nwith a de-emphasis of the opposing type. At the same time,\ncompatibilities are possible between values from different\ndimensions. That is, certain value emphases are likely to be\naccompanied by other value emphases, to the extent they\nshare similar assumptions and motivations. These relations\nof conflicts and compatibilities are summarized in the circu-\nlar structure formed by the school value system. For exam-\nple, egalitarianism values and autonomy values share the\nassumption that people can and should be held responsible\nfor their actions and decisions. Embeddedness and hierarchy\nvalues share the assumption that each individual has group\nobligations and roles that may override personal inclinations\n(Schwartz, 2008). We expected school values to follow the\npattern of conflicts and compatibilities described at the cul-\ntural level.\nIn conclusion, we hypothesized that schools differ across\nthree value dimensions relevant to groups in general: hierar-\nchy versus egalitarianism, embeddedness versus autonomy,\nand harmony versus mastery. We hypothesized that mastery\nvalues will take the form of achievement values. Moreover,\nwe expected the structure of the values at the school level to\nresemble the structure of group values. Last, we hypothe-\nsized that the school values found will be able to predict\nschool-level characteristics. We addressed these issues in\nStudy 1 investigated the structure of values at the school\nlevel in Israeli Jewish and Arab high schools. In Israel,\nJewish and Arab students study in different school systems,\nboth under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.\nThe structure of the curriculum in both school system is\nnearly identical. It differs mainly in the cultural and reli-\ngious subjects, and in the language of instruction (Benavot\n& Resh, 2003). The students in the Jewish schools are mem-\nbers of the Jewish majority in Israel. This group comprises\n79% of the Israeli population. The students in the Arab\nschools are Arab citizens of Israel. Their families are likely\nto have lived in the area that is now Israel since before its\nfoundation. They are approximately 18% of the Israeli pop-\nulation, and belong to two main religions, Islam and\nChristianity. They live mostly in homogeneous Arab vil-\nlages or segregated neighborhoods in mixed cities\n(Rabinowitz, 2001). Israeli Jews were previously found to\nreport higher importance assigned to values of autonomy\nand mastery than Israeli Arabs, while Israeli Arabs reported\nhigher importance assigned to values of hierarchy and\nembeddedness than Israeli Jews (Schwartz, 2008).\nValue structure was analyzed using multidimensional\nscaling (MDS) as recommended by Schwartz (1999;\ntypes as fuzzy sets arrayed on a continuum of related empha-\nses. Value items are grouped into value domains based on\ntheoretical considerations and the empirical location of\nitems, where items emerging adjacent in the value structure\nare considered to share similar meanings and to point to a\nshared emphasis (Schwartz, 1992). Replication of the struc-\nture across sample types and cultures provides the best evi-\ndence for the validity of a value theory (e.g., Schwartz &\nSagiv, 1995). We measured school values by aggregating\nresponses across individuals attending the same school, as\nexplained earlier.\nDaniel et al. 5\nOur first question was whether meaningful value dimen-\nsions could be found that may distinguish between schools.\nWe addressed this issue with data from a substantial number\nof schools (N = 32). The second question addressed the issue\nof replicability of the value dimensions found. We compared\nthe school-level value structure in two ethnic cultures by\ncomparing Arab and Jewish schools in Israel. Next, we\naddressed the relevance of the value dimensions by asking\nwhether the value dimensions were meaningful for compar-\ning schools of different ethnic backgrounds in their value\npriorities, and for studying the relationships between school-\nlevel values and several social characteristics of schools\n(violence levels and school treatment of students).\nMeaningful relationships would exemplify the usefulness of\nthe value dimensions in understanding between-school dif-\nferences in other variables.\nMethod\nParticipants. High school students (N = 907) attending 33 dif-\nferent schools participated in the study. Of the participants,\n3% could not be assigned to a school or attended a school\nwith less than 15 participants in the sample, and were there-\nfore not included in the analysis. The final sample included\ndents on average in each school. Adolescents' ages ranged\nJews\nArabs\nthe respondents were female (49% among Jewish adoles-\ncents, 50% among Arab adolescents). Arab adolescents were\n51% of the sample (20% of the age-relevant population in\nthe country; Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, 2005) to\nensure an adequate sample size for cross-cultural\ncomparisons.\nProcedure.Schools were randomly sampled in each sector\nacross different levels of SES, as classified by the Israeli\nMinistry of Education. An attempt was made to reach about\nequal numbers of schools from the lower, middle, and upper\nrange of socioeconomic development. This resulted in 34%\nof the schools being from the top three deciles of socioeco-\nnomic development relative to schools of the same ethnic\ngroup, 36% from the middle three deciles, and 27% from the\nlower four deciles. This distribution did not differ signifi-\ncantly between Arab and Jewish schools, 2(2) = 1.14, ns,\nmeaning that schools similarly represented socioeconomic\nvariation within each ethnic group. Nevertheless, it is impor-\ntant to note there were between-group differences in SES.\nFor example, the mean parental education level in Jewish\nschools in which at least 15 students participated were\nretained for school-level analysis.\nAdolescents were recruited by telephone during 2005.\nEach ethnic group was reached in a procedure that was more\nlikely to yield a relatively high participation rate within that\ngroup. Adolescents attending Jewish schools were\napproached through phone numbers taken from student\ndirectories for high schools. Classes were randomly sampled\nfrom within the school, and all students who were listed for\nthe specific class were approached, and requested to partici-\npate. Adolescents attending Arab schools, for which no\nequivalent phonebooks existed, were approached with the\nuse of a snowball technique.\nA university student of the relevant ethnic group adminis-\ntered the questionnaire in the adolescents' homes to the ado-\nlescents who agreed to participate (46%) and received\nparental permission to do so. A small (7%) proportion of the\nsample (n = 62 Jewish adolescents) answered the question-\nnaire on a secure website. No significant differences on any\nof the study variables were found between adolescents who\nanswered a paper\u00adpencil questionnaire and those who\nresponded on the Internet. Adolescents were assured that\ntheir responses would be anonymous and confidential. They\nwere instructed to answer the questionnaires alone, without\nparental intervention or the presence of peers, and were\noffered to hand the questionnaires back in sealed envelopes.\nMaterials.\nThe questionnaires contained several parts,\nregarding adolescents' values, perception of school charac-\nteristics, violent victimization, and violent behavior. Each\nrespondent completed the questionnaire in his or her native\nlanguage (Hebrew or Arabic). Back-translation procedures\nensured the comparability of the Arabic and Hebrew\nquestionnaires.\nValues.\nValues were assessed with the Portrait Val-\nues Questionnaire (PVQ; Schwartz et al., 2001; Schwartz,\nLehmann, & Roccas, 1999). We used a version tested by\nSchwartz and Rubel (2005) in a multicultural study. The\nPVQ has been shown to be suitable for use with adolescents\nbal portraits of 40 people (matched to the respondent's gen-\nder). Each portrait describes the person's goals, aspirations,\nor wishes, pointing implicitly to the importance of a single\nbroad value. Two exemplary portraits are as follows: \"It is\nimportant to her to be rich. She wants to have a lot of money\nand expensive things\" and \"It is important to him always to\nbehave properly. He wants to avoid doing anything people\nwould say is wrong.\" Respondents indicated \"How much\nlike you is this person?\" for each portrait, using a 6-point\nscale ranging from \"very much like me\" to \"not like me at\nall.\" Thus, respondents' own values were inferred from their\nself-reported similarity to people who are described in terms\nof particular values.\nAs a preliminary analysis, we ensured that Jewish and\nArab adolescents understood the value items in a similar\nway. We conducted smallest space analyses (SSA; Guttman,\n1968) in which the values of Jewish and Arab adolescents\n6 SAGE Open\nyielded structures very similar to the prototypical, circular\nstructure of values described by Schwartz (1992). This anal-\nysis indicated that Jewish and Arab adolescents construed\ntheir values at the individual level very similarly. Three items\nwere located in different areas of the structure for both\ngroups (country safety, stable government, fit into nature).\nThese items were omitted from the school-level analyses to\npreserve the cross-cultural equivalence of value meaning.\nTo control for scale use differences across cultures that\nare independent of value structures (Fischer, 2004; Schwartz,\n1992), we standardized each value item within individual, so\nthat each individual student's responses reflected the impor-\ntance he or she gave to that item relatively to all value items.\nWe then averaged the standardized scores of all students\navailable from each school to form an aggregated school-\nlevel item score. We performed all further analyses on these\ntransformed data.\nSchool violence.This measure was adapted from Benben-\nishty, Zeira, and Astor (2000) by selecting eight items (from a\nlarger pool) that measured direct violent behavior, in different\nlevels of severity, and by asking adolescents not only to report\non violent behaviors they were victims of, as in the original\nversion, but also on their own behavior and the behavior of\ntheir best two friends. Every student was asked about the fre-\nquency of his or her own violent behavior (e.g., picked up a\nstone or another object to hurt another student; took things\nfrom another student by use of force), about the frequency\nin which he or she was a victim of another student's vio-\nlent behavior, and finally about the frequency of his or her\ntwo best friends' violent behavior over the last 12 months.\nAnswers were given on a 3-point scale (0 = never, 1 = once\nor twice, 2 = 3 times or more). A total score was calculated by\nsumming responses across all items of each scale, with higher\nscores indicating more frequent violence. We then aggregated\nthe scores on each of the three variables across all respon-\ndents from each school, creating three scores (perpetration,\nvictimization, and friends' behavior) for the violence level in\nthat school. The violence variables, like the school values,\nwere therefore created as characteristics of schools, and not\nof individuals. They describe the level of violence prevalent\nin this school and encountered by the students studying in it,\nwhether they take part in it themselves or not.\nSchool climate.We assessed school climate with a scale\nof nine items taken from scales by Benbenishty et al. (2000).\nIn the present study, the scale consisted of two subscales.\nOne subscale focused on students' participation in school\ndecision-making processes (e.g., \"Our school staff makes an\neffort to enable students' participation in making important\ndecisions\"). The other one assessed teachers' support (e.g.,\n\"When I have a problem, I feel comfortable discussing it\nwith my teachers\"). Respondents indicated how much they\nagreed with each of eight statements on a scale, ranging from\n1 = disagree to 5 = agree. Items were then aggregated within\nschools. Again, school climate was a characteristic of the\nschool as all respondents reported of it, and not of the sub-\njective perspective of any individual student.\nResults\nIdentifying School-Level Value Dimensions. We ran a series of\nconsecutive MDS analyses on the school-level value scores.\nWe used the alternating least-squares algorithm (ALSCAL)\nprocedure in SPSS 20, adding no initial configuration. ALS-\nCAL differs from other MDS procedures in minimizing\nS-Stress rather than Stress, thereby fitting squared distances\nto squared similarities (Borg & Groenen, 2010). Because of\nthe large number of items and the relatively small number of\nschools, we were interested in reducing the number of items\nto include only those that could robustly and meaningfully\naddress variation across schools.\nOur first criterion was cross-cultural similarity in mean-\nshown to have a cross-culturally similar meaning at the indi-\nvidual level in preliminary analyses (Knafo, Daniel, &\ntains to the importance of religion, because the educational\nsystem in Israel is highly segregated based on religiosity\nlevel (e.g., there are Jewish religious and Jewish nonreli-\ngious schools), and the meaning of this item may be different\nacross these school systems.\nOur second criterion was face validity and content mean-\ningfulness of the groups of items. We attempted to find\nmeaningful regions in the school-level MDS analysis. A\nnumber of items were positioned in the proximity of items\nthat were not conceptually related to them. For example, the\nthree individual-level Schwartz (1992) hedonism values\nwere dispersed in the school-level value structure and did not\nrelate in an internally valid way to the items in their vicinity.\nPossibly, hedonism has little meaning as a school-level\nvalue. Six more items from diverse Schwartz (1992) value\ningful relations to the items in the regions they appeared in.\nSuch items were therefore dropped from further analysis. We\nended up with 27 items that had cross-cultural meaning\nequivalence and formed meaningful clusters of at least 3\nitems each, with Stress 1 value of .03, which represents an\nexcellent representation (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). Figure 1\npresents the final MDS structure.\nThe first dimension we described in our theoretical back-\nground referred to embeddedness versus autonomy. A clear\nautonomy region emerged (Figure 1, middle right) with six\nitems ( = .70), emphasizing openness to intellectual experi-\nences and behavioral choice. Potential embeddedness items\nsuch as secure surroundings, cleanliness, and behaving prop-\nerly appeared at the opposite end of the figure, but did not\nform a clear embeddedness region.\nAs expected, a region emerged that included both aspects\nof hierarchy values, namely, humility and compliance, on\nDaniel et al. 7\none hand, and dominance and social power, on the other\nhand (Figure 1, top left). However, in contrast to the expec-\ntations, a clear distinction also emerged between these two\naspects, in this study as well as in Study 2. The values of\ncompliance formed a distinct group, relating to issues of\nobedience and acceptance of one's place in the social world.\nThe values of dominance formed another group, relating to\nissues of authority and command. We therefore retained\ntwo separate values. Dominance values (Figure 1, top left)\nincluded three items ( = .68), emphasizing being at the top\nof the social hierarchy: being rich, being in charge, and\nleading. Compliance values (Figure 1, middle left) included\nthree items ( = .50), emphasizing accepting one's position\nwhen at the lower end of the social hierarchy (being humble\nand modest, behaving properly, doing as told, and follow-\ning rules).\nWe also expected to find a region of values emphasiz-\ning the importance of egalitarianism. This region was\nfound (Figure 1, top right). This value included seven\nitems ( = .80), emphasizing broadmindedness and equal-\nity, protection of the weak, forgiveness, loyalty, and sup-\nporting and helping others.\nA harmony region was also found (Figure 1, bottom\nleft) with five value items ( = .77). As suggested by\nSchwartz (1999) regarding national cultures, harmony val-\nues emphasize both harmony with the surrounding physi-\ncal environment (cleanliness, caring for nature) and social\nharmony (secure surroundings, being satisfied with less,\nand world peace).\nFinally, as was theoretically postulated, a clear achieve-\nment region emerged (Figure 1, bottom right) with three\nitems ( = .69), emphasizing ambition, getting ahead, and\nsucceeding and impressing others. This value is very similar\nto the individual-level achievement value described by\nSchwartz (1992). Table 1 presents the definitions of the six\nvalues we identified.\nThe order of the values emerging from the analysis was as\nfollows: dominance, compliance, harmony, achievement,\nautonomy, and egalitarianism. Thus, harmony values were\nlocated in a position different than hypothesized, alongside\nthe opposing achievement values, resulting in shifts in the\nstructure.\nCross-Culturally Replicating the School-LevelValue Structure.We\nnext asked whether the structure obtained would replicate in\nthe two cultural groups. We averaged the items belonging to\neach value domain to scores representing the six school-level\nvalues and ran the analysis separately for Jewish and Arab\nschools. (We used average scores to reduce the number of\nitems in an MDS based on less than 20 schools.) The ALS-\nCAL procedure yielded Stress 1 values smaller than .01 for\nJews and Arabs. As Figure 2 shows, the structure was similar\nfor the two groups, with the values similarly ordered (going\nfrom the bottom left, clockwise): dominance, compliance,\nharmony, egalitarianism, autonomy, and achievement. This\ncross-cultural replication supports the validity of our find-\nings, and enables a mean comparison of the importance of\nthe six school values in each group. Moreover, when sepa-\nrated across cultures, harmony values were located in the\nhypothesized position, between the values of compliance and\negalitarianism, and in opposition to the values of\nachievement.\nCross-Cultural Differences in Value Importance.The value\ndimensions that characterize Jewish and Arab schools were\nfound similar in structure. Thus, schools from both cultures\ncan be distinguished based on the same value dimensions.\nWe tried to examine the relevance of the six values derived in\nthis study by demonstrating their ability to distinguish\nbetween schools coming from the separate ethnic cultures. If\nFigure 1. Value structure at the school level: MDS using Israeli\nJewish and Arab school means.\nNote: MDS = multidimensional scaling.\nTable 1. Definitions of Six School-Level Values.\nValue Definition\nDominance Striving for reaching the top of the social\nhierarchy; being rich, being in charge, and\nleading.\nCompliance Accepting one's position and obligations toward\nthe social system and toward the upper end\nof the social hierarchy; being humble, modest,\nand obedient.\nHarmony Aspiring for harmony with the surrounding\nphysical and social environments; avoiding\nconflict, danger, and disorder.\nEgalitarianism The importance of caring for others and respect\nfor them; broadmindedness and equality,\nprotection of the weak, loyalty, and helping.\nAutonomy Openness to intellectual experiences and the\nimportance of behavioral choice.\nAchievement Motivation for striving ambitiously to get ahead,\nsucceeding and impressing others.\n8 SAGE Open\nethnic culture has an effect on the values prevalent in the\nschools, then the schools originating from different cultures\nwill support different values.\nWe compared the mean importance given to values in\nArab and Jewish schools. Large and significant differences\nwere found in all values (Table 2). Even the smallest effect\nsize (D = 0.77 for dominance) is considered large in Cohen's\n(1992) terms. In Jewish schools, there was higher impor-\ntance to dominance, egalitarianism, and autonomy values,\nwhereas in Arab schools higher importance was given to\ncompliance, harmony, and achievement. Thus, school values\nwere successful in differentiating between schools coming\nfrom different cultures.\nRelating School-LevelValues to Other School Characteristics.The\nschool-level value scores of each school in each value were\ncorrelated with school-level characteristics of these schools,\nincluding the climate in the school and the level of violence\nprevalent in it. Harmony values, that emphasize smooth\ninterpersonal relations, correlated meaningfully with the rat-\nings of students of the support they received from teachers, r\n= .50, p < .01, and with the ratings of students' participation\nin decision making, r = .43, p < .01, controlling for ethnic\ndifferences.\nNext, we related school-level values to school violence.\nAn unexpected finding emerged with achievement values\ncorrelating positively (controlling for ethnic differences)\nwith school violence as indicated by adolescents' reports of\nperpetration, r = .52, p < .01; the violence of their two best\nfriends, r = .52, p < .01; and reports of victimization, r = .40,\nWe were interested in the potential predictive power of\ncompliance and dominance. Although neither of these values\ncorrelated with school violence, we reasoned that their com-\nbination may predict violence. Specifically, a school in\nwhich compliance values are not important and at the same\ntime dominance is very important is likely to have the high-\nest degree of violence, because individuals in this context\nwill strive to obtain power and control over others (high\ndominance) with little regard for rules, norms, and laws (low\ncompliance). We ranked schools as either high or low in\nthese two values, based on them being, respectively, above or\nbelow the median of schools of the same ethnic sector. We\nthen ran a MANCOVA with ethnic school system as the\ncovariate.\nFigure 3 presents the mean violence levels (using the\nthree indices of violence) for schools high or low in compli-\nance and dominance. The multivariate test showed that nei-\n= 1.25, ns, had a significant main effect on school violence.\nHowever, the two values interacted in predicting violence\nvalues were high in importance but compliance values low\nstood out as highest in violence, regardless of whether it was\nindexed by adolescents' reports of perpetration, F(1, 27) =\nDiscussion\nThe study found meaningful clusters of values at the school\nlevel. These values were mostly similar to the nation-level\nFigure 2. Replicating the school-level value structure in Arab\nand Jewish schools.\nNote: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) figures were obtained separately for\nthe two groups and manually combined for comparative purposes.\nTable 2. Ethnic Differences in School-Level Value Importance (Study 1).\nValue\nJewish schools Arab schools\nDaniel et al. 9\nvalues identified in previous research (Schwartz, 1999,\n2008): dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitarianism,\nautonomy, and achievement. The values of embeddedness\nwere not distinguished as a meaningful value at the school\nlevel. The order of the values at the culture level, but not at\nthe overall level, resembled the hypothesized structure. The\ndifference may stem from the high importance assigned by\nArab adolescents, relative to Jewish adolescents, to both har-\nmony and achievement values, resulting in high correlation\nbetween the values at the school level. The cross-cultural\nsimilarity in the value structure supports the validity of the\nresults. The meaningful relationships with other variables\nsuch as teacher support and school violence suggest that\nthese values may be important variables to be pursued in fur-\nther research.\nHowever, the first study had two main weaknesses. First,\nwe relied on data from a limited number of students within\neach school to characterize the whole school. Moreover, the\nsampling of the adolescents within each school was not ran-\ndom, particularly in the Arab sample. Although more than\n800 students participated and every data point is based on at\nleast 15 students, it would be preferable to see whether the\nresults could be replicated with larger samples.\nSecond, although the Arab and Jewish school systems in\nIsrael are different in many respects, they are still nested\nwithin the same context, and managed by the same Ministry\nof Education. A replication in a different cultural and educa-\ntional context is therefore needed.\nMost importantly, we have assumed that aggregated stu-\ndents' values could represent the values of the school.\nHowever, teachers influence school culture to a large extent,\nand they may have substantially different values. A study\nwith data from students and teachers is needed to see whether\nthe value priorities of the schools are shared by teachers and\nstudents, and to check for mean-level differences between\nthese two school subpopulations.\nIn Study 2, our first question was whether the value typology\nand structure found would be replicated within schools\nnested in a European context. Our second question dealt with\nwhether Study 1 results were unique to student reports. We\naddressed it with data from students and teachers, using a\nlarge number of students in each school. A replication of the\nvalue structure provided by student and teacher data would\nprovide support for the proposed value dimensions.\nThe third question dealt with a different kind of replica-\ntion. Not only did we look at the structure of values for stu-\ndents and teachers but we also looked at whether the values\nof each specific school were similar, regardless of whether\nthey were measured with student data or with teacher data. In\nother words, we expected the meaningful school value\ndimensions to be reflected in substantial positive correlations\nbetween the school-level values of students and teachers,\nreflecting the unique culture of the school.\nSimilarly, we wanted to compare the value priorities of\nyounger and older students, and to see whether the same val-\nues are shared by school members of different ages. High\npositive correlations across schools between the importance\ngiven to each value by younger and older students would\nsupport the validity of our findings.\nMethod\nParticipants.The study was conducted with students (5th-\nfrom eight different high schools in central Europe (six Ger-\nman schools, one international school in Germany, and one\ninternational school in the Czech Republic). Students' age\nof the students were Germans, 28% were of other nationali-\nties. In addition, teachers from six of these schools (n = 163:\n82 females, 78 males, and 3 unknown) participated as well.\nProcedure. The eight schools were located by sending letters\nto approximately 35 high schools asking the principals\nwhether they would be willing to allow their students to par-\nticipate in the study. Depending on the requirements of each\nschool, in some of the schools, we administered the question-\nnaires class by class; in others, they were handed out and\nfilled in during school assembly time. Teachers' question-\nnaires were administered when permission was granted (six\nschools).\nFigure 3. Mean violence level (violence perpetration,\nvictimization, and friends' violence) of schools by their level of\ncompliance and dominance values.\nMaterials. As in Study 1, all participants filled in a question-\nnaire which, in addition to basic variables such as sex and\nage, measured their values using the PVQ (Schwartz et al.,\ncross-cultural replication for the purposes of this study. The\nsame standardization procedures as in Study 1 were used. We\nthen averaged the scores of all students available from each\nschool to form an aggregated school-level score. Similarly,\nin the six schools in which teacher data were available, we\naggregated teachers' scores. We performed all analyses on\nthese transformed and aggregated data.\nResults\nReplication of the School-Level Value Structure Using Student\nData. We ran an MDS on the school-level scores, using the\nALSCAL procedure, with students' data across eight schools,\nand the same 27 items identified in Study 1. Figure 4 pres-\nents the structure obtained in this MDS. The structure from\nthe European schools replicated almost perfectly the Israeli\nstructure, and the stress was .03 that represents an excellent\nrepresentation (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). For five of the six\nvalues, all items clustered together as in Study 1 (Figure 1).\nOne minor exception was the location of harmony values,\nwhich were located in front of compliance values, instead of\nbeside it, as in the separate cultures in Israel. In spite of this\nrelatively small deviation, and considering the small number\nof schools (n = 8), Study 2 provides a very good replication\nof Study 1's results. This assertion is based on the standards\nprovided by Schwartz and Sagiv (1995) for cross-cultural\ncomparison of value structures.\nReplicating the Value Structure with Teacher Data.We next\nasked whether the structure obtained would replicate using\nteacher and student samples. We averaged the items belong-\ning to each value domain to scores representing the six val-\nues and ran an ALSCAL analysis, as described before,\nseparately for students across eight schools and for teachers\nin six schools (Stress 1 = .03 for students and .05 for teach-\ners). Plotting the resulting structure in Figure 5, the structure\nwas very similar for the two groups, with the values similarly\nordered (going from the middle left, clockwise): dominance,\ncompliance, harmony, egalitarianism, autonomy, and\nachievement. The similar structure for teachers and students\nprovides further support to the school value classification we\npropose. In addition, the structure is very similar to the one\nfound in the analysis of the two separate Israeli samples,\nwhich provides a second cross-cultural replication.\nConsistency of School Values across Student Age Groups and\nbetween Students and Teachers.The large student samples\nobtained within each school enabled us to test the issue of\nreplicability of the findings with different age groups\nattending the same school. If school values, as argued, are\ncommon to some extent to most school members (allowing\nfor individual differences), then the value priorities of\nteachers as well as younger (ages 11-15) and older (ages\n16-20) students within the same school should correlate\npositively and significantly. In other words, when aggre-\ngated school-level scores taken from teachers and students\nof different ages correlate positively, this provides evidence\nfor meaningful cross-schools variability that is shared by\nschool members, be they older students, younger students,\nor teachers. We tested this hypothesis using cross-schools\ncorrelations for each value between the priorities given to it\nby younger and older students, aggregated within each\nschool. The hypothesis was supported by the school-level\nFigure 4. Value structure at the school level: MDS using school\nmeans, European student data.\nNote: MDS = multidimensional scaling.\nFigure 5. Replicating the school-level value structure in student\nand teacher European schools.\nNote: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) figures were obtained separately for\nthe two groups and manually combined for comparative purposes.\ncorrelations presented in Table 3. Positive correlations were\nfound for all six values (although the correlation for har-\nmony was not significant, r = .32).\nA further test of our findings was whether teachers and\nstudents at each school have similar values. In other words,\nif the value priorities of teachers and students in the same\nschool correlate highly positively, this would indicate that\nschool values as conceptualized and measured here do repre-\nsent the values of each school, regardless of whether they\nhave been obtained with teacher or student data. Moreover, it\nwould support the idea that school values are a construct rel-\nevant to school members of different ranks. This is the case,\nas demonstrated by school-level correlations of each value\nacross the six schools between students and teachers (Table\n3). Across schools, teachers' and students' aggregated values\ncorrelated strongly (minimal r = .76, maximal r = .96). The\ncorrelations between teachers' scores and students' scores\nwere somewhat higher for the older students (average r =\n.85) than for the younger students (average r = .75).\nInterestingly, although students' and teachers' compliance\nvalues correlated very highly (r = .96, p < .01) across schools,\nDiscussion\nAlthough the number of schools in Study 2 was relatively\nsmall, the number of individual students in each school was\nlarge (192.6 on average), and thus school values could be\nmeasured reliably. The results of Study 2 replicated the value\ntypology and structure found in Study 1 and extended them\nto a third cultural context. Furthermore, the results showed\nthat school values as assessed here are common to different\nschool subpopulations: teachers, older students, and younger\nstudents.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis study proposes and tests a typology of school-level val-\nues. Results from three cultural contexts all point to the\nexistence of the same six values. MDS analyses of the value\nscores find that the order of the values is consistent across\nvalue domains: dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitari-\nanism, autonomy, and achievement. In Germany, the sub-\nstantial correlations between students of different ages and\nteachers in Study 2 supported the validity of the findings, and\nthe behavioral correlates of values (school violence, support\nfor students, and participation in decision making) demon-\nstrated the importance of studying school-level values as a\npotential precursor of other school characteristics.\nSchool-Level Value Content\nSchools are groups of individuals that work together to pro-\nmote group and individual goals. We therefore expected\nschools to differ across the three value dimensions that define\nthe solutions which groups in general give to three issues:\nembeddedness versus autonomy, hierarchy versus egalitari-\nThis expectation was partly supported, as each of the\nthree issues was represented in the school-level values we\nidentified--autonomy, dominance and compliance (repre-\nsenting hierarchy), egalitarianism and harmony. However,\nthe value of embeddedness, which distinguishes among\nnational cultures, did not emerge as important in distinguish-\ning among schools; and mastery values took a unique form\nof achievement values when distinguishing among schools.\nWe will next discuss the similarities and differences between\nthe national-level and the school-level value dimensions.\nThe embeddedness-autonomy dimension is represented\nby autonomy values in this study, promoting openness to\nintellectual experiences and the importance of behavioral\nchoice. Thus, schools differ in how much they consider it\nimportant that individuals are autonomous (see also\nSchulte et al., 2002). One way further investigations of this\nvalue could go is to study the tightness versus looseness\n(Gelfand et al., 2011) of rules and codes at schools. For\nexample, it is possible that in high-autonomy schools, the\ndress code of students (and teachers) will be more flexible\nthan in low-autonomy schools. In these schools, parental\nschool involvement (Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002) may also\nTable 3. Correlations Between Teachers, Younger (Ages 11-15), and Older (Ages 16-20) Students in School-Level Value Importance\n(Study 2).\nValue\nYounger and older\nstudents Teachers and students\nYounger students and\nteachers\nOlder students and\nteachers\nbe higher than in schools in which autonomy is not highly\nimportant. These schools can also stress students' curiosity\nand personal responsibility for studies more than other\nIt is interesting to note that a clear embeddedness region\nhad not emerged in any of the studies. Embedded cultures are\nthose that expect meaning in life to come largely through\nsocial relationships, through identifying with the group, par-\nticipating in its shared way of life, and striving toward its\nshared goals. It is possible that the importance of embedded-\nness values is largely derived from the national or ethnic cul-\nture, or from the family system, and schools do not create\ntheir unique atmosphere of embeddedness. Thus, schools\ncannot be distinguished by their embeddedness values.\nThe hierarchy-egalitarianism dimension is represented\nby dominance values, that emphasize striving to reach the\ntop of the social ladder, and compliance values, that empha-\nsize acceptance of one's role in the social hierarchy system.\nIn high-dominance schools, a more differentiated status sys-\ntem is expected as compared with low-dominance schools.\nSchools that have a relatively formalized, centralized, and\nwell-established system of superordinate\u00adsubordinate rela-\ntionships (Pang, 1996), for example, between teachers and\nstudents or between older and younger students, are likely to\nbe those in which dominance values are relatively impor-\ntant. In high-compliance schools, acceptance of the rules\nand following them are likely to be emphasized. The inter-\naction between compliance and dominance values in pre-\ndicting school violence emphasizes also the importance of\nstudying the joint contributions of different values to school-\nlevel behaviors.\nIt is interesting to note that dominance and compliance\nemerged as distinct in the present studies, in contrast to\nnational cultures, in which the values were intermixed. This\nmay point to the highly hierarchical system of schools in\nwhich the roles of students and teachers are defined and\ndifferentiated.\nEgalitarianism values were also found to form a clear\nregion in the present study. The role of cooperation and amity\ngoals in achievement setting such as school is being increas-\ningly acknowledged (Doyle Lynch et al., 2012; Levontin &\nBardi, 2012). Future studies should examine the relation-\nships between the importance given in schools to collegial-\nity, mutual support (Higgins-D'Alessandro & Sadh, 1997;\nvalues, and school climate and success. The role of school-\nlevel egalitarianism values in predicting out-of-school proso-\ncial behaviors such as volunteering should also be\ninvestigated.\nHarmony values represent one end of the mastery-\nharmony dimension. In the school context, they promote\ninterpersonal consideration and the smooth interaction\nbetween members of the social group. Accordingly, they\nwere found to relate meaningfully to teacher support and to\nstudent participation in decision making in Israeli high\nschools. The involvement of students and teachers in high-\nharmony schools is also likely to relate to attitudes toward\nout-group members, because harmony values emphasize a\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\nBecause schools give different emphases to reaching high\nacademic standards (Pang, 1996), we proposed a school-\nlevel value dimension of achievement. In support of this\nhypothesis, a clear achievement value domain emerged in\nboth studies. The notion that the amount of reinforcement\nand incentives for high academic standards (Pang, 1996) is\npredicted by schools' achievement values should be investi-\ngated in further research. Achievement values at the school\nlevel may provide a clue as to why some schools are com-\npetitive and others less so. It can also point to the source of\ndifferences between schools in the motivation of students\nand their achievements.\nThe Interactive Relationships among School\nValues\nThe values found to distinguish among schools can form a\nsystem of preferences characterized by the contradictions\nand compatibilities among them. Egalitarianism and auton-\nomy are related positively because they share a view of the\nsocial actor as an autonomous entity. Achievement values\nrelate positively to autonomy values, because they both pre-\nsume that changing the status quo is legitimate and desired,\nand they both emphasize activity and assuming control over\none's fate. Achievement values are also linked to dominance\nvalues because the aspiration to be first and get ahead is often\nat the expense of others, and can result in unequal allocation\nof roles and resources (Schwartz, 1999). Dominance and\ncompliance values are compatible as they both legitimize the\nunequal distribution of power within a society that can be\nexpressed by either assuming a dominant or a subordinate\nrole. Compliance values are compatible with harmony val-\nues, as they share the emphasis on not disturbing the social or\ngeneral status quo. Last, harmony values stand in line with\negalitarianism values as they both emphasize fit into the\nsocial environment rather than controlling it and benefiting\nHarmony values, which emphasize the fit within the\nsocial world, stand in contrast to achievement values that\nemphasize getting ahead and succeeding more than others.\nEgalitarianism values, stressing equality among individuals,\nstand in contrast to dominance and compliance values that\nemphasize legitimization of the social hierarchy (Schwartz,\nThe structure of the school-level value system showed\none difference between the studies. In each culture indepen-\ndently in Study 1, and in Study 2, the order of the values was\nas follows: dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitarian-\nism, autonomy, and achievement. In Study 1, when collaps-\ning both cultures, the order was different, with harmony\nvalues adjacent to dominance and achievement values. This\norder is less theoretically reasonable, and may have resulted\nfrom cultural differences in value importance, with Arab\nschools emphasizing harmony and achievement values more\nthan Jewish schools, creating a spurious correlation between\nthe values.\nSchool Values and their Relevance to Different\nSchool Members\nThe finding of substantial school-level correlations in the\nimportance given to the values in Study 2 points to school\nvalues as a construct that is relevant to individuals of differ-\nent ranks and positions within the school system. This does\nnot preclude, however, the possibility of average differences\nbetween different groups within the same school. The higher\nimportance given by teachers as compared with students to\ncompliance may well reflect the different roles and statuses\nthat teachers and students have at schools, or the different\nages and stages in life of teachers and students. Such mean\ndifferences are an important path for future research, prefer-\nably with a larger number of schools.\nThe teacher\u00adstudent correlations were positive for all val-\nues but extremely high for compliance (r = .96) and egalitari-\nanism (r = .93) values. One possibility is that school policies\nthat affect students and teachers affect the importance of\nthese values similarly for both groups. Alternatively, values\nhighly relevant to interpersonal behavior, such as being hum-\nble, modest, and obedient (compliance), and caring, helpful,\nand loyal (egalitarianism), may have a mirroring effect\nbetween students and teachers. In schools in which these val-\nues are highly important to teachers, relevant behaviors are\nmodeled to students and affect the values of the latter.\nAlthough the current design cannot address directly the\nissue of teacher influence, the comparison between age\ngroups is telling. The correlations between teachers' and stu-\ndents' values tended to be stronger for the older students.\nThis may imply a socialization effect, in which as students\nremain at school, their values become increasingly similar to\nthose of their teachers. Another suggestion may be of an age\neffect, as older students acquire adult-like value priorities\nand are thus becoming increasingly similar to their teachers.\nStudy Strengths and Limitations\nThe study has several methodological strengths. First, the\nstudent samples were large. Second, three very different cul-\ntural contexts were studied, providing a replication of the\nvalue structure in a predominantly Christian context\n(Europe), as well as predominantly Muslim (Israeli Arabs)\nand Jewish (Israeli Jews) contexts. The replication of the\nvalue structure in these three contexts suggests that the\nschool values identified in this study may apply across a\nwide range of cultural contexts. The similar meaning\nof values across cultures is a precondition for meaningful\ncross-cultural comparisons of value importance (see\nSchwartz, 1992). A replication of the results in additional\ncultural contexts, such as North America, South America,\nand Africa, can add to the understanding of school values.\nAlthough using a variety of schools, the study investi-\ngates a limited number of schools. In particular, running an\nMDS with a large number of variables and a relatively small\nnumber of schools is a limitation, although each school-level\ndata point represents groups of 15 individuals or more.\nReplicating the results using a wider school sample will\nstrengthen the robustness of the results.\nAnother strength of the study lies in the comparison of\nteachers and students of different ages in Study 2. The large\npositive correlations across schools in the importance given\nto these values by different subpopulations of the schools\nincrease our confidence in the findings. However, the large\nschool samples reached in Study 2 limited the number of\nschools in which students of different ages and teachers\ncould be asked to participate. Study 1 had a much larger\nnumber of schools but with a limited number of students in\neach. Although each study's advantages compensate for the\nother's limitation, there is still need for a study with a large\nnumber of students and teachers, nested in a substantial num-\nber of schools.\nThe present study extends beyond identifying school\nvalue dimensions to show the relevance of the values to\nimportant school characteristics. We have demonstrated that\nsuch meaningful relationships exist with teacher support and\nschool violence. Future studies can pursue many other pos-\nsible relations, such as the relations between school values,\nschool performance, and drop-out rates.\nAnother possible limitation is the reliance mainly on data\nfrom students. This is the reason for the inclusion of teacher\ndata in Study 2. Across six schools, student\u00adteacher correla-\ntions were positive and large. In addition, the value structure\nobtained from teachers' data was very similar to that of stu-\ndents (Figure 5). Nevertheless, future studies should seek to\ninclude other members of the school community, such as\nprincipals and nonteaching staff, in addition to students and\nteachers.\nThe measure we used in this study for assessing values,\nthe PVQ (Schwartz & Rubel, 2005), has been designed spe-\ncifically for comparing samples of a broad range of educa-\ntional levels and ages. This is one reason we relied on it when\nstudying the values of adolescents and preadolescents, and\ncomparing them with those of adults. However, it should be\nnoted that this questionnaire was devised for studying the\nvalues of individuals, not of schools. It would be beneficial\nin future research to test the typology we obtained from the\naggregated individual responses, this time with a specifically\ndesigned measure that directly addresses the values of\nschools.\nConclusion\nStudies in three cultures pointed out the replicability of the\nsix value types, largely shared by school members of differ-\nent groups. The typology reported in this article should guide\nfuture research into the phenomenon of school values. The\nrelevance of the values to variables such as ethnicity and\nschool violence demonstrates the importance of studying\nschool-level values.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nfrom the German-Israeli Foundation for Research and Development\nto the last author.\nNote\n1.
