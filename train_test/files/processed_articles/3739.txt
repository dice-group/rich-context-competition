    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic agent acting as an L-type calcium\nchannel antagonist in intestinal and colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We analyzed\nthree independent clinical trials with homogeneous design on patients with irritable bowel\nsyndrome (IBS). After 2 weeks receiving placebo, patients were randomized to receive OB (3 \u00d7\n40 mg daily) or placebo for 15 weeks. We aimed to perform a pooled analysis of the data from\nthese homogeneous clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of OB treatment on symptoms and\nglobal response of patients.\ntype) were included, 442 treated with OB and 441 with placebo. The efficacy results from\nthe three studies at weeks 5, 10 and 15 were pooled in an intention-to-treat (ITT) strategy,\nanalyzed with a logistic regression model and described by forest plots.\nResults: Despite a placebo effect in all efficacy variables, a significant therapeutic effect of OB\nwas observed at weeks 10 and 15 with reference to: (a) intensity and frequency of abdominal\n(c) severity of bloating; (d) rate of responders as evaluated by physicians (55% at week 10 and\n63.9% at week 15). No significant OB effect was observed in stool frequency and consistency.\nConclusions: OB is more effective than placebo in IBS treatment. Therapeutic benefits are\nsignificant after 10 weeks and are maximal after 15 weeks of treatment.\n",

In addition to the impact on patient's\nhealth, IBS is also associated with impaired qual-\nity of life, diminished work productivity and\nincreased health and economic costs [Agarwal\nand Spiegel, 2011]. Although there is consensus\non the application of clinical Rome Criteria to\ndiagnose IBS and its subtypes [Longstreth et al.\nnosed [Hungin et al. 2003]. In addition, there is a\nlack of consensus on IBS treatment in terms of\noptimal pharmacological treatment, most useful\ndrugs, specific indications for spasmolytic agents,\ntiming of clinical response and duration of\ntreatment.\nOtilonium Bromide (OB) is a musculotropic spas-\nmolytic agent belonging to the family of quater-\nnary ammonium derivatives and successfully used\nin the treatment of patients affected by IBS due to\nits specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\nnamic properties. The positive polarity of the head\nof the OB molecule determines the main pharma-\ncokinetic property of this drug: a minimal systemic\nabsorption and the consequently high safety pro-\nfile. Studies on animal models revealed a specific\nOB accumulation in colonic circular muscle at\ntherapeutic \u00b5m concentrations, while its plasma\nlevels were 1000 times lower, together with a poor\npenetration of the drug in the central nervous\nEfficacy of otilonium bromide in irritable\nbowel syndrome: a pooled analysis\nPere Clav\u00e9 and Jan Tack\n Keywords: abdominal pain, bloating, distention, global response, intention-to-treat analysis,\nirritable bowel syndrome, otilonium bromide\nCorrespondence to:\nPere Clav\u00e9, MD, PhD\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n\nBiom\u00e9dica en Red de\nEnfermedades Hep\u00e1ticas\ny Digestivas (CIBERehd),\nHospital de Matar\u00f3,\nUniversitat Aut\u00f2noma de\nBarcelona, C/ Cirera s/n,\npere.clave@ciberehd.org\nJan Tack, MD, PhD\nTranslational Research\nCenter for Gastrointestinal\nDisorders (TARGID),\nUniversity of Leuven,\nBelgium\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology,\nUniversity Hospital\nGasthuisberg, Leuven,\nBelgium\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(3)\n312 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nsystem [Evangelista et al. 2000]. Consistently, after\noral administration to healthy volunteers, the OB\nplasmatic concentration was very low, <1% of the\ndrug was eliminated by urine, and 97% was elimi-\nRecent clinical studies showed comparable safety\nand tolerability for OB and placebo [Clave et al.\n2011]. OB was shown to inhibit the main patterns\nof human sigmoid motility in vitro, including: the\ntone of smooth muscle cells (SMCs); the rhyth-\nmic phasic contractions induced by the interstitial\ncells of Cajal; and the strong contractions induced\nby stimulation of enteric motor neurons mainly\nby blocking the calcium influx through L-type\ncalcium channels on SMCs [Gallego et al. 2010].\nRecent in vitro studies using cultured human\ncolonic SMCs to further assess the musculotropic\nspasmolytic properties of OB confirmed that this\ndrug causes smooth muscle relaxation through\nthe inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels\n(L-type > T-type) and the inhibition of mus-\ncarinic and tachykinergic effects [Martinez-\nCutillas et al. 2013]. All the above described\npharmacodynamic properties mediate the muscu-\nlotropic spasmolytic effects of OB. In addition, its\ninteraction with the NK1/NK2 tachykinergic\nreceptors in sensory afferent nerves may also\nimprove the visceral hypersensitivity that affects\npatients with IBS [Rychter et al. 2014].\nWe included in the present analysis three rand-\nomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies\nwith a homogeneous treatment schedule of 3 \u00d7\n40 mg OB daily for 15 weeks to measure the clini-\ncal efficacy of OB in patients with IBS. The first\nstudy was conducted in 23 Italian centers, and\nenrolled 325 patients with IBS [Battaglia et al.\ners in eight European countries and enrolled 355\npatients with IBS [Clave et al. 2011]; the third\nstudy was conducted in Greece and enrolled 203\npatients with IBS [Menarini IFR, 2012]. In all\nthese studies, OB improved the main symptoms of\npatients with IBS, mostly related to abdominal\npain. Drawbacks included the difficult translation\nof results to clinical practice for both patients and\nphysicians due to the long-term primary endpoints\n(15 weeks), the need to define a global treatment\nresponse on the basis of improvements in the most\nfrequent symptoms reported by patients and a strict\nintention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and the relevant\nIn the current analysis, we collected the individ-\nual data from the three homogeneous rand-\nomized controlled trials (RCTs) described above\nIFR, 2012] and performed a pooled analysis, with\nthe aim of evaluating the efficacy of OB treatment\non the main IBS symptoms (including intensity\nand frequency of abdominal pain, severity of\nbloating, stool frequency and consistency), and\nthe global treatment response assessed by patients\nand by their physicians. The results of the pooled\nanalysis support the significant therapeutic effect\nof OB versus placebo, thus providing additional\nresearch-based data to guide clinical practice in\nIBS management.\nMethods\nStudies and patients\nA total of 889 patients with IBS were enrolled in\nthree independent RCTs [Battaglia et al. 1998;\ndetail, the study by Battaglia and colleagues evalu-\nated the efficacy of OB by comparing 158 patients\ntreated with the study drug versus 158 patients\nreceiving a placebo (study code in the pooled anal-\nysis: Battaglia) [Battaglia et al. 1998]. The primary\nobjective of the OBIS study was to confirm the\nefficacy of OB for symptom control in patients\nwith IBS in a superiority trial versus placebo by\ncomparing 169 patients receiving the study drug\nversus 170 patients receiving a placebo (study code\nin the pooled analysis: OBIS) [Clave et al. 2011].\nThe third study was conducted in Greece and\nevaluated the efficacy of OB by comparing 88\npatients with IBS treated with the study drug ver-\nsus 96 patients receiving a placebo (study code in\nthe pooled analysis: Greek) [Menarini IFR, 2012].\nThe inclusion/exclusion criteria and the design\n(RCT, OB versus placebo) of the three studies\nwere homogeneous and included: (a) age > 18\nyears; (b) exclusion of major organic disease in\npatients with age >50 years; (c) a positive diagno-\nsis of IBS established using similar clinical criteria\n(Rome I in the Battaglia and the Greek studies\nand Rome II in the OBIS study) [Thompson\net al. 1999]; (d) after a run-in period of 2 weeks of\nsingle blind placebo treatment, mild-to-severe\nsymptomatic IBS patients were randomized to\nreceive treatment in a double-blinded manner:\nOB, 3 tablets (3 \u00d7 40 mg) daily before meals\n(120 mg OB/day) or matching placebo, 3 tablets\ndaily before meals as well, for 15 weeks. Patient\nP Clav\u00e9 and J Tack\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 313\nsymptoms were monitored by means of diaries.\nFollow-up visits were scheduled after 5, 10 and 15\nweeks of treatment.\nEfficacy variables\nThe following efficacy parameters included in this\nanalysis were considered as primary efficacy vari-\nables in the three selected studies [Battaglia et al.\n(1) intensity of abdominal pain as reported by\npatients through a score; (2) intensity of abdomi-\nnal pain evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS)\nas reported by patients; (3) number of episodes of\nabdominal pain as reported by patients; (4) inten-\nsity and frequency of abdominal pain by type of\nIBS; (5) responder patients by global evaluation of\npain as composite parameter of intensity and fre-\nquency scores; (6) stool frequency and consist-\nency; (7) severity of bloating; and (8) responder\npatients as evaluated by the physician.\nIntensity of abdominal pain was assessed by\nadapting the 4-level rating scale, where 0 =\nabsent, 1 = mild/moderate, 2 = severe, and 3 =\nextremely severe, to the three RCTs selected for\nthis analysis.\nWeekly frequency of episodes of abdominal pain\nwas assessed by adapting the 4-level rating scale\nepisodes and 3 = 8 or more episodes during the\nweek to the three RCTs selected for this analysis.\nAs a global measure of treatment response, a\ncomposite pain score (global evaluation of pain\nas composite parameter of intensity of pain and\nepisodes of pain as reported by patients) was\ncalculated for this study as: abdominal pain score\n\u00d7 score for episodes of pain.\nSeverity of bloating was scored using a scale\nwhere 0 = absent; 1 = mild-to-moderate; 2 =\nsevere; and 3 = extremely severe.\nIntensity, frequency and global evaluation of\nabdominal pain and severity of bloating were\nrecorded in a diary for 2 weeks before randomiza-\ntion. The worst score recorded during the 2 weeks\nwas used as the baseline score for further analysis.\nDuring the follow up, the scores were recorded in\nthe diary every week. The score recorded in the\nlast week before the follow-up visit was used for\nthe analysis.\nFollow-up data were analyzed in an ITT analysis.\nResponders with regards to intensity, frequency,\nglobal evaluation of pain as a composite index of\nintensity and frequency, or severity of distention,\nwere defined as patients having a reduction of\nThe intensity of abdominal pain was also reported\nby patients using a VAS at baseline and at the end\nof treatment.\nThe stool frequency was measured by the number\nof days without stools and the average number of\nstools in the remaining days of the week reported\nby patients. The latter was evaluated by a four-\nlevel scale where: 0 = 1 per day; 1 = 2 per day; 2\n= 3 or 4 per day; and 3 = 5 or more per day.\nResults on stool consistency reported by patients\nwere transformed into a dichotomous variable,\nwhere: 0 = normal consistency and 1 = abnormal\nconsistency (either loose or hard).\nResponders were also examined according to the\nglobal efficacy assessment evaluated by the physi-\ncian using a 4-point score at each visit after rand-\nomization: 0 = no efficacy; 1 = moderate efficacy;\n2 = good efficacy; and 3 = excellent efficacy.\nResponders were defined as patients showing\ngood or excellent improvement in the global eval-\nuation by the physician.\nThe efficacy analysis was based on an ITT popu-\nlation analysis. The full analysis set (FAS, ITT\npopulation) included all randomized patients\nwho had taken at least one dose of the study drug\nand had undergone at least one efficacy assess-\nment for the primary efficacy endpoint (evalua-\ntion of the diaries) after baseline.\nMethods for the pooled analysis\nAll the efficacy data derived from the three stud-\nies were reported individually per study and as\nweighted averages taking into account the num-\nber of patients enrolled in each study. First, an\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the\ndirect comparison between treatment groups,\nand then a general linear model (GLM) was used\nfor the comparisons in which an impact of covari-\nates was expected. Data were statistically ana-\nlyzed using the analysis of covariance, including\nbaseline intensity, sex, age, body mass index\n(BMI) as covariates and treatment as factor. The\nGLM was used to compare the efficacy parame-\nters between the treatment groups considering\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(3)\n314 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nthe model baseline values of each parameter, age,\nsex and BMI as covariates. The GLM procedure\nprovides regression analysis and ANOVA for one\ndependent variable (efficacy parameter) by more\nfactors (treatment group and sex) and covariates\n(baseline values, age and BMI).\nThe same method used for the analysis of the\nend-of-treatment data (week 15) was applied to\nthe data obtained at the intermediate visits (weeks\nSeverity of pain assessed by VAS was analyzed\nusing ANOVA performed on changes from base-\nline to the end of treatment.\nFrequency tables were completed at each relevant\ntime point for the rate of responders. Treatment\nresponders were analyzed using a binary logistic\nregression model including factors for treatment.\nFor an exploratory subgroup analysis, the follow-\ning three subgroups were defined according to\nthe IBS type: predominant diarrhea (IBS-D),\npredominant constipation (IBS-C), mixed type\n(IBS-M) [Thompson et al. 1999; Longstreth et al.\n2006]. The same descriptive statistics on change\nfrom baseline in the frequency of abdominal pain\nfor the whole population were provided in the\nFAS, stratifying by subgroup category.\nResults were also represented through forest\nplots, designed to illustrate the relative strength of\ntreatment effects in multiple quantitative studies\naddressing the same question. The vertical line in\na forest plot corresponds to lack of effect. If the\nconfidence intervals (CIs) for individual studies\ndo not overlap with this line, it demonstrates that,\nat the given level of confidence (95%), their effect\nsizes differ from no effect. The same applies for\nthe pooled measure of effect (pooled dataset): if\nthe CI for the pooled dataset does not overlap\nwith the vertical line corresponding to lack of\neffect, the overall result of pooled analysis differs\nfrom no effect at the 95% level of confidence.\nThe analysis was performed in SAS (version 9.02,\nSAS Institute Inc, Raleigh, NC, USA).\nResults\nDemographic data of patients included in the\npooled analysis\nThe patient population recruited in the three\nRCTs selected for the pooled analysis of the data\nconsisted of 883 patients of both sexes, with a\nprevalence of women (69.8%), and a median age\nof 46.2 years, as summarized in Table 1. No sig-\nnificant differences were observed between the\ntwo treatment groups with respect to demo-\ngraphic data in the three studies.

No differences in baseline clinical fea-\ntures were observed between OB and placebo\ngroups (Table 1).

The second finding\nof the pooled analysis is related to the timing of\nthe therapeutic benefit of OB compared with pla-\ncebo: for most of the efficacy variables, the spe-\ncific improvement that can be attributed to OB\nstarted after 10 weeks of treatment and was\nmaximal and stable until the end of treatment\nThe results from this pooled analysis are sup-\nported by the strength of its design, with three\nindependent but homogeneous studies, an ITT\nanalysis, a rigorous assessment of the placebo\neffect, equal dropout rates, global efficacy out-\ncomes evaluated by patients and physicians, and\nthe statistical approach, which included a binary\nlogistic regression model and forest plots. The\nrationale for the specific inclusion of the Battaglia,\nthe OBIS and the Greek studies in the pooled\nanalysis is that they are RCTs with the same\nexperimental design, including a total of 883\npatients, thus providing a large study population\nto evaluate the efficacy of OB treatment versus\nplacebo on the main symptoms and global\nresponse of patients with IBS.\nThis analysis includes some unpublished data,\noriginating from a RCT conducted in Greece and\nfiled by a local pharmaceutical company that pro-\nduced the drug. The results of the unpublished\n(Greek) study are similar to those obtained in the\nother studies (Battaglia and OBIS) included in\nthis analysis (Figure 2a and 2b) and, in some\ncases, worse than those reported in the OBIS\nstudy in reference to the frequency of abdominal\npain, the global composite score of pain, and the\nresponder rates. Overall, our results show OB\ntreatment is globally effective in a representative\npopulation of patients with mild-to-severe IBS of\ndifferent subtypes, further supporting its intro-\nduction to clinical practice.\nOB has specific pharmacodynamic characteris-\ntics, allowing it to counteract the increased pain\nsensitivity and the impaired small bowel and\ncolon motility that characterize IBS [Drossman\net al. 2002]. Visceral hypersensitivity is associated\nwith the intensity of abdominal pain, while\nimpaired colonic motility (hypercontractility,\nhyperreactivity and increased tone) is associated\nwith frequency of pain episodes and with impaired\nbowel habits [Kanazawa et al. 2008]. Patients\nwith IBS are thought to present abdominal pain\nfollowing stimulation of sensitive nerve endings\nlocated in the intestinal wall by strong tonic or\nphasic intestinal contractions in a context of low\nFigure 6.

The mechanisms of action\nof OB in colonic muscle cells, colonic motility\npatterns and primary afferent neurons have been\nrecently revised [Rychter et al. 2014]. Studies\ndemonstrated a reduction in visceral sensitivity to\nrectal balloon distention in IBS patients following\ntreatment with OB [Baldi et al. 1992; Czimmer\net al. 2001]. The combined action of OB on nor-\nmalization of exaggerated motility patterns and\ninhibition of primary afferent nociceptors proba-\nbly underlies the strong therapeutic effects of this\ndrug on frequency and intensity of abdominal\npain in IBS patients.\nThe first observation resulting from this pooled\nanalysis is the relevant placebo effect observed in\nall efficacy variables, increasing from the begin-\nning of treatment with a proportion of placebo\nresponders with regards to the global evaluation\nto week 15. This effect is well known in IBS stud-\nies. For example, it was measured previously in a\nmeta-analysis of 45 placebo-controlled studies\nand found to be highly variable, ranging from\n2005]. Slightly higher rates of placebo response\nwere also observed in the OBIS study [Clave et al.\n2011] and were attributed to the entry criteria of\nthe study, which included patients with severe\nIBS symptoms and hence with a greater chance\nfor spontaneous improvement, considering the\ncyclic nature of IBS.\nThe second relevant result from our pooled analy-\nsis is the strong therapeutic effect of OB, greater\nthan the placebo response in almost all the primary\nefficacy variables (intensity and frequency of pain,\nbloating and patient response outcomes, such as\nglobal evaluation of pain considering both inten-\nsity and frequency of episodes and VAS, and global\nefficacy evaluated by physicians). A previous meta-\nanalysis by Poynard and colleagues, including four\nancillary clinical studies with OB, also found a sig-\nnificant effect of this drug on the proportion of\npatients showing an improved global assessment\nimprovement in pain and distention at the end of\ntreatment [Poynard et al. 2001]. A meta-analysis\nby Lesbros-Pantoflickova found that when exclud-\ning the low-quality trials, an improvement of\nglobal IBS symptoms with all antispasmodics was\nmaintained only for OB, but on the basis of only\ntwo studies [Lesbros-Pantoflickova et al. 2004].\nFinally, a meta-analysis by Ford and colleagues,\nincluding the same four studies selected by\nPoynard and colleagues, also suggested a benefi-\ncial effect for OB, as symptoms of IBS persisted\nin 51% patients treated with OB and in 71%\npatients treated with placebo [Ford et al. 2008].\nHowever, these last authors underlined a signifi-\ncant heterogeneity among designs and endpoint\nof studies, as the sample size in three studies\nwas small, the duration of treatment varied,\nand the largest trial [Glende et al. 2002] showed\nonly a modest benefit of OB in the rate of\nmonthly responders, corresponding to 11\u00ad14%\n[Desborough and Ford, 2011]. The OBIS study\nincluded in this pooled analysis found an effect of\nOB in the reduction of episodes of abdominal\npain, reduction of abdominal bloating, global effi-\ncacy by patient assessment and protection from\nIBS symptom relapse significantly greater than\nplacebo at the end of the 15-week treatment\nperiod (primary endpoint) [Clave et al. 2011]. In\naddition, safety and tolerability of OB was very\nhigh and similar to placebo, a result consistent\nwith Poynard and colleagues' meta-analysis\nconducted on Asian patients confirmed the effec-\ntiveness of OB in alleviating IBS symptoms\n[Chang et al. 2011]. A recent literature review of\nthe efficacy and tolerability of OB in the long-term\nmanagement of patients with IBS confirmed that\nthis drug reduces abdominal pain and discomfort\nin patients with IBS, exhibiting greater efficacy\nand tolerability than placebo or other similar drugs\n[Triantafillidis and Malgarinos, 2014]. Finally, a\nvery recent study aiming at evaluating the dose-\nOB or placebo administered three times daily for\n4 weeks on functional or clinical efficacy IBS vari-\nables demonstrated that 40 mg and 80 mg of OB\ncan improve individual and global clinical symp-\ntoms of IBS compared with placebo over a 4-week\nperiod [Chmielewska-Wilkon et al. 2014]. Another\nrecent literature review found OB was effective\nalso in comparison with other drugs, such as\npinaverium bromide and mebeverine, with a\nfavorable tolerability profile [Forte et al. 2012].\nOverall, all these studies clearly prove that OB is\nwell tolerated and is able to improve the symp-\ntoms of IBS.\nRecently, the recommendation on primary end-\npoints to be used in trials for IBS has been\nchanged from a co-primary endpoint of global\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(3)\n320 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nassessment and pain to the separate evaluation of\nefficacy on stool-related abnormalities and on\npain [European Medicines Agency, 2014]. In our\npooled analysis, we found that OB improved both\nthe intensity and the frequency of abdominal pain\n(Figure 2). The weak effect of OB administration\non stool frequency and consistency we revealed\ncould be attributed to an over-simplistic dicho-\ntomic analysis (normal/abnormal consistency\ninstead of the specific Bristol scale) as well as to\nthe relevant placebo effect, as the OBIS study\nshowed a slight but significant reduction of stool\nfrequency at the end of the OB treatment [Clave\nIBS is a chronic and relapsing disease with cyclic\nperiods of symptoms and frequent relapses to\nshort [Jones et al. 1999] and long-term treatments\n[Chey et al. 2004]. Antispasmodics are recom-\nmended as first line treatment for IBS patients\nwith pain and bloating as dominant symptoms,\nbut there is no agreement on the type of protocol\nto be selected for treatment (continuous, cyclic or\nintermittent, or `on demand'). Recently, an initial\napproach of 2\u00ad3 months' treatment has been\nshown to be effective in most patients [Evangelista,\nby the relevant therapeutic effect observed at 10\nand 15 weeks in this pooled analysis. However,\nsymptom relapse occurs in up to 50% of IBS\npatients, making cyclic treatment necessary.\nConsequently, only well-tolerated drugs with\nproved effects on the specific relapsing symptoms\nshould be used [Boeckxstaens et al. 2013]. The\nOBIS study revealed that the therapeutic effect of\nOB during the 10-week follow-up period subse-\nquent to the 15-week treatment period remained\ngreater than the effect of placebo in terms of\nrelapse-free probability and withdrawal rate due\nConsidering the results from this pooled analysis\ntogether with the outcomes from previous stud-\nies, we can conclude that OB is well tolerated, has\na strong therapeutic effect on abdominal pain,\nbloating and rate of responders as assessed by\npatients and by physicians, and prevents symp-\ntom relapse. OB has been on the market for over\n30 years in over 40 countries in Europe, Central\nAmerica, Asia (China, India, Pakistan, Korea and\nPhilippines), the Middle East, and Africa (Egypt,\nFrench African countries). Our findings further\nsupport the therapeutic utility of OB in clinical\npractice.\n"
