The metabolic syndrome was determined using the National\nCholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel III) definition modified for age.\nRESULTS -- The overall prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S. adoles-\n0.001). The syndrome was more prevalent (P  0.01) in male than female adolescents (9.1 vs.\n3.7%) and was found in 32.1% of overweight adolescents (BMI 95th percentile for age and\nsex), compared with 7.1% of adolescents at risk for overweight (BMI between 85th and 95th\npercentiles) (P  0.001). Based on population-weighted estimates, 2 million U.S. adolescents\ncurrently have a metabolic syndrome phenotype.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype has increased sig-\nnificantly over the past decade among U.S. adolescents and is particularly prevalent (30%) in\noverweight adolescents. These findings have important implications for public health because of\nthe well-known health risks associated with the metabolic syndrome in adults.\nAn association between obesity, high\nfasting triglycerides, elevated fast-\ning plasma insulin, impaired glu-\ncose tolerance, hypertension, and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) has been\nmajor risk factors tend to cluster together\nin many individuals, suggesting a com-\nmon etiology, which has been variously\ntermed Syndrome X, the insulin resis-\ntance syndrome, and the metabolic syn-\ndrome. The Third Report of the National\nCholesterol Education Program (Adult\nTreatment Panel III [ATP III]) recognized\nthe clustering of these major CVD risk fac-\ntors, which was termed the metabolic\nsyndrome, as a secondary target of risk-\nreduction therapy (1). Current estimates\nindicate that the age-adjusted prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome is roughly\n24% among U.S. adults (2). The meta-\nbolic syndrome is largely confined to\noverweight and obese adults, with preva-\nlence estimates of 22% among adults\namong adults with a BMI 30 kg/m2\n(3). In adults free of diabetes, having the\nmetabolic syndrome independently pre-\ndicts incident type 2 diabetes (4). The\nmetabolic syndrome is also related to an\nincreased risk of all-cause and CVD mor-\ntality in adults with (5) and without (6,7)\ntype 2 diabetes, independent of other risk\nfactors.\nAlthough it has been studied exten-\nsively in adults, much less is known about\nthe metabolic syndrome in youth. Cur-\nrent estimates indicate that roughly 4% of\nU.S. adolescents have a metabolic syn-\ndrome phenotype, based on an age-\nmodified definition of the ATP III criteria\nestablished for adults (8). When stratified\nby BMI category, roughly 29% of over-\nweight adolescents (BMI 95th percen-\ntile for age and sex) have a metabolic\nsyndrome phenotype, compared with 7%\nof at-risk-for-overweight adolescents\nand sex) and 1% of normal-weight ad-\nolescents (BMI 85th percentile for age\nand sex) (8). Because the prevalence of\noverweight has continued to increase\nsubstantially over the past several decades\namong children and adolescents in the\nU.S. (9), it is also likely that the preva-\nlence of the metabolic syndrome pheno-\ntype has increased among U.S. youth.\nThis work presents the most recent na-\ntional estimates of the prevalence of a\nmetabolic syndrome phenotype in U.S.\nadolescents, based on data from the\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES).\nThese results are compared with previous\nestimates (8) based on data from\nMETHODS -- The NHANES survey\ndesign is a stratified, multistage, probabil-\nity sample of the civilian noninstitution-\nalized U.S. population.

Ap-\nmonths to 85 years were studied in\nviduals were invited to attend a morning\nexamination after having fasted over-\nnight. The NHANES protocol was re-\nviewed and approved by the National\nCenter for Health Statistic's Institutional\nReview Board. Fully informed consent\nand assent, where applicable, were ob-\ntained from all participants before any\ntesting.\nDetails of the NHANES protocol and\nall laboratory procedures are available\nelsewhere. Briefly, height was measured\nin an upright position with a stadiometer,\nand weight was measured at a standing\nposition on a self-zeroing scale. The waist\ncircumference measurement was made at\nthe midpoint between the bottom of the\nrib cage and above the top of the iliac crest\nduring minimal respiration. Blood pres-\nsure measurements were performed by\ntrained technicians using a standardized\nprotocol. Three and sometimes four mea-\nsurements were made on all subjects with\na mercury sphygmomanometer, and the\nfirst and fifth Korotkoff sounds were re-\ncorded to represent the systolic and dia-\nstolic pressures. We used the average of\nthree recorded measurements in all data\nanalyses. Blood analytes were stored fro-\nzen and shipped to a central laboratory for\nanalysis. Plasma glucose and serum or\nplasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol\nwere all measured using fully enzymatic\ntechniques.\nsubjects aged 12\u00ad19 years who had a fast-\ning plasma glucose value recorded. Only\nsubjects who had complete data were in-\ncluded in this study. Subjects who had\nnot fasted for at least 6 h, who were preg-\nnant, or who were taking medications to\nregulate blood glucose (e.g., insulin or an\noral hypoglycemic agent) were excluded\nfrom the analysis. The final sample con-\nsisted of 991 adolescent subjects.\nMetabolic syndrome and overweight\ndefinitions\nTo allow for statistical comparisons\nstandards of the ATP III metabolic syn-\ndrome criteria published previously (8).\nWe established the abdominal obesity cri-\nterion by analyzing all adolescents in the\ncurrent dataset who had a waist circum-\nference recorded. Subjects with a value\n90th percentile for age and sex from this\nsample population were classified as hav-\ning abdominal obesity. The blood pres-\nsure criterion was defined as a value\n90th percentile for age, sex, and height,\nbased on published reference data (10).\nThe blood glucose (110 mg/dl), triglyc-\neride (110 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol\n(40 mg/dl) standards in the present\nstudy were identical to the cut points used\npreviously (8). Subjects who met at least\nthree of the five criteria were classified as\nhaving a metabolic syndrome phenotype.\nOverweight among adolescents was a\nstatistical definition based on the 2000\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion growth charts for the U.S. (9), de-\nfined as 95th percentile of BMI for age\nand sex. At risk for overweight was de-\nBMI for age and sex and normal weight as\n85th percentile of BMI for age and sex.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using STATA with\nsurvey replication package SVR (version\n7; STATA, College Station, TX). All anal-\nyses were completed using the morning\nsubsample weights to estimate means and\n95% CIs, and the jackknife replication\nweights were used to estimate the SEs of\nthose means using the delete-one-\njackknife method (11). Prevalence values\nfor those subjects with and without the\nmetabolic syndrome were compared us-\ning the 2 test for proportions. Differ-\nences between surveys for the metabolic\nsyndrome phenotype overall, by sex, and\nby race/ethnic group were tested univa-\nriately using the t test for independent\nsamples. Statistical significance was es-\ntablished at   0.05 a priori, and all\nmultiple comparisons were adjusted us-\ning the Bonferroni method.\nRESULTS -- The prevalence of a met-\nabolic syndrome phenotype was 6.4%\ncents.

The difference in\nmetabolic syndrome prevalence among\noverweight compared with at-risk-for-\noverweight adolescents was striking and\nfurther underscores the importance of\nsmall amounts of weight loss in poten-\ntially avoiding the development of the\nmetabolic syndrome and related se-\nquelae. These findings are consistent with\npublished results (8), in which 28.1 and\n6.8% of overweight and at-risk-for-\nTable 1--Prevalence of one or more risk factors of the metabolic syndrome among 991 U.S. adolescents aged 12\u00ad19 years: NHANES\nNumber of risk factors\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nBMI status (percentile)\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nBMI status (percentile)\nData are percent (95% CI).

It is not en-\ntirely surprising that this syndrome has\nincreased over the past decade among\nU.S. adolescents because overweight per\nse has also increased in the same time pe-\nriod in this group (9) and the metabolic\nsyndrome phenotype is largely confined\nto overweight adolescents. This is consis-\ntent with findings in adults, in whom the\nmetabolic syndrome was found in\nweight, overweight, and obese men and\nwomen, respectively (3).\nIn adults, older age, postmenopausal\nstatus, Mexican-American ethnicity,\nhigher BMI, current smoking, low house-\nhold income, high carbohydrate intake,\nno alcohol consumption, and physical in-\nactivity are associated with an increased\nrisk of developing the metabolic syn-\ndrome (3). Central adiposity, and specif-\nically a high level of visceral fat, is a\nhallmark feature of the metabolic syn-\ncentral obesity appears to be the major\ndiscriminating factor when comparing\nmetabolic syndrome prevalence differ-\nences in various populations (17). Adults\nwith the metabolic syndrome are also\ncharacterized by low levels of cardiorespi-\nratory fitness (VO2max\nnormalities in several inflammatory\nAlthough it has been studied exten-\nsively in adults, much less is known about\nthe metabolic syndrome in youth. A clus-\ntering of risk factors related to the meta-\nbolic syndrome, including total and HDL\ncholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and\nblood pressure, were investigated in a\nlarge group of Danish boys and girls (aged\nthe sample had four or five risk factors,\nand in these individuals, VO2max\nSDs lower and BMI 1.6 SDs higher than\nthe mean levels for these variables in the\nsample population. A population-based\nstudy (25) of factors leading to the meta-\nbolic syndrome demonstrated that one-\nhalf of the obese children sampled at age 7\nyears had become obese adults at fol-\nlow-up and had a high risk of developing\nthe metabolic syndrome; this risk was sig-\nnificantly lower among the obese adults\nwho had not been obese as children com-\npared with the obese adults who had also\nbeen obese as children. In adults, it is well\nestablished that the progression from nor-\nmal to impaired glucose tolerance, and\nsubsequently to type 2 diabetes, is char-\nacterized by peripheral insulin resistance\nand defects in -cell function (26,27). In-\nsulin resistance is thought to be the major\nunderlying feature of the metabolic syn-\ndrome (28). Along these same lines, a re-\ncent study (29) demonstrated that obese\nchildren and adolescents with impaired\nglucose tolerance had high levels of vis-\nceral and intramyocellular fat, and this al-\ntered fat partitioning was closely linked to\nsevere peripheral insulin resistance.\nThus, the factors leading to the develop-\nment of the metabolic syndrome in adults\nare also likely operating in youth, includ-\nFigure 1--Prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S. adolescents aged 12\u00ad19\noverall and by sex. All comparisons between surveys are significant at P  0.001.\nFigure 2--Prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype among U.S. adolescents aged 12\u00ad19\nrace/ethnic group. All comparisons between surveys are significant at P  0.001.\nDuncan, Li, and Zhou\ning increased BMI, visceral fat accumula-\ntion, and low cardiorespiratory fitness.\nBecause overweight adolescents are\nparticularly at risk for developing the\nmetabolic syndrome, they are also more\nlikely to develop the metabolic complica-\ntions of overweight in adulthood. This\nnotion is supported by findings from clus-\nter-tracking studies (30,31) demonstrat-\ning that overweight in youth persists into\nadulthood and may be associated with\nsubsequent adverse health outcomes in\nlater life. Similarly, several population-\nbased studies have demonstrated that el-\npressure (35\u00ad37) levels in childhood are\nassociated with elevated levels in adult-\nhood. Together, these studies demon-\nstrate that risk factors related to the\nmetabolic syndrome tend to track from\nchildhood to adulthood, increasing the\nrisk for adverse health outcomes in later\nlife. For example, in adults who do not\nhave diabetes, having the metabolic syn-\ndrome predicts incident type 2 diabetes\nindependent of age, sex, ethnicity, family\nhistory of type 2 diabetes, impaired glu-\ncose tolerance, and fasting insulin levels\n(4). In adults who have type 2 diabetes,\nthe presence of the metabolic syndrome is\nassociated with a fivefold increase in CVD\nrisk independent of age, sex, smoking sta-\ntus, and HbA1c\n(5). However, the risk of\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes and CVD in\nyouth who have the metabolic syndrome\nis unknown.\nThe number of U.S. adolescents who\nhad one or more abnormalities of the syn-\ndrome also increased from previous find-\nings. In the present study, roughly 43% of\nsubjects had at least one risk factor, nearly\n17% had two or more risk factors, and\n6.4% had three or more risk factors (i.e.,\nmetabolic syndrome) (Table 1). In\nNHANES III,  41% had at least one risk\nfactor, 14% had two or more risk factors,\nand 4.2% had three or more risk factors\n(8). When we used a fasting plasma glu-\nmmol/l) to establish the high glucose level\nthreshold, the proportion of subjects who\nhad one or more individual risk factors\nincreased to 46%, two or more risk fac-\ntors to 19%, and three or more risk factors\nto 6.7% (Table 1). Although the high glu-\ncose level standard was least common,\nwhereas high fasting triglycerides and low\nHDL cholesterol were most common (Ta-\nble 2), lowering the fasting plasma glu-\nto 5.6 mmol/l) increased the proportion\nof subjects who met this standard to\n7.6%. Closer inspection of our data re-\nveals that the major cause of the shifts\nnoted above was a large proportion of\nMexican-American and non-Hispanic\nwhite subjects who met the new glucose\nstandard. For example, the proportion of\nMexican-American adolescents who met\nthe different glucose standards increased\nmg/dl thresholds, whereas the proportion\nof non-Hispanic white youth meeting\nthese standards increased from 1.4 to\n8.1%. Thus, these groups of adolescents\nappear to be particularly prone to abnor-\nmalities in glucose metabolism.\nAlthough no national definition of the\nmetabolic syndrome in youth currently\nexists, we chose to use methods identical\nto those used previously in order to make\nstatistical comparisons between NHANES\n2000. This allowed us to estimate the cur-\nrent prevalence of a metabolic syndrome\nphenotype in adolescents and to deter-\nmine trends for this condition over the\npast decade. The cross-sectional nature of\nthe NHANES surveys does not allow us to\nmake causal inferences as to the underly-\ning relationship between developing\noverweight and the metabolic syndrome\nin youth. However, because both condi-\ntions have continued to increase in parallel\nover relatively short periods in genetically\nstable populations, our findings point to\nmajor changes in lifestyle, such as poor\ndiet and physical inactivity, as major con-\ntributors to the increasing prevalence of a\nmetabolic syndrome phenotype in youth.\nOur findings provide evidence of an\nemerging public health problem that cuts\nacross both sexes and all major ethnic/\nracial groups and further underscores the\nimportance of early intervention to pre-\nvent overweight in youth. Elucidating the\nprecursors of the metabolic syndrome in\nyouth may lead to effective therapies to\nprevent its development or to mitigate its\nconsequences later in life.\n"
