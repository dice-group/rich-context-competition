They are often assisted by\nschool resource officers (SROs) who are sworn law enforce-\nment personnel deployed in schools. Indeed, it is estimated\nthat as many as one half of public schools in the United\nStates have at minimum a part-time police presence\n(Raymond, 2010), with additional estimates suggesting that\nas many as 17,000 SROs are employed nationwide (James &\nMcCallion, 2013). The recent school shooting incident at\nSandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has resulted\nin a further push for the placement of police officers in\nschools (Brenchley, 2013), particularly in elementary schools\nwhere a police presence has been rare (e.g., Na & Gottfredson,\n2013). Research suggests that students and school personnel\nview SROs favorably (Watkins & Maume, 2012), but there\nare still prevailing questions in the literature about the pre-\ncise role of SROs and their preparedness to work in an edu-\ncational environment (Cray & Weiler, 2011).\nThe current study focuses on SROs by reviewing news\narticles reporting on the nature of criminal acts committed by\nschool police officers. It is argued that police officers are\nmore likely to be compliant when their purpose is well\ndefined and they are sufficiently prepared to complete this\nfunction (Manning, 1977). There is some contention--\nlargely found in the debate surrounding the \"school-to-\nprison\" pipeline--that SROs can suffer from role ambiguity\nand are insufficiently prepared to work with young persons\nin a school setting (e.g., Fowler, Lightsey, Monger, &\ntherefore represent an important segment of law enforcement\nto study officer misconduct.

Thirteen years later, the num-\nber of SROs assigned to work in North Carolina public\nschools had increased more than threefold to 849 (Center for\nthe Prevention of School Violence, n.d.).

Indeed, the COPS Office ended its\nCops in Schools (CIP) program during the 2005 fiscal year\nand the use of federal funds to hire school security personnel\nthrough the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities\nAct ended during the 2009 fiscal year (James & McCallion,\n2013). The elimination of these federal funding sources\nresulted in less grant or soft money being available for\nschools to hire SROs. May and colleagues (2011) also indi-\ncated that many schools and local police departments have\nhad to reassess their own funding priorities because of tight-\nening budgets related in part to the national recession of\nthe expansion or preservation of \"nonacademic\" programs,\nsuch as an SRO program, when confronted with cost-saving\nthe SCS to the NCVS offer some confirmation that the pres-\nence of SROs and other school security personnel has waned\nin recent years.

Soon after this incident President Obama\nannounced that federal money would be used to place police\nofficers in schools (Brenchley, 2013). The COPS Office\nrecently fulfilled this promise through its COPS Hiring\nProgram by awarding 141 agencies nearly 45 million dollars\nOriented Policing Services, n.d.). Evidence also suggests\nthat since Sandy Hook a number of states such as Indiana\npriated or plan to appropriate funds for the hiring of addi-\ntional SROs. This allocation of state and federal dollars\nsuggest that once again there is an upward trend in the use of\nSROs, particularly in elementary schools where SROs were\nrarely deployed prior to the shooting at Sandy Hook\nElementary School (e.g., Na & Gottfredson, 2013).\nViews and Responsibilities of SROs\nFew studies have systematically focused on SROs even\nthough police officers have played a role in schools for sev-\neral decades and are now deployed in many schools. The\nexisting research offers few answers to such basic questions\nas how SROs are selected, the nature and extent of SRO\ntraining, and the strategic uses of SROs. An exception is a\nline of research that has addressed how SROs are generally\nviewed by students, teachers, or school administrators.\nBrown and Benedict (2005) found that the vast majority of\nprimarily Hispanic students surveyed in Brownville, TX,\nwere partial to having a police officer present at school.\nSchuiteman, Aikens, and Thornton (2001) reported a similar\nfinding among a large sample of middle- and high-school\nstudents in Virginia (see also Kupchik & Bracy, 2010a).\nOther studies also indicate that teachers and school adminis-\ntrators generally favor a police presence in schools because\nthe officers can assume a number of important roles or\nresponsibilities including legal advisor, security coordinator\nfor school-related activities, and a first responder for serious\nacts of school violence (e.g., Finn, Shively, McDevitt,\nevidence also suggests that the public generally supports the\nplacement of police officers in schools (Benigni, 2004). The\nlevel of public support for SROs is not surprising given that\nschools are often depicted as unsafe places in the media\n(Kupchik & Bracy, 2009), and schools are often character-\nized as \"soft\" targets in need of additional security measures\nSROs may symbolically signal to parents and community\nmembers that student safety is an institutional priority\nMost school and community stakeholders are supportive\nof a police presence in schools, yet concerns persist regard-\ning the general fit and uses of SROs. Cray and Weiler (2011)\nbroadlyspoketothispointwhentheystatedthatschool-police\npartnerships are challenging because they bring \"together\nagencies with potentially competing orientations, practices,\nand assumptions regarding the behavior of K-12 students\"\nthe delinquency committed by students in schools would not\nbe subject to police involvement if committed in the\nStinson and Watkins 3\ncommunity because school incidents are largely of a minor\nnature (e.g., verbal threats; see Robers et al., 2013). Bittner\n(1990) noted that it is precisely for this reason that police\nofficers have traditionally assigned little value to working\nwith juveniles. Police officers earn institutional recognition\nby making the \"big bust,\" not by resolving relatively trivial\nincidents involving minors (Bittner, 1990). Although there is\nstrong reason to assume that events like Sandy Hook have\naltered many police officers' views on the utility and merits\nof working in schools with juveniles, there may be a prevail-\ning belief in law enforcement that the \"serious\" police work\noccurs in the community with adults (e.g., Morimune, 2012;\nPolice officers placed in schools often spend time on tasks\nthat are not traditional law enforcement functions such as\npatrol and investigations. Trump (2002) analyzed the survey\nresponses of more than 600 SROs who attended the National\nAssociation of School Resource Officers (NASRO) Annual\nSROs reported that they spent \"most\" of their time serving as\nan instructor/teacher or counselor/mentor. Only 41% of these\nofficers indicated that most of their time was spent as a \"law\non average these officers reported spending one half of their\ntime on law enforcement duties and the other half of their\ntime on counseling and teaching (Barnes, 2008). Some SROs\nspend considerably more time on law enforcement functions\n(e.g., May, Cordner, & Fessel, 2004), but the prior research\nstudies suggest that many SROs embrace the \"triad\" model\n(counselor, educator, and police officer) promoted by\nNASRO and the COPS Office (see Rosiak, 2011).\nIt is unclear though to what extent SROs are trained to be\neffective mentors, counselors, educators, or intervention spe-\ncialists in schools. The work of Thurau, Buckley, Gann, and\nWald (2013) indicates that entry-level police academy and\nin-service training that police officers typically receive is not\nsufficient for working with juveniles in the community and is\ncertainly not sufficient for working with juveniles in an edu-\ncational environment. Research suggests that because of this\nlack of training, many SROs are required or expected to\ncomplete some form of specialized training that focuses on\nShively, et al., 2005). Specialized training is not completed\ntraining opportunities are limited for some SROs because of\nlogistical and/or budgetary reasons (e.g., Finn, Shively, et\nThe Current Study\nThis exploratory study examines the nature of instances\nwhere an SRO was arrested for one or more criminal offenses\nand it was reported in the news media. There are at least three\nreasons that justify such a focus on SROs. First, despite the\nwidespread use of SROs, there is little systematic research\nthat focuses on the behavior of school security personnel\npolice officers are more likely to engage in prosocial behav-\nior when their role is well defined and they are sufficiently\ntrained to execute this role. In the case of SROs, questions\nremain as to whether police officers are prepared to effec-\ntively work in a school setting because of possible role ambi-\nguity, insufficient training, and the differing institutional\nnorms and priorities of schools versus police agencies (e.g.,\nLangberg, Fedders, & Kukorowski, 2011). Indeed, similar\narguments have been raised when considering the role of\nSROs in supplying the \"school-to-prison\" pipeline (Fowler\nsuch possible role, training, and institutional factors, SROs\nrepresent an important, and growing, segment of law enforce-\nment to study officer misconduct. Third, research suggests\nthat school personnel generally hold favorable views of\nSROs and consider them beneficial to the school environ-\nment (e.g., Travis & Coon, 2005). The general acceptance of\nSROs has evolved to a point where \"there is no critical dis-\ncussion among the public or policy-makers, and extremely\nlittle among academics, about whether police ought to be in\nNonetheless, when officer misconduct occurs it places a\nschool's SRO program in a negative light and may force\nsome schools to reassess its investment in the program, par-\nticularly given that SRO funding--a nonacademic expense--\nis a budgetary challenge for many schools (e.g., May et al.,\n2011). In some schools, therefore, SRO retention may\ndepend on averting any officer misconduct that undermines\nthe typically favorable views of school-based police person-\nnel. Systematic efforts to avert officer misconduct are aided\nby research that provides a better understanding of the nature\nof such incidents.\nThis research also examines the nature of crimes commit-\nted by police officers who are not deployed at schools. SROs\noften take on counseling and teaching responsibilities that\nrequire regular interaction with young persons in a non-\nthreatening environment. The adoption of such responsibili-\nties clearly suggests that the day-to-day demands and\nchallenges of SROs are disparate from those of community-\nbased police officers. Anecdotal evidence indicates that\nschools and police agencies are sensitive to these divergent\nresponsibilities and try to hire a \"teacher with a badge\" or\nofficers who are not overly preoccupied with \"chasing bad\nguys\" (e.g., Thurau & Wald, 2010). Given the unique dynam-\nics of the job at school and the presumably distinct career\norientation of SROs, there is reason to suspect the nature of\nmisconduct by school and nonschool police officers is\ndissimilar.\nThe extent and nature of crime by police officers is still\nStinson, Liederbach, & Freiburger, 2010). Prior research has\n4 SAGE Open\nshown that police officers commit a variety of crimes on-\nduty and off-duty. Crimes by police officers committed\nwhile on-duty include acceptance of bribes, theft, and drug\nStinson, Liederbach, Brewer, Schmalzried, et al., 2013).\nSome police officers commit crimes while off-duty and it is\noften difficult to determine whether such crimes are related\nto or stem from an officer's employment (Fyfe & Kane,\n2006). All of this is complicated by the fact that police offi-\ncers are generally exempt from law enforcement (Reiss,\n1971). Police officers do not like to arrest other officers, and\noften minor transgressions are ignored whereas similarly\nsituated nonpolice citizens would be arrested for their crimes\n(Black, 1976). The off-duty crimes for which officers are\nsometimes arrested include domestic violence and other\nassaults, driving under the influence (DUI), and various sex\ncrimes (Stinson, Liederbach, Brewer, & Todak, 2013;\nStinson, Liederbach, & Freiburger, 2012; Stinson &\nMethod\nThe current data were collected as part of an ongoing com-\nprehensive study on police crime. The larger study was\ndesigned to locate cases reported in the news media in which\nsworn law enforcement officers had been arrested for one or\nmore criminal offenses. The primary information source was\nthe internet-based Google NewsTM search engine and its\nGoogle AlertsTM email update service. Google News is a\ncomputer-generated news site developed and operated by\nGoogle that aggregates news articles from more than 50,000\nnews sources (Bharat & Beckmann, 2010). Automated daily\nqueries of the Google News search engine can be performed\nby user-defined search terms previously entered into the\nGoogle Alerts application.\nData Collection and Coding\nData were collected in real time on a daily basis from January\nwere conducted using the same 48 search terms developed\nby Stinson (2009). The Google Alerts email update service\nsent a message each time one of the automated daily searches\nidentified a news article in the Google News search engine\nthat matched any of the designated search terms. The auto-\nmated alerts contained a link to the URL for the news arti-\ncles. The articles were located, examined for relevancy,\nprinted, scanned, and indexed in a digital imaging database\nfor subsequent coding and content analyses.\nAfter the universe of news reports were identified, the\ncase-related information was recorded using a multipage\ncoding instrument. Data were coded on such information as\narrested officer characteristics, the nature of criminal charges\nfiled against an officer, and victim characteristics. Criminal\noffenses charged against officers were coded using a\ntwo-step process. Each offense charged was initially coded\nusing the data collection guidelines of the National Incident-\nBased Reporting System (NIBRS) as the protocol for each\ncriminal offense categories (U.S. Department of Justice,\nNIBRS, including 46 incident-based criminal offenses in 1\nof 22 basic crime categories, as well as 11 additional arrest-\nbased minor crime categories (pp. 9-12). Additional non-\nNIBRS offense categories were added to the coding\ninstrument following a pilot study because officers were\noften arrested for criminal offenses not included in the\nNIBRS. The non-NIBRS offense categories are as follows:\nindecent exposure, online solicitation of a child, criminal\ndeprivation of civil rights, destroying or tampering with evi-\ndence, false reports/statements and perjury, hit and run,\nobstructing justice, official misconduct (including official\noppression and violation of oath), and restraining/protection\norder violations.\nThe news articles were also coded using Stinson's (2009)\ntypology of police crime. This typology differentiates police\ncrime that is violence-related, sex-related, drug-related, alco-\nhol-related, and/or profit-motivated. The use of this broad\ntypology overcame initial issues we encountered with the\ndata. For instance, the criminal charges filed against an offi-\ncer in some cases failed to accurately reflect the nature of the\ncriminal acts described in the narratives of the news articles\nanalyzed, suggesting that preferential initial charging deci-\nsions were made as a professional courtesy to some of the\nofficers who were arrested. On other occasions, officers were\ncharged with generic \"official misconduct\" crimes in lieu of\nspecific crimes that would prove an embarrassment for the\nemploying law enforcement agency if the true nature of the\noffense were an element of the offense charged. This\noccurred in some cases involving SROs, where the news\nsource disclosed that an SRO was arrested for initiating an\ninappropriate relationship with a student but more detailed\ninformation was unknown or not published. It is common for\nnews media to withhold victim names and other personally\nidentifiable information when reporting on sex crimes, espe-\ncially when the victim is a child (Putnam & Finkelhor, 2006).\nThese dynamics generated a need for a broad coding strategy\nthat captured the nature of crimes committed by offenses.\nUse of the 65 specific arrest categories was also not possible\ndue to the size of the current SRO sample (n = 52). The use\nof the specific offense categories resulted in many cells hav-\ning few or no cases when frequency tables were generated.\nEfforts were made to triangulate data sources in that mul-\ntiple news articles and sources were available for many of\nthe cases reported and, as available, copies of official court\nrecords were obtained specifically to determine eventual\ncase outcomes. Coding of the offenses was completed by one\nof the authors. Procedures were undertaken to ensure the\nreliability of the data. One of the most widely accepted tests\nof reliability for content analyses is the percentage of agree-\nment test, where the percentage of agreement among two or\nStinson and Watkins 5\nmore coders is calculated (Riffe, Lacy, & Fico, 2005). A sec-\nond coder was used to independently code a random sample\nof 5% of the total number of cases in our database (n = 106).\nThe overall level of simple agreement (96.85%) between the\ntwo coders across the variables established a degree of reli-\nability well above what is generally considered \"acceptable\"\nResults\nAll of the SROs in the current sample were male, and most\nhad worked in law enforcement for more than 5 years prior\nto their arrest. The average length of service was slightly\nmore than 10 years at the time of arrest and their average age\nwas 39. Table 1 displays the distribution of offenses for\nwhich SROs were arrested. The second column in Table 1\nindicates the number (n) of SROs who were arrested for any\none of the broad category of offenses listed. The five offense\ncategories listed in Table 1 are therefore not mutually exclu-\nsive. Two SROs in the sample, for instance, supplied female\nadolescents with alcohol and then had sexual contact with\nthe girls. These two officers are found in the alcohol- and\nsex-related categories in Table 1. We found, however, that in\nmost cases SROs were arrested for either a single offense or\nfor multiple offenses that were similar in nature. One SRO in\nthe sample, for example, was arrested for possession of child\npornography and sexual abuse of middle-school students,\nboth sexually related offenses.\nIt is also worth noting that all of the violence-related\noffenses in Table 1 were nonsexual in nature. Most SROs\nwho committed sex-related crimes chose a teenage victim. A\nmajority of these crimes were described in news sources as\nconsensual even in instances where direct physical contact\noccurred. The only exceptions involved cases where it was\nnot known or made clear by news sources whether an officer\nused physical force, perhaps as a courtesy to the young vic-\ntim and her family. In these instances, it was impossible to\ndetermine whether a sex-related offense involved the use of\nphysical force and thus violence-related.\nThe data presented in Table 1 show that by a considerable\nmargin, SROs in the sample were most often arrested for\nsex-related offenses--nearly 62% of all offenses. When\nSROs did commit a sex crime, students were often the\nvictim. Of the SROs who were arrested for sex-related\ncrimes, 56% (n = 18) chose a victim(s) enrolled at the school\nat which they were employed. Six additional SROs commit-\nted sex crimes against a nonfamily member who was of\nschool age, but it was unclear whether the victim was a stu-\ndent at the school where the SRO worked. We find that 75%\n(n = 24) of SROs arrested for sex-related crimes targeted\nnonfamily youths almost entirely of middle and high school\nage.\nMany of the school-age victims were teenage girls.\nSpecifically, 62% (n = 20) of the SROs arrested for sex-\nrelated crimes were charged with offenses against teenage\ngirls who were not their family member. One incident\ninvolved an SRO who kissed a student enrolled in a junior\ncadet program he supervised and then days later sent sexu-\nally explicit text messages to the girl's cell phone. Another\nSRO was charged with having sex with a female student.\nPrior to his arrest, school officials had expressed concerns\nabout how this SRO was interacting with the female student.\nWhen direct physical contact occurred in the sex-related\noffenses, news sources often did not report on the precise\ntime and location of the incident. The limited information we\ndo have suggests that these incidents occurred mostly during\nnonschool hours and/or off school grounds.\nUnlike the sex-related offenses, other offenses for which\nSROs were arrested typically did not involve students or\nminors. The alcohol-related offenses largely involved arrests\nfor DUI, whereas the violence-related offenses were domi-\nnated by domestic violence incidents. Profit-motivated inci-\ndents dealt with crimes such as SROs stealing police- or\nschool-issued equipment or falsifying the amount of over-\ntime worked. These nonsexual crimes once again were gen-\nerally not committed in the company of students or minors.\nTable 2 displays the general types of offenses for which\npolice officers, excluding SROs, were arrested over the same\ntime period. In all, 95% (n = 1,674) of these police officers\nwere male, with an average age of 37 years, and had nearly\n10 years of sworn law enforcement experience at the time of\ntheir arrest. The current results indicate that in terms of gen-\nder, age, and experience, arrested SROs were demographi-\ncallysimilartoarrestednonschoolpoliceofficers.Differences\nbetween the two groups of officers become apparent when\nthe types of offenses for which they were arrested are\nTable 1. SRO Arrests: Distribution of Offenses (n = 52).\nna %b\naOffense categories are not mutually exclusive.\nbEach offense category was divided by the total number of SROs.\nTable 2. Nonschool Police Officer Arrests: Distribution of\nna %b 2 p V\naOffense categories are not mutually exclusive.\nbEach offense category was divided by the total number of police officers.\n6 SAGE Open\nexamined. Table 2 displays results from bivariate chi-square\ntests that assess whether significant arrest differences exist\nbetween SROs and other officers. These tests reveal that\nnonschool police officers were significantly more likely to\nbe arrested for violence-related offenses, whereas SROs\nwere significantly more likely to be arrested for sex-related\noffenses. The measure of association, Cramer's V, between\nofficer type and arrest type indicates that distributional dif-\nferences are most distinct for sex-related offenses. Among\nthe nonschool officers in Table 2 who were arrested for a\nsex-related offense (n = 399), 45% targeted unrelated minors\n(compared with 75% in the case of SROs). Table 2 also\nreveals there are no significant differences between SROs\nand nonschool officers for alcohol-related, drug-related, and\nprofit-motivated offenses. These bivariate statistical tests\nshould be interpreted with caution, however, given the low\nexpected contingency table cell counts for certain incidents\nincluding drug-related offenses involving SROs.\nDiscussion\nOur methodology produced data on police crime that would\nbe difficult, if not impossible, to obtain using other methods.\nThere are no official data or comprehensive statistics avail-\nable on the phenomenon of police crime (Kane, 2007;\nStinson et al., 2010). This research compliments existing\nstudies in the \"newsmaking criminology\" tradition whereby\ncriminologists interpret news reports about crime (Barak,\nmonly involve the analysis of news content to gain knowl-\nedge about the nature of crime-related media coverage, but\nnews content can also provide valuable information on the\nnature of the criminal behavior that underlies the media cov-\nerage (see, for example, Morris, 2010). The news reports we\nanalyzed provide an unparalleled amount of information on a\nlarge number of crimes committed by police officers, includ-\ning those by SROs.\nThere are four primary limitations with the current data.\nFirst, the research is constrained by the content and quality of\ninformation provided on each case in the news articles ana-\nlyzed. The amount of information on each case varied, and\ndata for some of the variables of interest were missing in\nsome cases. Second, the data are limited to cases involving\nan official arrest. Data on cases of police crime that failed to\ncome to the attention of law enforcement or prosecutors, or\nfailed to result in arrest were unavailable. Third, these data\nare the result of a filtering process that includes the exercise\nof discretion by media sources. Media sources exercise dis-\ncretion in terms of the types of news stories covered and the\nnature of the content devoted to particular news stories\n(Carlson, 2007). This discretion raises concerns that media\naccounts of police crime may not be representative of actual\nofficer misconduct. Some research suggests, however, that\nnews coverage of certain types of officer misconduct is con-\nsistent with official police records of these events (e.g.,\nReady, White, & Fisher, 2008). Research also suggests that\npolice agencies are not especially effective at controlling\nmedia accounts of officer misconduct (Chermak, McGarrell,\n& Gruenewald, 2006). Fourth, there are a relatively small\nnumber of arrest cases involving SROs (n = 52) in our unique\nsample. Among the limited number of studies that have\nfocused on SROs, most were undertaken with small or non-\nprobability samples (e.g., Kupchik & Bracy, 2010b). Despite\nthis weakness, these exploratory studies have been instru-\nmental in advancing research on SROs. This descriptive\nstudy aims to do the same by focusing on the implications of\nthe findings for SRO programs.\nIt is estimated that as many as one half of public schools\nin the United States have at minimum a part-time police\npresence (Raymond, 2010), and the number of police offi-\ncers deployed in schools will certainly increase in coming\nyears given that state and federal governments have made\nSROs a budgetary priority after the 2012 shooting at Sandy\nHook Elementary School (Brenchley, 2013). The placement\nof SROs in many schools has not been accompanied by a\ncorresponding investment in research that systematically\nfocuses on school police officers. We contribute to this sparse\nline of research by examining news articles to identify the\ngeneral types of offenses for which SROs are arrested. SROs\nare an important segment of law enforcement to study officer\nmisconduct because of some level of role ambiguity, limited\ntraining, and the differing institutional norms and priorities\nof schools versus local law enforcement agencies.\nOur results are encouraging insofar as they indicate that\nvery few SROs are arrested for a criminal offense. More spe-\ncifically, recent estimates suggest that there are more than\nwe identified only 52 school police officers who were\narrested for a criminal offense over a 7-year period. The trou-\nbling aspect of our findings is that when these few SROs\nwere arrested, they were most often arrested for sex-related\noffenses that typically involved female students enrolled at\nthe schools they patrolled or frequented. All of the student-\ninvolved cases in our study represent instances where an\nSRO engaged in inappropriate behavior by making sexually\nexplicit remarks or initiating sexual contact with a student.\nAs mentioned, SROs are often encouraged to assume\nresponsibilities not directly related to law enforcement\nincluding counseling and mentoring students (e.g., Finn,\nMcDevitt, Lassiter, Shively, & Rich, 2005). The activities\nprovide students with nonadversarial opportunities to inter-\nact with police officers (Jackson, 2002). Many of these\nencounters occur outside the classroom in small group or\none-on-one situations where informal conversations about\nmatters unrelated to school regularly occur. Indeed, SROs\nare often deployed in large urban public schools attended by\nstudents with unstable home lives (Lawrence, 2006). SROs\nin such schools likely encounter emotionally charged stu-\ndents whose words and actions are attributable to circum-\nstances away from school. These encounters often result in\nStinson and Watkins 7\nthe SRO taking on a nonpolice role comparable to that of a\nsocial worker or family member. As one SRO in a large\nurban school put it, his job \"goes beyond policing\" because\nhe is often a \"father figure,\" \"uncle,\" or \"everything\" to some\nTeachers are also often much more than educators. They\noften self-assess their own interactions with students to make\nsure they do not become too invested or friendly with some\nstudents (Aultman, Williams-Johnson, & Schutz, 2009).\nThese questions can be difficult to answer when research\nconsistently finds that students who express a stronger con-\nnection to their teachers perform better academically\n(Andrzejewksi & Davis, 2008). When SROs take on duties\nunrelated to law enforcement such as counseling students\nand teaching classes, they too are likely confronted by the\nsame relational questions. It is perhaps not surprising then\nthat we found that the types of crimes for which SROs are\narrested are more consistent with the types of offenses com-\nmitted by teachers (e.g., American Association of University\npolice officers (e.g., Stinson et al., 2012). The current find-\nings generally revealed that the circumstances surrounding\noffenses for which nonschool police officers were arrested\nwere often much different than the crimes committed by\nSROs. The community-based police officers were in particu-\nlar less likely than SROs to be arrested for sex-related\noffenses, but they were more likely to be arrested for vio-\nlence-related incidents such as a domestic dispute.\nOur findings, along with research on teacher misconduct\n(e.g., Shakeshaft, 2004), highlight the importance of having\nschool personnel establish and maintain relational boundaries\nwith students. Indeed, education experts have strongly\nencouraged school administrators for decades to formally\naddress student relational boundaries when training teachers\nin part because self-report research indicates that students are\nregular victims of teacher-perpetrated sexual misconduct\nthat such relational training is sparingly administered to\nteachers (Shakeshaft, 2004). The same likely holds true for\nSROs. Although most states do not require that SROs \"receive\nany specialized training before becoming an SRO or working\ncates that most SROs do eventually complete some special-\nized training--usually no more than 40 hr--such as\nparticipating in courses offered by NASRO and/or becoming\ncertified to teach Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)\nor other prevention-related curriculums (see, for example,\nFinn, Shively, et al., 2005; Finn, Townsend, Shively, & Rich,\n2005). A tertiary examination of the content of such special-\nized training opportunities suggests that relational boundaries\nwith students are sparsely addressed if at all.\nOur findings also suggest that such training should serve\nexperienced police officers in addition to officers who are\nnew to the job. Most of the SROs arrested for sexual inci-\ndents involving students had worked in schools for more\nthan 2 years. Perhaps issues with student relational boundar-\nies become more salient as officers spend more time in\nschools and have greater opportunities to informally interact\nwith students. Prior research indicates that SROs assume\nmore non-law-enforcement responsibilities the longer they\nremain at a school (e.g., Finn, Shively, et al., 2005).\nThe news articles that covered the arrests of SROs for\nsexual misconduct often raised pointed questions about the\nsupervision of these officers. Although many of these sex-\nual incidents took place away from school, research with\neducators has shown that when sexual encounters occur\nbetween teachers and students, there is often an escalation\nof events where an emotional attachment becomes a physi-\ncal one (Johnson, 2010). As that happens, there may be\nopportunities to identify questionable behaviors that occur\nat school--such as repeated closed-door or after-school\nmeetings--and intervene (Shakeshaft, 2004). Although all\nschool personnel should be cognizant of potential misbe-\nhavior and related warning signs, immediate supervisors\nbear a particular responsibility. In the case of SROs, their\nimmediate supervisor is often located off-site at a local\npolice department or tends to balance multiple responsibili-\nties that severely limit the amount of time they spend at any\none school. In fact, of the 19 SRO programs that Finn,\nShively, and colleagues (2005) evaluated, they noted that\nmost police supervisors \"do not conscientiously supervise\ntheir SROs\" (p. 47). In instances where an SRO's supervi-\nsor is located off-site or supervising multiple SROs\ndeployed across different schools, it is all the more \"essen-\ntial that the SRO's police supervisor maintain regular con-\ntact with school administrators to assess the officer's\nprogress throughout the school year accurately\" (Clark,\nMany police departments have implemented comprehen-\nsive personnel assessment systems to collect data on all\nsworn officers within their agency (Walker, Alpert, &\nKenney, 2000). These early intervention systems could be\nused to identify officers at risk of engaging in criminal\nbehaviors and sexual misconduct (International Association\nof Chiefs of Police, 2011). Police and school administrators\nare in a position to adopt such promising personnel systems\nfor SROs, but the effectiveness of these systems is certainly\nreliant on the consistent oversight and supervision of SROs.\nThe current findings indicate that SROs are rarely arrested\nfor criminal misconduct. These infrequent incidents typi-\ncally involved sexual misconduct directed at a student. The\nnature of these incidents suggests there may be benefit to\nhaving SROs receive some basic training on relational\nboundaries in the school environment, something that has\nbeen strongly advocated for teachers given the sexual nature\nof offenses they commit (Shakeshaft, 2004). In addition, pre-\nventing infrequent acts of misconduct by SROs is likely dif-\nficult given that most police officers presumably have\nsubstantial autonomy in schools, but the use of early inter-\nvention systems that ensure active and consistent supervision\n8 SAGE Open\nof SROs may facilitate the identification of problematic\nbehavior before it escalates to a serious nature. The effective\ntraining and monitoring of SROs will be a source of contin-\nued discussion and debate as state and federal governments\nmake greater investments in the placement of police officers\nin schools.\nAuthors' Note\nThe opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations\nexpressed in this article are those of the authors and do not neces-\nsarily reflect those of the Department of Justice.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This project was\nNational Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United\nStates Department of Justice\nReferences\nAmerican Association of University Women.
