Although Jumonji genes are often\nregulated transcriptionally, cell-specific gene expression of\nJumonji histone demethylases in the brain remains poorly\nunderstood. Thus, in the present study we profiled the mRNA\nlevels of 26 Jumonji genes in microglia (CD11b+ ), neurons\n(NeuN+ ) and astrocytes (GFAP+ ) from the healthy adult rat\nbrain. We optimized a method combining a mZBF (modified\nzinc-based fixative) and FCM (flow cytometry) to simultane-\nously sort cells from non-transgenic animals. We evaluated\ncell-surface, intracellular and nuclear proteins, including his-\ntones, as well as messenger- and micro-RNAs in different cell\ntypes simultaneously from a single-sorted sample. We found\nthat 12 Jumonji genes were differentially expressed between\nadult microglia, neurons and astrocytes. While JMJD2D was\nneuron-restricted, PHF8 and JMJD1C were expressed in all\nthree cell types although the expression was highest in neu-\nrons. JMJD3 and JMJD5 were expressed in all cell types, but\nwere highly enriched in microglia; astrocytes had the low-\nest expression of UTX and JHDM1D. Levels of global H3K27\n(H3 lysine 27) methylation varied among cell types and\nappeared to be lowest in microglia, indicating that differ-\nences in basal gene expression of specific Jumonji histone\ndemethylases may contribute to cell-specific gene expres-\nsion in the CNS (central nervous system).

Understanding how these cells function both individu-\nally and within a network is crucial to unraveling their role in\nhealth and disease. Interpretation of many existing epigenetic\nand gene regulation studies in the adult CNS are complicated\nby the fact that they are typically performed on tissue ho-\nmogenates, so the effects within individual cell types cannot\nbe distinguished. Another major technical hurdle in evaluat-\ning gene expression in vivo is the inability to efficiently isolate\nnucleic acids (RNA) from paraformaldehyde-fixed and sorted\ncells since major CNS cell types are best characterized by pro-\nteins expressed intracellularly. As a result, investigations of\ngene regulation in the brain often utilize cultured CNS cells\nthat are usually derived from late embryonic or neonatal an-\nimals, confounding understanding of these processes in the\nadult. Laser capture microdissection (Vincent et al., 2002; Luo\net al., 2007), live cell sorting by FCM (flow cytometry) from\nS. M. C. Smith and others\ntransgenic animals expressing fluorescent proteins driven by\ncell-type-specific promoters (Lobo et al., 2006), ribosomal-\ntagging for mRNA isolation from transgenic animals (Doyle\nalcohol-based fixation to sort neurons for subsequent RNA\nanalysis (Guez-Barber et al., 2011a) are commonly used meth-\nods permitting assessments of RNA in specific CNS cell pop-\nulations, but each have their own drawbacks. Although each\ntechnique has enabled significant advances in neurobiology,\ntheir limitations include investigations of only a single-cell\ntype at a time, the need to use and maintain transgenic an-\nimals, and/or the inability to concurrently analyze nucleic\nacids and intracellular proteins in a single sample. Therefore,\nwe endeavored to overcome these obstacles by optimizing\na novel method using non-transgenic, adult rats where pro-\nteins and nucleic acids can be concurrently analyzed by FCM\nin multiple neuron and glial cell types simultaneously iden-\ntified using a combination of intracellular and extracellular\nmarkers.\nAlthough FCM is commonly used to analyze and sort pure\ncell populations, the ability to efficiently recover nucleic acids\nfrom formaldehyde-fixed cells is not (Diez et al., 1999). This\nlimitation is particularly significant for neuroscience research\nbecause the best-characterized cell-type-specific markers for\nneurons and astrocytes are intracellular, thus requiring fixa-\ntion and permeabilization for immunostaining-based detec-\ntion. Guez-Barber and colleagues (Guez-Barber et al., 2011a)\nreported the use of an alcohol-based fixative to sort neurons\nfrom non-transgenic animals for subsequent RNA analysis,\nthe utility of which has been demonstrated several times\nfor evaluating nucleic acids in sorted neurons (Guez-Barber\nwhen endeavoring to isolate nucleic acids from identified\nand sorted neuron and glial cell populations simultaneously,\nbased on a combination of intracellular and cell surface iden-\ntification markers, alcohol fixation was ineffective in our\nstudies. We thus turned to a ZBF (zinc-based fixative) which\nwas previously shown to preserve cellular structure, proteins\nand nucleic acids in histological and cellular studies (Wester\ncause a mZBF (modified zinc-based fixative) was previously\nshown to preserve nucleic acids better than the standard\nzinc fixation methods (Lykidis et al., 2007), we evaluated\nintracellular, extracellular and nuclear proteins, as well as\npost-translational modifications to histone tails with mZBF\nafter a mechanical dissociation protocol. We found that all\nparameters were readily preserved. Fixed microglia, neurons\nand astrocytes were sorted based on the cell surface (CD11b)\nand intracellular markers [NeuN (neuronal nuclei) and GFAP\n(glial fibrillary acidic protein), respectively], and we obtained\nhigh-quality messenger and small non-coding RNAs [miRNAs\n(microRNAs)]. We also observed differences in basal histone\nsuggesting fundamental differences in chromatin structure\nbetween CNS cell types. The purity of sorted cell popula-\ntions from the adult CNS was confirmed by evaluation of\nmRNA levels of cell-type-specific genes in individual cell\npopulations.\nThe importance of histone demethylation in the molecu-\nlar regulation of CNS gene transcription is becoming increas-\ningly appreciated. Our overall research goal is to understand\nthe role of histone demethylation in regulating gene tran-\nscription in individual CNS cell types (microglia, neurons and\nastrocytes), since cell-specific gene regulation strongly con-\ntributes to cell\u00adcell communication in CNS health and dis-\nease. Two families of histone demethylases have been identi-\nfied: LSD (lysine-specific demethylases) and JmjC (Jumonji C)\ndomain family proteins (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). Whereas\nthe Jumonji demethylases comprise the largest gene family\nof histone demethylases, little is known about their expres-\nsion or function in the adult CNS, in any cell type. To begin\nto understand how epigenetic regulation influences CNS cell\nfunction, and because so little is known about the expres-\nsion of key Jumonji demethylases in any CNS cell type in the\nadult, we used the present method to independently profile\nthe expression of the 26 best characterized Jumonji histone\ndemethylase family members in microglia, neurons and astro-\ncytes. We found that seven Jumonji genes had greater than a\n3-fold change in mRNA expression levels between cell types.\nOf these, PHF8, JMJD1C and JMJD2D had neuron-specific\nexpression, whereas JMJD3 and JMJD5 were primarily ex-\npressed in microglia. UTX and JHDM1D had very low expres-\nsion in astrocytes compared to neurons and microglia. Col-\nlectively, these data suggest that there is cell-type-specific\nregulation of basal histone demethylase expression in the\nCNS. Moreover, because these enzymes have different his-\ntone targets and enzymatic specificities (Kooistra and Helin,\n2012), these results also suggest that histone demethyla-\ntion likely plays different functional roles in the control of\ngene expression in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the\nhealthy brain. The present technique provides a simple ex-\nperimental means with which to begin in vivo studies of cell-\nspecific epigenetic gene regulation in multiple CNS cell types\nsimultaneously.\nAnimals\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the rec-\nommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Lab-\noratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The goat anti-rabbit PE-CY7\n(R-phycoerythrin-cyanine 7) antibody was purchased from\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology.\nControl of RNAse and DNAse contamination\nSpecial precautions were taken during sample collection\nand processing to preserve RNA integrity. Only certified\nnuclease-free plastic ware and/or glassware baked at 400C\nfor 4 h were used. All surfaces and tools were treated\nwith RNase AWAY (Invitrogen) to prevent RNase contam-\nination. All solutions were prepared with DEPC-treated\nwater.\nMechanical dissociation and fixation of neural\ntissue\nRats were killed with an overdose of isoflurane anesthetic,\nand perfused with cold 0.1 M PBS. The brain, excluding ol-\nfactory bulbs, brainstem and cerebellum was dissected, and\nplaced into cold HBSS on ice. Samples remained on ice for\nthe duration of the procedure, and all centrifugation steps\nwere performed at 4C. We modified a mechanical dissoci-\nation protocol (Chassevent et al., 1984) for creating single-\ncell suspensions of CNS tissues by pushing the tissue through\na pre-moistened 100 m filter with a syringe plunger and\nflushing the filter with ice-cold HBSS supplemented with\n0.01 mg/ml DNase and 0.1 mM EDTA. Myelin was removed\nby high-speed centrifugation at 850 g for 15 min in a so-\nlution consisting of 26% Percoll in 0.1 M PBS. Dissociated\ncells were washed in ice-cold HBSS and pelleted by cen-\ntrifugation at 350 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspened in a\n(1:1), as previously described (Lykidis et al., 2007; Jensen\nuntil ready to be used. Consistent with previous reports\n(Jensen et al., 2010), we have stored samples for several\nweeks with no detectable loss of cell integrity or immunos-\ntaining efficiency (results not shown). To assess the effects\nof the fixation process on RNA quality, comparisons be-\ntween fresh and fixed tissues, and fixed/sorted cells were\nperformed.\nCell population analysis by FCM\nFixed samples were washed 3X in ice-cold PBS and perme-\n(w/v) BSA. All staining occurred on ice in the permeabiliza-\ntion buffer, protected from light. Cells were stained with\non ice. Prior to staining, the EAAT2 (GLT-1) antibody was\ncustom conjugated to Alexa 647 utilizing the Lightning-Link\nantibody conjugation kit, according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Samples were washed and resuspended for sort-\ning in permeabilization buffer containing DAPI (1 g/ml)\nto identify cells with intact nuclei. FCM analysis and cell\nsorting was performed using a FACSAria II equipped with\nset, and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). All appropriate\ncompensation and FMO controls were performed and uti-\nlized in the analysis. Intact cells were identified using FSC\n(forward-scatter) and SSC (side-scatter) parameters, singlet\ngates, and DAPI staining to identify cells in cell cycle at the\ntime of fixation. Samples were first gated to exclude dou-\nblets and any events off scale with the following singlet\ngates: FSC-Width/SSC-Area, SSC-Width/FSC-Area. We then\nused a cell cycle gate to identify cells with intact nuclei\nbased on DAPI-Width/DAPI-Area plotted on a linear scale.\nCell populations were identified and gated using FMO con-\ntrols. Cells were identified based on their fluorescence prop-\nerties, and were sorted through a 120 M nozzle at 14 psi\ninto 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Sorted cell populations were\ndefined as the following: neurons (NeuN+ /CD11b- /GFAP\nor GLT-1- ), microglia (CD11b+ /NeuN- /GFAP or GLT-1- )\nand astrocytes (GFAP or GLT-1+ /CD11b- /NeuN- ). Imme-\ndiately following the sort, the cells were pelleted and re-\nsuspended in Tri Reagent for RNA isolation. Following the\nsort, an aliquot of the remaining, unsorted, fixed and\nstained cells was taken for comparison to the unfixed and\nfixed/sorted cells. Post-sort population analyses and graph-\nical representations were performed in FlowJo software\nv.10. (TreeStar Inc.).

The ex-\npression of a given gene was averaged across all cell types,\nand the expression within a given cell type was normalized to\nthis average. The normalized values were subjected to a Log2\ntransformation and were graphically displayed as a heat map\ncreated with TreeView software (Saldanha, 2004).

The DAPI stain is essential, as it acts as an\nadditional means to identify intact cells and to exclude de-\nbris from the sample (Figure 1C).

There was clear sepa-\nration between CD11b versus NeuN (Figure 2A) and CD11b\nversus GFAP (Figure 2B) immunostained cells. To determine\nif there was overlap between the NeuN and GFAP staining,\nwe plotted NeuN versus GFAP in the CD11b- cell popula-\ntion (Figure 2C).

We found that\nthe CT\nvalues for both 18s and -tubulin with zinc fixation\nwere higher when compared to CT\nvalues in live, unfixed cells\n(Figure 3A), indicating that RNA quality is somewhat reduced\nby the fixation process, or that there are factor(s) acting as\nPCR inhibitors. Interestingly, 18s RNA appears to be more\nnegatively affected by the fixation process than -tubulin,\nsuggesting a potential RNA size effect. When compared to\nlive cells, the CT\nvalues for 18s were increased by 3 cy-\ncles in both the fixed/unsorted (P < 0.001) and fixed/sorted\n(P < 0.001) samples, whereas -tubulin was increased by 1\ncycle in the fixed/unsorted samples (P = 0.260) and by 2 cy-\ncles in the fixed/sorted samples (P = 0.024).

In addition, the quantity of RNA obtained from\nthe same number of cells based on absorbance at 260 nm\nappeared to be 3\u00ad4 times higher for astrocytes compared to\nneurons and microglia (Table 2). To account for these differ-\nences in subsequent gene expression analyses, we averaged\nthe 18s and -tubulin CT\nvalues for CT\ncalculations.\nCell-specific gene expression confirms purity of\nfixed, stained and sorted cells\nUsing qRT-PCR to analyze the expression of known cell-\ntype-specific genes, we assessed the purity of sorted neu-\nron, microglia and astrocyte cell populations from four in-\ndependent cells sorts. We found that the neuron-specific\ngenes NeuN, -III tubulin and neurofilament were highly ex-\npressed in NeuN+ cells, and that NeuN and -III tubulin\nwere lowly expressed or undetectable in microglia and astro-\ncytes (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, neurofilament was somewhat\ndetectable in both microglia and astrocytes. The microglia-\nspecific genes CD11b, Iba-1 and CD68 were highly expressed\nin microglial (CD11b+ ) cells, and lowly expressed or unde-\ntectable in astrocyte (GFAP+ ) and neuron (NeuN+ ) popula-\ntions (Figure 4B). Likewise, the astrocyte-specific genes GFAP,\nGLT-1 and ALDH1L1 were highly expressed in GFAP+ cells\n(Figure 4C) and lowly expressed in microglia and neurons.\nCell-type specific expression of Jumonji histone\ndemethylases\nWe used a custom qPCR array to analyze the expression of\n26 JmjC-domain containing histone demethylases (Jumonji\ndemethylases) in sorted microglia, neurons and astrocytes.\nFor initial screening purposes, we pooled equal amounts of\ncDNA from four independent animal samples into a single\nsample (run in duplicate) to obtain the average expression\nof each Jumonji gene in all cell types. We found that 12 of\nthe 26 Jumonji mRNAs were differentially expressed among\ncell types by at least 2\u00ad3-fold, and seven had greater than a\n3-fold change relative to the other cell types (Figure 5A). We\nconfirmed these results in samples from four independent\ncell sorts, obtained from four different animals, using qRT-\nPCR to profile the Jumonji mRNAs identified by the array as\nFigure 4 qRT-PCR of cell-specific genes confirms sorted CNS cell purity\nTotal RNA harvested from fixed/sorted cells was utilized for qRT-PCR of cell\u00ad\ntype specific genes to confirm the purity of the sort.

We co-stained cells with antibodies against H3K27me1\ngether with cell-specific markers. As expected, we detected\nneurons and astrocytes appeared to have increased and more\nmicroglia as evidenced by broader peaks on the histogram.\nWe also used an antibody against the H3 histone protein\nthat recognizes an epitope on the C-terminus of the core hi-\nstone not readily accessible in its native conformation. With\nthis antibody, we observed only a slight shift in the mean\nfluorescent intensity (Figures 6E and 6F) although pan H3\nimmunostaining in microglia, in contrast to the methylated\nimmunostaining at H3K27, appeared to be greater than in\nneurons and astrocytes. These results indicate that native hi-\nstone structure is maintained in the mZBF-fixed cells, that\nhistone tail post-translational modifications can be visual-\nized by FCM in this fixative, and that levels of methylated\nhistones differ among CNS cell types.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully iden-\ntify and isolate distinct CNS neuron and glial cell populations\nsimultaneously from the adult, non-transgenic, rodent brain\nbased on a combination of intra- and extra-cellular markers\nby FCM. The mZBF used here preserves cell surface, intra-\ncellular, and nuclear protein structure, and we have used it\nto perform analyses of cell cycle, histone tail modifications,\nand other proteins prior to cell sorting, maximizing the in-\nformation obtainable from a single CNS tissue sample. We\nshow that the quality of ribosomal, messenger and miRNAs\nretrieved from the sorted cells is adequate for subsequent\ndownstream qRT-PCR analyses, providing a means to study\nepigenetic regulation of gene expression in the specific CNS\npopulations from the same sample. This important technical\nadvance represents a particularly significant step forward for\ngene expression studies in non-neuronal cell types for which\nintracellular epitopes are the best characterized, and/or for\nwhich antibodies against extracellular epitopes of cell-type-\nspecific surface markers are not widely available. An addi-\ntional benefit of this method is the ability to store samples\nfor many weeks for later analyses.\n202 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCell-type-specific CNS Jumonji expression\nFigure 6 Post-translational histone modifications can be analyzed by FCM in zinc-fixed cells\nmZBF-fixed cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against NeuN, CD11b, and GFAP to identify neurons, microglia and astrocytes\nrespectively, in the presence of antibodies against the histone mark (A,B) H3K27me1, (C,D) H3K27me3, or (E,F) pan-H3. Singlet and\nDAPI+ gated populations were subsequently gated by cell-type, and changes in the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the respective\nhistone marks were assessed. Shifts in the MFI with primary antibody relative to signal with IgG isotype control antibody are shown in\nthe histograms, and averaged data (n = 4 independent samples) are shown in the bar graphs.\nCellular fixation and permeabilization are necessary for\nantibody-mediated detection of intracellular antigens by\nFCM. Recovery of RNAs from standard formaldehyde- or\nparaformaldehyde-fixed cells is poor (Esser et al., 1995; Diez\net al., 1999) especially when cell numbers are limiting, and al-\ncohol fixation is not ideal for extracellular marker-based cell\nidentification [results not shown and (Shapiro, 1988; Perez\net al., 2001)]. Several recent studies have successfully used\nan alcohol-based fixation method for recovery of RNA from\nintracellularly identified neuron populations (Guez-Barber\nbecause we wished to use a combination of intracellular and\ncell surface markers for cell identification, we applied the\nmodified zinc-based fixation method to isolate RNAs from\nfixed and sorted neurons and glia. Consistent with previous\n2010), DNA could also be successfully isolated from zinc-fixed\ncells (results not shown), increasing the utility of this tech-\nnique for the study of epigenetic DNA modifications. Many\nfields are plagued by the need/desire to fix samples prior to\nflow cytometric analysis and/or cell sorting, and more infor-\nmation can be obtained from fixed cells (because intracel-\nlular proteins can be quantified). Fixation often adds a level\nof safety for more biohazardous samples since significant\nbiosafety concerns are present when working with human,\npathogen-infected or virally transduced cells, particularly in\nFCM facilities where the potential for aerosolization is high\n(Schmid et al., 2003). Although not tested here, this fixation\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nS. M. C. Smith and others\nmethod may also be a useful alternative to live sorting when\nnucleic acid recovery is desired from biohazardous samples.\nWe undertook the present study to begin to investigate\nthe epigenetic control of gene expression in microglia and\nneurons as it relates to cell\u00adcell communication in pathol-\nogy. Although live microglia can easily be identified and\nsorted based on cell surface marker identification (e.g. CD11b)\n(Nikodemova and Watters, 2012), the same cannot be done\nwith live neurons, as the best-characterized markers are in-\ntracellular. Adult astrocyte identification also suffers from\nthe same issues as neurons with regard to intracellular mark-\ners and/or antibodies only being available toward intracel-\nlular epitopes of cell surface markers (e.g. GLT-1). Indeed,\nthe dissociation procedure reported here is not optimized\nfor astrocytes as the mechanical disruption decreases as-\ntrocyte viability, reducing their recovery. However, the me-\nchanical method was optimal for the retrieval of neurons\nand microglia, which are the major cell types of interest\nto us. In the course of optimizing this technique for our\npurposes, we found that enzymatic dissociation with papain\n(Nikodemova and Watters, 2012) permitted much better as-\ntrocyte recovery, although it greatly decreased neuron re-\ntrieval (results not shown). Efficiency of microglial recovery\nwith both methods was not different. The overlap observed\nbetween the GFAP+ and NeuN+ cells (<1%; Figure 2C) is\nprobably a product of the mechanical dissociation process.\nFor example, incomplete dissociation may result in astrocyte\ndebris sticking to neuronal cells. Alternatively, GFAP/NeuN\ndouble positive cells could represent a population of neu-\nral progenitor cells expressing both NeuN and GFAP markers\n(Sanchez-Ramos et al., 2000). Results from the ImageStream\nanalyses supported both notions: whereas there were true\nNeuN+ /GFAP+ double positive cells (likely precursor cells),\nthe most were double positive because of cell debris stuck\nto an intact cell (results not shown). In addition, there was\na large proportion of cells (39%) that were triple nega-\ntive for the three cell identification markers used here. Al-\nthough additional studies are needed to specifically identify\nthe members of this cell population, we speculate that these\nare likely to be astrocyte/glial cells and endothelial cells that\nwere not identified by the primary markers used here. For\nexample, whereas GFAP is the most commonly used marker\nfor astrocytes, it is only expressed by a fraction of astrocytes,\nthe intensity and percentage of which varies throughout the\nbrain (Kimelberg, 2004). Thus, while the present dissocia-\ntion method is not ideal for GFAP+ astrocyte recovery, more\nefficient and universal astrocyte identification may require\nsimultaneous staining with multiple astrocyte markers (e.g.\nGFAP, GLT-1, ALDH1L1), regardless of dissociation method.\nBecause histone demethylation is commonly associ-\nated with the activation/repression of gene transcription\nmicroglial inflammatory activities require new gene tran-\nscription of cytokines and other mediators of inflammation\nwe were particularly interested in which histone demethy-\nlase enzymes were expressed in microglia and neurons. In\nthis study, we focused on the Jumonji histone demethylase\ngene family that contains 30 members based on sequence\nhomology (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). The Jumonji demethy-\nlases catalyze a dioxygenase reaction to remove mono-, di-\nand tri-methyl groups from lysine and arginine residues, pri-\nmarily on histone H3, H4 and H1 substrates. This reaction is\ndependent on Fe (II) and -ketoglutarate (Kooistra and Helin,\n2012). There is very little known about the role of Jumonji\nhistone demethylases in the regulation of CNS function in\ngeneral, and nothing is known about their cell-specific ex-\npression in the adult CNS. Given the significant differences in\ngene expression profiles in microglia, neurons and astrocytes,\nwe hypothesized that there would be cell-type-specific dif-\nferences in the basal expression of the Jumonji demethylase\ngenes.\nWe found that seven Jumonji family genes were most\ndifferentially expressed between neurons, microglia and as-\ntrocytes. PHF8, JMJD1C and JMJD2D were highly neuron-\nspecific as they were undetectable or very lowly expressed in\nmicroglia and astrocytes. Neuronal expression of PHF8 and\nJMJD1C is consistent with previous reports (Wolf et al., 2007;\nQiu et al., 2010). PHF8 is important for proper neural de-\nvelopment (Qiu et al., 2010), and its mutation is associated\nwith Fragile X syndrome, believed in part to be responsible\nfor the associated cognitive deficits (Laumonnier et al., 2005;\nKleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010). JMJD1C protein levels are\nhigh in androgen-responsive neurons where it is proposed to\nbe involved in the co-activation of the androgen receptor\n(Wolf et al., 2007). Although mutations in the JMJD1C gene\nare linked to the development of autism (Castermans et al.,\nderstood as the histone substrate for this enzyme has not yet\nbeen identified (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). Very little is known\nabout the role of JMJD2D in the CNS. However, similar to\nJMJD1C, JMJD2D acts as an androgen receptor co-activator\nin the prostate (Shin and Janknecht, 2007). Perhaps in the\nCNS, JMJD2D plays a similar role to JMJD1C. We found that\nJMJD3 and JMJD5 were more highly expressed in microglia\nthan in astrocytes or neurons. JMJD3 is an important regu-\nlator of both inflammatory (De Santa et al., 2009; Das et al.,\nmacrophages (Satoh et al., 2010), and JMJD5 expression in\nosteoclasts is an important regulator of osteoclastogenesis\n(Youn et al., 2012). There is now one report of a Jumonji\ngene family member (JMJD3) in microglia (Tang et al., 2014).\nJMJD3 was shown to be critical for switching between in-\nflammatory and anti-inflammatory/reparative phenotypes in\nimmortalized microglia, consistent with reported effects in\nmacrophages. Finally, we found UTX and JHDM1D to be more\nlowly expressed in astrocytes, compared to neurons and mi-\ncroglia. UTX is an X-chromosome-linked gene and is more\nhighly expressed in the female brain (Xu et al., 2008), but\nnothing is known about its expression in astrocytes. Only\nmale rats were included in our study; thus, it is possible that\nUTX levels may be higher in astrocytes isolated from female\n204 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCell-type-specific CNS Jumonji expression\nrats. Interestingly, a point mutation in the UTX gene results\ncharacterized by developmental delay, cognitive disabilities\nand craniofacial abnormalities. Because these morbidities are\nalso associated with aberrant astrocyte activity (e.g. Alexan-\nder disease, Fragile X disease) (Molofsky et al., 2012), impaired\nor overactive UTX activity in astrocytes specifically, may play\nan important physiological role in neuropsychiatric disease.\nLastly, little information is available on the role of JHDM1D\nin the brain. It is known to regulate neural differentiation\n(Huang et al., 2010b) and neural fate specification (Huang\net al., 2010a) during embryogenesis. We find its expression\nin the adult CNS to be lowest in astrocytes and highest in\nneurons, consistent with the idea that the JHDM1D gene\nmay be down-regulated in astrocytes after progenitors have\ncommitted to the glial phenotype. Whether differences in\nbasal Jumonji demethylase gene expression contribute to\ncell-type-specific regulation of gene expression in the adult\nCNS is not yet known, but the present data are consistent\nwith this possibility.\nThere are apparent differences in the magnitude of\nrons having the highest expression of both marks. While the\nsignificance of this is not yet clear, differences in H3K27\nmethylation at the specific gene promoters may contribute\nto fundamental, cell-specific differences in gene expression\nprofiles among these cell types. Additional studies involv-\ning chromatin immunoprecipitations are necessary to test\nthis hypothesis further. In addition to histone modifications,\nmiRNAs are another important aspect of epigenetic gene\nregulation. In this study, we evaluated levels of miR-146a\nand miR-26 in sorted microglia, astrocytes and neurons to\ndetermine if the quality of recovered miRNAs from cells pro-\ncessed in this way was adequate for subsequent investigation.\nWhile we could easily amplify miRNAs, we found cell-type\nspecificity of the two miRNAs we evaluated. We found that\nmiR-146a was highly expressed in microglia (but was very\nlow in neurons and astrocytes), consistent with its expres-\nsion primarily in myeloid lineage cells (O'Connell et al., 2011;\npreferentially expressed in astrocytes (Smirnova et al., 2005),\nwe were surprised to find it equally detectable in astrocytes\nand neurons. However, the astrocyte-specific expression of\nmiR-26 was determined in differentiated murine stem cells\nin vitro (Smirnova et al., 2005). Our samples are rat, and\nthere are significant species differences in miRNAs. Alter-\nnatively, differences may be related to cell age. Our studies\nwere performed on adult cells isolated from the whole brain;\nstem cells differentiated in vitro may not accurately reflect\nidentical gene expression levels and patterns of 3-month-\nold adult cells in vivo. Furthermore, gene expression in neu-\nrons and astrocytes in vivo are highly influenced by the CNS\nmicroenvironment and cannot be identically recapitulated\nin vitro during stem cell differentiation. Together, these re-\nsults reinforce the need to study miRNAs in specific cell types\nin vivo.\nIn conclusion, this technique adapts known FCM and cell\nfixation methods to the field of neuroscience, advancing our\nability to study epigenetics and gene regulation simultane-\nously in glia and neurons. To lay the foundation for future\nstudies of histone demethylation-regulated gene expression,\nwe utilized this procedure to investigate the profile of Ju-\nmonji gene family histone demethylase expression in neu-\nrons, microglia and astrocytes from the healthy CNS. Our\nfindings are consistent with the limited available literature.\nMore importantly, the results provide new information about\ncell-specific Jumonji gene expression in the adult CNS, under-\nscoring the importance of understanding cell-specific regu-\nlation of epigenetic modifiers in the adult, non-transgenic\nbrain.\nStephanie Smith carried out all animal and flow cytometry\nexperiments, performed statistical analyses, generated the\nFigures and contributed to study design. Rebecca Kimyon per-\nformed the RNA analyses and helped create the figures. Jyoti\nWatters conceived of and designed the study, helped with\nstatistical analyses and obtained funding.
