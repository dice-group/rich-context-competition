Following a discussion of the theoretical\nelaborations (and their working definitions) of the concept of cognitive mobilization, a longitudinal study of various European\ncountries is used to consider the question of how political crises influence cognitive mobilization indexes and what effects\nthey have on the political socialization process among the youngest cohorts.\n",

Inglehart studies the evolu-\ntion of CM and its effects in different societies to make com-\nparative observations of how much it depends on other\nfactors, such as economic and cultural development. To mea-\nsure the influence of these factors, Inglehart combines a cross-\nsectional analysis of European societies (observing different\nlevels of economic development) with, principally, a longitu-\ndinal study to determine the effect that the level of education\nhas on different age groups, under the clear premise that levels\nof education and access to information are on the rise. This\narticle considers Inglehart's hypotheses and updates the time\nframe that he analyzed by a matter of decades. Extending this\ntime period not only corroborates some of Inglehart's conclu-\nsions but also introduces nuances and modifications in others,\nin the light of the analysis of new data.\nInglehart sees CM as a central aspect within a broader\nprocess. The context is that of modernization and the devel-\nopment of Western societies. In his work, The Silent\nRevolution, he defines it as follows:\nWe are interested in these changes insofar as they con-\ntribute to the process of Cognitive Mobilization. The\nessence of this process is the development of the skills\nneeded to manipulate political abstractions and thereby\nto coordinate activities that are remote in space or\ntime. Without such skills, one is more or less doomed\nto remain an outsider to the political life of a modern\nnation-state. Consequently, historical changes in the\ndistribution of these skills have been a major factor in\ndefining the politically relevant public.\nSocial Mobilization is a broad process. Western countries\nhave long since completed many of its most important\nstages, such as urbanisation, basic industrialisation, wide-\nspread literacy, mass military service, and universal suf-\nfrage. Nevertheless, an essential aspect continues -the\nvery core of the process: the increasingly wide dissemi-\nnation of the skills necessary to cope with an extensive\npolitical community.

This increase is central because it means increased\nautonomy for subjects in terms of bureaucratized forms and\nclassic hierarchies linked to politics (the political party,\nchiefly), a preference for new (unconventional) forms of par-\nticipation and, in short, an approximation of the practice of\ndirect (top-down) democracy.\nThus, the development of the concept of CM relates\nclearly to the classical meaning of the concept of public\nopinion: the discussion of public issues by informed citizens.\nTo an extent, it takes up the idea of small political communi-\nties in which political communication occurs face-to-face\nand develops through direct knowledge of public issues,\nfacilitating collective decision making.\nA precursor to what could in terms of political culture be\ncalled the \"cognitive mobilization theory\" is the concept of\n\"subjective political competence\" as described by Almond\nand Verba (1964), which is used to study citizen involvement\nin the political system. Their interest was to establish a the-\nory as to how citizens perceived political structures and insti-\ntutions by studying their opinions. The aim was to observe to\nwhat extent people surveyed believed that they could partici-\npate in political decisions at a local level. The greater the\nsubjective competence, the higher the probability of being\npolitically active. The authors conclude that well-informed\ncitizens with higher status possess greater subjective compe-\ntence (defined as the extent to which citizens think that they\ncan influence political decisions) and a higher chance of par-\nticipating in politics. Alongside this sense of \"political effi-\ncacy\" is \"political orientation\" (community involvement and\nvery politically informed).\nMuch of the literature on CM has focused on the link to\npolitical parties. The oldest precursors of this are found in\nCampbell, Gurin, and Miller (1954), who were the first to\nreflect on the phenomenon of party identification. For these\nauthors, this phenomenon is psychological and it has emo-\ntional components that are formed during the process of\nsocialization, and the main source of which is the family.\nThey are interested in how attitudes are formed and political\nparticipation, with the political party as the main agent.\nCampbell and Converse (1960), however, draw the conclu-\nsion that the political party acts as a funnel model. As an\nagent of political socialization, this model determines the\nattitudes and votes of citizens, who develop a feeling of emo-\ntional identification toward a party's \"label.\" The conclusion\nis that it is political parties that translate abstract political\nconcepts for citizens and offer them an interpretation of\nreality.\nAnother concept closely linked to CM is \"political sophis-\ntication,\" as discussed by Converse (1964), who studies the\ndegree of influence of ideology and beliefs in political\nbehavior. The author's aim is to determine the degree of\ncoherence of citizens' ideological constructs and measure\ntheir ability to understand and apply political information\nwhen assessing certain issues or deciding how to vote. The\nrelationship between interpretation, system of beliefs, and\neducation leads to the concept of \"political sophistication.\"\nFor Converse, the most politically sophisticated are those\nwho are most highly educated, politically involved, and well\ninformed, while political party identification facilitated the\ndecision-making process for voting, preferably in less politi-\ncally sophisticated voters. Another important contribution is\nShively's (1979) functional model, in which political parties\ntranslate political information for citizens. This is because\nparty identification is a cost-saving device in the decision-\nmaking process of which party to vote for. With higher levels\nof education, there is less need for party guidance.\nTogether with Inglehart, Dalton's works have been the most\ninfluential in the research of CM. Dalton (1984) uses the con-\ncept of \"cognitive mobilization\" to create a classification sys-\ntem for political party identification that is widely used in the\nstudy of political participation (apartisans, cognitive partisans,\nritual partisans, and apoliticals). Dalton defines CM as a pro-\ncess by which more people acquire the resources and skills that\nhelp them to face the complexities of politics and make their\nown decisions. The variables of level of education and interest\nin politics are used to create the index. For Dalton, just as for\nInglehart, a progressive increase in education leads to an\nincrease in independent citizens (high CM and low party iden-\ntification). Although he observes that party identification has\nbeen positively correlated with CM, this relationship should\nchange when younger cohorts are incorporated, as not only do\nthey have higher levels of education, they also have greater\naccess to political information through their exposure to the\nmass media.\nDalton's work has had notable repercussions and has been\nwidely reviewed by other authors, including the author him-\nself (Dalton, 2007), presenting new models that analyze\nparty identification. In general, criticism of the Dalton model\ncomes from the empirical evidence that in some countries,\nparty identification has not dropped in any considerable way,\nand has even risen. Dalton defends himself from criticism in\na recent study on German voters (2010). In his review of\nDalton's works, Albright (2009) asserts that it is risky to\ndraw any conclusions regarding the progressive drop in party\nidentification. The problem arises when the two phenomena\noccur simultaneously (identification and CM based on the\nindicators for \"interest in politics\" and \"level of education\"),\nin which case it is impossible to determine whether CM is\nBerglund, Holmberg, Schmitt, and Thomassen (2005)\nobserve that contextual factors have not been taken suffi-\nciently into account, such as the degree of polarization between\nparties. Polarization may lead subjects to perceive greater\nideological differences between parties and for party identifi-\ncation and partisanship to rise. Huber, Kernel, and Leoni\n(2005) assert that changes in party identification may be due\nAlaminos and Penalva 3\nmore to the institutional political context than to changes in\nsocial structure, and that the degree of party identification\ndepends on the nature of the competition between parties.\nIn general, it is assumed that deficiencies in the models\napplied in Europe are the result of the differences in the\npolitical and electoral system, the political culture, and other\nhistoric aspects. Contextual factors, for instance, have not\nbeen sufficiently developed, although some authors have\npointed this out in the study of political involvement and\nparty identification. This clearly responds to the difficulty in\nincorporating an excess of variables into such a study, but\naccording to Inglehart's concept of CM (central part of a\nbroad process), this is essential.\nIt could be concluded that CM theory encompasses all\nworks that use it as an explanatory variable of the changes that\noccur among younger generations in postindustrial societies,\ncharacterized at times by low levels of electoral participation\nand party identification. Discussion in recent years over the\ntheory is whether there really are more or fewer \"partisans\" in\nterms of identification and whether there is more or less par-\nticipation in elections for Dalton's different categories of par-\ntisans. It is our belief that within the CM theory, its influence\non voting and party identification has been overstated in many\nstudies, particularly those referring to the United States.\nWhereas for Dalton, CM is used as an independent vari-\nable to explain changes in party identification and voting,\nInglehart uses it to explain contemporary political culture in\nterms of participation. However, in both cases, the relation-\nships of causality are hard to establish. In Dalton's terms,\nCM is what explains the changes in participation and party\nidentification, with important criticism, as stated previously.\nIn Inglehart's view, CM is above all a symptom: Structural\nchanges have their correlation in the variation of CM just as\nin changes in values, education, and information. In turn, by\nchanging how citizens perceive and participate in politics (in\nterms of political efficacy), CM has an influence on these\nfactors and on contextual factors. In fact, as has been seen,\nvarious articles refer to these factors as aspects that have not\nbeen sufficiently dealt with in theory and which would\nexplain the differences between countries (political culture,\nhistory, electoral system, or political system) or between dif-\nferent historic moments (electoral polarization, and crisis\nand inflation, which are treated lightly by Inglehart).\nHowever, here we are concerned with an interesting product\nof Inglehart's studies: how political participation takes shape.\nDue to the effect of disassociation with parties, the rise in infor-\nmation and the change in priority in terms of young people's\nvalues (more postmaterialist), electoral participation is not the\nonly form of political expression. Unconventional forms of\npolitical action and the formation of ad hoc structures as a way\nof making demands are more likely in societies with a higher\nlevel of CM. Due to the effects of increased education, the gen-\nerational change means an increase in \"potential\" political par-\nticipation and, more importantly, a drop in the importance of\nsuffrage. For a population that has moved beyond materialist\nvalues, the vote is no longer as important. There are other prior-\nity interests (environment, solidarity, identity) where uncon-\nventional forms of political expression can be used, relegating\nthe vote to a secondary plane. Votes will be used to the extent\nthat the issues at stake in the ballot box will affect what is\nhoped to be achieved according to these new values.\nIn short, for the purposes of this study, the conceptual and\nworking definitions developed by Inglehart in his publica-\ntions are used here. The main virtues of Inglehart's work can\nbe summed up in the following aspects: (a) It incorporates the\nconcept of CM as a \"potential\" political action, conceived as\na central aspect within a broader process of modernization of\nthe political systems; (b) it attends to the different forms of\npolitical action (including unconventional methods); and (c)\nit produces a CM index that does not include its explanatory\ndeterminants (such as the level of education) in its definition\nand introduces two basic elements that point to the classic\ndefinition of democracy and public opinion (frequency of dis-\ncussion about politics and attempts at persuasion), linking the\nindividual level to the group level.\nMethod\nIn his study on European democracies, Inglehart (1990)\nestablishes a series of hypotheses on the effects and evolu-\ntion of CM. He basically considers three hypotheses:\n1. Increased CM reduces the influence that politi-\ncal parties have on public opinion and of citizens'\nidentification with political parties.\n2. Because they are better educated and more\ninformed, young people should show a greater\ndegree of CM. In general, this increased level of\ncognitive political mobilization makes them more\npolitically sophisticated.\n3. A generalized increase in CM and participation is\ncaused by (a) incorporation of women, (b) higher\nlevel of education, and (c) changes in evaluative\npriorities toward individual self-expression, to the\ndetriment of the needs for survival.\nThe second thesis is the subject of validation and study in\nthis analysis, by extending the data series originally used by\nInglehart. We give a detailed consideration of two conclu-\nsions regarding generational change and the process of\npolitical maturation among young people.\n1. Inglehart checks these hypotheses by using Euroba-\ntrend toward greater CM in European societies. In\nterms of cohort analysis, people born after World War\nII who were young in the 1960s are the most politi-\ncally mobilized.Although Inglehart observes the his-\ntorical period that this highly mobilized generation\nlived through (May 1968, mobilizations against the\n4 SAGE Open\nwar in Vietnam, the Prague Spring), he indicates that\nthis maximum is reached through increased access to\ninformation and a higher level of education.\n2. In his second hypothesis on generational change,\nInglehart writes that younger people are less mobi-\nlized because they need a period in which to mature\npolitically and become incorporated into public life.\nA cohort analysis indicates that as young people\n\"mature,\" their CM increases. This is observed in the\nthe second least politicized group in 1973 (they were\nbelow 18 years of age), and who quickly increase in\npolitical mobilization as they become adults, so that\nin 1983 they have become one of the most politicized\ncohorts, practically on a par with the cohort born\nHere, life cycle effects clearly are present \u00adbut they work\nin the opposite direction from than specified by the\n\"aging produces disengagement\" hip\u00f3tesis: People are\nless apt to discuss politics during their preadult years, but\nupon reaching adulthood, the younger and more educated\ncohorts show higher rates of political discusi\u00f3n than do\nthe older cohorts. This explains the anomaly . . . The\nyoungest age group is, at any given point in time, less\npoliticized than some of the older groups not because of\na reversal of trends but because it has not yet reached\nThis article focuses on the hypotheses regarding the\nincrease in CM among young people. Inglehart introduces\ncohort analysis to determine how the progressive global\nincrease in levels of education has an effect on the CM of\nsocieties, in such a way that an increase would be observed\nin the level of politicization because the younger (better edu-\ncated) generations replace less educated cohorts from the\nadult population. Thus, regarding Inglehart's theses, the\nhypotheses to test in this article are the following:\nHypothesis\nHypothesis 1: The CM index is sensitive to political\ncrises. Times of particular political and social unrest\nproduce an increase in CM above the structural\nincreases expected by the effect of the rise in levels\nof education and greater access to information.\nHypothesis 2: Political crises distort the sequence of\npolitical maturation and its relationship with CM,\nwith two effects:\na. In these periods, younger generations reach greater\nlevels of mobilization than generations that have\nreached maturity due to the life cycle.\nb. These periods alter the substitution process (with\nregard to maximum levels of mobilization) of pre-\nvious (less well-educated) cohorts by subsequent\n(better educated) cohorts, as the cohorts that live\nthrough these periods in their youth retain high\nrates of mobilization throughout their lives.\nThese hypotheses are tested for the set of updated data on\nCM that is available in the European Barometer database: in\nthe first hypothesis, using an analysis on admissible cases\nsuch as that of the transition to democracy experienced by\nSouthern European countries in the 1970s (Portugal, Greece,\nand Spain), which reproduce the climate of political inten-\nsity and leave a political mark on a generation, and in the\nsecond, by incorporating data to the series so as to obtain a\nwider time frame than that used by Inglehart.\nIndicators\nCM is such a broad concept that reducing it to only a few indica-\ntors leads to problems. Indeed, in developing his theory, Inglehart\nuses different indicators to explain changes in the societies ana-\nlyzed. In The Silent Revolution, the index (four levels) is obtained\nfrom frequency of discussion and attempts at persuasion (leaving\neducation to one side, as it correlated strongly with income and\noccupation), but in Culture Shift, Inglehart uses \"frequency of\ndiscussion,\" on one hand, for the analysis of cohorts as an indica-\ntor of \"potential political participation\" (not CM), and discussion\nand instruction (five levels), on the other hand, to observe the\ninfluence on \"unconventional political action\" in different coun-\ntries. In fact, the Eurobarometer contains two indexes: CM Index\n1 (discussion and persuasion without instruction; four levels) and\nCM Index 2 (discussion, persuasion, and instruction; five levels).\nIndex 1 has the greatest temporal scope, as it allows the whole\nseries to be established up to the present day.\nThis index is built using the combination of answers to two\nquestions: how often people try to convince others of their own\nopinions (When you hold a strong opinion, do you ever find\nyourself persuading your friends, relatives, or fellow workers\nto share your views? If so, does this happen often, from time to\ntime, or rarely?) and how often political issues are discussed\n(When you get together with your friends, would you say you\ndiscuss political matters frequently, occasionally, or never?)\n(Table 1).\nThe combination of these two questions (talking about\npolitics and trying to convince) creates four levels of CM. The\nhighest of these represents those who show the greatest degree\nof mobilization and participation in social life, and the two\nintermediary levels refer to qualities of cognitive political par-\nticipation above and below the average. The lowest refers to\nthose with minimal social participation. Dichotomizing the\nindex into two large categories produces \"medium-high and\nhigh CM\" and \"medium-low and low CM.\" The indicator\ndirectly expresses the degree of participation in political dis-\ncussion spontaneously and individually, without it being\nAlaminos and Penalva 5\nregulated or institutionalized. However, it is associated with\nthe expected characteristics: Those with greater capacity for\npolitical mobilization also show greater interest in politics and\na high level of education and media usage.\nWe used the indicators that the Eurobarometer produced\nfrom their theoretical contributions and empirical tests. The\nCM indicator resulting from the discussion on the concept in\nrecent decades is set out in summarized form. As indicated\nabove, although the importance of the level of education is\nassumed as an indicator of political competence and capac-\nity, the Eurobarometer dispenses with this variable due to its\nassociation with other factors that explain CM, such as social\nclass.\nHowever, the CM index that the Eurobarometer uses\nallows us to conduct empirical tests from the same data\nsource that Inglehart used. In operative terms, this indicator\nseparates the causes that lead to CM (education and informa-\ntion) from mobilization in itself and is backed up by\nInglehart's initial definitions regarding direct political par-\nticipation in the agora as a place to debate public issues.\nInglehart gives priority to variables that measure participa-\ntion by means of conversation and discussion with others,\nand considers that this is a better indicator of activism than\nelectoral participation figures. The Eurobarometer surveys\ninclude the variables \"frequency of discussion on political\nissues\" and \"trying to convince others of one's own opin-\nion,\" thus qualifying (objective) conversation with a motiva-\ntional element, expressed by the intent to convince others of\none's own opinion. This then is a definition of a specific con-\ncept of participation that inserts debate about politics within\nthe context of everyday life. This is why it is also used to\ndetect \"opinion leaders,\" which in a way alludes to the notion\nof transmitting political information in two steps (Lazarsfeld,\nBerelson, & Gaudet, 1944), without the involvement of\nmediating bodies such as political parties.\nAn important advance in Inglehart's CM indicator is that\neducation has been removed when creating the indicator.\nEducation ensures that people are enabled to interpret infor-\nmation coming from the media. It is clear that the role the\nmedia play in forming attitudes and opinions and in inter-\npersonal communication varies from one sociocultural\ncontext to another. The media's influence differs widely\ndepending on citizens'level of education, which by theoretical\nassociation with CM brings the problem of interdependence\non other variables such as social class. This identification\ncan be observed in other very similar concepts, such as the\npolitical sophistication of MacDonald, Rabinowitz, and\nDalton (1984) produces an index using the variables of edu-\ncation (degree of competence) and interest in politics\n(involvement and participation). Inglehart also initially\nincludes level of education and participation in political dis-\nan index of CM. A society's level of education is incorpo-\nrated into how the index is built because of the strong asso-\nciation between education and other indicators used to build\nthe CM index. This makes several authors conclude that the\nlevel of education should be included in the index, despite\nappear to be a particularly useful contribution because the\ndifferent meanings of the level of education indicator mean\nthat it relates to three different socioeconomic indicators:\ncompetence and the objective education of individuals,\nsocial class/status, and socialization (Cassel & Lo, 1997). In\nall cases, the importance placed on interaction between indi-\nviduals is a constant in the design of indicators of CM.\nAnother concept incorporated into the hypothesis test is\nthat of crisis. A crisis is a moment in which the occurrence of\na certain event with a certain degree of \"impact\" provokes\nhigh commotion in the population. In etic terms, political cri-\nses would be moments, within a broad spectrum of phenom-\nena, in which a substantial political change occurs, or there is\nmajor debate about the possibility of such a change, (a) of\ninternal origin: regime change, reforms in the system, politi-\ncal changes of a territorial nature, and economic reforms or\n(b) of external origin (with regard to other countries), the\nresult of which ranges from diplomatic tension to military\nintervention.\nYet, however hard we try to complete and fine-tune this\ntypology, it comes up against a phenomenological (emic)\nargument. Because these events have a major impact, the\nquestion of the perception of these occurrences is a central\none. And because this is a question of perception, how citi-\nzens interpret information becomes hugely relevant. In this\nsense, the mass media play a key role (their influence is indi-\nrect, as the meaning belongs to the receiver) and indicators\ncould be used (monitoring the media, where the events are\nplaced in news media, emphasis measures--number of news\nand information items, font size, presence of images). These\naspects have been discussed in a previous article (Alaminos\n& Penalva, 2010), in which the mass communication theory,\nparticularly the agenda-setting theory and the framing the-\nory, is highly useful.\nBuilding political climate indexes on the bases of media\nindicators (press distribution, content analysis, user num-\nbers) for each country considered goes beyond the objectives\nTable 1.

However, we find it hard to question certain\nmoments of history as political crises according to previous\nattempts to classify them: the European cultural revolutions\nof the late 1960s, the transitions to democratic regimes in\nSouthern Europe in the second half of the 1970s, and the fall\nData and Sources\nThe data used is drawn from the Eurobarometers.1 It is impor-\ntant to note that more years are considered than those studied\nby Inglehart and the data that the author used are included in\nthe study. In this sense, the study replicates and extends his\nanalysis. The Eurobarometer is a survey conducted in several\nEuropean countries. For many years, the inclusion criteria\nwere for the country to belong to the European Economic\nCommunity or the EU. However, the survey was extended to\ncountries whose entry into the EU was pending. It is con-\nducted every 4 months and with an average sample size of\n1,000 interviews per country, a figure that varies depending\non the population.\nIn particular, this work studies the effects on CM in two\nhistoric stages of notable political, social, and cultural unrest\nthat had an extraordinary effect on various European societ-\nies: the mobilizations that occurred at the end of the 1960s in\nEuropean countries with democratic regimes, typified by\nFrance in May 1968, and the mobilizations that occurred\nduring the process of political transition in Mediterranean\ncountries whose autocratic regimes came to an end in the\nmid-1970s (Greece, Portugal, and Spain).\nResults\nThe results are presented as a graphic analysis. For each\ncountry, the distribution of relative frequencies of CM is\ncharted each year in 10-year cohorts. The distributions are\narranged in yearly intervals. In this way, it is possible to\nappreciate trends and inflections in the replacement of\ncohorts, and the structural relationship between them for each\nyear. Each cohort is defined by the following age intervals, in\n74, and more than 74. Thus, graphical analysis (in a yearly\nbase) is useful to appreciate cohort, period and aging effects.\nThe data is shown in three charts. Figures 1 and 2 show the\ntwo types of models (general patterns of evolution of CM and\nspecific patterns of transition, respectively), and Figure 3\nshows a mixed model of the Federal Republic of Germany\nand the landmark of unification in 1989, which can be com-\npared with the processes of transition experienced by the\ndemocracies of Southern Europe.\nThe growing trend of CM indices and the postwar generation.\nIn general terms, the new data validate Inglehart's hypothe-\nses. In the past four decades, the increase in the level of edu-\ncation and the growth of and increased access to the media\nhave been accompanied by an increase in the level of CM.\nThe trend is clear and the hypothesis is partially confirmed.\nA rising trend can be observed in all the European countries\nconsidered. The cohorts born in postwar Europe are consid-\nerably more mobilized than those born before World War II.\nHowever, no sustained growth in mobilization can be\nobserved with each new cohort. On the contrary, the genera-\ntion of the 1960s reaches a landmark in mobilization with\nregard to new generations, who have lower levels of partici-\npation. The maximums detected by Inglehart in the genera-\ntion born in the postwar period distort this trend. These are\nremarkably high percentages of CM, leading to a series of\nconsiderations. First, it should be observed that they coincide\nwith a particularly \"hot\" moment in history in terms of the\npolitical climate, which was characterized by a general atmo-\nsphere of social and cultural revolution throughout Europe,\nexpressed in the form of mass protests (the war in Vietnam,\nMay 1968 in France, the Prague Spring), and in changes in\ncustoms and social norms, of which the main protagonists\nwere the younger generations. Second, it can be seen how\nthis distortion is prolonged in its effects, as the cohort in\nquestion maintains high rates of political mobilization dur-\ning the following decades, due to having experienced the\nmost intense era of political socialization in those socially\nconvulsive years. Thus, their high exposure to social and\npolitical participation remains and revolutionizes the genera-\ntional structure. Subsequent generations tend to show less\nparticipation (due to there being fewer left-wing and other\nsociopolitical characteristics).\nA very similar change dynamic, but with a different his-\ntoric origin, can be observed in the countries that lived\nthrough the transition to a democratic regime in the 1970s.\nThe process of maturation and new generational distortions\n(Greece, Portugal, and Spain). For Inglehart, the process of\npolitical maturation among young people raises their CM\nwhen they reach sufficient political competence. The effect\nof this maturation can be observed in the \"horseshoe\" shape\nof the time frame that marks the highest CM in cohorts aged\nPortugal, Greece, and Spain, a generational delay can be\nseen, in the extent to which the most participatory generation\nis that aged 14 to 24 years at the time of the political transi-\ntion to democracy. The general process leads from an ordered\nlinear generational structure in the functional relationship\nwith CM to another horseshoe-shaped form (nonmonotonic\nlinear). The stability of the generational position in the\n30-year period considered makes it possible to see the matu-\nration process and change of position in the life cycle. The\ncases of Greece and Spain experience a process of character-\nistically horseshoe-shaped transformation, with young peo-\nple less participatory than those of the transition and a lesser\nvariability among generations that can be seen when the seg-\nments are shortened. The case of Portugal is an exception.\nYoung people maintain a high level of participation and the\ntrend is one of increased variability between generations, as\ncan be observed in the growth of the segment.\nAlaminos and Penalva 7\nFrance\nYears\n%\nYears\n%\nYears\n%\nFigure 1.

The matu-\nration and life cycle effect means that this cohort, which is at\nsuch a low level, 10 years later reaches a similar level to that\nof the previous cohort. As previously in other European\ncountries with regard to the generation of 1968, the genera-\ntions that were politically socialized in the transition to\ndemocracy maintain a higher level of CM than those that\nsucceed them.

This will\nhave a clear statistical effect, first by weakening and then by\nbreaking the association between age and CM. Each country\nshows specific features associated with the crises described.\nHowever, this maturation process that marks a level of\npolitical participation associated with the life cycle displays\nnuances in moments of crisis. This can be observed by study-\ning generational patterns in certain moments of political\nupheaval, where younger people have the highest levels of\nmobilization. This is the case of Germany in the early 1990s\nafter the fall of the Berlin wall and the reunification process,\nof France with the disturbances in Paris protesting the situa-\ntion of the immigrant population, and of Spain following the\nIn the transnational dimension, with the data from 1982,\nInglehart saw Greece as an atypical case: a country with a low\neconomic level but high CM. He defined this as a \"striking\ndeviant case\" in his cross-sectional analysis and interpreted it\nas an effect of the influence of the tradition of the former city-\nstate democracies. The effect of the period of transition to\ndemocracy, which was not considered by Inglehart, could be\na better explanation and could also explain the historical\nmaximums found in our analysis: the generation that was\nyoung in the political climate of 1968 records a maximum\nlevel. Subsequent generations, with higher levels of mobiliza-\ntion than those born after World War II, tend to be compara-\ntively lower than those of 1968. The same occurs for the\ngenerations that lived through those times of transition to\ndemocracy in the countries considered.\nWe present a mixed model, between the postwar society\ntype of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, and the soci-\nety in transition type of Greece, Portugal, and Spain. The\nFederal Republic of Germany shows patterns from both\nmodels, which strengthens the hypothesis. On one hand,\nthere is a trend of increasing political mobilization among\nsuccessive postwar generations, with a sharp increase in\nmobilization scores for the generation involved in the 1968\nmobilizations. On the other hand, the early 1990s show a\nchange in the basic horseshoe shape in the change of cohorts,\nwith an increase in mobilization observed in younger genera-\ntions, canceling out the process of political maturation. This\nis a politically hot moment reflecting the reunification pro-\ncess after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nIn this work, as well as the general trend of modernization\nthat can be seen in all the societies studied, it is also possible\nto observe the foreseeable anomalies of each case, reflecting\nthe historical political circumstance of each country.\nInglehart's hypotheses are subtly altered. The advantages of\nhaving a longer historical series than that which the author\nused means that we can state that the historic period at the\nYears\n%\nFigure 3.

By taking other historic moments of increased politi-\ncal tension, we can state that the period effect explains the\ntrends more precisely, and explains the anomalies that Inglehart\nfound, as is the case for Greece. He interpreted this anomaly\nas the repercussion of the country's classical tradition linked\nto political discussion in the agora.\nWe consider that in his works, Inglehart gave sufficient\nconsideration to two of the three effects considered in cohort\nanalysis: that of maturation (in terms of the process of acquir-\ning political competence) and that of cohort (which explains\nhow patterns of mobilization are maintained depending on the\ntime in history when political socialization is most intense).\nHowever, he underestimated the importance of time period.\nThe period effect affects society as a whole, corresponding to\nan exceptional political or social climate. We know it is not\npossible to determine the effect that, independently, can be\nattributed to the period, age, or cohort.As Glenn (2005) states,\nthe effect of cohort (C, year of birth), the effect of age (A, year\nsince birth), and period (P, current year) are linear and addi-\ntive. Separated effects can not be estimated.\nTo illustrate the effect of the period and its interaction\nwith cohort and maturation, this article includes similar\npolitical situations (in terms of the intensity of the political\nclimate and its effects on political participation in general)\nsuch as the political transition of the European countries con-\nsidered (Greece, Portugal, and Spain). Thus, considering this\neffect, Inglehart's conclusions must be modified, as it can be\nconfirmed that the historical maximum in CM of the genera-\ntion of 1968 is due to the atypical context of the political\nclimate.\nThus, even though CM effectively defines a potential for\nparticipation, whether this is activated depends on the con-\ntext. Political crises raise the level of mobilization in general,\nbut this increase occurs to a greater extent in younger cohorts,\nwho are more qualified in cognitive terms. The level of\nmobilization shows a growing trend for a set of countries\nthat already had high levels of mobilization. For another set\nof countries, it can be seen how this average level tends to\nremain stable, with changes in growth and contraction that\ncoincide with \"hot\" periods or political crises. In this sense,\nit is not appropriate to consider as a general thesis that\nincreases in the number of citizens with CM capacities are a\ndirect and mechanical consequence of conditions such as\neducation, available media, or economic development.\nRather, for certain countries, CM (talking about and discuss-\ning politics with other citizens) develops circumstantially,\ndepending on the sociopolitical context and climate. Within\nthe average level of mobilization displayed by society, it can\nbe seen how the indicator is sensitive to the most relevant\ncrises, leading to discontinuous trends and altering the pro-\ncess of political maturation. With the consideration of con-\ntextual and circumstantial factors, the CM index would\nshow greater utility when diagnosing, understanding, and\nforeseeing social mobilizations, as it considers a key element\nof its theoretical definition to be direct democracy and the\nconsideration of unconventional forms of participation,\nwhich are more present at times of crisis.\nTherefore, by introducing the period element, two of\nInglehart's statements need modifying: the first, which states\nthat the level of education automatically has an influence on\nlevels of CM by raising participation as a structural pattern,\nand the second, which considers the life cycle as a necessary\nelement of political maturation. Inglehart's theses do not\ngive sufficient consideration to CM as a potential that is acti-\nvated by reacting to circumstances to the point of producing\nfunctional discontinuous patterns in the relationship between\nage and CM, as well as distortions in the process of political\nmaturation and its relationship with the life cycle.2 Certain\nhistoric events mobilize younger generations who, according\nto Inglehart, should not have reached that level of political\nmaturity. These crises clearly mark the trends of mobiliza-\ntion for all his biography, as these events coincide with the\nera of greatest political socialization. As can be deduced in\nthe analysis, \"testing\" the direct democracy that Inglehart\nspoke of at times when the process of socialization (youth) is\nat its most intense allows tools and knowledge of political\npractice to be acquired that will be retained for the rest of\none's life. This political learning is supported by the cogni-\ntive basis of education and information but reinforces the\npragmatic (rational) dimension of \"political efficacy\" and\nthe identity (emotional) dimension due to the links within a\ngroup acquired in that generational experience.\nThere are a series of works that deals with a closely\nrelated concept, namely \"political generation,\" as discussed\nby Mannheim, which links the political experiences of each\ncohort in the most intense periods of socialization, as youth\ntends to be. We have found some studies that discuss the phe-\nnomenon of political socialization by linking the period and\ncohort effects, such as the works by Cavalli (2004), Hooghe\n(2004), Hadjar and Beck. As stated by Hooghe,\nIn this view, primary socialisation experiences tend to\nproduce persistent effects, which are only marginally\ninfluenced by later socialisation experiences. This\nconcept of persistent political self-identification is of\ncourse nothing new, as it already was formulated in\nKarl Mannheim's classical thesis on the creation of\n\"political generations\" by what he called generation-\nHadjar and Beck (2010) also clearly explain this relation-\nship between experiences of political crises and period effects:\nPeriod effects are expressions of societal events,\npolitical developments, value climate and societal\nconditions, both on the structural and ideological level\nthat affect all birth cohorts in a specific country . . .\nCauses of period effects may be very polarising election\nAlaminos and Penalva 11\ncampaigns, the introduction of controversial laws,\nunemployment, or a general distance from politicians\nafter political scandals.

Detailed knowledge of the phenomenon could put\nan end to the confusion detected by various authors between\ncause (elements that give shape to a potential mobilization)\nand effects (mobilization at a specific time).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was made possible by a grant from the Ministry of Education,\nGovernment of Spain in the 2010 official announcement:\" Estancias\nde profesores e investigadores seniors en centrosextranjeros de\nNotes\n2.

Inglehart concludes that although its influence\nshould be taken into account, differentiating between the three\neffects (age, cohort, and period) is a very hard task.\nReferences\nAlaminos, A., & Penalva, C.
