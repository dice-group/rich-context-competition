So they treated them like corporate or sovereign\nbonds and relied solely on the agencies' ratings. The use of the same rating scale for CDO\ntranches and corporate bonds by the rating agencies obviously hid that there is a significantly\ndifferent risk profile also at the same credit rating with regard to the systematic risk.\nStructured finance instruments appeared very attractive to investors as they could choose\nbetween different risk/return profiles. Moreover, CDO tranches tended to offer more yield\nthan corporate bonds or loans with similar ratings.\nAmong CDOs, \"arbitrage CDOs\" in particular have recorded enormous growth. Arbitrage\nCDOs attempt to produce a surplus from the collateral pool's acquired assets on the one hand,\nand from the tranches sold to the investors after securitization on the other hand. In the\npresent paper we discuss potential CDO arbitrage opportunities due to mispricing. For this\npurpose the risk profiles of CDO tranches are analysed in some detail. The analyses presented\nhere reveal significant risk profile differences between CDOs and corporate bonds which have\nfar-reaching consequences for risk management, pricing and regulatory capital requirements.\nParticularly due to the increased sensitivity to systematic risks, CDOs become much riskier\ninvestments than comparable corporate bonds. This results inter alia in rapid and drastic\nrating downgrades once the underlying economic environment comes under stress. Another\nmajor consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic risks. The considerably\nincreased systematic risk of CDO tranches needs to be compensated for by a significantly\nhigher spread than is usually paid for corporate bonds. If investors do not appreciate the\nincreased systematic risk, this offers arbitrage opportunities for the CDO issuers.\nCoval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a, b) and Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) analyse similar aspects of a\npossible mispricing of CDO tranches. As in the present paper, the authors argue that investors\nwho solely rely on the rating generally pay a too high price for the CDO tranches. According\nto Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this is especially true for senior tranches which default just\nwhen the economy is in a very bad state. If a broad equity index is used as a proxy for the\nmarket factor, option prices can be used. Using special options on the S&P 500 index with\ncomparable systematic risks, the authors show empirically that the highly rated tranches of the\nCDX index exhibit market spreads that are significantly too low. By contrast, the results\nobtained by Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) indicate that the AAA-rated tranches are only\nmarginally mispriced, and that the highest profits can be gained with junior tranches.\nIn contrast to these papers we attempt to quantify the size of the CDOs' sensitivity to\nsystematic risks as precisely as possible, while keeping the model framework relatively\nsimple. For this, a single factor model is assumed for the collateral pool assets, and the loss\ndistribution is calculated. Then each of the expected tranche losses are analysed conditional\non the market factor realisations. It turns out that expected loss curve conditional on the\nmarket factor (EL profile) is much steeper for unfavourable market factor values than for a\nbond with a comparable rating or for the collateral pool. This expresses the greatly increased\nsensitivity of the tranches to systematic risk. In the next step, the asset correlation associated\nwith a CDO tranche is estimated treating the structured instrument as a single-name credit\ninstrument (i.e., a loan equivalent). While tractable, the loan-equivalent approach requires\nappropriate parameterization to achieve a reasonable approximation of the tranche\u00b4s risk\nprofile. We consider the tranche as a \"virtual\" borrower or bond for which a single-factor\nmodel holds. Then, the correlation parameter is calculated via a non-linear optimization. This\n\"bond representation\" allows to approximate the risk profile (expressed by the EL profile)\nusing a single-factor model and to express the dependence on the systematic risk factor via\nthe corresponding asset correlation. It turns out that the resulting asset correlation is many\ntimes higher than that of ordinary bonds. In the next step a pricing model which depends\nexplicitly on the asset correlation as a measure of systematic risk is implemented for the CDO\ntranches. CDO arbitrage opportunities are then described using a sample CDO portfolio. It is\nassumed that investors are guided solely by the tranches' rating and ignore the increased\nsystematic risk. We subsequently show how tranches with high systematic risk can be\ngenerated and describe how CDO arrangers can exploit this to their advantage. It comes as no\nsurprise that precisely these types of structures featured in many of the CDOs issued prior to\nthe outbreak of the financial crisis.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie Informationsasymmetrie zwischen den Originatoren von komplexen strukturierten\nKreditprodukten wie CDOs und den Investoren wurde massiv verst\u00e4rkt durch die mangelnde\nVerf\u00fcgbarkeit zeitnaher Daten zu den Collateral Pools. Auch f\u00fcr Investoren mit dem\nnotwendigen Knowhow war es nicht m\u00f6glich, eine umfassende Bewertung und Risikoanalyse\nder strukturierten Produkte vorzunehmen. Viele Investoren haben CDO-Tranchen wie\nCorporate oder Sovereign Bonds betrachtet und sich vollst\u00e4ndig auf die Ratings der Produkte\nverlassen. Die Verwendung derselben Ratingskala f\u00fcr CDO-Tranchen und Corporate Bonds\ndurch die Ratingagenturen hat offensichtlich verschleiert, dass auch bei gleichem Rating ein\nsignifikant unterschiedliches Risikoprofil hinsichtlich des systematischen Risikos vorliegt. Da\ndie Investoren entsprechend ihrem Rendite-/Risikoprofil aus verschiedenen Tranchen\nausw\u00e4hlen konnten und dar\u00fcber hinaus die strukturierten Produkte anf\u00e4nglich h\u00f6here Spreads\nzahlten, erschienen sie sehr attraktiv.\nBei den CDOs haben insbesondere die ,,Arbitrage-CDOs\" ein enormes Wachstum\nverzeichnet. Arbitrage-CDOs versuchen einen \u00dcberschuss aus den erworbenen Assets des\nCollateral Pools einerseits und den nach der Strukturierung an die Investoren verkauften\nTranchen andererseits zu erzielen. F\u00fcr das Zustandekommen der CDO-Arbitrage gibt es in\nder Literatur unterschiedliche Begr\u00fcndungen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird untersucht, wie\ndurch Fehlbepreisungen M\u00f6glichkeiten zur CDO-Arbitrage entstehen. Hierzu werden die\nRisikoprofile von CDO-Tranchen im Detail untersucht und potentielle Unterschiede zu\nCorporate Bonds mit vergleichbaren Ratings genauer \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Die vorgestellten Analysen\nzeigen signifikante Differenzen im Risikoprofil zwischen CDOs und Corporate Bonds,\nwelche weitreichende Konsequenzen in Bezug auf Risikomanagement, Bepreisung und\nregulatorische Eigenkapitalanforderungen haben. Dies betrifft vor allem die deutlich erh\u00f6hte\nSensitivit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber systematischen Risiken. Dadurch werden CDOs zu wesentlich\nriskanteren Investments als vergleichbare Corporate Bonds. Eine Konsequenz sind rapide und\ndrastische Rating\u00e4nderungen (Downgrades), wenn die \u00f6konomischen Rahmenbedingungen\nunter Stress geraten. Eine weitere wichtige Konsequenz, die f\u00fcr eine inad\u00e4quate Bepreisung\nausschlaggebend ist, ergibt sich aus der Preisrelevanz des systematischen Risikos. Das\ndeutlich erh\u00f6hte systematische Risiko der CDO-Tranchen muss durch einen signifikant\nh\u00f6heren Spread, als f\u00fcr Corporate Bonds gezahlt wird, kompensiert werden.\n\u00c4hnliche Aspekte einer m\u00f6glichen Fehlbepreisung von CDO-Tranchen untersuchen Coval et\nal. (2009a,b) und Brennan et al. (2009). Wie im vorliegenden Paper argumentieren die\nAutoren, dass Investoren, die sich lediglich am Rating orientieren, in der Regel einen zu\nhohen Preis f\u00fcr die CDO-Tranchen bezahlen. Gem\u00e4\u00df Coval et al. (2009a) gilt dies im\nbesonderen Ma\u00dfe f\u00fcr die Senior-Tranchen, die gerade dann ausfallen, wenn sich die\n\u00d6konomie in einem sehr schlechten Zustand befindet. Diese Zust\u00e4nde haben jedoch einen\nhohen marginalen Nutzen und die zugeh\u00f6rigen Zustandspreise sollten gem\u00e4\u00df der\nArrow/Debreu-Theorie hoch sein. Anhand spezieller Optionen auf einen Marktindex mit\nvergleichbaren systematischen Risiken zeigen sie, dass die hoch gerateten Tranchen des CDX\nIndex signifikant zu niedrige Marktspreads aufweisen. Im Gegensatz dazu finden Brennan et\nal. (2009) heraus, dass die AAA-Tranchen nur geringf\u00fcgig fehlbepreist sind und dass die\nh\u00f6chsten Gewinne bei der Tranchierung mit den riskanteren Junior-Tranchen erzielt werden\nk\u00f6nnen.\nIm Unterschied zu den beiden Arbeiten wird im vorliegenden Beitrag versucht, die\nGr\u00f6\u00dfenordnung der Sensitivit\u00e4t von CDOs gegen\u00fcber systematischen Risiken m\u00f6glichst exakt\nzu quantifizieren. Dabei soll der Modellrahmen m\u00f6glichst einfach gehalten werden. Hierzu\nwird f\u00fcr die Assets des Collateral Pools ein Ein-Faktor-Modell unterstellt und die\nVerlustverteilung ermittelt. Dann werden die erwarteten Verluste der Tranchen jeweils\nbedingt auf die Realisierungen des Marktfaktors analysiert. Die bedingte Expected-Loss-\nKurve (EL-Profil) wird mit Hilfe einer Simulation ermittelt. Im n\u00e4chsten Schritt wird die\nAssetkorrelation einer CDO-Tranche gesch\u00e4tzt. Dabei wird die Tranche als ,,fiktiver\"\nSchuldner bzw. Bond aufgefasst, f\u00fcr den approximativ ebenfalls ein Ein-Faktor-Modell gilt.\nDie Approximation wird so vorgenommen, dass das simulierte EL-Profil m\u00f6glichst gut\nnachgestellt wird, und der Korrelationsparameter wird mit Hilfe einer nichtlinearen\nOptimierung ermittelt. Durch die ,,Bond-Repr\u00e4sentation\" gelingt es, das Risikoprofil von\nCDO-Tranchen mit Hilfe eines Ein-Faktor-Modells zu approximieren und die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit\nvom systematischen Risikofaktor durch den entsprechenden Korrelationsparameter\nauszudr\u00fccken. Die resultierende Assetkorrelation ist um ein Vielfaches h\u00f6her als f\u00fcr\ngew\u00f6hnliche Bonds. Dann wird f\u00fcr die CDO-Tranchen ein Preismodell implementiert. Hierzu\nwird die risikoneutrale Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit mit Hilfe des strukturellen\nFirmenwertmodells ermittelt und in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von der realen Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit\nund dem systematischen Risiko spezifiziert, wobei die G\u00fcltigkeit des (zeitstetigen) CAPM\nunterstellt wird. Danach werden anhand eines Beispiel-CDOs M\u00f6glichkeiten zur ,,CDO-\nArbitrage\" beschrieben, wenn sich die Investoren nur am Rating der Tranchen orientieren und\ndas erh\u00f6hte systematische Risiko au\u00dfer Acht lassen. Schlie\u00dflich wird im letzten Kapitel die\nKonstruktion von Tranchen mit hohem systematischen Risiko dargestellt und beschrieben,\nwie dies von den CDO-Arrangeuren zu ihren Gunsten ausgen\u00fctzt werden kann. Es ist nicht\n\u00fcberraschend, dass gerade derartige Strukturen in vielen der in der Zeit vor Ausbruch der\nKrise emittierten CDOs zu finden sind.\nContents\n2 A framework for credit modelling and valuation 5\n3 Tranching and reallocating risks 11\n3.1 Tranching and rating-based risk measures ..................................... 11\n3.2 The systematic risk of CDO tranches............................................ 12\n4 Valuation of tranches and CDO arbitrage 20\n5 Generating tranches with high systematic risk 23\n5.1 Increasing the number of assets in the collateral pool......................... 23\n5.2 Inclusion of assets with a high systematic risk in the collateral pool........ 25\n5.3 Creating as many tranchelets as possible ....................................... 26\n6 Discussion and conclusion 28\nSystematic Risk of CDOs and CDO Arbitrage*\n1 Introduction\nThe technique of securitisation allows to transfer a portfolio of illiquid assets or the default\nrisks associated with the assets to the structured credit markets using various credit transfer\ninstruments and to distribute much of the underlying credit risk to end-investors. This led to a\ndramatic rise in the market for credit transfer instruments, especially Credit Default Swaps\n(CDS) und Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). For example, the volume of outstanding\nCDS has increased more than tenfold over the past few years.\nAmong CDOs, \"arbitrage CDOs\" in particular have recorded enormous growth.

The views expressed\nhere are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nArbitrage\nBalance Sheet\n(source: SIFMA)\nIn the case of arbitrage CDOs, there is a sharp increase until the beginning of the financial\ncorrespondingly large volume of loans had to be granted in order to generate this high volume\nof CDOs, with loans with higher yields (and greater risks) being preferred. This created a\nhuge leap in the demand for subprime loans. CDO trusts were constantly looking for BBB-\nrated MBS (mortgage backed securities) bonds, which offered relatively high yields. The\nCDO trust could finance their purchase by issuing highly rated CDO bonds (tranches) paying\nlower yields. The business was so lucrative that there were insufficient MBS bonds in\ncirculation to form CDO collateral pools in 2006 and 2007. A solution was found with the\nintroduction of credit default swaps on asset-backed securities (ABS CDS). The result was a\nlarge number of CDO collateral pools \"topped up\" with synthetic MBS bonds (MBS CDS).\nThis environment encouraged questionable practices by some lenders, and lead to a dramatic\nfall in credit lending standards that was often described in the media.1\n1 For a description of the chronology and causes of the financial crisis, see, for example, Crouhy et al (2008),\nThe valuation by rating agencies is crucial for complex structured finance instruments such as\nCDOs. Due to their complexity, however, it is difficult to rate CDOs. The waterfall structures\nand loss distributions are always different and have to be analysed and simulated on an\nindividual basis. Also, many collateral pools contain synthetic ABS CDS, which increases the\ndifficulty in rating these assets.\nA further problem is the information asymmetry between the originators of the structured\nfinance instruments and the investors. Generally, data on the collateral pools are not available\non an individual basis, except for synthetic CDOs with corporate CDSs in the collateral pool.\nAs the database had not been disclosed, investors had no reliable basis upon which to quantify\nthe risks of these securities, and even investors with the necessary knowledge were not able to\nconduct an extensive valuation and risk analysis of the structured instruments. They had to\nalmost completely rely on the agencies' ratings. Even though the regulatory authorities have\npointed out that the use of ratings does not excuse investors from conducting their own risk\nanalyses, many of them relied in practice purely on external ratings for valuing structured\ncredit products (see Bank of England, 2007). Many investors regarded CDO tranches like\ncorporate or sovereign bonds with the same rating and, in particular, also equated their risks\nwith those of bonds.\nStructured finance instruments appeared very attractive to investors as they could choose\nbetween different risk/return profiles. Moreover, CDO tranches tended to offer more yield\nthan corporate bonds or loans with similar ratings. This price advantage did not last, however.\nBetween 2005 and the beginning of the subprime crisis, rising investor confidence in the new\nasset class led to a rising demand. Thus the spread differences narrowed and CDOs and\ncorporate bonds with comparable ratings were quoted at almost equal prices (see\nIn this paper, the risk profiles of CDO tranches are analysed in some detail and potential\ndifferences to corporate bonds that have comparable ratings are examined more closely. The\nanalyses presented here reveal significant risk profile differences between CDOs and\ncorporate bonds which have far-reaching consequences for risk management, pricing and\nregulatory capital requirements. Particularly due to the increased sensitivity to systematic\nrisks CDOs become much riskier investments than comparable corporate bonds. This results\ninter alia in rapid and drastic rating downgrades once the underlying economic environment\ncomes under stress. Another major consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic\nrisks. The considerably increased systematic risk of CDO tranches needs to be compensated\nfor by a significantly higher spread than is usually paid for corporate bonds. If investors do\nnot appreciate the increased systematic risk, this offers arbitrage opportunities for the CDO\nissuers.\nCoval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a,b) and Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) analyse similar aspects of a\npossible mispricing of CDO tranches. As in the present paper, the authors argue that investors\nwho solely rely on the rating generally pay a too high price for the CDO tranches. According\nto Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this is especially true for senior tranches which default just\nwhen the economy is in a very bad state. These states have a high marginal utility, however,\nand according to the Arrow-Debreu theory, the associated state prices should be high. If a\nbroad equity index is used as a proxy for the market factor, option prices can be used. When\nthe index does exhibit such unfavourable conditions, the \"volatility skew\" becomes important,\nand investors should be entitled to an additional spread for bearing this risk. Using special\noptions on the S&P 500 index with comparable systematic risks, the authors show empirically\nthat the highly rated tranches of the CDX index exhibit market spreads that are significantly\ntoo low. By contrast, Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) find that the AAA-rated tranches are only\nmarginally mispriced, and that the highest profits can be gained with junior tranches.\nIn line with these two articles we also see limited risk assessment of CDO tranches prior to\nthe crisis. Market participants based their investment decisions on a tranche's rating grade and\notherwise assumed default behaviour like that of straight bonds, in particular concerning the\nexposure to systematic risks. As a consequence non-equity CDO tranches were overvalued. In\ncontrast to these articles, our objective is not precisely quantify the degree of mispricing in the\nCDO market. Instead we concentrate on an illustrative presentation of differences in the\ndefault behaviour of corporate bonds and CDO tranches using a single-factor model\nframework, which can be derived from a simple analytical valuation model based on the\nCAPM and the Merton model. This allows developing a parsimonious pricing approach. As it\nrelates directly to the mentioned differences between bonds and CDO tranches and because of\nits less complicated structure it sheds light on the consequences of possible misjudgements\nconcerning the risk properties of CDO tranches. By applying our valuation model on a sample\narbitrage CDO transaction, we conclude that there is no CDO arbitrage possible as long as\ninvestors take the special default behaviour of CDO tranches into account. However, if\ninvestors base their investment decisions solely on the ratings of the CDO tranches, this\ncreates a market environment that allows CDO arrangers to gain some kind of arbitrage profit.\nIn contrast to the above mentioned papers, here we attempt to quantify the size of the CDOs'\nsensitivity to systematic risks. For this purpose we analyse the expected tranche loss of a\nCDO tranche conditional on the market factor realisations (EL profile). In the next step, the\nasset correlation associated with a CDO tranche is estimated treating the structured instrument\nas a single-name credit instrument (i.e., a loan equivalent). While tractable, the loan-\nequivalent approach requires appropriate parameterization to achieve a reasonable\napproximation of the tranche\u00b4s risk profile. We consider the tranche as a \"virtual\" borrower or\nbond for which a single-factor model holds. Then, the correlation parameter is estimated via\nan approximation of the EL profile. This \"bond representation\" allows to approximate the risk\nprofile using a single-factor model and to express the dependence on the systematic risk factor\nvia the corresponding asset correlation. It turns out that the resulting asset correlation is many\ntimes higher than that of ordinary bonds. Then, the CDO tranches are priced by applying the\nvaluation model to their corresponding bond representations. In the following section,\nopportunities for \"CDO arbitrage\" are described using a sample CDO portfolio. It is assumed\nthat investors are guided solely by the tranches' rating and ignore the increased systematic\nrisk. We show how tranches with high systematic risk can be generated and describe how\nCDO arrangers can exploit this to their advantage. It comes as no surprise that precisely these\ntypes of structures featured in many of the CDOs issued prior to the outbreak of the financial\ncrisis.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple analytic valuation\nmodel based on the CAPM and the single-factor Merton model of debt pricing. Section 3\ndiscusses pooling and tranching and reallocating risks. First, rating-based risk measures are\npresented. Then, the \"bond representation\" treating a CDO tranche as a single-name credit\ninstrument is described. Section 4 illustrates tranche valuation and CDO arbitrage. In section\n5 is analysed how tranches with high systematic risk can be generated, and how CDO issuers\ncan exploit this to their advantage. A discussion and conclusion is given in section 6.\n2 A framework for credit modelling and valuation\nCollateral pools of structured finance transactions are typically composed of assets like e. g.\nloans, bonds or CDS contracts. The risk properties of portfolio derivatives such as CDOs are\ninfluenced by the default behaviour of the collateral pool's assets. Thus, modelling credit risk\nof plain vanilla credit instruments forms the basis of modelling credit risk of structured\nfinance instruments. In addition, the valuation model for simple credit instruments, introduced\nin this chapter, will be developed further to a model for evaluating structured credit products.\nAsset-value-model\nIn this paper the borrowers' default behaviour is described by a parsimonious Vasicek style\none-factor-model which is derived from a Merton asset-value model. With the assumption of\na CAPM-conform asset pricing on capital markets, we are able to calculate risk-neutral\ndefault probabilities within this model framework, which enables us to price credit risky\nassets.\nWe assume that the value\nt\ni\nV\n,\nof a firm i follows a geometric Brownian motion with drift\ni\n\nand volatility\ni\n , ie\nt\ni\ni\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni dW\ndt\nV\ndV\n,\n,\n, \n+\n\n= \nt\ni\nW\n,\ndenotes the Wiener process.

If the recovery rate is\ngreater than zero, the bond price can be derived from (9).\nEL profile and valuation\nA connection between the expected losses and therefore the expected cash-flows and the\nrealisation of the market factor\nT\nM can easily be established. Using equations (7) and (8) it\nfollows for the expected loss given the value of the market factor expressed as percentage of\nexposure at default:\n( )\nT\nT\ni\ni\nT\ni\nM\np\nRR\nM\nT\nEL\n,\n)\n(\n)\n|\n( \n-\nWe refer to this relationship in the following as the \"EL profile\" considering it as a function\nof the realisations\nT\nm . It represents in our framework all systematic uncertainty concerning\nfuture losses and thus contains all information relevant for pricing considerations.\nFurther uncertainty, i. e. uncertainty concerning the actual realisations of losses given a value\nof\nT\nM , is of idiosyncratic nature and can be eliminated through diversification in a\nsufficiently large portfolio and thus is not relevant for pricing.\nTwo credit products, showing identical EL-profiles, are exposed to identical systematic risks\nand therefore should realise the same market price in the absence of arbitrage. This conclusion\nwill be the basis for the evaluation of structured credit products.\n3 Tranching and reallocating risks\n3.1 Tranching and rating-based risk measures\nCDOs are securities which transform the credit risk of the underlying collateral pool into a set\nof securities with different credit and loss profiles. Here we only consider a simplified\nversion, and do not take into account the waterfall describing the priority of payments which\nis often quite complex. Instead we assume a strict subordination principle. If there are defaults\nin the collateral, losses first impact the equity tranche (first-loss piece). If the number of\ndefaults is so great that the losses exceed the equity tranche's volume, the mezzanine tranches\nincur losses and the mezzanine holders start to see a reduced coupon and principal. The\ntranche with the highest subordination is the senior tranche. It only has to absorb losses if all\ntranches with lower subordination are wiped out.\nThe loss distribution of the underlying collateral pool is crucial for determining each tranche's\nrisk profile. The collateral pool's loss on a percentage basis is an aggregation of individual\nlosses. Using \n=\ni\ni\nEAD\nEAD we obtain:\n\n\n=\n\n=\n\n-\n\n=\n=\nn\ni\nT\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni i\nRR\nEAD\nEAD\nT\nL\nEAD\nT\nL\n}\n{\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n( \nThe loss distribution of a tranche relates to the loss distribution of the collateral pool.\nGenerally the tranche's status is determined by its upper and lower limits \u00ad its attachment and\ndetachment point.\nLet us consider a tranche with attachment point %)\n;\n[\n\na and detachment point\n%]\n;\n(a\nb  . The tranche only suffers losses when the losses in the collateral pool until\nmaturity T exceed the attachment point a. If the accumulated losses in the reference portfolio\nremain below a, then the tranche does not sustain any losses. On the other hand, if the\naccumulated losses exceed the detachment point b during the period, this results in a total loss\nfor the tranche.\nThe probability that the accumulated losses in the collateral pool exceed the attachment point\na by the end of the contract duration T,\n)\n(\n)\n)\n(\n( }\n)\n(\n{ a\nT\nL\ntr\na\nT\nL\nP\np >\n=\n>\ndenotes the \"hitting probability\" or PD of the tranche.

It depends solely on\nthe subordination, i.e. the attachment point a, and not from the tranche \"thickness\" b \u00ad a.\nIf the tranche is hit, then the size of the loss is of course also relevant.

In special cases the\nexpected tranche loss can be approximated analytically or asymptotically, but generally it has\nto be calculated based on simulation.\nIn general, the rating of a tranche is based on the hitting probability or the expected loss. If the\nrating is based on the hitting probability, it represents a \"first dollar of loss\" rating and the\nlikelihood of an investor facing any loss at all until maturity is estimated. The \"thickness\" or\nwidth b \u00ad a of the tranche is taken into consideration for a rating based on expected tranche\nloss.\nOther important risk measures include the variance or volatility of the tranche loss, the\ntranche's unexpected loss, or value at risk and expected shortfall parameters. Generally these\nmeasures can only be determined by simulation.\n3.2 The systematic risk of CDO tranches\nIn this section the sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risks is studied in some detail.\nThis involves analysing the default behaviour of CDO tranches as a function of the market\nfactor M (for simplicity subscript T is omitted) and comparing it with that of the collateral\npool or a corporate bond with a comparable rating. To illustrate the differences, a sample\nportfolio is considered for the collateral pool, and a sample CDO is generated. The collateral\npool loss, the tranche losses (see (15)), and the corresponding risk measures are calculated\nusing stochastic simulation.\nSample collateral pool and CDO\nWe consider the default behaviour and potential losses of a CDO with a maturity of five years\n(T=5). A homogeneous portfolio of 100 equally weighted corporate bonds with a BBB rating\nis used as the collateral pool. The empirical five-year S&P default rate of %\n.\n=\nT\np is used\nto estimate the unconditional probabilities of default. In addition, a homogeneous asset\n.\n=\n and a constant recovery rate of 4\n.\n=\ni\nRR is assumed for all collateral\npool assets. The following tranching scheme with the associated attachment and detachment\npoints is used:\nTranche Attachment Point Detachment Point Hitting Probability\nTable 1: Definition of CDO tranches\nThe hitting probabilities are calculated via simulation according to (14). If the tranche rating\nis based on the hitting probability, the mezzanine tranche has roughly a BBB rating which\nmatches the rating of the bonds in the collateral pool. With a five-year hitting probability of\n14 bp the senior tranche has a AAA rating.\nExpected loss profile\nTo analyse the increased sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risk, we consider the EL-\nprofile, i.e. the expected tranche loss conditional on the realisation m of the market factor M\n)\n|\n)\n(\n( m\nT\nL\nE tr\nas a function of m.\nThe slope of the EL profile for poor (i.e. negative) market factor values is a measure of\nsensitivity to systematic risk.\nFirst, the collateral pool itself is analysed. If the pool is regarded as an index or considered as\na single tranche, the homogeneous portfolio, based on the assumptions made and the single\nfactor model (6), gives us\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n|\n)\n(\n( m\np\nRR\nm\nT\nL\nE\nT\n\n-\n=\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\n=\n-\n\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\np\nm\np T\nT\n.\nHowever, this is exactly the same EL profile as for any bond contained in the collateral pool.\nThis means that, in absolute value, the collateral pool and the bond contain exactly the same\nsystematic risk. The diversification is expressed in the fact that the idiosyncratic risks are\nreduced and therefore the share of systematic risk increases. In the case at hand of a\nhomogeneous portfolio, conditional on the market factor the losses are binomially distributed\nand the variance of the conditional losses is reduced as the number of bonds in the pool\nincreases.\nThe situation changes dramatically if the loss distribution is split into several tranches and a\nsingle tranche is analysed. For example, the mezzanine tranche of our sample CDO shows the\nfollowing EL profile (calculated via simulation):\nFigure 2: EL profiles of the BBB mezzanine tranche and BBB bond\nThe EL profile for one of the collateral pool's bonds (BBB rated) is also shown for\ncomparison. Notice that the hitting probability of the mezzanine tranche approximately\nmatches the bonds default probability. This suggests that the tranche's rating based on the\nhitting probability would also be BBB. Figure 2 graphically illustrates that the default\nbehaviour of CDO tranches and bonds differs drastically with regard to the influence of\nsystematic risk. Given unfavourable values for the systematic risk factor, the curve of the\ntranche rises much more steeply than for a corporate bond with similar rating.\nA consequence of the sharply increased systematic risk is rapid and drastic rating downgrades\nin bad economic times. In a good macroeconomic environment (high values of M), the\ntranche is hardly ever hit, while the corresponding conditional expected losses for the\ncollateral pool or for a single corporate bond are always slightly higher. In such a favourable\nscenario, changes to the systematic risk factor have almost no effect on the hitting probability\nor expected loss of the tranche, and CDO ratings appear very stable with regard to\nmacroeconomic changes. This impression is deceptive, however. If the systematic risk factor\ncomes under stress, CDOs (unlike corporate bonds) prove extremely sensitive to an economic\ndownturn. In this critical region, even a small change of the market factor causes a dramatic\ndeterioration in the tranche's credit quality. It is precisely this phenomenon that can be\nobserved in the US subprime crisis. Falling house prices and rising interest rates triggered a\ndownward spiral resulting from rising insolvencies, house sales and plummeting prices, and\nthe macroeconomic situation of the US housing market entered a critical phase. This led to\ndrastic downgrades of hundreds of CDO tranches which contained these loans in their\nreference portfolios.\nAnother important consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic risk, which was\npossibly not adequately appreciated by investors. The considerably increased systematic risk\nof the tranches needs to be compensated for by a significantly higher spread compared with\ncorporate bond spreads. If the prices of CDO tranches and bonds are the same or do not differ\nsufficiently, CDO issuers can exploit this to their advantage. This may provide a further\nexplanation for the emergence of \"CDO arbitrage\". The price-relevant aspects are discussed\nin detail in section 4.\nLoan equivalent \"bond representation\" for quantifying the systematic risk of a CDO tranche\nThe sensitivity of a borrower or bond, respectively, to systematic risk is expressed in the\nsingle factor model by the correlation parameter  (assumed to be homogeneous). In this\nsection we estimate the asset correlation associated with a CDO tranche treating the structured\ninstrument as a single-name credit instrument. Thus we treat the CDO tranche as a \"virtual\"\nborrower or bond, and approximate its default behaviour likewise using a single factor model.\nOur aim is to estimate the \"virtual\" asset correlation tr\n of the CDO tranche.\nConsidering a CDO tranche as a virtual bond, the conditional hitting probability is expressed\nin the single-factor model as a function of M by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n=\ntr\ntr\ntr\ntr\nT\nm\nc\nm\np\n\n\n)\nThe default threshold tr\nc can be calculated using the unconditional hitting probability given\nin (14). In this approach (see, for example, Yahalom/Levy/Kaplan, 2008) the loss given\ndefault (LGD) of the tranche has to be specified in a separate model.\nHere we introduce another approach. A key observation is that the LGD of a CDO tranche is\nalways a random variable that depends on the market factor. This is because the tranche loss\ndepends on the defaults in the collateral pool, and the defaults, in turn, depend on the market\nfactor. Note that this is usually not the case with a straight bond where default and LGD may\nbe independent. A CDO tranche's sensitivity to systematic risk can be increased further by the\ndependence of tranche loss on the market factor. This additional systematic risk is contained\nin the expected loss profile. Therefore we consider the EL profile as the tranche`s risk profile\nand not the tranche's conditional hitting probability. Moreover, as outlined in the previous\nsection, the EL profile contains all the information necessary for pricing. The EL profile is\nobtained via stochastic simulation. For the \"bond representation\", however, we assume a\nconstant LGD* for the tranche (instead of the random loss given default depending on the\nmarket factor).\nThe \"implied\" hitting probability conditional on the market factor is determined from\n*\n))\n(\n(\n)\n(\nLGD\nm\nL\nE\nm\np tr\ntr\nT\nThe tranche's unconditional hitting probability is given by\n*\n)\n(\nLGD\nL\nE\np tr\ntr\nT\n= .\nThe unconditional expected tranche loss is also calculated in the simulation, and the default\nthreshold tr\nc is given by\n)\n(\nT\ntr p\nc -\n\n= .\nIn the next step, the tranche LGD* is determined as the maximum loss of the tranche.\nThe maximum loss of the collateral pool is given by\n\n=\n-\n=\nn\ni\ni\ni RR\nEAD\nEAD\nL\nmax )\n(\nwhich reduces to LGD\nRR\nL\nmax\n=\n-\n=1 for a homogeneous portfolio.\nBased on this, the maximum loss for a tranche with attachment point a and detachment point\nb is\na\nb\na\nb\nL\nLGD\n-\n-\n=\n)\n,\nmin(\n* max\nif a\nL >\nmax\n.

For\nthe non-senior tranches, the \"implied\" hitting probability profile of the \"virtual\"\napproximating bond is set equal to the EL profile, while the EL profile is scaled up for the\nsenior tranche with 1\n* <\nFinally, the \"virtual\" asset correlation tr\n is calculated by means of optimization\n[ ] [ ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n=\nK\nk\ntr\nk\ntr\nT\nk\ntr\nT\n,\n)\nm\n(\np\n~\n)\nm\n(\np\nmin\narg\ntr\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\n=\n-\ntr\nk\ntr\ntr\nT\nk\ntr\nT\nm\n)\np\n(\n)\nm\n(\np\n~\n\n\nand )\nm\n(\np\nk\ntr\nT\nis given in (19) evaluated at\nk\nm .

This \"bond representation\" is a more appropriate\napproximation of the default behaviour and the loss profile than an approximation based on\nthe conditional hitting probability of the tranche.\nThe estimation results for all tranches of the sample CDO are summarised in Table 2.\nTranche tr\nT\np (%) tr\nTable 2: Risk parameters for the CDO tranches and the collateral pool\nFrom Table 2 it can be seen that in our approach tr\nT\np is rather an artificial parameter for\nfitting the EL profile than a hitting probability. tr\nT\np corresponds to the unconditional expected\nloss for the non-senior tranches of the sample transaction. The parameter tr\n can be\ninterpreted as the tranche's \"virtual\" asset correlation. It can be seen that the values of tr\n are\nmuch higher than those for comparable corporate bonds (e.g. 1\n.\n=\n for the collateral pool's\nassets) reflecting the drastically increased sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risks.\nThe following Figure shows the bond representation's fit for the mezzanine tranche. It\nindicates a very good fit of the EL profile obtained from the simulation and function\n)\nm\n(\np\n~\nk\ntr\nT\nin (21) derived from the optimization procedure with given default threshold and\nestimated \"virtual\" asset correlation.3\nFigure 3: Comparison of the mezzanine tranche's EL profile with the bond representation's profile\nImpact of subordination\nFor the rating process of a structured finance transaction a tranche`s subordination plays a key\nrole. The higher the subordination the more losses in the collateral pool are absorbed by\ntranches with lower seniority. Thus, higher seniority lowers the hitting probability and allows\nhigher rating grades. The EL profiles for the tranches are shown in Figure 4 below.\n3 In the case of equity tranches and broad senior tranches, the bond approximation reveals somewhat larger\ndeviations from the EL profile of each CDO tranche. However, the approximation errors are negligible for the\nissues discussed in the present article.\nFigure 4: EL profiles of all tranches of the sample CDO\nThe position of the critical regions, in which the market factor has a strong effect on the\ntranche`s losses (the EL profile has a steep slope), depends on the degree of subordination.\nThis area can be shifted towards the left side of the diagram (i.e. a scenario of economic\ndepression) by increasing the subordination. It is evident that the macroeconomic\nenvironment must worsen greatly before a senior tranche is hit. However, if the critical area is\nreached, the credit assessment of even highly rated tranches may suffer drastic downgrades as\nwe have seen in the current subprime crisis.\nInvestment in CDO tranches versus investment in the collateral pool\nAt this point the key difference between an investment in the collateral pool (\"vertical\"\ntranching) and investment in a tranche (\"horizontal\" tranching) can be made clear. Let us\nconsider the sample collateral pool with an average BBB rating and the mezzanine tranche\n(6.5 - 11.5%), which also has a BBB rating in accordance with its hitting probability. If the\ntransaction's total nominal amount is 1 billion Dollar, an investor can, for example, purchase\nthe mezzanine tranche for $50 million or he can invest this amount in a portfolio which is\ncomparable with or equivalent to the collateral pool. By construction, both investments have\nthe same implied PD. However, the two investments have significant differences regarding\ntheir other risk characteristics. The main difference stems from the fact that, in the latter case,\nthe investment is made in the entire loss distribution of the pool, whereas in the case of a\ntranche, the investment is made in a specific part of the loss distribution. The collateral pool's\nrisks are completely reallocated by the tranching process. On the one hand, a large senior\ntranche is created which has a much smaller default risk than that of the collateral pool's\nassets. On the other hand, the systematic risk (sensitivity to the market factor) of all tranches\nrises massively. It is true that building a large collateral pool diversifies idiosyncratic risk, so\nthat only systematic risk remains. Such an investment in a well diversified pool is seen as an\nadvantage of CDO tranches. However, the systematic risk remains unchanged in absolute\nterms in the collateral pool ( 1\n.\n=\n ; see Table 2), while, by contrast, the tranches' systematic\nrisk rises dramatically (e.g. 75\n.\n=\ntr\n for junior and mezzanine tranches; see Table 2). For\nthis reason, a portfolio of BBB tranches from different securitisations (of the same type), for\nexample, is much riskier than a portfolio of comparable bonds or investments in different\ncollateral pools. In particular, the addition of CDO tranches to bond or loan portfolios raises\nthe probability of large portfolio losses, i.e. CDO tranches affect the tail of the loss\ndistribution. A consequence is considerably higher risk contributions measured by value at\nrisk or expected shortfall contributions, respectively.\n4 Valuation of tranches and CDO arbitrage\nThe simple valuation model introduced in section 2 is used to identify potential possibilities\nof mispricing of the securities generated by the tranching. We do not compare expliciltly\nmodel and market spreads (see, for example, Coval/Jurek/Stafford, 2009a, and\nBrennan/Hein/Poon, 2009). Instead we analyze which opportunities for CDO arbitrage are\navailable if investors ignore the tranches' systematic risk and base their pricing solely on the\nrating in the form of hitting probability or expected losses.\nThe results presented in the preceding sections allow us to achieve the above mentioned\nobjective of an approximate tranche pricing with the following three steps:\n(1) Starting point is the aggregation of all pricing relevant information and results in\ngenerating the tranche's EL-profile (by simulation, see sections 2 and 3.2).\n(2) The risk parameters of a \"virtual\" bond are calculated in a way, that the EL-profile of this\nbond replicates the tranche's profile. We call this the \"bond representation\". (see section 3.2)\n(3) This bond can be priced with equation (9) presented in section 2; sharing the same\nsensitivity towards systematic risks, the tranche and the virtual bond are equally priced. As a\nresult, we arrive at the price for the tranche. Again, we assume a zero-coupon structure.\nIt can be seen from (9) that the bond price falls as the risk-neutral PD increases. In line with\n(11), the risk-neutral PD increases \u00ad ceteris paribus \u00ad as the systematic risk rises. This means\nthat bonds with the same real PD\nT\np should have very different prices depending on their\nexposure to systematic risk.\nApplication to the sample CDO\nIn the following the present values of the tranches and the collateral pool are calculated using\nthe results from Table 2. This involves determining the risk-neutral PD using equation (11),\nincorporating each of the \"virtual\" asset correlations of the bond representation.

The value of\nthe equity tranche is then calculated such that the sum-total matches the value of the collateral\npool. Table 4 shows the results:\nTranche Price\nTable 4: Tranche prices (based on an asset correlation of  = 0.1)\nA comparison of the results in Tables 3 and 4 shows how a CDO arranger who retains the\nequity tranche can exploit the situation to his advantage. If he succeeds in selling the non-\nequity tranches in line with their rating (according to the real PD or expected losses) like\ncorporate bonds, investors will pay an excessive price and will receive inadequate spreads for\nthe tranches' systematic risk. For the equity tranche, by contrast, the situation is reversed. The\nvalue in Table 4 shows that the price of the equity tranche as the \"residual tranche\" is\nsignificantly too low. If the equity tranche spread is an \"excess spread\", this creates the\npossibility to generate a positive net capital value from the overall transaction. Put another\nway, the holders of the equity tranche charge a very high premium for the apparently high\nThe results indicate that investors should receive much higher spreads for their investments in\nCDOs as a risk premium than that which they are paid on comparable corporate bonds. This\nwas obviously not the case in the years prior to the start of the subprime crisis (see Brennan et\nal, 2008). During this period there were virtually no differences between the prices of CDO\ntranches and those of similarly rated corporate bonds. In some cases the spreads of corporate\nbonds were even lower than the spreads of tranches with similar ratings.\nIn summary, there is a general way to CDO arbitrage when the non-equity tranches of a CDO\ncan be sold at the prices of corporate bonds with comparable ratings. In this case, it is\nThis underscores a remark by Tavakoli (2006), which points out that investors in equity tranches should never\naccept an upfront payment and a fixed spread, which is usual with credit indices. Instead, they should always\ndemand the excess spread.\nadvantageous for the CDO arranger to put together the collateral pool in such a way that the\ntranching creates securities with a very high systematic risk whose true prices should be close\nto those of the respective cheapest-to-supply assets. This provides the maximum potential\nprofit for the arranger from the transaction.\nIn the next section we describe some possibilities of generating tranches with high systematic\nrisk. It comes as no surprise that precisely these types of transactions can be found in many\nCDOs issued prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis.\n5 Generating tranches with high systematic risk\n5.1 Increasing the number of assets in the collateral pool\nIt is often claimed that a key advantage of investing in a CDO tranche is that it offers the\npossibility to invest in an already well diversified portfolio. Additionally, if the systematic\nrisk of the portfolio is low, the unexpected loss decreases and realised losses are usually close\nto expected loss. While this is basically correct, it is often forgotten that this applies only\nwhen an investment is made in the entire collateral pool, in other words when just one single\ntranche is formed. When tranches are created, however, a reallocation of risks occurs whereby\nthe systematic risk of each tranche increases drastically and is much higher than the\nsystematic risk in the collateral pool. This sensitivity to systematic risk is strengthened if the\nnumber of assets in the collateral pool is increased. To illustrate this, let us consider the case\nin which the number of assets in the homogeneous collateral pool is increased from 100 to\n500, while the individual risk characteristics of the assets remain unchanged. A tranching\nscheme is used which produces approximately the same ratings for the non-equity tranches as\nthe structure shown in Table 1 in line with their hitting probability. The results are shown in\nTranche AP DP Hitting\nProbability\nTable 5: Definition of the CDO tranches (n=500)\nThe following results are obtained for the bond representation:\nTranche Implied HP (%) tr\nTable 6: Parameter estimations for the CDO tranches (n=500)\nFirst it can be seen that the collateral pool's risk characteristics \u00ad as far as they are relevant for\nthe CDOs' risk analysis \u00ad have not changed. Although the relative share of idiosyncratic risk\nhas dropped due to further diversification, this is not price-relevant. In absolute terms\n(expressed by the covariation with the market factor), the systematic risk is unchanged. The\nprice of the collateral pool thus also remains the same.\nHowever, for the CDO tranches matters have changed. Apart from the equity tranche, all\ntranches show a further increase in systematic risk. As described above, this strengthens the\nCDO arbitrage. The following Table shows the tranche prices according to bond\napproximation including the actual systematic risk, as well as the prices of comparable\ncorporate bonds )\n.\n( =\n . Additionally, the prices for the respective cheapest-to-supply assets\nare given for the non-equity tranches.\nTranche Price\n(actual systematic risk)\nPrice\n(Corporate Bonds)\nPrice\n(Cheapest-to-Supply)\nTable 7: Tranche prices including the actual systematic risk, valued like comparable corporate bonds,\nand cheapest-to-supply assets\nIt can be seen that the valuation of the non-equity tranches on the basis of corporate bonds\nproduces roughly the same prices as before because of the comparable ratings of the tranches.\nHowever, taking the actual systematic risk into account, the prices ought to be distinctly lower\n\u00ad especially for the junior and mezzanine tranches \u00ad to compensate for the increased risk. On\nthe other hand, the equity tranche offers extremely high spreads and thus drastically higher\npotential returns because of its very low price.\nFinally it should be noted that a sufficiently large number of assets in the collateral pool\nalways produces tranches with high systematic risk. This also holds if the asset correlation\nbetween the assets in the reference portfolio is very low, some of them may even be\nuncorrelated. Thus the process of bundling a large number of assets with a low systematic risk\nvia securitisation with subsequent tranching generates securities with a very high systematic\nrisk. Among others, this applies to US residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS).\nA further example illustrates the point. If an (extremely low) asset correlation of 0.01 is\nassumed for the assets in the collateral pool (other risk parameters remain unchanged) and the\nnumber of assets is increased to 2000 (which is the case with many ABS and RMBS), the\ntranche from 3.5 to 5.75%, which now has approximately an A rating, has an estimated asset\n5.2 Inclusion of assets with a high systematic risk in the collateral pool\nAnother way of generating tranches with a very high systematic risk is to include assets which\nalready have a high systematic risk in the collateral pool, while leaving the number of assets\nat roughly 100 to 150. Examples are ABS CDOs (SF CDOs), in particular ABS CDOs with\nsubprime exposure, whose collateral pools contain RMBS mezzanine tranches, for instance.\nThese assets already have a high systematic risk, and second-layer securitisation further\nsignificantly raises the systematic risk of the resulting tranches. The situation is similar for\nmany transactions of the CDO-squared type. The collateral pools of these structured finance\ninstruments are frequently composed of tranches which are in turn the product of\nsecuritisations from the same or similar segments (eg car loans, credit card receivables,\nleasing contracts), or include tranches of synthetic CDOs with overlapping names. In all these\ncases, the tranches of the first-layer securitisations are already highly correlated. The second-\nlayer securitisation further increases the sensitivity of the resulting tranches to systematic risk.\nCredit default swaps (CDSs) on ABS or MBS additionally increase sensitivity to systematic\nrisk. This was evident, in particular, on the market for MBS CDOs with subprime exposure. If\nan underlying MBS tranche suffers a loss, this directly leads to a credit event for the\nassociated synthetic MBS CDS. Correlation is perfect in this case. This leveraging of real\nMBS bonds multiplies the effect of the defaults on subprime loans and may result in an abrupt\nloss of value if economic conditions deteriorate.\nFor synthetic CDOs, the credit risks in the collateral pool are transferred via credit default\nswaps (CDSs). For these transactions, it is useful to look for CDSs that offer as high a spread\nas possible for a given rating. This is the case where the underlying enterprises exhibit\nadditional risks, in particular systematic risks. For example, according to estimates (see\nBruyere, 2006, p 126), the collateral pools of the vast majority of synthetic arbitrage CDOs in\n2002 and 2003 included the tobacco company Philip Morris. This was because the potential\nrisk of further legal sanctions against the tobacco industry was reflected in a high spread, but\nthe rating was unchanged at BBB. As the agency models only took into account the default\nrisk (in the form of the BBB rating) in their tranche rating, this offers additional opportunities\nfor CDO arbitrage for the issuers.\n5.3 Creating as many tranchelets as possible\nFinally, it is possible to slice the collateral portfolio up into a large number of very thin\ntranches (tranchelets). These tranchelets are extremely sensitive to systematic risk. Thus it is\nalways advantageous for CDO issuers to generate as many tranches as possible in a\nsecuritisation.\nSimilarly, virtually only tranches with a width of just a few percentage points were generated\nin the construction of single-tranche CDO swaps. This also applies structured instruments\nwhere several tranches were created but the capital structure was not completely placed with\ninvestors. Where the tranches created in this manner are included in another securitisation's\ncollateral pool, the new tranches' sensitivity to the market factor is further raised. If investors\nignore the higher systematic risk in such a tranche and focus only on the rating, the seller can\nexploit this to his advantage, as outlined above.\nA particularly instructive example of splitting a tranche into two new tranches with the\npossibility of CDO arbitrage is where a senior tranche is divided into a super-senior tranche\nand a lower AAA tranche. This approach is customary for CDO structuring and is discussed\nvery critically, particularly in Tavakoli (2006).\nBy way of illustration, we will look at the capital structure shown in Table 5. The senior\nyears), which corresponds to an AAA rating. If it is assumed, for example, that LIBOR +\n30bp is payable for an AAA-rated bond, investors would receive 30bp for almost 90% of the\ntotal nominal amount for a synthetic (unfunded) CDO.\nNow, a super-senior tranche is set up with an attachment point of 12.25%. This tranche has a\nhitting probability of about 4 bp and is claimed \"virtually without default risk\" according to\nthe CDO arranger. It should therefore be possible (and this was generally the case) to insure\nits risk with a monoliner at low cost of, say, 6 bp or, alternatively, to retain the risk on the\nbooks. In this way, a saving of 24 bp is achieved for 87.75% of the total nominal amount.\nThe hitting probability for the next lower tranche of 10.25%-12.25% remains unchanged. If\nthe rating is based on the hitting probability, the tranche retains its AAA rating and therefore\nalso its price if investors focus only on the rating. However, the other risk characteristics have\nchanged dramatically, in particular in terms of expected loss and sensitivity to systematic risk.\nAs a consequence, the price, too, must change, and investors should demand a significantly\nhigher spread to compensate them for the higher risks. Table 8 shows the results of bond\nrepresentation and valuation.\nTranche Implied HP tr\n LGD* Price\nTable 8: Bond approximation and valuation of the senior tranche of the original structure and the\nsenior tranche with the same attachment point, which is below the super senior tranche\n6 Discussion and conclusion\nIn line with Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) and Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this paper presents\nmispricing of CDO tranches as an explanation for the exceptional growth of arbitrage CDOs\nprior to the onset of the financial crisis. Although CDO tranches initially offered more yield\nthan cash assets (bonds or loans) with similar ratings, the spread differences, which declined\ncontinuously from 2005 onwards, were far too low to compensate for the additional\nsystematic risk. Securitization of the collateral pool and tranching means risks are completely\nreallocated. While the probability of default and expected loss of a large portion of the capital\nstructure are distinctly lower than for an average collateral pool asset, the systematic risk of\nall tranches rises dramatically. If investors focus exclusively on the tranches' rating, they are\nvery likely to pay too high a price for the non-equity tranches. As the prices for the tranches,\nwhich are weighted according to the capital structure, add up to the value of the collateral\npool, the fact that prices for the non-equity tranches are too high inevitably results in the price\nfor the equity tranche being too low.\nThe \"bond representation\" described in section 3 allows quantifying systematic risk treating a\nCDO tranche as a single-name credit instrument. The tranche is considered as a \"virtual\"\nborrower or bond for which a single-factor model holds. Then, the exposure to systematic risk\nis measured by the asset correlation. In addition, we derive risk neutral default probabilities\nusing a simple valuation based on the CAPM and the single-factor Merton model. The risk\nneutral default probabilities also depend explicitly on the asset correlation. This allows\npricing of CDO tranches as an explicit function of asset correlation. Thus we obtain different\nprices for bonds and tranches with the same rating depending on their exposure to systematic\nrisk. The valuation of tranches and CDO arbitrage opportunities are discussed in section 4.\nThe desire to exploit CDO arbitrage opportunities usually entails the construction of tranches\nwith a high systematic risk. How this can be achieved was described in section 5. The\ncollateral pool's high degree of diversification was always regarded as a particular advantage\n(see, for example, Amato and Remolona, 2003). In the authors' view, less collateral is needed\nto cover unexpected default losses if pool diversification is high, thus raising \"arbitrage\nprofits\". However, in section 5 it is shown that increasing the number of assets in the\ncollateral pool leads to higher sensitivity to systematic risk of the tranches. Therefore, it is the\ninvestors who should be entitled to the \"arbitrage profits\" to compensate them for the\ntranches' much higher systematic risk. In addition, a large number of assets is not necessary if\nthe assets in the collateral pool already exhibit a high systematic risk. Prominent examples are\nABS CDOs, in particular MBS CDOs. The collateral pools of these CDO-squared instruments\ninclude a large proportion (roughly 80%, see BCBS, 2008) of BBB-rated RMBS mezzanine\ntranches. The RMBS tranches have a high hitting correlation. This means that the second-\nlayer tranches are much more sensitive to systematic risks. If the degree of hitting correlation\nof the tranches in the collateral pool is underestimated, the second-layer capital structure is\nsuch that the senior tranche with a very good rating is much too large. Another potential\ndanger for MBS CDOs with subprime exposure results from the relatively small width of the\nmezzanine tranches in the collateral pool (2.5% to 4%) as well as the relatively low original\nlevel of subordination (between 3% and 5%). Prepayments during the contract's life can\ntemporarily increase subordination, but overall it remains low. Rising default rates for\nsubprime loans combined with declining recovery rates may result in the BBB-rated\nmezzanine tranches in the original RMBS suffering losses. The extreme correlation then\nmeans a high likelihood that all BBB-rated tranches of subprime RMBS will be hit at the\nsame time. In addition, their small width means that there is a high likelihood that they will all\nexperience a total loss at the same time. This scenario means that the senior tranches of\nsubprime MBS CDOs will likewise default. These subprime CDOs therefore exhibit an \"all or\nnothing\" risk profile5: either the subprime default rates remain below the thresholds and the\nsenior tranches of the subprime CDOs do not suffer any loss at all, or the thresholds are\nbreached, and the senior tranches could all be wiped out.\nThe opportunity to increase the value of the equity tranche by sophisticated tranching also\nundermines the importance investors in senior tranches attach to the fact, that the arranger of a\ntransaction keeps the first-loss piece. Usually it is assumed, that this prevents the arranger\nwhich is mostly also the designer of the collateral pool, from overinvesting and thus ensures\nhigh collateral quality which also strengthens the position of senior tranche investors.\nHowever, if the arranger can gain profit solely from tranching, these profits offset losses from\npoor investment decisions, in other words, the credit quality of the collateral pool's assets\nbecomes less important as long as there are enough assets to form collateral pools. Thus, our\nfindings can to some extent explain the surge in demand for MBS bonds before the financial\ncrisis as well as the deteriorating credit quality in collateral pools.\nAnother aspect concerns the role of through-the-cycle ratings for structured credit\ninstruments. One of the key conclusions of this paper is that both the (conditional) hitting\nprobabilities and the expected loss profiles for CDO tranches are highly dependent on\nsystematic risks. The transition probabilities are similarly influenced by systematic risks.\nWhen the economy is doing well, CDO ratings are very stable. They can, however, become\nvery volatile in an economic downturn, and there may be significant rating downgrades within\na short space of time. This specific behaviour under stress makes a through-the-cycle rating\nfor CDOs as well as the use of average transition matrices, which take no account of the\ncurrent position in the credit cycle, questionable. In general, through-the-cycle ratings favour\nCDO arbitrage opportunities, in particular during an economic downturn. Consider, for\ninstance, a synthetic CDO's collateral pool consisting of CDS. Then, the higher default risks\nmean the CDS spreads are very likely to widen during an economic downturn. On the other\nhand, the through-the-cycle ratings remain largely unchanged. If a new CDO is structured\nwith the same collateral pool, the resulting tranching scheme and the tranche prices are the\nsame if one focuses exclusively on the rating, while the originator's revenues from the\ncollateral pool have risen.\nReferences\nAdelson, M H, Jacob, D P (2008): The sup-prime problem: Causes and lessons\n(www.adelsonandjacob.com).\nAmato, J D, Remolona, E M(2003): The credit spread puzzle, BIS Quarterly Review,\nAshcraft, A B, Sch\u00fcrman, T (2007): Understanding the securitization of subprime mortgage\ncredit, Working Paper, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (2008): The Joint Forum: Credit risk transfer \u00ad\nBrennan, M J, Hein, J, Poon, S-H (2009): Tranching and rating, Working Paper.\nBorio, C (2008): The financial turmoil of 2007: A preliminary assessment and some policy\nconsiderations, BIS Working Paper, Basel.\nBruy\u00e8re, R (2006): Credit derivatives and structured credit, John Wiley, New York.\nCoval, J D, Jurek, J W, Stafford, E (2009a): Economic catastrophe bonds, American\nCoval, J D, Jurek, J W Stafford, E.
