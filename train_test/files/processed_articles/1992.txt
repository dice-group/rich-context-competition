Promising associations (p < 10-5) were subsequently\nexamined in 1040 additional youths and 3508 adults from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), a diverse population-based study. Three genotype\u00adphenotype associations replicated in NHANES III\nyouths and three associated in NHANES III adults at p < 0.05; however, no single association was significant in both youths\nand adults. The most significant association (p = 0.009) in NHANES III youths was between low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C) and intronic rs2429917 among participants of African descent. Given the known age dependency\nof lipid levels, we also tested for gene\u00adage interactions in NHANES III participants across all ages. We identified a\nutility of using children to discover novel variants associated with complex phenotypes and the importance of considering\nage-dependent genetic effects in association studies of lipid levels.\nKeywords: Lipids, age, children, NHANES III, interaction, genome-wide association study\nIntroduction\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified\nmany common genetic variants that contribute to normal\nvariation in lipid traits. The largest GWAS meta-analysis to\ndate, containing greater than 100,000 individuals of European\ndescent, identified 95 loci that were independently asso-\nciated with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) (Teslovich et al., 2010).\nCombined, these loci explained only 25\u00ad30% of the\ngenetic variance, leaving a majority of the genetic variance\nunexplained.\nSome have argued that the \"missing heritability\" observed\nfor most complex human traits is due, in part, to unidentified\ngenetic and nongenetic modifiers (McCarthy & Hirschhorn,\nCorresponding author: Dana C. Crawford, PhD, Center for Human\nGenetics Research, Vanderbilt University, 2215 Garland Avenue,\n2008). Very few GWAS have tested for and identified genetic\nmodifiers as the statistical methods and approaches have yet\nto be developed that will fully exploit these data (Cordell,\ndata necessary to test for modifiers, particularly environmental\nexposures that modify genetic associations.\nAge, a potential modifier of the lipid trait distribution due\nto genetics, has been relatively unexplored. It is known that\nchildren and adolescents have different lipid distributions\ncompared with adults (Hickman et al., 1998; Jolliffe &\nJanssen, 2006). Indeed, the National Cholesterol and Educa-\ntion Program (NCEP) provides a set of lipid and lipoprotein\nguidelines specific for children and adolescents (Expert Panel\nBlood Cholesterol Levels Child Adolesc, 1992). Furthermore,\nthe increase in the means and variances of most lipid param-\neters as humans age has been well established (Reilly et al.,\ndependency is due to increases in environmental or genetic\nvariance, or both, is still left to be determined. Preliminary\nAnnals of Human Genetics C 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University College London\nL. Dumitrescu et al.\nstudies of complex traits such as body mass index (BMI)\nand systolic blood pressure suggest that, over time, while\nthe contribution of genes to a phenotype remains relatively\nconstant, environmental exposures are thought to increase\nthe phenotypic variance (Brown et al., 2003). Thus, the\naccumulation effects of environmental exposures (i.e., diet,\nexercise, or smoking) may increase the phenotypic variance\nof complex traits such as BMI and lipids over time, making\nit more difficult to detect genotype\u00adphenotype associations.\nAll GWAS studies of the lipid traits (HDL-C, LDL-C,\nand TG) have been performed in adults (>18 years of age)\n(Hindorff et al., 2010), a population exposed to environmen-\ntal factors that influence lipid trait distributions for at least two\ndecades. While these GWAS have been successful in identi-\nfying genetic variants associated with lipid traits, we propose\nthat the study of younger participants such as children will\nidentify additional variants masked by the age dependency\nwell documented for these traits. To identify these novel vari-\nants associated with HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG levels, we per-\nformed a GWAS in 411 children of European, African, or\nMexican descent ascertained at St. Jude Children's Research\nHospital followed by replication in an additional dataset of\nyouths from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (n = 1040; NHANES III). Replicated genetic\nvariants were formally tested for an interaction with age in\nthe larger NHANES III dataset with adults (n = 3508). Gene\ndiscovery in children followed by testing for interactions in\nadults has identified one lipid trait-associated locus potentially\nmodified by age and represents a modest step toward identify-\ning the full genetic architecture of the lipid trait distributions\nin human populations.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects in the discovery GWAS were drawn from the To-\ntal Therapy Study XV, a prospective study of children un-\ndergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),\ninitiated in 2000 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital\nto investigate outcomes of a new treatment approach (Pui\nrolled in the study, 411 of whom were evaluable for both\nserum lipids and genome-wide genotyping. Race/ethnicity\nwas inferred using germ-line genotypes as previously de-\nscribed (Yang et al., 2009) based on genotype-based hier-\narchical clustering of patients and using data from the In-\nternational HapMap cell lines [n = 90 Utah residents with\nNorthern and Western European ancestry from the Cen-\ntre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain collection (CEU)\n(European); 90 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); 30 Han\nChinese in Beijing, China (CHB); and 30 Japanese in Tokyo,\nJapan (JPT) (Asians)] as references. Patients exhibiting >90%\nEuropean, African, or Asian ancestries were classified as\nWhite, Black, or Asian, respectively; \"Hispanic\" status was\ninferred for those patients who were self-declared Hispanics\nwho also had less than 90% of European, African, and Asian\nancestries. The remaining patients were labeled as \"other\" and\nwere not included in this analysis. Serum levels of HDL, LDL,\nand TG were measured directly using standard enzymatic\ntechniques (Roche Diagnostics, IN) as described in Kawedia\net al. (2011). All lipid measurements were taken on consoli-\ndation day 15 of treatment (at least 4 weeks from the last dose\nof glucocorticoid or asparaginase) and were nonfasting.\nParticipants in the St. Jude study were genotyped with ei-\nOnly common SNPs genotyped across both platforms were\nconsidered for analysis. SNPs were excluded from the analysis\nbased on genotyping call rates per SNP (98%) and minor\nof association between each genetic variant assuming an ad-\nditive genetic model and natural log-transformed lipid trait\nwere implemented in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) using lin-\near regression, stratified by race/ethnicity.\nAscertainment of the NHANES III and method of DNA\ncollection have been previously described (Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, 1994). Briefly, NHANES III is a\nby the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention. Like all\nthe NHANES, NHANES III is a complex survey design that\noversampled minorities (non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican\nAmericans), the young, and the elderly. Blood samples were\nobtained at a central location known as the Mobile Exami-\nnation Center (MEC). Serum TC, TG, and HDL cholesterol\nwere measured using standard enzymatic methods and LDL\ncholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation, with\nmissing values assigned for samples with TG levels greater\nthan 400 mg/dL (Center for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, 1996). Beginning with phase 2 of NHANES III, DNA\nsamples were collected from study participants aged 12 years\nand older. Race/ethnicity was self-identified as non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, or other.\nAll NHANES III procedures were approved by the CDC\nEthics Review Board and written informed consent was ob-\ntained from all participants. The present study was approved\nby the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because the study inves-\ntigators did not have access to personal identifiers, this study\nwas considered nonhuman subjects research by the Vanderbilt\nUniversity Institutional Review Board.\nA total of 65 SNPs were carried forward for replication\nin NHANES III and were targeted for genotyping using\nSequenom's iPLEX Gold assay on the MassARRAY platform\n(San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions\nAnnals of Human Genetics C 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University College London\nAge Modifies Lipid Genetics\ndesign and was subsequently genotyped using Applied\nBiosystem's TaqMan (Foster City, CA). A total of 57 SNPs\nwere genotyped successfully (genotyping call rate >95%);\nhowever, five SNPs failed blinded duplicates quality control\nmeasures as required by CDC and were excluded from further\nanalyses. The remaining SNPs were tested for deviations\nfrom Hardy\u00adWeinberg Equilibrium (HWE) within each\nracial/ethnic group and all had HWE p-values >0.01 in at\nleast two populations, as required by CDC. All genotype\ndata reported here were deposited into the NHANES III\nGenetic database and are available for secondary analysis\nthrough CDC.\nGenotype\u00adphenotype tests of associations for the 52 SNPs\nand the three natural log-transformed lipid traits were per-\nformed in SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using\nlinear regression, assuming an additive genetic model, and\nunweighted for selection and nonresponse biases. Single-SNP\nanalyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, adjusted for age and\nsex and, for the adult cohort (>18 years), were limited to fast-\ning individuals not on lipid-lowering medications. Tests for\ninteractions between age and genotype were also considered\nin these regression models, excluding the adjustment for age.\nReplication and interaction associations were deemed signif-\nicantly significant at p < 0.05. Data were accessed remotely\nfrom the CDC's Research Data Center (RDC) in Hyattsville,\nMaryland using Analytic Data Research by Email (ANDRE).\nDifferences in lipid levels between the St. Jude and\nNHANES III cohort and between genotype groups were\ntested in STATA 10 using a standard two-sample t-test with\nunequal variances. Manhattan plots were produced using code\nprovided by http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com.\nResults\nStudy Population Characteristics\nAcross all three racial/ethnic subpopulations, St. Jude children\nwith ALL had consistently lower mean LDL-C, and higher\nmean HDL-C and mean TG compared to NHANES III\nyouths (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). The means of\nsome lipid levels (HDL-C in Whites and Hispanics LDL-C in\nWhites and Hispanics) were statistically significantly different\nbetween the two studies of children, with differences in means\nof up to 18.8 mg/dL (Table 1: Supplementary Table S1).\nThese differences in lipid levels are most likely related to the\nolder mean age and/or the larger percentage of females in\nNHANES III youths compared with St. Jude children rather\nthan health status, as none of the medications used during the\nconsolidation stage of therapy for ALL are known to affect\nlipid levels, per se.\nWhen comparing the two NHANES III replication\ndatasets, not surprisingly (Expert Panel Blood Cholesterol\nprofiles compared to youths with statistically higher mean\nLDL-C and TG levels across all subpopulations (Table 1 and\nSupplementary Table S2). Mean HDL-C levels were signifi-\ncantly higher in White adults and significantly lower in His-\npanic adults compared to youths, although the differences\nwere small (2.3 and 1.7 mg/dL, respectively).\nDiscovery GWAS Results\nTo identify novel common variants associated with HDL-\nC, LDL-C, and TG levels in children, we performed a\ngenome-wide association screen in all three subpopulations\nof the St. Jude cohort. No SNP surpassed genome-wide sta-\ntistical significance (p < 5 \u00d7 10-7) (Wellcome Trust Case\nControl Consortium, 2007) for any of the analyses; how-\never, four SNPs approached that threshold and were sig-\nnificantly associated at p < 1 \u00d7 10-6 (Fig. 1 and Sup-\nplementary Table S3). In Whites, two SNPs (intergenic\nTable 1 Participant characteristics.\nGWAS cohort Replication cohort 1 Replication cohort 2\nSt. Jude children NHANES III youths NHANES III adults\nCharacteristic\nRacial/ethnic group Whites Blacks Hispanics Whites Blacks Hispanics Whites Blacks Hispanics\nValues are listed as mean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated.\nAnnals of Human Genetics C 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University College London\nL.

Across all three\nlipid traits and all three racial/ethnic groups, 65 associations\nwere significantly associated at p < 1 \u00d7 10-5 and carried\nforward for replication in NHANES III youths.\nReplication in NHANES III Youths and Adults\nNext, we tested if the novel associations observed in the dis-\ncovery GWAS would replicate in an independent study of\nchildren. For the replication study, a total of 1040 youths\n(12\u00ad18 years of age) in NHANES III were genotyped for\n65 SNPs, 52 of which passed assay design and quality control\nmeasures (see Methods and Materials). Three of the 52 asso-\nciations replicated at p < 0.05 in NHANES youths (Table 2).\nwere associated with transformed LDL-C at p = 0.009 and\nwith transformed TG at p = 0.048. All three of the significant\nassociations were in Blacks and the directions of effects were\nconcordant with those of the discovery cohort, although they\nwere of smaller magnitude.\nWe also conducted a second replication study in a large\ncohort of fasting adults (>18 years of age) in NHANES III\nto determine if associations initially discovered in children\nwould generalize to adults. Despite the considerable increase\nin sample size, none of the three associations that replicated\nin NHANES youths were also associated in NHANES adults\n(Table 2). There were, however, three significant asso-\nciations in NHANES adults that were not replicated in\nassociation was the most significant at p = 0.006, yet the\ndirection of effect was in the opposing direction compared\nwith the GWAS discovery study of St. Jude children.\nThe latter two associations most likely represent the same\n(r2 = 1.00) in our discovery GWAS among Hispanic samples.\nAge as a Potential Modifier\nAs mentioned previously and shown in Table 1 and Sup-\nplementary Table S2, mean HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG levels\ndiffer significantly between adults and children/youths. Given\nthat three associations were discovered and replicated in\nchildren but failed to generalize to adults, we explored the hy-\npothesis that genetic associations observed for the lipid traits\nare modified by age. After testing for SNP-age interactions,\nwe observed a significant interaction (p = 0.024) between\nBlacks.\nUp until about the fourth decade of life, participants ho-\n0.96) had consistently lower LDL-C levels compared to CT\nheterozygotes (Table 3) with the largest significant difference\n0.002). Any trend in mean differences is harder to detect later\nin life due to smaller sample sizes for participants with the CT\ngenotype (n ranges from 0 to 7; Table 3). However, we did\nnote that participants with the CC genotype had significantly\nlower mean LDL-C (mean difference = 24.14 mg/dL, p =\nobserved in the 12- to 21-year-olds. These results lead us to\nspeculate that early in life (and possibly much later in life)\none's LDL-C concentration is dependent, in some small part,\nTable 2 Significant replication results in NHANES III.\nGWAS cohort Replication cohort 1 Replication cohort 2\nSt. Jude children NHANES III youths NHANES III adults\nGene/ Coded\nTrait Population SNP location allele (Freq) Beta (SE) p-value Beta (SE) p-value Beta (SE) p-value\nintron\nintron\nintron\nintron\nSignificant (p  0.05) associations in the replication cohorts are bolded and italicized.

We performed a\nGWAS of children undergoing treatment for ALL ascertained\nat St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and attempted repli-\ncation in an independent population of youths and adults\nfrom NHANES III. Three of the 52 lipid-genotype associa-\ntions tested in NHANES III children replicated at p < 0.05,\nthese associations did not generalize to NHANES III adults.\nWe also identified a genotype \u00d7 age interaction with SGSM2\ngenetic basis for the differences observed in lipid levels in\nchildren compared to older individuals.\nAge, as a modifier of genetic association studies, has only\nrecently been highlighted in the literature. In one study of\nthe 100K data of the longitudinal Framingham Heart Study,\nLasky-Su et al. (2008) describe an age-dependent associa-\ntion between ROBO1 and obesity where the association was\nstronger among the pediatric cohorts compared with adult\ncohorts. Although Lasky-Su et al. do not speculate on the\nmechanism behind the age-dependent interaction, it is inter-\nesting to note that heritability estimates for obesity in children\ntend to be higher (Haworth et al., 2008) compared with es-\ntimates in adults (Brown et al., 2003). Somewhat consistent\nwith these observations in obesity are the observations of her-\nitability estimates for the lipid traits. That is, some studies have\nfound that heritability of select lipid levels tends to decrease\nthe review by Snieder et al. (1999) concluded that heritabil-\nity estimates for HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG remain relatively\nstable with age.\nWhile the magnitude of the genetic influence on lipid\nmetabolism may not change with age, the importance of dif-\nferent genes may. In other words, different genes may be ex-\npressed in childhood and adolescence compared to adulthood.\nIn regards to lipid metabolism, longitudinal twin studies sup-\nport this possibility (Williams & Wijesiri, 1993; Friedlander\nstudy determined that different genes are expressed in ado-\nlescence compared to adulthood (Snieder et al., 1997). It is\nalso possible that the same genes function throughout life, but\nare expressed at different levels depending on the decade of\nlife. Supporting this latter hypothesis is the observation that\nyounger patients heterozygous for ABCA1 mutations that\ncause Tangier disease have significantly higher HDL-C levels\nthan older patients heterozygous for ABCA1 mutations (Clee\net al., 2000). There is evidence that normal ABCA1 function\nincreases over time (Clee et al., 2000), which suggests that\npronounced HDL-C deficiency between age groups may be\nhighlighting the inability of heterozygotes to increase their\nABCA1 activity with increasing age.\nGiven the proposed and observed differences between\nchildren and adults for these traits, we purposefully per-\nformed a discovery study in children as this subset may\nallow for discovery of novel genes associated with lipid levels\ncompared with previously published GWAS from adults.\nThe most promising novel candidate as a result of this study\nprotein signaling modulator 2. SGSM2 is ubiquitously ex-\npressed in various tissues, including the liver, and as the name\nimplies, acts as a modulator of G-protein signaling through\nits interaction with a subfamily of RAS proteins (Yang et al.,\n2007). Proteins involved in G protein-mediated signal trans-\nduction are associated with a number of cellular mechanisms,\nincluding differentiation and proliferation. It is also important\nof chromosome 17, including SMG6, SRR, TSR1, MNT,\nAnnals of Human Genetics C 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University College London\nAge Modifies Lipid Genetics\non their biological functions, none of these neighboring\ngenes are compelling candidates for association with lipid\nmetabolism. However, SMG6 is an intriguing candidate given\nits essential association with telomerase activity (Reichenbach\nof Est1p (the S. cervisiae homolog to human SMG6) in yeast\nleads to ever-shorter telomeres over time despite functional\ntelomerase activity (Lundblad & Szostak, 1989). Telomere\nshortening occurs in all mitotic tissues (excluding germline\ntissue) as humans age and has been shown to contribute to\nmortality in many age-related diseases, including heart disease\n(Cawthon et al., 2003). Although these findings require\nfurther study, it is interesting to speculate that these data may\npoint to the involvement of previously unsuspected pathways\ncontributing to lipid metabolism.\nThis study had several limitations, including that the dis-\ncovery GWAS was underpowered due to its small sample size.\nEven with our largest population (n = 282 in Whites), and\nan allele frequency of 5%, we had 80% power to detect only\nlarge effect sizes (R2 > 11%) at genome-wide significance.\nThe majority of published lipid GWAS-identified variants\nhave small effect sizes and explain only a small percentage\nof the variance of lipid traits in the population (Manolio,\nno GWAS has been performed on children with lipid lev-\nels; therefore, it is unknown whether the effect size and/or\nthe significance of these well-known variants remain constant\nover a lifetime.\nAnother limitation is that the discovery cohort consisted\nof children undergoing treatment for ALL. Although med-\nications administered for treatment of ALL are not known\nto affect lipid levels, side effects (such as loss of appetite or\nnausea) of these medications may cause nutritional differences\nthat affect lipid levels. While this possibility was not directly\nmeasured and, therefore, cannot be completely ruled out, we\nobserved that the children in the St. Jude cohort maintained\nhealthy appetites (data not shown).\nDespite the small discovery sample size, we were able\nto detect nominally significant associations, of which three\nreplicated at p < 0.05 in an independent dataset. Further-\nmore, examination of genetic variation known to influence\nlipids in European-descent populations demonstrates that\ntrue associations can be detected in spite of the low power of\nthe study. That is, of the 26 established lipid-associated SNPs\nin 23 genes (including CETP, LPL, GCKR, APOB, etc.;\nTable S4), we detected seven associations with p-values 0.05.\nAs an example, rs328 is a nonsynonymous SNP in LPL and\nhas been shown to have a reproducible effect (19 mg/dL in\none study) (Kathiresan et al., 2008) on lowering TG. In our\ncorresponding to -21.3 mg/dL, which is consistent in both\nthe previously reported magnitude and direction of effect.\nA benefit of using NHANES III data is that it allows for\ngenetic studies in a large, diverse population with a wide\nage range. However, it is a cross-sectional study. Since our\ndata suggest that there may be age-specific genetic influences,\nlongitudinal data are necessary to derive further conclusions\nand to replicate this interaction.\nPostmortem studies on young adults and children have\nshown that atherosclerosis starts early in life (Expert Panel\nBlood Cholesterol Levels Child Adolesc, 1992), even though\nclinical symptoms usually do not manifest until decades later.\nThe potential temporal nature of factors, both genetic and\nnongenetic, which contributes to cardiovascular disease, is\nimportant for better understanding of the etiology of the\ndisease. While it is often assumed in genotype\u00adphenotype as-\nsociation studies that genetic effects are stable over a lifetime,\nthe possibility of important age-effects should not be ignored\nwhen studying the genetics of lipid metabolism.\n"
