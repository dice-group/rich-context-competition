The scale\ncomprised 34 items that measure abusive behaviors related to emotional/psychological abuse (10 items), sexual abuse (6\nitems), child neglect (6 items), child labor (7 items), and physical abuse (5 items). Analysis was based on a convenience\nsample of 317 participants in Nigeria. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation was used to determine construct\nvalidity of its five-factor structure (subscales). The overall internal consistency of the PCMS was .95; subscales of Emotional/\nPsychological Abuse (.93) and Sexual Abuse (.91) were high, whereas those of Child Neglect (.89), Child Labor (.86), and\nPhysical Abuse (.84) were good. Cutoff scores were computed categorizing scores into low/weak, medium/moderate, and\nhigh/strong perceptions of child maltreatment. Strengths and limitations as well as practical applications and implications of\nthe scale for research were discussed.\n",

Yet, knowledge about perception of maltreat-\nment is sparse. Although many factors may be attributed to\nthis sparse knowledge, including variability in legal and con-\nceptual definitions of maltreatment across regions, prolifera-\ntion of terms related to maltreatment, and inconsistent\nexamination of abusive behaviors across studies (Baker,\nsures focus primarily on direct accounts of maltreatment or\nretrospective accounts of childhood maltreatment and few on\ndirect measurement of perception of maltreatment.\nAlthough several measures are used to operationalize cur-\nrent or retrospective experience of child maltreatment, those\nthat measure perception of maltreatment are sparse and pri-\nmarily framed from perspectives of respondents in devel-\noped societies (Baker, 2009; Curtis, Langworthy, Barnes, &\nMacMillan, Trocm\u00e9, Jamieson, & Boyle, 2008; Zolotor\net al., 2009). From these measures, some abusive behaviors\npeculiar to developing societies are missing. However, mea-\nsures operationalized in developed societies may not trans-\nlate to developing societies because of differences in\nsociocultural conditions and experiences. Even within devel-\noped societies, there are indications that perception of mal-\ntreatment differs across racial, cultural, and ethnic\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and vali-\ndate an instrument that measures perception of child mal-\ntreatment in a developing country, Nigeria, where empirical\nknowledge about perception of abusive behaviors is sparse.\nPerception of Maltreatment in Nigeria\nTo date, empirical reports suggest that maltreatment such as\nphysical and sexual abuse, child neglect, and child labors is\nprevalent in multiple settings, including homes, institutions,\nstreets, or places of worship in developing countries\n1Westfield State University, MA, USA\n2University of Lagos, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nSunday B.

Recent reports in Nigeria, for example, suggest\nthat respondents perceived activities such as \"fetching water,\nsplitting firewood, sweeping, farming and cooking\" as child\nlabor (Okoye & Tanyi, 2009, p. 1). Though another recent\nstudy suggest that teachers perceived some physically and\nverbally abusive behaviors such as slapping, beating students\nwith hands, kicking, and pushing students as unacceptable,\nthey also perceived corporal punishment such as flogging of\nstudents with stick or cane as acceptable form of punishment\n(Umezinwa & Elendu, 2012). Sexually abusive behaviors,\nsuch as showing pornographic materials to children and fon-\ndling of breasts and genital of a child, were perceived as\nsexual abuse (Ogunyemi, 2000). Although qualitative details\nof abusive experiences and anecdotal reports of perception of\nabusive behaviors abound in the region, psychometrically\nsound empirical measures of perception of maltreatment\nremain sparse.\nExisting Measures of Perception of\nChild Maltreatment\nSome measures have been developed to examine perception\nof maltreatment and most are particularly operationalized\nthrough hypothetical vignettes, questionnaires (Likert-type\nscales), interviews, focus groups, and scenarios (Bensley et al.,\noped to cover perception of major types of maltreatment,\nwhereas others focus on perception of only one type of mal-\ntreatment, such as physical or sexual abuse (Ogunyemi,\nchometric information is lacking, limiting comparability or\ngeneralizability of findings. Also, most existing measures\nreflect abusive experiences in developed societies that may\nnot cross-validate in developing societies. Nevertheless,\nadvantages of measuring perception of maltreatment in\ndeveloping countries are many, including the possibility of\nunderstanding risks for maltreatment perpetration, child-\nhood maltreatment, and generating maltreatment-related\nknowledge.\nConsiderations for Empirical Evidence\nAfter a careful examination of existing measures of percep-\ntion of maltreatment, empirical knowledge of abusive behav-\niors remains the next reliable source of materials for\ndeveloping perception of maltreatment instruments.\nKnowledge about abusive behaviors deemed to constitute\nlong-term negative consequences for children abounds\n(Beltchman et al., 1992; Silverman, Reinherz, & Giaconia,\n2011), although empirical indicators of abusive behaviors\noften differ from social considerations of abuse across\nregions. Nevertheless, many abusive behaviors transcend\nsociolegal boundaries because of cumulative evidence of\ntheir physical and psychological consequences to children\nand because of their contraindications for societal survival.\nBecause abusive behaviors are best deemed abusive through\nempirical demonstration of their long-term negative conse-\nquences (McGee, Wolfe, Yuen, Wilson, & Carnochan, 1995),\nperception of maltreatment is best operationalized through\nabusive behaviors demonstrated to result in long-term nega-\ntive consequences to children. Beyond empirical knowledge\nof negative consequences of maltreatment for children, fac-\ntors such as sociocultural values and beliefs about maltreat-\nment, knowledge of existing regulations regarding\nmaltreatment (Ashton, 2009), and perhaps childhood experi-\nence of maltreatment are generally believed to influence per-\nception of maltreatment. Thus, integration of these factors\ninto measures of perception of maltreatment will enhance\nvalidity and reliability of developed measures.\nTheoretical/Conceptual Background\nPerception of abusive behaviors considered for current scale\nrests on constellations of theoretical reasonings including\nharm/evidence model (Drake, 1996; Drake & Jonson-Reid,\nto the model, behavior (i.e., commission or omission) may be\nperceived abusive when characteristics of the behavior are\nsufficient to qualify the behavior as maltreatment and when\nsuch characteristics are consistent with existing laws and\nregulations describing the behavior as harmful. Thus, the\nconception of evidence and harm suggests that social and\nlegal considerations are given to perception of abusive\nbehaviors and beliefs and conclusions about abusive behav-\niors are partly influenced by existing laws. As a result of this\nconception, the model may be deemed as empirically flexi-\nble to comprehend perception of maltreatment across regions.\nFor every maltreatment (i.e., emotional/psychological abuse,\nsexual abuse, child neglect, child labor, and physical abuse),\nevidence or indicator of abuse may be visible or invisible and\nmay be derived verbally, visually, or empirically from exist-\ning laws or scientific investigation. Similarly, harm or risks\nof harm may be physical or psychological and may be\ninformed by impairment or strong likelihood of impairment\nin the functioning of a child.\nAs a model for describing perception of maltreatment, the\nharm/evidence model assumes that conditions for perceiving\nbehaviors as abusive differ across types of maltreatment\n(Drake, 1996). As a result, the criteria of evidence or harm for\nperceiving the abusiveness of a type of maltreatment may be\nirrelevant for perceiving the abusiveness of another. The\nmodel has been used to examine maltreatment substantiation\nKohl, Jonson-Reid, & Drake, 2009; Trocm\u00e9, Knoke, Fallon,\nFakunmoju and Bammeke 3\n& MacLaurin, 2009) and legal decisions in contested cases of\nmaltreatment (Fakunmoju, 2009). Its relevance to cross-cul-\ntural understanding of perception of maltreatment cannot be\noversimplified. Therefore, the sociolegal elements that inform\nthe model imply that knowledge of risk factors and regula-\ntions about maltreatment underlie perception of maltreat-\nment, and any scale designed to measure abusive behaviors\nacross cultures must clearly integrate empirical evidence of\nharm (or substantial risks of harm) and sociolegal conditions\nrelated to differential perception of maltreatment.\nMethod\nThe study utilized self-report methodology to collect data\nfrom respondents about their perception of maltreatment.\nActivities preliminary to collecting data included compre-\nhensive review of the literature for questionnaire develop-\nment, evaluation of questions by experts in the United States\nand Nigeria, and pilot testing of survey.\nQuestionnaire Development\nThe questionnaire was developed based on a comprehensive\nreview of theoretical and empirical literature on child abuse\nand neglect at the local and international levels and informal\nexploration of knowledge about maltreatment in Nigeria dur-\n1999). The list of abusive behaviors that were developed and\nexamined should not be deemed as exhaustive of abusive\nexperiences of children in the region but rather represent a\nbroad range of abusive experiences that are frequently (i.e.,\nphysical, sexual, and emotional/psychological abuse as well\nas child neglect) or less frequently (i.e., child labor) exam-\nined empirically. Some abusive behaviors deemed to be\nredundant, rare in occurrence, controversial, religiously/cul-\nturally sanctioned, too restrictive to local experience, incon-\nsistent with international standards, or better amenable to\nqualitative approach were rephrased or excluded from the\nlist. Some behaviors were qualified with specific ages to\nensure conformity with legal definitions and local percep-\ntions of a child in the region.\nExpert Opinion/Review\nAfter developing preliminary items, experts in child abuse\nand neglect in the United States and Nigeria were invited to\ncritique (online) the items for content and face validity as\nwell as for relevance, comprehensiveness, and cultural\nappropriateness. Experts in the United States had back-\ngrounds in academic research (i.e., social work) and child\nprotection practice and experts in Nigeria had backgrounds\nin academic research (e.g., sociology, linguistics, history,\nand international relations) as well as in nonacademic\nprofessions. In addition to providing a critique of the abusive\nbehaviors, experts were instructed to determine whether the\nidentified behaviors may be deemed abusive, whether they\nfit the specified type of maltreatment, whether they capture\nthe range of abusive experiences of children, and whether\nthey are socially, culturally, and legally relevant. Comments\nand suggestions received from the experts were integrated\ninto revision of the items: some of the suggested items were\nintegrated into the survey; some items were rephrased for\ncultural adaptation and relevance to reflect common cultural\ndisciplinary practices and abusive behaviors in the region. In\naddition to ensuring that items were culturally appropriate,\nsome items were revised to ensure that they met the stan-\ndards of child protection in developed countries to enhance\nfuture comparisons with perceptions of maltreatment in other\nregions.\nPilot Test\nThe questionnaire was pilot tested online via SurveyMonkey.\ncomTM by 22 graduate students who completed the survey\nand provided feedback. In general, feedback suggested that\nthe items were clear, culturally appropriate, and relevant to\ncommon experiences of maltreatment of children in the tar-\nget region.\nAbusive Behaviors\nThe items for analysis include 71 abusive behaviors com-\nprising emotional/psychological abuse (16 items), sexual\nitems), and physical abuse (13 items). For each type of mal-\ntreatment, participants were asked, \"Do you think the fol-\nlowing is emotional/psychological abuse?\" \"Do you think\nthe following is sexual abuse?\" \"Do you think the following\nis child neglect\" \"Do you think the following is child labor?\"\nand Do you think the following is physical abuse?\"\nParticipants rated (online through SurveyMonkey.comTM)\nthe extent to which they perceived the 71 behaviors to be\nabusive, using a Likert-type scale of 4 = yes, 3 = maybe or\nsometimes, 2 = don't know, and 1 = no. In addition to respond-\ning to the abusive behaviors, participants also provided their\ndemographic information.\nSample Characteristics\nThe survey collected data through SurveyMonkey.com from\na convenience sample of university students (i.e., graduate\nand undergraduate) and nonstudents who have access to the\nInternet in Lagos State, Nigeria. To reach a broad range of\nparticipants, the link to the survey was forwarded to respon-\ndents in other regions of the country and Internet caf\u00e9 opera-\ntors were consulted to recruit participants who did not have\npersonal access to the Internet. A total of 376 participants\nresponded to the survey. Some respondents were only able to\n4 SAGE Open\ncomplete the survey after more than one attempt due to\nInternet connection problems. As a result, listwise deletion\nwas applied to the data to avoid duplication of responses.\nOnly completed surveys were considered for analysis. After\nexcluding incomplete perception and demographic informa-\ntion, 317 cases remained for analysis.\ndents (n = 73, 23%) in urban centers in Lagos State, Nigeria.\n5.99). Four cases were missing in data analysis. Additional\ndemographic characteristics are reported in Fakunmoju and\nData Analysis\nDescriptive analysis was used to describe the demographic\ncharacteristics of participants. Exploratory factor analysis\n(principal-axis factoring) with promax rotation was used for\nthe extraction of factor structure, loadings, and relevant esti-\nmates associated with the abusive behaviors. Varimax rota-\ntion and principal components analysis were performed to\ndetermine similarities and possible differences in the factor\nstructure derived from promax rotation and principal-axis\nfactoring. Other analyses included computation of means,\nstandard deviations, descriptive analysis for cutoff points,\nbivariate correlations, internal consistency estimates, item-\ntotal correlation technique for item analysis, and indepen-\ndent-samples t test to determine gender differences in\nresponses for the scale. The 71 items considered for analysis\nmeasured specific types of maltreatment based on theoretical\nconsiderations, empirical evidence, and expert judgment.\nExploratory factor analysis followed three processes: (a)\nanalysis of the 71 items to determine their loadings and clus-\ntering around respective factors, (b) examination of loadings\nand correlations to determine their meeting necessary\nrequirements for replication, and (c) removal of problematic\nitems and reanalysis of selected items. Rationale for present-\ning exploratory factor analysis rather than principal compo-\nnents analysis was discussed. Presentations of findings\nfollow recommendations by Neill (2008), as well as presen-\n2010) was used for the analysis, and principal-axis factoring\noption with promax rotation was the extraction method used\nfor the final analysis.\nResults\nData Screening\nData entry errors were avoided because data were exported\nfrom Surveymonkey.com, although this does not preclude\nresponse errors by respondents. Listwise deletion was\napplied to an overall sample of 376 respondents, resulting in\na sample of 317 respondents, which is well above the recom-\nmended sample size of 200 (MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang,\n& Hong, 1999; see also MacCallum, Widaman, Preacher, &\nComrey & Lee, 1992) for conducting exploratory factor\nanalysis. A sample size of 317 for the final 34 items resulted\nin a ratio of approximately 9.06 cases per variable.\nPreliminary Analysis\nA preliminary exploratory factor analysis of the 71 items1\nwas conducted. The analysis was specified to extract five\nfactors (i.e., five types of maltreatment) based on theoretical\nconsiderations, empirical evidence, and expert judgment that\ninformed the development of the items and collection of\ndata. Although all items clustered under respective types of\nmaltreatment (explaining 67.69% of the variance), an exami-\nnation of correlation matrix suggests that many items corre-\nlated greater than .70 on multiple items, suggesting that \"the\nitems are contributing something unique to the construct, and\ntherefore, . . . are not unidimensional\" (Burton & Mazerolle,\n2011a, p. 30). As a result, identified factors may not be repli-\ncable or overidentification of factors might occur when\nextraction of fixed number of factors is not specified.\nMoreover, the retaining of the 71 items might lead to respon-\ndent burden. To address these problems, decisions were\nmade to eliminate items that correlated highly with each\nother. Criteria for selecting items for further analysis included\nthe fact that the items must correlate \"at least .30 with at least\none other item\" (Neill, 2008, p. 6) and that the items not cor-\nrelate .70 and above on two or more items (Burton &\nleaving a total of 34 items for further analysis.\nTable 1 reports means and standard deviations of the 34\nitems and Table 2 reports the correlation matrix. As shown in\nTable 2, correlations between items were significant at p <\n.01 and p < .05. Correlations oscillated between low and\nmoderate. All items correlated at least .30 with at least one\nother item and no item correlated .70 and above on two or\nmore items. For example, only three items correlated highly\nwith each other: Item 11 (fondling the breasts of a child for\nsexual pleasure) correlated highly (.76) with Item 13 (asking\na child to perform oral sex on adults), Item 14 (having sex in\nthe presence of a child) correlated highly (.76) with Item 15\n(engaging in mutual sexual stimulation with a child for sex-\nual pleasure), and Item 30 (inflicting injury or physical pains\non child from punching, kicking, or pushing) correlated\nhighly (.75) with Item 31 (strangling or choking a child so\ntight that the child could not breathe).\nItem Analysis\nTable 3 reports the item-total correlation (i.e., correlations of\neach item with total score of the Perception of Child\nMaltreatment Scale [PCMS]) of the 34 items. The table\nFakunmoju and Bammeke 5\nindicates that the items significantly correlated with the total\nscore of the PCMS (p < .0001), suggesting some meaningful\nrelationships between the items and the overall PCMS. The\noverall correlation was between .46 (Item 29: forcing a\n7-year-old child to perform excessive and tedious household\nchores almost daily) and .75 (Item 8: locking a child younger\nthan 11 years old alone in a room for a whole day as a form\nof discipline).\nTable 1.

Correlation Matrix for the 34 Perception of Child Maltreatment Scale Items.\n*p < .05, two-tailed. **p < .01, two-tailed.\nFakunmoju and Bammeke 7\nFactor Analysis\nPrincipal-axis factoring was used to examine the construct\nvalidity of the PCMS because of the need to specify the fac-\ntors that are theoretically related to the abusive behaviors\nexamined. Based on theoretical considerations, empirical\nevidence, and expert judgment, a five-factor solution of the\n34 items using promax rotation method was specified. The\n34 items clustered into five factors that represent the respec-\ntive types of maltreatment: emotional/psychological abuse\n(10 items), sexual abuse (6 items), child neglect (6 items),\nchild labor (7 items), and physical abuse (5 items). All items\ncorrelated with each other and Bartlett's test of sphericity\ngesting that the correlation matrix was not an identity matrix\nor that the items were related with each other. Measures of\nsampling adequacy (Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin [KMO] = .93)\nwas well above the recommended value of .6, confirming the\nadequacy of sample size for the analysis. Most communali-\nties were very high (as high as .736 for Item 11: fondling the\nbreasts of a child for sexual pleasure), with the lowest com-\nmunality being .384 (Item 33: beating a 5-year-old child with\na belt or stick or other objects), indicating that the items\nshared some common variance (Table 4).\nInitial eigenvalues suggested that the five factors (Factor 1,\nemotional/psychological abuse; Factor 2, sexual abuse;\nFactor 3, child neglect; Factor 4, child labor; and Factor 5,\n5) of the variance (Table 4). The five-factor solution, which\naltogether explained 63.63% of the variance in the overall\nscale, was specified because the factors represented the\ntypes of maltreatment that the items were theoretically pre-\ndetermined to support, based on empirical evidence and\nexpert judgment. As indicated in the scree plot of the factors\n(Figure 1), they corresponded with the point on the scree\nplot where the eigenvalues began to level off and they dem-\nonstrated the point from which considerations of additional\nfactors were theoretically meaningless. For example, from\nthe extraction method based on eigenvalues greater than 1,\nthe sixth factor contained primary loadings on two items\n(Item 26: forcing a child younger than 11 years old to take\ncare of parents/guardians or siblings almost daily; and Item\n29: forcing a 7-year-old child to perform excessive and\ntedious household chores almost daily), which are theoreti-\ncally insufficient to constitute a meaningful, independent\nfactor and lack empirical bases to be differentiated from the\nfourth factor (i.e., child labor).\nTable 4 reports the factor loading matrix of the final solu-\ntion for the PCMS. The criteria for selecting an item were\nthat the item must load on the primary factor .40 or greater\n(Matsunaga, 2010) and that the loading on a secondary fac-\ntor, if any, must be reasonably less than the loading on a pri-\nmary factor. (Factor loadings less than .30 were suppressed\nin the analysis.) An item that loaded .40 or greater on a sec-\nondary factor was regarded as a complex variable. As indi-\ncated in Table 4, all items loaded on their respective factors.\nMost loadings were very strong and as high as .893\n(Factor 1, Item 1: belittling a child habitually). The lowest\nchild to perform excessive and tedious household chores\nalmost daily). There was no indication of double loading or\ncomplex variables.\nPrincipal-axis factoring was chosen for this analysis over\nprincipal components analysis because respective items clus-\ntered around the specific types of maltreatment that they\nwere theoretically predetermined to support and because\nboth analyses produced the same pattern of loadings.\nSimilarly, varimax (orthogonal) and promax (oblique) rota-\ntion methods were examined and both rotation\nTable 3.

Almost all of\nthe secondary loadings (Factors 2-5) occurred on Factor 1\n(emotional/psychological abuse), thus validating the co-\noccurrence nature of maltreatment (Clemmons, DiLillo,\nMartinez, DeGue, & Jeffcott, 2003; Finkelhor, Ormrod, &\nMalik & Shah, 2007) and the theoretical and empirical com-\nplexity of real and perceived impacts of different types of\nmaltreatment on the emotional/psychological well-being of\nchildren (Goldsmith et al., 2009). However, the discrepancy\nbetween primary and secondary loadings was significantly\nlarge or larger, in half of the items, than the loadings in sec-\nondary factors (i.e., the loadings on the primary factors dou-\nbled or almost doubled the loadings on the secondary factors\nin most of the cases). Thus, most loadings with promax and\nTable 4.

Other\nsignificant correlations included sexual abuse and child\nneglect r = .39 (p < .01), sexual abuse and child labor r = .50\n(p < .01), and sexual abuse and physical abuse r = .30 (p <\n.01). Child neglect and child labor r = .62 (p < .01), child\nneglect and physical abuse r = .48 (p < .01) as well as child\nlabor and physical abuse r = .42 (p < .01) also significantly\ncorrelated with each other.\nAs indicated by Cronbach's alpha, the PCMS and sub-\nscales are internally consistent.

This\nwas done for the purpose of providing background data with\nwhich responses of an older and perhaps less literate popula-\ntion in the region might later be compared, as well as for the\npurpose of providing background data that might facilitate\nfuture comparisons with perception of child maltreatment in\nother regions.\nEvidence supporting the construct validity of the PCMS\nwas established through several indices. Item analysis using\nthe technique of item-total correlation suggests that the indi-\nvidual items are related to the overall PCMS. Independent\nloadings of items on respective constructs (subscales) that\ncomprise the scale suggest that the items are related to the\nconstructs that they were theoretically predetermined to sup-\nport. This was further supported by significant correlations\nbetween the PCMS and its subscales: the correlations were\nmoderate for sexual abuse and physical abuse and high for\nemotional/psychological abuse, child neglect, and child\nlabor. The coefficient of reliability, Cronbach's alpha\n(Cronbach, 1984), suggests that both the overall scale and all\nsubscales are internally consistent. The internal consistency\nof the scale and the subscales of Emotional/Psychological\nand Sexual Abuse are excellent and that of Child Neglect,\nTable 6. Mean Scores and Standard Deviations of Perception of\nChild Maltreatment Scale (PCMS) for Gender.\nGroups M SD t\nGender\nNote: Four cases contain missing data on gender. df = 311, p = ns.\nTable 5. Means, Standard Deviations, Correlation Matrix, and Alpha Reliabilities of Subscales of Perception of Child Maltreatment Scale\nNote: PCMS = Perception of Child Maltreatment Scale; E/PA = Emotional/Psychological Abuse; SA = Sexual Abuse; CN = Child Neglect; CL = Child\nLabor; PA = Physical Abuse. M = Mean; SD = Standard Deviation;  = Alpha.\nFakunmoju and Bammeke 11\nChild Labor, and Physical Abuse are good. As indicated by\nthe analysis, scores on PCMS did not differ by gender.\nThrough analysis of percentile scores and the \"criterion of\none standard deviation above and below the mean of the dis-\nwere categorized into high/strong, medium/moderate, and\nlow/weak for future considerations.\nAlthough perception of child maltreatment has been\nexamined in Likert-type and non-Likert-type questionnaires\nand vignettes, PCMS adopts the Likert-type questionnaire\nformat to provide opportunity for future validity and reli-\nability analysis. Standardization of abusive behaviors across\ntypes of maltreatment makes it possible to understand per-\nceptions psychometrically, compare perceptions between\nand across regions, precisely measure the impacts of rele-\nvant variables on abusive behaviors, track possible changes\nin attitudes and beliefs, and determine their effects on\nperception.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThis scale facilitates the measurement of perception of child\nmaltreatment in Nigeria where empirically based instru-\nments are often lacking. As a result of drawing items deemed\nto be abusive from local and international sources, the scale\nprovides the initial step for understanding perception of abu-\nsive behaviors in Nigeria and for cross-cultural validation of\nabusive behaviors across regions. Thus, the standardized\nscale provides opportunity for cross-cultural comparison of\nperception and beliefs about child maltreatment and for gen-\nerating knowledge that may influence policy, research, and\npractice.\nAlthough majority of participants in this study were\nyoung and middle-aged students and nonstudents in urban\ncenters of a state, samples from rural areas and other\nregions, as well as samples of practitioners and profession-\nals who work with children such as teachers and social\nworkers, will provide further validity to this scale. Because\ngenerational differences may influence perception of child\nmaltreatment, including older populations (as well as\nrespondents with lower levels of education) in further\nstudies may provide additional information concerning the\nvalidity of the scale. Although common in many scales, the\nabsence of negatively worded abusive behaviors may make\nthe scale susceptible to response set. This concern may be\naddressed by inclusion of negatively worded questions in a\nscale. Similarly, expansion of response choices from four\nresponse choices to seven response choices also may\nenhance measurement precision, quality of data, and mean-\ningful interpretation of results.\nPractical Applications and Implications\nUnderstanding perception of maltreatment is vital in many\nrespects, because perception has implications for reporting\nmaltreatment, identifying intervention needs of vulnerable\nchildren, formulating and implementing policy, determining\npotential for maltreatment, and susceptibility for victimiza-\ntion of children. The current scale has some practical appli-\ncations and implications for personal, professional, social\nservices, policy, and research. Similar to other measures of\nperception of maltreatment, the PCMS may be useful for\nworking with parents to determine their disciplinary prac-\ntices, their maltreatment values and beliefs, and their suscep-\ntibility to perpetration of maltreatment. It also may provide\nvaluable information about the influence of parenting styles\nexperienced during childhood on perception of maltreatment\n(when combined with appropriate instruments). Because\nperception of abusive behaviors is related to acceptance of\nmaltreatment-related services, PCMS may be relevant to\nunderstanding or predicting clients'responses to intervention\nand service.\nThe PCMS like other measures may be useful for prac-\ntice. Because perception of maltreatment is related to out-\ncomes of assessment of harm or risk of harm, PCMS may be\nuseful for recruitment purposes to determine maltreatment\nperception of practitioners working with children. It also\nmay be useful for identifying the training needs of practitio-\nners as well as their professional suitability for working with\nchildren and families. It may be useful for policy decision\nmaking as it can help to determine general population norms\nand beliefs about maltreatment that may guide policy inter-\nvention necessary to protect vulnerable children. For research\npurposes, the scale may be utilized to examine the influence\nof childhood maltreatment on perception of maltreatment as\nwell as the influence of perception of maltreatment on pro-\npensity to perpetrate or report maltreatment (when combined\nwith appropriate instruments). It also may be utilized to\nexamine the influence of perception of maltreatment on\ninvestigative decisions or outcomes by practitioners in child\nprotection practice in the region.\nConclusion\nAlthough knowledge about perception of child maltreatment\nin developing societies is still in its infancy stage, the absence\nof psychometrically sound instruments to measure the percep-\ntion remains a challenge in utilizing knowledge about percep-\ntion to inform policy, practice, and research. Therefore, the\ndevelopment of this scale, as well as the preliminary informa-\ntion provided through analysis, is a step in the right direction.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
