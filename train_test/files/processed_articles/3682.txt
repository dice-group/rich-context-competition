Since PCDH17 is in the\nsame non-clustered subgroup, the present\nstudy focused on this gene as a candidate\nmoter is a TATA-less promoter containing\nCG-rich sequences that may be susceptible\nto DNA methylation. PCDH17 methylation\nis found in several human carcinomas\nIn the present study, the promoter methy-\nlation status of PCDH17 in bladder cancer\ntissue was examined and compared with\nnormal tissues. In addition, the correlation\nbetween PCDH17 promoter methylation\nstatus and clinicopathological parameters\nwas examined, together with patient out-\ncome, in order to elucidate the clinical\nsignificance of PCDH17 promoter methyla-\ntion in patients with bladder cancer.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and tissue specimens\nThis case\u00adcontrol study included tumour\nsamples from patients who had been diag-\nnosed with bladder cancer between March\nof Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang,\nChina. Criteria for sequential enrolment of\npatients with bladder cancer were: (I) histo-\npathological diagnosis of bladder transi-\ntional cell carcinoma for the first time; (II)\nno history of other tumour; (III) no anti-\ntumour therapy prior to surgery; (IV) avail-\nability of sufficient tumour tissue and\nfollow-up data. Tumour diagnosis, staging\n(Union for International Cancer Control\nsystem) and grading (World Health\nOrganization histological system), treatment\nand follow-up were completed according to\ninternational standards.14 Control bladder\nepithelial tissues were obtained from inpa-\ntients with nonmalignant urinary diseases,\nincluding benign prostatic hyperplasia and\nbladder calculus. Control tissues were exam-\nined pathologically to exclude the possibility\nof incidental tumours. Criteria for sequen-\ntial enrolment of controls were: (I) no\nhistopathological diagnosis of bladder\ncancer; (II) no history of tumour; (III) no\nanti-tumour therapy prior to surgery; (IV)\navailability of sufficient bladder epithelial\ntissues and follow-up data. Following\nsurgery, patients with bladder cancer were\nintervals. Patients were excluded if they left\nthe study half way or less through the\nfollow-up period. Tumour samples were\ncollected during surgery and all tissue spe-\ncimens were promptly frozen in liquid nitro-\ngen and stored at \u00c080C prior to DNA\nextraction and methylation-specific poly-\nmerase chain reaction (PCR).\nThis study was conducted in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki and\napproved by the ethics committee of the\nThird Hospital of Hebei Medical University,\nShijiazhuang, China. Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from each participant.\nDNA extraction, bisulfite\nmodification and\nmethylation-specific PCR\nGenomic DNA was obtained from tissue\nsamples using the DNeasy\u00d5 Tissue Kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the\nmanufacturer's instructions. Prior to methy-\nlation-specific PCR, the extracted DNA was\ntreated with bisulfite to convert unmethy-\nlated cytosines to uracils using the EpiTect\u00d5\nBisulfite Kit (Qiagen) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. The methyla-\ntion status of the PCDH17 gene was exam-\nined by methylation-specific PCR as\nreported previously.7 Briefly, the primer\nsequences for the unmethylated PCDH17\nreaction were as follows: PCDH17\nunmethylated sense (UMS) (sense), 50-\nand PCDH17 unmethylated antisense\n(UMAS) (antisense), 50-AACCCTAACAC\nbase pair product. The primers for the\nmethylated PCDH17 reaction were as fol-\nlows: PCDH17 methylated sense (MS)\n(MAS) (anti-sense), 50-CCCTAACGCAAC\npair product. Each PCR reaction was car-\nried out in a total volume of 25 ml, including:\nTaKaRa TaqTM DNA polymerase\n(TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China),\nchloride, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide\n(TaKaRa Biotechnology). PCR amplifica-\ntion of the modified DNA samples consisted\nof denaturation at 95C for 10 min, followed\nand 72C for 30 s for the methylated reac-\nreaction, and a final extension for all reac-\ntions at 72C for 5 min, using a BD\nBiosciences thermal cycler (Hercules, CA,\nUSA). Water blanks were included with\neach assay. PCR products were separated\non 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium\nbromide, and visualized under ultraviolet\nillumination.\nSamples were scored as follows: methy-\nlation positive, bands visible in the methy-\nlated reaction lane or in both the methylated\nand unmethylated lanes; methylation nega-\ntive, bands visible only in the unmethylated\nreaction lane. Each methylation-specific\nPCR was performed in triplicate, and results\nwere confirmed by repeating methylation-\nspecific PCR assays for all samples.\nStatistical analyses\nFisher's exact test or 2-test was used to\nevaluate the difference in PCDH17 methy-\nlation status between patients with bladder\ncancer and controls, and to assess the rela-\ntionships between PCDH17 methylation\nand clinicopathological parameters. The dif-\nference in overall survival between patients\nwith bladder cancer and methylated\nPCDH17 and patients with bladder cancer\nand unmethylated PCDH17 was assessed\nusing Kaplan\u00adMeier survival analysis and\nlog-rank test. A multivariate Cox\nproportional hazards model was used to\nestimate the independent prognostic effect of\nPCDH17 methylation, controlling for risk\nfactors, including grade, stage and tumour\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSAS software, version 8.0 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA) for Windows\u00d5.\nResults\nTumour samples were collected from a total\nof 115 patients with bladder transitional cell\ncarcinoma (82 male and 33 female patients,\ncomprising 82 transurethral resection and 33\ncystectomy cases (Table 1). Normal bladder\nepithelial tissues (controls) were obtained\nfrom 43 patients with nonmalignant urinary\ndiseases (31 male and 12 female patients,\ncomprising 12 benign prostatic hyperplasia\nand 31 bladder calculus cases. There were no\nstatistically significant between-group differ-\nences in terms of age and sex.\nMethylation of the PCDH17 promoter\nples from patients with bladder cancer\n(Figure 1) and none of the control samples\ncancer, PCDH17 methylation was found to\nbe significantly associated with advanced\nwith the unmethylated gene. No association\nwas found between PCDH17 methylation\nand age, sex, smoking, tumour number or\ntumour morphology (Table 1).\nPatients with PCDH17 promoter methy-\nlation had significantly shorter survival\nTable 1.

Bladder cancer is a disease\ndriven by multistep accumulation of genetic\nand epigenetic changes.6 Epigenetic alter-\nations, including RNA interference, histone\nmodifications and DNA methylation, may\nresult in the silencing of cancer related genes,\nincluding tumour suppressor genes.19\nMoreover, DNA methylation is the most\ncommon epigenetic aberration in human\nmalignancies.20 Therefore, detecting pro-\nmoter methylation changes in tumour\nFigure 2.

DNA methylation is a\nmajor mechanism of inactivation of\ntumour suppressor genes, besides genetic\nchanges. In addition, DNA methylation can\nbe used as a biomarker for tumour diagno-\nsis, surveillance and prognosis, which will\ncontribute to clinical decision-making and\nmethylation of PCDH17 has been reported\nin several human cancers, including bladder\ncancer, but the clinical significance of\nPCDH17 methylation in patients with blad-\nder cancer remains unclear.7,13\nThe human PCDH17 gene is located on\ntumour suppressor in human cancers.7,13\nThe PCDH17 protein is a member of the\ncadherin superfamily. The protocadherins\ndiffer from classic cadherins in that their\nheterophilic interactions with other mol-\necules may be more important for their\nvarious physiological functions than simple\ncell adhesion involving homophilic inter-\ntumour-suppressive functions potentially\ncontributing to cell\u00adcell adhesion, signal\ntransduction and growth control. In one\nstudy, methylation of the PCDH17 pro-\nmoter was associated with the silencing of\ngene expression in oesophageal squamous\ncell carcinoma, which was associated with\ntumour malignancy, while restoration of\nPCDH17 expression was found to reduce\ncell proliferation, migration and invasion.22\nSimilar results were also found in gastric and\ncolorectal cancers.7 Moreover, PCDH17\npromoter methylation may frequently\noccur in urological cancers.13 Thus, the\ncurrent study aimed to investigate the clin-\nical significance of PCDH17 promoter\nmethylation in bladder cancer.\nIn the current study, promoter methyla-\nbladder cancer tissues and was not detected\nin normal bladder epithelial tissues, suggest-\ning that PCDH17 promoter methylation is\ntumour-specific and may be a potential\nbiomarker in bladder cancer. Subsequently,\nthe relationship between PCDH17 promoter\nmethylation and clinicopathological param-\neters was analysed, revealing that methyla-\ntion was significantly associated with\nadvanced stage and high grade tumours,\nlarger tumour diameter and tumour recur-\nrence, which are all known risk factors for\nprogression and poor prognosis in bladder\ncancer.23\u00ad25 The current results suggest that\nPCDH17 promoter methylation may be a\nuseful biomarker for bladder cancer malig-\nnancy, similar to studies investigating\nTable 2.

In addition,\nmultivariate Cox regression analysis indi-\ncated that PCDH17 promoter methylation\nwas an independent predictor for prognosis\nin bladder cancer. The findings of the cur-\nrent study suggest that for patients with\nPCDH17 methylation, aggressive post-\noperative intervention should be performed,\nin order to achieve better prognosis.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that\nother members of the cadherin superfamily,\nwere frequently found to be methylated in\nbladder cancer tissues, and this methylation\nwas found to be associated with malignant\nfindings promoted the current investigation\ninto the clinical significance of PCDH17 in\nbladder cancer, and suggest an important\nrole for the cadherins in terms of disease\nprogression and clinical outcomes.\nThis present study is limited by the small\nsample size. Larger scale prospective studies\nare needed to confirm our findings.\nIn conclusion, the current study sug-\ngests that PCDH17 promoter methylation\nis closely associated with malignant blad-\nder cancer and may be used as an inde-\npendent predictor of clinical outcomes in\npatients with bladder cancer. Detection of\nPCDH17 promoter methylation in tumour\nsamples following surgery may be used to\npredict which patients need more aggres-\nsive postoperative intervention. In add-\nition, DNA methylation is reversible.\nPCDH17 promoter methylation may\ntherefore be a good therapeutic target in\nbladder cancer.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of\ninterests.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
