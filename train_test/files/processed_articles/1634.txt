ID can have several adverse effects on health,\nincluding lower physical work capacity, increased maternal and\ninfant mortality (3\u00ad5), lower children's mental and physical\ndevelopment, and lower cognitive function in adults (6, 7).\nMonitoring iron status of vulnerable groups is an important\ncomponent of the National Health and Nutrition Examination\ndefined in the NHANES with a multivariable approach called\nthe ferritin model (1, 2, 10, 11). The ferritin model defines ID as\nan abnormal value for at least 2 of 3 indicators (serum ferritin,\nerythrocyte protoporphyrin, and transferrin saturation) (10).\nPrevious studies indicate that this approach predicts anemia\nbetter than a single indicator (12) and produces expected pat-\nterns of ID by age and sex and in relation to treatment (10).\nAn approach to estimating body iron developed by Cook et al\n(13, 14) uses 2 indicators, ferritin (also used in the ferritin model)\nand soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and allows the full range\nof the iron status of populations to be evaluated (13, 14). Body iron\n(in mg/kg) for 14 healthy individuals was derived from direct\ncalculation of body iron obtained from serial phlebotomy, a gold\nstandard method for body iron assessment, and was compared\nwith serial measurements of serum ferritin and sTfR obtained\nduring each phlebotomy (14). The amount of storage iron for each\nindividual in the study at baseline was calculated from the amount\nof hemoglobin iron removed to decrease the ferritin concentration\nto ,12 lg/L. The amount of functional iron was calculated from\nthe total body iron minus the storage iron. The logarithm of the\nconcentrations of sTfR and ferritin had a close linear relation with\nbody iron in milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Body iron is\nexpressed as the iron surplus in stores (!0 mg/kg) or the iron\ndeficit in tissues (,0 mg/kg) (14).\n1 From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Atlanta, GA\n(MEC and LMG-S); the CDC, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyatts-\nville, MD (ACL and DAL); the CDC, National Center for Environmental\nHealth, Atlanta, GA (CMP); Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City,\nKS (JDC); Penn State University, University Park, PA (JLB); and the De-\npartment of Internal Medicine, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk,\nVirginia (SRL).\n2 This article is dedicated to the memory of John L Beard, who died on\n3 The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n4 Reprints not available.

In this article, we\nestimate the prevalence of ID defined as body iron ,0 mg/kg and\ncompare these estimates with ID based on the ferritin model\namong children (3\u00ad5 y) and females (12\u00ad49 y). We also evaluate\nassociations of ID based on the body iron and the ferritin models\nwith anemia, indicators of iron status, and indicators of in-\nflammation among females of childbearing age.\nStudy population and sample selection\nresent the total civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the\nUnited States for those years. Because the means of the iron status\nmeasures did not differ between surveys for purposes of this\nanalysis, we combined data from these 2 surveys to increase the\nstatistical power. A stratified multistage probability design was\nused to select participants. Data were collected by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, via household interviews and physical examinations\nin mobile examination centers. Ethical approval was obtained,\nand written consent was received from all participants. Procedures\nfor data collection and analysis are published elsewhere (15, 16).\nThere were 6643 nonpregnant participants who attended the\nfemales aged 12\u00ad49 y. Pregnancy status was determined by urine\npregnancy test results and self-reported pregnancy status. We\nexcluded those who were missing any sTfR or ferritin (n \u00bc 1503)\nvalues, and among children aged 3\u00ad5 y and females aged 12\u00ad49 y,\nwe also excluded individuals missing data on inflammation [in-\ndicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC)\ncount] or other measures of iron status (ie, transferrin saturation,\nerythrocyte protoporphyrin, and hemoglobin) (n \u00bc 54). We lim-\nited the latter set of exclusions to children aged 3\u00ad5 y and females\naged 12\u00ad49 y because transferrin saturation and erythrocyte pro-\ntoporphyrin were not measured in children aged 1\u00ad2 y. Ten chil-\ndren aged 1\u00ad2 y missing CRP and WBC data were also excluded\nfrom the analysis. Our final sample of 5076 individuals included\nexamined.\nParticipants excluded because of missing nutritional bio-\nchemistry values did not differ from those included with regard to\nrace or ethnicity or sex distributions (among children), but they\ndiffered by age. Younger children were more likely than older\nchildren to be excluded because of missing iron status values\n(t test, P 0.01). The amount of blood collected is least for those\naged 1\u00ad2 y and increases with age group to age !12 y. Assays are\nprioritized; thus, assays with lower priority are more likely to be\nmissing because of a lack of available serum, particularly in\nyounger age groups. In addition, the refusal rate for phlebotomy is\nhigher among children than among adults (17). sTfR and ferritin\nconcentrations were measured at the National Center of Envi-\nronmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In\nnostics, Mannheim, Germany), an automated homogeneous im-\nmunoturbidimetric assay, was performed on a Hitachi 912 clinical\nanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (18). Microparticles coupled with\nspecific anti-sTfR monoclonal antibodies reacted with the sTfR in\nthe serum sample to form an antigen-antibody complex, and this\nwas measured turbidimetrically. The manufacturer-specified ref-\nerence range for women for the Roche sTfR is 1.9\u00ad4.4 mg/L (19).\nSerum ferritin was measured using 2 methods. In 2003, a\nsingle-incubation 2-site immunoradiometric assay (BioRad Lab-\noratories, Hercules, CA) was used. This assay was discontinued\nby the manufacturer in early 2004, so ferritin was measured in\nassay on the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN) (20, 21). Latex-bound ferritin antibodies react\nwith the antigen in the sample to form an antigen-antibody\ncomplex, and this was measured turbidimetrically. Because of\nmethod differences between the BioRad and Roche ferritin as-\nsays, we used the publicly released concentrations obtained for\n2003 data using the BioRad assay adjusted to be comparable to\nwas accomplished by 3 piecewise linear regression equations\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (20).We calculated body iron on\nthe basis of sTfR and ferritin concentrations (13, 14):\nFor this calculation, we converted the Roche sTfR concen-\ntrations (20, 22) to those equivalent to the Flowers assay (23) used\nin the development of the body iron model in the original study\n(13, 14). We applied a conversion equation derived from a pre-\nvious comparison of the 2 assays (n \u00bc 40) (18): Flowers sTfR \u00bc\nferritin concentrations for the body iron calculation because\na previous comparison of the Roche assay with the enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay method used by Skikne et al (14) and Cook\net al (13) in the calculation of body iron showed no difference\nbetween these 2 methods [Roche ferritin \u00bc (1.05 3 Cook\ntercept not different from 0; n \u00bc 40; see Figure S1 under ``Sup-\nplemental data'' in the online issue].\nwere measured for children aged 3\u00ad5 y and females aged 12\u00ad49 y\nat the Collaborative Laboratory Services in Ottumwa, Iowa, by\nthe automated Beckman LX20 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)\n(24, 25). Total iron-binding capacity was calculated indirectly\nfrom the iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity plus the iron\nconcentration. Transferrin saturation (%) was calculated by di-\nviding the concentration of serum iron (lmol/L) by the total\niron-binding capacity (lmol/L).\nErythrocyte protoporphyrin for children aged 3\u00ad5 y and\nfemales aged 12\u00ad49 y was measured by a modification of Sassa\net al. (26) by the State of New York Department of Health,\nWadsworth Center, Trace Elements Laboratory (Albany, NY) in\nwhole blood and measured fluorometrically, and a corrected\n(body iron model) and at least 2 of 3 abnormal concentrations of\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nferritin, protoporphyrin, or transferrin saturation (ferritin model)\n(2, 10). Among children aged 1\u00ad2 y, transferrin saturation and\nerythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations were not measured,\nand thus we did not estimate ID based on the ferritin model in\nthis group. The thresholds for defining abnormal values for the\nbiochemical indicators used in the ferritin model are shown in\nTable 1 and are based on those determined for NHANES III (2).\nThe thresholds for low serum ferritin used in NHANES III (,10\nlg/L for children aged 3\u00ad5 y and ,12 lg/L for females aged\n12\u00ad49 y) (1, 2) were based on serum ferritin measured with the\nBioRad assay and had to be adjusted for use with serum ferritin\napplied the following conversion equation for serum ferritin\n,25lg/L to determine the appropriate Roche equivalent thresh-\nHemoglobin and WBC count were measured as part of a com-\nplete blood count in the Mobile Examination Centers using the\nBeckman Coulter MAXM hematology flow cytometer (Beckman\nCoulter Inc, Fullerton, CA) (29, 30).

CRP was measured at the University of\nWashington by latex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade Behring\nStatistical analysis\nWe log-transformed sTfR and ferritin to normalize the dis-\ntributions because sTfR and ferritin concentrations were not\nGaussian. We then calculated geometric means and 95% CIs. We\nestimated the prevalence of ID stratified by age group among\nchildren (age: 1\u00ad2 and 3\u00ad5 y) and among females of childbearing\nbetween inflammation defined by elevated CRP or WBC count\nand the prevalence of ID defined by the body iron model or by the\nferritin model for the total population and stratified by population\nsubgroup.\nTo further examine the potential reasons for concordance and\ndiscordance between the 2 ID models, we conducted several\nadditional analyses among females aged 12\u00ad49 y. Children aged\n1\u00ad5 y were excluded from most of these analyses because of the\nlack of data on transferrin saturation and erythrocyte pro-\ntoporphyrin for children aged 1\u00ad2 y and the low prevalence of\nanemia or ID in children aged 3\u00ad5 y, which led to statistically\nunreliable estimates for this age group.\ncalculated a j statistic for the extent of agreement between esti-\nmates of ID prevalence on the basis of body iron and ferritin\nmodels using PROC FREQ with the AGREE option in SAS for\nWINDOWS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The\ngoal was to estimate, in the absence of a gold standard, the\nagreement between the ID indices. In these analyses, the j statistic\nwas used to compare the agreement between 2 indices of ID (38).\nIf the observed agreement is greater than or equal to chance, then\nj . 0. Landis and Koch (39) characterized j . 0.75 as repre-\nsenting excellent agreement, 0.40\u00ad0.75 as representing fair to\ngood agreement, and ,0.4 as representing poor agreement.\nAmong females aged 12\u00ad49 y, we examined the sensitivity,\nspecificity, and positive and negative predictivevalues of ID based\non the ferritin model compared with ID based on the body iron\nmodel to identify females aged 12\u00ad49 y by a separate indicator of\nfunctional ID anemia. This analysis can help to evaluate the ability\nof the indicators to assess the severity of ID within a population,\nwhich is an important aspect of the performance of the ID models.\nHowever, anemia is a late-stage effect of ID and can also be the\nresult of conditions other than iron status. Thus, whereas this\nanalysis can provide useful information about one aspect of ID\nmodel performance within a population, it does not assess the\nability of the models to detect milder, nonanemic forms of ID.\nThe differences in iron status measures and indicators of in-\nfection and inflammation were examined by the following iron\nstatus categories: 1) iron replete by both the ferritin and the body\niron models; 2) ID by both models; 3) ID by the body iron model,\nreplete by the ferritin model; and 4) ID by the ferritin model, re-\nplete by the body iron model. Finally, we examined the ID prev-\nalence based on the ferritin model and the anemia prevalence over\nWe used Student's t tests to compare differences in geometric\nand arithmetic means and proportions. We used the 4-y mobile\nexam center weight for all analyses as recommended by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (40). We used SUDAAN (version 7.5;\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), ex-\ncept where noted, to account for the complex sample design of\nNHANES. To estimate standard errors for the j statistics for\neach population subgroup, we multiplied the unweighted SE\ncalculated from SAS by the average design effect calculated\nfrom SUDAAN.\nUnreliable estimates were defined as relative SEs !30% but\n40%. Estimates with a relative SE .40% were not reported.\nFor some of our analyses, multiple comparisons were made\nThresholds for laboratory tests of iron status indicative of iron deficiency for\nthe ferritin model1\nAbnormal values\nAge\nSerum\nTransferrin\nsaturation\nErythrocyte\nprotoporphyrin\nlg/L % nmol/L RBCs2\n1 RBCs, red blood cells.\n2 Based on the following conversion equation for the ferritin thresholds\nto be equivalent with thresholds used previously for the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (,10 lg/L for 1\u00ad5-y-olds and ,12 lg/L for\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nacross the iron status indicators. The point of these analyses was\nnot to test joint hypotheses. Rather, we tested a priori expect-\nations about each indicator in relation to the categories of iron\nstatus. Thus, we set statistical significance at P , 0.05 with the\nrecognition that some of the differences in these comparisons\nmay be due to chance (41).\nRESULTS\nMean ferritin concentrations were lower and sTfR concen-\ntrations were higher in children aged 1\u00ad2 y than in all other age\ngroups (Table 2). The prevalence of ID indicated by the body\niron model was also highest in children 1\u00ad2 y. The estimated\nprevalence of ID indicated by both the body iron and the ferritin\nmodels was lower in children aged 3\u00ad5 y than in nonpregnant\nfemales of either age group.\nIn a separate analysis (data not shown), we examined the\nassociation between the presence of at least one indicator of\ninflammation, ie, elevated CRP or WBC count, and ID prevalence\ndefined by the body iron and the ferritin models.

We also provide a comparison of iron\nstatus as defined by the body iron model with iron status as\ndefined by the ferritin model among females of childbearing age.\nThis comparison is important in light of the recent decision to use\nbody iron to define iron status with NHANES data to be con-\nsistent with recent World Health Organization recommendations\nto use ferritin and sTfR to assess the iron status of populations\n(42) and also to simplify survey operations and lower expenses.\nHowever, the ferritin model has been used to assess the preva-\nlence of ID in the US population with NHANES data since the\nmid-1980s, so the advantages of using the body iron model had\nto be weighed against the ability to assess changes in the\nprevalence of ID over time.\nFew other data on body iron calculated from ferritin and sTfR\nconcentrations exist for children or females of ages comparable to\nthose examined in this study, but the patterns seen in those studies\nare generally consistent with those seen here (13, 14, 43). Direct\ncomparison of mean body iron is complicated by differences\nbetween study populations in iron intake, age, anemia, labora-\ntory test methods, and, in the case of estimates based on a con-\ndemographic composition of the sample.\nAgreement between body iron and the ferritin model for ID in\nthis study was fair to good on the basis of j statistics; however,\nthe prevalence of ID was somewhat lower for the body iron\nmodel than for the ferritin model.

The ability to assess the\nentire range of iron status is a major advantage. Body iron reflects\nthe degree of ID or repletion and can be analyzed as a continuous\nvariable, as opposed to the ferritin model, which produces\na categorical, yes-or-no estimate only. In our study, the anemia\nprevalence was higher for females with body iron , 24 mg/kg\ncompared with those with body iron 24 to ,0 mg/kg, which\nsupports the possibility of assessing severity of ID in a population\nwith body iron alone.\nBody iron also has some limitations. For example, the estimate\nof body iron is based on a single phlebotomy study of 14 healthy\nadult white subjects (14). Replication of this study, although\ndesirable, is unlikely given difficulties in receiving institutional\nreview board approval for phlebotomy studies. In addition, the\nchange in iron status in these subjects was measured several\nweeks after a phlebotomy. It is reasonable to assume that a new\nequilibrium had been reached between sTfR and ferritin in the\nplasma pool within this short time period, but this has not been\nrigorously investigated. Furthermore, for ethical and practical\nreasons, the study did not include children or pregnant women,\nso there is only indirect evidence of the validity of the body iron\nAnother limitation of the body iron model is the lack of\na standard sTfR assay method and a standard reference material\n(42). Efforts are underway to develop and characterize a serum-\nbased World Health Organization international reference mate-\nrial for sTFR assays. Until the reference material is available,\ndifferences in sTfR results from different studies need to be\ninterpreted cautiously. In addition, sTfR data must be calibrated\nto the Flowers (23) assay before body iron can be estimated.\nFinally, the lack of sTfR measurements before 2003 limits the\nThe results in the present study support several advantages of\nthe body iron model for assessment of ID. For example, ID based\non body iron was more strongly associated with lower mean\nferritin concentrations than ID based on the ferritin model but not\non the body iron model. Second, compared with the ferritin\nmodel, the body iron model is more strongly associated with\nanemia, a separate, although imperfect, indicator of ID.\nID estimates from either index potentially can be confounded\nby inflammation. But body iron includes sTfR concentrations that\ntend to be less affected by inflammatory disease than most other\niron status measures (46). A recent analysis in children and\ninfants suggested that the low end of the body iron distribution\ndoes not shift with inflammation (47). Similarly, in our analysis\nwe showed that inflammation was not associated with ID based\non the body iron model but was associated with ID based on the\nferritin model. Thus, the ferritin model may slightly over-\nestimate the prevalence of ID in the US population.\nThis study has limitations. First, the ferritin model could not be\napplied to toddlers ages 1\u00ad2 y because transferrin saturation and\nfree erythrocyte protoporphyrin were not measured in this age\nwere adjusted to be comparable with values produced by the\nFlowers (23) sTfR assay used in the development of the body\niron model (18), and an adjustment factor had to be applied to\nmake the ferritin concentrations in 2003 comparable with those\nin subsequent survey years (20). Regression equations used to\nadjust sTfR and ferritin concentrations are based on the as-\nsumption that the assays remain stable over time. Third, the use\nof CRP and elevated WBC count may not completely address\nconfounding by inflammation in ferritin measurements; eg, CRP\ntends to respond rapidly to inflammation and then decline,\nIron status of US nonpregnant females (12\u00ad49 y) by iron status classification using absent body iron and the ferritin models (NHANES 2003\u00ad2006)1\nIron status category\nReplete by\nboth models2\nID by\nboth models\nID by body iron, replete\nby ferritin model3\nID by ferritin model,\nreplete by body iron\nIron status indicators\nIndicators of inflammation (%)\n1 Values are weighted means 6 SEs unless otherwise indicated.

Iron deficient by the ferritin model was defined as at least 2 of 3 abnormal\nconcentrations in ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (see Table 1 for thresholds). Iron deficient by the body iron model was body\niron ,0 mg/kg, where body iron \u00bc 2[log10\nis ferritin. In calculating body iron, we converted the Roche sTfR concentration to be equivalent to the Flowers (23) assay used in the calculation of the body\niron model by applying the following conversion equation: Flowers \u00bc 1.5 3 Roche 1 0.35 (18).\n3 ID by body iron was defined as body iron ,0 mg/kg.\n4 Values are geometric means 6 SEs.\n5 Estimate unreliable: relative SE .40%.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwhereas ferritin stays elevated for a longer period (47, 48).\nFourth, bone marrow examinations, phlebotomy studies, and\nresponse to iron treatment are considered gold standards for the\ndiagnosis of ID--none of which are feasible in a national survey.\nFinally, the small sample size and low prevalence of ID and\nanemia prevented fully evaluating the 2 models in children aged\nIn conclusion, our study indicates that the ID prevalence in-\ndicated by the body iron model follows expected patterns by age\ngroup and that there is fair to good agreement between the body\niron model and the ferritin model for identifying ID children aged\n3\u00ad5 y and good agreement in females of childbearing age. The ID\nprevalence based on the body iron model is lower than that based\non the ferritin model, is less affected by inflammation, and better\npredicts anemia among females of childbearing age. Whether the\nbody iron model is a better indicator of anemia among children or\na better indicator of ID in children and pregnant women merits\nfurther investigation. In addition, further studies are needed to\ncompare the validity of these indices in relation to the gold\nstandard measures of iron deficiency. The ferritin model repre-\nsented an important advance in assessing iron status at the time\nthat it was developed by improving the specificity of measuring\nID. However, newer research supports the importance of the\nfunctional consequences of tissue ID without anemia. By focusing\non the full spectrum of iron status, the body iron model is better\nequipped to assess these additional functional consequences.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--MEC: had full access to all\nof the data in the study, responsibile for the integrity of the data and the ac-\ncuracy of the data analysis; MEC, ACL, CMP, JDC, DAL, JLB, SRL, and\nLMG-S: study concept and design, analysis and interpretation of data, and\ncritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual contents; and\nMEC: drafting of manuscript and statistical analysis.
