Evolving evidence indi-\ncates that an intensive care strategy aiming at\nabrogating intestinal inflammation and endo-\nscopic MH might improve long-term outcome of\nCD with diminished rates of relapse, hospitaliza-\ntions, and the need for surgery.1\u00ad3 A post hoc anal-\nysis of the ACCENT-1 trial demonstrated that\nusing MH as an end point for decision-making\nstrategy was cost-effective.4\nTherefore, MH as the treatment goal and out-\ncome measure is being increasingly considered\nin patients with CD.

Early introduction of tumor\nnecrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in the course\nof the disease, particularly in combination with\nimmunosuppressives, is one strategy for improv-\ning MH.5,6 Similarly, a subgroup analysis of the\nrecent EXTEND trial showed a higher rate of\nMH among patients who received adalimumab\nand had a CD duration shorter than 2 years.7\nThis is further confirmed by a recent study which\ndemonstrated that longer duration of CD, previ-\nous surgery, and previous exposure to immuno-\nsuppressives were associated with poor rates of\nMH. However, none of these factors were inde-\npendently predictive of MH in multivariate\nIdentifying predictors of MH is of great clinical\nsignificance in guiding treatment strategy to treat\nto target of CD.9 The aim of our study was to\nevaluate the probability of achieving MH and\nidentify factors independently predictive of subse-\nquent MH in patients with CD.\nMethods\nPatients and design\nThis was a retrospective, observational cohort\nstudy of all consecutive patients with CD who\nunderwent colonoscopy at the Inflammatory\nBowel Disease Center, The First Affiliated\nHospital of Sun Yat-sen University between\nmined according to the criteria of Lennard-\nJones,10 based on clinical, endoscopic,\nhistopathological, and radiological findings.\nDisease phenotype was established according to\nthe Montreal Classification.11\nThe inclusion criteria for patients enrolled\nwere: (a) age between 18 years and 80 years;\n(b) ulcers detected by (ileo) colonoscopy at the\ninitial endoscopy procedure; (c) at least one\nrepeated colonoscopy after the initial colonos-\ncopy. The exclusion criteria were: (a) patients\nwith incomplete endoscopic procedures; (b)\nage under 18 years; (c) patients with isolated\nproximal small bowel involvement at the time\nThe study protocol was approved by the Clinical\nResearch Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated\nHospital of Sun Yat-sen University and all\npatients signed an informed consent.\nEndoscopic documentation\nAll endoscopic procedures were performed by\nskilled endoscopists with the standard protocol.\nThe static endoscopic picture was recorded in the\npatients' pro forma questionnaire sheet and also\nsaved as a digital version in the endoscopy registry.\nThe score was assessed retrospectively by a central\nendoscopic reading according to the saved endos-\ncopy images. Of note, the second and subsequent\nendoscopic assessments were usually planned\nwithin 6 months by the treating physician to assess\nthe response to therapy (i.e. the scheduled endo-\nscopic follow-up evaluation to assess MH).\nClinical follow up\nThe clinical follow up and additional pertinent\ndata in the medical files of the patients, the\nInflammatory Bowel Disease Center register, and\nthe endoscopy register were reassessed by two\nexperienced gastroenterologists. A pre-determined\nstructured data-sheet was used to collect data from\nthe medical files at the time of each endoscopic\nprocedure, including the indication for procedure,\ntype and findings of the procedure, medical thera-\npies being used at the beginning of the study\nperiod, any treatment adjustment after endoscopic\nprocedures, general wellbeing, and symptoms at\nthe time of each endoscopic procedure and within\n3\u00ad6 months after procedure.\nDefinitions and outcomes\nThe primary outcome of the study was MH, and\nthe secondary outcome was endoscopic improve-\nment. The endoscopic score system was adopted\nfrom that of af Bj\u00f6rkesten and colleagues.12\nBriefly, the endoscopy reports were scored\naccording to mucosal activity in the most affected\narea as: 0 (remission); 1\u00ad2 (mild inflammatory\nactivity: light mucosal erythema or granularity or\naphthous inflammation, without ulcerations);\n3\u00ad4 (moderate activity: superficial ulcerations);\n5\u00ad6 (severe activity: deep ulcerations, with a\ndiameter of under or over 2 cm). The criterion for\nendoscopic improvement was a decrease in the\nendoscopic score of at least two. MH was deter-\nmined as a mucosal activity score of 0\u00ad2. The\nduration of follow up was calculated from the\ntime of the index endoscopy up to the time of\nMH or endoscopic improvement, loss of follow\ndefinition of medical treatment adjustment after\nendoscopic procedure was adopted from Bouguen\nR Mao, Y Qiu et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 455\nand colleagues8 as follows: the introduction or\nswitch of immunosuppressives; the introduction,\noptimization, or switch within the class or out of\nthe class of biologics; or change in both immuno-\nsuppressive agents and biologics.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical parameters were com-\npiled and summary statistics were calculated.\nData were described using medians with inter-\nquartile range (IQR) for continuous data and per-\ncentages for discrete data. Fisher's exact test or\nchi-square tests were used to compare the non-\nparametric categorical data between groups. The\ncumulative probabilities of MH and endoscopic\nimprovement were estimated using the Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier method. For computing the cumulative\nprobability of achieving MH, the Kaplan\u00adMeyer\nanalysis commences at the first endoscopy and is\nterminated at the time point of the first procedure\nduring which MH/improvement was observed\nor at the last known follow-up endoscopy.8\nUnivariate analyses using the log-rank test were\nperformed to identify factors predictive of each\nevent. Factors analyzed by univariate analysis\nwith p < 0.1 were integrated in multivariate Cox\nregression.

MH is increasingly considered as the treat-\nment target for CD, but the feasibility and the\nrate of achievement of MH in clinical practice\nremains unclear. Data from 1-year trials, i.e. the\nEXTEND trial and ACCENT I trial, indicate\nSONIC trial, MH occurred in 43.9% of the\npatients who received combination therapy at 6\nmonths.6 Bouguen and colleagues8 found that the\ncumulative probabilities of MH were 12.7% and\nmedical treatment based on a treat-to-target\nstrategy, respectively. However, data regarding\nthe MH rate in the long term are limited.\nColombel and colleagues6 reported that 73.1% of\npatients receiving early combination therapy\nachieved MH at week 104. In the present study,\nthe cumulative probabilities of MH at 26 weeks\n3, and 4 years, respectively. The reason for the\nrelatively low MH rate may partly be due to the\nlimited use of biologics in our study. TNF-\nantagonists were introduced only in 49 (18%)\npatients. Moreover, a large number of patients\nincluded in our study had experienced complica-\ntions and perianal lesions, which may also explain\nthe relatively lower MH rate, as MH is more\nachievable for patients with early CD.7\nLittle is known about the predictors of MH. Until\nnow no controlled prospective trials have been\ndesigned to identify predictors of MH. Some\nstudies reported that shorter disease duration was\nassociated with higher MH rate.7 In contrast, per-\nianal disease at CD diagnosis and prior enteric\nfistula and stricture were associated negatively\nwith MH.15\u00ad24 Our study showed that risk factors\nfor lower probability of MH were prior enteric fis-\ntula and perianal disease at CD diagnosis. The\nincidence of internal fistula, perianal disease, and\nstenosis implies a type B2/3 disease behavior with\na more aggressive disease progression, which is\nconsistent with previous studies.20 Moreover, our\nstudy demonstrated that a shorter time between\nendoscopic procedures and subsequent medical\ntreatment adjustment was associated with a\nhigher rate of subsequent MH. These findings\nmay be interpreted as patients who are more\nclosely followed endoscopically also have higher\nprospects for attaining MH thereafter. While the\nreason for this association cannot be definitively\nascertained from the present study, it is possible\nthat the result of a higher chance of active inflam-\nmation being disclosed by repeated endoscopies\nand prompt medical interventions in these\npatients, and/or that this subgroup of patients\nundergoing more frequent endoscopies was cared\nfor by more proactive physicians. Recently, the\nconcept of treat-to-target strategy, which employs\nthe principles of systematic follow up of patients\nand optimization of all available treatments to\nreach the target in the treatment of CD, has been\nincreasingly advocated.9 Bouguen and colleagues\nreported that treat to target is achievable by\nappropriate endoscopic assessment and treat-\nment adjustment in patients with both CD8 and\nulcerative colitis25. This demonstrated the poten-\ntial of adjusting therapy on the basis of an objec-\ntive treatment target according to a predefined\nFigure 2.

However, the follow up of these stud-\nies was only 62 weeks and 76 weeks, respectively.\nOur present study evaluated the role of endo-\nscopic assessment in treat to target of CD with\nlong follow up. Based on our result, we formu-\nlated an algorithm for the treat to target of the\nMH approach in patients with CD based on\nendoscopy assessment and subsequent treatment\nadjustment (Figure 5).\nIntroduction of biologics early in the course of the\ndisease, particularly in combination with immu-\nnosuppressive agents, is one strategy for obtain-\ning higher rates of MH, as demonstrated in the\nSONIC and step-up/top-down trials.5,6 In our\nstudy, the use of biologics was significantly asso-\nciated with an increased rate of endoscopic\nimprovement (p = 0.01), but only showed a trend\nfor higher MH that did not reach statistical sig-\nnificance (p = 0.07). This may possibly be due to\nthe relatively small number of anti-TNF-treated\npatients and to the fact that biologics were mainly\nused in a step-up fashion in our center, which is\nknown to be associated with a less favorable\nresponse to biologics.\nKiss and colleagues26 reported CRP at week 12\nafter adalimumab treatment significantly correlated\nTable 2.

Similarly, our results demonstrated\nthe CRP normalization at week 12 independently\npredicted MH and endoscopic improvement.\nHowever, our study failed to demonstrate a positive\nassociation between baseline CRP and subsequent\nMH.

Schnitzler and colleagues2\nreported that patients with CD who experienced\nendoscopic improvement had similar long-term\nclinical outcomes compared with patients who\nexperienced complete MH. In patients with CD,\nendoscopic response could serve as a reliable pre-\ndictor of clinical outcome based on a post hoc\nanalysis of data from the SONIC trial.28 Our\nresult showed that the cumulative probabilities of\n48, and 60 months, respectively.
