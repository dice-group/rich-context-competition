Long\nPo l i c y m a k e r s a t both the federal\nand state levels are interested in know-\ning how many private employer health\nplans are self-insured andin identifying forces\nthat affect this number.1 These trends are im-\nportant because fully insured plans and self-\ninsured plans are subject to different regula-\ntory regimes.2 State insurance laws, which are\ntraditionally far more comprehensive, cover\nonly fully insured products purchased from\ninsurers. In contrast, federal laws cover both\ntypes of plans, but with comparatively limited\nprovisions. Recently, however, federal regula-\ntion of health coverage has been extended to\ncover new dimensions.3 The ultimate reach of\nregulatory provisions in affecting enrolled\nworkers and their dependents, therefore, de-\npends on the extent of self-insurance among\nemployers.\nNumerous provisions of state insurance\nregulation may cause an increase in the pro-\npensity of employers to self-insure. State\nregulations frequently mandate that certain\nbenefits be covered in all policies issued by\nhealth insurers, potentially adding to the cost\nof fully insured plans.4 Other regulations that\nmay add to the relative cost of fully insured\nplans are continuation of coverage and rate\nregulation in the small-group market and lim-\nits on preexisting conditions.5 States levy\ntaxes on the premium revenues of insurance\ncompanies, which also raise the cost of fully\ninsured plans.6 Employers whose workplaces\nextend across many states may object to the\nadded complexity or inequity among their\nworkers as a result of having to offer different\nbenefits in different states.7 Although the\ntrend over this decade toward increasing state\nregulation of the small-group market was\nthought to add to the incentive to self-insure,\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Ac-\ncountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 included\nsome provisions that apply to both fully and\nself-insured plans, thereby contributing to a\nmore level playing field.8\nRecent dynamics in the health insurance\nmarket also may be leading to changes in self-\ninsurance. The large cost increases of the late\nfor cost savings.9 There were rapid changes in\nthe types of products available to employ-\ners--especially in the availability of health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs) to em-\nployers of all sizes.10 Small employers had im-\nproved access to HMOs. For large employers\nlooking to control costs, this trend first pro-\nvided new, fully insured alternatives to self-\ninsuring, but very recently there has been talk\nof self-insured employers' being able to pur-\nchase access to HMOs while remaining self-\ninsured--a phenomenon often termed \"self-\ninsured HMOs.\"\nIn this paper we analyze data from two\nlarge surveys of employers about their health\ninsurance benefit offerings. The data provide\nevidence on recent trends in employers' pro-\npensity to self-insure and employees' propen-\nsity to enroll in self-insured plans. We exam-\nine some possible causes of these trends.\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nSusan Marquis and Steve Long are senior economists at RAND in Washington, D.C.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a y / J u n e 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We used sampling weights to\nmake estimates for three different units of ob-\nservation: establishments, employees, and in-\nsurance plan enrollees.\nWe examined trends in employers' deci-\nsions to self-insure by comparing rates in the\nseven states that are represented in both sur-\nveys: Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New\nYork, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\nthese seven states, and the 1997 survey in-\ncluded 8,711 employers. We also examined\nseveral hypotheses about correlates of the\nself-insurance decision using the full national\nThe surveys, based on similar question-\nnaires and definitions, used computer-\nassisted telephone interviews averaging thirty\nminutes each to collect the data. The inter-\nviews were conducted with the person or per-\nsons in each establishment most knowledge-\nable about health benefits and firm and\nworker characteristics.\nA number of specialized concepts and defi-\nnitions were used in this work. We based our\ndefinition of self-insured plans on the respon-\ndent's self-assessment. In 1993 the question\nasked about self-insured status was, \"Are you\nself-insured, or are you fully insured?\" In 1997\nthe question was, \"Is this a plan that is pur-\nchased from an insurance company or HMO,\nor is it a self-insured plan?\" Further explana-\ntion of this distinction, involving whether the\nfirm or the insurer bears financial responsibil-\nity for workers' medical claims, was provided\nin both surveys if needed.14 A self-insured em-\nployer was defined as one that offered one or\nmore self-insured plans. Classification of a\nplan as an HMO also was based on the re-\nspondent's self-assessment, aided by a com-\nplete definition of plan types if needed. Be-\ncause self-insurance status and plan type\nwere collected independently, we were able to\nidentify self-insured HMOs.\nAlthough the sample and analysis unit is\nthe establishment (a physical location of busi-\nness), for many analyses we categorized es-\ntablishments according to the size of the firm,\nwhich includes employees at all locations na-\ntionwide. This is because insurance decisions,\nincluding the decision to self-insure, typically\nare made at the regional or national level in\nfirms with several establishments. As a meas-\nure of the extent of a firm's multistate busi-\nness operation, we used the number of the\nfirm's employees working in the same state as\nthe sampled establishment, divided by the\nnumber of the firm's employees nationwide.15\nWe classified establishments according to\nregulatory and market characteristics of their\nlocation. The degree of small-group reform in\nthe state was measured as the interaction be-\ntween whether all insurance products must be\nguarantee-issued and how tightly premium\nrates are regulated, if at all. We defined three\nclasses of reform: high (all products guarantee-\nissued; rates cannot be based on health status,\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It is defined as \"low\" if\nthe community is in the bottom quartile and\n\"high\" if in the top quartile.\nFinally, we measured both the current\nhealth insurance premium level and the\nchange in the premium from the previous\nyear. The current premium level is based on\nplan-specific data, reported separately for\nindividual and family coverage. For estab-\nlishments offering multiple plans, we com-\nputed an average premium for the estab-\nlishment by weighting the premiums for the\nseparate plans by the number of enrollees. The\nlatter measure is based on an establishment-\nlevel question about change in total health in-\nsurance cost per enrollee compared with the\nprevious plan year.\nRESULTS\nclined in the seven states studied. The per-\ncentage of self-insured establishments fell in\nall size groups (Exhibit 1), and the decline\nranged from 67 percent among small employ-\ners to 11 percent among large employers. Over-\nall, in the seven states the number of self-\ninsured employers fell from 19 percent to 13\npercent. Among employees enrolled in their\nemployer's group plan, the number enrolled in\na self-insured plan fell 18 percent. The likeli-\nhood of being in a self-insured plan rises\nstrongly as firm size increases.\nThe decline in self-insurance appears to be\nrelated to rapid change in market forces dur-\ning this period. Foremost was a very strong\nshift toward employers offering managed care\nplans. The percentage of employers offering\nonly fully insured HMOs soared from 12 per-\ncent to 35 percent in the four-year period in\nthe seven states (Exhibit 2).17 Counting em-\nployees facing this type of offer, rather than\nemployers, yields a similar conclusion. The\nshift to managed care came at the expense of\nnearly all other combinations of plan offerings\nand occurred among employers of all sizes but\nwas especially marked among workers in\nfirms with fewer than 100 workers, which are\nshown separately in Exhibit 2.\nSelf-insured HMOs represented a small\npart of the picture (2 percent of estab-\nlishments and 6\u00ad9 percent of employees).\nHence, if there is to be a resurgence of self-\ninsurance through the vehicle of self-insured\nHMOs, it has yet to emerge.\nThe strong move to HMOs appears to have\nbeen driven, at least in part, by cost considera-\ntions.

The advent of these pro-\nvisions over the study period may have been a\nfactor in offsetting shifts to self-insurance that\notherwise might have occurred.\nIn contrast, the long-standing observation\nthat multistate employers are more likely to\nself-insure is borne out in our data.
