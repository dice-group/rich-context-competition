This paper uses two data sets describing cannabis consumption in the United\nStates and Europe to highlight (1) differences in inferences about sub-populations based\non the measure used to quantify cannabis-related activity; (2) how different measures\nof cannabis-related activity can be used to more accurately describe trends in cannabis\nusage over time; and (3) the correlation between frequency of use in the past-month and\naverage grams consumed per use-day. Key findings: focusing on days of use instead of\nprevalence shows substantially greater increases in U.S. cannabis use in recent years;\nhowever, the recent increase is mostly among adults, not youth. Relatively more rapid\ngrowth in use days also occurred among the college-educated and Hispanics. Further, data\nfrom a survey conducted in seven European countries show a strong positive correlation\nbetween frequency of use and quantity consumed per day of use, suggesting consumption\nis even more skewed toward the minority of heavy users than is suggested by days-of-use\ncalculations.\nKeywords: cannabis, marijuana, substance abuse research, drug use metrics, drug use trends\nINTRODUCTION\nIn substance abuse research, \"use\" is operationalized in terms of\nprevalence (i.e., how many individuals used a drug within a given\nperiod of time). However, prevalence is neither the only nor the\nideal metric available. Other metrics, such as quantity of drug\nconsumed may provide more insights into behaviors associated\nwith intoxication and health-related outcomes, contact with law\nenforcement, and flows of money into black markets.\nStudying users is perhaps the norm in substance abuse epi-\ndemiological research. One can ask a sample of people (e.g., in\nhouseholds or students in classrooms) questions about their drug\nuse in order to learn, for example, how many used a given drug\nin the past-year, and on how many days did they consume. This is\nundoubtedly a useful perspective. We might find out, for example,\nthat most marijuana users did not purchase the marijuana they\nconsumed most recently; instead, it was shared with them or given\nto them for free.\nHowever, imagine we could instead sample on the drug or,\nequivalently, the episode of drug use, rather than on the user. That\nwould be like taking a random sample of all the grams consumed\nover the past-year, and asking: what are the users of this drug\nlike? As we report below, from that perspective 88% of marijuana\nis consumed by someone who most recently obtained marijuana\nby purchasing it (as opposed to sharing or receiving it as a gift).\nThe two perspectives suggest very different conclusions concern-\ning the relative importance of purchases vs. gifts in retail marijuana\ndistribution.\nIf the goal is to understand the drug-using careers of users,\nwe might prefer to study a sample of users. But if the goal is to\nunderstand market-related quantities like how demand is affected\nby price or the roots of systemic violence, following the drug could\nbe more valuable.\nNaturally it is not literally possible to sample on chunks of the\ndrug. No one assigns each gram a unique identification number,\nlet alone a phone number that survey researchers could call. How-\never, we can approximate this by weighting respondents by the\nquantities they consume. The purpose of this paper is to use a\nvariety of data sets describing cannabis consumption to highlight\nthe sometimes substantial differences in inference that arise when\nfocusing on consumption, not consumers.\nBefore proceeding let us illustrate the principle numerically\nwith a simple, extreme, and stylized example. Suppose there are\njust two kinds of cannabis users, \"light\" and \"heavy,\" who use 1 g\nand 1 ounce per month, respectively. Suppose further that 80% of\nusers are light users, so there are four light users for every heavy\nuser. Obviously when sampling on users, one would report that\nmost cannabis users are light, few are heavy.\nBut since each heavy user consumes about 28 times as much\nas a light user (1 ounce = 28.35 g), the heavy users consume\nthat different conclusions can be drawn when observing light vs.\nheavy users [e.g., (1)].\nFurthermore, if over time there were no change in the number\nof cannabis users, but the ratio of light vs. heavy users switched\nBurns et al. Statistics on cannabis users\neven though there was no change whatsoever in the number of\nusers.\nBecause there is actually a continuum of usage, the difference\nbetween studying cannabis users and studying cannabis use is\nnot so extreme, but it is large enough to matter, as we demon-\nstrate below with a variety of examples. The basic observation is\nthat when a covariate is positively correlated with quantity con-\nsumed conditional on there being some use, then individuals with\nthat covariate account for a greater share of use than they do of\nusers. For example, male users consume more than female users,\nso males account for a larger share of consumption than they do of\nprevalence. Conversely, users who are college graduates consume\nless intensively than do less educated users, so college graduates\naccount for a smaller share of cannabis consumption than they do\nof cannabis users.\nDATA\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a\nnationally representative survey consisting of interviews con-\nducted with randomly selected individuals ages 12 and older.\nNSDUH contains data on the prevalence of the use and abuse\nof alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances. The survey contains\nsample weights that were used for all analyses to provide national-\nof comparable data on past-year and past-30-day cannabis use\n(which we will refer to as\"past-month use\"throughout this paper),\nthe number of use-days in the past-month for those who used in\nthe last month, the number of use-days in the past-year for others\nwho used in the last year, whether cannabis was purchased in the\nlast month, the number of purchases in the last month for those\nwho bought cannabis in the last month, and information about\nthe most recent purchase of cannabis (amount purchased, cost\nof purchase, location of purchase, etc.). Starting in 2004 NSDUH\nalso contains information about use of blunts (hollowed out cigar\nshellsfilledwithcannabis),whichwasusedtorefinecountsof past-\nmonth cannabis users and use-days for those years the item was\navailable. While the impact of including survey items about blunts\nis small, it should be noted that counts of cannabis users and use-\ntion,NSDUH contains demographic information for each respon-\ndent that can be used to characterize users. One limitation of\nNSDUH is that it relies on self-report, which may introduce social\ndesirability or recall bias (2). Another limitation of NSDUH is that\nit does not collect data from some populations that are known to\nhave higher rates of illicit drug use, such as the incarcerated and\nhomelesswhoarenotinshelters(SAMHSA),butthiscanbeshown\nto be a relatively insignificant deficiency in the case of cannabis (3).\nThe EU Drugs Markets II (EUMII) web-survey conducted by\nvan Laar et al. (4) gathered information from a convenience sam-\ndid not sufficiently answer the questions about quantity con-\nsumed (days per month, units per day, and grams per unit). For\nadditional analyses of the EUMII cannabis data, see Caulkins et al.\n(5). As survey respondents often have difficulty answering directly\nquestions about quantity consumed per day, this survey's great\ninnovation was to present respondents with picture cards, visually\ncontrasting various amounts of cannabis with both a ruler and a\ncredit card, to facilitate their ability to estimate how much they\nhave consumed.\nThe EUMII survey has a number of limitations. Since it is an\ninternet survey based on a convenience sample largely recruited\non the web (i.e., no sampling frame), there is an obvious selection\nbias toward those who (1) use the internet, (2) are not concerned\nwith sharing data about illegal behaviors online, and (3) think that\nvolunteering to complete marijuana surveys is a good use of their\ntime. van Laar et al. (4) report that while internet penetration\nin the EU is high (72% of the population), there was variation\namong the selected countries \u00ad 49% in Bulgaria, 51% in Portu-\ngal, 58% in Italy, 71% in the Czech Republic, 84% in the United\nKingdom,90% in the Netherlands,and 92.9% in Sweden (Internet\nWorld Stats 2011). Furthermore, recruitment methods differed by\ncountry and van Laar et al. note that most countries employed\nstrategies that biased the sample toward attracting students and\nyoung adults.\nAlso some respondents may try to complete the survey multiple\ntimes or give unrealistic answers. Since incentives were not offered\nto complete the survey, we are less concerned about the former. As\nfor the latter,which is not unique to web surveys,van Laar et al. (4)\nscreened the data, setting unrealistic values to missing and drop-\nping respondents \"who indicated consuming more than 20 units\n(joints, pipes etc.) on an average use day\" (68).\nThese limitations preclude using the EUMII data for estimating\nrelative numbers of low- vs. high-frequency users, or for contrast-\ning patterns across countries, but they should be of less concern\nwhen using the data as we do here to explore the correlation\nbetween use-days in the past-month and the average number\nof joints consumed per use day, particularly since the results are\nconsistent with analyses from the U.S. (6) and Canada (7).\nIn the next three sections,we highlight (1) differences in inferences\nabout sub-populations based on the measure used to quantify\ncannabis-related activity (past-year use, past-month use, past-\nmonth days of use,any past-month purchase,and number of past-\nmonth purchases); (2) how different measures can be employed to\ndescribe more accurately trends in cannabis usage over time; and\n(3) the correlation between frequency of use in the past-month\nand average grams consumed per day.\nNational survey on drug use and health asks respondents whether\nthey used cannabis in the last year, whether they used in the last\nmonth and, if so, how many days they used within the last month.\nIt also asks whether they bought in the last month and, if so, how\noften. For any given subpopulation, say males, these variables let\none define five proportions:\n1. Males' share of past-year users.\n2. Males' share of past-month users.\n3. Males' share of past-month days of use.\n4. Males' share of those who purchased within the last month.\n5. Males' share of past-month purchases.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | Addictive Disorders and Behavioral Dyscontrol November 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 138 | 2\nBurns et al. Statistics on cannabis users\nSometimes the proportions are all very close. Often they vary,\nsometimes substantially. As a general rule, for any attribute that is\npositively associated with cannabis use, the strength of that associ-\nation grows as one moves through the list of the five proportions.\nFor example,males use more cannabis than females. That is appar-\nent even in simple past-year prevalence; males account for 60% of\npast-year cannabis users identified by the 2011 NSDUH. That pro-\nportion grows to 64% of past-month users, 69% of past-month\ndays of use, 70% of past-month purchasers, and 72% of past-\nmonthpurchases.Table1showsthesefiveproportionsforavariety\nof groups.\nVariation across some rows is striking. Only 14% of past-year\ncannabis users meet the criteria for cannabis abuse or dependence,\nbut they account for 26% of past-month days of use and 37% of\npast-month purchases. Perhaps the most striking contrast con-\ncerns blunts. Only 27% of past-year cannabis users report using a\nblunt within the last month,but those individuals account for 73%\nof cannabis purchases. On the protective factors side, the affluent,\nmarried, and college grads tend to use moderately; for example,\ncollege graduates account for 19% of past-year users,but only 13%\nof days of use and just 5% of purchases.\nThere is literature examining disparities in criminal justice\nsanctioning of drug users [e.g., (8\u00ad10)]. With varying degrees\nof sophistication, these studies compare for given groups (e.g.,\nAfrican-Americans) the share of some measure of sanctioning\n(arrests, convictions, incarceration, etc.) with their share of use or\na use-related proxy. If the groups'shares of all use-related measure\nwere the same, then it would not matter much which measure was\nused. But figures for those who were ever arrested and booked (see\nTable 1) show that is not the case. Hence, to get a more complete\npicture of disparities,such studies should probably do the compar-\nison with the full range of measures considered in Table 1. This is\nnot a novel idea; Brownsberger (11) noted something similar with\nrespect to alternate measures of crack use. But it is important.\nTo give one example, consider the distinction between using\nand purchasing. Possession and use per se carry relatively little\nrisk of arrest. As Nguyen and Reuter (10) show, the probabil-\nity of arrest per episode of cannabis use in the United States is\nonly about 1 in 3,000. Purchasing by contrast may carry a greater\nrisk of arrest, although there is some question about the propor-\ntion of drug arrests attributable to purchase transactions (12). If\nthe number of purchases per day of use were the same across all\ngroups, this would be a distinction without a difference. However,\nas Figure 1 shows, young people collectively report making more\npurchases per day of reported use than do older users. For exam-\nple, 12\u00ad17-year-olds report fewer past-month days of use than do\nStatistics indicating that the burden of arrest falls dispropor-\ntionately on youth relative to their share of all users (9) may not be\nprima facie evidence of discrimination if making more purchases\nper day of use increases the risk of arrest per year of use. For exam-\nreportinghavingbeenarrestedforadrugoffense,eventhoughthey\nTable 1 | Various populations' shares of cannabis-related activity by five different measures of participation, 2011 NSDUH.\nPast-year\nusers (%)\nPast-month\nusers (%)\nPast-month\ndays of use (%)\nPast-month\npurchasers (%)\nPast-month\npurchases (%)\nRisk factors\nUsed an illegal drug other than cannabis in\nPast-month use of\nMet criteria in past-year for\nProtective factors\naIndicates that proportion is statistically significantly different from proportion of past-month users (p < 0.05).\nBurns et al. Statistics on cannabis users\nFIGURE 1 |The reported number of purchases per day of use varies\ndramatically with age in U.S. household survey data, 2011 NSDUH.\naccount for only 35% of past-year cannabis users. That appears to\nbe a disproportionate arrest burden, but 18\u00ad25-year-olds account\nfor 46% of buys reported in the past-month.\nLikewise,therateof arrestamongpast-yearadultcannabisusers\nis considerably higher for those with less than a high school educa-\nmore buys per day of use, so the number of arrests per 100 buys is\nactually slightly below average (1.1 vs. 1.2 for adults overall).\nTable 2 illustrates patterns for race and educational status.\nNon-Hispanic blacks represent 13% of past-year cannabis users\nvs. 23% of drug arrests reported by those users, but they report\nmaking 24% of the buys. Thus, some of their higher arrest rate\nmay be a consequence of their purchase patterns. Indeed, Ram-\nchand et al. (13) suggest that African-Americans may not only\nmake more buys but also make riskier buys (e.g., more likely to\nbuy outdoors).\nIn sum, the measure of use matters. Therefore when drawing\ninferences about use one should consider which measure of use is\nappropriate in any given context and/or test to see if the conclu-\nsions are robust with respect to the measure of use employed.\nThe analysis above pertains to snap-shots based on the 2011\nNSDUH, yet trends over time provide another interesting per-\nspective. In this section, we explore trends in cannabis use from\nmonth use-days provides additional information about changes\nin cannabis usage not apparent when merely studying prevalence\nof use.\nFigure 2 shows the change since 2002 in four measures of\ncannabis use: past-year prevalence, past-month prevalence (past-\nmonth users), number of daily/near-daily users (those who used\ncannabis 21 days or more in the last month), and past-month days\nof use. All four measures show an increasing trend, but the growth\nin usage (proxied by past-month use-days) outstrips the growth in\nconsumers because of the increase in daily/near-daily use. That is,\nconsumption grew primarily because of an increase in the average\nfrequency of use, not just because of an increase in the overall\nnumber of users.\nTable 2 | Past-year use, number of drug-related arrests, and number of\nmonthly purchases by education level and racial-ethnic group, 2011\nProportion of\npast-year\nusers (%)\nProportion of\nthose arrested\nfor drug\noffenses (%)\nProportion\nof buys\n(%)\nProportion who are daily/near-daily users\nWe calculated the total number of past-month use-days for each\nfrequency of use categories: those who used 1\u00ad3 days, those\nused 21 days or more in the last month (daily/near-daily users).\nFigure 3 shows the growth in the total number of users and total\nnumber of use-days for all four groups. Although daily/near-\ndaily users represented less than one-quarter of past-month\ncannabis users in 2002 and roughly one-third of past-month\nusers in 2011, they account for the vast majority of use-days\nand are thus are presumably responsible for the majority of\nconsumption.\nTo understand more about the daily/near-daily users who are\ndriving the increase in consumption, we explored their demo-\ngraphic characteristics over this 10-year time period. Examining\nthe age distribution of the daily/near-daily users shows that youth's\nshare of consumption plummeted by almost 50%, and more\ngenerally consumption shifted to older adults (see Figure 4). In\nin 2011, that had dwindled to 7%. The proportion of daily/near-\ndaily users attributable to young adults (ages 18\u00ad21 years) also\naged 22 years and older increased from 62 to 73%. In other words,\nthe age distribution of daily/near-daily users shifted so that the\naverage age of daily/near-daily users is higher in 2011 than it was\nThere was a notable inversion of the ratio of youth (ages 12\u00ad\nthan three times as many youth as older adults using cannabis on\na daily/near-daily basis; in 2011 there were 2.5 times more older\nadults than youth using on a daily/near-daily basis.\nWe found a similar shift in the age distribution of daily/near-\ndailyusersof alcoholandcigarettes;however,itwasnotasdramatic\nand we did not see the same inversion that was observed for\ncannabis use (see Table 3).

However, the increase\nin the proportion of older daily/near-daily users of cannabis was\nmuch greater than the increase in the proportion of older individ-\nuals in the population, suggesting an increase in heavy cannabis\nuse among older individuals.\nWe also examined the distribution of race/ethnicity and\nfound an increase in the proportion of Hispanic daily/near-daily\nproportion of the population identifying as Hispanic increased\nover this time period (16, 17), the relative increase in the popu-\nlation was not as large as the relative increase in daily/near-daily\ncannabis users.

We explored\nchanges in the past-month use-days since 2002 and found that\nconsumption among adults over 50 grew sharply over the past\n10 years while past-month use-days among those less than 18 years\nof age remained relatively stable (see Figure 5 \u00ad note that base rates\nfor older users in 2002 are relatively low).\nin the number of cannabis use-days, particularly after 2008.\nHispanics and other races had the largest relative increases (130\nand 105%, respectively); however, despite the relatively slower\ngrowth, non-Hispanic white users continue to be responsible for\nthe majority of use-days (see Table 4).\nAn exploration of use-days by education level shows less dra-\nmatic change than the change in age distribution (see Table 4).\nThere was growth in the number of use-days among all adults\nregardless of education level; overall, use-days among adults\nincreased by 49% over this time period. However, the largest\nrelative increase was among those with a college degree, whose\nThe shift in the distribution of use-days and daily/near-daily\nusers from a younger to an older population is noteworthy. For\ncomparison, we display the age distribution of alcohol, cigarettes,\nand cocaine use-days to determine whether a similar shift occurred\nwith other substances (see Figure 6). Adults over the age of 30\nwere already responsible for the majority of alcohol, cigarettes,\nand cocaine use-days in 2002; however, there was a similar shift in\nthe percent of cocaine, cigarette, and alcohol use-days attributable\nto those older than 50 and away from those 21 and under.\nAlthough use-days provide more information about consumption\nthan does prevalence alone, weighting respondents by days of use\nmay still understate the skew in the distribution of use. This is due\nto an apparent positive correlation between intensity of use (grams\nconsumed per day) and the frequency of use (days of consumption\nper month). Zeisser et al. (7), for example, observe a positive cor-\nrelation between the reported number of joints consumed per day\nand self-reported days of use per month. Their data suggest that\nthose using on 30 days per month consumed about three times as\nmany joints per day as did those using only 1\u00ad4 days per month.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | Addictive Disorders and Behavioral Dyscontrol November 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 138 | 6\nBurns et al. Statistics on cannabis users\nFIGURE 5 | Past-month use-days among older adults (50 and over) increased dramatically over this 10-year time period while use-days among youth\n(12\u00ad17) remained fairly stable. Note: because NSDUH did not collect data about blunts in 2002 and 2003, use-days may be underestimated for these years.\nTable 4 | Cannabis past-month use-days (millions) by demographic\ngroups over time.\nUse-days (millions)\nmay be underestimated for these years. We have included data from 2004 when\nthe questions about blunts were introduced for reference.\nZeisser and colleagues' analysis does not consider the possibil-\nity that joint or unit size might also be positively correlated with\nfrequency of use, but the EUMII web-survey (4) described above\ndid gather information about quantity consumed per use-day (in\ngrams) by using picture cards. The EUMII data suggest that when\ndenominating by quantity (weight) consumed instead of number\nof units, that ratio may be closer to 4:1 (see Figure 7).\nThis relationship has important implications for what one\nmight term \"equivalence ratios.\" Naturally it takes multiple light\nusers to consume as much as one heavy user, but how many? That\ndepends on the measure of use. In particular, since it appears that\nthose who use frequently also consume more per day of use, the\nratios are considerably higher when the equivalence is one in terms\nof units or grams used rather than days of use.\nIf one focuses on days of use, it would take about 10\u00ad12 people\nusing 1\u00ad5 times per month to match one daily user, but it would\ntake more than three times that many (>40) to match a single\ndaily user in terms of grams consumed per month. Figure 8 shows\nthese equivalence ratios for each of the categories of users, and\nwith equivalence expressed in terms of both days of use (striped\nbars) and grams per month (solid bars).\nConsider what this means for daily users' share of the market.\nThe one-in-five past-month users who consume daily account for\nalmost 60% of consumption, while the one-third of past-month\nusers who consume less than four times per month account for\njust 2% of consumption.\nDISCUSSION\nThe best metric for studying cannabis clearly depends on the\nobjective of the research. For those interested in the prevalence\nof cannabis use, the number of users is likely sufficient. How-\never, to obtain a more accurate portrayal of cannabis use and\nusers' behavior or to better understand the market, one should\nlook to frequency and amount of consumption. Likewise, those\ninterested in drug-related criminal justice outcomes should focus\non behavior that increases risk of arrest, such as the number of\ndrug purchases and location of these purchases (e.g., indoor vs.\noutdoor).\nExamining frequency of use over time provides a picture of not\nonly changes in who is using but also how individuals are using.\nBeginning in 2007, there were increases not only in the number of\nBurns et al.

Are these older users using for medicinal\nor recreational purposes? Are these trends reflected in arrest or\ntreatment datasets? Are users replacing cannabis use with use of\nanother substance?Why did use-days among Hispanics increase so\ndramatically over this time period relative to other racial-ethnic\ngroups? Does the increase in use-days among college-educated\nindividuals indicate greater social acceptability or something else?\nZeisser et al. (7) and the EUMII web-survey (4) indicate that\nin Europe amount consumed per day is positively correlated with\nfrequency of use,and thus,heavy users are responsible for a greater\nshare of consumption than of days of use. A logical next question\nmight be whether that pattern holds also for U.S. cannabis users\nand whether that means the average amount consumed per past-\nmonth user has increased along with frequency of consumption,\nat least in potency-adjusted terms. Preliminary analyses of data\nfrom Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) suggest there was\nnot a statistically significant change in the average size of a joint\nover the 2000s (Kilmer et al., in preparation), but this is not a\nsettled question. Further, future analyses must also account for\nthe fact that cannabis is consumed in a variety of ways other than\nsmoking joints (e.g., pipes, vaporizers, edibles) and that there may\nbe substantial variation in potency as well.\nIn summary, by sampling on use-days and amount used, we\nfind that most of the consumption and, hence, most of the asso-\nciated intoxication and flow of money into the black markets,\ncomes from people who use frequently. Examining the num-\nber of users can be enlightening but does not fully capture the\ndynamics of cannabis usage. In order to understand market-\nrelated quantities like demand, and to better assess implications\nfor crime, health, and productivity, researchers should analyze\ncannabis usage indicators like use-days and quantity consumed.\n"
