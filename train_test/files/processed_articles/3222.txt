Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to develop a robust \"tool\" that sufficiently approxi-\nmates the value-at-risk of loan portfolios which are concentrated in certain sectors.\nIn a portfolio of credit\u00adrisky exposures, such as bank loans, sector concentration risk\narises if the portfolio is unbalanced in exposures to certain sectors, which entails de-\npendencies between default events. In the following the focus is on industry sectors,\nhowever, sectors can also be defined geographically, in which case the methodology\nstill applies.\nThe importance of concentration risk in loan portfolios has become evident in past\nbanking failures. Banks specializing in loans to economically weak industry sectors\nor less developed regions have sustained significant losses. A well\u00adknown example is\nthe failure of the German Schmidt Bank in 2001. This bank was heavily concentrated\nin a less\u00addeveloped region, which was close to the former East German border and\ncharacterized by a fragile and concentrated industry structure. Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision (2004) lists examples from other countries which highlight the\nimportance of prudently managing concentration risk.\nThe relevance of sector concentration risk is also recognized by financial supervisors,\nalthough existing supervisory rules usually only govern single-name concentration,\nfor example, large exposure rules.1 Supervisory concerns are revealed, for exam-\nple, by the statement of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that \"risk\nconcentrations are arguably the single most important cause of major problems in\nIn the following it is assumed that default dependencies are sufficiently well described\nby (linear) default correlations. For a portfolio with given default probabilities and\na given exposure distribution across names, sector concentration can be defined as\nan interim state between two extremes \"perfect sector concentration\" and \"perfect\nsector diversification\". Perfect sector concentration would be the (undesirable) case\nin which, ceteris paribus no change in the sector allocation of at least one exposure\nwould increase the value-at-risk (VaR) of this portfolio. Conversely, perfect sector\ndiversification would be achieved with a portfolio in which no change in the sector\nallocation of an individual exposure would decrease the VaR.\n1See Council of the European Union (2005) for EU banks.\n2See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2005).\nSector concentration needs to be distinguished from \"single-name concentration\" or\ngranularity which is caused by an unbalanced distribution across single borrowers.\nSingle-name concentration has been comprehensively discussed in the literature on\ngranularity adjustments in a single risk factor model, closely linked to the develop-\nment of the New Basel Accord.3 This paper focuses, however, solely on sector con-\ncentration. For this purpose I further differentiate between intra\u00adsector correlation\nand inter\u00adsector correlation. Intuitively, intra\u00adsector correlation should generally\nbe the higher of the two correlations if the definition of sectors is meaningful. De-\npending on the model, a distinction also needs to be made between asset correlation,\nwhich is the correlation of the unobservable, normalized asset returns, and default\ncorrelation, which refers to the correlation of the default events of two borrowers.\nDepending on the model applied, both correlation definitions will be necessary.\nA key motivation for analyzing a new approach is the recognition that the\"binomial\nexpansion technique\" (BET) developed by Moody's does not provide sufficiently ac-\ncurate estimates of the VaR. This is shown in Section 2 using numerical examples\nof VaR calculations for realistic levels of default correlations. This paper explores\nhow the deficiencies of the BET approach can be remedied by extending the model\nto incorporate infectious defaults as inspired by Davis und Lo (2001). This model\ncondenses loss dependencies, which are usually modelled by sector correlations, into\nan infection probability. The new model imposes rather parsimonious data require-\nments, which are comparable to those for the BET model and considerably lower\nthan for a multi\u00adfactor model. Therefore, the new model is not only transparent\nbut also tractable, in terms of both the required computational effort and the data\nrequirements.\nIn spite of its relatively simple structure, the infection model presented in this paper\nmay provide a good VaR approximation since it is calibrated exactly to the tail\nof the loss distribution in the multi\u00adfactor model. This approach is expected to\ndeliver better results than a moment\u00admatching methodology, which is also used,\nfor example, in the BET model, and which can easily fail to capture the true tail\nbehavior.\nTo verify its accuracy, I compare the VaR in the new infection model to the VaR\n3The Second Consultative Paper on Basel II, published in January 2001, contained a (later\nabandoned) proposal for a \"granularity adjustment\" of the risk-weight functions of the internal\nratings based (IRB) approach. See Gordy (2004) for an overview of recent academic work on this\nsubject.\ncalculated in a multi\u00adfactor model setting, in which various sectors constitute the\nsystematic factors for a set of test portfolios. These test portfolios comprise expo-\nsure distributions across sectors which reflect the aggregate sector distribution of\ncorporate lending in the German banking system as well as sector distributions of\nexisting banks with more concentrated portfolios. Furthermore, the portfolios differ\nin terms of default probabilities and asset correlations. The purpose of comparing\nthese two models is to determine, how much accuracy is lost by applying the infec-\ntion model and whether it still provides a reasonably accurate, but technically much\nmore easily computable, VaR.\nThe idea of calibrating a model with a simple structure and closed-form solution to\nthe VaR is also pursued in recent work by Cespedes et al. (2005). However, their\napproach comprises a single\u00adfactor model with a scaling factor which is calibrated to\ncapture diversification across sectors. The scaling factor is defined as a function of a\nHerfindahl\u00adHirschman index4, based on the economic capital required in each sector\nby a single\u00adfactor model. It does not capture individual estimates of intra\u00adsector\nand inter\u00adsector correlations which feed into the infection model. Furthermore, the\ninfection model differentiates between the contribution of the level of the probability\nof default (PD) and the impact of the asset correlations on the VaR. The Pykhtin\n(2004) approach retains the multi\u00adfactor model but provides a closed-form solution\nfor the VaR which is based on a methodology previously employed by Wilde (2001)\nfor a VaR adjustment which accounts for single-name concentration. Pykhtin's\nclosed-form solution, however, is more complex than the proposal in this paper\nand does not reduce the data requirements compared with a multi\u00adfactor model.\nInstead of reducing the complexity of a multi\u00adfactor model, Witt (2004) comes from\nthe opposite direction and extends Moody's BET model to form the \"correlated\nbinomial approach\". However, his proposal requires estimates of default correlations\nas inputs which are difficult to obtain in the real world.\nIf the infection model presented in this paper proves to be sufficiently accurate, it\ncould be used as a fit\u00adfor\u00adpurpose tool for risk managers in banks or for banking\nsupervisors. Risk managers may also find it useful as a benchmark for the results of\nmore sophisticated internal models.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the concept of the BET model\nand shows the limitations of its accuracy in calculating VaR if default events are\ncorrelated. The infection model is introduced and calibrated in Section 3. The\nkey parameter in the calibration procedure is the degree of default infection, which\nis determined by minimizing the squared error in the VaR calculation over a wide\nrange of realistic input parameter values.\nIn Section 4, the model performance is evaluated by applying the calibrated infec-\ntion model to a range of test portfolios. The purpose of these tests is to verify if\nthe calibrated model provides a valid VaR approximation over the entire relevant\nparameter space. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.\n2. Binomial Expansion Methodology\nAn important area where default correlation needs to be measured is the assessment\nof credit risk in securitization structures such as CDOs and CLOs. Therefore, it\nis not surprising that external rating agencies were among the first to develop a\nsuitable methodology for that purpose. The BET model developed by Moody's was\none of the first approaches and emerged as a market standard, not least because its\nunderlying principles are very transparent.5\nThe key idea of the BET model is to map the real portfolio into a hypothetical\nhomogenous portfolio that consists of loans sharing the same probability of default\n(PD) and the same exposure volume and in which default events of all exposures\nare pairwise independent. The number of defaults in this hypothetical portfolio is\nbinomially distributed so that the VaR can easily be determined. The calculation\nof the VaR requires only two input parameters: the PD and the modified diversity\nscore, which is defined as the number of exposures in the hypothetical portfolio. The\nmapping between the two portfolios is defined by matching the first two moments\nof the portfolio loss distribution.\nLet Ai,k\ndenote exposure k in sector i of the real portfolio, m the number of sectors,\nn(i) the number of exposures in sector i, and D the modified diversity score. For ease\nof presentation it is assumed that every exposure belongs to a different borrower,\neliminating the need to differentiate between exposures and borrowers. Let A refer\nto the total exposure, which is the same for both portfolios:\nA =\nm\nn(i)\nAi,j\nThe uniform exposure size in the hypothetical portfolio is given by A/D. It is\nassumed that exposures in the same sector share the same PD. The average PD of\nthe exposures in the hypothetical portfolio, \u00af\np, is calculated by setting the mean loss\nof the real portfolio equal to the mean loss of the hypothetical portfolio, where LGD\ndenotes the loss given default:\nm\nn(i)\npi\n\u00b7 Ai,j\n\u00b7 LGD = D \u00b7 \u00af\np \u00b7\nA\nD\n\u00b7 LGD. (2)\nFrom (2) it follows that \u00af\np equals the weighted average PD of the real portfolio:\n\u00af\np =\nm\npi\n\u00b7 n(i)\nAi,j\nA\nLet Ui,j\ndenote the indicator function that signals a default of exposure j in sector\ni in the original portfolio and Uk\na default of the k-th exposure in the hypothetical\nportfolio. Matching the variances of losses in the real and the hypothetical portfolio\nprovides an explicit expression for the modified diversity score:\nV ar\n\n\nm\nn(i)\nAi,j\n\u00b7 LGD \u00b7 Ui,j\n\n = V ar\nA\nD\n\u00b7 LGD \u00b7\nD\nUk\nNote that the value of the LGD parameter does not affect the result of the moment\nmatching because this parameter cancels out in (4) and (2).\nIt is assumed that the pairwise default correlation i,k\nj,l\nof two exposures k and l in\nsectors i and j is the same within each sector (intra\ni\n, intra\nj\n) and between any two\nsectors (inter):\nFor i  {1, ..., m} : i,k\nj,l\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n1 : i = j and k = l\nintra\ni\n: i = j and k = l\ninter : i = j.\nLet pi\ndenote the default probability, which is the same for all borrowers in sector\ni. Then, from (4) it follows for the modified diversity score D that\nD =\np)\nm\nm\nn(i)\nn(j)\nAi,k\nAj,l\ni,k\nj,l\npi\n) pj\n)\nSince the number of defaults in the hypothetical portfolio is binomially distributed,\ncalculation of the VaR for a confidence level of 99.9% requires the 99.9% percentile\nof the binomial distribution with parameters D and \u00af\np. Then, the VaR is computed\nby multiplying this percentile by the average exposure size, A/D, and the LGD.\nA\nD\n\u00b7 LGD \u00b7 Bin-1\n(D, \u00af\n2.2. Evaluation of VaR Estimates from the BET Model\nIn the following I evaluate the accuracy of the BET model for a VaR calculation.\nThe \"real\" portfolio that is used as the benchmark comprises 1,000 credit\u00adrisky\nexposures. It is homogeneous in terms of the notional amount (one currency unit),\nthe default probability (2%) and the pairwise asset correlation (either 0.0, 0.1 or\n0.2). The last property implies a single\u00adsector model.\nThe well\u00adknown single risk factor model is used as a benchmark. Default is trig-\ngered if the unobservable, normalized asset value Xk\nof exposure k falls below an\nexogenous default threshold, -1(\u00af\np), where (.)-1 denotes the inverse of the cumu-\nlative standard normal distribution function. The loss distribution is obtained by\nsampling the model equation\nXk\n=\n\n Y + 1 -  k\nin which Y denotes the systematic factor and k\na disturbance term which are both\nindependent and standard\u00adnormally distributed.\nTable 1 compares VaR estimates obtained from Monte Carlo simulation with the\ncorresponding VaR estimates, based on the BET model. The number of exposures\nin the hypothetical portfolio is given by the diversity score and the exposure size by\nthe ratio of the total exposure of the real portfolio divided by the diversity score.\nThe VaR estimate in the BET model is obtained by invoking (7). For an asset\nrounded up to 95. The increasing asset correlation, therefore, has two consequences\nwhich affect the VaR estimate in opposite directions. It reduces the diversity score\nin the denominator of (7) which c. p. increases the VaR estimate. Since the inferred\nnumber of defaults in the hypothetical portfolio decreases with a lower number of\nComparison of VaR estimates from the Binomial Expansion Technique\nwith simulation-based estimates\nThe following table compares VaR estimates from Monte Carlo simulation,\nV aRMC, based on a single risk factor model with VaR estimates from applying\nthe BET model, V aRBET .

The net effect, however, is always an increase\nin the VaR estimate.\nIn the special case of uncorrelated default events, the BET model provides the correct\nVaR of 35, as expected. If the asset correlation is increased to 0.1 and afterwards\nto 0.2, the VaR estimate obtained from the BET model also increases. However, it\nsubstantially underestimates the true VaR in both cases. For an asset correlation of\n0.1, the VaR estimate from the BET model is 27% below its true value, and for an\nasset correlation of 0.1, the shortfall increases to 35%. These results suggest that\nthe BET model does not provide a sufficiently accurate estimate to recommend its\napplication as a measure for sector\u00adconcentration risk. However, they say nothing\nabout how well the BET model performs in capturing granularity in the VaR.\n3. The Infection Model\nThe key idea of the new model is to extend the BET model by introducing a new\ntype of default dependency into the hypothetical portfolio. This initially appears\nto be counter\u00adintuitive because the hypothetical model was constructed precisely in\norder to be tractable through the assumption that default events are independent.\nHowever, instead of mapping the real portfolio into a portfolio with independent ex-\nposures, it is mapped into a portfolio with default dependencies which are judiciously\nconstructed in order to obtain an easy-to-calculate solution for the VaR.\nThe number of exposures in the hypothetical portfolio is given by the diversity score\nD, as in the BET model. Let Z1\n, ..., ZD\ndenote indicator variables signaling that an\nexposure in the hypothetical portfolio has defaulted.\nFollowing the approach by Davis und Lo (2001), it is assumed that any asset in\nthe hypothetical portfolio can either \"autonomously\" default or default because\nit is \"infected\" by the default of another asset. Let Uautonom\nj\nand Uinfected\nj,k\nde-\nnote indicator functions which equal 1 if an \"autonomous\" default of exposure j\noccurs or if exposure j is \"infected\" by exposure k. Uautonom\nj\nand Uinfected\nj,k\nare\nindependent for j, k  {1, ..., D} and j = k. Let Zj\nbe the indicator function\nthat signals a default of exposure j, either because it has \"autonomously\" de-\nfaulted or because it has been infected by the default of another exposure. Let\npj\n= P Uautonom\nj\n= 1 denote the autonomous default probability in the hypotheti-\ncal portfolio and qj,k\n= P Uinfected\nj,k\n= 1 the probability that an infection can take\nplace, in this case triggered by a default of exposure k. The default indicator Zj\nis\ndefined as follows:\nZj\n= Uautonom\nj\n+ (1 - Uautonom\nj\nk,k=j\n1 - Uautonom\nk\n\u00b7 Uinfected\nj,k\nIt is assumed that all exposures in the hypothetical portfolio share the same au-\ntonomous default probability and the same infection probability. The autonomous\ndefault probability is determined as the exposure\u00adweighted average of the default\nprobabilities in the real portfolio. Therefore, pj\n= \u00af\np and qj\n= q for j  {1, ..., D}.\nThe probability of  defaults in the hypothetical portfolio is then given by6\nf(; D, \u00af\np, q) =\nD\n\n\u00af\np)D- (1 - q) (D-)+\n\ni\n\u00af\np)D-i(1 - (1 - q)i)-i (1 - q)i (D-) .\nTherefore, the loss distribution FIM for up to N defaults, 0  N  D,7\nFIM\nL \u00b7 D\n= P(L \nN \u00b7 A \u00b7 LGD\nD\n) =\nN\nf(; D, \u00af\ndepends on five parameters: the loss given default, LGD, the total exposure A, the\ndiversity score D, the \"autonomous\" default probability \u00af\np, and the probability of\ninfection q. Since LGD enters the loss distribution as a linear factor in the same\nway as it enters the VaR in the BET model (see (7)), its value does not change the\noutcome of a comparison between the two models. Therefore, LGD is set equal to\nDavis und Lo (2001) regard the estimation of q as the \"main outstanding problem\".\nI do not attempt to estimate this parameter but instead to \"calibrate\" it such that\nit delivers roughly the same VaR as a multi\u00adfactor model.\nSince EL is generally easier to measure than higher moments or extreme quantiles\nof the loss distribution, it seems natural to calibrate EL in the infection model such\nthat it matches EL in the original portfolio. In the BET framework, the EL of the\nhypothetical portfolio corresponds with the EL of the real portfolio.\nD\nLGD \u00b7 j \u00b7\nA\nD\n\u00b7\nD\nj\n\u00af\np)(D-j) = A \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 \u00af\nIn the infection model the EL is given by8\nELIM = LGD \u00b7 A \u00b7 1 - (1 - \u00af\nAs long as the autonomous default probability in the infection model is defined\nby the average default probability \u00af\np in the real portfolio, the EL generally differs\n7[x] denotes the rounding function which rounds x down to the nearest natural number.\nbetween both portfolios. The EL coincides only in the special case in which q equals\nzero. In this trivial case, the infection model collapses to the binomial model.\nIn order to match EL for the infection model for positive values of q, it would be\nnecessary to adjust \u00af\np depending on the parameter q. However, in the calibration\nmethodology q is not known ex ante but is the parameter which is determined at\nthe very end in order to achieve a match in the VaR of the multi-factor model and\nthe infection model. In principle it is possible to determine q and \u00af\np simultaneously\nby requiring that the VaR and the EL both be matched. However, due to numerical\nproblems I did not pursue this approach further. Instead, I focus on matching only\nthe VaR and accept a discrepancy in the EL.\n3.2. Calibration of the Infection Model\nThe analysis of the BET model is carried out in two steps. The first step comprises\na linear regression in order to calibrate the infection parameter q, based on fictive\nexposure distributions across sectors. This step is described in the following section.\nThe second step, described in Section 4, comprises an evaluation of the accuracy of\nthe calibrated model for portfolios with empirically observed exposure distributions\nacross sectors.\nFor a given portfolio and a parameter set of PDs and asset correlations, an optimal\nvalue q can, in principle, be obtained by equating the VaR in the multi\u00adfactor model\nwith the VaR in the infection model and solving numerically for q. The solution q,\nthus obtained, achieves a match in the adverse 99.9% quantile of the loss distribution\nof both models. Since q depends on the portfolio characteristics, particularly the\nexposure distribution across sectors and asset correlations, it is not possible to find a\nunique q for all portfolios. However, intuition suggests that q depends on a limited\nnumber of factors which sufficiently capture portfolio characteristics, such as the\ndistribution of exposures across sectors, correlation of default events, and default\nprobabilities. Therefore, in the following I apply a linear model to determine a proxy\nof q for every portfolio, dependent on three systematic factors. This regression\nmodel is given by\nln(HHI) + 2\nln(\u00af\nln(\u00af\nintra) + 4\nln(\u00af\nHHI denotes the Hirschman-Herfindahl index, calculated as the sum of squared\nrelative exposure shares of the sectors in the portfolio. \u00af\nintra is the weighted\u00ad\naverage intra\u00adsector asset correlation of all exposures, weighted by the total exposure\namounts to the individual sectors, \u00af\ninter the average inter\u00adsector asset correlation,\nand the idiosyncratic disturbance term. Note that here I use asset correlations as\nexplanatory variables instead of default correlations, which are necessary to calcu-\nlate the diversity score.

The optimization is carried out by\na linear regression based on (13), in which q is replaced by the \"optimal\" q which\nequates the VaR in both models for the respective parameter set.\nIn the special case of zero inter\u00adsector correlation, the regression function has a\njump discontinuity. Therefore, I estimate the model separately under the restriction\nThe benchmark or \"true\" model is a multi\u00adfactor model in which the factors are\ndefined by business sectors.

These\nfine-grained portfolios ensure that the impact of sector concentration is not limited\nby the granularity of the portfolios. In order to get meaningful results from the\ncalibration exercise, I focus on a subset of the parameter space which captures the\nrelevant range of typical values for HHI, \u00af\nintra, \u00af\ninter, and \u00af\np.\nIn terms of sector concentration I explore four portfolios with sectors of different\nsizes. I start with the relatively concentrated portfolio 1 that comprises only three\nsectors which have a relative share of 50%, 30%, and 20% of the total exposure. I\nproceed to portfolios 2, 3, and 4 using the following algorithm. The sector size in\nevery new portfolio is determined by splitting every sector share of the old portfolio\ninto two sectors which contain one-third and two-thirds respectively. The resulting\ncomposition of the portfolios is presented in Table 8 in the Appendix. The maximum\nof 24 sectors in portfolio 4 is inspired by the two\u00addigit GICS classification scheme\nof CreditMetrics which is based on 24 industry groups.\nOther vendor models, such as Moody's KMV, employ an even greater number of\nsectors. However, increasing the number of sectors by adjusting the sector defini-\ntion without changing the portfolio will decrease concentration in individual sectors\nand increase correlation across sectors. Broadly speaking sector concentration risk\nwould be transformed into overall correlation risk. Since the focus is here on sector\nconcentration risk, higher numbers of factors are not considered. Another motiva-\ntion for not considering more factors is the fact that fit\u00adfor\u00adpurpose tools such as\nthe infection model could be most valuable for regionally focused and medium\u00adsize\nbanks because such tools impose relatively parsimonious data requirements with a\nlimited number of sectors.\nFor the calibration exercise, uniform intra\u00adsector correlations \u00af\nintra for all sectors\nand also uniform inter\u00adsector correlations \u00af\ninter are assumed. This specification is\nmotivated by balancing parsimony and accuracy but also by a requirement of the\ninfection model which needs correlation values on a sector\u00adby\u00adsector basis for the\ncalculation of the diversity score. In cases where this information is not available\nto banks, supervisors may consider providing a rough estimate of an average asset\ncorrelation based on their own experience. This value could also be used for the\ncalculation of the diversity score, thereby further reducing data requirements.\nDefining a realistic range of typical asset correlations for the calibration exercise\nis not straightforward. The results of numerous empirical studies which have been\ncarried out in recent years are quite diverse.9 It seems fair to summarize that a\ngenerally accepted industry consensus about the range of asset correlations has not\nemerged so far. However, the relatively broad range (between 0.05 and 0.4) appears\nto cover all relevant values. The 15 pairs of asset correlations \u00af\nintra and \u00af\ninter which\nare used for the calibration are listed in Table 2.10\nCorrelation parameters for model calibration\nThe following table lists the intra\u00adsector asset correlations and the correspond-\ning inter\u00adsector correlations used to calibrate the infection probability.\nRealistic PD values were taken from historical default rates observed for common\nintuition tells us that corporate loans have, on average, lower PDs than retail ex-\nposures and also that systematic risk decreases with the default probability, PDs of\nup to 5% are considered to be most relevant for the analysis.\nWith 4 different sector distributions, 6 PDs and 15 pairs of intra\u00adsector and inter\u00ad\n9See, for example, Lopez (2002) as an example of relatively high estimates of asset correlations\nand Roesch (2003) who estimates relatively low values.\n10In the special case of zero inter\u00adsector correlation (4 = 0), I also consider values of 0.02 and\n0.5 for the intra\u00adsector asset correlation.\nsector asset correlations, a total of 360 parameter sets are considered. For every\nparameter set the VaR is determined in the multi\u00adfactor model by simulation. Af-\nterwards the optimal q is computed which generates roughly the same VaR in the\ninfection model. The linear regressions are carried out using the q values as \"ob-\nservations\" of the dependent variable. The estimates of the regression coefficients\nin (13) are summarized in Table 3 for the two cases with and without\ninter\u00adsector correlation. The regression coefficients are highly significant with one\nRegression results\nThe following table presents the results of regressing the natural logarithm\nof the \"optimal\" infection parameter q on the Hirschman-Herfindahl index\n(HHI), the average asset correlations (\u00af\nintra and \u00af\ninter), and the default prob-\nability \u00af\np. \"***\" signals significance at the 99% confidence level.\nRegressor Intercept HHI \u00af\np \u00af\nintra \u00af\ninter\na) Zero inter\u00adsector correlation\nb) With inter\u00adsector correlation\nexception. Since the coefficient of the intercept is insignificant in the case of zero\ninter\u00adsector correlation, this regression model is also estimated without intercept\nwith only marginal changes in the other coefficient estimates. The signs of the esti-\nmated coefficients are as expected in all cases. The infection probability increases, as\nexpected, with sector concentration, measured by HHI, with the default probability\n\u00af\np, and also with the asset correlations \u00af\nintra and \u00af\ninter.\nThe adjusted R2 of the regression estimation is 96% without inter\u00adsector correlation\nand 95% with inter\u00adsector correlation. These results indicate that the explanatory\npower of the regression models is sufficient to keep the calibration error from unex-\nplained noise in the residuals within reasonable bounds.\n4. Evaluation of the Infection Model\nWhen evaluating the model, the calibrated model is applied to various test portfolios\nin order to measure the accuracy of the VaR. For the test portfolios in the analyses\nthe distribution of exposures across sectors was constructed from credit register data\non real bank portfolios. This test is extremely important because of three different\nsources of error which can distort the results of the calibration when applied to real\nportfolios.\nThe first error component derives from a discrete diversity score and does not de-\npend, therefore, directly on the calibration procedure. The diversity score has to be\nan integer since the loss distribution, defined by (10), is a discrete distribution. This\nerror decreases as the number of exposures increases in the portfolio.\nThe second error component depends on the unexplained variation in the regression\nmodel, defined by (13). In order to reduce this error, various specifications of (13)\nwere tried until an adjusted R2 of 96% seemed satisfactory.\nThe third, and arguably most important, error component derives from the difference\nbetween the parameter set of the real portfolio and the parameter sets used for\ncalibration. A realistic range of parameters was used in order to reduce this effect,\nyet this difference still constitutes a potential source of error, especially with respect\nto the sector concentration, measured by HHI.\nTo evaluate the accuracy of the model calibration, three test portfolios were used\nwith realistic sector distributions. The first test portfolio represents the overall\nbusiness\u00adsector concentration of the German banking system, including branches\nof foreign banks, on German corporate, non\u00adfinancial borrowers. I consider this\nto be a reasonable approximation of a balanced portfolio. This view is guided by\nthe intuition that banks' portfolios, on average, cannot be more diversified than\nthe average relative sector distribution of the national banking system. However,\na VaR-minimizing portfolio could be better diversified and could yield a different\nand possibly more uniform distribution of exposures across sectors. Portfolio 1\nwas constructed by aggregating large corporate exposures11 from the loan portfolios\nfrom the German central credit register, which collects commercial, industrial, and\n11See sections 13 and 14 of the German Banking Act (\"Kreditwesengesetz\").\nconsumer loans. Since the credit register reports only national industry codes which\nare compatible with the NACE classification scheme, the sector exposures were\nmapped to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). For every sector\nthe total exposure, aggregated over all banks in the sample, was scaled so that the\nsum of all sectors is consistent with the hypothetical total volume of EUR 6,000,000.\nThe calibration accuracy is subsequently measured for two more concentrated test\nportfolios which were constructed to resemble real bank portfolios with respect to\nthe HHI. The sector distribution of all three portfolios is shown in Table 4. With\nHHI ranging from 17.6% for the first portfolio to 61.7% for the last, the portfolios\ncover a relatively broad range of exposure concentrations in sectors.\nSector decomposition of the test portfolios\nThe following table presents the sector decomposition of test portfolios 1\u00ad3\naccording to the GICS classification scheme, together with the Herfindahl-\nHirschman index (HHI), based on the aggregated sector exposures.\nSector Portfolio 1 Portfolio 2 Portfolio 3\nLittle computational work is required to apply the calibrated infection model. The\nVaR is determined as the 99.9% adverse percentile of the loss distribution defined by\n(10). This calculation requires the parameter q which is determined from (13) with\nestimates of the regression coefficients 0\ngiven in Table 3 and the portfolio\u00ad\ndependent parameter values HHI, \u00af\nintra, \u00af\ninter, and \u00af\np.\nWhen analyzing each test portfolio, the parameter HHI is kept constant because\nit is defined by the exposure distribution across sectors which is also constant for\neach test portfolio. In order to increase the representativeness of the results \u00af\np, \u00af\nintra,\nand \u00af\ninter are varied in each test portfolio in the same range as for the calibration.\nFor 3 test portfolios, 6 PDs and 15 pairs of \u00af\nintra and \u00af\nestimates for the multi\u00adfactor model, for the BET model, and for the infection model\nrespectively.\nTable 5 shows descriptive statistics of the VaR for portfolios 1, 2, and 3. The\nrelatively strong increase in the HHI for portfolio 3 compared with portfolios 1 and\n2 is mirrored by a strong increase of 66% and 48% in the VaR.\nDescriptive statistics of the VaR for portfolio 1\u00ad3\nThe following table contains the median, standard deviation, and 75% quantile\nof the VaR over 90 tuples of default probabilities and intra\u00adsector and inter\u00ad\nsector asset correlations. The VaR was determined by MC simulations. All\nnumbers are given in percent.\nTable 6 shows descriptive statistics of the infection probabilities for the three test\nportfolios. For each portfolio the median, standard deviation, and the 75% quantile\nare reported for 90 tuples of default probabilities and intra\u00adsector and inter\u00adsector\nasset correlations. The results are relatively similar for portfolio 1 and 2 but for the\nmore concentrated portfolio 3 the level and the dispersion of the infection probabil-\nities roughly double.\nTable 9 in the Appendix provides an extraction of VaR estimates and VaR errors for\nselected combinations of \u00af\nintra, \u00af\ninter, and \u00af\np for portfolio 1. Column 4 of the table\ncontains the VaR (in percent), obtained from MC simulations, and the percentage\nerrors of the BET model and the infection model relative to the simulation-based\nVaR.\nDescriptive statistics of the calibrated infection probabilities for\nThe following table contains the median, standard deviation, and 75% quantile\nof the infection probabilities over 90 tuples of default probabilities and intra\u00ad\nsector and inter\u00adsector asset correlations. All numbers are given in percent.\nAccording to Table 9, the relative error in the VaR estimate is substantially lower\nfor the infection model than for the BET model. With few exceptions, it is below\n10% and may be regarded as sufficiently small for practical purposes to measure\nthe impact of sector concentration on the VaR with the infection model. The re-\ngions in which the infection model produces the highest relative errors in VaR are\ncharacterized by low PDs in combination with relatively high asset correlations.\nFigure 1 visualizes the percentage error in the VaR for two selected values of \u00af\np,\nnamely 20bp and 2%. The inter\u00adsector correlation is set to zero. Figure 1 shows\nthat in the infection model the relative errors increase with \u00af\nintra only for the lower\npi\n= 0.2% the approximation error exceeds the\n10% boundary; however, this occurs relatively rarely in the 270 considered cases.\nFor the BET model the relative errors are considerably higher and increase with the\nasset correlations, as expected.\nFigure 2 differs from Figure 1 in that the inter\u00adsector correlation is set to 5% instead\nof zero. The results are qualitatively very similar to the case of zero inter\u00adsector\ncorrelation. Again, there is no monotonic relation between the intra\u00adsector corre-\nlation and the accuracy of the infection model. This suggests that the calibration\nof the infection model achieves its purpose of accounting for changes in the asset\ncorrelation. Only for relatively extreme combinations of low PDs and high asset\ncorrelations, not shown in Figure 2, are peaks in the relative VaR errors observed.\nThis is different from the BET model, for which a positive relationship can overall\nbe observed between the asset correlation and the VaR error can be observed.\nFigure 1.

Again, the relative errors of the infection model appear to be relatively robust\nagainst changes in the asset correlation.\nTable 7 summarizes descriptive statistics of the absolute values of the relative VaR\nerrors. Results are presented for both models and for all three test portfolios, calcu-\nlated from 90 tuples of \u00af\nintra, \u00af\nintra, and \u00af\np for each portfolio. The gain in accuracy\nby using the infection model instead of the BET model is considerable and amounts\nto 28.8\u00ad31.8 percentage points for the median errors. For the infection model the\nmedian error and also the other two statistics are considerably higher for portfolio 3\n(which has the highest concentration) than for the other two portfolios. This may\nat least partly be explained by the fact that the most concentrated portfolio is out\u00ad\nof\u00adsample in the sense that the highest HHI for the calibration was 38% compared\nwith a considerably higher value of 61.7% in portfolio 3. If portfolios with such a\nconcentrated sector distribution are relevant for practical purposes, a re\u00adcalibration\ncan be carried out based on more concentrated portfolios. With one exception,12,\n12For the smallest parameter values, which means for \u00af\ninter = 0 and \u00af\nboth models achieve roughly the same accuracy.\nAccuracy of value-at-risk estimates for the three test portfolios\nThe following table contains the median, standard deviation, and 75% quantile\nof the absolute VaR approximation errors for test portfolios 1\u00ad3. The approxi-\nmation error is defined as the absolute value of the relative difference between\nthe value\u00adat\u00adrisk (VaR) in the multi\u00adfactor model and the benchmark model\nwhich is either the original BET model or the calibrated infection model. All\nnumbers are given in percent.\nreplacing the BET model by the infection model substantially reduces the error in\nthe VaR. It is up to the practitioner to decide whether the results are sufficiently\naccurate for his purposes given the \"fit\u00adfor\u00adpurpose\" character of the approach.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nResults from portfolio models for credit risk tell us that exposure concentrations\nin certain industry sectors can substantially increase the VaR. The purpose of this\npaper is to analyze a tractable \"infection model\" that permits a meaningful estimate\nof the impact of concentration risk on the VaR. The required input parameters \u00ad\nthe sector\u00adbased Herfindahl\u00adHirschman index, the average (intra\u00adsector and inter\u00ad\nsector) asset correlations, weighted by total sector exposures, and the average default\nprobability in each sector \u00ad can be calculated from the data which are already\nrequired to calculate a diversity score for the BET model. Therefore, the new\nmodel imposes no additional data requirements compared with the BET model and\nconsiderably fewer than a multi\u00adfactor model.\nThe infection model extends the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) developed by\nMoody's for the valuation of CDOs. The key idea is to introduce default infection for\nthe hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is mapped in order to obtain\na simple solution for the VaR. The infection probability is calibrated for a range\nof typical values of the input parameters to the VaR obtained from a multi\u00adfactor\nmodel.\nThe accuracy of the new model and its calibration are measured for three test port-\nfolios. The exposure distributions across sectors of these portfolios are defined based\non information from the German public credit register. The first portfolio reflects the\naverage sector distribution of the German banking system whereas the second and\nthird portfolios are more concentrated and resemble those of real banks. The tests\nalso consider a broad range of realistic values of default probabilities and intra\u00adsector\nas well as inter\u00adsector asset correlations. I find that a carefully calibrated model ap-\nproximates the VaR obtained from a multi\u00adfactor model reasonably closely. The\nhighest errors are observed for combinations of very low default probabilities and\nhigh asset correlations. With a reduction of roughly 30 percentage points in the\nmedian of the relative VaR approximation errors, the infection model out\u00adperforms\nby far the BET approach, which is dismissed for its lack of accuracy.\nFuture work will comprise further robustness checks, with attention given to the\nheterogeneity of intra\u00adsector correlations and PDs. A comparison of the specific\nshape of the loss distribution implied by the infection model with alternatives is also\nwarranted. The loss distribution can be replaced by another distribution, for ex-\nample a beta\u00adbinomial distribution, and the additional parameter can be calibrated\nsimilarly to q in the infection model.\nParsimonious data requirements constitute an important, practical advantage of the\ninfection model. Instead of a fully specified correlation matrix, it is sufficient to\nprovide an average intra\u00adsector and an average inter\u00adsector correlation as inputs.\nFrom the evaluation of the calibrated infection model, it can be concluded that the\nmodel offers a fit\u00adfor\u00adpurpose tool to measure concentration risk in business sectors.\nIt could be useful for risk managers in banks as well as banking supervisors, and may\nbe especially suited for application in regionally focused and medium\u00adsized banks\nbecause of its relatively sparse data requirements.\nReferences\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004): Bank Failures in Mature\nEconomies. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs\\_wp13.pdf.\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (2005): International Convergence of\nCapital Measurement and Capital Standards, A Revised Framework. http://\nwww.bis.org/publ/bcbsca.htm.\nCespedes, J.
