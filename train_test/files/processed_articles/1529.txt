The project is\ndesigned to examine the complex relationships between\nthese domains. Undoubtedly, quality of life (QoL) and psy-\nchological health are both an outcome and a correlate of\nthese relationships. Within the literature, QoL is defined\nand operationalized in a number of ways and can easily\nbe confounded with health and social well-being (Gill &\nHere, we will focus on the approach NSHAP used to assess\nQoL and the benefits and drawbacks of these choices.\nFocusing on the relationships between health and social\nintimacy, NSHAP is interdisciplinary in its nature. The\nproject involves a variety of investigators from different\ndisciplines with different interests. With limited time for\nthe in-home interview, the operationalization of QoL and\npsychological health needed to focus on the specific inter-\nests of the investigators while maintaining a brief, yet broad\napproach. Ultimately, they were operationalized through\nmeasures of self-reported emotional health, happiness, self-\nesteem, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and stress. Mea-\nsures of happiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness\nare well established in the literature and, consequently, dis-\ncussed only briefly in this manuscript. Alternatively, we\nwill focus on QoL measures which were modified for their\nuse in this project, including anxiety, stress, and self-reported\nemotional health. We aim to provide evidence for the ade-\nquacy of these measures.\nMethods\nData Collection and Statistical Analysis\nA nationally representative probability sample of commu-\nnity-dwelling individuals aged 57\u00ad85 years was selected from\nhouseholds across the United States screened in 2004.African\nAmericans, Latinos, men, and the oldest-old (75\u00ad84 years at\nthe time of screening) were oversampled. In-home interviews\nwere conducted in English and Spanish by professional inter-\nsample response rate was 75.5% (for extended info, see\nO'Muircheartaigh, Eckman & Smith in this special issue).\nTo decrease respondent burden, minimize in-home inter-\nview time, and maximize content, the interview used a\nmodularized format. During the in-person interview, all re-\nspondents were administered indices of self-reported emo-\ntional health, happiness, and depression. For all respondents,\nthe loneliness items were given in a self-administered paper-\nand-pencil questionnaire which the respondents completed\nafter the interviewer had left and mailed back. Indices of\nself-esteem, anxiety, and stress were modularized. Respon-\ndents were randomly assigned to receive the questions\nQuality of Life and Psychological Health Indicators in the\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project\nSharon Shiovitz-Ezra,1 Sara Leitsch,2 Jessica Graber,2 and Amelia Karraker3\n1Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.\n2National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, Illinois.\n3Department of Sociology, University of Wisconsin at Madison.\nBackground. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) measures seven indicators of quality of\nlife (QoL) and psychological health. The measures used for happiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness are well\nestablished in the literature. Conversely, measures of anxiety, stress, and self-reported emotional health were modified for\ntheir use in this unique project. The purpose of this paper is to provide (a) an overview of NSHAP's QoL assessment and\n(b) evidence for the adequacy of the modified measures.\nMethods. First, we examined the psychometric properties of the modified measures. Second, the established QoL measures\nwere used to examine the concurrent validity of the modified measures. Finally, gender- and age-group differences were\nexamined for each modified measure.\nResults. The anxiety index exhibited good internal reliability and concurrent validity. Consistent with the literature, a\nsingle-factor structure best fit the data. Stress was satisfactory in terms of concurrent validity but with only fair internal\nconsistency. Self-reported emotional health exhibited good concurrent validity and moderate external validity.\nConclusions. The modified indices used in NSHAP tended to exhibit good internal reliability and concurrent validity. These\nmeasures can confidently be used in the exploration of QoL and psychological health in later life and its many correlates.\nKey Words: Later life--Measurement--NSHAP--Psychological health--Quality of life\nin-person or in the leave-behind instrument. Approximately\n33% of respondents received the questions in the self-\nadministered leave-behind instrument, thus affording an\nopportunity to examine the impact of different modalities\non respondent responses to these questions.\nThe statistical analysis for testing the psychometric prop-\nerties of the QoL measures was preformed using Stata 9.0\nand SAS. In order to calculate the internal consistency of\nthe scale measures, we used the Cronbach's alpha coeffi-\ncient. Concurrent validity was performed using Pearson\ncorrelations between the modified QoL measures and the\nestablished measures. Additional calculations, such as prin-\ncipal components analysis (PCA) for structural validity,\nwere performed according to relevancy.\nQuality of Life and Psychological Health Measures\nSeven QoL and psychological health indicators were in-\ncluded in NSHAP. First we will briefly introduce the indica-\ntors already established in the literature. Second, we will\nprovide a detailed description of the modified measures.\nDepression.--Depressive symptomology was assessed\nusing the Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression\n(CES-D) scale (Radloff, 1997). In the United States, the\nCES-D is an effective and well-used measure of depression for\nolder adults (Lawton, Brody, & Saperstein, 1989). NSHAP\nused the shorter 11-item Iowa form of the CES-D scale,\nutilizing the same response categories as in the original\n20-item scale. Factor analysis reveals that the Iowa short\nform captures the same dimensions as the long-form CES-D\nscale while giving up little precision (Kohout, Berkman,\nEvans, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1993). Rather than function-\ning as a diagnostic tool to assess a depressive disorder, the\nCES-D indicates depressive symptomology in this older\npopulation. This is particularly the case with the shortened\ninstrument, which has been used successfully in other stud-\nies of aging, including the Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS) at the University of Michigan. Subjects are asked to\nindicate on a 4-point scale how often in the past week they\nhave felt in accordance with 11 different statements. Responses\nare summed for a total score, higher scores indicating more\ndepressive symptomology. In the NSHAP sample, the stan-\ndardized Cronbach's alpha was .80.\nHappiness.--Respondents were asked a single item: \"If\nyou were to consider your life in general these days, how\nhappy or unhappy would you say you are on the whole--\nextremely happy, very happy, pretty happy, unhappy some-\ntimes, or unhappy usually?\" The question was selected\nbecause of its equivalence to an item from the General\nSocial Survey, which established concurrent validity (Lee &\nRoebuck Bulanda, 2005) and was used in a substantial\nnumber of different researches (Cohen, 2002; Kousha &\nSelf-esteem.--Time constraints did not allow for an in-depth\nassessment of self-esteem. However, Robins, Hendin, and\nTrzensniewski (2001) established strong convergent valid-\nity of a single item taken from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem\nScale with the other self-esteem constructs. The item, \"I\nhave a high self-esteem,\" also behaved similarly with a\nwide range of criterion measures. Respondents indicate\nhow true the statement is for them: not very true, somewhat\nuntrue, neither true nor untrue, somewhat true, or very\ntrue.\nLoneliness.--The three items indicating loneliness--\"I\nlack of companionship,\" \"I feel left out,\" and \"I feel\nisolated\"--as well as the response categories were adopted\nfrom the HRS 2002 loneliness module. These items were\ntaken from the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell,\nPeplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Responses to each question are\nsummed with higher scores indicating greater loneliness.\nInternal reliability as found in the HRS module is 0.72\n(Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004). In our sam-\nple, however, the loneliness scale achieved a higher internal\nconsistency with standardized alpha of 0.81.\nThe next QoL measures--anxiety, stress, and self-reported\nemotional health--were used in a modified way in NSHAP.\nThus, we proceed with introducing their unique way of\nmeasurement followed by evidence of their adequacy.\nAnxiety.--A modified version of the seven-item anxiety\nsubscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\n(HADS-A; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was used to assess\nfeelings of anxiety. Originally designed as a screening\ninstrument for the assessment of psychological distress in\npatients (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), the HADS has been\nused successfully in population-based studies and has estab-\nlished reliability and validity (Mykletun, Stordal, & Dahl,\n2001). Respondents report on feelings of anxious mood,\nthoughts, and restlessness over the past week on a 4-point\nLikert scale from 0 to 3, with higher values indicating higher\nanxiety levels; scores are summed, and a total score for the\nanxiety subscale ranges from 0 to 21. The interviewees are\ninstructed to give their immediate reaction to each question.\nThere are two recent exhaustive reviews summarizing the\npsychometric properties of the original HADS, populations\nstudied, testing characteristics, scale homogeneity, test\u00ad\nretest reliability, and anxiety-case identification properties\n(Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, & Neckelmann, 2002; Herrmann,\n1997). The psychometric properties of the HADS anxiety\nindex compare favorably with other well-known scales, such\nas the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck\nAnxiety Inventory (BAI) (Roemer, 2001). Its internal con-\nsistency in a large general population group reproduces that\nin patient populations and easily meets the Cronbach's\nalpha standard for internal consistency of .60 or greater for\nself-administered items (Caci et al., 2003; Mykletun et al.,\nIn NSHAP, the same seven items of the anxiety subscale\n(HADS-A) were used (see Table 1). In the original HADS\nanxiety items, each question had a different set of response\nchoices. To ease respondent burden and increase consis-\ntency throughout the questionnaire, the response categories\nwere modified to match those of the CES-D. Hence, for\neach item, respondents were asked to indicate how often\nthey felt this way: rarely or none of the time, some of the\ntime, occasionally, or most of the time. Although these\nquestion response categories have not been tested in a pop-\nulation-based sample, their use greatly improved the effi-\nciency of the questionnaire and decreased interview time.\nAs in the original anxiety subscale, the seven items were\nsummed after reverse coding of the single \"positive\" item:\n\"I can sit at ease and feel relaxed.\" Thus, the modified scale\nrange is 7\u00ad28, with higher values indicating higher levels of\nanxiety. Due to the change in response options, we pro-\nceeded with a detailed examination of the modified scale to\ndetermine the acceptability of the instrument as well as its\nreliability and validity.\nAcceptability.--The vast majority of the NSHAP respon-\ndents found the anxiety scale acceptable. The response rate\nfor the seven-item scale was around 93%. This finding is simi-\nlar to that found in the research field among patient and non-\npatient populations (Herrmann, 1997). As described above,\napproximately a third of the respondents received the anxi-\nety items in a leave-behind questionnaire. For the following\ndescription of item response, we omitted from the analyses\nrespondents who did not return the questionnaire at all (17%\nof respondents receiving the items in the leave-behind in-\nstrument). In all, 96.9% of respondents answered all seven\nquestions, and 97.9% answered at least 90% of the ques-\ntions. Only 1.9% of these respondents answered less than\nRespondents who received the anxiety questions in\nthe in-person interview responded to more of the anxiety\nquestions than those respondents who received the anxiety\nquestions in the leave-behind instrument. In all, 98.7% of\nrespondents who received the questions in the in-person\ninterview answered all the questions and 99.5% answered\n90% or more. In contrast, 92.6% of respondents receiving\nthe anxiety questions in the leave-behind instrument\nanswered all the questions, and 93.8% answered at least\n90% of the questions; 5.7% of those respondents using the\nleave-behind instrument answered less than 50% of the\nquestions, compared with only 0.3% of in-person interview\nrespondents. In addition, respondents using the leave-behind\ninstrument reported statistically significant higher levels of\nanxiety than respondents using the in-person interview.\nReliability.--The standardized Cronbach's alpha coeffi-\ncient indicating internal consistency for the HADS-A was\n0.76 for the entire sample (The internal reliability across\nue, albeit moderate, is in the range found in other studies.\nAccording to Bjelland et al. (2002), the reported HADS-A\nleagues argue that \"such a result is not surprising in a non-\nclinical sample where the variances of the item scores are\nclassically low\" (Caci et al., 2003, p. 93). Thus, we feel the\nversion of the HADS-A included in NSHAP to be within an\nacceptable internal consistency range.\nValidity.--Factor structure. Most studies examining the\nfactor structure of the entire HADS scale achieved a two-\nfactor solution (Bjelland et al., 2002), a factor for depres-\nsion and a factor for anxiety. This two-factor structure\nwas substantiated among patients (Moorey et al., 1991)\nas well as in a healthy large sample (Lisspers, Nygren, &\nSoderman, 1997). We used PCA to examine the factor\nstructure of the HADS-A in NSHAP. In light of the factor\nstructure found using the entire scale, we expected to\nachieve a one-factor solution, as we include only the anxi-\nety subscale.\nThe PCA verified the one-factor solution. The seven items\nloaded heavily on one factor that accounted for 42% of the\nvariance. This factor was the only factor with an eigenvalue\nhigher than 1 (eigenvalue = 2.95). In order to test the stabil-\nity of the factor structure achieved, we repeated the analysis\namong different age and gender subsamples (see Table 2).\nAs found in Mykletun et al. (2001), when the two subscales\nof the HADS were tested separately, a single-factor solution\nwas obtained for almost all subsamples. Among males,\nhowever, a two-factor structure was indicated, although all\nthe seven items loaded heavily on the first factor, which ex-\nplained more than 40% of the variance.\nConcurrent validity.--Within NSHAP, feelings of anxi-\nety are conceptually incorporated into the larger concept\nof QoL and psychological health. As mentioned above,\nother indicators of QoL include depression (measured by\nthe CES-D), stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]-4),\nloneliness, self-esteem, emotional health and happiness.\nTable 1. Items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale \u00ad\nAnxiety Index (HADS-A) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)\nItem Number and Text\nHADS-A items\n(1) I feel tense or \"wound up.\"\n(3) I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen.\n(5) Worrying thoughts go through my mind.\n(7) I can sit at ease and feel relaxed. (reverse coded)\n(9) I get a sort of frightened feeling like butterflies in the stomach.\n(11) I feel restless, as if I have to be on the move.\n(13) I get a sudden feeling of panic.\nPSS-4 items\n(2) Unable to control important things in my life\n(6) Felt confident about my ability to handle personal problems (reverse coded)\n(7) Felt that things are going my way (reverse coded)\n(14) Felt difficulties were piling up so high that I could not overcome them\nNote: The original item number is in parentheses.\nConcurrent validity for the HADS-A can be established by\nexamining the correlation between these constructs. As\nseen in Table 3, the correlations are in the expected direc-\ntion, with the strongest association found between depres-\nsion and anxiety (.63, p < .001). Positive associations were\nfound among anxiety, stress, and loneliness. Additionally,\nthree negative correlations were found among the positive\naspects of QoL: good emotional health, high self-esteem,\nand general happiness. As each of these correlations was in\nthe expected direction, concurrent validity for the HADS-A\nwas demonstrated.\nAnxiety across gender and age.--As seen in Table 4, the\nmean HADS-A score was significantly higher among women\ncompared with men. Additionally, the 65\u00ad74 age group was\nless anxious compared with the younger age group (57\u00ad64).\nHowever, we did not find a significant difference between\nthe oldest age group and the youngest in this sample. The\nmean scores suggest a nonlinear relationship between anxi-\nety and age.\nStress.--In NSHAP, perceived stress was assessed using\nthe four-item modification of Cohen's PSS (Cohen, Kamarck,\nitems to assess the degree to which life situations are\nappraised as having been stressful during the past month.\nRespondents indicate how often they have felt or thought in\nthe way indicated by the statement on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale. Responses range from never (0) to very often (4). The\nPSS score is obtained after reversing its seven positive items\nand summing all item scores (total score is 0\u00ad56), with\nhigher scores indicating a higher perceived stress level\nIn the development of the 14-item scale, Cohen et al.\n(1983) also validated a shortened version. The four items\n(see Table 1) with the highest correlations to the 14-item\nscale were selected to comprise the PSS-4. The authors\ndetermined that the PSS-4 was a useful tool for assessing\nperceived stress in research where a shortened measure was\nrequired. For NSHAP, two changes were made in the PSS-4.\nThese changes were primarily to increase consistency across\nthe depression, anxiety, and stress scales. First, the respon-\ndents were asked about feelings during the last week instead\nof the last month (as in the original scale). Second, the\nresponse categories were changed to match those of the\nCES-D (see above). Due to these changes, we explored\nthe acceptability, reliability, and validity of this modified\nmeasure.\nAcceptability.--The response rate for the modified PSS-4\nscale was close to 92%. This finding suggests a good acces-\nsibility of the modified version used in NSHAP. As stated\nabove, approximately one-third of the respondents received\nthe stress items in the leave-behind instrument. When those\nwho did not return the leave-behind instrument were omit-\nted, 96.8% of remaining respondents answered all the stress\nquestions; 98% answered 90% or above. Only 2% answered\n50% or fewer of the questions.\nRespondents who received the stress questions in the in-\nperson interview responded to more questions than those\nrespondents who received the stress questions in the leave-\nbehind instrument. In all, 98.3% of respondents who re-\nceived the questions in the in-person interview answered all\nthe questions and 99.5% answered 90% or more. In con-\ntrast, 93% of respondents receiving the stress questions in\nthe leave-behind instrument answered all the questions and\nTable 2.

NSHAP = National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project; QoL = quality of life.\nthose respondents using the leave-behind instrument an-\nswered less than 50% of the questions, compared with only\n0.5% of in-person interview respondents. In addition, re-\nspondents using the leave-behind instrument reported sta-\ntistically significant higher levels of stress than respondents\nusing the in-person interview.\nReliability.--The literature supports good internal reliability\nHyman, Paliwal, & Sinha, 2007). The PSS-4 demonstrates\nthis literature, the reliability for the PSS-4 in our sample\nwas 0.63. Testing the reliability of the PSS across gender\nand age showed the same tendency, with only one exception\nconcerning the oldest age group (a = 0.55).\nValidity.--Concurrent validity. Stress as well as depres-\nsion, anxiety, and loneliness reflect the negative aspect of\nQoL. Thus, these \"negative\" facets of QoL were assumed\nto be positively correlated. Indeed, The PSS-4 achieved\nstrong positive correlations with anxiety, depression, and\ned a negative correlation between perceived stress and the\npositive aspects of QoL, measured by happiness, high self-\nesteem, and good emotional health. As predicted, the three\npositive indicators have significant negative correlations\nwith the PSS-4 scale (Table 3).\nStress across gender and age.--Similar to the results\nfound for the anxiety scale, the mean score of the PSS-4\nwas significantly higher among women compared with men\n(see Table 4). The second age group (ages 65\u00ad74 years) had\nlower scores compared with their younger counterparts. No\ndifferences were found between the oldest and youngest age\ngroups in the sample. As with anxiety, the mean scores of\nthe PSS-4 suggest a nonlinear relationship between stress\nand age.\nSelf-reported emotional health.--Self-reported physical\nhealth, a widely used single-item indicator of health, has been\nshown to be associated with a wide array of more specific\nhealth measures (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999; Ostbye\net al., 2006), and some scholars argue that self-reported\nhealth is as useful an indicator of health and mortality as\nphysician diagnoses (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999; Maddox &\nself-reported measures are useful because they define health\nas well-being, not just the absence of disease (Ross & Wu,\nWith this in mind, we constructed a self-report emotional\nhealth measure to mirror the structure of the self-reported\nphysical health indicator. NSHAP asked respondents to eval-\nuate their emotional health status, using a modified version of\na question asked in the 1992 HRS. The original wording of\nthe emotional health question asked in HRS was \"What about\nyour emotional health--how good you feel or how stressed,\nanxious, or depressed you feel? Is it excellent, very good,\ngood, fair, or poor?\" whereas in NSHAP respondents were\nasked \"What about your emotional or mental health? Is it\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" This question was\nasked of all respondents. The response categories were coded\nin NSHAP from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Thus, higher scores\nreflect better perceived emotional health.\nConcurrent validity.--As self-reported emotional health\ncontributes to positive QoL, we anticipated that this mea-\nsure would positively correlate with the rest of the positive\nQoL indicators. As seen in Table 3, we found a strong posi-\ntive correlation between emotional health and perceived\nhappiness (.43, p < .001). We also found a significant cor-\nrelation between self-esteem and self-reported emotional\nhealth. We also expected a negative correlation with anxi-\nety, depression, stress, and loneliness. As expected, we\nfound a strong negative correlation between good self-\nreported emotional health and anxiety (-.57, p < .001) and\nExternal validity.--As shown in Table 5, approximately\n65% of respondents reported having very good or better\nemotional health. These results differ somewhat from those\nreported by the HRS in 1994. We suspect this variation is\nthe result of both the time lapse between HRS and NSHAP\ndata collection points as well as differences in question\nwording. While NSHAP asked respondents a general ques-\ntion about their emotional health status, HRS provided ex-\namples of possible emotional conditions. The inclusion of\nemotions that characterize reduced emotional health status\nmay have encouraged respondents to limit the range of\nemotions considered as negative. The NSHAP question,\nwithout the specific clarifiers, should therefore produce a\nless biased self-reported measure.\nTable 4. Means and Standard Errors for Anxiety and Stress by\nGender and Age Groups\nGender\nAge groupsb (years)\nNotes: a Mean and SEs scores are weighted. NSHAP = National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project; HADS-A = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\nanxiety subscale; PSS = Perceived Stress Scale.\nb The first age group is used as a reference category for testing the means\ndifferences.\nEmotional health across gender and age.--We found sig-\nnificant variation between men's and women's self-reported\nemotional health. Specifically, women were more likely to\nreport poorer emotional health; 12% of female respondents\nreported \"fair\" or \"poor\" health, as compared with only 8%\nof males. Similarly, only 22% of women reported \"excel-\nlent\" emotional health versus 30% of male respondents. Re-\nsponse distributions were found to be consistent across our\ntwo youngest age categories, with 66% of respondents in\nboth categories reporting \"excellent\" or \"very good\" emo-\ntional health. However, fewer adults (57%) in the oldest age\ngroup reported such positive feelings (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nSeven indicators of QoL and psychological health were in-\ncluded in the NSHAP. Four of them--anxiety, depression,\nstress, and loneliness--reflect the more negative aspect of\nQoL, whereas the three others--emotional health, happiness,\nandself-esteem--indicateitspositiveside.AlthoughNSHAP's\nframework encompasses established measures for happiness,\nself-esteem, loneliness, and depression, some modifications\nwere made for the anxiety, stress, and emotional health mea-\nsures. Thus, the central aim of this paper was to present the\nchanges that were made in NSHAP and to provide empirical\nevidence for the adequacy of the modified measures.\nThe anxiety, stress, and emotional health indicators were\nmodified for NSHAP to increase efficiency, maintain con-\nsistency in response categories across scales, and decrease\nrespondent burden by decreasing the time it took to admin-\nister the questions. In this article, we established the usabil-\nity of these modified indicators by demonstrating their basic\npsychometric properties. The modified HADS-A was found\nto be a reliable and valid measure in terms of internal con-\nsistency, factor structure, and concurrent validity. Internal\nreliability was established across the sample as well as in\ngender and age subgroups. The one-factor solution for the\nHADS-A found in NSHAP is supported by the literature.\nThe modified anxiety measure achieved satisfactory con-\ncurrent validity as well, with significant correlations to the\nother indicators of QoL.\nThe modified PSS-4 achieved modest internal reliability,\nparticularly with the oldest age group; caution should be\nused when applying the modified scale to the oldest-old. As\nwith the modified HADS-A, the PSS-4 demonstrated strong\nconcurrent validity. Finally, the single-item indicator of\nself-reported emotional health correlated significantly with\nthe other measures of QoL in the expected directions.\nGender- and age-group comparisons were conducted for\nall three modified measures. Consistent with the literature,\na systematic difference between men and women was found\nacross all three indices. Women tend to be more anxious\nand are more likely to report poorer emotional health\nWatkin, Milne, Manela, & Katona, 1997; Schoevers, Beekman,\nDeeg, Jonker, & van Tilburg, 2003). The findings regarding\nage differences, on the other hand, are somewhat more\ncomplex. Findings suggest a nonlinear relationship across\nage groups for anxiety and stress. Another explanation is\nthat the relationship between age, stress, and anxiety is\nconfounded with gender, as the oldest age group likely in-\ncludes proportionally more women who tend to report\nhigher distress levels. The complex relationships between\nage and QoL are certainly an area for further exploration.\nAnother important topic that could benefit further exami-\nnation is the different modes of administration used in\nNSHAP. The findings substantiate differences between the\nin-person and the leave-behind questionnaires in reported\nanxiety and stress levels, with higher levels shown in the\nself-completion mode. A similar trend was found in another\nstudy exploring the SF-36 health status scale (Lyons et al.,\n1999) and emphasizes the need for further research.\nUnfortunately, the inclusion of both the original indices\nand their modified forms in the NSHAP questionnaire was\nimpossible due to time constraints. Consequently, we were\nunable to compare the modified indices with their original\nforms. As a result, a complete exploration of the validity of\nthe modified indices is impossible with these data. None-\ntheless, the modified QoL indicators used in NSHAP\ntended to exhibit good quality in terms of internal reliabil-\nity and concurrent validity. We feel confident that these\nmeasures, as well as the more established indicators of\nhappiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness, can be\nused in studies of QoL and psychological health among\nolder adults.\nTable 5.
