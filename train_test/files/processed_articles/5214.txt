Similar, but much more rigid, social hierarchies occur in the species most closely\nrelated to us: chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (Smuts, 1987). Social hierarchies of\nlarger groups of humans are evident at least from the point at which chiefdoms were\ndeveloped, and have been prevalent in human societies ever since (Boehm, 1999).\nAn individual who maintains a high rank in social hierarchies is referred to as\ndominant. High rank can be the outcome of various determinants; one likely determinant is\nbodily strength, important both to secure resources and prevail in dominance contests. In\nline with other recent arguments and evidence (e.g., Fink, Neave, and Seydel, 2007; Sell,\nTooby, and Cosmides, 2009; Windhager, Schaefer, and Fink, 2011), here we provide\nevidence for the idea that judgments of dominance partly rely on judgments of bodily\nstrength.\nDominance and physical strength\nFacial maturity and dominance\nTheories of interpersonal relations, perception, and judgment have long considered\ndominance as a central trait (Wiggins, 1979). For example, in the interpersonal circumplex\nmodel, the vertical axis of personality is dominance vs. submissiveness, with the second\naxis being cold vs. warm (Wiggins, Phillips, and Trapnell, 1989). When people perceive\nanother individual, that individual is automatically categorized according to sex and age\n(Kurzban, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2001), but they are also judged spontaneously in terms of\npersonality traits. Dominance is one of the two central traits judged from perceiving a\nhuman face. For instance, Oosterhof and Todorov (2008) used a series of principal\ncomponent analyses to identify the dimensions underlying face evaluation. In a bottom-up\napproach, they started with more than 1000 trait inferences from faces, narrowed them\ndown to 15 traits, and collected ratings of these traits, which were then analyzed. They\nfound two dimensions that together accounted for more than 80% of the variance of trait\njudgments from faces. One of the dimensions was dominance, the other trustworthiness.\nThe judgments of the traits dominant, mean, aggressive, and confident were the closest to\nthe axis of the factor, with the trait dominant the most central. These findings led the\nauthors to consider dominance as one of the dimensions of face evaluation.\nFacial dominance correlates with social outcomes. Muller and Mazur (1997) found\nthat West Point cadets with more dominant faces were more likely to attain higher ranks in\ntheir career. The influence of dominance can also be seen in the courtroom, where plaintiffs\nwith more mature looking faces receive higher penalties than baby-face looking ones\n(Zebrowitz and McDonald, 1991). Facial dominance also predicts election outcomes\n(Chiao, Bowman, and Gill, 2008; Little, Burriss, Jones, and Roberts, 2007; Rule et al.,\nDominance and strength\nSocial dominance is determined partly by actual physical strength, which predicts a\nman's rank in the social hierarchy in general (Von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan, 2008).\nThe notion of social dominance is usually characterized as a superior likelihood in\ncompetitive contests of attaining the access to assets. Status is related with our chances of\nsurvival, reproduction, and kin protection (Cummins, 2005). Puts (2010), while discussing\nthe mechanisms of sexual selection, posited that contests between men can be their central\nprocess of sexual selection. According to him, typically male features such as a larger\nbody, more muscularity, and physically strength are related to males' evolutionary history\nof fighting and competition. Thus, individuals with more strength have a higher resource-\nhold potential or formidability (Parker, 1974). It is plausible that formidability contributes\nto status both because of advantages in inter-individual contests for higher ranks and also\nbecause it secures resources in contests with competitors outside of the hierarchy.\nAdditionally, men with a higher ability to inflict costs on others have a higher fertility,\nwhich is related to social status (e.g., Von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan, 2011).\nThis reasoning suggests that mechanisms that evolved to perceive physical strength\nroutinely contribute to the formation of social hierarchies, that is, dominance. Indeed, it\nwould be zoologically unusual if it were not the case (Smuts, 1987). What is the evidence\nfor this assumption? Some insights come from research on the baby face overgeneralization\nDominance and physical strength\nhypothesis. In general, this research tradition assumes that a number of traits are associated\nwith individuals who are either very high or very low in babyfacedness, such as social\nsubmissiveness vs. dominance, social dependency vs. autonomy, physical weakness vs.\nstrength, and so on. This line of work has referenced bodily strength, but it has rarely\nfocused on it specifically.\nFor instance, Zebrowitz and Montepare (1992) investigated correlations between\nratings of babyfacedness and ratings of physical weakness (among other variables). The\ntwo variables correlated for both male and female targets of all age groups after infancy,\nand judgments of physical weakness also correlated with the composite variables reflecting\nactual babyfacedness of the judged faces.\nMore recently, using handgrip strength as a proxy of human physical strength\nshowed that women's ratings of men's dominance and masculinity based on faces\ncorrelated with those men's actual handgrip strength. Gallup, O'Brien, White, and Wilson\n(2010) also found that handgrip strength was positively correlated with self-ratings of\ndominance and aggression. Similarly, participants with more upper-body strength reported\nmore aggressive behavior and entitlement (Sell, Tooby, et al., 2009). However, they do not\nshow exactly relations between judgments of strength and dominance based on face.\nSupporting evidence also comes from findings that dominance and strength\njudgments are determined by the same variables. For instance, Jones et al. (2010) created\nmasculinized and feminized versions of target faces. Participants then judged the\ndominance and physical strength of those target persons. The masculinized versions were\njudged as both more dominant and physically strong.\nOosterhof and Todorov (2008), using a data driven statistical model (Blanz and\nVetter, 1999; Facegen Main Software Development, 2006), rendered computer-generated\nfaces varying along the dominance continuum and found that faces tended to be more\nmature and masculine in the positive extreme of the dominance axis. They assumed that\ndominance dimension was \"an overgeneralization of perception of facial cues signaling the\nphysical strength/weakness of the person\" (p. 11091). Nonetheless, these participants were\nnever asked to judge how physically strong they thought the person was.\nSell, Cosmides, et al. (2009) arrived at a similar idea. They tested what cues people\nuse to accurately judge the actual strength of a person. The targets in their study were\nactually tested for their objective strength through weight-lifting tasks. Observers'\njudgments of physical strength correlated with the actual strength of these targets, both\nwhen they saw the whole body, and also when they only saw the face.\nThus, the idea that physical strength underlies dominance ratings follows from an\nanalysis of the determinants of social dominance, has been prominently featured in\narguments on both facial dominance and judgments of strength, and is in line with previous\nfindings of the relation of judgments to actual physical strength. Here, we test directly\nwhether judgments of physically strength are related to judgments of dominance when\nparticipants only see faces. Furthermore, we will take a variety of correlational approaches,\nincluding tests for correlations when the judgments of dominance and physical strength are\ncoming from different participants.\nDominance and physical strength\nFacial features of dominance and strength\nIn addition, we take a closer look at the facial features underlying such a\ncorrelation. We explore if there are common facial predictors for both strength and\ndominance. Zebrowitz (1997) showed that a babyface has large eyes, high eyebrows, small\nchin, round jaw, and high forehead. A face judged as dominant typically features small\neyes, low brows, large chin, a more angular face and a low forehead (see also Keating,\nthat males have a bigger jaw, and a more prominent brow ridge and cheekbones. Because\nmasculinity can signal dominance (Muller and Mazur, 1997), more dominant faces share\nthose characteristics. Schaefer, Mitteroecker, Fink, and Bookstein (2009) demonstrated that\nmen's facial shape related to prenatal levels of testosterone was very similar to the facial\nshape that emerged from women's ratings of masculinity and dominance. More recently,\nWindhager et al. (2011) found that men's faces that were considered more dominant by\nwomen were more similar to physically strong faces. Using handgrip strength as a general\nmeasure of strength and with the help of a geometric morphometric (GMM) toolkit (e.g.,\nMitteroecker and Gunz, 2009), they were able to create a facial shape of men's strength.\nAfter that, they asked women to judge men's dominance. These researchers found that the\ndominant facial shape created on the basis of women's judgments resembled the physically\nstrong facial shape. They found that faces considered more dominant by women and faces\nfrom men with a stronger handgrip had shorter noses, thinner lips and wider middle and\nlower faces. It remains to be seen, using both judgments of perceived physical strength and\nperceived dominance by the participants, if there are common facial features that can\npredict both judged physical strength and dominance.\nOverview of the current research\nIn the current article, we present two studies. We test whether perceived physical\nstrength is related to dominance judgments from the face. In addition, we explore which\nfacial features are common predictors of both perceived strength and perceived dominance.\nIn Study 1, we used computer-generated faces (dimensions 400 x 400 pixels) from\nthe set developed by Oosterhof and Todorov (2008). In the Study 2, we used a set of photos\nWe collected judgments of strength and dominance for all pictures from both\ndatasets, and in addition measured all faces according to the dimensions described by\nMaterials and Methods\nMethod of both studies\nEthics statement. Both studies were conducted in agreement with the Ethics\nGuidelines issued in 2012 by the Scientific Commission (Comiss\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica) of the\n1 The faces used in our studies show some deviations from the Frankfort Horizontal which can limit the scope\nof interpretation of our facial measurements (see Schneider, Hecht, and Carbon, 2012).\nDominance and physical strength\nhosting institution Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Interven\u00e7\u00e3o Social, Lisboa, Portugal (CIS-\nProcedure. Data for both studies were collected online, using Qualtrics\n(www.qualtrics.com), and recruiting participants through Amazon Mturk (Buhrmester,\nKwang, and Gosling, 2011). Participants were informed that the faces would appear twice\nwith different questions, but the second question was not revealed until all judgments on\nthe first question were completed. Participants were told there were no right or wrong\nanswers and to answer intuitively.\nParticipants first judged all pictures on one of the dimensions (strength or\ndominance), and then all pictures again on the other dimension. The order of the two blocks\nwas counterbalanced, and the order of pictures within a block was randomized.\nThe faces were presented at the center of the screen with the question below. The\nquestions were \"How physically strong is this person?\" or \"How dominant is this person?\"\nfor the two dependent variables, with response scales from 1 to 7 presented below the\nquestion, anchored with \"very weak\" and \"very strong,\" or \"not at all dominant\" and \"very\ndominant,\" respectively.\nBefore the dominance block, we explained that by dominance we meant \"how much\nthis person wants to influence other people and how much she or he is able to do so.\"2\nFacial metrics. We measured the facial features with a procedure based on the one\nused in Zebrowitz, Kikuchi, and Fellous (2007). Each face was loaded into software\ndeveloped by us using Processing (\nFor\nstrength, no such explanation was deemed necessary.\nhttp://processing.org/). In this software, 40 facial points\nwere marked (see Figure 1) in all faces. These points were all marked independently for all\npictures by three research assistants. All distances used by Zebrowitz were used, and two\nmore were added (Z1 and Z2). All measures were normalized by the inter-pupil distance\n(E2) (see details of measurement in Zebrowitz et al., 2007)3\nThere was a high inter-rater reliability for all facial measures. The measurements\nshowed a high agreement for the normalization distance (E2) for both Study 1 ( = .98) and\n. We had 24 facial distance\nmeasures in total (see Figure 1). One of these was the normalization distance (E2), and one\nwas the composite distance Facial Roundness. The other measures corresponded to facial\nfeatures of the brows, eyes, cheekbones, nose, chin, and head length. More specifically, we\nmeasured the inner eyebrows distance (B1), distances related with brow height (B2 to B6),\nthe distance between the inner corners of eyes (E1), distance between the outer corners of\neyes (E3), eye width (E4), eye length (E5), nose width (N2) and nose length (N3), the head\nlength (L0), length of the jowl (S0), distance from the pupil to the center of the chin (C1),\nchin length (C3), mouth width (M0), philtrum length (M3), thickness of the upper lip (M4),\nlower facial width (W1), head width (W4), cheekbones width (W6), the Z2 thickness of the\nlower lip (Z2) and the length from the beginning of the hair until the end of the head (Z1).\n2 In this broad definition we thus include both potential and motivation for influence. Influence is a key aspect\nof social ranking/status (e.g., Cheng, Tracy, Foulsham, Kingstone, and Henrich 2013).\n3 It should be referred that this standardization through the inter-pupil distance is not able to erase the size\ncues from the faces. Because of the importance of height cues in judgments of human face (e.g., Re,\nDeBruine, Jones, and Perrett 2013), we recognize that this may influence the judgments of our participants.\nDominance and physical strength\nStudy 2 ( = .99). The average inter-rater reliability for all facial metrics showed a strong\nagreement for the Study 1 database faces ( = .85) and for Study 2 faces ( = .93) (see\nTable 1). We then averaged across the three raters all the facial distances measured and\nused these means in all following analyses.\nFigure 1. Measurement of facial metrics\nthrough marking of 40 reference points\nTable 1. Average inter-rater reliability of\nfacial features for face database of\nFeature\nICC\nICC\nFacial\nRoundness\nParticipants\nWe recruited 69 participants (41 female) from the United States of America (USA)\nand Western Europe through MTurk and paid each $0.50. The mean age was 34.5 years\nDominance and physical strength\nMaterials\nParticipants judged 60 computer-generated faces developed by Oosterhof and\nTodorov (2008; see Figure 2). The pictures were created with FaceGen software (Facegen\nModeller program version 3.1, http://facegen.com). The rendered pictures show heads of\nmostly White faces of both genders (for some faces, gender and ethnicity is hard to judge)\nwithout hair or clothing.\nFigure 2. Examples for the Stimuli in Study 1 (Database developed by Oosterhof and\nResults\nWe used Linear Mixed Models (also known as hierarchical linear modeling) to\nanalyze the relation between ratings of strength and ratings of dominance, and the\nmediation of this relation by facial features. For the mixed models, the units of analysis\nwere the single judgments made by the participants regarding dominance. Both picture and\nparticipant were added as groupings of the observations. For both pictures and participants,\nthe intercepts were allowed to vary randomly. The dependent variable was ratings of\ndominance.\nIn the first model, we introduced ratings of strength, order of ratings (strength first\nvs. dominance first), gender of participant, and their interactions as independent and fixed\nfactors. We estimated this model with the Mixed procedure in SPSS 18. The strength and\ndominance ratings were z-standardized (based on grand mean) prior to analysis. This model\nshowed that perceived strength was a significant predictor of perceived dominance,\nIt is possible that the second judgment assimilated to the first judgment. In order to\ncheck for this possibility, we needed to resort to aggregated values. We aggregated ratings\nof dominance and strength for each picture across participants, thereby creating a dataset\nwhere the single pictures were the units of analysis. Note that aggregation across so many\nobservers reduces error variance, resulting in higher correlations overall. After that, we\nstandardized the dominance and strength judgments. We did Pearson correlations between\nratings of strength and ratings of dominance. A first correlation was computed using both\njudgments participants gave, with each picture as the unit of analysis. The correlation was\nDominance and physical strength\nvery high, r = .95, p < .001. We then repeated this analysis using only the first answer each\nparticipant gave for the aggregation. The correlation obtained was about the same, r = .94,\np < .001. This indicates that, for this sample, a face that was perceived \u00ad on average \u00ad to be\ndominant was also perceived to be strong (see Figure 3), even when both judgments came\nfrom different participants who did not judge the other dimension first.\nFigure 3. Scatter plots of z-standardized mean judgments of strength and mean judgments\nof dominance\nWe then tested which facial features predicted judgments of dominance and\nstrength. For this, we ran two models. In the first, dominance was the dependent variable,\nand all facial features were added as independent variables. Pictures and participants were\nagain added as groupings, letting the intercepts vary randomly across both. The second\nmodel was the same except that strength was the dependent variable. We then identified\nwhich predictors were significant in both models.\nIn the outcomes of these models, we identified facial characteristics that predicted\nboth dominance and strength (see Table 2). There were three: brow height (negatively, \nstrength, N2). In addition, mouth width (M0) marginally (negatively) predicted dominance\nnarrow (vertically) eyes, low brows and a narrow mouth is simultaneously seen as strong\nand dominant. There was one facial feature - head width - that only predicted dominance\nThere was no facial feature that predicted strength but not dominance (see Table 2).\nDominance and physical strength\nTable 2. Facial features relation with dominance and physical strength judgments - Study 1\nStudy 1 Dominance Strength\nFeature  p\nCI low\nCI up  p\nCI low\nCI up\nFacial\nRoundness\nDiscussion\nIn Study 1, when participants judged computer-generated faces, perceptions of\nstrength and ratings of dominance were closely related, as shown both in the mixed model\nanalysis and in the correlations based on aggregated values. Importantly, this was also the\ncase when those ratings came from different participants (always using the first rating).\nOrder of ratings and gender of participants did not make any difference.\nOur analysis of facial features identified a wide nose, short (vertically) eyes, low\nbrows, and a narrow mouth as common predictors of strength and dominance. A less wide\nhead predicted dominance but not strength.\nOne problem with the second step of our analysis is that we investigated a large\nnumber of predictors simultaneously in the multilevel models. This has the potential to\nDominance and physical strength\ncreate false positives through accumulated alpha error. These results should thus be\ninterpreted as exploratory and subject to replication. Study 2 aims at providing such a\nreplication. There, we will jointly consider significance and inclusion in confidence\nintervals as criteria for replication.\nStudy 2 was conducted to replicate the findings from Study 1 with photos of real\nfaces instead of computer-generated pictures.\nParticipants\nWe recruited and paid 135 (78 female) participants from the USA and Western\nMaterials\n62% Euro-American, 15% Asian-American, 5% African-American, 2% Middle Eastern,\n5% Hispanic, 11% other, with no significant differences in strength as a function of\nethnicity) assembled by Sell, Cosmides, et al. (2009; see Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Example of the stimuli in Study 2 (Database developed by Sell, Cosmides, et al.,\nResults\nWe again set up a mixed model, predicting ratings of dominance from ratings of\nstrength, adding participant gender as a fixed factor, and both participant and picture as\ngrouping variables, allowing the intercepts to vary across them. Judgments of strength\nDominance and physical strength\nscales was not recorded. Note however that order had no effect in Study 1.\nWe then proceeded by creating aggregate scores, averaging ratings of strength and\ndominance across participants. We standardized these judgments and conducted Pearson\ncorrelations. The correlation of these two aggregated variables was somewhat lower than\nfor artificial faces, though still quite high, r = .78, p < .001.\nWe also analyzed whether judgments in our study were related to the actual upper\nbody-strength of the judged targets (targets were assessed on weight lifting machines; see\ndetails in Sell, Cosmides, et al., 2009). We used the aggregated values for these analyses\nfor the Pearson correlations (see Figure 5). Actual upper body strength was correlated both\nwith judgments of strength (r = .54, p < .001) and the judgments of dominance (r = .34, p <\n.001). In other words, men with objectively stronger upper bodies are judged as stronger\nand as more dominant purely relying on facial characteristics. To tease apart these\nrelations, we computed partial correlations. When controlling for dominance judgments,\nthe partial correlation between judged strength and actual strength remained significant, r =\n.46, p < .001. However, when controlling for judgments of strength, the partial correlation\nbetween dominance and the actual strength was not significant r = -.14, p = .308.\nWe then repeated the analyses performed in Study 1 (see Table 2) to determine\nwhich facial features predict both strength and dominance. We found fewer common\npredictors than in Study 1. Brow height (B6) predicted dominance significantly\n(E5) predicted marginally both dominance (also negatively),  = -0.19, p = .071 and\nstrength,  = -0.22, p = .079. Finally, chin length (C3) predicted (positively) dominance, \nfeaturing low brows, (vertically) narrow eyes, and large chin will be judged as both strong\nand dominant.\nFigure 5. Scatter plots of:\nA) z-standardized mean judgments of strength and mean judgments of dominance\nDominance and physical strength\nB) z-standardized mean judgments of strength and actual strength\nC) z-standardized mean judgments of dominance and actual strength\nWe found facial features that predicted dominance but not strength and vice versa.\nNose length (N3) predicted dominance significantly (positively),  = 0.26, p = .05 but not\nstrength,  = 0.11, p = .484. Distance from the pupil to the center of the chin (C1) predicted\nHowever, the facial features of nose width (N2) and mouth width (M0) that\npredicted both dominance and strength in Study 1, did not show the same pattern in Study\n.333. Finally, mouth width (M0) marginally predicted dominance (negatively),  = -0.12, p\nNonetheless, the -values for nose width (dominance:  = 0.10; strength:  = 0.10)\nDominance and physical strength\nare within the Study 1 confidence intervals for dominance (0.05; 0.25) and physical\nstrength (0.03; 0.25). Consequently, it is likely that Study 1 overestimated the strength of\nthis cue, but that this cue is still important. The estimates of mouth width (M0, dominance\n = -0.12; strength:  = 0.04) fall within the limits of the confidence intervals of Study 1\nonly for dominance judgments (-0.19; 0.01), but not for physical strength judgments (-0.20;\n0.02). Thus, Study 2 contradicts Study 1 here, and M0 is likely not used as a cue to\nphysical strength, but only used as a cue for dominance (see Table 3).\nTable 3. Facial features relation with dominance and physical strength judgments - Study 2\nStudy 2 Dominance Strength\nFeature  p\nCI low\nCI up  p\nCI low\nCI up\nFacial\nRoundness\nGeneral Discussion\nIn the current paper, we demonstrate a relation between perceived strength and\nDominance and physical strength\nperceived dominance for both computer-generated faces (Study 1) and photos of male faces\n(Study 2). In both studies, using multilevel modeling, we found that judgments of\ndominance were predicted by judgments of strength. When aggregating data across\nparticipants, and taking picture as the unit of analysis, the correlation is larger than .90 for\ncomputer-generated faces and larger than .70 for real faces. Importantly, this correlation\nremains unchanged when the strength and dominance were judged by different raters.\nNotably, the correlation between aggregated values of strength and dominance is\nlower for the natural photos in Study 2 than for the computer-generated in Study 1. (Note\nthat Matheson and McMullen, 2011, showed that computer-generated faces have the same\nperceptual and memory processing as natural faces). This could be the result of some real\ntargets not having perfectly neutral expressions, or not being uniformly bald, and thereby\nproviding other cues of dominance along with the cues related to strength alone (e.g.,\nperhaps cues of hostility). However, it should be noted that the coefficients in the mixed\nmodel did not differ substantially from each other.4\nFor the targets judged in Study 2, we had measurements of their actual upper-body\nstrength. Our data show that both the judgments of strength and dominance were related to\nactual strength. In other words, it is not only the case that dominance judgments are related\nto strength judgments, but also to actual strength. Thus, it seems that (accurately judged)\nactual strength might serve as a cue to dominance. Even though in typical Western social\nenvironments social status between adults is rarely negotiated based on physical strength\nexcept in sports contests, both males and females base their dominance judgments partly on\nfacial cues of strength.\nHowever, the modest correlation between dominance judgments and actual strength,\nand also the finding that the relation between dominance and actual strength become non-\nsignificant when controlling for judged strength, suggest that perceivers use other cues to\njudge dominance as well. During human evolution, physical strength was an important\nbasic heuristic for social status given that it predicted the ability to inflict costs.\nNonetheless, the mental skills associated with leadership, the ability to solve problems, and\nmaterial possessions would also be important for a higher social dominance because of\ntheir likelihood of increasing the ability to give benefits to others. Thus, not only the\nincreasing ability to win physical contests (i.e., greater physical strength), but also a greater\ninfluence in the community through the benefits that they are able to confer to the general\npopulation suggest that both processes can be avenues to perception of social dominance.\nIn tribal societies we can see that, for example, hunting skills, knowledge about migration\ncycles of animals, and being elderly are linked to a higher social status. In industrial\nsocieties social status is probably even less related to physical strength and more associated\nwith intelligence, social skills, and technological expertise (Cheng et al., 2013; Henrich and\nGoing beyond the identification of a relation between strength and dominance, we\nidentified common cues that may enable the assessment of strength and dominance. For the\n4 We conducted another study that is not reported in detail here, which replicated Study 1 with a larger sample\n(i.e., 300) of computer-generated faces. In that study, the correlation between the aggregated values of\nstrength and dominance was slightly lower than in Study 1, r = .84, p < .001. Thus, it seems that the\ndifference between Study 1 and Study 2 is less substantial than one might think.\nDominance and physical strength\nnatural faces the common predictors of high dominance and strength ratings were low\nbrows (B6), narrow (vertically) eyes (E5), and large chins (C3). In computer-generated\nfaces, common predictors were low brows (B6), narrow (vertically) eyes (E5), and wide\nnoses and narrow mouths (N2 and M0).\nIn previous studies, these facial features were already linked with dominance\njudgments. For instance, the baby face overgeneralization hypothesis (e.g., Zebrowitz,\n1997) posits that because babies have certain facial characteristics, people will judge\npersons according to those. Thus if someone has small eyes, large chins and low brows\npeople will tend to see those faces as resembling a mature adult because babies show the\nopposite pattern. Curiously, Dotsch and Todorov (2012) used a reverse correlation method\nwith natural faces and revealed that the most diagnostic facial cues of dominance were the\nregions around the eyes and the delineation of the face where they included the chin.\nWindhager et al. (2011) showed that the main regions related with perceived dominance\nwere a wide lower face, a short nose and small eyes. Although there were some differences\nwith the facial regions found in our research, these studies give support to the idea that the\nmain regions to track strength are essential to track dominance. We recognize that our\nmethod of identifying these facial features shows some limitations. Because faces are\nprocessed in a holistic way, that is, people tend to perceive and judge faces as a whole and\nnot as an identity of separated and independent features, this process of measuring multiple\nfacial distances between landmark points in space tends to ignore the general facial shape\nIt's important to add that our data by no means suggest that judgments of social\ndominance and judgments of bodily strength are the same. As the study of Windhager et al.\n(2011) revealed, strong faces and dominant faces are not identical. In their research, they\nwere able to show that strong and dominant facial shapes showed differences in certain\nfacial regions like the eyes, the eyebrows, the mouth, the chin, and the region between the\neyes and eyebrows. In our study, there were also differences in the facial features\npredicting dominance and physical strength. More specifically, for the computer-generated\nfaces, the head width negatively predicted dominance but did not predict strength.\nMoreover, in the natural faces we were able to show that a larger nose and a shorter\ndistance from the pupil to the center of the chin predicted dominance, but not physical\nstrength. Additionally, one of the measures related with the brow height (B2) predicted\nstrength, but not dominance. Besides that, the relation identified in the multilevel model\nclearly suggests that a substantial part of variance in dominance judgments is not related to\nbodily strength. It remains a task for future work to investigate where the two dimensions\nmight diverge despite the strong relation we found here.\nIn sum, we extend the knowledge related with the notion that dominance and\nstrength ratings go hand in hand, even when collecting these data from different\nparticipants and when tested on computer-generated and natural faces. Dominance\njudgments are based on strength ratings, backed up by the findings that actual bodily\nstrength predicts dominance.\nDominance and physical strength\nReferences\nBlanz, V., and Vetter, T.
