A comprehensive review of literature related to\ncaregivers of patients with chronic pain was performed. Findings from the review were applied to the Wallander et al.'s Risk\nand Resistance Model of Adjustment, specifically examining outcomes among SCCPP. No statistical results are presented\nin this conceptual article. We advocate for the need to study and test the adjustment process of SCCPP in a systematic,\ncomprehensive, and theory-driven manner to further understand caregivers' strengths and challenges. This will allow for\nfurther rehabilitation interventions to address risk factors and promote resistance factors, allowing for more inclusive mental\nhealth care for SCCPP.\n",

Caregiver adjustment has a profound\nimpact on the well-being of the patient, as the process of\nadjusting to chronic illness is affected greatly by the func-\ntioning of the caregiver. Ultimately, the degree to which the\nindividual with a disability and the caregiver are able to cope\neffectively with the situation contributes to the health and\nwell-being of both individuals (Chronister & Chan, 2006;\nThe importance of understanding the role of the caregiver\nin the adjustment process is underscored by a general shift in\nthe health care system. This paradigm shift is notable in the\nmovement from inpatient care that addresses immediate\nmedical needs to outpatient care that addresses residual func-\ntional limitations and reintegration into independent living\nand employment. In addition, this shift is also affected by the\nshortage of available paraprofessionals to provide assistance\nwith tasks such as daily living skills (McCann & Wadsworth,\nConsequently, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners\nhave become increasingly interested in the role of caregiving\nin health care outcomes (Elliott et al., 1999).\nPurpose of the Study\nProminent pain researchers have acknowledged the impor-\ntance of incorporating families as part of the treatment pro-\ncess for chronic pain patients. However, few theoretical\nmodels exist with regard to family adjustment and chronic\npain (e.g., Kopp et al., 1995; Romano, Turner, & Jensen,\nries have served as useful conceptual guides for current\nresearch and practice, a comprehensive search of the litera-\nture in this area indicates that empirical outcomes from these\nattempts have not been published. In addition, literature on\ncaregiver adjustment to other disabilities stresses the need\nfor a caregiver of persons with chronic pain model that con-\nsiders psychological protective factors such as family\nstrength, resiliency, coping, and well-being. This model\nshould also consider social protective factors such as avail-\nable social support and family strengths, environmental fac-\ntors such as financial security and adequate health insurance\n1VA WNY Healthcare System, Buffalo, NY, USA\n2University at Buffalo, State University of New York, NY, USA\n3San Francisco State University, CA,USA\n4Battle Creek VA, Battle Creek, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGloria K.

Given the need to understand\nthe adjustment of spousal caregivers of chronic pain patients\n(SCCPP) and the lack of systematic and empirically vali-\ndated models to drive research and practice, the purpose of\nthis article is to propose a comprehensive, theory-driven con-\nceptual framework for guiding research and clinical practice\nwhen working with SCCPP. The proposed framework is\nadapted from Wallander, Varni, Babani, Banis, and Wilcox's\n(1988) Risk and Resistance Model of Adjustment. This com-\nprehensive model has been empirically validated and sup-\nported within independent research as well as across different\nmedical disabilities. Specific literature on SCCPPis reviewed\nand contextualized using this model as the basic framework.\nLiterature Review\nChronic Pain\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)\ndefines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experi-\nence associated with actual or potential tissue damage or\ndescribed in terms of such damage\" (IASP Subcommittee on\nTaxonomy, 2003). Chronic pain is pain that persists beyond\nwhat would be considered normal tissue healing time (IASP\nSubcommittee on Taxonomy, 2003). According to a large-\nscale international study on the prevalence and impact of\nchronic pain in 15 European countries and Israel, 19% of the\n46,394 participants reported having chronic pain for\n6 months or more and experienced chronic pain within the\nlast month (Breivik, Collett, Ventafridda, Cohen, &\nGallacher, 2006). Sixty-six percent reported having moder-\nate pain, and 34% reported severe pain. Forty-six percent\nreported having constant pain while 54% had intermittent\npain. The range of pain duration ranged from 2 to 15 years.\nChronic pain is becoming recognized as a significant\nnational and international health care problem, and the rise in\ndisability associated with chronic pain has been described as\nreaching epidemic proportions (Lindberg & Bluestein, 2002;\nMason, Skevington, & Osborn, 2004). Chronic pain has been\nlinked with mental health disorders, including depression\nand anxiety, and has also been associated with impairment in\nactivities of daily living. Individuals with chronic pain have\nbeen found to be less likely or altogether unable to work out-\nside their homes, and others needed to change employment\nor lost employment as a result of their pain conditions\n(Breivik et al., 2006). As a result, significant costs are often\nassociated with disability compensation, loss in work pro-\nductivity, and treatment side effects.\nIn contrast to the general caregiving literature, there is a\npaucity of literature regarding the experience of SCCPP.\nThere is some evidence that suggests that SCCPP experience\nincreased psychological distress, relationship dissatisfaction,\nfinancial problems, role changes, and sexual dysfunction\n2009). However, other research has shown that SCCPP do\nnot necessarily experience distress or negative effects as a\nresult of caregiving (Basolo-Kunzer, Diamond, & Reed,\nof positive psychology, resiliency, adjustment, and psycho-\nlogical interventions provide plausible explanations to the\nvarying adjustment ability of caregivers, including stress\nappraisal, coping resources, personal attributes, and disposi-\ntional tendencies (e.g., internal locus of control, optimism,\nself-efficacy; Carver, Scheier, & Segerstrom, 2010; Horton\naddition, Romano and Schmaling (2001) suggested that the\nheterogeneity of chronic pain diagnoses (e.g., cancer-related,\nmusculoskeletal, neuropathic) may result in different psy-\nchosocial profiles (different levels of coping mechanisms,\ndifferent levels and types of stressors, availability of sup-\nport), which in turn may contribute to varying adjustment\nresults. Despite the heterogeneity of chronic pain conditions,\nintervention studies show that couple- or spouse-oriented\ninterventions have a positive impact on the chronic pain\npatient and SCCPP outcomes. For example, Keefe et al.\n(1996) found that participation in a long-term spouse-assisted\ncoping skills training intervention resulted in significantly\nhigher levels of pain self-efficacy and increased marital\nadjustment among patients with knee osteoarthritis. Martire,\nSchulz, Keefe, Rudy, and Starz (2007) also found that cou-\nple-oriented education and support interventions effectively\nreduced spousal stress, with spouses exhibiting less critical\nattitudes, higher marital satisfaction, and less depressive\nsymptoms.\nTheoretical Framework\nCaregiving research has been called \"one of the largest and\nmost conceptually sophisticated literatures in health psychol-\nevidenced by various theoretical models of caregiving that\nexamine the relationships between caregiver stress, psycho-\nsocial resources, and caregiver well-being (Aneshensel,\nHaley, Levine, Brown, & Bartolucci, 1987; Lawton, Kleban,\ngeneral, these models are consistent with traditional stress\nprocess theories, which emphasize the importance of the\ncaregivers' personal and environmental resources in their\nadjustment as well as overall health and mental well-being.\nThus, like any stressor, caregiving stress is considered a psy-\nchological situation wherein the degree to which caregiving\nis perceived as stressful is based on the nature of the transac-\ntion between the caregiving situation and the individual's\npersonal and environmental resources. Among the different\nmodels used in psychological and adjustment research,\nLazarus and Folkman's (1984) Transactional Model of Stress\nTheory has been commonly adopted in such research. This\nMercurio-Riley et al. 3\nmodel indicates bidirectionality on the relationship between\npersonal characteristics and environmental properties in\naffecting adjustment outcomes when someone faces an aver-\nsive event. Such personal and environmental variables, how-\never, can be buffered by certain variables such as coping\nAlthough some empirical studies suggest that caregiving\nmay increase distress levels, burden, and marital dissatisfac-\nZarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980), others indicate that\nthe role of caregiving may also provide an opportunity for\ngrowth, satisfaction, and challenge (Benner & Wrubel, 1989;\nMachamer, Temkin, & Dikmen, 2002) as well as improved\nfamily functioning through increased emotional bonds\nas the Transactional Model of Stress Theory (Lazarus &\nFolkman, 1984) has received merits in its application to psy-\nchological research, its utilization focused solely on coping\nand neglected other pertinent factors such as the nature of the\nstressful event, intrapersonal characteristics, and social sup-\nport. The Risk and Resistance Model postulated by Wallander\nand researchers, however, provides a more comprehensive\nframework that includes variables beyond coping as a perti-\nnent variable in affecting an individual's adjustment in\nresponse to a stressful event. Wallander and researchers'\nmodel has also been adopted and used in the psychological\nadjustment research in adults and children as well as their\ncaregivers. Given the merits and the comprehensiveness of\nthis model, we chose to use the Risk and Resistance Model\nas the framework for the current article.\nRisk and Resistance Model of\nAdjustment: An Introduction\nThe Risk and Resistance Model (Wallander et al., 1988) was\noriginally developed to investigate the psychological adjust-\nment of children and families with chronic physical disabili-\nties and illnesses. Included in the model are three sets of risk\nfactors: (a) condition parameters (e.g., diagnosis, visibility of\nthe condition, brain involvement, and severity of the condi-\ntion), (b) functional independence, and (c) psychological\nstress (e.g., handicap-related problems, major life events,\nand daily hassles). Similarly, there are three sets of resistance\nfactors: (a) stress processing (e.g., cognitive appraisal, and\ncoping strategies), (b) intrapersonal factors (e.g., tempera-\nment, competence, motivation, and problem solving ability),\nand (c) socioecological factors (e.g., family environment,\nsocial support, parental adjustment, and resources). Research\nexploring the adjustment of caregivers of children with a\nmedical condition reported that in addition to the normative\nlife events and the daily hassles associated with dealing with\nthe illness or the disability of the children, the severity of the\nchild's condition often leads to parental maladjustment not\nnecessarily by the disability itself but due to the\ndisability-related stress resulting from it (e.g., Brown et al.,\nThis negative impact, however, can be buffered by resistance\nfactors that moderate or mediate the association between\nthe condition and adjustment (e.g., positive coping, positive\nstress appraisal, positive locus of control, optimism, ade-\nquate social support). Studies adapting this risk and resis-\ntance model of adjustment have demonstrated consistent\nresults supporting the positive and negative influence of\nadjustment outcomes associated with risk and resistance\nvariables, respectively (e.g., Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al.,\nSmith-Whitley, & Ohene-Frempong, 2004; McLean et al.,\nConceptual Framework for the\nPsychosocial Adjustment of Spousal\nCaregivers of Persons With Chronic\nPain\nIn this section, we propose a comprehensive framework for\nunderstanding the psychosocial adjustment of SCCPP.\nNotably, the general examples cited in the Wallander et al.\nmodel may not apply to SCCPP, while others may, depend-\ning on the clinical population examined. For example, brain\ninvolvement is a logical disability-related factor for a clinical\npopulation that involves brain damage (e.g., traumatic brain\ninjury). However, a study applying the Wallander and\nresearchers' model on a different disability group and care-\ngiving role (e.g., prostate cancer and female spousal adjust-\nment) may not explore brain damage but other pertinent\nvariables unique to this clinical condition, such as sexual\nfunctioning. In this review, the general framework of the\nRisk and Resistance Model will be adapted with the added\nspecificity from chronic pain literature on spousal and care-\ngiver adjustment.\nFigure 1 depicts the diagrammatic representation of the\nproposed framework. The first column represents the three\nrisk constructs, including the pain condition, functional\ndependence, and psychological stress. The second column\nrepresents the three resistance constructs, including stress\nprocessing, intrapersonal, and socioecological factors. The\nthird column represents the outcome construct, which is con-\nceptualized as including a multitude of adjustment measures\ncommonly proposed in the literature addressing psychologi-\ncal adjustment among patients and caregivers, including psy-\nchopathology, health, quality of life, life satisfaction, and\nmarital adjustment. Under each of the risk and resistance\nconstructs, unique factors that make up its respective con-\nstruct are listed as bullet points.\nThe following discussion provides a detailed review of\neach factor within each construct in this conceptual frame-\nwork. Because adequate evidence has yet to accrue in terms\nof mediating or moderating effects, we are not in the position\n4 SAGE Open\nto integrate such effects with confidence in the framework\nwe propose. Therefore, the diagram represents a conceptual\ndiagram, but not a path analysis or structural equation model\nfor any direct, indirect, or mediating effects of the variables.\nOutcomes\nMuch of the literature that has examined emotional distress\nin SCCPP suggests that depression and anxiety are among\nthe most frequently reported complaints (e.g., Ahern &\nFlor, & Rudy, 1987). In addition, evidence also indicates\nhigher marital distress among couples in whom the SCCPP is\naffected by the chronic pain condition of their spouse (e.g.,\n& Cano, 2006). Conversely, positive outcomes of adjustment\nare also evident among SCCPP, and clinical interventions\nhave been shown to enhance these outcomes. For instance,\nafter engaging in a couple-oriented education and support\nintervention for osteoarthritis patients, SCCPP showed\nhigher marital satisfaction, less depressive symptoms, and\nbetter sense of caregiver mastery (Martire et al., 2006).\nTherefore, research in measuring adjustment outcomes\nshould encompass a variety of measures as well as positive\nand negative impacts.\nRisk Constructs\nPatient's pain condition.The first risk construct is the phe-\nnomenon that defines what is unique about the diagnosis of\ninterest and its associated clinical manifestations. Under this\nframework, this risk construct is the patient's chronic pain\ncondition. The pain condition involves the severity, inten-\nsity, and the often invisible nature of the condition. Chronic\npain studies have found that the subjective level of the\npatient's chronic pain condition is related to caregiver's psy-\nchological well-being. Early study findings by Maruta,\nSCCPP reported a decline in marital satisfaction since the\nonset of their partner's condition. Schwartz and colleagues\nfor which level of the patient's pain was one of the three\nsignificant predictors. SCCPP also reported more personal\ndistress when the chronic pain patients reported higher levels\nof pain and/or anger. In addition, Leonard and Cano (2006)\nfound the severity of chronic pain correlated significantly\nand positively with SCCPP's adjustment in terms of depres-\nsion and marital dissatisfaction.\nAnother aspect of the pain condition construct relevant to\nthe adjustment of SCCPPis the invisible nature of the chronic\npain condition. Invisible conditions are often caused by\nchronic illnesses such as neuromuscular diseases (Matthews\nPain Condition (patient)\n-severity/intensity\n-(in)visibility/types\nFunctional Dependence\n-interference of patient's\nlife\n-interference of spouse's\nlife\n-sexual dysfunction\nOutcome (SCCPPs)\n-psychopathology\n-health\n-quality of life\n-life satisfaction\n-marital adjustment\nIntrapersonal\n-self efficacy, locus of\ncontrol (spouse)\n-self efficacy, locus of\ncontrol (patient)\n-personality (patient)\nStress Processing\n-patient's coping\n-spouse's coping\n-spouse's cognitive\nappraisal\n-spouse acceptance\nSocio-ecological\n-spousal interaction\n-formal & informal support\nPsychological Stress\n-patient's psychological\nand marital adjustment\n-spousal role strain\n-spouse's perceived burden\nFigure 1.

Column 2: Three resistance factor groups are depicted direct-\ning to the column factors. Column 3: outcome factors. Risk and resistance constructs are guided according to Wallander et al.'s model. Specific factors\nunder each constructs were listed according to existing literature in chronic pain and caregiving. SCCPP = Spousal Caregivers of Chronic Pain Patients.\nMercurio-Riley et al. 5\n& Harrington, 2000), and they are occasionally of unknown\netiology. Understanding conditions such as fibromyalgia and\nchronic fatigue syndrome may be difficult due to the fact that\netiology, diagnosis, and treatment are not readily present.\nSimilarly, chronic pain conditions may have no overt or\nobvious source of pain (e.g., visible physical injuries), and\ntherefore, it may be difficult for SCCPP to fully empathize\nwith their spouse's pain. Faucett and Levine (1991) sug-\ngested that this type of situation often results in others ques-\ntioning the intensity of the pain as well as the psychological\nconsequences that accompany the condition. SCCPP's lack\nof understanding of the pain condition and chronic pain\npatients' behavioral manifestations (e.g., engaging in pain\nbehaviors, avoiding physical activity, decreased social or\noccupational functioning) may lead to development of nega-\ntive or critical views of the patient. Furthermore, this misper-\nception dramatically affects the adjustment of the SCCPP.\nMartire and Schulz (2007) found that SCCPP who had an\naccurate perception and understanding of their partners' pain\nresponded less negatively, provided emotional support that\nwas more satisfying to the chronic pain patient, and reported\nless stress from providing support and assistance. Although\nthe focus of this study was on the impact of spousal response\nto chronic pain patients, it also pointed to the importance of\nthe perception of the SCCPP in affecting their own stress\nlevel and willingness to provide support. Early study find-\nings by Flor et al. (1987) suggested that SCCPP's level of\nunderstanding of the chronic pain condition of their spouses\nwas directly related to their own psychological adjustment\nand well-being.\nIn sum, while the pain condition can cause distress to the\nchronic pain patient, it can also affect SCCPP in a substantial\nmanner. In particular, the severity and invisibility of the con-\ndition may affect spousal perception, which in turn may\naffect interactions with chronic pain patients. However, the\nfunctional limitations caused by the chronic pain conditions\nappear to have a larger impact than the pain condition itself\non the adjustment of SCCPP. This will be discussed under\nthe next construct of functional dependence.\nFunctional dependence.In our framework of adjustment of\nSCCPP, the second risk construct pertains to the chronic pain\npatient's functional limitations and degree of interference in\ndaily life activities related to the chronic pain condition, for\nthe pain patients themselves and to the SCCPP. Functional\ndependence has been found to have a negative effect on\nSCCPP. For example, high levels of spouse-rated patient\npsychosocial disability were found to be associated with\ngreater marital dissatisfaction (Geisser et al., 2005). In addi-\ntion, spousal perception of the patient's functional limita-\ntions was found to be significantly related to the adjustment\nKopp et al. (1995) found that among patients with headaches\nand chronic low back pain, the reduction of leisure activities\nfor the patients and their caregivers (interference) was related\nto negative overall family functioning.\nSexual dysfunction is commonly reported among chronic\npain patients and is therefore an important factor of this con-\nstruct. Chronic pain patients frequently indicate dissatisfac-\ntion with their sex lives, changes in frequency or complete\nelimination of sexual activity, and a decrease in relationship\nintimacy (Esmail, Huang, Lee, & Maruska, 2010; Esmail,\nMunro, & Gibson, 2007). Furthermore, practitioners treating\nmusculoskeletal conditions are often not trained to discuss\nsexual concerns, and therefore, these issues may be under-\naddressed (Rosenbaum, 2009). Numerous factors have been\nassociated with reported sexual dysfunction, including psy-\nchological factors, self-esteem, medication side effects, and\nrelationship problems (Rico-Villademoros et al., 2012).\nSexual dysfunction has been found to be more prevalent and\nfrequently reported by those patients with greater overall dis-\nability, higher levels of depression, impaired coping, and\nshorter pain duration (Kwan, Roberts, & Swalm, 2005).\nNaturally, SCCPP can be affected by the sexual dysfunction\nof chronic pain patients. These findings highlight that func-\ntional dependence and life interference appear to be impor-\ntant aspects of SCCPP's adjustment, more so than the\ndisability or diagnosis itself. Therefore, it is imperative to\nfurther investigate this factor to explore its clinical implica-\ntions when working with this population.\nPsychological stress. The third risk construct includes psycho-\nlogical stress. This construct is defined as any challenge that\none faces without having adequate resources with which to\ncope. In this conceptual framework, this risk construct\nincludes the stress and tension resulting from the chronic\npain patients' own psychological and marital maladjustment\nand SCCPP's role strain, as well as subjective burden. Early\nstudy findings by Flor et al. (1986) suggested that the best\npredictors of SCCPP marital satisfaction were a combination\nof their own depressed mood and the marital satisfaction of\nthe chronic pain patient, accounting for 45% of the total vari-\nance. Similarly, Schwartz and colleagues (1991) found that\nchronic pain patients' reported anger and hostility and spou-\nsal level of marital satisfaction were found to be predictors of\nspousal depression. The authors suggested that the relation-\nship between lower marital satisfaction and more reported\ndistress could be due to an approach-avoidance method of\ndealing with conflict. Specifically, SCCPP may feel sympa-\nthy for the chronic pain patient's pain condition but may\navoid him or her due to their hostile behaviors. In addition,\nSCCPP who feel that they have no control over the situation\nmay experience feelings of helplessness. From a learned\nhelplessness perspective, this perceived lack of control may\nresult in depressive symptoms among SCCPP.\nOther dimensions of SCCPP stress include burden associ-\nated with and resulting from the presence of cumulative\nstressors. Subjective burden is defined as the perception of\npsychological distress, depression, anxiety, demoralization,\nand generalized loss of personal freedom attributed directly\nto caregiving (Lawton et al., 1989). Caregiving stress\nincludes objective burden and subjective burden. Subjective\n6 SAGE Open\nburden involves the amount of psychological strain experi-\nenced by caregivers that is attributable to changes in the\npatient (Brooks, Campsie, Symington, Beattie, & McKinlay,\nstudies indicate that SCCPP experience high levels of sub-\njective burden in the area of worry, financial setbacks, loss of\nfreedom, and physical and emotional demands of caregiving\nmental, and patient-related factors contribute to perceived\nburden. It has been reported that SCCPP who lack open com-\nmunication with the chronic pain patient experience higher\nlevels of subjective burden and strain (Porter, Keefe,\nWellington, & deWilliams, 2008). Positive relationships\nbetween chronic pain patients'levels of physical and psycho-\nlogical well-being and perceived burden of SCCPP have also\nbeen found (Beckham, Burker, Rice, & Talton, 1995). In\naddition, Martire et al. (2006) found that among other chronic\npain patients' pain and psychosocial variables, pain severity\npredicted the SCCPPs' perceived stress level and their per-\nceived level of mastery, which in turn affect SCCPPs' psy-\nchological well-being.\nAnother important facet of psychological stress in SCCPP\nis role strain, which may be conceptualized as stress result-\ning from the dual role of spouse and caregiver. Role strain\ntheory posits that multiple roles may result in competition for\nan individual's time while draining psychological and physi-\ntified two levels of role strain in caregivers. At the task\nspecific level, role strain is characterized by difficultly com-\npleting tasks and behaviors that impair caregiving. A more\nglobal level of role strain occurs when the caregiver believes\nthat the entire caregiving situation is stressful. Caring for a\nspouse or partner with a chronic health condition is often a\nrole that is imposed without choice or notice (Winter,\nthat the level of disability incurred by a chronic pain patient\ncontributes to the stress of the caregiver and stems from\nacute and long-term demands and the accumulation of other\nresponsibilities and stressors on the SCCPP. The impact of\nthis change may affect the SCCPP in areas such as social and\nand physical and mental health (Ostwald, 2009; Pinquart &\nIn conclusion, this body of research supports the idea that\nthe relationship adjustment of the chronic pain patient has an\nimpact on the adjustment of SCCPP. In addition, issues stem-\nming from the stress of maintaining dual roles of spouse and\ncaregiver should continue to be investigated in future\nresearch.\nResistance Constructs\nStress processing. Stress processing represents the first resis-\ntance construct in this conceptual framework. Stress process-\ning, as defined by the Wallander and researchers (1988), are\nthe cognitive appraisals and coping strategies used to buffer\nstress. Before discussing the literature supporting the stress\nprocessing aspects of SCCPP adjustment, a brief discussion\nof the cognitive-behavioral transactional model of chronic\nmerited here, as it will link the perceived burden/stress, stress\nprocessing, intrapersonal, and social support aspects of this\nconceptual framework.\nThe CBTM posits that family (especially SCCPP) tends\nto be the primary source of social reinforcement; therefore,\nits role becomes imperative in affecting the adjustment of\nSCCPP. One of the key elements of the CBTM is the interac-\ntion or reinforcement that SCCPP provide in facilitating the\npositive or negative perception and behavior of chronic pain\npatients. The concept of \"transtheoretical\" indicates that the\nappraisal of the situation of the patients and the SCCPP can\nplay an important role in affecting each other's coping and\nadjustment. Family, therefore, plays an important component\nin this model by searching for information and evaluating\nand seeking resources, as well as making decision based on\ninformation gathered from others and the environment.\nFamily appraisal (from both sides) plays a role in developing\na schema or beliefs about the situation (coping with the\nadversities of chronic pain and coping with the challenges of\nhaving a family member with chronic pain). Central to this\nCBTM is the appraisal-coping process, where appraisal of\nthe situation influences the subsequent coping mechanisms\nand strategies and is important in determining whether the\nspecific response will be reinforced or discontinued.\nAs defined earlier, stress, a risk construct, is defined as the\nperceived burden, subjective stress, and role strain associ-\nated with the caregiving role (Brooks et al., 1986; ; Zarit\net al., 1980). Stress processing or coping, on the other hand,\nrefers to practical actions taken and can include an array of\nresources, styles, and efforts that people draw on when faced\nwith life stressors to increase a sense of well-being and avoid\nbeing harmed by stressful demands. Definitions of the con-\nstruct have encompassed a range of personal characteristics\nincluding stable and enduring traits (resources), habitual\nstyles, or behavioral patterns (styles), as well as situation-\nspecific cognitive and behavioral efforts applied in a given\ncircumstance (efforts). Numerous types of coping styles and\nefforts have been conceptualized and tested in the literature.\nThe most popular conceptualization is the typology of emo-\ntion-focused, problem-focused, and avoidant-focused coping\nefforts (Chronister, 2004; Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman,\nThe role of coping in the adjustment process among\nchronic pain patients is well documented. However, the role\nof coping among SCCPP's adjustment processes is limited.\nThe studies that do exist suggest that SCCPP's and chronic\npain patients' coping styles moderate SCCPP's stress reac-\ntions. For example, reduced SCCPP stress was associated\nwith chronic pain patients who had higher adaptive coping\nstyles and fewer pain behaviors (Junghaenel, 2007). In\nMercurio-Riley et al. 7\naddition, SCCPP who used positive coping styles and\nexpressed an understanding of the patient's disability\nreported higher levels of psychosocial adjustment and well-\nbeing (Flor et al., 1987). SCCPP's negative coping styles,\nspecifically magnification, helplessness, and catastrophiz-\ning, have been found to be significantly correlated to their\nown depression and marital dissatisfaction (Leonard & Cano,\n2006). Furthermore, patients' helplessness and catastrophiz-\ning behaviors were also associated with depressive symp-\ntoms for SCCPP.\nChronic pain patients who use the coping style of \"accep-\ntance\" report greater psychological well-being (Viane et al.,\n2003). However, little empirical support exists regarding\nSCCPP's acceptance of their partners' chronic pain and how\nit relates to their own adjustment.Arecent study by Mercurio-\nRiley (2011) found that SCCPP who reported higher levels of\nacceptance of their partners' pain also reported better quality\nof life across physical, psychological, social-relationships,\nand environmental domains of quality of life. In addition,\ncaregivers in this study who were more accepting of their\npartners' pain were also found to be more resilient. Studies\nthat have looked at similar constructs provide some support\nfor the role of caregiver acceptance and interaction styles in\naffecting the adjustment process of the chronic pain patient.\nMcCracken (2004) found that solicitous behaviors (i.e.,\nexcessive expression of sympathy) by SCCPP are related to\nincreased patient pain behaviors, while punishing responses\nfrom SCCPP such as anger, ignoring, and frustration are also\nrelated to maladaptive patient outcomes, including less activ-\nity engagement and pain willingness (i.e., engaging in activi-\nties despite pain and doing little to avoid or control painful\nexperiences) and less overall acceptance of pain. In the\ngeneric rehabilitation literature, the concept of acceptance of\na disability has been well documented (i.e., that a person with\na disability who accepts his or her disability as part of the self\nis associated with better adjustment; Bishop, 2005; Li &\ncept has not been applied to how others' acceptance of a\npatient's limiting condition or disability would affect the\nadjustment of their caregivers. An exploration of the coping\nstyle of acceptance in SCCPP may provide additional evi-\ndence regarding its role in adjustment, well-being, greater\nrelationship satisfaction, and improved quality of life.\nWhile ample research evidence supports the importance\nof positive and active coping mechanisms among chronic\npain patients in dealing with their pain and disability-related\nstress, limited research has been conducted in the area of\nstress processing as a coping mechanism among SCCPP. For\ninstance, aligning with the CBTM model discussed earlier,\nan understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the\nways in which SCCPP perceive and cope with their stressors\nis important in understanding their own adjustment. In addi-\ntion, the concept of acceptance of the spouse's chronic pain\ncondition by SCCPP can be explored to understand how this\nacceptance may have an impact on SCCPP themselves.\nIntrapersonal variables. The second resistance construct con-\nsists of intrapersonal, that is, internal characteristics of the\naffected individual (in this case the SCCPP) when faced with\nthe stresses and challenges of caregiving, as well as internal\ncharacteristics of the chronic pain patients. Such variables\nwill be discussed in relation to the SCCPPs' framework of\nadjustment and include sense of coherence, self-efficacy,\nlocus of control, optimism, and personality. Antonovsky's\n(1979) concept of sense coherence is defined as a mixture of\noptimism and sense of control; one has a sense of confidence\nabout positive outcomes despite adversities in life. Several\nstudies suggest that self-efficacy, as defined as one's per-\nceived ability and confidence in performing or carrying out a\ntask, plays an important role in patients' own adjustment.\nIn addition, other studies also explored how the self-effi-\ncacy level of the patient and the caregiver would affect the\nother's adjustment. The level of the self-efficacy of patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis has been found to be one of the\nstrongest predictors of caregiver burden and optimism\n(Beckham et al., 1995). Self-efficacy in patients with cancer\nwas found to be associated with less anxiety and caregiver\nPorter and colleagues (2008) investigated the role of self-\nefficacy in pain communication between SCCPP and chronic\npain patients with osteoarthritis. Findings indicated that\nhigher levels of self-efficacy among SCCPP regarding pain\ncommunication were related to their own positive affect.\nSpecifically, SCCPP who were more confident in their abil-\nity to understand and respond effectively to the patient's pain\nexperienced more positive affect. In addition, higher levels\nof self-efficacy among SCCPP were significantly and nega-\ntively correlated with SCCPP's negative affect. Results from\nCampbell et al. (2004) indicated that higher levels of care-\ngiver self-efficacy in relation to patients' symptom control\nwere associated with caregivers' reported higher quality of\nlife, better reported health and mental health, reduced depres-\nsive symptoms, and less perceived caregiver strain.\nIn addition to self-efficacy, other intrapersonal variables\nsuch as locus of control have been investigated in relation to\nSCCPP's adjustment. Early study findings suggested that\nSCCPP's sense of control was related to their adjustment and\nwell-being (Flor et al., 1987). Finally, SCCPP also reported\nhigher levels of control (manageability, sense of coherence)\nand it related to better SCCPP adjustment when compared\nwith spouses with a partner without any disability (Romano\net al., 1997). It was suggested that lower cohesion is a result\nof the SCCPP's perception that the chronic pain patients can-\nnot contribute to household duties and be a supportive mem-\nber of the family. Therefore, caregivers exhibit high levels of\ncontrol in response to the need for organization and rules to\nhelp lessen the demands. Intrapersonal factors, similar to the\nperceived stress/burden factors and the psychological pro-\ncessing previously described, relied on the subjective\nappraisal of the SCCPP. Despite the fact that there is a pau-\ncity of literature on the intrapersonal variables and their\n8 SAGE Open\neffect on caregiver adjustment, their relationship has been\nsupported in findings in literature of other chronic condi-\ntions. For example, Piira, Chow, and Suranyi (2002) found in\ncaregivers of patients with chronic diabetes that caregiver\nlocus of control was a significant predictor of caregivers'\nnegative affect.\nThe attachment style (e.g., personality traits or interper-\nsonal dynamics) of chronic pain patients and SCCPP has also\nbeen studied in relationship to SCCPP's adjustment (Porter,\nDavis, & Keefe, 2007). Chronic pain patients with secure\nattachment styles or who are more interpersonally indepen-\ndent were found to have higher levels of self-efficacy, opti-\nmism in relation to symptom management, and positive\nadjustment outcomes (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). Other\nresearchers have found that maladaptive attachment styles\nare related to negative outcomes. Attachment anxiety (over-\ndependence) relates to \"hypervigilance,\" wherein patients\ntend to exaggerate their appraisal of a threat. These patients\nexhibit poor coping abilities, overdependence on others, and\nprolonged emotional distress (Mikulincer & Shaver), which\nin turn is related to a higher level of pain (McDonald &\nis also evidence that chronic pain patients who have an\navoidance attachment style tend to use \"deactivating\" meth-\nods to deal with the threat related to caregiving resulting in\nthe patient minimizing attention to and avoiding threat-\nrelated cues, as well as underappraising threat and using\navoidant and emotion-focused coping styles (Mikulincer &\nShaver). Porter et al., (2012) reported that spouses of lung\ncancer patients with an anxious attachment style had higher\nlevels of caregiving strain, and those with avoidant attach-\nment style experienced lower levels of marital adjustment\nand lower self-efficacy in relation to assisting the patients.\nIn summary, this evidence supports the importance of\nexamining the impact of intrapersonal variables of chronic\npain patients and SCCPP in further understanding SCCPP's\nadjustment process. Specifically, locus of control, self-effi-\ncacy, and personality styles (e.g., attachment) appear to play\nimportant mediating roles in SCCPP's adjustment (e.g.,\nal., 2008). The effects of intrapersonal variables, similar to\nthose from stress processing and perceived stress discussed\nearlier, are intertwined with the perception of the SCCPP.\nOngoing research is needed to provide support on how these\nintrapersonal variables play a role in SCCPP's adjustment\nprocess.\nSocioecological variables.The third resistance construct is\ndefined as external and/or environmental variables that affect\none's adjustment. Pertaining to the SCCPPs' framework,\nthese socioecological variables include spousal interaction\nand social support.\nIn the chronic pain literature, social support is contextual-\nized in terms of how support or SCCPP's behaviors feed into\nthe adjustment of chronic pain patients. Referring to the\ncognitive-behavioral transtheoretical chronic pain model\nlier, empirical studies have documented the effect of differ-\nent types of SCCPP response to chronic pain patients and\nhow such responses affect the pain behavior and functioning.\nHowever, these studies have focused primarily on the adjust-\nment of the chronic pain patients and far less on SCCPP\nadjustment. The various aspects of responses include solici-\ntous, distracting, negative, and punishing spousal responses\nRomano, Jensen, Good, & Hops, 2000). Specifically, spousal\nsolicitous behaviors and distracting responses have resulted\nin negative outcomes among chronic pain patients, namely,\nincreased pain behaviors, increased pain-related functional\nlimitations, and decreased activity (Cano et al, 2004.; Raichle\nspouses have similar negative effects on chronic pain\npatients. Specifically, it has been reported that chronic pain\npatients who receive negative responses from SCCPP may\nperceive the SCCPP to be angry or frustrated with them\n(Cano, Weisberg, & Gallagher, 2000). This in turn leads to\ndecreased activity among the patients and increased reported\naffective distress or depression in chronic pain patients and\nSCCPP (Cano, Gillis, Heinz, Geisser, & Foran, 2004; Faucett\nInterestingly, negative responses in relation to increased\naffective distress of patients were buffered by a globally sat-\nisfying relationship while depression was reported among\nchronic pain patients if negative responses from SCCPP\noccurred within a globally dissatisfying relationship\n(Goldberg, Kerns, & Rosenberg, 1993; Kerns,\nHaythornthwaite, Southwick, & Giller, 1990). A punishing\nresponse by SCCPP, however, was positively correlated with\nchronic pain patients' activity. In addition, spouses who\nattributed their partner's pain to emotional causes have been\nfound to give more punishing responses, possibly due to\ndecreased sympathy for the pain condition (Cano et al.,\n2009). The impact of the specific chronic pain behaviors\nmanifested by the chronic pain patients on the SCCPP, how-\never, is not well researched.\nAdditional evidence providing support for the role of\nsocial and family support and functioning in the adjust-\nment process is found in the broader caregiving literature\nbut less so within the chronic pain caregiver adjustment\nliterature. Family support was associated with higher\ndyadic adjustment among spouses and patients with trau-\nmatic brain injuries (Moore, Stambrook, Peters, &\nLubusko, 1991). Other findings have indicated that social\nsupport is associated with lower perceived burden and bet-\nter quality of life and moderates family functioning as well\nas caregivers' distress, well-being, and adjustment\nErgh, Rapport, Coleman, & Hanks, 2002; Harris, Godfrey,\nMercurio-Riley et al. 9\nResearch concerning how family dynamics, pain behav-\niors of patients, and the different types of social support (e.g.,\nformal, informal, respite care) affect caregivers is lacking in\nthe chronic pain literature. As noted in the chronic illness\nliterature, those are important factors that may influence\ncaregivers' adjustment. Capitolo (1998) studied the effect of\nfamily variables on SCCPP adjustment to chronic pain\npatients and found that disengaged and rigid family systems,\nas well as spousal negative response to pain behavior, were\nassociated with depression among SCCPP. In addition, there\nmay be other environmental factors that may affect caregiv-\ners' adjustment, including accessibility, availability, and\naffordability of health care.\nSummary of Relationships Among Variables\nThe proposed framework depicted in Figure 1 is based on the\nthree risk constructs and three resistance constructs guided\nby Wallander's empirically supported model associated with\nthe psychosocial adjustment of caregivers of individuals\nwith health-related chronic conditions, with added specific-\nity to the factors in each of the six constructs in relation to\nadjustment outcomes among SCCPP.\nThe three risk and three resistance constructs included in\nthis conceptual framework each contribute directly to the\nnegative and buffering effects on SCCPP adjustment, respec-\ntively, as shown in each of the lines connecting each of the\nsix constructs to the outcome construct. Within the three\nresistance constructs, the socioecological construct relates to\nthe intrapersonal construct as well as the stress processing\nconstruct. Second, the availability of support is associated\nwith the perception of stress and how one feels about his or\nher control over the adverse situation (unidirectional). Third,\nthe intrapersonal and the stress processing constructs, how-\never, can operate in both directions. Fourth, the stress pro-\ncessing and the intrapersonal constructs, which are relatively\nstable characteristics of a person, would not affect an indi-\nvidual's environmental resources.\nWithin the three risk constructs, the disability construct\nrelates to the functional dependence as well as the psycho-\nlogical stress constructs, and the stress construct also relates\nto the functional dependence construct. Furthermore, all\nthree risk constructs represented in the far left column have\nbeen shown to be mediated and/or moderated by either one\nor a combination of the resistance constructs shown in the\nmiddle column.\nSeveral additional trends in the literature were observed\nin which the relationships among certain variables were less\nconclusive. First, chronic pain's resultant functional limita-\ntions and dependence, rather than the chronic pain condition\nitself, appears to have the strongest impact on SCCPP adjust-\nment. While ample literature in the general caregiving field\nsupports the influence of the stress processing construct of\nperceived burden and stress on caregiver adjustment, this has\nnot been adequately studied and documented in the SCCPP\nadjustment literature, especially the duality of the caregiving\nrole. In addition, the role of coping--by SCCPP and the\nchronic pain patients--and SCCPP role strain warrant fur-\nther study and evidence to support its effect on SCCPP\nadjustment. In terms of the intrapersonal construct, self-effi-\ncacy, locus of control, and, to some degree, personality have\nbeen shown to have a relationship to SCCPP adjustment.\nSCCPP's understanding, knowledge, and acceptance of the\npatient's pain need further examination to explore its impact\non SCCPP adjustment.\nWith regard to the socioecological construct, numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effect of negative responses\nfrom SCCPP on the pain behaviors of the chronic pain\npatients (e.g., McCracken & Eccleston, 2005; Romano et al.,\n2000). However, how this process affects SCCPP remains\nunanswered. Research on the specific types and functions of\nformal and informal social support systems that are effective\nfor SCCPP and chronic pain patients is lacking. In addition,\nwhile there is some evidence for the relationship between\nfamily functioning and caregiver adjustment, this area needs\nto be explored further with regard to its application to the\nadjustment of chronic pain patients and SCCPP.\nLimitations\nWe acknowledge several limitations in this developing\nframework. Specifically, some of the particular pain-related\nvariables drawn from the literature may show a correlational\ninstead of a causal relationship to the adjustment of SCCPP.\nThis is in part due to the paucity of current literature on the\ntopic as well as a lack of research design sophistication in the\nstudies that do exist.\nIn addition, the framework discussed in this article repre-\nsents a conceptual, not an empirically validated, path model\nof the relationships among all the risk and resistance con-\nstructs. Therefore, although such a working framework for\nSCCPP adjustment provides some conceptual insights into\nand awareness of how different constructs are related to\neach other and/or may interact with each other in affecting\nthe adjustment of SCCPP, this framework lacks the empiri-\ncal support to clearly delineate the specific strengths of the\nmediating and moderating effects among those constructs.\nThis lacking can be attributed to methodological inade-\nquacy. Specifically, there are limited empirical studies that\ndemonstrate the relationships among constructs, and meth-\nodological design may not allow reasonable hypotheses to\nbe set and tested on the overall model of adjustment. These\nvariables may not allow a complex model to be tested simul-\ntaneously using a strong data analysis methodology. In the\nrisk and resistance variables where no evidence in the\nchronic pain literature exists, evidence will be drawn from\nother caregiving adjustment literature to demonstrate the\nimportance of incorporating and testing those variables with\nthe chronic pain population. In addition, the factors under\neach of the constructs are not exhaustive. For instance,\ncertain demographic factors such as gender, age, ethnicity,\nincome, and education level are excluded in the current\nframework. Other personal and developmental caregiver\nfactors including history of mental illness, substance abuse,\nchildhood trauma, and family upbringing are not included.\nThis does not suggest that those personal factors or other\ndevelopmental factors are not important, but such factors\nmay not fit into the three risk and resistance factors that are\npostulated within the framework of the Wallander et al.'s\nmodel.\nApplications of Research and Practice\nThe current framework represents a conceptual model of\nthe relationships among all the risk and resistance con-\nstructs and provides some conceptual insights into and\nawareness of how these constructs are related and/or may\ninteract with each other in affecting the adjustment of\nSCCPP. We anticipate refining the broader constructs and\nfactors comprising these risk and resistance constructs as\nadditional evidence emerges. Due to the fact that few stud-\nies exist with vigorous research design and an adequate\nsample size, as well as the likelihood of their exclusion of\nsome other potential important variables (e.g., health care\naccessibility, demographic variables), a perfect picture\nbecomes difficult to present. In addition, based on the\nresults of some of the chronic pain literature, the various\nrisks and resistance constructs appear to have a mediating\nor moderating effect on each other, rather than a direct rela-\ntionship with all risk and resistance constructs pointing sin-\ngly and directly to the outcomes. However, our intention is\nto begin this conversation to advocate for evidence-based\nstudies to demonstrate important constructs and factors that\naffect SCCPP adjustment. Other constructs and factors that\nwe may not have included (e.g., health care availability,\ndemographic factors) may also be important variables that\naffect caregiver adjustment among the chronic pain popula-\ntion. Those variables may need to be studied and added to\nthis working framework.\nWith vigorous methodological design, empirical evi-\ndence among the factors and constructs of each area can be\nused to test a larger path model or structural equation model\nin which all variables can be tested simultaneously for their\ninteraction and latent effects. The accumulation of evidence\nin supporting each of the constructs, therefore, can help in\nbuilding the broader picture of the adjustment of SCCPP.\nFinally, this conceptual framework can be used clinically to\nhelp SCCPP understand the potential factors that may put\nthem at risk and resistance factors that may protect them\nfrom distress when providing care to their spouses with a\nchronic pain condition. This conceptual framework may\nalso provide insights into the types of interventions that will\nhelp the chronic pain patient as well as the SCCPP in adjust-\nment, positive mental health, quality of life, and marital\nsatisfaction.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhern, D.
