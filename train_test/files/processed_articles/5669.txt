This non-verbal mode is possibly rooted firmly in\nour human evolutionary heritage, and as such, some scientists argue that it serves as a\nfundamental assessment and expression tool for our inner qualities. Studies of nonverbal\ncommunication have established that a universal, culture-free, non-verbal sign system\nexists, that is available to all individuals for negotiating social encounters. Thus, it is not\nonly the kind of gestures and expressions humans use in social communication, but also the\nway these movements are performed, as this seems to convey key information about an\nindividual's quality. Dance, for example, is a special form of movement, which can be\nobserved in human courtship displays. Recent research suggests that people are sensitive to\nthe variation in dance movements, and that dance performance provides information about\nan individual's mate quality in terms of health and strength. This article reviews the role of\nbody movement in human non-verbal communication, and highlights its significance in\nhuman mate preferences in order to promote future work in this research area within the\nevolutionary psychology framework.\n",

Shanker and King (2002) described communication as a dynamic rather\nthan a static process. This means that a signal is decoded by a receiver, who adds\ninformation to the signal, and then decodes its meaning. One particular process in\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\ncommunication is to send and receive wordless messages. This kind of information\ntransmission is commonly referred to as \"nonverbal communication\" (NVC). Nonverbal\nsignals include facial expressions, bodily orientation, movements, posture, vocal cues (other\nthan words), eye gaze, physical appearance, interpersonal spacing, and touching (Bull,\n2001; DePaulo, 1992). As such, they support and moderate speech, facilitate the expression\nof emotions, help communicating people's attitudes, convey information about personality,\nand thus negotiate interpersonal relationships, even in the form of rituals (Bull, 2001;\nIn humans, many signals, such as facial expressions of emotion, are thought to be\ncultural universals (Ekman and Friesen, 1971; Ekman et al., 1987), although a closer look\nreveals that there is still variability in these signals (Grammer et al., 1988). Because\nnonverbal behavior conveys emotions, these cues are sometimes referred to as \"nonverbal\nexpressive behaviors\" that can be used in self-presentation (DePaulo, 1992). NVC can also\ncomprise a set of so called \"honest\" signals since it is rather difficult for an individual to\nsuppress them, and make them more readily accessible to others (DePaulo, 1992). Thus,\nthere seems to be some kernel of truth in the proverb that \"actions speak louder than words\"\n(Argyle, Salter, Nicholson, Williams, and Burgess, 1970; Argyle, Alkema and Gilmour,\n1972; Bull, 2001). Most of the studies on human NVC research have investigated certain\ntypes of body movements such as gestures (Bull and Connelly, 1985; Goldin-Meadow,\nto better understand the complexity of human social encounters.\nSome support on the significance of NVC in social life comes from studies that have\ninvestigated non-verbal cues in human courtship situations. In these studies, first encounters\nof opposite-sex strangers were covertly filmed in \"unstaged interaction\" to investigate\nstrangers meet for the first time, they both face the risk of being deceived. Neither opponent\nis aware of the other's intention, thus both have to rely heavily on non-verbal cues.\nGrammer (1990) reported that, in such a situation, there is a remarkable consistency in the\nrepertoire of female solicitation behaviors in the presence of a male stranger, including eye-\ncontact, followed by looking away, special postures, ways of walking, and so on (see also\nfound to approach women who expressed high rates of signaling these behaviors more\nfrequently. In later study, Grammer et al. (1999) found that some information about female\ninterest is not only inherent in the number of certain non-verbal signals, but is also encoded\nin the quality of body movements, such as their amplitude and speed. For example, women\nmoved more frequently, but also displayed smaller and slower movements when they were\ninterested in a man. Men in turn reacted to the quality of these movements positively and\njudged the situation to be more pleasant.\nBased on these findings, researchers have begun to emphasize that it is not only the\ntype of gesture or posture that are important in courtship situations, but rather the ways in\nwhich such displays are carried out. More recent findings further support this by showing\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nthat the attractiveness perception of human dance correlates with aspects of an individual's\nmate quality (Brown et al., 2005; Hugill, Fink, Neave, and Seydel, 2009). However, there is\nstill a dearth of research that highlights the relevance of body movement in human social\nperception compared to the large number of studies on static cues (i.e., studies on face and\nbody morphology) that have been put forward primarily through the expanding field of\nevolutionary psychology. This is surprising, given that an inspection of the literature reveals\na considerable number of studies that could be used to stimulate the academic discussion\nand research on the importance of body movement, also within the framework of sexual\nselection.\nThus, we consider it timely to review some of the key findings on the topic of\nhuman body movement and its relation to mate selection. Firstly, we summarize some\nconsolidated findings on motion perception, in order to show which kinds of information\nhumans can perceive out of body movement. Secondly, we outline knowledge about the\nbiological relevance of such sources of information for human social life. Bearing in mind\nsuch information, we emphasize the importance of body movements in human mate choice\nand discuss recent attempts to define its signaling value. Finally, we present some\nconclusions and issues for further research.\nPerception of human body movement\nFrom the biological perspective it is of paramount importance for the survival of an\norganism to decode information based upon the perception of other organisms' movements\n(Johansson, von Hofsten and Jansson, 1980; Pavlova, Kr\u00e4geloh-Mann, Birbaumer, and\nhumans as highly social creatures are no exception, as they almost constantly gather\ninformation about peoples' gestures and expressions in order to derive information about\nbook The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animal that one can use dynamic rather than\nstatic cues when it comes to an understanding of what others are doing. Consider the variety\nof natural situations in which form cues are corrupted through dim lighting conditions or\nocclusions. In these situations, the ability to perceive useful visual information is based\npredominantly on the motion patterns of an organism (Grossmann and Blake, 1999; Pavlova\net al., 2002). Similar scenarios apply to everyday situations. For example, the gait of a\nperson has the advantage of primacy in impression formation, since it is often the first cue\nthat is perceived when a stranger approaches, especially when from a distance (Montepare\nand Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988). Humans focus on movement characteristics to collect\nsocially relevant information about others, and it is a scientific challenge to understand the\nform and function of these cues (see also Blake and Shiffrar, 2007).\nPoint-light-displays and early work\nOne of the most prominent attempts to understand the signaling qualities of body\nmovement is the work of Johansson (1973, 1976). He illustrated through the use of simple\npoint light (PL) displays, that an observer receives a vivid impression of a person`s\nmovements from the placement of 10-12 lights placed on the major joints of the body\n(knees, ankles, elbows etc.). Such strong impressions are reported despite the lack of\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nimportant morphological features, such as facial features, skin, or hair (e.g., Barclay,\nCutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Bertenthal and Pinto, 1994), and within extremely short\npresentation times of fewer than 200 milliseconds (Johansson, 1976). When observers view\nthe dot presentations in a static format then the set of elements is never interpreted as a\nrecognition. These early studies indicated that humans are sensitive to biological motion,\neven when confronted with limited information such as the PL's (Stevenage, Nixon and\nJohansson's method appeared to be powerful in the assessment of human body\nmovement and has stimulated other researchers (and still does). For example, Mather and\nWest (1993) used the PL technique to demonstrate that humans could also identify animals,\nsuch as goats, baboons, camels, horses and other vertebrates on the basis of motion cues.\nSimilar perception tasks have been conducted with cats, pigeons, chicks, and non-human\nprimates as \"perceivers\", all of which could discriminate biological motion (Blake, 1993;\nRegolin, Tommasi, and Vallortigara, 2000; Vallortigara, Regolin and Marconato, 2005;\nOram and Perrett, 1994). Other studies showed that human infants are predisposed to\nselectively attend to biological motion (Fox and McDaniel, 1982; Moore, Goodwin,\nPavlova, Kr\u00e4geloh-Mann, Birbaumer, and Sokolov, 2001; Piotrowski, Jakobson and Troje,\n2007). For example, Simion, Regolin and Bulf (2008) revealed that two-day old infants\ncould discriminate between point-light animations depicting biological motion from those\nshowing random motion patterns. The same infants selectively preferred to view displays\ncontaining biological motion, especially when depicted in a true (upright) form. Similarly,\nKuhlmeier, Troje and Lee (in press) report that six-month old infants can even discriminate\nbetween leftward and rightward motion from point-light walkers.\nSuch findings demonstrate that the detection of biological motion is an innate\ncapacity of the visual system, and is thus according to Simion et al. (2008) \"...part of an\nevolutionarily ancient and non-species-specific system predisposing animals to\npreferentially attend to other animals\".\nSocial perception of motion\nHumans can quickly gather visual information from the gait of a counterpart. Such\nperceptions are adaptive in the sense that they allow people to successfully interact within\ntheir social environment (Zebrowitz-McArthur and Baron, 1983). Studies on the perception\nof PL displays revealed that humans derive a wide range of socially relevant characteristics\nfrom human gait patterns (e.g., Barclay, Cutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Cutting and\nKozlowski, 1977; Kozlowski and Cutting, 1977). For example, observers were able to\ndetermine the action a person performs just on the basis of such highly degraded depictions\nare also able to decode information about an individual's age (e.g., Montepare and\nZebrowitz-McArthur, 1988), identity (e.g., Cutting and Kozlowski, 1977; Hill and Pollick,\nWesthoff, and Lavrov, 2005; Westhoff and Troje, 2007), sex (e.g., Kozlowski and Cutting,\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nsexual orientation (Ambady, Hallahan, and Conner, 1999) from PL displays alone.\nMoreover, observers could identify certain psychological properties from these gait stimuli,\nsuch as an individual's emotional condition (Atkinson, Dittrich, Gemmell, and Young,\n2004; Brownlow, Dixon, Egbert, and Radcliff, 1997; Clarke, Bradshaw, Field, Hampson,\nof an action (Barrett, Todd, Miller, and Blythe, 2005), the intent to deceive (Runeson and\nFrykholm, 1983), and existing alterations of gross motor activity, locomotion, and gait\nperformance which indicate depression (Lemke, Wendorff, Mieth, Buhl, and Linnemann,\n2000; Sloman, Berridge, Homatidis, Hunter, and Duck, 1982). In addition, it is possible to\ndetermine the body size of a walker (Jokisch and Troje, 2003; Troje, 2003), the weight of a\nbox carried by a person (Runeson and Frykholm, 1983), and even the quality of an\nindividual's dancing ability (Brown et al., 2005) based on motion cues alone. Individuals\ncan also identify their own body movements with a fair degree of accuracy, and even detect\ntheir friends from PL displays (Loula et al., 2005).\nWhile the previous paragraphs provide an impressive list of human perceptual\nprocessing from limited information, there is still much to discover about how the\nperceptual system actually extracts all of this information from motion cues alone (Todd,\n1983). Some attempts to understand the nature of this task come from studies of gender\nrecognition from gait. For example, Kozlowski and Cutting (1977) introduced a number of\nmanipulations in computer animations of artificial women such as the amount of arm swing,\nwalking speed, and occlusion of body parts. However, these authors found a significant\neffect only for speed of movement manipulations, such that faster walkers were categorized\nas females. In follow-up work, Cutting, Proffitt, and Kozlowski (1978) and Cutting (1981)\nshowed that signals derived from the shoulder and hip region of a walker are of primary\nimportance for gender discrimination. Results from lateral comparisons of male and female\nbody movements conducted by Murray and colleagues (Murray, 1967; Murray, Drought,\nand Kory, 1964; Murray, Kory, and Sepic, 1970) revealed that lateral hip and shoulder\nrotations are comparable for both sexes and that the amount of upper body sway was greater\nin male subjects.\nCutting and colleagues suggested that gender identification might be achieved\nindirectly through the determination of a biomechanical invariant referred to as the \"center\nof moment\" (Cm\n) of a walker (Barclay, Cutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Cutting, Profitt and\ncan be estimated from the widths of the shoulders\nand the hips. Thus, the Cm\nis higher in females than in males, since the shoulders of males\nare wider than the hips and vice versa in females (Cutting and Proffitt, 1981; Cutting,\nProffitt and Kozlowski, 1978). While these studies emphasize the importance of movements\nof a walker's upper body (hips and shoulders) for gender recognition, other studies suggest\nthat the motion of one's lower body (i.e., the legs) provides essential gender information\ngeometrical and inertial differences are responsible for gender-specific kinematic patterns\nand may thus also facilitate gender recognition. In support, Mather and Murdoch (1994)\nfound that naive observers could identify the gender of an actor very reliably when the\ndisplay contained gender-specific lateral body sway. In their experiments, this motion cue\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\ndominates the structural cue based on torso shape (Cm\n).\nMore recently, Troje (2002) made a promising attempt to resolve the problem of\ngender recognition from motion displays. He decomposed motion capture data of men and\nwomen, and projected them into a mathematical space. In this space he applied established\nmethods from linear statistics and pattern recognition to search for axes that best represent\nthe differences between male and female walkers. As Troje (2003) argued, the results\nsupported the well-known prototypes: an extreme male walker showed the gait of a hero in\na classical western movie with a straddle-legged posture, the elbows are held away from the\nbody, and the wide shoulders are performing a lateral body sway. In contrast, a feminine\nwalker appears rather slim, the elbows are held close to the body and the upper body shows\nonly little lateral motion, but there is a significant rotation of the hips. Moreover, it seems\nthat these gender typical movement patterns are present already in infants and becomes\nmore pronounced during adolescence (K\u00f6nig, Sch\u00f6lmerich and Troje, 2008).\nIn summary, human movement patterns visually communicate social cues to which\nother humans are exquisitely sensitive and gender identification seems to be one of the most\nobvious signals that can be derived from movement. However, it is likely that there is more\ninformation encoded about an individual than just whether an individual is male or female.\nWith reference to the quality of movement, it is likely that although there is variation on\nmale and female body movement the differences between the sexes are probably greater\nthan within sex, but opposite sex people might also be sensitive to the variation within\nindividuals of one sex. It is this within-sex variation that interests evolutionary\npsychologists in terms of what they have recently been trying to link to an individual's mate\nquality.\nBody movement in human attractiveness research\nEvolutionary psychologists argue that in humans, like in other animals, sexually\nselected physical characteristics all pertain to health, thereby suggesting that humans have\nevolved to view certain features as attractive and preferable. In this view, human mate\nselection criteria have evolved through human evolutionary history and shape our\nperception of attractiveness and beauty (Buss, 1989; Gangestad and Scheyd 2005; Rhodes,\nSimmons and Peters, 2005). Human socio-sexual encounters are undoubtedly complex, but\nthere is now a wealth of evidence to suggest that human mate preferences can be\nconceptualized within the sexual selection framework and that the principal mechanisms of\nmate selection are remarkably universal across cultures (Buss, 1985; Buss and Barnes,\nA key problem for assessing possible relationships between physical features and\nhuman mate preferences has been the ecological validity of the stimuli used. Typically,\nstudies utilize static two-dimensional (2D) stimuli, i.e., facial and/or bodily photographs\n(see for review Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzm\u00fcller, and Fink, 2003). In real-life mating\nsituations it is likely that individuals are moving and base their mate preference assessment\n(at least initially) on multiple motion and behavioral cues (Rubenstein, 2005).\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nViewpoint dependency and presentation mode\nPerceiving physical attractiveness from static images of female or male forms seems\nto differ from those of moving bodies by changing viewpoint-dependant perceptions of\nshape. In a meta-analysis, Langlois et al. (2000) reported that studies in attractiveness\nresearch used different kinds of stimulus presentation modes (photographic images, video\nmovies and in situ encounters), and these different modes might convey different types of\ninformation, which may subsequently lead to different attractiveness ratings. In support of\nthis, some researchers also showed that moving stimuli were judged differently on\nattractiveness compared to static stimuli (Knappmeyer et al., 2002; Lander, Christie and\nFor example, men's preference for a woman's slim waistline (as indexed via the\nwaist-to-hip ratio, WHR; Singh, 2002, 2006) was demonstrated only with still images.\nHowever, bodies in motion are dynamic sources of information, and this may have an effect\nalso on the perception of cues such as the WHR. Doyle (2009) reported a peak shift effect\nin the attractiveness perception of WHR when women were moving. He argues that while\nwalking, motion of the waist and hips results in continuously alternate left and right side\nWHR that are perceived as highly attractive. Modeling this in a female model with a WHR\nof 0.70 results in left and right side WHRs that are even smaller than 0.70, which are then\nperceived as \"supernormal\" (Doyle, 2009). Likewise, O\u00b4Toole, Edelman, and B\u00fclthoff\n(1998) demonstrated the existence of a stimulus-specific effect in face recognition over\nviewpoint changes. Therefore, it could be that in human social encounters the dynamics of\nthe face and body provide additional three-dimensional (3D) \"representations\" (Bloj,\nKersten and Hurlbert, 1999; Knappmeyer et al., 2002), which affect their perception. In real\nlife situations the face and the body of a person are almost constantly in motion, thus the\nperceptions of moving faces and/or bodies could differ from those of static representations\n(Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzm\u00fcller, and Fink, 2003).\nComparative psychology of body movement\nThe late American modernist poet Charles Olson once stated that \"Men, everywhere,\ndance\", and \"There are no human societies in which they do not\", which leads evolutionary\npsychologists and anthropologists to the question about the origin of dance in humans, and\nthe cultural universality of signals derived from biological motion. Darwin (1871) himself\nsuggested that dance is a sexually selected courtship signal that is related to the quality of\nthe dancer. This assertion can be regarded as one of Darwin's seminal insights into the\nevolutionary mechanisms of behavior in man and animals, given the evidence that dance is\nan important signal in mate choice in a variety of animals, including humans. Based on\nDarwin's observations of birds, Ellis (1976) provided an evolutionary explanation for\nprimitive human dance and the \"love dances\" in many animals. He claimed that the origins\nof human dance date back even longer than the origins of modern man, and are thus firmly\nrooted in human evolutionary history. Hence, in search of an evolutionary origin of body\nmovement as a courtship signal it seems worthwhile to consider comparative aspects with\nexamples also from the animal kingdom.\nCourtship dances are observed in many bird species, such as zebra finches\n(Taeniopygia guttata) (Williams, 2001), satin bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus)\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\n(Coleman, Patricelli and Borgia, 2004; Patricelli, Uy and Borgia, 2003), duetting thrushes\n(Cichladusa guttata) (Todt and Fiebelkorn, 1980), and manikins (Chiroxiphia linearis)\n(Trainer and McDonald, 1993). These behavioral displays include movements of the body,\nthe head, and the beak, but also find their expression in singing, specific postures, plumage\nerection and flight performances (Williams, 2001). They are part of a complex courtship\ndisplay, which were ultimately designed to attract potential mates. Even female fruit flies\n(Drosophila subobscura) choose males on the basis of their ability to dance, which is\ninterpreted as a signal of their neuromuscular condition (Maynard-Smith, 1956). Likewise,\nRowland (1995) reported that female sticklebacks prefer males with high swimming speed.\nMany male spiders, especially the funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis aperta), and several\njumping spiders (Salticidae), have developed elaborate courtship dances, e.g., lateral\nswaying of the abdomen and flexing the web, to entice females to mate (Clark and Morjan,\nsway their abdomens with a higher frequency, than unsuccessful males during courtship\nThe evolutionary origin of dance in human courtship may be perhaps less well\nunderstood through the comparative account of similar patterns in birds or spiders.\nHowever, it is possible that it stems from the courtship displays of non-human primates, as\nour closest relatives in evolutionary genealogy (Sheets-Johnstone, 2005). Among primates,\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) move their bodies or heads in courtship displays, aggressive\nand frustration behavior (Goodall, 1968). The \"bipedal swagger\" is a typical behavioral\ndisplay in male chimpanzees, which occurs only rarely in females, and is an important part\nof courtship display (Goodall, 1968). During this display the male chimpanzee approaches\nthe female, sits or stands, and extends his hands, lightly touching and then releasing his\nhead, shoulder, back or knee. His body slowly moves forward and backward and from side\nto side (Kano, 1992). Kuroda (1984) observed that during courtship females often do not\nreceive any visual sign other than the rocking gestures. These examples of motion as a\ncourtship signal in our closest relatives can possibly give some information about the origin\nof dance in human male courtship rather than the examples about the \"love-dances\" of male\nspiders and birds. Sheets-Johnstone (2005) therefore assumes that dance in men has some\nevolutionary roots.\nHuman dance is unique in its style, and is likely related to bipedalism. Bipedalism\nfacilitates a greater range of movement possibilities than is observed in quadrupeds. Thus, it\nseems to be essential for the creative dynamics that constitute the art of dance in humans, as\nthe torso can twist and bend, the head can swivel, and the arms can swing in many\ndirections (Sheets-Johnstone, 2005). To this day, few studies have been concerned with how\nhumans use body movements such as dancing, for attracting mates. Early accounts were\nmainly based on ethnographic studies (Kurath, 1960). Later, Kaeppler (1978) provided an\nanthropological account of dance by emphasizing that dance is an activity dating back to\nprehistoric times that is displayed in rituals as a form of social communication, but also in\ncourtship activity. Hanna (1987a) discussed the importance of dance in courtship rituals\namongst humans in several societies, including the Acholi in Uganda (p\u00b4Bitek, 1966), a\ntribe on Mangaia, a southern Cook Island in central Polynesia, and the Medlpa in New\nGuinea (Hanna, 1995; Pitcairn and Schleidt, 1976). From the Acholi in Uganda, p\u00b4Bitek\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\n(1966) reported that women discriminate between men on the basis of the vigor and\nendurance of their dance performance. In India and Morocco, Nevinson (1931) observed\nsolitary dances that are performed to give pleasure to the opposite sex encounter.\nFurthermore, there are some European courtship dances such as the Basque \"arresku\", the\nNorwegian \"halling\" and the Ukrainian \"hopak\", in which men show off their physical\nprowess. In most societies, not only men dance to attract women, but also women express\nthemselves through dance in order to receive attention from men.\nWith reference to evolutionary psychology, Hanna (1987b) points out that dance\nmay be an adaptive behavioral pattern in sexual selection, as it is a medium, which displays\nbeauty, health, strength, and thus sexual attractiveness. It is possible, that the disposition to\ndance facilitates human mate selection, though the variation in dance patterns and styles is\ncertainly mediated by culture (Boas, 1944; Hanna, 1987a). However, this view is not\nuncontroversial, and some researchers have argued against the hypothesis that dance is\nsexually selected. For example, Hagen and Bryant (2003) suggest that dance has evolved as\na coalition signaling system, which communicates coalition quality and thus signals\ncooperative behavior. However, these authors also admit that some mate qualities such as\nhealth, nutrition, proper development, endurance, and creativity are signaled via dance\nperformances \u00ad and could facilitate the formation of coalitions with members of the\nopposite sex.\nThe quality of body movement\nMost of the findings in studies on non-verbal behavior in human courtship were\nobtained with the \"repertoire analysis method\" (Grammer 1990; Grammer, Kruck, Juette,\napproach via pure observation on the basis of operationally defined behavior categories has\nseveral limitations. Categories are sometimes difficult to identify and the definition of some\nof them depend on the investigators (subjective) perception. Moreover, behavior categories\ncan only give an approximation to how a receiver processes the information. Grammer,\nFieder and Filova (1997) and Grammer et al. (1999) found that some information about a\nwomen's courtship behavior is not only inherent in the frequencies of certain postures or\ngestures, but also encoded in the quality of body movements. They showed that women\nmoved more frequently and displayed smaller and slower movements when they were\ninterested in a man. Men in turn reacted to the quality of these movements positively, and\njudged the situation to be more pleasant. Consequently, the quality of body movement\ndisplays could be meaningful in courtship (Grammer, Fink and Renninger, 2002).\nAside from these studies, which give rise to the assertion that the quality of body\nmovement is an important aspect of courtship behavior in humans, there have been only few\nattempts to actually quantify its signaling value. Some studies demonstrated that certain\nmovements were perceived as being more attractive than others (Grammer, Kiel, Striebel,\nAtzm\u00fcller, and Fink, 2003; Fink, Seydel, Manning, and Kappeler, 2007; Knappmeyer et al.,\nAtzm\u00fcller, and Fink (2003) found an association between motion quality and the\nattractiveness ratings of dance movements. Men and women demonstrating a bigger sweep\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nin movements were judged as more attractive. In addition, men judged women as more\nattractive, the slower and less complex their body movements were. However, Grammer,\nKiel, Striebel, Atzm\u00fcller, and Fink (2003) noted some limitation of their study in that they\nused movement descriptors which were based on motion history detection, and thus might\nnot exactly capture the features people use when making judgments about the attractiveness\nof body movements.\nTroje (2003) again used a PL stimuli approach to investigate the sex-typicality of an\nattractive gait. He found that women rated as being highly attractive by men, placed their\nfeet almost on a straight line whilst walking, thus displaying the typical \"cat walk\". Johnson\nand Tassinary (2005) displayed human walkers varying in terms of shoulder and hip sway.\nObservers focused their attention on the waist and hip regions of the body in order to\nidentify the gender of the walker (i.e., masculine or feminine) and then the sex of the\nwalker. Johnson, Gill, Reichman, and Tassinary, (2007) extended this research to\ndemonstrate that observers identified the sexual orientation of computer-generated\nanimations using assessments of body shape (primarily for women) and body shape and\nmovement (for both males and females). Gender-atypical body movement had a strong\neffect on perceived sexual orientation and also influenced the accuracy of the judgments.\nUsing motion-capture-technology, Provost, Troje and Quinsey (2008) showed a\ncontextually dependent shift in the female preference for sex-specific gait patterns in men.\nIn these experiments, women rated \"masculine\" walking men as more attractive, especially\nwhen they were in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle and more open to short-term\nmating opportunities. Further characteristics, which are inherently signaled via gait, are the\nage and height of a walker. Both measures are known to serve as initial criteria in human\nmate selection (e.g., Buss, 1989; Kenrick and Keefe, 1992) that could also be conveyed\nthrough body movement. While evolutionary psychologists argue that men have evolved\npreferences for youth in females, as this is linked to fertility and health, women place more\nemphasis on signs of male status. In this context, Schmitt and Atzwanger (1995) suggest a\nsex-specific association between pace and status in men. These authors found that men with\nhigher status walked faster, whereas the pace of women was independent of their status.\nFurthermore these findings were not affected by proximate factors such as age, body height,\nnext destination, and number of dates.\nOne central question in human attractiveness research is whether body movement\nsignals information about an individual's mate quality, and how strong such cues are in\nrelation to those of the face and body. If dance, for example, is a sexually selected trait, it\nshould reflect the genetic or phenotypic quality of the dancer.\nBody movement and correlates of physical condition\nSymmetry\nThe term \"developmental stability\" is used to refer to the capacity of the individual\nto develop a symmetrical phenotype, thus resisting developmental perturbations caused by\n\"stress\", such as from disease, parasitism, or sex steroids (Livshits and Kobyliansky, 1991;\nThornhill and M\u00f8ller, 1997). These developmental challenges lead to small deviations in\nbilateral symmetry in morphological features and are usually referred to as fluctuating\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nasymmetry (FA). There is some evidence for the assertion that movement reflects\ndevelopmental stability (as measured via FA), from studies of both humans (Manning and\nexample, Manning and Ockenden (1994) showed that FA in racehorses was a predictor of\ntheir performance. Manning and Pickup (1998) reported that male middle-distance runners\nwith less body FA were ranked higher within their sport. More recently, Brown et al. (2005)\nfound positive correlations between FA and the perception of dancing ability in a rural\nJamaican sample of men and women. Similarly, Sadr, Troje, and Nakayama (2006)\ncollected attractiveness ratings for motion-captured women, displayed as point-light\nwalkers, and found that an increase of body symmetry was positively associated with\nperceived attractiveness of the walkers.\nHowever, as Brown et al. (2005) noted, body symmetry is probably not the only\ncorrelate of variation in movement quality and may be moderated by a number of additional\nfactors such as neuromuscular coordination, or health, including freedom from parasites.\nMoreover, they argued that attractive dances may be particularly difficult to perform, more\nrhythmic, more energetic, and more energy efficient (see also Grammer et al., 2003b;\nSex steroids\nOne moderator between body symmetry and quality of movement could be gonadal\nsex steroids, such as testosterone (T) and estrogen (E). While asymmetries in movement\nmay be readily observed as they are determined by skeletal and muscular structures, body\nmovement may also indicate transient conditions of an individual, such as physiological\nstates (Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzm\u00fcller, and Fink, 2003). Since the 1950's, many top-\nclass athletes in various sporting disciplines routinely used exogenous T to improve their\nperformance (Fitch, 2008; Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004). Supra-physiological doses of T\nsynthesize body protein, which results in an increase of muscle mass and physical strength,\neven without exercise (Bhasin et al., 1996; Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004). In some sports,\nathletes reported that their intake of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS's) was also\nassociated with a better recovery, a higher training load capacity and therefore an increase\nin physical and mental performances (Baume et al., 2006). Cardinale and Stone (2006)\nfound a positive correlation between circulating T levels and vertical jump performance in\nmen and women. However, Siegel et al. (2008), found no relationship between T levels and\nsequential movement performance in older and younger males.\nNormal movements are partly dependent upon the inter-connected subcortical nuclei\nreferred to as the \"basal ganglia\". The key structure is the striatum, and normal functioning\nwithin the basal ganglia is determined by the neurotransmitter dopamine (Albin, Young,\nand Penney, 1989). In animals and humans it has been demonstrated that the striatal\ndopaminergic system is modulated by estrogen. For example, fluctuations of estrogen\nduring the estrous cycle in rats are associated with motor performance, with better\nperformance being associated with estrogen peaks (Becker, Snyder, Miller, Westgate, and\nJenuwine, 1987). Studies on women have showed systematic variations in motor\nperformance throughout the menstrual cycle (Binkley, 1992; Chrisler and McCool, 1991;\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nGrammer, Fieder and Filova, 1997; Hampson and Kimura, 1988; Jennings, Janowsky, and\nand Kimura, 1998; Stenn and Klinge, 1972), though the results from these studies are partly\ninconclusive.\nMorris and Udry (1970) found that women were more active in walking or running\nactivities at the times of peak fertility compared to other stages of their menstrual cycle.\nHowever, an earlier study by Pierson and Lockhart (1963) found no significant changes in\nreaction time and speed of arm movement across the menstrual cycle. More recently,\nProvost, Quinsey, and Troje (2008) recorded the kinematics of the walking patterns of\nyoung women at different cycle stages and found that men judged the walking\nperformances of women in the luteal phase slightly higher on attractiveness than those of\nwomen in the follicular phase. These findings are puzzling in that they contrast previous\nreports on men's preferences for women's faces, which found that men rated women as\nmore attractive at times of peak fertility (Roberts et al., 2004). Here is need for further\ninvestigation before drawing a conclusion on whether static and active cues of women\nacross the menstrual cycle are perceived differently, or comprise a single ornament of mate\nquality that men are sensitive to.\nDigit ratio\nIn addition to the effects of circulating T, studies have shown that in men and\nwomen a low digit ratio (i.e., the relative length of index to ring finger; 2D:4D) - a proxy of\nprenatal T - is correlated with physical fitness and high ability in sports, such as skiing\n(Manning, 2002), football (Manning and Taylor, 2001), sprinting speed in boys (Manning\nand Hill, 2009), athletics (H\u00f6nekopp, Manning and M\u00fcller, 2006; Pokrywda, Rachon,\nSuchecka-Rachon, and Bitel, 2005), and physical strength (Fink, Seydel, Manning, and\nKappeler, 2006). Fink, Seydel, Manning, and Kappeler (2007) presented video clips of male\ndancers with low and high 2D:4D ratios to a sample of female judges, who rated them on\nperceived attractiveness, dominance, and masculinity. It was found that dances of men with\nlow (masculine) 2D:4D ratios were rated higher on all three attributes than the dances of\nmen with high (feminine) 2D:4D ratios. The authors concluded that even prenatal T has an\ninfluence on men's dancing abilities and women's perception of them.\nPhysical strength\nEvolutionary psychologists argue that women have developed certain cognitive\nadaptations to visually assess physical fitness, athletic abilities and thus competitiveness in\nmen, all of which are correlated with T, as mating with high quality males could increase\ntheir reproductive success. Studies on women's preferences for masculine male faces (Fink,\nNeave, and Seydel, 2007; Neave, Laing, Fink, and Manning, 2003; Swaddle and Reierson,\n2002) and bodies (Sell et al., 2009) support this assertion by suggesting that women possess\ncognitive abilities to assess \"formidability\" (i.e., fighting ability and resource-holding\npotential) and physical strength from male face and body morphology. Recent research by\nHugill et al. (2009) suggests that male physical strength is not only signaled via static\nrepresentations of the face and body, but also via active displays such as dance. In their\nstudy women perceived dances of men, who were physically stronger (i.e., those with\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nhigher hand-grip strength), as more attractive and assertive. Thus, it was concluded that the\nassociation of physical strength with dancing ability could be moderated by an effect of T,\nwhose production and metabolism mobilizes resources for the efforts of males to attract and\ncompete for mates (Ellison, 2001). These findings are in line with studies, which have\nshown that as in most sports, dance fitness depends on the ability to develop high levels of\nmuscle tension, i.e., muscle strength (Fitt, 1982; Koutedakis and Sharp, 1999), and that this\ntogether with agility, balance, and flexibility are positively associated with dance\nConclusion\nMate choice is arguably one of the most important decision-making task an\nindividual has to master during its reproductive life, as via appropriate choice, an individual\ncan ensure that its genes are passed on to offspring. By selecting a high-quality mate, the\nindividual can also ensure that shared genes will end up in healthy and fertile offspring\n(Gangestad and Thornhill, 1997). Evolutionary psychology theories of mate choice thus\nfocus on observable features (sexual cues) that are emitted by an individual, and which\nindicate valuable information about that individual's reproductive potential and quality.\nAlthough there is some consensus among evolutionary psychologists that evolutionary\nselection pressures have led to the development of certain physical characteristics and\npreferences for them, a number of open questions in attractiveness research remain. Most\nimportant, almost all studies on physical attraction have used static stimuli (images of faces\nand/or bodies). Little is known about the attractiveness of body movements, such as dance\nor gait, though both are presumably key signals in everyday life and social encounters. The\napparent sex difference in human body movement leads to the question whether movement\nalso signals aspects that are relevant for mate choice. Moreover, aside from the potential\nphysical qualities that are signaled through human motion, could there be also personality\ncharacteristics encoded in the way we walk and/or dance that finally affect attractiveness\nassessments and mate preferences?\nStudies indicate that humans use dynamic displays in courtship and make\nattractiveness decisions on the basis of cues they derive from body movement. Thus, it is\npossible, that evolution has shaped our brain in order to process body movement cues of\nother individuals in the context of mate selection, similar to evolved preferences for static\nmorphological features of the face and body. Although the studies we have reviewed in this\narticle lend some support to the notion that body movement signals information that is\ncrucial for mate choice, as people are sensitive to the variation in movement styles and\nmake attractiveness judgments based on them, the results should be regarded as\npreliminary. In order to support the hypothesis of an influence of human movement on mate\npreferences and actual mating decisions, further research is needed. Such research should\nmake use of modern technology such as motion capturing, as this provides representations\nof real body movement (e.g., Brown et al., 2005; Knappmeyer et al. 2002; Provost, Quinsey\nmethods is that they capture the whole range of people's body movement and,\nsimultaneously, allow subsequent digital alterations and statistical analysis, based on\nobjective motion descriptors. Here, reflecting trajectories can be used to robustly\nRole of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection\nreconstruct joint angles of the 3D skeletal animation, and this information can be\ntransformed onto a virtual human character. Thus, subsequent perception studies will be\nable to investigate possible associations of body movement, which is free from physical\nform, with numerous biological, physiological and personality characteristics. Such data\nwill be useful to evolutionary psychologists, studying the signaling qualities of human body\nmovements in relation to sexual selection, but also to other topics such as human computer\ninteraction, smart surveillance, athletic performance enhancement and clinical studies.\n"
