This analysis aimed to assess\ncontributions of micronutrients to usual intakes derived from all sources (naturally occurring, fortified and enriched, and\ndietary supplements) and to compare usual intakes to the Dietary Reference Intake for U.S. residents aged $2 y according\nmicronutrients by source. Only a small percentage of the population had total usual intakes (from dietary intakes and\nsupplements) below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for the following: vitamin B-6 (8%), folate (8%), zinc (8%),\nthiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-12, phosphorus, iron, copper, and selenium (,6% for all). However, more of the\npopulation had total usual intakes below the EAR for vitamins A, C, D, and E (34, 25, 70, and 60%, respectively), calcium\n(38%), and magnesium (45%). Only 3 and 35% had total usual intakes of potassium and vitamin K, respectively, greater\nthan the adequate intake. Enrichment and/or fortification largely contributed to intakes of vitamins A, C, and D, thiamin,\niron, and folate. Dietary supplements further reduced the percentage of the population consuming less than the EAR for all\nnutrients. The percentage of the population with total intakes greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) was very\nlow for most nutrients, whereas 10.3 and 8.4% of the population had intakes greater than the UL for niacin and zinc,\nrespectively.

The addition of nutrients to foods, either by\nenrichment (replacing nutrients lost in processing) or fortifica-\ntion (adding nutrients at higher levels than naturally occur in the\nfood), enhances levels of one or more nutrients in certain foods\nthat are widely consumed, thus raising intakes to more desirable\nlevels. Most grain products are enriched and a variety of other\nfood products are fortified. For example, bread is enriched with\nthiamin, niacin, riboflavin, and iron; most RTE8 cereals are\nfortified with added iron and B vitamins, including folate, and\nmost milk is fortified with vitamin D.\nIn addition to obtaining nutrients from foods, many Ameri-\ncans use nutrient-containing dietary supplements (11,12). Ac-\n(aged $1y) used dietary supplements, with multivitamin/min-\neral supplements being the most common (33% of the U.S.\npopulation) (12). Very limited information exists on usual\nmicronutrient intakes in the U.S. from naturally occurring,\nenriched and/or fortified foods, and dietary supplement sources,\nwith the exception of folate (13).\nIn Europe, fortified foods do not contribute significantly to\nhigh intakes for any nutrient, and even with the inclusion of\ndietary supplements most children and adults do not exceed the\n1 Supported by the Fortification Committee of the North American Branch of the\nInternational Life Sciences Institute.

Given that fortification practices and dietary supple-\nment use are very different in the U.S. compared to Europe, this\nstudy aimed to determine total usual nutrient intakes for 19\nmicronutrients from all sources as well as the relative contribu-\ntions of foods (including both naturally occurring nutrients and\nthose added via enrichment and/or fortification) and of dietary\nsupplements within a nationally representative sample of the\nU.S. population aged $2 y.\nParticipants and Methods\nStudy population. The NHANES data are collected by the NCHS of\nthe CDC. All participants or proxies provided written informed consent\nand the Research Ethics Review Board at the NCHS approved the survey\nparticipants who had complete 24-h dietary intake data. Of these, 1241\ninfants or children aged ,2 y and 712 pregnant and/or lactating females\nwere excluded from the analyses, resulting in 16,110 participants aged\n$19 y). Participants completed an in-person health examination in a\nMobile Examination Center that included an in-person 24-h dietary\nrecall. A second 24-h dietary recall was collected via telephone ~3\u00ad10 d\nafter the Mobile Examination Center exam. Both 24-h dietary recalls\nwere collected using the USDA's automated multiple-pass method.\nNutrients from foods. Various USDA food composition databases\nwere used to determine the micronutrients derived from foods consumed\nby NHANES participants and reported in the 24-h recall dietary\ninterview. The USDA estimated the nutrient content of NHANES foods\nin recipes by linking the ingredients in survey food recipes to food\ncomposition data provided by the SR. The SR-Link file of the FNDDS\nversion 2.0 was used in conjunction with SR release 18 to determine the\nrelease 20 were used to determine the composition of foods reported by\nFNDDS 3.0 provided the vitamin D content of foods reported in\nwere matched to the vitamin D addendum, and if there was no match,\nrecipe calculations were performed using the SR-Link file of the FNDDS\n2.0. Because SR releases 18 and 20 did not include the new vitamin D\nFolate food composition values in the SR and FNDDS were separated\ninto amounts added as synthetic folic acid compared to food folate (i.e.\nfolate naturally occurring in food). Added vitamin B-12 and vitamin E\ndata were also readily available and naturally occurring amounts were\ndetermined by the difference between the total and added vitamin\ncontent of these nutrients. To estimate intakes of all other nutrients that\nare added through enrichment and/or fortification of foods, we used\nvarious approaches to separate the nutrient content of foods into\nnaturally occurring and added components. Data available from the SR\nand FNDDS food composition databases as well as the MyPyramid\nEquivalent Database 2.0 (22), which gives equivalent amounts of\nMyPyramid food groups contained in survey foods, were used to\naccomplish this task.\nFor example, if a food contained synthetic folic acid according to the\nFNDDS and grain according to the MyPyramid Equivalent Database and\nif the food was not a fortified grain product, such as bread, the recipe was\nthen examined to determine whether the synthetic folic acid was coming\nfrom enriched flour or another source. We determined the amounts of\nadded thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and iron per 100 g of the\nenriched grain product by calculating the difference between the\nenriched and unenriched SR values. Therefore, given the amount of\nadded folate per 100 g of the survey food and the proportionate amounts\nof folate and other nutrients that were added to the enriched ingredient,\nwe could also then determine the proportionate amounts of other\nnutrients added by enriching the survey food.\nWe used a different approach to determine the amounts of nutrients\nadded to fortified grain products, such as RTE cereals and cereal bars. In\nthis case, the amount of any nutrient added by fortification was obtained\nby calculating the difference between the total nutrient content and an\namount determined to be naturally occurring in the food. We assumed\nthe difference was added by fortification if it exceeded 5% of the Daily\nValue (used in food labeling) per serving of the food. Otherwise, it was\nassumed to be zero if the difference was a trace amount or ,5% of the\nDaily Value/serving, because errors may have been introduced into\ncalculation by rounding or making assumptions regarding the formula-\ntion. The ingredients of the formulation for manufactured foods, such as\nRTE cereals and cereal bars, were not listed in the SR-Link of the\nFNDDS. Therefore, we used information from the MyPyramid Equiv-\nalent Database regarding the cup-equivalent amounts of fruit, nuts, and\ngrains, combined with the nutrient content of representative SR food\ncodes in these categories that are typically used as ingredients of RTE\ncereals, such as raisins, almonds, and unenriched flour, to separate the\nnaturally occurring nutrients from fortificants.\nThe amounts of nutrients added as fortificants to other foods, such as\nvitamin C and calcium added to beverages and vitamins A or D added to\nmargarine or milk, were directly determined by performing recipe\ncalculations using food composition data and the SR-Link file of the\nFNDDS. For example, we separated the fortificants from the vitamins A\nor D that would be naturally occurring in milk and for all survey food\nrecipes that included a specified amount of milk. Using the same\nassumptions as the USDA regarding the use of unfortified milk in food\nmanufacturing, we performed recipe calculations to determine the\nproportions of the USDA survey food composition table values that were\nderived from the fortification of milk as opposed to the vitamins A or D\nnaturally occurring in milk, meat, or other ingredients of the mixture.\nBased on the above approaches, we were able to generate nutrients\nvalues for all foods that were either naturally occurring or added via\nenrichment and/or fortification.\nNutrients from dietary supplements. In conducting the NHANES\nduring the household interview to assess usage of vitamins, minerals,\nbotanicals, and other dietary supplements over the past 30 d (23). For\neach dietary supplement the respondent reported, he or she was asked to\nreport the consumption frequency (i.e. number of days the product was\ntaken in the past 30 d), the duration (i.e. for how many days, weeks,\nmonths, or years the product was taken), and the amount usually taken\nper day on days it was taken in the past 30 d. The interviewer also\nexamined each dietary supplement container and recorded complete\nproduct information so that every reported dietary supplement could be\nmatched or entered into a dietary supplements database. The NCHS\nmaintains a dietary supplements database that contains product label\ninformation obtained from the manufacturers of dietary supplements\nreported in NHANES and these data include the labeled dosage or\nserving size, ingredients, and the amounts of ingredients per serving. The\naverage daily intake of nutrients from dietary supplements was calcu-\nlated for individuals using the number of days that supplement use was\nreported, the reported amount taken per day, and the serving size unit\nfrom the product label.\nEstimation of usual intake. Using the food composition data described\nabove, nutrient intakes from naturally occurring sources were quantified\nfrom each food reported during the individual's two 24-h recall\ninterviews by multiplying the weight (in grams) of food consumed by\nthe nutrient content (amount per 100 g). We also estimated nutrient\nintake from all foods (including nutrients added via enrichment and/or\nfortification) using the same method. To account for differential\nbioavailability of folate and folic acid (24), we used the dietary folate\nequivalent metric.\nEstimates of usual intake for each nutrient were determined using the\nNational Cancer Institute method (25) for a single dietary component,\nbecause nutrients are consumed at some level on most days. Usual intake\nstatistics included means and percentiles of intake and probabilities of\nintakes for nutrients with an established EAR were determined for\nthiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,\niron, zinc, copper, and selenium and vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, and E.\nTABLE 1 Usual intake from NHANES 2003\u00ad2006 compared to DRI from naturally occurring nutrients,\nenrichment/fortification, and dietary supplements in individuals aged $2 y1\nNutrient Usual intake\nPercentiles\nVitamin D,2 mg/d\nCalcium,2 mg/d\nVitamin A, mg RAE/d\nVitamin C, mg/d\nVitamin E, mg AT/d\nThiamin, mg/d\nRiboflavin, mg/d\nNiacin,4 mg/d\nVitamin B-6, mg/d\nFolate,3 mg DFE/d\nPhosphorus, mg/d\nMagnesium,4 mg/d\nIron,5 mg/d\n(Continued)\nWhere do Americans get their nutrients? 1849\nAdditionally, usual intake was determined for 2 nutrients with AI:\nvitamin K and potassium. Because the distribution of requirements is\nskewed for iron (28), we used the probability method to determine the\nprevalence of the population below the EAR. We also determined the\npercentages of the population exceeding the UL for nutrients for which\nan UL was established, including vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E,\nniacin, vitamin B-6, folate, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper,\nselenium, vitamin D, and calcium. Because the UL for niacin and\nmagnesium were established only for supplemental sources (24,26) and\nthe UL for vitamin A and folate were based on retinol and added folic\nacid, respectively (24,28), these were considered when determining\nestimates of usual intakes greater than the UL for these nutrients.\nIntakes from naturally occurring nutrients and from all foods\n(including those enriched and fortified) were determined separately\nfrom total intakes. To determine total nutrient intake, we added nutrient\nintake from dietary supplements to the usual intake from all foods\nsimilar to that previously reported (13). Intake data from both 24-h\nrecalls were used to estimate usual intake from foods. Covariates in the\nusual intake models included age groups, day of the week of dietary\nrecall (weekend/weekday), interview sequence of the dietary recall (in\nperson vs. via telephone), and dietary supplement use. Thus, we\ngenerated 3 sets of data on micronutrient intakes: 1) naturally occurring\nin foods only; 2) from all food sources (including nutrients added via\nenrichment and/or fortification); and 3) from all sources (including all\nfoods and dietary supplements).\nResults\nTotal usual micronutrient intake from all food and sup-\nplement sources. The percentage of individuals aged $2 y\nwith total usual nutrient intake, including that from foods and\ndietary supplements, falling below the EAR was considerable for\ncontrast, smaller proportions of the population had total usual\nintakes below the EAR (in decreasing prevalence) for vitamin\nB-6, zinc, folate, iron, thiamin, copper, vitamin B-12, riboflavin,\nniacin, and selenium. Less than 3% of the population had total\nusual intakes that exceeded the AI for potassium and ~35% of\nthe population had total usual intake greater than the AI for\nvitamin K.\nThe percentage of the population that exceeded the UL (Table\n1) was low for most nutrients (,3% for calcium, iron, and\nvitamins D, C, and E; and ~5% and 8% for vitamin A and zinc,\nrespectively). The sole exception was niacin, in which ~10% of\nthe population had total usual intakes that exceeded UL.\nComparisons of usual micronutrient intake from various\nsources. The percentage of micronutrient intake from foods,\nincluding that from naturally occurring micronutrients and\nmicronutrients added via enrichment, varied considerably by\nmicronutrient for individuals aged $2 y (Table 2). Large\npercentages of vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, and D as well as\nthiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and iron were from fortifica-\ntion and/or enrichment.\nThe percentage of the population with usual intakes below\nthe EAR for many micronutrients was much higher when only\nnaturally occurring nutrients were considered (Fig. 1; Table 1).\nTABLE 1 Continued\nNutrient Usual intake\nPercentiles\nZinc, mg/d\nCopper, mg/d\nSelenium, mg/d\nNutrients with an AI .AI % 6 SEM\nPotassium,2 mg/d\nVitamin K, mg/d\nrecall number, weekday/weekend day, and dietary supplement use (yes/no).

Although all foods\ncontain some naturally occurring nutrients, naturally nutrient-\ndense foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, milk,\nand lean meats are more likely to help individuals meet their\nnutrient needs. Other foods contain both naturally occurring\nnutrients and nutrients added through fortification and/or en-\nrichment. In evaluating total usual intake, most Americans met\ntheir recommended nutrient target for the majority of vitamins\nand minerals evaluated; however, far fewer individuals would\nhave done so without fortification and enrichment. Neverthe-\nless, even after accounting for the contributions of fortifica-\ntion and/or enrichment and dietary supplements, considerable\nTABLE 2 Mean total, naturally occurring, fortified, and enriched nutrients and percentages of daily\nnaturally occurring, fortified, and enriched nutrients in all individuals aged $2 y1\nNutrient\nTotal Naturally occurring Fortified + enriched Enriched Fortified\nMean 6 SEM Mean 6 SEM % Mean 6 SEM % Mean 6 SEM % Mean 6 SEM %\nseparated into nutrients naturally occurring and those that were added; when possible, added nutrients were further separated into\nnutrients added via enrichment and those added via fortification.

Intakes of magnesium and\nvitamins A, C, E, and K were also low for a considerable\npercentage of the population. Our data suggest that enrichment/\nfortification makes a greater contribution in the U.S. compared\nto Europe. Flynn et al. (14) reported that nutrients naturally\noccurring in foods were the major source of nutrients in most\nEuropean countries. This may be because the U.S. fortifies and\nenriches foods to a greater extent than most European countries.\nIn addition to a sizeable percentage of the population who\nappeared to have intakes below recommended levels for some\nmicronutrients, children were also likely to exceed the UL for\ncertain vitamins and minerals. Children were also more likely to\nexceed the UL in Europe as well, with retinol, zinc, and\nmagnesium specifically mentioned (14). However, the proper\napplication of UL values for children has been the topic of\nconsiderable debate (30). The UL is the highest level of daily\nintake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health (24). As\nintake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects may\nincrease. However, the UL is based on a risk assessment\napproach and it is not recommended to be used as a rigid\nstandard or cutoff point; other factors must be considered to\nassess any possible adverse health effects of intakes exceeding\nUL values (24). More research is needed on the adverse health\neffects, if any, from intake levels exceeding the UL, especially\nbecause the UL for children for several nutrients, including\nfolate, zinc, and vitamin A, were based on data with consider-\nable limitations, including insufficient dose-response and toxic-\nThe separation of added nutrients allowed for correct\nassessment of certain nutrient intakes above the UL, namely\nmagnesium and niacin, which without doing so would overes-\ntimate the percentage of the population with intakes greater\nthan the UL. In our data, using total niacin intake for UL\npurposes (not eliminating the naturally occurring niacin), the\nestimate of the population that exceeds the UL was ;50% as\ncompared to 10% when conducted with only added niacin\nintakes.\nA major strength of our study is the use of a large nationally\nrepresentative population-based sample of children and adults\nto assess the source of total usual intake of nutrients with the\nNational Cancer Institute method. For the first time, to our\nknowledge, intakes of micronutrients naturally occurring in\nfoods and intakes of nutrients contributed by enrichment and/or\nfortification were separately determined. One of the limitations\nto our study was that both dietary intake and dietary supplement\nintake estimates were self-reported and as such were subject to\nbias. Additionally, our estimates of naturally occurring nutrients\nand nutrients added to foods were approximate given the\nassumptions needed to determine these intakes.\nFIGURE 1 Percentage of the population with vitamin (A) and mineral\n(B) intakes below the EAR for individuals aged $2 y (data from\noccurring and that from naturally occurring plus added via enrichment\nand/or fortification) and dietary supplements were estimated by using\nthe National Cancer Institute method with 2 d of reported intake.

EAR,\nestimated average requirement; Vit, vitamin; Ribo, riboflavin.\nIn conclusion, most Americans met their needs for many of\nthe micronutrients examined. However, large percentages of the\npopulation had intakes below the EAR for magnesium and\nvitamins A, C, D, and E, and very few individuals obtained the\nrecommended level of potassium. Compared with intakes from\nnaturally occurring nutrients, enrichment and/or fortification\ndramatically improved intakes of several key nutrients, includ-\ning folate, thiamin, iron, and vitamins A and D. Dietary\nsupplements added to the intakes of those who used them and\nfurther reduced the percentage of the population below the EAR\nfor magnesium and vitamins A, C, and E. Intakes from en-\nrichment and/or fortification and from dietary supplements also\nincreased the percentage of participants whose intakes exceeded\nthe UL for niacin, vitamin A, folate, and zinc. The percentage of\nindividuals exceeding UL for most nutrients was relatively small.\nHealth professionals must be aware of the contribution that\nenrichment and/or fortification and dietary supplements make to\nthe nutritional status of Americans.\n"
