This leads to agreement but\nalso to disagreement between the two parties, one area being mate choice (Trivers, 1974).\nMore specifically, parents and children agree on the latter seeking to find mates endowed\nwith good qualities; they disagree, however, on the ideal combination of these qualities\nFor example, consider the case of genetic quality. The coefficient of relatedness of\nparents to children is 0.50, but the coefficient of relatedness of grandparents to\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\ngrandchildren is 0.25. Therefore, the probability of a particular gene of an individual being\npassed on to the next generation by a spouse or in-law would be 50% or 25%, respectively.\nThis means that parents obtain less genetic benefits from a prospective mate of high genetic\nquality than their children (Apostolou, 2007; Buunk, Park, and Dubbs, 2008). Accordingly,\nboth parents and their children would agree that genetic quality is important in an in-law\nand in a mate, but the latter would consider it more important than the former. This\ndisagreement is reflected in the divergence between in-law and mate preferences, with\nbeauty (a proxy of good genetic quality; see Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993) being\npreferred more in a spouse than an in-law (Apostolou, 2008; Buunk et al., 2008; Perilloux,\nAsymmetrical preferences lead to conflict between parents and children as a result\nof the trade-off nature of mating: Constrained by their own mate value, parents and\nchildren have to make compromises with respect to a mating candidate's desirable\nqualities. Nevertheless, since the two parties do not share identical preferences, they will be\nConsequently, if children solely exercise mate choice, they will compromise more than\ntheir parents would like over certain traits (e.g., industriousness and social status) in order\nto get an attractive spouse. Conversely, genetic quality associated with beauty is less\nimportant to parents, thus the advantage from this trait is insufficient to compensate for the\nloss of other desirable traits. For that reason, the children's mate choice may impose a cost\nupon parents in the form of losses in desirable traits (Apostolou, 2011). This cost gives\nparents the incentive to control their children's mating decisions in an effort to acquire in-\nlaws who best fit their own, rather than their children's, preferences (Apostolou, 2014).\nParents have an additional reason to control their children's mating. Parents may be\nconcerned that children lacking experience may make the wrong choices or fall prey to\nindividuals who want to exploit them. This would have a negative fitness cost on parents,\nwho, in order to reduce this cost, would interfere so as to motivate their children to make\nwiser choices and protect them from making bad ones. In sum, conflicting and diverging\ninterests over mating give parents the incentive to exercise control over their children's\nmating decisions.\nIn pre-industrial societies, parents are able to control their children's mating\ndecisions directly and to impose on them their in-law choices (Broude and Green, 1983;\nStephens, 1963). Parents are able to do so because they can apply physical force on their\nchildren, and because their children at marital age are dependent on parental investment\n(Apostolou, 2010). These parental advantages are lost, however, in post-industrial societies\nwhere the rule of law and the protection of individual rights prevent parents from applying\nphysical force on their daughters and sons. Furthermore, in post-industrial societies\nmarriage usually takes place at an age when children are financially independent. As a\nconsequence, parents can no longer impose direct control over their daughters' and sons'\nmate choices, and instead resort to manipulation in order to influence mate choice\nindirectly (Apostolou, 2013). The purpose of this paper is to explore this parental\nmanipulation and to identify some of its key contingencies.\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nParental manipulation over mate choice\nManipulation is employed in a wide range of circumstances, and research has\nrevealed a plethora of manipulation acts that cluster in broader categories of distinct\nwhen they intend to manipulate others. Such tactics include \"coercion\" and \"hardball\"\nwhere individuals use acts such as demanding conformity and posing threats in order to get\ntheir way. Other tactics include \"charm\" and \"monetary rewards\" where individuals use\nacts such as making compliments and giving money to influence others. The tactics\n\"reason,\" \"silent treatment,\" \"pleasure induction,\" \"social comparison,\" \"responsibility\ninvocation,\" \"regression,\" \"reciprocity-reward,\" and \"debasement\" complete the list.\nBuilding on this work, Butkovic and Bratko (2007) constructed an instrument to\nexamine manipulation within a family unit. Using factor analysis, they managed to classify\n22 acts of manipulation into three broader types of manipulation tactics, which they labeled\n\"indirect tactics for coercion,\" \"direct tactics,\" and \"indirect tactics for humoring.\" The\nfocus of this research was, however, to study manipulation within the family in general,\nand not over mate choice in particular.\nNevertheless, manipulation tactics are expected to vary according to the goals\ntowards which they are directed (Buss et al., 1987). Given the specific evolutionary\nproblem that parents face influencing their children's mating decisions (Apostolou, 2010),\nexisting research on general tactics of manipulation is insufficient to identify the whole\nbattery of manipulation tactics that parents employ to influence mate choice.\nA number of studies offer information on the specific tactics that parents use to\nmanipulate mate choice. In particular, Sussman (1953) reported that parents employ means\nsuch as \"cajolery, persuasion, appeals to loyalty, and threats so as to influence the mating\nbehavior of their children. p.80\" Bates (1942) found that American parents rely primarily\non advice to influence mate choice. For example, they assist and encourage the\ndevelopment of relationships of which they approve, and advise on, rather than dictate,\ntheir children's choices. Another study found that modern Chinese parents in the USA\nattempt to create environments in which their children can meet other Chinese children of\ndesirable background (e.g., by staging a barbecue and inviting desirable mates; Ikels,\nThese studies are insufficient to account for the full extent of parental manipulation,\nas they were not specifically designed for this purpose and they report a very limited\nnumber of manipulation acts. To address this limitation, and in order to identify the full\nrange of manipulation tactics that parents use, one study employed a series of interviews\nwith parents and children and identified 72 acts that parents use on their children to\nmanipulate their mate choices (Apostolou, 2013). As parents can influence mate choice by\nmanipulating the mates of their children, this research also identified 27 acts that parents\nuse for this purpose. Parents were then asked to rate how likely they were to use these\ntactics on their children and on their children's mates. By applying principal components\nanalysis, these acts were classified into 12 tactics that parents use on their children and four\ntactics that they use on their children's mates.\nThe current research aims to extend this work by identifying the key factors which\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nare likely to predict the use of parental manipulation tactics over mate choice. Before\ndiscussing manipulation contingencies, it is worth noting that this study also aims to\naddress several limitations of the Apostolou's (2013) study. The prevalence of each tactic\nwas estimated by calculating the mean scores that parents gave for the acts composing it.\nHowever, these estimates are likely to be biased because parents may not give accurate\nscores for their willingness to use specific tactics. For example, they may use the \"hardball\"\ntactic more than they are willing to admit. The present study aims to address this limitation\nby estimating the prevalence of each manipulation tactic not only on the basis of parents'\nratings, but also on individuals' (children's) ratings of the tactics their parents have used on\nthem.\nFurthermore, Apostolou's (2013) study did not distinguish between daughters and\nsons and daughters-in-law and sons-in-law, as parents were asked to indicate how likely\nthey were to use manipulation acts on their children and on their children's mates. This is a\nlimitation because the structure of manipulation tactics may also depend on the sex of the\nchildren and the sex of the children's mates. To address this issue, the present study aims to\nderive the structure of manipulation tactics using a larger sample of parents who were\nasked to indicate their willingness to use manipulation separately for their daughters, sons,\ndaughters' mates and sons' mates.\nManipulation contingencies\nFathers vs. mothers. Women invest more in their children (9 months gestation\nperiod, breastfeeding, etc.) and their biology constrains the number of children they can\nhave. Men, on the other hand, invest less in their children and the number of children they\ncan father is limited only by the number of women they can access. The result of this\nasymmetry is that men fight intensely for access to women, a scarce reproductive resource\n(Trivers, 1972). Traits that enable men to dominate over their rivals are selected and\nincrease in the population, a process called intrasexual selection (Andersson, 1994). Such\ntraits include stronger muscles, bigger body size, and behavioral adaptations such as\naggressiveness, dominance, etc.\nThese traits, however, enable men not only to dominate over other men but also\nover women. In particular, across different cultures and times, men dominate the political\nand economic realms (Whyte, 1978). In the realm of family, men dominate over their wives\nand daughters in a system of family organization known as patriarchy (Smuts, 1995). In\npost-industrial societies, women have equal rights to men, they control wealth, they have\naccess to weaponry, and they even dominate certain realms such as education (Smith,\n2014). But this is evolutionarily novel, with anthropological and historical evidence\nindicating that women spent most of their evolutionary past in a context where they had\nlittle control over wealth, little access to weaponry, and their individual rights were not well\nWomen being physically weaker, having less access to weaponry, having little\ncontrol over wealth, and consequently being less aggressive, need to resort to manipulation\nin order to promote their interests effectively. To put it differently, men's greater physical\nstrength and control of resources exert an evolutionary pressure on women to become more\nmanipulative in order to counterbalance these male advantages and promote their own\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\ninterests. On this basis, it is predicted that women have evolved to be more manipulative\nthan men. Mothers, then, may be more likely than fathers to resort to manipulation in order\nto influence their children's mate choices.\nFurthermore, due to internal gestation, mothers are 100% certain that their children\nare their own; this is not the case for fathers, however, who are less certain about paternity.\nThis indicates that mothers see their interests as being more overlapping with the interests\nof their children, and so they have a stronger concern about the latter's mate choices. For\ninstance, a bad mate choice on behalf of their children that compromises the fitness of their\ngrandchildren (e.g., a mate who is likely to run away) will be more costly to mothers, who\nare certain that these grandchildren are actually their own, than to fathers, who are less\ncertain. Accordingly, mothers will be more likely to interfere than fathers if they believe\nthat a choice is not good for their daughters or sons.\nOverall, it is predicted that mothers will be more willing to employ manipulation in\norder to influence the mate choices of their children compared to fathers. Parents\nmanipulate their children's mate choices not only by applying manipulation on them, but\nalso by applying manipulation on their mates; thus, it is further predicted that mothers will\nbe more willing to apply manipulation on their children's mates compared to fathers.\nDaughters vs. sons. Another consequence of the asymmetry in parental investment,\nwith women being a scarce reproductive resource, is that parents are more interested in\ncontrolling the mate choices of their daughters than of their sons (Perilloux, Fleischman,\nand Buss, 2008). In particular, as men strive to gain access to women, by controlling the\nlatter, parents can better control mate choice (Apostolou, 2010). Furthermore, due to the\nrisk of pregnancy and the value that men ascribe to the chastity of women (Buss, 2003), the\nmating behavior of daughters is likely to be more consequential than the mating behavior of\nsons. For instance, a sexual adventure can commit a daughter's parental investment to a\nman that her parents do not approve of, and/or damage her reputation, compromising her\nfuture chances of attracting desirable mates. Last but not least, parents cannot be certain of\ntheir relatedness to grandchildren fathered by their sons, but they can be certain about their\nrelatedness to their grandchildren mothered by their daughters. This means that parents\nmay have more genetic interests at stake in the mating choices of their daughters than of\ntheir sons, which in turn would motivate them to control their daughters more.\nOverall, as parents are more interested in the mating behavior of their daughters\nthan of their sons, it is predicted that they will be more willing to use manipulation on the\nformer than on the latter.\nPersonality. Personality predicts many aspects of human behavior and it is also\nlikely to predict the use of manipulation tactics. In particular, several studies on\nmanipulation have found personality effects (e.g., Buss, 1992; de Miguel and Buss, 2011)\nthat are also expected to be present in manipulation over mate choice. For example, parents\nwho score highly on agreeableness may be less willing to use manipulation tactics that\ninvolve acts of deception or acts of physical punishment. Thus, it is hypothesized that the\npersonality of parents will predict the use of manipulation tactics on their children and on\ntheir children's mates.\nIt is also likely that the use of manipulation tactics is predicted by the personality of\nchildren. In particular, how effective a tactic is may also depend on the personality of\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nchildren. For instance, children who score highly in agreeableness are likely to be more\neasily moved by parental manipulation acts such as crying or looking sad. Therefore,\nparents may adapt their choice of manipulation according to their children's personality.\nOn this basis, it is further predicted that the use of manipulation tactics is contingent on\nchildren's and on children's mates' personality traits.\nIn sum, this study aims to test the hypotheses that mothers are more willing than\nfathers to use manipulation on their children and on their children's mates, that parents are\nmore willing to use manipulation on their daughters than on their sons, and that the\npersonality of parents, their children, and their children's mates predicts the use of\nmanipulation tactics.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nFour research assistants were employed for the purposes of this study. They\nrecruited individuals who volunteered to participate in a study on family relationships (no\npayment was given). In order to qualify for participation, an individual had to have at least\none child. A snowball sampling technique was used where the research assistants first\nrecruited several parents and then obtained references for other parents who might have\nbeen interested in participating in the study. The research took place in the Republic of\nCyprus, and the participants came predominantly from the two biggest cities of the\nrepublic: Nicosia and Limassol. The data collection process lasted approximately 2 months.\nThis study did not employ couples (i.e., fathers and mothers came from different families).\nThe participants were initially asked to sign a consent form, and then they were given the\nsurvey. Upon completion, the participants put the questionnaire in an unmarked enveloped\nand sealed it.\nParticipants had a mean of 1.2 (SD = 0.8) male children and a mean of 1.2 (SD = 0.8)\nfemale children. The mean age of the oldest female child was 14.2 years (SD = 11.3) and\nthe mean age of the oldest male child was 15 years (SD = 11.3). Moreover, 86.3% of the\nparticipants were married, 7.6% were divorced, 2.9% were single, 1.4% were widowed,\nand 1.6% were in a relationship.\nProcedures\nThe survey consisted of four parts. The first part comprised demographic\ninformation (sex, age, marital status, number of daughters and sons, ages of the oldest male\nchild and the oldest female child). In the second part, participants were asked to consider a\nscenario where they had a daughter and a son who had reached sexual maturity and then\nrate the likelihood of using the 72 acts identified by Apostolou (2013) in order to\nmanipulate the mating behavior of each. In the third part, participants were asked to\nconsider a scenario in which their daughters and sons were dating someone, and then rate\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nthe possibility that they would use the 27 acts identified by Apostolou (2013) in order to\nmanipulate the mates of their daughters and sons. In all cases, a seven-point Likert scale\nwas used which ranged from 1 = \"not at all likely to do it\" to 7 = \"extremely likely to do\nit.\"\nIn the fourth part, participants were given a personality test. For this purpose, the\nBFI-10 (Rammstedt and John, 2007), which is composed of 10 items that measure the Big\nFive personality dimensions, was used. Participation in the survey was voluntary. The\nquestionnaire was rather long, as participants had to rate many traits for both their sons and\ndaughters. Thus, this instrument was chosen because it is not lengthy, yet it maintains high\nvalidity and reliability, and it correlates strongly with longer instruments that measure the\nBig Five (Rammstedt and John, 2007). Finally, the order of presentation of parts two, three\nand four, as well as the order of presentation of children (daughters, sons) and of children's\nmates (boyfriend/husband, girlfriend/wife) was counterbalanced across participants.\nResults\nTactics' underlying structures\nDaughters and sons. Principal components analysis with direct oblimin rotation was\napplied to the 72 acts of manipulation. The direct oblimin method was chosen over the\nvarimax rotation because the presence of non-correlated tactics is unlikely. This analysis\nwas conducted twice, once on the ratings that participants gave for their daughter and once\non the ratings they gave for their son. The results suggested a 12-factor solution\n(Eigenvalue > 1) in the case of both children. The KMO statistic was .94, indicating a very\ngood sample adequacy. Bartlett's test of sphericity was also significant (p < .001),\nindicating that the exploratory factor analysis was meaningful for this dataset. Acts loading\non each factor can be seen in Table 1. The scales comprising each factor (the collection of\nitems) produced by the principal components analysis were checked for internal\nconsistency by means of reliability analysis (Cronbach's ). Internal consistency () for\nFor daughters, 12 tactics emerged (see Table 1), which largely overlap with the\ntactics that have been identified by Apostolou (2013). In particular, we have been able to\nreplicate 8 of the 12 tactics: \"hardball,\" \"matchmaker,\" \"coercion,\" \"prevention,\" \"whom\none should marry,\" \"carrot and stick,\" \"chaperoning,\" and \"guilt trip.\" Two more tactics\nthat emerged here are closely related with previously identified tactics. In particular, the\n\"advice and support\" tactic is close to the previously identified tactic of \"advice and\nreasoning.\" However, although there is some overlap, acts associated with reasoning do not\nload on the tactic that emerged here. It appears that acts associated with support (usually\nwhen something goes wrong with respect to romantic relationships) load highly instead.\nSimilarly, the \"social comparison and moral advising\" is close to the \"social comparison\"\ntactic; however, the tactic that emerged here also has an aspect of moral advising. It seems\nthen that parents use social comparison to demonstrate to their daughters what is morally\nright and wrong. The \"use of relatives and friends\" tactic did not emerge here. Instead, one\ntactic that emerged is \"monitoring,\" where parents closely monitor their daughters'\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nactivities and try to get information about their behavior. Finally, the \"emotional\nmanipulation\" tactic is similar to the \"silent treatment\" tactic, although in this case several\nacts that involve emotional manipulation also load.\nFor sons, 12 factors emerged as well (see Table 1). Nine of these closely overlap\nwith previously identified tactics: \"hardball,\" \"matchmaker,\" \"coercion,\" \"prevention,\"\n\"whom one should marry,\" \"carrot and stick,\" \"chaperoning,\" \"guilt trip,\" and \"use of\nrelatives and friends.\" As in the case of daughters, the \"advice and support\" tactic emerged,\nwhich is similar to the previously identified tactic of \"advice and reasoning.\" Also, the\n\"emotional manipulation\" tactic emerged, which is similar to the \"silent treatment\" tactic.\nThe social comparison tactic did not emerge, but as in the case of daughters the\n\"monitoring\" tactic emerged. Overall, it appears that the structure of parental manipulation\non sons is similar to the one on daughters. But there are differences, one being that the\n\"social comparison and moral advising\" tactic emerged only for daughters, whereas the\n\"use of relatives and friends\" tactic emerged only for sons.\nTable 1.

Before proceeding further, we\ncan briefly summarize the tactics that parents employ in order to influence their children's\nmating behavior. In the \"coercion\" tactic, parents employ acts like yelling and demanding\nconformity. In the \"hardball\" tactic they employ acts such as deception, threats,\ndegradation, and physical violence in order to influence their children. The \"whom one\nshould marry\" tactic involves parents giving advice to their children on what they should be\nlooking to find in a mate. In the \"chaperoning\" tactic, parents closely guard their children\nin order to prevent them from getting into undesirable relationships, whereas in the\n\"prevention\" tactic they employ a series of acts which aim to prevent children from\nattracting unwanted attention or being exposed to undesirable mates. In the \"monitoring\"\ntactic, parents employ acts such as spying in order to monitor their children's behavior. In\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nthe \"guilt trip\" tactic, parents attempt to make their children feel guilty about their\nbehavior. Similarly, in the \"emotional manipulation\" tactic, parents employ acts such\nsulking and whining in order to influence their children's behavior.\nMoreover, in the \"carrot and stick\" tactic, parents provide financial incentives to\ntheir children in order to comply with their will. In the \"use relatives and friends\" tactic,\nthey employ individuals such as relatives or their children's friends and ask them to\ninfluence their children (mainly their sons) on their behalf. In the \"social comparison and\nmoral advising\" tactic, parents compare their children's (mainly their daughters') behavior\nwith desirable behavior exhibited by other individuals, and they also employ acts which\ninvolve references to what is morally correct. In the \"matchmaker\" tactic, parents tell their\nchildren what to do in order to look desirable to prospective partners, and they actively try\nto match them with appropriate individuals. Furthermore, in the \"advice and reasoning\"\ntactic, parents provide advice on romantic relationships usually followed by reasoning why\nchildren should behave in a particular way. Finally, in the \"whom one should marry\" tactic,\nparents give advice to their children on the specific qualities that they should be looking for\nin a mate.\nDaughters-in-law and sons-in-law. Principal components analysis with direct\noblimin rotation was applied to the 27 acts that parents use on their children's mates. The\nanalysis was conducted twice, once on the ratings that participants gave for a prospective\ndaughter-in-law and once on the ratings they gave for a son-in-law. The results suggested a\nfour-factor solution for daughters-in-law and a three-factor solution for sons-in-law\n(Eigenvalue > 1). The KMO statistic was .93, indicating a very good sample adequacy.\nBartlett's test of sphericity was also significant (p < .001), indicating that the exploratory\nfactor analysis is meaningful for this dataset. The scales comprising each factor (the\ncollection of items) produced by the principal components analysis were checked for\ninternal consistency by means of reliability analysis (Cronbach's ). For daughters-in-law,\ninternal consistency () ranged from .61 to .93 with a mean of .79, and for sons-in-law it\nFor daughters-in-law, four tactics emerged (see Table 2). Three of these tactics,\nnamely the \"hardball,\" the \"we are family,\" and the \"dirty laundry\" replicate previously\nidentified tactics (Apostolou, 2013). The previously identified \"lure\" tactic (where parents\nuse money and other means to attract desirable in-laws) did not emerge here. Instead, a\ndifferent tactic emerged, namely the \"coercion\" tactic where parents employ acts such as\nthreats to coerce their prospective daughters-in-law to follow their wishes.\nFor sons-in-law, a three-factor solution emerged (see Table 2). The three tactics,\nnamely the \"hardball,\" the \"we are family,\" and the \"dirty laundry,\" replicate previously\nidentified tactics. As in the case of daughters-in-law, the formerly identified \"lure\" tactic\ndid not emerge. Contrary to daughters-in-law, the \"coercion\" tactic did not emerge in the\ncase of sons-in-law.\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nTable 2.

Before we move on to\nfurther analysis, we briefly discuss the tactics that parents employ on their children's mates.\nTo begin with, in the \"hardball\" tactic threats, degradation, deception, and physical\nviolence appear as acts used to drive away an unwanted in-law. In the \"coercion\" tactic,\ndemands for conformity, but also threats, are used on a prospective in-law (mainly on\ndaughters-in-law). In the \"dirty laundry\" tactic, parents keep their children's mates in check\nby continuously looking for information about them. Finally, in the \"we are family\" tactic,\nparents aim to make desirable mates feel like they are part of their family.\nPrevalence\nTo estimate the tactics' prevalence, means for the different manipulation tactics\nwere computed and the results are presented in Table 3. At the top of the hierarchy for both\nsons and daughters we find the \"advice and support\" and the \"whom one should marry\"\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\ntactics, indicating that parents prefer to take the advice road. The \"prevention\" tactic also\nrates highly on the preference of parents. Further down the hierarchy we find tactics such as\nthe \"matchmaker\" and the \"guilt trip.\" The position of the \"hardball\" tactic at the bottom of\nthe hierarchy indicates that it is least likely to be used by parents, perhaps only as a last\nresort.\nMoving on to prospective in-laws, the mean scores indicate that the preferred tactic\nis the \"we are family,\" and the least preferred one is the \"hardball\" tactic. It can also be\nseen that the \"coercion\" tactic comes second in the parents\" hierarchy for daughters-in-law.\nTable 3. Means and standard deviations of manipulation tactics in Study 1\nManipulation Tactics\nDaughter Son\nRank M SD Rank M SD\nSon-in-law Daughter-in-law\nRank M SD Rank M SD\nDaughters vs. sons\nThe tactics' structures indicate that there are two non-overlapping tactics, which\nonly appear on one of the two sexes. More specifically, the \"social comparison and moral\nadvising\" tactic is used predominantly on daughters, whereas the \"use of relatives and\nfriends\" tactic is used predominantly on sons.\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nWith respect to the overlapping tactics, we wanted to investigate whether parents\nare more willing to use them on their daughters than on their sons. However, because the\nacts that load on each tactic were not identical for sons and daughters, new variables for\neach tactic that included only the overlapping acts were computed in order to make\ncomparisons more meaningful. For instance, for the \"hardball\" tactic, two new composites\nwere computed: one for sons and the other for daughters, based only on the acts that loaded\non this tactic for both sons and daughters. In each pair of composites, a paired-samples t-\ntest was applied and the results are presented in Table 4. We can see that for five tactics\nthere is a significant difference, with parents being more willing to apply them on their\ndaughters than on their sons. Please note that both this analysis and the subsequent analysis\ninvolve multiple comparisons that may inflate the alpha level. As this is the first time that\nsuch analysis takes place, and because we did not want to miss any important differences,\nthe alpha was not set to a more conservative level. Nonetheless, the reader should be aware\nof the possibility of alpha inflation.\nUsing this procedure, we were able to examine whether the use of each tactic was\ncontingent on the sex of the child. It is important to note a limitation here, as many acts\nwere dropped, which might have potentially resulted in a different factor structure and\naltered the conceptualization of each factor. Accordingly, the present results need to be\nreexamined in future research that uses a methodology specifically designed to identify\nwhether specific tactics are more likely to be used on daughters than sons.\nFinally, in order to get an overall measure of parental willingness to apply\nmanipulation, a grand total was estimated by averaging all 72 acts for sons and for\ndaughters and then conducting a paired-samples t-test analysis. The results indicate that\nparents were more willing to apply manipulation on their daughters than on their sons (see\nTable 4. Sex differences in manipulation tactic use in Study 1\nManipulation Tactics\nDaughter vs. Son\nt p d\nSon-in-law vs. Daughter-in-law\nt p d\nGrant Total n.s. n.s. n.s.\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nSons-in-law vs. daughters-in-law\nAs before, in order to identify whether parents' use of manipulation tactics is\ncontingent on the sex of the in-law, new composites were computed based only on the acts\nthat were present in both daughters-in-law and sons-in-law. A series of paired-samples t-\ntests was applied on each tactic, and the results are presented in Table 4. We can see that\nparents are more willing to use the \"we are family\" tactic on their prospective daughters-in-\nlaw than on their prospective sons-in-law, while they are more willing to use the \"dirty\nlaundry\" on their sons-in-law than on their daughters-in-law. Comparisons between grand\ntotals found no significant differences, indicating that parents were not willing to use more\nmanipulation on either their sons-in-law or their daughters-in-law.\nMothers vs. fathers, personality, and age effects\nChildren. To examine whether the use of manipulation tactics can be predicted by\nthe sex, the personality, and the age of parents, a series of MANCOVAs (Multivariate\nAnalyses of Covariance) was applied to each tactic separately for sons and daughters. In\nparticular, the acts that composed each tactic were entered as dependent variables and the\nsex, personality (five variables, one for each personality dimension), and age of parents\nwere entered as independent variables. The age of the oldest son was also entered as an\nindependent variable when the analysis was performed for sons, and the age of the oldest\ndaughter was entered as an independent variable when the analysis was performed for\ndaughters. Backward elimination method was applied in order to reach the best model for\neach tactic.\nAs we can see from Table 5, with respect to daughters, fathers indicated a higher\nwillingness to use the \"prevention\" and the \"chaperoning\" tactics compared to mothers,\nwhereas mothers indicated a higher willingness to use the \"advice and support,\" the\n\"emotional manipulation,\" and the \"whom one should marry\" tactics compared to fathers.\nWith respect to sons, fathers were more willing than mothers to use the \"hardball\" tactic,\nwhereas mothers indicated a higher willingness to use the \"advice and support,\" the\n\"emotional manipulation,\" and the \"whom one should marry\" tactics than fathers.\nIn order to identify whether mothers were more willing than fathers to employ\nmanipulation on their children, an independent-samples t-test was applied to the grand\ntotals of sons and daughters, with the sex of the parent being entered as the independent\nfactor. The results indicated that mothers were more willing than fathers to use\nWith respect to personality, the most consistent predictor of manipulation use was\nconscientiousness, which was significant for several tactics in both daughters and sons (see\nTable 5). The coefficient of this trait was always negative, indicating that the more\nconscientious parents are, the less willing they are to use manipulation on their children.\nMoreover, emotional stability and extraversion appear to predict the \"advice and support\"\ntactic, but only for daughters. Finally, emotional stability predicts the use of \"coercion\" for\ndaughters and the use of \"whom one should marry\" for sons.\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nTable 5.

Age was almost always a negative coefficient indicating that\nas parents are getting older, their willingness to manipulate the mate choices of their\nchildren decreases. Note that this is a real effect, as the age of parents does not constitute a\nproxy of their children's age (i.e., older parents having older children) since the age of the\noldest child was also entered as an independent variable.\nIn-laws. A similar analysis (i.e., MANCOVA) was performed on the manipulation\ntactics parents used on their in-laws. For daughters-in-law, fathers reported more\nwillingness to use the \"hardball\" and the \"coercion\" tactics compared to mothers, whereas\nmothers were more willing to use the \"we are family\" tactic compared to fathers (see Table\n6). For sons-in-law, fathers were more willing to use the \"hardball\" tactic, whereas mothers\nwere more willing to use the \"we are family\" tactic (see Table 6).\nTo investigate whether mothers were more willing than fathers to use manipulation\non their in-laws, an independent-samples t-test was applied to the grand totals for both in-\nlaws, with parents' sex being entered as the independent factor. The results indicated that\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nmothers were more willing than fathers to use manipulation on their prospective daughters-\nPersonality was an important predictor, but only for the \"hardball\" tactic (see Table\n6). In particular, the \"hardball\" tactic for daughters-in-law is predicted by\nconscientiousness and agreeableness, and for sons-in-law it is predicted by agreeableness,\nemotional stability, and openness. Finally, age was also a consistent predictor of the use of\nmanipulation. The age variable was always a negative coefficient, indicating that as parents\nage, they become less willing to use manipulation on their prospective in-laws.\nTable 6.

They recruited individuals who volunteered to participate in research on\nfamily relationships (no payment was given). The data collection process lasted\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\napproximately 1 month. The study took place in the Republic of Cyprus, and the\nparticipants came predominantly from the two biggest cities of the republic: Nicosia and\nLimassol. The participants were initially asked to sign a consent form, and then they were\ngiven the survey. Upon completion, the participants were asked to put the questionnaire in\nan unmarked enveloped and seal it.\nIn addition, 72% of the participants indicated that they did not have children. Moreover,\n3.2% were divorced, and 0.2% were widowed.\nProcedures\nThe survey consisted of four parts. In the first part, demographic information was\ncollected (sex, age, and marital status). In the second part, participants were asked to rate\nhow frequently they perceived their parents to have used on them the 72 manipulation acts\nof Study 1 in order to manipulate their mating behavior. In the third part, participants were\nasked to rate how frequently they perceived the parents of their mates to have used on them\nthe 27 manipulation acts identified in Study 1. In all cases, a seven-point Likert scale was\nused, which ranged from 1 = \"they never do it\" to 7 = \"they always do it.\" The order of\npresentation of parts two and three (parents, mates' parents) was counterbalanced across\nparticipants. In the fourth part, participants were given the BFI-10 (Rammstedt and John,\n2007) to measure the Big Five personality dimensions.\nResults\nPrevalence\nOn the basis of the tactics' structure derived in Study 1, we estimated mean scores\nfor each manipulation tactic, which can be seen in Table 7. Both daughters and sons\nreported the \"advice and support\" and the \"whom one should marry\" tactics to be more\nfrequently used on them, followed by the \"prevention\" tactic. Further down we find tactics\nsuch as the \"emotional manipulation\" and the \"guilt trip.\" The least frequently reported\ntactic was the \"hardball.\" Furthermore, when participants indicated their experience as\nprospective in-laws, they reported the \"we are family\" to be the most frequently used tactic,\nand the \"hardball\" to be the least frequently tactic used on them (see Table 7).\nThe hierarchy of tactics that parents were willing to use (Study 1) appeared to be\nvery similar to the tactics children reported that their parents used on them. This is\nconfirmed by correlation analysis. In particular, the order hierarchy for a daughter produced\nin Study 1 was correlated with the order hierarchy for daughters produced in this study.\nSpearman's correlation was .82, whilst the respective correlation for sons was .85. With\nrespect to in-laws, Spearman's correlation for sons-in-law was 1.0 (indicating a complete\noverlap), whilst for daughters-in-law it was .80.\nThese results indicate that there was a consistency between what parents said they\ndid and what they actually did as indicated by their children. Thus, the possibility of report\nbias by parents with respect to the more frequent use of tactics such as the \"hardball\" than\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nthey were willing to admit, mentioned as a potential source of distorted information in\nStudy 1, is minimized. Triangulation of parents' data with children's data suggests an\nagreement of the two sources, as children also reported the \"hardball\" to be the least\nfrequent tactic used on them.\nA further observation is that the mean scores that individuals reported in Study 2\nwere smaller than the mean scores parents reported in Study 1. One possible interpretation\nof this finding is that parents reported more willingness to apply manipulation than they\nactually did. Another possible interpretation is that a property of effective manipulation is\nnot to be perceived as such; therefore, much of the manipulation may go undetected by\nchildren. Consequently, individuals may have reported being less manipulated because\nthere may have been many instances in which their parents employed manipulation without\nthem being aware of it.\nTable 7. Means and standard deviations of manipulation tactics in Study 2\nManipulation Tactics\nDaughter Son\nRank M SD Rank M SD\nSon-in-law Daughter-in-law\nRank M SD Rank M SD\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nDaughters vs. sons\nTo examine whether manipulation is contingent on the participants' sex, new\nvariables were computed on the basis of overlapping acts. A series of independent-samples\nt-tests was applied on each manipulation tactic, with the sex of the participant being entered\nas the independent variable. The results indicated that for the \"advice and support,\" the\n\"emotional manipulation,\" the \"prevention,\" and the \"guilt trip\" tactics, women report\nsignificantly more manipulation than men (see Table 8). Note that parents in Study 1\nreported higher willingness to use the \"prevention\" and the \"emotional manipulation\"\ntactics on their daughters than on their sons.\nAn independent-samples t-test was applied to the grand totals, which indicated that\n(two-tailed), d = .48. This is consistent with the findings of Study 1, where parents reported\na higher willingness to manipulate their daughters than their sons. It is also interesting to\nnote that the effect size in this case is more than three times bigger than the effect size\nfound in Study 1 (i.e., d = .14), where the grand total of sons was compared with the grand\ntotal of daughters. One possible explanation is that parents may be less willing to report\nthat they intend to apply more manipulation on their daughters than on their sons.\nTable 8.

A series of independent-samples t-tests\nwas conducted on each manipulation tactic, with the sex of the participant entered as the\nindependent variable. The results indicated that women reported \"we are family\" to be\nmore frequently used on them than men (see Table 8). This is consistent with the results of\nStudy 1, where parents indicated that they were more willing to use the \"we are family\"\ntactic on their prospective daughters-in-law than on their prospective sons-in-law. Finally,\nan independent-samples t-test was applied on the grand totals, but no significant difference\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nwas found. This finding is also consistent with the results of Study 1, where parents\nreported an equal willingness to use manipulation on their prospective daughters-in-law\nand on their sons-in-laws.\nPersonality and age effects\nTo examine whether the use of manipulation tactics could be predicted by\nparticipants' personality and age, a series of MANCOVAs (Multivariate Analyses of\nCovariance) was applied to each tactic for both women and men. In particular, acts\ncomposing each tactic were entered as dependent variables, and the personality (five\nindependent variables, one for each personality dimension) and age of participants were\nentered as independent variables. Backward elimination method was applied in order to\nreach the best model for each tactic.\nThe results indicated that the agreeableness personality dimension predicted several\ntactics. For women, agreeableness predicted three tactics: \"advice and support,\"\n\"prevention,\" and \"social comparison and moral advising\" (see Table 9). The coefficient\nwas negative in all three cases, indicating that women who scored high on this trait were\nless likely to report that their parents had applied these tactics on them. For men, on the\nother hand, agreeableness predicted five tactics: \"hardball,\" \"advice and support,\"\n\"emotional manipulation,\" \"carrot and stick,\" and \"guilt trip.\" With the exception of the\n\"carrot and stick\" tactic, for which the relationship was negative, the relationships were\npositive, indicating that higher scorers on this trait were more likely to report that their\nparents had applied these tactics on them. Agreeableness also predicted the use of\n\"hardball\" on sons-in-law (see Table 10).\nTable 9.

As a matter of fact, certain\nresults look counterintuitive. For instance, for women there was a positive relationship\nbetween the \"prevention\" tactic and conscientiousness, indicating that the more\nconscientious daughters were, the more likely their parents were to use this tactic on them.\nActually, we would expect the opposite result: The more conscientious daughters were, the\nless likely their parents would be to use this tactic on them. One possible explanation for\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nthis finding is that what is actually measured here is not whether the personality of children\npredicts the tactics that their parents use on them, but instead whether the personality of\nchildren predicts which tactics they are going to report. For instance, more conscientious\ndaughters may be more likely to report that their parents have used the \"prevention\" tactic\non them.\nMoving on, age appeared to predict several tactics for daughters. With the exception\nof the \"advice and support\" tactic where the relationship was negative, for the rest of the\ntactics the relationship was positive, indicating that older women were more likely to report\nthese tactics. For men, age only predicted the \"emotional manipulation\" and the \"carrot and\nstick\" tactics. For daughters-in-law, age predicted most of the tactics used (see Table 10),\nwith the relationship being positive. Age did not predict tactics used on sons-in-law. In\nmost of the cases, age had a positive coefficient; this is likely to partially reflect an\naccumulation of experience effect, where older individuals have experienced more\nmanipulation from their parents, and thus, they are more likely to report it.\nExploring the factor structure\nThe tactics that parents employ on their children should be mirrored in the tactics\nthat individuals report that their parents use on them. Consequently, it is hypothesized that\nthe factor structure identified in Study 1 will also appear in Study 2. It is not, however,\nexpected that the two factor structures will be identical, one reason being that many\nmanipulation acts can go undetected, which in turn may result in individuals not reporting\nor underreporting them and consequently affecting the factor structure derived from their\nresponses.\nIn order to examine the degree to which the factor structure of Study 1 is replicated\nhere, principal components analysis with direct oblimin rotation was applied to the 72 acts\nof manipulation. This analysis was applied twice, once on the ratings that female\nparticipants gave and once on the ratings that male participants gave. The results for\nwomen suggest an 11-factor solution (Eigenvalue > 1), with the KMO statistic being .87.\nThe results are presented in Table 1. The \"carrot and stick\" tactic was not replicated, whilst\nthe rest of the tactics produced were closely related to the tactics identified in Study 1,\nalbeit with some different manipulation acts loadings. In particular, it appeared that for\n\"social comparisons and moral advising,\" the moral advising acts did not load, whereas for\n\"advice and support,\" the support acts did not load.\nThe results for men suggest a nine-factor solution (Eigenvalue > 1), with the KMO\nstatistic being .82. These are presented in Table 1. The \"use of relatives and friends,\"\n\"chaperoning,\" and \"prevention\" tactics were not extracted. One possible reason why the\nlast two tactics were not replicated here is likely to be that men may be less willing to\nreport that their parents have employed such tactics on them.\nMoreover, principal components analysis with direct oblimin rotation was applied\nto the 27 acts that participants reported their mate's parents have used on them. This\nanalysis was applied twice, once on the ratings that female participants gave, and once on\nthe ratings that male participants gave. The results for women suggested a three-factor\nsolution (Eigenvalue > 1) with the KMO statistic being .88. These are presented in Table 2.\nWe can see that the produced factor structure is similar to the one produced in Study 1, but\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nwe were not able to replicate the \"coercion\" tactic. The results for men also suggest a three-\nfactor solution (Eigenvalue > 1) with the KMO statistic being .85. These are presented in\nTable 2 where we can see that the factor structure closely overlaps with the one produced in\nDiscussion\nThe current research attempted to identify the structure and prevalence of\nmanipulation tactics that parents employ to influence their children's mating behavior, and\nto identify the primary factors that predict the use of these tactics. Parents reported more\nwillingness to employ advice and less willingness to apply more direct and aggressive\napproaches such as physical punishment. The willingness to use tactics is mirrored in\nindividuals' (children's) reporting of tactics employed on them. Also, consistent with the\noriginal hypotheses, parents reported that they were willing to employ more manipulation\non their daughters than on their sons, and women reported more manipulation by their\nparents than men. In addition, mothers indicated more willingness to employ manipulation\non their children and on their children's mates than fathers.\nAs hypothesized, personality predicted the use of tactics, with conscientiousness\nconstraining parents' willingness to apply manipulation on their children. Children's\npersonality also appeared to play a role, but the results were not clear-cut. The role of\nchildren's personality in determining their parents' use of tactics needs to be re-examined\nwith a different research design, where parents will be asked to rate their children's\npersonality, and then indicate their willingness to use manipulation tactics on them.\nAnother finding was that older individuals reported more manipulation by their parents, but\nthis is more likely an accumulating experience effect rather than a real age effect. Finally,\nthe age of parents was negatively related to their willingness to apply manipulation on their\nchildren and their children's mates.\nOne possible explanation for the latter finding is that the residual reproductive value\nof younger parents is higher than the residual reproductive value of older parents. In other\nwords, parents have more reproductive years ahead of them when they are younger than\nwhen they are older. In a pre-industrial context, and most probably during ancestral times,\nparents would control their children's mate choices so as to arrange beneficial marriage\nalliances, and they could divert this cost in their own reproductive effort (Apostolou, 2014).\nFor instance, a father could use the bridewealth he received from the marriage of his\ndaughter to get an additional wife for himself, while a mother could use the resources\nderived from a beneficial alliance to mother additional children. However, these\nreproductive benefits are exhausted with age, which means that older parents have less to\ngain from controlling their children. As a consequence, there will be less intense selection\npressures exercised on older parents to control mating, which in turn may result in older\nparents being less interested in using manipulation to influence their children's mate\nchoice.\nOur findings suggest that the highest degree of manipulation will come from\nrelatively young mothers with low conscientiousness and will be applied predominantly to\ntheir daughters. Highly conscientious, older male parents are the least likely to apply\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics\nmanipulation on their children and especially on their sons. When parents apply\nmanipulation, it will predominantly take the form of advice, whereas tactics such as the\n\"hardball\" will be left as a last option.\nParents have a wide and diverse battery of tactics that they use to manipulate their\nchildren's mate choices. The next question that future research can address is how effective\nthese tactics are in actually modifying children's behavior in a way that complies with their\nparents' wishes. If tactics are indeed quite effective, this would mean that individuals'\nmating success is determined not only by how desirable they are to the members of the\nopposite sex, but also by how desirable they are to their prospective mates' parents.\nOne limitation of this research is that it is based on self-report data. This is\nparticularly important in assessing the prevalence of tactics such as the \"hardball,\" since\nparents may be more willing to use them than they are willing to admit. This limitation is\npartially controlled by Study 2, where individuals reported the tactics that their parents\nhave used on them. The results of Study 2 mirrored the results of Study 1, but reporting\nbiases cannot be totally eliminated. For instance, it may still be the case that children are\nless willing to report that their parents have used acts such as physical violence on them.\nAnother limitation is that this research is based on a nonprobability sample, which\nmeans that certain population groups may be over-represented or under-represented.\nAccordingly, because factors such as education, social status, wealth, etc. are also likely to\ninfluence the use of tactics, these biases may affect the mean scores in both studies. We do\nnot think that this is a serious impediment to the results produced here, but future research\nneeds to replicate these findings in different samples, and also to explore how other factors\nare likely to affect the use of tactics. Last but not least, this research is based on a single\nculture and its results cannot be directly generalized to other cultural settings. Accordingly,\nfuture research should attempt to measure tactics and replicate their contingencies in\ndifferent cultural contexts.\nPeople use a plethora of tactics to manipulate each other. Manipulation appears to\nfeature prominently between parents and their children, with respect to the latter's mate\nchoices. This research has provided evidence that manipulation is predicted by the sex of\nthe parent, the sex of the child and the personalities of both parties. Future research needs\nto identify further contingencies of this important and fascinating aspect of human\nbehavior.\n"
