Two-way analysis of variance assessed interaction\neffects of perceived complexity of care and perceived autonomy on satisfaction. Logistic regression anal-\nysis identified physician characteristics, practice characteristics, practice improvement strategies, per-\nceived complexity, and perceived autonomy that accounted for variance in career satisfaction among\nphysicians.\nResults: Although 24% to 27% of physicians felt perceived complexity of care expected was greater\nthan it should be, 83% to 86% felt free to make clinical decisions. Approximately 80% of physicians\nwere satisfied with their careers. Differences in probability of career satisfaction were highly significant\n(P < .001) for both perceived complexity of care and perceived autonomy as well as their interaction. A\nmultiphysician practice; the ability to obtain high quality ancillary services (such as physical therapy,\nhome health care, and nutritional counseling); managed care revenue, lower levels of perceived com-\nplexity of expected care; and perceived autonomy were consistently associated with satisfaction.\nConclusion: Higher perceived autonomy and lower perceived patient complexity as higher than de-\nsirable were associated with high career satisfaction among primary care physicians. (J Am Board Fam\nDespite the positive impact that primary care has\non population health and health care systems,1,2\nthere is a growing shortage of primary care physi-\ncians.3 Further evidence of this shortage is the\nobservation that specialist physicians are providing\nprimary care services.4 Even more alarming is the\ndecline in interest in primary care among graduat-\ning medical students.5,6\nThe diminishing numbers of primary care phy-\nsicians (PCPs) reflect the decreased attractiveness\nof primary care as a career to new physicians and\nthe loss of established physicians because of retire-\nment and \"burnout.\"7 Recent surveys among US\nPCPs found that only 33% report being very sat-\nisfied.8 However, US PCPs may be even more\nsatisfied than those from other countries.9\u00ad12 One\nexplanation for diminishing satisfaction among\nPCPs may be a decreasing sense of professional\nPCPs are experiencing a loss of perceived auton-\nomy,14 possibly because of incentives designed to\ndecrease services and expenses.8 This decline in the\nsense of autonomy is greater among PCPs com-\npared with specialists.13 Even though US family\nphysicians rate their ability to order tests as greater\nwhen compared with their Canadian counterparts,\nthey also feel that their health care system is more\nin need of change.12 Overall, the situation is so\npoor for US PCPs that more than half report a\nsense of powerlessness.14\nIn addition to a loss of perceived autonomy,\nPCPs are managing patients with much more com-\nplex and demanding problems. Patients with mul-\ntiple chronic illnesses are now the norm, rather\nthan the exception, in primary care clinics.15,16 In\naddition, guideline-recommended services and\ntreatment regimens for any one chronic disease are\nThis article was externally peer reviewed.\nFrom the Department of Family and Community Medi-\ncine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San\nAntonio.\nFunding: none.\nConflict of interest: The corresponding author serves on\nadvisory boards for AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline.\nCorresponding author: David Katerndahl, MD, Depart-\nment of Family and Community Medicine, University of\nTexas Health Science Center at San Antonio (E-mail:\nkaterndahl@uthscsa.edu).\nsignificantly more complex today than they were a\nfew short years ago.17 It is possible that the cogni-\ntive and emotional demands placed on PCPs by\nthese types of patients have had an adverse impact\non career satisfaction.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the\nrelationships of both perceived autonomy and per-\nceived complexity of care with career satisfaction in\na nationally representative sample of PCPs. We\nwere primarily interested in these relationships af-\nter controlling for physician demographic charac-\nteristics and characteristics of the practice environ-\nment.\nMethods\nSample\nThis study was a secondary analysis of data col-\nlected in 3 waves of the Community Tracking Sur-\n2001); these waves included different participating\nnot included because many of the variables differed.\nThe sampling strategy using American Medical As-\nsociation and American Osteopathic Association\nfiles was designed to produce a sample representa-\ntive of physicians providing direct patient care.18,19\nOffice- and hospital-based physicians who had\ncompleted training and provided at least 20 hours\nof direct patient care weekly were included with\nover the telephone. Item nonresponse rates were\ngenerally below 3%.\nThe Community Tracking Survey used a com-\nplex design with 60 sites. Although some physicians\ncompleted more than one panel, the public access\nfiles used in this survey cannot identify changes in\nindividual physician responses over time. Accord-\ning to study documentation, \"it is suitable for most\nresearchers who wish to perform analyses at the\nnational level and do not anticipate using the site-\nlevel information in their analysis\"20; site-level in-\nformation was not used in this analysis. For this\nstudy, only PCPs (from family or general practice,\ngeneral internal medicine, or pediatrics) were used.\nPredictors\nPredictors were clustered into 4 groups: (1) physi-\ncian characteristics; (2) practice characteristics, in-\ncluding the use of practice improvement strategies;\n(3) perceived complexity of patients; and (4) physi-\ncian autonomy.\nPhysician Characteristics\nPhysician variables were selected to identify sub-\ngroups who may report differences in satisfaction\nand included gender; race (white versus nonwhite);\nsalaried (yes/no); specialty (family/general practice,\ngeneral internal medicine, pediatrics); began prac-\ntice after 1975 (yes/no) (a proxy for physician age);\nand the importance of autonomy expectations (very\nimportant vs less than very important). Race was\nsurveys; importance of control of decisions was\nPractice Environment\nPractice environment variables were selected that\ncould influence perceptions and included the num-\nber of weeks the physician practiced per year, the\nnumber of hours per week spent in direct patient\ncare, whether the physician had more than one\npractice site (yes/no), whether the practice had\nmore than one physician (yes/no), whether there\nwere any nonphysician assistants in the practice\n(yes/no), and whether the patient population in-\ncluded both adults and children (yes/no). In addi-\ntion, the percentages of patients with prescription\nformularies and revenue from Medicaid, Medicare,\nand managed care were included. Finally, the per-\nceived availability of high-quality ancillary services\n(such as physical therapy, home health care, and\nnutritional counseling); imaging; mental health\ncare; and referrals (frequently vs less than fre-\nquently) were also included. The presence of non-\nphysician assistants and care for both adults and\npatients with a prescription formulary was only\nPractice Improvement Strategies\nVariables concerning practice improvement strate-\ngies designed to improve quality of care but that\nmay have affected perceptions included the per-\nceived effect on the practice (at least moderate vs\nless than moderate effect) of computer-generated\npatient data, practice guidelines, patient profiles,\nreminders, patient surveys, and computer-gener-\nated treatment alternatives. The effect of computer-\ngenerated patient data and treatment alternatives as\nwell as reminders was not assessed in the 2000 to\n7 questions were asked concerning whether infor-\nmation technology (IT) was used (\"no\" vs \"yes\") to\nget information about treatment alternatives and\nformularies, to generate reminders, to access pa-\ntient notes, to write prescriptions, to exchange clin-\nical data, and to communicate with patients. An\ninformation technology use scale (IT Uses) was\ndeveloped consisting of the number of \"yes\" re-\nsponses (Kuder-Richardson-20 internal consis-\nPhysician Perceptions\nPerceived complexity of patient care was assessed.\nPerceived complexity of patient care physicians felt\nthey were expected to provide was measured using\nthe question: \"In general, would you say that the\ncomplexity or severity of patients' conditions for\nwhich you are currently expected to provide care\nwithout referral is: much greater than it should be,\nsomewhat greater than it should be, about right,\nsomewhat less than it should be, or much less than\nit should be?\" This variable was dichotomized into\n\"much or somewhat greater complexity of care ex-\npected (yes/no)\" for use in logistic regression anal-\nyses.\nPerceived autonomy was measured using the\nstatement \"I have the freedom to make clinical\ndecisions that meet my patients' needs,\" with the\nresponses of \"agree strongly,\" \"agree somewhat,\"\n\"disagree somewhat,\" \"disagree strongly,\" and\n\"neither agree nor disagree.\" Perceived autonomy\nwas dichotomized into \"agree strongly or some-\nwhat that you have freedom to make clinical deci-\nsions (yes/no).\"\nOutcome\nCareer satisfaction was measured using the ques-\ntion, \"Thinking very generally about your satisfac-\ntion with your overall career in medicine, would\nyou say that you are currently: very satisfied, some-\nwhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatis-\nfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.\" Satisfaction\nwas dichotomized into \"very or somewhat satisfied\nwith your career (yes/no).\"\nAnalysis\nData were weighted using the weights provided in\nthe public access file. To assess possible interaction\neffects between perceived complexity of care and\nperceived autonomy of the predicted probability of\ncareer satisfaction, 2-way analysis of variance was\nconducted. To identify the relative contributions of\nphysician characteristics, practice characteristics,\nimprovement strategies, and physician perceptions,\nstaged logistic regression analysis was performed\nfor career satisfaction for each survey. Model 1\nconsisted of physician characteristics only and\nmodel 2 consisted of physician and practice char-\nacteristics. Model 3 included practice improvement\nstrategies in addition to the physician and practice\ncharacteristics. In model 4, the perceived complex-\nity of care and perceived autonomy variables were\nadded to model 3. 2 statistics were used to assess\nsignificance of each model with P  0.05 deemed\nsignificant. Goodness-of-fit was assessed using\nHosmer-Lemeshow statistics and the variance ac-\ncounted for was estimated using Nagelkerke ad-\njusted R2.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the physician and practice char-\nacteristics of physicians in this analysis. Physician\ncharacteristics were similar across the surveys.\nChanges in practice characteristics were primarily\nlimited to increases in the number of hours spent in\ndirect patient care and the proportion of revenue\nfrom managed care. Overall, 24% to 27% of PCPs\nfelt that the perceived complexity of care they were\nexpected to provide was greater than it should be\nand 83% to 86% felt they were free to make clinical\ndecisions. Approximately 80% of physicians were\nvery or somewhat satisfied with their careers.\nComplexity-Autonomy Interaction\nFor all 3 panels, the adjusted probability of satis-\nfaction is significantly associated (P  .001) with\nboth perceived complexity of care and perceived\nautonomy. As Figure 1 demonstrates, physicians\nwho report both low levels of perceived autonomy\nand high levels of perceived patient complexity are\nless likely to be very or somewhat satisfied with\ntheir career in medicine after controlling for phy-\nsician, practice environment, and practice improve-\nment characteristics. For example, predicted career\nphysicians who reported low perceived autonomy\nand high perceived patient complexity to 86%\namong those reporting low perceived patient com-\nplexity and high perceived autonomy.\nHigh\nAutonomy\nLow\nAutonomy\n.

Although relationships between predictors and\nsurvey included significant associations that were not\nsignificant previously, including physician character-\nteristics (ability to obtain high quality imaging [,\n(computer-generated treatment alternatives [, 0.16;\nDiscussion\nAlthough results of the Community Tracking Survey\nconcerning career satisfaction have been reported\npreviously,21,22 this analysis is the first to look at the\nrelationships among perceived complexity of care,\nperceived autonomy, and career satisfaction. In addi-\ntion to their independent contributions, perceived\ncomplexity of care and perceived autonomy signifi-\ncantly interacted to affect the probability of satisfac-\ntion. Our analysis found that only multiphysician\npractice, the ability to obtain high-quality ancillary\nservices, managed care revenue, levels of perceived\ncomplexity of patients, and perceived autonomy was\nconsistently associated with satisfaction.\nCareer Satisfaction\nOverall, approximately 80% of PCPs expressed satis-\nfaction. This is similar to the results of Baker et al23\namong health management organization physicians.\nNone of the analyses in this study found a relationship\nbetween satisfaction and physician race, gender, or\nsalary status. This differs from previous studies that\nfound associations with minority status,23 gen-\ntion in the older analyses only; Sturm22 and Gaze-\nwood et al24 found significant differences across spe-\ncialties. Beginning practice after 1975 (perhaps a\nproxy for physician age) was an inconsistent predictor,\nconsistent with previous studies.9,11\nPractice environment variables were more im-\nportant to satisfaction. Our analyses found that\nmore weeks practicing per year, more hours per\nweek in patient care, and being in a solo practice\nwere significant correlates of lower satisfaction.\nPrevious studies have found that hours spent in\nity of assistants11 were significant correlates. The\nability to obtain high-quality ancillary services was\na consistent predictor of satisfaction. Although rev-\nenue from Medicare was an inconsistent predictor,\nincome from managed care was consistently and\ninversely related to satisfaction. Previous studies\nhave found conflicting results concerning the rela-\ntionship between managed care and satisfac-\ntion,22,24 but incentives to reduce services seems to\nadversely affect satisfaction.8\nPractice improvement strategies were not re-\nlated to satisfaction. The use of performance indi-\ncators has been felt to decrease perceived autonomy\neven though some physicians view them as a chal-\nlenge.27 However, the perception that the level of\nperceived complexity of expected care was greater\nthan it should be was a consistent correlate of\ndissatisfaction. Although not studied previously,\nLin et al11 found that the complexity of claims was\nassociated with dissatisfaction among PCPs.\nThis study found a consistent association be-\ntween perceived autonomy and career satisfaction.\nNot surprisingly, this relationship has been docu-\nfound that perceived autonomy was the most im-\nportant predictor of satisfaction among health\nmanagement organization physicians. Our study\nalso found considerable overlap among consistent\npredictors (the ability to obtain high-quality ser-\nvices, the proportion of revenue from managed\ncare, and the perceived complexity of care expected\ngreater than it should be). Previous work found that\nperceived autonomy was related to financial auton-\ncare revenues,24 perhaps because of the effect of\nincentives to reduce services.8 Thus, these out-\ncomes are related but not identical.\nImplications\nAlthough this study represents 3 cross-sectional,\nand not causal, analyses, there is reason to consider\nsome to be cause-and-effect relationships.

In\nparticular, the ability to obtain high-quality ser-\nvices and minimizing the proportion of revenue\nfrom managed care are important factors in maxi-\nmizing satisfaction. Second, the use of practice im-\nprovement strategies had a minimal effect on sat-\nisfaction. Although these strategies emphasize the\nconflict between providing what is best for the\nillness versus the patient,29 they should have little\neffect on satisfaction. Third, the perception that\nphysicians are expected to provide care at an inap-\npropriately high level of complexity was consis-\ntently negatively associated with satisfaction. This\nis a concerning finding because not only is the\ncomplexity of health care increasing,30 but this is\nparticularly true of primary care.31 In fact, by its\nvery nature, primary care is more complex than\nspecialty care.32 To deal with this rise in the per-\nceived complexity of expected care, the PCP must\nbe able to respond with flexible decision making33\nand creativity.30 Generally, combined strategies are\nrequired to deal with complex problems.34\nBut at a higher level, what are the implications for\nkeeping PCPs and attracting new physicians into pri-\nmary care? Whether or not approaches such as prac-\ntice improvement strategies, managed care, and the\nuse of incentives that limit the availability of services\nwill help control health care costs, perceived auton-\nomy and/or perceived complexity of care being\ngreater than should be are clearly associated with\ncareer satisfaction. This is very relevant to the grow-\ning crisis of our inability to recruit and keep physi-\ncians in primary care. The interaction between low\nperceived autonomy and high perceived complexity\nof care creates a situation in which physicians feel they\nhave a lot of responsibility but little authority; it is\nlittle wonder that satisfaction would be adversely af-\nfected. Yet, the Future of Family Medicine Project\nhas emphasized the need to enhance the attractive-\nness of family medicine through recognition, resolu-\ntion of the tension between the need for increased\noffice visits and the provision of quality care, and\naddressing the challenges posed by managed care.35\nThese issues will inevitably affect the quality and\nattractiveness of primary care. In addition, because\nthe practice environment of chronic care is unlikely to\nchange, we need to consider ways to better prepare\nphysicians in training to cope with this high-complex-\nity, low-autonomy reality. Through the establish-\nment of realistic expectations and improved training\nin dealing with the realities of practice, physicians\nmay alter their definitions of high-complexity care.\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, the\nperceived complexity variables used deal with percep-\ntions of complexity of care; the actual complexity of\ncare was not assessed. In addition, because \"complex-\nity is greater than it should be\" implies a negative\nassessment, its relationship to career satisfaction is\nsions had poor goodness-of-fit statistics, raising con-\ncern about the validity of their results. Third, the\npredictors of career satisfaction accounted for 15%\nof the variance. In fact, for both outcomes, the pre-\ndictors could not explain most of the variance; there is\nmuch more involved in satisfaction and perceived\nautonomy than what was measured. Fourth, compar-\ning the regressions across surveys is concerning. Not\nonly were different groups of physicians participating\nin each survey, but some predictors were not assessed\nin all 3 surveys. The exclusion of results from the\nfound that almost 84% expressed satisfaction (http://\nctsonline.S-3.com/psurvey.asp). Thus, the level of\nsatisfaction among PCPs may be increasing.\nConclusion\nThere was considerable interaction among per-\nceived complexity of care, perceived autonomy, and\ncareer satisfaction and consistent predictors were\nidentified. Practice variables as well as perceived\ncomplexity and perceived autonomy accounted for\nmost of the variance in career satisfaction. If the\nshortage of PCPs is to be addressed, we must re-\nsolve issues surrounding the availability of services,\nthe challenges of managed care, the impact of prac-\ntice improvement strategies, and the perceived\ncomplexity of expected care.\nReferences\n1.
