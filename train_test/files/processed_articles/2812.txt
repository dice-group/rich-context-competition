In addition, evidence exists that in\nsome Connecticut jurisdictions, officer, rather than juvenile, behavior was impacted by\nthis law change.\nPolicy Implications\nAlthough raise-the-age policies may remain desirable for other policy reasons, no robust\nevidence of their effects on crime is yet available. Given the absence of such evidence of\ncrime effects, policy makers interested in raise-the-age policies for their crime-reduction\nbenefits might consider focusing on other juvenile justice policy initiatives with demon-\nstrated crime-reduction benefits. Nevertheless, policy makers interested in these policies\nfor other policy reasons can rest assured that there is no evidence that these policies\nexacerbate juvenile crime. The results of this study also suggest that the effects of \"raise-\nthe-age\" policies on crime will be difficult to separate from recent declining trends in\njuvenile crime and arrests as well as from changes in police arrest decision making.\nKeywords\nraise the age, Connecticut, crime, age of majority, evaluation\nAccording to the results from recent research, juveniles, particularly males, do not\nreach psychosocial maturity until well into their 20s (Cauffman, 2012; Steinberg\nand Cauffman, 1996). This finding has implications for the culpability and the\nreformability of juvenile offenders, particularly older juvenile offenders, who are often tried\nas adults and sent to adult prisons. If juveniles do not fully mature until postadolescence,\nscholars have argued, then juveniles who offend before reaching this threshold should not\nbe subject to the adult criminal justice system with its greater emphasis on punishment\nrather than on rehabilitation (Farrington, Loeber, and Howell, 2012; National Academy of\nSciences, 2013). In light of these arguments, over the last decade, several states with sub-18\nages of majority have actively considered expanding the jurisdiction of their juvenile courts\nby increasing the maximum jurisdictional age to 18 for all but the most serious criminal\noffenses (Brown, 2012). Several states, including Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Mis-\nsissippi, and New Hampshire, have already done so in whole or in part. Proponents of\nthese changes argue that raising the age of majority, and thus, expanding the juvenile justice\nsystem, will reduce crime by increasing affected juveniles' access to the more abundant treat-\nment opportunities available in the juvenile justice system and by limiting their exposure to\nthe more harmful aspects of the adult justice system. They further argue that the decrease in\ncrime will, on balance, produce cost savings in the long run that will offset the higher costs\nof processing juvenile arrestees as juveniles (Henrichson and Levshin, 2011).1 Opponents\n1. In North Carolina, the additional cost of processing an individual as a juvenile rather than as an adult has\nbeen estimated to be as follows: arrest ($249), detention ($181.90), court and adjudication costs\n46 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\ncounter that at least some older teen offenders are more appropriately handled in the adult\njustice system and that raising the age of majority may increase juvenile crime by reducing\nthe deterrence value of an arrest (Gibson and Krohn, 2012).\nAltering the age of majority also raises important questions regarding processing effects\nfor the large number of first-time and nonserious offenders who are shifted between these two\njudicial systems by these policies. Although a substantial literature on juvenile transfer has\nbeen developed in recent years documenting the consequences of transferring serious and/or\nrepeat juvenile felony offenders into the adult justice system (Bishop, Frazier, Lanza-Kaduce,\ntransfers are relatively rare--of the 1.5 million juvenile delinquency cases in 2009, only\n7,600 were transferred into the adult justice system (Knoll and Sickmund, 2012). Far less\nis known about the public safety consequences of moving more commonplace juvenile\noffenders between these two systems (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015b). If newly retained\njuveniles benefit from a reduction in the age of criminal majority, then crime can potentially\nbe reduced by raising the age of majority. Nevertheless, the opposite could be true if the\nabsence of a credible deterrent leads juveniles to engage in more and more serious criminal\nactivity.\nThe short-term effects of \"raise-the-age\" policies on crime have been estimated in\nseveral recent papers. The results of an early investigation of Connecticut's raise-the-age\nlaw, which involved comparing 16-year-olds arrested before and after the law change,\nsuggested that it produced large reductions in juvenile recidivism (Justice Policy Institute,\n2013). A more recent evaluation of Illinois' law change, which included counterfactual\ncomparison groups consisting of juveniles arrested weeks before the Illinois law change or\nweeks before their 17th birthday after the law change, yielded little evidence of an effect\non juvenile recidivism (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Although many of the outstanding\nmethodological concerns of estimating the effects of raise-the-age policies at the individual\nlevel were addressed in this more recent study, identifying the aggregate-level crime effects\nof raise-the-age policies remains a difficult challenge for two reasons.\nTo estimate the aggregate level effects of a juvenile justice policy like raise the age,\nresearchers must be able to identify a credible policy counterfactual to substitute for the\nunobservable condition of what would have happened in the adopting jurisdiction if it had\nretained the existing policy regime. The most common solution to this estimation problem is\nto use a differences-in-differences framework, comparing the jurisdiction with itself (before-\nand-after) as well as with neighboring jurisdictions under the assumption that the timing of\nthe policy shock is as good as random. Even though regression-based implementations of this\napproach typically use all other states or neighboring states as counterfactual comparison\ngroups, neither of these serve as ideal counterfactual comparisons because of short-term\nfluctuations in state crime rates. A further complication in the estimation of the crime\neffects of \"raise-the-age\" legislation is the long-noted difficulty of separating changes in\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\noffending from changes in the likelihood of police arrest (Black, 1970, 1971; Perlman,\nof age-specific offending statistics in most jurisdictions, leaving the analyst to depend on\nage-specific arrest statistics as a proxy for the missing age-specific offending statistics.\nScholars have repeatedly expressed concerns that changes in police behavior could be\nmistaken for changes in offender behavior, particularly if shifting arrest patterns are corre-\nlated with the demographic characteristics of offenders. Although much of this scholarship\nhas been focused on the influence of impermissible factors, such as race, ethnicity, or gen-\nder, this concern might be even greater for factors such as the offender age, where both\nthe civilian and the law enforcement communities may have strong preferences regarding\nthe appropriateness and usefulness of arresting children and adolescents (Goldman, 1963;\nVisher, 1981). A particularly concerning version of this problem could occur if officers are\nless likely to arrest a 16-year-old in a world in which that 16-year-old will be adjudicated in\nthe juvenile justice system rather than in the adult justice system. If officers believe that such\nan arrest is going to generate excessive processing burdens related to parental notification\nor is less likely to lead to punishment and, in turn, decline to arrest certain juveniles, then\nresulting models will be biased toward a finding that raising the age of majority reduces\njuvenile offending even if juveniles offend at the same frequency. Ruhland, Gold, and\nHekman (1982) raised just such a possibility in their analysis of juvenile offending in states\nwith different ages of majority--highlighting long-standing concerns that differences in\nstatutory age boundaries could influence officer behavior as much as or more than they\ninfluence juvenile offender behavior.\nSuch a concern also figures prominently in the applied microeconomics literature, in\nwhich researchers have estimated the deterrence value of adult sanctions (Hjalmarsson, 2009;\nLee and McCrary, 2005, 2009). Despite these concerns, most information on individual\ncriminal offending behavior, particularly age-related criminal offending patterns, is derived\nfrom police-generated arrest statistics, which are themselves generated from information\ngathered after the arrest of an individual. This process filters the underlying offending data,\nconvolving offender behavior with officer preferences. If no other source of information\non the prevalence of crime is available, which it often is not, then it is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to distinguish these two different behavioral responses.\nIn this article, we provide two distinct tests for measuring the crime effects of state-\nand age-specific criminal justice policies, which we illustrate by estimating the crime effects\nof \"raise-the-age\" policies in the state of Connecticut. First, we use the method of synthetic\ncontrols (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmuller, 2010) to examine whether arrests among\nConnecticut juveniles in treated age groups changed relative to arrests among juveniles in\nuntreated age groups, compared with a weighted average of other U.S. states with similar\npre-2010 age-specific arrest trends. This methodology represents the synthetic control\nanalog to a triple-differences estimator using linear regression. Second, to test for changes in\n48 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\npolice officer behavior, we use incident-based data to compare individuals in treated versus\nuntreated age groups within Connecticut (i.e., 15-year-olds compared with 16-year-olds\nand 16-year-olds compared with 17-year-olds). The primary innovation in these models is\nto use information on the age of offenders that is provided by victims in cases that lead to\nan arrest as well as those that do not lead to an arrest. As this information is not sensitive to\nthe police officer's choice to make an arrest, it is a purer measure of juvenile behavior than\nare corresponding arrest data, which are most often used to estimate the crime effects of\njuvenile justice policies on crime. The results of these tests provide no evidence that raising\nthe age of majority resulted in an increase in either juvenile arrest or juvenile offending.\nAlthough point estimates are not sufficiently precise to make definitive claims, if anything,\nthe majority of the evidence suggests that juvenile offending either remained unchanged or\nmay have temporarily declined as a result of the policy change. These findings contribute\nto the extant literature in several ways. First, they add to a growing literature in applied\nmicroeconomics in which the relative insensitivity of juvenile offending behavior to the\nsanctions to which juveniles are exposed has been documented, suggesting that studies in\nthe criminological literature with reports of substantial effects may have been estimated on\na different policy margin or that selection bias may have affected these studies. Second,\nthese results provide evidence in a key policy debate within the criminological literature,\nindicating that shifting the age of majority is unlikely to have a significant effect on criminal\noffending, at least in the short run (Cauffman, 2012; Farrington et al., 2012; Gibson and\nKrohn, 2012). Finally, they demonstrate the importance of separating officer from offender\nbehavior, a first-order and, to date, unaddressed problem in the evaluation of age-specific\ncrime policies.\nRaising the Age of Majority\nIn 2006 and 2007, the Connecticut legislature considered extending the juvenile court\njurisdiction to include 16- and 17-year-olds who were, at the time, tried as adults.2 Pro-\nponents argued that greater access to rehabilitative programming in the juvenile justice\nsystem was essential to address the underlying causes of teenage offending in addition to\nachieving other policy goals, including reducing the risk of juvenile victimization in the\nadult justice system and diminished culpability (Poitras, 2007b). Opponents, including\nseveral Connecticut police chiefs, argued that shifting 16- and 17-year-old arrestees into\nthe juvenile justice system would overwhelm the already overcrowded juvenile system as\nwell as expose younger children in the juvenile system to victimization by older adoles-\ncents (Melone, 2007). As in many jurisdictions considering \"raise-the-age\" legislation at\nthis time (National Campaign to Reform State Juvenile Justice Systems [NCRSJJS], 2013),\n2. First-time offenders who were 16 or 17 years of age were eligible for youthful offender status, which\nallowed for confidentiality of proceedings and expungement of records, but affected juveniles were\nnevertheless processed through the adult justice system.\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nproponents not only pointed to the additional rehabilitative needs of still-maturing juveniles\nas justification for treating juveniles as juveniles but also referenced the higher recidivism\nrates observed among juveniles processed as adults in several academic studies (Poitras,\n2007a). These same studies were also interpreted as suggesting that crime rates would be\nlower in Connecticut after the age of majority was raised, more than making up for the\nadditional costs of processing juveniles as juveniles (Roman, 2006).3\nOnce the law change was passed in 2007, concerns remained about the capacity\nof the juvenile justice system to absorb the influx of 16-year-olds when the first stage of\nguidance and police confusion over its implementation, which led officers to release juveniles\nwith warnings in lieu of arrest (Backus, 2011). Despite these implementation challenges,\nobservers pointed to several positive changes in the crime situation involving 16-year-olds as\nevidence of the new law's success. These changes included slightly lower rates of recidivism\namong 16-year-olds arrested and newly processed in the juvenile justice system (State of\nConnecticut, 2012; Weinreb, 2014). They also interpreted decreases in juvenile arrests\ncoinciding with the 2010 change as evidence of the policy's effects (Justice Policy Institute,\n2013). To date, however, no evaluation has indicated whether this crime reduction is in\nfact larger than those observed in national trends or than month-to-month jurisdictional\nvariability. Moreover, to the extent that the observed crime reduction represents the effect\nof the policy changes, it remains to be seen whether it is the result of changes in juvenile\noffending behavior, officer arrest behavior, or some other mechanism leading to year-to-year\nfluctuations in juvenile crime rates.\nJuvenile Offending and Age\nThe enactment of changes to the age of majority raises a fundamental theoretical question in\ncriminology--are offenders, particularly young offenders, sensitive to changes in statutory\npenalties or other changes in how their cases are handled by the justice system? If so,\nconsistent with deterrence theory (Nagin, 1998; Zimring, 1976), juveniles processed in the\nadult system, as well as juvenile offenders threatened with processing in the adult system,\nshould be less likely to offend, less frequent in their offending, or less likely to engage in\nserious offending. If, on the other hand, processing juveniles as adults denies them essential\nservices or otherwise exposes them to particularly harmful aspects of the adult justice system,\nthen secondary deviance in the form of escalated or additional offending could be generated,\ncanceling out or even swamping any deterrent effects (National Academy of Sciences, 2013).\nFinally, differential processing of juveniles could result in no discernable effect on crime if\njuveniles are unaware or indifferent to the existence of these alternatives and the systems\n3. Contemporaneous estimates placed the benefit\u00adcost ratio at 3 to 1 (Roman, 2006).\n4. Connecticut implemented its higher age of majority in two discrete policy shifts--raising the age of\n50 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\ndiffer less, for the modal offender, than anticipated (Feld, 1997; Wolfgang, Thornberry, and\nChanges to the statutory age of majority also implicate a foundational measurement\nproblem in criminology--separating the possible behavioral responses of juveniles from the\npossible behavioral responses of law enforcement officers--because changes to legal policies,\npenalties, and procedures can simultaneously alter the costs of responding to and committing\ncrime. Despite widespread recognition among scholars that the filtering of criminal statistics\nthrough the recording behavior of police officers poses a complex measurement challenge\nlittle quantitative research conducted on the possible adaptive behavior of law enforcement\nofficials to the existence or modification of juvenile jurisdictional boundaries. Recently,\nhowever, in a few applied microeconomics papers, in which juvenile offending on either\nside of a jurisdictional boundary was examined, both of these questions were discussed by\nthe authors.5\nThe earliest such paper, by Levitt (1998), involved an investigation into whether the\nfraction of the statewide crime rate attributable to juveniles was sensitive to the location\nof the age of majority or the relative punitiveness of a jurisdiction's juvenile and adult\njustice systems. In a mixed finding for deterrence theory, Levitt reported sizable declines\nin age-specific crime rates just after the age of majority, but little evidence that the relative\npunitiveness of a state's juvenile or adult justice system explained this result. To overcome the\nunavailability of an age-specific offending rate, Levitt imputed the age-specific offending rate\nfrom the age-specific arrest rate and the overall nonage-adjusted crime rate. Hjalmarsson\n(2009) resolved this measurement problem without resorting to imputation when she\nexamined self-report data on offending and perceived probability of punishment from a\nnationally representative longitudinal sample of juveniles. She reported elevated perceptions\nof the probability of punishment after the age of majority (Hjalmarsson, 2009). Nevertheless,\nthe magnitude of her finding was much smaller than that reported in Levitt (1998). She\nalso reported no evidence of differences in self-reported offending behavior on either side\nof the age of majority.\nLee and McCrary (2009), in a working paper that was the first to apply the regression\ndiscontinuity methodology to the question of juvenile offending, reported minimal effects\nof the age of majority on the density of offending near the age boundary in a sample of\narrestees from Florida. They also reported only slight evidence in favor of the effect of\nthe age of majority on juvenile rearrest rates. Similarly, Loeffler and Grunwald (2015b) in\ntheir study of juvenile offending in Chicago provided evidence of slightly lower recidivism\nrates beyond the age of majority but no indication of substantial differences. The absence\nof substantial changes in arrest rates across the jurisdictional boundaries in both of these\n5. For an early criminological precursor of this applied microeconomic work, see Ruhland et al. (1982).\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nstudies, as in the study by Hjalmarsson, suggests that the behavioral effects of these adjacent\njurisdictions may be smaller than predicted by deterrence theory. Yet, given the possibility of\nchanges in officer behavior across these jurisdictional boundaries, the effects of the boundary\non juvenile behavior remains fundamentally unresolved.\nThe findings from these more recent studies also contrast with those from earlier work\nin which robust, albeit heterogeneous, evidence of elevated levels of reoffending among\njuveniles processed as adults was discovered (Bishop et al., 1996; Fagan, 1996; Lanza-\nKaduce et al., 2005; Loughran et al., 2010). Much of this earlier work, however, was\nfocused on juvenile transfer populations, the relatively small number of more serious or\nfrequent offenders, the approximately 1% to 5% of juvenile arrestees who were subject\nto adult prosecution and punishment even though they fell below the relevant age of\nmajority (Bishop, 2000; Puzzanchera and Addie, 2014). Even though these earlier studies\ncontributed to the policy discussion surrounding raising the age of majority by providing\nevidence that processing at least some juveniles as adults could counterproductively elevate\njuvenile reoffending rates, the policies adopted in Connecticut and elsewhere generally\nexclude many of these juvenile offenders from the juvenile justice system. For this reason,\ntheir relevance and generalizability to the much larger population of juvenile offenders\nsubject to the expanded jurisdiction of the juvenile court under raise-the-age policies is\nunknown.\nThe findings from the first published study on the effects of raising the age of majority\nthat involved a comparison of the affected juveniles with a credible comparison group\nunaffected by the law provided little evidence of all but the smallest of possible effects\non reoffending of raising the age of majority for misdemeanors (Loeffler and Grunwald,\n2015a). The findings of this study, when coupled with those from other recent studies on\nthe age\u00adcrime relationship near the age of majority, suggested that the effects of processing\nnontransfer juvenile offenders as adults may be much smaller than the effects anticipated\nby proponents of raise-the-age policies. Still, this work was primarily focused on only one\nelement of the crime equation--criminal reoffending. It is possible that juvenile offending\ncould be affected beyond those directly processed, which would lead to a change in the\ndensity of offending even if there was no change in the probability of reoffending conditional\non arrest.\nAlthough the aggregate-level effects of a shift in the entire age boundary between\nthe juvenile and adult justice systems have not been explored recently, the findings from\nevaluations of prior and more limited changes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile\njustice system have provided limited evidence for such cohort-wide behavioral effects (Jensen\nWeak evidence has generally been found for the importance of boundary changes. It is\npossible, given the narrower focus of those changes, that the broader change of shifting\nthe entire age of majority will produce different results. Nonetheless, the totality of the\navailable evidence suggests that any observed effects will be small in magnitude and that\n52 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nany bias could run in either direction given that the estimated effect of such a law change\nis the averaging of the opposite signed causal mechanism of unknown relative magnitude\npredicted by deterrence and rehabilitative theories.\nThe effects of shifting the age of majority on law enforcement behavior, independent\nof any effects on juvenile offending behavior, are more difficult to predict. There is certainly\nreason to suspect that officers could be more hesitant to arrest a 16-year-old caught in the\nact of shoplifting when that juvenile will be processed in the juvenile justice system rather\nthan in the adult justice system. Making such an arrest when the 16-year-old is subject to\nthe juvenile justice system instead of to the adult justice system likely adds to the amount\nof work that the officer must do. He or she can no longer simply detain and transport the\narrestee in addition to filing an arrest report. He or she must now locate and notify the\n16-year-old's parent or guardian and likely remain with the juvenile until that guardian has\narrived or the juvenile has been evaluated for temporary detention. As the most likely result\nof this arrest is the release of the juvenile to the care and custody of his or her guardian within\nhours of arrest, many officers may come to believe that the arrest is not worth making (Lee\nand McCrary, 2009). Even though several observers have noted this possibility, the absence\nof systematic empirical evidence makes it difficult to predict how large such an influence\nmight be.\nData, Method, and Results\nIn 2010, with the implementation of the first phase of Connecticut's modified juvenile\noffender law, the state saw a decline in the number of 16-year-old juveniles who were\narrested (see Figure 1). This decline appeared to contemporary observers to be steeper than\nthe decline for other age groups, particularly 15-year-old offenders (Justice Policy Institute,\n2013). Nevertheless, Connecticut, like most other states in the United States, experienced a\nsubstantial secular decline in juvenile arrests throughout this period, a trend that accelerated\nin 2009, complicating a simple analysis of yearly data (Puzzanchera, 2013). To determine\nthe average treatment effect of the 2010 law change and to resolve the measurement problem\ncaused by missing age-specific offending information in many of the studies in the existing\nliterature, we employ two different estimation strategies--synthetic matching at the state\nlevel and a differences-in-differences estimator at the individual level using age-specific arrest\nand offender information.\nState-Level Synthetic Control Comparison\nThe effects of aggregate-level policy interventions have been examined in a large criminology\nliterature that uses observational data. The standard approach to estimating the treatment\neffect of such policy interventions is to compare an outcome, typically crime, before and after\nthe intervention in geographic units that were treated to the evolution of the outcome in a\nsample of geographic units that were not treated. This approach, known as \"differences-in-\ndifferences\" (D-D), is easily implemented by using least-squares regression and has become\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nF I G U R E 1\nTrends in Connecticut Youth Arrests by Age (UCR and NIBRS Reporting\n# of arrests\nyear\narrests of 15-year-olds arrests of 16-year-olds\narrests of 17-year-olds arrests of 18-year-olds\nubiquitous in empirical social science research. The standard approach to computing D-\nD estimates of the effect of a state-level policy shock is to regress a state- and time-\nvarying outcome, Yit; on a treatment dummy, Dit; a vector of time-varying covariates,\nXit; and state and time fixed effects. In this framework, the coefficient on Dit can be\ninterpreted as the causal estimate of the effect of the intervention so long as the timing of\nthe intervention is random, conditional on the other variables in the model. Another way\nto state the identifying assumption of differences-in-differences is that the treated states and\nthe comparison states would have experienced parallel trends in the dependent variable but\nfor the treatment. In the case of the 2010 law change, under this assumption, Connecticut\nand comparison states would have experienced the same fluctuations in the juvenile arrest\nrate for individuals of different ages but for the decision to raise the age of criminal\nmajority. The standard methods of constructing a state comparison group include the use\nof unweighted regressions, which implicitly assumes that comparison states and treatment\nstates experience common trends; the use of population weighted regressions, which assumes\nthat states with similarly sized populations are the best comparisons for the treated state; or a\nmanually selected comparison group, which assumes that the researcher can credibly identify\ncomparison states by drawing on their experience, intuition, or a visual comparison of\ntrends.\n54 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nThe synthetic control method, by contrast, was developed to provide a data-driven way\nto choose a comparison group. In particular, in the context of a state-level intervention,\nthe methodology allows researchers to assign an analytic weight to each U.S. state that has\nnot implemented a given policy where the weights are computed such that the difference\nin the trends on a given preintervention outcome, such as juvenile arrest rates between\ntreated states and the pool of available comparison states, is minimized. In this way, a\ncomparison group is generated that, conditional on pretreatment observables, experiences\nparallel trends--at least prior to implementation of the treatment.\nIn the present application, the synthetic control method was used to determine empir-\nically the mixture of states that manifest a similar pre-2010 trend in juvenile arrests. This\napproach avoids the need to hand-pick specific states that could serve as controls for theo-\nretical reasons but might, in reality, be poor proxies for the counterfactual of Connecticut\nwithout a raised age of majority as a result of different underlying criminal justice regimes\nor other differences in juvenile justice policy. The synthetic control procedure works as\nfollows: Let the index j = (1,2,J) denote the J states in the United States that have not\nrecently raised the age of juvenile majority. The value j = 1 corresponds to Connecticut,\nwhereas j = (2,J) corresponds to each of the other U.S. states in the donor pool of states\nthat are potential comparison units for Connecticut. Define Y0 as a k \u00d7 1 vector with\nelements equal to arrest rates in each year of the pretreatment period and likewise define\nthe k \u00d7 J matrix Y1 as a stack of similar vectors for each of the other J states in the donor\npool. The application of the synthetic control method identifies a convex combination of\nthe J \u00ad 1 states in the donor pool that best approximates the preintervention data vectors\nfor Connecticut. That is, by using the applied algorithm, a weighted average of other U.S.\nstates is chosen that closely resembles Connecticut with respect to juvenile arrest rate, prior\nto Connecticut's policy change in 2010. Define the J \u00d7 1 weighting vector W = (w1, w2,\nwJ) such that:\nwj\nCondition (A1) guarantees that the weights sum to 1, whereas condition (A2) con-\nstrains that the weights are weakly positive. The product Y1W then gives a weighted average\nof the preintervention vectors for all states in the donor pool, with the difference between\nConnecticut and this average given by Y0 \u00ad Y1W. Values for the weighting vector, W, are\nthen selected that result in a synthetic comparison group that best approximates the prein-\ntervention crime trend in Connecticut. Once the optimal weighting vector W* is computed,\nboth the preintervention path as well as the postintervention values for the dependent vari-\nable in \"synthetic\" Connecticut can be tabulated by calculating the corresponding weighted\naverage for each year using the donor states with positive weights. The postintervention\nvalues for the synthetic control group composed of the weighted average of states mirroring\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nthe preintervention trajectory of Connecticut serve as the counterfactual outcomes for what\nwould have happened in Connecticut if no change to the age of majority had occurred in\nOur principal estimate of the impact of each of Connecticut's policy shocks on crime\nand juvenile arrests uses the pre- and posttreatment values for both Connecticut and its\nsynthetic control group to calculate a simple differences-in-differences estimate.

Next, we recompute the synthetic D-D estimates under\nthe assumption that each of these other states, in fact, raised their age of majority in 2010.\nBecause the causal effect of these placebo laws must be zero by construction, the distribution\nof these \"placebo\" D-D estimates then provides the equivalent of a sampling distribution\nfor the estimate DDCT by comparing the observed difference between Connecticut and its\nsynthetic comparison with the distribution of differences within the states that did not raise\ntheir ages of majority (see Abadie et al., 2010, for a detailed discussion).\nTo estimate this synthetic control model, we use monthly state-level Uniform Crime\nweighted control cases do not include states that experimented with different versions of\nthe \"raise-the-age\" legislation during this period, we exclude Colorado, Illinois, Missouri,\nMississippi, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island from the donor pool.

To assess whether any changes in arrests are\nobservable in changes in the crime rate, we then reestimate the synthetic control estimates\nby using overall state crime rates.

The dissimilarity of weights by outcome reinforces the utility of synthetic controls as\ncompared with a static set of adjacent comparison states.\n56 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nF I G U R E 2\nSynthetic Control Graph for Proportion of Youthful Arrests by 16-Year-Olds\nin the UCR-reported crime data, we cannot estimate age-specific offending rates. Instead,\nwe examine overall statewide crime rates, which juveniles disproportionately contribute to,\nto see whether there is any evidence of corresponding shifts in the overall crime rate.\nFigure 2a depicts the primary results of the synthetic control comparison showing\nthe fraction of all youthful arrestees (15\u00ad17-year-olds) that are 16 years of age leading\nup to and after the 2010 law change. Three notable findings emerge from this graph.\nFirst, an extraordinarily similar comparison group is identified when the synthetic control\nmethod is applied that closely tracks the trajectory of Connecticut's arrest trends in the\npre-2010 period.7 Second, the trends for Connecticut and its synthetic comparison group\nsharply diverge in 2010, which is consistent with the dip in 16-year-old arrests observed\nin Figure 1. Finally, there is a convergence of trends beginning approximately 1 year after\nthe initial divergence. The magnitude of the arrest difference between Connecticut and\nall other states in 2010 is 2.7 percentage points (representing a 14% reduction) and falls\nto less than one percentage point by 2012. Figure 2b plots the counterfactual distribution\nof treatment effects by studying the effect of a placebo intervention for each state in the\ndonor pool. When comparing the actual difference in arrests observed for Connecticut with\nthe placebo comparisons reported in Figure 2b, it appears as though the magnitude of the\nestimated difference for Connecticut is initially larger than all but two placebo estimates,\nsuggesting that Connecticut's decline in arrests is unlikely to be spurious. Nevertheless, by\n7. It is notable that the match between Connecticut and synthetic Connecticut is excellent, even when we\ncondition only on preperiod observations of the dependent variable and not on any other covariates.\nThis is a common feature of synthetic controls applications because by having matched on the lags of\nthe dependent variable, we are implicitly matching on other covariates as well, insofar as the\ndependent variable is serially correlated. Given the quality of the match on the basis of lags of the\ndependent variable alone, we choose not to condition on other covariates so as to minimize the\nproblem of overfitting (Abadie et al., 2010).\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nF I G U R E 3\nSynthetic Control Graph for Crime Rate (Connecticut vs. United States)\nViolent Crime\n(a) (b)\nProperty Crime\n(c) (d)\n2012, the estimated difference for Connecticut is very close to zero and falls well within the\ncounterfactual sampling distribution.\nGiven the magnitude of the drop in 16-year-old arrests observed in 2010, it is possible\nthat a corresponding drop in nonage-specific crime rates should be visible if changes in\noffender behavior are driving this observed drop in 16-year-old offenders. Figure 3 presents\na series of synthetic control models testing this hypothesis with statewide UCR-reported\ncrimes replacing youthful arrests as the dependent variable. A similarly high-quality prepe-\nriod match is achieved by applying these new models, and at first glance, sizable divergences\nare shown between Connecticut and its synthetic comparison for both violent (Figure 3a)\nand property crime (Figure 3c) trends. Yet, these drops appear to be unremarkable as most\nplacebo estimates (Figure 3b and 3d) are of similar or larger magnitudes.8\n8. Similar results (not shown) were found for other crime categories (e.g., drug offenses and other\noffenses). We also use American Community Survey (ACS) data to determine whether there is any\n58 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nF I G U R E 4\n# o f arre sts\nyear\narres ts of 15-year-olds arrests of 16-year-olds\narres ts of 17-year-olds arrests of 18-year-olds\n# o f o f f e n d e r s\nye a r\n1 5-y e ar-o ld offe nde rs 1 6 -y e a r-old o ffe nd ers\n1 7-y e ar-o ld offe nde rs 1 8 -y e a r-old o ffe nd ers\n(a) (b)\nIncident-Level, Age-Specific Offender, and Arrestee Comparison\nTo address the unavailability of age-specific offending rates at the state level, we use Na-\ntional Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) incident-level data from participating\nchanges in the age-specific arrests are mirrored by changes in age-specific offending behavior\nor are better explained by changes in officer arrest or recording behavior (see Figure 4 for\na descriptive comparison). NIBRS data have been used previously to understand better\nthe connections among offenders, victims, and the resulting arrest events--connections\nthat were significantly more difficult to understand when only UCR data were available\noffender and arrestee age data has also been proposed and tested (Chilton and Jarvis, 1999),\nbut it has not been incorporated in the literature on the effects of criminal justice policies on\njuvenile offending, which has primarily relied on either self-reported offending information\nor official arrestee data.\nUnlike these other forms of data on offenders, the NIBRS data series contains an\nannual count of the ages of arrestees as well as estimated yearly ages of nonarrested offenders\nfor all Group A incidents, corresponding to Part I crimes in the UCR program. Nonarrest\noffender ages in the NIBRS data are derived from incident reports taken by police officers\nresponding to Group A incidents. As self-reported ages are not available, as they are for\nincidents leading to an arrest, suspect ages are generated from victim, officer, or other witness\nstatements. These age estimates are therefore subject to witness error, but the findings of\npast record check studies where both self-reported and victim-reported age estimates are\nevidence that birth cohort effects explain changes in age-specific crime and arrest patterns, a\nproposition that has no support in the data.\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\navailable have showed a high degree of correspondence (Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis,\n1981). More importantly for the present application, as long as the errors in witness age\nestimation are smooth across the age threshold of the policy shock, systematic errors in\nwitness age identification will not compromise our ability to draw inferences from the data.\nMore specifically, as there is no a priori reason to believe that victims or witnesses should\nchange their reporting of an offender's age to the police as a function of the policy shock,\nan abrupt change in the ages of offenders as identified by victims and witnesses constitutes\nevidence in favor of a change in age-specific offending. When using these data, changes in\nage-specific police arrest behavior can be separated from age-specific changes in offender\nbehavior. If age-specific arrest rates and age-specific offending rates change equally after the\nimplementation of an age-specific policy, then these changes likely reflect offender behavior\nwithout evidence of officer filtering behavior. If age-specific arrest rates and age-specific\noffending rates change unequally after the implementation of an age-specific policy, then\nsome combination of officer and offender behavioral change is likely present. The full set\nof possible interpretations of this inequality will be explored later in this article.\nTo estimate the effect of the 2010 law change for 16-year-olds on crime, we fit a\nleast-squares regression model by using monthly NIBRS Group A data for all Connecticut\nagencies that participated in the NIBRS program from 2008 through 2011. The model is\nestimated separately for age-specific incidents/offenses and age-specific arrests. The models\nare based on the following basic equation:\nln(Yat ) = 0\nIn Equation (2), ln(Yat ) is the logged number of arrests or offenses in month t for\nage group a. Time is a vector of the count of months from 1 to 48, and accordingly\n1 accounts for statewide time trends in arrests for either of the two omitted age groups\n(15 or 17). T2010 is a dummy variable indicating whether the month falls during or after\nwhile maintaining a common slopes assumption. The coefficient 3 captures the difference\nbetween the logged number of arrests or offenses for the 16-year-olds affected by the law\nchange and the omitted comparison ages (15 or 17). Finally, 1 provides an estimate of\nthe treatment effect of the law change for the 16-year-olds after the 2010 law change.\nFor simplicity, in Equation (2), time is modeled as a linear process; in practice, we also\nestimated the model more flexibly allowing time to vary according to a quadratic, cubic,\nand quartic time trend with similar results. For the estimation of these models, data are\nlimited to the years 2008 through 2011 for agencies participating for the full period. The\nregression described in Equation (2) is estimated four different times. In the first estimation,\nwe compare incidents involving 16-year-old offenders with incidents involving 15-year-old\noffenders to see whether their trajectories diverge after the law change. We next reestimate\nthis equation substituting incidents involving 17-year-old offenders for the 15-year-old\ncomparison group. To estimate the effect of the law change on age-specific arrest rates, we\n60 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nT A B L E 1\nDifferences-in-Differences Log Arrest Coefficient Estimates\nLog Incidents Log Arrests\nNote. Standard errors are in parentheses.\nthen substitute NIBRS juvenile arrest data covering the same period of time for the offender\ndata used in the first two comparisons. Equation (2) is then reestimated comparing 16-year-\nold arrestees with 15-year-old arrestees and, finally, 16-year-old arrestees with 17-year-old\narrestees.\nTable 1 reports regression-based estimates of the effect of raising the age of criminal\nmajority when using Connecticut NIRBS data. These models are estimated with the basic\nfunctional form represented in Equation (2). Estimates are presented for the 16-year-old\npolicy change by using NIRBS incident as well as arrest data. When referring to the Age 15\nmodel, which compares 16-year-old with 15-year-old offenders, we observe a near-zero and\ninsignificant effect of the law change on incidents using the D-D model (Column 1). When\ncomparing 16-year-olds with 17-year-olds (Column 2), the coefficient on the interaction,\nwhich estimates the D-D model, is slightly larger but still small and insignificant. Although\nthe number of incidents involving 16-year-old offenders is lower in 2010 than it was in\n2009, the change was not significantly different than the changes observed for incidents\nNext, we turn to the models that are used to estimate the effect of the law change\non the number of juvenile arrests. These models are presented in columns 3 and 4 of\nTable 1. Overall, the pattern of the coefficients is similar to those presented in columns 1\nand 2. Fifteen-year-olds have a significantly lower number of arrests in 2008 than do 16-year-\nolds who have a similarly lower number of arrests than do 17-year-olds. Implementation\nof the law change in 2010 does little to affect either age group, and coefficients for the\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nF I G U R E 5\nBridgeport East Hartford Hartford Manchester Meriden\nNew Britain New Haven Norwalk Stamford Waterbury\n# of arrests\nyear\narrests of 15-year-olds arrests of 16-year-olds\narrests of 17-year-olds arrests of 18-year-olds\ninteraction are in the mid-single digits and insignificant. As the estimates are similar to and\nnot statistically distinguishable from those we obtained for offending, there is little evidence\nthat patterns in the estimated treatment effects are driven by changes in police behavior.\nNevertheless, the large p values in each set of tests preclude us from formally testing to see\nwhether each set of coefficients is different from one another.\nGiven the many law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that are tasked with implementing\nthe new age of majority created by the 2010 law change, we also examine the arrest patterns\nfor the top ten law enforcement reporting agencies in the state of Connecticut (see Figure 5).\nThese included Bridgeport, East Hartford, Hartford, Manchester, Meriden, New Britain,\nNew Haven, Norwalk, Stamford, and Waterbury. Doing so enables us to assess the degree\nto which overall state estimates are uniformly generated by the major police agencies in\nthe state or whether these state estimates mask heterogeneity in the response of juveniles\nand/or police officers to these changes to the legal age of majority. For seven of the ten\nlargest agencies, the trends for each age group are similar and reveal little indication of a\ndiscontinuity for 16-year-old arrestees in 2010. New Haven provides the clearest evidence\nof a discontinuity for 16-year-olds in 2010, but this change is also paralleled by a drop for\n15-year-olds in the same year. Notably, Hartford and East Hartford each manifest unusual\npatterns of arrests in 2010. In the case of East Hartford, there is a noticeable drop in arrests\n62 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nsame time, the number of arrests for 15-year-olds correspondingly jumps and then returns\nto level--suggesting that some form of substitution process could be at work. The trends\nfor Hartford are even starker. Hartford's 16-year-old arrest trends manifest an immediate\nreduction in all but the most serious youthful arrests (for violence) in the period after the\n2010 law change--a drop-off that does not recover until 2012. This reduction, with its\nsharp and age-specific discontinuous drop in arrests followed by a full recovery to preexisting\ntrends pattern 2 years later, is much more consistent with a change in police arrest behavior\nthan is a change in juvenile offending.9 There is little reason to think that two successive\ncohorts of 16-year-olds stopped committing nearly all arrestable offenses within the city of\nHartford. But there is plenty of reason to believe, based on contemporaneous reporting,\nthat police officers might temporarily react to uncertainty of the new and still changing legal\nlandscape by not making arrests of 16-year-olds involved in nonviolent offenses (Backus,\n2011). Although our main results at the state level, as reported in Figures 2 and 3 and\nTable 1, are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of these cities, this agency-level variability\nindicates that not all jurisdictions had the same experience and that it will be much more\ndifficult to estimate the impact of raise the age for these jurisdictions.\nDiscussion\nThe results from recent research have shown that juveniles, including juvenile offenders,\ncontinue to mature well into their 20s. These findings, when coupled with related research\nshowing the adverse effects of prosecuting certain juvenile offenders as adults, have given\nrise to a multistate policy initiative to raise the legal age of majority in states with a sub-18\nage of majority. To date, several states have already enacted such changes, and legislatures\nin several more are actively considering doing so. Despite this considerable research and\npolicy-making agenda, the effects of these policy enactments to determine whether, as\nproponents of these policies have postulated, youthful crime will be diminished, or as\ncritics have feared, it will be exacerbated, have only been systematically evaluated in one\nprevious study (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Despite this limited available evidence,\nsome commentators have reasoned that policy changes were effective given continuing and\npossibly accelerating decline in juvenile arrests, particularly 16-year-olds after Connecticut's\nmodified age of majority went into effect in 2010 (Justice Policy Institute, 2013).\nTo assess this possibility, the present study examined how these observed changes\nin arrests for affected juveniles co-varied with national trends and age-specific juvenile\noffending rates within Connecticut. By using these two complementary approaches, we\n9. Although it is possible that this result might help explain why the drop in juvenile arrests for\nConnecticut as a whole observed in the synthetic control models was not mirrored in the micro-level\nanalysis, the exclusion of Hartford from the synthetic control models did not significantly change the\nresults of these models.\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nobserve that Connecticut experienced a sizable but temporary drop in their arrests of\n16-year-olds compared with other states, which was not mirrored by a change in the overall\nreported crimes for Connecticut versus other states. When looking more closely at these\npatterns, we observed that whereas the drop in juvenile arrests for 16-year-olds is larger than\nexpected based on the preexisting arrest trends for youthful offenders, when age-specific\noffending rates are available, it does not appear that these trends are present, at least to the\nsame degree. Finally, after exploring the heterogeneity across agencies within Connecticut,\nwe observed that although many agencies have age-specific arrest trends that show a steady\ndecline beginning in 2008, 2 years before the law change went into effect, at least one large\nagency has trends that sharply diverge after the 2010 law change only to converge again\ncirca 2012. This temporary drop was observed in a non-NIBRS reporting agency, which\ncould explain why this pattern was also observed in statewide synthetic control estimates but\nnot in the age-specific offender/arrest tests that rely on NIBRS information. These results\nsupport several conclusions.\nFirst, these results add to growing evidence that statutory boundaries between the\njuvenile and adult justice systems as well as changes to these boundaries have few observable\neffects on offender behavior (Hjalmarsson, 2009; Jensen and Metsger, 1994; Lee and\nof the absence of meaningful treatment differences or, consistent with other research on\njuvenile decision making, the insensitivity of juveniles to these incentives.\nSecond, these results suggest that for scholars studying the effects on criminal behavior,\nit is essential to look closely at the possible effects on official behavior--who gets arrested\nand, as findings from other research have shown, what they get arrested for. This article\nprovides some of the first empirical evidence that what may seem like changes in offending\nbehavior can result from changes in officer arrest behavior. As a result of the absence of age-\nspecific offending rates in many large municipalities, because of incomplete participation\nin the NIBRS program, the effects of age-specific policy changes will likely be difficult to\ndisentangle. Nevertheless, when information on arrestees and offenders is available, both\nmeasures should be examined.\nThird, the measurement of implementation fidelity is a key component of criminal\njustice evaluation. Given the observed heterogeneity in arrest trends by agency, reflecting\nthe implementation challenges noted contemporaneously with the policy change in 2010,\nit is clear that at least some agencies took an alternative approach to implementing the\nchange in the age of majority. This type of subjurisdictional variation in implementation\ndid not alter statewide results. Yet, in other evaluations of criminal justice policy, results\nmay be more highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of contributing jurisdictions with\nunexpected implementation patterns.\nFor the policy discussion in Connecticut, these results suggest that there is no discern-\nable effect of raising the age on crime or juvenile crime. Although there is some evidence of\nchanges in the number of arrests by age, the change in the age of majority was not the primary\n64 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\ndriver of declining juvenile crime rates, nor did the change halt these preexisting declines,\nas was initially feared. As such, the policy may have contributed to additional processing\ncosts without providing all of the anticipated cost-savings in the form of reduced recidivism.\nBeyond Connecticut, these results also suggest that public safety may not be the primary\nlens through which this policy initiative should be viewed (Brown, 2012; NCRSJJS, 2013;\nRubin, 2012). Even though this study is the first such study to include an examination of\n\"raise the age\" at the aggregate level and, therefore, to show no impact on the overall crime\nequation, it is the second study to show no impact on a measure of criminal offending\n(Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Future research on \"raise-the-age\" and other related policy\ninitiatives (e.g., juvenile decarceration) could usefully be focused on the nonpublic-safety\neffects of these policies. For example, little is known about the effects of shifting the age\nof majority on schooling or labor market outcomes, although Aizer and Doyle (2013)\nhave suggested that changes in juvenile justice processing or punishments could generate\nsubstantial increases in human capital among affected juveniles. This reaction could occur\ndespite the fact that many features of the juvenile justice system that are most obviously\ndifferent than the adult juvenile system, such as routine access to educational opportunities\nand limited dissemination of criminal history record information, are more directly tied to\nthese untested life-course outcomes rather than to the more commonly studied metrics of\ncrime and criminal recidivism.\nA final possible consequence of this finding is that the current policy focus on simply\nshifting juveniles between parallel justice systems may not be as impactful on juvenile crime\nas either proponents hoped or critics feared (Farrington et al., 2012). If this possibility\nis borne out, policy makers might consider an alternative strategy focused on identifying\nspecific elements of the juvenile justice system that have been shown to lower crime and\nthen pilot importation of these policies into the adult system or vice versa. The results from\nrecent research, for example, have found promising evidence that providing at-risk youth\nwith cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can have profound effects on future criminality\n(Heller, Pollack, Ander, and Ludwig, 2013). This focus on identifying specific practices that\nare beneficial to juveniles and making them available to juveniles regardless of the specific\njudicial system in which they are prosecuted reconciles the need to ensure juveniles receive\nadequate services with the emerging evidence that the distinction between juvenile and\nadult justice systems may be less meaningful than previously thought. Such an emphasis\non implementing age-specific policies irrespective of jurisdictional considerations echoes\nelements of past policy proposals to abolish the juvenile justice system altogether in favor\nof a system with age-appropriate policies and legal safeguards (Feld, 1997).\nDespite whether these alternative policies are adopted, we will soon have even more\nevidence of the effectiveness of the current \"raise-the-age\" policies. Massachusetts, New\nHampshire, and Illinois all raised their respective ages of majority to 18 in whole or in part\nin 2014. New York is currently considering doing so as well. And Connecticut, Illinois,\nand Vermont seem to be contemplating raising the age of legal majority from 18 to 21.\nResearch Article Raising the Age of Majority\nThis change is so large that existing estimates are of limited value in predicting their\npossible consequences. As studies of these recently or soon-to-be-enacted law changes are\nundertaken, similar or disparate results may be found. The policy differential between\nthe juvenile and adult justice systems in each of these jurisdictions may not be perfectly\nsubstitutable. Similarly, differences in the juvenile offending population could generate\ndifferent results. Even if the results reported here do not hold for other jurisdictions, careful\nattention to measurement issues is warranted and the methods demonstrated in this article\ncan be used to resolve many of the most common estimation challenges encountered in the\nevaluation of single-jurisdiction, age-specific policies.\nAppendix\nT A B L E A 1\nContributors to Connecticut's Synthetic Comparison Group\nState Arrests, Proportion of 16-Year-Olds Log Violent Crime Rate Log Property Crime Rate\nAK\nAL\nAR\nAZ\nCA\nFL\nGA\nHI\nID\nKS\nKY\nMA\nMD\nME\nMI\nMN\nNB\nNC\nNJ\nNM\nNV\n(Continued)\n66 Criminology & Public Policy\nLoeffler and Chalfin\nT A B L E A 1\nContinued\nState Arrests, Proportion of 16-Year-Olds Log Violent Crime Rate Log Property Crime Rate\nOH\nOR\nSC\nSD\nTN\nTX\nUT\nVA\nWI\nWY\nReferences\nAbadie, Alberto, Alexis Diamond, and Jens Hainmueller. 2010.
