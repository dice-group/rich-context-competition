The model has been tested in higher education sector. All the permanent\nteachers working in higher education sector were contacted. The data have been duly validated with the help of confirmatory\nfactor analysis (CFA). Reliability has been assessed through Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. Structural equation\nmodeling (SEM) has been used for hypotheses testing, and hierarchical regression has been used to test the moderating effect\nof RI. The results indicated that leader\u00admember exchange acts as a mediator and RI acts as a moderator instead of mediator.\nThe managerial implications and future scope have been discussed.\n",

Human\nresources are the valuable assets (Pareek & Rao, 2007),\nwhich are inimitable and can generate sustainable competi-\ntive advantage through innovative ideas (Barney, 1991;\nWard, Grudnoff, Brooker, & Simpson, 2013; Wernerfelt,\n1984). To keep them motivated for new innovations, one\nrequires people, who can manage/lead these human resources\nefficiently (Certo & Certo, 2006; Liaw, Chi, & Chuang,\ntext (Chou, Lin, Chang, & Chuang, 2013). Their leadership\nability helps in attaining and retaining the quality workforce\nreveals several styles of leadership, transformational leader-\nship (TL) is one of the most used styles in organizations to\nmanage the change (Kejriwal & Krishnan, 2004; Sarros &\nSantora, 2001). It helps to bring valuable and positive\nchanges among the followers by exhibiting the role model\ncharacteristics, providing intellectual motivation, and show-\ning individual concern for the followers (Shibru & Darshan,\nauthority and acts as a guide, mentor, and coach to enhance\nthe vision of the followers. It establishes quality relation-\nships between the two on the lines of social exchange theory\n(Carter, Jones-Farmer, Armenakis, Field, & Svyantek, 2009;\nLiden & Maslyn, 1998). As per exchange theory, when a per-\nson provides something of value to another person, it\nbecomes obligatory for the recipient to reciprocate (Blau,\n1964), which yields beneficial consequences for the follow-\ners such as trust (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Moorman, & Fetter,\n1990), career advancement (Dubinsky, Yammarino, &\nidentification (Humphrey, 2012; Juan, Malero, Topa, &\nNangin, 2011), job satisfaction (Mohammad, Zeaud, &\nBatayneh, 2011), and job performance (JP) (Geyer & Steyrer,\nit results in organizational commitment (Avolio, Zhu, Koh,\nzational citizenship behavior (Humphrey, 2012; Lian & Tui,\n1University of Jammu, India\nCorresponding Author:\nJeevan Jyoti, Assistant Professor, Department of Commerce, University of\nEmail: jyotigupta64@rediffmail.com\nImpact of Transformational\nLeadership on Job Performance:\nMediating Role of Leader\u00adMember\nExchange and Relational Identification\nJeevan Jyoti1 and Sonia Bhau1\n Keywords\ntransformational leadership, leader\u00admember exchange, RI, job performance, mediation, structural equation modeling, head\nof department\n2 SAGE Open\nWalumbwa & Hartnell, 2011). Many researchers like Bushra,\nUsman, and Naveed (2011), Dvir, Eden, Avolio, and Shamir\nHackett, Wang, and Chen (2005); and Yang, Melien, Chieh,\nand Yushin (2011) have identified direct impact of TL on JP.\nBut there are other researchers, who viewed that TL affects\nJP through other variables like trust (Gillespie & Mann,\n2011), collective efficacy (Walumbwa, Wang, Lawler, & Shi,\n2004), organizational citizenship behavior (Boerner,\nEisenbeiss, & Griesser, 2007), leader\u00admember exchange\nsecond notion is better as leaders create trust and confidence\namong the followers, which makes them perform better. The\npresent research also focuses on establishing indirect effect\nof TL on JP of employees through LMX and RI. The present\nstudy, therefore, proposes a research framework with the aim\nat investigating the mediating role of LMX and RI between\nTL and JP.\nConceptual Framework and\nHypotheses Development\nThe theoretical framework (Figure 1) has been developed on\nthe basis related review of literature. Burns (1978) conceptual-\nized TL, which was further extended by Bass (1985), and Bass\nand Avolio (1994). They proposed full-range theory of leader-\nship, which consists of transformational, transactional, and\nlaissez-faire. Transformational leaders encourage followers to\nexert and explore existing as well as new horizons. They are\nproactive and help followers to attain unexpected goals\n(Antonakis, Avolio, & Sivasubramaniam, 2003). They move\nfollowers beyond immediate self-interest (Bass, 1999). This\ntype of leadership is an important antecedent to construct the\ncollective confidence or strength required by groups to be suc-\ncessful when facing with difficult challenges (Bass & Avolio,\n2003). TL can create significant organizational change and act\nas change agents, foster higher level of intrinsic motivation\nand loyalty among followers, and introduce a new image or\nview of the future and create a commitment to this image\namong followers (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2008).\nThe LMX theory focuses on the relationship or interac-\ntion between both leaders and followers. \"The interaction/\nexchanges, both in content and process are defined as the\nindividual dyadic linkage\" (Jensen, Olberding, & Rodgers,\ncharacteristics. Leaders not only have individual relation-\nships with each of their followers, but the relationship is\nunique and viewed as a series of vertical dyads (Stringer,\n2006). Furthermore, \"the heart of each dyadic relationship is\nthe concept of a role-making process, or role negotiation pro-\ncess\" (Carter et al., 2009, p. 2). The role expectations of a\nleader and the extent to which the subordinates meet those\nexpectations make up the relational context of the exchange\nTse & Lam, 2008). LMX depends upon the level of trust,\ninteraction, support, and rewards, which determines the qual-\nity of the relationship.\nRelational identification is one of three components of\nthe identification theory (self identity, collective identity,\nand relational identity). \"It is the degree to which one\nincludes the role relationship in one's self-concept\" (Aron &\nself in terms of a given role relationship and offers a new\nway to understand the unique supervisor-subordinate rela-\ntionship\" (Sluss & Ashforth, 2007, p. 11). Furthermore, it is\ngenerally argued to be a psychological healthy relational\nstate, fostering empathy, liking, cooperation, and in-role and\nextra-role performance. However, extreme RI can foster\nnegative outcomes such as co-dependency and collusion in\nco-operative behavior.\nPerformance is the function of knowledge, skills, abilities,\nand motivation directed at role-prescribed behavior, such as a\nformal job responsibilities. Job performance reflects the com-\npletionoftherole/taskallocatedtoaparticularperson/employee.\nResearch has indicated that JP is a multi-dimensional construct\nconsisting of task and contextual performance (Motowidlo &\nTL, LMX, and Job Performance\nTransformational leaders' behavior is linked to a variety of\naffective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes. They help their\nfollowers to become future leaders by acting as change agents\nLMX and found that those studies have focused on social\nexchange quality in dyad. This phenomenon helps to estab-\nlish qualitative leader\u00adfollower relationship known as LMX\n(Gerstner & Day, 1997). Furthermore, LMX is interpersonal\nFigure 1. Theoretical framework.\nJyoti and Bhau 3\nexchange of relationships between the leader and each fol-\nlower. According to LMX theory, leader\u00adfollower relation-\nship may be of a high or low quality (Graen & Uhl-Bien,\n1995). In high-quality LMX, the leader and member will\nexchange mutual trust, support, loyalty professional respect,\nwork contribution, and understanding. Therefore, followers\ngain numerous benefits, including effective communication,\naccess to the leader support, trust, approval, consideration,\nautonomy, and favorable job assignments (Graen & Uhl-\nBien, 1995). According to social exchange theory, followers\nare more likely to exchange these benefits with their leaders\nand organizations (Liden, Sparrowe, & Wayne, 1997) in the\nform of efficient JP. Empirical studies have revealed that high\nquality of LMX enhances organizational commitment\n(Ansari, Lee, & Aafaqi, 2007), job satisfaction (Fisk &\nFriesen, 2012), organizational citizenship behavior (Asgari,\nSilong, Ahmad, & Abu-Sama, 2008), creative behavior (Basu\n& Green, 1997), and employee performance (Erdogan &\nEnders, 2007). Furthermore, TL is a process whereby ordi-\nnary people can bring forth the best in themselves and others\ntoo. Transformational leader is able to motivate and satisfy\ntheir followers (Givens, 2008) with their helpful, friendly\nnature. They act as change agents by using friendly approach\nfrequently (Krishnan, 2004). Transformational leaders estab-\nlish high-quality relationship with their followers by citing\nappropriate examples and giving individualized attention,\nwhich encourages followers to work in better way to achieve\norganizational goals (Graen, 1976). Effective leaders express\ntheir transformational behaviors within a personal dynamic\nrelational exchange context. Transformational leaders, who\nare insensitive to the importance of follower's reciprocity\nexpectations and the relational requirements of a high-quality\nrelationship (e.g., reciprocity, personal development, and\nsocial bonding), are likely to be less effective. It is through\ndevelopment of stronger dyadic social bonds (Wang, Law, &\nChen, 2008) that transformational leaders make the followers\nto perform better (Wang et al., 2005). Based on the arguments\nand evidences above, this study, therefore, proposes that\nLMX mediates the TL\u00adJP relationship.\nHypothesis 1a: TL leads to positive LMX.\nHypothesis 1b: LMX positively affects JP.\nHypothesis 1c: LMX mediates the relationship between\nTL and JP.\nTL, Relational Identification With\nLeader, and Job Performance\nTL is a process whereby ordinary people can bring forth the\nbest in themselves and others too. TL exhibits four types of\nbehaviors, that is, behavioral charisma, inspirational motiva-\ntion, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consider-\nation. Charisma arouses strong follower emotions and leader\nidentification by the follower (Dvir et al., 2002). It has been\nfound that the TL enhances followers' development.\nRelational identification occurs when people adopt attitudes\nand behaviors to be associated with a satisfying, self-defining\nrelationship with another person or group. Transformational\nleaders develop RI with their followers through their behav-\nioral and idealized charisma, which makes followers to iden-\ntify with their leader. The personalized relationship between\ntransformational leader and followers' create an environment\nin which the followers' feel happy to work with their leader.\nThe transformational leaders act as an ideal or role model for\nthe follower with whom the follower likes to be identified\n(Dasborough & Ashkanasy, 2002). The characteristics of\ntransformational leaders make them adorable and their fol-\nlowers like to be identified with them. According to Sluss and\nRelational identification is a result of interpersonal affairs,\nwhich focuses on one's role relatedness, whereby a follower\ndefines him or herself in terms of a given role relationship.\nRelational identification (RI) expands the follower's sense about\nhimself/herself; provide psychological and relational benefits.\nPeople with strong relational identities are motivated to fulfill\ntheir partner's/leader's role expectations (Broderick, 2006),\nwhich enhances their JP. Furthermore, those followers' who\nhave better understanding of their role relationships will give\nhigh-level performance. Hence, better the role relationships\nbetter will be the JP (Wang et al., 2008). TL will help subor-\ndinate to develop RI with supervisor/leader, because such\nleaders serve as exemplary role models, articulate a compel-\nling vision and communicate high-performance expectations\n(Charisma), and provide emotional appeal, meaning, and\nchallenge to their followers (inspirational motivation). They\npay specialized attention to their followers' needs expecta-\ntions and development (individualized consideration) and\nguide them to look at issues from different perspectives (intel-\nlectual stimulation) too. Moreover, theory and research also\nsuggest that transformational leaders motivate followers to\nidentify with the importance of their work and stress the\nimportance and values associated with desired outcomes in\nways that are more easily understood by the followers, while\nsimultaneously setting high-performance standards (Bass,\n1985). Hence, identification resulting from associating with\nsuch leaders is likely to have a positive effect on follower's\nperformance (Dumdum, Lowe, & Avolio, 2002; Lowe &\nSivasubramaniam, 1996). Thus, it is believed that a transfor-\nmational leader may play an important role in enhancing fol-\nlowers RI with the leader because the influence of such\nleaders are based on their success in connecting their follow-\ner's level of self-concept or identity with role relationship\n(Kark & Shamir, 2002). Further effective leaders express\ntheir transformational behaviors within a personal dynamic\nrelational exchange context. By developing stronger social\nbonds, transformational leaders affect followers'performance\n4 SAGE Open\ntional connection or identification between the supervisor and\nthe follower in such a way that follower feels more confident\nto perform beyond expectations. Thus, RI resulting from\nassociating with such leaders is likely to have a positive effect\non follower's performance.\nHypothesis 2a: TL is a significant predictor of RI.\nHypothesis 2b: Higher the RI better is the JP.\nHypothesis 2c: Relational identification mediates the\nrelationship between TL and JP.\nData Collection\nThe population comprised the teachers working in Higher\neducation sector (Government Degree Colleges) in Jammu\ndistrict (J&K, India). Contractual teachers were not con-\ntacted because their tenure is not enough to generate associa-\ntion with leader. So, permanent teachers with work experience\nof more than 1 year were contacted for data generation as\nRhodes, Spencer, Keller, Liang, and Noan (2006) viewed\nthat work experience/longevity of relationship helps the fol-\nlowers to better understand their leader and establish mutual\nrelationships. Furthermore, only those departments in the\ncolleges were contacted/covered, which consisted of at least\ntwo teachers (one head of department [HOD] and one fellow\nteacher). Ten degree colleges were contacted, which were\nfound relevant for the study. Eleventh college was excluded\nas there were no permanent teachers.

Two\nsets of questionnaires were used to collect the data. The\ninformation regarding TL, LMX, and RI was procured from\nthe teachers, and HODs provided information regarding the\nJP of the teachers as well as LMX. The difference in percep-\ntion regarding LMX of the HODs and teachers was checked\nwith the help of independent t test, and the results revealed\nPerformance of more than one teacher was procured from\nHOD, which can cause the problem of dependence of data\n(Hofmann, 1997). So to check whether the JP rating by the\nHODs is independent or not, ANOVA has been applied and\nresults revealed insignificant difference (F = 2.26, p > .05). It\nreveals that the data do not have dependence problem.\nMeasures\nA 7-point Likert-type scale has been used for the sake of\nuniformity in measuring the variables. The scales ranged\nfrom very strongly disagree (1) to very strongly agree (7).\nThe items were also improvised as per requirement of the\nsector. The instruments used to measure research vari-\nables are described below.\nTL\nTwenty-five-item scale adapted from Bass and Avolio\nbeen used to measure the four aspects of TL, that is, ideal-\nized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimu-\nlation, and individualized consideration. The idealized\ninfluence was measured through 11 items, inspirational\nmotivation and intellectual stimulation through 5 items\neach, and individualized consideration through 4 items. The\nsample item from idealized influence was \"I feel proud to be\nassociated with my HOD.\" A sample item from inspirational\nmotivation was \"She or he is a symbol of success and\naccomplishment.\" A sample item from intellectual stimula-\ntion was \"Suggests new ways of looking at how to complete\ntasks assigned.\" A sample item from individualized consid-\neration was \"Appreciates for good job.\" Cronbach's alpha\ncoefficient was .90, which exceeds the recommended level\nLMX\nIt has been measured through 16 items and adapted from\nLiden and Maslyn (1998). The four dimensions of LMX,\nnamely, affect, loyalty, contribution, and professional\nrespect, have 4 items each. A sample item from affect was \"It\nis fun to work with my HOD.\" A sample item for loyalty was\n\"Come to my defense if I were attacked by others.\" A sample\nitem from contribution was \"I do not mind working my hard-\nest for my HOD.\" A sample item from professional respect\nwas \"I admire his or her professional skills.\" Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient was .85.\nRelational Identification\nTen-items scale by Walumbwa and Hartnell (2011) has been\nused to measure RI. A sample item from RI was \"When\nsomeone criticizes my HOD, it feels like an insult to me.\"\nThe value of Cronbach's alpha was .80.\nJob Performance\nIt has been measured through task and contextual perfor-\nmance. Fourteen items for task performance have been gen-\nerated from Goodman and Svyantek (1999) and Farh and\nCheng (1997). A sample item from task performance was\n\"She or he concentrates and tries her or his best on every\nassignment.\" Motowidlo and Van Scotter's (1994) 5-items\nscale was used to measure contextual performance. A sample\nitem from contextual performance was \"She or he volunteers\nto carry out tasks/activities that are not formally part of the\njob.\" Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .89.\nJyoti and Bhau 5\nResults\nDemographic Profile\nThe descriptive statistics indicated that out of 206, about\n63% are females. Majority of respondents (51%) are in the\nexperience of 11 to 15 years. About 48% teachers are doctor-\nate of philosophy, 50% are assistant professors followed by\nciation with HOD as colleague for a period up to 5 years.\nWhereas, majority of the teachers (63.24%) are associated\nwith HOD as subordinate for a period up to 4 years and 68\n(36.75%) had a period of association for more than 3 years\n(Table 1).\nReliability and Validity Analysis\nMeasurement models have been designed to access the con-\nvergent validity. Second order factor models were prepared\nfor multi-dimensional constructs (TL, LMX, and JP), and\nfirst order factor model has been designed for RI construct\n(Table 2). Items with loading less than 0.50 have been deleted\n(Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009). Convergent validity\nhas been established through standardized estimates (stan-\ndard regression weight [SRW] > 0.5) and average variance\nextracted (AVE > 0.05; Table 4). To check discriminant\nvalidity, four-factor and one-factor models have been\ndesigned, and the results revealed that the goodness of fit of\nfour-factor model (2/df = 2.37, root mean square residual\ngoodness-of-fit index [AGFI] = 0.90, confirmatory fit index\n[CFI] = 0.93, root mean square error of approximation\n[RMSEA] = 0.08) is better than one-factor model (2/df =\nnant validity. Further discriminant validity has also been\nestablished by comparing AVE with squared correlation. The\nAVE for all constructs is greater than squared correlation\nthereby establishing discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker,\nTo check the internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha has\nbeen used as it is the indicator of the reliability of the con-\nstruct (Cronbach, 1951).

Thus, the\nCronbach's alpha and composite construct reliability indi-\ncate that the scales are quite reliable.\nImpact of TL on Job Performance: Mediating Role\nof LMX\nStructural equation modeling (SEM) has been used to check\nvarious relations proposed, it is a multivariate technique that\nseeks to explain the relationship among multiple variables\n(Kaplan, 2000). In the present study, the relationship between\nTL, LMX, and JP have been assessed. To test the mediating\neffect, all the conditions described by Baron and Kenny\n(1986) were first satisfied. These are as follows: (a) the rela-\ntionship between independent variable (TL) and dependent\nvariable (JP) should be significant (SRW = 0.40; Figure 2),\n(b) the relationship between independent (TL) and mediator\n(LMX) should be significant (SRW = 0.94; Figure 3), (c) the\nrelationship between the mediator (LMX) and outcome (JP)\nshould also be significant (SRW = 0.35; Figure 4), and (d)\nwhen the mediator (LMX) is entered into the equation, that\nis, relationship between independent (TL) and dependent\nvariable (JP) becomes insignificant (SRW = 0.03). All the\nconditions of mediation as stated were fulfilled. This indi-\ncates that LMX act as a mediator between TL and JP.\nFurthermore, to check the significance of indirect effect,\nSobel (1982) test was applied through Sobel software. The\nvalue of Sobel statistic was significant (Sobel statistics =\nthe relationship between TL and JP (Figure 5). Furthermore,\ncontrol variables were also included in the model, which\nyielded no change in the previous relationships, so they were\nnot shown in the diagram. The model fitness of full media-\ntion model is better as compared with no mediation and par-\ntial mediation model (Table 5). Further application of\nchi-square delta test revealed significant difference between\nImpact of TL and Job Performance: Mediating\nRole of Relational Identification\nTo test the mediating effect, all the conditions described by\nBaron and Kenny (1986) were first satisfied. We used four-step\nprocedure through SEM in which we first assessed the impact of\npredictor, that is, TL on dependent variable, that is, JP, which is\nsignificant (SRW = 0.40, p < .001). Hence, first condition of\nmediation is accepted as TLis positively affecting JP(Figure 2).\nIn the second step, we studied the impact of TL on RI\nNext, the impact of mediator (RI) on dependent variable\n(JP) has been assessed, which is significant (SRW = 0.30,\nTo test the mediating effect, in the last step, we added the\nmediating variable, that is, RI between TL and JP. It was\nfound that with the introduction of RI as mediator in TL\u00adJP\nequation, the relationship between TL and JP significantly\nincreased (SRW = 0.45, p < .001)) instead of becoming insig-\nnificant, thereby yielding no support for mediation (Figure 8).\nFurthermore, the Sobel Test also revealed insignificant indi-\nrect effect (Sobel Statistics 1.02, p > .05), so the ultimate con-\ndition for mediation is not fulfilled. Hence, the RI does not\nmediate the TL and JP relationship.\nAn increase in the direct relation between TL and JP, after\nthe introduction of RI, gave the clue relating to moderating\nrole of RI. So, the moderation effect has been checked\nTable 2. Model Summary of CFA.\nNote.

It is a technique which is\nused to understand a relationship between an outcome vari-\nable (also called dependent variable) and the predictor vari-\nable (also called independent variable; Uekawa, 2010). To\ncheck moderation, hierarchical regression analysis has been\nused to explore the relationship between the variables. In the\nfirst model, two control variables, namely, association with\nHOD and association with HOD as a colleague, were entered\nin the regression analysis, which revealed insignificant\nimpact of both the variables (Table 6). In the second model,\nTL was added as independent variable, which gave signifi-\ncant result. The R2 and f change-statistics were better than the\nfirst model. In the third model, along with TL and control\nvariable, RI was also added as independent variable; the\nresult revealed insignificant impact of RI on JP ( = .06,\np > .05) fulfilling another condition of moderation. Finally in\nthe last model, the interaction effect of TL and RI was added,\nwhich yielded significant result ( = .30, p < .001). This sat-\nisfied the last conditions of moderation. Furthermore, the\nvalue of R2 increased from .08 to .25. The results derived\nfrom final step provided full support for the moderation\n(Table 6).\nFurthermore, the effect size of the interaction has also\nbeen calculated by using the formula given by Chin,\nThe effect size\ninteraction model main effect\nf\n=\n( ) - ( )\n\n\n\n\n\n( )\nR2 interaction model\n.\nFigure 2.

Thus, the interaction effect size is .10. This\neffect, as per Chin et al. (1996), is considered to be between\nsmall to medium effect size.\nFurthermore, the inspection of simple slope revealed that\nhigh-RI strengthens the relationship and vice versa (Figure 9).\nHence, all the hypotheses proposed in study are accepted,\nexcept one, that is, Hypothesis 2c (Table 7).\nDiscussion\nThe focus of the study is to identify the role of LMX and RI\nbetween TL and JP equation. Furthermore, direct relation-\nships between TL, LMX, RI, and JP were also assessed\nwhich were found significant. First, the results of the study\nindicated that TL significantly affects LMX, which is consis-\ntent with the previous studies (Dvir et al., 2002; Givens,\n2008). Transformational leaders establish high-quality rela-\ntionships with their followers by providing them friendly and\nfair treatment. LMX affects the JP of subordinates (Jensen\net al., 1997). Because of qualitative exchange of relation-\nships (LMX), the JP of followers is enhanced. It is found that\nthose teachers, who are loyal and ethical (part of LMX) in\nnature, perform better. They contribute more in terms of\nachieving the goals of the department and the organization.\nFurthermore, LMX mediates the TL and JP relationship.\nVarious characteristics of transformational leaders, namely,\nidealized influence, intellectual stimulation, inspirational\nmotivation, and individualized consideration, help in creat-\ning better relationships with the followers, which motivate\nthe employees for better performance (Dubinsky et al.,\n1995). The idealized influence increases the professional\nrespect for the leader. The followers accept them as their role\nmodels and achieve higher goals by exhibiting superior per-\nformance. The motivational behavior of leaders also inspires\nthe followers to achieve the organizational goals (Stewart,\n2006). Moreover, transformational leaders show individual\nconcern for each of their followers to solve their work- and\nlife-related problems, which helps in developing positive\nrelations, and the followers readily do the work as desired by\nleader (Bodla & Nawaz, 2010). Under the supervision of\nsuch leaders, the subordinates feel happy and are motivated\nto work hard. The results of mediation are in line with previ-\nalso found that TL is a significant predictor of RI. The results\nare consistent with previous studies (Dasborough &\nAshkanasy, 2002). The working style of transformational\nleaders (mentoring, guiding, coaching, emotional support,\nand developing followers to be future leaders) creates a con-\ngenial work environment for the followers, and they like to\nbe identified with such leaders. The leader becomes role\nmodel for the follower, who is likely to be influenced more\nby such leader (Sluss & Ashforth, 2007). The leaders, who\nfollow the rules and regulations of the organization, become\nrespectable in eyes of subordinates, and hence, subordinates\nFigure 6. Impact of TL on RI.\nNote.

RI = relational identification; TL = transformational leadership; JP =\njob performance.\nJyoti and Bhau 9\nfeel proud in being associated with such kind of leader.\nFurthermore, while checking mediation model of RI, the\nrelationship between RI and JP became insignificant, which\nwas prior significant when relationships were checked indi-\nvidually proving that RI does not mediate the TL and JP rela-\ntionship. Instead of mediator, RI act as a moderator (Table 6).\nIt is inferred that in the presence of TL, RI does not influence\nJP directly, but its interaction with TL significantly affects JP.\nThe RI strengthens the relationship of TL and JP. It helps\nleaders to establish role clarity and empathy (part of RI)\namong the followers, which instill confidence and trust in\nthem and they work whole heartedly to meet leaders'\nexpectations.\nConclusion\nThis study is an insight into getting a more appropriate model\nrelating to TL in the higher education sector. The role of\nLMX and RI in between TL and JP has been determined. It\nhas been found that LMX acts as a mediator. It makes the\nsubordinates work more efficiently as it creates better under-\nstanding among the followers and the leaders. Furthermore,\nit leads to clear role relationships between the leader and fol-\nlowers, which ultimately helps both to have a good working\nrelationship. In presence of LMX, leaders would be able to\ninfluence the ability of the follower to work efficiently for\norganization, which ultimately enhances his or her JP.\nFurthermore, the RI does not act as a mediator between the\nTL and JP relationship, but it act as a moderator and\nstrengthen the relationship between TL and JP. So the lead-\ners/managers should give due consideration to develop posi-\ntive LMX with their subordinates and act as role model to\ndevelop role identification to make them better performer.\nGeneral Implications\nManagers need to pay close attention to the opinions and\nmoods engendered within their relationships with subordi-\nnates. Managers should focus on creating an environment in\nwhich personal work goals of the subordinates are linked\nwith organizational goals with the help of role-person inte-\ngration. Managers should make their decisions more trans-\nparent by exhibiting consistency in their logic and reasoning.\nRemaining impartial in decision making will help managers\nto instill trust and respect in the minds of subordinates.\nManagers should create more enthusiasm and optimism\namong the employees. The belief in employees that \"they\ncan do it\" helps them realize their potential with more confi-\ndence and inspires them to try harder. Besides maintaining\ngood relationships with subordinates, managers should rec-\nognize their contributions either through verbal or written\nmode, for example, recognition by top management should\nbe given to efficient employees by giving them awards and\ncertificates. Managers should make employees to think out\nof box to generate new ideas for enhancing JP.\nPractical Implications\nTo make working of teachers effective, the HODs can use\nfollowing implications. HOD should provide coaching and\nTable 6. Result of Hierarchical Regression.\nVariables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nInteraction (TL \u00d7 RI) .30***\nNote.

RI = relational identification; JP = job performance; TL =\ntransformational leadership.\nmentoring to move them on the ladder of development,\nwhich will show an increased level of commitment, motiva-\ntion, satisfaction, and performance among them such as he or\nshe should follow the timetable framed, remain punctual,\ncomplete his or her own tasks in time, and take his or her\nown lecture in time. The HOD must agree with the opinion\nof the subordinates when they come with sound logic and\nreasoning, so they can feel confident and transform into\nfuture leaders. Participative decision making should be\nencouraged and the leader should create open atmosphere in\nthe staffroom and meetings so that everybody gets involved\nin discussions, and a healthy atmosphere leads to increased\nmorale of fellow teachers to work hard for attaining the\ndepartment goals. HOD should work toward creating good-\nquality relationships with fellow teachers, which will make\nthem feel better, accomplish more, and help their organiza-\ntion to prosper. Both the HOD and the fellow teachers are\nrequired to work in cooperation, which can be possible when\nboth have clarity regarding their roles. Clarity of role rela-\ntionships will reduce conflicts. The HOD should make\nproper proposals for the arrangement of workshops for the\nenhancement of skills, seminars, where subordinates can\nlearn about their career-related growth and development per-\nspectives. The leader should assess about the performance\nand attitude of followers by having continuous interactions\nwith them after completion of tasks assigned. Through this\nhe would be able to get an idea about the behavior and work-\ning ability of the subordinate.\nLimitation and Future Research\nThis study represents a cross sectional investigation as\nresponses were gathered from respondents at a particular\npoint of time. Moreover, the study is confined to government\ndegree colleges operating in Jammu district only. Due to pri-\nvacy involved, respondents might have been reluctant to\nshare correct information due to their defensive attitude. The\nelement of subjectivity might have not been checked com-\npletely as teachers have responded on the basis of their own\nexperience and perceptions regarding the statements in the\nquestionnaire. In future, longitudinal study can be conducted.\nComparative study between private and public colleges can\nbe undertaken in future. Furthermore, leadership effective-\nness with non-teaching staff can also be measured. More out-\ncomes can be taken into account, for example, cultural\ndifferences, other leadership styles, and so on for better\nunderstanding of the concept.\nAuthors' Note\nBoth authors have contributed equally.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnsari, M.
