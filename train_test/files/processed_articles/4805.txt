In 2008, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) began offering a 10-year accreditation\nwith a Continuous Improvement Progress Report (CIPR) at the fifth year. This article focuses on an in-depth analysis of a\nsystem in which the school of nursing utilized an ad hoc committee to complete the CIPR. Reports generated by the ad hoc\ncommittee concluded that need for improvement was warranted related to policy review. An action plan for continuous\ncompliance generated implementation of policy software and the creation of an academic support specialist position. An ad\nhoc committee completed the CIPR rather than paying faculty overload hours; policy was an exemplar. Faculty development,\nteam performance, and accountability resulted in a plan for continual compliance that can be adopted in other nursing\nschools to meet CCNE accreditation.\n",

The knowledge of\nthe time commitment required and the importance of posi-\ntive outcomes for a nursing program can result in sleepless\nnights and long days for those involved in preparing for\naccreditation. The accreditation process requires signifi-\ncant self-assessment and peer evaluation; this process\nresults in ensuring the quality of a nursing program and\nidentifying areas of improvement. In addition, the program\nevaluation data need to be collected on a regular basis\n(Lewallen, 2015). An ongoing course of action assists fac-\nulty and administration with engagement and enhances the\nenvironment for quality improvement over time (Ellis &\nHalstead, 2012). Promotion of faculty engagement and\nknowledge of components of the accreditation process such\nas curricular review is paramount to the necessity of the\ncontinuous process and the ownership by the faculty\n(Dearmon, Lawson, & Hall, 2011). The purpose of this arti-\ncle is to describe the challenge of and practical approaches\nto the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education\n(CCNE) accreditation and/or Continuous Improvement\nProgress Report (CIPR) processes. From this description,\nother universities, schools of nursing, or departments can\nutilize the approaches in their accreditation practices.\ntation with a CIPR due at the 5-year mark. Our school of\nnursing (SON) received a 10-year accreditation in 2009, with\nan interim report due in December 2014. While much prepa-\nration, energy, and time are usually placed on the process and\nwriting of the self-study, the \"interim reporting that is\nrequired in between the comprehensive site visit may be less\nfashion to many nursing programs, thoughts of accreditation\nwere placed on the \"back burner\" while dealing with changes\nin our SON.

In response to the newly revised\nstandards, it was determined based on program growth that an\naggressive approach to adoption needed to be the plan of\naction. The practical aspects of accomplishing this plan of\naction are limited in the literature (Lewallen, 2015).\nSince 2009, our program has demonstrated significant\ngrowth, including modification from a four- to a five-semes-\nter program. In addition, enrollment has now essentially\ndoubled with admissions of about 60 students each fall and\nspring semesters. The number of faculty has increased by\nnine, most of whom have never been involved in a CIPR\nself-study. It was decided to make the self-study an ongoing\nprocess. As a result of this decision, it was determined there\nwas a need to revise the program effectiveness plan (PEP) to\ndemonstrate continuous evaluation. As the CIPR report\nneeded to be written utilizing newly published standards, an\nAccreditation and Policy/Procedure Ad Hoc Committee was\nestablished to complete this task.\nBackground\nOver the past 30 years, the SON has maintained accredita-\ntion status with positive outcomes. The school has grown in\nthe number of students and admission cycles as well as\ncourse and graduate offerings. The SON found that what\nworked in the past for the accreditation process needed to be\naltered based on the changes in the size and strategic plan of\nthe SON and the university. Current practices needed to\nchange from an informal review to a more formal review.\nHistorically, the SON had relied heavily on two writers\nfor preparation of the CIPR. It was typical for one senior\nfaculty member to be given workload release to assist the\ndean in this process. The traditional preparation for the report\nincluded an exhaustive retrospective review and audit of\npolicies, procedures, committee minutes, and outcomes data\nfrom several prior annual reports. This method was often\ntedious as it often uncovered (a) policies that were in need of\nreview/revision, (b) data that had to be extrapolated from\nvarious sources and data owners, (c) outcomes data that had\nlack of clear definition, and (d) less than optimal nonelec-\ntronic record-keeping systems that had proven difficult to\nnavigate. Where in the past, universities and schools\ndepended on one or two administrators to write accreditation\nreports, the trend is now more appropriate to use dedicated\nfaculty and/or faculty committees, staff, and administrative\npositions for the functions of program evaluation and accred-\nitation (Romanelli, 2013). Because of these hurdles and\nevolving trends, and with the new CCNE standards focus on\ncontinual compliance, the ad hoc committee was formed to\nidentify new methods and systems to modify the CIPR pro-\ncess using a team approach and putting in place new systems\nfor the future that would support continual compliance. In\naddition, this committee was also responsible for program\nevaluation and oversight for policy and procedure formation\nand dissemination. The purpose for a program evaluation\ncommittee allows ease of accreditation visit reports such as\nthe CIPR, focuses on readiness for changes in the program\nand/or curriculum, sustains consistency in curricular issues,\nand continues currency in nursing and educational trends\n(Gard, Flannigan, & Cluskey, 2004). A program evaluation\ncommittee has been described as being responsible for\n(a) development, implementation, and revision of the program\nevaluation plan; (b) recommending data collection instruments\nand procedures relating to program evaluation; (c) data\ncollection and analysis; and (d) reporting findings to the\ndepartment chair and program committee to facilitate program\nFormation/Development of Ad Hoc\nCommittee\nWhile the past accreditations were maintained by one to two\nkey faculty/administrators, the current process needed to\nactively involve input from an ad hoc committee and from\nindividual faculty and staff to ensure a strategic move toward\ncontinuous compliance. In addition to the key focus on CIPR\ncompletion, the newly formed ad hoc committee quickly\ndetermined that it must also encompass oversight of policy\nand procedure management. The Accreditation and Policy/\nProcedure committee was sanctioned as an ad hoc committee\nof the Faculty Organization (FO) and was charged to oversee\nand guide each committee regarding structure and function\nin relationship to the PEP.\nThe new Accreditation and Policy/Procedure Ad hoc\nCommittee began 1 year and one semester prior to the CIPR\ndeadline. In addition, the ad hoc committee met weekly to\nbiweekly for the first few months after it was established.\nThe ad hoc committee was comprised of four full-time fac-\nulty members and a staff support person. The initial goal to\nconduct a needs analysis proved difficult as there was little\npast analysis. The first task undertaken was to ensure equal\neducation to all team members in the CIPR process. This\npreparation was completed by group attendance at an online\nwebinar. The ad hoc committee also reviewed the 2013\nCCNE Accreditation Standards (CCNE, 2013b) and used the\nCrosswalk (CCNE, 2013a) to review the changes/differences\nstandards provided all team members with the historical\nnature of standards and compliance.\nThe ad hoc committee then conducted an evaluation of\nthe completion status for all plan items of the Evaluation of\nProgram Plan (which became the Program Evaluation Plan)\nfrom the last survey report. Members reviewed each item\nplanned for in the prior report to determine whether all action\nplans were completed, modified, or still in process. Next, the\nanalysis focused on a complete policy and procedure review\nfor the faculty and student handbooks. It was determined that\nHanna et al. 3\nduring this phase of analysis that a set structure would be\nutilized to specifically identify (a) date of last review, (b) any\nitems within the policy or procedure that needed revision, (c)\nwhich standing committee of the FO should be assigned and\nbe responsible for content for the particular document, (d)\nwho the actual document owner (by name) would be, and (e)\nrecommendations regarding policy structure, content, or\noverlap between policies (which could be a source of error).\nAt the conclusion of these two analysis methods, a report\nwas provided to the FO Committee outlining status of each\nprior action plan and global state of the policies/procedures\nfor both manuals.\nFinally, an analysis of all outcome measures (student, fac-\nulty, and external) was conducted. This review uncovered\nmany areas for improvement in relation to data definitions,\ndata ownership responsibilities, data storage methods, and\naccuracy. As a result, it was determined that it would be key\nto establish strict data definitions in outcome measures and\nto optimally design a new data warehousing system approach.\nOutcomes of the Review of the Ad Hoc\nCommittee\nThe ad hoc committee concluded that there was significant\nneed for improvement regarding the currency and review of\npolicies along with lack of a precise mechanism for policy/\nprocedure generation. Further work from this point centered\non development of a precise mechanism/algorithm by which\npolicies moved from writing to committee review/approval,\nto actual implementation within electronic documents, to the\nwebsite links. As expected, several policies had been revised\nand/or approved that had not gone along the general accepted\nmechanism. In response to these findings, as well as data\nprecision and storage flaws, the ad hoc committee concluded\nthat modifications were indicated to move from a reactive\nmodel to a proactive, systematic compliance model.\nAction Plan for Continuous Compliance\nModel\nA search for policy/procedure software products was initi-\nated by the ad hoc committee. Committee members were\nunable to locate a product designed specifically for nursing\nschools. Discussion ensued regarding different software\nsystems within health care. The ad hoc committee reviewed\nthese systems to explore their functionality and then\nrequested a demonstration of one of the products,\nPolicyTechTM (Navex Global, 2015). This system uses\nMicrosoft Word for document development, which was eas-\nily recognizable to team members. In addition, this system\noffered batch document upload of our nearly 100 policies.\nOther key features of this program included the ability to set\nannual review dates to ensure timely compliance with\nreviews/revisions.\nThe electronic notification system of the policy manage-\nment system allows for email alerts to be sent to the policy\nowners at increasingly frequent intervals when policies are\nset for review and alert other faculty members to participate\nin revisions. When a policy is submitted for approval as\nrevised, an electronic notification is sent to whomever\nadministration has chosen as final approver. Once a policy is\napproved, notification is sent (with a quick access link to the\npolicy) to all faculty and/or staff who have been preset as\nreaders. When the readers open their email notifications and\nclick on the links, they can read the policy and add com-\nments, which are sent back to the owner of the policy closing\nthe compliance feedback loop.\nAdministratively, the policy management system offers\nsome additional features helpful for document version con-\ntrol, allowing for archival of documents with clear electronic\ndocumentation of dates of policy review, revision, and archi-\nval. It is then clear when changes were made, and easy analy-\nsis is possible to audit past committee actions regarding\nchanges due to regulation or standard implementation. The\nsystem also offers a report feature that allows the user to\nretrieve reports to determine faculty and staff compliance\nwith reading current annual reviews of policies and can also\nbe modified to be used as evidence of annual required train-\ning if it is loaded as a specific policy document within the\nsystem. This policy management system can be used in this\nsame manner for student compliance; however, the cost\nincreases based on the number of users who are allowed on\nthe system at one time.\nBased on the assessment and recommendation of the ad\nhoc committee, the policy management system was reviewed\nby our Chief Information Officer and team and compared\nwith other vendors of similar products. Implementation of\nthe system required initial meetings across departments for\nthe development of departmental-specific policy flow\nstreams. These meetings were necessary to ensure the map-\nping of policy owners to writers, reviewers, approvers, and\nreaders was clear. Names of faculty, staff, and students, as\nwell as email mapping were required, which was undertaken\nby Information Services. That process took significant time,\nalthough less than manual entry by each department. Each\ndepartment also had to establish the role of a Document\nControl Administrator, whose role would have primary over-\nsight at the department level and be able to reset document\nowners if people or positions changed. The establishment of\nthis role became one function, assimilated by a new job posi-\ntion that was created based on committee input for ensuring\ncompliance, the Academic Support Specialist.\nAcademic Support Specialist\nWhile continual compliance is the responsibility of every fac-\nulty member, it became clear through the exhaustive review\nof SON reports and documents while compiling the CIPR,\nthat centralization of data management was imperative for\n4 SAGE Open\nsuccess. Data had been traditionally kept for committee chairs\nand reviewed in minutes and sometimes annual reports; how-\never, data were often difficult to consistently locate.\nInconsistencies in data definitions for outcome measures can\neasily occur as changes in committee membership or chair-\nmanship naturally occur. This type of inconsistency could\nlead to wrong conclusions about performance and perhaps\nlack of appropriate resource allocation in quality action plans.\nTherefore, the conclusion of the ad hoc committee deter-\nmined that each committee governing specific outcomes data\nneeded to clearly define outcomes. Once outcomes were\nestablished, it was essential that all data be mapped and ware-\nhoused via one designated entity. The responsibility of the\ndata keeper would be quality of data, timeliness of data\nreporting, and serving as the sole source for historical out-\ncomes performance. Because this was central to embracing\ncontinuous compliance, the position of Academic Program\nSpecialist was developed and approved. The staff person\nselected for this role now works as an active member of the ad\nhoc committee, and all outcomes data are easily accessed via\none office.\nLessons Learned\nOver the time frame of 1 year, the ad hoc committee learned\nmany valuable lessons which are provided here for others\nwho may be embarking on similar journeys to achieve con-\ntinual compliance. Key suggestions are provided to describe\nbest practice for implementation of a policy management\nsystem, and additional valuable findings are noted as a result\nof this journey, including improvement in faculty standards\nknowledge, cost-effectiveness, and data warehousing.\nImplementation of a Policy Management System\nWhile the decision to recommend a specific policy manage-\nment software was achieved relatively quickly, implementa-\ntion at the school level was slowed greatly because the\nuniversity also chose to adopt the system for overall use.\nThis increased the overall planning time due to the inclusion\nof different colleges/schools, information technology, and\nadministration versus just the time that would have been\nrequired to do departmental-level training.\nImproved Standards Knowledge\nThe process of the development of the CIPR greatly enhanced\nfuture preparation and readiness for self-study. Ad hoc com-\nmittee members became familiar with the new CCNE stan-\ndards through webinar, conference, and review of crosswalks.\nThe ad hoc committee also wanted the faculty to become\nfamiliar with the new standards and encouraged them to\nbecome immersed in the review of the new standards as well\nas the process of self-study review through the standing com-\nmittees and the FO. The team approach to review new CCNE\nstandards by different assigned committee structures created\na sense of accountability and better understanding of the new\nstandards through a thorough policy and procedure review in\nrelation to standards. Nursing faculty members need to\nbroaden their understanding of the accreditation standards by\nwhich their schools of nursing are evaluated (Sharts-Hopko,\nCost-Effectiveness With Benefits\nThe ad hoc committee served as a cost-effective method to\noversee the total faculty preparation of the CIPR report.\nPreparation for the CIPR and/or the self-study can be accom-\nplished through enlisting the services of full-time faculty to\nwork within their workload or in overload. Some schools\nmay enlist the service of faculty emeritus or nursing consul-\ntants to assist in the compilation of these significant reports.\nIt is common for many colleges to enlist the services of fac-\nulty in overload or pull out of workload to accomplish simi-\nlar tasks. Some colleges additionally hire editors. As the\nworkload of the group was balanced among team members\nand across FO-specific committees, the report was generated\naccurately and over many months, easing the workload with-\nout any significant additional costs.\nData Warehousing\nIt is important to note that the most difficult tasks in CIPR\ncompletion are data retrieval, storage, and presentation, both\nhistorically and concurrently throughout the report prepara-\ntion period. Through this process of preparing the CIPR, we\nlearned the priority need for standardization of metric defini-\ntions as well as central repository. Performance information\nmust be housed with one system, and one data manager is\nrequired to ensure continuous compliance. By the develop-\nment of the role of Academic Support Specialist, the SON is\nnow assured that all faculty members know what data are\nsubmitted at what intervals, as well as have an ongoing cen-\ntralized location for accessing data for various purposes,\nincluding grant preparation processes, media releases, and\naccreditation needs.\nConclusions and Outlook\nIn conclusion, the CIPR process proved to be cost-effective,\nwhile promoting faculty development in team performance\nimprovement and CCNE standards knowledge. This in-depth\nanalysis of our system in relation to meeting the new CCNE\ncontinuous compliance standards helped our SON look\nbeyond the here and now and do highly productive strategic\nplanning for ensuring ongoing standards readiness. Using an\nad hoc committee, as well as reporting structure back to the\nfaculty's governance body, heightened committee impor-\ntance and accountability. Delegation to additional targeted\nand assigned subcommittees to ensure ownership of\nHanna et al. 5\ncommittee-specific policy and procedure management as\nwell as data analysis proved to be essential in overall faculty\nownership and participation in the CIPR. As a result, a large\nportion of faculty are more knowledgeable and engaged in\ncontinual compliance as an ongoing journey. Centralization\nof data management was essential to ensure data accuracy\nand to position ourselves in a new reality where integral per-\nformance data are easily available for data analytics. Based\non our journey in mastering continual compliance, the pro-\ncess could be easily adopted in nursing schools to best posi-\ntion themselves for CCNE readiness and accreditation.\n"
