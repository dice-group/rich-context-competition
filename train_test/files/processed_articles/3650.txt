Almost immediately thereafter, patriotic sentiments\nincreased radically driving up sales of flags and other patriotic merchandise. A\nspokesperson for Valley Forge Flag Company in Pennsylvania noted that \"in an\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\naverage year, consumers purchase about two million house flags. On September 11,\n2001, twenty-five to thirty million people wanted house flags instantly\" (Gaffin,\n2004). Americans also became less tolerant of views critical of the United States and\nits foreign policy. For comments deemed too insensitive in a post-9/11 television\nenvironment, wiseacre Bill Maher was widely criticized and eventually dismissed as\nthe host of a popular night-time political talk show. Some patriotic Americans even\ntook this previously latent intolerance for ideological heterogeneity to violent\nextremes, aggressing against those perceived to share membership in the ethnic group\nof the alleged perpetrators of the terrorist attacks. Human Rights Watch reported that\nanti-Arab bias crimes in the U.S. increased 1700% in the days following September\nThere have been many attempts to understand adherence to and defense of\nnational ideologies and values, intolerance of dissent, and hostility towards dissimilar\nothers. However, few have sought to ask why such intergroup bias varies as a\nfunction of the degree of national emergency, and why it differs between individuals.\nIn the wake of events surrounding the September 11 attacks, terror management\ntheory (TMT, Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and Solomon, 1986) has emerged as the\nleading source of answers to these and related questions. To get a sense of the impact\nof this perspective, consider the following: the exact phrase \"terror management\ntheory\" produces 1,560 hits on the Google Internet search engine, and 373 hits on the\nPsychInfo electronic database of psychological literature. Clearly, TMT is a force to\nbe reckoned with in contemporary social science. TMT explains the increase in\npatriotism and the concomitant decrease in tolerance of dissent since September 11 as\ndefensive reactions against existential fear elicited by the images of death and\ndestruction to which everyday Americans were exposed (Pyszczynski, Solomon, and\nGreenberg, 2002). Proponents of this perspective have drawn on a substantial corpus\nof empirical results in support of their views, pointing to over one hundred\nexperiments that demonstrate that such defensive reactions increase as a function of\nexposure to death-related stimuli (for a review see: Solomon, Greenberg, Schimel,\nIn this paper we present an alternative approach to understanding the impact\nof exposure to threat on intergroup ideological bias. We suggest how increases in\nadherence to ingroup ideology, intolerance of opposing views, and derogation of\ndissimilar others can be interepreted as behavioral manifestations of normative\nmental representations emanating from psychological systems designed to enhance\nindividual acceptance in, and coordination with, social groups. These normative\nmental representations increase in the face of adaptive challenges that can be\naddressed through marshalling social support. In providing an alternative to TMT, we\ndescribe the theoretical difficulties of TMT--central to which is the claim that it is\nconsistent with modern evolutionary social science. We present a view of fitness\nthreats and adherence to ingroup norms that is consistent with evolutionary theory,\nand is informed by a broader view of cultural variation. Finally, we evaluate these\ncompeting perspectives in light of the available evidence.\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nTerror Management Theory\n\"The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing\nelse; it is a mainspring of human activity--designed largely to avoid\nthe fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is\nthe final destiny of man.\"\n--Ernest Becker\nWhile terror management theory (Greenberg et al., 1986; Greenberg,\nowes a scholarly debt to a wide variety of influences (Freud, 1929; Kierkegaard,\n1844; Rank, 1936), it was primarily inspired by the work of the anthropologist Ernst\nthe inevitability of one's own death produces deep, existential fear that pervades all\naspects of the human condition. According to Becker, as organisms with an instinct\nfor self-preservation, the knowledge of the inevitability of death creates the potential\nfor a chronic condition of debilitating anxiety--an adaptive problem that our species\novercomes through a series of symbolic defense mechanisms. This collection of\nmechanisms is mediated through an ethnocentric cultural construction of reality, a\n\"cultural worldview.\"\nTerror management theorists have insightfully elaborated on Becker's rather\nintuitive claim that a key function of cultural worldviews is to manage the fear of\ndeath. Faith in a worldview is said to be important in assuaging death terror, as\nworldviews are thought to provide a sense of real or symbolic immortality--real in\nthe sense that they provide promises of an afterlife; symbolic in the sense that they\nprovide a system of meaning and stability that is larger than the individual and\npersists after the individual's death. According to this view, ethnocentrism is in large\npart caused by a defensive reaction to outgroup ideologies. Merely knowing that\nothers hold values and beliefs different from those of the established ingroup\nchallenges the validity of the individual's culturally constructed worldview, thus\nreducing its usefulness as an anxiety buffer. TMT theorists argue that individuals are\ntherefore motivated to buffer themselves from this anxiety by bolstering their faith in\ntheir own worldview. This is done by affirming one's core beliefs, derogating\noutgroups, and, in extreme cases, aggressing against or annihilating those who do not\nshare one's views (Greenberg et al., 1997).\nBecause the individual's worldview provides protection against death\nconcerns, according to TMT, reminding individuals of the prospect of their own death\nshould increase the need for this cultural buffer. TMT researchers have shown that\nparticipants in experiments who are asked to contemplate their own deaths exhibit\nincreases in positive evaluations of people whose attitudes and values are similar to\ntheir own, and derogation of those holding dissimilar views. TMT theorists claim that\nthese changes reflect an attempt by participants to defend their cultural worldviews in\norder to buffer themselves from the fear of death. Among other \"worldview-defense\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\ntactics\", mortality-salience induction has been shown to lead to harsher evaluations of\nmoral transgressors, attitudinally dissimilar others, and those who criticize the\nworldview of the ingroup. Conversely, mortality-salience induction also\ndemonstrably elicits positive evaluative biases towards those who uphold ingroup\nmoral standards, who are attitudinally similar, and who explicitly bolster the view of\nthe ingroup (Greenberg, Arndt, Schimel, Pyszczynski, and Solomon, 2001;\nGreenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Rosenblatt, and et al., 1990; Harmon-Jones,\nGreenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, and et al., 1989).\nTheoretical Difficulties with TMT\nWhile TMT has led to an impressive corpus of research, with detailed\npredictions being borne out by careful and creative experimental work, numerous\nKirkpatrick, 1999; Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and Kirkpatrick, 2004; Paulhus and\nTrapnell, 1997). The principal architects of TMT claim that theirs is an evolutionary\ntheory (Pyszczynski et al., 2002; Solomon et al., 2004). Here, we take issue with\nproponents' assertions that TMT is broadly consistent with the principles and\nfindings of modern evolutionary social science. In doing so, we critique (1) the\nassumption of a \"survival instinct\" on which the theory hinges, (2) the notion of an\nadaptive function for anxiety reduction, and (3) the idea that cultural worldviews are\ninherently anxiety-buffering.\nSurvival instinct. TMT proponents make reference to a \"survival instinct,\" a\nmotivational system that purportedly causes all organisms to seek to avoid their own\ndeaths (Greenberg et al., 1997). However, there are principled grounds on which to\ndoubt that such an instinct exists in any species, our own included.\nModern evolutionary biology is premised on the supposition that, when in\ntheir natural environment, individual organisms generally function in ways which\nincrease the likelihood that their genes will be favorably represented in future\ngenerations. Neither ensuring immediate survival nor enhancing longevity is expected\nto constitute an invariant goal, since such objectives often detract from reproductive\nsituations that cause bodily harm, sometimes they are indifferent to such situations,\nand sometimes they actively seek them out, depending on the ultimate consequences\nof a given action for reproductive success. For example, if Alaskan salmon were\noriented towards self-preservation and driven by a survival instinct, they would\nremain in the ocean during the breeding season, safely distant from the gaping jaws of\nthe predatory grizzly bears lining the banks of the streams that lead to their breeding\ngrounds. Salmon swim upstream at enormous risk of predation and injury in order to\nreach the precise pool in which they hatched. Only a small percentage successfully\nnavigate the hazardous journey; those that do spawn then die of exhaustion. The\nsalmon alive today are the descendents of individual fish that were motivated to make\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nthis fatal trek--any fish that favored survival over all else would not have made the\njourney, would not have reached the breeding grounds, and would not have left\ndescendents who could perpetuate their overarching \"survival instinct\".\nAlthough the salmon's behavior is complex, consisting of long-distance\ntravel, intricate navigation, and elaborate mating interactions, it is reasonable to\ndescribe these actions as instinctive. Stereotyped species-typical behavior having\npositive fitness consequences fits the definition of an instinct, a mechanism which\ngenerates a patterned behavioral response under highly specified stimulus conditions\n(Darwin, 1859). Contrary to the premises of TMT, avoiding death does not fit the\ndefinition of an instinct, since strategies for staying alive are contingent on the nature\nof the challenge confronting the organism at a given time. While journeying upstream\nto their deaths, salmon veer away from looming shadows and arch their bodies\nviolently when stranded. These responses are patterned and situation-specific\u00ad\nalthough they have the common higher-level outcome of temporarily enhancing\nsurvival, survival per se is not a goal of the organism (cf. Oehman and Mineka,\n2001). Interpreting the observation that salmon seem to often attempt to maintain\ntheir existence as evidence of a survival instinct is thus equivalent to arguing that\nwater runs downhill because of a gravity instinct\u00adboth statements mistakenly impute\nthe presence of an overarching goal. The notion of a survival instinct is thus\nunproductive, and for this reason this concept is not a part of the language of modern\nevolutionary theory. Organisms respond to specific stimuli in ways that have\nconsistently been associated with fitness-enhancing outcomes over evolutionary\nsuch as salmon might be afraid of predators, but almost certainly not death, hence it\nmay be sensible to talk about a \"predator-avoidance instinct\" (if one must use that\nunder-specified term), but it makes no sense to talk about organisms having a survival\ninstinct.\nFrom a broader theoretical perspective, the notion of a \"survival instinct\" is\nproblematic on first principles. The emerging consensus within contemporary\nevolutionary social science is that highly general motivational systems are unlikely to\nevolve, as natural selection can only build mechanisms designed to solve particular\nthe concept of a \"self-preservation instinct\" is a hypothetical construct that refers only\nto a general predisposition to orient oneself toward continued life, it is not obvious\nhow such an imperative could result in any practical guidance of adaptive behavior\n(Paulhus and Trapnell, 1997). Organisms do not safely navigate complex\nenvironments because \"an orientation for death-avoidance behavior\" is programmed\ninto their nervous systems, but rather because different life-threatening situations\nrequire different adaptive responses. While a problem such as avoiding cliffs (Gibson\nand Walk, 1960) is a task that natural selection can design cognitive mechanisms to\nsolve, avoiding death, per se, is not. Thus the \"survival instinct\" so often referred to\nin popular treatments of evolutionary approaches to behavior is most likely an\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nemergent property of a collection of discrete mechanisms, each designed to protect\nthe organism from particular kinds of dangers, a goal achieved in part through the\ngeneration of anxiety in reaction to specific classes of proximate cues.\nTMT notions of a survival instinct and its uniquely human consequences are\nnot only out of step with evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science, they\nare self-contradictory. In evaluating the plausibility of a pan-specific survival\nmechanism, consider the following: A generalized instinct to avoid death could only\nfunction through some sort of ability to foresee the ultimate consequences of failing\nto avoid hazards (e.g., \"If I fall off this cliff my body will be irreparably damaged,\nresulting in my demise,\" etc.). A \"survival instinct\" thus necessitates awareness that\nevents that have not yet occurred will bring an end to one's life. This is tantamount\nto an awareness of one's own mortality. How then can it be the case that, as TMT\nclaims, all organisms possess a \"survival instinct,\" but only humans can foresee their\nown deaths? If possessing a \"survival instinct\" and being aware of one's mortality\ncauses paralyzing anxiety that is only remedied through worldview defense, then\neither all organisms engage in worldview defense, or else only humans possess a\n\"survival instinct,\" meaning that natural selection created in humans a novel instinct\nwhich, upon its creation, instantly generated paralyzing anxiety in those who\npossessed it. Neither possibility is plausible.\nIn attempting to articulate their perspective in the language of contemporary\nevolutionary biology, TMT theorists argue that staying alive is necessary for\nreproductive success since, if one does not live long enough to reproduce, then one\nwill not be reproductively successful (Pyszczynski et al., 1997). While the latter\nobservation is true to the point of banality, it in no way justifies the TMT premise that\nsurvival is an overarching motive driving behavior. Consider the following: extended\nto its logical conclusion, this argument predicts that successful reproduction should\nhave an exacerbating effect on the frequency of behaviors that entail risk of injury or\ndeath (since individuals who have not yet reproduced should be more vigorous in\ntheir attempts to maximize survival) and, more generally, that the demographic\npatterns of bodily risk-taking should reflect the demographic patterns of reproduction\n(since the age/sex classes that contain the fewest parents should be the most\ncautious). As automobile insurance companies know well, the opposite patterns\nobtain--young people take the most risks with their survival, while the middle-aged\nare much more cautious; within age/sex classes, marrying (often the first step toward\nreproduction) reduces risk-taking, while divorce and widowhood increase it (Daly\nsurvival maximization and reproduction is precisely opposite that entailed by the\nclaim that differential reproductive success favors the existence of a survival instinct.\nUnlike TMT, contemporary evolutionary theory has no difficulty explaining the\ndemographics of risk-taking: natural selection favors behavior to the extent that it\nincreases access to resources (including social position, mates, and material goods)\nthat can translate into reproductive success--it is in pursuit of these resources that, far\nfrom attempting to ensure their survival, bachelors the world over often go out of\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\ntheir way to flirt with injury and death (Daly and Wilson, 1988).\nThe function of anxiety reduction\n\"I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to\nachieve it through not dying.\"\n--Woody Allen\nLike its psychoanalytic forbearers, TMT adopts a nonfunctional approach to\nanxiety. Anxiety is seen as an adaptive problem that needs to be overcome.\nSpecifically, the fear of death ostensibly causes a dysfunctional state of anxiety,\nhampering effective psychological functioning. This approach contrasts with a\nfunctionalist view in which emotions are seen as the products of specialized\nadaptations crafted by natural selection, with each emotion addressing a discrete class\nof adaptive challenges (Cosmides and Tooby, 2000; Fessler and Haley, 2003; Frank,\nperspective, anxiety is generally functional, indexing pressing social or environmental\nmotivate organisms to engage in behaviors that will ultimately eliminate or alleviate\nspecific problems\u00adreactions such as fight or flight responses, immobility, backing\naway from cliffs, or avoiding certain social interactions each constitute situation-\nspecific adaptive responses to the fitness challenges indexed by particular types of\nanxiety.\nWhile the functionalist view of emotions is wholly compatible with\ncontemporary evolutionary approaches to mind, the TMT portrait of anxiety is wholly\nout of step. It would be quite astonishing were natural selection to produce a\npsychology in which, instead of orienting the organism to pressing adaptive\nchallenges and motivating behavior that addressed them, anxiety regularly produced a\nparalytic state that could only be relieved through time-and attention-consuming\nmental gymnastics. In contrast to this implausible scenario, an informed evolutionary\nperspective suggests that, if anxiety is the product of adaptations that are activated in\nthe face of specific classes of fitness challenges, then selection should strongly\ndisfavor additional systems that inhibit anxious responses (Leary and Schreindorfer,\n1997; Pelham, 1997). A person feeling anxious sitting on railroad tracks as a train\napproaches might feel some relief by thinking warm thoughts about her worldview,\nbut the problem of imminent annihilation still looms. One would expect that an\nadaptive response to the prospect of harm or death would be to engage in behavior\nthat makes such events less likely, as opposed to merely reducing the anxiety that\nflags these prospects. Even if, for some reason, circumstances changed such that most\nmembers of a species were regularly reacting to particular stimuli with a maladaptive\nexcess of anxiety, it is not clear why natural selection would not then simply favor a\nreduction in the affective response, rather than construct an elaborate separate\npsychological system to compensate for the excessive anxiety. In fact, in contrast to\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nTMT's antiquated premise that anxiety constitutes an obstacle to effective behavior, a\nlarge and growing body of work indicates that human affective systems are well\ndesigned to prompt appropriate behavior in the face of adaptive challenges likely to\nhave confronted our hunter-gatherer ancestors (Cosmides and Tooby, 2002; Curtis\nAnxiety reducing properties of worldviews\nTerror management theory offers a philosophically sophisticated version of\nthe common intuition that worldviews (particularly religious ones) provide a\npsychological defense against fear of death and the unknown. According to this\naccount, worldviews provide a stable belief system, giving individuals a sense of\npermanence and security that allows them to live with relative equanimity despite the\ninevitable ultimate annihilation of the self. Worldviews provide standards and\nrewards such that the individual can achieve literal or figurative immortality by living\nup to the norms and values of the local culture (Greenberg et al., 1997). While these\nobservations seem commonsensical to Western readers, a consideration of the range\nof variation of human cultures casts doubt on the claim that all worldviews function\nin this manner. The ethnographic and historical corpora reveal that worldviews are as\nlikely to be terror-inducing as anxiety-reducing. The anthropological record is replete\nwith examples of belief systems in which misfortune is thought to befall individuals\nthrough no fault of their own, capricious supernatural entities murder children, crops\nfail because of witchcraft, the \"evil eye\" of envy causes catastrophe to befall\nsuccessful people, and so on. For example, the Fang people of Gabon believe that an\ninternal bodily organ can launch attacks against other people, drink their blood, and\nbring illness, harm or even death to the victims (Boyer, 2001), while life among the\nAzande of the Sudan has been described as rife with paranoia, fear, and suspicion due\nto a worldview saturated with witchcraft beliefs (Evans-Pritchard, 1937). In each of\nthese and numerous other cases, pain, suffering, and death rain down upon people\nregardless of whether or not they live up to the standards of the given cultural\nworldview.\nAlthough ethnographic descriptions of the belief systems of small-scale\ntraditional societies contain innumerable cases indicating that worldviews are at least\nas likely to be anxiety-promoting as anxiety-reducing, one need not look to such\nexotic examples to illustrate this point. Protestant evangelists in the Calvinist tradition\nhave long emphasized the doctrine that humanity is naturally depraved, and is headed\nfor an eternity in torment, save for the few \"elect\" whom God has called; for the true\nCalvinist, one can never know whether one has been so selected, and no degree of\nvirtue will save those who have not. Catholic Christianity is equally ambiguous as to\nthe assurance of a secure afterlife, arguing that even believers can never know if they\nare eternally secure until judgment day. According to the New Testament, even Jesus\nChrist, rather than exclusively providing comfort to his followers, taught: \"Many will\nsay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? And in Thy\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nname have cast out devils? And in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then\nwill I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me\" (Matthew 7:22-3, King\nJames Bible).\nFar from being a secure buffer against existential anxiety, worldviews raise as\nmany questions as they answer, and often do not paint a rosy picture of the future,\neven for those that follow the rules. This is true for both religious and secular\nworldviews, as secular worldviews such as those held by many in the peace or\nenvironmental movements can be every bit as apocalyptic and anxiety-producing as\nfundamentalist views. Many anthropologists have long been suspicious of the notion\nthat worldviews buffer anxiety, and instead argue that belief systems often bring\ntension and stress into everyday life, since not only do the living need to be attended\nto and appeased, but also the dead (Boyer, 2001). The TMT perspective on belief\nsystems is one developed in the context of a 20th Century post-war milieu where\nideological beliefs of the White North American middle class have become sanitized,\negoistic, and much more comforting than was true in the past, or is true in most\ncultures outside of the U.S. today. Because TMT does not attend to the belief systems\nof non-Western societies, nor does it accurately characterize most Western belief\nsystems when viewed in historical context, it provides a limited and profoundly\nethnocentric approach to the function of worldviews. A North American Christian\nworldview of the late 20th Century is hardly an appropriate prototype in any theory\nthat aims to describe a phenomenon which is purportedly ubiquitous across the\npanoply of cultures past and present.\nA Coalitional Psychological Perspective\nWorldview Defense and the Social Cognition of Coalitional Alliances\nIn developing an alternative to TMT, we connect a classical social science\nview of the function of ingroup ideologies with recent evolutionary game-theoretic\nperspectives. We begin with the recognition that coalitions and alliances are\nimportant features of social life among humans and other animals. The ability to form\ncoalitions to meet adaptive challenges has been documented across diverse taxa and\nhas been particularly important development in the evolution of primate social\nbehavior (see De Waal and Harcourt, 1992). Human societies have elaborated on this\nbasic feature of primate life in that the ability to coordinate behavior has been\ndeveloped to a level of complexity and efficiency unparalleled in the non-human\nanimal world (Boyd and Richerson, 1990).\nUnlike eusocial animals, much of our abilities in hyper-sociality do not lie in\nkin-related altruism, but is due to the unique human abilities for imitation,\ninternalization of and conformity to social norms--processes crucial for individual\nadaptive coordination within groups (Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Gintis, Bowles,\nsocial norms, including embodying the attitudes, values, and life-ways of the ingroup,\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nenhances the efficiency of coordinated action among self-interested actors\n(McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson, 2003). In addition to their sometimes complex\ncosmologies, cultural belief systems contain norms that address conflict resolution\nand resource distribution, as well as marriage rules, stereotypes, delineated power\nrelationships, and group membership criteria that define who does or does not belong\n(van Dijk, 1998). Such guidelines are undoubtedly crucial for solving a variety of\nadaptive problems that confront people in every society.1\nMuzafer Sherif (1936) recognized that all groups develop life-ways with\ncharacteristic beliefs, standards, strategies and even \"enemies\" in order to coordinate\nsocial life. Hence, if individuals are to function effectively in the ingroup, they must\nhold the ideological schemas containing the preferences and attitudes towards friends\nand enemies of the ingroup. Attitude formation thus comes not as nonintegrated\ndeclarative truisms, but rather is \"functionally related to becoming a group member--\nto adopting the group and its values (norms) as the main anchorage for regulating\nAs Hardin and Conley (2001) note, Solomon Asch also recognized that\nadaptive human understanding is predicated on social transmission and shared\nexperience. Like Sherif, he understood the importance of the function of socially\nshared beliefs, and emphasized the role of such beliefs, even when ethnocentric and\nprejudiced, in negotiating social relationships:\nThat attitudes have such social roots and implications has\nconsequences for their cognitive and emotional functioning, for the\nconditions of their growth and change. Their content and their\npersistence and change must be seen as an expression of the need to\nmaintain viable group relations. Only in this way can we fully\nunderstand the pull of social conditions in the formation and\nmodification of attitudes and the fact that they vary lawfully with\ngroup membership...For a Southerner to deny the prevailing views\nabout Negroes requires a drastic intellectual reorientation and a serious\nsnapping of social bonds. It would be tantamount to questioning the\nperceptions and cherished values of those nearest to him and casting\nhimself out of the group (Asch [1950] quoted in Hardin and Conley,\nIntimations of these early insights are resonant in recent research on the social\ncognition of intergroup relations (e.g. Haines and Jost, 2000; Hewstone and Lord,\ncreate or enhance interpersonal connections is through the affirmation of a perceived\nachievement of mutual understanding and common values, or what some have termed\na shared reality with relevant others (Hardin and Higgins, 1996). As beings\nmotivated to affiliate with and seek acceptance from others, people tend to present\nthemselves in ways they believe will lead others to respect and like them (Baumeister\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nand Leary, 1995). Thus, if individuals strategically alter the contents of their\ncommunications in response to relational goals, impression management motives may\nwell influence their social representations and evaluative assessments of others\n(Schaller and Conway, 1999). In this sense, culturally constructed worldviews can be\nseen as mental representations that facilitate the creation and maintenance of social\nrelationships.\nWith the recognition that (a) coordinating one's behavior with others benefits\nthe individual, (b) cultural beliefs are the foundation for such coordination, and (c)\nsocial cognitions dynamically instantiate cultural beliefs, then it is clear that aligning\none's social cognitions with those of the ingroup is often adaptive. We propose that,\nif the social benefits of norm adherence are the ultimate cause of the individual's\nsubscription to worldviews, then the focus and salience of a given individual's\nideology can be expected to vary as a function of their need to ally themselves with\nrelevant others. Moreover, if the benefits of social inclusion are particularly important\nnatural selection can be expected to have shaped human psychology such that, when\nconfronted with emergency situations that are best addressed using coalitional\nsupport, individuals should exhibit a strongly pro-normative orientation in order to\nenhance the maintenance and formation of alliances.\nWe propose that the mortality-salience phenomena documented by terror\nmanagement researchers are best explained as the social-cognitive output of a system\nof adaptive mechanisms that facilitate the formation of social networks, interpersonal\nattachments, and coalitions. We predict that exposure to stimuli indexing adaptive\nchallenges that could conceivably be addressed through coalitional support should\nlead to increases in normative attitudes toward relevant reference groups. From this\nperspective, rather than being the sole and central focus of the phenomena at issue,\nthe contemplation of death elicits increased normative attitudes regarding the\nideology of the ingroup primarily because the likely common causes of death in\nancestral environments (dire illness, disease, severe bodily harm, and starvation) were\nconditions in which successfully acquiring increased social support (and possibly\navoiding outgroup members) would have had significant fitness consequences.\nHence, whereas TMT predicts that no stimuli or arousal short of those that elicit\nthoughts of death will lead to the aforementioned enhancement of pro-normative\nsocial attitudes (Arndt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, and et al., 1997;\nGreenberg, Simon, Harmon-Jones, Solomon, and et al., 1995), we predict that a range\nof aversive stimuli should have this effect. More specifically, we predict that such\neliciting stimuli will concern or index situations that (a) pose adaptive problems for\nthe individual, and (b) are most effectively addressed using the support of allies.\nTMT advocates have pointedly argued that mortality concerns are not merely\na specific instance of a more general category of threatening events that could\nincrease normative sentiments. In defense of this claim they have gone to not\ninconsiderable length to demonstrate that exposure to some aversive thoughts\nunrelated to death, such as failing an exam or being forced to engage in public\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nspeaking, do not engender the \"worldview-defense\" effects elicited by mortality-\nsalience (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and et al., 1994; Greenberg et\nal., 1995). They have interpreted these findings as supporting their claim that the\nworldview defense effects found in their experiments are uniquely caused by the\nexistential concerns engendered by mortality salience. However, from our\nperspective, contemplating failing an exam or having to give a speech should not be\nexpected to provoke the same shifts in normative cognitions since these scenarios do\nnot concern fitness-relevant challenges in which coalitions could conceivably be a\npart of an adaptive solution to the problem. Rather than speaking to the uniqueness\nof mortality-salience, these results simply underline the need to view contemporary\nexperiences with an eye toward the ancestral world in which our minds are designed\nto operate.\nOn the Evolution of Normative Bias\nAs illustrated by our critique of TMT, in order to be compelling, evolutionary\nhypotheses must be consistent with what is known about the processes and products\nof natural selection, and what is known about the evolution the human lineage. The\npatterns of coalition and alliances found in related primate species suggest that such\nstrategic social structures are likely to be far more ancient than the hominid lineage\nitself (De Waal, 1982). To negotiate their social world successfully, and to anticipate\nthe likely social consequences of alternative courses of action, our ancestors would\nhave benefited from possession of psychological systems that could facilitate,\nmaintain and track such alliances (Kurzban, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2001; Tooby and\nCosmides, 1988). A core tenet of contemporary evolutionary approaches to behavior\nis the supposition that, because actions entail costs (in the form of time, attention,\nenergy, exposure to risk, or loss of opportunities to engage in alternate actions),\nevolution will only favor the propensity to act in a given fashion when, in general,\nsuch a propensity generates benefits that exceed its costs. In this paper, we argue that\nthe process we describe as normative bias is the foundation for behavior performed\nby individuals wanting to associate with and seek out potential coalition partners. We\nalso argue that not only is this process an emanation of the general affiliative impulse\nin times of need, but that when confronted with adaptive challenges, people increase\ntheir support for the ideology of the ingroup at least in part because by doing so they\nincrease the likelihood that others will come to their aid. This extension however,\nraises the question as to why displays of normative sentiment should inspire\nobservers to aid the actor, as it is not obvious why others should incur the costs of\nproviding assistance.\nNorm conformity often marks membership in a culturally-defined group:\ndialect, comportment, styles of dress and adornment, modes of greeting and address,\nand myriad other behaviors all differ between groups. Behavioral markers that allow\nindividuals to identify and preferentially interact with others who share their social\nnorms can arise and persist if interactions between individuals who share beliefs are\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nmore successful than interactions among people with discordant beliefs (McElreath et\nal., 2003). Demonstrating a normative orientation may thus serve to advertise the\nindividual's allegiance to the ingroup, and one's predictability for coordinated action\nin coalitions. Across cultures, both norms favoring dyadic reciprocity and norms\nfavoring aiding ingroup members are extremely common. Observers may thus be\nmotivated to assist an individual who displays normative sentiments both because (a)\nthey hope for future reciprocation (Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck, 2002;\nPanchanathan and Boyd, 2004), and (b) by providing aid they demonstrate to third\nparties that they themselves adhere to the cultural prescriptions of the group (Fessler,\ncharacterized ancestral human populations, this system is stabilized by the iterated\nnature of interactions, circumstances that enhance opportunities for both reputation\nformation and retaliation (Bowles and Gintis, 1998). In such a context it is relatively\neasy for observers to keep track of whether individuals who signal group allegiance\nand norm adherence when in need then later conform to those standards by similarly\naiding others. Those who falsely claim to be good citizens typically suffer the\nwithdrawal of future aid, the loss of opportunities for cooperative action, and,\nsometimes, direct and violent punishment Although neighboring groups sometimes\nprovide refuge for outcasts, individuals must generally strive to remain in good stead\nwith the members of a single group because coordination with new groups is often\ncostly, as dialect and new norms are difficult to learn (Nettle and Dunbar, 1997). In\naddition, advertising one's adherence to the norms of one group may have bridge-\nburning consequences--once the individual has voiced loyalty to one group, it often\nbecomes difficult to gain entry into other groups. The individual's attractiveness to\nmembers of other groups is diminished once time, energy, and loyalty have already\nbeen promised to a given group, commitments implicit in the display of normative\nbehaviors. Even if those commitments are broken, the individual's attractiveness to\nmembers of other groups is not thereby enhanced, since individuals who fail to live\nup to claims of adherence to one group are unlikely to later demonstrate greater\nfidelity to any other group that takes them in. Taken together, these factors increase\nthe likelihood both that signals of normative sentiment will often be attended to, and\nthat observers will often be willing to incur the costs of providing aid to those who\ndisplay such signals.\nSupporting Evidence\nWe do not claim that the view presented here explains every detail in the\nsubstantial corpus of existing terror management research. Indeed, we believe it to be\nvery likely that death is associated with unique cognitive and behavioral outputs (see\nBarrett, in press). However, employing the approach outlined above, we believe that\nthe central finding of terror management research--that participants in psychological\nstudies who contemplate their corporeal death display greater support for the\nnormative views of the ingroup--can be reinterpreted as an illustration of how\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nindividuals become more normative in their ideological orientation because of the\nbenefits attending ingroup-affiliative behavior. This holds true for a vast array of the\nconsequences of mortality-salience induction documented by TMT researchers:\nincreased support of one's nationalist, religious, or secular ideology, disliking\ndissimilar others, supporting ethnic stereotypes, denigrating or distancing oneself\ntowards the ideology of the outgroup, ingratiating oneself to heroes or those who\nbolster the views of the ingroup, intensifying altruistic tendencies towards the\ningroup, or proposing greater punishment for those who violate the norms of the\ningroup can all be viewed as the output of psychological mechanisms designed to\nincrease normative mental representations that undergird the maintenance and\nformation of social relationships.\nThe value of a theoretical framework hinges on its logical coherence, its\ncongruence with existing knowledge, and its explanatory power. With regard to the\nlatter factor, it is noteworthy that a number of findings in the terror management\nliterature are problematic for TMT, but fit well with our perspective. TMT research\nhas shown that (1) mortality-salience enhances ingroup bias even in minimal groups\nhaving trivial between-group differences in worldviews, and (2) mortality-salience\nincreases affiliative behavior even towards those who do not share the worldview. In\naddition to these findings inconsistent with TMT from within the corpus of\nexperimental results of its advocates, other empirical results (such as our finding that\nworldview defense occurs even when mortality is not salient) belie its advocates\nclaims to the uniqueness of death concerns in eliciting ideological bias. Below we\nconsider each of these findings in greater detail.\nTMT proponents emphatically argue that their experimental results are caused\nexclusively by the salience of death concerns (Arndt et al., 1997; Greenberg et al.,\n1994) and that their findings remove TMT from the domain of theories that explain\nincreased cultural affiliation in response to self-relevant threats (Pyszczynski,\nGreenberg, and Solomon, 1997). In support of the claim that ideology-defense effects\noccur specifically and exclusively because individuals are motivated to buffer\nthemselves from the unique anxiety-producing properties of death-salient stimuli,\nTMT researchers claim to have demonstrated that these effects do not emerge from\ngeneralized value accessibility, negative affect, or worrisome thoughts, and that\naversive thoughts unrelated to death (such as contemplating failing an exam or\naddressing a public audience) do not engender effects parallel to those elicited by\nmortality-salience (Greenberg et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1995; Greenberg et al.,\n1997; Solomon et al., 2004). They interpret these findings as supporting the notion\nthat mortality salience effects are \"outside the purview of other theories that might\nsuggest that self-relevant threats would enhance intergroup bias and adherence to\ncultural values\" (Greenberg et al., 1994). In a recent review article (Greenberg et al.,\n1997) three of the principal architects of TMT unambiguously state:\nUnique support for [TMT] from the studies reported above is\npredicated on the assumption that mortality salience effects are\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nengendered specifically by concerns about one's own mortality rather\nthan in response to any anxiety-provoking or self-threatening event.\nWe believe that a very strong case can now be made that mortality\nsalience effects are indeed uniquely driven by thoughts of mortality (p.\nChallenged by these claims, we conducted a series of investigations in which\nparticipants contemplated scenarios that contained an adaptive challenge but did not\nelicit thoughts of death. Whereas advocates of TMT explicitly predict that the\nworldview defense effects found in their studies are uniquely caused by death\nthoughts, our perspective predicts that fitness-relevant stimuli unrelated to death can\nproduce similar results, provided that the eliciting stimuli indexes an adaptive\nchallenge that could be effectively addressed through social support.\nIn six studies conducted in the U.S. and Costa Rica, we demonstrated that\nparticipants who contemplated death, theft of personal belongings, social isolation, or\nsoliciting help for a cooperative task all increased their support of a pro-nationalist\nauthor over a societal critic when compared to participants who contemplated a\nneutral theme2 (Navarrete, in press; Navarrete et al., 2004). In addition, again\ncontrary to the predictions of TMT, mortality salience failed to increase normative\nbias among Costa Rican participants, calling into question the cross-cultural ubiquity\nof such existential concerns.\nUnder the assumption that disease threats provided some selection pressure\nunder Pleistocene conditions such that our ancestors would have benefited from the\nassistance of ingroup members (e.g. ingroup members could provide aid when one is\nill and vulnerable to predators or conspecifics), in a separate series of studies using\nU.S. citizens on the Internet as participants, we demonstrate that ethnocentrism rises\nas a function of perceived vulnerability to disease. This relationship occurs even\nwhen the effects of death anxiety are statistically controlled in the model. In a follow\nup study we show that support for ingroup ideology is positively predicted by disgust\nsensitivity towards potential sources of pathogen contagion when measured as a\nchronic individual difference measure, and when disgust sensitivity is experimentally\nprimed. Finally, in an online study using pregnant women as participants, we show\nthat ingroup bias peaks during the first trimester (the period when the mother and\nfetus are most vulnerable to infection), and decreases in the second and third\ntrimesters when pathogen risk is lower (Navarrete, Fessler & Eng, 2005).\nThese results showed that worldview-defense effects can occur even when\ndeath is not salient, provided that the eliciting stimuli contain content that is relevant\nto fitness concerns that can conceivably be addressed through the social support that\ncoalition membership can provide. Illness, social isolation, theft of personal property,\nand a need for assistance in a cooperative task all require that individuals take steps\nnecessary for social inclusion, and increasing one's pro-normative orientation\nfacilitates success toward this end. While our results are striking, our enterprise is not\nthe only one to demonstrate that normative bias rises in response to self-relevant\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nthreats that do not engender death-thoughts. Experimental manipulations that are\nunrelated to death but which share conceptual links to personal uncertainty or to\nthreats of physical bodily-integrity have been found to increase ideology defense as\nBecause (a) others are often able to provide direction and aid in uncertain situations,\nand (b) threats to bodily self-integrity can be addressed through social support, these\nresults are consistent with our thesis that increases in normative orientation are\nultimately aimed at recruiting assistance.\nFindings from both classic and current research on social support are\ncongruent with our contention that affiliation defenses are triggered by a wider\nvariety of threats than simply those that might invoke existential anxiety. Taylor and\ncolleagues (2003) present a host of evidence indicating that social support in the face\nof stressful events is beneficial to human psychological and physical functioning.\nThe authors note that affiliation appears to be especially common under stress, and is\nparticularly beneficial when individuals are part of a network of communication and\nmutual obligation. Stanley Schachter's (1959) studies of the psychology of affiliation\nreveal that research participants increase their affiliative responses in response to a\nwide range of aversive stimuli that do not invoke mortality concerns. Such threats\nincreased affiliation most markedly with others believed to be facing the same\nsituation. Congruent with our premise regarding the adaptive utility of coalition\nmembership in the face of threats, Schachter interprets his results as indicating that\nsuch challenges \"lead to a desire to be with others as a means of socially evaluating\nand determining the 'appropriate' and proper reaction.\"\nHarmon-Jones and colleagues (1996) examined the effects of mortality\nsalience on minimal groups (sensu Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, and Flament, 1971) and\nfound that study participants who contemplated death preferred ingroup members to\noutgroup members in arbitrarily assigned groups. The authors interpret these results\nas indicating that, when confronted with death, individuals who lack an existing and\nmeaningful outlet on which to project their death anxiety will seize on arbitrary or\ntrivial factors with which to boost their personal sense of value and preserve their\npsychological equanimity. We suggest that, because these results reveal that\nintergroup bias occurs in the absence of meaningful worldview distinctions, this\ninvestigation actually demonstrates that it is perceived coalitional membership, and\nnot worldview defense, that is the key factor in mortality-salience phenomena. As\nnoted above, while shared beliefs are important in determining group identity (who\nbelongs and who does not), it is not the beliefs per se that are the relevant issue, but\nrather the group membership thus marked. Contrary to TMT claims, group identity\ndoes not function to assuage worldview defense needs (sensu Mikulincer and Florian,\n2000) \u00ad instead, worldviews serve the purpose of facilitating intergroup and\ninterpersonal relationships.Wisman and Koole (2003) present a series of studies in\nwhich mortality salience consistently leads to increased affiliation strivings as\ndemonstrated by a greater tendency to sit next to others rather than alone, and to sit\nwith ingroup members compared to outgroup members. On their own, these results\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nare consistent with both our coalitional psychology theory and a TMT perspective on\naffiliation needs: whereas we assert that affiliation with others is an important means\nof coping with threats to fitness, proponents of TMT argue that belongingess with\nothers bolsters one's worldview and thus relieves existential anxiety, since social\nrelationships are an integral part of a meaningful, anxiety-buffering worldview\n(Florian, Mikulincer, and Hirschberger, 2002; Taubman Ben-Ari, Findler, and\nMikulincer, 2002). However, in contrast to predictions entailed by the latter\ninterpretation, Wisman and Koole also found that the affiliative response swamped\nworldview defense effects, as affiliation tendencies increased even when group\nmembers had threatened participants' worldviews, and when the group forced\nparticipants to attack their own worldviews. These effects occurred even though the\nparticipants' worldviews were personally relevant and highly accessible. Together,\nthese results suggest that affiliative responses suffice to attenuate or eliminate the\nneed to increase one's normative orientation, a pattern that contradicts the TMT view\nof the relationship between affiliation and beliefs. If, as TMT researchers claim,\naffiliation is attractive to the extent that relationships are part of a meaningful\nworldview, then participants should not affiliate with those who contravene their\nworldviews. In contrast, the pattern documented by Wisman and Koole is wholly\nunderstandable once it is recognized that TMT erroneously reverses the relationship\nbetween worldviews and affiliation \u00ad from the perspective of coalitional psychology,\nbecause affiliation is itself the goal underlying increases in normative cognitions, if\naffiliation can be achieved directly, the value of more roundabout means of achieving\nthis objective is reduced.\nOther moderators of normative bias\nIn providing an alternative explanation of the findings of terror management\nresearch, we do not propose that the phenomena to be explained consist merely of the\ntendency for people to produce positive evaluations of the ingroup and negative\nevaluations of outgroups--the available evidence suggests that the phenomena at\nissue are much more complex (Greenberg et al., 1990; Mikulincer, Florian,\nBirnbaum, and Malishkevich, 2002). We agree with terror management researchers\nthat evaluations of dissimilar views may be tolerated to a greater or lesser degree\nunder mortality-salience conditions depending upon the personality and ideology of\nthe respondent. However, whereas TMT researchers view such differences as\nreflecting unique styles of coping with the existential dilemma stemming from the\nparticulars of individuals' worldviews and problem-solving styles, we interpret these\nresults as simply reflecting adaptive shifts in the cognition that binds social relations.\nBecause the behaviors that maintain and enhance social relationships occur within a\ncontext of shared values, beliefs, and norms (Hardin and Conley, 2001), the relational\ncognitions appropriate for servicing social relationships will differ depending on the\nnorms of the social group with which one identifies. In addition, the extent to which\nsuch behaviors will be pursued will be contingent on the individual's self-assessed\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nability to meet fitness challenges \u00ad time and effort will not be expended seeking\nsocial support if such support is deemed unnecessary by a given individual facing a\ngiven challenge. Thus, the expression of a pro-normative orientation should be\nmoderated by both the extent to which one's ingroup values tolerance of diversity and\nthe degree of self-assessed need for assistance. Below, we consider these factors in\ngreater detail.\nAuthoritarianism. A variety of terror management experiments demonstrate\nthat authoritarianism and political conservatism are moderators of bias against\ndissimilar others (Greenberg et al., 1990; Greenberg, Simon, Pyszczynski, Solomon,\nand et al., 1992). Political conservatives and high-authoritarians showed decreased\nliking for dissimilar others after contemplating death, but no such effects were found\nfor political liberals and low-authoritarians. The authors claim that these patterns\nreflect individuals' attempts to buffer themselves against existential anxiety by\nbolstering their respective worldviews. For example, because tolerance of dissimilar\nothers is central to a liberal political philosophy, under mortality-salience conditions,\nliberals ostensibly become more tolerant of outgroup members because they are\nclinging more tenaciously to their ideology in order to avoid confronting their own\nmortality. In contrast to this interpretation, we propose that differences in tolerance\nare important not because they influence how individuals attempt to assuage death-\nanxiety, but rather because tolerance of dissimilar others reflects norms which\nindividuals believe are important to their respective ingroups. High authoritarian\nindividuals identify with groups that advocate intolerance of cultural diversity, while\nlow authoritarians identify with groups that advocate the reverse.\nOur investigations in the U.S. and Costa Rica (Navarrete et al., 2004) support\nour interpretation of the effects of authoritarianism on responses to challenging\ncircumstances. Using stimuli unrelated to death, we demonstrated that attitudinal\nchanges are moderated by individual differences in authoritarianism: the effects of the\ntreatments on normative bias are greatest for participants scoring high on\nauthoritarianism, while the effects are attenuated or even reversed for low\nauthoritarians. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that, when faced with\na challenging situation in which social alliances would be of particular importance,\nindividuals conform to the culturally constructed standards of their ingroup by overtly\nembodying those norms. Consistent with our predictions, and contrary to the claims\nof TMT, these effects are not limited to death-relevant threats.\nSelf-esteem. Self-esteem plays a critical role in terror management research, as\ninvestigators have shown that individuals having high self-esteem respond to\nmortality-salience primes with less worldview defense than do individuals having low\nself-esteem (Goldenberg, McCoy, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, and Solomon, 2000;\nHarmon-Jones, Simon, Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and et al., 1997). While proponents\nof TMT claim that this occurs because high self-esteem indexes possession of a\nstrong buffer against death terror (i.e., one has met the standards of one's worldview\nand can therefore live with equanimity despite the knowledge of one's inevitable\ndeath), emerging perspectives on self-esteem suggest that this pattern is more\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nplausibly explained in terms of the relationship between self-esteem and the\nindividual's ability to meet fitness-relevant challenges, including the challenge of\nmaintaining social support. Leary, Tambor and Terdal (1995) describe self-esteem as\na representation to the self of the degree to which one is socially connected. Noting\nthe functional significance of group inclusion, Leary and colleagues argue that the\nhedonic aspects of self-esteem serve to motivate behaviors that enhance acceptance\nby the group. Reasoning along similar lines, Fessler (2001) argues that the emotions\nof shame and pride index instances of failure or success with regard to both cultural\nstandards for behavior and questions of social dominance; self-esteem provides a\nrepresentation of one's current standing in the group by summing one's history of\nshame- and pride-inducing events. Finally, Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2001) argue that\nthere are numerous functionally distinct self-esteems, each gauging how well one is\nperforming in a given fitness-relevant domain; global self-esteem can thus be seen as\na running tally of one's fitness prospects, with performance in a variety of social\narenas constituting a critical determinant (see also Kirkpatrick et al., 2002).\nIf self-esteem is an index of how well one is equipped to meet fitness\nchallenges, and if such readiness is at least in part a function of one's degree of social\nintegration, then it follows that individuals having high self-esteem should work less\nstridently to marshal social support when confronted with adaptive challenges than\nindividuals having low self-esteem, as the former can more reliably count on others to\nprovide support when needed. On the basis of this reasoning we predicted that, as had\nbeen previously demonstrated by TMT researchers, death-related primes should have\na greater enhancing effect on intergroup bias in low self-esteem individuals. While\nthis prediction did not differentiate our theory from TMT, in contrast to the latter, we\nalso predicted that the same should be true of threat primes that do not evoke thoughts\nof death. Each of these predictions was supported (Navarrete et al., 2004; Study 3).\nOur view of the role played by self-esteem in reactions to adaptive challenges\nis congruent with a body of literature indicating that people on the periphery of\ndesirable ingroups express greater attachment towards ingroup ideals, and more\noutgroup derogation, than do those at the center of the ingroup (see Hewstone, Rubin,\nand Willis, 2002 for a review). For example, Peres (1971) has shown that, in Israel,\nlower status Middle Eastern Jews report more intense hostility and prejudice towards\nArabs than do higher status European Jews. Middle Eastern Jews, who are relatively\nperipheral members of Israeli society, may use derogation of Arabs to gain\nacceptance by the higher-status, core members of their society. These effects are\ndeepened when threats to the shared common interests of all Israelis are made salient\n(Jost et al., in press). Similarly, Noel, Wann, and Branscombe (1995) present\nexperimental results showing that people with peripheral membership status in an\ningroup express negative judgments about a comparison outgroup, particularly when\ndemonstrate that when confronted with an ego-threat, individuals with low self-\nesteem modify their behavior so as to become more likeable to peers, a shift that is\nmediated through perceptions of the self as interdependent with others. Hence, in\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nboth naturally occurring and artificially created groups, those who likely see their\nstatus as more tenuous work harder to advertise their conformity to ingroup norms,\nderogating outgroup members and otherwise adjusting their self-presentation so as to\nincrease their appeal to relevant others. When combined with findings concerning the\ncentrality of social acceptance and norm adherence to self-esteem (Kirkpatrick and\ncredence to our interpretation of the interaction between self-esteem and responses to\nthreat-primes, importantly including primes that do not concern death.\nInterdependence. An important question in cross-cultural research concerns\nthe extent to which individuals in various societies differ with regard to independent\nversus interdependent construals of the self. This concept is seen by many cross-\ncultural researchers as the most basic element of a culture, and a distinctive\nindependent self emphasizes values such as self-reliance, individual rights, and self-\nactualization. Conversely, the interdependent self focuses on sociocentric values such\nas dependence on others, duty, and conformity to social norms.\nOur initial studies found that social isolation-salience produced greater\nnormative cognitions than did mortality salience among Costa Rican participants, but\nthat the opposite was true among American undergraduates (Navarrete et al., 2004).\nIn fact, mortality-salience failed to produce significant main effect increases on\nnormative bias in the Costa Rican samples. We hypothesized that cultural differences\nin the conceptualization and importance of social relationships might be the cause of\nthese differences. Since rural Costa Ricans value interconnectedness and view their\nability to meet life challenges as fundamentally dependent on their relationships with\nothers, Costa Ricans may assess complete social isolation as a more dire fitness\nchallenge than do our more individualistic American undergraduates. By extension,\nthis reasoning suggests that, within a single culture, interindividual variation in the\nperceived dependence upon others in meeting life challenges should correspond with\nthe extremity of normative sentiments that are exhibited under conditions of threat or\nchallenge. A follow-up study in Costa Rica (Navarrete et al., 2004; Study 4) produced\nevidence supporting this prediction, as we found that adherence to collectivist values\npositively predicted normative bias as a function of exposure to coalition-relevant\nprimes, and that increases in normative bias after the manipulation were primarily\ndriven by participants with high interdependent self-construals.\nThis finding was replicated among urban North American undergraduates in a\nsecond series of studies (Navarrete, in press). Intriguingly, reversing the pattern found\nin Costa Rica, among UCLA undergraduates, contemplation of social isolation\nproduced smaller effects than did mortality salience. These population differences are\nconsistent with the notion that ideological reactions to self-relevant adaptive\nchallenges reflect cultural differences in how such challenges are cognized. Various\naspects of universal themes may be differentially cognitively elaborated or\ndownplayed in different cultures (Levy, 1973), producing between-population\ndifferences in the aversiveness of various scenarios. Specifically, social isolation may\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nbe a more significant threat in societies that emphasize collective as opposed to\nindividual responses to challenges, and existential mortality concerns may not be\nparticularly salient to individuals in societies where religious beliefs and fatalistic\nattitudes make avoiding such themes less troublesome than is the case for people\nliving in complex industrialized nation-states where cultures emphasize secular life,\nlongevity, avoidance of death, and control over one's destiny (Cohen and Nisbett,\nConclusion\nOur results and those of other researchers provide clear evidence that bias\ntowards ingroup ideology can be produced using fitness-relevant primes without\nreminding participants of their mortality. These effects are moderated by the same\nindividual differences constructs employed in terror management research\n(authoritarianism, self-esteem), as well as by a novel moderator that we have\nexplored (interdependence). Together, these patterns support our contention that\nhumans possess psychological mechanisms that shape reactions to adaptive\nchallenges in ways which would have been fitness-enhancing under ancestral\nconditions. These mechanisms adjust behavior as a function of the need to improve\none's chances of receiving coalitional support, generating output that is shaped by the\nculture of the group with which one identifies.\nRecent terror management research has documented that group identification\nand close social relationships are key themes in the investigation of intergroup bias\nand ideology defense (Florian et al., 2002; Hirschberger, Florian, and Mikulincer,\n2003; Mikulincer et al., 2002). Indeed, these researchers have recognized the adaptive\nvalue of social relationships in addressing fitness challenges (e.g. finding food,\nshelter, staying safe, etc.). While we welcome this trend, we question the utility of\ngrafting increasingly accurate additions onto a dubious theoretical framework.\nContrary to the claims of its proponents, terror management theory is not in step with\ncontemporary evolutionary approaches to behavior regarding the function of anxiety,\nnor does it accurately describe beliefs found in many of the world's cultures. Even if\nit were the case that a gargantuan system of psychological mechanisms evolved\nsolely for the palliative function of anxiety reduction, terror management theory can\nnot adequately explain why it should be the case that belief in a worldview should, on\nfirst principles, be anxiety-reducing as opposed to anxiety-inducing. Lastly, and most\ndamning of all, mortality salience does not have the unique evocative powers ascribed\nto it by its proponents. Our approach to coalitional psychology, a framework\npremised on the tenets of modern evolutionary theory and informed by a broad\nunderstanding of cultural variation, can provide direction in accounting for both the\ncorpus of results so impressively documented in terror management research and the\ngrowing body of findings inconsistent with the predictions of terror management\ntheory in its present form.\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nNotes\n1. In contrast to the meaning of the word \"adaptive\" as used in the\ndevelopmental, educational and clinical literatures (i.e., enhancing individual\nwellbeing), following usage in evolutionary biology, we employ this term to\ndescribe behavior which enhances individual biological fitness (defined as the\npercentile representation of the individual organism's genes in future\ngenerations). The term adaptive challenge thus refers to any circumstance that\nthreatens to reduce the biological fitness of the individual organism.\n2. Our reasoning for employing the experience of theft as an experimental prime\nwas as follows: We hypothesize that an individual's access to and control over\nresources was a significant determinant of fitness in ancestral environments.\nCoalitions clearly aid in achieving these goals, as allies can increase access to\nresources, assist in guarding resources, and enact retribution on competitors\nwho attempt to appropriate resources. We therefore predicted that\npsychological mechanisms that operate to enhance coalitional support should\nbe activated by the prospect of having had one's possessions stolen, for such\nan event indicates an immediate increase in the need for resources, indexes\ninadequate social assistance in the protection of one's resources, and signals\nthe need for allies in seeking vengeance on thieves, actions that will deter\nfuture fitness-reducing transgressions. We predicted that the prospect of\ncomplete social isolation as an experimental prime would similarly elicit the\nmechanisms that enhance coalitional support. An individual's access to any of\nthe benefits of sociality, such as finding mates, protection from predators or\nconspecifics, access to food and shelter, etc., depends on his or her inclusion\nin social groups. Thus, we posited that, in times of social exclusion or\nmarginalization, the adaptive system for creating or reaffirming beneficial\nsocial bonds should give rise to the pro-normative, ingroup-affiliative\nsentiments necessary to obtain needed social support. Finally, we designed an\nadditional experimental manipulation to directly explore the workings of the\npsychological mechanisms which we postulate undergird coalitional\npsychology. This prime induced participants to contemplate the need to enlist\nthe aid of family and friends to build a home. To the extent that enlisting\nothers to aid in a cooperative task requires that individuals take steps to\nincrease the likelihood that others will view them as valuable ingroup\nmembers deserving of aid, enhancing one's normative orientation is a\ncognitive first step toward achieving this end.\nNormative Bias and Adaptive Challenges\nReferences\nArndt, J., Greenberg, J., Solomon, S., Pyszczynski, T. et al.
