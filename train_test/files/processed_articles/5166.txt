Although JASLWJ\navows a religious purpose in its activities, it takes full advantage of the social and economic deprivation to recruit new\nmembers. For any viable short- or long-term solution, this article concludes that the country must go all-out with its anti-\ncorruption crusade. This will enable the revival of other critical sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, likely ensuring\nmore employment. Should the country fail to stamp out corruption, it will continue to witness an upsurge in the activities of\nJASLWJ, and perhaps even the emergence of other violent groups. The spillover effects may be felt not only across Nigeria\nbut also within the entire West African region.\n",

The coercive nature of\ntheir military rule opened channels for abuse, including the\nabuse of office, corruption, human right violations, and gross\ndisregard for laws by the military leaders; hence, the emer-\ngence of militant groups as a force intended to check the\nexcesses of the military. However, militancy has taken on a\nfull-blown violent dimension since the return of democratic\ngovernance in the country in 1999. And the return of democ-\nracy after a long period of military rule has emboldened the\nchain of corruption in the country. This is evident from the\narrests of numerous top state and federal government offi-\ncials for diverting wealth derived from crude oil revenue.\nState governors and ministers have been arrested; some were\nconvicted whereas others are being prosecuted in court for\ndiverting, mismanaging, or outright theft of the wealth\nintended for projects to aid the people. However, militancy is\ndue to variety of factors, such as ethno-nationalism, religious\nextremism, and separatist movement, and each group has its\nown desired objectives and methods. This article endeavors\nonly to describe how poor governance has exacerbated the\nactivities of Islamist violent militant group in northern\nNigeria.\nThe absence of projects and other basic needs have been\nresponsible for the increase in economic and social gaps\nbetween the rich and the poor, and has led to a massive vac-\nuum in infrastructural development. The result has been a\ncontinued level of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment\nwithin the ranks of average Nigerians, thus creating the per-\nfect arena for breeding violent militancy in Nigeria. Rotberg\n(2004) observed that there is a link between poverty, poor\ngovernance, and state failure, and this combination provides\na perfect breeding ground for militancy and subsequent\ninstability. One of the militant groups that emerged in north-\nern Nigeria is the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati Wal-\nJihad (JASLWJ), also known as Boko Haram, led by\nMohammed Yusuf. The JASLWJ leader was closely related\n1University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammed Nuruddeen Suleiman, Department of International and\nStrategic Studies, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.\nEmail: nuruddeenms@hotmail.com\nCycle of Bad Governance and Corruption:\nThe Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria\nMohammed Nuruddeen Suleiman1\nand Mohammed Aminul Karim1\n Keywords\nNigeria, governance, corruption, militancy, Boko Haram, democracy\n2 SAGE Open\nto some renowned figures in the Izala sect,1 as he was a for-\nmer brilliant student of the late Sheik Ja'afar Mahmud Adam\n(Sani, 2011a). Ja'afar was an influential Izala-salafi adher-\nent; he was assassinated by unknown gunmen in 2007 during\nprayers. Evidence suggests that Ja'afar and Yusuf parted\nways before 2007 due to irreconcilable difference concern-\ning their ideology toward teaching the tenets of Islam. Ja'afar\nhad on several occasions in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia tried to\nadmonish Yusuf to recant and reevaluate his stance,2 but\nYusuf always refused to come to an understanding based on\nhis principles, this subsequently led to the assassination of\nJa'afar.\nThis JASLWJ holds a puritanical view in adhering to\nIslamic injunctions and tends to have strong disdain for\nWestern institutions due to the perceived belief that they sup-\nport the inequitable political and economic system in\nNigeria.3 This trend was amplified by the perception that the\nruling elites perpetrated social injustice through the misman-\nagement of the collective wealth of the nation. The JASLWJ\ntook the opportunity to propagate its doctrines in the heart of\nthe teeming disgruntled population. At the same time, the\nJASLWJ was categorical in condemning democracy and its\ninstitutions in Nigeria, because they believed it was in direct\nvariance with and contradicted the teachings of Islam. They\nblamed all the ills of the nation as consequences of deviating\nfrom the teachings of Islam. The President of the Civil Rights\nCongress in Nigeria categorically sums up the intricacies fol-\nlowing the rise of the group, and suggests that\nYusuf took advantage of poor quality of our educational system,\nthe incessant strikes, and cult activities. . . . the irresponsible\nleadership at all levels of government, unemployment, poverty,\ncorruption and insecurity. And as he pointed out such failures,\nciting verses of Quran and the saying of the prophet, the youths\nsaw him as the leader who will indeed deliver them from\nmalevolence to the Promised Land. (Sani, 2011a)\nMockaitis (2011) observed that ideology has the strong\ncapability to create social mobilization, and the group behind\nthe mobilization can effectively exploit the frustrations in a\nsociety to promote its beliefs. The JASLWJ strategy of using\nthe holy Quran to captivate the mind of its followers (Walker,\n2012), and attributing the ills faced by the nation to the influ-\nences of Western civilization, has created an army of sup-\nporters. Nonetheless, this radical sect metamorphosed into a\nbloody violent group in 2009 after a confrontation with\nNigerian security. This led to the death of about 800 mem-\nbers of the group (Cook, 2011), and the arrest of some of the\ngroup members, including their leader. The Nigerian police\ntook the sect leader into custody; however, he died some few\nhours later under mysterious circumstances. Observers\nbelieved that he was extra-judicially executed as reported by\nthe media (\"Islamist Leader Killed in Nigeria,\" 2009). When\nYusuf was killed, Abubakar Shekau became the new leader\nof the JASLWJ, and he is considered to be more aggressive\nthan the late leader Yusuf (Zenn, 2011), and equally far less\nknowledgeable. The consolidation of Shekau as the new\nleader of the group widens the parameter of the group's radi-\ncalism. The two qualities of the new leader being more radi-\ncal and intellectually inferior played a major role in\nradicalizing the movement after the death of Yusuf. From\n2009 onward, the country has been beset with internal war\nagainst a known but faceless group that has grown steadily\nmore formidable. This group introduced a new dimension to\nits tactics by using suicide bombings to attack its targets. One\nof the first targets of the group was the Nigerian Inspector\nGeneral of Police; he narrowly escaped when a suicide\nbomber targeted his vehicle within the premises of his office,\na place previously considered to be one of the safest places in\nthe country. This was followed by another suicide attack on\nthe United Nations headquarters in Nigeria. Since then, the\ncasualties of these hostilities have been in the hundreds, from\ncivilians to combatants, as well as people across all ethnic\nand religious sectors of the country. Furthermore, although\nthe JASLWJ originated in North Eastern Nigeria, it has\nenjoyed widespread support attracting members from across\nthe Northern region of the country. Many young girls from\nthis region were indoctrinated using verses of the Holy\nQuran, and were used as suicide bombers. A case in particu-\nlar, in 2014 an indoctrinated father of a 13-year-old girl vol-\nunteered his daughter for a suicide mission (\"Girl Says\nFather Gave Her to Boko Haram,\" 2014), but she recanted\nfew moment toward the target, while her colleagues blew\nthemselves off killing several people. Islam is indeed the\nvehicle used by the JASLWJ for indoctrination, but this arti-\ncle has demonstrated how bad governance which has created\nmyriad of problems such as unemployment is fueling the\nactivities of the group. The absence of employment opportu-\nnities created by bad governance has increased the level of\npoverty and it has become more pervasive. Some JASLWJ\nmembers were arrested for attacking Ekklizivar Yan'uwa\nNigeria (EYN) Church, and they revealed that they were\ndemonstrate the level of poverty, and the possibility of this is\nreflected in the very statistics mentioned in (Appendix A),\nwhich indicate that about 73% of the population in northern\nNigeria is living in absolute poverty. In acknowledging this\nvery fact, the then Chairman of the People's Democratic\nParty (PDP), the ruling party, Bamanga Tukur, lamented to\nthe upsurge of the activities of the JASLWJ, and he posit that\n\"people feel aggrieved. They are angry because they are hun-\ngry. Unless we remove the hunger, we too may not be able to\nMethod and Data\nThe source of the data in this research was taken from a PhD\nresearch work. The study is based on semi-structured inter-\nviews with 50 stakeholders, who include two former Nigerian\npresidents, ministers, governors, lawyers, non-governmental\nSuleiman and Karim 3\norganizations, senior lecturers, and journalists. The face-to-\nfaceinterviewswereconductedinNigeriabetweenDecember\nBayelsa, Kano, and Kaduna, whereas additional phone inter-\nviews were conducted in 2014 with some participants from\nGombe, Yobe, and Maiduguri. The participants represented\nvarious religious and ethnic groups. The average recording\ntime for each interview was 45 min; they were voice recorded\nand eventually transcribed verbatim. Documents were also\nobtained from major anti-corruption agencies such as the\nEconomic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigerian\nFinancial Intelligence Unit, and the Independent Corrupt\nPractices Commission. For the secondary data, the study\nrelies solely on reports from national and international news-\npapers and journals.\nLiterature Review\nThe literature covering militancy in the northern part of\nNigeria dwelled mostly on the origin and activities of the\ngroups through their radicalization on a religious platform\nWinters, 1987). These studies gave the historical account and\ndescribed the increasing level of sect rivalry among the vari-\nous sects within the Muslims of northern Nigeria, as well as\nhow the level of intolerance of other faiths in the northern\nregion has heightened tension. Furthermore, while there is\nquite a bit of literature specifically on the current insurgent\nmovement of JASLWJ in the northern part of Nigeria, there\nis a dearth of studies that tried to determine the extent to\nwhich poor governance and corruption has exacerbated the\nactivities of the militant groups. Most of the analyses in this\nliterature were based on the emergence of the group through\na religious prism. Although Aghedo and Osumah (2012) pas-\nsively tried to relate the Boko Haram insurgency with the\nfailure of leadership to provide basic needs, their study con-\ncentrated more on the radical ideology of the group, noting\nthe excessive killings of non-Muslims as well as the attempt\nto impose shari'a, Islamic law, in the country. However, the\ngroup's radical approach has led to the death of both inno-\ncent Muslims and Christians by suicide bombings and direct\ngun attacks.\nIn his study, Adesoji (2010) gave a chronological over-\nview of radical Islamic sects and their quest to implement the\nIslamic justice system in secular countries such as Nigeria.\nThe study noted the strong correlation between inequality,\npoverty, and continued uprisings, be they religious, regional,\nor ethnic. Another study by Onuoha (2010) gave a general\nhistorical account of the emergence of Boko Haram and its\nsubsequent confrontation with the Nigerian government. It\nalso suggested that the bloody and violent confrontation with\ngovernment signified a link between the group and interna-\ntional terrorist organizations like Al-Qaida. Although this\nstudy cited Nigerian system decay as a pivotal reason for the\nescalation of violence, it did not provide empirical evidence\nto support the theory. In another related study, Waldek and\nJayasekara (2011) tried to unveil the historical evolution of\nBoko Haram's leadership, its operational strategy, and its\nhierarchal structure. It also attempted to evaluate the group's\nconnection with other radical groups within the regional and\ninternational borders.\nCook's (2011) study about Boko Haram started by analyz-\ning the evolution of radical Islam in Nigeria, as well as the\nnumerous Muslim sects in Northern Nigeria and the rivalry\nthat existed among them. The study attempted to draw a\nmajor inference that the period of democratization of Nigeria\nstarting in 1999 rekindled the quest by many Muslims to\nadopt the shari'a legal system in the northern part of the\ncountry. This gave Boko Haram the impetus to propagate its\npuritanical views about the doctrines of Islam, and provided\na platform for the group to recruit the huge population of\nIslamic adherents. The study noted that one of the main rea-\nsons for the upsurge in membership of Boko Haram was the\nextra-judicial killing of the leader of the group, Mohammed\nYusuf, by the Nigerian police.\nOther studies on Boko Haram (Onapajo & Uzodike, 2012;\nOnapajo, Uzodike, & Whetho, 2012) suggested multidimen-\nsional reasons for the emergence of the group. The major\nimpetus proffered by these studies was the antagonist stand\ntoward Western civilization. Coupled with the failure of the\ngovernment to improve the lives of Nigerian citizens, this\naggravated the abhorrence of Western institutions, although\nthese studies took only a cursory look at the widespread pov-\nerty as a reason for the emergence of Boko Haram. The study\ndepended wholly on secondary sources of data for its analy-\nsis, but our study has augmented these with primary sources\nof data to elicit more concise findings on the phenomenon.\nAnother study (Salaam, 2012) suggests that the history of\nBoko Haram is synchronized with the lag in Western educa-\ntion in northern Nigeria. The disparity between the northern\nand southern regions in their attainment of Western educa-\ntion has played a major role in the rise of militant groups.\nBoth before and after Nigeria gained independence from the\nUnited Kingdom in 1960, the northern region remained\nbackward in Western education. This was because, in north-\nern region, Western education was perceived as an alien phi-\nlosophy, and was considered a tool used by the Christian\nmissionaries. This attitude continues to the modern day, and\nthe gap grows wider as the population increases. The study\npointed out the important role of poverty and unemployment\nin the region as a major trigger for the group's activities; this\nis also in line with our argument in this research. However,\nwe have delved further to expound how this is related to poor\ngovernance, as well as to the threats to the Nigerian state\nfrom the two major violent groups.\nored to analyze radical militancy in Northern Nigeria from a\nhistorical prism of colonialism. The fusion of Western civili-\nzation into the semi-feudalistic society of Northern Nigeria\nduring the colonial era brought about sudden change. As to\n4 SAGE Open\nbe expected, many people were resistant to the change; this\nled to the emergence of several sects, all professing Islam but\nopposed to each other. The study suggested that Boko Haram\nis an extension of the numerous sects that emerged in north-\nern Nigeria following independence.\nConceptual Framework\nIn trying to understand how poor governance fueled the\nunrest and provided an enabling environment for the JASLWJ\nto recruit members, it is necessary to contextualize the con-\ncept of governance. In conceptualizing governance,\nKaufmann (2005) illustrated its three main elements: politi-\ncal, economic, and institutional dimensions, thus defining\ngovernance as follows:\nThe traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is\nexercised for the common good . . . the government capacity to\neffectively manage its resources and implement sound policies,\nand the respect of citizens and the state for the country's\nRotberg (2009) posited that \"governance is the delivery of\nhigh quality political goods to citizens by government of all\nkinds . . . political goods are security and safety, rule of law,\nparticipation and human rights, sustainable economic oppor-\nability of the government to provide its people with the basic\nneeds and satisfaction remains the paramount objective of\ngovernment. Rotberg (2004) further stressed that when sov-\nereign countries are battered by continuous internal unrest\nand failure to deliver the basic needs to the populace, the\nnation tends to fail. Burgoon (2006) described how social\nwelfare policies such as social security, provision of health\ncare, education, and employment would go a long way in\nreducing poverty, general insecurity, political and religious\nextremism, thereby reducing the tendency for violent mili-\ntancy in a society. Good governance is essential for maintain-\ning and sustaining the legitimacy of authority; its absence\nbecomes poor governance, allowing poverty, crimes, and\ncorruption to mushroom, affecting the performance of\nauthority and weakening its legitimacy.\nHence, this article uses some sections of Ted Robert\nGurr's Relative Deprivation (RD) theory. Gurr (1970)\ndefined RD as\nactors' perception of discrepancy between their value\nexpectations and their value capabilities. Value expectations are\nthe goods and conditions of life to which people believe they\nare rightfully entitled. Value capabilities are the goods and\nconditions they think they are capable of getting and keeping\n. . . and value position is the amount or level of value actually\nattained.\nThese values are multidimensional and are comprised of\nthose things humans struggle to have for their sustenance.\nGurr categorizes the values into three groups: welfare values\n(economic and self-actualization), power values (participa-\ntion in society and security), and interpersonal (relationships\nand place in society).\nThe theory suggests that the larger the discrepancy\nbetween the expectations and the capabilities of people, the\ngreater the depth of discontent. In a society with inequitable\ndistribution of social and economic goods, when people\ncompare their current value position with that of others\nwithin their society who are better off, and they know they\nhold the same legitimate right and privilege to have what\nthose others have, it triggers an atmosphere of tension that\nleads to violence (Bowen, 1977). This theory explains how\ndeprivation of social and economic goods leads to frustra-\ntion, aggression, and ultimately to collective violence. When\npeople are denied the basic needs of life, especially when\nthose in charge of the distribution of social and economic\ngoods live flamboyant lives, it creates an atmosphere of ten-\nsion that often leads to a combustible violence. Hence, this\ntheory is suitable to explain how corruption and bad gover-\nnance by the Nigerian elite widened the population's social\nand economic gap, thus creating an atmosphere of discontent\nand protest, and resulting in violence. The return of democ-\nracy to the Nigeria in 1999, after 30 years of military rule,\ncreated high expectations of a rewarding future for the peo-\nple of the country under a transparent and accountable gov-\nernment. However, the tenets of democracy were\ncompromised by the ruling elites, causing grievances and\nradicalization. This article uses the RD theory to explore how\npoor governance led to RD and consequently fueled mili-\ntancy, particularly after the return of democracy to Nigeria.\nThe RD theory illustrates how deprivation of social and eco-\nnomic goods leads to frustration, aggression, and violence.\nThe escalation of poverty and unemployment in northern\nNigeria has drastically increased the potential for recruit-\nment by militant groups in the region. It is with this backdrop\nthat we hypothesize that poor governance in Nigeria has\nbeen equally responsible for the upsurge in activity of the\ninsurgent group JASLWJ.\nFindings\nNorthern Nigeria, which was once a separate colony, con-\ntains the vast majority of poor people in the country (see\nAppendix A). The pervasive backwardness of Northern\nNigeria was ignored by its longest serving military ruling\nelites before they handed over power to a democratic govern-\nof democracy to the country, the basic primary education\nenrollment in the northern region was below 60% and even\nAs such, there is a wide difference in the literacy level\nbetween the northern and southern parts of the country.\nBorno, a state in the northern part, has a 14.5% literacy level,\nwhereas Lagos, a state in the south, achieved 92.0% (United\nSuleiman and Karim 5\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\n2012). Furthermore, even in the democratic era, the states in\nthe region did nothing to mitigate the issue, for instance,\nsince the return of democracy, Yobe has consistently allo-\ncated an average of 16% of its total budget to education,\nwhereas the health sector is allocated 6% (Chinedu &\nOlabimtan, 2010). However, even with such rates of alloca-\ntion, the education sector remains in poor condition (see\nis in the south of the country, was able to build more primary\nschools, as well as improve the teaching capability of the\nteachers, whereas in Yobe, the teaching skills of the majority\nof the teachers continue to deteriorate. Essentially, while\nsome of the state budget for education pays the salaries of\nunqualified teachers, other funds drain into the funnel of\ncorruption.\nIn addition, in the northeast region, the health situation\nhas worsened (see Appendix C), and also the level of mater-\nnal and child health has been retrogressing.About 139 deaths\nin 1,000 in the southern states. This is a result of a lack of\nmedical services (Doctor, Bairagi, Findley, Helleringer, &\nDahiru, 2011). Informants interviewed in this study believe\nthat the reoccurring uprising by JASLWJ in northern Nigeria,\nthough purporting to be religious, has been triggered mainly\nby government corruption that escalated the level of poverty,\nunemployment, and lack of basic needs for the people, which\nin turn generated the radicalization of unemployed youth.\nAlthough there are studies (such as Abadie, 2004; Krueger &\nand lack of education do not necessarily lead people to acts\nof terrorism, other studies (such as Blomberg, Hess, &\nhow the reduction of poverty could reduce terrorism acts. In\nthe context of Nigeria, and particularly in the case of the\nJASLWJ, the high level of corruption by public officials,\nwhich has occasioned the persistent level of unemployment\nand poverty, has created an environment of social tension,\nresulting in an increased recruitment of youths to the ranks of\nmilitancy.\nIn the northern region, Kano has been the commercial\nnerve state from the pre-colonial era to modern northern\nNigeria, and remains the industrial hub of the region.\nHowever, this is fast becoming a mirage, as the economic\npotential of the region has been crumbling due to a multitude\nof reasons: in particular, the collapse of agriculture, depen-\ndency on oil rents, and the near total absence of electricity\nsupplied to industries in the last decade. These issues have\nsignificantly affected the socio-economic health of the\nregion, resulting in unemployment and poverty. The rate of\nunemployment (see Table 2) has significantly increased in\nnorthern states where the JASLWJ has attracted followers.\nEven though the statistics provided by the government are\noften highly underestimated, the published rates of unem-\nployment are alarming.\nTable 1. Comparisons Between Yobe State and Ekiti State.\nStates Population\nNumber of primary class\nTotal number of\nteachers\nTotal number of teachers\nqualified to teach (%)\nTotal pupil enrolment\nTable 2. Unemployment Rates in Some Selected Northern States.\nStates\nYear\n6 SAGE Open\nThe JASLWJ is largely perceived to be an Islamic move-\nment where radical elements are trying to impose Islamic\nlaws, and in the process killing non-Muslims. However,\nrecently, the victims of the JASLWJ activities have been\nmembers of all faiths existing within the country. In\nNovember 2014, suicide bombers killed several people in a\nmosque where Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II had previously\ncastigated the movement of the group as un-Islamic, and he\ncalled on all Nigerians to protect themselves against the\ngroup (\"Emir of Kano, Sanusi, Urges Nigerians to Defend\nSelves Against Boko Haram,\" 2014). The group is no\nrespecter of any faith; even though they profess to champion\nIslam, their activities revealed the contrary by the wanton\nkillings of innocent lives as well as forced conversion of\ntheir captives to Islam.4\nHowever, the vast majority of these victims have been\naverage Nigerians who rely on the government for social and\nphysical security. In this regard, one informant suggests that\n[F]or me it is about poverty, forget about religion because\nreligion has very little to do with it. It is poverty and the people\njust rose against those who lead them in the way that have led to\ntheir being in the kinds of condition they are. There is a complete\ndisconnect between those who are in power in Nigeria and the\npeople of Nigeria for variety of reasons . . . Nigerian state has\nbecome a criminal enterprise; that is what it is, let's be honest\nwith ourselves . . . The governors collect significant part of the\nbudget, called it security votes and put it in their pockets.\nThe JASLWJ claims it wants to eradicate the perceived\nsocial injustice in the country, and they believe this can only\nbe achieved through the establishment of and adherence to\nstrict Islamic shari'a, a belief shared by numerous Muslims\n(Falola, 1998). In fact, the call for the establishment of\nshari'a law as the formal state law did not start with the\nJASLWJ; after the return of democracy in 1999, many north-\nern political elites felt the application of shari'a law would\ncleanse the corrupt society and ensure social justice, so they\nimplemented the shari'a law in some northern states\n(Mustapha, 2010). However, the implementation of shari'a\nlaw by 12 state governors in northern Nigeria did nothing to\nprevent corruption by political elites (Brulliard, 2009); the\nruling elites continued with what some Muslims from north-\nern Nigeria consider abhorrent to shari'a. For example, a\nMuslim governor from the enclave of the JASLWJ was\ncaught on videotape giving money to an Arab prostitute in a\nclub in Dubai (Kperogi, 2012). This confirmed the percep-\ntion in the north that the law has become a political instru-\nment for achieving political gains by the elites.\nConsequently, the failure of the ruling elites, coupled with\nthe politicization of shari'a law in northern Nigeria, has\ndeepened the mistrust of government by the governed. The\napparent disregard of shari'a by the political elites contrib-\nuted to the radicalization of JASLWJ members, because the\ngroup felt the law should be implemented to its extreme.\nInstead, the political elites were using it to further their per-\nsonal agendas. JASLWJ seized the opportunity to uphold and\nradically expand the elements of shari'a law. As articulated\nby the group's purported spokesperson, Abu Qaqa, \"We have\nbeen motivated by the stark injustice in the land . . . Poor\npeople are tired of the injustice, people are crying for saviors,\nand they know the messiahs are Boko Haram\" (Monica,\n2012). This is consistent with the assertion of another infor-\nmant who averred,\nI said that whether it is in the Niger Delta or in Maiduguri or in\nJos there is always, always an initial cry for justice which is\nignored and it is the ignominy that you give to that leads to\nfrustrations, that lead to violence. I am one of those who believe\nthat clearly the social condition, though not excusable, but create\na ripe environment for these sorts of activities to strive . . .\nFurthermore, the strategic approach of citing social injus-\ntice to recruit members into the movement is evidently work-\ning. The young, unemployed Nigerians, who rarely eat more\nthan one meal a day, swiftly join the group due to the per-\nceived social injustice by the ruling elite. The Nigerian Secret\nService revealed that some communities are shielding mem-\nbers of Boko Haram (Yemi, 2012), which inevitably makes it\nvery difficult for law enforcement to curtail the group's\nactivities. People who are aggrieved about the unabated\nnature of the elites' corrupt behavior are easily recruited to\nact against the system, particularly when such calls are made\non the platform of religion. Another informant reiterates the\nrole of corruption and poverty, suggesting that\npeople who are poor, who can't afford three square meals, are\nprone and easy to be persuaded by people who could promise\nthem anything . . . poverty which is as a result of massive\ncorruptioninthecountryhasdirectcorrelationwithradicalization\nin certain element in our society. Because somebody who is\ngainfully employed, who could afford three square meals, who\nhas a family, who has a decent accommodation will hardly want\nto be a suicide bomber. (Informant 11, personal interview, March\nAvailable statistics from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics\n(NBS) have shown the social and economic disparities in\nnorthern Nigeria, particularly in the northeastern section\nwhere the activities of JASLWJ have been severe. According\npopulation in each of the northern states lives in absolute\npoverty (see Appendix A); it is implicit from this that the\nmajority of the youths there are out of a job, and they form\nunrestrained groups that roam the streets of the communities.\nOne informant concludes,\nIt is not surprising that this Boko Haram insurgency started and\nhas largely been a northeastern phenomenon. The roots of all\nthese problems are poverty and lack of opportunity, those are the\nroots of all these problems . . . when you look, you will see it is\nSuleiman and Karim 7\nyoung people between the ages of 18 and 30 that are engaged in\nmost of these activities and it is because of lack of opportunity\n. . . Boko Haram started from the Northeast because of poverty.\nIt is the fundamental issue and I think unless you address that,\nyou will continue to have this kind of problem all over the place.\nThe northern Nigerian region comprises 19 states. The\neconomy of the region has been based in the past on agricul-\nture and mining of natural resources. However, these sectors\nhave been in abysmal disarray for more than four decades,\nbecause of two particular developments, that is, the disband-\nment of regional governments, concentrating power in the\ncentral government; and almost total dependency on crude\noil revenue. Thus, overdependence on crude oil revenue by\nthe northern Nigerian ruling elites has blurred the economic\npotency of the region and subjected the citizens to artificial\nhardship. The population of northern Nigeria is mostly\nengaged in agriculture as a profession, but overemphasis of\ngovernment revenue projections has focused on seeking\ncrude oil rents from other regions, jeopardizing the potential\nof the agricultural sector of northern Nigeria. The overde-\npendence on crude oil revenue by northern political elites has\ncreated tension with the crude oil producing areas in the\nsouthern states. The culture of crude oil dependence was fur-\nther strengthened by all the 19 state governors with the return\nof democracy in 1999; producing crude oil is an easy money-\nmaking venture, which the Nigerian Constitution guarantees\nto all federating states, so the states neglected other sources\nfor revenue. The political elites have created culture in\nNigeria that is characterized by a lack of accountability and\ntransparency in governance (Aluko, 2002), as such public\nwealth is highly secretive and controlled by public officers.\nThis diverts the wealth meant for people-oriented projects to\nprivate pockets. The overreliance on crude oil rents by the\nnorthern state governors has drastically marginalized the\nlabor force, destabilized the region's productive economy,\nand has bred corruption in the management of public wealth.\nIn addition to the vast arable land in northern Nigeria,\neach of the 19 states in the region has large quantity of unex-\nploited solid mineral resources; for example, the Federal\nGovernment Report mentions indicates large deposits of\ngold as well as other solid mineral resources in the states of\nKaduna, Zamfara, Kogi, and Kebbi (Ministry of Mines and\nSteel Development, 2010). The lack of attention to the min-\ning sector has been detrimental to the economy of northern\nNigeria. Olokesusi (2010) observed that the persistent inflow\nof migrants from West African countries has increased the\nlevel of illegal mining in Nigeria, thereby causing the gov-\nernment to lose about US$30 million yearly. One of the\nmajor reasons for this lack of attention to other potential rev-\nenue sectors in northern Nigeria has been the timely reim-\nbursement of the state governments' accounts with crude oil\nrents. Solid mineral mining requires capital and long-term\ninvestment; and political elites always prefer to invest in a\nshort-term project that will yield a political profit, not neces-\nsarily as a dividend of democracy for the people.\nFurthermore, the Federal Government acknowledged that\n\"the growth, prosperity and national security of any country\nare critically dependent upon adequacy of its electricity sup-\nply industry\" (Presidential Action Committee on Power and\nPresidential Task Force on Power, 2010). However, from\npower sector with no positive improvement, as revealed by\nthe investigative panel of the National Assembly. The panel\naccused the former president Olusegun Obasanjo with com-\nplicity and corrupt practices in the matter (\"Obasanjo Denies\nPower Corruption,\" 2008). No effective action has been\ntaken to prosecute those involved, but money continues to be\nchanneled into the sector without commensurate results, and\nthe country is still struggling with insufficient power. The\nlack of electricity for industries in Nigeria, who use it as their\nmajor source of energy, has caused a number of industries\nand factories to collapse; in northern Nigeria, many indus-\ntries have closed down due to power outages. This has\nreduced the availability of jobs in northern Nigeria, increas-\ning unemployment, and adversely affecting the socio-eco-\nnomic structure of the region. This informant revealed that\nthe level of poverty and unemployment in the north has links to\nthe violence in the region . . . I personally have a factory, a\nfurniture factory for the last 25 years and when we started 1988\nat Sharada industrial estate . . . I had more than 200 people\nworking for me at that time. Now if you go to that same industrial\narea where I still have my factory there, first of all my factory is\nclosed . . . from staff strength of 200 staff to probably now 5 . . .\nSo where are those people now? They must be somewhere and\nthey must feed themselves. (Informant 12, personal interview,\nWhen large industries shut down, their now unemployed\nworkers have no money to buy goods, which causes smaller\nbusinesses to fail. This eventually results in an increase in the\nnumber of alms seekers in the street. A vivid statistic in an\nofficial report states that Kano, only 1 of the 19 northern\nStates in Nigeria, had more than three million beggars in\nthe street of an otherwise wealthy nation portend serious\ndanger; Awofeso, Ritchie, and Degeling (2003) concluded\nthat the potential for recruiting hungry children into the ranks\nof militant groups is very possible.\nPinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa (2008) argued that\n\"poverty, hunger and food insecurity, together with a very\nunequal distribution of income and other material goods,\ngenerate anger, hopelessness, and a sense of unfairness and\nlack of social justice,\" and this creates an atmosphere of\ntension that leads to violence (p. 513). The northeast part of\nthe country where the JASLWJ emerged was particularly\nbackward, and has suffered from various forms of inequal-\nity. For instance, Langer, Mustapha, and Stewart (2007)\n8 SAGE Open\nfound horizontal inequality in the northeast: Maternal mor-\ntality was 939% greater than the level found in the\nSouthwest. Moreover, the northeast is the region where in\nevery state an average of 74% of the population lives in\nabsolute poverty (see Appendix A). These types of inequal-\nities trigger violence and insurgency (Murshed & Gates,\n2003). Furthermore, other forms of horizontal inequities\nare evident in almost every social and economic aspect of\nthe region (see Appendix B: Tables B1-B5). All these ineq-\nuities have been the result of bad governance that origi-\nnated in the military era, and continues unabated in the\ndemocratic era.\nConclusion\nAs the ongoing level of corruption in the domain of gover-\nnance in Nigeria increases, the gap between the governed\nand the leaders widens. There are several former state gover-\nnors currently facing corruption charges for squandering\npublic funds. In 2013, only two governors were convicted\nthrough a plea bargain deal with the federal investigators.\nOthers escape justice, like Peter Odili, the former governor\nof Rivers state from southern Nigeria, to whom a court\ngranted a perpetual injunction, which remains in effect, to\navoid his arrest and investigation. Hence, the complete dis-\nconnect in the constitutional norms of governance, which is\nindicative of the retrogressive attitude of the political leader-\nship in various strata of the Nigerian society. This disconnect\nand the total absence of social and economic services create\na feeling of disorientation in the average citizen of the coun-\ntry, more especially the vulnerable ones that barely have\nenough to eat. This environment facilitated the recruitment\nof youths by a group that promises to bring change and solve\ntheir problems through adherence to puritanical religious\ndoctrines.\nThis article has argued that poor governance in Nigeria\nhas changed the internal dynamics of the socio-political and\neconomic systems of the country. Political leaders, particu-\nlarly in northern Nigeria, are receiving revenue from sales of\ncrude oil every month, thereby jeopardizing other potentially\nproductive sectors of economic development in the region.\nThe near total absence of basic infrastructure, coupled with\ndependence on crude oil revenue, has centralized the wealth\nof the northern states in the hands of ruling elites. This has\ncaused pervasive corruption in public governance, thus\nnegating the primary objective of adhering to the basic attri-\nbutes of good governance as enshrined in the Nigerian\nconstitution.\nAlthough JASLWJ has been known for its fundamental-\nist doctrine, this article concludes that a major reason for its\nsurge of activity has not been religious fervor, but the level of\nsocial injustice that gave rise to poverty and unemployment\nin the country. Curtailing the activities of the group would\nrequire the political elites to address one deep-seated issue:\npervasive corruption. Furthermore, until and unless the\nleaders recognize crude oil as a secondary source of revenue\nand revitalize other existing sources of income, social and\neconomic justice and a sustainable economy in Nigeria will\nin all probability continue to be dwarfed by corruption.\nAppendix A\nComparison Between North and South Poverty\nAppendix B\n(Tables B1-B5: Some comparison on the provision of\nsome social services between some selected states the\nJASLWJ attracted its membership, with other states in\nNigeria)\npopulation in\nabsolute poverty\n(northern states) %\npopulation in\nabsolute poverty\n(southern states) %\nSource.
