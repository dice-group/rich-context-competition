    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe slope of the set size function as a critical statistic first gained favor in the 1960s due in large\npart to the seminal papers on short-term memory search by Saul Sternberg and soon, many\nothers. In the 1980s, the slope statistic reemerged in much the same role in visual search as\nAnne Treisman and again, soon many others brought that research topic into great prominence.\nThis note offers the historical and current perspective of the present author, who has devoted a\nsignificant portion of his theoretical efforts to this and related topics over the past 50 years.\n",

Townsend\nIndiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA\n Keywords\ncurrent perspective, historical perspective, slope of set size, visual search\nWithin the now established and rather enormous field of visual search, Kristjansson (2015)\nargued forcefully in his original i-Perception article against the employment of slopes of set\nsize functions. Wolfe (2016) responds that he agrees with many of the former author's points\nbut cautions against ``throwing out the baby with the bath water,'' due to this statistic's\noverall utility. Kristjansson replies (this issue) that applying the Townsend and Ashby (1978)\nInverse Efficiency Score to neutralize SAT effects, slope differences remain in his original\nexperiment. This brief article is in response to the editor's kind invitation to expand and\nreinterpret my original review in the form of a theoretical or philosophical or methodological\nnote. Thus, the present note offers my perspective on these matters.\nAlthough specific questions within this and similar issues can often be answered definitively\nby experimental facts, mathematics, or logic, many other questions lie on a continuum\nbetween ``fact'' and what must be judged as personal and debatable philosophy of science.\nI believe the following claims partake of some degree at several levels of debate.\n(I) Slopes from the Standpoint of the Architecture of Search (usually restricted to parallel\nand serial architectures, with the understanding that our use of ``architecture'' does not\nCorresponding author:\nEmail: jtownsen@indiana.edu\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nnecessarily imply immutability): I have maintained for almost 50 years that slopes, or\nmore generally, increases in response times (RTs) as a function of set size, n, are\nprimarily an indicant of work load capacity, not architecture. Thus, slopes generally\nserve as an ineffectual statistic to test architectures against one another. However, there\nis (and always has been) an asymmetry of logic here: Non-zero slopes are readily, and\nintuitively, produced by serial as well as limited capacity parallel models, but zero\nslopes or slopes associated with unlimited (or super!) capacity parallel models, are\nbiologically and psychologically incompatible with serial processing.\n(II) Doctrines Concerning Slopes: There are several assumptions associated with tying in the\nslope statistic with theories of search, as opposed to the slope performing simply as a\ndescriptive statistic:\n(1) Among these, perhaps most relevant to the current discussion and one emphasized\nby Kristjansson, is the principle that the slope should be an invariant across certain\nexperimental manipulations such as response type. Such restriction is a valuable tool\nof theory construction--for instance, invariance is one of the most central concepts\nat all levels of modern physics. However, the scientist should always be aware of the\nextra theoretical baggage attending such an assumption. In the present milieu, this\nprinciple seems most compatible with a highly constricted version of serial\nprocessing. For instance, consider an experiment using Response Type A and\nsuppose the data are well predicted by a standard serial model (i.e., the processing\ntimes are the same random variable for all items, are stochastically independent and\nadditive). Now contemplate the parallel class of models that perfectly mimic this\nserial model. The invariant search axiom seems quite natural for the standard serial\nmodel when we move to experiments with Response Type B. It may seem far less\ncogent that parallel rates are such as to predict that invariance.\n(2) With further regard to the theme just above, the conclusion that attentive visual search\nis serial has always been unwarranted or at least on shaky ground. The field of short-\nterm memory search formerly made the same mistake of inferring that approximately\nstraight line (and non-zero sloped) mean response time set size functions alone imply\nseriality (although it is important to mention that, unlike most others, the progenitor,\nSaul Sternberg (e.g., 1966), employed additional evidence such as addition of cumulant\nstatistics, to back up his claims). Again stressing the asymmetric nature of inference\nhere, flat mean RT set size pop out effects do falsify reasonable serial models.\nAdditionally, it is not even clear that the huge corpus of memory set size curves in\nthe literature are always straight lines, but rather better fit as log functions, as was\nemphatically demonstrated early on by Swanson & Briggs (1969). Recent evidence\nstrongly points to early visual processing being unlimited capacity parallel with an\nexhaustive processing stopping rule which predicts a curve well approximated as a\nlogarithmic function (Buetti, Cronin, Madison, Wang, & Lleras, 2016). If set size\ncurves are not even straight lines, then much of the present-day inference-drawing\nbased on slopes, seems ill advised. Finally, note that considerably more power in\ninference is bestowed when the scientist includes several stopping rules in the same\nstudy (e.g., see Townsend & Ashby, 1983, Chapter 4, Section: The Capacity Issue).\n(III) Nulling Out Speed Accuracy Tradeoffs: Processing capacity has always been one of my\nmajor concerns from the very first papers on psychological processing systems (e.g., see\nTownsend, 1972, 1974). Of course, when accuracy varies, ever since the seminal works\nof psychologists like Wayne Wickelgren and Robert Pachella, we have realized that we\nmust take into account both errors and speed when assessing capacity. Townsend and\nAshby (1978) deliberate on many aspects of psychological processing systems relating\nto capacity, among them speed accuracy tradeoffs. They propose as a rough and\napproximate method of cancelling out speed accuracy tradeoffs, the statistic\n(employing Kristjansson's terminology) inverse efficiencies (IES) \u00bc Mean RT/\n(1\u00c0Mean Error Rate). If the scientist knows the true model (impossible to be sure,\nand please observe the inescapable model dependency in this context), then the best way\nto null out speed accuracy tradeoffs is to estimate the parameter(s) associated with\nefficiency such as the serial or parallel rates of processing of, say, correct and\nincorrect information. IES will likely inevitably be a very coarse approximation to\nsuch a statistic. Although I (and I imagine Ashby) very much appreciate application\nof IES, more information would be helpful in proving that its use here justifies the\ninference concerning slope changes. For instance, if one can show (and this is\npotentially achievable) that IES is at least as conservative as, for instance, measuring\nthe rates of processing in Poisson versions of serial or parallel models (see, e.g.,\nTownsend & Ashby, 1983, Chapter 9), then the inference drawn by Kristjansson\ngains in credibility. Showing that a particular model provides excellent predictions\nand fits and then using the appropriate parameters to cancel out decisional effects\nwould be even more impressive.\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, the science of visual search would profit by utilizing the now\nsubstantial battery of experimental procedures that provide quite precise and sturdy\nassessment of critical aspects of processing such as architecture, workload capacity,\nstopping rule, and independence. Many of these are distribution and parameter free. Then,\nsuch statistics such as slope and more generally the curvature of the mean RT set size\nfunction for various stopping rules can be engaged as dependent variables to study how\nvarious conditions, individual differences (including various pathologies), and experimental\ndemands affect the underlying processing structure and mechanisms.
