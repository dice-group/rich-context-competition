Prescription Opioid Abuse; Societal\nCosts; Economic Burden; Drug Abuse\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, the abuse, dependence, and misuse of\nprescription drugs has become a growing public health\nconcern in the United States. National estimates from the\n2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\nreported that 12.5 million Americans had used prescrip-\ntion pain relievers for nonmedical purposes, up from 11.0\nmately 1.7 million met the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for abuse or\ndependence [2]. The 2007 Treatment Episodes Data Set\n(TEDS) reported that the number of patients admitted to\nsubstance abuse treatment facilities due to nonheroin\nopiate/opioid abuse nearly quadrupled from 23,000 to\nDisease Control and Prevention reported in 2009 that\nopioid-related poisoning deaths have more than tripled\nsince 1999 [4]. The growing prevalence of prescription\nopioid abuse, dependence, and misuse (\"opioid abuse\") is\ndiscussed further in White et al. [5].\nAs part of the effort to curb the growth of opioid abuse, 34\nstates have initiated prescription drug monitoring pro-\ngrams (PDMPs) with the purpose of identifying drug abuse\nand diversion [6]. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA) has recently required certain opioid manu-\nfacturers to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy (REMS) to manage potentially risky prescription\ndrugs and ensure that their benefits outweigh their risks\n[7]. Despite these initiatives to address opioid abuse,\nresearch on the societal economic burden of opioid abuse\nis limited (e.g., caregiver burden and presenteeism are\nignored, as are aspects of the cost to the criminal justice\nsystem). Studies by the Office of National Drug Control\nPolicy (ONDCP) and the National Center on Addiction and\nWiley Periodicals, Inc.\nSubstance Abuse report that the overall costs of drug\nabuse are substantial, but do not quantify the societal\nburden of opioid abuse specifically [8,9].\nIn a recent review of the literature, Strassels documented\nthe high costs associated with opioid abuse and cited the\nestimate by Birnbaum et al. that the societal costs of\nwas attributable to lost workplace productivity, 30% ($3.6\nbillion) to health care, and 17% ($2.0 billion) to criminal\njustice [10,11]. Focusing specifically on the health care\nexcess (i.e., relative to matched controls) annual health\ncare costs per opioid abuse patient in a privately insured\npopulation were $17,768, while the diagnosed prevalence\nthat period [12]. Among Medicaid patients, McAdam-\nMarx et al. reported costs per abuse patient during 2002\u00ad\nthe diagnosed prevalence of opioid abuse in the Medicaid\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the societal\ncosts associated with prescription opioid abuse in the\nUnited States in 2007, drawing on data from a number of\ndifferent sources. Specifically, this research updates and\nexpands on previous research [11] by including the\nburden on caregivers (i.e., spouses and dependents of\ninsurance subscribers) as well as additional criminal\njustice and lost productivity components (e.g., presentee-\nism costs). The results are disaggregated into three\nprimary categories: health care, criminal justice, and lost\nworkplace productivity.\nMethods\nData\nThis study relied on administrative claims data and on\nestimate the societal costs of prescription opioid abuse\n(see Table 1). All data presented are from the most recent\nsurvey or data set for which they are reported, through\n2007. For all cost estimates, data are converted to the\nmost recently available year, 2009 USD using the relevant\nconsumer price index (CPI) or hourly compensation index\n(HCI) (e.g., the CPI for Medical Care was used to adjust\nhealth care costs, the HCI was used to adjust wages for\nwork loss costs, and the All Items CPI was used for other\ncost adjustments) published by the Bureau of Labor Sta-\ntistics. Administrative claims data were used to estimate\nexcess medical and prescription drug costs as well as\nexcess medically related absenteeism and disability costs\nfor patients diagnosed with opioid abuse. Secondary\nsources, including academic research, government\nsurveys and publications, and private/nonprofit research,\nwere used in calculating substance abuse treatment, pre-\nvention and research costs, criminal justice costs, and lost\nworkplace productivity costs. The manner in which these\nsources were used in context of the cost calculations is\ndescribed below (see Cost Analysis section).\nDe-identified administrative claims data used here\nincluded a large privately insured population and the\nFlorida Medicaid beneficiaries. The privately insured data-\nbase covers approximately nine million lives, for services\nmation from 40 self-insured companies, which operate\nnationwide in a broad array of industries and job classifi-\ncations. The data include demographic and enrollment\ninformation as well as medical, prescription drug, and\ndisability claims for all beneficiaries (i.e., employees,\nspouses, and dependents). The medical claims contain\ndiagnoses based on codes from the International Classi-\nfication of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification\n(ICD-9-CM), dates, place, type of service, and amounts\npaid to providers. The drug claims contain information on\nall prescriptions such as fill date, National Drug Code,\ndays of supply, quantity, and amount paid.\nThe Florida Medicaid data cover all Medicaid-eligible ben-\neficiaries (over six million lives) between Q3:1997\u00ad\nQ2:2006. The information contained in the Medicaid data\nis similar to that of the privately insured claims data,\nalthough it was not possible to link information at the\nfamily level to identify caregivers.\nStudy Sample: Claims Data\nThree study samples were identified and matched to con-\ntrols: privately insured opioid abuse patients (and a subset\nof abuse patients who were employed with available work\nloss data), caregivers of privately insured opioid abuse\npatients, and Florida Medicaid opioid abuse patients.\nPatients were classified as having opioid abuse by identi-\nfying those persons with at least one medical claim asso-\nciated with at least one ICD-9-CM diagnosis for opioid\ndefined as the index date): 304.0 (opioid type depen-\ndence), 304.7 (combinations of opioid type dependence\nwith any other drug dependence), 305.5 (opioid abuse),\nand 965.0 (poisoning by opiates and related narcotics)\nexcluding 965.01 (poisoning by heroin). Opioid abuse\npatients were required to have at least 6 months of con-\ntinuous eligibility pre- and postindex date and be 12\u00ad64\nyears old on their index date.\nMany definitions of opioid abuse and dependence exist in\nthe literature, with little agreement on which is correct.\nNote that this study focuses on costs of patients diag-\nnosed with opioid abuse, consistent with White et al., and\ntherefore does not account for undiagnosed opioid abuse\npatients [12]. Where data on diagnosed abuse was\nunavailable (which it was for many secondary sources),\nthis study relied on the DSM-IV definition of abuse/\ndependence, to the extent possible.\nCaregivers of privately insured opioid abuse patients (i.e.,\nbeneficiaries sharing the same plan as an opioid abuse\nBirnbaum et al.\nTable 1 Description of data sources\nData source Cost component Description\n[A] Privately insured employer claims data Excess medical, drug, medically related\nabsenteeism, and disability costs\nAdministrative claims for services provided\nFortune 500 companies with locations\nacross the United States\n[B] Florida Medicaid data Excess medical, drug, medically related\nabsenteeism, and disability costs\nAdministrative claims for all Medicaid-eligible\nbeneficiaries for services provided during\n[C] Hadley et al.

Controls were\nselected as patients who did not have any diagnoses\nassociated with opioid abuse in their claims history, were\nnot considered a caregiver of an opioid abuse patient, had\nat least one medical or drug claim during the study period,\nand met similar age and eligibility requirements. Controls\nwere identified and assigned for all opioid abuse patients.\nSee Table 2 for a description of the demographic profile\nand Charlson Comorbidity Index of the claims data\nsamples.\nCost Analysis\nPrevious studies of the costs of substance abuse provide a\nuseful framework for identifying the major cost categories\nof health care, criminal justice, and lost workplace produc-\ntivity [8,9,11]. A prevalence-based estimation approach\nwas used except when estimating productivity losses due\nto premature death, in which total costs were assigned to\nthe year in which the death occurred. While each category\nconsisted of multiple components that required specific\ncalculations, following previous research, two general\napproaches were used to estimate costs: 1) a quantity\nmethod and (2) an apportionment method [11]. The quan-\ntity method multiplies the estimated cost per opioid abuse\npatient by the relevant number of opioid abuse patients.\nThe apportionment method begins with the overall cost of\ndrug abuse for a particular cost component (taken from a\nsecondary data source) and allocates a cost associated\nwith opioid abuse based on its prevalence relative to overall\nabuse, as estimated from the number of persons reporting\nabuse or dependence on prescription opioids in the past\nsources for each of the cost analysis methods used for\neach cost category described below.\nHealth Care Costs\nHealth care costs consist of excess medical and drug\ncosts, and substance abuse treatment, prevention, and\nresearch costs. Excess medical and drug costs were cal-\nculated for both privately insured (Table 1, source [A]) and\nFlorida Medicaid (Table 1, source [B]) opioid abuse\npatients and privately insured caregivers using the quantity\nmethod: excess per-patient costs (costs of patients minus\ncontrols derived from actual amounts paid to providers\nfrom the claims data) were calculated for all three patient\ngroups, then multiplied by the relevant number of opioid\nabuse patients (derived from NSDUH {Table 1, source\n[G]}, who are apportioned to private insurance and Med-\nicaid using TEDS {Table 1, source [H]}), or caregivers\n(derived as the ratio of caregivers to opioid abuse patients\nin the privately insured sample {Table 1, source [A]}). To\naccount for differences between Florida Medicaid patients\nand the national population insured by Medicaid, costs of\nFlorida Medicaid opioid abuse patients were nationally\nadjusted using the ratio of average spending per Florida\nTable 2 Demographics and Charlson Comorbidity Index: Privately Insured and Florida Medicaid\nCharacteristic\nPrivately insured Privately insured Caregivers Florida Medicaid\nOpioid abuse\npatients\nControls\nCaregivers of\nopioid abuse\npatients\nControls\nOpioid abuse\npatients\nControls\n% % % % % %\nDemographics\nAge (years)\nGender\nCharlson comorbidity index\nNote: Opioid abuse = opioid abuse, dependence, and misuse.\nBirnbaum et al.\nMedicaid beneficiary to spending per US Medicaid ben-\neficiary (Table 1, source [E]). Excess medical and drug\ncosts for Medicare and uninsured opioid abuse patients\nand their caregivers were estimated by applying a national\nMedicaid-to-Medicare spending ratio (Table 1, sources [D]\nand [E]) and a privately insured-to-uninsured spending\nratio (Table 1, source [C]), respectively.\nTreatment, prevention, and research costs were calcu-\nlated using the apportionment method, by identifying total\nfederal, state, local, and private expenditures on sub-\nstance abuse treatment, prevention, and research\n(Table 1, sources [I], [J], and [L]) and multiplying by the\nproportion associated with opioids (based on the preva-\nlence of opioid abuse relative to overall drug abuse;\nTable 1, sources [G], [F], and [H]).\nCriminal Justice Costs\nCalculations for criminal justice costs used the apportion-\nment method to estimate spending associated with opioid\nabuse on police protection, legal and adjudication, cor-\nrectional facilities, and property lost due to crime. For each\ncost component, total spending was identified using data\nfrom the Criminal Justice Expenditures and Employment\nExtract Program (Table 1, source [P]) and the proportion\nrelated to opioid abuse was estimated based on the ratio\nof arrests (for police protection and legal and adjudication\ncomponents) or incarcerations (for correctional facilities\ncomponent) attributable to opioid abuse. Arrests or incar-\ncerations attributable to opioid abuse were estimated by\nfirst apportioning total arrests or incarcerations for drug\nlaw violations and other income-generating and violent\ncrimes (Table 1, sources [M], [O], [R]) to overall drug abuse\nusing published attribution factors (e.g., 100% of drug\nviolations and 30% of burglaries are attributable to drug\nabuse; Table 1, source [T]), and then apportioning further\nby multiplying by the ratio of opioid abuse relative to\noverall drug abuse (Table 1, source [G]) for income-\ngenerating and violent crimes, and by the ratio of prescrip-\ntion opioids identified as a percentage of all controlled and\nuncontrolled substances secured in law enforcement\noperations (Table 1, source [Q]) for drug law violations.\nLost Workplace Productivity Costs\nLost workplace productivity costs using the human capital\napproach were calculated using both the quantity and\napportionment methods [33]. Similar to excess medical\nand drug costs, excess medically related absenteeism\n(i.e., days of lost work due to medical utilization multiplied\nby daily wage) and disability (i.e., days of lost work due to\ndisability multiplied by daily benefits received) costs were\ncalculated for privately insured employed opioid abuse\npatients and extrapolated using the quantity method,\nwhich multiplies per-patient costs by the number of\nemployees with opioid abuse (Table 1, sources [A], [G]\nand [H]). Presenteeism costs (i.e., diminished on-the-job\nproductivity) were calculated for employees with opioid\nabuse and for employed caregivers using a ratio approach\nused in Goetzel et al. [31] that estimates average presen-\nteeism costs as a percentage of total medical, drug,\nabsenteeism, and disability costs (Table 1, source [Y]).\nLost productivity due to incarceration was estimated by\nmultiplying the per inmate cost of incarceration, in terms of\nlost wages (calculated as the weighted average of annual\nexpected earnings; Table 1, sources [W] and [U]), by the\nnumber of inmates incarcerated for crimes attributable to\nopioid abuse (described above; Table 1, sources [M], [O],\n[T], [Q], and [G]). The costs of lost wages/employment\nwere calculated using the apportionment method, by mul-\ntiplying total lost wages due to lower wages and higher\nunemployment associated with all drug abuse (Table 1,\nsources [T] and [V]) by the proportion associated with\nopioid abuse (Table 1, source [G]).\nFinally, consistent with Birnbaum et al. [11], the costs of\npremature death were calculated by estimating the net\npresent value of lifetime earnings (using a 6% discount\nrate; Table 1, sources [W], [U]), weighted by age and\ngender (Table 1, source [X]) and multiplying by the number\nof deaths related to opioid abuse identified from the Drug\nAbuse Warning Network (DAWN; Table 1, source [K]).\nResults\nThe total societal costs of prescription opioid abuse in\nworkplace productivity contributed $25.6 billion, health\ncare costs contributed $25.0 billion, and criminal justice\ncosts accounted for the remaining $5.1 billion (Figure 1).\nTable 3 shows cost estimates for all components of health\ncare, criminal justice, and workplace costs.\nLost Workplace Productivity Costs\nLost workplace productivity costs contributed the largest\nshare of total societal costs with approximately $25.6\nbillion, or 45.9%, of total societal costs. Of the workplace\ncosts, the cost of premature death was the largest com-\nwages/employment and presenteeism were the next two\ncostliest components, contributing $7.9 billion (31.0%) and\n$2.0 billion (8.0%), respectively. Excess medically related\nabsenteeism and incarceration costs accounted for com-\n(6.9%), respectively, while excess disability costs\naccounted for only $807 million (3.2%). Employees with\nmedically related absenteeism and disability costs, while\ncaregivers contributed the remaining 35.5% and 9.9%,\nrespectively.\nHealth Care Costs\nHealth care costs accounted for approximately $25.0\nbillion, or 44.9%, of total societal costs, of which excess\nmedical and drug costs were the main drivers, contributing\nfor over 92% of excess medical and drug costs, with\ntheir caregivers accounting for the remainder. Medicaid\nSocietal Costs of Prescription Opioid Abuse\npatients and caregivers combined contributed approxi-\nmately one-third of total excess medical and drug costs,\nprivately insured and uninsured patients and caregivers\ncontributed slightly less than one-third each, and Medicare\npatients and caregivers accounted for only 4.6%.\nOf total health care costs, substance abuse treatment,\nprevention, and research all contributed a substantially\nsmaller amount, accounting for costs of $1.1 billion\ntively. Substance abuse research and prevention expen-\nditures together contributed merely 0.3% of the total\nsocietal costs, with the majority of funding provided by\nfederal sources. Treatment, in contrast, contributed a\nslightly larger share of the total, 2.0%, and consisted\nprimarily of state and local expenditures, followed by\nfederal and private funding.\nCriminal Justice Costs\nCriminal justice costs contributed approximately $5.1\nbillion, or 9.2% of the total societal costs, of which cor-\nrectional facilities accounted for the largest share with\n$2.3 billion (44.1%). Of these correctional facility costs,\nnearly two-thirds were incurred at the state level. Of total\ncriminal justice costs, police protection contributed $1.5\nbillion (29.7%), legal and adjudication costs accounted for\nDiscussion\nThe results of this analysis document that the growing\nproblem of prescription opioid abuse places a substantial\neconomic burden on society, specifically in the realms\nof health care, criminal justice, and lost workplace\nproductivity.\nImplications\nThese findings provide further evidence that prescription\nopioid abuse is an increasing and substantial burden on\nsociety that needs to be addressed in a comprehensive\nmanner. As discussed above, the impact of opioid abuse\nnot only affects the health outcomes and costs of the US\npopulation ($25.0 billion), but also imposes a large eco-\nnomic burden on the workplace ($25.6 billion), the justice\nsystem ($5.1 billion), and society as a whole ($55.7\nbillion). Although differences in data and methods pre-\nclude exact comparison with previous societal estimates\n[11], it is clear that the costs of opioid abuse have\nincreased substantially due to changes in the prevalence\nof opioid abuse and associated costs.

[11]) in the prevalence of\nopioid abuse (approximately 13%), the excess cost per\nopioid abuse patient (47% after adjusting for inflation), the\ncost of substance abuse treatment (up to 48%), the pro-\nportion of substance abuse admissions attributable to\nopioids (138%), and total police and legal expenditures\nReducing the substantial economic burden of prescription\nopioid abuse will require sustained efforts from academic\nresearchers, industry, health care providers, and govern-\nment to implement appropriate actions. A number of ini-\ntiatives to reduce the prevalence of opioid abuse are\nalready underway. For example, government initiatives\nsuch as the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic\nReporting Act (NASPER) have allocated funding for the\ncreation and enhancement of state PDMPs [34]. The FDA\nnow requires the preparation of a REMS for certain pre-\nscription opioid manufacturers. Industry has begun to\nmanufacture abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and\nclinical initiatives have included the publication and adop-\ntion of \"universal precautions\" for pain management as\nwell as the development of models to better identify\npatients at risk of opioid abuse [35\u00ad37].\nIn particular, the difference between overall societal costs\nand the current level of spending on research and preven-\ntion is quite substantial, with such expenditures together\naccounting for less than 1% of total societal costs. Thus,\nincreased funding of research and prevention programs\nmay present an opportunity for new efforts to combat the\nescalating problem of prescription opioid abuse. The ben-\nefits of investing more resources into these two compo-\nnents could be considerable, since adequate prevention\nand research programs could later result in reductions in\nexcess medical and drug costs (estimated at $23.7\nbillion), treatment costs ($1.1 billion), and other cost com-\nponents previously discussed, such as criminal justice\n($5.1 billion) and lost workplace productivity ($25.6 billion).\nThe adoption of PDMPs to identify patients at risk of\nabuse in many states is a step in the right direction, but 16\nstates still have yet to implement PDMPs, including nine\nwhich have not even passed legislation mandating their\ncreation [6].\nLimitations\nDespite the evident growth in prevalence and treatment\nadmissions associated with opioid abuse, quantifying the\ngrowth in societal costs is not straightforward; recent\nimprovements in the analytic approaches and changes in\ndata collection methodology make overall comparison\nwith previous results difficult [11]. For example, this study\ncalculates cost categories not previously estimated, such\nas those of caregivers, prevention and research, property\nlost due to crime, excess medically related absenteeism,\ndisability, and presenteeism. To further confound the com-\nparison, the current study includes costs associated with\nopioid dependence as well as abuse (which was the only\naspect of abuse considered previously), and criminal\njustice costs here include those associated with violent\ncrime. Some secondary data sources, such as DAWN and\nNSDUH, also have updated their methodologies. To the\nextent that comparisons can be made, claims data esti-\nmates are consistent with prior research and suggest an\nincrease in the costs of abuse, even after controlling for\ninflation.\nThere are several other limitations to this study. Florida\nMedicaid figures are not representative of the national\nMedicaid population, as Florida spends only $4,487 per\nMedicaid enrollee, ranking it 43rd and below the national\nwere adjusted to the US Medicaid population based on a\nper enrollee spending ratio.\nThis study is also limited by the variability among the\ndistinct secondary data sets. However, adjusting the\nopioid abuse-related allocation of a specific component\nallowed for increased compatibility among different\nsources. For example, when using the apportionment\nmethod to estimate substance abuse prevention costs\nassociated with prescription opioids, total prevention\ncosts (which include spending for illicit and prescription\ndrug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse prevention) were appor-\ntioned based on the ratio of NSDUH-reported abuse of\nprescription opioids to abuse of illicit drugs, alcohol, or\ntobacco, whereas lost wages/employment costs (which\ninclude costs due to illicit drug abuse) were apportioned\nbased on the ratio of NSDUH-reported abuse of prescrip-\ntion opioids to abuse of illicit drugs only. Notwithstanding\nthis, the different definitions and concepts of opioid abuse\nmake comparisons across data sets problematic. To the\nauthors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate\nthe different data sets in one analysis.\nIn addition to the difficulty in addressing variability\nbetween data sets, the secondary sources used have\ntheir own limitations. Data from DAWN used to calculate\nthe number of premature deaths associated with opioid\nabuse represent drug-related deaths in selected metro-\npolitan areas and states only, and may not be represen-\ntative of drug-related death patterns in areas not\nreported. To the authors' knowledge, DAWN data\nprovide the best available estimate of drug-related\ndeaths in the United States. Attribution factors from\nONDCP used to apportion arrests and incarcerations\ndue to drug abuse were developed prior to 2007, and\ntherefore may not accurately represent the proportion of\narrests and incarcerations attributable to drug abuse.\nHowever, criminal justice costs may be underestimated\nbecause the overall number of reported drug abusers\nhas grown at a much higher rate than the overall number\nof arrests since the development of the attribution\nfactors. Conversely, in this case, the apportionment\nmethod used may lead to overestimation because pre-\nscription opioid abuse may not be associated with the\nsame likelihood of arrest as abuse of other drugs. Addi-\ntionally, presenteeism costs were estimated using a ratio\nof average presenteeism costs relative to overall medi-\ncal, drug, absenteeism, and disability costs reported\nin Goetzel et al. for the 10 most common conditions\nBirnbaum et al.\nexamined (e.g., allergies, cancer, depression/mental\nillness) [31]. Because opioid abuse specific estimates\nwere not available, it was assumed that presenteeism\ncosts for employees with opioid abuse followed the\nsame ratio.\nAs noted above, there are various issues in defining opioid\nabuse. For example, ICD-9-CM codes do not allow for\ndifferentiation between prescription opioid abuse and\nheroin abuse, and therefore, this study likely included both\ntypes of patients. Where possible, heroin abuse was\nseparated from prescription opioid abuse in cost analyses\nusing secondary data sources. This study estimates costs\nusing two general definitions of abuse. First, per-patient\nexcess medical and drug costs were calculated using a\ndiagnosis-based definition. This approach captured\npatients with abuse, dependence, and misuse (e.g., poi-\nsoning). Opioid abuse may be underdiagnosed due, in\npart, to the associated stigma [38], and therefore the\npatient population used to calculate excess costs may not\nbe representative of the cost profile of undiagnosed\npatients with opioid abuse. Second, the number of opioid\nabuse patients used to carry out the quantity and appor-\ntionment methods was limited to those reported by\nNSDUH as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for abuse or\ndependence (1.7 million), similar to an ICD-9-CM diagnos-\ntic approach to abuse. The absence of cost information\nfor the approximately 12.5 million nonmedical users of\nprescription drugs [1] and their caregivers in the United\nStates means that this study likely understates both the\nexcess health care and total societal costs. It is also\nimportant to mention that this study does not attempt to\naddress causality. While the societal costs refer to those\ncosts associated with opioids abusers, they may not be\ndirectly attributable to the opioid abuse. For example,\nhealth care costs include costs of comorbidities that are\nunrelated to opioid abuse per se. While point estimates of\nthe various measures of societal cost have not been pre-\nsented here, the authors believe the estimates understate\nthe true economic burden of prescription opioid abuse,\ndependence and misuse, and thus these estimates are\nconservative.\nTo better understand how various assumptions impacted\nthe total societal cost estimate, sensitivity analyses were\nconducted. The primary driver of societal costs was the\nnumber of opioid abusers, which is used to multiply costs\nper patient in all cost components that use the quantity\nmethod. Changing the number of opioid abusers by\n25% impacts the total societal cost estimate by $10\nbillion ($45.7\u00ad65.7 billion). This finding suggests that the\nincreasing prevalence of opioid abuse may be driving\nincreases in societal costs. Another key assumption is the\ndiscount rate used in the calculation of the costs of pre-\nmature death. For example, if the discount rate were\ndecreased to 3%, the societal cost estimate would\nmarket conditions may suggest that a lower rate could be\nmore appropriate, 6% is consistent with past research [11]\nand results in a more conservative cost estimate. A sys-\ntematic analysis that varied other major assumptions for\neach cost component by 25% (all else equal) found that\nno other individual assumption resulted in a change of\nmore than $2 billion in the overall societal cost estimate.\nFuture research should attempt to assess other compo-\nnents of societal costs that are directly linked to or caused\nby prescription opioid abuse not considered here (e.g.,\nautomobile accidents, insurance fraud, workers compen-\nsation) as well as improve understanding of the relation-\nship between opioid abuse and associated comorbidities\n(e.g., by studying whether mental illness predates a diag-\nnosis of opioid abuse or vice versa). It would also be\ninformative to analyze the costs of undertreating pain,\nwhich can result from practitioners' concerns about\naddiction and abuse [39].\nFurther efforts to separately categorize prescription and\nnonprescription opioid abuse would allow researchers to\nbetter understand illicit opioid use as well as identify pos-\nsible sources of distribution. Lastly, it would be useful to\nimprove the ability to identify patients at risk of opioid\nabuse using data similar to that available to PDMPs and\nthird-party payers, similar to the prototype approach\ndeveloped by White et al. but using national data [37].\nSuch an approach could aid in the development of\nnational initiatives and research studies toward the pre-\nvention of opioid abuse.\nAs this study has shown, prescription opioid abuse con-\ncerns far more than those individuals directly affected by\nthe condition. It is associated with a myriad of societal\nproblems related to productivity losses and increasing\ncriminal and legal justice costs that are rapidly becoming a\nmajor public health and economic concern. A multifac-\neted, coordinated response involving physicians, health\ncare professionals, researchers (including the pharmaceu-\ntical industry), and the government is likely required to\nmake substantial progress on this serious issue.\nRole of Funding Source\nFunding for this study was provided by King Pharmaceu-\nticals, Inc.\nContributors\nHoward Birnbaum, Alan White, and Carl Roland designed\nand wrote the protocol.
