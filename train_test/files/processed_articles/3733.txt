There are not enough special educators each year to\nfill the vacancies in the field. The attrition rate of special\neducators, especially in the early years of their careers, is\nconsidered a major reason for the teacher shortage\nleave their jobs each year (Plash & Piotrowski, 2006).\nTeacher attrition in special education has led to many jobs\nleft vacant, later filled by uncertified teachers. Provost (2009)\nstates, \"Nine of the 13 educational fields identified by the\nAmerican Association for Employment in Education (2008)\nas areas of considerable shortage are in special education\"\n(p. 105). The high turnover rate has a negative effect on stu-\ndents as well as the district as a whole. Billingsley (2004a)\nposited that future research efforts should focus on how to\nretain teachers.\nThe factors that contribute to the teacher shortage in spe-\ncial education are wide reaching, ranging from preparation\nprograms to the support a teacher receives their first few\nyears as an educator. Researchers of this topic have focused\non a variety of factors that influence a special educator's\ndecision to remain in, or leave, the field of special education\n(Griffin et al., 2009). In her first critical review of the litera-\nture, Billingsley (1993) divided these factors into three cate-\ngories: external, employment, and personal.\nMany of the studies produced conflicting results on\nwhether certain variables promoted attrition or retention. For\nuncertified special educators left at a greater rate than fully\ncertified special educators; whereas McKnab (1983; as cited\nin Billingsley, 1993) reported the inverse to be true.\nBillingsley (1993) attributed this phenomenon to \"the varied\ndefinitions of attrition used, and failure to statistically con-\ntrol for relevant demographic factors\" (p. 150). Subsequent\nstudies have produced results consistent with Metzke (1988)\nwho suggested uncertified special educators leave the field\nmore frequently than fully certified special educators.\nThe research became more focused on specific variables\nBillingsley's second review of the literature. Billingsley\n(2004b) examined research of demographic factors on attri-\ntion. She determined that gender and race do not have a cor-\nrelation with attrition, but age does. Younger special\neducators leave the field more frequently than veteran spe-\ncial educators (Boe, Bobbitt, Cook, Whitener, & Weber,\nGiven the gap between the number of special education\nteachers available and the number of jobs to be filled increases\neach year, a critical examination of the literature is imperative\nin determining factors relating to both attrition and retention\n(Boe & Cook, 2006).

In addition,\nimplications for future research will be presented. The ques-\ntion this research will attempt to answer is as follows: What\nvariables lead to special educator attrition and retention?\nMethod\nThe articles referenced in this literature review were found\nby searching ERIC on the online database EbscoHost. The\nsearch parameters were special education teacher attrition,\nretention, mobility, and turnover. The terms were searched\nseparately, as well as in combinations with the root term\n\"special education.\" The initial search of the term \"special\neducation teacher attrition\" returned 228 results. After refin-\ning the search to only include peer-reviewed journals from\npages for each article from the initial search were examined\nto find more articles. For this literature review, journals from\nto present were used. The articles prior to 2004 were reviewed\nResults\nDefinition of Attrition and Retention\nSpecial educator attrition and retention are defined using a\nvariety of terms. This document will use the terms outlined\nin Billingsley's (1993) review of the literature. If a special\neducator remains in the same position as the previous year, it\nis called absolute retention (Boe, 1990). If a special educator\nstays in the field, but takes another position, it is labeled\n\"transfers to another special education teaching position.\"\nWhen special educators transfer to general education posi-\ntions, it is called \"transfers to general education teaching\"\n(Billingsley, 1993). The final group, \"exit attrition,\" is for\nspecial educators who leave the field of education. Although\neach group causes problems for the field of special educa-\ntion, exit attrition is the most serious outcome because it\nreduces the overall teacher workforce (Boe et al., 1997).\nDemographics of Attrition\nMany variables and characteristics have been studied to\ndetermine their correlation with special education teacher\nattrition. Among the studied characteristics are age, gender,\nexperience, and level of education. Olivarez and Arnold\nthe average special education teacher who remained in the\nfield is Caucasian, has earned a bachelor's degree, and is at\nleast 30 years old. However, the researchers admit other char-\nacteristics must be cross-referenced to have predictive value\nrelating to teacher retention. In her review of the literature,\nBillingsley (2004b) states, \"Age is the only demographic\nvariable that is consistently linked to attrition in the special\neducation literature\" (p. 43). Younger special educators leave\nthe field at a higher rate when compared with veteran special\neducators. This can be attributed to the normal occurrences of\nteacher attrition during the first few years of a teacher's\ncareer, combined with the inability to properly manage the\nstressors of special education (Nance & Calabrese, 2009;\nSchlichte, Yssel, & Merbler, 2005). However, Connelly and\nGraham (2009) posit a more significant student teaching\nexperience may decrease an early career special educator's\nintent to leave the field. The research regarding the correla-\ntion between gender and special educator attrition has been\ninconclusive (Billingsley, 2004b). Although age and years of\nteaching experience are correlated with attrition, the scope of\ncurrent research is trending toward external variables such as\njob satisfaction, administrative support, induction programs,\nand mentoring programs.\nJob Satisfaction\nThe level of job satisfaction a teacher experiences can affect\nwhether a teacher stays in special education, or moves to a\ngeneral education position, or leaves the field of education\nall together (Gehrke & McCoy, 2007). Many factors directly\ncontribute to job satisfaction (e.g., administrative support,\nstress, and workload). In a study conducted by Stempien and\nLoeb (2002), special educators rated themselves lower in\noverall job satisfaction than their general education counter-\nparts. According to a case study by Billingsley (2007), teach-\ners who left the field cited lack of support from parents and\nadministrators, too much paperwork, limited availability of\nresources, and large class size as the main items that caused\ndissatisfaction. In a survey of 57 special educators who\nstayed in the field, Fish and Stephens (2010) found that a\nteacher's ability to serve his or her students leads to high job\nsatisfaction, which increases the likelihood the teacher will\nstay in the field.\nFirst-year special educators encounter a variety of stress-\nors. A workload that contains students with a variety of dif-\nferent needs, not enough planning time, paperwork, and\ncurrent policy are several of the factors that provide stress,\nand in turn lower job satisfaction (Plash & Piotrowski, 2006).\nTherefore, stress becomes a major factor in job satisfaction\nSpecial educators are often required to complete work\noutside of what is asked of general education teachers, with-\nout additional compensation (Thornton, Peltier, & Medina,\n2007). This added responsibility is viewed as a hindrance on\nthe teacher's ability to properly teach their class (Kaff, 2004;\nexamine the results of 341 questionnaires, deducing that\ninstructional delivery is no longer the main role of special\neducation teachers. However, special educators choose the\nfield, and stay in it to teach and provide services for their\nstudents (Kaff, 2004). When they are stripped of this role, it\nleads to lower job satisfaction, and ultimately leaving the\nfield. Consequently, Wasburn-Moses (2009) surveyed in-\nservice and pre-service special education teachers to deter-\nmine the role expectations of each. The authors concluded\npre-service teachers had an accurate expectation of the prob-\nlems that they may encounter in their first year. However, the\npre-service teachers viewed their future role as one that is in\nline with current policy, whereas practicing teachers\ndescribed far different roles. Special educators' roles can\nrange from those of a classroom teacher to an educational\nconsultant. Special educators also fill a plethora of roles out\nof necessity including the management of problem behaviors\nand the administering of social and vocational skills\n(Conderman & Katsiyannis, 2002). This confusion of roles\ncan lead to early stress and burnout because a teacher enter-\ning the field expects a certain role, but may be presented with\nsomething vastly different (Thornton et al., 2007; Wasburn-\nMoses, 2009). This additional stress can cause special educa-\ntors to leave the field. This role confusion can be alleviated\nby proper support from the building administrator.\nAdministrative Support\nAccording to the research, the lack of support from adminis-\ntrators contributes to special education teachers leaving their\nvey by White and Mason (2006) showed teachers and admin-\nistrators agreed on the importance of administrator support.\nFurthermore, administrative support is imperative to guide\nearly career special educators through the complex policies in\nspecial education. In a qualitative study, Nance and Calabrese\n(2009) found that special education teachers felt a disconnect\nwith their district administrators, which made it difficult to\nacquire the necessary support for their classrooms.\nResearch indicates a lack of administrative support is a\ncause of teacher attrition in special education (Nance &\nture that demonstrates the role administrative support plays\nwith the retention of teachers (Otto & Arnold, 2005; Santoli,\nSachs, Romey, & McClurg, 2008). On reviewing the litera-\nture, Leko and Smith (2010) proposed these suggestions for\nadministrators to retain special education teachers: \"(a)\nthinking carefully about school climate, (b) investing in\ninduction, (c) assigning mentors, (d) providing professional\ndevelopment, and (e) assigned reasonable roles and respon-\nsibilities.\" Administrators can construct an induction pro-\ngram to cover the many supports needed by first-year special\neducators. The induction program can provide support and\nguidance allowing the special educator to perform their job\nwhile alleviating stress (Leko & Smith, 2010).\nInduction Program\nThe implementation of a comprehensive induction program\ntailored specifically to the needs of first-year special\neducation teachers can have a positive effect on their ability\nto perform their job and manage their stress level, and inten-\ntion to stay in special education. T. M. Smith and Ingersoll\n(2004) found the number of teacher induction programs is\nconstantly growing. Current research suggests an induction\nprogram containing the necessary elements can help retain\nspecial education teachers (Billingsley, 2004a; Wasburn-\nMoses, 2006). These studies indicate a quality induction pro-\ngram includes assistance with Individualized Education\nProgram (IEP) writing, proper mentoring, and appropriate\nprofessional development. Wasburn-Moses (2006) outlined\nan induction program that contained assistance for young\nteachers in writing IEPs, mentoring from a general and spe-\ncial education teachers, and professional development based\non problems early career teachers encounter. Also, induction\nprograms bridge the gap between preparation programs and\nthe first year of teaching (Leko & Smith, 2010). Billingsley\n(2004a) stated, \"One of the most important actions that\nschools can take is to provide support to beginning teachers\nduring these vulnerable first years\" (p. 371). A comprehen-\nsive induction program can eliminate some of the stress and\nnegative feelings that often come with being a first-year spe-\ncial education teacher (Leko & Smith, 2010).\nComprehensive induction programs provide a new teacher\nwith guidance that allows them to grow professionally and\npersonally. Kamman and Long (2010) examined a 3-year\ninduction program at a school district in St. Louis; the rate of\nspecial education teacher retention trended upward during\nthe period studied. This induction program utilized special\neducation-specific strategies to induct and support the begin-\nning teachers. The requirements for an induction program\nare different from state to state. Some states, such as West\nVirginia, have guidelines that require an induction program\nfor all beginning teachers, whereas other states do not. Bay\nand Parker-Katz (2009) reported all states at least recom-\nmend support for early year teachers, but there is not a for-\nmat followed by each state or district.\nAn induction program can help a special educator through\nthe first few years of teaching, when statistically she or he is\nmore likely to leave the field. An induction program for spe-\ncial education teachers must be separate from the overall\ninduction program because of the distinctive problems spe-\ncial education teachers face early in their careers (Thornton\net al., 2007). A major component of a successful induction\nprogram is a mentoring program. The success of a mentoring\nprogram is predicated on a mentor that provides quality\nadvice to the young teacher as well as provides them with\nsomeone to open up to (Schlichte et al., 2005).\nMentoring Programs\nMentoring is often used as a synonym for induction.\nHowever, mentoring is a component of an induction pro-\ngram. Mentoring can take place in a formal or informal set-\nting. Formal mentoring is defined as a predesigned program\n4 SAGE Open\nwith an assigned mentor. Informal mentoring can take place\nwhen talking with, or observing another teacher or adminis-\ntrator. Billingsley, Carlson, and Klein (2004) found that first-\nyear teachers preferred and benefited most from informal\nmentoring. Informal mentoring may provide a first-year edu-\ncator with more problem-specific advice, rather than a prede-\ntermined formal mentoring program (Billingsley et al.,\nqualitative study of first-year special educators in Midwestern\nstates in which the findings suggested a reoccurring theme of\nthe benefit of relationships with colleagues. Alternatively,\nWhite and Mason (2006) argue first-year teachers find a\nbasic, structured, and formal mentoring program beneficial.\nMentoring can be delivered in many forms; however, the lit-\nerature finds that for first-year educators to be effective, they\nmust have someone who can address specific problems and\nprovide them with sound advice (Dempsey, Arthur-Kelly, &\nCarty, 2009). Often, this someone is their mentor.\nThere is research that supports the benefits of informal\nand formal mentoring programs. Although the findings dif-\nfer, research supports the benefits of having a mentoring pro-\ngram and the positive effect it can have on teacher retention.\nIn addition, there is literature that indicates the mentoring\nshould continue beyond the first year. Research findings\nindicate that special educators run the greatest risk of leaving\nin their first 5 years (Gehrke & Murri, 2006; Katsiyannis et\nal., 2003). Additional years of mentoring would provide the\nmentee with guidance beyond their first year and train them\nto someday be a mentor. Providing novice teachers with the\nproper mentoring will enhance their job satisfaction and their\nability to perform their job, as well as improve the likelihood\nthey will stay in their jobs (Brownell, Hirsch, & Seo, 2004;\nSpecial educators find themselves serving multiple roles\nin their first years of teaching. Because of the variance in\ntheir responsibilities, it is beneficial to provide them with a\nmentor from the special education department, as well as a\nmentor from the general education department (Wasburn-\nMoses, 2006). The benefit of having a special education and\ngeneral education mentor is the wide range of experiences\neach can draw on to provide the first-year teacher with spe-\ncific advice.\nAn emerging trend in mentoring is the value of electronic\nmentoring, or e-mentoring. S. J. Smith and Israel (2010)\ndefine e-mentoring as \"the use of computer-mediated com-\nmunications such as e-mail, discussion boards, chat rooms,\nblogs, Web conferencing, and growing Internet-based solu-\ntions that are changing the way mentors and mentees inter-\nact\" (p. 30). Some issues require immediate attention, but\nothers can wait until the mentor has a chance to respond. In\nface-to-face mentoring, the mentor and mentee may only\nmeet at a certain time each week, restricting when the mentee\ncan ask questions. One of the issues with face-to-face\nmentoring is the availability of mentors onsite. However,\ne-mentoring allows the mentor to communicate with the\nmentee from another location and provides a venue for ask-\ning questions at any time (Dempsey et al., 2009). Mentoring\nfrom a distant location also provides the opportunity to men-\ntor more than one teacher at a time. In a study to determine\nhow effective mentoring is in relieving stress, White and\nMason (2006) conclude the location of the mentor does not\naffect the benefits of the mentoring experience.\nTo address the important question of qualifications for\nserving in a mentor role, Sindelar, Heretick, Hirsch, Rorrer,\nand Dawson (2010) studied the state requirements for becom-\ning a mentor. The most rigorous state was found to be\nLouisiana, which requires a minimum of 10 years as a full-\ntime teacher, a master's degree, and at least one 3-hr course\nin mentoring. Research insists there are vast differences\nbetween the problems early career special educators and gen-\neral educators face (Boe, Cook, & Sunderland, 2008;\nStempien & Loeb, 2002); however, there are no states that\ndistinguish between the two when assigning mentors\ndeduced a school district must be aware of the policy regard-\ning mentoring programs and be familiar with the current\nresearch when designing their program.\nTo properly review the literature on this topic, special\neducator attrition and retention must be defined. Billingsley\n(1993) provided a definition for each possible outcome when\nexamining special educators and their career choices. A\nplethora of characteristics have been studied to determine the\ncorrelation with attrition and retention. Of the demographic\nvariables, age was found to be the only one with a correlation\nto attrition (Billingsley, 2004b). Although demographics,\naside from age, are not good predictors of attrition, job satis-\nfaction, however, has a positive correlation with retention\n(Fish & Stephens, 2010). A major factor in a special educa-\ntor's job satisfaction is administrative support they receive\nAdministrators can provide support by ensuring proper\ninduction, and mentoring programs are in place for begin-\nning special educators. Providing these supports for begin-\nning special educators can improve a beginning teacher's job\nsatisfaction, and in turn, their probability of remaining in the\nfield.\nDiscussion\nThe themes outlined in this review represent the trend of\nfocusing on retention to reduce the special education teacher\nshortage. Teacher attrition was previously covered in the lit-\nerature. The reasons teachers leave special education jobs\n(e.g., poor job satisfaction, stress, overworked, lack of sup-\nport from administration) are represented in the current lit-\nerature and continue to support findings of previous studies.\nThe induction programs in the reviewed articles were\nintense programs that were implemented to retain special\neducation teachers. Schools may use an induction program\nthat all teachers go through on entering the district, but it will\nnot be effective unless the intricacies of a first-year special\neducation teacher are considered when designing the pro-\ngram. These findings imply that schools are not properly\nassimilating their new special education teachers into their\ndistricts. Also, they are not receiving the appropriate mentor-\ning or support from their administrators.\nFuture research in this area should focus on the four areas\nthat researchers have found to help teacher retention: job sat-\nisfaction, induction programs, mentoring, and administrative\nsupport. Each area has been researched, but it is not exhaus-\ntive. There are obvious characteristics that can be scrutinized\nwithin each category.\nThere is a wealth of research on certain aspects of job\nsatisfaction such as stress levels and workloads, but a dearth\nof research on characteristics such as salaries and supple-\nmental compensation. Researchers should examine whether\nor not a cross comparison of salaries in school districts\naffects attrition levels. Also, because of the added responsi-\nbilities that cause stress, the relationship of added compensa-\ntion such as extra professional days and stipends on teacher\nretention should be researched.\nResearchers could investigate different factors of induc-\ntion programs and their effect on teacher retention. Past\nresearch can be taken into account when designing and\nstudying new induction programs. Once there is conclusive\nresearch conducted on induction programs, administrators\ncan use the literature to formulate their own program. This\ncycle of examining the research, choosing the sections that\nwere successful, implementing the program, and studying its\neffectiveness could help shape induction programs across the\ncountry. This could help form future induction programs that\nwill become more readily used in schools aiming to retain\nspecial education teachers.\nFurthermore, mentoring should also be studied based on\nthe characteristics of the person who is providing the mentor-\ning and whether this mentoring occurs formally or infor-\nmally. Researchers could also examine the amount of\nmentoring received and how that correlates with teachers\nremaining in their jobs or leaving. There is a paucity of\nresearch regarding the school counselor providing mentor-\ning; this strategy should be studied further. Many school\ncounselors talk to staff members about their stress levels, and\nhow to deal with the multitude of stressors. Counselors could\nbe surveyed to determine whether they are aware of the addi-\ntional stressors first-year special educators face.\nThe area that should receive the most attention in future\nresearch is administrative support. There is a lack of research\nproviding specific strategies to help administrators offer\nmore support for first-year special educators. The amount of\nspecial education training an administrator has, and how that\naffects the level of support they provide their teachers, is a\nstudy that would provide insights into a potential strategy.\nAlso, future research should focus on the specific definition\nof support as perceived by administrators and special educa-\ntion teachers. This could show a gap in how each group per-\nceives it and provide a starting point to close the gap.\nResearchers exploring this topic should consider the sug-\ngestions above. The themes mentioned can be studied indi-\nvidually or in conjunction with other suggestions. Each of\nthe themes is interrelated. Administrative support could be\nstudied with each of the other themes because the adminis-\ntrator would directly design the induction program, assign\nthe mentor, and have an overall effect on job satisfaction.\nFuture consideration should be given to provide special\neducation teachers with more support and opportunities to\ngrow as an educator. The research in this area shows the\nimpact proper support can have on the retention of teachers\nin special education. As the shortage continues to grow,\nschool districts and educational agencies must begin to focus\nmore of their attention on the recruitment and retention of\nspecial education teachers. This begins by identifying teach-\ners who are more likely to stay in the field and providing\nthem with the proper support and opportunities for growth.\nThe districts and agencies should take heed of the current\nresearch calling for more overall support and guidance for\nnew special educators. When more support is provided for\nthese teachers, the amount of special educators remaining in\nthe field will begin to increase, and the gap between the\namount of special educators and the number of openings in\nthe field will begin to decline.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Association for Employment in Education.
