We assessed whether obesity is a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to 2009 pandemic influenza\nA(H1N1), independent of chronic medical conditions considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) to increase the risk of influenza-related complications.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We used a case-cohort design to compare cases of hospitalizations and deaths from 2009\npandemic A(H1N1) influenza occurring between April\u00adJuly, 2009, with a cohort of the U.S. population estimated from the\n2003\u00ad2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); pregnant women and children ,2 years old were\nexcluded. For hospitalizations, we defined categories of relative weight by body mass index (BMI, kg/m2); for deaths, obesity\nor morbid obesity was recorded on medical charts, and death certificates. Odds ratio (OR) of being in each BMI category was\ndetermined; normal weight was the reference category. Overall, 361 hospitalizations and 233 deaths included information\nto determine BMI category and presence of ACIP-recognized medical conditions. Among $20 year olds, hospitalization was\nassociated with being morbidly obese (BMI$40) for individuals with ACIP-recognized chronic conditions (OR = 4.9, 95% CI\nwas associated with being underweight (BMI#5th percentile) among those with (OR = 12.5, 95%CI 3.4\u00ad45.5) and without\n(OR = 5.5, 95%CI 1.3\u00ad22.5) ACIP-recognized chronic conditions. Death was not associated with BMI category among\nindividuals 2\u00ad19 years old. Among individuals aged $20 years without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions death\nConclusions/Significance: Our findings support observations that morbid obesity may be associated with hospitalization\nand possibly death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection. These complications could be prevented by early antiviral\ntherapy and vaccination.\nCitation: Morgan OW, Bramley A, Fowlkes A, Freedman DS, Taylor TH, et al.

[1,2] Early\nreports suggest that persons with chronic medical conditions\npreviously recognized as increasing the risk for complications due\nto seasonal influenza also have a higher risk of complications due\nquently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) included individuals with these recognized chronic medical\nconditions in their priority groups for receipt of the new 2009\npandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine. [5]\nPreliminary data from the United States and abroad suggest\nthat obesity (body mass index, BMI$30 kg/m2) and morbid\nobesity (BMI$40 kg/m2) is disproportionately represented among\nhospitalizations, intensive care admissions, and deaths from 2009\npandemic influenza A(H1N1). [6,7,8,9] We explored the hypoth-\nesis that BMI is a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to\npandemic influenza A(H1N1), independent of ACIP-recognized\nchronic medical conditions.\nMethods\nWe used three datasets: patients hospitalized with 2009 pandemic\nA(H1N1), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES), a representative survey of the general U.S.\npopulation. For each dataset we defined individuals according to\nBMI category (see below), presence of ACIP-recognized chronic\nmedical conditions (defined for this analysis as cardiovascular\ndisease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, and diabetes) and\nage group. We did not include neurologic, neuromuscular,\nhematological, non-diabetes metabolic disorders or immunosup-\npression as ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions in this\nanalysis due to lack of this information from NHANES. We used\nold age group into additional age categories resulted in unreliable\nvariance estimates when we stratified by BMI category and presence\nof ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions due to zero\nobservations in primary sampling units of the NHANES survey.\nFor hospitalized patients and NHANES participants we used\nBMI [height (m)/weight (kg)2] as an index of relative weight. For\nindividuals aged 2\u00ad19 years, we calculated age- and sex-specific\nBMI z-scores and used CDC 2000 growth charts to define BMI\ncategory, where underweight was ,5th percentile, normal weight\nheight and weight, so we used mention of obesity or morbid\nobesity within the medical condition section of the reporting form.\nFor all three datasets we excluded individuals ,2 years old and\npregnant women because obesity definitions are not applicable to\nthem.\nhospitalized with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in the United\nconvenience sample of all hospitalizations reported to CDC from\n24 states as part of prospective surveillance project, as described\npreviously, [15] for which state health departments abstracted\ninformation from medical charts using a standard case form. We\nwere provided with additional reports of hospitalizations from\nNew York City, Wisconsin, and Texas, that were not included in\nthe surveillance project, but had been collected by health\ndepartments using the same or similar abstraction forms during\nthe same time period. If height and weight were not reported in\ndata collected for the prospective study, we attempted to contact\npatients for this information. For a minority of patients for whom\nwe had weight but not height data, we estimated their obesity\ncategory by assuming that their height was not less than the 5th\npercentile or greater than the 95th percentile of the population (see\nSupplement S1). We included information on deaths reported to\ncollected information from medical charts, medical examiner\nreports, and death certificates, using a standard data collection\nform. All hospitalizations and deaths included in our analyses were\nconfirmed to have pandemic H1N1 infection by real-time reverse\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). [16] We\nestimated the proportion of the U.S. population in different BMI\nmethodology has been described previously. [17]\nFor each dataset, we calculated the proportion of individuals in\neach BMI category by age group (2\u00ad19 years and $20 years). We\nstratified our analysis by presence or absence of an ACIP-\nrecognized chronic medical condition, which is likely to confound\nthe relationship between BMI category and hospitalization or\nthe ratio of odds (odds ratio, OR) of being in each BMI category,\nwhere the normal weight category was the reference category, for\nhospitalizations and deaths (cases) compared to the U.S.\npopulation (cohort). Because we compared cases to the cohort of\nthe U.S. population selected before the time period during which\ncases could occur (i.e., a case-cohort design), the OR estimates the\nrisk ratio of hospitalization or death by BMI category. [18] To\nestimate 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and p-values of the\nodds ratios we used the Taylor series linearization method to\ncombine the variance estimate of the log-odds of exposure among\ncases (hospitalizations or deaths) with a variance of the log-odds of\nexposure among the population as estimated using NHANES.\n[19,20] For hospitalized patients, we conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis to consider how robust our analysis was with regard to\nadjustment of age among $20 year olds, by creating a logistic\nregression model for each BMI category with Normal weight as\nthe reference category, where hospitalization was the dependent\nyears) was the independent variable (see Supplement S1). We\nconducted a further sensitivity analysis of our treatment of missing\nBMI data (see Supplement S1). We also repeated the analysis for\nhospitalized patients after changing the comparison group to a\ncohort of the U.S. population that had been admitted to hospital\nfor any reason in a 12 month period, as estimated by NHANES.\nThe rationale for this additional analysis was to assess whether any\nobserved association between BMI category and hospitalization\nwas due to more frequent hospitalization among obese and\nmorbidly obese individuals. We used SAS 9.2 for all analyses.\ninfections was deemed public health surveillance, not human\nsubjects research and therefore did not require Institutional\nReview Board review.\nResults\nexcluded 51 patients who were pregnant and 77 who were ,2\nmeasured height and weight which we used to calculate BMI. In\naddition, we estimated BMI category for 78 (19%) patients who\nhad data on measured weight but not measured height; 52 (27%,\nestimated to be underweight and 23% were estimated to be obese;\nestimated to be obese or morbidly obese.

In comparison, among\nhospitalized patients 2\u00ad19 years old, 25.5% were obese, of whom\n53.7% had ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions. Among\nACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions. In the US population\nprevalence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions increased\nonly slightly with increasing BMI category: 40.9% of obese and\n51.2% of morbidly obese persons had ACIP-recognized chronic\nmedical conditions. Among hospitalized patients with 2009 pandemic\nobese patients had ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions,\nrecognized chronic medical conditions. Among deaths in $20 year\nrecognized chronic medical conditions were reported for 63.6% of\ndeaths among obese and 56.0% of morbidly obese individuals.\nAmong patients 2\u00ad19 years, there was no statistically significant\nassociation between being overweight or obese and hospitalization\namong those who did or did not have ACIP-recognized chronic\nmedical conditions (Table 2). However, being underweight was\nassociated with hospitalization among patients 2\u00ad19 years old with\nand without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions (OR=12.5,\nrespectively) (Table 2). There was no association between BMI\ncategory and death among persons 2\u00ad19 years old (Table 2).\nAmong hospitalized patients aged $20 years with and without\nACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions, morbid obesity was\nthe only BMI category statistically associated with hospitalization\nadjustment for age (Supplement S1 Table S3), when we excluded\npatients with measured weight but no measured height (Supple-\nment S1 Table S1) and when we assumed that all persons with\nmissing height and weight were in the normal weight category\n(Supplement S1 Table S2). However, the association between\nmorbid obesity and hospitalization among individuals who did not\nhave an ACIP-recognized chronic medical condition was not\nstatistically significant in the final sensitivity analysis (Supplement\nBMI category was not associated with death among adults who\nhad an ACIP-recognized chronic medical condition.

These findings are consistent with\nreports from surveillance data of a high prevalence of morbid\nassociated with being underweight, irrespective of presence of\nACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions evaluated in this\nanalysis. Additionally, we found that deaths among $20 year olds\nwithout ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions were more\nlikely to be obese or morbidly obese individuals.\nTable 1.

In our study, the elevated\nrisk for hospitalization due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection\npersisted even when we restricted our analysis to the U.S.\npopulation that reported at least one hospitalization in the\nprevious year, suggesting that the observed associations were not\nbecause morbidly obese persons routinely experience higher\nhospitalization rates. Several studies indicate that morbid obesity\nmay plausibly be an independent risk factor for complications due\nto 2009 pandemic H1N1 disease: morbid obesity is associated with\ncomplications in the intensive care unit, including prolonged stay,\nprolonged ventilation, and death [22,23] and women with\nBMI$30 have a higher likelihood of developing community\nacquired pneumonia. [24] The risk for hospitalization among\npersons $20 years of age with morbid obesity was similar\nregardless of the presence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical\nconditions, suggesting that the effect of morbid obesity is\nindependent of the presence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical\nconditions.\nWe expected to see similar associations between deaths and\nBMI categories that we saw for hospitalizations. That we did not\nsee the same association, especially for obesity and for persons with\nACIP-recognized risk factors, may reflect (1) misclassification of\nBMI categories among deaths which did not have measured BMI\nor (2) incomplete reporting of ACIP-recognized chronic medical\nconditions. Due to the possible misclassification of both BMI and\nunderlying conditions among fatalities these results should be\ninterpreted with caution. Additional studies are necessary to better\ndefine the risk of BMI category and underlying conditions, and\nChildren aged 2\u00ad19 years who were obese had an elevated,\nbut not statistically significant, risk of hospitalization due to\n2009 pandemic H1N1 infection and no increased risk of death.\nHowever, the number of pediatric deaths and hospitalizations\nwere small and confidence intervals were wide. In addition,\nchildren aged 2\u00ad19 years who were underweight had an\nelevated significant risk of hospitalization due to 2009 pandemic\nH1N1 infection. Among the hospitalized children in the\nunderweight BMI category, 20% (n = 3/15) had neuromuscu-\nlar/neurodevelopment disorders and 13% (n = 2/15) had\nimmunosuppressive conditions. For this analysis, none of these\nconditions were included as an ACIP-recognized risk group due\nto lack of similar data from NHANES. Therefore, inclusion of\nthese children in our analysis may in part be responsible for the\nobservation of an increased risk of hospitalization among\nunderweight children. The collection of additional data over\ntime may give further insight into the risk of BMI category and\nhospitalization or death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection\namong children.\nThis analysis of data collected during the first wave of the\nexploratory and findings should be considered preliminary until\nresults from larger and more comprehensive studies are\navailable. There are a number of potential limitations of our\nanalysis. Even though our data about hospitalized patients and\ndeaths were convenience samples, they were collected before\nthe first reports were published suggesting that obesity may be\nassociated with severe pandemic H1N1 disease. [4] We used\nU.S. population, which has remained constant over the last few\nyears and so is likely to reflect the prevalence of obesity in 2009\n[25]. Moreover, the high response rates for NHANES (the\nproportion of sampled individuals who were interviewed and\n2005\u00ad6) indicate that obesity-dependent selection bias is\nunlikely. An advantage of NHANES is that the height and\nweight of respondents is measured. Medical conditions were\nself-reported and could have been under- or over-reported. It is\nhard to determine the extent to which this could have\nintroduced systematic bias. Moreover, NHANES does not\ncollect information about immunosuppression and neurologic/\nneuromuscular and hematological conditions. [5] To reduce the\npossibility of bias in our comparison, we did not include these\nconditions in our definition of ACIP-recognized chronic\nmedical conditions for hospitalized patients or deaths. This is\nlikely to have resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence\nof chronic medical conditions in all of the data sources included\nin our analysis. While height and weight were incompletely\nrecorded for hospitalized patients, our results were robust to\nvarious assumptions about these missing data and we conclude\nthat the observed associations with morbid obesity were unlikely\nto be due to missing data bias. However, we had no height or\nweight data for deaths, and our results of the association\nbetween BMI category and death should be interpreted with\ncaution. Finally, some of the observed effect may be due to\nresidual confounding by race/ethnicity, which we could not\nadjust for due to incomplete data for both hospitalizations and\ndeaths. The impact of this potential bias cannot be determined\nfrom our data. Differences in obesity prevalence have been\nobserved only between non-Hispanic black and Mexican-\nAmerican women but not between other racial/ethnic groups\nOur findings suggest that in the United States persons who are\nmorbidly obese, even if they do not have chronic medical\nconditions recognized by ACIP as increasing the risk of\ninfluenza-related complications, may be at increased risk for\nhospitalization and potentially also for death due to 2009\npandemic H1N1 infection. However, additional studies with a\nlarger sample of patients and appropriate comparison groups are\nneeded to confirm these findings. We found that at least half of\nAmericans who are morbidly obese reported other ACIP-\nrecognized medical conditions and it is possible that some persons\nwho are morbidly obese also have unrecognized chronic medical\nconditions. Clinicians should evaluate morbidly obese patients\nwith possible influenza illness for the presence of chronic medical\nconditions and if these conditions are present, or if persons with\nmorbid obesity show signs of lower respiratory tract infection or\nother signs of severe illness, these patients should receive empiric\nantiviral treatment as early as possible.
