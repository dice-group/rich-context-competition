The present study characterized the NRK-52E tubular epithelial cell line for the intracellular expression\nof renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components.\nMethods: RAS components were visualized by immunofluorescent staining in intact cells and protein expression in\nisolated nuclei.\nResults: An antibody to the angiotensin I (Ang I) sequence of AGT (AI-AGT) revealed only cytosolic staining, while\nan antibody to an internal sequence of AGT (Int-AGT) revealed primarily nuclear staining. Immunoblots of nuclear and\ncytosolic fractions confirmed the differential cell staining of AGT. Immunostaining for renin was present on nuclei of\nintact cells. Nuclear renin activity averaged 0.77\u00b10.05 nmol/mg protein/h that was reduced by aliskiren (0.13\u00b10.01 nmol/\nmg/h, n=3, p<0.01); trypsin activation increased activity three-fold. Peptide staining localized angiotensin II (Ang II) and\nAng-(1-7) to the nucleus and peptide content averaged 59\u00b12 and 57\u00b122 fmol/mg (n=4), respectively.

Dysregulation of\nthe RAS is also thought to contribute to the development\nand progression of cardiovascular and renal injuries.\nMoreover, the pharmacological agents that block various\ncomponents of the RAS now encompass the primary thera-\npies for treatment of hypertension, heart failure and dia-\nbetic renal injury. Although originally identified as a\nclassic endocrine system, the evidence clearly reveals a\nlocal or tissue RAS in various organs including the kidney,\nheart, adrenals and brain.1\u00ad3 In this regard, an intracellular\nsystem localized to cellular organelles including the\nnucleus and mitochondria have been described in both the\ntubular epithelial and mesangial cells of the kidney, as well\nas the myocytes and fibroblasts of the heart.4\u00ad11 The physi-\nological relevance and the regulation of this intracellular\nRAS have not been established. Indeed, it is not clear pre-\ncisely how the intracellular system functions at the cellular\nlevel to synthesize the active RAS peptides angiotensin II\n(Ang II) and Ang-(1-7), nor the contribution of these pep-\ntides to intracellular signaling and cell function. Moreover,\nthere is now compelling evidence for a functional renin\nreceptor that binds prorenin to non-proteolytically acti-\nvate the enzyme, as well as to mediate the functional sign-\naling of the receptor that is not dependent on Ang II\ngeneration.12\u00ad14 Interestingly, the prorenin receptor (PRR)\nis primarily localized intracellularly rather than on the cell\nmembrane suggesting that the receptor may also contrib-\nute to a functional intracellular RAS.15\nElucidation of the physiological relevance of an intra-\ncellular RAS is important clinically as well.

Previous studies in our laboratory\nand others have demonstrated a high density of Ang II\nreceptors on isolated nuclei from the kidney.16,17 In the rat\nkidney, the majority of these nuclear binding sites are the\nsubtype that is functionally linked to Ang\nII-dependent increases in oxidative stress and cal-\nreceptor-dependent formation of reactive\noxygen species (ROS) was also demonstrated in isolated\nnuclei from the sheep kidney; however, both AT2\nand\n) sites were functionally coupled to nitric\noxide formation and may antagonize the actions of the\nnuclear AT1\nreceptor.20\u00ad22 Additional studies revealed the\nprecursor components angiotensinogen (AGT) and renin\nin isolated nuclei from proximal tubules of the sheep kid-\nney that may portend for the intracellular or nuclear for-\nmation of Ang II and Ang-(1-7).21 Moreover, we detected\nthe peptidase activities for ACE and ACE2 in intact\nnuclei that processed exogenous Ang I to Ang II and Ang\nII to Ang-(1-7), respectively.20 To facilitate our under-\nstanding of the tubular RAS within the kidney, the cur-\nrent study sought to identify a renal cell line that expresses\nthe components of this system and to determine their\nintracellular localization.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nNormal kidney proximal epithelial cells (NRK-52E) cells\nwere obtained from American Tissue Type Culture\n(Arlington, Virginia, USA; passage 8) and maintained at\n37\u00b0C in plastic 75 cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium (DMEM/F12, Invitrogen) containing 5%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine and 15\nmM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid\n(HEPES) buffer. The culture flasks were kept in a 95% air\nhumidified environment at 37\u00b0C. At conflu-\nence, the cells were washed and maintained in serum free\nDMEM/F12 without supplements for 48 h prior to the bio-\nchemical studies.\nNuclear and cytosolic fractions\nConfluent cells were washed twice with Phosphate buff-\nered saline (PBS) and harvested. Harvested cells were cen-\nwas homogenized on ice with a glass pestle in 20 mM Tris\nbuffer containing 5mM MgCl2\nHomogenates were centrifuged at 1000 g to obtain the\ncrude nuclear pellet and further purified in a high sucrose\nbuffer. The crude pellet was reconstituted with 0.3 M\nsucrose in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4, layered over the\nat 4C to obtain the nuclear pellet.23 The cell supernatant\ncytosolic fraction.\nWestern blotting\nNuclear and cytosolic pellets (~50 g) were boiled in\nPBS (pH 7.4), diluted in Laemmli buffer with\n-mercaptoethanol, separated on 10% Sodium dodecyl\nsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels for 1 h at 120V in\nTris-glycine SDS and transferred to a polyvinylidene dif-\nluoride (PVDF) membrane. Blots were blocked with 5%\nBio-Rad Dry Milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and\nTris buffered saline (TBS) with Tween and probed over-\nnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against the follow-\ning: rat AGT (internal sequence of AGT (Int-AGT),\nHorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled polyclonal anti\nwith chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce Biotechnology,\nRockford, Illinois, USA). Membranes were probed with\nmouse monoclonal anti--actin (Sigma, St. Louis,\nMissouri, USA, 1:5000) antibody as a loading control\nand bands were quantified using MCID densitometry\nsoftware (InterFocus Imaging, Linton, UK).\nImmunofluorescent microscopy\nNRK-52E cells were grown in eight chamber slides for\ntwo days in DMEM/F12 5% FBS which was replaced with\nserum free media for one day. Cells were washed with PBS\nand fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Following\na PBS rinse, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton\nand then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n(Sigma A-8022). The fixed cells were probed with primary\nantibodies for AGT and renin previously described for\nwestern blot analysis. Cells were also probed with affinity\npurified antibodies to Ang II (Phoenix Pharmaceutical,\nBurlingame, California,USA) and Ang-(1-7) (custom anti-\nbody), PRR (Abcam ab64957, Cambridge, UK)) antibod-\nies. Antibodies were diluted in 3% normal donkey serum\ncalnexin (1:100). After overnight incubation with the pri-\nmary antibody at 4\u00b0C, cells were rinsed with PBS, incu-\nbated with fluorescent anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488\nsecondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,\nUSA), and the slides mounted with Molecular Probes\nProLong mounting media with 4',6-diamidino-2-phe-\nnylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) to stain the nuclei.\nPeptide assays\nCell nuclei were isolated as described above and stored at\n-80\u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was reconstituted in MilliQ\nwater and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The\nnuclear fraction was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid\n(TFA) to a final concentration of 0.2%, sonicated and cen-\nnatant was applied to an activated Sep-Pak C18 extraction\ncolumn, washed with 0.2% TFA, and the peptide fraction\nMeasurement of immunoreactive Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in\nthe extracted nuclei was performed using two distinct radi-\noimmunoassays (RIAs).24 The Ang-(1-7) RIA fully recog-\nnizes Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(2-7), but cross-reacts less than\n0.01% with Ang-(3\u00ad7), Ang II, Ang I, and their fragments.\nThe Ang II RIA equally recognizes Ang III, Ang-(3-8), and\nAng-(4-8), but cross-reacts less than 0.01% with Ang I and\nAng-(1-7). The limit of detection was 4 fmol/ tube for\nAng-(1-7) and 0.5 fmol/ tube for Ang II.\nRenin assay\nThe cell nuclei were isolated as described above and stored\nat -80\u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was reconstituted in 2 ml of 25\non ice. A sample from the lysate was taken for protein con-\ntent. For basal renin activity assay, 0.4 ml of nuclear lysate\nwas added to 0.2 ml of nephrectomized rat plasma (NRP)\nas the source of exogenous AGT substrate. The following\nprotease inhibitors were added to prevent the metabolism\nof Ang I: amastatin (AM; 2 M), bestatin (BS; 10 M),\nchymostatin (CHYM; 10 M), benzyl succinate (BSC; 10\nM), para-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB; 0.5 mM)\nand Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (2.5 mM) (all\nat final concentrations). The assay was performed at 37\u00baC\nfor 90 min alone or with the renin inhibitor aliskiren (1 M,\nfinal concentration).24 Activation of prorenin was per-\nformed by addition of 0.1 mg trypsin (Sigma) to the nuclear\nsample with the peptidase inhibitors for 60 min on ice.24\nTrypsin was inactivated by incubation with an excess of\nsoybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 15\nmin at room temperature. SBTI is a potent serine protease\ninhibitor that does not attenuate renin, an aspartyl protease.\nFollowing SBTI, the renin assay was performed as\ndescribed above. All renin and prorenin samples were\nextracted on Sep-Pak C18 columns prior to the assessment\nof Ang I by RIA as described.24 Blank values for the assay\n(aliskerin with and without lysates) were subtracted from\nthe sample values; renin activity was expressed as nmol\nAng I generated per h per mg protein.\nAGT assay for renin\nA rat kidney cortical homogenate as a source for renin was\nadded to a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma) (1/100)\nand SBTI (1 mg) in the presence or absence of aliskiren\n(10 M) in a final volume of 1 ml buffer (10 mM HEPES,\n, pH 7.4). NRP as the source\nof intact AGT was then added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60\nanalyzed by western blot using the AI-AGT antibody. The\nmembrane was then stripped and probed with the second\nAGT antibody, Int-AGT.\nPeptide metabolism\nTo characterize the processing of the peptides in vitro,\n125I-Ang-I or Ang II (0.5 nM) were incubated with the sol-\nubilized nuclear fractions as previously described.25\nMetabolism assays were conducted at 37\u00b0C in 10 mM\nprotein of the nuclear fraction in a final volume of 0.5 ml\nwith or without the indicated inhibitors. The reaction was\nstopped by addition of ice-cold 1.0% phosphoric acid, cen-\nSamples were separated by reverse-phase high-performance\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) and the 125I-products were\ndetected by a flow-through  detector.25 Products were\nidentified by comparison of their retention times to\n125I-angiotensin standards. Peptides were iodinated by the\nchloramine T method and purified by HPLC (specific\nactivity > 2000 Ci/mmol). The aminopeptidase inhibitors\namastatin AM (2 M) and BS (10 M) were included in\nthe basal assay conditions. We subsequently used the fol-\nlowing inhibitors to block thiol peptidases (PCMB; 0.5\ngopeptidase (Z-prolyl prolinal or ZPP, 50 M) and thimet\noligopeptidase (c-phenylpropyl-alanine-alanine-phenyla-\nlanine-p-aminobenzoate or CPP, 50 M). Enzyme activi-\nties were expressed as fmol product per mg protein per\nmin (fmol/mg/min).\nStatistical analysis\nAll measurements are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error\n(SEM). Differences between the groups were analyzed by\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-\nKeuls multiple comparison analysis. All figures were con-\nstructed with GraphPad Prism V plotting and statistical\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California,\nUSA). A probability value of <0.05 was required for statis-\ntical significance.\nResults\nAGT antibodies\nThe present study utilized antibodies raised against two\ndifferent epitopes of the AGT protein. The AI-AGT anti-\nbody recognized the N terminus or Ang I sequence of rat\nAGT while the Int-AGT antibody was directed against an\ninternal sequence distal to Ang I.21 We characterized both\nantibodies by protein immunoblots using 0.5\u00ad5.0 \u00b5l of\neither NRP as a source of intact AGT or commercial FBS\nin which the NRK-E52 cells were routinely maintained\n(Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1(a), the AI-AGT anti-\nbody recognized two protein bands of approximately 60\nand 55 kDa from the NRP, as well as two similar sized\nbands in the FBS. The NRP samples were then exposed to\nrenin from a rat cortical homogenate at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C with\nor without the renin inhibitor aliskiren and the immunob-\nlot probed with the AI-AGT antibody. In the absence of\naliskiren, the AGT band was reduced at 15 min and\nessentially abolished by 30 min at 37\u00b0C (Figure 1(b)).\nAddition of aliskiren or incubation at 4\u00b0C prevented the\ndisappearance of the protein up to 60 min. In contrast, the\nInt-AGT antibody clearly recognized AGT in the NRP\nsamples (Figure 1(c), 0.5\u00ad5.0 \u00b5l serum), but did not\ndetect AGT in FBS (Figure 1(c)). The Int-AGT antibody\nappeared to exhibit greater sensitivity to rat AGT; the\nantibody detected 0.5 \u00b5l of NRP while the AI-AGT anti-\nbody required a sample volume two- to five-fold higher\n(lane 4, Figure 1(c) versus 1(a)). Moreover, re-probing\nthe immunoblot from Figure 1(b) with the Int-AGT anti-\nbody revealed the AGT bands in the samples incubated\nwith renin (Figure 1(d)). These data confirm that the Int-\nAGT antibody recognized residues distal to the Ang I\nsequence of AGT in rat plasma, but not FBS, and that the\nAI-AGT antibody does not detect the renin-processed or\ndes-Ang I form of rat AGT (and likely FBS). Utilizing\nthe two AGT antibodies, we assessed expression of the\nprotein by immunofluorescent (IMF) staining and protein\nimmunoblots of isolated nuclear and cytosolic fractions\nof the NRK-52E cells (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2(a)\nand 2(b), IMF staining with the AI-AGT antibody\nrevealed primarily cytosolic staining of the protein that\nwas apparently exclusive of the nucleus. Moreover, the\nimmunoblot showed a 55 kDa band in the cytosolic frac-\ntion (lanes 4\u00ad6), but no immunoreactive band in the\nnuclear fraction of the NRK-52E cells (lanes 1\u00ad3, Figure\n2(c)). In contrast, IMF staining with the Int-AGT anti-\nbody revealed the predominant localization of AGT to\nthe area of the cell nucleus (Figure 2(d) and 2(e)). The\nFigure 1.

As shown\nin Figure 3(a), IMF staining for renin revealed the pre-\ndominant nuclear localization of the enzyme in the cells.\nProtein immunoblots of the nuclear and cytosolic frac-\ntions also revealed a predominant immunoreactive band\nat ~ 55 kDa in the nuclear fraction and a faint band in the\ncytosol (Figure 3(b)). We next assessed renin activity in\nisolated nuclei of the NRK-52E cells by addition of exog-\nenous NRP AGT in the absence or presence of aliskiren.\nFigure 2. Angiotensinogen (AGT) expression in the NRK-52E cells: (a) immunofluorescent (IMF) staining of NRK-52E cells with\nthe angiotensin I (Ang I) AGT (AI-AGT) antibody reveals predominantly cytosolic (Cyt) staining; (b) identical image of (a) with\nDAPI nuclear (Nuc) staining in blue; (c) immunoblot of nuclear and cytosolic fractions with AI-AGT antibody reveals a predominant\n55 kDa band in cytosolic fractions; (d) IMF staining with internal sequence of AGT (Int-AGT) antibody reveals nuclear associated\nstaining; (e) identical image of (d) with DAPI nuclear (Nuc) staining in blue; (f) immunoblot of nuclear and cytosolic fractions reveals\npredominant 55 kDa band in the nuclear fraction. IMF staining was representative of three different cell passages. Immunoblot\nfractions were from three different cell passages.\naliskiren reduced activity by 83% (Figure 3(c)). To deter-\nmine the prorenin levels, nuclear extracts were pretreated\nwith trypsin to convert prorenin to renin and the genera-\ntion of Ang I from NRP AGT was determined in the pres-\nence of the trypsin inhibitor SBTI. Trypsin activation of\nnuclear prorenin significantly increased enzyme activity\nprotein/h and aliskiren inhibited 93% of theAng I-forming\nactivity (Figure 3(c)). These findings suggest the presence\nof both renin and prorenin in the NRK-52E cell nuclei.\nSince prorenin may preferentially bind to the prorenin\nreceptor to increase catalytic activity and/or induce cell\nsignaling, we stained the cells with an antibody against\nthe prorenin receptor. As shown in Figure 3(d), IMF stain-\ning revealed primarily perinuclear staining of the PRR in\ncells counter-stained with the nuclear marker DAPI shown\nFigure 3. Renin and prorenin receptor (PRR) expression in NRK-52E cells: (a) immunofluorescent (IMF) staining of NRK-52E cells\nwith the renin antibody reveals nuclear-associated staining; (b) immunoblot of nuclear and cytosolic fractions with renin antibody\nreveals a 55 kDa (arrow) band in the nuclear fraction from cells of three different passages.

In comparison, cells were also stained with an\nantibody to calnexin, a protein intrinsic to the perinuclear/\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and the DAPI\nmarker (Figure 3(e)).\nAng peptides\nThe expression of both AGT and renin within the NRK-\n52E cell nuclei may suggest a pathway for the intracellular\nsynthesis of Ang peptides. Therefore, we assessed the cell\nstaining and content of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) by two dis-\ntinct antibodies specific to the C-terminus of each peptide.\nAs shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the affinity-purified\nantibodies toAng II andAng-(1-7) revealed predominantly\nnuclear staining. Consistent with this pattern of staining,\nnuclear extracts from four different cell passages con-\nprotein of Ang-(1-7) (Figure 4(c)). We then examined the\npotential processing enzymes that may contribute to Ang\nII or Ang-(1-7) within the nucleus.

Conversion of angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang-(1-7) in isolated nuclei from NRK-52E cells. High-performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) analysis of 125I-Ang I metabolism at 37\u00b0C revealed primarily Ang-(1-7) at (a) 15 min and (b) 60 min. The\nneprilysin inhibitor SCH39370 (SCH; 10 M) or prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor z-prolyl-prolinal (ZPP; 50 M) did not inhibit Ang-(1-\n7) generation (shown in (c) and (d), respectively). The thimet oligopeptidase inhibitor (CPP; 50 M) and the thiol inhibitor (PCMB;\n500 M) essentially abolished Ang-(1-7) production (shown in (e) and (f), respectively). A minor peak of Ang-(1-4) was detected in\npanels (b)\u00ad(f).\nof Ang I metabolism at 15 and 60 min (Figure 5(a) and\n5(b), respectively). Ang I exhibited a half-life of 73 min in\nthe nuclear cell extracts and Ang-(1-7) was the primary\nproduct over the 120 min time course (Figure 6). In con-\ntrast, there was minimal metabolism of the Ang II in the\nnuclear extracts with >70% of the peptide intact at 120 min\n(data not shown).\nThere are several endopeptidases including neprilysin,\nprolyl oligopeptidase and thimet oligopeptidase that\ndirectly process Ang I to Ang-(1-7).26 The neprilysin\nagent SCH39370 and the prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor\nZPP did not block the generation of Ang-(1-7) in the\nnuclear extract (Figure 5(c) and 5(d), respectively). Both\nthe thimet oligopeptidase inhibitor CPP and the thiol pro-\ntease inhibitor PCMB markedly reduced the peak of Ang-\n(1-7) and preserved the peak of Ang I (Figure 5(e) and\n5(f), respectively). Evaluation of these inhibitors at the 60\nmin incubation period revealed that CPP and PCMB\ninhibited Ang-(1-7) formation by over 80% and suggests\nthat thimet oligopeptidase converts Ang I to Ang-(1-7) in\nisolated nuclei (Figure 7). We next assessed the Ang-(1-7)\nand Ang-(1-4)-forming activities at 120 min in the pres-\nence of CPP and SCH39370. Again, thimet oligopeptidase\naccounted for the majority of Ang-(1-7) at this time\n(Figure 8); however, there remained small peaks of Ang-\n(1-7) and Ang-(1-4) with CPP (Figure 8(b)). Addition of\nSCH39370 to CPP appeared to further reduce both Ang-\n(1-7) and Ang-(1-4) (Figure 8(c)), but the response did not\nreach statistical significance (Figure 8(d)).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study we characterized the RAS in the NRK-\n52E epithelial cell line to facilitate our understanding of\nthis intracellular system. The NRK-52E cells are widely\nutilized to examine the functional aspects of the Ang\nreceptor pathway, as well as the counter-regulatory\nfindings revealed that NRK-52E cells express multiple\ncomponents of an intracellular RAS and parallel our previ-\nous findings in the isolated tubules of the sheep kidney.9 In\nthis case, both immunofluorescent staining and western\nblots demonstrated that NRK-52E cells express AGT,\nprorenin, PRR and the peptides Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in\nthe nuclear or perinuclear compartments. Activity studies\nrevealed renin-dependent conversion to Ang I; however,\nprorenin was the more abundant form of the enzyme in a\n3:1 ratio in the nuclear fraction. Finally, we demonstrate\nendopeptidase activity in the nuclear fraction that converts\nAng I directly to Ang-(1-7) without the prerequisite forma-\ntion of Ang II. The identity of the nuclear endopeptidase is\nlikely thimet oligopeptidase based on the sensitivity to\nboth the selective inhibitor CPP and the thiol agent PCMB.\nUtilizing two different antibodies to rat AGT, we primar-\nily detected the processed form of AGT (des-Ang I Aogen)\nin the nucleus. Sherrod et al. detected AGT primarily in the\nnucleus of human astrocytes and identified a nuclear locali-\nzation signal in the C-terminal portion of the protein; how-\never, these studies did not determine whether the precursor\nFigure 7.

All values represent mean\u00b1standard error of the\nmean (SEM), n=4 from different cell passages; *p<0.01 vs\ncontrol.\nFigure 6.

Indeed, this may constitute a pathway for the genera-\ntion and delivery of peptide ligands to nuclearAng receptors\nevident in the tubule epithelium, as well as in other tissues.\nAlternatively,AGT may be processed outside of the nucleus\nand the des-Ang I form subsequently transported to the\nnucleus. Apart from its role as the precursor to Ang II or\nAng-(1-7), nuclear AGT may potentially contribute to cell\nsignaling and function. Moreover, two studies reveal that\nboth intact and the Ang I-cleaved forms of AGT attenuated\nangiogenesis.33,34 In this regard, Pan et al. reported high affin-\nity binding sites forAGT that internalized following binding\nin primary cultures of human proximal tubules.35 In contrast\nto the nuclear localization of des-Ang I AGT, the Ang\nI-directed antibody revealed the protein in both the cytosolic\ncompartment of the NRK-52E cells, as well as in FBS. The\ncirculating RAS is upregulated during pregnancy and the\npresence of AGT in FBS is not surprising. Since the Int-\nAGT antibody failed to recognize FBS AGT or detect AGT\nto the same extent as the AI-AGT antibody in the cell cyto-\nsol, it is possible that cytosolicAGT may primarily originate\nfrom uptake of AGT in the cell media. Recent studies have\nquestioned the prevailing tenet that tubular AGT solely\nreflects local synthesis of the protein.36,37 Indeed, the protein\ntransporter megalin may mediate the cellular uptake and sta-\nble sequestration of AGT within a subset of renal proximal\ntubules.37 However, it is not clear as to the cellular fate of\nAGT taken up from the tubular fluid and whether this path-\nway contributes to the generation ofAng peptides.

Alternatively, provided the cytosolic\nform of AGT arises primarily from FBS, the presence of\nintact AGT may reflect inefficient processing by rat renin\ndue to species differences in the recognition of AGT by\nrenin. Clearly, additional studies are required to elucidate\nwhether the cytosolic from of AGT in the NRK-52E cells\nreflects the uptake of FBS AGT and the extent that megalin\ncontributes to this process.\nThe present characterization of the RAS in the NRK-\n52E cells arose from the demonstration of nuclear renin\nand AGT in isolated sheep proximal tubules, as well as the\nexpression of Ang receptors on isolated nuclei.9 The local-\nization of renin to the non-juxtaglomerular (JG) compart-\nments of the kidney is somewhat controversial. Rohrwasser\nand colleagues originally demonstrated renin in the princi-\npal cells of the collecting duct in both the mouse and rat\nkidney.38,39 Subsequent studies suggest that renin regula-\ntion in the collecting duct of the rat kidney differs from\nthat of JG-derived renin.40,41 Immunoreactive renin and\nmRNA expression were also reported in the proximal\ntubules; however, the intracellular localization of the pro-\ntease was not determined.42\u00ad44 In this regard, an intracel-\nlular or truncated form of renin was identified in the\nmitochondria which may contribute to local Ang II genera-\ntained both active renin and prorenin that converted\nexogenous AGT to Ang I; this activity was essentially\nabolished by the renin inhibitor aliskerin. IMF staining\nalso revealed that the prorenin receptor localized to the\nperinuclear compartment of the NRK-52E cells which is\nconsistent with the findings of Schefe and colleagues.15\nApart from contributing to activation of the enzyme, the\nreceptor may bind prorenin to stimulate cellular pathways\nincluding mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase\nand transforming growth factor beta TGF- release that are\nnot dependent on the Ang II-AT1\nextent that renin or activated prorenin contributes to the\nintracellular formation of Ang II or Ang-(1-7) in the NRK-\n52E cells awaits further study. Furthermore, studies are\nnecessary to elucidate whether the PRR contributes to\nfunctional signaling pathways in these cells through an\ninteraction with intracellular prorenin.\nIn addition to AGT and renin, both immunoreactive\nAng II and Ang-(1-7) were identified in the isolated\nnuclear fractions of the NRK-52E cells. Camargo de\nAndrade et al initially reported IMF staining for both Ang\nII and Ang-(1-7) in the nucleus of isolated mesangial\ncells.10 Consistent with presence ofAng-(1-7) in the nuclei,\nwe find an endopeptidase-like activity that processed Ang\nI predominantly to Ang-(1-7). The inhibitor profile sug-\ngested that the nuclear peptidase is likely thimet oligo-\nendopeptidases that form Ang-(1-7) including neprilysin\ndid not significantly reduce the conversion of Ang I to\nAng-(1-7). Thimet oligopeptidase is a zinc-dependent\nmember of the metallopeptidase M3 family, but is sensi-\ntive to thiol or cysteine inhibitors such as PCMB and the\nselective inhibitor CPP.50\u00ad52 Interestingly, thimet oligo-\npeptidase was localized to the nucleus of neurons in the rat\nbrain by immunocytochemical staining.53,54 In this regard,\nThompson et al. identified the nuclear localization signal\nsequence for human thimet oligopeptidase.55 Moreover,\nthe overexpression of intracellular thimet oligopeptidase\nin human embryonic cells (HEK) cells attenuated Ang\nreceptor signaling as well as the actions of other G\nmation from Ang I did not result in the generation of Ang\nII in the nuclear fraction nor did we find extensive metabo-\nlism ofAng II toAng-(1-7) or any other products.Although\nthese findings suggest that Ang II is stable in the nuclear\nfraction, they do not identify the pathway for the nuclear\nformation or sequestration of Ang II and we can only sug-\ngest several possibilities for the nuclear expression of Ang\nII at this time. The peptide may arise from the direct pro-\ncessing of AGT through a non-renin mechanism or an\nAlternatively, nuclear Ang II may reflect the trafficking of\nthe Ang II-AT1\nreceptor complex from the plasma mem-\nbrane to the nucleus.58\u00ad62 Finally, Gonzalez-Villalobos et\nal. report that uptake of both Ang II and Ang-(1-7) was\nfacilitated by the protein transporter megalin in the opos-\nsum kidney (OK) epithelial cell line, an accepted cell\nmodel for megalin-dependent uptake of albumin; however,\nthe intracellular fate of the internalized peptides was not\nIn conclusion, the present study characterized the NRK-\n52E epithelial cell line as a tubule model for the expression\nof the intracellular RAS components within the kidney.\nThe kidney is one of the primary targets to specifically\nblock the ACE-Ang II-AT1\nreceptor axis by various thera-\npeutic approaches including ACE inhibition, AT1\nreceptor\nantagonism, and more recently, renin blockade to attenuate\nblood pressure and renal injury. However, these regimens\nmay not completely prevent the pathological consequences\nof an activated RAS. This may result from either insuffi-\ncient drug doses to effectively block the intracellular RAS,\nlow lipophilicity of certain agents that leads to inadequate\nintracellular concentrations, or an inability to inhibit\ndownstream signaling pathways independent of Ang II\ngeneration.65 Indeed, increasing the dose of candesartan to\na level higher than the maximal recommended dose for\nheart failure and hypertension significantly reduced persis-\ntent proteinuria without a further decline in blood pres-\nsure.66 Renin inhibitors such as aliskiren do not block the\nbinding of prorenin to the receptor.67 Therefore, the proin-\nflammatory and profibrotic responses of an activated RAS\nmay not be completely attenuated by renin inhibitors that\nwould effectively reduce blood pressure. In this regard,\nintroducing membrane permeable nonpeptide agonists for\nreceptors along with renin inhibition and\nARBs may overcome the loss of either AT7\nreceptor\nactivation by renin inhibitors, as well as achieve maximal\nblockade of the deleterious effects of the AngII-AT1\nrecep-\ntor axis.\n"
