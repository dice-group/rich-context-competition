In Experiment 1, participants were primed subliminally with the counter-\nstereotypic word educated or with the stereotypic word ignorant, followed by the target stimulus of a Black man's face. A\nrecognition memory task for the target's face and six lures (skin tone variations of \u00b125%, \u00b137%, and \u00b150%) revealed that\nparticipants primed with \"educated\" exhibited more memory errors with respect to lighter lures--misidentifying even the\nlightest lure as the target more often than counterparts primed with \"ignorant.\" This skin tone memory bias was replicated\nin Experiment 2. We situate these findings in theorizing on the mind's striving for cognitive consistency. Black individuals who\ndefy social stereotypes might not challenge social norms sufficiently but rather may be remembered as lighter, perpetuating\nstatus quo beliefs.\n",

We chose to follow Levin and Banaji's\nexhortation by exploring the possible effects of a stereotype\nexpectancy violation on recognition memory for skin tone,\nusing a Black male target face (an unambiguous-race face).\nThe rationale for using a paradigm that is centered on an\nunambiguous-race face, instead of the oft-used ambiguous-\nrace face paradigm, is that for the former (but not for the\nlatter) there exist clear stereotypic and counter-stereotypic\nexpectancies.\nOur experimental paradigm employed forward and back-\nward masking procedures following Pessiglione et al. (2008).\nParticipants were primed subliminally with a Black counter-\nstereotypic word (educated; expectancy-violating) or with a\nBlack stereotypic word (ignorant; expectancy-congruent),\nwhich was followed immediately by a photograph of a Black\nman's face. Participants were thus unaware of the prime\nbefore completing a speeded recognition memory task for\nand darker in skin tone).\nWe contend that encountering the counter-stereotypic\nword educated (for education as connoting White vs. Black,\nJudd, & Park, 1997) prior to viewing a Black person's face\nwould likely result in a \"Whitening\" of the target's face in\nmemory. This prediction can be situated in recent theorizing\non stereotype disconfirmation and cognitive consistency. In\nparticular, Sherman, Allen, and Sacchi (2012) argued that a\ncounter-stereotypic instance tends to create an incompatible\ncognition, which is then oftentimes resolved by assimilating\nindividuating information to the stereotype. Within Sherman\net al.'s (2012) framework, encountering an educated Black\nmale could lead to reclassification of this individual as an\natypical exemplar or a subtype of his racial category, which\npreserves cultural beliefs about racial category structure.\nFrom a cognitive consistency viewpoint (also see\nGawronski, Peters, Brochu, & Strack, 2008), encountering\nthe word ignorant prior to viewing the Black target's face\nshould not lead to memory distortions because a stereotypic\nprime would be congruent with societal expectations and\ntherefore would not create an incompatible cognition that\nwould require dissonance reduction (per Sherman et al.,\n2012). There is some evidence, however, that Black stereo-\ntypic primes cause people to falsely recognize more proto-\ntypical Black exemplars. Specifically, Eberhardt et al. (2004)\nfound that (a) Black stereotypic crime-related primes elicited\nfaster responses and more sustained attention to Black versus\nWhite faces in a dot-probe task (Studies 2 and 3) and (b) after\nbeing presented with crime-related primes, police officers\nwere more likely to falsely identify a Black lure, which was\nmore stereotypical than the target (Study 4). Eberhardt et al.\nargued that a Black stereotypic prime, such as crime, might\neither activate a prototypical Black male or perhaps several\nBlack male exemplars in memory that \"seem most physi-\ncally representative of the Black racial category (i.e., those\nwho look highly stereotypical)\" (p. 877; also see Osborne &\nDavies, 2013, for evidence that Black stereotypic crimes\ncause an increased misattribution of Afrocentric features to\nperpetrators). Despite the fact that Eberhardt et al. did not\nexamine the effects of stereotype-driven expectancies on\nmemory distortions for a given Black male face--they exam-\nined instead whether a Black target face would be confused\nwith a different and more stereotypical Black male lure in a\npolice lineup--their findings raise the possibility that\nencountering a stereotypic word (e.g., ignorant) prior to\nviewing a Black target face would result in a more stereo-\ntypic representation of that face's features in memory, includ-\ning a darker skin tone. Such a finding would beckon revising\nthe current theorizing, which is based on a dissonance-reduc-\ntion cognitive consistency framework, to include a prototype\nactivation mechanism for stereotypic primes.\nStereotypes provide important cognitive functions such as\norganization and prediction (Hamilton & Sherman, 1994),\nego protection (e.g., Fein & Spencer, 1997), and preparation\nfor action in the social world (see Morsella & Ben-Zeev,\n2012). Given that a skin tone memory bias would function in\nthe service of stereotype maintenance, even partial evidence\nfor its existence--a Black male becoming lighter or darker in\nthe mind's eye, following a counter-stereotypic or a stereo-\ntypic prime, respectively--would have grave implications.\nIn other words, it is possible that a stereotype could become\na prepotent response for organizing incoming visual infor-\nmation, resulting in a heightened \"perceptual readiness\"\n(Bruner, 1957) for distorting a person's skin tone in the direc-\ntion of that stereotype (a \"visual tuning device\" per Eberhardt\net al., 2004). A skin tone memory bias might persevere even\nin the face of counter-stereotypic exemplars that might have\notherwise served to defy stereotype-based expectancies,\nresulting in a \"catch-22\" between an allegedly diagnostic\nracial feature and social beliefs.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 was designed to examine whether participants\nwould evince a skin tone memory bias as a function of coun-\nter-stereotypic versus stereotypic subliminal primes, using\nforward and backward masking procedures based on\nPessiglione et al. (2008). The use of subliminal priming\naffords exploring the effects of counter-stereotypic/stereo-\ntypic primes while overcoming social desirability factors\nthat would likely be elicited with an explicit presentation of\nthe same primes. A prime appeared for 33 ms, flanked tem-\nporally by pre- and post-masks for 67 ms each. The presenta-\ntion of the prime was designed to occur below the threshold\nof conscious awareness and the sequence appeared to be a\nstatic supraliminal image of the pattern mask (see Figure 1b).\nThe subliminal primes were presented in black font using\n40-point Helvetica and displayed centrally on a 50.8 cm\nBen-Zeev et al. 3\nApple iMac monitor with a viewing distance of approxi-\nmately 48 cm. The priming procedures were pilot-tested with\nrespect to stimulus durations (N= 17) to ensure that the prime\nwas below the threshold of conscious awareness (no pilot\nparticipants reported seeing the prime at 33 ms). Primes\n(educated, ignorant, and athletic) were selected from the\nliterature (Wittenbrink et al., 1997) and were pilot-tested\n(N = 36) with regard to stereotypicality. We purposely\nselected the words educated and ignorant given prevalent\nstereotypes alleging intellectual inferiority of Blacks versus\nWhites (Steele, 1997), but included the positively valenced\nword athletic to control for the possibility of an inadvertent\nvalence effect (rather than the predicted counter-stereotypic\nvs. stereotypic effect) between the semantically opposite\neducated and ignorant primes. The prime was followed\nimmediately by a presentation of the target photograph (see\nFigure 1a). On a subsequent recognition memory task, par-\nticipants were presented with the Black male target1 and six\nvariations of the target (lighter and darker in skin tone),\nwhich served as lures.\nIn accordance with a cognitive consistency framework,\nthe educated (counter-stereotypic or expectancy-violating)\nprime, as compared with the ignorant and athletic (stereo-\ntypic or expectancy-congruent) primes, was expected to lead\nto heightened memory errors (i.e., the proportion of incorrect\nidentifications of lures as the target) for lighter lures only,\nsuggesting that the target's skin tone would be remembered\nas relatively lighter. The expected effects for the darker lures\nwere less clear. A dissonance-reduction mechanism per cog-\nnitive consistency theorizing (Sherman et al., 2012) would\nsuggest that there would be no effect of prime on the darker\nlures. However, Eberhardt et al.'s (2004) Study 4 findings\noffer the possibility of heightened memory errors for darker\nlures as well, such that the target's skin tone would be\nremembered as relatively darker following a stereotypic\nprime; perhaps resulting from the activation of a Black male\nprototype.\nMethod\nParticipants. Participants were 125 undergraduate students at\nSan Francisco State University2 who participated in exchange\nfor partial course credit. All participants had normal or cor-\nrected-to-normal vision.\nMaterials. The stimuli consisted of seven color photographs: A\ntarget Black male and six variations of the target (\u00b125%, \u00b137%,\nand \u00b150%), which served as lures.3 All photographs had 206 \u00d7\nProcedure.Participants were recruited to participate in a\n\"study on memory for faces\" and randomly assigned to\nbetween-subjects subliminal prime conditions: counter-ste-\nreotypic (educated) and two stereotypic conditions (ignorant\nand athletic). To ensure that participants attended to the\nsubliminal prime, participants were instructed to focus their\nattention on the center of the computer screen. Following the\npresentation of the subliminal prime, participants were given\n30 s to study the target photo for later recognition. Partici-\npants subsequently completed 16 trials of a working memory\ndistractor task (a modified n-back task), in which they viewed\nrandom digits (from 0 to 9) presented sequentially and were\nprompted at random intervals to input the last three digits.\nParticipants then completed the recognition task. Stimulus\npresentation was controlled using PsyScope Experiment\nSoftware (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993).\nThe recognition task consisted of 28 trials in which the\ntarget and lures were presented 4 times each in random order.\nParticipants were asked to indicate Yes/No to the question\n\"Is this face IDENTICAL to the one you studied originally?\"\nFor each experimental trial, participants viewed a central\nfixation point (+) for 500 ms, followed by the stimulus\n(a target or lure) for 255 ms, which was succeeded by a ques-\ntion mark that remained on the screen until participants indi-\ncated a response (by pressing either the \"f\" or \"j\" key;\ncounterbalanced across participants). The fixation point was\nthen replaced by an equal sign (=). After 1,000 ms, the next\nexperimental trial initiated (see Figure 1c). Finally, partici-\npants completed a funneled debriefing (Bargh & Chartrand,\n2000). None of the participants reported seeing the prime.\nResults and Discussion\ncated that participants were able to consistently recognize the\ntarget, on average three out of four target presentations.\nEffects of prime type on memory errors to the lightest and dark-\nest lures.

We examine this phenomenon further\nin Experiment 2.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, we added two additional stimuli as distrac-\ntors (i.e., fox and greeble targets and their respective lures)\nand framed this study as one that was intended to measure\n\"color perception and visual acuity\" to (a) explore whether\nthe skin tone memory bias found in Experiment 1 would rep-\nlicate and (b) attempt to rule out the possibility that the find-\nings might have been due to the word educated itself, which\nperhaps has a unique association with lightness that is not\nspecific to race-based social categorization (e.g., educated as\nconnoting light, as illustrated by the word enlightened). We\ndecided a priori to include only the semantically opposite\nprimes of educated versus ignorant, which have been shown\nto be associated with education-related stereotypes about\nBlack individuals (e.g., Fiske, 2005; Gaertner & McLaughlin,\nwas used in Experiment 1 to rule out a valence effect, was\nnot included because it was shown to not differ from the\nignorant prime. If the skin tone memory bias found in\nExperiment 1 would replicate in human but not in other cat-\negories, we would expect that the Black male but not the\nnon-human targets would be subject to heightened memory\nerrors following the counter-stereotypic prime (educated) as\ncompared with its semantically opposite stereotypic prime\n(ignorant).\nMethod\nParticipants.\nThirty-five San Francisco State University\nundergraduate students participated in exchange for partial\ncourse credit. All participants had normal or corrected-to-\nnormal vision.\nMaterials. All materials were the same as those used in Exper-\niment 1 with the exception of two additional targets (fox and\ngreeble) and their respective lures (see Figure 3a). We selected\na red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a biological kind stimulus (e.g.,\nMedin & Ortony, 1989) and a greeble as a computer-gener-\nated stimulus documented to activate face-processing regions\nsimilarly to human faces (e.g., Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson,\nSkudlarski, & Gore, 1999). The original photograph of the\nBlack male, fox, and greeble served as targets, with six varia-\ntions per target (\u00b125%, \u00b137%, and \u00b150%) as lures. Thus, each\nparticipant viewed a total of 21 different images.\nProcedure.All procedures were identical to those used in\nExperiment 1 with the following exceptions. Participants in\nExperiment 2 were randomly assigned to one of two between-\nsubjects prime conditions: counter-stereotypic (educated) or\nstereotypic (ignorant). The study time for the original images\nfollowing the prime was increased from 30 s to 60 s because\nparticipants were being asked to simultaneously study three\ntarget stimuli instead of one. The recognition task consisted\nof 84 trials in which each of the 21 pictures was randomly\npresented four times.\nResults and Discussion\nAccuracy to the Black male target was similar to that of\nExperiment 1 (M = .77, SE = .054) and not significantly dif-\nFigure 2.

Tarr, Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition and Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity, http://www.tarrlab.org/.\nBen-Zeev et al. 7\nExperiment 2 data thus corroborate the findings from\nExperiment 1 and provide further support for the hypothesis\nthat a skin tone memory bias exists and is specific to racial\ncategorization, such that--in line with cognitive consistency\ntheorizing--a counter-stereotypical Black male is remem-\nbered as lighter in complexion.\nGeneral Discussion\nTaken together, the present data provide evidence that a\ncounter-stereotypic Black male tends to be remembered as\n\"Whiter\" in accordance with cultural beliefs and thus offer\nsupport for the existence of a skin tone memory bias. We use\nWhiter versus White, because a \"one-drop\" rule has been\ndocumented to guide automatic judgments of racial category\nmembership, such that a Black\u00adWhite biracial individual\ntends to be perceived as Black (Peery & Bodenhausen, 2008;\nalso see Halberstadt, Sherman, & Sherman, 2011, for a cate-\ngorization-based account of hypodescent). These findings--\na counter-stereotypic (expectancy-violating) but not a\nstereotypic (expectancy-congruent) effect--are consistent\nwith the mind's striving for cognitive consistency or the ten-\ndency to attempt to resolve an incompatible cognition in the\ndirection of a stereotype (Sherman et al., 2012). Whereas\nencountering a Black individual after being primed with the\nword educated might pose a challenge to existing beliefs,\nencountering a Black individual after being primed with the\nword ignorant would likely not require resolution or a misre-\nmembering of skin tone to align with these beliefs; especially\nin light of work on hypodescent (Halberstadt et al., 2011;\nA caveat is in order, however. It is possible that our cur-\nrent stimuli and paradigm were not sensitive enough to\nuncover a stereotypic-driven expectancy-congruent skin\ntone memory bias. Education-related primes might have dif-\nferential effects on memory distortions of Black targets than\ndo crime-related primes, such as those used by Eberhardt\net al. (2004). A Black target primed as a criminal (vs. as\nbeing uneducated) might be perceived as more threatening,\nperhaps causing an activation of a Black male prototype (see\nEberhardt et al., 2004, for how some concepts might be more\ncentral to the activation of a group prototype), and any ensu-\ning effects on memory for skin tone. In addition, the present\nexperiments required participants to study a single Black\nmale face while being informed that they would later be\ngiven a recognition test for this target face, whereas Eberhardt\net al. (Study 4) used five Black faces (the target and four\nlures: two that were less stereotypic than the target and two\nthat were more stereotypic than the target) and used an inci-\ndental memory paradigm. Eberhardt et al. argued that prim-\ning police officers with crime \"led them to envision a Black\nface that was even more strongly representative of the Black\nracial category than the Black face to which they were actu-\nally exposed\" (p. 888). It is thus possible that a stereotypic-\ndriven skin tone memory bias could occur under certain\nconditions, such as in the process of selecting a target face\nfrom a set of different Black males who vary systematically\nwith regard to stereotypicality (as in Eberhardt et al.'s\nlineup). We thus advocate for further research on the nuanced\nnature of a skin tone memory bias and its underlying mecha-\nnisms, which should use a variety of primes, stimuli, and\nparadigms, as well as measure people's experience of disso-\nnance directly.\nUncovering a skin tone memory bias, in which an edu-\ncated Black man becomes lighter in the mind's eye, is worth-\nwhile in its own right given the documented detrimental\neffects of a skin tone bias held by White perceivers as well as\nby people of color (Maddox, 2004). Of equal import, a skin\ntone memory bias fits within a broader tradition of what is\nnow considered to be classical work on the effects of social\ncontext on perception and memory (Bruner, 1957; Bruner &\nrecent re-incarnation (a revitalized \"new look\" perspective,\nwork on how social categorization-based predictions bias\nperception and memory of socially diagnostic stimuli,\nincluding physical features, objects, and expressions of affect\n(also see Becker, Neel, & Anderson, 2010; Corneille, Huart,\nIn sum, a skin tone memory bias reinforces the bidirec-\ntional interplay between social contextual cues and memory\nfor an allegedly diagnostic racial feature, which conspires to\naffect judgments about and actions toward stigmatized indi-\nviduals--especially intellectually successful Black individu-\nals who are susceptible to being perceived as \"an exception\nto their race\" (e.g., Fowler, 2001)--in the direction of pre-\nserving existing beliefs.\n"
