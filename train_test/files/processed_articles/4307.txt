After 24 h, SMC migration was assessed by Boyden's chamber chemotactic\nassay using prorenin as chemotactic factor (10-8M). The effect of aliskiren on RhoA and Rac activity was also determined\nby G-LISA assay and the lamellipodia formation by rhodamine\u00adphalloidin staining. Changes in cell morphology were\nrecorded in real-time using the iCelligence system.\nResults: Aliskiren determined, at 10-5M, a significant inhibition of SMC migration induced by prorenin (-66.4\u00b118.1%; p <\n0.05), while no significant effect was observed when PDGF-BB was utilized as chemotactic agent. Aliskiren also reduced\nRac-GTP levels in response to prorenin (-54.2\u00b15.4%) without affecting the RhoA-GTP levels. Finally, aliskiren inhibited\nboth the lamellipodia formation and morphological changes induced by prorenin with no significant effect on PDGF-BB\nactivity.\nConclusions: Taken together, we provide the first evidence of the inhibitory action of aliskiren on SMC migration\ninduced by prorenin.\n",

Moreover, we have recently provided evidence that\nprorenin, through the activation of PRR, induces SMC\nmigration.16 It is therefore conceivable to hypothesize that\nPRR activation may promote both SMCs proliferation and\nmigration, pivotal features of atherogenesis.17\nAliskiren inhibits prorenin-induced\nhuman aortic smooth muscle\ncell migration\nNicola Ferri1, Federica Panariti1, Chiara Ricci1, Giuseppe\nMaiocchi2 and Alberto Corsini1\n Keywords\nMigration, small GTPases, smooth muscle cells, prorenin, Rac\nDipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0\ndegli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy\n2Novartis Farma S.p.A.

The\nrenin inhibition by aliskiren determines a significant\nincrease of renin and prorenin plasma concentrations,20 and\nthus potentially the activity of PRR in vascular SMCs.\nFrom the crystal structure modeling and the in vitro\nresults conducted with cells overexpressing PRR, it was\ndemonstrated that aliskiren does not interfere with the\nbinding of renin and prorenin to the PRR.13,21 However, in\na model of hypertensive diabetic renal damage, renin inhi-\nbition with aliskiren suppressed renal gene expression of\nthe PRR and its target genes transforming growth factor-\n(TGF-) and type I collagen.22 A similar inhibitory effect\nof aliskiren on PRR has been observed in human aortic\nSMCs incubated with both prorenin and ANG.23 Such\neffect determined a significant inhibition of the transcrip-\ntion of three genes, previously shown to be regulated by\nprorenin, such as TGF-, type I collagen and plasminogen\nactivator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).3,24 Thus, aliskiren inhibits the\nin vivo RAAS activity by binding to the active site of cir-\nculating renin or the unmasked catalytic site of prorenin\nbound to PRR and by reducing the PRR expression.4,22,23\nAlthough the patho-physiological relevance of the PRR\ndown-regulation by aliskiren still needs to be fully eluci-\ndated, results from in vivo experimental studies suggest\nthat, to some extent, the anti-atherosclerotic properties of\naliskiren are independent from the hypotension effect.25\u00ad28\nBased on these premises, in the present study we tested the\nhypothesis that aliskiren may interfere with the prorenin-\ndependent chemotactic effect on human aortic SMCs.\nMaterial and methods\nCell culture\nHuman aortic SMCs were purchased from PromoCell\nand cultured in Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium 2\nsupplemented with 5%FCS, 0.5 ng/mL of epidermal\ngrowth factor, 2 ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor,\nand 5 \u00b5g/mL of insulin. SMCs were utilized between pas-\nsage 5 and 9. ANG and prorenin were purchased from\nVinci-Biochem.\nExperimental protocols\nFor the determination of cell migration, SMCs were seeded\nmmpetridish.After24h,cellswereincubatedinDulbecco's\nmodified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.4% FCS,\nANG (1.5 \u00d7 10-7M) and increasing concentrations of\nwere harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in their\nconditioned media and the migration determined by\nBoyden's chamber chemotactic assay with prorenin\n(10-8M) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)\n(10-9M) as chemotactic agents for 6\u00ad8 h. Under the same\nexperimental conditions, the lamellipodia formation were\nassessed by rhodamine-phalloidin staining after 1 h stimu-\nlation, while for G-LISA assay cells were stimulated for 10\nminutes. Finally, changes of cell morphology were moni-\ntored every minute for 6 h after the addition of prorenin or\nPDGF-BB by iCelligence system.\nCell migration assay\nThe Boyden chamber and the polycarbonate membrane were\npurchased from Biomap (Agrate Brianza, Milan Italy). The\nmembranes were coated with a 0.1 mg/mL of type I collagen\nsolution (PureCol\u00ae, Nutacon BV, Leimuiden, The\nNetherlands) in 0.1M acetic acid at 37\u00b0C. The lower com-\npartments of the wells of a modified Boyden chamber were\nfilled (in triplicate) with DMEM containing 0.4% FCS in the\nabsence or presence of prorenin or PDGF-BB, whereas the\nupper compartments were filled with SMCs suspensions\ncontaining 106 cells/mL. The cells were resuspended with\ntheir conditioned media containingANG and increasing con-\ncentrations of aliskiren. The chamber was incubated at 37\u00b0C\nfor 6 h.The membrane was then carefully removed.Adherent\nSMCs on the top were eliminated and the membrane was\nstained with the Diff-Quik staining set (Biomap, Agrate\nBrianza, Milan Italy). The number of transmigrated cells was\ncounted in four random high-power fields (HPFs) under high\nCytoskeleton staining\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room tem-\nin phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and incubated\nwith rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy).\nCytoskeleton staining of cells was analyzed using a fluo-\nrescence microscope (Axiovert M220; Zeiss Instruments).\nReal-time monitoring of cell morphology using\nthe iCELLigence system\nThe iCELLigence system (ACEA Biosciences Inc, San\nDiego, CA, USA) monitors cellular events in real time by\nrecording the electrical impedance that is correlated with\ncell number, morphology and viability in a given culture\nwell. For analyzing SMCs morphology, 40.000 cells/well\nwere plated into the E-Plate L8, and the extent of cell spread-\ning was monitored every minute for 6 h with iCELLigence.\nThe assay system expresses impedance in arbitrary cell\nindex units (Rn\n- Rb\nis the cell\u00adelectrode\nimpedance of the well when it contains cells and Rb\nis the\nbackground impedance of the well with the media alone.\n286 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nG-LISA assay for Rac and RhoA\nThe intracellular amount of Rac-GTP and RhoA-GTP\nwere determined by using the G-LISA assay according to\nthe manufacturer's instruction (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver,\nStatistical analysis\nAll data shown are representative of at least three replicate\nexperiments. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SD. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using either the unpaired stu-\ndent's t test or 1-way ANOVA as appropriate; p values\n<0.05 were considered significant.\nResults\nIn a first series of experiments, the effect of aliskiren on\nSMC migration was determined by Boyden's chamber\nchemotactic assay. As previously reported,16 prorenin\npre-incubation with 10-5M aliskiren for 24 h determined a\nsignificant inhibition of the chemotactic effect\nmigration has been shown to be associated with the acti-\nvation of both RhoA and Rac small GTPase proteins.16\nThus the effect of aliskiren on the intracellular levels of\nRac-GTP and RhoA-GTP was investigated by G-LISA\nassay. As shown in Figure 2, prorenin increased both\naliskiren inhibited the activation of Rac (-54.2\u00b15.4%; p <\n0.05) while no effect was observed on RhoA-GTP levels\n(Figure 2).\nIn order to investigate whether the effect of aliskiren on\nSMC migration was specific to the prorenin stimulation, a\nseries of Boyden's chamber chemotactic assays using\nPDGF-BB as chemotactic agent was performed. SMCs\nwere incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.4%FCS\nand ANG in the presence or absence of increasing concen-\ntrations of aliskiren and then divided in two aliquots one\nfor the migration towards prorenin and one towards\nPDGF-BB. Interestingly, aliskiren significantly affected\nthe SMC migration induced by prorenin and no effect was\nobserved with PDGF-BB (Figure 3). These data suggest\nthat aliskiren selectively interferes with the prorenin\nmediated chemotactic action potentially by inhibiting Rac\nactivation.\nThe effect of aliskiren on lamellipodia formation was\nexamined by rhodamine-phalloidin staining of filamen-\ntous actin (F-actin). After 1 h stimulation of SMCs with\nprorenin or PDGF-BB, a significant redistribution of\nF-actin was observed, resulting in the production of lamel-\nlipodia and membrane protrusions (Figure 4). The pre-\nincubation of 10-5M aliskiren prior cell stimulation,\nsignificantly affected the lamellipodia formation in\nresponse to prorenin while no effect was observed with\nPDGF-BB (Figure 4).\nIn order to better define the effect of aliskiren on cell\nmorphology a real-time recording iCelligence system\nwas utilized. The major advantages of this system is that\nthe changes in cell morphology are monitored in real\ntime and reported as average of 80.000 cells. As shown in\nFigure 5, prorenin induced significant changes in cell\nmorphology as indicated by an increased cell index dur-\ning the first 3 h of stimulation reaching a plateau that was\nsustained up to 6 h. The presence of 10-5M aliskiren sig-\nnificantly reduces the cell index values by approximately\n40% during all the duration of the recorded time.\nDifferently from prorenin, PDGF-BB induced a strong\nand transient increase of cell index with a peak at 1h and\nthe presence of aliskiren did not affect this response.\nTaken together, aliskiren significantly affected the SMC\nFigure 1.

Recently, our group has\ndemonstrated that PRR mediates the chemotactic effect\nof prorenin on SMCs and this action is mainly mediated\nby the activation of the small GTPases Rac and RhoA.16\nIn addition, we and others, have documented that\naliskiren reduces the PRR expression in vivo and in\nvitro,22,23 which, in turn, determines an inhibitory action\non PRR activity.22,23 Indeed, the effect of aliskiren on\nPRR expression levels in human SMCs was shown to be\nsufficient to inhibit the transcription of at least three tar-\nget genes of prorenin, such as TGF-, PAI-1, and Type I\ncollagen22,23 In the present report, we extend these obser-\nvations, reporting the inhibitory effect of aliskiren on\nRac activation in response to prorenin and SMC migra-\ntion. The effect of aliskiren on cell migration was dem-\nonstrated by the Boyden's chamber chemotactic assay\nand confirmed by the real-time monitoring of cell mor-\nphology by iCelligence system and the analysis of lamel-\nlipodia formation. All these events were shown to be\nsignificantly inhibited by aliskiren, at the concentration\nof 10-5M, and only when SMCs were stimulated with\nprorenin but not in response to PDGF-BB. Thus, aliskiren\nappears to have a selective action on prorenin-induced\nSMC migration.\nFigure 3. Aliskiren does not affect human SMC migration\nin response to PDGF-BB. The experimental conditions are\nthe same as in Figure 2. The Boyden's chamber chemotactic\nassay was performed by using prorenin (10-8M) and PDGF-BB\nBB vs. basal; *p < 0.05 aliskiren vs. prorenin.

The results are representative of three independent experiments.\n288 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that Rac plays an\nimportant role on SMC migration, associated with the\ndevelopment of atherosclerotic plaque, either by inducing\nthe lamellipodia formation or by generating reactive oxy-\ngen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase.31,32 Our results\nsuggest that the inhibitory effect of aliskiren on Rac activ-\nity may be responsible for the reduction of SMC migra-\ntion mediated by prorenin. Indeed, we have previously\ndemonstrated that the inhibition of Rac by siRNA com-\npletely abrogated the chemotactic effect of prorenin on\nSMCs.16 Nevertheless, the actual inhibitory mechanism of\naction of aliskiren on Rac activity is still unknown and\nfurther investigations are required in order to determine if\naliskiren affects the post-translational modifications of\nRac, such as geranylgeranylation, or the GDP/GTP\nexchange processes. Indeed, previous studies have estab-\nlished the requirement of protein geranylgeranylation of\nthe CAAX motif of Rac and RhoA for their interaction\nwith the plasma membrane and with the GDP/GTP\nexchange proteins.33\u00ad36 In addition, it will be interesting to\ninvestigate the effect of aliskiren on Rac-mediated ROS\nformation and its contribution on the hypertension-\nassociated end-organ damage.37 On this matter it is impor-\ntant to mention that, recently, aliskiren has been reported\nto reduce vascular NADPH oxidase activity by 41.6% in\nthe aortic tissue of ApoE-deficient mice.38 This evidence\nfurther supports a potential inhibitory effect of aliskiren\non Rac.\nInterestingly, aliskiren does not reduce the intracellular\nlevels of RhoA-GTP in SMC stimulated with prorenin.\nThe differential action of aliskiren on Rac and RhoA\ncould be related to the effect of angiotensin I receptor\n(AT1R) and PRR on the two small GTPases. Indeed,\nwhile the PRR-mediated activation of both small GTPases\nhas only been recently observed by our group,16 the role\nof the AT1 receptor and angiotensin II in vascular SMCs\ntions, the addition of prorenin, in the presence of ANG,\ndetermines a significant increase of angiotensin II forma-\ntion,23 and thus the stimulation of both receptors, PRR and\nAT1R. Since aliskiren was shown to fully inhibit the con-\nversion of ANG to angiotensin I, and only partially\nFigure 4. Effect of aliskiren on lamellipodia formation in human SMCs.

The demonstration that aliskiren can accumu-\nlate in the arterial wall of the small cortical vessels in the\nkidney,22 suggests a possible inhibition of RAAS in the vas-\nculature and PRR expression in vascular SMCs. The rele-\nvance of our data are therefore reinforced by these\nobservations suggesting a possible in vivo pharmacological\naction of aliskiren on prorenin-mediated SMC migration.\nConclusions\nTaken together, in the present study, we have shown that\naliskiren inhibits prorenin-mediated SMC migration.\nAdditional studies are needed to determine the in vivo con-\ntribution of this pharmacological action in experimental\nmodels of cardiovascular diseases.31\nConflict of interest\nDr. Alberto Corsini has received fees for consulting and research\nfunding from Novartis Farma S.p.A. and Dr. Giuseppe Maiocchi\nis employee by Novartis Farma S.p.A.\nFunding\nThe present work was supported by a grant from Novartis Farma\nS.p.A., Origgio, Italy.\nReferences\n1.
