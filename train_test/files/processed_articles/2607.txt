The goal of this study was to assess CCM-\nrelated adverse events (AEs) among children after the withdrawal.\nMETHODS: Emergency department (ED) visits for CCM-related AEs\namong children 12 years of age were identified from a nationally\nrepresentative, stratified, probability sample of 63 US EDs, for the 14\nmonths before and after announcement of withdrawal.\nRESULTS: After withdrawal, the number and proportion of estimated\nED visits for CCM-related AEs involving children 2 years of age were\nless than one-half of those in the prewithdrawal period (1248 visits\ninterval [CI]: 25.9% to 5.0%]), whereas the overall number of esti-\nmated ED visits for CCM-related AEs for children 12 years of age\nestimated ED visits involved unsupervised ingestions (ie, children find-\ning and ingesting medications).\nCONCLUSIONS: ED visits for CCM-related AEs among children 2 years\nof age were substantially reduced after withdrawal of over-the-counter\ninfant CCMs. Further reductions likely will require packaging improve-\nments to reduce harm from unsupervised ingestions and continued\neducation about avoiding CCM use for young children. Monitoring of\nCCM-related harm should continue because recommendations were\nupdated in October 2008 to avoid the use of CCMs for children 4 years\nAUTHORS: Nadine Shehab, PharmD, MPH,a Melissa K.\nSchaefer, MD,a Scott R.

The NEISS-CADES\nproject is a collaboration of the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion (CDC), the FDA, and the US Con-\nsumer Product Safety Commission and\nwas described previously.12,13 In brief,\ntrained coders at each hospital review\nclinical records of ED visits to identify\nphysician-diagnosed AEs, report up to\n2 medications implicated in the AE, and\nrecord narrative descriptions of the in-\ncidents. Narrative descriptions are\ncoded by using the Medical Dictionary\nfor Regulatory Activities, an interna-\ntional terminology system used to an-\nalyze AE reports.\nSurveillance cases included any inci-\ndent ED visit by a patient 12 years of\nage because of a condition that was\nattributed to a medication (any pre-\nscription or OTC drug product, includ-\ning vitamins, herbal remedies/dietary\nsupplements, and vaccines) in the ED\nmedical record and that occurred in\nthe 14-month period before announce-\nment of the market withdrawal of\norally administered, OTC, infant CCMs\nferred to here as the prewithdrawal\nperiod) or in the 14-month period after\nannouncement of the withdrawal (Oc-\nreferred to here as the postwith-\ndrawal period). These periods were\nchosen because, at the time of this\nevaluation, weighted data enabling na-\ntional estimates were available only\ndefined as orally administered pre-\nscription or OTC products containing\ndecongestants, antitussive agents/ex-\npectorants, or decongestant, antihis-\ntamine, antitussive agent, and/or ex-\npectorant combinations.\nED visits were classified as attribut-\nable to \"unsupervised ingestions\"\nwhen cases involved children access-\ning medications without adult permis-\nsion or oversight and as \"supervised\nadministrations\" when medications\nwere given to children by caregivers.\nMedication errors were defined as any\nerrors made during the prescribing,\ndispensing, or administration of the\nmedication, as documented in the ED\nmedical record. ED visits were ex-\ncluded if they were attributed to drug\nabuse or harmful intent or if the AE\noccurred during the ED visit.\nEach selected NEISS-CADES case was\naccompanied by a sample weight\nbased on the inverse probability of se-\nlection, with adjustment for nonre-\nsponse rate and poststratification to\nadjust for the number of annual hospi-\ntal ED visits. National estimates of ED\nvisits and corresponding 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs) were calculated\nby using the Surveymeans procedure\nin SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to\naccount for weighting and complex\nsample design. National estimates\nbased on 20 cases were considered\nstatistically unstable and are not\nshown; therefore, some analyses are\ndescriptive and are based on the num-\nber of surveillance cases rather than\non national estimates. Estimates with\na coefficient of variation of 30% are\nindicated in the tables.\nTo compare patterns of ED visits for\nAEs between the prewithdrawal and\npostwithdrawal periods, we used the\nSurveymeans procedure to estimate\nselected proportions (eg, the propor-\ntions of CCM-related ED visits involving\nchildren 2 years of age) for the 2 pe-\nriods. The estimated proportions (and\nvariances) were then used to estimate\nbefore/after differences and accompa-\ndrawal and postwithdrawal periods\ndid not overlap, estimated proportions\nfor the respective periods were\ntreated as statistically independent.\nRESULTS\nNational Estimates\nIn the 14-month period after announce-\nment of the withdrawal of orally ad-\nministered, OTC CCMs for infants, the\nnumber and proportion of estimated\nED visits for CCM-related AEs involving\nchildren 2 years of age were less\nthan one-half of those in the prewith-\nwhereas the overall number of esti-\nARTICLES\nmated ED visits for CCM-related AEs for\nchildren 12 years of age remained\nboth time periods, most ED visits for\nCCM-related AEs involved children 2 to\n5 years of age, and boys accounted for\na nominally greater number of ED\nvisits.\nOverall, the type of ingestions most\ncommonly involved in ED visits for\nCCM-related AEs remained unchanged\npostwithdrawal (Table 1).

During both the prewithdrawal\nand postwithdrawal periods, among\ncases involving medication errors for\nwhich the product was identified ade-\nquately, implicated CCMs were exclu-\nsively liquid (13 of 13 cases in the pre-\nin the postwithdrawal period) and OTC\ntime, respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nThe use of CCMs for children remains\nan important concern in the medical\nand public health communities. In the\n14-month period after announcement\nof the withdrawal, the numbers and\nproportions of estimated ED visits for\nCCM-related AEs involving children 2\nyears of age were reduced by more\nthan one-half, compared with the 14-\nmonth period before the announce-\nment. Because of the relatively large\nnumbers of unsupervised ingestions\nof CCMs among children 2 to 5 years of\nage, however, the overall numbers of\nED visits for CCM-related AEs and the\ncontribution of CCMs to the total\nmedication-related ED visit burden re-\nmained unchanged for children 12\nyears of age. A recent study docu-\nmented a significant reduction in the\nmean annual rate of calls reported to\nUS poison control centers that in-\nvolved therapeutic errors with OTC\nCCMs among children 2 years of age\nin the 15 months after withdrawal, rel-\native to a 27-month prewithdrawal pe-\nriod. Because calls to poison control\ncenters are voluntary, however, an im-\npact of reporting bias on the findings\ncould not be excluded and the inci-\ndence of national exposures could not\nbe calculated.15 To our knowledge,\nours is the first report that, on the ba-\nsis of active surveillance, assessed\nthe changes in the national burden\nand scope among children of CCM-\nrelated AEs and AEs related to medi-\ncations potentially substituted for in-\nfant CCMs since the announcement\nof the withdrawal of orally adminis-\ntered OTC products marketed for in-\nfants. Although these safety data\ncannot be used in isolation to dictate\nclinical or regulatory actions, our\nfindings have important implications\nfor continued efforts to reduce the\nburden of harm resulting from these\nmedications.\nFirst, the finding of a substantial re-\nduction in estimated ED visits for CCM-\nrelated AEs among children 2 years\nof age after announcement of the mar-\nket withdrawal is especially important\nbecause, after the withdrawal, some\ncaregivers might have maintained be-\nlief in the overall safety and efficacy of\nthese products or might have been un-\naware of or misinterpreted warnings\nand either administered infant prod-\nucts still present in the home or sub-\nstituted products labeled for older\nchildren and adults.16\u00ad20 A related con-\ncern regarding the withdrawal of in-\nfant CCMs was that caregivers might\nhave sought other treatments to re-\nlieve cough and cold symptoms, which\nmight have resulted in inappropriate\nuse of some medications (eg, antibiot-\nics) or increased the burden of harm\nfrom others (eg, analgesics). In a sur-\natric offices, 27% of parents with\nchildren 2 years of age stated that\nthey were more likely to request an an-\ntibiotic from the doctor after market\nwithdrawal of infant CCMs.19 Although\nwe could not account directly for\nchanges in patterns of medication use,\nwe did not identify any significant\nchanges in the estimated numbers or\nproportions of ED visits for AEs result-\ning from supervised administrations\nof antibiotics or other medications\nthat might have been substituted for\ncough and cold relief for children 2\nyears of age. Overall, the finding of a\nreduction in ED visits for children 2\nyears of age is encouraging, but con-\ntinued education of clinicians and\ncaregivers and further monitoring\nlikely will be needed to ensure that the\nburden of CCM-related harm continues\nto decrease for young children, espe-\nTABLE 3 National Estimates of Medication-Related AEs Among Children 12 Years of Age Treated in EDs Before and After Voluntary Withdrawal of OTC\nPatient\nAge\nED Visits Before Voluntary Withdrawal ED Visits After Voluntary Withdrawal Difference in\nProportions\nNo. of\nCCM-Related\nVisits\nNo. of All\nMedication-Related\nVisits\nProportion of CCM-Related\nVisits Among All\nMedication-Related Visits, %\nNo. of\nCCM-Related\nVisits\nNo. of All\nMedication-Related\nVisits\nProportion of CCM-Related\nVisits Among All\nMedication-Related Visits, %\nEstimates were from the 2006\u00ad2008 NEISS-CADES project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CCMs refer to orally administered prescription or OTC drug products that contain\ndecongestant, antihistamine, antitussive, and/or expectorant combinations, as well as single-ingredient decongestants and antitussive agents/expectorants. All medications refer to\nprescription or OTC medications including vitamins, herbal preparations/dietary supplements, and vaccines.

To that end, we previously\nsuggested engineering innovations,\nincluding packaging improvements\ndesigned to minimize unsupervised\ningestions of liquid medications.31\nExamples of such innovations in-\nclude incorporation of adaptors on\nliquid medication bottles, so that the\nmedication could be accessed only\nwith a needleless syringe, or the use\nof bottle-neck flow restrictors that\nwould limit the amount of liquid that\ncould be ingested if an unsupervised\nchild gained access to the medication.\nOur findings are subject to a few im-\nportant limitations. First, surveillance\nthrough the NEISS-CADES project likely\nunderestimates the total burden of AEs\nresulting from CCMs because it does\nnot identify AEs resulting in calls to poi-\nson control centers, visits to outpa-\ntient physician offices, or deaths; how-\never, the ED is probably the best single\nsetting to identify serious AEs, because\nit is the location where children with\nserious symptoms most likely would\nbe brought for treatment. Second, the\nNEISS-CADES project relies on assess-\nment and documentation by ED physi-\ncians; therefore, it is more likely to\nidentify well-recognized AEs (eg, unsu-\npervised ingestions) and is less likely\nto identify AEs that are rare, previously\nunreported, or difficult to diagnose in\non the specific CCM formulation (ie, in-\nfant versus pediatric versus adult) im-\nplicated in the AE was not available in\nsome cases, which limited our ability\nto draw conclusions about specific\nproducts. Fourth, we cannot comment\non whether changes in the number of\nED visits differed according to race/\nethnicity, socioeconomic status, or\ncaregiver health literacy, because in-\nformation about these variables is lim-\nited or unavailable through the NEISS-\nCADES project. Fifth, although our\nfindings suggest that removal of infant\nproducts from the market likely con-\ntributed to the reduction of CCM-\nrelated morbidity among children 2\nyears of age, other factors, including\nwidespread attention in the media to\nthe issue of the safety and efficacy of\nCCMs, changes in provider attitudes\nand recommendations, and warn-\nings issued by the FDA, also might\nhave affected use of these medica-\ntions and ED visits for CCM-related\nAEs in this age group. Lastly, there\nmay be a seasonality component to\nCCM use, with less use of these prod-\nucts in the summer months and sub-\nsequently fewer ED visits for CCM-\nrelated AEs. Therefore, the selection\nof 14-month periods before and after\nthe announcement of market with-\nfavored higher estimates of the num-\nber of ED visits for the postwith-\ndrawal period, relative to the pre-\nwithdrawal period of the same\nduration, however, this further\nstrengthens the finding that ED visits\namong children 2 years of age\nwere reduced.\nFuture work will be needed to assess\nthe impact of more-recent labeling\nchanges to avoid the use of CCMs for\nevaluate whether, as attention to the\nissue of the safety and efficacy of CCM\nwanes, caregivers will return to ad-\nministering CCMs labeled for older\nARTICLES\nchildren and adults to infants. Al-\nthough CCMs constitute a small pro-\nportion of all ED visits for AEs among\nchildren 12 years of age, the safety\nconcerns they have raised demon-\nstrate how public-private collaborative\nefforts and a combination of educa-\ntion, engineering, and enforcement\nstrategies can be used to improve\nmedication safety in the outpatient\nsetting.\n"
