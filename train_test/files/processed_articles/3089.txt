In some cases they revolve around nearly bankrupt\npension or social security systems, or about families physically\nand economically overburdened with responsibilities of simul-\ntaneously caring for very young children and the very old. In\nothers, they point to societies overloaded with unsatisfied\nhealth care demands of the chronically ill, functionally disabled,\nand the mentally and physically impaired. In yet others, refer-\nences to ageing evoke rumblings about stagnant economies,\nsluggish increases in productivity, heavy taxation burdens,\nconservative ideologies, and dismal mobility prospects for\nyounger generations. As is plain from reviews of the process in\ngeneral,1\u00ad15 each and every one of these issues, sharing a neg-\native connotation, corresponds to a dimension of the ageing\nprocess. In this paper we consider only two dimensions: demo-\ngraphic profile and health status. The demographic dimension\nconsists of conditions related to the relative size, rate of growth,\nand composition of the elderly population. The health dimension\nis a function of conditions that influence current and pros-\npective health status of the elderly population and their demand\nfor and actual use of health care.\nDemographic dimension: dynamic\ncharacteristics of the ageing process\nThe demographic momentum of ageing in the region is rooted\nin patterns of population growth experienced over the last\n50 years or so. These patterns have led to continuous increases\nin the rate of increase of the elderly population (aged 60+), to\nsignificant shifts in other indicators of ageing, such as the mean\nages of the population and, finally, to increases in the overall\nspeed of ageing in the region. This process is mainly attributable\nto the sharp mortality declines experienced after 1940.\nAlthough future trends fuelling ageing could conceivably\nexperience reversals due to sudden changes in vital events, the\nmost likely scenario is one where ageing will be reinforced as\nfertility plummets toward lower levels in an irreversible process.\nThus, ageing in the region is driven by two forces: one is un-\nchangeable for it is the result of past demographic history,\nand the other is unlikely to be malleable since it is the outcome\nof large macro processes with a powerful momentum of their\nown.\nIndicators of ageing\nAlthough there are other useful alternatives, we chose to focus\non three indicators of ageing, the proportion of the population\nabove age 60, C(t), the mean age of the population, A(t), and\nan indicator of the availability of support among the younger\ngenerations, L(t). The first indicator is a conventional measure\nand needs little introduction. The second is also straightforward,\nalbeit much less used, but of extreme utility in understanding\npatterns of growth of the elderly. The third, L(t), defined as\na ratio of adult to elderly population is a crude indicator of\nkin availability and of constraints in the patterns of elderly\nresidential arrangements. Although these indicators are loosely\ninterrelated, the relation weakens when populations depart\nfrom stable equilibrium. Altogether, these indicators suffice to\ncharacterize the demographic nature of the growth of elderly\npeople.\nDemographic regimes and indicators\nof ageing\nPopulations with sustained high levels of fertility will have lower\nvalues in C(t) and A(t) but higher values in L(t) than populations\nwith lower fertility levels. This is because in high fertility popu-\nlations more recent cohorts are larger than the preceding ones,\nthus biasing the age distribution toward younger ages. Higher fer-\ntility levels imply both larger disparities in the size of successive\ncohorts and stronger biases toward a younger age distribution.\nMortality has an ambiguous effect on all indicators. In\nsocieties with high mortality levels, an improvement in survival\nconditions leads to lower values of C(t) and A(t) and is some-\nwhat neutral for L(t) because those who benefit most from the\nimprovements tend to be infants and young children, and much\nless so adults and the elderly. In these societies lowering mortality\nlevels has the same effect as does an increase in fertility, namely,\nit inflates the relative size of the cohorts who are younger than\n5 years. However, in societies with lower levels of mortality,\nimprovements in survival tend to benefit more adults and elderly\npeople, thus tilting the age distribution in the other direction.\nAs a result, if we compare two societies with similar levels\nof fertility but different levels of mortality, the one with a lower\nlevel of mortality will have higher values of C(t) and A(t) and\nlower values of L(t) than the society with higher mortality if and\nwhen mortality levels are relatively high at the outset. When lower\nlevels of mortality prevail the contrast between one and the\nother society will be reversed, and the one with lower mortality\nwill experience higher values in C(t) and A(t) and lower values\nin L(t).16 As a consequence of these relations, the association\nbetween all three indicators in populations with similar regimes\nof mortality and fertility is tight. Indeed, in this comparative\n\u00a9 International Epidemiological Association 2002 Printed in Great Britain\nDemographic and health conditions of ageing\nin Latin America and the Caribbean\nAlberto Palloni,a Guido Pinto-Aguirrea and Martha Pelaezb\na Center for Demography and Ecology, University of Wisconsin, 1180\npaho.org\nb Pan American Health Organization.\nstatic framework, knowledge of more than one indicator provides\nredundant information. However, in societies with de-stabilized\ndemographic regimes where fertility or mortality or both have\nbeen changing rapidly, the relation between indicators will not\nalways be as tidy and close, and examination of each of them\nmerits separate attention.\nNo country in the region belongs to a stabilized population\nform. The actual regimes of de-stabilization are quite hetero-\ngeneous but admit a rather simple, though coarse, character-\nization.17,18 With a few exceptions (Argentina, Cuba, Puerto Rico,\nand Uruguay), countries in Latin America and the Caribbean\nwhen a precipitous decline began to spread in all but a handful\nof nations (mostly in Central America, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru\nand Ecuador). Unlike fertility, mortality began to decline prior\nto 1950, although the bulk of gains in survival took place during\nthe Post-World War II era. In Argentina, Cuba, Puerto Rico and\nUruguay, pre-transitional fertility levels were lower than in the\nthe age structures of all countries in the region reflect de-\nstabilized demographic regimes, mostly a combination of recent\nsharp fertility reductions and of less recent but equally sharp\nreductions in mortality.\nTable 1 contains estimates of A(t), C(t), and L(t) for 1950\u00ad\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe momentum of ageing in the region is evident in these\nTables as the empirical distributions for all the indicators\nconverge toward values associated with increased ageing.\nSimultaneously, there is an increase in regional variance due to\nheterogeneity in the timing of the mortality and fertility trans-\nitions in the region. While C(t) was below 10\u00ad12% everywhere\nCuba, Barbados, Puerto Rico and Uruguay have all surpassed\nfour countries will C(t) be contained below 12%. Elsewhere the\nfraction of the population above 60 will increase sharply and\napproach values similar to those reached by the US and Japan.\nA(t) is highly sensitive to the specific trajectory toward older\nage distributions. Whereas in 1950 most countries in the region\nhad values below 25 years, by 2020 all of them are expected to\nexceed 25 years, and most of them will attain values surpassing\naverage from 27.2 years to 33.3 years, a rate of increase of\nabout 22%. A comparison of trajectories of A(t) in the region\nwith those in northern Europe, US and Japan reveals that\ncountries in the region will experience higher rates of changes\nin A(t) than what would be expected given their absolute\nvalues of A(t).\nOver long periods of time--long enough to cancel out irregu-\nlarities due to transient phenomena--the rate of change in A(t)\nis an indicator of the speed of ageing inherent in a demographic\nC(t) R(t) L(t) A(t) C(t) R(t) L(t) A(t) C(t) R(t) L(t) A(t)\nSources: Calculations using the United Nations data base (1999).\nregime. In societies of the region where mortality and fertility\ndeclines are packed in a few years, the speed of ageing is much\nhigher than that in areas such as western Europe and North\nAmerica, where mortality and fertility decline took place more\ngradually over extended periods of time. The contrasts between\nthe speed of ageing in Latin America and the Caribbean, on the\none hand, and North America and western and northern\nEurope, on the other, are startling.19 Indeed, they imply that\nthe speed of ageing in the region will be at least twice as high as\nit was in other regions of the world for most of the time it takes\nto complete the passage from a youthful to an older society. The\nmain implication of this regularity is that the transition toward\nolder societies in countries of the region gathers speed when\ntheir age distributions are still relatively young.\nFinally, L(t) is a telling indicator for it reflects the availability\nof members of younger generations to elderly people. In many\nsocieties the residential arrangements of the elderly and the\nquality and quantity of transfers toward the elderly are strongly\ninfluenced by the magnitude of L(t). During the period 1950\u00ad\n2020 the median value of L(t) in the region drops from about\n4.8 to 3.1 while its variance increases, reflecting inter-country\ndifferentials in the timing of the transition toward an older\npopulation. Barring reversals of fertility trends, the value of L(t)\nwill continue its steep decline and will approach rapidly levels\nclose to 1.5 or less.\nAs in the case of other indicators of ageing, relatively large\nchanges in L(t) are packed into a very short period of time.19\nIn north-western Europe and North America the transition\ntowards an older population involves changes from values not\nexceeding 3.5 to values around 1.5. Instead, countries of the\nregion experience far more massive changes, as the reduction in\nthe absolute value of L(t) is almost twice as large, from values\naround 5.5\u00ad6.0 to about 2.5. Second, if future trends conform\nto projections, the change from levels of L(t) of about 3 to values\naround 1.5 will occur over a period of time that is nearly half\nas long as the period of time within which the same transition\ntook place in North America and north-western Europe. The\ndifferences are striking, and suggest that the impact of ageing\nin the region will be felt much more suddenly than ever\nbefore.\nRate of growth of the elderly population\nin the region\nAs in the case of total populations, an important characteristic\nof the elderly population above age 60 is its rate of increase, R(t).\nTable 2 displays values of R(t) for the same periods reviewed\nbefore. To have a sense of magnitude, note that with a constant\nrate increase of 0.020, the doubling time of a population is\nof the order of 35 years, whereas a rate of increase of 0.040\nproduces a doubling time about half as long. Accordingly, the\nregion will, on average, experience at least one doubling\nand, in more than half of the cases, a trebling before the year\nSource: All figures calculated using the United Nations data base (1999).\n2025. Two regularities associated with these patterns are\nimportant:\nRelative growth of the older population\nThe social and economic dimensions of the ageing process also\ndepend on the dynamics of the population younger than 60:\nif this population grows as fast or faster than the population at\nolder ages then some issues, such as support of the elderly, may\nbe less pressing even though the absolute growth of the elderly\npopulation has problematic consequences of its own. In this\nview what matters is the relative growth of the two segments of\nthe population: to the extent that and for as long as the popu-\nlation aged 60+ grows faster than the population below age 60,\nthere will be ageing. Upward pressure on the fraction of the\npopulation aged 60+ will depend on R(t) and on the rate of\nincrease of the younger population. Note that increases in the\nfraction of the population aged 60+, C(t), will proceed at a faster\npace the larger the differences between these rates of increase\nare, and the longer the regime is maintained. A similar set of\nfactors account for the decrease in the value of L(t).\nSince in all likelihood fertility in the region will continue to\nfall toward very low values and mortality will also maintain\na downward though decelerating course,20 we will observe\nsteadily declining values of the overall rate of growth. Instead,\ndue to factors examined below, the values of R(t) will continue\nto increase. The consequence of these two reinforcing trends\nwill be large increases in C(t) and large decreases in L(t). Table 2\nshows that, with a few exceptions, the rates of increase of the\npopulation 60+ during the more recent periods are higher than\nthe rate of increase of the total population. Furthermore, the\ndifferences between rates of increase for the population above\nage 60 and for the total population increase regularly during\nthe period of time examined. Once again, this shows that the\nseeds of rapid ageing in the region have been present, though\nunnoticed, for quite a long time.\nTrajectory of the rate of increase of the older\npopulation, R(t)\nThe rate of increase of the elderly population is a function of\nthree characteristics: (1) changes in past birth rates, (2) changes\nin past mortality from age 0 until age 60 and (3) changes in\nmortality above age 60. Since this has important implications\nfor the prospective health status of the elderly in the region\nwe show that current and future growth among elderly is due\nto past mortality declines in the age group 0 to 60, not in the\nimprovement of mortality for elderly people (aged 60).\nThe characterization of past demographic trends in the region\nsuggested above and the most important factors determining\nR(t) just outlined lead to two consequences. First, the popu-\n2025 belong to birth cohorts inflated by a mild surge of fertility\ngroup 60+ will increase in part because of these transient spikes\nin fertility levels. Second, and most importantly, these same\ncohorts were the beneficiaries of unusually large improvements\nin survival, particularly during early childhood. For example,\nindividuals born in 1960 experienced lower levels of early child\nmortality than those born in 1955. This increases the size of the\ncohort attaining age 60 in 2025 relative to the size of cohorts\nThe key inference from these findings runs counter to popu-\nlar beliefs: it is that the growth of current and future elderly\npopulation is mostly a function of past developments in mortal-\nity (and less so in fertility), and depends to a much lesser extent\non mortality conditions at older ages.\nTo assess the magnitude of each of these factors we chose\nthree countries that roughly approximate the diversity of experi-\nences with mortality decline in the region. For each one of them\nwe estimate the profile of mortality decline over the period\nestimate the (absolute) magnitude of the contribution of\nmortality changes to the rate of increase of the population in\nseveral quinquennial age groups, starting with the age group\nFigure 1 displays the estimated magnitude of these changes\nthree countries. We also include estimates for the US for com-\nparison purposes. The vertical axis in each figure represents the\ntotal cumulated change of mortality rates (per 1000) experienced\nby cohorts reaching ages noted on the horizontal axis during\nthe year 2020. For example, compared to those who will be in\nthe preceding age group in 2020, Chileans who will be in the\nrate of reduction in mortality rates between birth and age 60\nthe rate of decrease is approximately 0.028. Since the bulk of\nmortality decline, particularly during early childhood, occurred\nduring the post-World War II years, the peak of the graphs is\nattained by cohorts born during those years (who will be aged\nmortality changes, but since they are not the beneficiaries of\nthe typically larger gains accruing to early childhood, the mag-\nnitudes of the quantities are smaller. The estimates in the graph\nsuggest that improvements in mortality between 0 and 60\naccount for about 43% of the total rate of increase of the\nChilean population 60+ in the year 2020. In Mexico, the corres-\nponding values are slightly lower. The remainder is accounted\nfor by increases in the birth rate and, much less so, by improve-\nments in mortality at older ages. The graph also makes evident\nthat the contribution of mortality changes to the growth of\nthese cohorts is lower in Uruguay than in either Chile or Mexico,\nas it should be given the earlier and more gradual nature of\nchanges there.\nEstimates for other countries in the region look very similar\nto those in Figure 1. The only difference is that in cases where\nthe onset of the secular mortality decline is later than in Chile\nor Mexico, the curves are displaced toward the left, with peaks\noccurring among the younger cohorts.\nA paradoxical implication: health status of\nelderly is a function of past mortality regimes\nThe most important inference from this review is the following:\na substantial fraction of future increases in R(t) and, therefore, of the\nageing reflected in changes in C(t), L(t), and A(t), is attributable to\nmore, as shown elsewhere,21 about 70% of this change is due\nto changes in mortality associated with infectious diseases in the\nfirst 10 years of life. This is a revealing statistic: it suggests that\nthe relatively compressed schedule of ageing in the region can,\nin part at least, be traced to the medical and public health\nrevolution that triggered the mortality decline nearly half a\ncentury ago.\nWhy should this feature of the growth of the elderly popu-\nlation be relevant? In what ways does it entail a legacy of the\npast with implications for the future health and disability status\nof the elderly? First, massive improvements in survival, particu-\nlarly those concentrated within a few years after birth, are likely\nto induce important changes in the mean and variance of the\nfrailty distribution of the elderly population. It is well-known\nthat this fact alone could account for increases in the preva-\nlence of morbid conditions as well as for slower improvements\nin mortality at older ages than would otherwise be the\nSecond, a surging line of research is finding increasingly\ncredible evidence that exposure to and contracting illnesses or\ndeleterious conditions early in life may have enduring physio-\nlogical effects that could play out and have a strong influence in\nadult life.24\u00ad26 From the foregoing considerations we know that\ncohorts of elderly people who will reach 60 after the year 2000\nare those who experienced the full benefits of the deployment\nof novel medical technology introduced during the post-World\nWar II period. Their survival gains are less the outcome of\nquantum leaps in standards of living and more the result of\nsuccessful reduction of exposure, better treatment, and speedier\nrecoveries.27,28 Might this combination of events enhance the\nexpression of negative effects of early exposure to deleterious\nconditions and manifest itself in higher prevalence of later life\nillnesses and disability? In other words, could it be that those\n`saved' by innovative technologies bear the imprint of a clash\nwith early childhood illnesses that we would have never seen\nhad the new technology not been in place?\nThese considerations lead to the following conjecture: elderly\nhealth status and functional limitations among the elderly in\nLatin America--particularly among the cohorts reaching ages\ntions of health status than those observed among elderly in\nother places, even when relevant disparities in socioeconomic\nconditions are controlled for. If this proves to be true--and we\nshow some evidence below that appears to confirm it--then the\nageing process in the region is characterized not just by unpre-\ncedented speed and size, but also by large potential demand for\nhealth services.\nMortality and health status of the elderly\nOne of the root causes of population ageing may also influence\nthe composition by health status of the elderly. To the extent\nthat early life conditions have an impact in later life, we should\nexpect important changes in the distribution of the elderly\npopulation by disability and health status. Improvements in\nsurvival during early life were largely the result of medical\ninnovations and were not always accompanied by changes\nin standards of living. This may have altered the average\npropensity to experience later life illnesses and disability. A\npossible scenario is one where health and disability status\ndeteriorates progressively as the cohorts who experience the\nbulk of mortality decline approach older ages. Since this process\nhas different effects across social strata and rural-urban\nresidence, we should also expect that social class differentials\nin health status among the elderly will increase as ageing\nprogresses. This calls for careful evaluation and monitoring of\nthe progression of elderly health status and disability, as they\nwill exert disproportionate influence on demands for health\ncare services.\nAgeing societies face important dilemmas but none of them is\nas salient and consequential as those related to the health status\nof the elderly. In developed countries at least, health care\nexpenditures are by far the largest component of transfers\ntoward the elderly.29 The level of these expenditures and their\nprojected trajectory in the near future are of paramount\nsignificance for the adequate design of health policies and for\nrealistic appraisals of the strength and weaknesses of pension\nand welfare programmes.29,30 The actual magnitude of these\nexpenditures will be a function of several variables, some of\nwhich are simply beyond the control of policy makers. There is\nsome societal level of `desired welfare' or expected level of well-\nbeing that, to some extent at least, all policies must reflect. This\nis partially under the control of interest groups, and the private\nand public sector. Given a desired level of well-being, health\ncosts and health expenditures will depend on the health profile\nof the elderly and on the mix of technologies deployed to\nmaintain or improve health conditions. Of these two com-\nponents, the best known to us is the health status of the elderly.\nThe key factors affecting the health profile of the elderly are\nincidence and timing of onset of chronic illnesses and disability,\nmagnitude of rates of recovery, and levels of mortality.19 What\ndo we know about each of these in the region? What do we\nexpect about their trajectory in the near future, in light of\nthe influence of past exposure and past behaviour, possible\ninnovations in treatment, and new prevention strategies? Are\nthese countries experiencing a compression31 or expansion22,23\nof morbidity and mortality, or are they following some inter-\nMortality above age 60\nand compare favourably with estimates for Japan and the US.\nAlthough it is unclear if, and to what extent, estimates of\nE(60) are distorted by age-overstatement at older ages,34,35 the\ntime trends themselves (relative changes) are less likely to\nbe affected by errors. These trends imply that, barring future\nincreases in mortality, a newborn now will be expected to live\nthe corresponding number was almost 10 years. Thus, changes\nin mortality packed in the 50 or so years after World War II\ntranslate into 10 extra years of life to be lived above age 60. As\nthat the same pace of improvements will be maintained until\n2020. The main question is this: how healthy will these extra\nyears of life be? What kinds of health care costs are likely to be\nassociated with extra years of life to be lived above age 60?\nIf the elderly population is not only growing faster than ever\nbefore, but is also living longer than ever before, to what extent\nis the composite increase of person-years lived in old age\ndominated by person-years lived in good health? Some\nresearchers have argued that increases in life expectancy\nlead necessarily to increases in the proportion of time lived\nwith disability or ill-health.36,32 Others argue the opposite by\nshowing empirically that, in some countries at least, there has\nbeen a gradual but very noticeable improvement in morbidity\nand disability among the elderly37\u00ad39 or, alternatively, by point-\ning to the relativistic nature of notions of ill-health.40 The\nforegoing review of factors accounting for the rapid increase of\nthe elderly population in the region suggests a more pessimistic\nstance since, as we saw before, the new cohorts of elderly\npeople are likely to be more frail than average.\nAlthough a convincing answer to these questions requires\ninformation on trends in health status that are unavailable to\nus, we can proceed indirectly by using preliminary results from\na newly available data base on elderly people in the region.\nCurrent health status gauged via\nself-reported health status and Activities\nof Daily Living (ADL)/Instrumental\nActivities of Daily Living (IADL)\nA very recent source of information about health conditions\namong the elderly is the data collected as part of the project\nHealth, Well-Being and Ageing in Latin America and the Carib-\nbean (SABE). The project consists of a round of cross-sectional\nsurveys of representative samples of elderly populations living\nin seven large cities of the region (Buenos Aires [Argentina],\nBridgetown [Barbados], San Paulo [Brazil], Santiago [Chile],\nHavana [Cuba], Mexico City [Mexico], Montevideo [Uruguay]).\nviduals aged 60 and their surviving spouse.19 The survey elicited\ninformation on a number of dimensions regarding health and\nwell-being of the elderly. One of the modules included exten-\nsive questions on self-reported health status, self-reported chronic\nconditions, and functional limitations (ADL and IADL). From\nthis module we calculate two indicators of health status: distri-\nbution of self-reported health and distribution of ADL/IADL.\nSelf-reported health status\nTable 3 displays the percentage of the population aged 60+\nreporting their health in various categories in a continuum from\n`bad' to `very good'. Although we do not discuss age patterns,\npreliminary analyses reveal that they follow a `J-shaped' form\nwith sharp increases at the oldest ages of the fraction reporting\nthemselves in poor condition. The Table also includes com-\nparable percentages calculated from the Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS) and Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest\nOld (AHEAD), two of the most important data sources on\nthe elderly in the US. All estimates were calculated by gender\nand, for the US, by ethnic group. Several remarks are in order.\nFirst, to maximize comparability, we collapse the `very good'\nand `excellent' categories used in both the SABE studies and the\nHRS and AHEAD. The combined category is more comparable\nacross studies. We also assumed that the category `fair' used in\nAHEAD and HRS is comparable with the middle category used\nin SABE. Second, because in all countries the proportion report-\ning poor condition increases sharply after age 65 and the age\ndistribution in SABE countries is much younger than in the\nAHEAD study, comparisons of the unstandardized proportions\nself-reporting in ill-health will understate the US advantage\nover SABE countries. By contrast, since the age distribution of\nHRS is younger than in SABE countries, we would expect the\nopposite pattern to prevail.\nWhile self-reported health status is not an ideal indicator of\nhealth conditions, it has been shown to be a remarkably accurate\npredictor of subsequent ill-health and mortality.41\u00ad43 Three\nfeatures stand out in the Table. First, with the possible exception\nof Argentina, the fraction that reports being in the `poor' or\n`fair' categories is higher in countries of the regions than com-\nparable figures for the White population in the AHEAD and\nHRS studies. It should be remembered that the sample studied\nin AHEAD corresponds to an older age bracket (70+), whereas\nthose of the HRS correspond to a slightly younger age bracket\n(51\u00ad61). In the AHEAD the fraction of the White population\nreported to be in poor/fair health condition is 33.5% among\nmales and 34.0% among females. In Argentina, the country in\nthe region with the best distribution, the corresponding num-\nother countries the percentages are far worse than among the\nWhite populations both in HRS and AHEAD and, in some cases,\neven worse than the Black population in both US studies.\nSecond, the heterogeneity within the region is substantial\nand is only weakly correlated with mortality levels. In fact, the\nlowest percentage reported as being in poor or fair health con-\ndition occurs in Argentina while the highest occurs in Mexico.\nThe highest and lowest life expectancies are in Cuba and Brazil,\nrespectively.\nThird, there are very large gender disparities and they all\nfavour males. The differences can be as large as 12 percentage\npoints (in Uruguay) and as tenuous as 4 or 5 percentage points\n(in Chile). This is in contrast with findings in the US and other\ndeveloped countries where the male-female differences are muted\nor display the opposite pattern, namely, one whereby females\nreport themselves in better health conditions than males.44\nIf the observed gender differentials do indeed reflect latent\nill-health or limitations the patterns are ominous since elderly\nwomen are at higher risk of experiencing worse economic\nconditions than elderly males. The combination of worse health\nstatus and lower standards of living for elderly females does not\nbode well for countries where the gender disparity in survival\ncreates a large population of dependent elderly women.\nWhat to make of these figures? First, one could argue that, in\naddition to other problems, health self-reports may be contam-\ninated by (unknown) biases which, in the region of Latin\nAmerica at least, would exaggerate bad health. This may be true,\nand we need to await the results of further internal consistency\nchecks before passing definitive judgement on the validity of\nthe measures. However, in defence of self-reports as good valid\nindicators of health status, one must note that these countries\nrepresent a sample with substantial cultural heterogeneity--\nsome of these countries do not even share the same language\n--but that, if one excludes Argentina, the within-region homo-\ngeneity in self-reports is fairly high.\nSecond, a counter argument is that the figures in Table 3 do\nnot take into account socioeconomic status and that countries\nMales Females\nPoor Fair Good Very Good (Excellent) Poor Fair Good Very Good (Excellent)\na Health and Retirement Study.\nb Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old.\ndiffer in terms of the distribution of elderly individuals by social\nclass. However, if social class differentials are as expected, stand-\nardization for social class will increase rather than decrease the\nprevalence of those self-reporting poor health. Thus, the figures\nin Table 3 are probably erring on the optimistic side, i.e. they\nunderstate the prevalence of those reporting ill health in the\nSABE countries.\nFinally, without controls for relative socioeconomic status,\nthe comparison with the US may seem unjustified as observed\ndifferences could be entirely due to lower average standards of\nliving in countries of the region. But if this were so the empirical\nevidence would indeed support our main contention, namely,\nthat ageing in Latin America is occurring not only at faster\nspeed but with an unparalleled burden of ill-health.\nIn summary, although it remains to be confirmed, we believe\nthat these self-reports are not just ephemeral cultural constructs\nbut that they truly provide the first glimpse that something not\nquite expected is afoot among the elderly in Latin America.\nPrevalence of ADL and IADL\nTable 4 displays the proportion of the elderly with at least one\nADL or one IADL by gender and by broad age groups. Total\nprevalence of ADL and IADL reflect the same patterns as did\nthe figures for health self-reports: Argentina, Barbados and\nUruguay appear to be in a better position than the remaining\ncountries, particularly Chile (ADL), and Brazil and Chile (ADL\nand IADL). Similarly, the contrasts by gender are as accentuated\nas those observed for health self-reports because females appear\nto experience prevalence rates that are markedly higher than\nmales. The patterns by age show a clear and expected increase\nfor the oldest group (75+). Note that, with the single exception\nof Uruguay, more than a third of those 75+ experience at least\none IADL whereas the prevalence of ADL is slightly lower across\nthe board and lowest in Argentina, Barbados and Uruguay.\nAgainst just about any standard, these are very high levels of\nprevalence of ADL and IADL and point to needs that, in the\nchanging social and political contexts of these countries, may\nwell require practical solutions quite different from the\ntraditional ones.\nConclusion: fragile institutional contexts,\npoverty, inequality and accelerated ageing\nThe region is ageing `prematurely', the composition by health\nand disability status may take a turn for the worse and become\nunfavourable sooner rather than later, and family and kin\nnetworks are losing ground before societal mechanisms to effect\ninstitutional transfers are securely in place. An important\ndifference between countries of the region and more developed\ncountries is the relation between the speed and size of the\nmomentum towards ageing, on the one hand, and the social\nand economic contexts of the societies where the process is\ntaking place, on the other. The ageing process in developed\ncountries takes place long after they achieve high standards of\nliving, reduce social and economic inequalities, and implement\na number of mechanisms to offset the effects of residual inequal-\nities, at least in the area of access to health services. Social and\neconomic development in North America and northern and\nwestern Europe are already in place when the demands of an\nageing society (and even the concerns about it) are recognized.\nNo country in the region is blessed with a similar institutional\nhistory. Quite the contrary: in almost all cases a highly com-\npressed ageing process begins to take place in the midst of fragile\neconomies, rising poverty levels, expanding rather than con-\ntracting social and economic equalities, and contracting rather\nthan expanding access to collectively financed services and\nresources. Not long ago, the region was exposed to a drastic and\ncostly process of adjustment in response to a prolonged and\ndeep economic recession (`debt crisis`) that engulfed the\neconomies of virtually all countries. But this recession is only\nthe most visible part of a more entrenched, regular, and durable\nprocess of economic deterioration.\nIn a bleak overview of conditions in the region, Kliksberg45\npresents evidence suggesting that levels of poverty have\nincreased drastically since 1985 as have levels of economic in-\nequality; that unemployment rates have increased, particularly\namong the most youthful and poorest segment of the\npopulation; that deficits in budgets associated with public health\nhave ballooned and, finally, that the informal sector of the\nTable 4 Prevalence of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in seven Latin American Countriesa\nADL Males Females IADL Males Females\na Defined as proportions with 1 ADL or IADL.\neconomy has expanded considerably. These aggregate trends\ntranslate into strong effects at the individual level. In particular,\nmost subpopulations experience a sustained decreased in real\nincome, poorer access to health services and erosion of their\ncapacity to claim public sources for retirement and welfare.46,47\nBut the most vulnerable groups are the elderly and children and\nit is in these groups where we will see the bulk of deleterious\neffects.\nReferences\n1 United Nations. 1994 Demographic Yearbook.
