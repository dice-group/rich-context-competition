The extent to\nwhich older African Americans continue to receive less access to medical care as a result of economic inequalities,\ninstitutionalized forms of discrimination, and life-style factors remains a subject of policy debate. Empirical enquiry\nhas produced inconsistent results. The purpose of this study is to test the same set of models of medical use using\nidentically measured predictor variables in three nationally representative data sets of older Americans: 1984 Study\nof Aging (SOA); 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC); and the 1987 National Medical Care Expenditure\nSurvey (NMES). Multivariate logistic regression of use of physician and hospital services and Poisson regression of\namount of service use identified inconsistent results in race differences across data sets, but consistent results in\nterms of the importance of health status and insurance as predictors of use and amount of use. The findings suggest\nthat health status and financial resources may be more relevant areas for policy interventions than considerations\nrelated to race and ethnicity.\nACCESS to medical care involves a mixture of individ-\nL ual and professional decisions. Individuals enter the\nsystem through a visit to a physician, usually at their own\ndiscretion, whereas follow-up physician visits may be a\nfunction of the practice pattern of the provider (Andersen\nspective of individual choice, hospitalization remains a less\ndiscretionary activity, with access and amount being influ-\nenced by health professional assessments of severity and\ntype of illness. Inequitable access occurs when social struc-\nture and other enabling resources rather than health needs\ndetermine who gets medical care (Andersen, 1995; Ander-\nsen and Newman, 1973). Historically, there has been a\nlarge gap between African Americans and Whites in access\nto health care. The advent of Medicare and Medicaid for\nolder adults in the mid 1960s created a social context in\nwhich racial differences in use of medical services were\npotentially leveled out by access to medical care insurance\ngoal has been achieved in part as the differences between\nolder African Americans and Whites in access to medical\ncare have narrowed since the passage of Medicare and\nto which older African Americans continue to receive less\naccess to medical care as a result of economic inequalities,\ninstitutionalized forms of discrimination, and life-style fac-\ntors remains a subject of policy debate and empirical en-\nEmpirical comparisons of older African Americans' and\nWhites' use of health services have produced inconsistent\nresults. African Americans have been reported as making\nfewer physician visits (Gornick et al., 1996), more visits\n(Mutchler and Burr, 1991), or showing no difference in use\nthan comparable Whites (Wan, 1989). Studies of hospital\nuse show similar inconsistencies (Graves, 1990; Kominski\nconsistencies are due, in part, to differences in study de-\nsigns, measurement strategies, time frames, and samples.\nStudies at the community level or of specific medical con-\nditions are more likely to identify race differences in access\nand treatment than are national level data. Much of the em-\npirical evidence is characterized by definitional and mea-\nsurement ambiguity of race and service use and reliance on\nvarying sources of data at different levels of specificity of\ncare (see Wolinsky, 1994, for a detailed critique).\nResearch on race differences in use of services has not\nincorporated multiple data sets, multiple measures of health\nservice use, and multiple types of utilization using the same\nmodel. The purpose of this study is to test the same set of\nmodels of medical use using identically measured predictor\nvariables in three nationally representative data sets of\ntional Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC); and the 1987\nNational Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMES). This\napproach provides an opportunity to examine the extent to\nwhich indicators of health and social structure explain vari-\nations in service use by older African Americans and\nWhites using high-quality national data. We believe that\nthis investigation contributes to the inequity debate in two\nways: (1) By incorporating a range of health and social\nstructural factors that have been found to differ between\nAfrican Americans and Whites, we can determine the ex-\ntent to which race differences or similarities in access are\nrobust and consistent across discretionary use of physician\ncare and less discretionary use of hospitals; (2) By holding\nconstant the health and social structural independent vari-\nables across conceptually similar, but differentially mea-\nsured dependent variables of utilization and amount of use\nin nationally representative samples based on different sam-\npling frames, we will be able to identify possible contribu-\ntions of sampling bias on results. Conceptual replication of\nfindings across data sets leads to validation of the extent to\nwhich historical changes in the organization and financing\nof medical services have improved the ability of older\nAfrican Americans and Whites to gain access to care.\nConceptual Model\nOur conceptual model adapts the behavioral model re-\nsearch tradition of service use (Andersen and Newman,\nbased on indicators of health status and social structural in-\ndicators that represent predisposing and enabling variables.\nWe thus modify the usual tripartite division of predispos-\ning, enabling, and need in order to isolate the effect of race\nfrom health and other social structural variables.\nThere are two perspectives on the ways in which race\nmay influence medical service use. The interactive model\nstates that the effects of health and social structure on ser-\nvice use differ by race. The rationale for this model is based\non the assumption that race permeates all aspects of an in-\ndividual's life. In most studies, measurement of race is\nbased on the problematic assumption of homogeneity\nwithin race groups, i.e., the use of one dichotomous vari-\nable to serve as a marker variable representing alleged bio-\nlogical, cultural, social, and economic differences between\nAfrican American and White individuals (Hahn, 1992; La\nthis assumption, research efforts have begun to examine in-\nteraction effects between race and need, or race and socio-\neconomic status to capture intragroup heterogeneity and\ngreater sensitivity to health and socioeconomic characteris-\ntics among minority groups (Mutran and Ferraro, 1988;\nThe more typical use of the behavioral framework of ser-\nvice use is a mediating model that introduces variables to\ncontrol for (or explain) differences in medical service use be-\ntween older African Americans and Whites. This model as-\nsumes that the association between race and service use is in-\ndirect, mediated by health and social structural variables, and\nthat factors predicting service use operate in similar ways for\nAfrican Americans and Whites. Larger race differences may\nbe more likely to occur between African Americans and\nWhites in use of physicians as this is a more discretionary\nactivity -- subject to individual and cultural definitions of\nneed -- than is hospital use, which is governed more by\nprovider, insurance, and institutional factors. But the predic-\ntors of service use should not vary by race per se.\nEvidence exists to support both interpretations of race\nand service use for both types of medical care. Wan's\n(1989) review of studies based on the Andersen behavioral\nmodel identified no effect of race on physician contact or\nnumber of visits, and mixed effects of income and insur-\nance on access. Mutchler and Burr (1991), in an analysis of\nthe 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation,\nfound that African Americans made more visits to health\ncare professionals, net of socioeconomic status, but the as-\nsociation between heed, social characteristics, and number\nof visits was the same for African Americans and Whites.\nStudies of physician care for specific health conditions\n[e.g., chest pain (Strogatz, 1990) and glaucoma (Javitt et\nal., 1991)] show associations between race, poverty levels\nof income, and less use or undertreatment. The proclivity\nfor lower income African Americans to use emergency\nrooms as a source of alternative treatment to physician care\nhas also been documented (Neighbors, 1986; White-Means\nPatterned behaviors associated with health providers and\ninsurance reimbursement rather than demographic factors\nappear to drive use of hospital care more than use of physi-\ncian services (Stump, Johnson, and Wolinsky, 1995; Wil-\nson, Griffith, and Tedeschi, 1985; Wolinsky, Stump, and\nJohnson, 1995). Longer hospital stays have been associated\nwith low income, absence of a prepaid health care plan, no\nregular source of care, and area hospital bed supply (Wan,\nample of the complexity of findings: Mutchler and Burr\n(1991) report that their initial finding that African Ameri-\ncans had fewer hospital days disappeared when socioeco-\nnomic status was controlled; in separate analyses by race,\nhowever, lower income was associated with more hospital\ndays for African Americans, whereas higher income was\nassociated with more hospital days for Whites. Hospital and\ndisease-based studies at the community level document\nmany instances in which African Americans are disadvan-\ntaged in health care (e.g., Yergan et al., 1987). A compre-\nhensive examination of linked Medicare hospital and record\nclaims with median income by zip code found that African\nAmericans and lower income persons of all races received\nless preventive care and less optimal management of\nchronic diseases. The authors concluded that race was the\noverriding determinant of disparities in care (Gornick et al.,\n1996). Yet, according to hospital discharge surveys, race\ndifferences in hospital use are becoming smaller as length\nof stay declines steadily (Kominski and Witsberger, 1993;\nHealth status indicators of disease, self-reported health,\nand functional status mediate the effect of race on service\nuse by determining the need for care -- the biggest pre-\ndictor of service use, regardless of other predisposing and\nenabling variables (Wolinsky, 1994). By most measures, the\nhealth of older African Americans is poorer than that\nof older Whites across the range of acute and chronic ill-\nnesses (Andersen, Mullner, and Cornelius, 1989; Bacquet,\nhealth status among African Americans is found in mor-\ntality studies that confirm higher death rates for African\nAmericans than Whites for many diseases, e.g., heart dis-\nease, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases\ndence of the crossover effect in which African Americans\nover age 75 appear more advantaged in health and mortality\nPatrick, and Johnson, 1987) has now been seriously ques-\ntioned (Elmo and Preston, 1994). Thus, expectations of\nhealth service use must be viewed in the context\nof the strong evidence that, as a group, older African\nAmericans experience serious health disadvantages. These\ndifferences cannot be easily traced to measurement ambigu-\nities. Analysis of the structure of health status identified\nrace differences in measurement models of health, but not\nin the relationship between disease, disability, functional\nlimitations, and perceived health (Johnson and Wolinsky,\nA key interpretation for the differentials in health status\nbetween African Americans and Whites is socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) and inequitable distribution of social re-\nsources. Social structural factors mediate the effect of ser-\nvice use in two ways. First, lower SES is strongly associ-\nated with poorer health, mortality, and morbidity (for\nAfrican Americans compared to their White counterparts\nhave greater poverty, less educational attainment, and more\nvaried sources of income (Chen, 1991). Health differences\nbetween African Americans and Whites should thus be\nminimized when SES is controlled (Jackson, 1988; Markides\nand Mindel, 1987), but the evidence is equivocal. Some\nresearchers find that African Americans and Whites have\nsimilar levels of health once socioeconomic differences are\ntaken into account (Mutchler and Burr, 1991), whereas\nothers find differences remain even after controlling for\nSecondly, social structural factors influence access di-\nrectly through availability of insurance coverage and other\nfinancial resources that influence medical decision making\nof individuals and institutions. Medicare coverage alone is\nnot sufficient to promote effective patterns of use by all\nbeneficiaries. The use of deductibles and copayments under\nMedicare creates situations in which economic resources\nand private insurance coverage continue to be important in\naccessing and using medical care (Davis, 1991; Gornick et\nal., 1996). Although those at the lowest levels of income or\non welfare are Medicaid eligible, eligibility is limited and\nnot necessarily associated with good quality of care.\nIn sum, this review demonstrates that the relationships\nbetween race, socioeconomic status, and health service use\nare complex and reveal few clear patterns. Despite hints,\nhowever, of minimal race differences in access to medical\ncare in recent years, our knowledge remains limited by the\nmany variations and inconsistencies in study findings. By\nconceptually replicating the same model across three na-\ntional data sets, this research will isolate consistent findings\nabout the association between race, health, social structure,\nand service use from those dependent on sampling defini-\ntion and measurement strategies.\nMETHOD\nSamples\nSupplement on Aging (SOA). -- The SOA was a supple-\nment to the 1984 annual Health Interview Survey with a\ntelephone survey of community-dwelling individuals aged\n55 years or older. (See Fitti and Kovar, 1987, for details on\nthe sample design and procedures.) We selected those indi-\nviduals aged 70 and over from this sample that form the\nbaseline for the Longitudinal Study on Aging. We drew on\nthe parent Health Interview Survey for our measures of\nhealth self-report and income to minimize missing data and\nproxy reports. The SOA analytic subsample consisted of\nWhite (unweighted n = 6681) and African American (un-\nNational Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC). -- This sur-\nvey investigated the demographic characteristics, health and\nfunctioning, and patterns of assistance of a national sample\nof noninstitutionalized frail persons 65 years of age or\nolder. A random sample of approximately 36,000 persons\ndrawn from Medicare enrollment files was screened in\n1982 to identify persons with functional limitations, defined\nas the inability to perform at least one activity of personal\ncare (ADL) or management of daily affairs (IADL) for a\nperiod of 3 months or more. More than 6,400 persons were\nidentified and 95.3 percent were interviewed. This sample\nof the nondisabled-community residents identified in 1982\nscreened and interviewed in 1984. After excluding respon-\ndents under the age of 70, the NLTC analytic subsample\nconsisted of White (n = 3638) and African American (n =\n513) frail older persons. There was no significant difference\nby race in the exclusion of those aged 65 to 69 years. (See\ndetailed discussions of the 1984 survey methodology.)\nThe National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES). --\nThis survey was based on a national stratified area probabil-\nity design of households. The sample contained approxi-\nmately 36,000 individuals with oversampling of elderly,\npoor and near poor, African Americans and Hispanics, and\npersons with functional limitations. Four rounds of personal\nand telephone interviews occurred at 4-month intervals for\nthe study reference year of 1987. The NMES analytic sub-\nAfrican Americans aged 70 and over. There was no signifi-\ncant difference by race in the exclusion of those aged 65 to\ntailed discussions of NMES methodology.)\nAlthough the analytic subsamples are comparable in age\nrange and variable selection, other remaining sample differ-\nences should be kept in mind. First, we did not restrict the\nsamples to the definition of frailty (defined as 3 months\nlimitation or more) used in the NLTC because medical ser-\nvice use is a response to acute as well as chronic illness.\nSecond, we do not know how variations in sampling de-\nsigns (e.g., use of a Medicare list sample in NLTC versus\nhousehold-based samples in NMES and SOA) affect differ-\nences in sample composition. Finally, there is a 3-year dif-\nference between the data collection for the SOA and NLTC\nwas undergoing transitions during that period to a prospec-\ntive payment system on a state-by-state basis. The sample\ndifferences suggest alternative hypotheses for interpreting\ndifferences in study findings by data set. For example, we\nwould expect higher use of physician and hospital services\nby the chronically disabled population of NLTC and shorter\naverage lengths of stay among NMES respondents. Yet,\nthere is little prime facie evidence to suspect that the pat-\ntern of associations between race, health, social structure,\nand service use would vary by data set if we assume an\nequitable process of service use. The variations in data set\ndesign also increase the generalizability of consistent find-\nings across data sets.\nMeasures\nOur choice of measures was guided by selection of items\nwith established reliability and validity and by the compa-\nrability of measures across data sets. Thus, we compro-\nmised by excluding some variables that have occasionally\nbeen shown to influence use of medical services (e.g.,\nurban/rural residence) when there were not comparable\nmetrics. Preliminary analyses within each data set encom-\npassing a wider variety of predictor variables did not indi-\ncate any changes in our conclusions about the influence of\nrace on medical service utilization.\nTable 1 presents the list of variables. Most of the mea-\nsures are straightforward. All of the health variables, in-\ncluding self-reported health, were scored with higher values\nrepresenting poorer health. Family income, education, and\nself-health ratings had sufficient missing data to warrant\nimputation of missing data. The missing values for educa-\ntion (SOA, 1.8%; NLTC, 4.5%; NMES, 4%) were imputed\nto age- and race-specific means. Missing data for income\n(SOA, 17.8%; NLTC, 9.7%) were imputed to mean values\nby level of education and race. Missing cases of self-health\nratings (SOA, 0.7%; NLTC, 7.7%) were assigned the global\nmean value because of the relatively small proportion miss-\ning and the restricted range of measurement. Missing val-\nues in income and self-health ratings in NMES were im-\nputed prior to data tape release by either logical or hot-deck\nimputation. Like most health surveys, health status mea-\nsures gathered at the time of the interview may vary in time\nframe from measures of utilization that recall use in prior\nmonths.\nMeasurement of the dependent variables varied by data\nset in two ways: the definition of medical care and the time\nframe used for recall of service events. As shown in Table\n1, the definition of physician visits varied. SOA included\nseeing doctors in emergency room and hospital clinic visits\nin one item; NLTC specified a visit in a doctor's office; and\nNMES asked about seeing a medical doctor (site unspeci-\nfied). The time frame for recall of physician visits also\nvaried. SOA used the time frame of the previous 12\nmonths; NLTC asked about the previous month; and NMES\ncollected these data every 4 months over 1 year. Definitions\nTable 1.

NMES included hospital ad-\nmittance and discharge in the same day in addition to any\novernight stay in the hospital during the prior 4 months. We\naggregated the 4-month recall period for NMES to one year\nfor all medical use variables.\nProxy respondents were used in all data sets if the re-\nspondent was unable to respond. There were no significant\nrace differences in proxy rate. However, because NMES\nwas a household, rather than individual-based survey, the\nproxy rate was higher (approximately 34% compared to ap-\nproximately 20-25% in the other two surveys). Proxies\nwho were adult children or grandchildren may have been\nless aware of medical care use of the older respondent than\nspouse proxies, although efforts were made to verify re-\nports with medical bills during the in-person interview.\nComparison of Samples by Race Across\nand Within Data Sets\nAcross data sets. -- The SOA contained the smallest\nproportion of African American respondents, 7.6 percent,\ncompared to 12-13 percent in NLTC and NMES. The dis-\ntributions of gender, age, education, and region across the\ndata sets were similar (Table 2). There are slight differences\nby data set in other respondent characteristics. SOA and\nNMES represent more affluent respondents than NLTC, as\nevidenced by the greater proportions with higher incomes,\nprivate insurance, and lower percent Medicaid. Respon-\ndents in NMES were more likely to live alone than respon-\ndents in the other two surveys. Reflecting differences in se-\nlection criteria, respondents in NLTC were the least healthy\non all measures, with relatively little difference between\nthose in SOA and NMES.\nWithin data sets. -- Race differences in sociodemo-\ngraphic variables were similar to those noted in other stud-\nies. Given the accumulation of lifetime differentials in so-\ncial and economic resources, older Whites had more years\nof education, higher income, greater likelihood of private\ninsurance, and were more likely to live alone. African\nAmericans were more likely to use Medicaid and to live in\nthe South. African Americans reported slightly poorer\nphysical health than Whites within each data set, with\nsignificantly more ADL and IADL limitations, physical\nperformance limitations, and poorer self-health ratings.\nThus, on average, older African Americans exhibited over-\nall poorer health than older Whites within each data set, but\nseverity of health status differed across the data sets.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe analyzed physician and hospitalization utilization\nseparately. Utilization is represented by two variables: con-\ntact or use versus non-use (dichotomous) and amount of\nservice (continuous). Contact variables are analyzed using\nlogistic regression. Logistic regression estimates were ob-\ntained using SUDAAN software (Shah et al., 1991) in order\nto obtain unbiased estimates of standard errors in the face\nof the clustered samples found in all three data sets.\nThe counts of numbers of physician visits and days of\nhospitalization do not lend themselves to simple OLS re-\ngression because the distribution is badly skewed. Standard\nfixes for this problem (e.g., recoding extreme values or tak-\ning logs) have various disadvantages. A useful approach is\nbased on the Poisson regression model, or a variant of it\nknown as the negative binomial model (Greene, 1993,\nson model, the distribution of the dependent variable is as-\nsumed to follow a one-parameter Poisson distribution with\nvariance equal to the mean. The negative binomial model\nallows overdispersion in the data, i.e., a distribution with\nvariance greater than the mean. The overdispersion mea-\nsure, usually referred to as a \"scale parameter,\" is estimated\nfrom the data. Coefficients for a Poisson or negative bino-\nmial model provide estimates of the increment in the log of\nthe dependent variable for unit increment in each indepen-\ndent variable. Exponentiating the coefficients gives percent\nincrements in Y for unit changes in X (Greene, 1993). We\npresent the exponentiated coefficients for ease of interpreta-\ntion. Poisson regression coefficients, standard errors, and\nthe scale parameter are available from the first author on re-\nquest. SUDAAN does not yet contain a Poisson routine, so\nwe obtained the negative binomial estimates using the SAS\nGENMOD procedure. Standard errors from these results\nmust be interpreted with caution. Our experience to date\nsuggests that SUDAAN estimates of standard errors, com-\npared to a program assuming simple random sampling,\nshow only minor differences. We expect the same would be\ntrue for Poisson/negative binomial estimates.\nTable 2.

We tested the inter-\naction model in two ways. First, we entered all the interac-\ntion terms for a global test, as the final step in the hierarchi-\ncal model. We found no significant increase in chi-square\nwithin any of the data sets, concluding that there were no\ninteraction effects by race. The literature suggests that in-\nteractions between race and health, and race and socioeco-\nnomic status are most relevant to service use. We thus\ntested interaction terms containing each set of variables\nseparately, but once again found no effect. We thus con-\nclude that the determinants of medical service use do not\ndiffer by race. (Data are not shown; results may be re-\nquested from the first author.)\nMediating model analysis. -- We tested the mediating\nmodel of race, health, and social structure through a hierar-\nchical process and present the results from this analysis. We\nintroduced race alone to determine its global effect before\npartialing out compositional differences. Each model con-\ntained all the variables in the preceding model. The order of\nmodels was (1) Race; (2) Health: self-reported health sta-\ntus, ADL and IADL limitations, and physical performance\nlimitations; and (3) Socio-structural: gender, age, educa-\ntion, region, proxy respondent; income, private insurance,\nMedicaid, and living arrangement. If the race variable re-\nmained significant after entering the other model variables,\nwe concluded that other explanatory variables were needed\nto interpret how race affects use of services. Since this is\ncross-sectional data, any causal implications implied by this\norder are suggestive only.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence and Extent of Medical Utilization\nWe first present percentage use of medical services and\namount of use by race and data set (Table 3). Given the\ndocumented poorer health of African Americans, we would\nexpect that a higher proportion of African Americans than\nWhites would have a physician visit or a hospital stay. Yet,\nthis was not the case across data sets. Estimates of physi-\ncian contact showed no significant race difference in SOA\nor NLTC. There was lower use of physicians by African\nAmericans compared to Whites in NMES (75.3% com-\npared to 87.6%). A different pattern emerged in estimates\nof the mean number of physician visits by those who used a\nphysician. There were no race differences in mean number\nof visits in NLTC and NMES, but African Americans had\nalmost twice as many physician visits as Whites in SOA.\nWe suspect this occurred because emergency room visits\nwere included in the question wording. Because of the dif-\nference in recall time frame and definitional differences,\nmean values of use and amount of physician visits are not\ntruly comparable across surveys.\nNo significant race difference in any hospital stay oc-\ncurred in two of the three data sets (SOA and NMES). In\nNLTC, a greater proportion of Whites reported a hospital\nstay than African Americans. Between 20-35 percent of the\ntotal sample used hospitals in the preceding year, depend-\ning on the data set. The mean number of hospital inpatient\ndays were similar across data sets for those who reported an\novernight stay in the hospital (12-13.6 days), with no sig-\nnificant differences between African American and White\nolder persons.\nMultivariate Analysis of Physician Utilization\nPhysician contact. -- As noted, differential use of a\nphysician by race varied by data set (Table 4). Panel A pre-\nsents the odds ratio of race in each successive model. These\npatterns did not change after introducing controls for health\nstatus and social structural variables. In SOA, African\nAmericans were less likely to use a physician than Whites\nwhen just health status was taken into account, but this dif-\nference was removed when social structural factors were in-\ncluded in the model. Given the health differential between\nAfrican Americans and Whites, the interim finding suggests\nthe possibility of access differentials that are removed when\ncontrols for income, education, and insurance or Medicaid\nare taken into account. In NMES, there was a consistent\npattern of less use of physicians by older African Ameri-\ncans, even after introducing the control variables. As Panel\nB shows, financial enabling factors of insurance and Medi-\ncaid, and health factors of poor health rating and physical\nlimitations were the consistent predictors of physician con-\ntact.\nAmount of physician use. -- Table 5 presents the expo-\nnentiated Poisson regression coefficients of race and predic-\ntor variables and number of physician visits for all respon-\nTable 3.

Results were consistent within each data set, but dif-\nfer considerably in direction across data sets. In SOA,\nAfrican Americans had more physician visits than Whites\nby a factor of 1.5. NLTC showed no difference by race. In\nNMES, African Americans had significantly fewer physi-\ncian visits than Whites, although the amount of difference\nwas less than that in SOA. There were data set variations in\nthe effect of ADL and IADLs on physician visits. Number\nof ADL and IADL limitations were associated with number\nof physician visits only in SOA. Self-reported health and\ninsurance status remained consistent predictors across all\ndata sets. Those with poorer health and either a higher in-\ncome, private insurance, or Medicaid were likely to have\nmore physician visits. Self-reported poor health was the\nonly health predictor of number of visits in NLTC, where\nthere was a more restricted time period.\nMultivariate Analysis of Hospital Utilization\nHospital contact. -- Panel A of Table 6 presents the odds\nratio of race in each successive model of hospital utiliza-\ntion.

Within SOA and NLTC, financial and\ninsurance status remained significant predictors. Oddly,\nwithin NMES, only gender, poor health rating, and number\nof physical limitations were significant predictors of hos-\npital use.\nAmount of hospital use. -- Table 7 presents the exponen-\ntiated negative binomial regression coefficients for the pre-\ndictor variables of amount of hospitalization for all respon-\ndents. Controlling for health and sociodemographic and\nfinancial factors, there were no race differences in NMES\nor SOA and consistently fewer hospital days for African\nAmericans in NLTC (Panel A). Significant predictors of\nnumber of hospital days once again represent the primary\ncontributions of health status and financial factors in addi-\ntion to the pattern of race differences described previously\n(Panel B).\nDISCUSSION\nLike much of the literature, our comparative analysis of\nrace differences in use and amount of medical services in\nthree national surveys produced inconsistent results in\nterms of identifying access differentials in medical service\nuse. Results were more consistent in terms of the lack of\nexplanation of race effects by the health and social struc-\ntural factors. Because of the multiplicity of utilization vari-\nables and data sets, we include Table 8 as a summary of the\nfindings. The patterns suggest that African Americans are\nTable 7.

Our supposition that there\nwould be more race differences in use of discretionary\nphysician services than hospital services was not supported.\nNo race differences were identified in physician use in\ntwo of the data sets, but in NMES, older African Americans\nwere less likely to report use of physician services, even\nwhen taking health status and sociodemographics into ac-\ncount. The NLTC survey had the most restrictive sampling\nframe; the lack of a significant race difference suggests that\namong those with chronic functional limitations, older\nAfrican Americans and Whites have more equal access to\nphysician services. The larger number of doctor visits in\nSOA by African Americans suggests that African Ameri-\ncans use more varied health care settings as suggested by\nWhite-Means (1995), including emergency rooms and hos-\npital clinics. This interpretation may be indirectly con-\nfirmed by the fewer physician visits reported by African\nAmericans in NMES, where measurement of visits to doc-\ntors' offices was determined more precisely.\nInconsistent findings of race differences were also appar-\nent in the analyses of hospital use. Older African Americans\nwere less likely to have an overnight hospital stay than\nWhites, according to SOA and NLTC, with no significant\nrace difference in NMES. Once in the hospital, however,\nfew differences in length of stay occurred. Only NLTC re-\nported longer length of stays among White older persons\ncompared to their African American peers, controlling for\nsocioeconomic factors and health status. These findings\nsuggest possible restrictions to hospital access and care for\nAfrican Americans, although the source of these differen-\ntials could not be detected in this study.\nThese results suggest that the difference in sampling\nframes and time of data collection may have influenced dif-\nferences across data sets. The broader sample design of the\nSOA represented a relatively healthier group of older per-\nsons than did the NLTC. We cannot easily assess how the\nyear panel design of NMES affected results, but note that\nNMES results differed consistently from those in SOA and\nNLTC. The more careful measurement approach including\nvalidation of doctor and hospital visits by record checks\nand shorter time frame for recall may be contributing fac-\ntors (See Jobe et al., 1990, for discussion of optimal recall\ntime approaches). Differences in timing of the study inter-\nviews, especially the 3-year lag between the SOA and\nNLTC compared to NMES, may be important. Hospital use\ncontinued to decline drastically during this period as a re-\nsult of growing use of DRGs, although it is not clear why it\nmay have declined more for African Americans than for\nWhites.\nTable 8. Summary of Significant Differences in Service Use\nby African Americans Compared to Whites by Data Set\n\"All respondents (users and non-users) are included in analysis.\nPhysician contact n.s. n.s. Less\nNo. of physician visits More n.s. Less\nHospital contact Less Less n.s.\nNo. of hospital visits n.s. Less n.s.\nThis inconsistency in findings by data set makes it diffi-\ncult to interpret possible effects of time differences. Al-\nthough we believe we achieved comparability in the mea-\nsurement of the independent variables, we could not alter\nthe variations in exact wording of the dependent variable.\nThe difference between \"seeing or talking to a physician or\nassistant\" (SOA) versus \"receiving medical care in a physi-\ncian's office\" (NLTC) may have substantial effects not only\nupon estimates of prevalence, but also in interpretation by\nthe respondent. Yet, the greater consistency in wording of\nthe hospital use item, i.e., \"stay overnight in hospital,\" did\nnot lead to greater consistency in analytic results.\nWe did find consistent results in two ways. First, in no\ninstance did the introduction of controls for health or social\nstructural factors change the pattern of findings within each\ndata set. Second, other predictor variables, especially insur-\nance status and health status, consistently affected use of\nmedical services across the data sets.\nWe offer two possible interpretations for the lack of ex-\nplanation of race differences by health or social structure.\nFrom the perspective of cultural interpretations of race dif-\nferences, we were able to measure only a small subset of\nthe range of variables that the marker variable of race repre-\nsents. More detailed measures of familial and social experi-\nences with medical care providers, self-care practices, deci-\nsion-making styles, community attitudes to services, etc.\nare needed. For example, definitions of health emphasizing\npositive attitudes are more characteristic of older African\nAmericans than Whites, suggesting less inclination to seek\nmedical care for symptomatic reasons alone (Kaufman,\n1996). Clearly the cultural heterogeneity of older African\nAmericans and Whites needs to be captured in more subtle\nand specific ways and integrated into national health sur-\nveys.\nSecond, the relatively consistent contributions of health\nstatus, financial resources, and medical insurance to service\nuse suggest that in spite of the difference in sampling\nframes, individual, institutional and provider resources all\nplay crucial roles in medical service use. Provider and insti-\ntutional characteristics may be more important in medical\nservice use than in more discretionary service areas. A par-\nallel examination of these data sets examining race differ-\nences in use of community long-term care services found\nno differences in use between older African Americans and\nWhites of senior centers or home-based services in any data\nIn addition, institutional and provider factors may be\nmore important than individual choice. Pescosolido and\nKronenfeld (1995) argue cogently that models based on in-\ndividual rational choice models are limited. They suggest\nthat models of medical care should be community-based,\ninvolve dynamic examinations of sequences of use within\nand across episodes of illness, be multimethod and multi-\nlevel, and take into account the ways in which illness is\nembedded in social life. In this context, studies of the pro-\ncess of medical service use, (e.g., continuity of care, delay\nin help seeking, referral patterns, and provider attitudes)\nbecome important in defining the meaning of inequity of\naccess. Our findings that older African Americans use hos-\npitalization less than Whites despite health status differen-\ntials, but also seem to use certain types of physician ser-\nvices more often than Whites, reinforce the argument that\nfiner measures distinguishing health care settings and qual-\nity of services provided are urgently needed.\nThe limitation of individual rational choice models is\nalso seen in the relatively low levels of explained variance\nin these analyses and other research built on the behavioral\nance in use of medical services stems from unmeasured\nsources argues for inclusion of supply and policy variables\nin national surveys. Differences in availability of medical\nservices in predominately African American neighborhoods\ncompared to White areas, transportation patterns, cultural\ninterpretations of value of professional treatment, and per-\nceptions of adequacy and quality of local medical care are\nonly a small part of the relevant policy-related information\nnot gathered in current health surveys. Such variables are\nespecially relevant for studying race differences in access\nand utilization.\nThe effect of insurance status and health status on medi-\ncal services use was relatively consistent across data sets\nand type of use. These factors are amenable to policy inter-\nvention and to the experimentation in managed care and\nhealth system reforms currently under way. Variables such\nas region and living alone that were inconsistent predictors\nacross data sets may be less useful targets for policy inter-\nvention. The lack of significance of the interaction model,\nwhich suggested that inequalities and possible discrimina-\ntion have pervasive effects, supports an emphasis on policy\ninterventions that influence medical care access directly.\nThis study was not a test of the effects of Medicare. Our\nresults, however, suggest that access to medical care under\nMedicare guidelines has not been equalized for those in\npoorer health with fewer financial resources. Policy changes\nin health insurance, development of clinical guidelines for\ncare, and more recent health cost-containment measures\ncan directly influence access to care for all older persons,\nirrespective of race.\n"
