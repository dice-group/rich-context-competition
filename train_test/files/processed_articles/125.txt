The price effect results from the change in interest rates assuming\nthe balance sheet structure and size to be constant. By contrast, the quantity effect on\nthe balance sheet structure and size is due to banks' and depositors' behavioral adjust-\nments as a consequence of the interest rate change. In empirical data, we usually observe\nonly the combined effect, i.e. the addition of the price and the quantity effects. Using\nunique supervisory survey data on German small and medium-size banks, we are able to\ndisentangle the simulated price and quantity effects of net interest margin components\nfollowing a hypothetical 100 basis points downward shift in the yield curve. The data set\ncontains simulated data on net interest margin components for a forecast horizon of one\nyear, two, three, four and five years, which also allows us to analyse the time dimension\nof these effects.\nWe believe that distinguishing between the two effects is an important issue for three\nreasons: first, the time profiles of the two effects are expected to be different. Price ef-\nfects are likely to have an immediate impact whereas quantity effects can be assumed to\ngradually materialize due to behavioural and financial frictions. For instance, depositors\nexhibit behavioural rigidities and banks' portfolio decisions are subject to various regu-\nlatory constraints. When setting behavioural assumptions on the balance sheet structure\nand size in microprudential or macroprudential stress tests, the time profile of both effects\nplays a key role.\nSecond, from a financial stability perspective, it is crucial to know how banks react to\nshocks and adjust their balance sheets because this reaction can have considerable impact\non other financial intermediaries and on the real economy. From the microprudential\nperspective of a single bank, the balance sheet adjustments may be perfectly rational.\nHowever, if all banks react in the same way, then this behaviour may have unintended\nnegative externalities. For instance, as a consequence of considerable losses due to an\ninterest rate shock, a significant number of banks may shrink their balance sheets thereby\nreducing the credit supply to the real economy.\nThird, the impact of price changes on banks' income statements are often dealt with in\na symmetric manner: the effect of a price increase is assumed to equal \u00ad in absolute terms\n\u00ad the effect of a decrease in prices. This may be a good approximation if only the price\neffect is considered, but the quantity effect due to balance sheet adjustments is expected\nto work in the majority of cases in favour of the bank which leads to an asymmetry.\nOur contribution is threefold. First, our study is among the first that focuses on the\nquestion, under which setting a static or dynamic balance sheet assumption seems to\nbe justified in micro- and macroprudential stress testing exercises. Second, our study is\namong the few that deals with the separation of the price and quantity effects in the wake\nof a macroeconomic shock. This separation makes it possible to quantify the relative\nimportance of the price and quantity effects. Third, we are the first to have a time\ndimension at our disposal. Our results can help in gaining a general understanding of\nbalance sheet reactions which are mostly at the core of macroprudential stress testing\nexercises.\nOur supervisory survey data include forecasted net interest margin for the five years\nfollowing the base year 2014 under different scenarios. In addition, we have data concern-\ning the balance sheet composition of these banks in the base year 2014. Our results show\nthat, in the first year, the cross-sectional variation of the simulated price effect is nearly\neight times as large as the one of simulated quantity effect. After five years, however, the\nmagnitudes of these two effects are converging as the simulated price effect is just twice\nas large as the simulated quantity effect. We conclude that in interest rate stress tests\nwith a short forecast horizon a static balance sheet assumption might be justified, but\nnot for the medium term. In addition, it is theoretically motivated and empirically shown\nthat the simulated quantity effects are explained better by a bank's current balance sheet\ncomposition, the longer the forecast horizon. The opposite holds for banks' price effect.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give a short overview of the related\nliterature. In Section 3, we introduce empirical modeling. Section 4 elaborates on the\ndata we use and in Section 5, we give the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Literature\nThe contribution of our study to the existing literature is twofold: first, to the literature\non stress testing and second, to the literature on interest margins.\nWhen it comes to stress testing, our study can help to assess whether a static bal-\nance sheet assumption might be justified or a dynamic balance sheet assumption might\nbe necessary. The methodologies of the supervisory stress tests performed by the Bank\nof England, the European Banking Authority, the US Federal Reserve and the Bundes-\nbank/BaFin treat the balance sheet composition and size differently.\nThe Bank of England's annual stress test1 allows banks to account for changes in\nthe composition and size of their balance sheets (bottom-up stress test). Banks should\nexplicitly incorporate corporate plans of costs and business changes. In order to ensure\ncomparability of those changes, the methodology restricts these changes, for instance, by\ndemanding that lending should not exceed the current market share (see Bank of England\nIn the European Union, the European Banking Authority (EBA) ST 2016 is run\nunder the static balance sheet assumption in terms that maturing assets and liabilities\nare replaced with similar financial instruments (bottom-up stress test). The methodology\ndoes not allow for mitigating management actions, such as changes in the composition\nand size of the balance sheet. Instead, the impact of this assumption is considered in\nthe evaluation and application of the stress test results (see European Banking Authority\nThe US Federal Reserve applies a dynamic balance sheet approach (top-down and\nbottom-up) for the US Comprehensive Capital Analysis and review (CCAR) ST 2016\nmirroring the expected balance sheet development through the forecast horizon in line\nwith banks' corporate plans (see Federal Reserve System (2016)).\nThe Bundesbank/BaFin ST 2015 accounts for a static and dynamic balance sheet\n(bottom-up) under the negative interest rate scenario, respectively. The static balance\nsheet is used to ensure comparable results and to illustrate the counterfactual outcome\nwithout active management actions. The dynamic scenario is meant to account for ex-\n1The stress test aims to support both the macroprudential-related Financial Policy Committee (FPC)\nand microprudential-related Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in meeting their statutory objectives\nogenously and endogenously driven changes in the volume, resulting in changes in the\ncomposition and size of the balance sheet (see Bundesbank (2016)).\nConcerning the literature on banks' interest margins, we contribute to three strands;\nnamely, the composition of the interest rate pass-through, the time profile of the interest\nrate pass-through as well as the the level of interest rate margins against the backdrop of\nthe balance sheet composition\nFirst, our paper contributes to the literature on how banks react to a macroeconomic\nshock. Memmel and Schertler (2013) perform a separation of changes in the net interest\nmargin of German banks into a price effect and a quantity effect, where the quantity effect\nis due to balance sheet adjustments and can be seen as a measure of banks' behaviour.\nConcerning this aspect of their research, their study is closest to ours. Unlike them, we\ndo not use realized data from banks' financial statements, but rather banks' simulated\ndata on interest margins under different scenarios, where the distinction between price\nand quantity effects can be directly inferred. In addition, we have a time dimension of up\nto five years of the forecast horizon.\nMarket interest rates are an important macroeconomic factor, especially for banks,\nand many studies on banks' interest margins include the interest rate level as an explana-\ntory variable (see, for instance, Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, Oordt, and Swank (2012)).\nAlbertazzi and Gambacorta (2009) show that increasing long term market rates affect\ninterest income positively, while the opposite holds true for non-interest income. Busch\nand Memmel (2015) make the impact of the interest rate level a central question of their\npaper. Using a long time series of the German banking system, they show that a down-\nward shift in the term structure is at first beneficial for the banks' net interest margin,\nbut that this downward shift reduces the net interest margin in the medium and long\nterm. Using the time dimension of our survey data, we can see whether the short-term\neffect is qualitatively different from the medium and long-term effects. Furthermore, we\nare able to disentangle the influence of the balance sheet adjustment.\nSecond, our paper contributes to the empirical literature that examines the pass-\nthrough from market rates to bank rates (See, for instance, Kleimeier and Sander (2006),\nSchlueter, Busch, Hartmann-Wendels, and Sievers (2016) and Pangopoulos and Spiliotis\n(2015)). This pass-through is most often found to be incomplete, with differences re-\ngarding various product categories (see, for instance, De Graeve, De Jonghe, and Vennet\n(2007)). In such studies, the bank rates are often assumed to be a linear combination of\ntheir own past values and of past and present market rates. By contrast, in our survey\ndata, we can determine the pass-through directly and for different time horizons (up to\nfive years).\nThird, we contribute to the literature that explains the level of interest margins us-\ning banks-specific variables (see, for instance, Ho and Saunders (1981), Angbazo (1997),\nMaudos and de Guevara (2004), and Busch and Memmel (2016)). These studies find that\na bank's credit risk, its exposure to interest rate risk, its operating costs and its market\npower (among other things) determine the level of the interest margins. Some papers\nshow how business models influence interest margins. For example, Lepetit, Nys, Rous,\nand Tarazi (2008) and Busch and Kick (2015) find a negative relationship between the\ninterest rate margin and non-interest income and argue that banks react to decreasing\ninterest margins by diversifying into new activities. Our approach differs from these stud-\nies: We investigate how far a bank's current balance sheet composition can explain future\nchanges in the interest margins.\n3 Empirical Modelling\nIn the literature, banks' net interest margins are often explained by bank-specific variables.\nIn our paper, we do not explain the level of interest margins, but their changes due to an\ninterest rate shock. As bank-specific variables, we use banks' balance sheet compositions\nin the base year (here: in the year 2014). That means that we aim to explain the bank's\nsimulated price and quantity effects by its current balance sheet composition, using a\nstylized model.\nWe assume that the price effect ah\n, i.e. the effect on the net interest margin under\nthe assumption of a constant balance sheet, can be modelled in a basic setting:\nah\n) \u02c7 h\n) r + h\nwhere we assume that the asset-side of a bank consists of only two types of assets,\nnamely overnight interbank loans (portion: w0\n) and customer loans of longer maturity\n). h\ngives the share of customer loans which have matured in the period\nfrom 0 to time h, r is size of the interest shock and h\nis a noise term.\nEquation (1) gives the business that is affected by the shift in the yield curve (mul-\ntiplied by the shock size r): the interbank loans which have matured immediately in\naddition to those customer loans that have already matured (share: h\n).\nProposition 1: Given the model above, concerning the price effect ah\n, the explanatory\npower of the current balance sheet composition (here: w0\n) is falling with the length\nof the forecast horizon h.\nProof: From Equation (1), one can calculate the variance of the variable ah\nand its\ncovariance to the weight w0\n, where we assume that the stochastic comes from the weight\n(variance: 2\nw\n) and the noise term h\n(variance: 2\n\n), which we assume to be independent\nfrom the weight w0\n:\nvar (ah\nw\n\nand\ncov (ah\n) = r \u02c7 (1 - h\nw\nDefining the (positive) ratio \n\nw\n, we obtain as the coefficient of\ndetermination R2\na,h\n:= cov2 (ah\n) / (var(ah\nw\n) for the regression of the direct effect\nah\non the current weight w0\na,h\n=\nWith the help of some conversions, one sees that the derivative of R2\na,h\nwith respect\nto the horizon h is negative, proving the statement in Proposition 1.\nThe economic intuition behind the declining coefficient of determination R2\na,h\nis that,\nin the short run, the banks differ in terms of the extent to which the price effect of the\ninterest rate shock is passed-through, in the model above expressed by different weights\n. In the long run, however, the price effect a of the interest rate shock is similar across\nall banks because finally all positions are replaced by new business; in the model above,\nthis corresponds to limh\nh\n= 1. That is why the coefficient of determination R2\na,h\ndecreases with respect to the horizon h.\nThe quantity effect bh\n, i.e. the effect on the net interest margin due to balance sheet\nadjustments, can be modelled as follows in the model from above:\nbh\n= c \u02c7 (wh\n) + h\nwhere c is a constant and h\nis an error term that introduces some noise with variance\n\n.2 We assume that a bank cannot immediately reach the new optimal weight \u017b\nw, but\napproaches it following an autoregressive process of order 1, which can be motivated by\nadjustment costs (see Appendix 1), where 0 <  < 1:\nwh\n=  +  \u02c7 wh-1\nProposition 2: Given the model above, concerning the quantity effect bh\n, the explana-\ntory power of the current balance sheet composition (here: w0\n) is increasing with\nthe length of the forecast horizon h.\nProof: Using some conversions, one can express the weight wh\nas a function of the original\n:\nwh\n+  \u02c7\ncombining this expression with Equation (5), one can determine the variance of bh\nas\nvar (bh\nw\n\nand its covariance to the original weight w0\nas\ncov (bh\n) = -c \u02c7 2\nw\nAgain, defining the (positive) ratio \n\nw\n, we obtain for the coefficient of determi-\nb,h\nfor the regression of the quantity effect bh\non the original weight w0\n:\nb,h\n=\nWith the help of some conversions, one sees that the derivative of R2\nb,h\nwith respect to\nthe horizon h is positive, proving the statement in Proposition 2.\nConcerning the increasing coefficient of determination R2\nb,h\n, the intuition is that, due\nto adjustment costs and subsequent partial adjustments, the current balance sheet com-\nposition has all the more explanatory power, the longer the horizon h.\n2Again, the noise term h\nis assumed to be independent from the weight w0\n.\n4.1 Low-interest-rate survey\nThe empirical analyses are based on data from the supervisory survey \"Profitability and\nresilience of German credit institutions in the low-interest-rate setting 2015\", which in-\ncludes approximately 1,500 German small and medium-size universal banks directly su-\npervised by the Bundesbank and Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). This\nsurvey was conducted in 2015 to track how banks intend to tackle the prevailing challenges\nof the low-interest-rate environment until 2019. First, in a low-interest-rate environment,\nexpiring assets need to be replaced by lower remunerated assets. Second, history still\nshows that most deposit rates are de facto floored at zero by banks due to intense compe-\ntition and endeavoring not to lose customers to rivals. The floor means for banks that in\na continuing low-interest-rate environment deposit funding becomes more expensive than\nmarket funding. For banks with high deposit-funding, the combination of lower asset\nremuneration and de facto floored deposit rates yields to decreasing net interest margins\n(see Drescher, Ruprecht, Gruender, Papageorgiou, Tows, and Brinkmann (2016)).\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bundesbank and BaFin asked banks to populate the su-\npervisory survey, which contains a bank-specific planning scenario, four additional super-\nvisory interest rate stress test scenarios as well as separate credit and market risk stress\ntests. With regard to the interest rate stress test scenarios, banks had to simulate in a\nbottom-up approach manner the impact on their income statements and balance sheets.\nWe focus on the following three interest rate stress test scenarios. First, the supervisory\nlow-interest-rate environment scenario presumes interest rates will remain at levels as of\n31 December 2014. Each of the following supervisory interest rate scenarios assumes an\nabrupt and persistent change in the yield curve. Second and third, the two supervisory\nscenarios with a negative interest rate shock assume a sudden downward shift of the yield\none with a dynamic balance sheet. The assumption of a static balance sheet implies that\nmaturing business is being replaced by similar new business, i.e. matching in terms of\ncredit quality, asset and liability structure and total assets. This assumption is not made\nin the dynamic balance sheet scenario, where banks are allowed to adjust their balance\nsheets as a response of the shock. In the dynamic scenario, banks were allowed to take\ncountermeasures in terms of portfolio shifts.\nIn order to disentangle banks' simulated price and quantity effects for the negative\ninterest rate shock scenario in a meaningful way, we applied a thorough cleaning algorithm.\nFirst, we dropped those banks that provided missing data in at least one of the relevant\nscenarios. This cleaning is considered necessary to ensure a balanced panel for aggregating\nthe results. Second, we dropped those banks that used a static balance sheet structure\nor adapted the dynamic balance sheet structure of its planning scenario to the negative\ninterest rate shock scenario. This cleaning is considered necessary since the balance sheet\nstructure should deviate between different scenarios against the backdrop of endogenous\nand exogenous drivers. Third, we dropped all price and quantity effects for the net\ninterest margins below the first and above the 99th percentile. In the end, we obtain a\ndata set consisting of around 400 banks compared with around 1,500 that took part in\nthe survey. In what follows, the empirical results are derived from this restricted sample.\nAdditionally, we provide the results for the full sample in the robustness checks in Section\nFigure 1: Scenario-based net interest income simulations\nNet interest margin as a percentage of total assets\nexcludes outside values\nLow interest scenario\nwith static balance sheets\nexcludes outside values\nwith static balance sheets\nexcludes outside values\nwith dynamic balance sheets\nStarting from 2014, German small and medium-size banks provided Bundesbank and\nBaFin with simulations on net interest margin components over the next five years, until\n2019 (see Figure 1). In a persistent low-interest-rate environment scenario and static\nbalance sheet, the median bank simulates the net interest margin to go down to 1.53% of\ntotal assets. Assuming a 100 basis points downward shift of the yield curve, the median\nbank simulates the net interest margin to drop to 1.35% of total assets with a static\nbalance sheet respectively to 1.38% of total assets with a dynamic balance sheet. All\ndevelopments also apply beyond the median bank for different deciles.\nGiven these scenario designs, our study focuses on the low-interest-rate scenario (here:\nscenario k = 0, which we will use as our benchmark) and the two negative interest rate\nshock scenarios with a static (here: scenario k = 1) and dynamic balance sheet (here:\nscenario k = 2), respectively. We chose these three scenarios because they enable us to\ncarry out the separation of the simulated price and the quantity effects.3\nAs we normalise the net interest margin, interest income and expenses with total assets,\nit is worthwhile starting by also taking a look at how banks' total assets evolve in the\nnegative interest rate shock scenario. Given lower interest rate levels, the vast majority of\nbanks expects total assets to increase from 2014 to 2019 respectively, being higher in the\ndynamic balance sheets scenario compared to the static balance sheet scenario in 2019.\nFor instance, total assets of banks grouped in deciles are expected to increase between\n-7.0% and 4.8% (see Table 1). Contemporarily, banks expect costumer loans to increase\nrelative to costumer deposits. With respect to the banks grouped in deciles, these ratios\nare expected to grow from 0.9% to 6.6% (see Table 1). Nevertheless, most banks still\nexpect to have more costumer deposits than costumer loans (see Figure 3).\nIn Figure 2, we illustrate how the survey data are used for the analyses. For instance,\nif we assume that in the first year (h = 1) the bank i's interest income margin (IIM)\n3Please note that there is no mechanism to ensure that the individual responses of the banks add up\nto a macroeconomic equilibrium where aggregated supply meets aggregated demand.\nTable 1: Comparing balance sheet size and structure in 2019 in the negative interest rate\nshock scenarios under static and dynamic balance sheet assumptions\nDeciles static dynamic difference static dynamic difference\nstatic balance sheets and no change in interest rates, 280 bp in scenario k = 1 (with static\nbalance sheets and a negative interest rate shock) and 285 bp in scenario k = 2 (with\ndynamic balance sheets and a negative interest rate shock). In the first year, the price\neffect can be calculated as a1,i\nThe scenario k = 2 with dynamic balance sheets (allowing for adjustments in the\ncomposition and size) and a negative interest rate shock was not at the center of attention\nof the participating banks. The banks seemed to have put more effort in determining other\nscenarios, for instance the scenario where they used the parameters with which they are\nplanning for the future. To take into account the considerable reduction in observations,\nwe run a robustness check to determine whether the results qualitatively remain the same\nunder less severe cleaning.\n4.2 Balance sheet composition\nWe use each bank's balance sheet composition as of 31 December 2014 (base year) to\nevaluate its power of determination for the simulated price and quantity effects. The\nbanks' asset side is broken down into customer loans (three brackets concerning the loans'\ninitial maturity: up to one year, one to five years, and more than five years), interbank\nloans (four brackets) and bond holdings. Concerning the liabilities, we split them into\ndeposits from non-financials, savings deposits, interbank loans (four brackets: overnight,\nup to one year; more than one to two years, and more than two years) and issued bonds.\nThe weighted balance sheet composition of our restricted sample of banks can be seen in\nUsing the supervisory survey data (see Subsection 4.1), we investigate the banks' P&L\ncomponents that are directly related to interests rates, namely the net interest margin\n4For more information to the balance sheet positions, see Memmel and Schertler (2013).\nFigure 2: Scenarios\nIn this figure, the three survey scenarios that we use in our study are displayed as small circles, namely\nthe benchmark scenario k = 0 with static balance sheets and no interest rate shock, the scenario k = 1\nwith static balance sheets and a parallel interest rate shock of -100 bp and the scenario k = 2 with\ndynamic balance sheets and the parallel interest rate shock of -100bp. The price effect a and the total\neffect tot (relative to the benchmark) are shown as arrows with solid lines. The quantity effect b (which\nis calculated as the difference from the total effect and the price effect) is depicted as a dotted line.\nFigure 3: Stylized Balance Sheet\nClaims against banks\nClaims against\nnon-banks\nDebt against banks\nAsset side Liability side\nResidual assets\nDebt against\nnon-banks\nResidual liabilities\nh,i\n, the interest income IIk\nh,i\nand the interest expenses IEk\nh,i\n, where the index h =\n0, 1, 2, .., 5 denotes the forecast horizon (in years),5 the index i = 1, 2, ..., N the bank and\nthe index k = 0, 1, 2 the scenario.

One can think of an interest rate shock which makes the customers\nput more money in some bank product. To keep the balance sheet weights constant, the\nbank has to make this bank product less attractive by lowering the bank rate for this\nproduct. In the following, we neglect this kind of price effect.\nThe quantity effect b is defined as\nh,i\n:=\nh,i\nh,i\nwhere k = 2 denotes the scenario with the interest rate change and the dynamic\nbalance sheets.

Note that, in the survey, a (from scenario k = 1) and\ntot (from scenario k = 2) are given (from which b is calculated), and not \u00ad as Equation\n(14) suggests \u00ad a and b.\nCorrespondingly, Equations (12) to (14) can be defined for the interest income margin\n(p = IIM) and for the interest expense margin (p = IEM). To sum up, we look at three\ndimensions: first, the P&L components (p = NIM, IIM, IEM); second, the different\neffects (total effect tot, price effect a, quantity effect b) and, third, the time dimension\n(base year h = 0 and prognosis h = 1, 2, .., 5).\nIn the following, we assess the contribution of banks' simulated price and quantity\neffects, respectively, to the total effect by their respective shares of the total variation.\nTo some extent, one can think of these shares as R2s (coefficients of determinations) of\nregressions of the simulated total effect on the simulated price effect and quantity effect,\nrespectively.\nFinally, we calculate balance sheet weights wk\nh,i,j\n(see Subsection 4.2):\nwk\nh,i,j\n=\nAk\nh,i,j\nwhere the index j = 1, 2, ..., J denotes the balance sheet position and Ak\nh,i,j\ngives the\neuro amount of the respective balance sheet position.\n5 Empirical Results\n5.1 Descriptive Analysis\nIn this subsection, we present a descriptive analysis of the impact of a -100 basis points\ndrop in the yield curve on the banks' net interest margin and the respective income and\nexpense margins.\nIn Figures 4-6, the mean of the difference from the benchmark scenario is shown on\nthe left hand side. As said above, the scenarios are designed such that a decomposition of\nthe simulated total effect (tot) in the simulated price effect (a) and the simulated quantity\neffect due to balance sheet adjustments (b) is possible. All the effects are normalized by\nWe expect the price effect for interest income and interest expenses to be negative\nsince falling interest rates are passed through to bank interest rates. For Banks that are\nengaged in term transformation the interest rate pass-through should be faster for interest\nexpenses. In this case, the price effect for the net interest rate margin will be positive\nin the first months after the interest rate shock. However, the sign of the price effect\non the net interest margin is expected to change after certain time because the long-run\npass-through on the asset-side is usually larger than on the liability-side.\nIt seems very likely that the quantity effect is positive in all cases, since rationality\nrequires that a bank steers its investment and funding in an advantageous way. However,\nin practice banks are not able to fully steer their investment and funding sources. For\nexample, the amount of overnight deposits is mostly determined by the clients and, to\nsome extent, beyond the banks' control.\nThe total effect (tot) on the net interest margin (NIM) is positive for the first year,\nwhereas the price effect (a) is on average negative from the first year on. Busch and\nthat this critical horizon is about 1.5 years, which is in line with the simulated total effect\ntot, which corresponds to the actual observed accounting data.\nAlso, in general, the simulated effect b due to balance sheet adjustments works on\naverage in favor of the banks. This, however, is not the case for the interest expense\nmargin (IEM), where the mean value of the simulated quantity effect due to balance\nsheet adjustments (b) is in fact slightly negative.\nIn 2019, the simulated price effect (a) of the 100 bp decrease in the yield curve on\nthe interest income margin (IIM) is on average -49.1 bp. By contrast, banks' simulated\ntotal effect (tot) is on average -40.9 bp, meaning that the simulated quantity effect due\nto balance sheet adjustments (b) is sizable (8.2 bp on average). This serves as a good\nexample of the asymmetry mentioned above: Whereas the total effect is -40.9 bp (= -49.1\nbp + 8.2 bp) in the case of a downward shift in the term structure, it will presumably\nbe 57.3 bp (= 49.1 bp + 8.2 bp) in case of a corresponding upward shift in the term\nstructure.\nFigure 4: Effect on the NIM effect of a parallel downward shift (100 bp) of the term\nstructure\nFigure 5: Effect on the IIM effect of a parallel downward shift (100 bp) of the term\nstructure\nThe Figures 4-6 show on the right-hand side the variances of the net interest margin,\ninterest income margin and interest expense margin for the five year time horizon as\nFigure 6: Effect on the IEM effect of a parallel downward shift (100 bp) of the term\nstructure\ndifference from the benchmark. The corresponding tables next to the variances (figures\nwith square roots), also give the the cross-sectional standard deviation (figures without\nsquare roots). Both can also be used to compare the importance of the price effect relative\nto the quantity effect.\nNote that \u00ad in contrast to the mean \u00ad the standard deviation of the simulated total\neffect (tot) is not the sum of the standard deviations of the simulated price (a) and\nquantity effects (b). We present the standard deviation because its magnitude can be\nmore easily assessed than that of the variance. The standard deviation increases with\nthe forecast horizon. This holds true for all P&L components (NIM, IIM and IEM)\nand all effects (tot, a and b). Moreover, we also present the variances because we think\nthat the variance comparison is more meaningful since it corresponds to the ratio of the\ncoefficients of determination. In principle, this comparison could also be done by looking\nat the respective means. In good approximation, it is possible to sum up the variances\nbecause the covariance between the price effect and the quantity effect is rather small.7\nThe increase in the standard deviation is far more pronounced for the simulated quan-\ntity effect (b) than it is for the two other effects (tot and a). For instance, in 2015, the\nsimulated price effect (a) on the net interest margin (NIM), measured by the variances,\nis nearly eight times as large as the effect due to the balance sheet adjustment (b) (11.72\nvs. 4.22).8 This finding is line with Memmel and Schertler (2013) who find that \u00ad on a\nyearly horizon \u00ad the coefficient of determination for the price effect is more than three\ntimes that of the one for the quantity effect. In 2019, however, this ratio of the simulated\nprice effect (a) to the simulated quantity effect (b) is barely above two (21.42 vs. 14.22).\nThis indicates that in the short term primarily the simulated price effect is important and\nin the medium-term (and presumably in the long-run) both effects are important.\nTable 2 reports the share of improvements relative to the benchmark. For instance,\n7Using the identity as laid down in Equation (14), one obtains var(tot) = var(a)+var(b)+2cov(a, b).\nThe covariances are considerably small, so they are assumed to be zero. For instance, when the return\nof a stock is split up into the market component and an idiosyncratic component, the cross sectional\nmean of the idiosyncratic components should be close to zero. Moreover, no one would say that the\nidiosyncratic component of the shocks is (close to) zero. By contrast, looking at the second moments\n(standard deviation or variance), one obtains a meaningful comparison of the relative importance of the\nmarket and idiosyncratic components.\n8In terms of standard deviations, the effect is more than twice as strong.\nTable 2: Effect on the share of improvements of a parallel downward shift in the term\nstructure\nEffect Year\nShare of improvements (rel. to benchm.)\nNobs\nThis table shows the share (in per cent) of improvements relative to the benchmark (Scenario k=0). Two\nscenarios are compared: the scenario of a downward shift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario\nwith constant yield curve. The difference of three income components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM\nand IEM which denote the net interest margin, the interest income margin and the interest expense\nmargin, where the respective income components are divided by the total assets as of end 2014 (and not\nas of the respective year). The effects a and b denote the impact due to the price and the quantity effects\n(as defined in the Equations (12) and (13)), respectively; tot means the total effect, the sum of a and b\n(as defined in Equation (14)). *** , ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively,\nconcerning the hypothesis that the true share is 50%.\nin 2015, in 51.9% of the cases, the NIM is higher in the downward shift scenario than\nin the benchmark scenario of a constant term structure. Special attention should be paid\nto the simulated quantity effect b, the difference in the outcomes between the assumption\nof dynamic balance adjustment and constant balance sheets. If we assume that banks\noptimize their balance sheets, there must be an improvement \u00ad or at least no deterioration\n\u00ad in all cases, i.e. we expect 100 per cent in the respective columns. This is not the case,\nhowever. Even on the asset side, only round 85% of all cases lead to an improvement; in\nmore than 10% of the cases, the balance sheet adjustment leads to a deterioration in the\ninterest income margin (IIM). In case of the interest expense margin (IEM), the share is\njust above 50 per cent, meaning that the balance sheet adjustments lead to a deterioration\nnearly as often as to an improvement. It seems as though banks cannot solely optimize\ntheir balance sheet structure; instead, they are subject to exogenous factors as well. Such\nexogenous factors may be customers who want to deposit their money at banks that are\nreluctant or not allowed to turn their deposit rates negative.\nIn this section we analyse how the price, quantity, and total effects of the interest rate\nmargin are affected by bank size. We compare these effects for the 25% smallest and 25%\nlargest banks (measured by total assets). In general, we observe a similar pattern for both\nsize groups regarding the development of the price effect, quantity effect and the total\neffect, but with different absolute levels (Figure 7). While the total effect for the group\nof small banks is positive in the first two years, the total effect of large banks is negative.\nAlso regarding the price effect we observe more favourable values for small banks. For\nsmall banks the price effect is positive in the first year. We expect such an effect for\nbanks that are engaged in term transformation. In contrast, the average quantity effect is\nhigher for larger banks. In order to quantify the effects, we run a regression analysis for\na sample of banks covering the 25% smallest and the 25% largest banks. We regress each\neffect (the price effect, the quantity effect and the total effect) on a size dummy (D75),\nwhich takes the value 1 for banks belonging to the 25% largest banks. Furthermore, we\ninclude year dummies and interact the time dummies with the size dummy.\nThe results shown in Table 3 confirm that large banks are more strongly hit by the price\neffect. Nevertheless, we also see that large banks are better able to adjust their balance\nsheets. Furthermore, the time trend is negative for the price effect and the total effect.\nIt is positive for the quantity effect. However, the interaction dummies do not indicate\ndifferences between size groups becoming smaller through time. An explanation for the\ndifferences in the levels of the size groups with less competition for small banks and more\nflexible business models of large banks is that smaller banks usually operate in rather\nrural areas while larger banks are located in urban areas which are more competitive.\nTherefore, we expect smaller banks to react less competitively to market rate changes\nresulting in smaller changes in interest margins after an interest rate shock. However,\nlarge banks usually offer a broader product portfolio which enables them to adjust their\nbalance sheet composition more easily compared to small banks. In total, the price effect\ndominates the quantity effect leading to a less favourable development of the total effect\nfor large banks. The results qualitatively remain the same if we include the remaining\nbanks in the sample and let the size dummy taking the value 1 for the 50% largest banks.\nOnly for the regression of the quantity effect is the size dummy not statistically significant.\n5.3 Balance sheet composition\nIn our empirical analysis, we regress ap\nh,i\n, bp\nh,i\nand totp\nh,i\nwith p = NIM, IIM, IEM on the\nbank i's balance sheet composition in h = 0, i.e. on the weights w0\n, thereby obtaining\n45 (= 3 effects x 3 P&L-components x 5 years) R2 (coefficients of determination). These\nR2 are reported in Table 4. In Section 3, the stylized empirical model showed that the\ncoefficients of determination R2\na,h\nb,h\nshould fall for the price effect a (Proposition\n1) and increase for the quantity effect b (Proposition 2), with respect to the horizon h.\nIn fact, we find that the simulated price effect (variable a) shows a relationship to the\nbalance sheet weights of the base year (as of 31 December 2014) which becomes weaker\nas the forecast horizon h increases. This more or less holds true for all P&L components.\nWhat is more, we find the opposite result for the simulated quantity effect (variable b).\nThe explanatory power of the balance sheet weights (of the year 2014) tends to become\nstronger with the length of the forecast horizon h. For instance, whereas the 2014 balance\nTable 3: Effect of bank size on price effect, quantity effect, and total effect\nVariable Price effect NIM Quantity effect NIM Total effect NIM\nThis table shows the effect of bank size on price effect, quantity effect, and total effect. This specification\nincorporates the 25th and the 75th Percentile of banks measured by total assets.

The\nand the size dummy. *** , ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively, concerning\nthe hypothesis that the true share is 50%.\nFigure 7: Effect on the NIM effect of a parallel downward shift (100 bp) of the term\nstructure: 75% vs 25% percentile of total assets\nin basis points\nMean of Change in Net Interest Margin\nquantity effect 25th percentile quantity effect 75th percentile\ntotal 25 th percentile total 75th percentil\nprice effect 25th percentile price effect 75th percentile\nsheet weights explain only 2.8% of the simulated quantity effect on the interest income\nWe compare the R2 among each other to see whether there is a statistically significant\ndynamic as predicted by the model above. In Table 5, we show that, in the case of\nthe simulated price effect a, the coefficients of determination in the first year of the\nforecast horizon are in some cases significantly smaller than at future points in time,\nwhich holds true for all three parts of the P&L (See Appendix 2 for a derivation of the\ntest statistics). In the case of banks' simulated quantity effect b, we find significance\nonly for the IIM compared to the year 2016; for NIM, the signs of the test statistics\ncorrespond to the theoretical prediction, but they are not significant. The total effect,\nwhich is, by definition, the sum of the direct and indirect effects (tot = a+b), often shows\na u-form development. According to the model in Section 3, the economic intuition is as\nfollows: At first, the explanatory power of today's balance sheet weights is falling because\nthe extents of the pass-through of the single bank products are becoming more similar.\nThen, this explanatory power is increasing again because the second effect, the adjusting\nof the balance sheet weights, is getting stronger.\n5.4 Robustness checks\nFirst, as stated above, our data cleaning considerably reduces our sample size. To take\nthis into account, we apply a less rigorous data cleaning for the robustness check. Hence,\nTable 4: R2 of a regression on today's balance sheet weights\nEffect Year\nNobs\nThis table shows the R2s of the regressions where, in each year, the respective effects a, b and tot are\nregressed on the balance sheet weights of 2014. Two scenarios are compared: the scenario of a downward\nshift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario with constant term structure. The difference of three\nincome components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM and IEM which denote the net interest margin,\nthe interest income margin and the interest expense margin, where the respective P&L components are\ndivided by the total assets as of end 2014 (and not as of the respective year). The effects a and b denote\nthe impact due to the price and the quantities (as defined in the Equations (12) and (13)), respectively;\ntot means the total effect, the sum of a and b (as defined in Equation (14)).\nEffect Year\nNobs\nThis table shows the difference in R2s (compared to the ones of the year 2015) of regressions of the effects\na, b and tot on the balance sheet weights of the year 2014. Two scenarios are compared: the scenario\nof a downward shift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario with a constant yield curve. The\ndifference of three income components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM and IEM which denote the net\ninterest margin, the interest income margin and the interest expense margin, where the respective income\ncomponents are divided by the total assets as of end 2014 (and not as of the respective year). The effects\na and b denote the impact due to price and quantity effects (as defined in the Equations (12) and (13)),\nrespectively; tot means the total effect, the sum of a and b (as defined in Equation (14)). Standard errors\nin brackets. *** , ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.\nwe retain observations no matter whether the balance sheet development is the same in\ndifferent scenarios that allow for balance sheet adjustments.9 This way of data cleaning\nyields a data set of about 1,200 banks. Overall, the results remain qualitatively the same.\nHowever, several points have to be highlighted. First, the total effect of the interest rate\nshock on the net interest margin is on average positive for the first two years, not only\non the first year as in the restricted sample (see Subsection 5.1). Second, the standard\ndeviation of banks' simulated quantity effect for the NIM is larger than that of banks'\nsimulated price effect in 2019 (and not the other way around as in the restricted sample).\nThird, when using the extended data set, the significances for the comparisons of the R2\n(see Subsection 5.3), become stronger.\nSecond, we check whether the calculations are robust to changes in the definitions of\nasset and liability components. First, we take together assets and liabilities of the same\nmaturities. Here, we observe a lower absolute level of the R2, but the same pattern of the\ncoefficient of determination.\nThird, we differentiate regarding the type of customer and loan type. Here, we classify\nbalance sheet positions into positions originated by business relationships with corporate\ncustomers, private persons, banks, government, non-profit organizations and foreign cus-\ntomers. Applying this specification also indicates a rising coefficient of determination\nregarding banks' simulated quantity effect, while the explanatory power in the specifica-\ntions for banks' simulated price effect declines over time.\nFourthly. we analyse the effects of balance sheet alignments separately for expansions\nand reductions. It turns out that the average effects on the P&L components NIM and\nIIM are negative in the event that banks expect balance sheet expansions, whereas in the\ncase of balance sheet reductions the average effects are positive. These results demonstrate\nthat expectations concerning balance sheet growth are a major determinant.\n6 Conclusion\nUsing unique supervisory survey data of German small and medium-size banks we are able\nto shed light on the question if a static balance sheet assumption seems to be justified\nin stress testing exercises. For understandable reasons, eg comparability of results, stress\ntests with a horizon of even several years are often carried out under the assumption of\nstatic balance sheets. In its pure nature, such a setting does not allow for changes in the\ncomposition and size of the balance sheet. Our results suggests that over a horizon of\nseveral years banks' simulated quantity effects due to balance sheet adjustments may have\nnoticeable effects. Our results show that in the first year the variance of banks' simulated\nprice effect \u00ad derived from a scenario with static balance sheets \u00ad is nearly eight times as\nlarge as the simulated quantity effect \u00ad derived from the same scenario but with dynamic\nbalance sheets. After five years, however, the importance of both effects converges as\nbanks' simulated price effect is just about twice as large as the simulated quantity effect.\nWe come to the conclusion that in interest rate stress tests with a short forecast horizon\na static balance sheet assumption might be justified, but not for the medium term. In\ngeneral, the current trend to create stress test exercises with constrained dynamic balance\n9This procedure can be justified by the argument that the balance sheet structure planning is not\nsignificantly different.\nsheets is consistent with our conclusion.\nFurthermore,our results show that balance sheet adjustments are not always in favor\nof banks. This might be explained by the fact that banks are subject to exogenous\nfactors, such as the behavior of depositors. The planning of the balance sheet structure\nseems to account for these considerable effects. We also find that the current balance\nsheet composition can to some extent answer the question of how banks are affected\nby a macroeconomic shock. Our results indicate that the simulated quantity effects are\nexplained better by a bank's current balance sheet composition, the longer the forecast\nhorizon. This is likely mirroring the only partial adjustment to the new equilibrium of\nportfolio composition. The opposite holds for banks' price effect.\nA Appendix\nA.1 Appendix 1: Deviation of the process of wh\nWe assume that a bank minimizes its losses which stem from deviations of the weight wh\nfrom the optimal weight \u017b\nw and from deviations from the past weight wh-1\n(adjustment\n( \u017b\nw - wh\n(wh\nWhen optimizing with respect to the weight wh\n, we obtain:\nLoss\nwh\n( \u017b\nw - wh\n(wh\nSetting Equation (17) to zero, the following condition arises, which is an autoregressive\nwh\n=\n\u017b\nw +\nSetting  = \u013e1\n\u017b\nw and  = \u013e2\n, we obtain the relationship in Equation (6).\nA.2 Appendix 2: Comparision of R2s\nIn this appendix, we derive the test statistics for a comparison of two coefficients of deter-\nmination, where we define, for the regression yi\n= xi\n+i\n, the coefficient of determination\nas\n\ny\n11Note that we take the weight wh-1\nas given.
