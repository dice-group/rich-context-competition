(1999) (hereinafter BGG) has come\nto be a widely used approach in recent macro-finance models to describe financial frictions\nbetween the financial and the non-financial sector (Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin,\net al. (2014) have recently argued, with the help of an estimated New Keynesian dynamic\nstochastic general equilibrium (DNK) model with BGG-type financial frictions, that risk\nshocks are very important sources of variations in the business cycle. Although empirical\nwork that is motivated by the BGG model draws its attention to yields of corporate\nbonds (see De Pace and Weber (2013); Mizen and Tsoukas (2012); Gilchrist, Yankov, and\nZakrajsek (2009)), in most of the theoretical models with BGG-type frictions the debt\ninstrument is seen as a loan without a market-determined price. The aim of the paper is\nto incorporate market-based debt into the BGG framework.\nGenerally, it turns out that corporate bond spreads convey relevant information for\nfuture economic activity that is particularly related to financial health (Mody and Taylor,\nof financially constrained non-financial firms seems to react more sensitively to shocks\nthan those of more unconstrained firms (Mizen and Tsoukas, 2012). However, recent\nwork can also show that the countercyclical relationship between spreads and economic\nactivity broke down for high-yield bonds during the financial crisis (De Pace and Weber,\n2013). From this point of view, it is worthwhile to model bond spreads directly in the BGG\nframework instead of credit spreads, as is usually done. Market-based debt is generally\ncharacterized by market prices. Not only does the trajectory of market prices determine\nreturns, but market prices also affect the repayment capacity if securities are not repaid at\npar value. How prices of market debt affect the economy when financial frictions prevail\nis of economic importance because some authors claim that credit spreads, as measured\nby bond spreads, have a non-trivial role for monetary policy (C\u00fardia and Woodford, 2010;\nIn this paper, we modifiy the financial accelerator model by introducing market-based\ndebt instruments, i.e. we allow the debt to have a market-determined price. In this\nregard, bonds' maturity structure plays an important role. We argue that the introduction\nof security prices in the BGG framework is important because the average maturity of\ncorporate bonds affects the transmission of shocks due to price effects. Our results show\nthat the BGG approach can be modified by market-based debt. However, the average\nmaturity crucially affects the dynamics. Including maturities into a dynamic general\nequilibrium model is highly important because most contracts last one period in theory but\nclearly longer in reality. Maturity transformation in banks has been recently investigated\nby Andreasen, Ferman, and Zabczyk (2013) in a real business cycle model. We propose\na different approach by relying on a well-known New Keynesian framework.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the modification of the BGG\napproach by including market-based debt instruments. Section 3 provides the dynamic\ngeneral equilibrium framework in which the financial accelerator is embedded. Before we\ninvestigate the dynamics of the models in Section 5, we present the calibration in Section\n4. Section 6 concludes.\n2 The Agency Problem\n2.1 The Financial Accelerator Approach\nWe follow Bernanke et al. (1999), who rely on Townsend (1979), and posit a costly\nstate verification problem between financial intermediaries and non-financial firms.1 Non-\nfinancial firms realize idiosyncratic shocks that affect the repayment capacity of their\nexternal funds. We assume that non-financial firms acquire physical capital which is\nexposed to these idiosyncratic shocks. The signals are private to non-financial firms.\nHowever, financial intermediaries can get knowledge of the signals by spending resources,\ni.e. incurring monitoring costs. In cases where the idiosyncratic shock is not sufficient to\ngenerate enough returns for the non-financial firm to cover all of its debt, it has to give\nall remaining assets to the intermediaries, which makes the contract incentive-compatible.\nBecause of asymmetric information in conjunction with monitoring costs, non-financial\nfirms combine net worth with debt to purchase physical capital.\nIn the BGG setting, funds are intermediated between non-financial firms (entrepreneurs)\nand financial intermediaries with the help of mutual funds (Christiano et al., 2014; Chris-\ntiano and Ikeda, 2013). The mutual funds obtain financial resources from households\nand redistribute them to the entrepreneurs. Each financial contract is immanently risky,\nbut through diversification the risk can be eliminated completely. As a result of diver-\nsification, the mutual funds can guarantee their ability to pay the risk-free rate to their\ncreditors while the entrepreneurs have to pay the external finance premium in addition to\nthe risk-free rate to compensate the mutal funds for expenses related to monitoring. The\nresulting external finance premium varies positively with entrepreneurs' leverage ratio.\nTypically, the financial contract is seen as a debt instrument that has a constant price\nof unity. We modify the BGG setting in this respect, i.e. we allow for a debt instrument\nwith a price that changes over time, i.e. we treat bonds. Thus, the balance sheet constraint\nof the entrepreneurs becomes\nQB\nt\n= QK\nt\nwhere QB\nt\nis the real price of the bond, Bm,t+1\nis the quantity of bonds the m-th en-\ntrepreneur demands, QK\nt\nis the price of capital, Km,t+1\nthe capital stock each m-th\nentrepreneur holds and NWm,t+1\nis the net worth of each m-th entrepreneur. The in-\ntroduction of the real bond price QB\nt\nmakes this model different from the standard BGG\nmodel, in which QB\nt\nis equal to one.\nBy introducing the bond price and the risky (gross) bond rate Zt+1\nwe modify the\ncondition that determines the threshold m,t+1\nfor the productivity process, below which\nbankruptcies occur, given the value of capital held and given the return on capital RK\nQK\nt\nQB\nt\nIn Eqs. (1) and (2) the initial consequences of the introduction of the price become clear.\nGiven the value of capital the entrepreneurs want to purchase, given their real quantity of\n1An alternative setting which is frequently used sees financial frictions between the financial inter-\nmediaries, namely banks, and their creditors (see, for example, Gertler and Kiyotaki, 2010; Gertler and\nKaradi, 2011). As argued by Christiano et al. (2014), both approaches are closely linked.\nbonds, and the contractual bond rate, an increase in bond prices raises the productivity\nthreshold for defaults and lowers entrepreneurial net worth.\nFollowing the standard BGG approach, the entrepreneur's expected earnings can be\nexpressed as the difference between the earnings on the projects given all realizations of\nthe productivity exceeding the threshold value and the costs of the credit raised for the\nnon-default cases\n= Et\n^\n\nj\ndF () - (1 - F (m,t+1\nQK\nt\nThe function F (m,t+1\n) in Eq. (3) represents the cumulative density function for realiza-\ntions of m,t+1\n. Thus, its value given one specific realization of m,t+1\nis the probability\nof default. In the case of a default, i.e. where the productivity variable falls short of the\nthreshold, the entrepreneurs surrender all remaining assets to the financial intermediary.\nSimilarly to Bernanke et al. (1999) or Christiano et al. (2014), we can rewrite Eq.\n(3), with the help of the definition f () = \n\u00b4\n\n\nf( )d +\n\u00b4\n\nf( )d , to obtain\nthe optimization problem. Net earnings are maximized by choosing the optimal value\nfor e\nand Km,t+1\nsubject to the participation constraint of the intermediaries which\nstates that intermediaries demand a return which is at least identical to the risk-free rate.\nmax\nQK\nt\ns.t.\n) - \u00b5G(m,t+1\nQK\nt\nrB\nQK\nt\nThe function G() is defined as\n\u00b4\n\nf( )d and comprises the default events. The\nexpression \n\u00b4\n\n\nf( )d is equal to (1 - F (m,t+1\n. Intermediaries act in a mar-\nket of perfect competition and earn zero profits.\nAs a result of profit maximization, we obtain the two well-known optimality condi-\ntions: the first-order condition of the contract (Eq. (5)) and the budget constraint of the\nentrepreneurs (Eq. (6))\nrB\n; t\n) +\n; t\n)\n; t\n) - \u00b5G (m,t+1\n; t\n)\n\u00d7 f (m,t+1\n; t\n) - \u00b5G(m,t+1\n; t\n)\nrB\nand\n; t\n) - \u00b5G(m,t+1\n; t\n)\nrB\nQK\nt\n-\nQK\nt\nBecause of the arguments outlined above, the mutual funds issue a representative bond\nto the households. The bond that is at the center of the modification is assumed to have\na fixed payoff (i0\n) every period that is one determinant of the bond return rB\nt\n. We provide\nmore details in the next subsection.\n2.2 Introducing maturities\nSince the maturity of bonds is generally longer than one period in reality, we need to\ndeal with an (average) maturity structure. Woodford (2001) proposes a simple way to\ntake account of average maturities that deviate from one period. He assumes that every\nperiod a fraction of bonds matures (1 - ) , whereas the remaining fraction  is repaid\nin later periods (we call  the maturity parameter in the following).2 Chen, C\u00fardia, and\nFerrero (2012) choose a similar approach to account for maturity considerations. In line\nwith both contributions we assume that each entrepreneur issues corporate bonds with\na specific maturity every period.3 Consequently, the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is the\naggregate and comprises a continuum of bonds with corresponding prices. We need to\nmodify this equation with the definition QB\nt\n= \nQB\nt|t-s\n, where QB\nt|t-s\nis the price of a bond in period t issued s periods ago, which gives us\nQK\nt\n\nQB\nt|t-s\nFurthermore, we assume that every series s of each non-financial firm m defaults to the\nsame extent if the non-financial firm cannot satisfy all its obligations.4 Under these cir-\ncumstances it is easy to show that the price of a series depends on the current bond\nprice and the maturity parameter  Qt|s\n= sQt\nfrom which it follows that the aggre-\ngate quantity of bonds Bm,t\nis the sum of all series weighted by the maturity parameter\n(Bt\n= \nsBm,t-s\nBy introducing maturities we are faced with the problem of choosing a proper defi-\nnition of the bond return because of the economic interpretation related to it. We can\nfundamentally distinguish between holdings until maturity and period holdings. If bonds\nhave a maturity of more than one period the definition of (expected) returns becomes\nrelevant because it is related to the investment strategy.6 From investors' perspective the\nexpected return over the entire period is relevant for the first case, while it is the expected\nperiod return for the latter. Since holdings until maturity are less relevant for financial\nintermediaries in reality we take the period perspective.7 Given that no arbitrage holds,\nthe (nominal) period return rB\nt\nfor a (composite) bond, that carries a coupon, accordingly\narises as\n2This can be thought of as a reinvestment.\n3For the sake of simplicity, we assume that entrepreneurs issue bonds so that the average maturity\nremains the same, i.e. their issuance policy is to control the average maturity. Otherwise we need to\nthink about the reasons why entrepreneurs have different issuance policies.\n4This is a conventional assumption which is usually covered by enforced law. However, specific series\ncan be affected by default in reality while it is not the case in our model.\n6Note that the model will be calibrated to reflect quarterly data. If bonds have a maturity of one\nquarter, a distinction will not be necessary.\n7Following the International Financial Reporting Standards (IRFS 13) a fair value measurement\ncan be used to determine the book value of financial assets in firm's balance sheet which is close to\nmarket prices. This approach can be applied to both assets and liabilities. The US Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (US GAAP) contain similar guidelines.\nEt\nrB\n=\nEt\n) Et\nQB\n- QB\nt\nQB\nt\nWoodford (2001) assumes that bond prices result from an \"exogenously specified deter-\nministic\" process. In that case the perfect-foresight solution does not deviate much from\nthe solution for small stochastic changes. Based upon Woodford (2001), Chen et al. (2012)\nopt for another formulation of the return and draw on the yield-to-maturity. Hence, it is\npossible to proxy for different maturities by varying the term  in Eq. (8) (see Woodford,\n2001). Again, s states that a fraction of the bonds is paid s + 1 periods after they are\nissued. For  = 1 the bonds become consols and for  = 0 they are one-period bonds.\n2.3 Integrating maturities in the BGG framework\nIn the following we show what changes if we include bonds with a specific (average) ma-\nturity into the BGG framework. In order to prevent households from having to bear the\ncosts of defaulting, mutual funds were introduced, which hold a fully diversified portfo-\nlio (Christiano et al., 2014). Households transfer their savings consequently to mutual\nfunds which intermediate them to the entrepreneurs. As mentioned, mutual funds hold a\nportfolio of entrepreneurial bonds and issue risk-free bonds which are bought by house-\nholds. This leads to the mutual funds' portfolio\n\u00b4\n\nQB\nt|t-s\ndm, which must\nbe refinanced. An overview of this setting is given in Fig. 1.\nFigure 1: Financial Sector in the modified BGG model\nFor the sake of simplicity, we assume that financial intermediaries do not conduct term\ntransformation which means that the average maturity of corporate bonds is identical to\nthe average maturity of the bonds financial intermediaries issue.8 It follows that mutual\nfunds issue bonds every time they plan to buy bonds from entrepreneurs. In order to match\n8In the absence of large long-lasting stochastic shocks, the yield curve is flat. For this reason, mutual\nfunds have no incentive to exploit term transformation.\nthe flow of funds, the purchases in the amount QB\nt|k\nBm,k\nfrom the m-th entrepreneur at time\nk are financed by issuances of the n-th series QB,mf\nt|k\nBmf\nn,k\nwith the same maturity.9 With\nthe help of the definition QB,mf\nt\nBmf\nn,t\n= \nQB,mf\nt|k\nBmf\nn,k\nand the corresponding definition\nfor entrepreneurs, we can formulate the participation constraint of the intermediary with\nrespect to the m-th entrepreneur as\n)] 1 + rB,risky\nt\nQB\nt\n\u00b4\nQK\nt\ndF ()\n.\nrB\nQB,mf\nt\nBmf\nSince every individual bond issuance of entrepreneurs is tied to bond issuances of mutual\nfunds, we can replace QB\nt\nBm,t\nin Eq. (9) by QB,mf\nk\nBmf\nn,t\n.\nThe risky bond return, as given in Eq. (2), can be rewritten so that we define the risky\nbond rate as Et\nrB,risky\n= Et\nQB\nQB\nt\n-1. However, we can easily relate the risky\nbond rate to the risk-free bond rate by introducing a finance premium rB,risky\nt\n= rB\nt\n+fpt\n,\nthereby obtaining\nEt\nrB,risky\n= Et\nQB,mf\nQB,mf\nt\nwhere rpt+1\nis the finance premium in real terms and reflects compensation for risk.\nIn order to back out the determinants of the compensation for risk, we can re-write\nEq. (6) with the help of Eq. (2) and the definition Zt\n= 1 + rB,risky\nt\nto obtain\nrB,risky\n=\nrB\n; t\n) - \u00b5G(t+1\n; t\n)\nAs can be seen in Eq. (11) the risky bond rate depends on the risk-free return, the\nproductivity threshold and intermediaries' net earnings after monitoring costs they have\nto bear as a consequence of entrepreneurs' defaults. With the use of the definitions for the\nreturns and the participation constraint (Eq. (4)) we can solve for the risk compensation\nto get\nEt\n) =\n; t\n)\n; t\n) - \u00b5G(t+1\n; t\n)\n\n\nEt\nQB,mf\nQB,mf\nt\n\nWhat is easy to see is that an increase in the productivity threshold causes the risky bond\nrate to go up via the risk compensation because it is more difficult for the entrepreneurs\nto repay their debt contractually and the intermediary requests compensation due to\nincreased monitoring costs. A rise in the current bond price contributes to a fall in\nthe risky bond rate. The reason might be that an increased bond price reflects a fall\nin the risk-free rate which reduces borrowing costs. However, a rise in expected bond\nprices stimulates the compensation for risk. The economic interpretation is related to the\n9This is not a necessary assumption to make the model working because of the diversification. How-\never, we do not want to stress the problem of maturity mismatches.\nintroduction of market-based debt. The formulation implicitly assumes that the remaining\nfraction is repaid at expected market price (for reinvestment). In the logic of the model,\nan increase in the expected bond price raises the value of debt that must be repaid in the\nfuture. Given the productivity threshold and the corresponding probability of default,\nthis also means that the investor will lose more money with higher future prices. Hence,\nthe investor wants compensation for this risk. In this case, the reinvestment risk is not\nnegligible and a prolongation risk arises. Consequently, an unexpected rise in bond prices\ncauses entrepreneurial net worth to drop because debt must be repaid at higher market\nprices. This introduces a new channel how maturity structures matter. It becomes clear\nthat price changes are important determinants in the modification of the BGG approach.\nFurthermore, we can get more insight into the relations among the risky and the risk-\nfree bond. By making use of the definition for the risky bond rate, we can also express\nthe finance premium in terms of bond prices\nEt\n) =\n\n\nEt\nQB\nQB\nt\n-\nEt\nQB,mf\nQB,mf\nt\n\n .\nIt should be noted that the prices of both bonds differ due to risk considerations. By\ncombining Eq. (8) with the former, we can state a relationship between the price of\ncorporate bonds and mutual funds' bonds.\nQB\nt\n; t\n)\n; t\n) - \u00b5G(t+1\n; t\n)\n\n\nEt\nQB,mf\nEt\nQB\n\n\nQB,mf\nt\nAs becomes clear, the price of the entrepreneurial bond is automatically linked to the mu-\ntual funds' bond price and to the riskiness of entrepreneurs. Since mutual funds do not\nknow a priori the riskiness of the entrepreneurs, i.e. the realization of m,t\n, but only have\nknowledge about its distribution, they would charge every entrepreneurial bond issuance\nwith the same risk premium. However, leverage ratio might differ across entrepreneurs\nwhich would basically affect the individual risk premium and would make aggregation\nmore difficult. For this reason, we assume that there is a kind of perfect insurance that\nequates leverage ratios by transfering net worth across the entrepreneurs before the fi-\nnancial contract is signed.10 Thus, risk premia do not vary across the continuum of\nentrepreneurs and, therefore, the price of corporate bonds across entrepreneurs either.\nIt becomes clear that the BGG approach is suitable to introduce traded bonds with the\nhelp of several assumptions and the equations from Subsection 2.1 still hold, however, an\nimportant role for maturities is introduced.\nIn order to evaluate the effects of maturities in the dynamic general equilibrium con-\ntext, we embed the BGG framework into a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium (DSGE) model in the fashion of Smets and Wouters (2003) or Christiano,\n10This insurance can be seen similarly as the insurance mechanism introduced by Erceg, Henderson,\nand Levin (2000) with respect to the labor market which equates differences in labor income ex post.\nHowever, it is not required that a formal agency preserves the transfers of resources. One can imagine\nthat entrepreneurs with higher leverage ratios might be acquired by entrepreneurs with lower leverage\nratios. Market forces would then equate leverage ratios.\n3 Financial frictions in a New Keynesian model\nWe introduce a standard BGG approach into a standard DNK model \u00e0 la Smets and\nWouters (2003) that is modified to allow for market-based debt which has a price. Hence,\nthere are intermediate goods producers that produce differentiated goods to be sold in\na market with monopolistic competition. Through Calvo pricing we introduce stickiness\nin prices. Non-optimizing firms follow a price indexation as a mixture of steady-state\ninflation and past inflation. The intermediate goods are bundled following a Dixit-Stiglitz\naggregation technology to become final goods. Intermediate goods are produced with the\nhelp of capital and labor. Following Erceg et al. (2000) nominal wages are also sticky. The\nstock of capital can only be adjusted by paying adjustment costs; however, the utilization\nof capital is allowed to vary, which is associated with costs. After physical capital is\nproduced, it is handed over to entrepreneurs.\nThere exists a continuum of households where every l-th household, with l  (0, 1),\ndecides on its consumption (Cl,t\n), its labor supply (Nl,t\n), and the allocation of its wealth\nderived from a utility maximization problem. The preferences of the households can be\ncharacterized by\n\nj\n(Cl,t+j\n- \n(Nl,t+j\nIn Eq. (14) the parameter  is the discount factor,  controls the elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution, and  reflects the inverse Frisch elasticity. Since households show external\nhabit formation, the parameter h is the habit parameter. The term  is for scaling\npurposes. The household can invest in two financial assets: government bonds BG\nt\nand\nbonds issued by mutal funds Bmf\nt\n. Regarding the former, households earn the risk-free\nrate while they receive the risk-free bond return for holdings of the latter. Government\nbonds are in zero net supply. Since households are the owners of intermediate goods\nfirms, the monopolistic profits are paid out as dividends (Dt\n). Every household has to\npay lump-sum taxes (Tt\n). Besides the returns stemming from their wealth, households\nreceive income from their labor supply.\nConcerning the labor supply we follow Erceg et al. (2000) and assume that households\nsupply their differentiated labor to a labor union which demands differentiated labor from\nall households and bundle this heterogenous labor supply to produce a homogenous labor\ncomposite (Eq. (15)).\nNt\n=\n^\nNl,t\n dl\n\nIntermediate goods producers demand the homogenous labor bundle for use in production.\nBecause of monopolistic power in the labor market, households can set wages. In Eq.\n(15) the term w controls the substitution among differentiated labor. The labor union\nminimizes the costs for producing the labor bundle by taking the individual wage rates as\ngiven. Following this optimization problem, the demand for each individual unit of labor\nresults as\nNl,t\n= Nt\nWl,t\nWt\n-w\nBy combining Eqs. (15) and (16) we can obtain the aggregate wage index Wt\nWt\n=\n^\nl,t\ndl\nwhich is the price intermediate goods firms have to pay for a unit of the labor composite.\nSimilarly to Calvo pricing in goods markets, households cannot reoptimize their wage\nevery period. Reoptimization is only possible with a probability of 1-w which they take\ninto account in their optimization problem. Thus, households maximize labor income by\nchoosing the optimal wage rate and by taking the disutility of labor and the demand for\ntheir labor as given.\nmax\n{Wl,t\n}\nEt\n\n(w)s l,t+s\nw\nt+s\nPt+s\nW\nl,t\nN\nl,t+s\n- \nN\nl,t+s\nIn Eq. (18) the variable l,t\nis the marginal utility of consumption, and the wage indexa-\ntion is embedded in w\nt\n. In cases where households cannot reset their wages, they follow\na simple indexation rule that is ~\nwt\n= w\n, where  is the steady-state rate of\ninflation.\nSince wages and labor supply can fundamentally differ across all households, we as-\nsume that a state-contingent insurance exists that equates income across households.\nPayments from this insurance and transfers to entrepreneurs are denoted by l,t\n. Taking\nall arguments together, the budget constraint becomes\nPt\nQB,mf\nt\nBmf\nl,t\n+ Pt\nBG\nl,t\n+ Pt\nCl,t\n) BG\n+ Pt\nTl,t\n+ Pt\nl,t\nt+j\nQB,mf\nBmf\n+ Pt\nDl,t\n+ Wl,t\nNl,t\nwhere the variable Pt\ndenotes the price level. Since households also hold a risk-free\nbond (with zero net supply) with return it\n, which is the risk-free rate, the no-arbitrage\ncondition Et\nt\nrB\n- it\n= 0 results by linking both Euler equations.\n3.2 Final goods firms\nIn a continuum of intermediate goods producing fims each i-th firm produces the i-th\ndifferentiated good. All intermediate goods firms operate in a market with monopolistic\ncompetition. The final goods sector is characterized by a representitive producer, due to\nperfect competition, who purchases the intermediate goods and combines them with the\nhelp of a bundling technology (Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator) to obtain the final good (Yt\n)\nYt\n=\n^\nYi,t\n di\n\nwhere the parameter  reflects the market power and determines the price markup. The\nfinal goods producing firm maximizes profits by taking the prices of the intermediate\ngoods as well as the price of the final goods as given and by choosing the amount of both\nintermediate goods they demand and the amount of final goods they supply. As a result\nthe demand function for intermediate goods results as\nYi,t\n= Yt\nPi,t\nPt\n-\nwhere Pit\nis the price of the i-th intermediate good and Pt\nthe price of the final good.\n3.3 Intermediate goods firms\nEach i-th intermediate good is produced with the help of a standard Cobb-Douglas pro-\nduction function with constant returns to scale and fixed costs \nYi,t\n= At\nK\ni,t\ni,t\n- i\nwhere the term  is the share of capital in production and At\nrepresents the technology.\nIn order to produce a unit of the intermediate good, the firms need physical capital (Ki,t\n),\nthey rent from the entrepreneurs, and homogeneous labor (Ni,t\n). In a first step, inter-\nmediate goods firms minimize their costs by choosing the inputs given their production\ntechnology. Since intermediate goods firms have market power, they are able to set the\nprice optimally. However, frictions prevail, which means that setting optimal prices can\nonly be realized with a probability of 1 - . In cases where intermediate goods firms can-\nnot choose the optimal price, they adjust prices following an indexation rule (\u00af\nt\n) which is\na weighted average of last period's inflation (t-1\n) and the steady-state rate of inflation\n()\n\u00af\nt\n= \nAs a result of the Calvo price frictions, intermediate goods firms maximize their profits by\nchoosing the optimal price P\ni,t\ngiven the demand for their goods and given their marginal\ncosts by taking the probability of non-optimization into account\nmax\n{P\ni,t\n}\nEt\n\njj Yi,t\nP\ni,t\n- mci,t+j\nPt+j\n,\nwhere mct\ndenotes marginal costs.\n3.4 Capital producers\nThe economy is populated by capital producers which are owned by households and work\nin a market of perfect competition, which is why all capital producers are identical. After\nproduction has taken place in period t capital producers purchase undepreciated physical\ncapital (1 - ) Kt\nfrom entrepreneurs at price QK\nt\nin order to combine it with newly\nproduced investment goods (It\n) to obtain the new stock of physical capital ( \u00af\n) for\nuse in the next period. Because of attrition, a fraction of the stock of physical capital\ndepreciates at a constant rate  every period. The installation of new physical capital by\nusing investment goods entails costs  It\n. The functional form of the cost function\nis given by  It\n= I\nIt\nthat satisfies the conditions  (1) =  (1) = 0 and\n > 0. The resulting law of motion for capital is presented in Eq. (23).\n\u00af\n= Kt\n(1 - ) + It\nIt\nAfter capital producers have constructed the new stock of physical capital, they sell it to\nthe entrepreneurs at price QK\nt\nat the end of period t. Capital producers maximize their\nprofits by choosing the amount of newly produced investment goods. For convenience,\ninvestment goods have the same price as physical capital.\nmax\n{It}\nEt\n\nt+j\nKt+j\n(1 - ) + It+j\nIt+j\nThe economy is populated by a continuum of entrepreneurs. Each m-th entrepreneur with\nm  (0, 1) buys a specific amount of physical capital from capital producers and rents\nit out to intermediate goods producers. After having purchased the amount of physical\ncapital at the end of period t and before renting it out during the period t+1, entrepreneurs\nprocess the stock of capital they now own at the beginning of period t+1 and subsequently\nchoose its utilization rate in the following. Entrepreneurial skills are subject to random\nshocks, which are independently distributed across entrepreneurs and periods following a\nlog normal distribution with a mean of unity. These shocks affect entrepreneurs' individual\nproductivity m,t+1\nwhich determines the effective stock of capital the m-th entrepreneur\ncan work with\n\u00af\nBefore this capital is supplied to intermediate goods producers, entrepreneurs can\nvary the capital utilization rate ut+1\nso that the utilized stock of capital for the m-th\nentrepreneur becomes\nVariations in the capital utilization rate are linked to costs , which take the form\n(um,t\n) =\nrk\nk\n(exp k (um,t\nIn Eq. (26) the term rk represents the rental costs of capital (in the steady state) and\nk is a scaling parameter. After the utilization rate has been chosen, entrepreneurs rent\nthe capital to intermediate goods producers and receive the rental rate on capital rk\nt\nper units of utilized capital. As already explained above, after production has occurred,\nentrepreneurs sell the undepreciated capital back at price QK\n. Hence, the return on\ncapital for each m-th entrepreneur results as\n= Et\nrk\n) + QK\nQK\nt\n.\nBecause of asymmetric information between the entrepreneurs and their creditors (see\nSubsection 2.1), the entrepreneurs cannot solely rely on external finance and buy physical\ncapital (at price QK\nt\n) with a combination of own resources (net worth NWm,t\n) and external\nfunds. External funds can be obtained by issuing corporate bonds (Bm,t\n) at bond price\nQB\nt\n. Loosely speaking, net worth results as an outcome of entrepreneurial activity. The\nsale of physical capital back to capital producers after intermediate goods producers give\nrented capital back to entrepreneurs, together with corresponding rental income, generate\nearnings. From these earnings entrepreneurs satisfy their liabilities stemming from the\nissuance of external debt. The remainder constitutes net worth. Thus, external finance\nis determined by the desired purchases of physical capital and existing net worth.\nQB\nt\n= QK\nt\nThe decision problem of entrepreneurs consists of two problems that can be understood\nas undertaken in two branches. While entrepreneurial profits are maximized by choosing\nthe threshold productivity and the amount of effective capital in the first branch, utilized\ncapital is found by minimizing utilization costs by choosing the amount of capital. While\nthe second problem is straightforward, the first one is already explained in Subsection\n2.1. The law of motion for net worth is the only missing equation. In order to prevent\nentrepreneurs from accumulating net worth indefinitely, which would obviate the need to\nraise external finance, we follow Bernanke et al. (1999) and assume that entrepreneurs\nexit with a specific probability of . The total number of entrepreneurs remains constant\nbecause new entrepreneurs enter who receive a transfer from their households to start\nbusiness which is a fraction  of total assets. Again, the same insurance mechanism that\nequates leverage ratios across entrepreneurs also controls the average maturity of old and\nnew entrepreneurs by redistributing resources. Consequently, aggregate entrepreneurial\nnet worth evolves from net earnings (for all non-default cases), i.e. the difference between\nreturns on entrepreneurial projects and the costs for external finance plus the transfer\nfrom households.\n= \nt\nt\nQK\nKt\n+ QK\nKt\n.\nThe central bank follows a Taylor rule for setting the policy rate it\n. In doing so, the\ncentral bank reacts to deviations of the rate of inflation from a target rate, with a weight\nof , and to the growth rate in output, with a weight of y.

Besides investment goods, consumption, and\ngovernment expenditure (which make up a fixed percentage of output), capital utilization\nand monitoring costs also accumulate resources. Thus, the resource constraint of the\neconomy becomes\nYt\n= It\n+ Ct\n+ Gt\n+ Kt\nt\n+ Kt\nQK\nt\nG(t\n) \u00b5f\nt\n4 Calibration\nAs usual, we calibrate our model on a quarterly frequency. The parameters for the\ncalibration predominantly stem from Smets and Wouters (2007) and Christiano et al.\n(2014). The latter have recently estimated a model with BGG-type frictions for US data.\nObviously, our model then reflects the structure of the USA. All calibrated parameters\ncan be found in Table 1.\nFor the curvature of the utility function with respect to consumption we set a value\nof 1.4. Similarly, the inverse Frisch elasticity becomes 1.9. Both values are from Smets\nand Wouters (2007). The parameter for habit formation in consumption is equal to 0.7\n(Smets and Wouters, 2007; Christiano et al., 2014). The Calvo parameters for prices and\nwages are set at 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, which are the estimated values in Christiano\net al. (2014). The weights on lagged inflation in the indexation rules for prices and wages\nare taken from the same source and become 0.1 and 0.51, respectively, in our model. We\nalso allow for a steady-state rate of inflation that is set to 2.4 per cent annually, which\nreflects the US experience. The parameter in the cost function for variations in capital\nutilization becomes 2.54 (Christiano et al., 2014) and the corresponding parameter for\ninvestment adjustment costs is 5.5 (Smets and Wouters, 2007). The discount factor is set\nbe 2.92 per cent and the real risk-free rate to be 0.52 per cent on an annual basis. The\ndepreciation rate of capital is calibrated to the conventional value of 0.025. Labor is set\nRegarding the parameters in the Taylor rule, we set the responsiveness to inflation\nparameters for the BGG part corresponds to the estimated values of Christiano et al.\n(2014). The share of resources lost for monitoring purposes takes the conventional value\nof 0.21. Similarly, the variance of the idiosyncratic productivity process becomes 0.26.\nTable 1: Calibration of Parameters\nDescription Symbol Value\nInverse of Frisch Elasticity of Goods' Production Labor  1.9\nCurvature on Utility of Consumption  1.4\nHabit Formation hC 0.7\nWage Elasticity in Labor Aggregator w 6\nShare of Lagged Inflation in Indexation Rule for Wages w 0.51\nSteady State Labor Input in Goods' Production N 0.33\nCapital Share in Intermediate Goods' Production  0.4\nPrice Elasticity in Final Goods' Production  6.5\nInvestment Adjustment Costs  5.5\nCapital Utilization Adjustment Costs  2.54\nShare of Lagged Inflation in Indexation Rule for Prices  0.1\nTaylor Rule - Interest Smoothing i\nTaylor Rule - Inflation \nTaylor Rule - Output Growth y\nSteady-State Rate of Inflation, Annualized s\nShare of Realized Profits Lost in Case of Default Due to Monitoring \u00b5f 0.21\nVariance of Idiosyncratic Productivity Parameter  0.26\nSurvival Probability of Entrepreneurs f 0.985\nThe business failure rate becomes 0.0056 and the survival probability of the entrepreneurs\n5 Analyzing the dynamics\n5.1 General evaluation of the modified BGG model\nIn this subsection we discuss the overall performance of the BGG model modified by\nmarket-based debt. We contrast its overall dynamic with those of the standard BGG\nmodel and the standard New Keynesian model (standard NK).11 The underlying two\nshocks are standard in DNK models (monetary policy shock and productivity shock).\nIn the following figures the modified BGG model is given by the bold black lines, the\nstandard BGG model by the blue dashed lines, and the standard NK model by the red\nlines with dots. For the modification of the BGG model we set the maturity parameter\n to 1, which means that the bond is a consol, similar to the formulation in Woodford\nThe dynamics resulting from a monetary policy shock for output, consumption, in-\nvestments, inflation, hours worked, real wages, entrepreneurial net worth, the finance pre-\nmium, and the bond price can be found in Fig. 2. Following the two first-order conditions\nrelated to the BGG approach, the finance premium is defined as 1 + Rk\nrB\n.\nAs can be seen, the qualitative dynamics regarding the macroeconomic variables are\nmostly similar across the three models. However, qualitative differences emerge through\nthe modification of the standard BGG model with respect to net worth and the finance\n11In the standard NK model all financial frictions are switched off.\nOutput\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInflation\nPP  from ss\nHours worked\n%  from ss\nReal Wages\n%  from ss\nBGG with bond prices Standard BGG Standard NK\nNet worth\n%  from ss\nFinance Premium\nBP  from ss\nBond Price\n%  from ss\nFigure 2: Comparison of Models - Monetary Policy Shock\npremium. The introduction of market-based debt with a long maturity structure atten-\nuates the responses of investments and output compared to the standard BGG and the\nstandard NK model. This development is mostly due to the different behavior of the\naforementioned two variables. Concretely, the responses of bond prices are the driving\nforce behind and mainly responsible for the differences. By introducing maturities, it is\nassumed that debt is repaid at the end of every period at the prevailing market price.\nSince the price drops following the monetary policy shock, it is easier for the entrepreneur\nto service a given quantity of bonds. Because of this effect net worth shrinks less com-\npared to the standard BGG case. As a result, the leverage ratio decreases which reduces\nthe external finance premium. This is in clear contrast to the standard BGG model in\nwhich the finance premium rises. The attenuation of the drop in investments, following\nthe monetary policy shock, stems from the improvement in this part of entrepreneurs'\nfinancing conditions. In the case of a very long maturitiy structure, the amplification\nmechanism of shocks with respect to output and investments, introduced with the help\nof financial frictions, is even reversed through our modifications. However, consumption\ndecreases by more in the modified model because inflation falls by less which implies a\nhigher trajectory for the risk-free rate.\nFor the productivity shock, the dynamics of which are shown in Fig. 3, the situation\nis quite similar. After the productivity shock, the demand for physical capital rises and,\nas a consequence, its price, which increases entrepreneurs' net worth. Nevertheless, the\nfinance premium slightly increases because of the Fisherian effect (see Christiano, Motto,\nOutput\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInflation\nPP  from ss\nHours worked\n%  from ss\nReal Wages\n%  from ss\nBGG with bond prices Standard BGG Standard NK\nNet worth\n%  from ss\nFinance Premium\nBP  from ss\nBond Price\n%  from ss\nFigure 3: Comparison of Models - Productivity Shock\nand Rostagno (2010)). The Fisherian effect stems from the fact that financial contracts\nare written in nominal terms so that real net worth is also affected by the rate of inflation.\nAs Christiano et al. (2010) show for a transitory productivity shock, which is identical\nto our productivity shock, the Fisherian effect is mainly responsible for the attenuation\nof the responses compared to the standard NK model by introducing financial frictions.\nIn the modified model, bond prices also increase which induce the entrepreneurs to have\nan unexpected higher debt service in the next period with a given quantity of bonds.\nThis effect additionally dampens the increase in net worth in the modified model. The\nresulting rise in the leverage ratio stimulates the upward pressure in the finance premium\nand dampens the improvement in investments compared to the standard BGG model.\nThus, the introduction of market-based debt with a long maturity structure reinforces the\nattenuation effects on investments and output resulting from the standard BGG model in\nthe case of the productivity shock.\nSumming up the results, the introduction of market-based debt into the standard\nBGG model attenuates its accelerating mechanism. Changes in bond prices affect net\nworth which feed back into entrepreneurs' leverage ratio and consequently into the finance\npremium. In the next section, we discuss the impact of maturities on the dynamics.\n5.2 Consequences of different maturities\nFig. 4 shows the effects on output, investments, inflation, the finance premium, the bond\nprice, and net worth following an unexpected monetary policy shock (first column), a\nproductivity shock (second column), and a shock on the riskiness of entrepreneurs (last\ncolumn). The last shock is typical to understand stress in the financial sector (Christiano\net al., 2014). For all three shocks we compare the dynamics of the modified BGG model\nfor three different average maturities. In the first case, the bold black line represents a\nconsol, i.e.  = 1. The second case comes close to the average maturity in the USA and\nis given by the dashed red line. The avarage maturity in the USA from 2000 until the\nemergence of the financial crisis for bonds of non-financial corporations is slightly more\nthan 6 years.12 This value can be achieved by setting  to value of 0.97, which corresponds\nto an average maturity of slightly less than 6 years.13 The cyan-colored line with dots\nreflects an average maturity structure of one period (one quarter), i.e.  = 0. In addition,\nwe provide the dynamics of the standard BGG model as a benchmark, which is given by\nthe blue dashed dotted lines.\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInflation\nPP  from ss\nFinance Premium\nBP  from ss\nBond price\n%  from ss\nNet worth\n%  from ss\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInflation\nPP  from ss\nFinance Premium\nBP  from ss\nBond price\n%  from ss\nNet worth\n%  from ss\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInflation\nPP  from ss\nFinance Premium\nBP  from ss\nBond price\n%  from ss\nNet worth\n%  from ss\nFigure 4: Consequences of Maturities - Monetary Policy Shock (left-hand column), Pro-\nductivity Shock (middle column), and Risk Shock (right-hand column)\nAs becomes clear, the case for shorter maturities coincides largely with the standard\n12We use the duration of the iBoxx corporate bond index for non-financials across all credit ratings as\na proxy for the average maturity.\n13By average maturity we mean the average duration.\nBGG case. An unexpected monetary policy shock increases the risk-free rate, which\nreduces consumption and output. This is the reason why the demand for capital shrinks.\nThe downward pressure on capital prices contracts entrepreneurs' net worth and boosts\nthe finance premium, which makes investments even more expensive. In the case of\na longer average maturity, the rise in the risk-free rate depresses the bond price more\nstrongly.14 The reason for the stronger fall in bond prices is that fewer bonds are repaid\nevery period, which means that the price must fall more sharply to achieve the same\nreturn. Falling bond prices now reduce the finance premium so much that it falls below\nits steady-state value. Since in the model outstanding debt is repaid at market prices\nevery period and the remaining funds are reinvested, lower bond prices ease the debt\nburden and foster net worth. Investments decrease less than in the standard BGG case,\nwhich stabilizes the price of capital and as a consequence entrepreneurs' net worth as well.\nInflation also falls less than in the two other cases. From this point of view longer average\nmaturities, as modelled, mitigate the accelerating mechanism following an unexpected\nmonetary policy shock.\nThe attenuation effect also becomes stronger for longer maturities in the case of the\nproductivity shock. A rise in the aggregate productivity raises the demand for cap-\nital. Thus, investment starts to grow and the price of capital rises. Consequently, en-\ntrepreneurs' net worth increases, which tends to lower the finance premium. Since inflation\nis reduced as a result of sunk marginal costs the risk-free rate is lowered in accordance\nwith the monetary policy rule. In the case of a longer average maturity this drop in the\nrisk-free rate initiates a strong rise in the price for bonds. As a result the finance premium\nwidens. Thus, less capital is built up and entrepreneurs' net worth is even depressed.\nUnlike the previous two cases, there are nearly no quantitative and qualitative effects\nfollowing a risk shock resulting from the average maturity on the dynamics except the\nbond price. The reason is that the risk shock dominates the behavior of the external\nfinance premium.\n5.3 Impact of frictions\nIn order to see how sensitive the propagation mechanism reacts on the severity of finan-\ncial frictions following the introduction of market-based debt, we vary the share \u00b5f that\ncontrols the monitoring costs. An increase in the share can be interpreted as an intensi-\nfication of the financial frictions. To present the pure effects stemming from the increase\nin monitoring costs related to the market price effect, we take the difference between the\nresponses from the modified model and the responses from the standard BGG model. The\nmaturity parameter is set to reflect the US experience. In Fig. 5, the x-axis presents the\nperiods following a shock while the y-axis provides the different values for the monitoring\ncosts. The z-axis gives then the differences in responses between the models, as described,\nof selected variables for each combination. We draw on the finance premium, net worth\nand output for the three already treated shocks. Responses on the monetary shock can\nbe found in the first row, on the productivity shock in the middle row and on the risk\nshock in the third row.\nAs can be seen the maturity effect, i.e. the attenuation, becomes stronger for more\n14Note that the magnitude of the original shock, and therefore the trajectory of the interest rate, are\nnearly identical across the cases.\ntime\nFinance premium\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nNet worth\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nOutput\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nFinance premium\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nNet worth\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nOutput\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nFinance premium\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nNet worth\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\ntime\nOutput\n\u00b5f\nImpulse response\nFigure 5: Impact of Financial Frictions on Propagation Mechanism - Monetary Policy\nShock (first row), Productivity Shock (middle row), and Risk Shock (last row)\nNote: The Figure shows the difference in responses between the modified model and the\nstandard BGG model on specific shocks.\nintensified financial frictions. Compared to the standard BGG model net worth raises\nmore and causes the finance premium to drop by more if financial frictions are intensified.\nAs a consequence the fall in output is strongly attenuated for higher degrees of financial\nfrictions. A similar result is also true for the productivity shock. The increase in net worth\nis sharply dampened which results in a stronger rise in the finance premium. Consequently,\nthe rise in output is attenuated. Even in the case of the risk shock, an attenuation effect\narises for higher degrees of financial frictions. Net worth decreases by less which mitigates\nthe increase in the finance premium. The reason for these results can be seen in Eq. (12).\nIn the standard BGG case the risk finance premium depends on the risk-free rate while\nit depends in the modified model on the risk-free bond return which is determined by the\nbond price. Bond prices react more strongly following the inital shock for more intensified\nfinancial frictions so that they affect net worth to a greater extent.\n6 Conclusion\nWe modified the standard BGG model embedded in a medium-sized DNK model to allow\nfor market-based debt instruments that have a price. Our results show that, compared to\nthe standard BGG framework, countervailing effects can occur due to the price component\nin debt instruments. This result crucially depends on the average maturity of the bond\nportfolio. By introducing bond prices, it is assumed that debt must be repaid at market\nprices every period. Price changes will then contribute positively to the finance premium\nbecause the ability to service the debt is affected. The use of the period return leads to\ndifferent dynamics, particularly when the average maturity of the bonds is long, because\nmore debt must be prolonged every period. As opposed to longer maturities, shorter\nmaturities tend to produce similar quantitative and qualitative dynamics to those obtained\nby the standard BGG case because the price effect vanishes. Nevertheless, we take the\nperspective of the investor in our model which means that the investor does not hold\nbonds until maturity by drawing on the formulation in Woodford (2001). Related to this\nfact the channel for entrepreneurs results. It would be of interest to take the perspective\nof the entrepreneurs which requires a further modification of the model.\nIn a broader sense, our results could explain why the financial accelerator, captured\nby the link between credit spreads and economic activity, seems to have broken down in\nthe USA (De Pace and Weber, 2013). If a prolongation risk becomes apparent, it could\nalready affect current yield spreads. This might be particularly relevant in an economic\nrecovery while the financial sector is still under stress. In cases where maturities matter,\nour results correspond to the findings of Andreasen et al. (2013). As opposed to them,\nhowever, we do not draw on maturity transformation, but it would be interesting to extend\nour model in this respect.\nReferences\nAndreasen, M. M., M. Ferman, and P.
