The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was\n7.7%. After adjustment for diabetes risk factors and markers of seafood intake, par-\nticipants with type 2 diabetes had a 26% higher level of total arsenic (95% confi-\ndence interval [CI], 2.0%-56.0%) and a nonsignificant 10% higher level of dimeth-\nylarsinate (95% CI, -8.0% to 33.0%) than participants without type 2 diabetes, and\nlevels of arsenobetaine were similar to those of participants without type 2 diabetes.\nAfter similar adjustment, the odds ratios for type 2 diabetes comparing participants at\nConclusions After adjustment for biomarkers of seafood intake, total urine arsenic\nwas associated with increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. This finding supports the\nhypothesis that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water, a wide-\nspread exposure worldwide, may play a role in diabetes prevalence.

The\nnumber of participants with diabetes\nwas 93 (73 with a prior diagnosis). Gly-\ncated hemoglobin was measured by a\nboronate affinity high-performance liq-\nuid chromatography system and con-\nverted to A1C\nOther Variables\nQuestionnaire information included\nsex, age, race, and ethnicity; educa-\ntional, smoking, and alcohol consump-\ntion status; and dietary recall inter-\nviews for the past 24 hours using an\nautomatedmultiplepassmethod.29 Race\nand ethnicity were based on self-\nreport, which allowed for multiple op-\ntions and were subsequently catego-\nrized by the National Center for Health\nStatistics as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American,\nother Hispanic, and other.

To assess\nnonlinear relationships, we estimated\nORs comparing tertiles 2 and 3 to the\nlowest tertile of the arsenical distribu-\ntion, as well as ORs based on restricted\nquadratic splines with knots at the 5th,\nAlthough we restricted the analyses\nto participants who did not report sea-\nfood intake in the past 24 hours, we\ncould not remove all the contribution of\norganic arsenic exposure to total urine\narsenic--possibly due to complex me-\ntabolism and excretion of organic ar-\nseniccompounds,incompletedietaryre-\ncall of all seafood sources, and potential\npresence of arsenobetaine and arseno-\nsugars in unknown sources. We were\nprimarily interested in evaluating the re-\nlationship of diabetes with exposure to\ninorganic arsenic; therefore, our pri-\nmary assessment of exposure was total\nurine arsenic concentration adjusted for\nobjective biomarkers of seafood con-\nsumption(arsenobetaineandbloodmer-\ncury). Measures of other organic ar-\nsenic compounds derived from seafood,\nsuch as arsenosugars, arsenolipids, and\ntheir metabolites, are technically chal-\nlenging and were not available.\nOur linear and logistic regression\nmodels for total urine arsenic concen-\ntrationsanddiabetesendpointswerefit-\nted with increasing degrees of adjust-\nment.First,weadjustedforsex,age,race\nand ethnicity (known determinants of\ndiabetes that may be related to arsenic\nexposure), and urine creatinine. Sec-\nond,eachmodelwasfurtheradjustedfor\neducation, body mass index, serum co-\ntinine,anduseofantihypertensivemedi-\ncation. This model represents the asso-\nciation of total arsenic exposure with\ndiabetes independent of the source but\nadjusted for traditional diabetes risk fac-\ntors. Third, each model was further ad-\njustedforurinearsenobetaineandblood\nmercury levels. This model provides es-\ntimates for the association of inorganic\narsenic not derived from seafood and for\narsenobetaine. Further adjustment for\nsmoking status and alcohol intake, as\nwell as exclusion of participants show-\ning levels below the limit of detection,\ndid not modify the observed associa-\ntions (results not shown). We followed\nsimilar analytical strategies to evaluate\ntherelationshipsofdimethylarsinateand\narsenobetaine with type 2 diabetes.\nTo evaluate the consistency of the\nfindings by participant characteris-\ntics, we estimated the ratio of geomet-\nric mean total arsenic concentrations by\ncomparing participants with type 2 dia-\nbetes with participants without type 2\ndiabetes for subgroups defined by sex,\nage, race and ethnicity, education, body\nmass index, and smoking status.\nRESULTS\nThe median urine levels in the study\npopulation were 7.1 \u00b5g/L for total ar-\nsenic, 3.0 \u00b5g/L for dimethylarsinate, and\n0.9 \u00b5g/L for arsenobetaine (for SI con-\nversion from \u00b5g/L to \u00b5mol/L, multiply\nsex,age,race,andurinecreatinine,urine\nlevels of total arsenic, dimethylarsinate,\nand arsenobetaine were substantially\nhigheramongparticipantscategorizedas\nblack,MexicanAmerican,andotherrace\norethnicityandinparticipantswithhigh\nblood mercury levels.

First, our analysis was limited\nbyarelativelysmallsamplesizebecause\nin just a random third of survey par-\nticipants. Second, the study is cross-\nsectionalandtemporalitybetweenurine\narsenic levels and diabetes develop-\nment cannot be completely ensured. It\nis unknown if diabetes alters the excre-\ntion and metabolism of arsenic. Pro-\nspectiveepidemiologicstudiesinpopu-\nlations exposed to a wide range of\ninorganic arsenic are needed to con-\nfirm this association. Third, because of\nitsrelativelyshorthalf-life,urinearsenic\nmay not reflect long-term exposure. In\nthe absence of public health interven-\ntions, however, arsenic concentra-\ntions in drinking water are relatively\nstable over time,46-48 resulting in steady\nurine arsenic levels. Indeed, repeated\nurine samples in populations with low-\nseafood intake have shown relatively\nconstant urine arsenic levels over time\nreflecting ongoing chronic exposure to\ninorganicarsenicfromdrinkingwater.49\nFourth, the high limits of detection for\narsenite, arsenate, and methylarsonate\n(species that more readily reflect expo-\nsuretoinorganicarsenic),precludedthe\nuse of those species in the analyses. For\ntotal arsenic, dimethylarsinate, and\narsenobetaine, the relatively high coef-\nficients of variation, limits of detec-\ntion,orbothcouldhaveresultedinsub-\nstantial misclassification and potential\nunderestimation of the associations.\nOtherlimitationsincludetheuseofspot\nurine samples and the need to adjust\nforurinecreatininelevelstoaccountfor\nurine dilution and the possibility of\nresidual confounding by geographical\nlocation or by urbanization.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found a positive association be-\ntween total urine arsenic, likely reflect-\ning inorganic arsenic exposure from\ndrinkingwaterandfood,withthepreva-\nlence of type 2 diabetes in a population\nwith low to moderate arsenic expo-\nsure. Together with the experimental\nand epidemiologic evidence support-\ning a diabetes effect for high levels of ar-\nsenic exposure, these findings rein-\nforce the need to evaluate the role of\ninorganic arsenic in diabetes develop-\nment in high-quality prospective stud-\nies conducted in populations exposed to\na wide range of arsenic levels.\nFrom a public health perspective,\nconfirmation of a role for arsenic in dia-\nbetes development would add to the\nconcerns posed by the carcinogenic,\ncardiovascular, developmental, and re-\nproductive effects of inorganic arsenic\nstantially modify risk assessment and\nrisk-benefit analyses estimating the con-\nsequences of arsenic exposure. Given\nwidespread exposure to inorganic ar-\nsenic from drinking water worldwide,\nelucidating the contribution of ar-\nsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a pub-\nlic health research priority with poten-\ntial implications for the prevention and\ncontrol of diabetes.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Navas-Acien had full ac-\ncess to all of the data in the study and takes respon-\nsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy\nof the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Navas-Acien, Silbergeld,\nGuallar.\nAcquisition of data: Navas-Acien.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Navas-Acien,\nSilbergeld, Pastor-Barriuso, Guallar.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Navas-Acien, Silbergeld,\nPastor-Barriuso, Guallar.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Navas-Acien, Silbergeld,\nPastor-Barriuso, Guallar.\nStatistical analysis: Navas-Acien, Pastor-Barriuso,\nGuallar.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nNavas-Acien.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This work was supported by grant\nmental Health Sciences Center in Urban Environmen-\ntal Health.\nRole of the Sponsor: The National Institute of Envi-\nronmental Health Sciences Center in Urban Environ-\nmental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School\nof Public Health played no role in the design and con-\nduct of the study; collection, management, analysis,\nand interpretation of the data; and preparation, re-\nview, or approval of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\n1.
