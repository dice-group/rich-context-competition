Cereals are\nmajor sources of energy, proteins, and other nutrients.1,2\nWhole grains, refined cereals, dried peas, and beans differ\nfrom each other in their structural and physicochemical\nproperties, and their physiological effects. These differ-\nences result from variations in their polysaccharides\ncomposition and, more specifically, in the quantity and\nvariety of dietary fibers and starch.1 In addition, protein\ncontent and the amount of phytochemicals, vitamins,\nminerals, and other bioactive components present play a\nrole in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).1 The\nbeneficial effects of whole grains on the prevention and\nmanagement of chronic diseases (such as coronary heart\ndisease, diabetes, high blood pressure, inflammation, and\ncancer) were reported in observational and interventional\nIn Jordan, the staple foods are wheat and rice. Khobez, a\nleavened flat wheat bread (pita bread), is consumed daily\nwith most meals and often used to scoop other foods.5 The\nper capita supply of cereals, which consists mainly of wheat\nand, to a much lesser extent of rice, has remained rather sta-\nble since the early 1980s. Within this food group, the supply\nof rice tends to increase slightly over the period.5 Boiled rice\ncould be eaten plain, spicy, or with sauces. Also, many veg-\netables (green beans, okra, cauliflower, eggplants, spinach,\netc) are usually cooked or served with rice.5 Epidemiological,\n1The Hashemite University, Zarqa, Jordan\n2Qatar University, Doha, Qatar\n3King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan\n4Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nHiba A.

Bani-Hani, PhD1\n Keywords\ncolorectal cancer, whole grains, refined cereals, legumes\nclinical, and animal research studies have indicated that\npolyphenols and fibers (from whole grains and legumes)\nmay exert a protective effect against colon cancer.6-9\nCereals (either whole or refined) and legumes are the\nmain components of the Jordanian diet in which wheat is\nthe predominant type of cereals.5,10 The type of wheat con-\nsumed in Jordan and Middle East is the hard red winter\nwheat.11 Refined and whole wheat breads are commonly\nproduced from this type of wheat after processing.11\nUnfortunately, the Jordanian population consumption of\nrefined red wheat flour bread was estimated to be about 326\ng/d, while the consumption of the whole grain type was\nabout 3 g/d.10 Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the\npossible association between whole grains, refined cereals,\nand legumes intake and the risk of developing CRC in\nJordanian population.\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Population and Methods\nCRC cases, and 281 were healthy disease-free controls.\nParticipants were enrolled in the study from January 2010\nto December 2012. Those diagnosed with CRC were\nrecruited from 5 large Jordanian hospitals (King Hussein\nCancer Center, King Abdullah University Hospital, Prince\nHamzeh Hospital, Jordan University Hospital, and\nAl-Basheer Hospital) with oncology services. For inclu-\nsion in the diagnosed CRC cancer group, subjects must\nhave obtained their diagnosis less than 1 year prior to the\ntime of the first interview in addition of being Jordanian\naged 18 years or older. Cases were excluded if they had a\ncritical illness, if they were currently hospitalized, or if\nthey complained of diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and\nrheumatoid arthritis. To be included in the study as a con-\ntrol, volunteers had to be Jordanian aged 18 years or\nolder, apparently healthy, able to communicate clearly\nand verbally, free of CRC, diabetes mellitus, liver dis-\nease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Because it was very diffi-\ncult to enroll anyone outside the hospital setting, most of\nthe controls were selected using convenience sampling\nfrom visitors and accompanying individuals (friends, rel-\natives, or neighbors) who were not first- or second-degree\nrelative or spouse of the CRC cases. In addition, outpa-\ntients and hospital administrative staff were recruited.\nThe control group was matched as closely as possible for\nage, gender, occupation, and marital status. The ratio for\ncases against controls was 1:1.\nThe ethical committees of all 5 hospitals approved the\nstudy protocol, and written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants prior to starting the study. The study\nprotocol was approved by the King Hussein Cancer Center\nInstitutional Review Board Committee (09 King Hussein\ntheir approval accordingly.\nData Collection\nTrained research assistants collected the data through a\nstructured questionnaire and carried out the anthropometric\nmeasurements. During the interview, different valid ques-\ntionnaires were used to collect personal and family histo-\nries, diet history, and physical activity levels. Participants\nwere asked specifically if any of their family members were\never diagnosed with CRC or any other type of cancer. The\nanthropometric measurements, including body weight and\nheight and calculating body mass index (BMI), were carried\nout according to Lee and Nieman12 by the trained research\nassistants.\nFood Frequency Questionnaire\nA validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in Arabic\nwas used to assess the diets of the volunteers. The FFQ was\nmodified from the Diet History Questionnaire I of the US\nNational Cancer Institute. It was validated for use in the\nJordanian setting.13\nFor the CRC group, participants were asked about their\nfood intake before being diagnosed and during the past 12\nmonths. For each food type, the participants were asked\nwhether they consumed each food item separately (eg, rice,\nbulgur, cornflakes, white beans, etc). An answer in the affir-\nmative resulted in additional questions related to frequency\nand amount of food consumed. If the participants' diet did\nnot include a food type, then related questions were skipped.\nParticipants were asked how frequently, on average during\nthe past year, they consumed 1 standard serving of a spe-\ncific food item in 9 different categories (<1 per month, 2-3\nday, 2-3 per day, 4-5 per day, or 6 per day). Food models\nand standard measuring tools were used to help participants\nestimate the portion size they consumed. Responses on con-\nsumption frequency of a specified serving size for each\nfood item were converted into average daily intake rates.13\nDietary intakes were also analyzed using dietary analysis\nsoftware (ESHA Food Processor SQL version 10.1.1;\nESHA, Salem, OR) with additional data on foods consumed\nThe 7-Day Physical Activity Recall\nThe 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) was originally\ndeveloped by Sallis et al15 and was used in this study to\nmeasure physical activity level.16 The PAR interview\nfocuses on collecting data on intensity, time or duration, and\ntype of activity. The number of hours spent in different\nactivity levels were obtained and converted into metabolic\nequivalents (METs). PAR covers different levels of physical\nactivity and intensity such as aerobic exercise, work-related\nactivities, gardening, walking, recreation, and leisure-time\nactivities. Average METs for walking = 3.3 METs, for mod-\nerate activity = 4.0 METs, for vigorous activity = 8.0 METs.\nThe score expressed as MET-min per week was calculated\nas (MET level \u00d7 minutes of activity/day \u00d7 days per week).\nTotal Physical Activity MET-minutes/week is obtained by\nMETs summation and categorized as inactive below 600\nMET min/wk, minimally active and Health Enhancing\nPhysical Activity (HEPA) active.15\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive analyses were conducted to examine the fre-\nquency of different variables. The consumption of whole\ngrains (bread and bulgur), refined cereals (bread, rice, corn-\nflakes, and macaroni), and legumes (lentils, green beans,\nand peas) were computed in 2 ways. The first computation\nwas based on the frequency of consumption of each food\ntype (daily, weekly, monthly, and rarely). The second cate-\ngory was based on the time that food usually consumed\n(never, 1/4 the meals, 1/2 the meals, and all the meals).\nAdditionally, consumption was grouped into 2 separate cat-\negories based on the number of servings consumed daily:\n1.0 serving per day and 2 servings per day. In all catego-\nries, the referent group had the lowest intake. Logistic\nregression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR), CI, linear\nregression, and P value for trend with age (continuous), sex,\nBMI (continuous), physical activity level (continuous),\ntotal energy intake (continuous), red meat consumption,\noccupation, education level, marital status, and family his-\ntory for the CRC participants were evaluated as potential\nconfounders.17 Chi-square was used to detect the differ-\nences among categorical variables. The significance level\nwas set at P < .05. All statistical analyses were conducted in\nSPSS version 19.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM\nCorporation).\nResults\nTable 1 shows the distribution of risk factors for the study\nparticipants. Colorectal cancer and control subjects were\nmatched for several parameters, including age, sex, occupa-\ntion, and marital status. Table 2 shows the adjusted odds\nratio (AOR) and 95% CIs for whole grains and legumes.\nThe results obtained indicate that the risk for developing\nCRC is significantly associated with consuming whole\ngrain versus refined breads at all meals.

Results\nof this study indicated that higher consumption of refined\ncereals and white bread is associated with higher CRC risk.\nThe current study also showed that higher intake of whole\ngrains and legumes is associated with lower risk for develop-\ning CRC. These findings are in agreement with observations\nreported in previous studies conducted in Europe, South\nAmerica, and Asia18-22 in which researchers reported that the\nrisk for developing CRC was higher among individuals who\nconsumed their carbohydrates as rice, white bread, and pasta\nas compared with individuals who consumed their carbohy-\ndrates as whole grain cereals.18-22 In a case-control study con-\nducted in northern Italy involving 339 cases of colon cancer,\n236 cases of rectal cancer, and 778 controls, a positive asso-\nciation was observed with frequent consumption of starchy\nfood (pasta or rice) with relative risk of 3 for colon cancer\nand 1.8 for rectal cancers in highest versus lowest tertiles.23\nAnother case-control study was conducted in Italy in that\nwith histologically confirmed incidences of cancer of the\nquintiles. Researchers interpreted their results through the\ndetrimental effect of refined carbohydrates in the etiology of\ntion of refined cereals was associated with higher risk of can-\ncers of the large bowel with ORs for the highest tertile of\nrefined cereal intakes 1.5 for colon cancer and 1.3 for cancer\nof the rectum.25 Asystematic review and dose-response meta-\nanalysis of prospective studies done by Aune et al26 showed\nthat the summary relative risk of developing CRC from con-\nsuming 10 g daily of total dietary fiber (n = 16 studies) was\nadditional 3 servings daily of whole grains (n = 6 studies)\nThe protective effect of whole grains against risk of\ndeveloping CRC could be attributed to nutrients and phy-\ntochemicals content of whole grains including dietary\nfibers, resistant starch, oligosaccharides escaping from\ndigestion in the small intestine and then being fermented\nin the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore,\nwhole grains are rich in antioxidants, including trace min-\nerals and phenolic compounds. These phenolic compounds\nmay exert a preventive effect in the disease process.\nAdditionally, whole grains may mediate insulin and glu-\ncose responses.27,28 Thus, refined grains and white bread\nare classified as high glycemic index foods. Consuming\nfoods with high glycemic index may lead to chronic hyper-\nglycemia and obesity-induced insulin resistance resulting\nin hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia may stimulate\nproliferation and promote metastasis of malignant colonic\nepithelial cells by increasing the bioactivity of insulin-like\ncohort study involving Chinese women suggest that no\nassociation exist between a diet characterized by high gly-\ncemic index, glycemic load, or by a high intake of carbo-\nhydrates with the risk of developing CRC.32\nIn an earlier study by Slattery et al,33 it was reported that\nrefined grain products were associated with higher risk of\n40% overall, with a P value chi-square test for the threshold\neffect of 0.01.33 There was also a significant interaction\nbetween sex and refined grain intake (P < 0.05).

Egeberg et al34 conducted a cohort\nstudy to investigate the association between consumption of\nwhole grain products and colon and rectal cancer.34 This\nassociation was prospectively examined using data on 461\nincident cases of colon cancer and 283 incident cases of rec-\ntal cancer that developed during 10.6 years of follow-up\nDiet, Cancer, and Health cohort. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs)\nof colon and rectal cancer related to total or individual whole\ngrain product intake were calculated using Cox regression.34\nThe results of the study revealed that higher whole grain\nproduct intake was associated with lower risk of colon can-\ncer and rectal cancer in men. The adjusted IRR (95% CI)\nfor rectal cancer per daily 50-g increment in intake. For\ncolon cancer, the association was confined to intake of whole\ngrain bread, in particular. No consistent associations between\ntotal or individual whole grain product consumption and\ncolon or rectal cancer risk were observed in women.34\nA large population-based Scandinavian cohort study\n000 Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian\npersons, of whom 1123 developed CRC during a median\nof 11 years of follow-up was conducted to trace the asso-\nciation between the daily intake of whole grain products\n(wheat, rye, and oats) and the incidence of CRC using\nCox proportional hazards models.35 Intake of whole grain\nproducts was found to be associated with a lower inci-\nwith a lower incidence of CRC (IRR for highest vs lowest\ntical significant linear trend was observed (P\n-Trend\nOn the other hand, no significant association was found\nfor whole grain rye or oats.35 Contrary to the previous\nstudies, 1 recent study revealed that wheat class (red vs\nwhite) and not the state of refinement (whole vs refined),\nappears to influence colon cancer risk, with hard red\nwheat protective relative to soft white wheat.36 Thus, epi-\ndemiological associations of reduced colon cancer risk\nwith whole grain consumption may actually reflect differ-\nent wheat classes.36 However, the only available and con-\nsumed type of wheat in Jordan is red hard winter wheat\nbut still the incidence of CRC is increasing. One of the\nsuggested underlying mechanisms of action for the pro-\ntective effect of whole grains against CRC is the effects\nof fibers on reducing glycemic load and improving insu-\nlin resistance, influenced by IGF-1.37 IGF-1 is known to\nstimulate cell proliferation; increase production of vascu-\nlar endothelial growth factor, an angiogenic factor, which\nsupports tumor growth; and inhibit apoptosis in healthy\nand cancerous colon epithelial cells as well.38\nStudy Limitations\nDietary recall data in cases may be different from controls\nas data was collected after diagnosis of the disease.\nMeasuring dietary intakes using FFQ is vulnerable to\nmemory errors. However, using a validated FFQ may\ndecrease these possible errors. Nevertheless, the impact\nof cooking on bioavailability of different nutrients was\nnot counted for. As with the other case control studies,\nselection and recall biases may have affected the study\nresults. Selection bias may have affected the results as\ncontrols were selected by convenience sampling from\nhospital personnel, outpatients, visitors, and accompany-\ning persons and not from the general population. Finally,\nthe sample size is rather small, although the CRC cases\nwere recruited from 5 different large hospitals between\nsmall country with an estimated population in 2009 that\n000, it was difficult to recruit more cases\ngiven that the overall age-standardized incidence CRC\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, results of this study suggest that whole grains\nand legumes may exert a protective effect against CRC\ndevelopment. Because of the globalization and changes in\ndietary patterns toward the western dietary pattern, whole\ngrains were replaced by refined cereals in Middle Eastern\ncountries. The present study shows how the type of cereal\nconsumed in Jordan and Middle Eastern countries could be\nassociated with developing CRC. These results may serve\nas an additional encouragement in the development of\nhealth promotional programs involving dietary factors as an\naid to reduce the risk of developing CRC in our Jordanian\npopulation. Further studies are recommended to investigate\nthe findings of the current study.\n"
