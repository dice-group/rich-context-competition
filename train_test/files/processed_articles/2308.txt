    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of bicycle-related injuries\npresenting to United States emergency departments (EDs).\nMethods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) database\nwas used to derive national, weighted estimates of nonfatal ED visits for bicycle-related injuries by\npatient age, sex, diagnosis, injured body part, locale of incident, traffic-relatedness of incident, and\nmonth of incident.\nResults: Males accounted for 73% of all bicycle-related injury ED visits. Patients aged 10 to 14 years\nrepresented the 5-year age interval with the highest rate of bicycle injury visits (488 per 10,000). Fifty-six\npercent of ED visits for bicycle-related injuries came from cyclists who were riding on the street, with\nincreased street ridership in those who were older than 15 years, and 99.7% of all patient injuries\noccurring on the street (as opposed to other locations) were related to motor vehicle collisions (MVCs).\nThe head and face were the most injured body parts in the overall population. In addition, the largest\nproportion of head injuries, relative to total injuries in the age group, occurred in the very young (0 to\n4 years) and elderly (65+ years) populations. The leading rider injury diagnoses were contusion,\nabrasions, and hematomas. The incidence of bicycle-related injuries peaked in the month of July.\nConclusions: The study identified the characteristics of bicycle-related injuries across various age groups\nof riders. This information will aid in developing more effective age-appropriate injury prevention\nstrategies. The frequency of MVC-related injuries deserves attention and suggests the need to examine\nstrategies for limiting interactions between moving vehicles and bicyclists.\nMedicine\nBicycle riding is a popular activity that has\nboth health and environmental benefits. In\nrecent years, with increases in traffic congestion1\nand the number of bike lanes,2 and installation of bicycle\nsharing systems,3 bicycling has become an increasingly\nviable and popular option for transportation. As a result,\nbicycle-related injuries may become more common\nemergency department (ED) presentations. Currently,\nsuch bicycling injuries have not been well characterized\nin the United States. Previous studies describing bicy-\ncling injuries have been limited by geographic location,4\u00ad\n6 type of injury,7,8 specific context (e.g., bike racing),9,10\nspecific injury trends (e.g., temporal trends),11 or older\ndata.12 More detailed information on biking injuries will\naid in identifying and implementing preventive strategies\nthat effectively target specific subsets of the population.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the epide-\nmiology of nonfatal bicycling-related injuries in the U.S.\npopulation presenting to U.S. EDs. This is the first\nlarge-scale national study to use data from the National\nElectronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Pro-\ngram (NEISS-AIP) to examine the incidence and charac-\nteristics of bicycle-related injuries treated in U.S. EDs.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using data from\nthe NEISS-AIP.

The\nNEISS-AIP collects data on nonfatal injuries treated in\nU.S. EDs, and each NEISS case is assigned an inverse\nprobability weight (IPW), which represents the inverse\nof the probability of the case being selected into the\nsample. These IPWs can be used to derive annual,\nweighted estimates of nonfatal injuries treated in EDs.\nWe reviewed patient data for all nonfatal bicycle inju-\nries occurring from January 1, 2001, through December\nStudy Protocol\nNEISS-AIP data include information on patient age and\nsex, injured body part, principal diagnosis, locale of\nincident, case disposition, immediate and precipitating\ncause, and sports/activity-relatedness. The NEISS-AIP\nalso collects data on traffic-relatedness, defining traffic-\nrelated injuries as those resulting from motor vehicle\ncollisions (MVCs) occurring on a public highway, street,\nor road. The NEISS-AIP defines nonfatal injury as bod-\nily harm resulting from severe exposure to an external\nforce, substance, or submission.\nnonfatal bicycle injury visits by patients of all ages. Only\ninjuries coded as \"8 \u00ad BICYCLE\" under the \"SPORTS\"\nvariable were used for the purposes of analysis. Even\nthough the code for an injury related to a bicycle falls\nunder the \"SPORTS\" variable, any bicycle injury (not\njust in a sports setting) was coded as \"8\" under the\n\"SPORTS\" variable. Using the national estimates, pro-\nportions of injuries were calculated by sex, age, injured\nbody part, diagnosis, locale of incidence, MVC-related-\nness (defined as a coding of \"yes\" to the variable for\n\"traffic-relatedness\"), disposition, and month of injury.\nAlong with the estimated data, raw data (the actual\nnumber of cases reported) were also reported in the\ntables under the columns labeled \"Sample Size.\" Census\ndata were used when calculating the number of injuries\nThe breakdown of injuries by specific body part was\ncalculated for separate age groups to determine body\nregions where each age group was more prone to\ninjury. In addition, the body parts with the highest inci-\ndences of injury within each age group were further\nbroken down by diagnosis to shed light on the severity\nof injuries to the body parts with higher incidences of\ninjury. Diagnoses of concussion and internal injury to\nthe head were reclassified as traumatic brain injury\n(TBI),13 and internal injuries to all other body parts were\nput into the \"other\" category.\nThere were no missing data for month of injury, and\nthere were minimal missing data for age (0.016%\nunknown); only cases with known ages were included\nin the analyses using percentage breakdown by age.\nMissing data for injured body part and diagnosis are\nlisted in the tables under categories of \"unknown\" and\n\"other,\" respectively. Missing data for locale (27%\nunknown) were treated as missing at random (MAR),\nso the percentage breakdown for the different locales\nof incident only took into account those cases with a\nrecorded locale. Similarly, missing data for MVC status\n(31% missing) were assumed to be MAR, so only the\ncases with observed MVC status were used to calculate\nthe percentage of ED visits precipitating from an\nData Analysis\nData analysis was performed with STATA 12 (Stata-\nCorp, College Station, TX), and the NEISS-assigned\nIPWs were applied using the pweight option under the\nsvy command.\nRESULTS\npatients of all ages. Bicycle injuries were the second\nlargest contributor to sports-related injury visits after\nbasketball, accounting for 12.7% of all sports injury vis-\nall bicycle injury visits. Patients aged 10 to 14 years\nrepresented the 5-year age interval with the highest\npercentage of bicycle injury visits (26%), and patients\naged 0 to 34 years accounted for 78% of all bicycle\nrelated visits (see Table 1).

Figure 1 shows the\nbreakdown of bike injuries by treatment month. The\n5-month range from May through September accounted\nfor 64% of all bike injuries, with incidence of bike injury\npeaking in July, which contained 12% of all bike\ninjuries.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined epidemiologic features of bicy-\ncling-related injuries seen in U.S. EDs from 2001\nhave the highest rate of injury, but their injuries were\nmore likely to occur off the street and were less likely to\nbe MVC-related when compared to the injuries to older\ncyclists 15 years and older. In contrast, the majority\n(70%) of all ED bicycle injuries to those 15 years and\nolder occurred on the street, and this percentage for the\noverall age range has been relatively constant from\nall injuries on the street involved collisions with motor\nvehicles. This suggests that in the last 10 years, even\nwith extensive promotion of bike lanes,14,15 there has\nbeen no decrease in MVC-related injuries on the street\nor in general.\nPercentage (95% CI) of Bicycle Injuries by Body Part\nBody Part\nAge (yr)\nof body\nMV = motor vehicle collision.\n*In each age group, the three most injured body parts are marked.\nThe body parts most commonly injured when the\ninjury involved a MVC were the head, upper trunk, and\nface. This finding has several implications for the pre-\nvention of bicycle injuries, particularly in the area of\nsafety gear recommendations and biking infrastructure.\nFirst, since upper trunk and face injuries are similar in\nfrequency to head injuries resulting from MVCs, bikers\non the street might receive additional protection\nthrough development of new safety gear, such as rigid\nprotective vests and facial protection. Numerous stud-\nies, along with current biking education, describe the\nimportance of helmet use,16\u00ad20 but they have not\nfocused on protection for the upper trunk or face,\nwhich have injury incidences nearly as high as the head\nfor cyclists on the street. Wearing gear such as rigid\nprotective vests and face shields may minimize injury to\nthe upper trunk (e.g., rib fractures, damage to internal\norgans, shoulder dislocations) and to the face (e.g., face\nlacerations). For children aged 10 to 14 years, the age\ngroup with the highest injury rate, wrist and hand inju-\nries were almost as prevalent as head injuries and face\ninjuries, suggesting that children might benefit from\ndevelopment of new safety gear such as gloves and\nwrist stabilizers for the hands and wrists, since these\nmight minimize injury to those body parts that are often\nfirst used to break a fall.\nOur findings have implications with regard to trans-\nportation infrastructure. Because 99.7% of bike injuries\nincurred on the street involve MVCs, traffic engineering\ninterventions might further minimize the interaction\nbetween bicyclists and motor vehicles. Previous studies\nhave shown that clearly marked, bicycle-specific facili-\nties (i.e., bike routes, bike lanes, and bike paths) provide\nincreased safety for cyclists compared to on-road\nLusk et al.26 reported that the relative risk of MVC-\nrelated injury was lower on cycle tracks (physically sep-\narated bicycle-exclusive paths along roads) compared\nwith bicycling in reference roads (a parallel road with\nthe same intersection frequency and cross-traffic).\nPercentages (95% CI) of Injury by Diagnosis for Frequently Injured Body Parts\nDiagnosis Head Face Wrist Hand Arm Upper Trunk Lower Trunk All Body Parts\nContusion/\nabrasion/\nhematoma\nFracture/\ndislocation\nTBI = traumatic brain injury.\n*TBI includes concussions (accounted for 18.2% of head injuries) and internal injuries (accounted for 47.5% of head injuries).\nLargest categories for each body part.\nPercentages of ED Visits by Locale of Injury\nLocale\n% of Estimated\nED Visits,\nFarm/industry/\nschool (2)\nNEISS-AIP = National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\nAll Injury Program.\n*Percentages were derived from weighted national estimates\nusing only data with known locale. Estimated ED visits n\ndoes not include observations with unknown locale, so n is\nunderestimated.\nActual number of injuries reported by NEISS-AIP.\nFurthermore, a study by Teschke et al.27 found that\ncyclists on cycle tracks had lower odds of injury\ncompared to those biking on streets with parked cars.\nTeschke et al. also found that cyclists biking on a major\nstreet with no parked cars had lower odds of injury\nthan those biking on a major street with parked cars.\nThese findings suggest implications for the revision of\ncurrent city transportation engineering guidelines\ntoward separating bicyclists from motor vehicles (both\nparked and moving) to decrease the risk of collisions\nbetween cyclists and motor vehicles.\nOther more immediate policy implementations that\nmay decrease bicycling-related injuries include revi-\nsions to licensing examinations and road training.\nPotential revisions for future study include placing\ngreater emphasis during driver's licensing road train-\ning and tests on performing \"head checks\" for cyclists\nprior to turning, changing lanes, and opening car\ndoors.\nOur finding that the 5-month range from May\nthrough September accounted for 64% of all bike-\nrelated injuries, with incidence of injury peaking in July,\nis consistent with the findings of Loder and Abrams.12\nThis information could be used to guide injury preven-\ntion programs to increase educational campaigns for\nwearing proper safety gear immediately before the\nincrease in cycling activity in the summer months.\nLIMITATIONS\nThe NEISS database does not provide patient data on\nseverity of injury or follow-up care, which prevented us\nfrom distinguishing the more severe bicycling injuries\nfrom the relatively minor ones. Second, the fact that\nonly bicycling injuries treated in EDs were included\nimplies that the total number of bicycling injuries is\nlikely to be underestimated and tends to represent the\nmore severe cases, as injuries that were treated at\nhome, in urgent care clinics, and in physician offices\nwere not reported. Third, the NEISS does not provide\ninformation on use of safety equipment by patients, so\nwe were unable to assess the effects of safety helmet\nuse (or nonuse) on head injury status. Fourth, because\nsome cases did not contain information on locale of\ninjury or MVC involvement, it is unknown in which\ndirection the cases with unreported information could\nhave caused bias.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that nearly three-fourths of\nbicycle injuries presenting to EDs in patients aged\n15 years and older are related to motor vehicle\ncollisions. The most injured body parts in motor vehicle\ncollision\u00adrelated injuries are the head, upper trunk, and\nface, suggesting that, in addition to the emphasis of\nproper helmet use, future research on the development\nof new safety gear (e.g., protective vests and face\nED Bicycle Injury Visits Involving MVCs and Occurring on the Street\nAge, yr\n% of ED Visits\nOccurring From\na Bicycle-MVC*\nNo. of Estimated\nInjuries Occurring From\nInjuries in Each Age Group\nSample Size for Injuries\nThat Occurred From an\nMVC\n% ED Visits for Bicycle\nInjuries That Occurred on\nthe Street\u00a7 (95% CI)\nMVC = motor vehicle collision.\n*Percentages are derived from the weighted national estimates using only cases with known MVC status.\nMethod of calculation: [(No. of estimated MVC injuries within age group)/(total No. of estimated bike injuries in the\nActual number of MVC injuries reported by NEISS-AIP.\n\u00a7Percentages are derived from weighted national estimates using only cases with known locale of incidence.\nFigure 1.
