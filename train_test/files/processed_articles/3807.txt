He looks at\nearlier attempts to relate literary analysis to science, especially in Roman Jakobson's\nhas been moved especially by the emergence of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s. He\nfocuses particular attention on E.O. Wilson's claims for the unity of the natural and social\nsciences and the humanities and arts (1998) and on Joseph Carroll's Evolution and Literary\nThe subject is timely and important: two already much-heralded books will appear\nthis season, Edward Slingerland's (2008) What Science Offers the Humanities: Integrating\nBody and Culture and Jon Gottschall's (2008) Literature, Science, and a New Humanities.\nAlas, Adams's book is neither timely nor important. Timeliness first: a worthy PhD,\nwritten mostly between 2000 and 2002, it needed much more work to become a book even\nfor an audience of specialists. Published in 2007, it fails to mention nearly all the work in\nevolution and literature published over the preceding fourteen years, including books by\nLiterary Animal (2005), edited by Gottschall and D.S. Wilson, as well as the fifty-plus\nthe field. Characteristically, Adams cites an article by Tony Jackson (2000) critical of\nStorey's (1996) Mimesis and the Human Animal, but does not list Storey's book itself in\nthe bibliography or refer to it except in a brief citation from Jackson. Adams really needed\nImportance next. An author writing on this subject surely ought to consider the\nInterference patterns\nmajor attempts to relate literary to scientific methods, and not just to select material he\nhappened to have noticed. Why devote a long discussion to the eccentric and issueless\nGeorges Polti? Why does Adams not mention the Russian formalists of the late 1910s and\n1920s (e.g. Shklovsky, 1980), and their attempt to create a scientific approach to literature,\nand their recent (1980s onward) descendants in both literature (especially Colin Martindale\nand others in the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature) (e.g.,\nMartindale, 1990) and in film (especially David Bordwell and his disciples like John\nAnderson, Ed Tan and Murray Smith) (e.g., Bordwell, 2008; Anderson and Fisher, 2005;\nTan, 1996; and Smith, 1995, respectively)? Why does he not do more than just mention the\nname of I.A. Richards (1929) in passing? Why not discuss Leo Spitzer's important 1948\nlinkage of the process of critical reading with the hypothetico-deductive method of science?\nIf Adams really wished to explore the possibilities of would-be scientific\napproaches to literature, he could have chosen, rather than exploring the main past\napproaches, to focus exclusively on what he thinks has become or is about to become the\ndominant current approach, literary Darwinism. He does give this some prominence--\nrightly, I think, because of the promise it shows. But there are at least three major problems\nin his treatment.\nFirst, he seems to believe that, where structuralism appeared to offer a means of\nuniting knowledge and therefore powerfully shaped literary theory and criticism, but failed,\nevolution also promises to unite the knowledge of living things and therefore may take over\nthe central role structuralism once played in literary theory. Adams seems even to believe\nthat this change is well under way. Those of us who hope such a change might come would\nbe delighted if that were the case, but have to acknowledge that although literary studies in\nthe Americas are in a crisis, few yet feel ready to consider evolution as the best path out of\nthe mire. Adams seriously misreads the current situation in literary studies.\nSecond, his attempted critique of the prospects of scientific and especially\nevolutionary approaches to literature rests on a woefully simple confusion. E.O. Wilson\nclaims in Consilience that scientific and humanistic explanation must be consilient, must\ntake physicalism as their foundation. But the fact that everything is ultimately physics does\nnot entail, for Wilson, Carroll, or anyone else interested in linking evolution and literature,\nthat physics is everything. Everything must be compatible with a physical explanation of\nthe world, but this does not preclude new properties emerging at higher degrees of\norganization and interaction: chemistry, life, thought, and art. Why should Adams suppose\nthat Wilson's work ultimately ousts intentionality when sociobiology depends on\ncompeting and cooperating intentions, or that evolutionary psychology has nothing to do\nwith minds, or that literary scholars would be remotely interested in consilience at that\nimagined cost?\nThis second flaw is decisive, but a third problem compounds it. Not only does\nAdams not know much of the work that has connected evolution and literature, but he\ncannot or does not try to imagine what such work might do. He seems to suppose only that\nit can collapse out intentionality. In fact it can offer a new poetics, a naturalistic theory of\nliterature, explaining why we are story-making animals and why we create and comprehend\nstories as we do. Or it can offer a new thematics, an examination of the subject matter of\nliterature that returns literary studies from the narrow focus on race, class or gender, or the\nInterference patterns\nsocial construction of this or that, to the whole range of human behavior depicted in\nliterature and explained in the cross-species, cross-cultural and deep-historical perspectives\nthat evolution makes possible. Or it can show how literature approached in a scientific\nspirit can supply qualitative and quantitative data for the understanding of human nature in\nspecific times and places or across time and place.\nAdams objects to a closer link between literature and the sciences especially\nbecause he accepts Richard Rorty's stress on the different questions that different\ndisciplines ask. But neither consilience nor an evolutionary approach to literature imperils\npluralism. Consilience requires only that all levels of explanation be compatible. A\nchemistry that asked only the same questions as physics would no longer be chemistry, but\nchemistry incompatible with physics would no longer be science. Neither Freudian\npsychoanalysis nor a biology-denying constructivism proves compatible with evolution or\nevidence, but within an evolutionary perspective on literature, the latter can be studied from\nmany different angles, so long as they are compatible with other empirical disciplines.\nWe can study literature from anthropological, economic, political, religious or\nsociological angles, but with evolution's power to explain multilevel selection and the\ncomplex interplay between competition and cooperation, we can explore sociality with far\ngreater depth and range. Or we can study literature from neurological or psychological\nangles, using all the temporal and physical breadth of evolution and all the temporal and\nphysical resolution of neuroscience. Or we can study literature as literature, as art, with all\nthe expertise of human readers, scholarship and traditions and where appropriate with all\nthe power of scientific method. For me personally that offers the greatest challenge and\npleasure of an evolutionary approach to literature: a return to literature as literature and to a\ndiscriminating, evidence-based and consilient pluralism. Such an approach loses nothing\nbut an indifference to evidence and gains a wide and complex world.\nReferences\nAnderson, J., and B. Fisher (Eds.). (2005).
