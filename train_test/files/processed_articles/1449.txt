    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Whether patient socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education)\nare independently associated with failure to receive indicated statin therapy and/or to achieve low density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) therapy goals are not known. We examined socio-demographic factors associated\nwith a) eligibility for statin therapy among those not on statins, and b) achievement of statin therapy goals.\nMethods: Adults (21-79 years) participating in the United States (US) National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys, 1999-2006 were studied. Statin eligibility and achievement of target LDL-C was assessed using the US\nThird Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) on Treatment of High Cholesterol guidelines.\nResults: Among 6,043 participants not taking statins, 10.4% were eligible. Adjusted predictors of statin eligibility\namong statin non-users were being older, male, poorer, and less educated. Hispanics were less likely to be eligible\nbut not using statins, an effect that became non-significant with adjustment for language usually spoken at home.\nAmong 537 persons taking statins, 81% were at LDL-C goal. Adjusted predictors of goal failure among statin users\nwere being male and poorer. These risks were not attenuated by adjustment for healthcare access or utilization.\nConclusion: Among person's not taking statins, the socio-economically disadvantaged are more likely to be\neligible and among those on statins, the socio-economically disadvantaged are less likely to achieve statin\ntreatment goals. Further study is needed to identify specific amenable patient and/or physician factors that\ncontribute to these disparities.\nBackground\nDisparities in the use of procedures by race, ethnicity,\nsex, and socioeconomic status (SES) have been widely\ndocumented including invasive cardiovascular interven-\ntions [1,2], joint replacement surgery [2,3], and other\nnew or expensive technology [4,5]. These disparities\nmay reflect either potential access (e.g. insurance or reg-\nular source of care) or realized access (visit number), [6]\nexpenses (often not fully covered by insurance)[7] in\naddition to slower diffusion of innovation to minority\npatients or possibly to physicians and hospitals serving\nIn contrast, there is considerably less evidence for dis-\nparity in use of drugs for common, chronic conditions\n[12]. For example, there are few racial and ethnic dispa-\nrities in inpatient medical management of congestive\nheart failure [13] and coronary artery disease [14] or in\noutpatient management of hypertension [15].\nStatins may be an exception. They may be used less\nfrequently among African Americans and poor patients\n[16-21] and these patients may be less likely to achieve\ntarget low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal\n[22,23]. These findings have been variously limited by\nabsence of cholesterol measurement, suboptimal SES\nmeasurement, and/or failure to fully apply the Third\nAdult Treatment Panel (ATP III) recommendations for\ntreatment of elevated LDL-C.\nUsing recent US national data that included details on\nLDC-C levels, statin use, socio-demographic characteris-\ntics including race/ethnicity and SES, and healthcare\naccess/utilization, three hypotheses were examined: 1)\namong persons not receiving statins, race/ethnicity, and\nlower SES would be associated with statin eligibility; 2)\namong persons currently receiving statins, race/ethnicity,\nand lower SES would be associated with lower likelihood\n* Correspondence: Kevin_Fiscella@URMC.rochester.edu\n4Departments of Family Medicine, Community & Preventive Medicine,\nUSA\n\u00a9 2010 Franks et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Survey data\nincluded household interviews, examinations, and test-\ning. Following the interview, participants were invited to\nmobile examination centers. The protocol for NHANES\nwas approved by the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nInstitutional Review Board. Informed consent was\nobtained from each participant. During the study period,\nthe response rate to the examination varied between 76-\nMeasures\nKey independent variables were demographics (self\nreported age, sex, and race/ethnicity) and SES (house-\npoverty level] and highest educational attainment [<12,\nStatin use was based on a series of questions about\nprescription drugs reported taken during the previous\nmonth. For each drug reported, verification was\nobtained by asking the participant to show the medica-\ntion container. Duration of use was also collected.\nStatin eligibility and goal attainment were assessed\nusing additional history, examination, and laboratory\ndata. History factors included: coronary heart disease\n(CHD), myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, peripheral\nvascular disease, diabetes, cigarette smoking, use of anti-\nhypertensive medication, and family history of CHD.\nAccess/utilization factors included: language usually\nspoken at home (English vs. other); health insurance sta-\ntus (any vs. none), availability of usual source of care\nper year).\nBlood pressure was recorded as the average of up to\ntwo mercury manometer measurements (the first mea-\nsurement was not included) obtained from the partici-\npant while sitting after a 5-minute rest [26]. Participants\nwere classified as having hypertension if they had a sys-\ntolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and/or dia-\nstolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more and/or they\nreported currently using antihypertensive medication.\nBlood samples were centrifuged and stored at -20\u00b0C\nand transferred to the Lipoprotein Analytical Laboratory\nat Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, for lipid\nanalyses. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured using\nthe Hitachi 704 Analyzer. LDL-C was calculated using\nthe Friedwald equation if triglycerides were <400 mg/dl.\nAssessment for Statin eligibility and Target LDL-C\nATP III recommendations from 2004 for LDL-C man-\nagement were used to assess statin eligibility and goal\nattainment [27,28]. Patients with no CHD or no CHD\nrisk equivalents (diabetes, stroke or peripheral vascular\ndisease) were scored on a count of major CHD risk fac-\ntors (cigarette smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C\n[<40 mg/dl], family history of premature CHD, and\nolder age [45  years for men; 55  y for women]);\nHDL-C 60 mg/dl or greater was considered protective\nand reduced the score by one. Participants with two or\nmore risk factors underwent FRS to derive absolute 10\nyear CHD risk.\nFor adults with 0-1 risk factors, the statin eligibility\nthreshold was an LDL-C  190 mg/dl with a treatment\ngoal of <160 mg/dl. For adults with 2+ risk factors, the\ntreatment goal was 130 mg/dl, with statin eligibility\nthresholds of 130 mg/dl for those with a 10-year CHD\nparticipants with CHD, CHD risk equivalents, or FRS\n>20%, the statin eligibility and treatment goal for LDL-C\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive, univariate, and regression analyses were\nconducted using STATA (version 10.1, StataCorp, Col-\nlege Station, TX), adjusting for the complex survey\ndesign of NHANES to yield population parameter esti-\nmates and appropriate standard errors. Logistic regres-\nsion analyses examined the relationship between the key\nsocio-demographic factors and: a) statin eligibility\namong those not on statins (the dependent variable was\nwhether the respondent was eligible for statin therapy\naccording to ATP criteria); and, b) goal attainment\namong those on statins (the dependent variable was\nwhether the LDL-C level was at goal). To address\nwhether access/utilization-related factors attenuated dis-\nparities, the analyses were conducted without and with\nadjustment for access/utilization-related factors. All ana-\nlyses adjusted for study year. Regression results are pre-\nsented as average marginal effects (AMEs), not adjusted\nodds ratios, to facilitate interpretation. The AME is the\nadjusted difference in prevalence of outcome (in %)\nbetween given category of predictor and its reference\ngroup.\nSupplementary and sensitivity analyses examined\nmodel fit and explored possible explanatory pathways,\nincluding examining two-way interactions among inde-\npendent variables, and adjusting for duration of statin\ntherapy (< 1 year vs.  1 year), statin potency (atorvasta-\ntin or rosuvastatin vs. less potent [doses were not avail-\nable]), and subject reported: prior testing for cholesterol;\nknowledge of cholesterol level; and doctor recommenda-\ntion for treatment. Additional analyses excluded those\nwith a history of liver disease (a possible contra-indica-\ntion for statins).\nResults\nAltogether, the NHANES surveys included 18,042 adults\n(91% population weighted) of the sample. Persons with\nmissing FRS information were more likely to be women\nother race (7% vs. 5%). LDL-C levels were collected on a\nwith FRS data; those without LDL-C were more likely to\nhave household incomes < 100% poverty level (13% vs.\n10%). Complete socio-demographic and LDL-C data\nwere available on 6,580 persons. Of those with complete\ndata, 537 (7.7%) reported current statin use. The charac-\nteristics of persons currently receiving compared to\nthose not receiving statins are shown in Table 1; those\nnot receiving statins were younger, poorer, disproportio-\nnately female, Black or Hispanic, lacked a usual source\nof care, had fewer visits, and were also more likely to\nhave been surveyed in earlier years (p all < .01).\nwere eligible but not taking statins. Table 1 (last col-\numn) shows the factors associated with being eligible;\nthese groups included: being older, male, non-Hispanic,\npoorer, less educated, uninsured, and having more visits\nLogistic regression analyses revealed the socio-demo-\ngraphic risk factors for being eligible (among those not\ntaking statins) included being older, male, having lower\nincome, and less education (Table 2). Hispanics were\nless likely to be eligible, an effect that became not signif-\nicant after adjustment for the access/utilization variables\n(primarily language). None of the other socio-demo-\ngraphic effects observed were significantly attenuated by\nadjustment for the access/utilization variables. Among\ntwo-way interactions, the gender*age group effect was\nsignificant; the gender disparity in eligibility increased\nwith age (Figure 1).\nTable 3 shows ATP III goal attainment among statin\nusers and non-users. Among the 537 persons taking sta-\ntins, 81.3% were at LDL goal. Goal attainment was less\nlikely in men and poorer persons (p all < .01). The logis-\ntic regression analyses revealed that goal attainment was\nassociated with being female and having higher income\n(Table 4); the effects of age, race/ethnicity, and educa-\ntion were not significant. There was no significant effect\nof the access/utilization variables. No interactions were\nstatistically significant.\nThe supplementary analyses of statin eligibility among\nthose not taking statins produced results similar to\nthose presented. These models adjusted for patients\nreporting cholesterol testing (69%), patient knowledge of\nown cholesterol level (23%), and patient reporting as to\nwhether the physician recommended treatment (8%);\nand, excluded those with a history of liver disease\nSupplementary analyses of goal attainment examined\nthe potential confounding effect of duration and potency\nof statin therapy. About 25% of respondents had been\non statins for < 1 year, but there was no evidence that\nduration of therapy predicted goal attainment (<1 year,\nsignificantly associated with goal attainment (p = 0.2),\nand did not affect the AMEs of the socio-demographic\nvariables.\nDiscussion\nAnalysis of this US nationally representative sample\nrevealed significant disparities in the use of statins.\nAdults eligible, but not taking statins, were more likely\nto be older, male, of lower income, and less educated.\nThe gender effect increased significantly with age.\nAmong patients currently receiving statins, being male\nand having less income were associated with failure to\nattain LDL-C goal.\nIn contrast to previous US studies that used limited\nincome adjustment [16-21], race/ethnicity was not sig-\nnificantly associated with statin eligibility or goal attain-\nment; the study discrepancies suggest the key role of\nincome.\nMuch of the US disparity literature has focused on\nrace and ethnicity. These results underscore the signifi-\ncance of sex and SES on appropriate use of statins and\non LDL-C goal attainment. Following a myocardial\ninfarction men are more likely to receive appropriate\ninterventions including angiography and revasculariza-\ntion [14]. However, men are more likely to be eligible,\nbut not taking statins, and less likely to be at goal if\ntreated. These findings, while contrasting with studies\nexamining gender differences in the use of invasive pro-\ncedures, are consistent with the notion that women may\nbe more effective users of ambulatory care than men\n[29], and with findings that among those with high cho-\nlesterol women are both more likely to be aware of their\ncondition [30] and more likely to be treated [21]. In\naddition, male sex and older age are included in FRS.\nThis effectively lowers treatment thresholds among men\nand older persons, possibly contributing to sex and/or\nage disparities.\nAmong untreated persons, those with less income and\nless education are more likely to be eligible. These\nfindings are consistent with previous studies showing\nthat low SES is associated with less adequate care\namong those with lower income [33-35]. These effects\nmay reflect barriers related to cost [36] and possibly\npatient beliefs [37].\nTable 1 Descriptive characteristics of sample (N = 6580), statin use, and statin eligibility among those not on statins\nTotal\nSample\nProportion of total sample\nProportion of total sample on\nProportion eligible of those not on\nAge group\nRace/Ethnicity\nFederal Poverty\nLevel\nEducation\nUsual Source of\nCare\nPhysician Visits\nEnglish Spoken at\nHome\nSurvey Year\nTable 2 Adjusted prevalence of statin eligibility among those not on statins (N = 6043), without (Model I) and with\n(Model II) adjustment for access/utilization\nModel I Model II\nSocial Risk Factor AME 95% CI P AME 95% CI P\nAge group\nRace/Ethnicity\nWhite (reference)\nFederal Poverty Level (%)\nEducation (years)\nNotes: AME = adjusted average marginal effect, adjusted % difference from reference group; CI = confidence interval.

This\nmay reflect a dominating effect of statin cost and lack\nof measures of usual source of primary care. At the\ntime of this study, most statins were expensive and\nhaving insurance (including Medicare during this era)\ndid not ensure prescription coverage. Even among\nthose with insurance, higher copayments, and\nformulary restrictions deter statin use [38,39]. Further-\nmore, physicians consider formulary restrictions and\npatient out-of-pocket costs when making prescribing\ndecisions [7,40]. However, it is worth noting that the\nfindings on SES disparities are consistent with studies\nfrom countries with more equitable health systems\n(less socio-economically driven access barriers) includ-\ning Australia [41] and Denmark[42]. Because these stu-\ndies did not adjust for FRS, and lower SES is\nassociated with a more adverse FRS profile [43] they\nlikely under-estimate disparities in statin use. Taken\ntogether, these studies are consistent with research on\nthe diffusion of new technologies, including statins,\nshowing lower SES persons lag behind in the uptake of\nthose new interventions [44].\nTable 3 Descriptive characteristics of sample by statin\nuse and goal attainment\nGoal Attainment by Statin Use\nNon-User\nUser\nAge group\nRace/Ethnicity\nEducation\nSurvey Year\nTable 4 Adjusted prevalence of being at LDL goal for\nthose on statins (N = 537), without (Model I) and with\n(Model II) adjustment for access/utilization\nModel I Model II\nSocial Risk\nFactor\nAge group\n(reference)\nRace/Ethnicity\nWhite\n(reference)\nFederal\nPoverty\nLevel (%)\n(reference)\nEducation\n(years)\n(reference)\nNotes: AME = adjusted average marginal effect, adjusted% difference from\nreference group; CI = confidence interval.

Source:\nThe protective Hispanic effect, i.e. a lower likelihood\nof Hispanics being eligible, and its attenuation with\nadjustment for language is consistent with studies\ndemonstrating Hispanics have better adjusted health sta-\ntus than Whites, a benefit that attenuates with greater\nGiven the powerful effects of statins on cardiovascular\nand all-cause mortality, these results are concerning.\nLess optimal management of cholesterol among men\nand lower SES persons may contribute to higher CHD\nmortality [48]. The under-treatment of lower SES\npatients may exacerbate their risk for higher CHD mor-\ntality and contribute to widening disparities in CHD\nmortality [48]. In addition, because FRS does not fully\naccount for the higher CHD risk in lower SES persons,\nfewer lower SES persons are identified for treatment\nthan warranted [48]. Thus, lower SES persons may be at\ntriple jeopardy: under-identified for treatment, under-\ntreated once identified as eligible, and less likely to\nachieve treatment goals.\nThere are several potential explanations for the overall\nfindings. Differences in statin eligibility among untreated\npatients could reflect physician and/or patient factors.\nHowever, an analysis adjusting for whether or not per-\nsons reported their physician recommended treatment\nproduced similar results. The absence of an apparent\neffect of physician recommendation suggests that patient\nfactors including acceptance of prescriptions for statins\nor differences in adherence barriers such as cost may\ncontribute to higher rates of statin eligibility among the\nuntreated. The overall low rate of physician recommen-\ndation among untreated patients (probably related in\npart to sequencing conditional questions), and potential\nbias in respondent recall of physician recommendations\nsuggests caution in inferring an absence of physician\ncontribution to these disparities. Further study is needed\nto determine the relative roles of patient factors (e.g.\ncost or beliefs) or physician factors (failure to adhere to\nguidelines) in contributing to these disparities. Doing so\nwill facilitate the design of interventions to mitigate\nthese disparities.\nStudy Limitations\nThese finding are limited by reliance on cross-sectional\ndata. The data provide no direct information on pre-\ntreatment cholesterol levels, drug doses, or number of\ntimes that physicians intensified therapy. Thus, the\nappropriateness of statin use among users cannot be\nprecisely determined. For example, over-treatment of\nnon-Hispanic Whites could have reduced the pool of\nuntreated persons, masking racial differences. Variables\nselected to assess access/utilization may not optimally\ncapture the underlying constructs. Thus, language\nusually spoken at home may not adequately capture\naccess related to English proficiency; however, this vari-\nable performed similarly to one indicating interview lan-\nguage or use of interpreter. Last, we lacked data related\nto statin dose or cost. Some of those on statins achiev-\ning treatment goals may have been at goal without treat-\nment. Limited sample size for some analyses,\nparticularly assessing goal attainment for persons on sta-\ntins, may have compromised power to detect significant\neffects.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, these US national data show that, among\npersons not taking statins, those with less income and\nmen are more likely than their respective counterparts\nto be eligible, and, among those taking statins, these\ngroups are also less likely to attain their LDL-C goal.\nFurther study is needed to identify specific amenable\npatient and/or physician factors that contribute to these\ndisparities.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthor details\n1Center for Healthcare Policy and Research and Department of Family &\nCommunity Medicine, University of California at Davis, 4860 Y Street, Suite\nResearch and Department of Pediatrics University of California at Davis, 2103\nFamily Medicine, University of Rochester; 1381 South Ave, Rochester, NY\n14620, USA. 4Departments of Family Medicine, Community & Preventive\nMedicine, Oncology, University of Rochester; 1381 South Ave, Rochester, NY\nAuthors' contributions\nPF designed study, conducted analyses, interpretation of data and led\nwriting.
