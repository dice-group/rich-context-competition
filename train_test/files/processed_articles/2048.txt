Our results suggest several\nfindings that add to the complexity and\nresearch and its relation\nto diabetes, and offer new insight into the\nsupplements. Our data\nconfirm the relationship between metfor-\nmin and reduced serum B12\nlevels beyond\nthe background prevalence of biochemical\ndeficiency. Our data demonstrate that\n, which in-\ncludes the dose most commonly found\nin over-the-counter multivitamins, was as-\nsociated with a two-thirds reduction of\ndeficiency and borderline\ndeficiency among adults without diabetes.\nThis relationship has been previously re-\nported with NHANES and Framingham\npopulation data (4,29). In contrast, we\nwas as-\nsociated with a decrease in the prevalence\ndeficiency or borderline\ndeficiency among adults with type 2 diabe-\ntestakingmetformin.Thisobservationsug-\ngests that metformin reduces serum B12\nby a mechanism that is additive to or dif-\nferent from the mechanism in older adults.\nIt is also possible that metformin may ex-\nacerbate the deficiency among older adults\n. Our sample size wastoo\nsmall to determine which amount .6 mg\nwas associated with maximum protection,\nbut we did find a dose-response trend.\nWe were surprised to find that those\nwith type 2 diabetes not using metformin\nhad the lowest prevalence of biochemical\ndeficiency. It is possible that these\nindividuals may seek medical care more\nfrequently than the general population\nand therefore are being treated for their\ndeficiency. Or perhaps,\nbecause this population had a longer du-\nration of diabetes and a higher proportion\nof insulin users compared with metformin\nusers, they have been switched from met-\nformin to other diabetic treatments due\nconcentrations or un-\ncontrolled glucose levels and these new\ntreatments may increase serum B12\ncon-\ncentrations. Despite the observed effects\nof metformin on serum B12\nlevels, it re-\nmains unclear whether or not this reduc-\ntion is a public health concern. With\nlifetime risks of diabetes estimated to be\none in three and with metformin being a\nfirst-line intervention, it is important to in-\ncrease our understanding of the effects of\non metformin-associated\nThe strengths of this study include\nits nationally representative, population-\nbased sample, its detailed information on\nsupplementusage,anditsrelevantbiochemi-\ncal markers. This is the first study to use a\nnationally representative sample to examine\nthe association between serum B12\nconcen-\ntration, diabetes status, and metformin use\nas well as examine how this relationship\nmay be modified by vitamin B12\nsupple-\nmentation. The data available regarding\nsupplement usage provided specific infor-\nmation regarding dose and frequency.\nThis aspect of NHANES allowed us to\nobserve the dose-response relationship\nin Table 2 and to compare it within our\nthree study groups.\nThis study is also subject to limita-\ntions. First, NHANES is a cross-sectional\nsurvey and it cannot assess time as a fac-\ntor, and therefore the results are associ-\nations and not causal relationships.\nA second limitation arises in our defini-\ntion of biochemical B12\ndeficiency. There\nis no general consensus on how to define\nnormal versus low serum B12\nlevels.\nSome researchers include the functional\nbiomarker methylmalonic acid (MMA)\nin the definition, but this has yet to be\nNHANES roundtable discussion suggested\nthat definitions of biochemical B12\ndefi-\nciency should incorporate one biomarker\nor holotranscobalamin) and\nTable 3dPolytomous logistic regression for potential risk factors of biochemical B12\ndeficiency and borderline deficiency among\nType 2 diabetes Without diabetes\ndef vs. normal Border vs. normal B12\ndef vs. normal Border vs. normal\nBorder, borderline; def, deficiency; med, medication; REF, reference. *Adjusted for age, BMI, insulin use, and B12\nsupplement use.

However, they also cited a\nneed for more research on how the bio-\nmarkers are related in the general popula-\ntion to prevent misclassification (34).\nMMA was only measured for six of our\nsurvey years; one-third of participants in\nour final analysis were missing serum\nMMA levels. Moreover, it has recently\nbeen reported that MMA values are signif-\nicantly greater among the elderly with di-\nabetes as compared with the elderly\nwithout diabetes even when controlling\nconcentrations and age, sug-\ngesting that having diabetes may indepen-\ndently increase the levels of MMA (35).\nThis unique property of MMA in elderly\nadults with diabetes makes it unsuitable as\npart of a definition of biochemical B12\nde-\nficiency in our specific population groups.\nOur study may also be subject to misclas-\nsification bias. NHANES does not differ-\nentiate between diabetes types 1 and 2 in\nthe surveys; our definition may not cap-\nture adults with type 2 diabetes exclu-\nsively. Additionally, we used responses\nto the question \"Have you received a\nphysician's diagnosis of diabetes\" to cate-\ngorize participants as having or not having\ndiabetes. Therefore, we failed to capture\nundiagnosed diabetes. Finally, we could\nonly assess current metformin use. We\ncannot determine if nonmetformin users\nhave ever used metformin or if they were\nnot using it at the time of the survey.\nOur data demonstrate several im-\nportant conclusions. First, there is a clear\nassociation between metformin and bio-\ndeficiency among adults\nwith type 2 diabetes. This analysis shows\noffered in most multivita-\nmins is associated with two-thirds reduc-\ntion in biochemical B12\ndeficiency in the\ngeneral population, and that this same\ndose is not associated with protection\nagainst biochemical B12\ndeficiency among\nthose with type 2 diabetes taking metfor-\nmin. Our results have public health and\nclinical implications by suggesting that\nneither 2.4 mg, the current IOM recom-\nmendation for daily B12\nintake, nor 6 mg,\nthe amount found in most multivitamins,\nis sufficient for those with type 2 diabetes\ntaking metformin.\nThis analysis suggests a need for fur-\nther research. One research design would\nbe to identify those with biochemical B12\ndeficiency and randomize them to re-\nceive various doses of supplemental B12\nchronically and then evaluate any\nimprovement in serum B12\nconcentra-\ntions and/or clinical outcomes. Another\ndesign would use existing cohorts to de-\ntermine clinical outcomes associated\nwith biochemical B12\ndeficiency and how\nthey are affected by B12\nsupplements at var-\nious doses. Given that a significant propor-\ntion of the population $50 years of age\nhave biochemical B12\ndeficiency and that\nthose with diabetes taking metformin\nhave an even higher proportion of bio-\ndeficiency, we suggest that\nsupport for further research is a reasonable\npriority.\n"
