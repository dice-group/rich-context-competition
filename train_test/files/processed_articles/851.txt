This study examines the individual, spousal, and household characteristics associated with the retirement\nexpectations of husbands and wives.\nMethods. Using data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, subjective probabilities of working full-time after\nreaching age 62 and age 65 are used to measure retirement expectations. The retirement expectations of husbands and\nwives are modeled simultaneously using a joint-generalized least-squares approach.\nResults. Within a marriage, retirement expectations are shaped by individual, spousal, and household characteristics.\nWe observe some gender differences in cross-spousal influence with wives' retirement expectations being more influ-\nenced by husbands' resources and constraints than vice versa. Nonetheless, individual and household factors associated\nwith retirement expectations are widely shared by husbands and wives.\nDiscussion. Husbands and wives both respond to individual and joint constraints and opportunities when planning\nfor retirement. Findings support that there is considerable overlap in retirement planning of husbands and wives during\nearly parts of the retirement decision-making process. However, inequity in cross-spousal influences is a defining char-\nacteristic of retirement decision making. Implications for both policy makers and practitioners are briefly discussed.\nETIREMENT is a policy issue that will pervade public\ndebate for many years to come as the retirement of the\nBaby Boom cohort threatens the security of the Social Secu-\nrity trust fund. Traditional policy solutions to preserve fiscal\nsolvency are most often in the form of financial penalties for\nearly labor force withdrawal. These penalties have long\nbeen part of the Social Security pension system (Quinn &\nBurkhauser, 1994), and they are likely to play a central role\nin ensuring solvency in the next several decades. Future co-\nhorts of older workers will soon face ever greater age eligibil-\nity criteria for full pension benefits as eligibility for full So-\ncial Security benefits gradually increases to age 67 between\nand issues such as privatizing Social Security and reducing\nbenefits now occupy center stage in national policy debates.\nProjecting the fiscal implications of policies such as these\nis typically based on research in which retirement behavior\nis construed as an individual's decision. As Baby Boomers\napproach the prime retirement ages, however, the retirement\ndecision is increasingly likely to be a family decision--a de-\ncision based on two earnings histories, two sources of pen-\nsion wealth, and two persons' health considerations. The\ncoupling of retirement decisions within a marriage is rein-\nforced by Social Security's structuring of husbands' and\nwives' benefits around the earnings history of both persons.\nIn this study, we gain new insights into married couples' re-\ntirement decisions by examining how retirement expecta-\ntions are shaped not only by one's own characteristics, but\nalso by those of their spouse, and household characteristics\nheld in common. We also assess how factors influencing re-\ntirement expectations differ for husbands and wives, offer-\ning new insights into the gendering of retirement decisions\nwithin families. Our results contribute to an emerging line of\ninquiry that is mindful of the pairing of retirement through\nRetirement Plans of Couples\nOur analysis of retirement expectations allows us to focus\non the early part of the retirement process when individuals\nare formulating expectations about eventual behavior. This\nis important, we believe, because this is a point in the life\ncourse when policy initiatives may have the greatest conse-\nquences, and when changes in retirement expectations may\nforetell future changes in retirement behavior. Nonetheless,\nmuch of the value of our approach rests on the idea that re-\ntirement expectations are reasonable predictors of retire-\nment behavior. Fortunately, the evidence for accurate fore-\ncasting is relatively consistent and comes from an array of\nstudies (see Honig, 1996a, for a review). Where expecta-\ntions and behavior do not coincide, unanticipated events,\nsuch as changes in pension wealth and health, frequently\nprompt retirement earlier than originally planned (Ander-\nson, Burkhauser, & Quinn, 1986), making adaptation to re-\ntirement more difficult (Szinovacz, 1989).\nA related issue is the extent to which factors influencing\nretirement expectations parallel those associated with retire-\nment behavior. Although the body of empirical work is not\ndense, available evidence suggests overall congruence in the\nstructure of factors influencing expectations and behavior\n(Honig, 1996a). Like retirement behavior, individuals ex-\nR\npect to retire sooner when their nonmarket time is more\nvaluable, health insurance continues after retirement, pen-\nsion wealth is high, health problems are present, their\nspouse is retired, and their job tasks are mundane and repet-\nthe characteristics associated with retirement expectations\nalso align with studies of gender differences in retirement\nbehavior. Like men, women expect to retire sooner if their\nhealth insurance continues after retirement, a private pen-\nsion is available, and pension wealth is sizeable. Somewhat\nless clear are the effects of health status and job conditions\nfor women's retirement, but it appears that the effects gener-\nally parallel those for men (Honig, 1996b). Although there is\nconsiderable evidence about the retirement expectations of in-\ndividual workers, very few studies have focused explicitly on\nretirement expectations as part of a family retirement process.\nWe take advantage of traditional theoretical frameworks\nof retirement behavior to lay the foundation for our model\nof retirement expectations within marriage. For example,\nwe expect that, among dual-earner couples, husbands and\nwives formulate retirement expectations in response to their\nwork environment where they gather information and accu-\nmulate resources. Based on available information and re-\nsources, workers forecast their future work and nonwork in-\ncome, pension entitlements, and the quality of life should\nthey retire. This model would fit actual planning behavior\nwere it not for the fact the most workers return home after\nwork and plan for retirement with their spouse. Marriage\nprovides a context in which the lives, decisions, and choices\nof married partners are intertwined (Henretta et al., 1993;\nRiley & Riley, 1993). Retirement decisions become joined by\nvirtue of the balance of family and work role negotiations that\noriginate from economic and social needs over the family\nlife course. An important consequence of the intersection of\nwork and family forces is that retirement expectations may\nbe \"gendered\" within marriage--a point we consider next.\nThe Gendering of Retirement Expectations\nWithin Marriage\nHenretta and colleagues (1993) make a fundamental point\nthat guides our analysis of retirement expectations within\nmarriage. Drawing on the work of Treas (1991) and En-\ngland and Farkas (1986) and others, Henretta and his col-\nleagues emphasize differentiated work and family pathways\nas key factors in understanding the retirement behavior of\ncouples. Building on this literature, we argue that a funda-\nmental part of men's identity is that of family provider (Grad-\nman, 1994), with success benchmarked to the work career\n(Gradman, 1994). Furthermore, we expect that the salience\nof the work role to men's identity increases with job status\n(Gradman, 1994). Under these circumstances, we expect\nthat men's retirement decisions are closely tied to indicators\nof success within the work career and the economic de-\nmands of their families. Prior research supports this argu-\nment, showing, for example, that men delay retirement\nwhen working in jobs offering significant intrinsic rewards\nor when faced with low levels of retirement income and de-\npendent children (Anderson, Clark, & Johnson, 1982; Hay-\nMany women retiring in recent years have balanced both\nwork and family demands over much of their adult lives.\nSubstantial numbers of retirement-aged women have inter-\nrupted careers because of childrearing demands (O'Rand et\nal., 1992) and the caring of older family members (Hatch &\nThompson, 1992). For these women, interruption of the\nwork career because of family demands suggests that work\nattachment is a less salient aspect of these women's lives\ncompared with women who are life-long members of the\nlabor force. Observed retirement patterns of women are\nconsistent with this interpretation--women with uninter-\nrupted careers during the childbearing years are more likely\nto delay retirement compared with women with interrupted\ncareers in the childbearing years (O'Rand et al., 1992; Pienta,\nBurr, & Mutchler, 1994). There is less evidence of the effects\nof working conditions on women's retirement behavior.\nReinforcing the effects of differential family roles is the\ngender inequity in resources derived from the work career.\nMen's resources generally are greater than women's, sug-\ngesting that husbands' plans and resources are more influen-\ntial for women's plans than vice versa. Research findings,\nhowever, are ambiguous on this point. Studies based on data\nfrom the 1970s suggest the husband's expectations and re-\nsources are the dominant force in couples' retirement deci-\npoint to a shift toward greater equity such that both partners\nin a marriage have a strong predisposition toward joint re-\ntirement. This is reflected in the fact that the work status of\nthe husband (or wife) is strongly associated with delayed re-\ntirement of a spouse.\nOur study brings these issues into empirical focus by\nmodeling retirement expectations as a function of individ-\nual, spousal, and household characteristics that arise from\nthe work career and family life course. What influences do\nthe individual and shared life-course experiences and re-\nsources of husbands and wives have on both their own and\ntheir spouse's retirement expectations? We are also able to\nexamine the additional implications of household retirement\nplanning behavior. As partners look toward retirement, we\nanticipate that those who have discussed retirement plans\nwith their spouse have more crystallized expectations.\nMore than likely, such planful behavior is indicative of a\nmore general pattern of negotiation that evolves through\nthe balancing of work and family demands over the course\nof a marriage.\nMETHODS\nThe 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is an ex-\ncellent resource for examining the retirement expectations\nof husbands and wives in the years preceding retirement\n(Juster & Suzman, 1995). The target population of the HRS\nis persons aged 51\u00ad61 years and their spouses or partners;\nspouses or partners are potentially younger or older than\nage-eligible respondents. Comparable information is avail-\nable for both husbands and wives on a variety of topics, in-\ncluding demographic characteristics, health and disability,\ncurrent/past job characteristics, retirement plans and expec-\ntations, net worth, income, and health insurance.\nIn this study, we restrict the analytic sample to age-eligible\nrespondents who are married or cohabiting and both part-\nners are in the work force (Chevan, 1996). This makes it\npossible to examine the prospective retirement plans of dual-\nearner partners and thus cross-spousal influences of work\ncharacteristics. Regardless of whether a couple is married\nor cohabiting, the term spouse is used to denote a partner.\nWe exclude couples if either spouse is younger than age 45\n(n  276), because it is less likely that younger respon-\ndents have reasonable expectations about retirement tim-\ning and will be more prone to give information based on\nnormative retirement ages. About 8% of couples contain\nmissing data on the dependent variable for one of the\nspouses (n  158 couples). The resulting analytic sample\nincludes 1,818 married and cohabiting couples for which\nwe have complete data.\nRetirement Expectations\nWe measure retirement expectations based on the follow-\ning question: \"Thinking about work generally and not just\nyour present job, what do you think are the chances that you\nwill be working full time after you reach age 62?\" The re-\nsponse set is a scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 equals\n\"absolutely no chance\" and 10 equals \"absolutely certain.\"\nWe transform these values into subjective probabilities by\ndividing each value by 10, thus a respondent's probability\nranges from 0 to 1 (see Honig, 1996b, for an example of this\nstrategy). A value of one can be interpreted as having a high\nexpectation of continued work after reaching age 62, condi-\ntional on working currently. Values closer to zero represent\nstronger expectations of early retirement. We also construct\na measure of delayed retirement expectations, i.e., expecta-\ntions of working full time past age 65, conditional on work-\ning currently and having some expectation of working past\nNot surprisingly, retirement expectations are not nor-\nmally distributed--the probabilities cluster at the extremes\nof the distribution. We thus transform the subjective proba-\nbilities into a cumulative logistic function (Pindyck & Ru-\nbinfeld, 1976). Using the subjective probability of working\nfull time after age 62 for illustration, the transformation is\n). The slope of the cumulative logistic distri-\nbution is greatest at P62\n 1/2, which implies that changes in\nindependent variables will have their greatest impact on the\nprobability of tending to be more neutral in plans for retire-\nment. The low slopes near the endpoints of the distribution\nrequire larger changes in independent variables to bring\nabout a small change in probability. This transformation al-\nlows us to use joint generalized least-squares (GLS) estima-\ntion, which is described below.\nWork Conditions and Resources\nThe HRS contains an array of work-related measures that\ndefine the structural imperatives of work (i.e., factors defin-\ning the day-to-day qualities of work activity) that influence\nretirement behavior (Hayward et al., 1998; Hayward, Grady,\nner, 1988). Two measures of job demands (physical and\ncognitive) are derived from a factor analysis of eight items\nassessing current job requirements. Using the Promax rota-\ntion method, an exploratory factor analysis supports a two-\nmands and cognitive demands. Jobs that are physically\ndemanding involve physical effort, lifting heavy loads, and\nbending over. Jobs that are cognitively demanding involve\ngood eyesight, intense concentration (or attention), analyz-\ning data (or information), keeping a pace set by others, and\nlearning new things. Physical demands factor loadings\nrange from .85 (job requires stooping or bending) to .87\n( job requires lifting heavy objects) explaining 21.6% of the\nvariance (21.4% variance is explained when the other factor\nis eliminated). Cognitive demands factor loadings range\nfrom .57 (job requires good eyesight) to .72 ( job requires\nvariance is explained when the other factor is eliminated).\nThe interfactor correlation is .076. Average scores for\neach set of items are calculated with Cronbach's alphas of\n.84 and .64 for physical and cognitive demands, respec-\ntively. Higher scores reflect greater job demands.\nThe retirement-related extrinsic rewards of work are mea-\nsured in terms of pension eligibility status (no coverage\navailable; has pension coverage, but not yet eligible; and\ncurrently receiving or eligible to receive benefits), private\npension wealth, and health insurance coverage. Pension\nwealth is its present value at time of the 1992 interview.\nPension wealth is a constructed measure obtained from the\nHRS web site (see www.umich.edu/~hrswww/center/rescont2.\nhtml for a complete description of this measure). The\nmeasure is based on self-report information and poten-\ntially reflects the promise or receipt of employer-provided\npension benefits from up to three current or prior jobs.\nHealth insurance references whether the respondent is un-\ninsured, has employer-provided insurance either through\none's own employer or spouse's employer, or has health\ninsurance from a nonemployer source (including privately\npurchased and government-provided health insurance,\nsuch as Medicaid).\nSelf-employment establishes whether retirement plans\nare tied to one's position in a bureaucratic organization\n(Ekerdt, Hackney, Kosloski, & DeViney, 2001; Hayward et\nal., 1998). This is important because self-employed workers\nencounter less social regulation of work careers (Ekerdt et\nal., 2001). Also, self-employed men and women may work\nlonger because self-employed workers earn less than their\nnon\u00adself-employed counterparts (Hamilton, 2000). Self-\nemployment is attractive to many workers because it in-\ncludes many nonpecuniary benefits, such as greater auton-\nomy, flexibility, intrinsic job satisfaction, and self-expression\nemployment is expected to increase expectations for de-\nlayed retirement. This is consistent with a recent study\nshowing that self-employed workers have greater uncer-\ntainty about retirement timing (Ekerdt et al., 2001). We also\ncontrol for part-time work (less than 35 hours/week) be-\ncause part-time workers are likely to have lower labor mar-\nket attachment than full-time workers.\nHealth Characteristics\nAll else being equal, health is a primary motive for retire-\nment with those in the poorest health either retiring or be-\ncoming work disabled. In part, workers in poor health may\nattach higher value to retirement than work. A related issue\nis that health problems may make it more difficult to keep\nup with the daily demands of work. Most retirement re-\nsearch examining the effects of health relies on a work limi-\ntations measure (i.e., Does the respondent report a health\ncondition that limits the amount or type of work they can\ndo?) Like prior studies, we make use of the health measure\nevaluating the presence of a health condition that limits\nwork ability (1  limited in the amount or kind of work;\n0  otherwise).\nWe expand the measurement of health to include serious\nchronic disease conditions that affect not only functional\nstatus, but also a person's motivation to work (Verbrugge &\nhave chosen to focus on serious chronic health conditions\n(Ferraro & Farmer, 1999) for the following reasons. First,\nserious chronic illnesses may either increase the value of\nleisure relative to work and contribute to early retirement\nexpectations or shorten one's time horizon for achieving\none's goals. Conversely, delayed retirement expectations\nmay result when a person attempts to manage a serious\nchronic illness, thereby increasing the need for health care\ninsurance or income. Serious chronic conditions are mea-\nsured using self-report of whether a doctor has ever told the\nrespondent that he/she has hypertension, coronary heart\ndisease, stroke, cancer (nonskin), diabetes, or chronic lung\ndisease. For simplicity, we create a measure in which each\ncondition is given equal weight (1  condition present, 0 \nnot present) and summed together to form a single measure.\nHousehold Planning Behavior\nThe HRS includes a measure of prior retirement planning\nactivities of couples. Respondents are asked how frequently\nthey have discussed retirement plans with their spouse. The\nrange of responses is \"hardly at all\" (scored as 1) to \"a lot\"\n(scored as 4). Missing information is randomly assigned a\nvalue based on the variable's distribution. Although we an-\nticipate that household planning behavior influences retire-\nment expectations, it is also possible that an individual's re-\ntirement expectations also affect household planning. Thus,\nwe caution against interpreting the association between re-\ntirement planning behavior and retirement expectations in\nstrong causal terms, and we think it likely reflects the fact\nthat the effect is overestimated.\nHousehold Family Characteristics\nFamily characteristics define the immediate and past\nconstraints and opportunity costs of both partners. Couples\n\"share\" childrearing responsibilities, for example, although\nthere may be a division of tasks for husbands and wives. A\nparticularly salient issue, from a retirement planning per-\nspective, is the presence of dependent children in the house-\nhold. Couples who have chosen either to delay childbearing\nor to postpone the end of their childbearing activities are\nlikely to enter their retirement years with children living at\nhome (or temporarily away at school).\nWe also examine the effects of the overall level of income\nand wealth within the household. The household income of\ndual-earner couples reflects both the resources immediately\navailable, as well as the opportunity costs associated with\nearly retirement. Net worth is a measure of assets less the\ndebts of a household.\nDemographic Characteristics\nWe construct measures for various sociodemographic\nfactors that differentiate retirement experiences in the popu-\nlation. These measures include age, education (years of\ncompleted schooling), and race/ethnicity (White, African\nAmerican, Hispanic, and other non-Whites [including Asian,\nPacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan native]). Afri-\ncan American men typically exit the labor force at higher\nrates than White men (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler, & Pienta,\nAmerican women work longer than White women (Pienta et\nal., 1994). Hispanic men have lower rates of labor force ex-\niting than African American and White men. Hispanic\nwomen have higher rates of exiting than other women (Flip-\nSpouse Characteristics\nThe joint nature of husbands' and wives' retirement is\nalso captured by assessing the effects of the spouse's expec-\ntations on the respondent's own expectations, and the effects\nof several other relevant spousal attributes. Because the\nspouse's expectation is potentially endogenous in our model\n(i.e., the individual's and spouse's expectations are simulta-\nneously determined), we used an instrumental variables\napproach to reduce the endogeneity problem. Our basic ap-\nproach was one in which we attempted to select as many\npredictors strongly associated with the spouse's expecta-\ntions, but not strongly associated with the individual's ex-\npectations, as possible (Heckman, 1997). In this analysis,\nwe regressed the spouse's expectations on their age, educa-\ntion, self-reported health, pension wealth, expectations of\nliving to ages 75\u00ad92, and reasoning ability (results available\nfrom the authors), separately for expectations of early and\ndelayed retirement. Based on the estimated parameters, we\ncalculated a predicted score for the spouse's expectations\nand included this as our measure of spouse's expectations in\nthe modeling of a person's retirement expectations.\nOther key spouse characteristics include age, health, and\npension wealth. Spouse's age, net of one's own age, cap-\ntures the tendency to conform to a spouse's age-related re-\ntirement schedule. When a spouse is older, we expect this to\nincrease the probability that a person will expect to retire\nearly. The effect of spousal health is ambiguous. A spouse in\npoor health may increase the attractiveness of joint \"lei-\nsure,\" or it may have the opposite effect of requiring a\nworker to remain in the labor force to meet the financial\nneeds of the couple. Finally, we consider whether access\nto a spouse's pension benefits increases early retirement\nexpectations.\nAnalytic Model\nIn estimating a retirement expectations model, we adopt\nan analytic approach that allows us to gauge cross-spousal\ninfluences allowing for the correlation of husbands' and\nwives' unmeasured retirement preferences (Gustman &\nSteinmeier, 1994). Another aspect of this problem is that\nspouses may have retirement preferences that are unmea-\nsured in our model, but that are highly correlated. Gustman\nand Steinmeier (1994) give an example of correlated retire-\nment preferences arising from assortative mating (e.g., men\nand women with similar preferences for early retirement\nmay marry).\nBecause it is not possible to include all theoretically rele-\nvant information about husbands' and wives' retirement\npreferences, our modeling approach adjusts the error struc-\nture of both spouses by taking into account a correlated er-\nror structure in the husbands' and wives' expectations\nmodels. We do this by estimating husbands' and wives' re-\ntirement expectations with a joint GLS model--also referred\nto as a \"seemingly unrelated regression\" (SURE) model\n(Zellner, 1962). An example of an application of the SURE\nmodel is a study by Simpson and Wilson (1987), who at-\ntempted to capture the correlation between spouses' plans\nwithin dual-earner couples from unobserved heterogeneity.\nThe joint GLS model takes the following form based on\nthe conceptualization of retirement expectations:\nPh\nrepresents the husband's subjective probability of work-\ning full time after age 62 (or age 65), and Pw\nis the wife's\nsubjective probability. Recall that Ph\nand Pw\nare transformed\nusing a cumulative logistic distribution function so that or-\ndinary least squares (OLS) can be used for estimation. Each\nspouse's expectation is presumed to be a function of a vec-\ntor of \"i\" work characteristics, \"j\" health characteristics, \"k\"\nfamily characteristics, and so on. Note that the model in-\ncludes a vector of \"m\" spouse characteristics described\npreviously.\nThe method allows the disturbances (h\nand w\n) to be cor-\nrelated across the two equations, because there is reason to\nsuspect that this is the case. The estimator for this set of\nequations is obtained in two steps. In the first step, a cross-\nequation covariance matrix is computed from residuals from\nthe two separate equations estimated with OLS. This matrix\nis then used to weight the final estimates' retirement expec-\ntations. The SURE model is estimated using PROC MODEL\nin SAS. The SAS procedure produces a system-weighted R2\ncomputed using the cross-equation correlation matrix.\nIn the analysis that follows, nested models are estimated\nin which the base model includes only individual character-\nistics. A second model introduces spousal and couple-level\ncharacteristics (spouses' plans, spouses' characteristics, and\nhousehold constraints/resources). The nested models allow\nus to assess how the effects of person-specific retirement\npredictors are altered when taking into account spousal re-\nsources and expectations. The full model is the basis on\nwhich we evaluate the direct effects of spousal and house-\nhold influences on a partner's expectations. Because we es-\ntimate models for both husbands and wives, we are able to\nLn\nPh\n\u00ad\n--------------\n- \nh\n\nh\nWorkih\n\nh\nHealthjh\n\nh\nPlanh\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\nh\nFamilykh\n\nh\nDemoglh\n\nh\nSpousemh\n\nh\n.\n+\n+\n+ +\nLn\nPw\n\u00ad\n---------------\n- \nw\n\n+\nh\nWorkiw\n\nw\nHealthjw\n\nw\nPlanw\n+ +\n=\n\nw\nFamilykw\n\nw\nDemoglw\n\nw\nSpousemw\n\nw\n.\n+ + + +\ncompare whether factors influencing retirement expecta-\ntions are dependent on gender. We use an F test in the two\nnested models of husbands and wives to formally test for the\nequivalence of effects. Values in the tables are underlined to\nindicate statistically different predictors of husbands' and\nwives' plans (significant at the .05 level and adjusted for\nshared covariance across the models), providing insights\ninto the gendering of retirement expectations among mar-\nried couples.\nTwo sets of nested models are estimated: one for early re-\ntirement (i.e., the subjective probability of working full time\nafter age 62) and the other for delayed retirement (the sub-\njective probability of working full time past age 65). The\nanalysis of delayed retirement expectations is based on a\nsubset of the sample who had at least some expectation of\nworking past age 62. In other words, we analyze couples\nthat attach some probability to working past age 62 (Ph\nand\nPw\nare both greater than zero). For couples thinking about\nworking past age 62, the probability of working past age 65\nis regressed on comparable independent variables. Again,\npositive coefficients indicate stronger plans for delaying re-\ntirement past age 65. Finally, the system-weighted R2 (joint\nGLS) is compared with the adjusted R2 (OLS) to evaluate\nwhether we improve upon the individual estimation of re-\ntirement expectations.\nSelection\nBecause couples are excluded when at least one spouse\nhas already left the labor force, we estimated a selection\nmodel to evaluate whether the selection of dual-earner cou-\nples biases our results. For example, it is possible that more\ntraditional couples or couples that are more age heteroga-\nmous are excluded in our models. Because the potential ex-\nists for introducing selectivity into our analysis, we esti-\nmated a two-stage selection model (Berk, 1983; Heckman,\n1979). In the first stage, a number of independent variables\nwere chosen that were related to sample inclusion, but not\nthe dependent variable (retirement expectations). The full\nset of predictor variables included the following: both part-\nners' ages and education, the race/ethnicity of the household\nhead, number of offspring, number of children living in the\nhousehold or at school, and equality in decision making.\nThe results showed that excluded couples differ from those\nin our analysis mainly in that the husband tends to be older,\nthe wife tends to be younger, the wife tends to be less edu-\ncated, the couple has a larger number of children, and the\ncouple does not engage in egalitarian decision making. The\nsecond-stage model (see results in Tables 2 and 3) included\na selection correction term calculated from the parameter\nestimates of the first model. Although our results remain the\nsame whether we correct for selection or not, we present\nthe results correcting for sample selection.\nRESULTS\nIncluded in Table 1 are descriptive characteristics for\nHRS husbands and wives. Although cohabiters tend to be\nyounger and have less education than those who are married\n(results not shown), retirement expectations do not differ\nbetween cohabiting and married persons. As such, we do\nnot distinguish between married and cohabiting persons. We\nalso generated a parallel set of results that excluded cohabit-\ners, but these did not differ substantially from the results\npresented later.\nAs one might expect, wives are younger than husbands,\nbut do not differ in educational attainment. Wives are gener-\nally in better health than husbands--wives report fewer fatal\nchronic conditions and less work disability. Life cycle work\nexperiences of husbands and wives are uniformly different.\nHusbands tend to work in jobs that are more physically de-\nmanding and less cognitively demanding than wives'jobs; hus-\nbands also tend to be self-employed. Wives tend to work part\ntime. Pension characteristics differ with men having greater\npension wealth and access to employer-provided pensions.\nHusbands attach a much higher probability to working\nfull time after age 62 than do wives (Ph\nwith Pw\n .36). Husbands are also more likely to expect to\ncontinue working full time after age 65 than are wives (Ph\n\n .29). Both findings reinforce the idea that\nwomen maintain a somewhat weaker attachment to the\nlabor force--in part this may be because wives in these birth\ncohorts have had substantially less work experience through-\nout their lives. These findings also demonstrate the enor-\nmous popularity of early retirement given that neither hus-\nbands or wives report strong probabilities of working full\ntime after age 62 or age 65. Husbands' and wives' expecta-\ntions about the timing of retirement are interrelated, with\ncorrelation coefficients of .28 and .23 (expectations about\nretirement upon reaching ages 62 and 65, respectively) that\nare statistically significant (results not shown).\nEarly Retirement Expectations\nEarly retirement expectations of husbands and wives are\nexplored in greater detail in Table 2 to determine similarities\nand differences in the factors associated with husbands' and\nwives' early retirement expectations. The results for Models\n1 and 2 show that, although there is considerable similarity\nacross spouses, age and health influence the early retirement\nplans of husbands and wives differently. Age has a much\nsmaller impact on wives' early retirement expectations than\ntively, in Model 2). Both husbands and wives who are older\nare more likely to expect to work full time after reaching\nage 62, but this effect is statistically significant for men and\nnot women. The overall age pattern may reflect a combina-\ntion of factors, such as age selectivity (i.e., who is still in the\nlabor force when queried about expectations), more accu-\nrate forecasts among older workers, and potential cohort\ndifferences.\nWe expected chronic health conditions and work disabil-\nity to be positively associated with the early retirement ex-\npectations of both husbands and wives based on the idea\nthat declining health signals a shorter work career. Our re-\nsults for husbands are consistent with this expectation. Hus-\nbands who have been diagnosed with a serious chronic con-\ndition have weaker expectations of working past age 62.\nWives in poorer health, however measured, do not differ\nsignificantly from wives in good health in their retirement\nexpectations. Health is surprisingly not associated with\nwives' expectations.\nAttributes of work have equivalent effects on husbands'\nand wives' early retirement expectations. Our results show\nthat men and women expect to work longer in jobs with\ngreater cognitive demands and jobs in which workers are\nself-employed. Greater pension wealth is negatively associ-\nated with husbands' and wives' expectations of working full\ntime after age 62. As shown in Model 1, the absence of\nhealth insurance increases the probability of husbands' and\nwives' early retirement, although this effect is reduced\nand no longer significant once the spouse's characteristics\nare included as control variables.\nSpouse and household characteristics provide additional\ninsight into the retirement plans of couples (Model 2, Table\n2). Husbands' work disabilities, pension eligibility, and pen-\nsion wealth all decrease wives' expectations of working\nafter age 62 (see Model 2, Table 2). Husbands' retirement\nexpectations, however, are not influenced by wives' health\nand pension characteristics. Although the pattern of these\nspousal effects suggests that husbands play a more signifi-\ncant role in women's retirement decisions than vice versa,\nwe note that the differences are not statistically significant.\nDiscussing retirement plans with a spouse is associated with\nlower expectations of working full time after age 62 for both\nhusbands and wives, but particularly so for husbands. Al-\nthough potential endogeneity problems make it difficult to\nmake strong inferences about this association, it strongly\nTable 1.

T test or 2 statistic was used to deter-\nmine statistically significant differences across husbands and wives (underlined).\nsuggests that retirement decisions are the outcome of house-\nhold planning involving both the husband and the wife.\nBoth husbands and wives living in wealthier households\nare less likely to plan to continue working after age 62\n(Model 2, Table 2). Financial constraints, particularly those\ndefined by household wealth, clearly limit choices about the\ntiming of retirement. Household wealth allows both partners\nin a marriage greater freedom to choose leisure over work.\nAnother economic challenge faced by many retirement-age\ncouples is providing for dependent children in the house-\nhold. Our results suggest that husbands, but not wives, plan\nto postpone retirement when dependent children live in the\nhome--a possible product of men's greater earnings.\nDelayed Retirement Expectations\nThe availability of full Social Security benefits at age 65\nraises the possibility that the mix of factors influencing de-\nlayed retirement differs from that influencing retirement ex-\npectations under conditions of reduced benefits. To evaluate\nthis question, we modeled expectations of working full time\nafter age 65 among persons who, at a minimum, are uncer-\ntain about early retirement. In other words, this model in-\ncludes couples where both partners report the probability of\nworking full time after age 62 is greater than zero.\nSimilar to our results for early retirement, the age gradi-\nent is steeper for men, and health has little effect on\nwomen's expectations. More years of education increase ex-\npectations of delayed retirement for both husbands and\nwives (see Model 1, Table 3), although the education effect\nis attenuated for wives once spouse characteristics are con-\ntrolled for.\nWork characteristics are related to delayed retirement\nexpectations. Cognitive job demands significantly increase\nthe delayed retirement expectations, although no such ef-\nTable 2.

The effect of cognitive de-\nmands for men is consistent with prior research document-\ning lower rates of retirement among male workers in these\npositions (Hayward et al., 1998). Physical job demands, on\nthe other hand, are positively associated with expectations\nof wives' working full time after age 65. The positive ef-\nfect of physical job demands on women's expectations is\ncontrary to what one would expect under the \"wear-and-\ntear\" effects of a demanding work environment. Other re-\nsearch, however, indicates that physical demands in late\nlife jobs have positive benefits for men's health, after con-\ntrolling for selection into these jobs (Moore & Hayward,\n1990). As such, physical demands may actually increase\nthe relative value of work over leisure. Self-employed hus-\nbands and wives, net of all other factors, are more likely\nto anticipate delayed retirement. Because we control for\nhealth, and pension and asset wealth, we suggest that this\neffect reflects self-employed individuals' flexibility to ad-\njust their work behavior in accordance with their health or\npreferences for work.\nWives' pension wealth significantly reduces expectations\nto delay retirement, although no comparable effect is ob-\nserved for husbands (but this is not statistically significant).\nAmong husbands, the absence of health insurance is posi-\ntively associated with expectations for delayed retirement as\nis nonemployer health insurance coverage. Husbands with\nemployer-provided health insurance are the least likely to\nexpect to delay retirement. Unlike our observations of early\nretirement expectations, health insurance does not signifi-\ncantly shape wives' delayed retirement expectations, and\nthe difference between husbands and wives is statistically\nsignificant.\nLike early retirement expectations, delayed retirement ex-\npectations are related to retirement planning with spouse.\nHousehold planning behavior is associated with expectations\nof retiring earlier. Again, the husband's work disability sta-\nTable 3.

For example, in the fully specified models\n(wives) of the variance in retirement expectations was ex-\nplained using OLS, whereas 15% of the variance was\nexplained with joint GLS estimation. Individually esti-\nmated models explained a smaller portion of the variance in\nwives' retirement expectations at age 65 than joint models,\nas well. This suggests that our models have tapped into im-\nportant couple-level dimensions of the planning process,\nin particular improving the explanatory model for wives in\ndual-earner couples.\nDISCUSSION\nLike previous research, our analysis demonstrates that\nhusbands' retirement expectations are shaped by pension\nwealth, health, and characteristics of the work environment--\nrelationships reflecting the institutionalization of retirement\n(Szinovacz & DeViney, 1999). Although the factors shaping\nwives' expectations are less well known, like husbands',\nwomen's plans respond to working conditions and pension\nwealth. Such equivalent pension wealth effects, however,\nshould be considered alongside studies that report on aggre-\ngate gender differences in pension wealth. In our study,\nwives have accumulated pension wealth that is one-third the\nvalue of the pension wealth of husbands. Hardy and Shuey\n(2000) noted persistent structural differences in women and\nmen's employer-provided pensions that place women at a\ndisadvantage. Our results suggest that marriage may provide\nan important financial safety net that heightens the impor-\ntance of wives' pension wealth in their retirement decision\nmaking, even though their levels of pension wealth lag be-\nhind those for men.\nConsistent with prior research, we find an association be-\ntween early retirement and workers' labor market vulnera-\nbilities. Vulnerabilities defined by lower education and being\nAfrican American weaken connections to work. In contrast to\nFlippen and Tienda (2000), our results indicate that Hispan-\nics' retirement expectations do not differ from those of\nWhites. One possible explanation is that the present study\nselects only married couples and investigates retirement ex-\npectations rather than retirement behavior.\nCharacteristics of the spouse and household are important\npredictors of retirement expectations. In terms of household\nfactors, husbands' and wives' expectations of early retire-\nment increase as household wealth increases. Husbands,\nthough not wives, expect to delay retirement if dependent\nchildren reside in the household. Also, household planning\nbehaviors tend to accompany spouses' plans to retire early.\nThis finding suggests that planful behavior in household de-\ncision making is important for the joint maximization of lei-\nsure among husbands and wives. We observe asymmetry,\nhowever, in the effects of the spouse's health and pension\ncharacteristics on their partner's expectations. Although\nmost gender differences in spousal effects do not differ sta-\ntistically, the pattern of effects points to a stronger influence\nof husbands on wives' retirement expectations than vice\nversa. Inequity remains a defining feature of retirement de-\ncision making within marriage.\nAn important gender difference to emerge from our anal-\nysis is the extent to which a person's health influences their\nretirement expectations. Unlike husbands', wives' expecta-\ntions do not appear to be sensitive to health. Given the pre-\neminence of health effects in the retirement literature, the\nabsence of such effects for wives was unexpected. One pos-\nsible explanation is that health problems are less severe\namong wives of the ages considered here. On the other hand,\nwives are more likely to expect early retirement when their\nhusbands have a work disability. Wives appear to take into\naccount their spouse's health rather than their own when\nformulating retirement expectations.\nIncreasingly, economists and sociologists point to the impor-\ntance of investigating retirement as a household decision (e.g.,\ntheoretical importance of household decision-making perspec-\ntive, much of the research on retirement behavior continues\nto focus on individual resources. The results shown here,\nhowever, demonstrate that retirement expectations are not\nsimply borne out of an individual's own achievements in the\nlabor market, but they very much reflect the resources and\nexpectations of their spouse (particularly for women),\nhousehold factors such as asset wealth, and household plan-\nning behavior.\nConsiderable theoretical and empirical research rein-\nforces the idea that husbands and wives invest in marriage.\nForms of family organization develop early in marriages out\nof negotiations involving work/family activities. Because\nlifelong family organizational strategies maintain and en-\nhance family well-being, it should not be surprising that re-\ntirement decisions are intimately tied to planning behavior,\nhousehold factors, and the spouse's expectations and re-\nsources. This conclusion speaks to institutional factors that\nreinforce retirement as a family decision. Social Security\nbenefits in particular are structured not on individuals' earn-\nings histories, but on the earnings history of the husband\nand wife within a family. As policy makers plan to address\nconcerns surrounding a growing pool of older workers, it is\nimportant to be mindful of the pairing of retirement plans\nand retirement behavior (Henretta & O'Rand, 1983) that oc-\ncurs through marriage. Very often, it is neither his retire-\nment nor her retirement but their retirement that alters the\nlandscape of pension beneficiaries and the timing of retire-\nment in the population.\n"
