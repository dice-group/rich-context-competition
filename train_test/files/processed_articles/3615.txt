    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The disappearance of a loved one is claimed to be the most stressful type of loss. The present review explores the\nempirical evidence relating to this claim. Specifically, it summarizes studies exploring the prevalence and correlates of psycho-\nlogical symptoms in relatives of missing persons as well as studies comparing levels of psychopathology in relatives of the dis-\nappeared and the deceased. Method: Two independent reviewers performed a systematic search in PsychINFO, Web of Science,\nand Medline, which resulted in 15 studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria. Eligible studies included quantitative peer-\nreviewed articles and dissertations that assessed psychopathology in relatives of missing person. Results: All reviewed studies\nwere focused on disappearances due to war or state terrorism. Prevalence rates of psychopathology were mainly described in\nterms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and varied considerably among the studies. Number of experienced\ntraumatic events and kinship to the missing person were identified as correlates of psychopathology. Comparative studies showed\nthat psychopathology levels did not differ between relatives of missing and deceased persons. Conclusions: The small number of\nstudies and the heterogeneity of the studies limit the understanding of psychopathology in those left behind. More knowledge\nabout psychopathology postdisappearance could be gained by expanding the focus of research beyond disappearances due to war\nor state terrorism.\n",

However, there are some limita-\ntions that preclude firm conclusions. From a methodological per-\nspective, the review may not give a complete and valid overview\nof the existing literature because it lacked a systematic approach\n(e.g., no systematic search strategy, specifics about study selec-\ntion criteria, and quality assessment of the reviewed studies).\nFurthermore, the evidence does not unequivocally support Heeke\nand Knaevelsrud's (2015) conclusions. For instance, indices of\npsychopathology were only significantly higher among relatives\nof missing persons compared to relatives of deceased persons in\nthree of the five comparative studies (Powell et al., 2010; Quirk &\nstudies, some but not all indices of psychopathology differed\nappearance of a loved one is the most stressful type of loss does\nnot seem to rest on a solid empirical basis.\nThe current review provides a systematic overview of the\nscientific research on psychological symptoms in people con-\nfronted with the disappearance of a loved one. Our review\ncomplements Heeke and Knaevelsrud's (2015) review in that\nwe used a systematic approach, in order to prevent selection\nbias of the reviewed studies and to guarantee replicability.\nGiven the large number of people who are confronted with a\ndisappearance due to war and state terrorism, it is important to\ngive a systematic overview of current state of the literature\nregarding psychological symptoms in relatives of missing per-\nsons. This may contribute, among others, to (1) knowledge\nabout the nature and severity of psychopathology in relatives\nof missing persons, (2) the identification of risk factors for\npsychopathology, and (3) directions for future research. In the\nfollowing, we address three objectives. First, we aimed to sum-\nmarize the studies examining prevalence rates of psychological\nsymptoms in relatives of missing persons. Second, we sought to\ndescribe correlates of psychological symptoms. Our third goal\nwas to enumerate the results of studies exploring differences in\nseverity of psychopathology among relatives of disappeared\npeople compared to relatives of deceased people.\nMethod\nInclusion Criteria\nQuantitative studies published in peer-reviewed academic jour-\nnals and dissertations of which the abstract is indexed in scien-\ntific literature databases were included. The studies needed to\nreport about psychological symptoms in spouses, family mem-\nbers, and/or friends of missing persons. A missing person is\ndefined as: \"Anyone whose whereabouts is unknown whatever\nthe circumstances of disappearance. They will be considered\nmissing until located and their well-being or otherwise establish-\nAn article was excluded if it (1) was a qualitative or case\nstudy, (2) did not include data of participants (e.g., a literature\noverview), (3) was focused on participants of whom a relative\nhad returned after a period of disappearance, (4) was focused\non ambiguous loss in terms of being physically present but\npsychologically absent (e.g., dementia patients; cf. Boss,\n1976), or (5) concerned relatives of persons whose loved one\nwas absent but not missing (e.g., foster care). A protocol of the\nreview can be obtained in the PROSPERO register (Lenferink,\nde Keijser, Boelen, & Wessel, 2015). The preferred reporting\nitems for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)\nguidelines were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman,\nSearch Strategy\nThree topics structured the search terms: (1) missing persons,\n(2) people who are left behind, and (3) psychological symp-\ntoms. Because of the different words that can be used for each\nof the three search topics, we entered multiple search terms (at\nleast 12 per topic) to be as complete as possible (see Appendix\nFigure A1 for the search terms). Three electronic literature\ndatabases (PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Medline) were\nsearched in June 2015. No date or language restrictions were\napplied in the search strategy.\nStudy Selection\nThe consecutive steps for the selection of studies that were\nperformed independently by two reviewers are displayed in\nFigure 1. In sum, the search terms in three databases resulted\nin 770 hits. After removal of duplicates, the remaining articles\nwere screened first by title, second by abstract, and lastly by\nfull text based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nFinally, the raters screened the reference lists of the eligible\nstudies (n \u00bc 17) for additional studies meeting the inclusion\ncriteria. As for interrater reliability, the percentages of absolute\nagreement between the raters ranged from 81% to 92%. In case\nof disagreement, consensus was reached through discussion.\nThe databases were again searched in March 2016 for recently\nadded literature, which resulted in zero eligible studies.\ndeemed eligible for inclusion were eventually excluded from the\ncurrent review because reading the full text revealed that they\nprovided the basis for published articles that were already\nstudy (Hagl, Rosner, Butollo, & Powell, 2014) was excluded\nbecause it appeared to be a clinical trial of which the relevant\ndata were reported in another study (Powell et al., 2010) that was\nalready included in the review. In addition, a language barrier\nnecessitated discarding a study published in Croatian after\nincluding it based upon the abstract (Bek, Buzov, & Bilic\nSynthesis of Results\nFirst, current and/or lifetime prevalence rates of psychopathol-\nogy in relatives of missing persons are described for each study.\nThe prevalence rates reflect the percentages of participants\nscoring beyond the established clinical threshold of the specific\nmeasure used. Second, results of correlation analyses or regres-\nsion analyses, t test, w2 test, and/or F test, to assess correlates of\npsychological symptoms are summarized. Third, Cohen's d\neffect sizes were computed for the studies that compared the\nseverity of psychological symptoms between relatives of miss-\ning persons and relatives of deceased persons. According\nQuality Assessment of the Included Studies\nPerforming a quality assessment of observational studies in\nsystematic reviews is one of the criteria in the PRISMA guide-\nlines for reporting systematic reviews (Moher et al., 2009). We\nassessed the quality of the included studies using the systematic\nassessment of quality in observational research (SAQOR; Ross\nand previously used in quality assessment of psychiatric obser-\nvational studies (e.g., Kohrt et al., 2014). The SAQOR evalu-\nates the quality of studies based on meeting criteria in six\ndomains: (i) sample, (ii) control/comparison group, (iii) quality\nof exposure/outcome measurements, (iv) follow-up, (v) distort-\ning influences, and (vi) reporting data. Each domain consists of\nmultiple criteria. The domain is rated as \"adequate,\"\n\"inadequate,\" \"unclear,\" or \"not applicable\" based on the fre-\nquency of fulfilled criteria of the subsequent domain. An over-\nall quality rating--high, moderate, low, or very low--of each\nstudy is then determined based on frequency of adequate\ndomains. As recommended by the authors of the tool (Ross\net al., 2011) and consistent with authors using it (e.g., Kohrt\net al., 2014), we slightly adapted the SAQOR to fit our specific\npopulation (see Appendix Table B1 for more details).\nResults\nQuality Assessment\nThree studies met SAQOR criteria for high quality (Heeke,\n\u00b4rez-Sales, Dura\n\u00b4n-Pe\n\u00b4rez, &\nerate quality (Barakovic\n\u00b4, Avdibegovic\n\u00b4, & Sinanovic\n(Basharat, Zubair, & Mujeeb, 2014; Munczek & Tuber,\nTable B1 for more details about the quality assessment of the\n15 studies).

Another sample included women from Bosnia Herze-\ngovina (n \u00bc 56), whose husbands disappeared during the war\non average 7 years earlier (Powell et al., 2010). A fourth study\nincluded a sample of adolescents (n \u00bc 201) whose fathers had\nbeen missing since 3\u00ad4 years in the context of war in Bosnia\nHerzegovina (Zvizdic & Butollo, 2001). Two studies were\nconducted in the United States among a small sample of family\nmembers of men listed as missing in action (MIA; Campbell &\nn \u00bc 14) for over 25 years ago. Two studies were executed\namong relatives of disappeared persons in Colombia; one due\nand another due to economic extortive kidnapping (n \u00bc 46;\ninformation on the amount of time that had passed since the\ndisappearance. In Chile, Pe\n\u00b4rez-Sales, Dura\n\u00b4n-Pe\n\u00b4rez, and Herz-\nfeld (2000) studied people (n \u00bc 75) whose relative disappeared\ndue to state terrorism more than 20 years earlier. Children (n \u00bc\n16) whose fathers disappeared 9 years ago, on average, due to\nstate terrorism were the subjects of a study in Honduras (Munc-\nzek & Tuber, 1998). The last study was focused on Pakistani\nfamily members (n \u00bc 225) who lived for 1\u00ad9 years with the\ndisappearance of a loved one due to state terrorism (Basharat\nPrevalence of Psychological Symptoms (Objective 1)\nIn four unique samples, described in five articles, prevalence\nrates of psychological symptoms were reported (Barakovic\n\u00b4\nPe\n\u00b4rez-Sales et al., 2000). Due to the heterogeneity of the\nstudies (e.g., studies varied in terms of instruments used to\nassess symptoms and in terms of ethnic background of\nstudy samples), the prevalence rates of psychological\nsymptoms are reported separately for each study (see Table 1\nfor a summary of the characteristics and the main findings\nof the studies).\nthe same sample and showed current self-rated prevalence\nrates of 88% for depression, 65% for mild to severe anxiety\ncomplaints, 56% for PTSD, and 43% for somatic complaints.\nHeeke et al.'s (2015) study showed that 69% reported current\ndepression, 67% PTSD, and 23% complicated grief based on\ninterviews. Interview-based current prevalence rate of PTSD\nreported considerably lower interview-based current and life-\ntime prevalence rates of PTSD (1%/3%), depression (3%/\nPe\nCorrelates of Psychological Symptoms Among Relatives\nof the Disappeared (Objective 2)\nGender.

Four studies assessed\nthe number of traumatic events the relatives of missing persons\nhad been exposed to (Barakovic\n\u00b4 et al.\n(2014) found an increase in the number of experienced trau-\nmatic events to be associated with increased levels of depres-\nexposure to several war-related events (e.g., loss of home) and\npostwar-related events (e.g., family problems) were both also\np < .01). A third study performed 11 regression analyses with\ntype of loss (disappearance vs. death), number of prewar, war-\ntime, and postwar stressors as predictors and several psycholo-\ngical symptoms as outcome variables. Number of postwar but\nnot prewar or wartime stressors were associated with one of the\ncomplicated grief subscales (defined as traumatic grief;\nstudy showed that an increase in the number of experienced\ntraumatic events was associated with complicated grief\n(r \u00bc .30, p < .01); this association disappeared, however, when\ngender, severity of PTSD, and depression were partialled out.\nFamily functioning. Two studies examined the association\nbetween perceived functioning of the family and psychopathol-\nOssa (2003) found no significant associations between five\nfamily coping strategies (e.g., seeking spiritual support and\npassive appraisal) and PTSD and general psychological distress\nin a subgroup (n \u00bc 18) of their sample. This subgroup included\none family member per missing person in order to handle the\nwithin-family clustering effect. In addition, within the same\nsubgroup of their sample, a significant association was found\nbetween general psychological distress and aspects of family\nfunctioning (i.e., family roles, r \u00bc .52, p < .05, i.e., the way in\nwhich family members allocate responsibilities; behavior con-\ntrol, r \u00bc .52, p < .05, i.e., the way in which families provide\nclear standards and rules of behavior; and general family func-\ntioning, r \u00bc .50, p < .05). A higher score on family functioning\nwas indicative of unhealthier family functioning. No signifi-\ncant association was found between PTSD and family function-\ning. Campbell and Demi (2000) reported that individuals\nexperienced less PTSD symptoms of the avoidance cluster,\nwhen they felt their family was cooperative in solving prob-\nlems (r \u00bc \u00c0.47, p < .05) and is in control over dealing with\nadverse life events (r \u00bc \u00c0.49, p < .05). Furthermore, individ-\nuals reported less complicated grief when they viewed their\nfamilies as active in managing challenging situations\n(r \u00bc \u00c0.50, p < .05) and in control over dealing with these\nCoping strategies. The association between use of coping strate-\ngies and psychopathology was examined in only one study\n(Basharat et al., 2014). That study showed that greater use of\nemotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., seeking sympathy from\nothers) was associated with increased levels of depression\n(r \u00bc .41, p < .001). Greater use of problem-focused coping stra-\ntegies (e.g., thinking about dealing with the problem) was asso-\nciated with decreased levels of depression (r \u00bc \u00c0.48, p < .001),\nExtent of hope that the missing person is alive. The association\nbetween extent of hope that the loved one is still alive and\npsychopathology was explored in one study. Extent of hope\nexplained 5% of the variance in complicated grief above gender,\ndepression and PTSD severity, number of experienced traumatic\nevents, and time since disappearance (Heeke et al., 2015).\nSummary of the results of correlational studies. No clear conclu-\nsions can be drawn about the association between psychopathol-\nogy and gender or age. The results with respect to the association\nbetween kinship and psychopathology were consistent across\ntwo samples. More specifically, spouses and parents of missing\npersons seem to be the most affected compared to siblings.\nBased on one study, years of education were unrelated to com-\nplicated grief. The two studies that explored the association\nbetween time since disappearance and symptom severity yielded\ncontrasting results. The results of four studies indicated that\nnumber of traumatic events that people had been exposed to was\nsignificantly associated with increased levels of psychopathol-\nogy. Two studies assessed the association between family func-\ntioning and psychological symptoms and found inconsistent\nresults. Using emotion-focused coping strategies, more fre-\nquently and problem-focused less frequently coping strategies\nwere related to higher psychopathology levels based on a single\nstudy. One study showed a positive association between extent\nof hope that the loved one is still alive and psychopathology.\nDisappearance Versus Death (Objective 3)\nSix studies, all cross-sectional studies, compared relatives of\ndisappeared to deceased persons, all in the context of state\nterrorism or war. Homicide was the cause of death in all cases,\nwith an exception of the study of Heeke et al. (2015) of which\n93% of the deceased persons were victims of homicide and the\nother 7% died due to another reason related to state terrorism\n(e.g., illness). A summary of the studies is offered in Table 2.\nPTSD. In four studies, the severity or prevalence of PTSD symp-\ntoms did not differ significantly between relatives of victims of\ndisappearance to relatives of homicide victims (Heeke et al.,\n2003). A fifth study showed that lifetime prevalence rate of PTSD\nsincethelosswassignificantlyhigheramonghomicidallybereaved\nindividuals (9.0%) than individuals confronted with the disappear-\nance of a family member (1.3%; Pe\nDepression. One study showed that spouses of men who disap-\npeared had significantly more severe depressive symptoms\nthan homicidally bereaved spouses (Powell et al., 2010). This\ndifference had a medium effect size (d \u00bc 0.67). Another study\nreported that those for whom a loved one disappeared also\nexperienced significantly higher depression levels than homi-\ncidally bereaved individuals (d \u00bc 0.22; Zvizdic & Butollo,\n2001). Three other studies did not find significant differences\nin severity or prevalence of depression between relatives of\nvictims of disappearance or homicide (Heeke et al., 2015;\nAnxiety. Anxiety symptom severity did not differ significantly\nbetween children and spouses of men who were victims of\ndisappearance or homicide (Munczek & Tuber, 1998; Powell\net al., 2010). Lifetime prevalence rates of anxiety disorders\nsince the loss was significantly higher for the relatives of the\ndisappeared (5.3%) compared to the homicidally bereaved\nComplicated grief. Women whose husbands disappeared reported\nsignificantly higher levels of \"traumatic grief\" compared to homi-\ncidally bereaved women (Powell et al., 2010). This difference can\nbe interpreted as a medium effect (d \u00bc .79).

Only 4 of the\n24 comparisons across six studies yielded significantly higher\nlevels of severity or prevalence of psychological symptoms in\nthe disappeared group compared to the homicide group, and\nthese differences had a small to medium effect size (see Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe present study reviewed research relevant to Boss's (2004)\nfrequently cited claim that the disappearance of a loved one is\nmore traumatic than other types of loss. The first aim was sum-\nmarizing the results regarding prevalence rates of psychological\nsymptoms in relatives of missing persons. Prevalence rates of\npsychopathology were mainly described in terms of PTSD and\ndepression and varied widely across a small number of studies\nety, 7\u00ad23% for complicated grief, and 43% for somatic com-\nplaints). Several things stand out from this summary of\nprevalence rates. Only 5 of the 11 studies assessed prevalence\nrates of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, these five studies\nvaried in (a) instruments used to assess psychopathology (e.g.,\nnone of the studies used the same instrument), (b) ethnic back-\nground of study samples, (c) composition of study samples (e.g.,\nfemale family members or children of missing persons and rela-\ntives of missing persons due to war vs. due to state terrorism),\nand (d) methodological quality. Therefore, no general conclusive\nstatements can be made about which psychological symptoms\nare most common among relatives of missing persons.\nThe second aim was exploring correlates of psychological\nsymptoms in relatives of missing persons. Compared to other\nbackground characteristics, the type of kinship as correlate of\npsychopathology yielded the most consistent results. Spouses and\nparents ofmissingpersons seem tobe the most affected compared\nto siblings. However, only two studies explored the association\nbetween type of kinship and psychopathology. The association\nbetween other demographic variables--gender, age, educational\nlevel, and time since disappearance--and psychopathology was\nconflicting. The results of these correlational studies are roughly\nin accord with earlier studies among bereaved individuals.\nSchut, 2001) ongrief-relateddistressindicatethatthe relationship\nbetween gender, educational level, age, and time since loss on the\none hand and psychopathology on the other hand is conflicting.\nThe relationship between kinship to the deceased and psycho-\npathology is more consistent and indicates that parents and\nspouses are most strongly affected by a loss.\nIt should be noted that our systematic review does not war-\nrant drawing firm conclusions about the association between\nbackground characteristics and psychopathology because,\ntaken together, the evidence is not sufficient. The composition\nof the majority of the study samples precluded the examination\nof the association between some of the background character-\nistics and psychopathology. For example, some samples con-\nsisted of solely females, which precluded studying the\nassociation between psychopathology and gender (Barakovic\n\u00b4\none type of kinship (e.g., children of missing persons) and\ntherefore did not allow to study the potential differences in\nseverity of psychopathology across different familial relation-\nFurthermore, four studies (Barakovic\nyielded evidence that the number of traumatic events partici-\npants had experienced is associated with increased levels of\npsychological symptoms. This is in line with previous trauma\nresearch indicating that cumulative trauma heightens the risk of\ndevelopment of PTSD (e.g., Johnson & Thompson, 2008;\nseveral studies showed that being exposed to traumatic events\nand the loss of a loved one heightens the risk of development of\ncomplex psychopathological symptom patterns characterized by\ncomorbid symptoms of complicated grief, PTSD, and depression\n(cf. Mutabaruka, Se\n\u00b4journe\nerson et al., 2014). Relatives of missing persons with comorbid\nsymptoms may benefit most from interventions targeting differ-\nent types of symptoms, such as brief eclectic psychotherapy and\ncognitive behavioral therapy (cf. Smid et al., 2015).\nIt has been postulated that holding on to hope for the return\nof the missing loved one may be associated with less emotional\ndistress (Wayland, Maple, McKay, & Glassock, 2016). How-\never, inconsistent with this notion, the single empirical study\n(Heeke et al., 2015) examining this linkage actually showed\nthat the extent of hope that the loved one was still alive was\nassociated with higher levels of complicated grief. The present\nreview revealed mixed results regarding the use of coping stra-\ntegies and family functioning as correlates of psychopathology.\nNo further conclusions can be drawn about to what extent\npsychopathology is related to these constructs, since these\npotential associations were only explored in three studies,\nwhich yielded inconclusive results and differed from each other\nin many ways (e.g., sample composition and measures used).\nThe third aim of the present systematic review was explor-\ning whether the disappearance of a loved one is associated with\nmore severe distress compared to the death of loved one (Boss,\n2004). The claim that people who experience an ambiguous\nloss suffer from more severe psychological symptoms than\nindividuals who experience another type of loss does not seem\nto be supported by the comparative studies reviewed here. Only\n4 of in total 24 comparisons across six comparative studies\nrevealed that relatives of missing persons suffered from signif-\nicantly more severe psychological symptoms compared to\nhomicidally bereaved individuals. This is in contrast with the\nconclusion drawn in Heeke and Knaevelsrud's (2015) over-\nview. Although there is overlap in the reviewed studies of the\noverview of Heeke and Knaevelsrud (2015) and our review,\nincompleteness of this former overview and different weighing\nof the empirical evidence may explain the difference in con-\nclusion drawn. For instance, Heeke and Knaevelsrud (2015)\nomitted some comparative studies in their review (e.g.,\nMunczek & Tuber, 1998). In addition, they elaborated on sig-\nnificant findings of a study of Quirk and Casco (1994) that we\nrated as very low quality and was therefore not discussed.\nIt is possible that methodological drawbacks of the reviewed\nstudies are responsible for the lack of differences in psycho-\npathology between relatives of the disappeared and the\ndeceased. One of the major methodological shortcomings was\nthe small sample size of the studies, increasing the risk of Type\nII error. Furthermore, all comparative studies were conducted\nin the context of war or state terrorism. Both groups were\ntraumatized by different stressors, which might have made it\ndifficult to distinguish between the effect of the loss of a loved\none and the effects of other traumatic experiences. Lastly, we\nbelieve it is important to emphasize that studies conducted in\nthe context of war-related disappearances may not be compa-\nrable to disappearances in the context of state terrorism. Our\nconclusion therefore needs to be interpreted with caution.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first\nproviding a systematic review of empirical findings about the\nnature and severity of psychological symptoms in relatives of\nthe disappeared. However, this present review has primarily\nrevealed gaps in the literature on psychological symptoms in\nrelatives of missing persons. The field of psychological\nresearch in relatives of missing persons could benefit from at\nleast two types of improvements: (1) expanding the focus of\nresearch to comparing relatives of missing persons in the context\nof war and state terrorism as well as focusing on relatives of\nmissing persons outside the context of war and state terrorism\nand (2) employing more rigorous research methods.\nExpanding the Focus of Research\nThe results of our systematic review indicate that with no\nexception, the existing literature is focused on disappearances\nin the context of armed conflict (e.g., war or state terrorism). It\nwould be interesting to study to what extent the experience of\nthe disappearance of a loved one due to war differs from the\ndisappearance due to state terrorism. Losing a significant other\nin war due to lack of protection by the state may not have the\nsimilar impact as experiencing the disappearance of a signifi-\ncant other due to violations conducted by the state. In the latter\ncase, it is possibly more likely that the missing person is still\nalive, but those left behind may avoid searching for the missing\nperson out of fear for prosecutions or reprisals. In addition,\nprofessional support may be less available in the case of dis-\nappearances due to state terrorism because, among others, pro-\nfessionals are at risk to become a victim of state terrorism as\nwell. Enhancing knowledge about the similarities and differ-\nences in psychological consequences but also assessments of\nneeds and barriers to care for relatives of missing persons in the\ncontext of war and state terrorism may be relevant for devel-\noping support tailored to the needs of people with different\ntypes of enforced disappeared relatives.\nDisappearances outside the context of war and state terror-\nism may occur in a wide range of circumstances varying in\nintentionality (e.g., deliberately leaving without informing\nrelatives vs. being murdered and hidden or accidentally drown-\ning; Biehal, Mitchell, & Wade, 2003). As an example, consider\nthe incidence rate of persons reported as missing to the\nthan the number of reports of sexual assault, homicide, and\nunarmed robbery combined (Henderson, Henderson, &\nKiernan, 2000). Expanding the focus of research from disap-\npearances due to war or state terrorism to other types of dis-\nappearances is of interest for at least two reasons.\nFirst, the type of disappearance might be a risk factor for\nthe development of psychopathology, as the type of death is\na risk factor for the development of psychological symp-\ntoms in the bereaved (Lobb et al., 2010). For example,\nviolent deaths are associated with increased complicated\ngrief symptoms (Kaltman & Bonnano, 2003; Lobb et al.,\n2010). This might also be the case for disappearances that\nare probably caused by an act of violence (e.g., kidnapping)\ncompared to accidental disappearances (e.g., drowning acci-\ndent). Enhancing our knowledge about severity and corre-\nlates of psychopathology related to different types of\ndisappearances may facilitate identifying people at risk for\ndeveloping post-disappearance psychopathology.\nSecond, studying post-disappearance psychopathology out-\nside of the context of war or state terrorism could verify to what\nextent the results of our review are applicable to relatives of\nmissing persons in general. With the exception of studies that\nare focused on relatives of men listed as MIA/POW, inherent to\nthe studies about relatives of enforced disappearances due to war\nor state terrorism are the confounding effects of the (1) exposure\nto additional potential traumatic events (e.g., torture and death of\nfamily members) and (2) ethnic background of the participants.\nIt has been repeatedly shown that cumulative trauma heightened\nthe risk of development of psychopathology (e.g., Johnson &\nThompson, 2008). Previous research also support that intensity\nof grief-related distress differs as function of ethnic background\nern societies outside the context of war and state terrorism could\nexplore to what extent the results of our review are applicable to\nrelatives of missing persons without the confounding effects of\ncumulative trauma and ethnic background.\nMethodological Improvements for Future Research\nOur review revealed several methodological drawbacks in the\nliterature. First, only 5 of the 11 studies assessed prevalence\nrates of psychopathology. Other studies did assess psycho-\npathology but used nonvalidated measures and/or measures\nwithout established cutoff criteria for determining \"caseness\"\nof psychological disorders (e.g., Munczek & Tuber, 1998).\nFuture research should use validated measures, preferably clin-\nical structural interviews, for assessing the severity of psycho-\npathology among those left behind in order to gain more\ninsights into the extent of the mental health issues. Noteworthy\nis that the majority of the studies reporting interview-based\nprevalence rates focused on PTSD and depression. Prevalence\nrates of complicated grief, conceptualized and measured in\ndifferent ways, were only studied twice (Heeke et al., 2015;\nPe\n\u00b4rez-Sales et al., 2000). Two other studies (Campbell & Demi,\nmanifestations, but these measures were not validated or lacked\nan established cutoff. Likewise, studies including measures of\ncomplicated grief are not self-evident in the literature about\npsychopathology following the death of a loved one (Kristen-\nedly shown that complicated grief shows overlap with, yet is\ndistinguishable from depression and anxiety (e.g., Boelen &\nage further research into complicated grief, persistent complex\nbereavement disorder (PCBD) has been included as condition\nfor further study in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Associa-\ntion [APA], 2013). Expanding the study of PCBD to relatives of\nmissing persons might yield more insight into normal and dis-\nturbed grief processes of individuals who experience this unique\ntype of loss.\nA second methodological drawback of existing studies\nfocused on psychopathology in relatives of missing persons\nis that only one study examined multiple potential correlates\nof psychopathology in relatives of missing persons simultane-\nously in one regression model (Heeke et al., 2015). Results of\nzero-order correlational analyses might be spurious due to con-\nfounding effect of other variables. Two other studies also per-\nformed regression analysis but also included participants of the\ncomparison group in the analysis, and as a result, these analyses\ndo not reflect the unique effect of the disappearance (Barakovic\n\u00b4\npotential associated variables of psychopathology simultane-\nously is needed to gain more insights into psychological vari-\nables underlying the occurrence and maintenance of\npsychopathology. Up until now, correlational studies primarily\nfocus on the association between psychological symptoms and\nbackground characteristics and number of experienced traumatic\nevents. Theories about complicated grief and PTSD following\nthe death of a loved one highlight the importance of cognitive\nand behavioral variables, as well as attachment styles, in the\ndevelopment and persistence of complicated grief and PTSD\nsymptoms (e.g., Boelen, van den Hout, & van den Bout, 2006;\nShair, 2005). It would be interesting to study whether these\nvariables are also associated with psychological symptoms fol-\nlowing the disappearance of a loved one. This may help to\nidentify individuals at risk for development of psychological\nsymptoms following the disappearance of a loved one and to\ndevelop interventions to target these variables in treatment.\nThird, all reviewed studies used a cross-sectional design.\nLongitudinal studies are needed to gain knowledge about pro-\nspective risk factors for the development and maintenance of\npsychopathology in relatives of missing persons.\nFourth, although most of the reviewed studies consisted of\nclustered data (i.e., multiple relatives of the same missing per-\nson), none of the studies used statistical techniques that could\nhandle this clustering. Ignoring the nested structure of the data\nheightens the risk of spurious significant results. Using multi-\nlevel modeling could solve this problem in future research.\nFifth, the results of the comparative studies are highly likely\nbiased due to again a lack of use of validated measures and\nsolely use of mainly nonprobability samples that consisted of\nrelatives of enforced disappearances that were exposed to addi-\ntional traumatic events that might interact with psychopathol-\nogy. Moreover, due to nonprobability sampling methods, the\ngeneralizability of the results to relatives of missing person\nwithin the same context is also limited. Comparative studies\nusing probability sampling methods outside the context of war\nand state terrorism could give more insights into the unique\npotential differential effect of the disappearance and the death\nof a loved one on severity and correlates of psychological\nsymptoms in those left behind.\nSixth, multiple studies were excluded from the current review\nbecause they did not distinguish between relatives of missing\npersons and relatives of formerly missing persons (e.g., Greif &\nHegar, 1991) or individual confronted with other potential trau-\nmatic experiences (e.g., Al Obaidi & Atallah, 2009). Future\nresearch could benefit from subgroup analyses to explore the\npotential differential effect of the disappearance of a loved one.\nConclusion\nThe small number of studies and heterogeneity of the studies\nlimit understanding of the complex and unique experience of\nthose left behind after the disappearance of a loved one. How-\never, based on the findings of our review, we conclude (with\ncaution) that (1) prevalence rates of psychopathology, mainly\ndescribed in terms of PTSD and depression, varied consider-\nably among the studies; (2) spouses, parents, and those who are\nmore exposed to additional traumatic events are vulnerable for\nthe development of psychological symptoms post-disappear-\nance of a loved one; and (3) the severity of these symptoms\ndoes not significantly differ from homicidally bereaved indi-\nviduals in the context of war and state terrorism. Researchers\nare challenged to further explore this underresearched field to\ngain more insights into the nature, prevalence, and correlates of\npsychopathology in relatives of missing persons.\nAppendix A\n(\"missing family member*\" OR \"missing father*\" OR \"missing\nmother*\" OR \"missing people\" OR \"gone missing\" OR \"missing\nchild*\" OR \"missing person*\" OR \"missing in action\" OR \"people\ngo missing\" OR \"unconfirmed loss*\" OR \"ambiguous loss\" OR\n\"kidnap*\" OR \"forced disappearance\" OR \"disappeared person*\")\nAND (\"families\" OR \"family\" OR \"child*\" OR \"relative\" OR\n\"relatives\" OR \"wife\" OR \"wives\" OR \"husband*\" OR \"spouse*\"\nOR \"parent*\"OR \"son*\" OR \"daughter*\") AND (\"mental health\"\nOR \"stress*\" OR \"trauma*\" OR \"disorder*\" OR \"psycholog*\" OR\n\"symptom*\" OR \"emotion*\" OR \"distress\" OR \"impact\" OR\n\"dysfunction\" OR \"experience\" OR \"grief\" OR \"griev*\")\nAppendix B\nTable B1.

For sample, the \"representative\" criterion was met if the study determined a base sample across multiple sources that\nmatched the target population and used random sampling to arrive at the sample. The \"source\" criterion was met if the study included a description of where the sample was drawn from. The \"method\" criterion was\nmet if the recruitment or selection procedure of participants was explicitly stated. The \"sample size\" criterion was met if a power calculation was reported and the sample size was in accord with the power calculation.\nThe \"inclusion/exclusion\" criterion was met if a description and justifications was given of inclusion/exclusion criteria. To achieve a score of \"adequate,\" a minimum of three sample criteria had to be met. For control/\ncomparison group, all types of control/comparison groups were taken into account. The \"inclusion\" criterion was met if a control/comparison groups was included. The \"identifiable\" criterion was met if the control/\ncomparison group was identifiable and a distinction was made between the groups in the study. The source criterion was met if a description was given of the source and recruitment of the control/comparison group.\nThe \"matched\" criterion was met if matching or randomizing techniques were applied and described. The \"statistical control\" criterion was met if statistical differences between the groups were controlled for except\nfor the primary outcomes or when it was described that there were no statistical differences between the groups. To achieve a score of adequate, a minimum of three control/comparison criteria had to be met. Studies\nwithout a control/comparison group were rated \"not applicable\" for this domain. For outcome, \"outcome\" criterion was met if the article clearly stated what measures were used for which purposes and these\nmeasurements were methodologically sound. To achieve a score of adequate in this category, studies must have met the criterion. For follow-up, all study designs were marked as not applicable, due to cross-sectional\ndesign. For distorting influence, controlling for \"traumatic events\" was used as criterion for the current review since the majority of studies were conducted in the context of war and state terrorism. This criterion was\nmet if studies in the context of war and state terrorism controlled for exposure to traumatic events. \"Other\" criterion was met if the study controlled for other confounding variables and gave a clear description of how\nand why they controlled for other variables. To achieve a score of adequate in this category, studies in the context of war and state terrorism must have met both of these criteria. Studies outside the context of war or\nstate terrorism must have met the other criterion in order to achieve a score of adequate. For data reporting, \"`missing data\" criterion was met if the article reported about how missing data were dealt with. The \"clarity\naccuracy\" criterion was met if data were clearly and accurately presented (e.g., appropriate use of statistics). To achieve a score of adequate, studies must have met both criteria. A final quality level was computed for the\nstudies as follows: high three or more adequate in applicable domains, moderate two adequate in applicable domains, low one inadequate in applicable domains, very low none adequate in applicable domains.\n"
