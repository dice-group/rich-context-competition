A validated screening tool is\nneeded for early identification of developmental delays. This article contains the first phase of a study that established a\nrelatively simple tool to screen children for developmental problems. The aim of the first phase was to define a set of\ndevelopment indicators for the period of 2 to 12 months of life. The study methodology consisted of an extensive literature\nreview, to develop a set of indicators to measure child development in infancy. The indicators were placed within a framework\ndeveloped and used by experts in other countries. It consists of major domains, subdomains, specific aspects, and standards\nof development. This was followed by content validation of the indicators. Following review of literature, 171 indicators were\ncompiled under the framework. At the end of content validation, 125 indicators were retained in the framework. These\nwere pretested, and another 26 were removed following pretesting. The study developed a framework of indicators that\ncould be used as a development tool following a reference-based validation. The second phase of the study that included the\nassessment of psychometric characteristics and reference-based validation would be published in a separate article.\n",

The conservative estimate is that more than\n200 million children below 5 years of age in developing\ncountries are not developing to their full potential.\nDevelopmental problems affect both developed and\ndeveloping countries. For example, in the United Kingdom,\nan analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 16,000 children\naged 0 to 18 years revealed that 7.3% of children were\nreported as having a developmental disability (Blackburn,\nRead, & Spencer, 2010). In a comprehensive review done of\nstudies on disability covering intellectual, hearing, speech,\nvision, motor, and neurologic impairment in low- and mid-\noverall disability rate was reported among 2- to 9-year-old\nchildren from one community-based study in India (n = 640).\nEarly identification of delays by screening is vital, as\ninterventions could make a big difference to the individual\nand family, and place less demand on health expenditure\n(Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007). Development screening\nof a child is currently measured by a range of developmental\nscreening tests (Frankenburg et al., 1996). Developing coun-\ntries face a big obstacle in systematic screening due to three\nfactors:\n1. Established development screening tools need to be\nvalidated to a country before being used.\n2. Trained people are needed to administer them.\n3. To identify developmental problems, a large number\nof apparently normal children have to be examined.\nThese three factors require considerable expertise,\nmoney, and time, all rare attributes in a developing\nsetup.\n1Ministry of Heath, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n2University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n3Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nBuddhi U.

P. Lokuketagoda1, Neil Thalagala1,\nPushpa Fonseka2, and Thach Tran3\n Keywords\nchild development, development screening, development standards\n2 SAGE Open\nTo overcome these obstacles, middle- and low-income\ncountries need instruments that could be used in the field by\na primary health care worker or caregiver. Normative devel-\nopment standards for young children called Early Child\nDevelopment Standards (ECDS) could serve this purpose.\nStandards are statements that specify an expectation for\nachievement of skills or knowledge that may be used as a\nbasis of comparison in measuring or judging capacity, qual-\nity, value, or quantity (Kagan & Britto, 2008).\nThe age at which development skills appear can be given\nas a range. These ranges can be considered as age percen-\ntiles. A percentile of a development indicator is the age a\nparticular skill is achievable by a percentage of children.\nBased on the percentiles, norms can be defined. These norms\ncan be used to make relative assessment of children in rela-\ntion to their level or status of development (Fernald, Kariger,\nDevelopment of ECDS therefore consists of two\ncomponents:\n1. development of a tool where early developmental\nindicators are initially defined and placed in a devel-\nopment framework, and\n2. age validation of the tool to obtain ECDS.\nThe methods adopted to develop ECDS were recom-\nmended in two global workshops held in Shanghai, China,\nand Kathmandu, Nepal (Kagan & Britto, 2008), in collabora-\ntion with the United Nations Children's Educational Fund\nAim\nThis report gives the first component of a study where a\nseries of early developmental indicators for children in sec-\nond to 12th months of life were defined and adapted to ensure\ntheir content and cultural appropriateness.\nMethod\nDevelopment tools generally use a three- to four-domain\napproach in categorizing the items. For example, the Bayley's\nscale uses a three-domain approach (Motor, Cognitive, and\nLanguage) in the main scale (Bayley, 2005). The Denver\nDevelopmental Screening Test (Frankenburg et al., 1996)\nuses a three-domain method as well. These scales do not fur-\nther subdivide the items. The present study further subdi-\nvides the items and uses a hierarchy to place the items (refer\nto Table 1). This hierarchy has been used by countries that\nhave addressed ECDS (Tennesse Department of Education.\n(2013). In this, there are four domains of development, their\nsubdomains, specific aspects, standards, and indicators. The\nfour major subdomains were utilized as all major develop-\nment scales used this categorization. The items under the\nmajor domains conformed to the placement of items found in\nwidely used scales such as the Bayley's and Denver\nDevelopmental Tool. The subdomains are broad areas of the\ndomain. The specific aspects are the main components of\nthose subdomains. The standards are the expected skills that\ndepict the specific aspects. Standards are measured by the\nfinal indicators. The indicators are very specific statements\nthat can be actually measured.\nOnce the skills are defined, they are made measurable by\nconverting them to indicators; hence, the final hierarchy of a\ndomain is given in Figure 1.\nThere are several steps involved in developing and vali-\ndating an instrument. As the first step, an extensive review of\nliterature is needed to operationalize the construct to be mea-\nsured (Benson & Clarke, 1982). When the construct is opera-\ntionalized, the items that can measure the construct as\naccurately as possible are identified. The team that devel-\noped the Denver Developmental Tool identified 336 items\ninitially as the components needed to measure development\n(Frankenburg et al., 1996). In development of the Canadian\nEarly Development Index (EDI), the items for the EDI were\nderived from existing instruments, key informant interviews,\nand focus groups (Janus & Offord, 2007). Content validation\nis the next step where the items and the table of specifica-\ntions are given to a panel of experts who are asked to place\nthe items in the suitable grids within the table of specifica-\ntions. When absolute agreement is not reached, the item is\nrevised until a consensus on its placement is reached.\nCronbach and Meehl (1955) state that content validity is\nestablished by showing that the test items are a sample of a\nuniverse in which the investigator is interested.\nDevelopment tools can either use an a priori structure to\ncategorize their indicators or an empirically driven method.\nAn empirically driven structure will decide on the categories\nwhere the items will be placed following a mathematical\nevaluation like factor analysis. Most of the widely used\nscales like Bayley's scale have not used an empirically driven\nmethod but utilized an a priori structure method. The Bayley\nScales of Infant Development II (BSID II) has been sub-\njected to factor analysis to explore the factor structure. For\nexample, one such study is the analysis carried out by\nThompson and others (Thompson et al., 1994). The authors\nconclude that at a second-order factor analysis, the mental\nand motor components emerge as discrete constructs.\nCountries developing ECDS have all used an a priori struc-\nture method. The present study uses this method as well. The\nauthors are of the view that as the hierarchy used in the pres-\nent study consists of numerous categories, it would render it\nunfeasible to do a construct validity at all levels. But a factor\nanalysis at the topmost category that has the four domains of\ndevelopment could certainly be attempted.\nThus, the first phase of the study is comprised of two\ncomponents:\nA. desk review to generate a tentative list of relevant in-\ndicators and\nLokuketagoda et al. 3\nB. qualitative study to carry out content and cultural vali-\ndation of the above.\nComponent A: Desk Review to Generate a\nTentative List of Relevant Indicators\nThe purpose of the desk review was to gather the generic\nlist of expectations on what children should know and be\nable to do at a given age during the period of 2 to 12 months\nof their life and to define indicators to reflect them.\nTherefore, the data items included a comprehensive list of\nindicators that reflected a particular child's developmental\nperformance pertaining to each developmental domain\n(Motor, Socio-emotional, Cognitive, and Language\ndomains). These indicators were finally organized into the\nhierarchy. The data for the desk review were gathered after\nreview of several sources. These included review of text-\nbooks on child development, existing developmental stan-\ndards, and developmental scales.\nTextbooks reviewed were Child Development by John W.\nSantrock (2001), Child Psychology: A Contemporary\nViewpoint by Hetherington and Parke (1999), The\nDevelopment of Children by Cole and Cole (1989), Child\nDevelopment Principles and Perspectives by Cook and Cook\n(2009) and Psychology: The Science of Behavior by Neil R.\nTable 1.

The articles\nwere the following:\n1. \"South Africa National Early Learning and\nDevelopment Standards for children birth to four years.\nDepartment of Basic Education, Pretoria, SouthAfrica\"\n(Department of Basic Education, Pretoria, 2009).\n2. \"Revised Tennesse Early Learning Developmental\nStandards\" (Tennesse Department of Education,\n3.

The search terms used were \"devel-\nopment,\" \"child,\" and \"standards.\" A keyword search and a\ntitle search were done.\nNext, scales of development commonly in use were\nreviewed. These were the Bayley Scales of Infant and\nToddler Development (Bayley, 2005), the Denver\nDevelopmental Screening Tool (Frankenburg et al., 1996),\nthe Parents' Evaluation of Development Status (Glascoe,\n1997), and the Ten Questions Screening Interview (Landers\nAdditional items appearing in these instruments which\ndid not include highly specified test material and items that\nwere not too complex so that it would be understood by the\naverage caregiver were included.\nFinally, a comprehensive list of items was obtained, and\nthey were assigned to the domain, subdomain, specific\naspect, and standard hierarchy. They were placed in the rel-\nevant age groups reflecting the ages of 2 to 3 months, 3 to 6\nThe indicators chosen had the following characteristics:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Reflecting only a single skill or activity\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Being specific for a particular skill\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Having the ability to capture the performance as the\nskill advances\nQualitative Study to Carry Out Content and\nCultural Validation\nThis was to assess whether the indicators were comprehen-\nsive in covering the domains, were actually reflecting the\ndomain under which they were included, and were actually\nreflecting the specific aspects and standards given. Modified\nDelphi technique was used for this process. For this, six\nexperts comprising of three local consultant pediatricians\n(two qualified in developmental pediatrics), two psycholo-\ngists, and a consultant child psychiatrist were utilized.\nThey were requested to go through each indicator with\nregard to the following and give their verdict:\n1. Comprehensiveness of the standards and indicators\nin covering all aspects of the domain.\n2. Adequacy in reflecting the scope of the domain.\n3. Reflection of the standard, specific aspect, subdo-\nmain, and domain under which they were included.\n4. Representation of domains in comparatively equal\ndistribution.\n5. Observability and measurability.\n6. Are a reflection of what children in the age group are\nexpected to know and be able to do.\nAfter the initial round, the comments were analyzed for\neach item. If four or more out of six agreed on an indicator, it\nwas taken as valid and included in the final instrument. If\nfour or more experts disagreed, they were removed from the\nlist. If three agreed, those indicators were again presented to\nall six experts. After completion of the second round, if the\ndisagreement still stood at 50% (three disagreeing), the item\nwas removed.\nThe finalized list of indicators at the end of this phase was\ntransformed into measurable items with the help of a pedia-\ntrician involved in development assessment of children. This\nwas brought about by laying out specific instructions to elicit\na skill. To maintain uniformity in testing, a testing procedure\nhad to be explained precisely so that the data collectors could\nFigure 1. Hierarchy of a domain.\nLokuketagoda et al. 5\nconform to the procedure. The Bayley Scales of Infant and\nToddler Development was consulted to decide on the posi-\ntions, objects, and distance that items should be held when\ntesting was done.\nNext, a focus group discussion (FGD) of parents was held\nto gather information required to fine-tune the indicators to\nensure their cultural appropriateness. Four FGDs were held\non four different occasions, each consisting of eight parents.\nThe indicators were then pretested. Pretesting was done\nusing 10 children from age category. All the indicators in the\nage group were administered and assessed whether any dif-\nficulty arose to their observability.\nResults\nFollowing the first component which was the desk review,\n171 indicators were compiled under the framework. They\nwere organized under 25 standards which reflected 23 spe-\ncific aspects in four main domains of development. Table 1\ngives the framework of domains, subdomains, specific\naspects, and standards.\nTables 2-5 give the 171 indicators arranged in the frame-\nwork. Some indicators appeared in more than one age group\nas the indicators which suited the best age group could be\nselected once they were age validated.\nOut of the 171 indicators, 46 indicators were removed at\nthe end of content validation. Tables 6 and 7 summarize how\nthese indicators were reduced during content validation.\nAs 46 indicators were removed at the end of content vali-\ndation, 125 indicators proceeded to the next step of the study\nwhich was the FGD with parents to ensure cultural appropri-\nateness. Although removal of 48 indicators is shown, in actu-\nality, only 46 indicators were removed as two were relocated\nelsewhere. No major modifications were needed following\nthe FGDs.\nThe development framework with the 125 indicators is\nNext, the indicators were pretested. Following pretesting,\n26 indicators had to be removed due to issues in measurabil-\nity. Table 12 gives the indicators removed following\npretesting.\nDiscussion\nDue to lack of trained personnel and funds, developing coun-\ntries are not in a position to hold a regular development\nscreening program. Recognizing this fact, several countries\nhave developed ECDS. The ECDS developed in this study\nwas used as a pilot to develop national standards for child\ndevelopment in Sri Lanka. The first objective of the study\nwas to define a set of tentative indicators to reflect the devel-\nopment in the four domains of development. This took the\nform of a desk review that generated a tentative list of indica-\ntors. The indicators were placed in the development frame-\nwork described in the methodology. The main issue faced by\nthe researchers was that most literature on child development\ngives indicators only under the four main domains. Fitting\nthese indicators into the framework was a complicated task.\nThe dearth of measurable indicators in the social and cogni-\ntive domains was another issue.\nDuring content validation, the domain in which the most\nnumber of indicators was removed was the socio-emotional\ndomain. Twenty-four were removed as they were not observ-\nable, and three were removed as they were too advanced for the\ngiven age groups in which the indicator would be tested. The\nreason for this is that social and emotional skills depict an\nunquantifiable aspect of a person and therefore are more quali-\ntative than quantitative. Development scales like the Bayley\nScales of Infant and Toddler Development therefore do not\ninclude socio-emotional skills in their scoring component\n(Bayley, 2005). Indicators for social development skills taken\nfrom Western literature tend to cause issues when used in a\nnon-Western setup. In a preliminary survey done for the\nMalawi Developmental Assessment Tool, it was found that a\nsignificant amount of social indicators taken from Western lit-\nerature had to be discarded as they did not qualify following a\nlogistic regression analysis to obtain population norms\nTheCognitivedomainhadaltogether14indicatorsremoved.\nEight of these indicators were initially placed under the two\nstandards: (a) comparison and sorting and (b) spatial awareness\nwhich were in the subdomain Logical Thinking and\nMathematics in the Cognitive domain. The issue arose as to\nwhether these standards were applicable in infancy.Although it\nis said that mathematical skills operate even in early infancy,\nthere is a problem in including it in an instrument for two rea-\nsons. First, it cannot be accurately said that functions like com-\nparison and sorting operate in very early life.Although research\nhas found that even newborns have rudimentary mathematical\nknowledge (Cook & Cook, 2009), there is not enough evidence\nto include these skills in a document such as this.\nIn the Language domain, four indicators were removed as\nthey overlapped with other indicators in measuring the\nstandard.\nIn the Motor domain, only one indicator was removed as\nit was not objectively measurable. This domain shows indi-\ncators that are less complicated and have fewer aspects than\nother domains. This could be the reason that indicators\nbelonging to this domain form the bulk in assessment sys-\ntems of child development in the first half of the 20th century\n(Gessel & Amatruda, 1947). Improvements in psychometrics\nin the latter half of the century have made it possible to mea-\nsure less straightforward aspects in development like socio-\nemotional components.\nConclusion\nThe development indicators in the framework could be used\nas a tool to screen children for development delays after\nundergoing a reference-based validation.
