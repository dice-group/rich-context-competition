Patients were stratified into four groups according to\nwhether or not they had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or an ischaemic attack (i.e. cerebral\ninfarctions and myocardial infarctions) during the 2-year study period.

On days when the air temperature was\n25C and PM2.5 concentration was 20mg/m3, an ischaemic attack was more likely to occur in\nthe T2DM group than in the group without T2DM. An ischaemic attack was more likely to occur 2\ndays after an increase in the PM2.5 concentration compared with the same day as and 3\u00ad6 days\nafter the increase.\nConclusion: The results of this study confirmed an association between PM2.5 and ischaemic\nattacks in high-risk patients.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Clinical Research and Informatics,\nNational Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo,\nJapan\n2Department of Psychiatry, Akagi-kohgen Hospital,\nShibukawa, Gunma, Japan\n3Department of Internal Medicine, Gohyakuyama Clinic,\nTakasaki, Gunma, Japan\n4Graduate School of Environmental Information, Teikyo\nHeisei University, Tokyo, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nTakayuki Hoshino, National Centre for Global Health and\nJapan.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

It reported that\nthe incidence of stroke increased by 34%\n24 h after air pollution worsened from a\n`good' level (according to the ambient\nair pollution standard set by the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency) to a\n`moderate' level.5 Analysis of data from\nOntario, Canada, showed that a short-term\nrise in PM2.5 in specific patient groups\nincreased the possibility of ischaemic\nattacks.6 Studies have been conducted in\nindividual European countries, such as the\nUK and Germany,7,8 and also in Europe as\na whole \u00ad as a broad target region. For\nexample, the `Air Pollution and Health: A\nEuropean Approach 2' project showed that\nshort-term exposure to air pollutants was\nrelated to mortality rates.9 An analysis of\ndata from 22 European cohort studies sug-\ngested the existence of associations between\nair pollutants and cardiovascular disease\nResearch has been undertaken in\nother world regions. A study conducted\nin Santiago, Chile, found a relationship\nbetween PM2.5 exposure and hospital\nadmissions for stroke.11 A case-crossover\nstudy using Taiwan as the target region\nidentified an association between PM2.5 and\nischaemic stroke.12 In Japan, a survey cover-\na 15-year period was conducted in three\nprefectures (Miyagi, Aichi and Osaka).13\nIt identified a significant increase in the risk\nof male lung cancer deaths associated with\nPM2.5 exposure.13 A survey undertaken in\nfive prefectures in western Japan demon-\nstrated that short-term exposure to air pol-\nlution may increase the risk of death from\nhaemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke.14\nOther studies have also reported relation-\nships between exposure to air pollutants,\nA meta-analysis of data from 34\npreviously published studies found that the\nshort-term risk of a heart attack increased as\nair pollution concentrations increased.18\nAnother meta-analysis showed that fine\nPM2.5 concentrations increased the risk of\nstroke and heart attack.19 A review article\nfound that several groups, including elderly\nsubjects, patients with diabetes mellitus and\npatients with coronary artery disease,\nappeared to be particularly sensitive to the\nharmful effects that resulted from exposure\nto particulate matter.20 Strong relationships\nbetween myocardial infarction and/or\nstroke were found in nine of 14 studies\nrelated to PM10 and in two of five studies\nrelated to PM2.5.21 Research, including in\nanimal models, has also been conducted to\ninvestigate the health impacts of PM2.5\nexposure and to determine the pathophysio-\nlogical mechanisms that link air pollution\nand diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe objective of this study was to analyse\nthe relationship between air PM2.5 concen-\ntrations and ischaemic attacks in elderly\npatients (60 years) with T2DM \u00ad a high-\nrisk population for ischaemic attacks\n(i.e. cerebral infarctions and myocardial\ninfarctions).\nPatients and methods\nExtraction and accumulation of data\nThis retrospective data analysis study\nextracted clinical data from the Mega-Oak\nelectronic medical chart system (National\nCentre for Global Health and Medicine\ndatabase, which holds information on\npatients, clinical laboratory tests, medica-\ntions, disease names and all ordering data)\nand publicly released environmental data\nfrom the Ministry of the Environment\nAtmospheric Environmental Regional\nObservation System (Soramame-kun).25\nThe clinical and environmental data were\nthen integrated using a database and ren-\ndered anonymous using Standardized\nStructured Medical Information eXchange\nsoftware version 2 (Consortium for SS-MIX\nDissemination and Promotion, Kanagawa,\nJapan).26 A flowchart of the data processing\nprocedure is shown in Figure 1.\nTarget data\nAmong the data obtained at the observation\npoints of the Ministry of the Environment\nAtmospheric Environmental Regional\nObservation System (Soramame-kun),\nwhich are available to the public, PM2.5\nconcentration (daily means) and air tem-\nperature (daily means) data were collected\nfor the 2-year period between 1 January\nAdachi-ku Ayase observation point \u00ad the\nclosest observation point to the National\nCentre for Global Health and Medicine,\nTokyo, Japan.\nClinical data were obtained by extracting\ndata for patients aged 60 years (the age\ngroup in which ischaemic attacks are most\ncommon) from the insurance claim data of\npatients who were examined at the National\nCentre for Global Health and Medicine\nHospital, Tokyo, Japan, during the desig-\nnated 2-year period. From this information,\ndata were then extracted for patients who\nhad been examined in the hospital's\nDepartment of Neurosurgery, Department\nof Emergency Medicine and Department of\nGeneral Internal Medicine. There is evi-\ndence that because they eat a lot of fish,\nhealthy Japanese people are at lower risk of\nheart disease than their healthy western\ncounterparts;27,28 this study was therefore\nrestricted to patients aged 60 years (i.e.\nhigh-risk patients). Data extracted and\nevaluated for each patient from the Mega-\nOak electronic medical chart system were:\nage, sex, presence or absence of T2DM, date\nof an occurrence of an ischaemic attack and\ndate of attendance at another clinical\nconsultation. The dates of occurrence of\nischaemic attacks consisted of a combin-\nation of the dates of occurrence of cerebral\ninfarctions and myocardial infarctions,\nwhich were the main categories of ischaemic\nattacks analysed in this study.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nClinical Research and Ethics Committee\nof Aoki Hospital, Hakuseikai Healthcare\nCorporation, Honjo, Saitama Prefecture,\nexplained that the medical data spontan-\neously recorded during patient examinations\nwould be used anonymously for an aca-\ndemic study. Each of the patients providing\ndata also gave written informed consent at\nthe initial consultation.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe JMP\u00d5 statistical package, version 10.0.2\n(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A basic\nstatistical analysis was undertaken for each\nof the groups included in the analysis. The\nodds ratio (OR) for each of the groups was\ncalculated using the method shown in\nTable 1. The analysis methods were mod-\nified in order to determine whether ischae-\nmic attacks as a result of exposure to PM2.5\nwere more likely to occur in patients\n60 years who had T2DM than in patients\n60 years who did not have T2DM; and to\nidentify the degree of rise in PM2.5 concen-\ntration at which the occurrence of ischaemic\nattacks starts to increase in an ischaemic\nattack high-risk group, i.e. elderly patients\nwith T2DM. More specifically, for each of\nthe study analysis groups, the PM2.5 con-\ncentrations were divided into 1 mg/m3 refer-\nby proceeding from one reference value to\nthe next, the ORs were repeatedly calculated\naccording to the group below and at or\nFigure 1.

The clinical and environmental data were then integrated and rendered\nanonymous using Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange (SS-MIX) software.\nabove each reference value by using the\nprocedure in Table 1. In addition to the\nPM2.5 concentrations, the data sets were\nalso reorganized by using air temperature\ndata and time lag data (differences between\nthe day the PM2.5 concentration was rec-\norded and the day the ischaemic attack\noccurred) and the various ORs were calcu-\nlated. The following are examples of how the\nspecific data sets were analysed: (i) analyses\nwere performed that were restricted to\npatients at an air temperature of 20C\nand 25C, which are high-temperature\nenvironments in which the effects of PM2.5\ntend to manifest; (ii) data were prepared\nwith the numbers of occurrences divided\ninto ischaemic attack time lags at 1-day\nintervals, i.e. same day (Lag 0), 1 day later\n(Lag 1) and 2 days later (Lag 2), the\ncalculations were performed by dividing\nthe respective PM2.5 concentrations from\nvalues, and then the time lags at which the\nOR increased were identified. Data were\nproduced according to each set of conditions\n(i.e. whether the patient had T2DM, high\ntemperature conditions) and the multi-tiered\nanalysis data are expressed in a way that\nmakes visual comparisons possible. A P-\nvalue5 0.01 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nMaximum mean daily PM2.5 concentration\ncentration was 17 mg/m3. Even though this\npresent study used data from a 2-year\nperiod, the PM2.5 concentration was\ndays; and it exceeded 35mg/m3, the reference\nT2DM (mean 18 patients/day) among them,\nand patients who were examined for an\n(mean 15 patients/day) of the total number\nof patients. Baseline data for the patients\nincluded in these analyses are shown in\nTable 2. Patients were divided into four\ngroups: (i) a group with T2DM who were\nrecorded as having had and been examined\nfor an ischaemic attack during the survey\nfemale]; mean age 74.59 years); (ii) a group\nwith T2DM who had not had an ischaemic\nfemale]; mean age 73.21 years); (iii) a group\nwithout T2DM who were recorded as\nhaving had and been examined for an\nischaemic attack during the survey period\nwithout T2DM who had not had an ischae-\ngroups of patients were compared: the two\ngroups that had ischaemic attacks were\nsignificantly older than the two groups that\ncomparisons); the two groups with T2DM\nhad significantly higher male-to-female\nratios than the two groups without T2DM\nTable 1.

The data for the T2DM\ngroup are shown in Tables 3 and 5, and the\ndata for the group without T2DM in\nTables 4 and 6. When the calculations were\nmade for the air temperature 20C, there\nwere no significant increases in the ORs for\neither group of patients (Tables 3 and 4).\nWhen the calculations were made for the\ncombination of air temperature 25C and\npatients with T2DM (Table 5), the ORs\ntended to be higher than for the other\ncombinations of analytical conditions. This\nwas particularly noteworthy when the time\nlag was 2 days, as the results showed higher\nORs at PM2.5 reference values in the 20\u00ad\n24mg/m3 range, indicating that ischaemic\nattacks were more likely to occur under\nthese analytical conditions than under other\nconditions. By contrast, in the group with-\nout T2DM in the same PM2.5 reference\nrange, the ORs were almost 1.00 (Table 6),\nindicating that there were no differences in\nthe risk of ischaemic events according to the\nPM2.5 concentrations.\nThe combination of analytical conditions\nunder which the OR was the highest (OR\nconcentration reference value 20mg/m3,\nmean air temperature 25C and a time\nlag of 2 days from exposure (Table 5). When\nthe 2-test was performed in relation to these\nconditions, the 2-test value for the null\nhypothesis `When the PM2.5 concentration\nis 20mg/m3, there is no difference in inci-\ndence of ischaemic attacks from when the\n(P \u00bc 0.018). Thus, the null hypothesis was\nrejected at a 5% significance level, thereby\nconfirming that the PM2.5 concentration\nmade a significant difference to the incidence\nof ischaemic attacks. When the 2-test was\nperformed in relation to patients without\nT2DM under the same analytical condi-\ntions, the 2-test value was 6.04 and the\ndifference was not significant (P \u00bc 0.865).\nThe following section describes the ana-\nlysis of patients with T2DM aged 60 years\nexposed to a mean air temperature 25C\nwith a time lag 2 days after exposure to\nPM2.5. Table 7 shows the details of the\nnumbers of patients included in the OR and\n95% confidence interval analyses of the\noccurrence of ischaemic attacks. These\ndetailed data were used to review material\nfor future tasks, including determining the\nadvantages and limitations of the analytical\nmethods that were used in this present study.\nThe results in Table 7 demonstrate that the\nnumbers of patients who had an ischaemic\nattack below the reference value and at or\nabove the reference value were very small,\nand that the 95% confidence intervals\nwidened as the patient numbers got smaller.\nSome sections of the data were unsuitable\nfor analysis, as identified in Table 7. Figure 2\nshows the changes in ORs according to the\nPM2.5 concentration reference values in the\noptimal range for the analysis without inclu-\nsion of the unsuitable data described previ-\nischaemic attacks on Day 2 after exposure\nshowed that the occurrence of ischaemic\nattacks gradually increased at a mean\npeaked at 20 mg/m3; although the ORs\nvaried widely, the high ORs tended to\ncontinue.\nDiscussion\nPatients at high risk of ischaemic events,\nsuch as the elderly and those that have\narrhythmias, are more vulnerable than\nhealthy people to changes in the environ-\nment; they might therefore be more likely to\nmanifest the effects of exposure to air pol-\nlutants, including PM2.5. Among existing\nresearch on high-risk patients, a study on\nmyocardial infarct survivors in Israel\nshowed a clear association between cumu-\nlative chronic exposure to PM2.5 and recur-\nrence of a cardiovascular event after a first\nmyocardial infarct; a strong possibility that\nincreases in PM2.5 concentration act as a\ntrigger in high-risk patients was suggested.29\nA study conducted in collaboration with the\nAmerican Heart Association concluded that\na strong association existed between short-\nterm exposure to a high PM concentration\nand the acute cardiovascular mortality rate,\nand that the association was particularly\nstrong in high-risk patients.30 Moreover,\nthey showed that even within the standard\nset by the US Environmental Protection\nAgency, there was an association between\nPM2.5 and the acute cardiovascular mortal-\nity rate.30 The present study showed that\nm3, ischaemic attacks were more likely to\noccur in high-risk patients aged 60 years\nwho had T2DM compared with those with-\nout T2DM. In research investigating other\nenvironmental factors, a study conducted in\nMexico City showed strong associations\nbetween changes in cardiac autonomic\nTable 3.

A Swedish\nstudy, which analysed the relationship\nbetween air pollution and the occurrence\nof ventricular arrhythmias in patients at\nhigh risk for ventricular arrhythmias,\ndemonstrated that a worsening of air pollu-\ntion could trigger an arrhythmia within\n2 h.32 In contrast, the present study of the\noccurrence of ischaemic attacks (i.e. cerebral\ninfarction and myocardial infarction)\ndemonstrated that there was a significant\nincrease in the occurrence of attacks 2 days\nafter exposure. The reason for this may be\nthat thrombosis or embolism occurs against\nthe background of circulatory failure after\nan arrhythmia develops, and there is a time\nlag before an ischaemic attack occurs.\nResearch has shown a time lag of 1 day\nbetween an increase in PM2.5 concentration\nand the time an event such as a stroke\noccurred.33 The same study reported that\nthe number of deaths due to the occurrence\nof an event tended to increase after the\nPM2.5 concentration rose in comparison\nwith the day before it rose; and that the\nTable 4.

A time\nseries analysis of data collected at the\nNational Taiwan University Hospital\nshowed that during warm seasons, PM2.5\nwas associated with emergency room visits\nfor ischaemic stroke by patients who were\n65 years of age and by female patients.34 In\nJapan, based on epidemiological findings\nrelated to the health of highly sensitive and\nvulnerable persons (e.g. those with a respira-\ntory or cardiovascular disease, or diabetes),\nan expert committee on environmental\nstandards for fine particulate matter stated\nthe importance of assessing environmental\nTable 5.

There was a tendency for the OR to be higher than the other analytical conditions \u00ad\nparticularly when the time lag was 2 days, the values were higher in the 20\u00ad24 mg/m3 PM2.5 reference value\nrange and ischaemic attacks were more likely to occur than under other conditions. At the PM2.5 reference\nvalue of 20mg/m3 and above, the OR 2 days after PM2.5 exposure was 1.24, which was significantly higher than\nthe OR for the group without T2DM under the same conditions (see Table 6)\nvalue, mg/m3\nTime lag, days\naThese data were unsuitable for analysis because the number of patients was small.\nstandards to protect such individuals.13\nThus, there is a strong likelihood of an\nassociation between warm weather and\nischaemic attacks in high-risk patients, and\nfurther assessments (e.g. of the impact of\nultraviolet rays in warm weather) and eluci-\ndation of the mechanisms responsible for the\nassociations would be useful.\nIn this present study, the highest OR was\nin the T2DM group on a day when the air\ntemperature was 25C and the time lag was\n2 days, thereby indicating that when the\nPM2.5 concentration increased, an ischae-\nmic attack tended to be more likely to occur\n2 days later in the patients with T2DM than\nin the patients without T2DM. It is particu-\nlarly noteworthy that this result was demon-\nstrated at the 5% significance level when\nvalue.

It is therefore\nunlikely that further studies of whether\nischaemic attacks are more common at\nhigher reference values will be possible at\nthe locations used in the present study.

OR for the occurrence of an ischaemic attack on Day 2 after exposure gradually increased starting at a\nmean PM2.5 concentration of 16mg/m3; OR peaked at 20mg/m3. Although the ORs varied widely, the tendency\nfor the OR values to be high continued\ndata. Both sites are located within the 23-\nward (ku) part of Tokyo, and the Adachi-ku\nAyase observation point is the closest obser-\nvation point to the hospital. Nevertheless,\nthe distance between the two sites in a\nstraight line is 12 km, and it is impossible\nto rule out the possibility of differences\narising between the PM2.5 concentration\naround the hospital and the PM2.5 concen-\ntration at the Adachi-ku Ayase observation\npoint. Moreover, in terms of geographical\ndistribution of patients who attend the hos-\npital, because the diseases targeted in the\npresent study required emergency transpor-\ntation to the hospital and a corresponding\noutpatient clinic examination, most of the\npatients lived within 20 km of the hospital;\ntherefore, in this study there is a reliable link\nbetween geographical location, environmen-\ntal data and health effects. However, when\nanalysing data of other patients in the\nfuture, geographical distribution may be\neven more varied and the analysis more\ndifficult. The time lag data revealed no\nsignificant difference between ORs of the\ngroups with and those without T2DM on\nthe day of the increase in PM2.5 concentra-\ntion, but there was a significant difference\nbetween them 2 days later. Ischaemic attacks\nare pathological conditions that develop as a\nresult of occlusion of an artery; and they\noccur as a result of an arterial occlusion by a\nthrombus based on an atherosclerotic lesion,\nor by embolization caused by an embolism\nthat develops due to an arrhythmia.\nParticularly because the risk of thrombosis\nis higher in elderly versus young patients, the\nsymptoms progress more slowly and in a\nstepwise manner than in embolism, which is\nmore common in younger people; thus, the\ndevelopment of a time lag of at least several\nhours between the environmental exposure\nthat acts as the trigger and the completion of\nthe clinical pathology is inevitable. Because\nthe length of time lag varies from disease to\ndisease, improving the reliability of the\nlinkage between the patient and environ-\nmental data in relation to other diseases will\nbe a future challenge.\nEven though this present study used data\nfrom a 2-year period, the PM2.5 concentra-\ndays, and it exceeded 35mg/m3, the reference\nvalue in Japan, on only 4.4% of the days.\nWhen the present study tried extracting data\nonly on the days when the air temperature\nwas high, even fewer data were available.\nConsequently, because there were so few\ndays when both the PM2.5 concentration\nand air temperature were high, it will be\nnecessary to increase the reliability of the\nresults of the analysis by accumulating data\ncontinuously. Our study group has devel-\noped a tool for extracting and accumulating\nclinical and environmental data. Because the\nclinical data used in the present study had\nbeen input daily by physicians and nurses\nduring routine clinical practice, and the\nenvironmental data used are publicly avail-\nable, the introduction of the tool to extract\nand combine these data kept costs down,\ncompared to costs involved with building a\nclinical database from the ground up.\nContinuous monitoring with this tool may\nbe a good method of analysing associations\nbetween environmental factors and disease\nstructure.\nTable 8.

In high-risk\npatients, even when the PM2.5 exposure\nconcentration was below the environmental\nstandard value, as shown by the changes in\nthe ORs, the risk gradually increased start-\nwhich suggests that it is impossible to rule\nout the possibility of an impact of low-\nconcentration exposure on the occurrence of\nischaemic attacks.\nAs for the methods used in this study,\nfrom the standpoint of searching for\nthe lowest value at which air pollutants\naffect so-called low-concentration-exposure\ngroups and the time lags in the occurrence of\nthe ischaemic attacks, at present, when big\ndata are formed based on extraction from\nelectronic charts, it would seem that\nsome parts of the methodology will be\nuseful in other clinicoepidemiological stu-\ndies. Nevertheless, even when there is a large\nnumber of patients, as in the present study,\nthe reliability of the ORs decreased when the\nlowest and highest concentrations in the\ntarget period of the analysis were\napproached; the inability to make compari-\nsons between them would seem to be a\nlimitation of this method of analysis.\nIn the present study, the time lag of the\noccurrence of ischaemic attacks after PM2.5\nexposure appeared to be 2 days, so\nresearch in the future will target a number\nof environmental factors, including other air\npollutants and weather phenomena. After\ntaking the numbers of patients and the mean\nvalues of 3-day changes in environmental\nfactors into account and performing partial\ncorrelation analyses of each element, and\nthen by eliminating duplicate environmental\nfactors and performing a multiple regression\nanalysis according to the items selected,\nfuture monitoring will calculate the degree\nto which PM2.5 and other environmental\nfactors are related to ischaemic attacks and\nthe extent of their individual contributions.\nUsing PM2.5 and other environmental fac-\ntors as parameters, future analyses will deter-\nmine the seasonal fluctuations in their impact\nand search for methods of prevention.\nIn conclusion, this study constructed a\ndatabase combining environmental and clin-\nical data and then analysed the data for\nassociations between ischaemic attacks and\nPM2.5 concentrations. Analyses showed\nthat on days when air temperature was\n20mg/m3, ischaemic attacks were more\nlikely to occur in elderly patients with\nT2DM than in those without T2DM.\nOngoing, continuous monitoring of the\nclinical and environmental data will help to\nimprove the accuracy of future evaluations\nof the associations between environmental\nfactors and disease structure.\n"
