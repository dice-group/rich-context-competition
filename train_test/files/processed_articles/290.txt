The association of modest wine consumption with NAFLD has not been studied and\nthe recommendation of wine for patients at risk for both diseases is controversial. The aim is to\ntest the hypothesis that modest wine consumption is associated with decreased prevalence of\nNAFLD. We included Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants\nwho either reported no alcohol consumption or preferentially drinking wine with total alcohol\nconsumption up to 10 g per day. Suspected NAFLD was based on unexplained serum alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) elevation over the cut point of the reference laboratory (ALT > 43) and\nthe cut point based on the 95th percentile of healthy subjects (ALT > 30 for men; ALT > 19 for\nwomen). Multivariate analysis was adjusted for age, gender, race, neighborhood, income, edu-\ncation, caffeine intake, and physical activity. A total of 7,211 nondrinkers and 945 modest wine\ndrinkers comprised the study sample. Based on the reference laboratory cut point, suspected\nNAFLD was observed in 3.2% of nondrinkers and 0.4% of modest wine drinkers. The adjusted\nsuspected NAFLD was observed in 14.3% of nondrinkers and 8.6% of wine drinkers. The\nconsumption is associated with reduced prevalence of suspected NAFLD.

Moderate wine consumption has\nbeen associated with reduced risk of coronary heart\ndisease (CHD).1 Therefore, some physicians recom-\nmend moderate wine consumption to patients with\nadverse cardiovascular risk factors.2 However, these are\nthe same individuals at increased risk for developing\nnonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3,4 NAFLD\nis closely related to metabolic syndrome and therefore\nshares many risk factors with CHD. Although the\nthreshold for alcoholic liver disease is thought to be\ningestion of 20 g to 30 g of alcohol per day for men and\nthreshold may be lower for overweight subjects who are\nat risk for both CHD and NAFLD.7 The threshold for\npatients with pre-existing liver disease is unclear. The\nusual recommendation for patients with NAFLD is to\nstrictly avoid alcohol. Despite the potential for liver\ninjury, there is indirect evidence to suggest that modest\nwine and alcohol may by protective against liver injury.\nIn an animal model, the wine polyphenol, resveratrol,\nreduces steatosis in mice fed with a high calorie diet.8\nWine ameliorates many risk factors common to\nNAFLD and CHD such as insulin resistance and dys-\nlipidemia.9-11 These studies raise the possibility that\nwine may actually be protective against NAFLD. In the\nabsence of concrete evidence, any recommendation re-\ngarding wine consumption in people at risk for both\nCHD and NAFLD remains controversial.

Subjects were participants in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES III). NHANES III was a cross-sectional\nThe study used a stratified, multistage, probability cluster\nsampling design to obtain a representative sample of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population.12 This study\nwas approved by the institutional review board of The\nUniversity of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.\nWe included participants age 21 years and older, eth-\nnically white, black, or Mexican American. Although\nfatty liver is common in older teenagers,13 we chose a\nminimum age of 21 years because it is the legal drinking\nage in the United States. We included participants who\neither reported no alcohol consumption during the past\nmonth, or reported drinking wine, beer, or liquor up to\none alcoholic beverage per day. We did not include higher\nlevel of alcohol consumption because higher levels of al-\ncohol consumption have already been reported to be\nharmful in overweight and obese subjects.7\nThe primary disease under investigation was suspected\nNAFLD, which was defined using unexplained serum ala-\nnine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. The use of ALT\nwith exclusion of causes other than NAFLD is justified by\nseveral lines of reasoning. Among patients who are re-\nferred to a hepatologist and undergo a liver biopsy for\nunexplained ALT elevation, up to 90% will have a clini-\ncopathological diagnosis of NAFLD.14-16 As opposed to a\nclinical hepatology referral hepatology population, in a\npopulation-based study such as NHANES, unexplained\nALT elevations may be even more likely to be due to\nNAFLD.17 Therefore, we excluded subjects without data\non ALT and those subjects with identifiable conditions\nother than NAFLD to account for ALT elevation. These\nconditions include excessive alcohol consumption (1\nalcoholic beverage per day), viral hepatitis (positive hep-\natitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis C antibody),\niron overload (transferitin saturation 50%), and use of\nmedications associated with hepatotoxicity (androgens,\nantivirals medications, antifungals medications, nitrofu-\nratoin, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trazadone, or tetracy-\ncline). After exclusion of these conditions, unexplained\nALT elevation was strongly associated with adiposity and\nother features of the metabolic syndrome, and thus con-\nsistent with NAFLD.18 Moreover, those forms of chronic\nliver disease not tested are sufficiently uncommon that\nthey were unlikely to contribute significantly to the cause\nof ALT elevation.19 (Refer to the inclusion and exclusion\nflowchart in Fig. 1.)\nSuspected NAFLD. Given the lack of a single uni-\nform cut point for ALT elevation we chose to use both the\nhigher cut point of the NHANES III reference laboratory\n(ALT  43 U/L for both genders, referred to in this work\nas the laboratory cut point) and the widely used gender-\nspecific lower cut point based on the 95th percentile of\nhealthy subjects (ALT  30 for men, ALT 19 for\nwoman, referred to in this work as the healthy cut\npoint).12,20 In addition to the bivariate cut points, the\nlog-transformed ALT was also analyzed as a continuous\nvariable.\nModest Wine, Beer, and Liquor Drinkers. The pri-\nmary exposure of interest was self-report of modest wine\ndrinking versus no alcohol consumption. To distinguish\nwine from alcohol more generally, the association of mod-\nest beer and liquor drinking were also studied. The alco-\nhol history was obtained by a trained interviewer in a\nprivate room to ensure confidentiality. A nondrinker was\na person that reported no wine, beer, or liquor per month.\nA beverage preference (for example, wine, beer, or liquor)\nwas defined as the type of alcohol whose consumption\naccounted for the majority of the total alcohol intake.21\nParticipants who did not have a preferred alcoholic bev-\nerage were defined as mixed drinkers. Modesty was de-\nfined as alcohol consumption up to an average of one\ndrink per day. One drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer,\n4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of liquor.7\nFig. 1. Inclusion and exclusion flow chart.\nSocial, Demographic, and Lifestyle Confounders.\nSocial, demographic, and lifestyle confounders were con-\nsidered to include age, gender, race, poverty income ratio,\nneighborhood population density, years of education, caf-\nfeine intake, and activity level.12 In NHANES III the\nprevalence of suspected NAFLD did not have a linear\nrelationship with age. Therefore, age was adjusted using a\nNeighborhood population density was based on U.S. De-\npartment of Agriculture Rural/Urban continuum codes.\nParticipants were also asked if they considered themselves\nmore active, less active, or the same as same-age sex peers.\nParticipants were asked about their monthly consump-\ntion of caffeine-containing beverages. Total caffeine in-\ntake was calculated as (regular coffee  136 mg per cup \nregular tea  64 mg per cup  soda  46 mg per can or\nbottle)/30.22 The caffeine intake was not normally dis-\ntributed and therefore we used the loge\n-transformed caf-\nfeine intake for analysis.\nMetabolic Syndrome Features. NAFLD is closely as-\nsociated with the metabolic syndrome23,24 and wine has\nbeen shown to ameliorate many metabolic syndrome fea-\nsyndrome features were studied as we explored the poten-\ntial protective mechanisms of modest wine drinking:\nbody mass index (BMI) (weight [kg]/height [m]2), waist\ncircumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood\npressure (SBP), diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, diabetes,\ntriglyceride level, high density lipoprotein (HDL) level,\nand insulin sensitivity. Participants were considered to\nhave diabetes if they reported having a diagnosis of diabe-\ntes or if they had glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin\n) above 6.5%.27 Triglyceride level and insulin resis-\ntance were only considered only in subjects with 8\nhours of fasting prior to phlebotomy. Triglyceride level\nwas not normally distributed and therefore the loge\n-trans-\nformed triglyceride level was used for analysis. Insulin\nresistance was measured as quantitative insulin sensitivity\ncheck index (QUICKI  1/[log(fasting insulin [lU/\nmL])  log(fasting glucose [mg/dL])].28\nStatistical Methods. NHANES III was based on a\ncomplex, multistage, stratified, clustered probability sam-\npling that could not be treated as a simple random sample.\nThe SUDAAN 9.0 module (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) was used to incorporate pri-\nmary sampling unit (sdppsu6), strata (sdpstra6), and\nweighting (wtpfhx6) into the analysis.12\nLogistic regression was used to assess the association\nbetween reported nondrinkers, modest wine drinkers,\nmodest beer drinkers, and modest liquor drinkers with\nsuspected NAFLD. The outcome variable was suspected\nNAFLD based on each of the two ALT cut points. Our\nfirst multivariate model aimed to adjust for potential con-\nfounders and included the entire social, demographic,\nand lifestyle confounders listed above. Effect modifica-\ntion of modest wine drinking with age, gender, race, and\nBMI was tested using product variables (for example,\nmodest wine drinking  age). Linear regression was used\nto estimate the association of modest wine drinking with\nloge\n(ALT) as a continuous variable.\nSubjects identified with pre-existing conditions known\nto be aggravated by alcohol might be less likely to con-\nsume alcohol. Subjects may also stop drinking alcohol\nbecause of illness related to alcohol. To reduce potential\nselection bias, a separate analysis excluded nondrinkers\nwho reported a lifetime cumulative intake of more than\n12 alcoholic drinks, and excluded subjects who reported\nhaving a diagnosis of diabetes, gallbladder, liver, or pan-\ncreatic disease, and subjects counseled by their physician\nto cut down on alcohol due to hypertension.\nTo explore the potential protective mechanism of\nmodest wine drinking, metabolic syndrome features were\nincluded in the second and third multivariate model. The\nmechanism of modest wine drinking was considered to be\nindependent of metabolic syndrome features if the odds\nratio (OR) of wine drinking remained unchanged after\ncorrection for these metabolic syndrome features.22 Our\nsecond multivariate model included all the variables in the\nfirst multivariate model with the addition of BMI, WHR,\nSBP, DBP, HDL, and diabetes status. Our third multi-\nvariate included all the variables in the second multivari-\nate model with the addition of triglyceride level and\nQUICKI, which were only available in participants with\n8 hours of fasting prior to phlebotomy (n  2,840).\nResults\nStudy Sample. The study sample included 7,211\nest mixed drinkers. Refer to Fig. 1 for the inclusion and\nexclusion flowchart. Table 1 illustrates the social, demo-\ngraphic, and lifestyle characteristics of the four groups. As\ncompared to nondrinkers, modest wine drinkers were\nyounger, more likely to be non-Hispanic white and fe-\nmale, to reside in a rural area, to have more years of edu-\ncation and a higher income, and to consider themselves\nmore active than their same age-matched and sex-\nmatched peers.\nPrevalence of Suspected NAFLD in Nondrinkers\nand Modest Alcohol Drinkers. Based on the laboratory\ncut point, suspected NAFLD was observed in 3.2% of\nnondrinkers, 0.4% of modest wine drinkers, 3.5% of\nmodest beer drinkers, 2.3% of modest liquor drinkers,\nand 2.6% of modest mixed drinkers. Using the healthy\ncut point, suspected NAFLD was observed in 14.3% of\nnondrinkers, 8.6% of modest wine drinkers, 12.4% of\nmodest beer drinkers, 14.9% of modest liquor drinkers,\nand 10.3% of modest mixed drinkers. Table 2 lists the\nprevalence and adjusted OR of suspected NAFLD in each\ndrinking category. Compared to nondrinkers, only mod-\nest wine drinkers were consistently associated with a lower\nprevalence of suspected NAFLD across both cut points.\nAfter correction for all social, demographic, and behav-\nioral characteristics (multivariate model 1) (Table 3), the\nadjusted OR for suspected NAFLD was 0.15 (95% con-\nhealthy cut point.

Compared to nondrinkers, wine\ndrinkers had lower BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, triglyceride\nlevel, and higher insulin sensitivity. Wine drinkers also\nhad a significantly lower prevalence of diabetes and met-\nabolic syndrome. For men, but not for women, modest\nwine drinkers had a smaller waist circumference and\nhigher HDL (Table 4). As reported,29 high BMI, WHR,\nwaist circumference, triglyceride level, and DBP, and low\nHDL and QUICKI, as well as diabetes and metabolic\nsyndrome, were significantly associated with suspected\nNAFLD. After controlling for the features of the meta-\nbolic syndrome in multivariate models 2 and 3, the ad-\njusted OR of wine drinking remained significant and\nunchanged (Table 3).\nPrevalence of Suspected NAFLD in Modest Wine\nDrinkers Compared to Other Types of Modest Alcohol\nDrinkers.

Analysis of\nvariance was used to compare continuous variables and chi-square was used to compare categorical variables.\nSubjects identified with pre-existing conditions known to\nbe aggravated by alcohol might be less likely to consume\nalcohol. Subjects may also stop drinking alcohol due to\nhealth problems from alcohol. Exclusion of these subjects\ndid not affect the result. Although modest wine drinkers\nhad fewer metabolic characteristics associated with\nNAFLD, these metabolic characteristics do not appear to\nexplain the potential protective mechanism of modest\nwine drinking.\nNAFLD is the most common liver disease in the\nUnited States. As many as one-third of adults in the\nUnited States may have fatty liver based on magnetic res-\nonance screening30 and living donor liver biopsy.31 It has\nbeen demonstrated that at least 5% of adults with\nNAFLD will develop cirrhosis.32 The current study sug-\ngests that modest wine drinking is associated with a de-\ncreased prevalence of NAFLD. The cross-sectional design\nof the current study cannot address whether this observa-\ntion is causative or associative, and whether wine is pre-\nventive or therapeutic. Nevertheless, this study presents a\nparadigm shift that modest wine consumption may not\nonly be safe from a liver perspective but may actually\ndecrease the prevalence of NAFLD. These data may be\nconsidered preliminary evidence supporting prospective\nstudies of modest wine drinking in the prevention and\ntreatment of NAFLD.\nNAFLD shares many risk factors with CHD and there-\nfore people at risk for NAFLD are likely to be at risk for\nCHD.3,33 From a cardiology and primary care perspec-\ntive, the recommendation of alcohol use for cardioprotec-\ntion in patients who are at risk for CHD, and thus at risk\nfor NAFLD as well, is controversial because excessive al-\ncohol intake may lead to liver injury. The current study\nsuggests that modest wine consumption may be actually\nbe protective against NAFLD and therefore supports the\nuse of up to one glass of wine per day for cardioprotection\nin people at risk for both CHD and NAFLD.\nInteraction with age and BMI must be considered in\nthe study of alcohol's association with liver injury. Ruhl\nand Everhart7 showed that overweight subjects have a\nlower threshold for alcohol-induced liver injury than nor-\nmal weight subjects. Suzuki et al.34 showed that the influ-\nence of alcohol on liver injury varies with age. The current\nstudy specifically focused on wine, rather than all alcohol\ndrinking, and at a lower level than the studies by Ruhl and\nEverhart7 or Suzuki et al.34 The protective association of\nmodest wine drinking was not different across age and\nBMI. This finding is important because middle-age and\noverweight people may benefit the most from the cardio-\nprotective effect and the potential liver protective effect of\nmodest wine drinking.\nOur study adds to the body of evidence that supports\nthe liver protective role of modest wine drinking. The\nwho drank one to seven servings of wine per week had the\nlowest risk of developing cirrhosis. A prospective Japanese\nyears found that the incidence of hypertransaminasemia\nper week compared to subjects who drank none or up to\none drink per week. Although subjects predisposed36 to\nalcoholic liver disease (for example, previous history of\nhypertransaminasemia or alcoholic liver disease) were ex-\ncluded from the study, the finding did suggest a potential\nprotective role of alcohol. In a small study of morbidly\nobese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery,37 any alcohol\nconsumption compared to no alcohol was associated with\ndecreased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the\nhistologically severe form of NAFLD. However, these pa-\ntients are not representative of the general population and\nalcohol amount, frequency, and type were not clearly de-\nlineated.\nBoth alcohol and nonalcohol components of wine may\neach be responsible for the lower prevalence of some of the\nmetabolic syndrome features in the current study. Alco-\nhol consumption has been reported to prevent diabetes\nand improve insulin resistance.9,38,39 Nonalcohol compo-\nnents of wine have been shown to lower serum triglycer-\ncomponents40,41 have been shown to increase serum HDL\nlevels. Wine, but not other alcohol, has been shown to be\ninversely associated with central obesity.44 Our study con-\nfirms that modest wine drinking is associated with a de-\ncreased prevalence of these metabolic syndrome features.\nDespite the inverse association between modest wine\ndrinking and metabolic syndrome features, the improve-\nment in metabolic profile does not account for the liver\nprotective association of modest wine drinking. In multi-\nvariate analysis, correcting for all of those biological vari-\nables did not attenuate the OR, suggesting that the\npotential protective mechanism of modest wine drinking\nis independent of these biological features.22 Further-\nmore, both modest beer and liquor consumption were\nalso associated with improvement in metabolic syndrome\nfeatures but they were not associated with lower preva-\nlence of suspected NAFLD. Although modest alcohol\ndrinkers pooled together as a group were associated with\nlower prevalence of suspected NAFLD, it was modest\nwine drinkers that accounted for the association. We pos-\ntulate that the protective property of modest wine drink-\ning, if present, is mediated through its nonalcohol rather\nthan its alcohol components. The exact protective mech-\nanisms cannot readily be measured in the NHANES III\ndatabase.\nThe current study has a number of important method-\nological characteristics that allow accurate assessment of\nthe association between modest wine drinking and sus-\npected NAFLD. Notably, the use of NHANES makes the\nfindings generalizable to the U.S. population. As such, the\nuse of unexplained ALT elevation as a surrogate of\nNAFLD is imperfect but appropriate for a large popula-\ntion-based study. Without excluding alternative diagno-\nsis, in the Dallas Heart Study30 over half of participants\nwith abnormal ALT had fatty liver based on magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy while nearly three-quarters of par-\nticipants with normal ALT did not have fatty liver. After\nexcluding alternative causes of elevated ALT and/or fatty\nliver, population-based studies in Israel,45 Japan,46 and\nTaiwan47 showed that the positive predictive value (60%-\nwere even stronger. Importantly, the current study made\nuse of strict exclusion criteria to exclude excessive alcohol,\nviral hepatitis, iron overload, and hepatotoxic medica-\ntions. When similar exclusions were applied in case series\nof unexplained ALT elevation, liver biopsy revealed a pos-\ndata support the contention that the majority of partici-\npants in the current study were accurately classified as\nhaving or not having suspected NAFLD. Because the spe-\ncific positive and negative predictive values will vary de-\npending on the ALT cut point being used, two well-\nrecognized cut points were used in this study. While the\npossibility remains that the protective effect of wine ap-\nplies to other forms of liver injury, it is most likely attrib-\nutable to effects on fatty liver. Although imperfect, any\nmisclassification bias based on the ALT should affect wine\ndrinkers and nondrinkers equally and therefore would\nonly falsely diminish the size of the association observed.\nThe use of standardized methodology with trained inter-\nviewers was important for the accuracy of the data but\ncannot fully eliminate errors in the self-reported amount\nand type of alcohol consumed. To adjust for confounders,\nsocial, demographic, and lifestyle covariates were entered\ninto the multivariate analysis and the protective associa-\ntion of modest wine drinking remained unchanged. This\nminimized, although did not completely exclude, the pos-\nsibility that self-report of modest wine drinking was a\nsurrogate marker of another unmeasured lifestyle factor.\nFinally, the cross-sectional design cannot demonstrate the\nsafety of modest wine consumption in subjects with pre-\nexisting NAFLD. The preventive and therapeutic poten-\ntial of modest wine drinking should be further explored\nby prospective cohort and experimental studies.\nThe current study presents a paradigm shift that mod-\nest wine consumption may not only be safe from a liver\nperspective but may actually decrease the prevalence of\nNAFLD. This can be considered initial evidence to sup-\nport future prospective studies with either wine or nonal-\ncohol wine components for prevention or treatment of\nNAFLD. In patients at risk for both CHD and NAFLD,\nup to one serving of wine per day for cardioprotection is\nlikely safe from a liver perspective, although wine con-\nsumption for cardioprotection remains an important de-\ncision at the discretion of the individual and the\nphysician. Finally, we must emphasize that the current\nstudy does not support the use of wine or alcohol at more\nthan one serving per day. The adverse consequence of\nexcessive alcohol intake has been well established from\nprevious studies.5 Patients at risk for developing alcohol\nabuse should not be advised to consume wine.\n"
