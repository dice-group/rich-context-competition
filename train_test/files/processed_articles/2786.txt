Neverthe-\nless, previous studies have reported positive, null and nega-\ntive associations between income inequality and SWB.\nObjectives This study reports the first systematic review\nand meta-analysis of the relationship between income ine-\nquality and SWB, and seeks to understand the heterogeneity\nin the literature.\nMethods This systematic review was conducted accord-\ning to guidance (PRISMA and Cochrane Handbook) and\ncarried out using Web of Science, Medline, Embase and\nPsycINFO databases.\nResults Thirty-nine studies were included in the review,\nbut poor data reporting meant that only 24 studies were\nincluded in the meta-analysis. The narrative analysis of\n39 studies found negative, positive and null associations\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this\nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\n* Christopher J.

One explanation of these inconsistent find-\nings is that the strength and the direction of the relation-\nship between SWB and income inequality are moderated by\nother factors. For example, although both happiness and life\nsatisfaction have been used interchangeably to assess SWB\nacross different studies, these terms are not synonymous and\nmight relate differently to income inequality [10]. Similarly,\nthe literature suggests that level of economic development\n[11, 12], geography [8] and how income inequality is opera-\ntionalised [13] may affect the relationship between income\ninequality and SWB [14].\nGiven that the relationship between income inequality\nand SWB is important to social policy decisions, it is sur-\nprising that no systematic evaluation of this literature has\nyet been undertaken. We therefore decided to undertake the\nfirst systematic review of the literature to examine the link\nbetween income inequality and SWB. The objectives were:\n1. to examine the direction and the magnitude of the asso-\nciation between income inequality and SWB;\n2. to examine the factors that may moderate the association\nbetween income inequality and SWB. On the basis of\nprevious research evidence, we focused on the effects of\n\u00b7 types of measures of SWB (i.e. happiness versus life\nsatisfaction),\n\u00b7 country level of development (i.e. developed coun-\ntries versus developing countries),\n\u00b7 geographic region (e.g. studies conducted in the USA\nversus studies conducted in Europe).\n\u00b7 the way income inequality was operationalised\n(exogenous Gini versus endogenous Gini).\nMethods\nThe systematic review was conducted and reported accord-\ning to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane Handbook rec-\nSearch strategy and data sources\nSystematic searches of the literature published between Jan-\nScience, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO. Combinations\nof two key blocks of terms were used: (1) SWB, happiness,\nlife satisfaction, quality of life, well-being and (2) income\ninequality, income level, social equality, income disparities,\nincome redistribution. We also checked the reference lists\nof the studies meeting our inclusion criteria. The search\nstrategy in each of the databases is presented in Appendix 1\n(see Supplementary Material).\nStudy selection\nScreening was completed in two stages. Initially, the titles\nand abstracts of the identified studies were screened for eli-\ngibility. Next, the full texts of studies initially assessed as\n\"relevant\" for the review were retrieved and checked against\nour inclusion/exclusion criteria. Authors were contacted and\nasked for further information if necessary, most frequently\nfor the zero-order correlation between income inequality and\nSWB [17]. The screening process is presented in Appendix 2\n(see Supplementary Material).\nEligibility criteria\nStudies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following\ncriteria:\n1. Original studies that employed quantitative methods.\nQualitative studies were excluded.\n2. Included a measure of income inequality (i.e. exogenous\nGini and endogenous Gini).\n3. Included a measure of SWB (happiness and/or life sat-\n4. Provided quantitative data regarding the association\nbetween income inequality and SWB.\n5. Were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Grey lit-\nerature was excluded because they were not published\nthrough conventional and credible publishers.\nData extraction\nInformation about the following characteristics of the studies\nwas extracted: (1) first author name and year of publica-\ntion, country where study was conducted, participant char-\nacteristics, period of the study, data used, research design,\nmeasures of SWB, measure of income inequality, zero-order\ncorrelations, regression coefficient, direction of the associa-\ntion, country level of development; and (2) methodological\nquality of the study, namely validity of measures, quality of\nthe research design, population and recruitment methods,\nand control of confounders. Data extraction was completed\nby the first author. A second researcher extracted data from\nthree randomly selected studies.\nAssessment of methodological quality\nThe quality review included assessment of the quality of\nthe research design, population and recruitment methods,\nverified if the choice of the income inequality measure and\nSWB measures were valid and reliable, and if the analysis\nreported the association between income inequality and\nSWB (Table 1). Of 39 studies, 15 were given a high-quality\nrating of 6/6 and the remaining 24 studies were given a lower\nquality rating of 5/6.\nNarrative synthesis\nThe narrative synthesis of all 39 eligible studies focused\non the way SWB is assessed, country level of development,\ngeographic region and the way income inequality was\noperationalised.\nData analysis\nOur plan was to pool the results of the association between\nincome inequality and SWB across the individual studies\nusing meta-analysis. Authors of published papers that did\nnot report data in a form amenable for meta-analysis were\ncontacted and eight authors provided further information.\nWe performed a meta-analysis on all 24 studies reporting\nthe correlation coefficients between income inequality and\nSWB. Studies that assessed both happiness and life satisfac-\ntion were reported separately in the subgroups in order to\ntest whether variation is due to the way SWB was assessed.\nUsing the World Bank classification of countries, we per-\nformed another subgroup analysis to examine whether the\nresults differed between developed and developing coun-\ntries. According to the World Bank, developed countries are\ndefined as industrial countries, advanced economies with\nhigh level of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of\nIn contrast, developing countries includes countries with low\nand middle levels of GNI per capita (>12,736 US dollars)\nThe associated Confidence Intervals (CI) of the zero-\norder correlations were calculated in STATA 13.1 [22].\nThe pooled zero-order correlation as well as the forest plots\nwere computed using the meta-an command for STATA\n[22]. A random effects model was used for all the meta-\nanalyses because of anticipated heterogeneity. Heterogeneity\nwas assessed using the Cochran's Q and Higgin's \nI2 statistic\n[16]. We focus our interpretation of the results in terms of\neffect sizes [23]. To test whether the association between\nincome inequality and SWB varies across subgroups, we\nused Cohen's q to test whether there were significant dif-\nferences in the magnitudes of the correlation coefficients\nfollowing Fisher's z transformation of r [24]. By conven-\ntion, if z score values are greater than or equal to 1.96 or\nless than or equal to -1.96, the two correlation coefficients\nare significantly different at a 0.05 alpha level (suggesting\ndifference of correlation coefficients between two population\nResults\nA total of 619 titles were retrieved, and after removing dupli-\ntions were screened for relevance.

The findings of this review do not support a\nlink between income inequality and SWB in general. Sub-\ngroup analyses revealed that the association between income\ninequality and SWB is significantly influenced by the coun-\ntry economic development. The association between income\ninequality and SWB is significantly negative in developed\nbut significantly positive in developing countries (pooled\nNevertheless, the association between income inequality\nand SWB was not influenced by (a) the measure used to\nassess SWB (i.e. happiness and life satisfaction), (b) geo-\ngraphic region (i.e. studies conducted in the USA versus\nstudies conducted in the European countries) or (c) the way\nincome inequality was operationalised (i.e. exogenous Gini\nvs. endogenous Gini).\nHow to interpret the exploratory findings?\nOur findings suggest that the direction of the association\nbetween income inequality and SWB differs between devel-\noped and developing countries. Differences in different pref-\nerences for income inequality might explain this finding.\nFor example, the evolutionary modernisation theory [11, 58]\nhypothesises differences in tolerance for income inequality\nas economies move from developing to developed countries.\nAccording to this theory [11, 58], people in developing\ncountries might perceive income inequality as an economic\nopportunity or incentive to work, innovate and develop new\ntechnologies and therefore as a more core determinant of\ntheir well-being compared to developed countries. In con-\ntrast, technology, economic growth and innovation might\nbe taken for granted in developed countries, meaning that\nincome inequality may be perceived as a treat rather than a\nchallenge [11, 59]. Moreover, our findings do support the\n\"tunnel\" effect theory suggesting that the rise of income ine-\nquality may signal future mobility and an increase of SWB\n[60]. The \"tunnel\" effect theory supports the idea that people\nin developing countries may tolerate income inequality by\nobserving other people's increasingly rapid progression and\ninterpreting this evolution as a sign that their turn will come\nsoon [60, 61]. A study conducted in Poland found that when\nan increase of income inequality was associated with growth\nand when it was perceived to change rapidly, people were\nmore satisfied with their lives [39]. For example, Berg has\nsuggested that \"income inequality is not necessary harmful\nto well-being. Beja added that people may accept income\ninequality when they see the possibilities to rise above their\nResearch and social policy implications\nThe main contribution of this systematic review and meta-\nanalysis is that the country level of development influences\nthe link between income inequality and SWB: income ine-\nquality is more likely to be a contributor to SWB in citi-\nzens of developing countries than in developed countries.\nReducing income inequality could be a potentially fruitful\napproach for governments and policy makers of developed\ncountries as a means of improving the SWB of their citi-\nzens [11, 12]. The inverse association of SWB with income\ninequality in developing countries suggests that income\ninequality is more likely to be seen as job opportunities for\ninnovation in these countries. However, this review was only\nbased on cross-sectional studies and no causal inferences are\nallowed; longitudinal studies are needed prior to forming\nany causal links. The association between income inequal-\nity and SWB was not influenced by the measure used to\nassess SWB, geographic region or the way income inequality\nwas operationalised. Our findings are in line with previous\nresearch conducted in OECD countries suggesting no asso-\nciation between income inequality and SWB [9] \"the best\nevidence that we have to date is that redistribution beyond\nthe minimum for advanced societies does not enhance sub-\njective well-being/quality of life\" ([9], p. 1107). Neverthe-\nless, further studies are needed to understand the circum-\nstances in which income inequality reduces SWB [3, 4, 62]\nversus the circumstances in which income inequality is not\nnecessarily harmful to SWB [6, 12]. For example, extraor-\ndinary circumstances such as the great recession may affect\nhow inequality is associated to subjective well-being. This\ngap in knowledge is critical because some government and\npolicy makers still ask whether people care about income\ninequality and if income inequality affects SWB. At present,\nthe evidence base is weak and cannot support strongly such\ndecisions. Most importantly, the present systematic review\nhighlights the need to produce a higher-quality evidence\nbase to support social and political decisions relating to\nincome inequality and SWB, both with respect to identify-\ning (a) what are the consequences of income inequality and\n(b) what are the antecedents of SWB.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis review has several strengths. First, the search was con-\nducted according to PRISMA published guidance [27]. Con-\nsistent with the Cochrane guidance [16], the search strategy\ncomprised a thorough literature review, screening of refer-\nence lists and contacting authors for additional information.\nSecond, this is the first systematic review that investigated\nthe association between income inequality and SWB, and\ntherefore the findings of this review have the potential to\ninform the literature in this area.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognise few key limita-\ntions of this review. First, the preponderance of cross-sec-\ntional studies means that it was impossible to establish a\ntemporal or causal relationship between income inequality\nand SWB. Second, the poor reporting of data in combina-\ntion with the use of different analytic approaches precluded\nany firm conclusions about the direction and strength of the\nassociation between income inequality and SWB. Future\nstudies are encouraged to concentrate on establishing an\ninitial correlation between income inequality and SWB\nbefore embarking on multivariate analyses. Third, this study\ninvestigated the relationship between income inequality and\nSWB. Nevertheless, previous studies investigating people's\nquality of life have reported a link between inequality, SWB\nand health status [5, 9]. Further studies are needed to sys-\ntematically investigate the association between income ine-\nquality, SWB and health status [1, 2]. Finally, the majority\nof studies included in this review were conducted in devel-\noped countries (N=14) and only five studies were conducted\nin developing countries. This is problematic in terms of the\nrepresentativeness for the purpose of global decision-mak-\ning. More studies are needed to be performed in developing\ncountries. Due to limitations in the available data, we were\nunable to compare Latin America to Europe or the USA\nbecause only one Latin America country had data amenable\nto meta-analysis. Social and political history may affect the\nassociation between income inequality and SWB because\nInglehart et al. report that, with the same level of wealth,\nLatin America is happier than their counterparts in Ex-Com-\nmunist nations [59]. We strongly encourage more methodo-\nlogically sound investigations to examine the association\nbetween income inequality and SWB and to elucidate cur-\nrent gaps and inconsistencies.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this is the first systematic synthesis of the\nliterature regarding the link between income inequality and\nSWB. The main finding of this review is that the association\nbetween income inequality and SWB is complex. More rig-\norous investigations are needed to elucidate the link between\nincome inequality and SWB, and to identify what are the\nantecedents and consequences of income inequality and\nSWB taking into account the country development level.\nAcknowledgements We thank the authors who provided additional\ninformation allowing us to conduct this systematic review and meta-\nanalysis.
