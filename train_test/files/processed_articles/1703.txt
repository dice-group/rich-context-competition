The report by Looker et al (2) in this issue\nof the Journal provides a cornucopia of new insights into the\nvitamin D nutritional status of US citizens from 1988 through\n2004. In particular, this report compares serum 25(OH)D con-\ncentrations of 20 289 participants in the National Health and\nthe first time, results were reported for children 1\u00ad11 y old,\npregnant women, and the Mexican American population.\nThemostimportantfindinginthereportisthatthemeanserum\nwhich were unrelated to changes in 25(OH)D status, accounted\nfor a portion of this apparent difference between the 2 study\ngroups; nevertheless, at the end of the complex analysis, there\nstill was a significant (7.1 nmol/L) reduction in 25(OH)D con-\ncentrations in males (except Mexican Americans) but not in most\nfemale groups. This result is potentially disturbing if it represents\nthe beginning of the downward trend in serum 25(OH)D con-\ncentrations that has been seen over the past 10\u00ad15 y. It will\ntherefore be essential to repeat this study after another decade.\nThe vitamin D cornucopia that Looker et al provided contains a\nvariety of other novel and important observations. These include\ndifferences in 25(OH)D status 1) by ethnicity and sex in non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans; 2)\nby season (November\u00adMarch or April\u00adOctober); and 4) by preg-\nnancy status. In addition, a second vitamin D cornucopia can be\nfound under \"Supplementary data\" in the current online issue. This\nmaterial contains extensive data on 4 topics: 1) a comparison of\n25(OH)D assay methods; 2) seasonal variations in serum 25(OH)D\nby race-ethnicity in persons 12 y old; 3) the prevalence of serum\n25(OH)D concentrations  25 nmol/L (an indication of nutritional\nvitamin D deficiency); and 4) the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D3\nconcentrations below selected thresholds by age, sex, and race-\nethnicity.\nSome readers may be troubled by 2 technical aspects of the study\nbyLookeretal.Apotentiallyconfoundingproblemisthattherewas\nanevolutionin25(OH)Dassaymethodologybetweenthefirststudy\ndifferenceswereassessedbyrepeatingmeasurementsofthe25(OH)D\nconcentrations in 150 stored serum samples from NHANES III\nsophisticated statistical techniques to tease out the shift in the\nmean serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the 2 decades that\nwas due to changes in assay methods. This problem was recently\ndiscussed in detail (3). However, there still is a need for signif-\nicant improvements in 25(OH)D assays so that consistent and\nprecise assay results may be obtained over multiyear periods.\nThe second potential concern relates to the protocol used in\nNHANES; that is, the serum samples were collected in the US\nsouthern latitudes (35 \u00b0N) only in November\u00adMarch and in the\nUS northern latitudes (35 \u00b0N) only in April\u00adOctober. Thus, the\nmagnitude of the seasonal fall in 25(OH)D concentrations in the\nwinter in the northern latitudes is underestimated, as is the increase\nin concentrations in the summer in the southern latitudes. Ideally, in\nastudyfocusingonserum25(OH)Dconcentrations,thereshouldbe\nno bias of the time of the year for the latitude at which the serum\nsamples were collected. These same concerns also apply to the\ninvolvement of the vitamin D endocrine system with the disease\nprocess of cancer. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a direct\nlink between greater sunlight (ultraviolet B light) production of\nvitamin D3\nin populations living at lower latitudes and lower inci-\ndences of breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancers and non-\nHodgkinlymphoma(4).Otherstudieshaveshownthatpersonswith\nlowserumconcentrationsof25(OH)D(ie,8nmol/L)hadahigher\nincidence of cancer (5), which reinforces the need to improve vita-\nmin D nutritional status.\nThe study by Looker et al is particularly important, given the\ncurrent concerns about the appropriate recommendations for the\ndailyintakeofvitaminD3\n(6,7).Thecurrentadequateintakeallow-\nance of vitamin D, recommended in 1997, is considered by many\nscientiststobetoolowandtobefocusedonlyonvitaminD'sactions\noncalciumandboneissues(1).However,overthepastdecade,new\nevidence has shown that there are 5 additional physiologic systems\nin which the vitamin D receptor and its cognate steroid hormone,\n], generate biologi-\ncal responses (8). These are the immune, pancreas, heart-\ncardiovascular, muscle, and brain systems; the control of the cell\n1 From the Department of Biochemistry and Division of Biomedical Sci-\nences, University of California, Riverside, CA.\n2 Reprints not available.

The sphere of influence of the vi-\ntamin D endocrine system, updated to include physiologic sys-\ntems beyond calcium and bone, is shown in Figure 1.\nThe size of the NHANES study group is large, and one of its\ngreatest values is that it provides the opportunity for study of the\nnutritional status of major ethnic groups in the US population. The\n25(OH)D data from a properly diverse study group will allow ap-\npropriatehealth-caredecisionstobemadeforeachethnicsubgroup.\nIt is essential that the next chapter of the NHANES process will\ninclude appropriate measurements and evaluations to provide in-\nsight into the 25(OH)D nutritional status of all 6 of the physiologic\nsystems that make up the vitamin D endocrine system.\nIn summary, the report of Looker et al should be required\nreadingforallnutritionists,clinicians,andvitaminDaficionados\nwhoaredecisionmakerswithregardto25(OH)Dassays,vitamin\nD nutritional policy, and the care of patients with vitamin D\u00adre-\nlated diseases.\nThe author had no personal or financial conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.
