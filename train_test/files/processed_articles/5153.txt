Some of the aspects of Schwann\ncell differentiation can be reproduced in vitro in response\nto forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator elevating intracel-\nlular cAMP levels. Herein, the effect of forskolin treatment\nwas investigated by a comprehensive genome-wide expres-\nsion study on primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. Addi-\ntional to myelin-related genes, many so far unconsidered\ngenes were ascertained to be modulated by forskolin. One\nof the strongest differentially regulated gene transcripts was\nthe transcription factor Olig1 (oligodendrocyte transcription\nfactor 1), whose mRNA expression levels were reduced in\ntreated Schwann cells. Olig1 protein was localized in myeli-\nnating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells within the sci-\natic nerve as well as in primary Schwann cells, proposing\nit as a novel transcription factor of the Schwann cell lin-\neage. Data analysis further revealed that a number of differ-\nentially expressed genes in forskolin-treated Schwann cells\nwere associated with the ECM (extracellular matrix), under-\nlining its importance during Schwann cell differentiation\nin vitro. Comparison of samples derived from postnatal sci-\natic nerves and from both treated and untreated Schwann\ncell cultures showed considerable differences in gene ex-\npression between in vivo and in vitro, allowing us to sepa-\nrate Schwann cell autonomous from tissue-related changes.\nThe whole data set of the cell culture microarray study is\nprovided to offer an interactive search tool for genes of\ninterest.\n",

Throughout the entire Schwann cell lineage, both\nan autocrine mechanism and axon\u00adglia interaction control\nthe survival, proliferation and differentiation of Schwann\ncells (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky, 2005). Schwann cells\nderive from neural crest cells, and migrate tightly associ-\nated with axons to reach distal targets. At approximately\nE17, Schwann cell precursors become immature Schwann\ncells ensheathing large axon bundles. The transition en-\ntails an orchestrated change in response to survival sig-\nnals and growth factors. Around birth in rodents, imma-\nture Schwann cells differentiate into either myelinating or\nnonmyelinating Schwann cells. This step from an immature\nto a mature Schwann cell coincides with major changes in\ntheir cellular architecture. Generally, axons with a diame-\nter larger than 1 m are segregated to form a one-to-one\nrelation with a Schwann cell, and thereafter will be myeli-\nhand, small caliber axons remain engulfed by nonmyelinat-\ning Schwann cells. In addition to fiber diameter, recipro-\ncal signaling between Schwann cells and neurons influence\nthe Schwann cell fate; neurotrophins and growth factors,\nsuch as neuregulin1 type III were identified as regulators\nfor Schwann cell differentiation (reviewed in Salzer, 2012).\nTransition into myelinating Schwann cells is also mediated\nby cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), which acts as a\nsecond messenger. Upon ligand binding, the intracellular het-\nerotrimeric G protein complex activates the adenylyl cyclase,\nconverting ATP into the second messenger cAMP (Hanoune\nand Defer, 2001). The PKA (protein kinase A) is activated in\nthe presence of cAMP, which in turn stimulates the CREB\nD. Schmid and others\n(cAMP-response-element-binding protein) signal transduc-\nprotein-coupled receptor 126) is the so far only receptor\nidentified to drive Schwann cell differentiation by elevating\nhypomyelination and retarded axonal segregation in the PNS,\nand cAMP elevation by forskolin treatment was sufficient to\nElevation of intracellular cAMP has been shown to induce\nmyelin-related gene expression such as Mpz/P0 (myelin pro-\ntein zero), Krox20 (Egr2) and Galc (galactosylceramidase) in\nrat and human Schwann cell cultures (Lemke and Chao, 1988;\nFurthermore, activation of the cAMP pathway decreases ex-\npression of proteins implicated in immature or nonmyeli-\nnating Schwann cells, such as the low-affinity neurotrophin\nreceptor p75NTR, Gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Gap43\n(growth-associated protein 43) and cJun (Morgan et al., 1991;\nMonje et al., 2009). The effect of cAMP elevation was hitherto\nanalyzed in respect to transcriptional induction of particu-\nlar genes known to be important in differentiation, but its\nprecise effect on mouse Schwann cells is not known yet.\nHerein, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide ex-\npression study on primary mouse Schwann cell cultures\ntreated with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. A de-\ntailed knowledge of the effect of forskolin on Schwann cells\nin vitro is decisive, since the cAMP signaling pathway was\nsuggested to interfere also with other signaling pathways\nsuch as the PI3-kinase and the MAP (mitogen-activated\nprotein)-kinase pathways (Stewart et al., 1996; Kim et al.,\nprehensive analysis identified transcriptional changes of so\nfar disregarded genes induced by elevated cAMP levels in\nprimary mouse Schwann cell cultures. The functional roles\nof most of these genes are not yet known in the Schwann\ncell lineage, but they might be new candidates to be consid-\nered. Furthermore, we compared the expression pattern of\ndifferentially expressed transcripts from naive and forskolin-\ntreated cultured Schwann cells with those from sciatic nerve\nsamples of particular postnatal developmental stages. The\nwhole data set of the microarray study on primary mouse\nSchwann cell cultures is provided to offer an interactive\nsearch tool for genes of interest, analyzing their expression\npattern in cultured Schwann cells upon forskolin treatment.\nMice\nC57BL/6 mice were kept under standard SPF-conditions,\nhoused and treated according to the guidelines for care and\nuse of experimental animals of the veterinary office of the\nCanton of Basel.\nPrimary mouse Schwann cell cultures\nSchwann cells were prepared from P1 (postnatal day 1)\nmouse sciatic nerves, and dissociated with 0.4% (w/v) colla-\ngenase and 0.125% (w/v) trypsin. DMEM (Dulbecco's modi-\nfied Eagle's medium; D6546, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented\nwith 10% (v/v) FBS was added, and cells were seeded\nonto 24-well plates (PrimariaTM, BD Bioscience). A day af-\nter, Schwann cells were treated with 10 M cytosine -D-\narabinofuranoside (AraC) twice for 24 h to reduce fibroblast\nproliferation. Schwann cells were passaged, and cells were\npooled and cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS.\nFor mRNA expression analysis, primary Schwann cells were\nseeded at a density of 25000 cells/well. For immunofluores-\ncence analysis, 10000 Schwann cells were seeded on poly-D-\nlysine and laminin-coated glass coverslips in a 50 l drop.\nFor Schwann cell differentiation assay, cells were stimu-\nlated with 20 M forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM sup-\nplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS for 24 h. Purity of mouse\nSchwann cell cultures determined by immunofluorescent\nenrichment.\nqRT\u00adPCR expression analysis\nSchwann cells were washed with PBS, and total RNA was\nisolated using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol. For the in vivo analysis, 54\nsciatic nerves were pooled to nine experimental samples\n(n = 9) at P0, 36 nerves were pooled to nine experimental\npooled to eight experimental samples (n = 8) for adult mice,\nand total RNA was isolated using ZR RNA MicroPrepTM Kit\n(Zymo Research). For both in vivo and in vitro studies, first\nstrand cDNA synthesis was performed using GoScriptTM\nReverse Transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer\nprimers (Roche). Primers for qRT\u00adPCR were designed with\nNCBI PrimerBLAST (Supplementary Table S1; available\nPrimer pairs were chosen to overlap exon/intron junctions\nto prevent amplification of genomic DNA. qRT\u00adPCR was\nperformed on the ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied\nBiosystems) with KAPA SYBR Fast Master Mix (Kapa Biosys-\ntems) or Power SYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The\nacquired mRNA copy numbers were normalized to the one\nof the 60S ribosomal protein subunit L13a. In vitro data\nrepresent the mean of 12 samples per condition derived\nfrom five independent experiments, and error bars indicate\nthe S.D. (standard deviation). In vivo data represent the\nmean of at least eight experimental samples per time point,\nand error bars indicate the S.D..

Eighteen cultures were\ninvestigated, complied by nine cultures per condition, de-\nrived from five independent experiments. The in vivo microar-\nray expression analysis was performed with 28 sciatic nerves\npooled to seven experimental samples (n = 7) at P0 and P10,\n20 nerves pooled to five experimental samples (n = 5) at P4\nand P7 and six nerves pooled to three experimental sam-\nples (n = 3) at P60. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy\nMicro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's proto-\ncol. All RNA samples had an RIN (RNA integrity number) of\nabove 8, verified with the Agilent Bioanalyzer system (Agi-\nlent Technologies). RNA amplification, biotinylation, in vitro\ntranscription and cRNA hybridization was performed as de-\nsion BeadChips from Illumina were scanned using the iScan\nReader (Illumina), and global median normalization of gene\nexpression was performed with the GenomeStudio software\n(version 2011.1, Illumina). One coding DNA sequence may\nbe represented by several distinct oligonucleotides (called\nprobes). For all examinations, probe-specific analysis was\nperformed, allowing to identify differentially expressed tran-\nscripts with high confidence. All data passed the quality con-\ntrol analysis as assessed by the Illumina on-board software\n(GenomeStudio, version 2011.1) and by PCA (principal com-\nponent analysis; Partek Genomics Suite, version 6.6, Partek\nInc.). Statistical analysis was performed using Partek Genomic\nSuite software (version 6.6, Partek Inc.). Differentially ex-\npressed transcripts were identified by a two-way ANOVA,\nand P-values were adjusted using the FDR (false discovery\nrate) method to correct for multiple comparisons (Benjamini\nand Hochberg, 1995). Significantly differentially expressed\ngenes were further analyzed with the IPA (Ingenuity Pathway\nAnalysis) software (Ingenuity Systems), the DAVID (Database\nfor Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (ver-\nand TransFind (Kielbasa et al., 2010). We provided the gen-\nerated database as an interactive search tool to analyze\nthe expression pattern of genes of interest upon forskolin\ntreatment.\nAntibodies\nThe following primary antibodies were used: anti-MBP\nDako).\nThe following secondary antibodies were used:\ndonkey-anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488, donkey-anti-mouse Dy-\nson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole) (1.25 g/ml; Molecular Probes) was used as\ncellular counter stain.\nImmunofluorescent microscopy\n10 m sections of fresh frozen torso of P7 mice were\nmounted on gelatin/chrome alum-coated slides, dried at\nroom temperature, and fixed for 15 min in 4% (w/v) PFA\n(paraformaldehyde) in PBS.

Pri-\nmary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4C\novernight. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies\nwere diluted in blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Stained sections were embedded in FluorSave\n(Calbiochem). For stainings of Schwann cell cultures, cells\nwere rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 4% (v/v) PFA in PBS\nfor 15 min. Further procedure was performed as described\nabove. Fluorescence microscopy images were acquired with\nthe confocal microscope Nikon A1R (40\u00d7 objective, numeri-\naperture 1.4), using photomultiplier tube detectors.

This\nsignal transduction pathway can be activated in vitro by\nforskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator. Since primary rat and\nmouse Schwann cells in cultures react distinct upon particu-\nlar stimulation reagents (Yamada et al., 1995), we examined\nin detail the effect of forskolin on gene transcriptional regu-\nlation in primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. Schwann cells\nisolated from sciatic nerves of P1 mice were cultured in the\npresence or absence of forskolin for 24 h. We ascertained the\noptimal forskolin concentration of 20 M, which resulted\nin robustly induced transcription of Mpz/P0, a commonly\nused marker for Schwann cell differentiation (D. Schmid, T.\nZeis, M. Sobrio and N. Schaeren-Wiemers, unpublished work).\nA whole-genome expression assay was performed to iden-\ntify transcriptional changes induced by forskolin treatment\nin mouse Schwann cells in vitro, and about 22000 tran-\nscripts were consistently expressed in cultured Schwann cells.\nThe generated database is provided as an interactive search\ntool to analyze the expression pattern of genes of interest\nupon forskolin treatment (Interactive Excel file; available at\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nD. Schmid and others\nforskolin-dependent transcriptional expression of genes that\nare implicated in Schwann cell development, differenti-\nation and myelination were analyzed (Table 1). For il-\nlustration, selected genes were schematically grouped ac-\ncording to their temporal expression in the Schwann\ncell lineage (Supplementary Figure S1; available at\nAnalysis of transcription factors revealed a strong induc-\ntion upon forskolin treatment for the mRNA expression levels\nof Egr3 and Oct6 (Pou3f1), a major target of cAMP signal-\ning in Schwann cells (Monuki et al., 1989) (Table 1A). In-\ncreased transcription was also detected of Krox24 (Egr1),\nthe Egr1-binding protein 2 (Nab2) and the inhibitor of DNA\nbinding 2 and 4 (Id2, Id4). Reduced mRNA expression levels\nwere present for the transcription factors AP2 (Tcfap2a) and\ncJun (Jun), which is in accordance to their down-regulation\nduring development in vivo (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky,\npressed in primary Schwann cells, no significant forskolin-\ndependent regulation was observed. Investigation of recep-\ntors, which were implicated in Schwann cell signaling, re-\nvealed that the expression levels of the tyrosine kinase re-\nceptors ErbB2, TrkB (Ntrk2) and TrkC (Ntrk3) were signifi-\ncantly increased by forskolin (Table 1B). Forskolin treatment\nled to a small reduction of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR\n(Ngfr), in accordance to previous reports on rat Schwann\nsulted also in increased transcription of the myelin-related\ngenes Mpz, peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22) and lipin1\n(Lpn1) (Table 1C). No transcriptional regulation could be de-\ntected for 2 ,3 -cyclic nucleotide 3 phosphodiesterase (Cnp),\nthe myelin-associated glycoprotein (Mag) and the myelin and\nlymphocyte protein (Mal), and reduced expression levels of\nplasmolipin (Pllp) and myelin basic protein (Mbp) were de-\ntected in treated Schwann cells. However, sequence analysis\nof the Mbp probes revealed that they code also for Golli\nMbp variants, having a distinct expression pattern and func-\ntion during glia development compared with classical MBP\nDuring myelination, the synthesis of large amounts of\nlipids is important for accurate myelin formation. For this\nreason, the effect of forskolin treatment was investigated\non the regulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis in\nSchwann cells (Table 1D). Significantly increased transcrip-\ntion levels were detected for the stearoyl-coenzyme A desat-\nurase 1 (Scd1), the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase\n(Ugcg, Gcs) and the UDP galactosyltransferase 8A (Ugt8a,\nCgt, mCerGT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cerebroside\nOur data analysis revealed that forskolin treatment of cul-\ntured mouse Schwann cells led to up-regulation of a number\nof transcripts which are important during Schwann cell dif-\nferentiation in vivo, and to reduced transcription of genes\nknown to be expressed in neural crest cells and Schwann\ncell precursors in vivo (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky,\nForskolin-induced transcriptional regulation in\nSchwann cells\nTo further investigate the effect of forskolin on tran-\nscriptional regulation in cultured mouse Schwann cells,\nmicroarray data were analyzed more stringently using an\nFDR-adjusted P-value of <0.05. This study revealed that\nforskolin treatment resulted in increased expression of 330\ntranscripts by at least 1.5-fold, and in decreased expression\nof 305 transcripts (Supplementary Table S2; available\nAmong the 25 strongest induced genes, Mpz was the solely\ntypical so far known myelin-related gene (Table 2A). Strong\ntranscriptional induction was detected for the sclerostin\ndomain containing 1 (Sostdc1), the pleckstrin homology\ndomain containing family A (Plekha4) and the ECM (ex-\ntracellular matrix) protein spondin 2 (Spon2). Furthermore,\nincreased transcription was detected for the transcription\nfactor Egr3, as already stated before (Table 1A), the fibro-\nblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7), the endothelin receptor type B\n(Ednrb) and the proteoglycan decorin (Dcn), to name a few.\nStrongest down-regulation upon forskolin treatment was\ndetected for the mRNA expression levels of protocadherin\n1B (Pde1b) and leucine-rich repeats and transmembrane\ndomains 1 (Lrtm1), each represented by two transcripts\n(Table 2B). Olig1 was the only transcription factor identified\namong the 25 strongest reduced transcripts. Strong tran-\nscriptional reduction was also identified for the chondroitin\nsulfate proteoglycan 4 [Cspg4, better known as neuron-glial\nantigen 2 (NG2)], the proteoglycan aggrecan (Acan), the\nsecreted matrix Gla protein (Mgp) and the platelet-derived\ngrowth factor subunit B (Pdgfb). qRT\u00adPCR of these highly\ndifferentially expressed transcripts validated our microarray\nfor the one which were significantly increased upon forskolin\ntreatment (Figure 1A) as well as for the ones which were\ndown-regulated upon forskolin treatment with the sole\nexception of Nme7 (Figure 1B).\nIn summary, cAMP elevation led to differential expres-\nsion of more than 600 transcripts in primary mouse Schwann\ncell cultures. Among the 25 strongest induced genes, Mpz\nwas the only well-known myelin-related gene, disclosing the\npossibility that new genes important for Schwann cell dif-\nferentiation were identified by this microarray analysis.\nOlig1 expression in the PNS\nThe transcription factor Olig1 was identified to be strongly\ndown-regulated in forskolin-treated mouse Schwann cells.\nAlthough Olig1 is known to play an important functional role\nin differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Li et al.,\n2007), its expression in the Schwann cell lineage is not known.\nFor this reason, the expression of Olig1 protein was investi-\ngated on sciatic nerves of P7 mice.

One of the\nstrongest reductions could be detected for -dystrobrevin\n(Dtna), a member of the DGC (dystrophin\u00adglycoprotein com-\nplex). Furthermore, the transcription of syntrophin acidic 1\n(Snta1), also a component of this complex, was significantly\nreduced upon forskolin treatment, although expression levels\nof the other syntrophin isoforms were not changed. The DGC\nis linked to the basal lamina by interaction with agrin (Agrn),\nwhose mRNA expression levels were also reduced in treated\nSchwann cells, or with laminin. A reduced expression was\nidentified for laminin 2 (Lamc2), whereas increased expres-\nsion levels were detected for laminin 1, 2 (Lama1, Lama2)\nand laminin 1 (Lamc1) upon treatment. Investigation of the\nlaminin receptor integrin manifested that forskolin treatment\nreduced the transcription of integrins such as the integrin\nin primary mouse Schwann cells. In contrast, forskolin treat-\nment induced the transcription of integrin 4 and 8 (Itgb4\nand Itgb8), in agreement with a study reporting elevated\nintegrin 4 expression during development and upon\nforskolin treatment in rat Schwann cells (Feltri et al., 1994).\nCollagen fibers are another major component of the ECM.\nElevation of cAMP levels by forskolin resulted in induced\ntranscription of collagen type II 1 (Col2a1), in line with a\nprevious report on rat Schwann cells (D'Antonio et al., 2006),\nand collagen type IV 2 (Col4a2).

There-\nfore the expression data from naive and forskolin-treated\nSchwann cells and from sciatic nerve tissues taken from P0,\nP4, P7, P10 and P60 mice were examined by a PCA to visualize\nsimilarities or differences between the experimental samples\n(Figure 5A). Well-defined clusters could be identified for both\nuntreated and treated Schwann cell cultures (Figure 5A, red\nand blue dots, respectively). Additional distinct clusters could\nbe detected for samples of the different developmental time\npoints of peripheral nerves (Figure 5A, green dots). The PCA\nfor the developmental in vivo samples at P0, P4, P7 and P10\nshowed that the time points closely neighbor each other.\nP60 nerve samples formed an individual cluster, reflecting\nthat their expression is distinct. The PCA also illustrated that\nthe expression pattern identified in cultured Schwann cells\ndid not overlap with those of the peripheral nerve tissues,\nwhich is reflected by the dendrogram analysis of hierarchical\nclustering (Figure 5B).\nThe effect on elevated cAMP levels on the Schwann cell\nlineage was further investigated by analyzing only transcripts\nwhich were differentially expressed with an FDR-adjusted\nP-value <0.05 due to forskolin treatment (Figures 5C and\n5D). By PCA, distinct clusters could be visualized for samples\nof treated or untreated Schwann cell cultures (Figure 5C).\nHierarchical cluster analysis revealed further that forskolin-\ntreated Schwann cell samples associate within the same\nbranch as samples derived from the nerve tissues (Figure 5D,\narrow), indicating some corresponding expression pattern.\nStill, the majority of differentially expressed transcripts\nelicited by forskolin treatment do not resemble the in vivo\nsituation.\nDISCUSSION\nAccurate peripheral myelination depends on a variety of\nsignals and growth factors. Elevation of intracellular cAMP\nlevels by either db-(dibutyryl-)cAMP or forskolin is the clas-\nsically used stimulation assay to reproduce some of the as-\npects of Schwann cell differentiation in vitro, reflected by\ninduced expression of myelin-related genes (Monuki et al.,\nment on primary mouse Schwann cells was analyzed by a\ncomprehensive microarray study.

Schmid and others\nSchwann cell differentiation (Interactive Excel file; available\nFirst, we focused on genes that were reported to be\nexpressed at a distinct stage of the Schwann cell lineage\n(Supplementary Figure S1). In line with previous studies, we\nobserved induced transcription of genes expressed in dif-\nferentiated Schwann cells, such as the myelin-related genes\ncrease on mRNA expression levels could be detected for Mag.\nThis observation is in contrast to reports on rat Schwann\ncells showing increased protein levels upon db-cAMP addi-\nincreased Mag transcription after forskolin treatment (Ogata\net al., 2004). This discrepancy of Mag expression compared\nwith published literature might be explained by the fact\nthat Schwann cells derived from mice were investigated in\nour study, compared with Schwann cells derived from rats\nin the other studies. Indeed, we found no report analyzing\nMag transcription upon forskolin treatment in primary mouse\nSchwann cell cultures. We suggest that the effect of forskolin\nin respect to Mag transcription might be distinct between rat\nand mouse Schwann cells.\nInduction of myelin-related gene transcripts was also re-\nported in cultured Schwann cells upon adenoviral infec-\ntion with an Egr2-expressing construct (Nagarajan et al.,\n2001). In comparison with their study, we also identified\na down-regulation of genes expressed in neural crest cells,\nSchwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells, such\nas the transcription factors AP2 (Tcfap2a) and cJun or the\nadhesion proteins Cdh2 (NCad) and Cdh19. These observa-\ntions suggest that Egr2-dependent differentiation drives the\nSchwann cells predominantly into the myelinating pheno-\ntype, whereas treatment with forskolin additionally leads\nto down-regulation of gene transcripts expressed at earlier\nstages of the lineage.\nUpon forskolin treatment, we identified significantly in-\ncreased expression for the transcription factor Egr1 (Krox24),\na major transcription factor in nonmyelinating Schwann cells.\nThe induced transcription might be due to the Egr1 promoter\ncontaining a CRE (cAMP-response element) (reviewed in Thiel\net al., 2010). Furthermore, increased transcriptional activity\nof Egr1 by forskolin is in line with detected transactivation of\nEgr1 by CREB signaling in gonadotophs (Mayer et al., 2008;\nMayer and Thiel, 2009). Besides Egr1, also the related tran-\nscription factor Egr3 was significantly increased by around\n7-fold in treated Schwann cells. Enforced expression of both\nEgr1 and Egr3 by adenoviral infections led to increased p75NTR\ntranscription in immortalized rat Schwann cells (Gao et al.,\nsion despite increased Egr1 and Egr3 mRNA expression levels.\nHowever, the forskolin-induced increase of Egr1 transcrip-\ntion was modest compared with enforced expression by ade-\nnoviral constructs, speculating that a certain expression level\nand/or a distinct stoichiometry of Egr1 and Egr3 is required\nto modulate p75NTR expression. Analysis of tyrosine kinase\nreceptors revealed that transcripts coding for ErbB2, TrkB\nand TrkC were increased in treated Schwann cells, suggesting\nthat forskolin treatment not only activates CREB signaling\nbut also might influence other intracellular signaling path-\nways mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors in Schwann cells\nOlig1 as a new transcription factor in Schwann\ncells\nAmong the 25 gene transcripts, which were strongly de-\ncreased in forskolin-treated Schwann cells, we identified the\ntranscription factor Olig1. In the CNS, Olig1 is essential for\nthe differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into\nthe oligodendrocytes lineage, Olig1 activates Mbp transcrip-\ntion by interaction with the transcription factor Sox10 (Li\net al., 2007), which is also expressed throughout the entire\nSchwann cell lineage. However, the role of Olig1 in the PNS\nis not known yet. Although investigations of Olig1-deficient\nmice did not reveal major abnormalities of the PNS (Charles\nD. Stiles, personal communication), a functional role of Olig1\nduring peripheral nerve development or in regeneration can-\nnot be excluded. In cultured mouse Schwann cells, a signifi-\ncantly higher Olig1 expression was detected in the cytoplasm\ncompared with the nucleus. In the CNS, Olig1 was also local-\nized in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes, whereas nuclear\nlocalization was only detected for a short time period during\nThe cytoplasmic function of Olig1 is not yet entirely under-\nstood, but it was demonstrated to be crucial for elaboration\nof cell processes and membrane expansions in oligodendro-\ncytes precursor cells (Niu et al., 2012). Since glial development\nin the PNS precedes the one in the CNS, Olig1 expression in\nthe nucleus might be present at very early embryonic stages.\nBesides early development, nuclear Olig1 expression in oligo-\ndendrocytes was also reported upon remyelination (Arnett et\nal., 2004). In Olig1-deficient mice, remyelination failed due\nto impaired differentiation of progenitors, underlining its es-\nsential role in oligodendrocyte differentiation (Arnett et al.,\n2004). In line, we propose Olig1 playing an important role\nalso in Schwann cell differentiation, indicated by its strong\ndifferential transcription upon differentiation with forskolin.\nIn the PNS, Olig1 was recently reported to be up-regulated\nin injured nerves (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012), suggesting its\nexpression in Schwann cells during denervation and regen-\neration. Our immunofluorescence analysis on sciatic nerves\nrevealed that Olig1 was localized in regions correlating to\nnonmyelinating Schwann cells, which is well in line with the\ndecreased mRNA expression level upon forskolin treatment.\nIn addition, Olig1 could be detected in a subset of myeli-\nnating Schwann cells, but the immunofluorescent signal was\nvery weak. Furthermore, Olig1 mRNA levels slightly increased\n152 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nEffect of forskolin on mouse Schwann cells\nduring development, reflecting maturation of both myeli-\nnating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells. From our data, we\nintroduce Olig1 as a new transcription factor of the Schwann\ncell lineage, whose expression is negatively regulated by ele-\nvation of intracellular cAMP levels by forskolin.\nRegulation of ECM components is\nforskolin-dependent\nData analysis revealed that a set of differentially expressed\ntranscripts due to forskolin treatment are associated with\ncomponents of the ECM. Highly significantly increased mRNA\nexpression levels could be identified for the secreted ECM\nprotein spondin 2 and for decorin, a chondroitin sulphate\nproteoglycan known to be expressed in Schwann cells (Hane-\nmann et al., 1993). These data are in agreement with previ-\nous reports showing an up-regulation of decorin during em-\nbryonic Schwann cell development (Buchstaller et al., 2004;\nD'Antonio et al., 2006). Also the proteoglycan thrombomod-\nulin was increased in treated Schwann cells, in line with\ninduced expression of thrombomodulin in endothelial and\nleukemia cell lines after elevation of intracellular cAMP lev-\n1993). To investigate whether differentially expressed gene\ntranscripts might have a common function, they were an-\nalyzed in respect to their GO-annotations. Indeed, also this\nanalysis identified the term of `extracellular matrix' for both\nsets, either transcripts increased or decreased after forskolin\ntreatment. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that the\ninteraction of ECM with its receptors was enriched in differ-\nentially expressed genes.\nDuring Schwann cell differentiation and radial sorting\nin vivo, considerable modifications of the plasma membrane\noccur. The sole axon\u00adglia interaction transforms into a glia\u00ad\nglia interaction on one side, and an axon\u00adglia interaction on\nthe other side of the same membrane elongation. Hence, ex-\npressional changes of adhesion molecules and components\nof the ECM are vital for proper function and polarization\nin vivo. From our data, we conclude that one of the major\neffects of forskolin is the regulation of the ECM, indicating\nthat changes of the ECM also occur in Schwann cell differ-\nentiation in vitro.\nHighly significantly differential gene expression\ninduced by elevated cAMP\nSchwann cell development and differentiation are also in-\nfluenced by accurate levels of growth factors. Indeed, Fgf7,\nalso known as keratinocyte growth factor, was identified\nas one of the strongest forskolin-dependent increased tran-\nscripts in primary mouse Schwann cells. This finding is\nin accordance with studies showing that stimulation with\nforskolin led to increased Fgf7 expression in other cells,\nsuch as dermal papilla cells and primary fibroblasts (Iino\ngene transcript was Sostdc1 (ectodin, wise), an inhibitor of\nBMP (bone morphogenetic protein) and modulator of the\nWnt signaling pathways (Itasaki et al., 2003; Laurikkala et al.,\n2003). In the CNS, BMP and Wnt signaling pathways inhibit\ndifferentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into ma-\nture oligodendrocytes (Feigenson et al., 2011), leading to the\nhypothesis that also in the PNS, forskolin-dependent induc-\ntion of Sostcd1 expression consequently positively regulates\nglia cell differentiation. Another significantly induced gene\nwas the endothelin receptor type B. This receptor is cou-\npled to the adenylyl cyclase and was already shown previ-\nously to be expressed in immortalized Schwann cells (Wilkins\net al., 1997). This increased transcription does not correspond\nto the forskolin-dependent regulation of its ligand endothe-\nlin, which was reduced in treated Schwann cells. However,\nreduced transcription of endothelin is in line with its pro-\nposed function as a negative regulator of the transition\nfrom Schwann cell precursors to immature Schwann cells\n(Brennan et al., 2000). The strongest forskolin-dependent re-\nduction was detected for the transcription of the protocad-\nherin 20 (Pcdh20). This cell adhesion molecule belongs to\nnon-clustered protocadherins, and its expression was ana-\nlyzed particularly in the CNS (Pribyl et al., 1996). To our\nknowledge, Pcdh20 expression has not yet been investigated\nin the PNS. In primary mouse Schwann cells, we detected\nhigh expression levels of both transcripts in naive Schwann\ncells. Upon forskolin treatment, transcription of Pcdh20 was\nhighly significantly reduced, maybe reflecting morphologi-\ncal changes of the cells in conjunction with differentially\nexpressed adhesion molecules. Forskolin treatment resulted\nalso in strongly reduced transcription of the calcium \u00ad and\ncalmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1B (Pde1b). As for\nPcdh20, gene transcripts of Pde1b were strongly expressed\nin untreated Schwann cell cultures. This enzyme hydrolyzes\nthe second messengers cAMP and cGMP, consequently reg-\nulating their cellular levels (reviewed in Bender and Beavo,\nlevels of cAMP by forskolin treatment might directly sup-\npress the expression of Pde1b. The third transcript which was\nstrongly reduced in forskolin-treated Schwann cells was the\nleucine-rich repeat and transmembrane domain-containing\nprotein 1 (Lrtm1). In naive Schwann cells, a strong expression\nof both transcripts could be detected. The functional role of\nthe Lrtm1 protein is not known, but leucine-rich repeat pro-\nteins in general were shown to be involved in cell adhesion\nand polarization, cytoskeleton dynamics and neural develop-\nment (reviewed in Kobe and Kajava, 2001), proposing Lrtm1\nas a new candidate gene in cell adhesion in Schwann cells.\nAlso for PDGF, reduced expression was detected in differ-\nentiated Schwann cells, in accordance with reports showing\nthe functional role of PDGF in cell migration and prolif-\net al., 2013).

In line, Rac1 that was proposed as a putative nega-\ntive target regulator of differentially expressed transcripts in\ntreated Schwann cells, was recently identified as a negative\nregulator of Schwann cell differentiation by up-regulating\ncJun and down-regulating Krox20 through the JNK (c-Jun\nN-terminal kinase) pathway (Shin et al., 2013). Upstream\nanalysis further revealed that three members of the NF-B\npathway are putative target regulators. This is in accordance\nwith the observation, that the activation of NF-B is vital for\nperipheral myelination (Nickols et al., 2003). NF-B was also\nshown to be phosphorylated and activated by the PKA (Yoon\nDistinct gene expression between Schwann cells\nin vitro and developing peripheral nerves\nPCA demonstrated well-defined clusters of developing pe-\nripheral nerves in vivo, represented by the time points P0, P4,\nP7 and P10. Samples of mature sciatic nerves at P60 consti-\ntuted a separate cluster, indicating distinct gene expression\ncompared with earlier time points. Distinct clusters could\nalso be visualized for treated as well as untreated Schwann\ncells. Comparison of gene expression between samples de-\nrived from primary mouse Schwann cells and samples of de-\nveloping sciatic nerves revealed significant differences. The\ndifferences in gene expression between in vivo and in vitro\nmight be explained by the fact that there is a constant inter-\naction and reciprocal signaling between axons and Schwann\ncells in vivo, which is absent in primary mouse Schwann\ncell cultures. Furthermore, the in vivo system is more com-\nplex, since other cells such as endothelial cells and fibro-\nblasts are present in the nerve as well. Cultured Schwann\ncells are more synchronized, in contrast to Schwann cells in\nperipheral nerves, where an overlap of distinct Schwann cell\nstages can be observed during early development. These data\nindicate that caution has to be exercised when comparing\nprimary Schwann cell cultures with in vivo analysis, despite\nthe finding that forskolin-treated Schwann cells associate\nwithin the same branch of the dendrogram as the nerve\nsamples.\nConclusion\nThis work aims to improve the knowledge of intracellular\nsignaling in mouse Schwann cells. Forskolin treatment of\nprimary Schwann cells confirmed the increased transcription\nof genes involved in Schwann cell differentiation and the\nreduced transcription of genes known in neural crest cells\nand Schwann cell precursors. Comprehensive data analysis\nof a whole-genome microarray further identified a number\nof differentially regulated transcripts which have not yet\nbeen reported in Schwann cells. We identified the expression\nof both Olig1 protein and mRNA in myelinating and non-\nmyelinating Schwann cells, proposing it as a novel transcrip-\ntion factor in the Schwann cell lineage. From our study, we\nfurther conclude that a major effect of forskolin treatment\nis the regulation of components of the ECM, underlining its\nimportance during Schwann cell differentiation. In addition,\ntranscripts that were reduced upon treatment were often as-\nsociated with the MAPK and Rac1 signaling pathways, vali-\ndating previous studies. We provide the whole data set of the\nmicroarray study to offer an interactive search tool for genes\nof interest.\nDaniela Schmid and Nicole Schaeren-Wiemers designed the\nstudy. Cell cultures, immunofluorescent stainings and qRT\u00ad\nPCR were performed by Daniela Schmid, and the microar-\nray was performed by Thomas Zeis. Daniela Schmid and\nNicole Schaeren-Wiemers analyzed the data and wrote the\nmanuscript.\n"
