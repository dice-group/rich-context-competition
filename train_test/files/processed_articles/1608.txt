However, the con-\ntribution of viral hepatitis infections to CLD-related mor-\ntality has been difficult to determine.\nTraditional methods used to calculate CLD mortality\nusing death certificate data may result in underestimation\nof the proportion of CLD mortality attributable to viral\nhepatitis. These analyses use a single group of Interna-\ntional Classification of Disease (ICD) codes to define\ndeaths from CLD, which does not include one for viral\nhepatitis.1,2 Thus, deaths coded as resulting from viral\nhepatitis are not counted as CLD related. Further, causes\nof CLD-related deaths, when defined using traditional\nmethods, can be designated essentially only as alcohol\nrelated or not.\nPrevious estimates of viral hepatitis-related CLD mor-\ntality have relied on extrapolation of data from morbidity\nstudies. Population-based studies of patients diagnosed\nwith chronic liver disease have found hepatitis C virus\n(HCV) infection, either alone or in combination with\nexcessive alcohol consumption, to be the most frequently\nidentified cause (40%-60%), and hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ninfection to be related to a relatively small proportion of\ncases (15%).3,4 However, extrapolation from morbidity\nstudies may result in inaccurate estimates of deaths if the\nAbbreviations: CLD, chronic liver disease; AI/AN, American Indians/Alaska\nNatives; ICD, International Classification for Diseases; HCV, hepatitis C virus;\nHBV, hepatitis B virus; A/PI, Asians or Pacific Islanders; UVH, unspecified viral\nhepatitis; PBC, primary biliary cirrhosis; NCHS, National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; CDC, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nFrom the 1Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for Infectious Diseases,\nand 2Epidemic Intelligence Service, Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\nReprint requests to: Sirenda Vong, M.D., M.Sc., Mailstop G-37, Division of\nViral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road,\nCopyright \u00a9 2004 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.\nPublished online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com).\ncontribution of these infections to mortality differed from\nthat to morbidity.5\nWe report the results of an analysis death certificate\ndata that makes use of all the information available on\ndeath certificates to identify deaths attributable to CLD of\nany cause.

We used the record axis format, which applies\nan algorithm to what the physician enters on the death\ncertificate, to determine the underlying cause of death,\nconditions contributing to death, and relative importance\nof these conditions.7,8 This format applies standard crite-\nria to define the underlying cause of death and to improve\nthe internal consistency of each certificate.\nWe defined CLD as chronic liver disease and cirrhosis\natitis B, hepatitis C, and unspecified viral hepatitis infec-\ntions), and selected sequelae of chronic liver disease\ncoma, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome).\nWe selected all records on which any of these CLD-defin-\ning conditions were recorded in the underlying cause of\ndeath field. We then looked for a potential cause of CLD\nin the underlying or contributing cause of death fields and\ncategorized CLD cases into the following six etiologic\ndisease groups: alcohol related, HCV related, HBV re-\nlated, primary biliary cirrhosis related, unspecified viral\nhepatitis related, and no cause.\nWe calculated age-specific mortality rates by grouping\nage into 0 to 4 years of age and 10-year categories from 5\nto 14 years of age to 85 years of age. We calculated\nusing direct standardization with the 2000 census popu-\nlation.9 We used the following racial and ethnic groups as\nprovided in the mortality data: whites, African Ameri-\ncans, Asians or Pacific Islanders (A/PI), American Indians\nor Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Hispanics, and non-Hispan-\nics. We also examined the geographic distribution of\nCLD by state. Population estimates for noncensus years\nwere obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nWithin each group, a linear model was fit to the annual\nage-adjusted mortality rates to assess the significance of\nthe change in rates over time. The percentage change in\nrates was estimated using the linear model by dividing the\nestimated 9-year rate change by the estimated 1990 rate.\nBecause effective testing to diagnose HCV infection only\nbecame available in the early 1990s, we assessed trends\nand calculated the change in the mortality rate for CLD\nrelated to hepatitis C beginning in 1993.

A total\nof 68% of all CLD deaths among AI/AN were recorded as\nalcohol related. In contrast to 1993, the overall age-ad-\njusted death rate for HCV-related CLD exceeded that for\nHBV-related and primary biliary cirrhosis-related CLD.\nIn the HBV-related group, the highest death rates contin-\nued to occur in A/PI, and in the HCV-related group,\ndeath rates were highest among AI/AN, African Ameri-\ncans, men, and Hispanics compared with other racial\ngroups, women, and non-Hispanics.\nDiscussion\nTraditionally, CLD-related mortality data are tabu-\nlated and analyzed using the ICD-9 definition of CLD\nignation of alcohol-related CLD but not for CLD related\nto viral hepatitis,7 leading to an underestimation of both\nthe number of CLD-related deaths and the proportion\nattributable to viral hepatitis. Our study demonstrates\nthat by expanding the definition of death from CLD to\ninclude codes for viral hepatitis and relevant sequelae of\nCLD listed in the underlying cause of death field, the\nand the proportion of CLD deaths attributable to viral\nhepatitis increased by 19%. Further, in contrast to re-\nported trends defined only as 571 codes, the decline in\nCLD mortality observed during previous decades and sus-\ntained through the early 1990s did not continue after\n1994, largely because of increases in HCV-related\nFig. 4. Age-specific chronic liver disease death rates by race in the\nFig. 3. Cause of chronic liver disease related deaths in the United\nThe overall decrease in CLD mortality rates during the\nstudy period was 16% when restricted to the 571 codes in\nthe underlying cause of death field, but only 5% when\ncodes for viral hepatitis and CLD sequelae were included,\nsuggesting that decreases in CLD deaths not related to\nviral hepatitis were counterbalanced by an increase in\ndeaths from CLD caused by chronic hepatitis C. Large\nincreases in HCV-related mortality rates occurred begin-\nning in 1993, which likely were related primarily to im-\nproved awareness of and testing for HCV infection\namong CLD patients.11 Consistent with this explanation\nis the finding that the percent increases in HCV-related\nmortality were similar across all demographic groups,\nwhereas chronic infection rates are not.12 Nonetheless, by\n1998, hepatitis C was listed on the death certificates of less\nthan 15% of decedents, and no cause was reported for\napproximately half of deaths. In studies of patients with\nCLD, approximately 40% to 60% have hepatitis C and\nless than 10% have cryptogenic disease.3,4\nThe number of HCV-related CLD deaths identified in\nbased studies of CLD morbidity were used to estimate\nrelated CLD were estimated.5 These differences suggest\nthat, similar to findings of studies examining the accuracy\nof death certificates in identifying respiratory and cardio-\nvascular diseases as causes of death, hepatitis C may be\nunderascertained among patients dying of chronic liver\ndisease, underreported on death certificates, or\naware that addressed this issue by comparing mortality\ndata with medical records, the potential magnitude of\nunderreporting of hepatitis C on death certificates was\nestimated to be approximately 50%.17 If this estimate was\nconsistent across the country, hepatitis C should have\nCLD deaths in 1998. Alternatively, mortality from\nchronic hepatitis C may be much lower than morbidity\nfrom the disease.\nAlcoholic liver disease was the CLD cause most fre-\nquently identified on the death certificates and had the\nhighest age-adjusted mortality rate among deaths for\nwhich a cause appeared on the certificate. Other studies\nhave suggested substantial underreporting of alcohol-re-\nlated conditions on death certificates.10 The epidemio-\nlogic factors of alcohol-related CLD deaths we observed\nwere consistent with the demographic distribution and\ntemporal trends of heavy alcohol consumption in the\nUnited States,18,19 with higher death rates among men,\nAI/AN, and Hispanics and an overall 10% decline in\nalcohol-related CLD mortality during the decade.\nAI/AN populations carried a disproportionate mortal-\nity burden from CLD, highlighting the need for im-\nproved primary and secondary prevention measures.\nDeath rates among AI/AN were more than twice those of\nother racial groups, and in contrast to trends observed in\nother racial groups, age-adjusted rates increased during\nthe decade. Excess CLD mortality observed among\nAI/AN may be attributed partly to documented higher\nrates of alcohol consumption in this population.20 Al-\nthough death rates from non\u00adalcohol-related CLD were\nnot higher among AI/AN compared with other racial\ngroups, it is possible that because alcoholism is prevalent\namong AI/AN, deaths may be more often ascribed to\nalcoholic liver disease at the expense of other causes, com-\npared with other racial groups.2 The higher frequency of\nCLD mortality of unknown cause among whites com-\npared with AI/AN may be an illustration of this phenom-\nenon.\nHBV-related death rates were highest among A/PI, as\nmay be expected because of the high prevalence of HBV\ninfection in this population.21 We also observed high rates\namong AI/AN, African Americans, and persons of His-\npanic ethnicity and significant increases in death rates\nFig. 5. Age-specific chronic liver disease death rates by\nduring the study period among African Americans and\nHispanics. These findings are consistent with results of\nnational prevalence surveys,21 but to our knowledge have\nnot been reported previously. Results of catalytic model-\ning indicated a decline in the prevalence of HBV infection\nitor race- and ethnicity-specific HBV-related CLD mor-\ntality rates to determine if this predicted decline in the\nprevalence of infection is reflected in declines in mortal-\nity.\nDeaths from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were\nnot included in this analysis. The addition of 1990\nthrough 1998 HCC deaths would have increased overall\nCLD death rates only by approximately 4%, because\ndeath resulting from HCC is relatively uncommon com-\npared with death from CLD in the United States.22 How-\never, the effect of including HCC deaths on race- or\nethnicity-specific mortality rates is unclear; a published\nstudy of recent trends in HCC deaths in the United States\nconsidered only whites and African Americans.22 The\nfindings of this study with respect to the cause of HCC\ndeaths were consistent with those of this analysis of CLD\ndeaths in that the observed rising trend was attributed in\npart to increases in HBV- and HCV-related HCC.22\ncode causes of death on death certificates.23 When the\nnumber of CLD deaths in 1999 coded with ICD-9 codes\nwas compared with those coded with ICD-10 codes, the\nnumber of CLD deaths was 4% higher using ICD-10\ncodes.24 Some ICD-9 conditions such as \"alcohol depen-\ndence syndrome\" (303 code) and \"unspecified hepatitis\"\n(573.3 code) have been included in the CLD category in\nICD-10. Moreover, because of changes in algorithms for\ndetermining the underlying cause of death, CLD is se-\nlected as the underlying cause of death instead of, for\nexample, pneumonia, when both are listed in the death\ncertificate.24 However, the number of viral hepatitis\ndeaths was 18% lower when ICD-10 codes were used\ncompared with ICD-9 codes,24 mainly because human\nimmunodeficiency virus infection was selected systemat-\nically as the underlying cause of death when the death\ncertificate listed both human immunodeficiency virus and\nviral hepatitis infections. In addition, this revision carries\nforward coding conventions that may perpetuate under-\nrecording of viral hepatitis as a cause of CLD deaths.\nSimilar to the ICD-9 classification, the group of CLD\ncodes is divided into alcoholic liver disease and other\nchronic liver disease; there is no category in this group of\ncodes for viral hepatitis.24 Thus, the coding conventions\nwe have identified in ICD-9 that result in an underesti-\nmation of the contribution of viral hepatitis to CLD mor-\ntality are likely to persist with ICD-10.\nIn conclusion, this analysis highlights large disparities\nin CLD mortality, demonstrating the need for social and\npublic health interventions that target high-risk groups\nsuch as AI/AN and Hispanic Americans. CLD, as defined\nin ICD, cannot be used to monitor trends accurately in\nCLD mortality, and the divergence can be expected to\nincrease as more deaths from HCV-related CLD are re-\ncorded using viral hepatitis rather than CLD ICD codes.\nIn contrast to previously reported trends that relied on the\nCLD codes in ICD,25 after a decline in CLD mortality in\nthe early 1990s, overall mortality remained unchanged\nwhen an expanded definition of CLD was used. In gen-\neral, cause-specific mortality is reflected poorly in death\ncertificate data. Consistent with some authors' sugges-\ntions,26,27 future analyses of CLD mortality and its causes\nshould include viral hepatitis and sequelae of CLD deaths\nbecause of the narrow definition of CLD in ICD. Further\nstudies are needed to evaluate the validity of estimates of\nthe mortality burden from CLD generated from national\nmortality data and to characterize better the causes of\nCLD deaths.\nReferences\n1.
