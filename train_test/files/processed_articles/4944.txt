    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to identify gender differences in risk factors of fall accidents among older people, and whether\nthese factors differ between single and recurrent fallers. A total of 4,426 individuals aged 65 years from two large-scale\nhealth surveys provided data. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors and to determine the risk model\nfor falling and recurrent falling in men and women separately. Three major risk factors for falling regardless of gender or fall\nhistory are fear of falling, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), and age 75 years. Fear of falling remains one of the\ncommon modifiable risk factors. Among those without a fall history, the use of sedatives or tranquilizers increases the risk of\nfalling. Regarding gender differences, ADL limitations and fear of falling appear to be stronger fall risk factors for men than for\nwomen. Among women, alcohol use and educational level are significant risk factors for falling, while loneliness is associated\nwith recurrent falling. Men with fear of falling or ADL limitations are at higher risk to have a recurrent fall accident than\nwomen with these conditions. Having a visual impairment or living with someone is associated with recurrent falling among\nmen. Our findings emphasize the importance of multifactorial fall interventions, taking into account a variety of subgroup\ncharacteristics such as gender and fall history.\n",

Physical limi-\ntations, such as visual impairments, hearing disabilities, and\ndifficulties with performing activities of daily living (ADL),\nare possible risk factors for falling accidents (Sai, Gallagher,\nSmith, & Logsdon, 2010; Stalenhoef, Diederiks, Knottnerus,\nDemura, & Sato, 2007). There are multiple fall risk factors\nrelated to mental health, including fear of falling. This is an\nimportant predictor for falls: Older people who are afraid of\nfalling are more likely to fall, while those who fell in the past\nhave a significantly higher level of fear (Pluijm et al., 2006).\nFurthermore, common mental conditions among the elderly\n(such as depression) may cause an increase in instability (Turcu\nStalenhoef et al., 2002). Although studies on lifestyle-related\nrisk factors present different results, there is clear evidence that\ninsufficient physical activity and the use of sedatives and tran-\nquilizers increase the risk of falling accidents (Askari et al.,\ntude of the associated risk of fall accidents among older\nadults is uncertain. Many studies found no association\nbetween increased alcohol use and falls, whereas others\nreported a higher risk when consuming more than the\n\"acceptable\" alcohol standard (Reid, Boutros, O'Connor,\nCadariu, & Concato, 2002). The relationship between smok-\ning and falling accidents has hardly been studied.\nBesides the above-mentioned risk factors, another aspect\nassociated with an increased risk of fall accidents to be taken\ninto account is fall history. Recurrent fallers are often older\nand frailer because of comorbidity and/or other risk factors.\nThis group is considered a high-risk group that needs more\nstringent follow-up than those without fall history and may\nbenefit most from targeted treatment.

Fear of falling is more common in\nwomen than in men (Lach, 2005; Yamashita, Noe, & Bailer,\n2012). With aging, hearing sensitivity declines more than\ntwice as fast in men compared with women. Also, a low body\nmass index (BMI) is associated with hip fractures only among\nolder women (Bernstein, Grisso, & Kaplan, 1999). Despite\nconsiderable research in this field, there is no consensus\nregarding the main independent risk factors. Intervention pro-\ngrams should focus on these factors to prevent (recurrent)\nfalls among the elderly. Although not all fall accidents can be\nprevented, it may be possible to mitigate the risk factors.\nRisk factors for falls can be divided into modifiable and\nunmodifiable ones, but only modifiable risk factors can be\ntargeted by preventive interventions to reduce fall risk in the\nfuture. Taking into account the severity of the problem and\nthe need to tailor intervention strategies, possible risk factors\nrelated to falls among older men and women should be exam-\nined separately and whether there are differences in risk fac-\ntors for single and recurrent fallers need to be investigated.\nMany studies on falling accidents among the elderly focus\nonly on a few risk factors, have a small study population,\nand/or focus on elderly living in nursing care facilities and\nhospitals. Our study is unique in that we explore gender dif-\nferences in falling accidents in relation to multiple different\nrisk factors within one large population.\nThe aim of this study is to provide more insight into the\nrelation between the most common risk factors and falling\namong a representative sample of community-dwelling\nelderly who participated in the Health Monitor in 2008 and\n2010 (two large-scale health surveys among adult inhabit-\nants of Amsterdam and its surroundings).The acquired data\ncan be used to better tailor interventions in specific groups.\nThe following research questions are addressed:\nResearch Question 1: Which individual factors are\nrelated to fall accidents among older men and women?\nResearch Question 2: Are there differences in fall risk\nfactors between single fallers and recurrent fallers?\nDesign and Method\nSample Selection\nThe Public Health Service of Amsterdam conducts periodic\nlarge-scale health surveys to gain insight into the determi-\nnants of the health of citizens of Amsterdam and its sur-\nroundings. There were two large-scale surveys of interest:\nthe Amsterdam Health Monitor 2008 of the city of\nAmsterdam, and the Health Monitor 2010 of the surround-\nings Amstelland and Diemen consisting of the five small\nmunicipalities Aalsmeer, Amstelveen, Ouder-Amstel,\nUithoorn, and Diemen (for more information, see Dijkshoorn,\nEl Fakiri, Janssen, Ujcic-Voortman, & Verhagen, 2009 and\nhttp://www.ggd.amsterdam.nl/beleid-onderzoek/gezond-\nheidsmonitors/gezondheidsmonitor).\nThe design was according to the stratified design and\nweighting in Dutch regional health surveys (Uitenbroek, 2009;\nfor English translation, see http://www.quantitativeskills.com/\nsisa/papers/paper7.htm). Independently living participants\nwere drawn from the population registry, divided in groups\naccording to gender, age, and neighborhood. Each stratum\nconsisted of 200 participants in the city of Amsterdam\nMore participants were drawn in strata with expected low\nresponse. The resulting total numbers of correctly completed\nquestionnaires were weighted with respect to the response\nand total population in these groups.\nThe resulting total data were as follows: AGM 2008 (n =\nresponse rate = 55.5%). For the present analysis, data of\nrates among these groups were 59% and 74%, respectively.\nIn both surveys, there were no significant differences with\nregard to age group and gender between the non-respondents\nand respondents.\nQuestionnaire\nSelf-completion questionnaires were sent to the selected par-\nticipants. For specific groups, the questionnaires were provided\nin their own language. Questionnaires could also be filled-out\nonline, and if required, assistance by an interviewer was pro-\nvided. Non-respondents were encouraged by a reminder, and if\nneeded a second reminder or even by phone or visit.\nThe questionnaire was based on the national standard for\nthe Netherlands \"Local and National Public Health Monitor\"\n(in Dutch: Lokale en Nationale Monitor Volksgezondheid\n[LNMV]; GGD Nederland, ActiZ, & Rijksinstituut voor\nVolksgezondheid en Milieu, 2005). It included a wide range\nof health issues including physical and psychological health,\nhealth care use, and lifestyle. Specific attention was paid to\nthe health of older people, including additional questions on\nfalling accidents.\nMeasures: Outcome Variables\nParticipants were asked whether they had experienced a fall in\nthe previous 12 months, how many times they had fallen, the\nlocation of the last fall accident, if they had an injury due to the\nlast fall, and whether and from whom they had received medi-\ncal attention after their last fall accident. Elderly persons who\nexperienced one or more falls in the past 12 months are defined\nas \"fallers\" (individuals with no fall history) and those who\nexperienced more than one fall in the past 12 months as \"recur-\nrent fallers\" (individuals with a fall history).\nMeasures: Independent Variables\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Demographics and socioeconomic characteristics\nsituation (alone or with someone), and level of\nO and El Fakiri 3\neducation. Level of education is based on the highest\nacquired education level and divided into three cate-\ngories: low (elementary school or less), moderate\n(lower vocational, general intermediate, intermediate\nvocational or general secondary school), and high\n(higher vocational education, college or university).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Lifestyle included use of sedatives or tranquilizers\n(use in the past 2 weeks), smoking (yes or no), alcohol\nconsumption (meeting the standard acceptable alco-\nhol consumption or not), and physical inactivity\n(respondent meets the Dutch Healthy Exercise Norm\nor not). The standard acceptable alcohol consumption\nin the Netherlands is defined as a maximum of two\nglasses/drinking day for men and a maximum 1 glass/\ndrinking day for women (Nederlands Instituut voor\nAlcoholbeleid [Dutch Institute for Alcohol Policy],\n2009). The norm for healthy exercise is defined as a\nminimum of 30 min of moderately intensive physical\nactivity per day (Wendel-Vos, Schuit, Saris, &\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Physical health and limitations. For BMI (defined as\nan individual's self-reported body weight divided by\nthe square of the person's height--typically given in\nunits of kg/m2), four categories were distinguished\nfollowing the World Health Organization BMI classi-\nfication (World Health Organization, 2014): under-\n30). Visual impairment was measured with two ques-\ntions on the ability to read small letters and to recog-\nnize the face of a person at a distance of 4 m. Hearing\ndisability was also measured by two questions about\nfollowing and having a conversation with a person or\ngroup (Dijkshoorn et al., 2009). When one of these\nquestions is answered with \"yes, very difficult\" or\n\"no, I can't,\" a respondent is considered as having a\nvisual impairment or a hearing disability, respectively.\nTen questions assessed whether respondents had\nproblems with personal care, such as bathing, dress-\ning, eating, and mobility (e.g., getting out of bed and\nwalking across a room with limitations; Katz, Ford,\nMoskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963). When a question\nis answered with \"very difficult\" or \"only with help of\nothers,\" this is reported as an ADL limitation\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Psychological health. The following three variables\nwere examined: loneliness, depression, and fear of\nfalling. The scale of de Jong-Gierveld was used to\nmeasure loneliness (de Jong-Gierveld & Kamphuls,\n1985), categorized into three conditions: (a) based on\nthe total score (0-11), the respondents are divided into\ntwo groups: \"not/moderate (0-8)\" and \"severe/very\nsevere (9-11)\" burden of loneliness; (b) emotional\nloneliness: low emotional loneliness (0-3) and high\nemotional loneliness (4-6); and (c) social loneliness:\nlow social loneliness (0-3) and high social loneliness\n(4-6). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)\nwas used to measure the level of distress and severity\nassociated with psychological symptoms (Kessler\net al., 2002). Low scores indicate low levels of psycho-\nlogical distress and high scores indicate high levels of\npsychological distress.Two groups were distinguished:\nrespondents with a score 15 were considered as hav-\ning no or a low risk of depression, and respondents\nwith a score of 16 were considered as having a mod-\nerate to high risk of depression. With regard to fear of\nfalling, one question asked about the extent to which\nrespondents experience fear of falling (answered on a\n5-point Likert-type scale; Dijkshoorn et al., 2009).\nAnalysis\nParticipants aged 65 years and participants with missing data\non falling accidents were excluded from the analysis.\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe the frequency and\nproportion of outcomes of non-fallers, fallers, and recurrent\nfallers. Univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted\nto determine the relationship between the variables of interest\nand falling accidents in the last 12 months. Fallers were com-\npared with non-fallers, and recurrent fallers were compared\nwith participants who experienced no falls or only one fall.\nCrude odds ratios (OR) were calculated for women and men\nseparately and for fallers and recurrent fallers. In addition, vari-\nables with a significant relation were used to conduct multivari-\nate logistic regression analyses to create risk models for women\nand men separately, and for falling and recurrent falling.\nThe data were weighted on the basis of age and sex\naccording to the distribution of the population in Amsterdam\nand surroundings at the time of data collection (2008 and\nStatistical analyses were conducted with the SPSS ver-\nsion 19.0. For all analyses, a p value .05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\n(SD \u00b16.8) years. In the 12 months prior to the study, 34% of\nthe respondents had experienced at least one fall and 14%\nhad fallen multiple times (2 times).\nRisk Factors for Female and Male Fallers and\nRecurrent Fallers\nFor both women and men, significant relationships between fall-\ning and risk factors are found, except for smoking and BMI\n(Table 1).The risk of falling is higher for men than for women on\nall the significant factors, except for social loneliness (women:\n4 SAGE Open\nfall accidents in men with a moderate education level (OR =\n0.75), while consuming more than the acceptable alcohol\nstandard is a risk factor for women (OR = 1.29).\nThe results for recurrent fallers are similar to those for the\nfallers but show a stronger relationship for nearly all signifi-\ncant variables (Table 2). Both men and women with physical\nlimitations, who use sedatives or tranquilizers, and/or suffer\nfrom depression, loneliness, or fear of falling, are more likely\nto have recurrent falls than those not having these problems.\nElderly who are living with someone are less likely to fall\nthan those living alone. Similarly, physically active individu-\nals are less likely to fall than the physically inactive. In gen-\neral, respondents with a moderate (or higher) educational\nlevel are less likely to have a recurrent fall than those with a\nlow education level. However, this association is not signifi-\ncant among highly educated women.\nRisk Model for Falling and Recurrent Falling\nMultiple logistic regression analysis shows that elderly aged\n75 years who have an ADL limitation or experience fear of\nfalling, or use sedatives or tranquilizers are more likely to\nfall than those aged 65 to 74 years without these factors\n(Table 3). ADL limitations and fear of falling appear to be\nstronger risk factors for men than for women (OR = 2.02 vs.\nfalling). In addition, alcohol use and educational level are\nsignificant risk factors for women.\nIn general, the results of recurrent fallers are similar to\nthosewhoexperiencedoneormorefalls(Table4).Individuals\nwho are afraid to fall or with ADL limitations are more likely\nto have a recurrent fall accident than those who are not\nafraid to fall or are not ADL limited, respectively. Especially\nmen with these conditions are at higher risk than women\nTable 1.

Also, loneliness is associated with\nrecurrent falling among women (OR = 2.91). Older men with\nvisual impairment are more likely to have recurrent falls than\nthose without this limitation (OR = 2.75).\nDiscussion\nThis study has identified three important risk factors that\nincrease the risk of falls in older people, regardless of their\nfall history or gender; that is, age 75 years, having an ADL\nlimitation, or fear of falling. Elderly with a fall history and\none of the above-mentioned risk factors have a higher risk of\nfalls than those with no fall history. The use of sedatives or\ntranquilizers increases the risk of falling for both men and\nwomen, but appears to have no effect on recurrent falling.\nOther risk factors of significance in this study are gender\nrelated, such as alcohol use in women and visual limitation in\nmen.\nThese results support earlier studies reporting that about\none third of the people aged 65 years will fall during a\n12-month period, and that fall accidents are associated with\nmultiple risk factors. Similar to other reports, in the present\nstudy, age is a significant risk factor: As people get older,\nbalance reactions, increasing physical impairment, and other\nage-induced changes (such as vision) may increase the risk\nthat functional limitations (as defined by ADL limitations)\nare significantly associated with the risk of falling is also\nconsistent with previous research (Yokoya et al., 2007).\nFear of falling is a prominent symptom experienced by\nmany older people. In line with other research (Lach, 2005),\nour findings show that fear of falling is consistently associ-\nated with a higher risk of falling, and in case of a fall history,\nTable 2.

This reduced mobility may in turn increase the risk of\nfalling and social isolation and, in the long term, may lead to\nloss of quality of life (Austin, Devine, Dick, Prince, & Bruce,\nmodifiable risk factor, preventive activities need to be\nintroduced early on, and intervention strategies should take\nthis risk factor into account, for example, by increasing\nknowledge on how to reduce falls (Austin et al., 2007).\nIt is reported that use of certain medication, such as ben-\nzodiazepines and sedatives, is a significant risk factor for\npresent study, this risk factor only applies to individuals with\nno fall history. This is in accordance withAskari et al. (Askari\net al., 2013), who found a relation between the use of several\ndifferent drugs and recurrent falls, whereas no such relation\nTable 3.

Additional\nresearch is required to examine the effect of using these\ndrugs, as this is a modifiable risk factor that can be targeted\nby interventions. Contrary to expectation, the association\nbetween education level and risk of falling remains unclear.\nEducational level appears to be a significant factor for falling\nonly among women. Earlier studies also reported contradic-\ntory results: For example, whereas one study found that\nhighly educated elderly are less likely to fall (Gill et al.,\n2005), another showed that a high education level is a risk\nfactor for falling (Pluijm et al., 2006).\nFemales consuming more than the acceptable alcohol\nstandard have a higher risk of falling than women drinking\nno more than this standard, whereas this relation is not sig-\nnificant in males. This difference between men and women\nmay be explained by the smaller gastric alcohol metabolism\nin females, which increases the vulnerability of women to\nthe effects of ethanol (Baraona et al., 2001). Female recur-\nrent fallers who are lonely are more likely to fall than those\nwho do not feel lonely. This may be attributed to a reciprocal\ncausation; a fall accident may increase the feeling of being\nlonely and vice versa. Elderly males with a visual impair-\nment have a significantly higher risk of having 2 fall acci-\ndents in the past 12 months. Also, among elderly males,\nliving with someone appears to be a risk factor for recurrent\nfalling. We have no explanation for this unexpected result.\nFurther research is required to examine this issue.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThis study is cross-sectional and therefore susceptible to\nreverse causality. Another limitation is the reliance on self-\nreports for all measurements. However, we believe that socially\ndesirable answers are unlikely to play a role when reporting\nrisk factors/fall accidents. Also, although participants' answers\nmay be affected by recall bias (e.g., they may not remember the\nexact number of fall accidents in the previous 12 months), our\ndata on fall accidents are in line with data from cohort studies\non falling among elderly (Stalenhoef et al., 2002).\nIt is known that neurological disorders are related to falls\nThe present study provides no information on the relation-\nship between chronic disorders, for example, neurodegenera-\ntive conditions and fall accidents. Chronic diseases were part\nof the questionnaire, but three neurological diseases\n(Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy) were\ngrouped in one item. The risk factors in this study were\nselected based on modifiability (e.g., lifestyle, fear of fall-\ning) and/or targetability by preventive interventions. It is\npossible that some individuals in the study sample may have\none of these disorders. Nevertheless, we are convinced that\nthe influence of this small proportion is negligible.\nStrengths of the present study are the large sample of\nelderly men and women, the high response rate, and the\nconsiderable amount of information obtained on different\nrisk factors from the same sample. In addition, we investi-\ngated the risk factors for single and recurrent falls, taking\ninto account differences between men and women; these\nitems have rarely been addressed in previous studies.\nImplications for Practice\nBased on these results, multifactorial interventions focusing\non the risk factors for fear of falling and on ADL limitations\nmay help in preventing falls. There is evidence that multi-\ncomponent cognitive behavioral interventions can be effective\nin reducing concerns about falling (Zijlstra et al., 2009; Zijlstra\net al., 2011). Based on our findings with regard to gender dif-\nferences in risks for falls, more attention should be paid to men\nwith a visual impairment and to women who are lonely or who\ndrink more than the acceptable alcohol standard. Although\nphysical activity was not significant in the multiple logistic\nanalyses, fall prevention exercise programs for older people\nnot only reduce the rate of falls but also help to prevent injuries\ncaused by falls, including the most severe ones (El-Khoury,\nCassou, Charles, & Dargent-Molina, 2013; Karlsson,\nVonschewelov, Karlsson, Coster, & Rosengen, 2013).\nConclusion\nThe present study has identified several fall risk factors,\nincluding three major risk factors for falling and recurrent\nfalling, regardless of gender, that is, fear of falling, ADL\nlimitations, and age 75 years. In all subgroups, fear of fall-\ning remains one of the common modifiable risk factors for\nfalls. The use of sedatives or tranquilizers increases the risk\nof falling, but only among elderly with no fall history.\nRegarding gender differences in fall risk, ADL limitations\nand fear of falling appear to be stronger risk factors for men\nthan for women. In addition, alcohol use and educational\nlevel are significant risk factors for women. Men with fear of\nfalling or ADL limitations are at a higher risk to have a recur-\nrent fall accident than women with these conditions.\nLoneliness is associated with recurrent falling among\nwomen. Having a visual impairment or living with someone\nis associated with recurrent falling among men.\nOur findings emphasize the importance of multifactorial\nfall interventions for fallers and recurrent fallers and of tak-\ning into account gender differences in the aim to reduce falls\namong older people.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nReferences\nAllan, L.
