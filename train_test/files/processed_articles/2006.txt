Good prognosis among the overweight or obese elderly may reflect the relative\nsafety of storing the harmful lipophilic chemicals, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in adipose tissue rather than in\nother critical organs. Therefore, we hypothesized lower mortality among the obese elderly with a higher body burden of POPs,\nbut this pattern may not exist among the obese elderly with a lower body burden of POPs.\nPARTICIPANTS: Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999--2004 study with a mean 4.2-year\nfollow-up, we tested whether the association between fat mass and total mortality in 635 (652 for organochlorine pesticides)\nelderly participants aged X70 years differed depending on serum concentrations of 23 POPs.\nRESULTS: There were statistically significant interactions between fat mass and POPs in predicting total mortality. In those with\nlow POP concentrations, there was no obesity paradox; mortality increased with fat mass (hazard ratios about 2--3 in the\nhighest vs lowest quintile of fat mass). However, consistent with an obesity paradox, these patterns completely disappeared in\nthose with high POP concentrations. Compared with the lowest quintile of fat mass, statistically significantly lower mortality\nwas observed in the elderly in the third to fifth quintiles of fat mass. In the case of polychlorinated biphenyls, the mortality in\nthe highest quintile of fat mass was only one-fifth of that in the lowest quintile.\nCONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that adipose tissue provides relatively safe storage of toxic\nlipophilic chemicals, a phenomenon that could explain the obesity paradox. Although weight loss may be beneficial among the\nobese elderly with low POP concentrations, weight loss in the obese elderly with higher serum concentrations of POPs may\ncarry some risk.\nKeywords: obesity paradox; persistent organic pollutants; fat mass; elderly; mortality\nINTRODUCTION\nAlthough overweight and obesity are well-established indepen-\ndent risk factors for chronic disease development in the general\npopulation, numerous studies have documented an obesity\nparadox in which overweight and obese people with various\nconditions including old age, cardiovascular diseases, cancer or\nchronic kidney diseases have a better prognosis than do patients\nwith ideal body weight.1--4\nSeveral mechanisms have been discussed as possible\nexplanations.1--4 For example, the inaccurate assessment\nof body fatness by the conventional body mass index has\nbeen most commonly suggested as a potential explanation.\nHowever, studies using directly measured body fat mass observed\na similar obesity paradox.5 Other speculations include a survival\neffect, increased lean body mass, more aggressive treatment or\nbetter nutritional reservation among obese patients or the\nelderly,1--4 but data specifically supporting these possibilities are\nnot available.\nRecently, background exposure in the general population to\npersistent organic pollutants (POPs), lipophilic chemicals that\naccumulate in adipose tissue, has been strongly linked to a variety\nof chronic diseases.6--13 POPs, including polychlorinated dibenzo-\np-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), poly-\nchlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorines pesticides\n(OCPs) have been highlighted as being chemicals of concern.\nPOPs metabolize very slowly in humans, with half-lives of\nseveral years or decades. As the natural organ for storage of fat\nand fat-soluble substances, adipose tissue may be a relatively safer\ndepot for POP storage than other critical organs. From this\nviewpoint, high body fat mass may not be harmful or could even\nprovide the benefit of affording enhanced capacity for less\nharmful storage of POPs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the\nassociation between obesity and mortality would differ depending\non POP levels. Specifically, we expected good prognosis among\nthe obese elderly with a higher body burden of POPs, but a poorer\nprognosis among the obese elderly with a lower body burden of\n1Department of Preventative Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea; 2Department of Endocrinology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook\nNational University, Daegu, Korea; 3Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 4Department of Medicine, University\nHospital, Uppsala, Sweden; 5Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA and 6Department of\nNutrition, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

This hypothesis was tested in subsamples of the National\nfollow-up database. Fat mass derived from dual X-ray absorptio-\nmetry was used as indices of obesity.\nStudy subjects\nThe continuous NHANES, conducted annually since 1999 by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, is an ongoing survey designed to measure\nthe health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized US\nin a subsample different from the one in which other POPs were measured.\nThus, the final sample sizes were 635 for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs and 652\nfor OCPs, including subjects aged 70 years or older and followed up for\nMeasurement\nVenous blood samples were collected and shipped weekly at \u00c020 1C.\nPCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs and OCPs were all measured as individual chemicals\nby high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry\nusing isotope dilution for quantification. We selected 3 PCDDs (1,2,3,6,7,8,-\nhexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and\nOCPs (p,p0-DDE, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide and\nb-hexachlorocyclohexane) for which at least 80% of the study subjects had\nconcentrations more than the limit of detection. The fat mass was\nmeasured by dual X-ray absorptiometry using Hologic QDR 4500A\nfan-beam densitometers (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA).\nMortality follow-up\nProbabilistic matching was used to link NHANES participants with the\nNational Death Index to ascertain vital status. Matching was based on 12\nidentifiers for each participant (for example, Social Security number, sex\nand date of birth). Persons who survived the entire follow-up period were\nadministratively censored on 31 December 2006. Follow-up time for each\nperson was calculated as the difference between the NHANES examination\ndate and the last known date alive or censored.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, we checked whether there were statistically significant interactions of\nserum concentrations of individual POPs (tertiles) with fat mass (quintiles)\nin predicting total mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. Cutoff\npoints of tertiles of individual POPs were presented in Supplementary\nTable S1. In addition to individual POPs, we also used the summary\nmeasures of subclasses of POPs by summing the rank orders of the\nindividual POPs belonging to each subclass for subjects with detectable\nvalues of each POP, assigning rank 0 to values that were not detectable.\nSecond, we calculated hazard ratios on the associations of total mortality\nwith fat mass by stratifying subclasses of POPs, which showed statistically\nsignificant or marginally significant interactions. Adjusting covariates were\nage, gender, race ethnicity, smoking status and physical activity.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC, USA). Estimates of main results were calculated\naccounting for stratification and clustering,14 adjusting for age, gender,\nrace ethnicity, smoking status and physical activity instead of using sample\nweights; this adjustment has been regarded as a good compromise\nbetween efficiency and bias.14,15 As results were very similar with SAS 9.1\nand SUDAAN 9.0, we present the results based on SAS 9.1.\nRESULTS\nAmong 635 elderly with information on PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs,\nrespiratory disease and 43 others) died during the mean follow-up\ntime of 4. 2 years. Among 652 elderly with information on OCPs,\nthe number of deaths was 135. Data of the 635 participants with\nregard to distributions of several factors including demographic\nvariables according to fat mass are shown in Table 1. The elderly\nwith more fat mass were likely to be younger, women, non-\nsmokers and physically inactive. They also had a higher prevalence\nof diabetes or hypertension than the elderly with less fat mass.\nResults based on 652 participants with information on OCPs were\nsimilar to that shown in Table 1 (data not shown). Among all\nsubjects, compared with those with the lowest fat mass, the\n0.9 across fat mass quintiles.\nTable 2 shows P-values for interactions of fat mass with\nindividual POPs in prediction of total mortality after adjusting for\nage, gender, race, cigarette smoking and physical activity. Among\n23 individual POPs included in the analyses, all 3 PCDDs, 2 out of 3\ninteractions with fat mass in the prediction of total mortality. The\nsummary measure of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs also showed strong\ninteractions with fat mass. In POPs with dioxin activity, there was\nno clear pattern according to toxic equivalent factor. Among five\nOCPs, only heptachlor epoxide showed a meaningful significant\ninteraction.\nTable 1.

When the elderly had low levels\nof PCDDs, PCDFs or PCBs, those in the highest quintile of fat mass\nshowed about two times higher mortality rates compared with\nthose in the lowest quintile of fat mass. Adjusted hazard ratios of\nmass quintiles among the elderly within the lowest tertile of\nheptachlor epoxide belonging to OCPs. However, these patterns\ncompletely disappeared when the elderly had high levels of POPs.\nStatistically significantly lower mortality rates in the elderly with\nhigh fat mass (third to fifth quintile) were observed. The inverse\nassociation between fat mass and mortality was particularly strong\nwith PCBs; the mortality was one-fifth as great among the elderly\nin the highest quintile of fat mass compared with those in the\nlowest quintile of fat mass. The interactions between fat mass and\nPOPs were displayed in Figure 1.\nDISCUSSION\nAmong all subjects aged 70 years or older, compared with the\nlowest fat mass group, elderly persons who were in the third\nquintile of fat mass had a significantly lower mortality, and those\nin the fourth or fifth quintile of fat mass did not show increased\nrisk of mortality, consistent with the well-known obesity paradox\nin the elderly. Although methodological problems such as survivor\nbias, selection bias, lead time bias or, in meta-analyses, publication\nbias and confounders have been discussed in previous studies,2\nno explanation has yet provided data that clearly explained the\nparadox.\nThis study provides an avenue by which POPs and their storage\nin fat tissue could contribute to the obesity paradox in the elderly.\nFor example, when we restricted analyses to subjects with\nrelatively low POPs, there was no obesity paradox: compared\nwith the lowest fat mass group, the risk of mortality among the\nelderly with high fat mass was two to three times higher than\namong those with low fat mass. On the other hand, the obesity\nparadox was strongly observed among the elderly with high levels\nof POPs. When the elderly had relatively high POPs, those with\nhigh fat mass showed a lower risk of mortality than those with low\nfat mass. This finding suggests a possible protective effect of\nobesity against harmful lipophilic chemicals such as POPs.\nSupporting the idea that harm could occur if POPs were not\nharbored in adipose tissue, POPs released into plasma during\nweight loss among obese persons were associated with a\ndecrease in serum T3 concentration, resting metabolic rate and\nthe activity of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes.16,17\nBesides the elderly, the obesity paradox is widely observed\namong patients with a variety of chronic diseases including\ncardiovascular diseases or cancer.

One study reported that\nintentional weight loss among overweight and obese patients\nwith coronary artery disease showed marked improvements\nin obesity indices, lipid profiles and inflammation markers, but\nthere was only a nonsignificant trend for lower mortality,\nsuggesting that obesity might have some benefit that traded\noff against the beneficial effects of improving traditional CVD risk\nfactors.5 If obese elderly or patients with chronic diseases had\nhigh serum concentrations of POPs, our findings may indicate that\nfat mass has such a beneficial effect as a relatively safe storage\nsite of lipophilic chemicals such as POPs. If an elderly person\nwas found to have high POP levels, our findings imply that\ncareful consideration should be given before instituting\nintervention leading to weight loss. On the other hand, weight\nloss may be beneficial among the obese elderly with low POP\nconcentrations.\nImportantly, it is well known that spatial and temporal trends of\nPOPs vary greatly among populations.18,19 Therefore, the interac-\ntions between obesity and POPs in prediction of mortality may or\nmay not be observed depending on the distribution of POPs in a\nspecific population. For example, if a population was studied in\nwhich most people had high POP concentrations, for example,\nsimilar to or higher than the third tertile of POPs in this study\nsubjects, it may be difficult to observe the interactions between\nobesity and POPs in the prediction of mortality.\nIn fact, the relationships between obesity and POPs themselves\nare not simple. Multidirectional associations between these two\nclosely related factors are possible. Obesity itself can increase the\nhalf-lives of POPs.20 At the same time, exposure to low-level POPs\ncan itself cause obesity even though high-dose POPs can lead to\nweight loss, likely due to cell toxicity.12,21 In addition, weight loss\nleads to increased serum concentrations of POPs, whereas weight\ngain leads to decreased serum POPs.22 Among the elderly, the\nevolution of obesity over time during adulthood and aging-related\nbody composition and fat distribution changes may affect the\ndynamics of POPs in the body. It would be desirable to\ndisentangle these complicated relationships in studies that\ninclude repeated measurements of fat mass and concentrations\nof POPs with follow-up for incident disease and intermediate\nfactors.\nOne limitation of this study was that, although power was\nadequate for the study of total mortality, we had restricted power for\nanalysis of cause-specific mortality due to the small number of death\ncases. Nevertheless, when we applied the same analyses to the 51\ncardiovascular deaths, we observed a similar pattern of interaction\nbetween fat mass and POPs. In addition, the elderly within the lowest\ntertile of POPs are not sufficient to evaluate the pure effect of obesity\non mortality, because of strong correlations of POPs with age, so that\neven the lowest tertile had substantial POPs concentrations. The\nslight decrease of mortality in the second or third quintile of fat mass\ncompared with the elderly within the lowest tertile of POPs might\ndisappear if analyses could be restricted to the elderly with less POP\ncontamination. However, in a modern chemically contaminated\nsociety, such a subpopulation may not exist. Finally, we could not\ndirectly test whether the same interaction between fat mass and\nPOPs on mortality is observed among patients with chronic diseases.\nOn the basis of previous findings on the associations between POPs\nand chronic diseases in the same NHANES data set, we could expect\nthat patients with these chronic diseases had higher concentrations\nof POPs.\nIn conclusion, the different associations between fat mass and\nmortality by levels of POPs are consistent with our hypothesis that\nadipose tissue provides relatively safe storage of toxic lipophilic\nchemicals. This phenomenon may contribute to explaining the\nobesity paradox. Additional research on this topic would be\nvaluable.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
