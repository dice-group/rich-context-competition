Because they identified three-way\ninteractions among smoking, history of estrogen use, and dietary and serum ascorbic acid in postmenopausal\nwomen, they analyzed these relations stratified by smoking and estrogen use. Dietary ascorbic acid intake was\nindependently associated with bone mineral density among premenopausal women (p = 0.002). Among men,\nserum ascorbic acid was associated in a nonlinear fashion with bone mineral density (p < 0.05), and dietary\nascorbic acid intake was associated in a nonlinear fashion with self-reported fracture (p = 0.05). Among\npostmenopausal women without a history of smoking or estrogen use, serum ascorbic acid was unexpectedly\nassociated with lower bone mineral density (p = 0.01). However, among postmenopausal women with a history\nof smoking and estrogen use, a standard deviation increase in serum ascorbic acid was associated with a 49%\ndecrease in fracture prevalence (p = 0.001).

A number of dietary factors\nhave been identified as associated with bone mineral density\nincluding calcium, vitamin D, caffeine, and alcohol.\nAscorbic acid deficiency has been associated with decreased\nbone density in a few experimental animal studies (2, 3). In\nanimals, such deficiency affects vitamin D metabolism and,\nin turn, the risk of osteoporosis (4). In humans, some obser-\nvational studies (5\u00ad12), but not all (13), have reported an\nassociation between ascorbic acid intake or blood levels and\nbone mineral density. Although marked abnormalities in\nbone metabolism and growth have been described among\nchildren with scurvy (14), the relation of ascorbic acid to\nbone density over a wide range of intakes and blood levels\nhas not been examined among a representative sample of the\nUS population.\nWe undertook this study to examine whether dietary\nascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid levels were\nassociated with bone mineral density and the prevalence of\nself-reported fractures among participants in the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III). We were specifically interested in whether\nlow serum ascorbic acid levels (<0.2 mg/dl) (15) were a risk\nfactor for low bone mineral density. Because other investiga-\ntors have described possible interactions between ascorbic\nacid and calcium intake (11), smoking (12), and post-\nmenopausal estrogen therapy (10) on bone mineral density or\nfracture, we also were interested in exploring whether these\nfactors modified the association between ascorbic acid, bone\nmineral density, and self-reported fractures.\nSubjects\nNHANES III was a national probability survey of approx-\n1994 that used a stratified, cluster sampling design to over-\nsample populations of special interest (16). Participants aged\nfrom 2 months to > 90 years were enrolled, interviewed, and\nexamined by study personnel (16). Our analysis used data\nfrom the examination, laboratory, and adult participant files.\nA total of 17,705 participants had at least some information\nmen between the ages of 20 and 90 years were available for\nanalyses examining the relation of ascorbic acid to self-\nreported fracture, representing approximately 86 percent of\nthe total number of adult participants with valid serum ascor-\nbic acid values. Because not all these adult participants\nobtained bone mineral density measurements, analyses\nexamining the relation of ascorbic acid to bone mineral den-\ncent of the total number of adult participants with valid\nserum ascorbic acid values. NHANES III recorded subjects\nextremely high serum ascorbic acid levels (>170 \u00b5mol/liter\n(3.0 mg/dl)) were excluded because such values were\ndeemed of questionable validity (15). Participants were\nexcluded if there were missing data on variables judged to be\npotential predictors of bone mineral density or if outcome\ndata on bone mineral density were unavailable. Comparison\nof participants included in analyses examining history of\nfracture with participants excluded for missing data revealed\nthat both groups were similar demographically, but excluded\nparticipants were, on average, 3 years older, more likely\nwomen (55 percent vs. 52 percent), to have attained a lower\nlevel of education (11.6 years vs. 12.4 years), and more likely\nMeasurements\nNHANES III questionnaire data included self-reported\nage; race (categorized as White, Black, other); sex; years of\neducation completed; level of leisure time physical activity;\nhistory of smoking; diabetes mellitus; level of alcohol\nintake; menopausal status; use of diuretic, cholesterol-\nlowering, and estrogen-containing medications; and dietary\nintake (16). We considered women to be postmenopausal if\n1) they were aged 55 years or if 2) they were younger than\n55 years, had a uterus and at least one ovary, were not preg-\nnant or breastfeeding, and reported no menstrual period dur-\ning the prior 12 months. Quantitative nutrition data were\ncollected using a 24-hour dietary recall. Because quantita-\ntive data on vitamin supplement use were not available,\nintake estimates were based solely on the 24-hour diet\nrecall. Body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) was pro-\nvided in the data set to the nearest tenth and was entered into\nall models in that fashion. The questionnaires, dietary meth-\nods, and examination procedures used in NHANES III have\nbeen described in detail (16).\nSerum ascorbic acid and serum vitamin E (-tocopherol)\nlevels were measured at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention by isocratic high performance liquid chromatog-\nraphy (17). Serum ascorbic acid levels ranged from 0.0 to\nthe upper cutpoint of 170 \u00b5mol/liter (3.0 mg/dl). Bone min-\neral density measurements of the proximal femur were made\nusing dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We used the bone\nmineral density estimates from the total proximal femoral\nregion for these analyses. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry\nscans were reviewed at the Mayo Clinic for quality control\n(16). We ascertained whether participants had a history of\nclinical fracture by a positive response to the following\nquestions: \"Has a doctor ever told you that you had broken\nor fractured your hip, wrist, or spine?\" (16). Radiographs of\nthe vertebral spine were not obtained.\nStatistical methods\nTo account for all exclusions in a consistent fashion, we\nused unweighted numbers when reporting the starting sam-\nple sizes, exclusions, and final sample sizes in each of the\nthree sex-stratified groups (premenopausal women, post-\nmenopausal women, and men) and for the number of\nfracture events. All prevalence rates, means, and standard\ndeviations are reported using sample weights. We used age-\nand multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression to\nexamine the associations of dietary and serum ascorbic\nacid level with bone mineral density and with prevalence\nof self-reported fracture among the three sex-stratified\ngroups. All the analyses take into account the complex sur-\nvey design of NHANES III. The level of physical activity\nwas analyzed as an ordinal variable. The multivariate mod-\nels included age; race; level of education; physical activity;\nbody mass index; cigarette smoking; alcohol consumption;\nthiazide diuretic use; diabetes mellitus; serum levels of\nvitamin D, vitamin E, and thyroid-stimulating hormone;\nand dietary intake of calories, fat, protein, calcium, and\ncaffeine. For premenopausal women, oral contraceptive\nuse, history of pregnancy, and number of livebirths were\nalso entered into the models. Among postmenopausal\nwomen, we identified interactions among smoking, estro-\ngen use, and bone mineral density/fracture by including\ncross-product terms in linear and logistic regression mod-\nels. We tested for but did not find an interaction among\ndietary calcium intake, ascorbic acid, and bone mineral\ndensity/fractures. All the variables included in the models\nhave been reported, in at least some studies, to be associ-\nated with bone mineral density. Serum vitamin E was\nincluded in the multivariate models because it an important\nantioxidant nutrient often correlated with ascorbic acid\nintake and may be itself a predictor of bone mineral den-\nsity. We tested for nonlinear relations by including linear\nand quadratic terms for dietary and serum ascorbic acid.\nFor men, the figures examining the relation of serum ascor-\nbic acid to bone mineral density and the relation of dietary\nascorbic acid to self-reported fractures are based on multi-\nvariate linear and logistic regression models, respectively.\nWe plotted predicted bone mineral density as a function of\nserum ascorbic acid level (within each 0.1-mg/dl increment\nof serum ascorbic acid) and predicted prevalence of self-\nreported fracture as a function of dietary ascorbic acid\nintake (in 1-mg/day increments). These predicted values\nwere then smoothed using a locally weighted symmetric\nnearest neighbor linear smoother (18, 19) that allows for\nAnalyses were performed using Stata Corporation soft-\nware that included commands for the analysis of complex\nsurvey data (22). For each predictor variable, we calculated\nslopes (for bone mineral density) and odds ratios (for self-\nreported fractures) with corresponding 95 percent confi-\ndence intervals. We considered two-tailed p values of <0.05\nto be statistically significant.\nAscorbic Acid and Bone Mineral Density 429\nRESULTS\nmen, aged 20\u00ad90 years and enrolled in NHANES III with\ncomplete data available for these analyses, are presented in\ncent) reported a history of one or more fractures. Of these par-\nticipants, 6 percent of premenopausal women, 18 percent of\npostmenopausal women, and 7 percent of men reported a hip\nfracture; 84 percent of premenopausal women, 74 percent of\npostmenopausal women, and 81 percent of men reported a\nwrist fracture; and 12 percent of premenopausal women, 18\npercent of postmenopausal women, and 16 percent of men\nreported a vertebral fracture. On average, men had higher\ncaloric intakes; greater dietary consumption of fat, protein,\nalcohol, and caffeine; and greater bone mineral density mea-\nsurements. We also examined whether the percentage of calo-\nries from fat and protein differed among the three groups.\nThere was no significant difference between premenopausal\nwomen and men in the percentage of calories consumed from\nfat or protein (both p > 0.05), but postmenopausal women con-\nsumed a slightly smaller percentage of calories from fat (p <\n0.01) and a slightly larger percentage of calories from protein\ncompared with men (p < 0.001). Standard deviations for serum\nascorbic acid level were approximately 0.4\u00ad0.5 mg/dl for the\nthree groups. The correlation coefficients between serum\nascorbic acid and dietary ascorbic acid ranged from 0.26 to\nbetween bone mineral density and self-reported fracture (ana-\nlyzed as a dichotomous variable) were \u00ad0.02 among pre-\nPremenopausal women\nAmong premenopausal women, increasing levels of dietary\nascorbic acid were independently associated with bone min-\neral density; each 100-mg/day increase in dietary ascorbic acid\nwas independently associated with an increase of 0.01 g/cm2\nin total hip bone mineral density (p  0.002) (table 2). Serum\nascorbic acid, however, was not associated with bone mineral\ndensity and neither dietary ascorbic acid nor serum ascorbic\nacid was associated with self-reported fracture (all p > 0.55).\nTABLE 1.

In the guinea pig, ascor-\nbic acid deficiency results in decreased collagen synthesis and\nbone density (2, 3), in part by affecting vitamin D metabolism\nand binding (4). Ascorbic acid has also been reported to affect\nmarkers of osteoblast activity (23). Ascorbic acid deficiency\nhas also been associated with osteoporosis in Black South\nAfrican men in several older studies (5\u00ad7). More recent stud-\nies have examined dietary and supplement intake of ascorbic\nhip fracture (12). With the exception of the Honolulu Heart\nStudy that included 1,208 men of Japanese ancestry (24), these\nhave examined the relation of blood ascorbic acid levels to\nbone mineral density or fracture. The prior studies have mea-\nsured bone mineral density at different sites and reported,\nalbeit inconsistently, a positive association between dietary\nascorbic acid consumption or supplement use and bone min-\neral density. We tested for nonlinear associations and found\nseveral significant or marginally significant curvilinear associ-\nations, particularly among men. Although osteoporosis affects\napproximately one of eight men (28), most of the studies\nexamining the relation of ascorbic acid to bone mineral den-\nsity have focused on women and, hence, we are unable to\ncompare our findings among men with those of other pub-\nlished studies.\nSome investigators found ascorbic acid associated with\nbone mineral density or hip fracture only among subgroups\nof women (10\u00ad12). Although we were unable to detect an\ninteraction between ascorbic acid and calcium intake, we\ndid find that smoking and use of postmenopausal estrogens\nmodified the association of ascorbic acid with bone mineral\ndensity or self-reported fracture. We found that increasing\nserum ascorbic acid levels were associated with a decreased\nprevalence of self-reported fractures among postmenopausal\nwomen with a history of estrogen use (and smoking),\nwhereas the Fracture Intervention Trial reported an associa-\ntion between ascorbic acid supplement use and bone mineral\ndensity, but only among postmenopausal women without a\nhistory of estrogen use (10). Although the explanation for\nthe differences between studies is unclear and may be the\nresult of chance, the interactions themselves were not\nentirely unexpected. Estrogen-containing medication\nincreases the turnover of ascorbic acid (29) and is associated\nwith lowered ascorbic acid levels in the leukocytes,\nplatelets, and plasma of guinea pigs, primates, and humans\n(30\u00ad34). Many studies have also demonstrated that smoking\ndecreases the absorption and increases the turnover of ascor-\nbic acid, thereby lowering blood ascorbic acid levels (15).\nOur study has several strengths and limitations worthy of\nmention. Because NHANES III surveyed a large probability\nsample of Americans, our findings should be generalizable to\nthe US population. We believe the slight demographic differ-\nences between the 86 percent of adult participants included\nand the 14 percent of participants excluded are unlikely to\nsubstantially affect the generalizability of our findings.\nFurther, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid levels on a\nAscorbic Acid and Bone Mineral Density 433\nlarge sample of the population allows a more reliable assess-\nment of ascorbic acid status as a correlate of bone mineral\ndensity compared with studies using dietary intake estima-\ntions only. We found a three-way interaction among ascorbic\nacid, smoking, and postmenopausal estrogen use. Because\nthree-way interactions are often difficult to replicate and may\nbe the result of chance, these results should be interpreted\ncautiously. We detected several nonlinear associations and\none inverse association between serum ascorbic acid and\nbone mineral density among postmenopausal women without\na history of smoking or estrogen use that were unexpected,\nand it is possible that some of these associations may also be\nchance findings. Measurement error as reflected in the rela-\ntively low correlations between dietary ascorbic acid intake\nand serum ascorbic acid level and between bone mineral den-\nsity and fracture prevalence may also be a factor in the incon-\nsistency of our findings. Most importantly, because of the\ncross-sectional nature of the study, inferences regarding\ncausality should be made cautiously.\nAmong a probability sample of the US population, dietary\nascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid levels were asso-\nciated, at least in some subgroups, with bone mineral density\nand self-reported fracture. These associations were inconsis-\ntent and similar to prior reports, and some were nonlinear.\nOngoing clinical trials of antioxidants for the prevention of\ncardiovascular and eye disease provide other potential venues\nfor examining these relations, unbiased by differential recall\nor unknown confounding.\n"
