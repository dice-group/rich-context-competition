In this paper\nwe compare estimates obtained using the automated Wordscores and Wordfish techniques, along with estimates from\nvoters and the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), against expert placements. We estimate the positions of 254\nmanifestos across 33 elections in Germany and Denmark, two cases with very different textual data available. We find\nthat Wordscores approximately replicates the CMP, voter, and expert assessments of party positions in both cases,\nwhereas Wordfish replicates the positions in the German manifestos only. The results demonstrate that automated\nmethods can produce valid estimates of party positions, but also that the appropriateness of each method hinges on the\nquality of the textual data. Additional analyses suggest that Wordfish requires both longer texts and a more ideologically\ncharged vocabulary in order to produce estimates comparable to Wordscores. The paper contributes to the literature\non automated content analysis by providing a comprehensive test of convergent validation, in terms of both number of\ncases analyzed and number of validation measures.\n",

Recently, the use of textual data has regained promi-\nnence with the advent of techniques for automated text\nanalysis (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). By using automated\ncontent analysis methods, the huge costs traditionally asso-\nciated with coding text are dramatically diminished, which\nopens a host of new avenues for data collection. However,\nwhenever a new content analysis method is proposed, vali-\ndation is needed in order to ensure that it can be appropri-\nately applied to texts and contexts of interest.\nIn this paper we evaluate two prominent automated con-\ntent analysis techniques. The first of these is the Wordscores\napproach developed by Laver et al. (2003). The second\nmethod is the more recently developed Wordfish approach\n(Slapin and Proksch, 2008). Our study contributes to the lit-\nerature by providing the first systematic test of the validity of\neach method's estimates of party policy positions based on\nthe same manifestos. We use a very rich set of textual data,\nallowing us to estimate a total of 254 party positions across\n33 elections. In addition to testing each method on a large\nnumber of party manifestos, we cross-validate the estimates\nComputers, coders, and voters:\nComparing automated methods\nfor estimating party positions\nFrederik Hjorth1,Robert Klemmensen2,Sara Hobolt3,\nMartin Ejnar Hansen4,Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard5\n Keywords\nText as data, automated content analysis, party positions, Wordscores, Wordfish, CMP\n1University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n2University of Southern Denmark, Denmark\n3London School of Economics, UK\n4Brunel University, UK\n5University of Copenhagen, Denmark\nCorresponding author:\nFrederik Hjorth, Department of Political Science, University of\nCopenhagen, \u00d8ster Farimagsgade 5, opgang E, Copenhagen K, DK-1353,\nDenmark.\nEmail: fh@ifs.ku.dk\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nagainst three different benchmarks, which provides assur-\nance that our findings are robust to the specific benchmark\nmeasure used.\nImportant past scholarship has demonstrated that legisla-\ntive speech can be used to estimate the positions of members\nof the US Senate and the UK House of Commons. Following\nBeauchamp (2012), we find that Wordscores correlates\nmore strongly with benchmark measures than Wordfish. We\nseek to test empirically which method, that of Wordscores or\nWordfish, is best at predicting the party positions expressed\nin party manifestos in multiparty systems over long periods\nof time. In doing so, we are able to provide guiding princi-\nples for researchers in search of valid estimates that can be\nderived from manifestos or similar textual sources.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Each of the methods is\npresented in the following section. Thereafter we discuss the\ndata and turn to a comparison between the obtained scores\nfrom the automated procedures and positions obtained\nthrough expert surveys, voter placements of parties, and the\nCMP RILE measure, which is obtained through hand-coding\nof party manifestos. In this context, we conceive of ideology\nas a latent variable. The best way to validate the automated\ntechniques is therefore to compare their estimates with a\nnumber of independent measures. As such, although we can\nnever be 100 percent certain that we are measuring ideology\ncorrectly, we can have good reason to believe we are captur-\ning this latent variable if we have several different measures\nusing independent sources of data that correlate highly.\nWe conclude that, across contexts, the supervised\nWordscores is the most promising automated content anal-\nysis method for placing political actors, achieving estimates\nwith high cross-validity with our three independent data\nsources. However, when party manifestos are long and\nwhen their vocabularies are politically polarized, the unsu-\npervised Wordfish produces estimates on a par with those\nof Wordscores. Consequently, the choice of which method\nto use should hinge on the quality of the textual data avail-\nable vis-a-vis the availability of prior information to pro-\nduce estimates.\nData\nOur analysis relies on the manifestos of Danish and German\nwhich amounts to 212 manifestos in total. In the German\nnine elections and 42 manifestos. The set of analyzed mani-\nfestos exactly matches those analyzed by the CMP.\nTable 1 provides summary statistics for the textual data\nanalyzed.\nThe cases of Denmark and Germany are suitable for our\nanalysis for several reasons. Here, we highlight four. First\nof all, the Danish party system underwent dramatic change\nduring the period we are investigating (Pedersen 1979). In\ncontrast, the German party system has exhibited consider-\nable continuity for the past four decades, even accounting\nfor unification (Saalfeld 2002). This allows us to test the\nability of the different techniques to detect dramatic changes\nin a political space.\nSecond, as shown in Table 1, the average number of par-\nties per election in Denmark is 8.2, far higher than the 4.7\naverage in Germany. As the number of parties increases,\nthe a priori difficulty of correctly placing parties within any\ngiven election increases factorially.1 This should, ceteris\nparibus, make the Danish data a harder test of each meth-\nod's ability to retrieve the correct left\u00adright ordering of par-\nties within each election.\nThird, as shown in Table 1, Danish manifestos are\napproximately eight times shorter than the German mani-\nfestos. Accordingly, it should be difficult for the automated\ntechniques to place the parties correctly on a political\ndimension. Proksch, Slapin, and Thies (2011) show that\nWordfish is capable of placing Japanese political parties\ncorrectly relative to CMP measures despite the manifestos\nbeing relatively short. By using a new source of relatively\nshort manifestos, this study provides an additional test of\neach technique's ability to estimate positions under condi-\ntions of limited information.\nFourth, the two cases differ in terms of the ideological\npolarization of political lexica. Grimmer and Stewart\n(2013) suggest that one reason why they are unable to\nreproduce valid left\u00adright estimates applying Wordfish to\nthe US Congressional record is that the vocabulary used in\nthe German manifestos is more ideologically charged. We\nrevisit the question of the role of ideologically charged\npolitical lexica at the end of the article.\nMethods\nAutomated methods compared: Wordscores\nand Wordfish\nSeveral methods have been developed to place political\nexcellent discussions of the various methods, and these\nauthors also discuss the pros and cons of using different\ndata sources. In this article we confine ourselves to discuss-\ning methods based on content analysis of text, specifically\nparty manifestos.\nA key difference between the two techniques analyzed\nhere is that Wordscores is a supervised method; that is, it\nrequires prior information to produce estimates. Wordfish,\nTable 1. Summary stats for German and Danish manifesto\ndata.\nGermany Denmark\nHjorth et al. 3\non the other hand, is unsupervised; that is, it produces esti-\nmates using only the information available in the textual\ndata itself.\nThe Wordscores method was the first automated but\nsupervised method of content analysis to gain influence\nwithin political science (Laver et al., 2003). The starting\npoint is to assign position scores to a set of \"reference texts\"\nwhose positions are known. Since the frequencies of words\ncontained in these texts are also known, it is possible to\ncalculate the value of each word that occurs in the reference\ntexts. The values of these words are calculated as averages\nof reference document scores, weighted by the posterior\nprobability of each document given that the word in ques-\ntion occurs within it. Policy position estimates for the \"vir-\ngin texts\"--the documents whose positions are to be\nestimated--are then computed as the mean of the scores of\nthe words in the reference text, weighted by their relative\nfrequencies within the virgin texts (Lowe, 2008). The\nWordscores technique therefore requires ex ante available\nestimates of the positions of the reference texts on the pol-\nicy dimension under investigation.\nA more recent approach to placing political parties is the\nWordfish approach. The Wordfish method has one consider-\nable advantage over the Wordscores method: It does not\ndepend on documents with ex ante assigned reference scores.\nPosition estimates derived using Wordfish are based only on\nthe information in the texts. This lack of an ex ante defined\ndimensionality is a double-edged sword: while Wordfish\nscales texts independently of prior information, it renders\nuncertain the exact nature of the dimension being estimated.\nOne important drawback of unsupervised algorithms is thus\nthat the nature of the dimensions produced requires intensive\nvalidation before they can be applied across different sets of\ntexts and contexts (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013).\nThe only input required by Wordfish is a word frequency\nmatrix that lists the frequency of each word across all docu-\nments. The Wordfish procedure then fits the frequency of\neach word j in party i's manifesto to a standard Poisson\ncount model, where the mean and variance \nij\nin each doc-\nument is assumed to be a function of the policy position of\nthe document, represented by the parameter \ni\nwith the policy position parameter, the model includes\nfixed-effects terms for words and document length.\nRegardless of the specific approach used, there are several\nreasons why computer-based estimation procedures are pref-\nerable to those based on human coders. For one, the reliability\nof the obtained scores is dramatically enhanced (Grimmer\ncosts of conducting the content analysis are reduced dramati-\ncally, which in turn vastly increases the text universe and the\nnumber of actors for which positions can be estimated. This\nleaves the crucial question of whether the computer-based\nprocedures can produce valid measurements.\nIn order to assess the validity of the two automated\napproaches to measuring party positions, we compare each\nmethod with three alternative measures based on experts\nand voter surveys and the widely used CMP dataset, which\nis also based on manifestos.3\nValidation measures: experts, voters, and CMP\nestimates\nWe analyze only the general left\u00adright dimension. The\nreason for this choice is mainly empirical. It is the domi-\nnant dimension of party competition in European poli-\ntics; moreover, it is widely accepted that party competition\nin Danish politics has been predominantly uni-dimen-\nsional and that the economic dimension has been very\nsalient in Danish politics (Hansen, 2008; Klemmensen et\nal., 2007). Similarly, while lower-order dimensions can\nbe identified, the economic dimension dominates German\nIn principle, the analysis could be extended to cover more\ndimensions.\nAs we conceive ideology to be a latent variable, the best\nway to validate the text-based techniques is to compare sev-\neral independent measures. The first measure we use is\nexpert survey estimates. As Benoit and Laver (2006) argue,\naverage expert judgments can be interpreted as a local con-\nsensus on the relative positions of the parties in a party sys-\ntem. We follow Klemmensen et al. (2007) and use the party\nexpert positions reported by Damgaard (2000). For the man-\nHill expert survey (Hooghe et al., 2010). The expert surveys\nwe use do not provide interval-level point estimates of party\npositions, only ordinal rankings of party positions.\nConsequently we rely on the rank order correlation measure\nof Spearman's  as the measure of association.\nThe second measure is the aggregated voter left\u00adright\nplacement of parties. We use the question used in\nEurobarometer surveys where respondents are asked to\nplace themselves on a 1\u00ad10 left-right scale. For each party,\nthe voter-assigned position is the value of this scale aver-\naged across all respondents intending to vote for that party.\nFor each election year, we use estimates from the nearest\nEurobarometer survey prior to the election.\nFinally, we validate the two automated techniques\nagainst the positions retrieved by the CMP data set's RILE\nmeasure (Volkens, 2013). The positions have been retrieved\nFor decades, the CMP data has had close to monopoly sta-\ntus in the comparative study of political processes, and con-\nsequently we believe that they serve as a sensible benchmark\nfor the automated techniques.\nAssigning Wordscores reference values\nAs discussed above, the Wordscores method requires that\nwe assign scores to a set of texts that serve as reference\ntexts, providing information on which values should be\n4 Research and Politics \nassigned to the individual words. For the Danish case we\nfollow Klemmensen et al. (2007) and use the expert esti-\nGerman case, we use the estimates from Debus (2008b) for\nGermany's 1998 election as references.5 In both cases, ref-\nerence texts are excluded from the set of virgin texts esti-\nmated by Wordscores such that they do not artificially\nincrease the correlations.\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the reference\ntexts and the virgin texts in their full and reduced forms. As\ncan be seen, the German texts are considerably longer than\ntheir Danish counterparts, making it possible for us to\nassess the robustness of Wordscores to the use of reference\ntexts of varying length.\nPre-processing\nBoth sets of manifestos are preprocessed according to stand-\nard procedures in quantitative text analysis: Numbers, punc-\ntuation, and white space are removed from each document,\nall words are converted to lowercase, and the most common\nwords, so-called \"stop words,\" are removed. Finally, words\nare stemmed using Danish and Germanic adaptations for the\nResults\nThe Spearman's  correlation measure we apply to the\nmethods is rather forgiving: A method only has to get the\nordinal ranking of the parties right--in the sense of being\nequivalent to the benchmark measure--in order to achieve\na perfect correlation. Hence, using rank order correlations\nensures that the observed correlation measures do not rely\non unreasonable assumptions, while remaining a conserva-\ntive test of the validity of each method.\nFigures 1 and 2 plot the Spearman's  correlation\nbetween Wordscores and Wordfish and each of the three\nbenchmark measures for Denmark and Germany respec-\ntively. The vertical black line in each plot represents the\naverage correlation across years. For Wordfish, which does\nnot automatically produce a left\u00adright direction of the esti-\nmates, we have chosen the direction that maximizes the\naverage correlation. Table 3 summarizes average correla-\ntions and reports the computation time spent producing the\nestimates.\nFigure 3 provides an alternative perspective on the data,\nyet reveals a similar pattern. The figure shows all estimates\nfrom CMP, voters, Wordfish and Wordscores plotted against\nexpert estimates across all elections. In order to ease com-\nparisons across different scales, all measures are standard-\nized within country-years.\nIn the case of Denmark (top row in Figure 3), Wordfish\nstands out from the rest, with a noticeably noisier associa-\ntion with expert estimates compared to the other three\nmeasures. In other words, across all observations in the\nDanish data, Wordfish estimates exhibit weak cross-valid-\nity with expert estimates compared to the other measures,\nWordscores included.\nHowever, results in the case of Germany (bottom row)\nare quite different. Wordfish and Wordscores are both\nstrongly associated with expert estimates in the German\ncase, and equally so. In other words, Wordfish performs at\nleast as well as Wordscores when applied to the German\ndata.\nDifference in cross-validity: manifesto length vs.\nideological strength\nThe difference in cross-validity obtained for Wordfish\nwhen comparing Denmark and Germany is probably\nattributable to the two key differences between the mani-\nfesto data sets described above: The greater length of the\nGerman manifestos and the ideological strength of the\nlanguage. In order to assess the relative contribution of\neach, we re-ran the analysis on a set of artificially\n\"laconic\" German manifestos reduced by randomly sam-\npling a number of words from each manifesto such that\nthe average length is comparable to the Danish data. The\nresults, reported in the online appendix, show that a sub-\nstantial part, but not all, of the relative advantage of the\nGerman data vanishes when using the subsampled mani-\nfesto data. As a rough approximation, this indicates that\naround half of the relative advantage for the German\nWordfish estimates is attributable to the difference in\naverage manifesto length, the other half stemming from\nmore ideologically charged language.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis study set out to test the validity of two prominent auto-\nmated methods for estimating party policy positions on two\nsets of manifesto text data that differed in the number of\nparty positions to be estimated, their average text length,\nand the strength of their ideological lexicon.\nTable 2. Summary stats for reference and virgin texts.\nDenmark Germany\nHjorth et al. 5\nWhile each method was tested against three bench-\nmarks, the results were remarkably consistent across all\nthree: When tested against the Danish data, Wordscores\nclearly outperforms Wordfish, exhibiting noticeably\nstronger rank order correlations with each of the three\nbenchmark measures. In the German case, however,\nWordscores and Wordfish perform equally well, correlating\nstrongly with each of the three benchmarks.\nHow to explain this rather stark difference across the\ntwo cases? One likely explanation is that the lower\nthreshold for number of words necessary for Wordfish to\nestimate positions accurately lies somewhere in the consid-\nerable gap between the (comparatively short) Danish mani-\nfestos and the (comparatively long) German manifestos.\nYet, as indicated by the analysis using the artificially\n\"laconic\" German manifestos, the difference is not due to\nlength alone. The relatively better performance of Wordfish\non German manifestos even when holding length constant\nillustrates the informational value (for estimation purposes)\nof a politically polarized vocabulary.\nFigure 1. Wordfish and Wordscores estimates' rank order correlations with CMP, expert and voter estimates for each election\nyear in the Danish sample. Vertical lines signify average rank order correlation across years.\n6 Research and Politics \nIt is arguably an important advantage of Wordfish that is\ndoes not require prior information in order to estimate text\npositions. This feature has the double advantage of making\nWordfish applicable in contexts where no such priors are\navailable and rendering the estimation process fully data-\ndriven rather than partly dependent on researcher input.\nHowever, as the results of this study show, this advantage\ncomes at a cost. When the available textual data is less\nplentiful and less ideologically polarized than is the case\nfor German manifestos, the validity of Wordfish estimates\nsuffers while Wordscores estimates remain reasonably\nvalid.\nIn Table 4 we summarize our recommendations for\nresearchers based on the results of this study. The recom-\nmendations should be read as a summary of the findings\npresented here. As such, their applicability in novel con-\ntexts is uncertain. With this caveat in mind, they may pro-\nvide some guidance for researchers. We recommend that\nresearchers use Wordscores if some ex ante position esti-\nmates are available; if not, use Wordfish, provided text\nFigure 2.

If this latter condition is not\nfulfilled, researchers should seek more data.\nBased on this study, neither of the two methods can be\nsaid to be superior regardless of context. Researchers would\nbe wise to take careful account of the context and quality of\nthe textual data available if and when settling on an auto-\nmated method for estimating party positions.\n"
