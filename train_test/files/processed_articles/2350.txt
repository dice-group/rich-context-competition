    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWe use 9 Add Health high schools with longi-\ntudinal network data to assess whether adoles-\ncent drinkers choose friends who drink, prefer\nfriends whose friends drink, if selection differs\nbetween new and existing friendships, and be-\ntween schools. Utilizing dynamic social network\nmodels that control for friend influences on in-\ndividual alcohol use, the results show that drin-\nkers do not strongly prefer friends who drink.\nInstead, they favor close friends whose friends'\ndrink, suggesting that alcohol matters for selec-\ntion on the social groups and environments that\nfriends connect each other to. The role of alco-\nhol use differs by whether friendships are new\nor existing, however, with bridging connections\nbeing less stable. Moreover, selection processes,\nand the implications of alcohol use for friend-\nship, vary in important ways between schools.\n",

By 12th\ngrade over 70% of teens have tried alcohol and low non-\ncontinuation rates below 10% indicate that most adoles-\ncents continue to drink [1]. The high rates of individual\nuse reflect the fact that teens regularly expose each other\nto alcohol. Approximately 50% of 12th graders report\nthey often drink in the company of other youth and that\nmost or all of their friends drink frequently, and 75% re-\nport that one or more friends drink until drunk each week\n[2]. As a common, socially embedded activity in adoles-\ncence, alcohol use taps into a core set of social behaviors\nnot condoned by adults but that are key to understanding\nadolescent society [3]. The purpose of this study, there-\nfore, is to examine the role of alcohol use in the friend-\nship formation (creation of a new friendship) and dura-\nbility (maintenance of an existing friendship) during a\ndevelopmentally important stage of life. We address this\npurpose by applying longitudinal stochastic actor based\nmodels of social network dynamics [4] to 9 schools from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health).\nSocial integration refers to the number of social rela-\ntions one has, in addition to the type and frequency of\ncontact [5]. We continue the traditional focus on social\nnetworks as indicators of integration [6], but take a dyna-\nmic view that considers friendship change and stability\nin peer relationships. We emphasize the role of homo-\nphily, the tendency for individuals with similar charac-\nteristics to befriend one another, as one important avenue\nby which alcohol use can promote social relationships\nthat foster social integration.\n*This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed\nby Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.
