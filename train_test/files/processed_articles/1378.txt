The\nassociation of homocysteine with blood pressure and with the risk of hypertension was investigated using cross-\nsectional data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998\u00ad1994). Homocysteine had\nan independent positive association with blood pressure after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. A 1\nstandard deviation (5 \u00b5mol/liter) increase in homocysteine was associated with increases in diastolic and\nsystolic blood pressure of 0.5 and 0.7 mmHg, respectively, in men and of 0.7 and 1.2 mmHg in women. Similarly,\nhigher levels of homocysteine were associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In a comparison of the\nhighest and lowest quintiles of homocysteine, women had a threefold increase in the risk of hypertension (95%\nconfidence interval (CI): 1.7, 5.4), and men had a twofold increase (95% CI: 0.7, 5.1). In light of the homocysteine-\nblood pressure association, the association of homocysteine with prevalent cardiovascular disease was\nexamined with and without adjusting for blood pressure. The results support a mediating role for blood pressure\nin women and suggest that the full effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular risk may be underestimated when\nblood pressure is adjusted.\nbiological markers; blood pressure; cardiovascular diseases; folic acid; homocysteine; hypertension; pyridoxine\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; DASH, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; NHANES III, Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey.\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovas-\ncular disease. Although its etiology has not been fully eluci-\ndated mostly because of as yet unknown genetic variation,\nmultiple nonhereditary factors including dietary and other\nlifestyle factors have been identified that have important and\nmodifiable influences on blood pressure (1). Nutritional\nadvice for the control and prevention of hypertension is\nalready substantial (2), but additional understanding of the\ncausal role of nutritional factors is important given the high\nprevalence of elevated blood pressure. Recent studies\nsuggest that mild elevations in serum homocysteine may\ncontribute to elevations in blood pressure. Although contro-\nversy remains as to whether the relation between homocys-\nteine and cardiovascular disease is causal or not (3, 4), the\nassociation of homocysteine with blood pressure deserves\nattention because blood pressure may mediate part of the\ncardiotoxic effect of homocysteine. Epidemiologic studies in\nthe past that controlled for blood pressure or hypertension\nstatus may have underestimated the total effect of homocys-\nteine on cardiovascular disease risk.\nA causal link between homocysteine and blood pressure is\nsupported by experimental studies. Animal studies report an\nincrease in blood pressure in response to induced hyper-\nhomocysteinemia (5, 6). Homocysteine may elevate blood\npressure through multiple mechanisms, including its effect\non vascular endothelial integrity. Homocysteine administra-\ntion caused direct endothelial cell injury in vitro (7) and in\nanimals (8). In cell culture studies, homocysteine induced\noxidative stress to endothelium (9) and reduced available\nnitric oxide, a potent vasodilator (10).

Second, the associ-\nation of homocysteine with prevalent hypertension was\ninvestigated. Finally, the association of homocysteine with\nprevalent cardiovascular disease was assessed to consider\nwhether the association was partly mediated by blood pres-\nsure.\nStudy population\nData on adults aged 17 or more years from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized US popula-\ntion were available from NHANES III (41, 42), a large-scale\ncross-sectional survey. The plan and operation of the survey\nhave been described by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (43). The Cornell University Committee on Human\nSubjects approved the use of these public-domain data.\nData collection\nSix seated measurements were taken for diastolic and\nsystolic blood pressure on two occasions: three during the\nhousehold interview and three during the medical examina-\ntion. Trained interviewers and physicians took measure-\nments using a mercury sphygmomanometer (W. A. Baum\nCo., Inc., Copiague, New York) according to standardized\nblood pressure measurement protocols recommended by the\nAmerican Heart Association (43). The average of all avail-\nable measurements was used in this study. A person was\nconsidered to have hypertension if blood pressure met the\ndefinition of stage 2 hypertension: elevated systolic blood\npressure (160 mmHg), elevated diastolic blood pressure\n(100 mmHg), both, or use of antihypertensive medications\nBlood was collected and sera were stored at \u00ad70\u00b0C until\nanalysis. Homocysteine was measured only in the second\nchromatography (coefficient of variation, <6 percent) at the\nUS Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research\nCenter on Aging (46). Other biologic markers of nutritional\nstatus, including B vitamins, antioxidants, and lipids, were\nassayed at the National Center for Environmental Health\n(46). Questionnaires filled out at the household interview\nand medical examination provided information on demo-\ngraphics, dietary intake, and lifestyle factors.\nStatistical analysis\nWith the use of linear (continuous blood pressure\noutcome) and logistic (dichotomous hypertension outcome)\nregression analyses, men and women were considered in\nseparate models after statistically significant effect modifi-\ncation of the homocysteine-blood pressure association by\nsex was found in a combined model. Sex-specific models\nalso facilitated the consideration of sex-specific confounding\nvariables. Metabolic (serum homocysteine, log transformed)\nand nutritional (red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12\n,\ndietary intake of vitamin B6\n) variables were considered alone\nand simultaneously to allow for direct and indirect effects.\nAll regression models were adjusted for the complex\nsampling design by SUDAAN software (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), and anal-\nyses were weighted according to National Center for Health\nStatistics guidelines (47) to account for oversampling of\ncertain age, sex, race/ethnicity domains, and differential\nnonresponse or undercoverage. In all models, potential\nconfounding variables were carefully considered in light of\nproposed mechanisms.\nRESULTS\nNHANES III data on 7,612 adults with homocysteine and\nblood pressure measurements comprised the study sample. A\ntotal of 376 persons were excluded because of mixed race/\nethnicity, as recommended by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (41). In analyses of blood pressure (continuous\noutcome), a further 1,258 persons were excluded because\nthey were either pregnant (n = 133) or were taking antihyper-\ncian-diagnosed cardiovascular disease), yielding 5,978\npersons for study. The analyses of hypertension (categorical\noutcome) included persons taking antihypertensive medica-\ntions as cases, yielding 7,103 persons for analyses of the\ncategorical outcome.\nThe mean level of homocysteine in the adults studied was\n9.6 \u00b5mol/liter (standard deviation, 4.8), comparable with\nsystolic blood pressure measurements increased by 3.7 and\n9.3 mmHg, respectively, from the lowest to the highest quin-\ntile of homocysteine, unadjusted for age (table 1). Serum\nhomocysteine was negatively associated with red blood cell\nand serum folate and serum vitamin B12\n, but the bivariate\nrelation with dietary vitamin B6\nintake was inconsistent.\nHomocysteine was positively associated with age, male sex,\npostmenopausal status (defined as age 55 years), renal\ndysfunction (defined by elevated levels of serum creatinine),\npercentage of current smokers, serum cotinine, and total\nserum cholesterol. Homocysteine was inversely associated\nwith high density lipoprotein cholesterol and serum vitamin\nC. In addition, homocysteine had a positive association with\ncaffeine and a negative association with mineral/vitamin\nsupplement use in the past month (data not shown). There\nwas little or no association of homocysteine with serum\nvitamin E, alcohol intake, serum C-reactive protein, poverty\nincome ratio, education, body mass index (weight (kg)/\nheight (m)2), and current use of estrogen supplements in\nwomen (data not shown). The association of homocysteine\nwith demographic and lifestyle variables was similar to\nHomocysteine-blood pressure association\nFirst, the homocysteine-blood pressure association was\nassessed. Much of the crude positive association of\nhomocysteine with blood pressure was explained by age and\nsex in model 0 of table 2. In sex-stratified analyses including\nsex-specific confounding variables, homocysteine was posi-\ntively associated with both diastolic and systolic blood pres-\nsure as shown in model 1 of table 2. An increase of 5 \u00b5mol/\nliter in homocysteine (about 1 standard deviation) was asso-\nciated with increases in diastolic and systolic blood pressure\nof 0.5 and 0.7 mmHg, respectively, in men. The association\nof homocysteine with blood pressure was stronger in women\nthan in men: 0.7 and 1.2 mmHg in diastolic and systolic\nblood pressure, respectively. The homocysteine-sex interac-\ntion was statistically significant for systolic blood pressure\n(p = 0.04), and there was little or no evidence of effect modi-\nfication by age in either men or women. In both men and\nwomen, further adjusting for red blood cell folate and dietary\nvitamin B6\nintake only slightly attenuated the relation of\nhomocysteine to blood pressure as shown in model 3 of table\n2. Excluding adults who reported a physician diagnosis of\ncardiovascular disease (n = 224) had little or no effect on the\nfindings, with the exception of strengthening the homocys-\nteine-systolic blood pressure association in men (coefficient\nRed blood cell folate and dietary vitamin B6\nwere nega-\ntively associated with blood pressure in models that did not\nadjust homocysteine, as in model 2 of table 2.

Among men, 1 standard deviation\nincrease in dietary vitamin B6\nintake (1.3 mg/day) was asso-\nciated with a 1 mmHg decrease in both diastolic (95 percent\nblood pressure. Serum vitamin B12\nhad little or no indepen-\ndent association with blood pressure and had little or no\neffect on the homocysteine-blood pressure association once\nfolate and vitamin B6\nwere adjusted (data not shown).\nOther potential effect modifiers and confounders were\nconsidered but not retained in the final models. Serum\nmeasurements of vitamin C and vitamin E were considered\nto test the hypothesis that homocysteine-related endothelial\ndysfunction is mitigated by these antioxidants (11, 12), but\nno effect modification was found (data not shown). Serum\ntotal and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were neither\neffect modifiers nor confounders of the homocysteine-blood\npressure association.

There was no evidence of effect\nmodification by alcohol intake.

To allow for nonlinearity, homocysteine\nwas categorized into quintiles: The trend in the risk of hyper-\ntension with increasing homocysteine quintiles was signifi-\ncant only in women (p for trend = 0.0001). Women in the\nhighest quintile of homocysteine had three times (95 percent\nCI: 1.7, 5.4) the risk of hypertension compared with those in\nthe lowest quintile. There was a positive trend in men, with\nmen in the highest quintile at twofold higher risk than men in\noutcome definition and/or refining the comparison group, for\ninstance by excluding adults who had a physician diagnosis\nof hypertension but no elevation in blood pressure and no\nuse of antihypertensive medication, made little or no differ-\nence in the odds ratios. Overall, there was little or no change\nin these estimates when adults with physician-diagnosed\ncardiovascular disease were excluded from consideration\n(data not shown).\nHomocysteine-cardiovascular disease association\nFinally, the association of homocysteine with prevalent\ncardiovascular disease was assessed. We first replicated the\nrecent findings of Morris et al. (49) and produced results\nclose to those reported (data not shown). We excluded adults\nusing antihypertensive medications because their medicated\nblood pressure is not a fair indicator of their usual blood\npressure, and the homocysteine-blood pressure association is\nattenuated in this subgroup. Next, we examined the\nhomocysteine-cardiovascular disease association in models\nwith and without blood pressure as a covariate (table 4).\nWhen blood pressure was omitted from the model, as in\nmodels 2 and 4 of table 4, the homocysteine-cardiovascular\ndisease association was slightly strengthened in women, but\nthere was little or no change in men. When women having\nmore than 12 \u00b5mol/liter were compared with women having\nless than or equal to 12 \u00b5mol/liter, effect sizes were about 20\npercent higher in models without blood pressure.\nTABLE 3.

In women, there was an independent association\nof red blood cell folate with blood pressure. Dietary vitamin\nwas inversely associated with blood pressure in men and\nwith systolic blood pressure in women. Higher levels of\nhomocysteine were associated with an increased risk of\nhypertension. In a comparison of the highest and the lowest\nquintiles of homocysteine, women had a threefold increase\nin the risk of hypertension, and men had a twofold increase.\nIn light of the homocysteine-blood pressure association, the\nassociation of homocysteine with prevalent cardiovascular\ndisease was examined with and without adjusting for blood\npressure. When blood pressure was omitted, the homocys-\nteine-cardiovascular disease association was slightly\nstrengthened in women, but there was little or no change in\nmen.\nThe findings herein are consistent with past reports that,\nalthough limited for various reasons, considered the relation\nof homocysteine to blood pressure (38\u00ad40). Araki et al. (38)\nreported that average homocysteine levels were higher in\nhypertensive compared with normotensive subjects. Sutton-\nTyrrell et al. (39) found an increased risk of isolated systolic\nhypertension in the elderly among those with higher\nhomocysteine. Neither study (38, 39) provided a quantitative\nestimate of the strength of the association of homocysteine\nwith blood pressure throughout its continuous range. One\nprevious study (40) reported that blood pressure was a\nsignificant positive predictor of homocysteine after adjusting\nfor age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, heart rate, and\nserum total cholesterol.\nRecently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, homocys-\nteine-lowering trial reported a decrease in blood pressure in\nresponse to treatment (51). Trial participants were siblings of\npatients with both premature atherothrombotic disease and\nabnormal postmethionine hyperhomocysteinemia. After 2\nyears of treatment with folic acid (5 mg/day) and pyridoxine\n(250 mg/day), diastolic blood pressure decreased 1.9 mmHg\ndemonstration of blood pressure lowering in response to a\nhomocysteine-lowering intervention in an at-risk population\nsupports a causal association. Furthermore, the trial results\nsuggest that the magnitude of the homocysteine-blood pres-\nsure relation may be larger than is evident from the\nThe association of homocysteine with blood pressure and\nwith hypertension was stronger in women than in men. This\nwas not due to a difference in the range of homocysteine or\nblood pressure, and there was no evidence for differential\nnonlinearity in the homocysteine-blood pressure association\nin men and women. A recent meta-analysis of prospective\nand case-control studies on homocysteine and coronary heart\ndisease reported a higher summary odds ratio of 1.92 (95\nbe done to delineate the reasons for the gender difference.\nContrary to two clinical studies where homocysteine-\ninduced endothelial dysfunction was attenuated by adminis-\ntration of antioxidants (11, 12), there was no evidence in the\nNHANES III data of effect modification by serum vitamin C\nor vitamin E. The antioxidant effect may be limited to an\nacute pharmacologic dose administered in the clinical\nstudies (1 mg of vitamin C and 800 IU of vitamin E/day).\nTABLE 4.

Thus, the findings may arise\nfrom reverse causality if high blood pressure aggravates\nrenal dysfunction, which in turn causes elevations in\nhomocysteine. Alternatively, renal dysfunction may be a\nconfounding variable related to both blood pressure and\nhomocysteine. In the NHANES III data, including renal\ndysfunction (defined by proxy as elevated serum creatinine)\nin the models had little or no effect on the homocysteine-\nblood pressure association. Similarly, the results were\nunchanged when we excluded subjects with prevalent\ncardiovascular disease or when we adjusted for serum levels\nof C-reactive protein. Thus, although cross-sectional studies\nare unable to ensure the correct temporal sequence between\nputative cause and effect, these findings suggest that the\nhomocysteine-blood pressure association was not due to an\nelevation of homocysteine as a result of underlying disease.\nHomocysteine may elevate blood pressure by causing arte-\nrial stiffness due to impaired vascular endothelial integrity\nand/or by reducing the efficiency of vasodilation (54).\nReduced methylation potential due to elevated homocysteine\nand S-adenosylhomocysteine may compromise the growth\nand integrity of the endothelial cells (55). In addition,\nhomocysteine generates free radicals during its autooxida-\ntion to thiolactone (56) and inhibits the expression of anti-\noxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (9). Other\nas yet unidentified mechanisms also may be at work (51).\nIn women, a small red blood cell folate-blood pressure\nassociation remained after adjusting for homocysteine\nlevels, suggesting an independent effect of folate. An inde-\npendent role of folate is supported by evidence that it regen-\nerates tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for the\nsynthesis of nitric oxide (25\u00ad27). Dietary vitamin B6\nwas\ninversely associated with blood pressure in men and with\nsystolic blood pressure in women. The association was inde-\npendent of homocysteine. This is consistent with previous\nliterature that reported an independent vitamin B6\n-cardiovas-\nThe findings herein support an association of homocys-\nteine with blood pressure. Given within-subject variability in\na single homocysteine measurement, the observed associa-\ntion may underestimate the true association by about 15\npercent due to regression-dilution bias (59). Thus, the true\neffect size for systolic blood pressure may be about a 1.2\nmmHg increase per 5 \u00b5mol/liter increase in homocysteine\n(effect size corrected for regression dilution: 0.8 and 1.5\nmmHg, respectively, for men and women). The Dietary\nApproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Study clearly\ndemonstrates the importance of dietary factors in lowering\nblood pressure. The DASH Study diet lowered systolic\nblood pressure by 5 mmHg compared with the usual Amer-\nican diet when both diets had the same intermediate level of\nsodium intake (60). Further work (61) suggested that folate\nintake comprises part of the difference between the DASH\nStudy diet and the usual American diet (168 \u00b5g/day on an\nAmerican diet vs. 418 \u00b5g/day on the DASH Study diet).\nThese results suggest the potential contribution of folate,\nperhaps mediated by homocysteine lowering, in blood pres-\nsure reduction. Thus, the current finding of an association of\nhomocysteine and blood pressure, if causal, would mean that\nhomocysteine lowering leads to reduced blood pressure with\nattendant public health benefits (1).\nAll prospective epidemiologic studies that examined the\nrelation of homocysteine to coronary heart disease or stroke\ncontrolled for either blood pressure (62\u00ad65) or hypertension\nstudies using the NHANES III data also controlled for blood\npressure in estimating the association of homocysteine with\ncardiovascular disease (49) and stroke (31). However, if the\neffect of homocysteine on cardiovascular outcomes is partly\nmediated by blood pressure, statistical adjustment for blood\npressure or hypertension status would lead to an underesti-\nmation of the total effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular\ndisease (72). The cross-sectional NHANES III data, which\ncomprise prevalent cases, are of limited use for this kind of\nanalysis. Although the results suggest a stronger association\nof homocysteine with cardiovascular outcomes when blood\npressure was omitted as a covariate, particularly among\nwomen, this issue deserves to be addressed with prospective\ndata.\nThis study found an independent association of homocys-\nteine with blood pressure. Serum homocysteine levels were\npositively associated with blood pressure and with the risk of\nhypertension, confirming reports from animal experiments\n(5, 6) and a small intervention trial in an at-risk population\n(51). Considering that these cross-sectional findings may be\naffected by lifestyle or dietary changes that lower homocys-\nteine in people with high blood pressure, the homocysteine-\nblood pressure association should be investigated further in a\nprospective study. In addition, estimation of the magnitude\nof the association of homocysteine with cardiovascular\noutcomes should consider the mediating role of blood pres-\nsure. Finally, a direct effect of folate supplementation on\nblood pressure should be considered in examining the\nbenefit of folate intervention and/or food fortification\nprograms relative to the prevention of cardiovascular\nmorbidity.\n"
