Perhaps the most popular\nexample is the bouba-kiki effect according to which some auditory stimuli (e.g., kiki)\nsounds more spiky than others (e.g., bouba; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). Several\nCMCs have been discovered over the years, and some of them revealed quite unexpected\nassociations. For instance, most people think that lemons are fast rather than slow (Woods,\nSpence, Butcher, & Deroy, 2013), that boulders are sour rather than sweet (Brown, 1958), and\nthat red is heavier than yellow (Alexander & Shansky, 1976). There is actually more in CMCs\nthan first meets the eye since they may provide useful hints to understand mental phenomena\nsuch as synesthesia (when a stimulation in one sensory modality automatically activate\nexperience in another sensory modality) and shed light on the evolution of language\nTwo different sets of hypothesis are currently battling. The sensory hypothesis suggests that\nCMCs are mild forms of synesthesia that rely on correspondences between low-level sensory\nprocesses (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). In other words, our visuohaptic experience of\nboulders and our gustatory experience of sourness share some common neural codes that\nmake them similar, across senses, as the taste of lemons and oranges is similar within the\nsame sensory domain.\nThe semantic hypothesis instead suggests than CMCs reflect higher level (postsensory)\nFor instance, a heavy anonymous boulder may remind us the sourness of life rather than,\nlet's say, the sweetness of love.\nDisentangling the two hypotheses is hard, especially because perceptual experience and\nsemantic knowledge are usually correlated: We talk about what we perceive, and perceptual\nsimilarity can be encoded in language statistics (Louwerse, 2011). Here we seek to contribute\nto this debate by studying blind people who, compared to sighted individuals, have a different\nperceptual experience of the world while being exposed to similar language statistics.\nIf CMCs are encoded in the semantic network that we use to think and communicate, it\nseems plausible that one could get these associations even though she or he cannot experience\nthem with the senses. This translates to a simple experimental question: Is red heavier than\nyellow also for early blind people who don't know what colors look like?\nNinety-two participants recruited in two different countries (70 Italians and 22 Belgians)\ncompleted a questionnaire in their native language (Italian and French, respectively): 46 early\nblind (EB) and 46 sighted controls (SC). Participants were pairwise matched between groups\nbecame totally blind before the age of 3 years and reported to have neither perception nor\nvisual memory of colors.\nThree questions with two alternative choices were orally presented to each participant.\nThey were asked whether a lemon is fast or slow, whether a boulder is sour or sweet, and\nwhich one is heavier between red and yellow (in counterbalanced order).1 Crucially, the\ncolor-related item was the only one that could unambiguously provide information about\nthe role of sensory experience, since color can only be perceived through sight. We therefore\nfocused on the outputs of this question.\nChi-squared statistics were used to test whether participants chose an option (e.g.,\nboulder-sour vs. boulder-sweet) above chance level, and whether this choice was different\nbetween groups. Results show that lemon was linked to the fast attribute in both groups,\n2 i-Perception\nsignificant difference across groups only for the color-related question (2(1) \u00bc 5.87,\nCan CMCs be acquired without the relevant sensory experience? The answer is yes, since\nEB showed the same color-weight association of their sighted counterpart, therefore\nsupporting the semantic hypothesis. However, we concomitantly find a significant\ndifference across groups, as predicted by the sensory hypothesis: The bias to think that red\nwas heavier than yellow was stronger in sighted than blind.2\nResults suggest that CMCs such as the color-weight association are influenced by both\nlinguistic and perceptual experience. We demonstrated indeed that such cross-modal\ncorrespondences are established even in the absence of the direct sensory experience (of\ncolors, in this case) probably from linguistic patterns that encode semantic relationships.\nHowever, first-hand perceptual experience may strengthen cross-modal intuitions, in\naddition to semantic aspects.\n"
