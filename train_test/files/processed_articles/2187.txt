The causes\nof obesity range from biological susceptibility to socio-\nenvironmental influence and the interaction among these\nfactors.2 Understanding both proximal and distal risk factors\nfor obesity are essential to developing targeted interventions.\nThere is evidence for increased comorbidity of non-\neating-related psychiatric disorders and obesity in children\nand adults.3 Psychiatric conditions, such as depression\nand post-traumatic stress disorder, have been associated\nwith obesity and related chronic diseases, such as hyperten-\nsion.4\u00ad6 In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest\na link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) and obesity.7 Studies of obese children and adults\nin clinical settings have documented a higher than expected\nprevalence of ADHD.8\u00ad11 Similarly, a marginally higher\nprevalence of obesity has been observed among patients\nwith ADHD;12\u00ad15 however, this finding is not consistent\nIn addition to these clinic-based studies, a small set of\npopulation-based studies have investigated the link between\nADHD and obesity. One study using data from the National\nCorrespondence: Dr BF Fuemmeler, Community and Family Medicine, Duke\nE-mail: bernard.fuemmeler@duke.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nSurvey of Children's Health, a telephone survey conducted\nwith parents, found that childhood ADHD was associated\nwith an increased odds (1.5) of obesity in these children.18\nAnother study using the Collaborative Psychiatric Epide-\nmiology data set, combining three population-based surveys\nfrom the United States, found that childhood ADHD\npersisting into adulthood was associated with an increased\nrespectively), even after controlling for depression.19\nIndividuals in the population who exhibit high levels of\nADHD symptoms, independent of their clinical diagnosis,\nare at higher risk for problematic health behaviors including\nsmoking.20,21 Studies to date have not examined specifically\nhow subthreshold ADHD symptoms contribute to risk for\nobesity. However, a small but growing body of literature has\ndemonstrated that certain characteristics commonly seen\namong individuals with ADHD (for example, lower levels of\nattention, impulse regulation, and inhibitory control) are\nmore prevalent among obese children and prospectively\npredict childhood obesity risk.22\u00ad28 These findings support\nthe notion that ADHD symptoms assessed on a dimensional\nscale, not necessarily a categorical diagnosis, are relevant to\nthe association with obesity.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine associations\nbetween ADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension in\nyoung adults in a large population-based cohort from the\nUnited States. This study extends previous research on ADHD\nclinical status and obesity by (1) examining the influence of\nsubclinical ADHD symptoms and by (2) investigating the\nspecific role of inattentive (IN) and hyperactive/impulsive\n(HI) symptoms alone and in combination. Given that\npsychosocial and psychiatric factors have also been impli-\ncated as risk factors for hypertension,29,30 we also examined\nthe association between ADHD symptoms and hypertension.\nMaterials and methods\nData source and study sample\nThe study population consisted of 20 745 adolescents from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), a nationally representative study of adolescents.\nThis longitudinal cohort includes 12 288 respondents who\ncompleted in-home surveys on four separate occasions (April\nage of the participants in the four waves of data collection\nBy design, the Add Health survey was stratified by region,\nurban versus rural residence, school type, ethnic mix and size\nto garner a nationally representative sample. The design and\ndata collection have been described in detail elsewhere.31,32\nThe study sample included participants from Wave IV who\nhad also completed one or more of the previous waves.\nWomen who were pregnant at Wave IV were excluded from\nthe analyses (n \u00bc 433), leaving a final analysis sample of\nMeasures\nAnthropometrics. Measured height and weight were\nascertained by Add Health study personnel at Waves II, III\nand IV using a digital scale and was self-reported at Wave I.\nBody mass index (BMI) (kg m\u00c02)33 was calculated and\ncategorized into three groups (normal BMI p25; overweight\ncircumference to the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border\nof the iliac crest was also measured by study personnel using\nan SECA 200 (Seca Corp., North America East; Hanover, MD,\nUSA) metric-increment circumference tape measure. This\nmeasure was not collected at earlier waves.\nBlood pressure and hypertension. Blood pressure (systolic\n(SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP)) was measured at\nWave IV by field interviewers using a Micorolife (MicroLife\nUSA, Inc.; Dunedin, FL, USA) blood pleasure monitor.\nParticipants were instructed to remain seated for at least\n5 min before the readings. Three separate readings at 30 s\nintervals were conducted with participants in a seated\nposition with both feet on the floor and legs uncrossed.\nThe average of the second and third readings were used as\nthe SBP and DBP values unless the second and third values\nwere missing, in which case the first reading was used. Stage\nII hypertension was defined in accordance with the 7th\nreport of the Joint National Committee on Prevention\nDetection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-\nADHD symptoms. At Wave III, participants were asked to\nretrospectively report ADHD symptoms experienced between\nthe ages of 5 and 12 years. Specifically, they were asked to\nreport the frequency of each symptom using a 4-point Likert\nscale: never or rarely, sometimes, often, very often. One item\n(`You were spiteful or vindictive') is not a Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) ADHD symptom and was\nexcluded from analyses; one DSM-IV HI symptom (`Often\ninterrupts or intrudes on others') was not included in the\nretrospective ADHD section. Thus, our analyses included\nresponses to nine IN and eight HI symptoms.\nA symptom was considered present if it was experienced\n`often' or `very often.' This approach to dichotomizing\nsymptoms has been used in other community-based studies\nof ADHD symptomatology, is considered clinical conven-\ntion35 and was also used in previous studies on the relation\nbetween ADHD and smoking outcomes.20,36 We examined\nthe dimensions of ADHD as the total number of symptoms\nreported in each domain (0\u00ad9 for IN; 0\u00ad8 for HI) or as two\ncategorical classifications. Two categorical classifications\nwere also utilized: (1) To examine the incremental effect of\nincreasing symptoms relative to having no symptoms, we\ncreated an ordinal variable with four categories (0 \u00bc no\nADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension\nBF Fuemmeler et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nmore symptoms); (2) to examine clinically relevant\ncategories based on the number of reported symptoms,\nsymptoms were classified into one of four clinically relevant\ncategories: (a) IN subtype: X6 IN symptoms, o6 HI\n91.5%). The six-symptom cutoff is consistent with DSM-IV\nADHD criteria requiring the presence of six or more\nsymptoms from either the IN or HI symptom domains, but\ndoes not represent a proxy for the diagnosis of ADHD.\nClinical diagnoses of ADHD were not available in this\npopulation-based sample.\nThe use of retrospective report is common in clinical\npractice when working with adults with ADHD, and previous\nstudies support the reliability and validity of these self-\nreports.37\u00ad41 We have previously demonstrated adequate\nreliability and validity of this approach by demonstrating\ngood internal consistency of the items (a\u00bc 0.86), and we also\nshowed that parents of adolescents reporting six or more\nsymptoms on either or both HI and IN scales were more likely\nto indicate learning or behavioral problems in their adolescent\nchildren at Wave 1. These adolescents were also more likely to\nreport taking medications for ADHD at Wave III.36\nOther variables. A number of potential covariates believed\nto be related to obesity or hypertension were included in\nstatistical models. These variables were constructed from\nWave IV data. Physical activity was assessed by a set of three\nquestions regarding leisure-based activities that approxi-\nmated moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (played a\nstrenuous team sport, played an individual sport or engaged\nin the following: roller blade, roller skate, downhill ski, snow\nboard, racquet sports or aerobics). Participants were asked\nto indicate the number of times they engaged in each\nactivity in the last 7 days (ranging from 0 to 7 or more times).\nFor analyses, scores were dichothomized (0 \u00bc no moderate-\nto-vigorous physical activity of the above type or\n1 \u00bc participation at least once in the past 7 days). Current\nor past depression was a derived variable based on partici-\npants' response to whether they had ever been diagnosed\nwith depression and were currently (within the past 7 days)\nfeeling depressed. Alcohol consumption was assessed by\nwhether participants reported consuming alcohol in the past\n30 days and, if they had drank alcohol, the number of drinks\nthey usually had each time. Responses were categorized as 0\n(no alcohol consumption in the past 30 days), 1 (alcohol\nconsumption in the past 30 days; 1\u00ad4 drinks per occasion)\nand 2 (alcohol consumption in the past 30 days; about 5 or\nmore drinks per occasion). An indicator of daily smoking\n(0 not daily and 1 daily) was also included. Sociodemo-\ngraphic variables included age, gender and educational\nattainment (high school or less, vocational or some college,\nor college or greater) at Wave IV.\nStatistical analysis. Associations between reported ADHD\nsymptoms and obesity and hypertension at Wave IV were\nassessed using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 10.0.1, SUDAAN\nStatistical Software, Research Triangle Institute International,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA) statistical software.42\nSUDAAN controls for survey design effects of individuals\nclustered within sampling unit (school), and stratification of\ngeographic region. In addition, post-stratification weights were\napplied to make the results generalizable to young adults in the\nUnited States. First, means for continuous covariates and\npercentages for categorical covariates were tabulated for each\nof the three BMI categories (normal, overweight and obese),\nand w2-tests and t-tests were used to evaluate statistical\ndifferences among these categories. Similar comparisons were\nmade between those with and without stage II hypertension.\nSecond, we compared the prevalences of overweight and obese\nand stage II hypertension among the ADHD symptom cate-\ngories. Similarly, we compared the mean waist circumference,\nBMI, DBP and SBP among the ADHD symptom categories.\nThe adjusted associations between ADHD symptoms and\nthe three categories of BMI were examined using multinomial\nlogistic regression models. Similarly, logistic regression\nmodels were used to assess the adjusted relationship between\nADHD symptoms and stage II hypertension. These models\nexamined the relative odds of overweight, obesity and\nhypertension in relation to ADHD symptoms with the three\ndifferent specifications (that is, clinically consistent cate-\ngories; the ordered category of 0, 1, 2 or 3 \u00fe HI/IN symptoms;\nor HI/IN on a continuous scale). To examine which symptom\ndomain had the stronger relationship with the outcome, a\nfinal model included both continuous HI and IN symptoms\nsimultaneously. To examine the contribution of ADHD\nsymptoms to hypertension, both directly and as mediated\nthrough the height-adjusted weight status, the results with\nand without control for BMI at Wave IV are presented.\nTo explore whether ADHD symptoms were related to\nnaturally occurring changes in BMI during the developmen-\ntal period from adolescence to adulthood, we developed a set\nof latent curve models (also known as random effects,\nrandom coefficients or mixed models outside of the\nstructural equation modeling framework). We initially tested\na series of unadjusted models comparing linear and quad-\nratic change functions with either user-set heteroscedastic or\nhomoscedastic residual errors to evaluate which model best\nfit the data, in terms of w2 and other modeling fit statistics\n(good model data fit is implied when root mean square error\nof approximation is 0.05 or less with a 90% confidence\ninterval (CI) around the root mean square error of approx-\nimation containing 0.05 and the Tucker Luis Index and the\nloadings for the linear model were fixed equal to 0, 1, 6\nand 12, representing the unequal time intervals (for the\nparameter estimate representing the intercept reflects BMI at\nmean age at Wave I, and parameter estimate representing the\nslope (change) reflects growth in BMI for 1-year intervals.\nADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension\nBF Fuemmeler et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nThe second stage involved entering the effect of the main\ntime invariant covariates (sex, age at Wave 1 and race) and\nADHD symptoms. This allowed for examining the effect of\nADHD symptoms on initial BMI status at Wave I (intercept),\nthe change in BMI over the four time points (slope) and the\nchange in BMI over the four time points (curve), while\ncontrolling for race, sex and age at Wave I. Latent growth\ncurve modeling was conducted using Mplus version 5.2,45\nwhich accounts for survey design effects and incorporates\nsampling weights. Missing values were treated with the\ninherent maximum likelihood estimation in the program.\nResults\nSample characteristics by BMI categories and hypertension\nstatus\nThe mean age at Wave IV was 28.9 years. Individuals in the\nobese BMI category were more likely to be older, female,\nblack or Hispanic, have a lower educational attainment, no\nphysical activity in the last week, have current or past\ndepression, consume either larger amounts of alcohol or\nabstain completely and not smoke daily (Table 1). Indivi-\nduals with stage II hypertension were more likely to be older\nblack males, have a higher BMI, have a lower educational\nattainment, no physical activity in the past week, have\ncurrent or past depression and consume either larger\namounts of alcohol or abstain completely.\nADHD symptoms by BMI categories and hypertension status\nThe percent obese was slightly higher among those in the\nADHD clinically relevant categories, but this was not\nstatistically significant (Table 2). Considering the symptom\ndomains separately, the proportion obese and the proportion\nwith hypertension were greater among those with 3 or more\nHI or IN symptoms (Table 2). A slight, gradual increase in the\nprevalence of obesity and stage II hypertension was present\nwith increasing HI and IN symptoms (Figures 1a and b).\nTable 1 Characteristics of the sample (percentages or means and s.e.)\nTotal (n \u00bc 11 666) BMI categories Hypertension (stage II)\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nPhysical activity\nPast or current depression\nAlcohol consumption\nCurrent daily smoker\naPo0.01 for t-tests from mean comparisons (normal vs overweight; normal vs obese; no hypertension vs hypertension). bPp0.01 for comparison from w2-test\n(categorical variables).\nADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension\nBF Fuemmeler et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nMean values for waist circumference, BMI, DBP and SBP\nby ADHD symptoms\nMean waist circumference was higher among those in the\nADHD clinically relevant categories compared with those\nwith subclinical ADHD symptoms (Table 2).

HI symptoms were also\nrelated to risk of hypertension during adulthood, but\naccounting for BMI during adulthood in the analyses\nattenuated this association, indicating that adult BMI is a\nstronger predictor of hypertension than are HI symptoms.\nThe present findings are consistent with previous reports\nlinking clinically diagnosed ADHD with higher prevalence of\nobesity.12\u00ad15 To our knowledge, only one other population-\nbased study has found that a diagnosis of ADHD persisting\ninto adulthood is associated with a higher risk for obesity.19\nHowever, the database used for that study included only a\nhistory of ADHD diagnosis, not specific ADHD symptoms,\nand only had categorical self-reported indicators of weight\nrather than measured height and weight and BMI measured\nin a continuous manner. Thus, this is the first population-\nbased study to examine the association between ADHD\nsymptoms, both the IN and HI dimensions, as predictors of\nadult BMI, changes in BMI over time and risk of adult obesity\nand hypertension.\nStudies in clinical or local samples are often the first\nreports of new associations. However, the degree to which\nthese findings generalize to the larger population remains\nunknown. Larger population-based studies of non-clinical\nsamples, such as this one, are important for extending these\ninitial reports, as well as for identifying the degree to which\nindividual differences, as reflected by IN and HI symptoms,\nmay have on the development of obesity and related health\noutcomes. Furthermore, examining the different domains of\nHI and IN dimensionally is important because this better\naccounts for the variability among people with these symp-\ntoms. Also, there may be partially dissociable genetic and\nphenotypic pathways that give rise to HI and IN symptom\ndomains.46 As such, identifying associations separately for\neach symptom domain can generate hypotheses about possible\npathways to non-homeostatic eating and risk for obesity.\nIn general, our findings highlight that HI and IN ADHD\nsymptom domains have differential effects on risk for obesity\nas they relate to naturally occurring changes in BMI from\nadolescence to adulthood. IN symptoms, which are related\nto deficits in ability to sustain attention and/or exert\npersistent effort, were related to higher BMI during adoles-\ncence, but did not have an impact on the changes in BMI\nover time; whereas HI symptoms, which are related to\ndeficits in behavioral inhibitory control, did not affect BMI\nduring adolescence but were associated with increasing BMI\nover time. Although further work is needed to more precisely\ncharacterize the nature of the relationship between ADHD\nsymptoms and obesity, our findings highlight that both\nsymptom domains affect risk for obesity, but have more or\nless impact during different developmental periods.\nThe behavioral mechanisms that underlie ADHD symp-\ntom\u00adobesity outcomes are yet to be fully elucidated.\nLaboratory studies have shown that habituation to food\ncues is disrupted during activities when attention allocation\nis required (for example, television viewing), resulting in\nincreased energy consumption47 with highly IN individuals\ntending to consume more energy during television\nviewing.48 As such, children with deficits in ability to sustain\nattention may be less likely to habituate to food cues and\nconsume more calories when engaged by distracting stimuli,\nsuch as watching television or playing video games. Later,\nduring adolescence, when parental regulation and control\nover food choices wanes, individuals with inability to\ninhibit behavioral responses may be disadvantaged when\nattempting to regulate their own food choices.\nThe link between ADHD symptoms and obesity is\nbiologically plausible. Several investigators have hypo-\nthesized that ADHD and non-homeostatic eating leading\nto obesity may share common underlying neurological\nsubstrates, especially those related to the production and\nreuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine.7,49 Genetic\nassociation studies have found that ADHD and obesity are\nboth associated with genes regulating dopamine avail-\nability.50 Furthermore, in two separate studies using Positron\nemission tomography with [11C]raclopride, Volkow et al.52\nhave shown that individuals with ADHD50 and those who\nare obese both show lower than normal dopamine (D2)\nreceptor availability. This lower dopamine receptor avail-\nability could reflect the common dispositions in both ADHD\nIn the present analysis, HI symptoms were associated with\nan increased risk of hypertension. However, this association\nwas reduced after adjusting for current BMI. Studies of\npsychosocial risk factors for hypertension have found that\ntrait impulsivity, hostility and time urgency/impatience are\nrelated to greater risk for hypertension.30,57 These traits may\nbe overrepresented among those with high levels of HI\nsymptoms.58 Further study is warranted investigating the\ndegree to which HI symptoms relate to cardiovascular\npathology, as well as the mechanisms that may underlie\nthese potential associations. At this point, we can only\nconclude that the ADHD\u00adhypertension association may be\nbest explained by differences in health behaviors, such\nas healthy dietary intake and physical activity, which may\nbe easier to sustain with decreasing ADHD symptoms.\nStrengths and limitations\nIn this large population-based sample, clinical assessments\nwere not undertaken. Thus, we are not able to determine\nthe association between a clinical diagnosis of ADHD and\nobesity and/or hypertension. Furthermore, the database only\nincludes ADHD symptoms as recalled from the past. The\napproach to quantifying ADHD symptoms by retrospective\nself-report has been shown to be reliable and valid;35,36\nhowever, prospective designs should be used to replicate our\nfindings. Our constructed measure of `clinically relevant'\nsymptoms should not be construed as clinical diagnostic\ncategories, but rather an approximation of ADHD subtypes.\nThe strength of the association that we found between `HI\nonly' and adult obesity (OR \u00bc 1.6) is similar to those reported\nby others who have examined the association between\nADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension\nBF Fuemmeler et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ndiagnostic classification of ADHD and adult obesity\n(OR \u00bc 1.8).19 Thus, it may be that the association reported\nbetween our `clinically relevant' categories and risk for\nobesity and hypertension is an underestimate of the\nrelationship between clinical ADHD and obesity and hyper-\ntension. Nevertheless, the purpose of this study was not only\nto examine the association between clinical levels of ADHD\nand obesity, but also to estimate the relationships between\ndimensional levels of symptoms and risk for obesity and\nhypertension for the reasons stated above. The findings\nhighlight that there may be variability unaccounted for by\nsole use of clinical categories that is important in the relation\nbetween ADHD symptoms and obesity, and this deserves\nfurther investigation. A strength of the study is that we were\nable to examine how ADHD symptoms related to naturally\noccurring changes in BMI over the course of adolescence into\nadulthood, something which has not heretofore been\ninvestigated. In future studies, however, it will be important\nto confirm these findings with prospectively collected data\non ADHD symptoms or ADHD phenotypes (for example,\nbehavioral inhibition), preferably combined with clinical\ndiagnosis of ADHD. The lack of data on multiple measures of\nblood pressure or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\nprevented us from determining the association that ADHD\nsymptoms had on changes in hypertension susceptibility\nover time. Finally, although we did include a number of\ncovariates that were related to risk for obesity and hyperten-\nsion, many of these were based on self-report. There is the\npossibility of potential residual confounding of both mea-\nsured and unmeasured variables.\nConclusions\nEvidence from smaller community-based samples and at\nleast one other population-based representative sample have\nfound an association between ADHD and adult obesity. Our\nfindings show a dose\u00adresponse increase in risk of obesity\nassociated with increasing ADHD symptoms, especially HI\nsymptoms. Indicators of hypertension also increased with\nincreasing HI symptoms; however, this relationship was\nattenuated when accounting for BMI. If our findings are\nconfirmed in other samples, they could have relevant\nclinical implications both for the treatment of ADHD and\nfor obesity. As has been suggested, it may be clinically\nrelevant to screen patients with ADHD who are at risk for\nobesity to develop appropriate treatment strategies.7,59,60\nMedications for ADHD often suppress appetite, and in\nchildren decelerated growth velocity has typically been a\nconcern. It may become necessary for clinicians to monitor\nweight more carefully among their child and adolescent\npatients with ADHD, especially when they come off\nmedications or in developmental transitions where weight\ngain is common. Treatment for obesity may also be affected\namong individuals with ADHD symptoms. Treatment\neffectiveness may be diminished and relapse may be greater\namong those with more ADHD symptoms.27 Given the\nmounting evidence, effort directed at developing and\ndefining strategies for assessing and treating obese patients\nwith co-occurring ADHD symptoms and for monitoring\nADHD patients for unhealthy weight gain appears\nwarranted.\nThere has been increasing interest in the response\nfindings reflecting significant associations between HI\nsymptoms and risk for obesity synchronize with this line of\nstudy. Examining the associations between ADHD symptoms\nor ADHD symptom-like phenotypes on obesity outcomes\ncould be a fruitful venue of research on both the etiology of\nobesity and as a means for improving tailored treatment and\nprevention strategies.\nConflict of interest\nDr Fuemmeler has received funding from the National\nInstitutes of Health/National Cancer Institute.
