In fact, many education experts\nare now calling kindergarten the 13th year of school for U.S.\nstudents. Many states offer both full-day and half-day kin-\ndergarten, with the trend leading toward the full-day sched-\nule. Only 8 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and\nthe Virgin Islands have a compulsory school age of 5 that\neffectively, if not explicitly, mandates kindergarten atten-\ndance for all children. Compulsory attendance ages in other\nstates range from age 6 to 8. Forty-two states, the District of\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands mandate that\nschool districts offer at least half-day of kindergarten pro-\ngrams; however, only fourteen of those states, the District of\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands mandate that\nage-eligible children attend at least a half-day of kinder-\ngarten. Of the 14 states, only 9 states mandate that school\ndistricts offer full-day kindergarten programs and only 2 of\nthose 9 states mandate that age-eligible children attend full-\nAs more states move toward a full-day kindergarten, the\nquestion of funding arises, \"Who will pay?\" Many states\noffer incentives to districts to offer full-day kindergarten\nwhile other states provide a disincentive. The majority of the\nstates, 21 including the District of Columbia, provide no\nclear incentive or disincentive for districts to offer full-day\nkindergarten (Kauerz & McMaken, 2003). However, in some\ninstances where districts offer traditional half-day kindergar-\nten, parents are willing to pay the difference to enable dis-\ntricts to provide a full-day program.\nFrom East to West, promises of full-day kindergarten,\naddition of extra classrooms, the search for highly qualified\nteachers, and extra work absorbed by school committees con-\ncerned about funding are on the rise, while stating that in\ndoing so, we will ensure the future academic success of our\nnext generation. In contrast, research does not support this\nfinding, but has identified a variety of factors that have con-\ntributed to this national trend. With the increasing pressure of\nschool accountability and rigorous content standards imposed\nby No Child Left Behind (NCLB), educators have responded.\nBackground of the Study\nWith a call for accountability, many states are documenting\nthe success or failure of their educational programs as they\ncompete for funding.

As a\ndirect result of NCLB, high-stake state assessments are now\nused to bring about curriculum and pedagogical change at an\nalarming pace. NCLB expects a high level of accountability\nfrom each state in specified areas. While K-12 education\nstruggles to respond and demonstrate improvement, many\nkindergarten programs are either not evaluated or are mea-\nsured with limited assessments and lack of consistency.\nMany states are implementing full-day kindergarten as a\n\"knee-jerk\" reaction to NCLB without support from norma-\ntive data and without changes in curriculum and teaching\nmethods. Some states have gone so far as to mandate kinder-\ngarten content standards in all academic areas, while kinder-\ngarten remains to be a noncompulsory grade.\nStatement of Problem\nSchool districts nationwide are attempting to meet the\ndemands of NCLB by implementing full-day kindergarten,\npresuming that it will provide increased academic success\nand a rise in test scores for students in future grades. The\nimplementation of full-day kindergarten is well received\nwith minor exception, yet it is not mandated, funded, nor\nstatistically proven to increase academic achievement for the\ngeneral population of students.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this research is to provide longitudinal\nempirical data, to support or refute the body of research\navailable for policy makers to either modify or continue\ntheir current kindergarten programs.\nImportance of Study/Significance\nof the Problem\nWith no sound evidence that full-day kindergarten provides\nacademic success for students in future grades, many districts\nwould save millions of dollars in kindergarten programs.\nAcademicachievementisfirstmeasuredstatewideinCalifornia\nat the second grade. It is, therefore, important for districts to\ndetermine the effectiveness in measured achievement as soon\nas practicable in an age of diminishing budgets.\nResearch Questions\nThe following research questions will guide this study:\nResearch Question 1: Will measurable achievement of\nsecond-grade students, who attended full-day kinder-\ngarten programs, display an increase in standardized\nscores when compared with their half-day peers?\nResearch Question 2: When considering the varied\npopulation of kindergarten students, which students\nwill realize greater academic achievement in later\ngrades?\nResearch Question 3: Will standardized test scores of\nsecond graders validate funding for full-day kinder-\ngarten programs?\nAssumptions\nOne assumption is that all students in this study were instructed\nproperly. It is assumed that the students have been performing\non or near grade level throughout first and second grade. In\naddition, it is assumed that students considered at risk have\nbeen identified, referred to student assistant teams for review,\nand screened for learning disabilities, physical disabilities,\nenvironmental damage, or developmental delays.\nHistorical Overview\nInvented by Friedrich Froebel in 1830, kindergarten was cre-\nated to teach young students about art, design, mathematics,\nand natural history. Throughout theAustro-Hungarian Empire,\nkindergarten had become an intricate part of compulsory edu-\ncation for students less than 6 years of age and by 1909,\nIn 1840, kindergarten was first introduced but not until\n1876 did it catch the eye of the American public (Watson,\nlaws were enacted, changed, and revoked before California\nestablished specific laws for kindergarten within its school\nsystem.\nIn 1890, an amendment was called to action by the Los\nAngeles School Board to establish and maintain kindergarten\nschools. In that same year, several charity kindergartens were\ntaken over by the board and five new kindergartens were\nadded to existing primary schools (de Cos, 2001). Previously,\nchildren as young as 2 or 3 had been permitted into the private\nkindergartens. With this no longer available, day nurseries,\nnow known as preschools, were formed. Two years later, in\n1893, a law was passed that kindergarten could be established\nas part of the primary education system and school boards\nwere to use school funds for that purpose (de Cos, 2001).\nNow part of primary education, kindergarten became a means\nfor children to receive necessary socialization and begin the\ntransition from living at home to attending primary school,\ngradually adjusting to the academic rigors. During this period\nof time, the philosophy of kindergarten continued to focus on\na child-centered approach, learning art, design, mathematics,\nand natural history rather than structured academic lessons\nFunding for the public kindergartens became an ongoing\nissue for school districts and the state. School boards could\nnot see enough evidence of the benefits of kindergarten to\nsupport the heavy costs of small teacher to pupil ratio, expen-\nsive materials, and half-day classes. In 1905, the California\nSupreme Court ruled that kindergartens were no longer to be\nMilligan 3\nconsidered as part of the common educational system.\nBecause of this rule, state funding was no longer available to\nsupport kindergarten programs. However, the court did state\nthat cities could support kindergarten programs as part of\ntheir primary schools with the condition that the funding\ncame from other sources than the state. For the next 40 years,\nfunding would be a constant battle in the legislation until\n1946 when an amendment to the state constitution provided\nstate aid. In addition, they also allowed attendance credit for\nthe kindergarten programs. Not until 21 years later, in 1967,\ndid the legislature mandate that districts incorporate kinder-\ngarten programs into their elementary schools making it\navailable to all eligible children (de Cos, 2001).\nKindergarten in the early 1900s was not valued by the\nmiddle classes as it emphasized the importance of a trained\ninstructor rather than the mother in training of a child,\nalthough this same group found it acceptable for immigrant\nchildren and the impoverished children of the slums. With\nkindergarten no longer operated privately but now funded by\nschool districts and freely available to all, advocates for kin-\ndergarten education suggested that these children would\ngreatly benefit. They believed that \"proper education\" would\nhelp to illuminate urban poverty. Furthermore, that by saving\nthese children from the \"irrevocable stamp of the slum\" by\ninstilling proper habits and virtue, these immigrant and\nimpoverished children would not propagate a generation of\nLiterature Review\nPreventing Early School Failure, a study conducted in the\nevidence that full-day kindergarten was academically bene-\nficial for all students (Karweit, Slavin, & Wasik, 1993). The\nresearch reported mixed results, yet consistent evidence\nregarding socioeconomic status (SES) and/or educationally\ndisadvantaged students exhibited positive academic and\nsocial benefits (Burriss, 2000). Literature provides many\nstudies throughout the 1990s furnishing evidence of the\neffectiveness of full-day kindergarten versus traditional half-\nday kindergarten discovering that the most benefit is gained\nby the SES, English language learner (ELL), and economi-\ncally disadvantaged students. Although a study conducted in\n1996 of 19 at-risk students displayed no significant differ-\nence in academic achievement, the conclusions state that\nfurther research with a larger sample was necessary and the\nresults could not be applied to the general population.\nResearch evidence implies that full-day kindergarten\noffers longer lasting academic benefits for children from\nlow-income families or others with fewer educational\nresources prior to kindergarten (Elicker, 2000). Researchers\nnoted that by adding full-day kindergarten, the achievement\ngap narrows between children from different racial and eth-\nnic backgrounds. With the additional standards added in\nCalifornia, kindergarten teachers have expressed a need to\nhave more time (Editorial, 2006). All-day kindergarten pro-\nvides the ability to effectively provide the type of instruction\nthat allows for differentiation and other pedagogical\napproaches which benefits low-achieving students (Ray &\nSmith, 2010). Studies that focus on early childhood educa-\ntion often claim that those who graduated preschool had\nfewer children born out of wedlock, were less likely to be on\nwelfare, and were more likely to be employed (Barnett &\npared 989 disadvantaged children, mostly African American,\nwho attended high-quality preschool with 550 similar chil-\ndren who attended full-day kindergarten (Ferrandino &\nTirozzi, 2001). The extraordinary findings revealed that the\npreschool children had 41% fewer grade retention and spe-\ncial education referrals, had 29% higher high school gradua-\ntion rate, and were 33% less likely to be arrested as juveniles.\nBoth of these studies indicate that the earlier a child's formal\neducation begins, the more likely they are to be academically\nsuccessful and productive citizens.\nMaryland, instituted a series of reforms within the primary\ngarten, Class Size Reduction (CSR), a revised curriculum,\nand increased communication between school officials and\nparents. Results indicated significant test-score gains. The\ndistrict's longitudinal study of its initiative, The Early\nSuccess Performance Plan, revealed that children who\nentered kindergarten with minimal abilities were able to\nmeet or exceed the 50th percentile in reading and language\nby the end of second grade (Jacobson, 2003). These same\npupils were also more likely to be successful if they remained\nin the same school more than 3 years. In contrast, those chil-\ndren who entered kindergarten with strong abilities were\nsuccessful in second grade, regardless of whether they\nreceived any kindergarten reforms or changed schools.\nA research study indicated that more time spent does not\nprovide academic achievement gains beyond the first grade\nfor all students (Elicker, 2000). Several studies have also\nconcluded that any academic edge achieved by full-day kin-\ndergarten students dissipates in later years. Academic bene-\nfits of full-day kindergarten simply subside soon after\nchildren leave kindergarten (Hare, Howard, & Prince, 2001;\nVotruba-Drzal, Li-Grining, & Maldonado-Carren~o, 2008).\nDavies and Cress (2010) identify that a passable explanation\nto this lack of difference in achievement success could be\nattributed to the practice in many school districts of provid-\ning full-day kindergarten programs only to students who are\nidentified as at risk of academic failure.\nA study of the effects on achievement and classroom\nbehavior in three different kindergarten schedules docu-\nmented comparative data within one school district applying\na common kindergarten curriculum to better understand the\ncharacteristics of an early childhood education program\n(Hildebrand, 2001). The study was conducted in central\nNebraska and kindergarten schedules were based on the\n4 SAGE Open\nsuperintendent's perception of children's needs. Teachers\nwere asked to rate their perceptions of children's social com-\npetence using a rating scale. A family reading inventory was\ndistributed to survey parents' participation in their children's\nliteracy development during the spring. No significant dif-\nferences for group means were found for reading raw scores\nand reading percentile scores. The study's findings suggest that\nthere are no clear differential effects of kindergarten schedules\non academic achievement and classroom social behaviors. In\norder for the results to generalize to other populations, school\ndistricts must consider SES, ethnicity, and other variables in\ntheir decisions regarding kindergarten schedule. Findings from\nthis study suggest that more time spent \"in school\" did not\nensure academic and social/emotional success for young chil-\ndren; that the quantity of time in a kindergarten day is no more\nimportant than the quality of time.\nDespite the vague and unclear results, some parents are\nwilling to pay for full day. Parents in Seattle, Washington,\nhave agreed to pay for their children to attend full-day kin-\ndergarten. Some elementary schools within the Seattle area\nhave been charging parents US$200 per month for 10 months\nto provide more full-day kindergarten slots than those\nfinanced with state and district money. The money covers the\ncost of hiring enough staff members to reduce class sizes to\napproximately 20 students. Seattle's weighted student fund-\ning formula finances full-day kindergarten for students liv-\ning in poverty and lower socioeconomic areas, yet the\nmiddle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods do not\nreceive added funding. Due to the existing population of\nmiddle-class students attending private schools, public\nschool administrators have offered parents the opportunity to\nredirect their monies to financing full-day kindergarten in\ntheir neighborhood schools. In Seattle, public schools are\nmarketing themselves for paying competition (Gewertz,\n2002). In documentation from the Education Commission of\nthe States (2004), most states are bound to funding formulas\nand supplement programs through categorical funding.\nThough many schools nationwide offer full-day kindergar-\nten, there are still many who are unable to offer it due to\nstaffing, facilities, and costs of operation (Magnuson, 2002).\nEven if parents are willing to pay for Seattle's extended full-\nday kindergarten program, it is obvious that kindergarten\nprograms will continue to expand throughout the country\nprovoking interest and controversy.\nSome districts like it because it eliminates the need to pro-\nvide buses and crossing guards at midday (Chmelynski,\n1998). Not only is there concern with providing crossing\nguards and bussing but also facilities to house the students,\nsalaries of teachers, supplies, and curriculum materials for\nnewly imposed kindergarten standards in response to the\nNCLB. Most districts, however, estimate that the expansion\nof traditional half-day kindergarten to full-day kindergarten\nwill cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nChanges in American society have also encouraged the\ngrowth of full-day kindergarten. Pressure of high-stakes test-\ning, double-income families, and single-parent homes have\ninfluenced educational system. One factor supporting the\nneed for full-day kindergarten is the academic rigor required\nas schools become more accountable for the performance of\ntheir students. Another factor is the number of poor and non-\nEnglish-speaking students. Some feel the benefits outweigh\nthe costs. While there is an impressive amount of research\nsupporting full-day kindergarten's benefit during the kinder-\ngarten year and transition to first grade in the social-\nemotional development of children, opponents argue that\nhaving a longer school day will not help children improve.\nWithout good teachers and a good curriculum, a full-day\nprogram could result in children spending more time in a bad\nenvironment. As more and more states propose and pass leg-\nislation establishing or expanding full-day kindergarten,\nprincipals need to analyze their schools' programs to ensure\nthat students are spending more time in a quality learning\nenvironment (Magnuson, 2002). \"Just attending a kindergar-\nten program three hours past lunchtime does not begin to\naddress the dynamics of teaching five-year-olds, nor does it\nadequately prepare them for first grade. Doubling the time does\nnot necessarily double the program quality\" (Weast, 2001, p. 9).\nIt is clear that in an age of diminishing funds, every program\nmust be evaluated as an academic enterprise.\nMethod\nIs a full-day kindergarten program an effective means to\nincrease student achievement in later grades? To answer this\nquestion, one must analyze and compare achievement of\nstudents over time. The purpose of this research is to inves-\ntigate an all-day kindergarten program to increase student's\nachievement. Another central question is the effect of an\nall-day kindergarten program on lower socioeconomically\nidentified students.\nThe study focuses on the following three hypothesis\nstatements:\nHypothesis 1: There is not a significant difference\nin language arts achievement as measured by the\nCalifornia Standards assessment between students\nattending an all day kindergarten program and those\nstudents who attended a traditional half-day kinder-\ngarten program.\nHypothesis 2: There is not a significant difference in\nmath achievement as measured by the California\nStandards assessment between students attending\nan all day kindergarten program and those students\nwho attended a traditional half-day kindergarten\nprogram.\nHypothesis 3: Attendance in an all-day kindergarten\nprogram is not a predictor of later achievement in\nsecond-grade students.\nIf there is a significant difference in achievement of sec-\nond-grade students who attended a full-day kindergarten\nprogram and those who did not, school districts will be able\nMilligan 5\nto meet the needs of more students. Furthermore, if attend-\ning an all-day kindergarten program is a predictor in young\nchildren and their future success, educators will be able to\nuse such a program for students who are at risk of failure and\ndo a better job of designing instruction and providing inter-\nventions to help them learn to succeed.\nAll-day kindergarten began at the district as a voluntary\nwhether there was sufficient desire and need for an all-day\nkindergarten program at Elementary School F. The survey\nrevealed that parents overwhelmingly felt that an all-day\nkindergarten program would be beneficial to their students.\nThe all-day kindergarten option was discussed with teachers\nand their approval was granted. The program was imple-\nmented as a voluntary option for teachers involved. All kin-\ndergarten teachers, along with one special education teacher,\nwantedtoparticipate.Parentshadtheoptionthroughtheopen-\nenrollment process of sending their students to a different\nschool within the district if they did not want to participate in\nthe all-day kindergarten program. One parent used the open-\nenrollment option at the beginning of the school year, and\none additional parent transferred his student at the middle of\nthe school year. The original kindergarten program at\nElementary School F consisted of two half-day morning ses-\nsions and one half-day afternoon session. This program was\nmodified into three all-day kindergarten classes. No addi-\ntional classrooms were needed to implement the program.\nThe two morning sessions already had assigned classrooms.\nThe afternoon session was combined with a full-inclusion\nspecial education class, and therefore no additional class-\nroom was needed.\nProgram Description\nThe full-day kindergarten program lasts between 6 hr and 20\nmin and 6 hr and 15 min depending on the school site. A full\napproximately 26% (494 min) of the time is spent on\nreading/language arts. Approximately 10% (190 min) of the\ntime is spent on math. A total of 7% of the time is spent on\nscience, social studies, and music/physical education (PE).\nIn all, 15% (285 min) of the time is spent on centers, library,\nvideos, and general classroom activities. Another 13% (247\nmin) of the time is spent on opening, attendance, pledge of\nallegiance, calendar, and cleanup. A total of 29% (551 min)\nis spent on recess, lunch, snack, and quiet time. All times\nwere established district program\u00adrecommended guidelines.\nThe partial-day kindergarten program lasts 3 hr and 15\nmin. A full week program consists of 975 min. Of that time,\napproximately 7% (68 min) is spent on opening, attendance,\npledge of allegiance, and calendar. A total of 38% (370 min)\nis spent on English/language arts. Another 13% (127 min) is\nspent on math. Another 13% (127 min) is spent on PE/social\nsciences. Approximately 6% (59 min) is spent on centers,\nlibrary, and computer lab and 8% (78 min) is spent on recess.\nAs with the all-day program, all times were district-\nrecommended guidelines.\nParents of students enrolled in schools in the district that\ndo not have an all-day kindergarten program may use the\nopen-enrollment option to enroll in Elementary School F's\nprogram, and parents are eager to enroll their students. The\nfull-inclusion classroom is very highly requested. Elementary\nSchool F staff indicate that students receive a much more\nenriching kindergarten experience because teachers can\naddress science, social studies, and fine arts in addition to\nmathematics and English/language arts at a less frantic pace.\nThis is especially beneficial in light of expanded require-\nments and content standards. Teachers find that they can fit\neverything in during the day, are able to address content stan-\ndards more completely, and can instill good work habits,\nprocedures, and study skills. All-day kindergarten allows\nteachers and students to end each day and each school year\nwith a feeling of completion.\nElementary School A began their all-day kindergarten\ntation, only one of three (one full day, one morning, one\nafternoon) kindergarten classrooms was an all-day program.\nfour of four kindergarten classrooms offered all-day pro-\ngrams. All-day kindergarten was offered on a voluntary basis\nby teacher request and did not impact classroom space at the\nschool. The program began because of a local Charter School\noffering a full-day program and Elementary SchoolAwanted\nto be competitive. Also, there were many parent inquiries,\nand parent requested for the all-day program. Only one par-\nent did not want to participate and was offered the option of\nopen enrollment at another school.\nElementary School C implemented the all-day kinder-\nwas implemented by teacher request and consisted of one\nall-day kindergarten, and one K-1 combination class. The\nteacher felt a need for the full-day program to be able to\ncover all of the California standards and requirements.\nElementarySchoolChadadequatespaceandofferedtheopen-\nenrollment option for parents not wanting to participate. No\nparent opted out of the program.\nWhile achievement testing is limited in kindergarten and\nfirst grade with teacher anecdotal assessment, statewide\nstandardizing testing was available in the second grade. The\ndecision was made to use an assessment that has strict stan-\ndards for validity and reliability, which allows for a less sub-\njective program evaluation. The California Standardized\nTesting and Reporting (STAR) Assessment Program was\nselected as the vehicle for that assessment.\nFor the past several years, the California public schools\nhave been administering the STAR Testing program. The\npurpose of the STAR program is to help measure how well\nstudents are learning the California academic standards.\nBeginning in 2003, California public schools are also under\nthe federal accountability system outlined in NCLB. Both\n6 SAGE Open\nthe Academic Performance Index (API) and Annual Yearly\nProgress (AYP) are reported each year. Teachers, parents,\nand administrators use these test results to monitor each stu-\ndent's progress. The results are used in combination with\nother indicators of student achievement to help make deci-\nsions about ways to improve student learning and school\nprograms.\nThe Public Schools Accountability Act (PSAA) was\nsigned into law in California in April of 1999. This law\nauthorized the establishment of the first statewide account-\nability system for California public schools. One major com-\nponent of this accountability system is the API, which is the\ncornerstone of the PSAA. Both the California Standards Test\n(CST) and the California Achievement Test 6th Edition\n(CAT 6) test results are used to calculate each school's API.\nThe NCLB act of 2001, which reauthorized the federal\nElementary and Secondary Act (ESEA), requires all districts\nand schools to demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress, with\nan eventual goal that 100% of all students will be proficient\nor above in reading/language arts and mathematics by\nThe all-day kindergarten study included two custom\ngroups of students. One group consisted of full-day kinder-\ngarten students and the second group included the traditional\nschool year. STAR CST scores in English, reading and writ-\ning; and in math, number sense, algebra, measurement and\ngeometry, statistics, data analysis, and probability; and (CAT 6)\nscores in reading, language arts, and math were gathered for\neach student and for each group of students as a result of the\nspring 2005 test administration. Data were disaggregated\ninto categories including free and reduced meals, ELL, gen-\nder, and ethnicity. The data from each category were ana-\nlyzed through Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS)\nsoftware to determine results of any significance.\nA total of 208 students from a K-12 school district in\nsouthern California participated in the study. This longitudi-\nnal study was conducted over 3 years. In all, 43 all-day kin-\ndergarten students and 165 randomly selected traditional\nkindergarten program students all who maintained continu-\nous enrollment from kindergarten through second grade\nwere administered the California Standards assessment in\nGrade 2. Two years later, when the students were in the sec-\nond grade, language arts and math scores were obtained as\nmeasured by the California State\u00admandated State Standards\nAssessment as part of the California STAR Assessment. The\nindependent-samples t-test was used to evaluate the differ-\nence in achievement in a variety of subjects. Reading, writ-\ning, algebra functions, number sense, measurement, and\nstatistics and probability as well as normal curve equivalence\n(NCE) scores of the CAT 6 math and reading assessments\nwere used in the means comparisons test. Also included as a\nvariable is the achievement classification which uses a\n5-point scale (5 being highest) in English language arts and\nmath to determine if a student is functioning below, at, or\nabove grade level. In addition, using stepwise multiple\nregression, several independent variables were introduced\ninto the regression equation to obtain a Prediction Model of\nAll Day Kindergarten Achievement. The assessment scores\nof the entire battery of test were used as the dependent vari-\nable in separate regression runs. The independent variables\nused were (a) SES (as determined by free/reduced lunch sta-\ntus), (b) ELL status, (c) all-day kindergarten status, and (d)\ngender status.\nSetting and Sample\nThe participating school district resides in an urban area with\na medium-size population. The city's school district serves\nThe district's demographic data are displayed in Table 1.\nContaining six elementary schools, the study district spans\nthree city geographical areas. In addition, the district main-\ntains a state-approved preschool that serves approximately\n100 students. None of the participating students in the study\nparticipated in the preschool program.\nAll kindergarten students who attended the all-day pro-\ngram and were still maintaining attendance, within the district,\nparticipated in the study. The 165 students who participated in\nonly the traditional program were randomly selected from the\nremaining total district population but had also attended the\ndistrict school continually since kindergarten.\nData Collection Procedures\nAll students were administered the battery of tests required\nfor California state students in Grade 2 in the spring of 2006.\nCST\nThe CST is the cornerstone of the California STAR Program.\nGiven in English, the CST is designed to assess how well\nstudents are doing with respect to the California academic\nstandards in English-language arts, mathematics, history-\nsocial science, and science. These academic standards\ndescribe what students should know and be able to do at\neach grade level. The individual STAR Student Report pro-\nvides overall scaled scores and performance levels for each\nCST. Overall scaled scores are reported on a scale ranging\ncient, basic, below basic, or far below basic. The state target\nis for all students to attain the proficient or advanced level\non the CSTs. The range of scores that belong to each perfor-\nmance standard varies by grade, content area, and year.\nHowever, regardless of grade and content area, the range for\nCalifornia assigns performance standards for content areas\nbut not for standards and substandards.\nMilligan 7\nThe CAT 6 assesses the achievement of basic academic\nskills in key subjects that are commonly taught in public\nschools throughout the United States. The CAT 6 compares\nthe performance of California students to the performance of\nstudents throughout the nation who take this assessment.\nStudents in Grades 2 to 11 are tested in reading, language,\nand mathematics. Students in Grades 2 to 8 are also tested in\nspelling, and students in Grades 9 to 11 are tested in science.\nThe CAT 6 reports student scores for each subject area as\nraw scores, scaled scores, and percentile ranks. The 50th\npercentile rank is the national average, and a score between\nthe 40th and 60th percentiles is considered an average score.\nData Analysis Procedures\nThe study's assessments yield data with either interval or\nLikert-type scaling. Given this type of data, the hypothesis\nwas assessed using parametric statistical procedures. There\nwere two procedures used: (A) the independent-samples t-test\nprocedure comparing means for the two groups and (B) step-\nwise multiple regression. Measures of central tendency were\nalso calculated. The significance level selected for this study\nis the conventional .05 level. This means that the results will\nnot be termed significant unless only 1 out of 20 times the\nrelationship could be obtained based on chance alone.\nDuring the spring of 2005, students were administered the\nstandardized tests of California Standards Assessment and\nthe CAT 6. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions\nwere calculated using the statistical software package SPSS\n11. All National Percentile Rankings (NPR) were converted\nto Normal Curve Equivalents (NCE) to perform all calcula-\ntion, and then converted back to NPR. Using the method of\nmean substitution eliminated problems that might have\noccurred because of missing data. In addition, to avoid prob-\nlems of multicollinearity, a tolerance level of .30 was uti-\nlized. Normal probability plots were used to examine the\nassumption of normality and the Levene test was used for\nequality of variances. All variables tested were found to be\nnormal in their distributions.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results and discussions in this section are to assist in the\ndevelopment of programs to improve achievement in ele-\nmentary school students by analyzing various independent\nvariables a typical student may encounter in his or her future\nacademic experience.\nThe results are presented in four parts. First, descriptive\nstatistics of the entire sample and subsamples are discussed.\nFrequency distributions (Table 2) as well as measures of cen-\ntral tendency for all-day kindergarten students and tradi-\ntional kindergarten are presented. Sample cross-tabulation\nare displayed (Tables 3, 4, and 5) to develop an understand-\ning of the unique characteristics of each group (all day vs.\ntraditional). Because the significance value for the Levene\ntest was high (greater than 0.05), only the results that assume\nequal variances for both groups is displayed. Second, prior to\nperforming hypotheses testing, each group must be separated\ninto gender, ELL status, and free/reduced lunch status. Third,\nthe independent-samples t test was used to evaluate the dif-\nference in achievement in the selected subject areas (Table 6)\nfor all subjects and for each subgroup. Fourth, stepwise mul-\ntiple regression runs were made using the dependent variable\n(Math Standards Level and English language arts [ELA]\nStandards Level) and the independent variables of gender,\nELL status, free/reduced status, and all-day kindergarten\nDescriptive Statistics\nSlightly less than 50% of the students in the sample were\nstudents were participating in the free and reduced lunch pro-\nTable 1.

The result of this information\nis reported in Table 10.\nLanguage proficiency was also not the subject of this\nstudy but was used to create subgroups to avoid inaccurate\nanalysis that may occur because of language proficiency.\nTable 4 displays the Language proficiency frequencies for\nthe participants.\nIndependent-Sample t-Test Analysis\nUsing all available assessment, there were no significant dif-\nferences in the scores of students who attended an all-day\nkindergarten and those who did not (Table 6). These results\nremained the same for males and females as well as for each\nsubgroup of students (ELL and free and reduced lunch).\nOnly the Standards Measure score for non-ELL students\napproached significance (.058). Scores for all-day kinder-\ngarten students were slightly higher but none proved to test\nsignificant.\nRegression Analysis\nWhile a significant model was developed, attendance in an all-\nday kindergarten program was not among the predictors. Free\nand reduced lunch status proved to be the most useful tool when\npredicting student reading success (R2 of .052). Table 7 displays\nR, R2, adjusted R2, and the standard error. R, the multiple cor-\nrelation coefficient, is the correlation between the observed and\npredicted values of the dependent variable. The values of R for\nprediction models produced by the regression procedures range\nfrom 0 to 1. Larger values of R indicate stronger relationships.\nR2 is the proportion of variation in the dependent variable\nexplained by the regression model. The values of R2 range from\n0 to 1. Small values indicate that the model does not fit the data\nwell. The sample R2 tends to optimistically estimate how well\nthe model fits the population.Adjusted R2 attempts to correct R2\nto more closely reflect the goodness of fit of the model in the\npopulation.\nTable 8 displays the results of an ANOVA test. A model\nwith a large regression sum of squares in comparison with\nTable 2.

Very high\nresidual sum of squares indicate that the model fails to\nexplain a lot of the variation in the dependent variable, and\nyou may want to look for additional factors that help account\nfor a higher proportion of the variation in the dependent vari-\nable. Clearly, the data revealed a much higher residual result\n(196.324) and a low regression sum indicating that the inde-\npendent variables used fail to explain the variations in the\ndependent variable.\nTable 9 further explores the data set by analysis of the\nregression coefficients. Often the independent variables are\nmeasures in different units. The standardized coefficients or\nbetas are an attempt to make the regression coefficients more\ncomparable. The t statistics can help you determine the rela-\ntive importance of each variable in the model. Even though\nthe model produced a significant predictor (free and reduced\nlunch status R2 = .052) it is not considered useful. This result\nremained constant for all subgroups using ELA and math\nachievement levels as dependent variables.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nHypothesis 1 is accepted; there is not a significant difference\nin language arts achievement as measured by the California\nStandards assessment between students attending an full-\nday kindergarten program and those students who attended a\ntraditional half-day kindergarten program. Hypothesis 2\nis accepted; there is not a significant difference in math\nachievement as measured by the California Standards\nassessment between students attending a full-day kindergar-\nten program and those students who attended a traditional\nhalf-day kindergarten program. Hypothesis 3 is accepted,\nattendance in a full-day kindergarten program is not a pre-\ndictor of achievement in second-grade students.\nTable 9.

These findings also replicate a recent\nmeta-analysis of full-day kindergarten programs, which\ndetermined that most benefits fade after the third grade\nBoth studies, however, agree that school districts need to\nconsider SES, ethnicity, level of parent education, and other\nvariables in their decisions regarding full-day kindergarten.\nIn support of the current findings, a comprehensive literature\nreview of full-day versus traditional half-day kindergarten\nprograms found similar results in that the benefits of full-day\nprograms were not apparent in later years (Lash, Bae, Barrat,\nBurr, & Fong, 2008). Participation in full-day kindergarten\nor traditional half-day kindergarten does not appear to be a\npredictor of a students' overall math and reading scores in\nlater grades.\nOften parents are surveyed for their opinion or desire for\nfull-day kindergarten, which usually results in an over-\nwhelming favor of full-day kindergarten. Many principals\nfeel the pressure to incorporate such programs when the pub-\nlic displays such desire, when the parent's decision is not\neducationally sound but rather based on the need for after-\nnoon day care. Likewise in the current research study, the\ndistrict surveyed parents to determine if there was sufficient\nevidence to support a full-day kindergarten program. There\nwas not one survey that did not support a full-day kindergar-\nten program. Fortunately, there was no additional cost to the\ndistrict as is felt by many school districts across the nation.\nFrom the review of literature, research comparing full-\nday kindergarten versus traditional half-day kindergarten\nprograms generally finds positive effects of full-day pro-\ngrams on end-of-year measures of reading readiness, lan-\nguage, and other objectives. However, few studies that have\nexamined the benefits of full-day kindergarten effects in\nlater years found evidence of benefits even as early as at the\nend of first grade (Karweit, Slavin, & Wasik, 1993).\nDespite the increase in the popularity of kindergarten,\nvery little research specifically examines the academic ben-\nefits of full-day kindergarten versus traditional half-day kin-\ndergarten in later grades. The vast majority of studies focus\ntheir research on the benefits of full-day kindergarten and the\nacademic achievement gained at the end of kindergarten or\nfirst-grade students. There is a lack of literature that reports\non the findings concerning the long-term effects of full-day\nkindergarten versus traditional half-day kindergarten in stu-\ndent math and reading scores in later grades. Regardless,\nfull-day kindergarten is sweeping the nation, costing mil-\nlions of dollars to school districts that have based their deci-\nsions on greater school achievement, pressure from day care\nfamily needs, and inconclusive research. Before policy mak-\ners mandate full-day kindergarten programs, they should\nseek longitudinal studies to substantiate their million dollar\ndecisions.\nYoung children's learning is intimately connected to and\nwill depend on their cultures, languages, and communities.\nNonacademic strengths such as emotional competence or\npositive approaches to learning when children enter kinder-\ngarten are strong predictors of academic skills in later grades.\nMany of the benefits associated with full-day kindergarten\nremain anecdotal; isolating the effects of extra class time\nfrom factors such as class size, teaching methodology,\nteacher experience, and parent involvement proves to be\ndifficult.\nAs do most studies, additional questions for future\nresearch always arise. Would other all-day kinder programs\ngenerate the same effect? Would students of different demo-\ngraphics produce a more significant difference in achieve-\nment? Is using standardized testing the best way to determine\na program's success? This study may be one of many to pro-\nvide information that leads researchers in new directions as\nthe struggle to learn the most effective ways to increase\nachievement in children continues. In closing, to identify\nprograms that produce lasting effects, longitudinal research\nmust become an integral part and priority of the educational\nsystem.
