    "abstract": "Abstract\nKnowledge gap research focuses on education as an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES). Belief gap research centers\non ideology as potentially more powerful than education in comparing sociopolitical groups with scientifically established\nknowledge and groups with opposing beliefs accepted on faith. This study examined the relationship between education\nand ideology to understand belief gaps better. The study used 2008 American National Election Study (ANES) data to\ncompare conservatives, moderates, and liberals by education on religiosity, child rearing values, opinionation, need for\ncognition, orientation toward politics, and mass media access and use. Although liberals tended to be more educated than\nconservatives overall, better-educated conservatives had the highest household incomes and were a much larger group. No\nknown knowledge gap studies have reported results on one group characterized by high education and an opposing group\ndistinguished by a different indicator of SES. Reformulations of the belief gap hypothesis are offered.\n",

Increasing ideological polarization and scientific\npoliticization affect political elites and ordinary citizens\nIssues of particular concern include global warming and\nDunlap, 2011), stem cell research (Ho, Brossard, &\nScheufele, 2008), sexuality, sexual abstinence, AIDS\nMooney, 2005). In fact, public trust in science itself has\nwaned among conservatives but not liberals or moderates in\nthe past four decades (Gauchat, 2012). Ideological divisions\nalso exist for other issues, such as the existence in Iraq of\nweapons of mass destruction, numbers of casualties in the\nIraq war, Social Security, economic inequality, welfare\nissues, and national economic conditions (Abramowitz &\nSome observers have thought that improving public\nunderstanding of science would increase public acceptance\nof scientific findings; however, this is not the case (e.g.,\ngreater distrust of science in educated conservatives than in\nless-educated conservatives and concluded,\nTaken together, these results highlight a perplexing issue: cross-\nnationally, more highly educated societies trust science more;\nyet, within advanced societies the expansion of public education\nover time has not brought about greater public trust.

Hindman (2009) theorized, however, that ideol-\nogy would be a better predictor than education of beliefs\nabout scientific evidence for global warming over time under\nthe conditions of increasing controversy, media coverage,\nand activities of elites and interest groups on this issue. An\nimportant contributory factor is an increasingly acrimonious\npolitical environment. He emphasized that his review of the\nknowledge gap hypothesis came\n. . .within a broader social climate of rising political partisanship:\na time in which issues with public policy implications are\nincreasingly subject to political dispute and partisan polarization.\nOf particular interest are heavily publicized issues in which the\nscientific community plays a key role in defining the problem\nA growing gap over time between liberals and conserva-\ntives was supported for beliefs about scientific evidence that\nglobal warming is occurring, but it was not statistically sig-\nnificant for beliefs that human activity causes global warm-\ning (Hindman, 2009).4 Education and ideology, however,\nwere related to beliefs in global warming as a consequence\nof human activity. Liberals and the more educated were more\nlikely to perceive the actions of humans as causes of the\nproblem, compared with conservatives and the less educated.\nHindman (2009) expressed concern that conservatives\nbrushed aside scientifically supported data because of their\nreligious beliefs. He defined knowledge as empirically sup-\nported facts and beliefs as convictions accepted as true with-\nout proof.\nOther reports have relevant information. For example,\neducation played a role in belief that global warming is tak-\ning place, but it was not related to beliefs about the human\ncause of the problem (McCright & Dunlap, 2011). McCright\nand Dunlap did not differentiate knowledge from belief.\nTheir focus was beliefs about global warming that are con-\nsistent with the scientific consensus and beliefs that are not.\nThey noted several studies reporting negative correlations\nbetween education and concern about global warming and\none study that found a positive relationship between educa-\ntion and concern. They stated, in particular, \". . . the effects\nof educational attainment and self-reported understanding on\nbeliefs about climate science and personal concern about\nglobal warming are positive for liberals and Democrats, but\nare weaker or negative for conservatives and Republicans\"\nControlling for other major variables did not change the find-\nings. Liberals tended to champion the view that scientific\nconsensus shows global warming to be a real issue, stem-\nming from human activity, and a threat to society.\nConservatives tended to challenge the scientific consensus\nand defend the industrial capitalist system.\nThe proportions of the American public who believed that\nglobal warming was a real phenomenon grew between 2001\n2011). The proportion of people who believed that human\nactivities were responsible for global warming decreased\nsomewhat. The Pew Research Center for the People & the\nPress (2011) reported similar findings. The proportions who\nwere very concerned about the implications of global warm-\ning tended to increase, with some fluctuations. Overall,\nMcCright and Dunlap (2011) found evidence of ideological\nand political partisan polarization.\nThe results of Hindman (2009) and McCright and Dunlap\n(2011) indicate that a more detailed look at the relation\nbetween education and ideology may increase our under-\nstanding of any potential tension between them. The first\nhypothesis, therefore, is,\nHypothesis 1: Higher education will be positively related\nto greater liberalism, and conversely, lower education will\nbe related to greater conservatism.\nResearch Question 1 (RQ1): Are there other demo-\ngraphic differences that distinguish conservatives from\nliberals?\nReligious Value Predispositions\nReligiosity is frequently identified as a value predisposition\nthat can be antithetical to science (Brossard, Scheufele, Kim,\nReligiosity influences people, in part, through childhood\nsocialization, interpersonal networks, and information sources.\nHo et al. (2008) examined the public's attitudes toward\nanother controversial scientific issue, stem cell research.\nThey concluded that the public makes sense of this issue by\nusing value predispositions and heuristic cues received from\nnews media. The public's beliefs about stem cell research\nwere conditioned by three value predispositions in particu-\nlar: religiosity, ideology, and deference to scientific author-\nity. Education was positively related to support for human\nembryonic stem cell research, although the relationship\nattenuated after other variables were controlled. While this\nstudy was not highly similar to Hindman's (2009), the ten-\ndency of many in the public to rely on non-scientific means\nto shape their views is of interest.\nReligious beliefs played an indirect role in public support\nfor funding nanotechnology, in addition to influences such as\nscience media and knowledge (Brossard et al., 2009).\nReligious value predispositions tempered factual knowledge\nabout nanotechnology.\nLadwig (2010) compared ideology and religiosity as\nvalue predispositions that predict (a) controversial science\nknowledge (about human evolution and the big bang theory\nof the origin of the universe) and (b) non-controversial\nscience (the very hot center of the earth, radioactivity,5 lasers,\nelectrons, antibiotics,6 and continental drift), measured at\none point in time.Although he did not directly test Hindman's\nhypotheses, his results suggest support. Liberals with high\nnon-controversial knowledge scores also scored highly on\ncontroversial knowledge. This occurred for conservatives,\ntoo, but to a lesser degree. Liberals also scored higher than\nconservatives on self-perceived knowledge of scientific\nstudy. The value predispositions of religiosity and ideology\nwere significant and explained almost 12% of the variance in\nthe model. (Greater scores on a socioeconomic index that\naccounted for education, income, and occupation were sig-\nnificantly related to non-controversial science knowledge,\neven when all other major variables were accounted for.)\nThe next hypothesis proposed, therefore, is,\nHypothesis 2: Religiosity will be positively related to\nconservatism.\nChild Rearing Value Predispositions\nPeople may be predisposed to understand ideology and appro-\npriate government\u00adcitizen relations in terms of the earliest\nexamples to which they are exposed--the parent\u00adchild rela-\nthe social construction of ideology based on perceptions of\nparent\u00adchild relations as either nurturance (related to liberal-\nism) or discipline (related to conservatism). Those who lean\ntoward the nurturant model are more likely to stress egalitarian\nand compassionate values; those inclined toward the discipli-\nnarian model tend to emphasize political individualism and\nLakoff's (2002) nurturant model emphasizes parent\u00adchild\ndiscussion with explanations for rules and with give and\ntake, even to the extent of allowing conflict and disagree-\nment. Parental supervision of children relies on persuasion\nrather than punishment. The goals are empathy, social\nresponsibility, and cooperation (Barker & Tinnick, 2006).\nLakoff's \"strict father,\" or disciplinarian, model seeks to pro-\ntect children from a dangerous and difficult world by empha-\nsizingstrictadherencetoauthority,punishmentforinfractions\nof rules, and competition with the goals of personal respon-\nsibility, self-discipline, and strong morals. Of course, many\nfamilies fall in between these polar opposites. (For earlier\nBarker and Tinnick (2006; also see Feldman & Stenner,\nStudy (ANES) to test Lakoff's theory, using an index of\nitems concerning the qualities that children should have.\nChild rearing values scores related to the two models of nur-\nturance and discipline strongly predicted attitudes toward a\nvariety of issues, including conservatism or liberalism, as\nhypothesized.\nSocial structure influences people's child rearing behav-\niors through the mechanisms of occupation and parents'child\n(Kohn, Slomczynski, & Schoenbach, 1986; Weininger &\nLareau, 2009) showed that middle-class parents tend to stress\nself-direction as a value and that working class parents tend to\nemphasize conformity to external standards and to exhibit\nmore authoritarianism. \"Middle class\" in the United States is\n\"the socioeconomic class between the working class and the\nupper class, usually including professionals, highly skilled\nlaborers, and lower and middle management.\"7 The \"working\nclass\" in the United States is \"the socioeconomic class con-\nsisting of people who work for wages, especially low wages,\nincluding unskilled and semiskilled laborers and their\nfamilies.\"8\nMiddle-class occupations tend to be concerned with the\nmanipulation of interpersonal relations, ideas, and symbols;\nworking-class occupations tend to be oriented toward things.\nMiddle-class occupations often entail more self-direction,\nless close supervision, and less conformity to rules and\nauthority than working-class occupations do. Level of educa-\ntion underlies these differences as a key variable in entry into\noccupations, having direct and indirect impact on people.9\nHypothesis 3a: Conservative ideology will be positively\nrelated to more disciplinarian, or authoritarian, child rear-\ning values, and liberal ideology will be negatively related\nto authoritarian child rearing values.\nHypothesis 3b: Education will be negatively related to\nmore authoritarian child rearing values.\n4 SAGE Open\nOpinionation\nAnother moderating influence may be having strong opin-\nions. Having stronger opinions about political issues is asso-\nciated with being more knowledgeable about politics and\npublic affairs, greater participation, and greater news media\nconservatives and liberals are more attuned to political issues\nand feel more passionately about them; thus, the next hypoth-\nesis is,\nHypothesis 4: Conservatives and liberals will be equally\nopinionated.\nResearch Question 2 (RQ2): Will education moderate\nthe relationship of ideology and opinionation?\nNeed for Cognition\nOne moderating variable may be differences in the way peo-\nple think, not only cognitive skills but also other cognitive\nstyles, which can vary by education and ideology. Higher\neducation and advantages provided by higher SES allow\ngreater development of cognitive skills (Eveland &\nas well as perceptions of a greater need for cognition (Liu &\nNeed for cognition is a person's tendency to engage in and\nenjoy thinking, including whether one prefers complex prob-\nlem solving or simplicity of tasks (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982).\nCacioppo and Petty (1982) investigated a potential relation-\nship between dogmatism and need for cognition because\nRokeach (1960) had found that highly dogmatic persons val-\nued social recognition, salvation, and obedience, whereas\nthose lower in dogmatism placed greater value on equality,\nfreedom, and being broad-minded. Dogmatism (rigid asser-\ntion of opinions, ideas, whether empirically supported or\nnot) is a construct related to authoritarianism (obedience to\nauthority, maintaining control of a parent/governing body\nover others). Because greater open-mindedness overlaps\nsomewhat with need for cognition, they expected to find\ndogmatism and need for cognition weakly and negatively\ncorrelated, which they did. In addition, higher American\nCollege Test scores in their college student sample were\nrelated to lower dogmatism.\nFurthermore, research on the brain has uncovered differ-\nences between conservatives and liberals (Amodio, Jost,\nMaster, & Yee, 2007). Results were considered to be consis-\ntent with previous research showing liberals to be more\nadaptable to information complexity, ambiguity, and novelty,\nwhile conservatives were more responsive to more struc-\ntured, orderly, and predictable situations. A meta-analysis of\ndata from 12 countries showed how three categories of\nsocial-cognitive motives act on political conservatism (Jost,\nGlaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003). The following\nhypotheses are offered:\nHypothesis 5a: Conservatives and liberals will differ in\ntheir needs for cognition.\nHypothesis 5b: Education will be positively related to\ngreater need for cognition.\nOrientation Toward Politics\nIf liberals and conservatives are expected to be more opin-\nionated than moderates, this could include higher levels of\ninterpersonal discussion about political issues, greater politi-\ncal interest, and more political activities. Others have shown\nthe importance of these behaviors and their interrelatedness\nin the political process (e.g., Eveland & Scheufele, 2000;\ntions on these points are as follows:\nResearch Question 3a (RQ3a): Will conservatives and lib-\nerals discuss the presidential election equally frequently?\nResearch Question 3b (RQ3b): Will education make a\ndifference in their discussion behavior?\nResearch Question 4a (RQ4a): Will liberals and conser-\nvatives be equally interested in the campaign?\nResearch Question 4b (RQ4b): Will education play a\nrole in political interest?\nResearch Question 5a (RQ5a): Will conservatives and\nliberals be equally politically active?\nResearch Question 5b (RQ5b): Will education make a\ndifference in their political activities?\nMass Media Access and Use\nAccess to information circulating in the environment is an\nimportant variable in belief (Hindman, 2009) and knowledge\npresent study does not focus on knowledge gaps per se, a rea-\nsonable assumption is that liberals and conservatives who are\nopinionated and cognitively sophisticated are likely to have\naccess to the largest information environments and to attend\nto media content more closely.\nThe more educated may have larger print environments\nand the less educated may have larger broadcast media envi-\nronments because increased print media coverage of political\nissues tends to strengthen the relation between education and\nknowledge but increased television coverage does not tend\nto improve the relationship. It may be that print is more cog-\nnitively demanding and broadcast is more accessible to the\nless educated but also more superficial in coverage (Gandy\nThe dataset used in the present study does not include\nmeasures of use of specific news channels such as CNN,\nNBC, CBS, or Fox, or online blogs. Other research, how-\never, has shown that conservatives and Republicans are\nlikely to perceive content on conservative talk shows and\ntelevision channels as more truthful and sources and con-\ntent favoring Democrats and liberals as untruthful (Jamieson\n& Cappella, 2009). Conservatives have tended to view\nmainstream news media with distrust and to prefer outlets\nthat share their views; however, their knowledge and beliefs\nabout certain issues such as the number of American casu-\nalties in the War in Iraq, the Occupy Wall Street movement,\nor abstinence-only sex education have tended to be inac-\ncurate when conservative news outlets such as Fox are their\nmain news sources (Jamieson & Cappella, 2009; Johansen\nYoung & Brewer, 2012). Similarly, Democrats and liberals\ntended to find CNN and NPR as more honest. Partisan\nweblogs may have magnified these kinds of effects on\npolarization (Baum & Groeling, 2008; Eveland & Dylko,\nsources potentially seen as more liberal have not seemed to\nbe as partisan.\nFragmented or more insular information environments\ncan contribute to lower understanding of political views con-\ntrary to one's own and to lower tolerance for conflicting\nexposure to \"likeminded\" partisan news appears to lead to\ndecreased tolerance of a diversity of views, decreased under-\nstanding of other groups, and decreased accuracy of issue\nknowledge, especially among more partisan groups who may\nbe among the easiest to mobilize to support political candi-\nstated,\nStudies of the conservative movement in the United States\nhave also focused on its cultural dimensions and, particularly,\nthe [New Right's] media empire. Beginning with radio and\nbook publishing houses and then extending into cable\ntelevision, think tanks, and Internet social networking sites,\nthe NR has created an intellectual apparatus that promotes the\nconservative agenda and articulates a conservative cultural\nidentity. This intellectual base represents an alternative to\nacademic locations and the scientific community and is often\nsocially distinguished and reinforced through its criticism of\n\"liberal\" bias in these cultural spheres (Blee & Creasap, 2010;\nDunlap, and Freeman (2008) have identified an elite-driven\nmovement that is culturally located in conservative think tanks\nand media outlets and often disputes scientific conclusions to\nadvance ideological or financial goals. (see also Oreskes and\nThe following research questions and hypothesis derive\nfrom these findings:\nResearch Question 6a (RQ6a): Will conservatives and\nliberals have equivalent use and attention to major mass\nmedia about the presidential election?\nResearch Question 6b (RQ6b): Will education make a\ndifference in the media behavior of liberals and\nconservatives?\nHypothesis 6: Conservatives will be more distrustful of\nmainstream media than liberals.\nPolitical Party Identification\nWhile some argue that political partisanship is the concept\nthat people can identify with more easily than ideology\n(Levendusky, 2009), ideology is the focus here because ide-\nology and anti-science political stances are frequently identi-\nfied as important public policy issues (e.g., Gauchat, 2012;\npartisanship appear to be increasingly correlated over time,\nhowever (Abramowitz & Saunders, 2005; McCright &\nHossain, & Lyons, in press).\nMethod\nData are from the 2008 ANES, which conducted face-to-face\n73 min and were carried out September 2 through November\n91 min and were conducted November 5 through December 30,\nand the post-election maximum response rate was 57.7%.12\nThe data were weighted to adjust for age, education, non-\nresponse, and attrition. The survey used randomization by a\ncomputer-assisted interviewing procedure, used for selection\nof half-samples to reduce overall interview length, and for\nquestion order within batteries. The number of cases for the\npresent analyses was less than the total because respondents\nwho did not think of themselves in ideological terms were\nomitted from the analysis.\nDemographics.Besides education, demographics frequently\nidentified as characteristics important to citizenship and\nunderstanding of political and scientific issues are age (being\nolder), family income (higher), and gender (male; Bennett,\nMcCright & Dunlap, 2011). Furthermore, Caucasians have\nhad more advantages, knowledge, and access to relevant\ninformation sources (Gaziano & Horowitz, 2001; Williams\n& Collins, 1995). Respondents were asked the grade of\nschool or year of college they had completed (recorded as\ncategories); the month, day, and year of their birth; race; and\nhousehold income (recorded as categories). Interviewers\nobserved gender.\n6 SAGE Open\nIdeology.Ideology was measured on a 7-point scale on\nwhich the political views that people might hold were\narranged from extremely liberal (=1) to extremely conserva-\ntive (=7). Respondents were asked, \"Where would you place\nyourself on this scale, or haven't you thought much about\nthis? (Political party identification was measured on a\n7-point scale, ranging from strong Democrat [= 0] to strong\nRepublican [= 6].)\nReligious value predispositions.\nRespondents were asked\nwhether they considered religion to be an important part of\ntheir lives, how much guidance it gave them, how often they\nprayed, and how often they attended religious services. In\naddition, people were asked whether they thought the Bible\nis the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, whether\nit is the word of God but not everything in it should be taken\nliterally, or whether the Bible is a book written by men and is\nnot the word of God. If they were Christian, they were asked,\n\"Would you call yourself a born-again Christian, that is, have\nyou personally had a conversion experience related to Jesus\nChrist?\" In addition, a religiosity score was constructed by\nsumming responses to amount of guidance, frequency of\npraying, and frequency of attending religious services (Cron-\nIn the United States, the principal religions represented\nare Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, although Christians\nconsiderably outnumber Jews. Respondents who attended\nother types of religious services or thought of themselves as\npart of some other religious denomination were just a frac-\ntion of the total. For instance, less than 2% attended non-\nJudeo-Christianservices,andabout6%thoughtofthemselves\nas Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or other non-Judeo-Christian\nreligion, regardless of attendance at services.\nChild rearing value predispositions.A 4-point scale of child\nrearing values was constructed, ranging from low to high\nauthoritarianism, following Feldman and Stenner (1997).\nRespondents were asked to choose between four word pairs\ndescribing desirable qualities for children to have. Each pair\ncontained one \"authoritarian\" word and one \"non-authori-\ntarian\" (self-direction) word. Authoritarian responses were\nscored 1, non-authoritarian responses were scored 0, and\nresponses that neither or both were important (or not cer-\ntain) were scored 0.5. The child rearing values score summed\nup responses for each of the four questions, ranging from\nword pairs.) The wording was, \"Although there are a num-\nber of qualities that people feel that children should have,\nevery person thinks that some are more important than oth-\ners. I am going to read you pairs of desirable qualities. For\neach pair please tell me which one you think is more impor-\ntant for a child to have: [`Both' should be volunteered.] 1.\nIndependence or respect for elders, 2. Obedience or self-\nreliance, 3. Curiosity or good manners, and 4. Being consid-\nerate or well behaved.\" [The authoritarian response is\nitalicized.] Cronbach's  = .60. This compares with .49\n(Cronbach) for Feldman and Stenner (1997).\nOpinionation.\nThree questions measured opinionation:\n(a) \"Would you say you have opinions about almost every-\nthing, about many things, about some things, or about very\nfew things? (rescaled from low to high); (b) \"If you wanted\nto defend an opinion of yours, how successfully do you think\nyou could do that?\" using a 5-point scale, rescaled from low\nto high; and, (c) \"Of the situations when you see two people\ndisagreeing with one another, in how many of them can you\nsee how both people could be right?\" using a 5-point scale,\nfrom low to high.\nNeed for cognition. Participants were asked, \"Do you like hav-\ning responsibility for handling situations that require a lot of\nthinking, do you dislike it, or do you neither like it nor dislike\nit?\" (after follow-up questions: 5-point scale dislike it a lot =\n1; like it a lot = 5). Second, \"some people prefer to solve sim-\nple problems instead of complex ones, whereas other people\nprefer to solve more complex problems. Which type of prob-\nlem do you prefer to solve: simple or complex?\"\nOrientation toward politics. Respondents were asked the num-\nber of days in a week they discussed politics with their fam-\nily or friends, and they were asked how interested they were\nin politics and government on a 5-point scale, rescaled from\nlow to high.13 An 8-point political participation scale (0-7)\nwas created by summing the number of positive answers to\nquestions about actions such as trying to persuade others to\nvote for a particular party or candidate; attending any gather-\nings in support of a candidate; displaying a campaign button,\na car bumper campaign sticker, or a sign on their property,\nworking for parties or candidates; and giving money to polit-\nical groups.\nMass media access and use. Participants were asked whether\nthey watched any programs about the presidential campaign\non television, read about it in any magazines or any newspa-\npers, heard any speeches or discussions about it on the radio,\nor accessed information about it on the Internet. If they had,\nthey also were asked about frequency of use and amount of\nattention paid to content.14 Because exposure and attention\nwere highly correlated, ranging from .75 to .93 and some\nresearchers recommend combining them (e.g., Cacciatore,\nquency and level of attention were standardized and com-\nbined into one variable for each medium. Intercorrelations\nranged from .09 (Internet and newspapers) to .39 (magazines\nand newspapers), with most in the .2 range. In addition,\nrespondents were asked, \"How much of the time do you\nthink you can trust the media to report the news fairly?--Just\nabout always, most of the time, only some of the time, or\nalmost never?\" (recoded from low to high).\nAnalysis\nFirst, respondents were divided into high (some college or\nmore education) and low (high school degree or less) educa-\ntion groups, and they were also divided into conservatives,\nmoderates, and liberals. These groups were cross-tabulated\nto form six groups. Key variables were examined according\nto these groups. Then, a hierarchical ordinary least squares\nregression was conducted with the dependent variable, ideol-\nogy, regressed on the independent variables, entered in\nblocks to determine the best predictors. The demographic\nvariables were entered first, then religiosity, child rearing\nvalues, and opinion and cognitive variables, followed by\npolitical discussion, political interest, political participation,\nand media use variables, in a likely causal order. Four\ninteraction variables followed, for education by each of the\nfollowing: (a) religiosity, (b) child rearing values, (c) opin-\nionation, and (d) need for cognition. These variables were\nfirst centered before being multiplied to create interaction\nterms to reduce potential multicollinearity between the terms\nand their components. (Similarly, these variables were\nregressed on political party identification separately, because\npartisanship and ideology were expected to be highly\ncorrelated.)\nResults\nSupport for the hypotheses will be examined for each con-\nceptual group of variables and then re-examined in light of\nthe regression on ideology.\nEducation and ideology.Roughly one fourth of the citizens\ninterviewed were liberals, more than one fourth were moder-\nates, and fewer than one half were conservatives (Table 1).\nThe first hypothesis predicted that higher education would\nbe positively related to greater liberalism and conversely,\nlower education would be related to greater conservatism.\nAbout three fourths of liberals had been to college, com-\npared with somewhat more than half of moderates and two\nthirds of conservatives. Hypothesis 1, which expected educa-\ntion and ideology to be inversely related, was weakly sup-\nported; however, the pattern was somewhat unexpected\nbecause more conservatives and liberals than moderates had\nbeen to college. One of the most notable results, however,\nwas that better-educated conservatives constituted the largest\nof the 6 groups, nearly 3 in 10 respondents, compared with\nabout 2 in 10 who were better-educated liberals. There also\nwere more than twice as many less-educated conservatives\nas less-educated liberals. Further results for education will be\nexamined later.\nRQ1 asked whether there were other demographic differ-\nences between conservatives and liberals. Table 1 indicates\nmany differences. As a group, better-educated liberals and\nmoderates were younger (see Table 2 for results on age) and\nmore likely to be single or to be female than other groups\n(Table 1). Less-educated conservatives were disproportion-\nately more likely to be male. Most notably, although liberals\nhad an advantage over others in education, better-educated\nconservatives were the wealthiest group. Less-educated lib-\nerals were very different from more-educated liberals in\nrace, incomes, work status, and disability status. More-\neducated conservatives were disproportionately more likely\nto be White and to be married. Well-educated liberals were\nespecially likely to be working. More students were found\namong well-educated moderates. Better-educated liberals\nwere much more willing than other groups to identify them-\nselves as homosexual or bisexual. Less-educated moderates\nand conservatives were more likely than others to have\nserved or to be serving in the military, and more-educated\nliberals were the least likely to have military service. As\nwould be expected, liberals tended to be Democrats, regard-\nless of educational level. Conservatives tended to be\nRepublicans, particularly more-educated conservatives.\nModerates were inclined to be Independents, as would be\nexpected; very few of them were Republicans.\nReligious value predispositions.The second hypothesis stated\nthat religiosity would be positively related to conservatism.\nMore than 8 in 10 conservatives said that religion was an\nimportant part of their lives, regardless of education (Table 3).\nFewer than 6 in 10 well-educated liberals said this. Other\ngroups fell in between. Less-educated liberals and all conser-\nvatives tended to agree that religion provided a great deal of\nguidance in day-to-day living. Better-educated liberals\ntended to say that it gave them \"some guidance\" than to say\n\"a great deal of guidance.\" Better-educated conservatives\nwere well above the average in reporting attendance at reli-\ngious services, and all conservatives were above average in\nhow often they prayed (Table 2). Although more of the well-\neducated liberals said that they attended services than said\nthey did not, those saying they did not ever attend services\nwere the largest proportion of all the groups who said this.\nOverall religiosity was the highest in conservatives, espe-\ncially those who were highly educated. It was the lowest\namong highly educated liberals but not as low in less-edu-\ncated liberals. Roughly half of all the more-educated groups\nagreed that the Bible is God's word but not all of it should be\ninterpreted literally (Table 3). Nearly 4 in 10 liberals per-\nceived it as a book written by people only, considerably more\nthan other groups. Six in 10 less-educated conservatives and\nnearly 5 in 10 less-educated moderates believed that the\nBible is literally the word of God. Approximately two thirds\nof all conservatives reported born-again experiences as\nChristians, compared with one third of well-educated liber-\nals. In general, Hypothesis 2 was supported.\nChild rearing value predispositions.Hypothesis 3a stated that\nconservatives would have more authoritarian child rearing\nvalues than liberals. Hypothesis 3b proposed that higher edu-\ncation would be related to less authoritarian child rearing\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

More-educated liberals scored lower on this measure\nthan others, while less-educated liberals scored above the\nmean, giving only partial support to Hypothesis 3a (Table 2).\nAlthough conservatives tended to give an authoritarian\nresponse, less-educated conservatives scored higher on this\nthan more-educated conservatives did. Hypothesis 3b was\nsupported only for better-educated liberals; better-educated\nmoderates and conservatives tended to be average in authori-\ntarian child rearing values.\nOpinionation. Hypothesis 4 stated that conservatives and lib-\nerals would be equally opinionated. The more-educated lib-\nerals and conservatives tended to say that they had more\nopinions than others, which lends some support to the\nhypothesis (Table 2). Less-educated liberals were nearly as\nlikely to report being opinionated as more-educated liberals.\nResults, therefore, did not provide a clear answer to RQ2\nabout the role of education in moderating the relation of ide-\nology and opinionation. Responses to two other questions\nabout opinions were examined. Respondents were asked\nhow successfully they thought they could defend their opin-\nions. Better-educated liberals felt the most confident of\nstanding up for their opinions, and less-educated moderates\nand conservatives showed the least confidence. The partici-\npants were also asked, of situations when they see two peo-\nple disagreeing with each other, in how many they could see\nthat both could be right. More-educated moderates and liber-\nals were the most able to do this, and less-educated conserva-\ntives tended to be the least able to perceive this.\nNeed for cognition.Hypothesis 5a expected that conserva-\ntives and liberals would differ in need for cognition but\nreceived mixed support in this initial look at results. Hypoth-\nesis 5b stated that education would moderate this relation-\nship but did not receive clear-cut support. Well-educated\nconservatives and liberals tended to prefer responsibility for\nhandling a lot of thinking, closely followed by well-educated\nmoderates (Table 2). Nearly two thirds of well-educated lib-\nerals favored complex problems over simple ones, compared\nwith about half of better-educated conservatives (data not\nshown). Well-educated moderates fell in between. All the\nless-educated groups chose simple problems over complex\nones.\nOrientation toward politics.RQ3a asked whether conserva-\ntives and liberals would discuss the presidential election\nequally frequently. RQ4a enquired about ideology and inter-\nest in politics and public affairs. RQ5a concerned whether\nliberals and conservatives were equally politically active.\nRQ3b, RQ4b, and RQ5b asked whether education would\nmake a difference in these political orientation variables.\nConservatives did not talk about the election with others or\nTable 2.

Highly edu-\ncated liberals and conservatives had the highest interest\nlevels.\nMass media access and use. RQ6a asked whether conserva-\ntives and liberals would have equivalent access, use, and\nattention to major mass media about the presidential elec-\ntion, and RQ6b asked whether education would influence\ntheir media behaviors. Access to television did not differ\namong them (Table 4). Radio speeches and discussions about\nthe campaign and newspapers reached better-educated liber-\nals and conservatives in fairly similar numbers. Among the\nless-educated groups, conservatives accessed radio the most\noften. Education did not affect newspaper access very much,\nalthough well-educated political moderates stood out as\nnewspaper readers; however, more-educated liberals had\nconsiderably greater access to magazines and the Internet\nthan more-educated conservatives and moderates.\nHypothesis 6 expected conservatives to be more skeptical\nof mainstream media. It was supported particularly by results\nfor the more-educated conservatives (Table 2). Less-educated\nconservatives were also mistrustful but not as strongly.\nLiberals found the media the most credible, especially those\nwith less education.\nRegression on ideology. Demographics, religiosity, authoritar-\nian child rearing values, opinionation, need for cognition,\norientation toward politics, and mass media variables were\nentered in blocks and regressed on ideology to examine these\nrelationships more fully when controls were added (Table 5).\nPolitical party identification was not entered because of\nthe high relationship between ideology and party (r = .61,\np  .001). For comparison, however, a separate regression on\npartisanship with the same independent variables was\nperformed.\nThe first hypothesis expected that higher education would\nbe positively related to greater liberalism, and conversely,\nlower education would be related to greater conservatism.\nThe hypothesis was supported even when other variables\nwere controlled. Interestingly, the relation of household\nincome, another indicator of SES, was opposite of the results\nfor education. RQ1 asked whether demographics besides\neducation were of importance, as mentioned earlier. Lower\neducation, higher household incomes, being male, and being\nWhite were of the greatest importance because they remained\nsignificant in the final model, while age was no longer sig-\nnificant. The demographic variables explained 6.9% of the\nvariance in ideology.\nHypothesis 2 expected religiosity and conservatism to be\npositively related, and Hypothesis 3 expected authoritarian\nchild rearing values to be positively related to conservatism.\nBoth of these were supported when controls were added.\nThree variables relevant to opinions were included. They\nwere not highly interrelated, indicating that they measured\ndifferent things. These were being opinionated, believing\none could successfully defend one's opinions, and being able\nto see two disagreeing parties as potentially being right at\nTable 3. Religious Value Predispositions by Education and Ideology Categories.\nVariables\nLow\neducation/\nLow education/\nmoderate\nLow education/\nconservative\nHigh\neducation/\nliberal\nHigh\neducation/\nmoderate\nHigh\neducation/\nconservative\nTotal\nIs religion an important part of R's life?\nHow much guidance does religion provide to R in day-to-day living?\nWould you call yourself a born-again Christian?\nIs the Bible literally the word of God, or is it written by men?\ntimes. Although all three were correlated initially with ideol-\nogy, only the third played a significant role. The sign was\nnegative, meaning that inability to see two sides to an argu-\nment being right sometimes was related to greater conserva-\ntism. Results relevant to Hypothesis 4 showed that\nopinionation did not characterize one ideological group more\nthan another. Need for cognition was not a significant predic-\ntor, pertinent to Hypothesis 5a, suggesting that this variable\ndid not set conservatives and liberals apart from each other.\nValue predisposition, opinion, and cognitive variables\nexplained 11.3% of the variance in ideology.\nRQ3a, RQ4a, and RQ5a concerned ideology and orienta-\ntion to politics (discussion, interest, and participation, respec-\ntively), and RQ3b, RQ4b, and RQ5b asked about the role of\neducation in these relations. They were not significant and\nscarcely explained any variance.\nRQ6a asked whether conservatives and liberals would\nhave equivalent mass media use and attention concerning\nthe presidential election. The negative sign for the zero-\norder relation of these variables suggested that lower fre-\nquency of use and attention to mass media were predictors\nof conservatism, but none of these relationships was sig-\nnificant when controls were added. Hypothesis 6 indicated\nthat conservatives would be more distrustful of mainstream\nmedia than liberals, and distrust of media to report news\nfairly was significant. Media variables explained 4.4% of\nthe variance, nearly all of which came from lack of media\ntrust.\nInteractions with education were examined with respect\nto four variables: religious value predispositions, authoritar-\nian child rearing value dispositions, opinionation, and need\nfor cognition. The first three were positive and significant;\nneed for cognition was negative and significant. They\nexplained 1% of the variance. These interactions further\naddress support for Hypothesis 3b (concerning authoritarian\nchild rearing values and education), RQ2 (concerning the\nmoderating role of education on opinion), and Hypothesis 5b\n(about education and need for cognition). Higher education\nwas related to lower conservatism when levels of religiosity,\nauthoritarian values, and opinionation were lower; however,\nwhen conservatism was higher, the more educated also\ntended to be higher in religiosity, authoritarian child rearing\nvalues, and opinionation. Second, higher education was\nrelated to lower conservatism when participants had higher\nneed for cognition; conversely, higher education correlated\nwith higher conservatism when need for cognition was lower.\nThe overall regression model explained almost 25% of\nthe variance in ideology (23.4% adjusted R2).\nBecause ideology and partisanship were highly corre-\nlated, a separate regression on political partisanship (high\nscores = Republican) was conducted. It produced a some-\nwhat similar pattern of results (not shown). Education was\nnot very important when demographics were controlled nor\nwas being able to see two sides of an argument. Greater polit-\nical participation and lower magazine use and attention were\npredictors. The patterns of interactions were similar, but only\nTable 4.

It used cross-sectional data and was not able to use\nthe panel design. More needs to be known about changes in\nideological differentials over time. It may be that belief gaps\ndue to ideology open and close fluidly over time as some\nresearch indicates that knowledge gaps do (Viswanath,\nhypothesizes, may widen over time. The purpose of the\nstudy, however, was to examine the relation between educa-\ntion and ideology, and the results contribute insights into\nTable 5.

A number of available\nquestions concerned key concepts examined in the present\nstudy: religious value predispositions, child rearing value\npredispositions, opinionation, need for cognition, orientation\ntoward politics, and media access and use.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis study sought to examine the relationship between edu-\ncation and ideology to better understand belief gaps between\nconservatives and liberals. The study used 2008 ANES data\nto compare conservatives, moderates, and liberals by educa-\ntion on several characteristics, values, and actions. Liberalism\nwas related to higher education, and conversely, conserva-\ntism was related to lower education. When respondents were\ndivided by low and high education and by liberal, moderate,\nor conservative philosophy, however, well-educated conser-\nvatives were the largest group. The group of better-educated\nliberals was less than three fourths that size. Well-educated\nliberals, on the whole, were more likely than conservatives to\nhave graduate work beyond college and were not as affluent\nas well-educated conservatives. They also tended to be\nyounger and were less likely to be married.\nAuthoritarianism and its kindred constructs are related to\nlower public affairs knowledge (McLeod & Perse, 1994;\nThis may occur even when authoritarians hold strong opin-\nions about political matters (Peterson et al., 2002). Others\nhave found that education tends to have a negative relation\nwith authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson,\n& Sanford, 1950; Marcus, Sullivan, Theiss-Morse, & Wood,\nmay have a liberalizing effect on authoritarian attitudes\nbecause of increased cognitive development, sophistication,\nand abstract thinking; increased opportunity to meet people\nof varied backgrounds; augmented political expertise, and\nunderstanding of the importance of democratic principles;\nand improved self-esteem (Altemeyer, 1988; Marcus et al.,\nistics are related to exposure to information, receptiveness to\nnew ideas and experiences, and general curiosity (McCrae,\nIn many respects, the characteristics of more-educated\nliberals contrasted sharply with those of more-educated con-\nservatives and evoked the picture of divergent cultures.\nMore-educated liberals differed from all the other groups in\na number of ways, including a greater tendency to be younger,\nfemale, non-White, employed, less religious, more oriented\ntoward thinking and complex problem solving, and more\nopinionated than others. They varied markedly from other\ngroups in their child rearing values. They tended more than\nothers to have encountered the 2008 presidential campaign\nin magazines and on the Internet, to not have military\nservice, and to be willing to self-identify as homosexual or\nbisexual.\nThe regression analysis on ideology produced an image of\nstronger conservatives as being well-to-do White males who\nare more religious, inclined to interpret the Bible literally,\nand more authoritarian in their views on child rearing. They\ntend to have difficulty in seeing the viewpoints of others,\ndistrust the media, and may possibly have more constricted\ninformation environments than others (although results that\ncould have supported this latter assertion did not attain statis-\ntical significance).\nOther research has shown that conservatives appear to\nlive in increasingly insular environments, further segregated\nby influences of the media of the New Right. Not trusting the\nmajor media to cover news fairly was a predictor of conser-\nvatism. This echoes the finding that conservatives, especially\nif more educated, tend to have lower trust in science (Gauchat,\n2012) and greater skepticism about President Barack\nObama's having been born in the United States, especially\nwith higher attentiveness to conservative media outlets\nThe portrait of diverging cultures based on differences in\nideology supports the \"belief-knowledge\" gap hypothesis\nAs the infusion of mass media information into society\nincreases, certain groups will tend to acquire this information at\na faster rate than other groups, so that the gap in knowledge\nbetween these groups tends to increase because of differences\nin their social construction of knowledge--that is, their cultures.\nSuch a conceptualization recalls recent writings describ-\ning \"culture wars\" based on ideological differences (Fiorina,\nZimmerman, 2002). When issues are controversial, which\ngroups will prevail in defining what constitutes knowledge,\ndepends in part, on their access to, and influence by, elite and\npowerful organizations, factions, and other groups.\nWhile many knowledge gap studies and some belief gap\nstudies have focused on education as an indicator of SES,\nnone has considered situations in which education and\nincome might define opposing groups, because education,\nincome, and occupation tend to be related. The results for\nhousehold income suggest that when knowledge or belief\ngaps based on differences in ideology occur, one of the most\npowerful underlying explanations is income, as Gauchat\n(2012) has proposed. Larger household incomes may be\nmore important than education in creating ideology gaps. A\ncomparison of correlations of ideology with education and\nincome in several polls in Table 6 shows this pattern, includ-\ning three of five from Hindman's (2009) study that reported\nsignificant results for income. Results for only one poll out\nof nine polls depart from this pattern (note that results dis-\nplay the more stringent two-tailed significance values).\nIt appears that income, combined with conservatism, may\nnow come to play an unexpected and complicating part in\ndefining beliefs about the facts of issues or interpretations of\nthe facts. High incomes may trump high education in boost-\ning some groups' social influence, including access to pow-\nerful interest groups. These findings suggest a reformulation\nof the belief gap hypothesis as follows:\nUnder the condition of increasing social conflict, as the infusion\nof mass media information into a social system increases, groups\nwith greater social power will tend to define the meaning of\ninformation in ways that benefit them, so that the gap in\ninterpretation of what constitutes knowledge tends to increase\nrather than decrease between groups with greater and lesser\nsocial power.\nThe relationship of ideology and income may strengthen\nover time if the relationship of ideology and partisanship is\nincreasingly correlated, as some observe (Abramowitz &\nreligious and child rearing values may further reinforce the\ndifferences between better-educated liberals and other groups\nin the future as their children come of age. Perhaps differ-\nences between liberals and conservatives in sheer numbers,\nculture, marital status, number of children, education,\nincomes, and access to influential interest groups may play a\nrole in amassing social power, as well.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n\n1.
