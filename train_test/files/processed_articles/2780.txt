Whereas the federal government\nfunded roughly two-thirds of R&D in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s, this relationship is\nnow flipped so that private industry is now funding roughly two-thirds of U.S. R&D [1]. Fur-\nther, university scientists increasingly are participating in public-private partnerships with\nindustry, government service or regulatory agencies, and/or non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs) to engage with stakeholders and secure more consistent research funding in the face\nof budgetary constraints on governmental research funding [2\u00ad4].\nCitation: Besley JC, McCright AM, Zahry NR, Elliott\nKC, Kaminski NE, Martin JD (2017) Perceived\nconflict of interest in health science partnerships.\nEditor: Joshua L Rosenbloom, Iowa State\nCopyright: \u00a9 2017 Besley et al.

This research is not directly related to\nthe current project. This does not alter our\nadherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data\nand materials.\nNevertheless, public skepticism of industry-funded research (e.g., [5, 6]) might constrain the\nefficacy and influence of its results. The tobacco industry's efforts to deny the detrimental pub-\nlic-health effects of its products is a well-known example of activities that have raised public\nawareness of the possibility that industry-funded science could be less than fully reliable [7].\nMore recently, publications about the safety testing of industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals\n[8\u00ad12], as well as about anthropogenic climate change [13\u00ad15], may have further contributed to\npublic concerns about the legitimacy of science in which industry has played a role. On the\nother hand, the simple solution of asking scientific researchers to eschew all industry funding\nand research collaborations seems unfeasible and undesirable, as a significant amount of impor-\ntant and scientifically sound research would not be performed--to the detriment of society [16].\nThe question of how researchers might benefit from available industry funding without\ndiminishing the real or perceived quality of their research suggests the potential for a multidis-\nciplinary research program that examines the procedures that might be used to protect\nresearch. The current set of studies represents one piece of such a work program and is built\non the assumption that efforts to design procedures for protecting research should be\ninformed by information about the types of procedures and/or criteria that generate public\nconfidence in the legitimacy of the resulting research. More generally, the current set of studies\nseeks to develop an initial understanding of how laypeople's perceptions of a scientific research\ncollaboration are influenced by concerns about conflicts of interest. As is discussed below, the\nchoice of research partners is conceptualized as a basic way to communicate to others that a\nresearch team is concerned about taking multiple viewpoints into account and that no one set\nof interests will dominate. Other procedures to limit conflict of interest (see the discussion sec-\ntion) are also possible but an initial focus on research partners is meant to help establish a\nfoundation for future work.\nPast scholarship suggests that procedural justice concepts from social psychology may offer\ninsights for assessing how laypeople perceive research partnerships, given that such collabora-\ntions can be understood as processes that researchers use to control biases and consider alter-\nnative viewpoints. After reviewing existing work in this area, we identify selected research\nquestions and derive key hypotheses from procedural justice scholarship. Specifically, we are\ninterested in how different collaborations (i.e., processes) can affect perceptions that research\nwill be done appropriately (i.e., procedural fairness) and the degree to which such perceptions\nmay also shape overall perceptions of the research (i.e., perceived legitimacy). We then discuss\nour research protocols and present the results from three experiments designed to examine\nhow the inclusion of different partners in a health-related research collaboration influences the\nperceived procedural fairness and perceived legitimacy of the resulting research. In each exper-\niment, subjects considered a hypothetical research collaboration studying the health effects of\ntransfats in foods (Studies 1 and 3) or the health effects of genetically modified (GM) food\n(Study 2) that included an agrifood business, a research university, a government agency, and/\nor an NGO. In our conclusion, we outline a further research agenda for investigating the\nextent to which certain safeguards designed to reduce conflicts of interest may facilitate the\nproduction of high-quality industry-funded research that laypeople perceive as legitimate. In\nour current set of three studies, we focus on perceptions of conflict of interest and do not\nmake specific claims about the degree to which procedures such as partnership arrangements\nare actually effective at limiting the effects of conflicted interests.\nExisting scholarship\nGiven the paucity of theoretically driven work in this area, our project conceptualizes collabo-\nration as a conflict of interest mitigation procedure. It does so to build upon and extend a\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nstudy that employs well-established procedural justice scholarship (e.g., [17]) to examine per-\nceived conflict of interest in science [18]. Analyzing data from a cross-sectional survey of peo-\nple who attended Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory meetings, McComas, et al.\n[18] find that attendees' fairness perceptions were associated both with satisfaction with the\ncommittee process and willingness to accept the outcomes from the process (i.e., perceived\nlegitimacy). Our project builds upon that study, as well as the broader procedural justice litera-\nture, by using experimental procedures to examine how the inclusion of different partners\naffects procedural fairness perceptions and, ultimately, willingness to use the research as a\nlegitimate basis for personal or public decision-making.\nDefining conflict of interest\nMost scholarship characterizes a conflict of interest as a situation in which an individual or\norganization has a decision-making role that might allow them to improperly benefit from the\ndecisions they might make. This benefit could be financial, but it also could be personal (i.e.,\nhelping a friend) or a combination of the two (i.e., helping a work colleague). A benefit also\nmight include avoidance of harm. Importantly, the existence of a conflict of interest does not\nrequire any specific behavior to occur. A conflict of interest is only the potential or tendency\nfor biased behavior to occur (for a longer discussion, see: [19, 20, 21]). A relatively recent U.S.\nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) report similarly defines conflicts of interest as \"circumstances\nthat create a risk that professional judgments or actions regarding a primary interest will be\nunduly influenced by a secondary interest\" ([22] p. 6). Primary interests here include issues\nsuch as the protection of research integrity, students, and patients, while secondary interests\ninclude personal and professional concerns.\nMost academic writing about conflicts of interest focuses on issues of disclosure. For exam-\nple, leading medical journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association ([e.g.,\nreviewing existing disclosure policies and their impacts. Commentaries also suggest potential\nissues and recommend policy changes (e.g., [29, 30\u00ad32]). Such recommendations are indeed a\ncentral part of the IOM report cited above [22]. Although disclosure policies are clearly impor-\ntant, they are not a panacea [33]; indeed, some research demonstrates that disclosure policies\nmay decrease the quality of advice that experts provide [34, 35]. Less common are studies on\nthe origins and impact of conflict of interest perceptions.\nExperimental research on conflict of interest\nAs expected, the scant available scholarship suggests that conflict of interest perceptions have\nnegative impacts on how people view research. A 2010 systematic review identifies 20 relevant\npeer-reviewed journal articles focused on perceptions of `financial ties' in the context of health\nand medicine [36]. Most studies find that, when asked directly, research participants report\nworrying about the impact of such conflicts and wanting to know about such conflicts. More\nimportant for our project, the limited experimental research reviewed finds that disclosure\n(versus non-disclosure) of industry funding decreases perceived research quality [37, 38] and\ndecreases trust in the researchers [39]. More recent research confirms such effects [40]. Fur-\nther, increasing the relative size of potential financial conflicts decreases trust perceptions [41].\nNevertheless, medical research participants do not appear to be substantially less likely to\nenroll in clinical trials in the face of conflicts of interest [36, 42].\nThese earlier experimental studies typically ask subjects to review a research product (e.g., a\npaper) written by authors either in an industry or an academic position. Our project is novel\nsince we more closely approximate the current reality of research funding and partnerships.\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nBriefly, in our three experiments we randomly assign subjects to one of 15 different combina-\ntions of research partners--rather than simply ask subjects to consider a simple study or single\nresearch outcome.\nProcedural fairness and the study of conflict of interest\nWe further bolster the novelty of our project by integrating insights from theory associated\nwith procedural justice scholarship into the study of conflict of interest in science. Research in\nthis area consistently shows that people often perceive decisions as legitimate--even if the per-\nson feels the decision may go against their interests--if they believe that such decisions result\nfrom fair procedures (i.e., ones that allow stakeholders to have a voice and are free from biases\nthat might arise from conflicts of interest) employed by decision-makers who are seen as inter-\npersonally fair (i.e., actors who are respectful) [43, 44]. Indeed, this focus on the effects of `pro-\ncedural' rather than `distributive' forms of fairness has emerged from a critique of a rational\nchoice approach to decision-making assuming that people only care about outcomes [45].\nThe three studies reported below conceptualize research involving potential risks as a `deci-\nsion' about which an observer (e.g., someone who is trying to decide about whether to consider\nnew evidence) might make legitimacy judgments. The work further views the choice of\nresearch partners as a conflict of interest mitigation process that researchers can use to, at least\npartly, make the decision process more procedurally fair. The logic of considering collabora-\ntion as a conflict of interest mitigation process is similar to why one might want to include rep-\nresentatives from different parts of an organization when making decisions about major\nhiring. Likewise, the logic underlies why a political leader might want to build a coalition that\nincludes different constituencies in a cabinet. The expectation is that having multiple voices\nparticipate is likely to limit the effect of any one voice.\nThe adaption of procedural justice concepts seems important for the current set of studies\nbecause past research on conflict of interest does not feature theory prominently (e.g.,[36]).\nBuilding on past procedural justice theory can both provide a framework for measurement\nand analyses in the current work as well as suggest additional areas of future research. As\nnoted above, McComas and her colleagues [18] apply procedural justice theory and find that\nthe degree to which attendees saw FDA advisory committees as following fair procedures was\nassociated with overall satisfaction and willingness to accept committee decisions. However,\nwhereas this earlier study examines perceptions of an existing process, the current work seeks\nto identify processes that researchers might use to mitigate perceptions of bias.\nAlthough not tested here, two related mechanisms likely underlie the impact of fairness per-\nceptions [46]. The most prominent is that people use procedural fairness as a heuristic to assess\nan outcome when they are unsure about what would constitute a correct outcome [47, 48]. This\nargument is consistent with findings that fair processes have little impact on those who see a\ndecision as morally mandated--and thus not uncertain (e.g., [49]). Second, other scholarship\nposits that fair processes and fair treatment matter because they communicate to those affected\nby a decision that they are valued members of a social identity group. Research supporting this\nassertion shows that fair process perceptions have a greater impact within groups than between\ngroups [50, 51]. These underlying mechanisms suggest that a person might use information\nabout the partners in a research collaboration to make heuristic sense of a scientific study for\nwhich she or he may not have the time or ability to assess based its scientific merits. As such, we\nassume that our experimental subjects are using partnership information as a heuristic cue to\nhelp make sense of the likely fairness of the partnership to which they are randomly assigned.\nAlthough much fairness research centers on workplace settings, scholars also consider\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nrelevance here is recent research that adapts the study of fairness to public perceptions of sci-\nentific topics involving perceived health and environmental risk [57\u00ad62].\nThe current research\nWe perform three experimental studies to examine how different combinations of partners in\na research collaboration influence subjects' perceived procedural fairness and perceived legiti-\nmacy for that collaborative partnership. Although it is possible to imagine a range of ways to\ncharacterize a research partnership, we focus here on what we think is the most basic informa-\ntion about a partnership that might be communicated to create or alleviate concerns about\nconflict of interest: who is performing the research.\nFirst, procedural justice scholarship and past research on conflict of interest suggests that a\ncollaboration with industry or supported by industry funding will be seen as less fair and,\nthrough fairness, less legitimate. We formally state this as a two-part hypothesis describing\nfairness perceptions as a mediator.\nIncluding an industry partner in a research collaboration (Hypothesis1a) directly reduces\nperceived fairness and (H1b) indirectly reduces perceived legitimacy.\nIt is less clear, however, how including other partners will influence fairness and legitimacy\nperceptions. As mentioned earlier, we consider three additional types of collaborators--uni-\nversity scientists, government agency scientists, and NGO scientists--on their own and in\ncombination. Regarding the former, some recent research finds that university scientists gen-\nerally have positive ratings of trust or fairness [63, 64]. Thus, it seems likely that including uni-\nversity scientists in a collaboration will have a positive effect on fairness and legitimacy\nperceptions.\nIncluding a university partner in a research collaboration (H2a) directly increases perceived\nfairness and (H2b) indirectly increases perceived legitimacy.\nPast research on conflict of interest does not, however, examine how people perceive gov-\nernment agency or NGO partners. The limited research on trust in scientists reveals that both\nof these groups are seen more positively than are industry scientists but less positively than are\nuniversity scientists (e.g., [65, 66]). Given the lack of clear theoretical or empirical direction,\nwe pose the effects of these partners as research questions.\nWhat effect does including a government agency partner in a research collaboration have\n(Research Question 1a) directly on perceived fairness and (RQ1b) indirectly on perceived\nlegitimacy?\nWhat effect does including an NGO partner in a research collaboration have (RQ2a)\ndirectly on perceived fairness and (RQ2b) indirectly on perceived legitimacy?\nMethods\nThe Institutional Review Board of the Human Research Protection Program at Michigan State\nUniversity approved this research (IRB#x15-167e)(exempt).\nStimulus. Study 1 subjects were told that we wanted to learn their views about \"a potential\nnew cooperative research partnership aimed at studying the possible negative health impacts\nof low levels of transfats in food.\" \"S1 Text Stimulus.\" The only part of the message that varied\nacross the experimental conditions was the specific combination of the following partners:\n\u00b7 Kellogg's (a food company);\n\u00b7 Purdue University;\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\n\u00b7 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, a government agency); and\n\u00b7 The Union of Concerned Scientists (a non-governmental organization).\nThe 15 experimental conditions included each possible combination of one, two, three, and\nfour of these partners. We selected these four organizations as representatives of agrifood busi-\nnesses, research universities, governmental agencies, and NGOs, respectively, given the results\nof a pre-test with undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university \"S1 Table.\" Briefly,\nthe pre-test participants viewed these four organizations more positively and less negatively\nthan they viewed similar organizations in these four sectors.\nData collection. We administered our experiment via Qualtrics to subjects we recruited\nvia Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a crowdsourcing website where \"requesters\" solicit\n\"workers\" to perform \"human intelligence tasks\" (HITs) for pay. AMT has emerged as a prac-\ntical way for recruiting a large number of participants from a reasonably wide cross-section of\nthe general public--considerably more diverse than the traditional experiment recruitment\npools of university undergraduates or surrounding community residents--either for online\nexperiments (e.g., [67]) or for designing and testing new measurement instruments (e.g., [68])\nacross the social sciences (e.g., [69, 70]). Although the external validity of crowdsourced sam-\nples is limited (especially when compared to the generalizability of rigorously drawn represen-\ntative samples), several studies confirm the value of AMT samples for assessing internal\nvalidity related to cause and effect, especially with between-subject experiments [70\u00ad72]. Fur-\nther, we see no a priori reason to expect that the pattern of results found using our AMT sam-\nple would vary substantially with a different sample.\nTo solicit a broad cross-section of research subjects and minimize self-selection by AMT\nworkers highly interested in food issues, we advertised a HIT titled \"Industry Views Survey.\"\nWe limited participation to adults residing in the United States. Because this was an online\nexperiment, the first page of the questionnaire included the approved consent statement, and\nsubjects were asked to indicate consent by continuing with the questionnaire.\nfor participating, and the average response time was approximately seven minutes. We used\ntwo factual comprehension questions to screen out those subjects who failed to correctly iden-\ntify the collaborative partners mentioned in their stimulus text. Our final sample includes 526\nsubjects who correctly answered both questions. An a priori power analysis for one-way\nANOVA (main effects and interactions) with 15 groups conducted using G\u00c3Power [73], with a\nrespondents were needed for the current design. Approximately 53% of these subjects are\nfemale, 80% are white, and the average age is 39 (SD = 13). Also, about 27% of these subjects\nonly have a high school diploma or GED, another 16% have earned up to an Associate's\ndegree, 43% hold a Bachelor's degree, and an additional 4% have earned a doctorate or PhD.\nMeasures. As noted, we operationalized conflict of interest as perceived procedural fairness\nwith a scale of seven items adapted from Leventhal [74]. Subjects indicated the extent to which\nthey disagreed (\"strongly disagree\" = 1) or agreed (\"strongly agree\" = 7) that \"the research\npartnership\" will \"ignore stakeholders that they disagree with\" [reverse-coded], \"listen to each\nother's views,\" \"draw on the best available evidence,\" \"keep the best interests of consumers in\nmind,\" \"hide important findings if they don't support their organizations\" [reverse-coded],\n\"work hard to avoid biasing their results,\" and \"slant their research to favor industry needs\"\n[reverse-coded]. The order of these items was randomized. This perceived procedural fairness\nscale is highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .93).\nThe perceived procedural fairness scale correlated highly (r = -.67, p <.01) with a single-\nitem indicator of conflict of interest included in the experiment. For the latter, subjects\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nreported whether they believed the partnership described would create \"NO conflict of inter-\nest\" = 1 to \"a COMPLETE conflict of interest = 7 (M = 3.47, SD = 2.05). We used the per-\nceived procedural fairness scale rather than this single-item indicator here because of the\nmeasurement advantages of multi-item scales and the conceptual desire to advance proce-\ndural fairness as a theoretically grounded way to study conflict of interest. The results of\nadditional analyses using the single-item indicator (available upon request) are similar to\nwhat we present below.\nWe measured perceived legitimacy with a scale of three items asking subjects about how the\nproposed research should be used. Subjects indicated the extent to which they disagreed\n(\"strongly disagree\" = 1) or agreed (\"strongly agree\" = 7) with these three items: \"I would\nmake decisions about my diet based on the results of this partnership,\" \"government should\npay attention to the results of this research partnership,\" and \"I would share the results of this\nresearch with people I know.\" The order of these items was randomized. This perceived legiti-\nmacy scale is reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .79).\nThe results of exploratory factor analysis using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Vari-\nmax rotation (available upon request) indicate that the three perceived legitimacy items are\ndistinct from the seven perceived procedural fairness items. Yet, the two scales are highly cor-\nAnalyses\nWe conducted most of our analyses with SPSS 22. We first performed a one-way ANOVA\nwith post-hoc tests looking only at main effects. The results of a General Linear Model (GLM)\nanalysis (not shown) suggested no substantial interaction effects between the various condi-\ntions and we therefore focus here on main effects in the context of the hypothesized mediation.\nTo this end, after looking at means, we conducted a more detailed analysis using the PROCESS\nmacro for testing simple mediation [75]. PROCESS is well-established add-on to statistical\npackages such as SPSS that uses ordinary linear regression to estimate direct and indirect rela-\ntionships and test for mediation. It can also be used to probe interactions. We ran this media-\ntion model (with 1,000 bootstrap samples) four times to obtain estimates of both direct and\nindirect effects associated with having each type of organization involved in the partnership.\nBootstrapping allows for the calculation of confidence intervals for indirect effects. These con-\nfidence intervals can be used to assess the statistical significance, something not possible in\nolder approaches to assessing mediation such as those popularized by Baron and Kenny [76].\nMediation analyses such as these cannot confirm that fairness perceptions cause legitimacy\nperceptions, but the ordering is consistent with the underlying literature. Both variables are\nalso treated as continuous variables for the purpose of linear modeling and, as the independent\nvariables are dichotomous, the provided coefficients can be understood as the effect of includ-\ning that partner in the partnership on the dependent variable. We include the PROCESS analy-\nses as the primary assessment of the degree to which the results are at least consistent with our\nhypotheses and research questions.\nAdditional ways of analyzing the data (e.g., including a measure for the number of partners,\nor a measure for the number of non-industry partners in a regression model, not shown) simi-\nlarly provided little additional explanatory power. Also, as noted above, we focus here on the\nseparate main effect of each potential collaborator in the research partnership on both per-\nceived procedural fairness and, ultimately, perceived legitimacy. Using Mplus 7, we also per-\nformed structural equation modeling (SEM) using latent variables for perceived procedural\nfairness and perceived legitimacy. These SEM results--which are displayed in \"S2 Table\"--are\nsimilar to PROCESS analyses.\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nResults\nTable 1 reports post hoc analyses associated with an initial one-way, between-subjects\nANOVA for Study 1. The one way ANOVA test for main effects found that there were statisti-\ncally significant but somewhat small differences in main effect between the various types of\npartnerships, both for perceived procedural fairness of the research process [F(511, 14) = 6.90,\nTable 1 provides the results of post-hoc Tukey HSD tests for the perceived procedural fair-\nness comparisons and the results of Games-Howell tests for the perceived legitimacy compari-\nsons. We used two different tests to assess pairwise differences between the various conditions\nbecause Levene tests suggested equal variances between conditions for the perceived proce-\ndural fairness variable [F(511, 14) = .80, p = .67] but unequal variances for the perceived legiti-\nKellogg's in a research partnership investigating the health effects of small amounts of transfats\nin foods decreases both perceived procedural fairness and perceived legitimacy of the proposed\nresearch. Indeed, the partnerships with the eight lowest means for perceived procedural fair-\nness and for perceived legitimacy each include Kellogg's. The impacts of the inclusion of other\npartners are less clear in Table 1, though it does appear that partnerships including the UCS\nare perceived as fairer and more legitimate than partnerships that do not include the NGO.\nTable 2 presents the results of the PROCESS mediation model for Study 1. Such models are\nbased on Ordinary Least Squares regression but include two parts; the first part involves pre-\ndicting the initial outcome that is hypothesized as the mediator (perceived procedural fairness,\nin this case) and the second part involves predicting the outcome that is the ultimate depen-\ndent variable (perceived legitimacy, in this case). In both cases, the estimates can be under-\nstood as unstandardized regression coefficients. The PROCESS macro then also provides a\ncalculation of the overall direct relationship between the various independent variables and\nthe indirect effect that is accounted for through the mediator with bootstrapping used to pro-\nvide 95% confidence intervals in the absence of a statistical test for indirect effects. Statistical\nsignificance for the indirect effects, in this regard, can thus be understood as confidence inter-\nvals that do not include zero.\nOverall the Study 1 model explains 15% of the variation in perceived procedural fairness\nand 42% of the variation in perceived legitimacy. These results, more than the mean compari-\nsons, clearly convey the effect of including Kellogg's in a research partnership investigating the\nhealth effects of small amounts of transfats in foods. Including Kellogg's leads to an almost\n1-unit decrease in the 7-unit scale for perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1a). The test\nof indirect effects in the bottom part of Table 2 shows that the inclusion of Kellogg's has a sta-\ntistically significant negative indirect effect on perceived legitimacy through its negative effect\non perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1b).\nFurther, including the UCS in a partnership leads to a 0.41-unit increase in perceived pro-\ncedural fairness (RQ2a). This inclusion also has a positive effect on perceived legitimacy via\nthe indirect, positive path through perceived procedural fairness (RQ2b). Including Purdue\nUniversity in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on either perceived procedural\nfairness or perceived legitimacy, offering no support to H2a and H2b, respectively. Also,\nincluding the CDC in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on perceived proce-\ndural fairness (RQ1a), but it does have a positive, direct effect on perceived legitimacy (RQ1b).\nOverall, Study 1 clearly supports H1a and H1b. Including a private sector representative in\na research partnership decreases the extent to which people perceive the collaboration as pro-\ncedurally fair. Further, the pattern of results is consistent with the idea that this negative\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nimpact may reduce the extent to which people perceive the research results as a legitimate\nsource of knowledge for use in their lives. Of course, these results may somewhat be an artifact\nof the particular issue we examined in Study 1. To allay such concern, we conducted a second,\nnearly identical experiment that focused on a different health science issue.\nFor Study 2, we chose to focus on the health impacts of genetically modified (GM) food. Indus-\ntry funding of GM food research has received considerable public attention (e.g., [6]). Further,\nscience and risk communication scholars [77] are devoting more attention to the topic, even\napplying procedural justice scholarship to understand public perceptions [57]. To aim for\nwider generalizability across Studies 1 and 2, we further clarified that the proposed research on\nGM food would investigate possible positive health impacts of new GM grains (e.g., rice,\nwheat, corn) that are being designed to absorb less toxic substances from the soil than do cur-\nrent grains. \"S2 Text Stimulus.\" This focus on the potential positive health impacts of GM food\nin Study 2 may tap different dynamics than does the focus on the potential negative health\nimpacts of small amounts of transfats in food in Study 1.

Overall this\nmodel explains 9% of the variation in perceived procedural fairness and 61% of the variation\nin perceived legitimacy. These results of the PROCESS mediation model clearly convey the\neffect of including Kellogg's in a research partnership investigating GM grains. Including Kel-\nlogg's leads to a 0.73-unit decrease in perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1a). The test\nof indirect effects in the bottom part of Table 2 suggests that the inclusion of Kellogg's has a\nstatistically significant negative indirect effect on perceived legitimacy through its negative\neffect on perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1b).\nAs in Study 1, including the UCS in a partnership leads to an increase in perceived proce-\ndural fairness (RQ2a). The results are again consistent with a potential positive effect of this\npartner on perceived legitimacy via the indirect, positive path through perceived procedural\nfairness (RQ2b). Including Purdue in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on\neither perceived procedural fairness or perceived legitimacy, offering no support to H2a and\nH2b, respectively. While including a governmental agency (the CDC) in a partnership has a\npositive, direct effect on perceived legitimacy (RQ1b) in Study 1, it does not have such an effect\nin Study 2 (the FDA).\nThe results of Study 2 largely confirm those of Study 1, increasing our confidence in the pat-\nterns we have found. Given the size and consistency of this effect, we conducted a third experi-\nment to gather some qualitative data to better understand why subjects perceive the inclusion\nof a private sector partner with such skepticism.\nMethods\nAs with studies 1 and 2, the Institutional Review Board of the Human Research Protection\nProgram at Michigan State University approved this research (IRB#x15-167e)(exempt).\nStudy 3 used the same transfats stimulus and between-subjects design with 15 randomly\nassigned conditions as in Study 1. After providing consent in the same manner as in Studies 1\nand 2, subjects read their assigned description of a proposed partnership to examine the effects\nof small amounts of transfats in foods and answered the same three comprehension questions\nas used in Study 1. The remainder of the experiment simply asked subjects to respond to three\nopen-ended questions about the partnership and its research. Below, we describe the results of\na content analysis of responses to the following question.\nPlease share your views about the nature of the proposed research partnership itself. In\nyour answer, please address the following. What are the strengths and limitations of the pro-\nposed partnership? Please fully explain your answer, including any positive or negative\nthoughts you have about any specific partners.\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nThe other two questions addressed perceived impacts of the research and the types of activi-\nties the respondent thought might help mitigate potential problems and were meant to assist\nwith future research. These are not addressed here.\nWe administered our experiment via Qualtrics to adult U.S. residents we recruited via\nAMT with a HIT titled \"Answer a Few Questions about a Proposed Scientific Partnership.\"\nfor completing the experiment, which took slightly less than eight minutes on average. After\nexcluding subjects who participated in Study 1, our final sample includes 222 subjects who\nprovided correct answers to three comprehension questions. That is, they (a) knew that food\nproducers use transfats to give food softer texture, (b) knew that the described study would\nexamine if small amounts of transfats are unhealthy, and (c) correctly identified the presence\nor absence of Kellogg's in the proposed partnership.\nA co-author well-experienced in qualitative research performed the qualitative data analy-\nsis. Given that our specific objective (to better understand why inclusion of a private sector\npartner engendered heightened skepticism) was fairly straightforward and the data structure\n(brief responses to a single open-ended question) was relatively simple, we decided that multi-\nple coders were unnecessary. Our co-author employed an inductive coding scheme to analyze\nresponses to the italicized question above. First, he read all the responses, coding them for the\npresence or absence of negative, positive, and/or neutral comments. In doing so, he also identi-\nfied 13 substantive themes that emerged from subjects' responses [78]. With this list of poten-\ntial themes, he then re-read all the responses and coded them for the presence or absence of\neach substantive theme. Approximately 11% of responses contained no theme, nearly 49%\ncontained just one, about 35% contained only two, and approximately 6% contained three\nthemes. Below, we report and discuss those seven substantive themes appearing in at least 10%\nof responses.\nTable 3.

When the proposed partnership included Kellogg's,\nment, and 4% (5) remained neutral with neither a clearly positive nor clearly negative comment.\nWhen the proposed partnership did not include Kellogg's, only 28% (29) of responses included\na negative comment, 79% (81) of responses included a positive comment, and 9% (9) of\nresponses remained neutral. The rather large difference in the percentage of negative responses\nacross the two subsamples (48%) generally confirms the patterns revealed in Studies 1 and 2.\nTable 4 reports the most prevalent themes--with italicized illustrative examples--about the\nproposed partnership that emerged from our content analysis. The percentages in Table 4 sum\nto more than 100, since subjects' responses may contain more than one theme.\nWith Kellogg's as a partner. Three major themes emerged from responses by subjects\nexposed to partnerships including Kellogg's. Almost 70% of these subjects noted that Kellogg's\nis so problematic as a partner that its mere inclusion may call the entire partnership into ques-\ntion. The presence of Kellogg's in the partnership provoked distrust and skepticism among\nmany subjects. Indeed, when these subjects mentioned both positive and negative aspects of\nthe partnership, the positives nearly always referred to partners or features other than Kel-\nlogg's, and the negatives nearly always referred to Kellogg's. Some assumed that Kellogg's\nwould likely try to skew the research results to their private interests and/or conceal undesir-\nable results. Kellogg's was described as \"clearly,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"incredibly,\" and\n\"strongly\" biased with an \"ulterior motive,\" \"profit motive,\" \"vested financial interest,\" and\n\"conflict of interest.\"\nAlmost one-third of responses (30%) claimed that other groups in the partnership might\nprovide at least some checks on the financial influence and possibly dubious activities of Kel-\nlogg's. These subjects believed that non-Kellogg's partners would add scientific credibility and\nhonesty to the research, while reducing the likelihood that Kellogg's bias would influence\nmethods and results. Subjects sometimes expected, and at other times merely hoped, that this\nwould be the case. Generally, subjects seemed more confident in Purdue's ability to counter-\nbalance Kellogg's influence than in the abilities of the CDC or UCS to do so. Indeed, a few sub-\njects even acknowledged that other partners (notably, the CDC) may be easily manipulated by\nKellogg's.\nFinally, about one-fourth of subjects (27%) mentioned that the partnership was at least\nminimally good, even if giving reservations. These responses described the partnership as\n\"good,\" \"great,\" \"worthwhile,\" \"strong,\" and \"balanced.\" They noted that the diverse member-\nship of organizations working together would bring different interests and points of view\ntogether to strengthen the resulting research.\nWithout Kellogg's as a partner. Four major themes emerged from the responses of sub-\njects exposed to partnerships not including Kellogg's. The most prevalent theme, found in 67%\nof responses, was that the partnership was at least somewhat good--as illustrated by responses\ncalling the partnership \"a very good idea,\" \"fruitful,\" \"very beneficial,\" \"greatly beneficial,\" and\n\"great.\" Several subjects voiced the adage that \"more heads are better than one,\" noting that\nmultiple partners assure thoroughness and that partnerships can often achieve greater\nadvances than when just one actor goes it alone. Overall, a good number of responses con-\nveyed the expectation that the partnership would produce important, reliable, and useful\nresults that would improve our understanding of the health risks of transfats.\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nApproximately one-fourth of subjects (25%) explicitly noted that the partners seemed\nimmune to outside influence and had little or no conflict of interest or bias. Subjects claimed\nthat the partners seem \"fairly objective,\" \"like relatively neutral parties,\" and \"an unbiased\ngroup\" with no clear agenda. Key here seemed to be the perception of no obvious interests in\nthe outcome of the research, since the partners were not funded or employed by food compa-\nnies. Because of this, subjects expected that the research would be performed in \"an honest\nand unbiased manner.\"\nOn the other hand, a third theme (found in 17% of responses) expressed concern about\npotential conflict of interest or bias. Subjects conveyed either general concerns about the\nbroad influence of money or the potential for one partner to dominate another, or they\nfocused more specifically on the potential financial conflicts of interests of individual scientists.\nYet, a final theme (found in 12% of responses) claimed that the differences between the\nTable 4. Most prevalent themes (and illustrative examples) about the proposed partnership to study\nthe negative health impacts of low levels of transfats in food.\nWhen the Partnership includes Kellogg's (N = 120) % Mentioning\nKellogg's Is a Problematic Partner\n[I]t seems that [Kellogg's] may have an incentive to skew results to maximize their profits.\n[Kellogg's has] a vested interest in the outcome so the results would be completely invalid in\nmy eyes.. . . just the fact that a food company is involved makes me think of the tobacco\nindustry and all that corruption.\nThe Non-Kellogg's Partners May Provide At Least Some Checks on Kellogg's\nInclusion of a food company that has a vested financial interest in the result is a pretty big\nlimitation on the validity of the results. On the other hand, [UCS] and CDC might provide a\nreasonable check and balance. . .Kellogg's. . . has a vested interest in being able to continue\nto use transfats. The other 3 organizations involved do not have the same financial incentive\nand thus will hopefully help balance out this bias.\nThe Partnership Is At Least Somewhat Good\nI believe this would be a good partnership. This would provide different sides to the research\nso an unbiased result can be made.\nOverall it looks like a strong partnership.\nWhen the Partnership Does Not Include Kellogg's (N = 102) % Mentioning\nThe Partnership Is At Least Somewhat Good\nThe partnership includes a wide variety of interests. I believe that conflicts of interest can be\navoided because of this.\nIt sounds like a good unbiased partnership. The 3 partners have nothing to gain from the\nresults of the study and 1 is a government group.\nThe Partnership Has Little or No Conflict of Interest or Bias\nI see no conflict of interest or any reason to believe (at this time) that their study would be\nconducted in any way other than in an honest and unbiased manner.\nThe strengths would be that fair research would be done without conflict of interest.\nConcern about Potential or Future Conflict of Interest or Bias\nThere is always a chance that there may be a (monetary) conflict of interest with some of\nthe scientist involved. Unfortunately money is the root of all BAD studies.\nWhile I like the partnership between academia and the federal government I am still\nconcerned that there may or may not be an \"agenda\" or pre-conceived results desired from\nthis study.\nThe Partners' Differences Will Balance Out\nI don't think any institution or government agency or scientist can be trusted anymore to\nmake any claims without political interest. Maybe by combining them, there can be some\nbalance.\nThe strengths would be that scientists from different organizations would be coming\ntogether, which would hopefully expand expertise and decrease any conflicts of interest.\nNote: Percentages sum to more than 100, since subjects may mention more than one theme in their\nresponses.\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\npartners would balance out and their different points of view would likely neutralize any\npotential conflicts of interest or bias. Such subjects argued that one or more partners would\nserve as a counterbalance to any pressure another partner would potentially assert to bias the\nmethods or results.\nConclusion\nPrivate industry now dominates U.S. R&D funding [1], and university scientists are under\nincreasing pressure to seek non-government funding and participate in public-private partner-\nships with private sector representatives [2\u00ad4]. Yet, much research has documented that in\nsome cases industry-funded research may be less than credible, especially where the risk of reg-\nulation is nontrivial (e.g., [8, 9, 11, 79]). Further, public skepticism of industry-funded\nresearch--heightened by revelations about bias in such work--may likely constrain the effi-\ncacy and influence of its results (e.g., [5, 6]).\nWe performed three experiments to investigate public perception of industry-funded\nresearch. Building upon efforts to adapt procedural justice scholarship to the study of health\nand risk communication (e.g., [57, 59, 80]), we drew insights from procedural justice research\nto examine how the inclusion of an industry partner in a scientific collaboration influences the\nperceived procedural fairness of the partnership and the perceived legitimacy of the resulting\nresearch.\nWe found fairly consistent results across Studies 1 and 2. In both experiments, including\nKellogg's in a scientific partnership indirectly decreased perceived legitimacy of the partner-\nship's research via its negative effect on the perceived procedural fairness of the partnership.\nAlso in both experiments, including an NGO (UCS) in a scientific partnership indirectly\nincreased perceived legitimacy via its positive effect on perceived procedural fairness. Neither\nthe inclusion of Purdue University nor the inclusion of a government agency (the CDC or the\nFDA) in the scientific partnership had a consistent effect on perceived procedural fairness or\nperceived legitimacy across both studies.\nThe results of Study 3 provided qualitative insights for better understanding the negative\neffect of including Kellogg's on both the perceived procedural fairness and perceived legiti-\nmacy of the scientific partnership. Subjects exposed to a scientific partnership including Kel-\nlogg's were nearly three times more likely to offer a negative comment about the partnership\nthan were subjects exposed to a scientific partnership not including Kellogg's. The former\ngroup of subjects expressed deep concern that Kellogg's financial interests would lead it to\nskew the results of the partnership in ways favorable for the company. Although some subjects\nhoped that including other actors--whether research universities, government agencies, or\nNGOs--in the partnership might reduce this potential for bias, few reported with confidence\nthat this would actually happen. In contrast, when Kellogg's was not included in the partner-\nship, subjects generally believed that the resulting research would be conducted fairly.\nWe end by briefly outlining an agenda for moving this scholarship forward. First, additional\nresearch should aim to replicate this study to more completely assess the consistency and gen-\neralizability of our results. Such future research could (a) explore a wider array of substantive\nareas (e.g., environmental impacts associated with new technologies, health impacts of indus-\ntrial chemicals, effectiveness of drugs or supplements), (b) consider different kinds of potential\nresearch partners, and (c) examine whether it matters what the partnership ultimately finds.\nProcedural justice scholarship could provide additional insight here inasmuch as past results\nsuggest that people may discount results they disagree with if they learn about these results\nbefore learning about the processes that lead to the results [47]. Another important avenue of\nresearch would (d) involve considering additional procedures (e.g., independent advisory\nPerceived conflict of interest in health partnerships\nboards, transparency tools, etc.), beyond partnerships, that organizations might use either on\ntheir own or in combination. Also, as noted above, it may be worth considering additional\nwork related to the question of interactions between partners or the effects of adding multiple\npartners. As noted, we conducted initial analyses on these types of questions using the data\nhere, but ultimately we decided to focus on the main effects of each partner. We saw little evi-\ndence that the combinations mattered, and it therefore made more sense to us to focus on the\nmost parsimonious model for this initial study. However, this should not be taken as strong\nevidence that it does not make sense to consider partnership combinations both for research\nand in real life.\nSecond, given the sizable contribution of industry funding to scientific research in the U.S.\nand especially if additional studies replicate our results, future multidisciplinary work should\ninvestigate historical and contemporary efforts to implement procedures that aim to reduce\nconflicts of interest due to industry involvement. This may include both historical and socio-\nlogical research into what organizations have done or are doing, as well as potentially identify-\ning the additional procedures (or combinations of procedures) that might be tried. Insights\nfrom procedural justice scholarship may further guide this research. For example, those inter-\nested in the cognitive mechanisms behind fairness perceptions could test, for example, whether\ncommunicating about conflict of interest mitigation procedures are more effective when sub-\njects are forced to think heuristically or when they are more uncertain about the underlying\ntopics (e.g., [81]).\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.
