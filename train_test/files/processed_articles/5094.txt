After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the left kidneys were collected and analyzed by\nhistology, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,\nradioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nResults: As compared to the sham group, mice that underwent UUO surgery developed more severe tubular injury\nand interstitial fibrosis, as well as higher expression of fibronectin (FN), collagen-1 (Col-1) and -smooth muscle actin\n(-SMA). Also, we observed higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) while lower expression of\nangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), higher levels of intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) while lower levels of intrarenal\nangiotensin-(1\u00ad7), and higher expression of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) and phosphorylation of Smad3\n(p-Smad3) in the obstructed kidneys. Impressively, these pathologic changes were significantly attenuated in the mice\ngroup of UUO treated with exendin-4.\nConclusion: Our present study indicates for the first time that exendin-4 exerts renoprotective effects in an experimental\nmodel of UUO, partly through regulating the balance of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and then inhibiting the\nAng II-mediated TGF-1/Smad3 signaling pathway.\n",

Further, numerous studies show that\na considerable proportion of CKD patients will eventually\ndevelop end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death,\nhighlighting the need for better prevention and manage-\nment for CKD.1,2 Interstitial fibrosis, characterized by\nexcessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-\nteins in the tubulointerstitial compartment, is thought to\nbe the common final pathway of all forms of CKD, whose\nleading cause is diabetic nephropathy.3,4 Therefore, it is\nmandatory to develop rational strategies aiming at inter-\nstitial fibrosis to combat the progression of CKD.\nEffects of exendin-4 on the intrarenal\nrenin-angiotensin system and interstitial\nfibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction\nmice: Exendin-4 and unilateral ureteral\nobstruction\nYing Le, Zongji Zheng, Junyu Xue, Mengling Cheng,\nMeiping Guan and Yaoming Xue\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin II, exendin-4, intrarenal renin-\nangiotensin system, TGF-1/Smad3, unilateral ureteral obstruction\nDepartment of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Nanfang Hospital,\nSouthern Medical University, China\nY.L., Z.Z. and J.X. contributed equally to this study.\nCorresponding author:\nYaoming Xue, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Nanfang\nHospital, affiliate to Southern Medical University, Guangdong, 510515,\nChina.\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nAlthough the exact mechanism of CKD is not yet fully\nelucidated, accumulating evidence has pointed to the criti-\ncal role of excessive activation of the intrarenal renin-\nangiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of CKD.5\u00ad7\nAmong this fascinating system, angiotensin II (Ang II) is\nthe most powerful biologically active component and\nconsidered to be a central mediator of interstitial\nfibrosis.5,8,9 However, our recognition of the RAS has\nbecome more convoluted since the discovery of a novel\nenzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\nverting enzyme (ACE) and mediates the degradation of\nAng II to angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) (Ang-(1\u00ad7)), acting in a coun-\nterregulatory manner to ACE.6,7 Therefore, the balance\nbetween the two enzymes affects the production and accu-\nmulation of Ang II. Considerable research has observed\nthat the high expression of ACE as well as low expression\nof ACE2 results in excessive accumulation of intrarenal\nAng II, which plays a detrimental role in kidney dis-\neases.10\u00ad12 Overall, the above findings support the idea\nthat restoring the balance between ACE and ACE2 and\nhence decreasing the level of intrarenal Ang II may serve\nas a target for CKD treatment.\nExendin-4, a glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1) analog,\nwas originally isolated from the venom of the Gila mon-\nster lizard (Heloderma suspectum).13 Nowadays, synthetic\nexendin-4 has been widely used in the treatment of\npatients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, many studies\nhave indicated that exendin-4 exerts renoprotective effects\nthrough various mechanisms in addition to the control of\nglucose homeostasis.14\u00ad18 However, until now, it has been\nunclear whether exendin-4 modified the activity of the\nintrarenal RAS as part of the underlying mechanisms for\nrenoprotection.\nTherefore, the present study was designed to explore\nthe possibility that exendin-4 attenuates interstitial fibrosis\nby regulating the balance of the intrarenal RAS and then\ninhibiting the Ang II-mediated transforming growth factor\n1 (TGF-1)/Smad3 signaling pathway. We examined the\neffect of exendin-4 on a mouse model of unilateral ureteral\nobstruction (UUO), an excellent model to study the\npathogenesis of CKD without underlying hypertensive and\ndiabetic conditions.\nMaterial and methods\nAnimals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with\nthe guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Committee at the\nSouthern Medical University. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice\n(weighing 20 to 25 g each) were randomly divided into four\ngroups, which consisted of a sham group (n = 6), a sham\ntreated with exendin-4 group (n = 6), a UUO group (n = 8)\nand a UUO treated with exendin-4 group (n = 6). The UUO\nmodel was established under intraperitoneal pentobarbital-\ninduced anesthesia. Then the left ureter was visualized via a\nflank incision and ligated with 4-0 silk. The sham operation\nwas performed identically but without ureter ligation. Mice\nreceived an intraperitoneal injection of either exendin-4\n(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a dose of 36 ug/kg per day or vehi-\ncle, respectively. After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the\nleft kidneys were collected for further analysis.\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR)\nTotal RNA was obtained from renal cortex tissues using\nTRIzol Reagent (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and then was used to\nsynthesize the complementary DNA(cDNA) using M-MLV\nReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).\nQuantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7500\nReal-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA, USA). The primers used are listed in Table 1.\nWestern blot\nWestern blot analysis was performed as described previ-\nously.19 Briefly, equal amounts of proteins were electro-\nphoresed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotransferred to\npolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck\nTable 1.

After blocking with 5% non-fat dry\nmilk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in\nTris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for one hour,\nthe membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C with gentle shaking\novernight with each of the antibodies listed in Table 2.\nThen the membranes were washed three times for 10 min-\nutes with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxi-\ndase-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR, NE,\nUSA) for one hour. The bands were visualized with\nOdyssey infrared scanning (LI-COR) and densitometry\nwas performed using Gel-Pro32 software.\nHistological and immunohistochemical analysis\nThe kidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.\nSamples were embedded in paraffin and then cut into\nslices with a thickness of 4 um. Hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E) (Leagene, Beijing, China) and Masson's trichrome\n(Maixin, Fuzhou, China) stain kit were used to assess mor-\nphological changes and degree of interstitial fibrosis,\nrespectively. Immunohistochemical staining was per-\nformed to assess the renal tissue protein expression of\nfibronectin (FN), collagen-1 (Col-1), -smooth muscle\nactin (-SMA), ACE and ACE2 as previously described.19\nAll sections were observed under an Olympus B\u00d740 pho-\ntomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Five randomly\nselected cortical fields per mouse were assessed using\nImage Pro-plus 6.0 software.\nRadioimmunoassay (RIA)\nKidney amounts of Ang II were measured with an Iodine\n[125I] Angiotensin II Radioimmunoassay kit (Beijing North\nInstitute of Biological Technology, Beijing, China) accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nThe concentration of Ang-(1\u00ad7) was determined using a\nBiotech). Each sample contained the same amount of pro-\ntein and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an\nEL\u00d7800 microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nAll results were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard devia-\ntion (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS\nsoftware version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nThe comparison of values between groups was measured\nby one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by\na least-significant difference (LSD) or a Dunnett's T3\npost hoc test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nEffect of exendin-4 on pathological changes of\nthe obstructed kidneys\nAs seen in Figure 1(a), H&E staining revealed normal\narchitecture of tubules in the sham group and severe\ntubular injury in the UUO group. In contrast, exendin-4\ntreatment significantly reduced tubular injury of the\nobstructed kidneys as compared to the UUO mice.\nMasson's trichrome staining also showed that UUO mice\ndeveloped more interstitial fibrosis compared with the\nsham group. However, interstitial fibrosis was signifi-\ncantly attenuated by exendin-4 treatment compared with\nUUO mice (Figure 1(b)).\nEffect of exendin-4 on messenger RNA (mRNA)\nexpression of FN, Col-1 and -SMA\nAs shown in Figure 2, the obstructed kidneys in the UUO\ngroup exhibited increased mRNA levels of FN, Col-1 and\n-SMA as compared to the sham mice with or without\nexendin-4 treatment (p < 0.01). However, exendin-4 treat-\nment significantly reduced the mRNA expression of FN\nTable 2.

Immunohistochemical staining\nresults revealed that UUO caused a marked increase in\nkidney cortical expression of FN, Col-1 and -SMA\ncompared with sham mice. In contrast, mice treated with\nexendin-4 exhibited less ECM protein expression com-\npared with the obstructed kidneys (Figure 3(a) to (d)). In\naccordance with the immunohistochemistry results,\nstudies by Western blot analyses further confirmed the\nabove results. The protein expression level of -SMA\nwas also reduced in the UUO treated with exendin-4\ngroup compared with the UUO group, although the dif-\nference did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05)\n(Figure 3(e) and (f)).\nEffect of exendin-4 on mRNA expression of\nACE and ACE2\nNext, we evaluated the effect of exendin-4 on mRNA\nexpression of ACE and ACE2. As shown in Figure 4, a\nsignificantly increased concentration of ACE mRNA\nwas detected in the obstructed kidneys of UUO mice\ncompared with the control sham kidneys (p < 0.05).\nConsistent with an increase in ACE mRNA level, the\nmRNA expression level of ACE2 was reduced in the\nobstructed kidneys, although this did not reach statistical\nsignificance compared with the control sham kidneys\n(p > 0.05). Notably, exendin-4 administration restored\nthe imbalance between ACE and ACE2 mRNA\nFigure 1.

However, these changes were\nsignificantly attenuated in the obstructed kidneys by\ntreatment with exendin-4 (Figure 5(a) to (c)). The results\nof Western blot analyses were consistent with the above\nfindings (Figure 5(d) and (e)).\nEffect of exendin-4 on intrarenal Ang II and\nIntrarenal Ang II and Ang-(1\u00ad7) levels were measured\nwith the expectation that they would reflect the imbalance\nin ACE and ACE2 expression observed in the kidneys.\nTherefore, we explored the kidney levels of Ang II and\nAng-(1\u00ad7) and then evaluated the effect of exendin-4 on\nintrarenal Ang II and Ang-(1\u00ad7) levels as shown in Figure\n6. Compared with the control sham kidneys, significantly\nhigher levels of intrarenal Ang II and lower levels of Ang-\n(1\u00ad7) (p < 0.01) were detected in obstructed kidneys of\nUUO mice. Interestingly, treatment of UUO mice with\nexendin-4 caused a significant reduction in intrarenal Ang\nII levels compared with mice in the UUO group (p < 0.05),\nwhereas renal Ang-(1\u00ad7) levels were elevated in response\nto exendin-4 treatment, although this increase did not\nreach statistical significance (p > 0.05).\nEffect of exendin-4 on TGF-1/Smad3 signaling\npathway in UUO mice kidneys\nSubsequently, we explored whether enhanced interstitial\nfibrosis in the UUO kidneys was associated with an upreg-\nulation of TGF-1 as well as the phosphorylation of Smad3\nlevels (p-Smad3) and whether exendin-4 could inhibit\np-Smad3 in UUO kidneys. As shown in Figure 7, both\nmRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-1 were sig-\nnificantly higher in obstructed kidneys than those in con-\ntrol mice (p < 0.05). Moreover, p- Smad3 in renal tissue\nwas significantly increased in UUO mice compared with\nsham controls (p < 0.01). Treatment with exendin-4 sig-\nnificantly inhibited TGF-1 as well as p-Smad3.\nDiscussion\nOur data provide compelling evidence for the first time\nthat exendin-4 attenuates interstitial fibrosis partially by\nregulating the balance between intrarenal ACE and ACE2\nand then inhibiting the Ang II-mediated TGF-1/Smad3\nsignaling pathway.\nUUO is the most-used animal model to represent the\nmain pathological feature of CKD. Concretely, it is char-\nacterized by tubular cell injury, recruitment of interstitial\ninflammatory cells, proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts\nand increased deposition of ECM proteins. Among them,\ntubular epithelial cells differentiate into myofibroblasts\nin the obstructed kidneys and the activated interstitial\nfibroblasts are responsible for the increased synthesis of\n-SMA and ECM proteins.20,21 In our experiments, the\nlevels of -SMA and ECM proteins are effectively ele-\nvated in obstructed kidneys. Furthermore, we have\nobserved severe tubular injury and remarkably increased\ncollagen deposition in the interstitium of obstructed kid-\nneys detected by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining,\nrespectively, suggesting that we have successfully\ninduced the feature of interstitial fibrosis and created the\nexperimental model of CKD.\nAccumulating evidence indicates that discordance of\nACE and ACE2 will lead to higher concentration of intra-\nrenal Ang II, contributing to the development of renal\ninjury. Ye et al. demonstrated that increased ACE with\ndecreased ACE2 was found in the kidney tissues of\nFigure 4.

Additionally, this combination leads to exces-\nsive intrarenal Ang II accumulation detected by RIA,\nwhich may relate to the renal damage in UUO mice.\nAng II plays a pivotal role in renal fibrogenesis. It pro-\nmotes the growth of renal mesangial and tubular cells,\nmodulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and\nincreases the expression and synthesis of ECM proteins\ndepending on multiple fibrotic mediators such as TGF-\n1, connective tissue growth factor, endothelin-1, matrix\nmetalloproteinase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibi-\ntor-1. Among them, Ang II may foster renal fibrosis\nmainly by interactions with TGF-1.5,9 In cultured\nmesangial cells, Ang II could directly stimulate TGF-1\ngene activation through protein kinase C (PKC)- and p38\nmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent\npathways.22 Further, TGF-1 regulates kidney injury pri-\nmarily by Smad3. Deletion of Smad3 from mice amelio-\nrated renal fibrosis in rodent models of obstructive\nnephropathy.23 Additionally, the use of Smad3 inhibitor\nto EMT and renal fibrosis in streptozotocin (STZ)-\ninduced diabetes provided a novel strategy to retard the\nprogression of kidney disease by targeting Smad3 signal-\ning.24 In our experiments, we find that significantly\nhigher levels of intrarenal Ang II as well as the expres-\nsion of TGF-1 and p-Smad3 are detected in obstructed\nkidneys of UUO mice compared with the control sham\nkidneys, which is consistent with previous research.\nExendin-4 is a sound agent for use in the comprehen-\nsive treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\n(T2DM) by high-affinity GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the\npancreas. The first study to explore the renoprotective\neffects of exendin-4 was performed in 2007. It confirmed\nthat eight weeks of exendin-4 treatment inhibited\n8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine excretion and decreased albu-\nminuria in T2DM db/db mice.14 Then studies were under-\ntaken in STZ-induced T1DM models. Kodera et al.\nreported that exendin-4 attenuated kidney injury through\nanti-inflammatory actions without lowering blood glucose\nlevels.15 Mima et al. indicated that exendin-4 induced pro-\ntective actions on the glomerular endothelial cells by\ninhibiting Ang II signaling on c-Raf (Ser259).16 Ojima\net al. investigated the renoprotective effect of exendin-4 by\nblocking the advanced glycation endproduct-receptor for\nadvanced glycation endproduct (AGE-RAGE)-mediated\nasymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) generation.17 Our\ngroup performed an experiment in vitro revealing that\nexendin-4 exerted an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation\nand FN secretion in rat mesangial cells partly through 5'\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.18\nConsistent with previous reports, our study demonstrates\nthat exendin-4 effectively alleviates renal injury in a mouse\nmodel of UUO nephropathy.\nHowever, the mechanisms responsible for improved\nrenal injury after exendin-4 treatment are complex and not\nfully understood. Interestingly, to date, there have been\nmany studies exploring the interactions between GLP-1\nand the RAS. Skov et al. observed GLP-1 significantly\ndecreased circulating concentration of Ang II.25 Moreover,\nit has previously been reported that GLP-1 effectively\nameliorates Ang II-induced hypertension as well as glo-\nBased on all this research, we speculate that inhibition of\nthe intrarenal RAS may be involved in the mechanisms of\nGLP-1-mediated renoprotection. Here, our study discov-\ners that exendin-4 is very effective in restoring the balance\nof the intrarenal RAS in obstructed kidneys by decreasing\nthe expression of ACE and increasing the expression\nof ACE2. Interestingly, treatment of UUO mice with\nexendin-4 causes a significant reduction in intrarenal Ang\nII levels and then inhibits the Ang II-mediated TGF-1/\nSmad3 signaling pathway. To our knowledge, our study is\nthe first to report the ability of exendin-4 to alleviate inter-\nstitial fibrosis resulting from UUO by regulating the bal-\nance between ACE and ACE2 and then inhibiting the Ang\nII-mediated TGF-1/Smad3 signaling pathway.\nIn addition, another interesting finding of our study is\nthat lower levels of Ang-(1\u00ad7) are detected in obstructed\nkidneys of UUO mice compared with the control sham\nkidneys, and intrarenal Ang-(1\u00ad7) levels are elevated in\nresponse to exendin-4 treatment, although this increase did\nnot reach statistical significance. To date, it has been\nreported that Ang-(1\u00ad7) may have renoprotective proper-\nfibrosis in UUO mice needs to be confirmed in future\nresearch. Another limitation of the current study is that we\nhave demonstrated mechanisms described only in animal\nmodels of UUO and are unable to provide direct evidence\nof exendin-4 on the intrarenal RAS.\nIn conclusion, using the UUO as a model of CKD, for\nthe first time we demonstrate that the changes in the expres-\nsion of ACE and ACE2 in obstructed kidneys, the altera-\ntions in the levels of Ang II and Ang-(1\u00ad7), and the onset of\nrenal fibrosis can be reversed by exendin-4 administration.\nWe present a novel strategy to balance the activities of ACE\nand ACE2, thus suppressing the activated Ang II-mediated\nTGF-1/Smad3 signaling. Our results suggest that the intra-\nrenal RAS has become a more promising antifibrotic target\nof GLP-1R agonists.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis work was supported by research grants from the National\n10 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nand the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong (grant num-\nReferences\n1.
