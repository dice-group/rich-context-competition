We searched electronic databases for\npertinent studies reporting outcomes from interventions from January 2000 to March 2015 and\nupdated searches in October 2016. We included studies that considered behavioural and psy-\nchological symptom management for older people living with dementia who live at home and\nexcluded studies conducted in long-term care settings.

It is important to consider family carer read-\niness to use non-pharmacological strategies and to develop a shared language about the inherent\nneeds and communications of behavioural and psychological symptoms.\n",

These symptoms may result in distress, increased service use and an unwanted\nWhilst the term `challenging behaviour' incorporates other terms used previously such\nas behavioural disturbance, problematic behaviours, behavioural problems and difficult or\ndistressing behaviour (Krishnamoorthy & Anderson, 2011), the term BPSD is still widely\nused in clinical settings and research (Kales, Gitlin, & Lyketsos, 2015). It is conceptually\nlinked to challenging behaviour, as these symptoms often result in behaviour that presents\nothers with challenges. It is important to stress that the presence of a range of symptoms\nand behaviours that are hard to manage for family carers and practitioners alike are\ninvariably a way that the person with dementia communicates unmet needs (James &\nSymptoms include depression, psychosis, aggression, wandering or walking, agitation,\napathy and emotional distress. These can limit the ability to sustain everyday activities and\nreduce quality of life (QoL) for all those affected (Kales et al., 2015). They can cause or\nexacerbate sleep deprivation, fatigue and eating problems (Manthorpe & Watson, 2003;\nThe National Dementia Strategy in England (Department of Health, 2009) highlighted the\nneed for more community-based personal support, reduced use of antipsychotic medication\nand alternative approaches to the support and management of BPSD. Most research has\nfocused on long-term or mixed settings (Forbes et al., 2009; Livingston, Johnston, Katona,\nvan Weert, & Francke, 2005; Vernooij-Dassen, Draskovic, McCleery, & Downs, 2011;\nWoods, Spector, Jones, Orrell, & Davies, 2005) or on a narrow range of interventions or\nsymptoms (Forrester et al., 2014; Livingston et al., 2014; Orgeta, Qazi, Spector, & Orrell,\n2014; Reilly et al., 2015) and there is limited evidence-based guidance for managing BPSD at\nhome. A rapid systematic overview of BPSD management (Dickson et al., 2012) was limited\nonly to reviews, included many settings and did not evaluate primary studies.\nA recent consensus narrative review of pharmacological and non-pharmacological man-\nagement of BPSD covered various settings but did not employ rigorous systematic review\nmethodology (Tible, Riese, Savaskan, & von Gunten, 2017).\nThis present paper systematically reviews the evidence from randomised controlled trials\n(RCTs) of effectiveness of interventions for BPSD specifically for community dwelling older\npeople living with dementia. An accompanying paper examines studies reporting the views\nand experiences of people living with dementia and their family carers, on managing BPSD\nMethods\nWe invited 25 health and social care practitioners, researchers and carers of people living\nwith dementia to a preliminary stakeholder meeting to gain their perspectives around man-\naging BPSD at home and to inform the focus of the review (how BPSD is defined, search\nterms, challenges for family carers and strategies for support at home). A broad mapping of\nthe literature on BPSD interventions identified studies for inclusion in an in-depth review\nand was followed by a systematic review of included quantitative and qualitative literature.\nOnly evidence from RCTs is reported in this paper. The study protocol is available (Trivedi\net al., 2013). Findings from the review were later discussed with people living with dementia,\nfamily carers and service providers at the end of the study.\nSelection criteria\nWe included English language studies that investigated BPSD management in community-\ndwelling individuals and excluded studies set in long-term care facilities.\nSearch strategy\nStudies were identified by computerised searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo,\nAMED, HMIC, BNI, HEALTH BUSINESS ELITE, Scopus and Web of Knowledge (Web\nof Science). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central\nRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, Economic,\nSystematic reviews, Trials, Method, Techno). We carried out lateral searches (checking\nTrivedi et al. 3\nreference lists and citation searches) and screened several reviews to identify other relevant\nstudies. An example search query from PubMed is presented in Box 1. Searches were\nand October 2016). The broad mapping informed the selection of studies for our in-depth\nsystematic review, through applying additional criteria and assessing the focus of complex\ninterventions and BPSD relevant outcomes.\nScreening for inclusion in systematic review\nAll records from searches were retrieved in Endnote and screened for potential inclusion;\n10% were independently screened by two reviewers. Hard copies of potentially relevant\npapers were further screened, with 20% screened independently. Studies included were\nRCTs describing interventions for BPSD and reporting one or more of the following as\nmain outcomes: BPSD and QoL for people with dementia, and carer burden/strain, distress,\npsychological health and QoL for carers. Secondary outcomes included resource use and\ncosts and processes of care. Uncertainties were resolved by consensus in discussion by the\nresearch team.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nAll quantitative data were extracted into an Excel database, using a pre-piloted data extrac-\ntion tool developed in consultation with our study's lay advisers.

Key outcome and descriptive data for reviewing economic impli-\ncations were extracted independently (HG). Data were extracted by one reviewer, with 70%\nextracted independently by two reviewers for in-depth systematic review. Quality assessment\nwas conducted on all included studies independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane\nrisk of bias tool for RCTs (Higgins & Green, 2011). Categories for seven types of non-\npharmacological interventions were based on a broad classification used in the earlier review\n(Dickson et al., 2012), namely: behavioural, education and training, environmental, multi-\ncomponent, organisational, physical and structured and support types of interventions.\nAnalysis and synthesis\nDue to the heterogeneity of people living with dementia, follow-up periods and their out-\ncomes, an overall meta-analysis was not considered appropriate and data are presented\nnarratively supported by evidence tables. Findings are discussed by categories of interven-\ntion offered to people living with dementia alone, to dyads (people living with dementia and\nfamily carers) and to family carers alone.\nResults\nEvidence mapping\nWe retrieved 17,871 de-duplicated records. Following screening, 301 records were selected\n(all study types) for an initial mapping exercise (Trivedi et al., 2015). Records retrieved and\nscreened for final inclusion of quantitative studies are shown in Figure 1. Non-\npharmacological interventions identified were heterogeneous, with over 50 different formats\nof varying content and duration. A range of different terminologies was used to describe\nBPSD, and the evaluations were based on a variety of different outcomes and instruments.\nThe interventions targeted people living with dementia and family carers, were delivered at\nhome or in community or out-patient settings and were often multi-faceted and multidisci-\nplinary. Many studies addressed symptoms as one component of a complex intervention for\ndementia (including behavioural management, various types of support, education and\ntraining) whilst others did not specifically target BPSD but reported BPSD-relevant findings\nas secondary outcomes. Findings from the analysis of 48 RCTs where BPSD management\nwas one of the components of the intervention and reported BPSD as either a primary or\nsecondary outcome are reported in this paper.\nEvidence synthesis\nDue to the heterogeneity of interventions, outcomes and follow-up, a narrative synthesis\nwas constructed according to the `target' group (interventions offered to people living with\ndementia alone, to dyads (people living with dementia and family carers) and to family\ncarers alone and broad intervention groups and outcomes.\nSeven studies (10 papers) reported evidence on interventions that focused on people living\nwith dementia only, 18 studies (33 papers) on dyads and 23 studies (46 papers) related to\nfamily carers only. Studies took place in the United States (US) (n \u00bc 27), mainland Europe\n(n \u00bc 7), United Kingdom (UK) (n \u00bc 6), Japan (n \u00bc 2), Hong Kong (n \u00bc 3); one report came\nTrivedi et al. 5\nfrom a collaborative UK/US/Australia study, one from Canada and one from a joint\nRussia/Peru study. Most studies targeted the mild-moderate stages of dementia and includ-\ned all dementia types. The quality of the studies was mixed, with 20 having low risk of bias\n(ROB) (5 or more domains of low or good quality); 8 low/unclear risk (4/6 domains of low\nor moderate quality), 15 unclear and 5 at high risk. They used various instruments for\nBPSD-related outcomes, most validated or based on previous research. Less than half the\nstudies reported theoretical frameworks. Details of these and effect sizes are shown in evi-\ndence Tables S1 to S3 (see supplementary tables). Comparison groups mostly included\n`usual care' or interventions that did not include specific components of a complex\nintervention.\nRCT: Randomised controlled trial\nRecords idenfied through\nAddional records idenfied\nthrough other sources:\nRecords aer duplicates removed:\nRecords screened:\nRecords excluded:\nFull-text arcles assessed for\nFull-text arcles excluded\nStudies included in final\nsynthesis:\nFigure 1. PRISMA flow diagram of RCT study selection process.\nRCT: randomised controlled trials.\nInterventions for people with dementia (supplementary evidence Table S1). Interventions for people\nliving with dementia alone are shown in Evidence Table S1. Evidence of the effectiveness of\ninterventions (from seven small studies) was weak with unclear or high risk of bias (overall\nlow quality). Providers and duration of interventions varied and included intensive sessions\nwith trained individual or group therapists with short-term follow-up. Tadaka and\nKanagawa (2007) reported reductions in withdrawal and disorientation in people with vas-\ncular dementia. In another study, participants with mixed dementia in the early stage were\nlikely to engage well in mentally stimulating activities to reduce apathy and depression\nLikewise, multisensory stimulation, such as Snoezelen seemed to help people with dementia\nbe more attentive to environment and improved mood (Baker, Holloway, et al., 2003;\nBaker, Wareing, et al., 2001), but larger studies are required to examine its effect on agita-\ntion in community dwelling older people (Baillon et al., 2004; van Diepen et al., 2002). Other\ninterventions, such as art therapy and multimodal interventions (Taiji, cognitive therapy\nwith support) may reduce apathy and improve QoL (Hattori, Hattori, Hokao, Mizushima,\n& Mase, 2011; Lam, Lui, et al., 2010) and improve mental stability (Burgener, Yang,\nGilbert, & Marsh-Yant, 2008), but larger high-quality studies with longer follow-up are\nrequired to establish effectiveness.\nInterventions for dyads (supplementary evidence Tables S2.1\u00ad2.2). We identified 18 relevant dyadic\ninterventions (targeted at both people living with dementia and family carers) of which only\n10 were of good quality and four were of moderate quality; the interventions are described\nin detail in Table S2.1 and the outcomes in Table S2.2.\nMode of intervention involved individual or group sessions, home or clinic visits or\ntelephone sessions or in combination. The intensity, duration and follow-up varied across\nall studies. The number of sessions of interventions varied from brief (<6 sessions, n \u00bc 5), to\nmedium (around 8\u00ad14 sessions, n \u00bc 10) and long (16 n \u00bc 3); follow-up periods varied from\nshort (6 months, n \u00bc 9) to longer term (>6 months, n \u00bc 9). Duration of interventions\nranged from less than 8 weeks to over 12 months or for duration of the study.\nBehavioural interventions\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. Of four dyadic studies (Burns, Nichols, Martindale-\n2002), one good quality pilot study from the UK reported that cognitive behavioural ther-\napy (CBT) (10 weekly one-hour sessions) can improve anxiety and may be cost neutral\n(Spector, Charlesworth, et al., 2015), although substantial family carer involvement in the\nearlier stages of dementia might be required.\nCarer outcomes. Only one study (with unclear risk of bias) that largely included people living\nwith severe dementia reported improved long-term psychological health for family carers\nbut the study had high attrition (Burns et al., 2003). The intervention included managing\npatient behaviour together with family carer stress management and coping with specific\nbehaviours. Another less intensive programme showed no effect on patient or family carer\nTrivedi et al. 7\nEducation and training\nFour psychosocial education and training interventions ((1) Belle et al., 2006; Nichols et al.,\nincluded.\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. Evidence from two good quality US studies suggests that\ntraining family carers to support people living with dementia's capabilities by reducing\nenvironmental stressors, and enhancing family carers' psychosocial skills, had no effect\non agitation or QoL, but improved engagement and functional dependence at four\nmonths' follow-up, although not in the longer term (Gitlin et al., 2010a). Advancing care-\ngiver training (ACT) to target problem behaviours and potential triggers can improve prob-\nlem behaviour in the short term (Gitlin et al., 2010b).\nCarer outcomes. ACT can also reduce family carer burden and upset (Gitlin et al., 2007;\nGitlin et al., 2010b). Carer readiness to use non-pharmacological strategies predicts BPSD\noutcomes. `Activated' family carers (those actively using intervention strategies) reported\ngreater reduction in distressing behaviours than non-activated participants, although acti-\nvation did not predict family carer burden or well-being (Gitlin & Rose, 2016). These\ninterventions were intensive, used telephone calls for maintenance, and involved `advanced\npractice' nurses and occupational therapists (OTs).\nAnother intervention trained mental health professionals in systematic assessment of\nfamily carers' competencies and in strategies to deal with a range of problems that predict\nmoves to long-term care. There was no effect on any patient or family carer outcomes at 12\nmonths, but results showed family carers treated by professionals adhering to the interven-\ntion protocol had a better sense of competence, suggesting that intensity and adherence can\ninfluence outcomes (Spijker, Teerenstra, et al., 2013; Spijker, Verhey, et al., 2009; Spijker,\nMulticomponent interventions\nTwo good quality studies from the US and Denmark involved multifaceted Alzheimer's\ndisease programmes for dyads, which included home-based exercise with behavioural man-\nagement and multifaceted semi-tailored counselling, information and support programmes,\nrespectively.\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. Intensive behaviour management aiming to improve\npatient\u00adcarer interactions, affect and behavioural distress can improve depression and\nreduce moves to a long-term care facility in people living with moderate to severe dementia\n(Teri et al., 2003). Intensive counselling and support (>12 months) aiming to prevent depres-\nsion in people with mixed dementia types had no effect on behaviours or related QoL in the\nlong term (three years), although participants benefitted in coping, competence and seeking\nCarer outcomes. These interventions had no significant effect on family carer distress, despite\ngood adherence to programme recommendations and family carers reporting better aware-\nness, ability to cope and seeking appropriate support. Cost implications of intensive sessions\nof long duration are unclear.\nOrganisational interventions\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. Of three dyadic studies (Callahan et al., 2006; Chien &\nLee, 2008; Lam, Lee, et al., 2010), one good quality US study suggests that collaborative\ncare planning and delivery using structured behavioural protocols and individualised plans\ntargeting people living with moderate dementia exhibiting symptoms such as repetitive\nbehaviour and aggression can improve BPSD (Callahan et al., 2006) over 18 months. The\nmodel aims to identify, monitor and treat BPSD, through behavioural interventions, edu-\ncation on communication skills, coping skills and lifestyle advice. The 12 months interven-\ntion had a long follow-up and involved a primary care physician and a geriatric nurse\npractitioner.\nCarer outcomes. Reduced family carer depression and improved quality of care were\nreported, with increased clinician visits and increased drugs, but without increasing use of\nantipsychotics (Callahan et al., 2006). In another study (moderate quality), OTs working as\ncase managers improved family carers' psychological health and increased their use of\nexternal support (Lam, Lee, et al., 2010). This involved regular home and out-patient\nvisits and telephone calls over 12 months. The model included mobilisation and optimum\nuse of local services in addition to advice on coping, skills training and behavioural man-\nagement. The strength of these interventions lies in the comprehensive and integrated\napproaches with designated care/case managers and individual targeting of problem\nbehaviours.\nPhysical and structured interventions\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. Of three dyadic studies, one (moderate quality pilot\nstudy) showed that tailored activity programmes (TAP) delivered by OTs (six 90-minute\nhome visits, two telephone sessions over four months) can improve engagement and reduce\nshadowing, repetitiveness and agitation (Gitlin et al., 2008; Gitlin et al., 2009), although a\nlarger trial is required to confirm the reported benefit. There is no evidence from two good\nquality studies that prescribed exercise or sleep therapy is effective for BPSD, although\nbetter adherence can reduce time awake ((1) Cerga-Pashoja et al., 2010; Lowery et al.,\nMcCurry, Logsdon, Gibbons, Vitiello, & Teri, 2003).\nCarer outcomes. TAPs can improve family carer objective burden and skills, with good\nunderstanding of strategies by dyads but larger studies are required (Gitlin et al., 2008).\nSupport interventions\nPerson living with dementia outcomes. One good quality study from UK, US and Australia of\ndyads showed that tailored individual and family counselling for emotional support com-\nbined with drug treatment had no effect on problem behaviours at 24 months. The study\nTrivedi et al. 9\nwas not, however, adequately powered to measure this change (Mittelman, Brodaty,\nCarer outcomes. The intervention reduced family carer depression and distress when the\npeople living with dementia were taking Donepezil. This effect was maintained over two\nyears. The counselling occurred in the first three months and was followed by continuous\navailable telephone counselling on demand over 24 months duration. Although costs are not\nreported, the authors refer to the intervention's costs as `modest'.\nInterventions for family carers alone (supplementary evidence Tables S3.1\u00ad3.2)\nOf 23 studies directed at family carers alone, 10 were of good quality, three were of mod-\nerate quality and the rest were unclear or of low quality. For family carer interventions, the\nnumber of sessions and duration of interventions varied from brief (<6 sessions, n \u00bc 5), to\nmedium (around 8\u00ad14 sessions, n \u00bc 9), to long (16 sessions weeks, n \u00bc 9); and follow-up\nperiods varied from short (6 months, n \u00bc 11) to longer term (>6 months, n \u00bc 12) (Evidence\nTable S3.2 reports studies by intervention whilst Table S3.3 shows outcomes).\nBehavioural interventions\nOne moderate quality study evaluating intensive CBT-based telephone intervention\n(TeleTanDem) focused on managing behavioural problems, promoting competence and\ncoping strategies for challenging behaviour, personality changes of care recipient, enhancing\ncoping skills for reducing social isolation and help with accessing professional and informal\nsupport. This 12-week intervention reduced family carer depression but with no effect on\nQoL. However, it did not specifically target clinically depressed family carers (Schink\nothe &\nEducation and training\nSixteen studies evaluated education and training programmes targeted specifically at family\ncarers. These included six psychoeducational ((de Rotrou et al., 2011), (Gallagher-\nThompson et al., 2003; Gallagher-Thompson, Gray, Dupart, Jimenez, & Thompson,\nGerdner, Buckwalter, & Reed, 2002; Garand, Buckwalter, & Lubaroff, 2002), (Hebert\net al., 2003) and (Martin-Carrasco et al., 2009)), six psychosocial ((Burgio, Stevens, Guy,\nRoth, & Haley, 2003), (Czaja, Loewenstein, Schulz, Nair, & Perdomo, 2013), (Farran et al.,\n2013; Tremont, Davis, Bishop, & Fortinsky, 2008) and (Ulstein, Sandvik, Wyller, &\nEngedal, 2007)) and four other training programmes ((Gavrilova et al., 2009; Guerra,\nFerri, Fonseca, Banerjee, & Prince, 2011), (Hepburn, Tornatore, Center, & Ostwald,\nEvidence from seven good quality family carer studies suggests that psychoeducation\nprogrammes focusing on problem solving techniques, emotion-centred coping (de Rotrou\net al., 2011), enhancing skills in handling disruptive behaviours, cognitive appraisal with\ncoping strategies (Hebert et al., 2003) and identifying triggers, planning to manage as\nsymptoms change and `anticipating' stressful situations (Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2008)\nimprove family carer health including depression, distress and reactions to disruptive behav-\niours. Psychosocial interventions report that enhancing behaviour management skills\nreduced emotional stress related to agitated behaviours over 18 months (Farran et al.,\n2004). The intervention involved 12-weekly sessions (group and individual) with booster\nsessions and `as needed' telephone calls over 12 months.\nIntervention training for community mental health nurses (CMHN) (Moniz-Cook et al.,\n2008) improved coping with problem behaviours, although long interventions are required.\nCMHNs received both group and individual in-service supervision sessions, weekly, fort-\nnightly and then monthly over 18 months. This study suggests that the intervention effect\ndepended on the CMHN who delivered it. Highly accessible, intensive telephone contacts of\nlonger duration between therapists and family carers and potentially low-cost interventions\nto enhance coping reduced family carer depression and improved reactions to care recipient\nbehaviours at six months (Tremont et al., 2014).\nTraining community consultants (master's level healthcare professionals) to teach family\ncarers behavioural management plans was found to improve both behaviours and carer\nburden, depression and reactions to behaviours at six months following a brief intervention\nEnvironmental interventions\nOne good quality US study examining home environment skill-building interventions\n(Gitlin, Corcoran, Winter, Boyce, & Hauck, 2001; Gitlin et al., 2003; Gitlin, Hauck,\nDennis, & Winter, 2005) aimed to help family carers develop a supportive environment\nwhich reduced disruptive behaviours and functional decline. The intervention involved\nintensive training by OTs, home visits and telephone contacts. It reduced family carer\nburden and enhanced carer well-being, sustaining carer affect over a year but was resource\nintensive. More frequent professional contact and ongoing skills training may be necessary\nto maintain other important outcomes such as reduced carer distress in managing problem\nbehaviours. Although the intervention can be adapted to other cultural/ethnic groups, more\nwork is required on level of intensity and on dyad interactions, according to the researchers.\nPeople in the severe stage of dementia are not likely to benefit from this type of intervention,\nin the researchers' view.\nMulti-component interventions\nREACH carer interventions (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health) from\nvarious sites in the US aimed to assist family carers to manage disruptive behaviours in care\nrecipients. They were overall intensive, with long durations and of unclear risk of bias. They\noffered multiple components which included behaviour management, stress-coping mecha-\nnisms, family-based therapy with access to community support, telephone systems and skills\ntraining. Evidence from REACH studies suggests that family therapy using computer-\nmediated automated interactive voice response targeted at culturally different groups in\nfive US sites has the potential to reduce `bother' and upset about BPSD and carer depression\nMahoney, Tarlow, Jones, Tennstedt, & Kasten, 2001). Wives who exhibited low mastery\nand high anxiety benefitted most from the automated telecare intervention. Differential\nresponses to psychosocial interventions according to race and relationship to care recipients\nmay be important (Burgio et al., 2003; Czaja et al., 2013). Although the effects of racial or\nethnic concordance between carers and interventionists on carer depression and burden were\nnot significant, they need to be examined systematically in further studies (McGinnis et al.,\n2006). Offering multiple components with flexibility for participants to choose component,\nfrequency, duration and timing appears to be important. No costs are reported.\nREACH II offered skills training, systematically targeting problem areas, in-home family\ntherapy, access to resources for managing BPSD and engagement with family carers in the\nintervention process (see Evidence Tables S2.1\u00ad2.2, S3.1\u00ad3.2). Whilst it reported positive\nbenefits for family carers from ethnically diverse populations, particularly when outcome\ndomains were closely linked to intervention components (Belle et al., 2006), it was resource\nintensive. However, the intervention significantly reduced family carer hours per day com-\npared with controls at one site (Nichols et al., 2008).\nClinical application and implementation of the REACH II programme in the US\nVeterans health care system resulted in positive family carer benefits (Nichols,\nMartindale-Adams, Burns, Graney, & Zuber, 2011), although REACH studies were of\nmixed quality and involved intensive individualized home visits and telephone sessions.\nThe implementation programme was structured and individualized through risk assessment,\ntargeted education, support and skills training to address family caregiving risk areas of\nsafety, social support, problem behaviours and management of depression (Belle et al., 2006;\nMartindale-Adams, Nichols, Burns, Graney, & Zuber, 2013).\nSupport interventions\nHaley, Clay, & Roth, 2006; Mittelman, Roth, Clay, & Haley, 2007; Mittelman, Roth, Coon,\nand (4) Pillemer & Suitor, 2002), the `Strategies for relatives' programme (START) manual\nbased coping support included psychoeducation, counselling, relaxation, behaviour man-\nagement for carers with high burden improved carer mood (depression and anxiety) and\nreported less abusive behaviour of family carers towards care recipients (Livingston et al.,\n2013). Eight sessions were delivered over 8\u00ad14 weeks during eight months' follow-up. An\neconomic evaluation showed that START had a greater than 99% chance of being cost\neffective compared with usual treatment alone, at a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a330,000\nper Quality Adjusted Life Year gained, and a high probability of cost effectiveness in reduc-\nEnhanced counselling and support for family members (involving regular sessions with\ncarers and a family support group of unlimited sessions with ad-hoc counselling available\nover a long follow-up period) can lead to sustained benefits in reducing carer depression and\nless than half as many nursing home placements compared with usual care (Mittelman et al.,\n2004). The authors suggest that in order to be maximally effective, structured components of\nlonger duration should be widely available to provide effective, evidence-based interventions\nfor family carers.\nOverview\nIntensity, duration and follow-up varied across all studies. Of the better quality studies,\nthose that delivered more than 8\u00ad14 sessions of longer duration (over 16 weeks or more)\nreported one or more positive outcomes for person living with dementia and family carers.\nThese included psychosocial dyadic and carer interventions environmental, multicomponent\ndyadic and carer interventions, REACH studies, collaborative care and case management,\nphysical and structured dyadic support, e.g. OT-led interventions; supportive dyadic and\ncarer interventions such as counselling with behaviour management plus long-term follow-\nup. Examples of brief sessions but given over longer duration which improved one or more\noutcomes include CBT and psychosocial skills programme. Follow-up periods varied,\nalthough many of these had six months or more follow-up periods. However, cost implica-\ntions are not known. Although most papers described (to some extent) the resources\ninvolved in delivering the interventions (staffing, number of sessions, facilities and materi-\nals), these were rarely converted to a cost.\nOther lesser or unclear quality studies targeted at dyads or family carers suggest a few\npotentially effective interventions, such as family interventions targeted for diverse low/\nmiddle income settings using existing resources (Gavrilova et al., 2009; Guerra et al.,\n2011), culturally sensitive models using case managers (Chien & Lee, 2008), acquiring\nnew skills whilst enhancing strengths (Judge et al., 2012; Judge et al., 2010), and intensive\ntargeted behaviour programmes with triggers for coping with BPSD and family carer strat-\negies (Burns et al., 2003; Martin-Carrasco et al., 2009). Less intensive behaviour and edu-\ncational programmes showed no effect (Garand et al., 2002; Gerdner et al., 2002; Gormley\net al., 2001; Ulstein et al., 2007), whereas other low-quality studies of skills training and peer\nsupport gave mixed results (Hepburn et al., 2001; Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Wright et al.,\n2001). Larger good quality evaluations are required to establish effectiveness, cost implica-\ntions and their applicability.\nDiscussion\nWe evaluated evidence from 48 RCTs describing seven broad groups of non-\npharmacological interventions that addressed the management of BPSD for both people\nliving with dementia and their family carers living in the community. We synthesised the\nevidence according to intervention types, target groups and outcomes for persons living with\ndementia and family carers. The literature highlights the multiplicity of terms and tools used\nto describe and measure BPSD as well as multiple components of interventions and pro-\ngrammes. By considering broad groups of interventions, their key characteristics and deliv-\nery and relevant outcomes in target groups, we offer a way of evaluating effectiveness of\ndiffering interventions for a complex range of behaviour changes and symptoms. Evidence\nsupports the development of multi-faceted interventions that include enhancing family carer\nskills and educational support for them in coping and managing BPSD.\nHelping family carers through efforts such as training to focus on problem behaviours\nand potential triggers (anticipate stressful situations) and helping them to plan to manage\nchanging symptoms is important in developing effective interventions (Gitlin et al., 2007;\nGitlin et al., 2010b). Furthermore, family carers' level of readiness to engage in such activ-\nities impacts on behavioural symptom outcomes (Gitlin & Rose, 2016) and it is important to\nconsider this. Programmes involving trained health professionals to provide highly\naccessible and potentially low-cost interventions to enhance coping can be effective. Whilst\ntraining professionals can improve family carer competence, intervention effects are influ-\nenced by adherence to protocol (Moniz-Cook et al., 2008; Spijker, Teerenstra, et al., 2013;\nBehavioural interventions such as CBT require high-quality adequately powered studies\nto confirm their effectiveness for dyads and family carers. Multicomponent programmes\nthat include intensive counselling, support and behavioural management can improve family\ncarer outcomes (REACH studies; Mittelman et al., 2006). High levels of OT input in\norganisational interventions (such as integrated care with case management) mobilising\naccess to support, as well as physical and structured tailored activity programmes, have\nthe potential to reduce BPSD. However, cost implications of long, intensive interventions\ndelivered by nurses and OTs are unclear.\nRecent reviews have included mixed or long-term settings and many studies of the of\nBPSD focus on one type of intervention or symptom, or on a narrow range of either\n2017). A recent overview of systematic reviews also highlighted the heterogeneity of non-\npharmacological interventions, but it was limited only to systematic reviews in mixed set-\ntings and did not evaluate primary studies (Abraha et al., 2017).\nOur up-to-date evidence synthesis describes the effectiveness of support for people with\ndementia living at home with a diverse collection of distressing behaviours. It complements\nother overviews that emerged during the course of our study (e.g. Laver, Clemson, Bennett,\nLannain, & Brodaty, 2014). Our review adds to knowledge with its synthesis of evidence on\na broad group of interventions. Despite the large volume of research, this review demon-\nstrates the lack of clarity around what BPSD entails or the diverse behaviours that it can\nencompass, as highlighted by our preliminary stakeholder consultation.\nImplications for practice\nFor commissioners or service funders, there are difficult decisions about how to fund multi-\ncomponent programmes for symptom management. These decisions may now be better\ninformed by the evidence that practitioners with specific skills in managing BPSD (specific\nbehavioural intervention protocols with individualised plans and input from primary care\nprofessionals) can improve behavioural symptoms and family carer outcomes. It is impor-\ntant to consider family carer involvement and their readiness to participate in such inter-\nventions. More evidence is needed about what training and skills development are most\ncost-effective.\nStrengths and limitations of the review\nWe used systematic and rigorous methods to review RCT evidence. Despite our efforts to\nidentify all available studies, some may have been missed. However, we used a comprehen-\nsive approach to ensure that a broad evidence base from the first mapping stage enabled us\nto select appropriate studies for the evidence synthesis. In order to manage the literature for\ndyads and family carers, we prioritised RCTs that aimed to address BPSD management as a\ncomponent of a complex intervention, reported BPSD relevant outcomes and excluded poor\nquality pilot studies. Our findings might have been less tenuous if we had taken a narrower\nfocus to studies that included only people living with dementia, or only dyads, or only family\ncarers, but this would have excluded many studies and not reflected the heterogeneity of the\npopulation.\nSeveral methodological issues may have had an important bearing on the findings of this\nreview. Some studies were of limited quality, with short-term follow-up and high attrition.\nThere was a considerable heterogeneity in interventions and in the measurement of out-\ncomes, making comparisons difficult. The tools for measuring BPSD and related symptoms\nand family carer outcomes varied across the studies. Although participants' satisfaction and\nprocess measures from several studies and carers' reports from qualitative studies relating to\nRCTs were generally reported to be good, with only modest effects on other outcomes, it is\npossible that the intervention studied was ineffective due to methodological limitations or it\nmay be that these evaluations did not capture the complexity of BPSD. People living with\ndementia may exhibit more than one symptom and different symptoms may need different\ntreatments or interventions. Not all studies reported their theoretical basis, although some\nwere based on models from previous research. We categorised studies in what we judged to\nbe the main components of non-pharmacological interventions, as defined by previous\nresearch. Although we located a broad range of material, we excluded studies that did\nnot specifically address BPSD management in the intervention or did not provide adequate\ndetail for us to judge this. Despite the inherent complexity of BPSD management and the\nlimitations of our study, evidence highlights the benefit to people living with dementia and\nfamily carers of some interventions for BPSD management.\nThe resource implications of delivering interventions (staffing, number of sessions, facil-\nities and materials) varied considerably and were often incompletely reported. Costs were\nrarely calculated. Future evaluations of interventions would ideally provide robust evidence\nto funders or service commissioners through a full cost-effectiveness analysis. Where impact\non BPSD is incidental rather than the primary outcome and when interventions are multi-\ncomponent, issues associated with attributing input to effects need to be considered at the\nresearch design stage.\nImplications for research\nLarge-scale complex intervention studies with in-built economic evaluations and long\nfollow-up periods are required to clarify which interventions are effective and cost-\neffective. Standardisation of definitions and measures of BPSD across the research commu-\nnity including family carer perspectives would aid better targeting of interventions and aid\nmeta-analysis of data. Research should also explore the components of multifaceted inter-\nventions that contribute to effectiveness for both people living with dementia and family\ncarers, as well as examining intensity, dose, duration and format of effective interventions to\nassess `value for money'. Research designs that are more appropriate for complex\ninterventions and examine active ingredients of such interventions need to be developed\nFuture trials should collect qualitative data to explore how to better target interventions\nand contain a process analysis to identify features of adoption beyond research initiatives.\nCultural and linguistic specific interventions may be required to support people from diverse\npopulations. Future research needs to consider the effectiveness of tailoring interventions to\nimprove family carer readiness to use non-pharmacological interventions.\nConclusions\nThis review identified RCT interventions for the management of BPSD among people living\nwith dementia in the community and evaluated their effectiveness. The study findings pro-\nvide a benchmark for the development of an evidence base for practice and research.\nDisclaimer\nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the\nDepartment of Health.\n"
