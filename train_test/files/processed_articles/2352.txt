This statis-\ntic, however, reflects sources\namong all nonmedical users,\nfrom those who used the drug once or twice to more frequent\nusers. Recent research indicates that frequent nonmedical us-\ners are increasing in numbers and differ from infrequent us-\ners with respect to high-risk behaviors.3,4 Little research has\nexamined whether the source of opioid medication differs by\nfrequency of nonmedical use. Such research can inform the\ndevelopment of appropriately targeted interventions.\nMethods | We obtained our data from the National Survey on\nDrug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual survey of the non-\ninstitutionalized, civilian population 12 years or older that\nprovides estimates of substance use in the United States.2\nWe combined NSDUH public use files5 for the years 2008\nthrough 2011 to improve the precision of estimates. Institu-\ntional review board approval and informed consent were\nnot needed because this was a secondary analysis of data\nfrom a public use file.\nRespondents were asked about classes of drugs prone to\nabuse. They were told that questions about pain relievers\napplied to prescription opioids and selected barbiturate\ncombination products. Nonmedical use was defined as use\nwithout a prescription or use with a prescription for the\nfeeling or the experience caused by the drug. Respondents\nreported the frequency of nonmedical use, the type of opi-\noid pain reliever used, and the source of the opioid used\nmost recently.\nWe categorized the frequency of nonmedical use into the\ndays. This categorization has been used previously to exam-\ninetrendsinthefrequencyofnonmedicaluseofpainrelievers.4\nThe sources of opioid pain relievers were categorized into the\nfollowing 6 groups: given by a friend or a relative for free, pre-\nscribed by 1 or more physicians, stolen from a friend or a rela-\ntive, bought from a friend or a relative, bought from a drug\ndealer or other stranger, and other source. Average annual es-\netary software for interpretation of the survey results (SPSS\nComplex Samples; IBM) to account for the NSDUH's sam-\npling methods and weighting. We used 2-tailed t tests for\nstatistical testing.\n(91.8%) reported a source of an opioid pain reliever. Most non-\nmedical users were men, and more than half had annual in-\nobtained opioid pain relievers from friends and relatives for\nfree (Table 2); however, the source varied significantly by fre-\nquency of nonmedical use. Opioid pain relievers were ob-\ntained from a friend or a relative for free with decreasing fre-\nnonmedical use increased from a range of 1 to 29 to a range of\nAuthor Audio Interview at\njamainternalmedicine.com\nTable 1.

However, the highest-use, highest-risk group\nthan those with the lowest frequency of use to obtain opioids\nfrom a physician's prescription or from a drug dealer. This pat-\ntern is similar to that of patients in opioid treatment programs,\nwho cite dealers and physicians as frequent sources.6\nThese results underscore the need for interventions tar-\ngeting prescribing behaviors, in addition to those targeting\nmedication sharing, selling, and diversion. The essential steps\nhealth care providers can take to curb this serious health prob-\nlem include more judicious prescribing, use of prescription\ndrug\u00admonitoring programs, and screening patients for abuse\nrisk before prescribing opioids.\nChristopher M.
