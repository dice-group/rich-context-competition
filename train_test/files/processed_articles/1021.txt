The purpose of this study was to see if support provided and received from fellow church members reduced\nthe deleterious effects of financial strain on mortality in late life.\nwere asked in 2001 about financial strain, church-based social support, and a range of private and public religious\npractices. Mortality status was determined at the follow-up interview in 2004.\nResults. The findings indicated that providing social support to fellow church members reduced the effects of support\nproviders' own financial problems on mortality. In contrast, the data suggested that receiving support from people at\nchurch did not have the same stress-buffering effect.\nDiscussion. Finding ways to help older adults become more involved in providing support to others at church may\nform the basis for developing interventions aimed at improving their quality of life.\nA GROWING number of studies suggest that greater in-\nvolvement in religion is associated with better physical and\nmental health (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Some of the\nmost compelling evidence for these findings comes from studies\nthat use mortality as an outcome. This body of work suggests that\npeople who attend religious services on a regular basis are less\nlikely to die over the study follow-up period than individuals who\ndo not attend worship services on a regular basis (e.g., Hummer,\nRogers, Nam, & Ellison, 1999). Although this research has made\na major contribution to the literature, it is difficult to know what the\nstudy findings mean, because attending religious services is\na complex construct that encompasses a number of different\nattitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. For example, when people attend\nworship services, they often pray, engage in rituals, interact with\ntheir fellow congregationalists, listen to sermons, and participate\nin the singing of religious hymns. Any--or all--of these factors\nmight explain the relationship between attending worship services\nand mortality. Because providing a credible explanation is an\nimportant criterion for establishing causality (Bradley & Schaefer,\n1998), it is imperative that researchers strive to identify the\nunderlying factor(s) that are at work.\nResearchers have conducted a small cluster of studies in an\nattempt to explain the relationship between the frequency of\nattending religious services and mortality, but these efforts have\nbeen largely unsuccessful. For example, Musick, House, and\nWilliams (2004) examined the effect of attending religious\nservices on mortality after controlling for a number of factors,\nincluding health behaviors, social interaction, and several indi-\ncators of subjective religiousness. They reported that the impact of\nattending worship services on mortality remained largely un-\nchanged after they had taken into account the effects of these\nmediating variables (see also Ellison, Hummer, Cormier, &\nRogers, 2000). This suggests that researchers have yet to evaluate\nempirically the core aspects of religious attendance that are\nresponsible for the lower mortality risk. The purpose of the present\nstudy was to see if church-based social support may help explain\nthe link between attendance at worship services and mortality in\nlate life.\nThere are at least three reasons why it is important to focus\nspecifically on church-based social support. First, a number of the\ngrand masters in sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and philoso-\nphy have argued that social relationships lie at the very heart of\nsociologist, maintained that ``The faith that has come to be\nregarded as the essence and substance of religion is first of all\na relationship between human beings . . .'' (p. 108, emphasis in the\noriginal). Josiah Royce was a well-known philosopher of his time\nand a close personal friend of William James. Royce wrote\na volume in 1912 in order to overcome what he felt were serious\noversights in James's classic treatise on religion, The Varieties of\nwas the emphasis placed by James on the role of unconscious\nprocesses in the genesis of religious feelings and religious insights.\nRoyce maintained that instead of arising from within the\nindividual, the impetus for religious experiences and sentiments\nwas decidedly social in nature. More specifically, he argued that\n``. . . our social experience is our primary source of religious\ninsight. And the salvation that this insight brings to our knowledge\nis salvation through the fostering of human brotherhood. Such\nsalvation accrues to the individual so far as he gives himself over to\nThe empirical work of contemporary researchers points to the\nsecond reason why it is important to study church-based social\nsupport. Levin (2001) summarized this research when he set out\nto explain why more frequent attendance at religious services is\nassociated with better health. He concluded, ``I believe that\nsupportive relationships provided through religious fellowship best\nexplains the findings we have examined'' (p. 58). Research by\nEllison and George (1994) helps show why this may be so. These\ninvestigators maintained that social relationships in religious com-\nmunities are more extensive, denser, and more satisfying than\nsocial relationships in the secular world. Presumably, greater social\ncohesiveness in religious institutions arises in part from shared\nreligious beliefs. In particular, the tenets of every major religion\nencourage people to love one another, take care of those who are in\nneed, and forgive other people for the things they have done.\nSecular research on interpersonal ties points to the third reason\nwhy it is important to focus on social relationships in religious\ninstitutions. This vast body of work indicates that people who\nmaintain strong ties with others tend to enjoy better physical and\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nmental health than individuals who are not tightly integrated into\na supportive social network (Cohen, 2004).\nSome investigators have examined the impact of social rela-\ntionships on mortality in an effort to see if these relationships help\nexplain the influence of attending worship services on mortality\n(e.g., Musick et al., 2004). But they have been unable to find that\nsocial relationships are an important mediating factor. In fact,\nMusick and colleagues reported that more social support from\nfamily and friends is actually associated with an increased\nmortality risk. The authors explained this unanticipated finding\nby suggesting that people who have poor health consequently\nreceive more assistance from members of their social network.\nAlthough this is certainly possible, there is another way to think\nabout their results.\nResearchers have known for some time that support from\nsignificant others helps older adults cope more effectively with the\ndeleterious effects of stress (Krause, 2001). Consequently, the best\nmodel may be one in which researchers see if church-based support\noffsets, or moderates, the noxious effects of stress on mortality. It\nmay be especially important to evaluate this type of specification\nwhen trying to explain the effects of attending worship services,\nbecause researchers have argued for decades that one of the\nprimary functions of religion is to help people deal with adversity.\nnoted that religion ``. . . often exists without our being aware of it,\nuntil some crisis brings it out'' (see also Pargament, 1997).\nBased on this rationale, the first goal of the present study was to\ntest the following hypothesis: Church-based social support will\noffset the pernicious effects of stress on mortality in late life.\nAlthough this appears to be the first time that a researcher has\nexamined the relationships among these constructs in the literature,\nthese analyses may not go far enough.\nIn order to see what needs to be done, it is helpful to return to\naccrues to the individual so far as he gives himself over to the\nservice of man'' (p. 58). Simply put, this observation suggests that\nthe benefits of religion may arise not from receiving support, but\nfrom providing it to others. A small but growing cluster of studies\nconducted in secular settings tends to support Royce's views. In the\nprocess, these studies help extend research on helping others into\nthe health arena. More specifically, this research suggests that\nhelping others tends to enhance the health and psychological well-\nbeing of older support providers (e.g., Krause, Herzog, & Baker,\nIn his widely cited paper on helping behavior, Reissman (1965)\nprovided three reasons why support providers benefit from giving\nassistance to those in need. First, Reissman argued that helping\nother people enhances the self-esteem of the support provider.\nProviding assistance to those who are less fortunate makes a clear\nand unambiguous statement about the support provider because it\nhighlights basic aspects of his or her character that are admired\nwidely in American culture. This is an important consideration\nwhen a support provider is grappling with his or her own diffi-\nculties because a number of studies suggest that stress operates, in\npart, by reducing feelings of self-worth in late life (Krause &\nBorawski-Clark, 1994). Second, Reissman maintained that helping\nothers provides a psychological respite from the support provider's\nown difficulties: It shifts the focus away from the self and the\nproblems one often wrestles with. This is noteworthy because\nbeing able to temporarily escape one's own problems may have\nbeneficial effects on health and well-being, especially when\nstressors do not dissipate quickly (Gottlieb, 1997). Third, Reissman\nargued that seeing support recipients overcome problems with\nassistance they have been given tends to make support providers\nbelieve they may overcome their own difficulties with similar\nefforts. Viewed more broadly, helping others may increase feelings\nof control in the help provider. This is important because a vast\nliterature links strong feelings of personal control with better health\nAlthough Reissman (1965) conducted his research in a secular\nsetting, there is reason to believe that the benefits of helping others\nmay be especially evident among those who attend worship ser-\nvices often. In order to see why this may be so, it is important to\ndelve more deeply into the process of helping others. At the most\nbasic level, one person cannot provide effective assistance to\nanother without first understanding the situation of the individual\nwho is in need. Otherwise, the support that is provided may be\neither inappropriate or, at best, ineffective. Although a number of\nfactors may come into play, there is some evidence that help-giving\nis more effective when support providers view the objective cir-\ncumstances of the support recipient with empathy and compassion.\nIn fact, this approach to helping others formed the cornerstone\nof Carl Rogers's approach to psychotherapy. Based on years of\nclinical experience, he concluded that effective help-giving in the\ntherapeutic setting is contingent upon the empathy, caring, and\ncompassion of the therapist (Rogers, 1989). These virtues are im-\nportant because, as Wuthnow (1991) pointed out, they lie at the\nheart of biblical teachings. More specifically, Wuthnow observed,\n``The biblical tradition teaches compassion as a duty to divine law,\nas a response to divine love, and as a sign of commitment to the\nJudeo-Christian ethic'' (p. 50). If empathy and compassion are\nessential for effective helping, and these virtues are strongly\nsupported by religious teachings, then the health-related effects of\nhelping others should be especially evident among those who\nattend worship services often.\nThis discussion of help-giving leads to the second major\nhypothesis that was examined in this study: The impact of stress on\nmortality will be reduced for older study participants who provide\nsupport to the people they worship with.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study came from my nationwide longitudinal\nsurvey of older Whites and older African Americans. I defined the\nstudy population as all household residents who were either White\nor Black, noninstitutionalized, English speaking, and at least 66\nyears old. Geographically, I restricted the study population to\neligible persons residing within the coterminous United States (i.e.,\nresidents of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded). Finally, I restricted\nthe study population to people who were currently practicing\nChristians, individuals who were Christian in the past but who no\nlonger practiced any religion, and people who had not been\naffiliated with any faith at any point in their lifetime. I excluded\nindividuals who practiced a religion other than Christianity (e.g.,\nJews or Muslims) because it would have been too difficult to\ndevise a set of religion measures that would have been suitable for\nuse with persons of all faiths.\nThe sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons contained in\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database. I used\na five-step process to draw the sample from the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services file. I provide a detailed discussion of these\nsteps in another article (Krause, 2002).\nInterviewing for the baseline survey took place in 2001. All\ninterviews were conducted face to face in the homes of the study\nparticipants. Harris Interactive (New York, NY) performed the data\ncollection. A total of 1,500 interviews were completed. Elderly\nBlacks were oversampled, and, as a result, the final sample\nconsisted of 748 Whites and 752 African Americans. The overall\nresponse rate for the Wave 1 survey was 62%.\nthe original 1,500 study participants were successfully re-\ninterviewed; 75 persons refused to participate, 112 could not be\nlocated, 70 were too ill to participate, 11 had moved to a nursing\nhome, and 208 were deceased. Not counting those who had died\nor who had been placed in a nursing home, the re-interview rate\nfor the Wave 2 survey was 80%.\nThe social support measures used in the analyses presented in the\nResults section assessed assistance that older study participants\nexchanged with their fellow church members. When the Wave 1\nquestionnaire was being developed, the research team decided it did\nnot make sense to ask older people questions about church-based\nsocial support if they attended religious services no more than twice\na year. Based on this decision, the church-based social support\nmeasures were not administered to 374 Wave 1 study participants.\nThese individuals were, therefore, excluded from the analyses\npresented below. After listwise deletion of cases that included item\nnonresponse, the analyses presented below are based on 976 cases.\nPreliminary analysis revealed that 46% of these study participants\nwere older Whites, and 54% were older Blacks. The average age of\nthese individuals was 74.2 years at the baseline survey (SD \u00bc 6.2\nyears). Approximately 39% were older men. Finally, the older\nadults in this group indicated they had successfully completed an\naverage of 11.7 years of schooling (SD \u00bc 3.4 years). These\ndescriptive data, as well as the results presented below, are based on\ndata that have been weighted.\nMeasures\nTable 1 contains the core measures that were used in this\nstudy. The table footnotes describe the procedures used to code\nthese items.\nMortality status. --Mortality status at the Wave 2 interview was\ndetermined by informant report. Because no effort was made to\ndetermine why study subjects had died, this measure reflects death\nfrom all causes. This indicator is coded so that 1 denotes those who\nhad died and 0 denotes those who were not known to have died\nat the time of follow-up interview.\nMany studies use death certificates to verify mortality. Even so,\nthere are three reasons why informant reports of mortality are\nuseful. The first is found in a study by Wolinsky and Johnson\n(1992). Using data from the Longitudinal Study on Aging, these\ninvestigators compared informant reports of death against data\ncontained in the National Death Index (compiled by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services, Atlanta, GA). Wolinsky and Johnson found\nvirtually no difference in the study results when informant reports\nwere used in place of National Death Index data. Therefore, they\nconcluded that informants provide valid data on mortality. The\nsecond reason why informant reports are useful may be found in\nthe results that will be presented later in this article. These data will\nshow that the pattern of findings and the magnitude of the\nrelationships involving well-known correlates of mortality (e.g.,\nself-rated health status) are similar to estimates derived in studies\nthat verified mortality with death certificates. Finally, the present\nstudy is not the first to use informant reports of death. Several other\ninvestigators have used informant reports to conduct meaningful\nresearch into the correlates of mortality in late life (e.g., Bernard\nJohnson).\nChurch-based emotional support. --As is shown in Table 1,\nthree indicators were used to measure how often older study\nparticipants had received emotional support from their fellow\nchurch members during the year prior to the baseline survey (M \u00bc\nto assess how often the older people in this study had provided\nemotional support to the people with whom they worshipped (M \u00bc\nTable 1.

The items differed only with respect to whether support was\nreceived or provided. This helped ensure that differences in the\neffects of these measures could be attributed specifically to whether\nthe respondent gave or received support. I devised all six\nindicators, as described in another article (Krause, 2002). A high\nscore on either scale denoted more frequent emotional support. The\ninternal consistency reliability measure for the scale assessing\nsupport received was .787, whereas the corresponding estimate for\nthe scale assessing support provided was .843\nPreliminary analysis revealed that the two church-based social\nsupport measures were significantly related (r \u00bc .714; p , .001).\nWhen viewed at the bivariate level, this means that one measure\nexplained approximately 50% of the variance in the other measure,\nand an equal proportion of the variance was explained by other\nfactors. This suggests that the two church-based support measures\nassessed related, but conceptually distinct, constructs.\nChronic financial strain. --Ongoing economic problems were\nevaluated with two items that came from the work of Pearlin and\ncolleagues (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981; M \u00bc\nhaving greater financial difficulty. The correlation between the two\nOrganizational religiousness. --Three indicators were used to\nassess the extent to which older study participants were involved in\nchurch. The first measured the frequency of attendance at worship\nolder study participants attended adult Sunday School or Bible\noften the older people participated in prayer groups that were not\npart of regular worship services or Bible study groups (M \u00bc 3.210,\nSD \u00bc 2.805). A high score on each item represented more frequent\ninvolvement in organized religion. Because most studies have\nfocused solely on the frequency of church attendance, the three\nindicators of organizational religiousness were treated as separate\nindependent variables in the analyses presented below.\nPrivate religiousness. --Two indicators of private religious\npractices were included in the analyses to further pinpoint the\naspects of religion that are associated with a lower mortality risk.\nThe first assessed how often older people prayed when they were\noften they read the Bible when they were at home (M \u00bc 5.106,\nSD \u00bc 2.397). A high score on either measure represented greater\nprivate involvement in religion.\nSelf-rated health. --Global self-rated health was assessed with\ntwo indicators. The first asked respondents to rate their overall\nhealth as excellent, good, fair, or poor. The second asked study\nparticipants to compare their health at the time of the interview to\ntheir health a year before the interview. A high score on either\nmeasure denoted better self-rated health. The correlation between\nDemographic control variables. --The relationships among\nstress, the religion measures, and mortality were assessed after the\neffects of age, gender, education, and race were controlled\nstatistically. Age was scored in a continuous format. Similarly,\neducation was coded in a continuous format denoting the total\nnumber of years of completed schooling. In contrast, gender (1 \u00bc\nmale, 0\u00bcfemale) and race (1\u00bcWhite, 0\u00bcBlack) were represented\nwith binary indicators.\nRESULTS\nI evaluated the hypotheses for this study by using a hierarchical\nlogistic regression analysis. Table 2 shows the findings. I centered\nall independent variables on their means prior to analysis. The\nanalysis consisted of five steps. I present the results obtained\nat each step in the discussion that follows. Following this, I pres-\nent some supplementary analyses that I have not discussed up to\nthis point.\nChurch Attendance and Mortality\nI conducted the first step in the hierarchical analysis (see Model\n1 in Table 2) in order to see if older people who attended church\nmore frequently had a lower mortality risk. Consistent with the\nresults of a number of other studies (e.g., Musick et al., 2004),\nthe data suggested that more frequent church attendance was asso-\nciated with a lower mortality risk (b \u00bc \u00c0.140; odds ratio [OR] \u00bc\n0.870; p , .05). In addition, the results further revealed that older\nless favorable health ratings at the baseline interview (b \u00bc \u00c0.392;\nOR \u00bc 0.676) were more likely to die during the course of the study\nfollow-up period. This latter set of findings is important because it\nprovides evidence that results based on informant reports of death\nTable 2.  \nSupport received 3\nFinancial strain\nSupport provided 3\nFinancial strain\nNotes: For the table, N \u00bc 976. Data presented are logistic regression coef-\nficients; odds ratios are presented in parentheses.\nare quite similar to results from studies where deaths have been\nverified with death certificates (e.g., Hummer et al., 1999).\nAdditive Effects of Other Religion Measures\nI estimated Model 2 in order to see if adding other measures of\nreligious involvement (i.e., attending Bible study and prayer\ngroups, private prayer, private Bible reading, and the additive\neffects of church-based social support) to the equation helped\nexplain the relationship between church attendance and mortality.\nTwo important findings emerged from this model. First, consistent\nwith the findings reported by Musick and associates (2004), the\ndata indicated that older people who received more emotional\nsupport from the people they worshipped with had an elevated\nrevealed that the effects of church attendance on mortality were not\ndiminished after the additive effects of other religion measures had\nReceived Support, Financial Strain, and Mortality\nI estimated Model 3 in order to see if emotional support\nprovided by fellow church members offset or buffered the effects\nof financial strain on mortality in late life. I evaluated these stress\nmoderating effects by testing for a statistical interaction effect\nbetween financial strain and emotional support received from\nfellow church members on mortality. The data derived from\nestimating Model 3 suggested that a statistically significant\ninteraction effect was present in the data (b \u00bc \u00c0.073; OR \u00bc\n0.930; p , .01). The sign of this relationship revealed that as the\nlevel of support received increased, the impact of financial strain on\nmortality decreased. The data in Model 3 further revealed that the\neffects of church attendance on mortality were no longer\nstatistically significant once the stress-buffering effects of church-\nbased emotional support had been taken into account (b \u00bc\u00c0.130;\nSupport Provided to Others, Financial Strain,\nand Mortality\nThe second hypothesis proposed for this study stated that\nproviding emotional assistance to others would reduce the\ndeleterious effects of financial strain on mortality. I estimated\nModel 4 in order to evaluate this possibility. As in Model 3, I\nassessed stress-buffering effects by including a multiplicative term\nin the model. However, in the case of Model 4, I included the cross-\nproduct term in order to capture the interaction between financial\nstrain and providing emotional support to fellow church members\non mortality. The data provided by Model 4 suggested that the\nimpact of financial strain on mortality was reduced for older\npeople who provided more emotional support to the people in\nAssessing the Relative Effects of Support\nReceived and Support Provided\nThe findings up to this point suggest that both support received\nand support provided appear to offset the pernicious effects of\nfinancial strain on mortality in late life. But it is important to know\nif receiving support is more important than providing support, or\nwhether both affect an older person's mortality risk. I conducted\nthe final step in the hierarchical logistic regression analysis (see\nModel 5) in order to address this issue. I entered two multiplicative\nterms into the equation in order to assess the stress-buffering\neffects of support received and support provided, respectively. The\ndata provided by Model 5 revealed that emotional support provided\nby older study participants to their fellow church members offset\nthe noxious effects of financial strain on mortality (b \u00bc \u00c0.083;\nthe participants failed to have similar stress-buffering effects\nAlthough the data provided by Model 5 suggest that the\nmultiplicative term associated with providing emotional support to\nothers is statistically significant, it may be somewhat difficult to\ndetermine if the interaction effect is in the hypothesized direction.\nFortunately, it is possible to clarify the nature of these results by\nperforming two sets of calculations by hand. The first involves\nderiving separate estimates of the effects of financial strain on\nmortality at selected levels of emotional support provided to others\n(see Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000, for a discussion of these\ncalculations). The second set of computations will show if the\nestimates derived in the first set differ significantly from zero. If the\ninteraction effect is in the proposed direction, then the effects of\nfinancial strain on the odds of dying should become weaker at\nprogressively higher levels of support. I could have performed the\ncalculations with any value of support provided to others. The raw\nscores on this measure ranged from 3 to 12. Therefore, I selected\nthe following equally spaced levels of support for the computa-\nThe additional computations (not shown here) suggested that\nexposure to financial strain significantly increased the odds of\ndying for older people who provided little emotional support to the\npeople they worship with (i.e., those with the lowest provided-\nimportant because 44 older adults had the lowest possible score on\nthe scale that assessed emotional support provided to others. The\nadditional calculations further revealed that financial strain was still\nassociated with an elevated mortality risk for older people with\na provided-support score of 6, but the deleterious effects of\nfinancial strain had been reduced by approximately 40% (b \u00bc .366;\nfell very close to -1 standard deviation below the mean support\nvalue (\u00c01 SD \u00bc 6.089). The stress-buffering effects of helping\nothers at church were especially evident for older people with\npernicious effects of financial strain on mortality were completely\noffset at this level. This is noteworthy because the average score on\nthe scale that assessed emotional support provided to fellow church\nmembers was 8.674. Finally, the results revealed that financial\nstrain also failed to exert a significant effect on the odds of dying\nfor older people with the highest possible provided-support score\nSupplementary Analyses\nIn the Sample section, I reported that some study participants\nhad been excluded from the analyses because they attended church\nno more than twice a year. In order to place the main study findings\nin a more complete context, it was helpful to provide some\ndescriptive data on these individuals. I accomplished this by\ncreating a variable contrasting those who went to church twice\na year or less (scored 1) with those who went to church more often\n(scored 0). Then, by using logistic regression, I regressed this\nbinary outcome on the following indicators: age, gender,\neducation, race, health, financial strain (Wave 1) and mortality\nstatus (Wave 2). The data (not shown here) suggested that\ncompared with those who went to church often, those who went\ntwice a year or less were more likely to be men (b \u00bc .487; p ,\nKRAUSE\nmore likely to encounter less financial strain (b \u00bc\u00c0.116; p , .05).\nIn contrast, statistically significant differences emerged with\nrespect to age and mortality status at the follow-up interview.\nA second group of study participants was excluded from this\nstudy because they were lost to follow-up. More specifically, they\neither refused to participate in the Wave 2 interview, could not be\nlocated for the follow-up interview, had moved into a nursing\nhome, or were too ill to participate in the second survey. Once\nagain, it was helpful to provide some descriptive data on these\nindividuals. I accomplished this by creating a variable that\ncontrasted those who were lost to follow-up (scored 1) with those\nwho either participated in the Wave 2 survey or were dead (scored\n0). Then, by using logistic regression, I regressed this binary\noutcome on the Wave 1 measures of age, gender, education, race,\nhealth, financial strain, church attendance, and private prayer. The\nfindings (not shown here) indicated that no statistically signifi-\ncant differences existed between the two groups for any of the\nindependent variables in the model.\nDISCUSSION\nThe findings from the present study suggest that greater\ninvolvement in religion is associated with a lower mortality risk.\nA number of other investigators have reached this general\nconclusion (McCullough, 2001). However, what sets the present\nstudy apart from other work in the field is the greater specificity of\nthe results. So far, the wide majority of studies have focused\nprimarily on the relationship between the frequency of attendance at\nreligious services and mortality. The data provided here move\nbeyond this by tracing the potentially beneficial effects of religious\nattendance to social relationships that tend to thrive in church\nsettings. More specifically, the findings reveal that providing\nemotional support to fellow church members tends to lessen the\ndeleterious effect of the support provider's own economic problems\non mortality. However, researchers must take care when interpreting\nthe findings involving church attendance. Recall that the measures\nof church-based support were administered only to older adults who\nattended church more than twice a year. This means that providing\nsupport and financial strain appear to explain the relationship\nbetween church attendance and mortality, but this conclusion only\napplies to older people who attend church more than twice a year.\nNevertheless, this approach is justified; if something about\ninvolvement in the church affects longevity, then researchers must\nlook at what takes place within the church for the answer.\nThere are two reasons why greater confidence may be placed in\nthe results of this study than in results from existing studies in this\narea. First, I observed these findings after including a number of\nindicators of private and public religiousness in the model. Second,\nI juxtaposed the potentially beneficial effects of giving support to\nothers with the effects of receiving support from fellow church\nmembers, and only providing support emerged as a significant\nfactor. This appears to be the first time that anyone has examined\nempirically the stress-buffering function of providing support to\nothers in church and mortality.\nOther researchers have tried to discover if social support can\nexplain the connection between church attendance and mortality,\nbut their efforts have been largely unsuccessful. There are at least\nthree reasons why this may be so. First, researchers have typically\nused measures that assess support from a person's entire social\nnetwork. This includes assistance that arises from both inside as\nwell as outside the church (e.g., Musick et al., 2004). One could\nargue that this approach is justified because a strong commitment\nto one's faith should affect relationships inside as well as outside\nthe church. However, as Ellison and George (1994) pointed out,\nrelationships within the church may be especially close because\nthey arise from a shared set of values and beliefs. The second\nreason why previous studies may have failed to show that social\nrelationships play a significant role in explaining the connection\nbetween church attendance and mortality has to do with the nature\nof the models that have been tested. Until now, investigators have\nfocused exclusively on the additive effects of social support\nwithout taking stress into consideration. But as the data provided\nhere reveal, the potentially beneficial effects of social ties only\nbecome evident when they are viewed in conjunction with stress.\nPut in more technical terms, researchers may not have been testing\nfor the correct functional form of the relationship between social\nsupport and mortality. Third, previous studies have been concerned\nsolely with support received from others. However, as the findings\nfrom the present study indicate, providing assistance to fellow\nchurch members may be more consequential than receiving it.\nAlthough the results provided here may be thought provoking,\na great deal of work remains to be done. To begin with, this study\nfocused on only one kind of stressful experience: chronic financial\nstrain. As a result, it is not possible to tell whether the protective\nfunction of providing support to others extends to other kinds of\nstressors as well. In addition, it would be helpful to see how the\npotentially beneficial effects of providing support to others at\nchurch arise. A number of intervening mechanisms were identified\nabove (e.g., self-esteem and personal control), but I did not\nevaluate these factors empirically in this study. Finally, researchers\nneed to identify the factors that influence the provision of support\nin the church in the first place (i.e., they need to treat providing\nsupport to others at church as a dependent variable).\nAs research on the religion\u00adhealth relationship continues to\nmature, some investigators have moved beyond epidemiological\nstudies to the development and testing of religiously based\ninterventions. Researchers have made important strides in areas\ninvolving forgiveness (Worthington, Mazzeo, & Canter, 2005),\nreligious coping responses (Pargament, 1997), and prayer (Harris\net al., 1999). If the findings from the present study can be\nreplicated, then researchers may also want to develop interventions\nthat focus on helping older church members become more effective\nspoke of aging as a ``roleless-role.'' He meant that as people go\nthrough late life, they tend to exit a number of important social\nroles. For example, they become widowed, they retire from the\nworkforce, and their children grow up and leave the home. At the\nsame time, people often find few opportunities to fill this void with\nnew roles and activities. The results from the present study suggest\nthat finding ways to become more involved in helping people\nat church may be an important option. A number of interventions\nhave been developed to promote the help-giving process in secular\nsettings (see Hogan, Linden, & Najarian, 2002), but there do not\nappear to be any that focus specifically on helping older people\nprovide support to others in religious settings.\nImplementing interventions in religious settings must be done\nwith great care and sensitivity because ethical issues arise that are\nnot typically encountered in other contexts. Specifically, the United\nStates Constitution clearly calls for the separation of church and\nstate. This raises vital questions about whether it is appropriate to\nuse state and federal funds for the purpose of implementing church-\nbased social support interventions.\nAlfred Adler was a noted psychiatrist. The construct of social\nfeeling and social interest occupied a pivotal position in his\ntheoretical perspective. Social feeling involves a sense of com-\nmunity, empathy, solidarity, and interest in others. Adler believed\nthese social feelings formed the basis of religion: ``The primal\nenergy which was so effective in establishing regulative religious\ngoals was none other than that of social feeling. This was meant to\nbind human beings more closely to one another'' (Adler, 1933/\nAdler may have been right. Moreover, these results reaffirm, and\nreinforce, a rich intellectual tradition that spans a number of\ndisciplines and stretches out across a century.\n"
