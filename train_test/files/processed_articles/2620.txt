In particular, union dis-\nsolution has increased, owing to high divorce\nrates and the growing proportion of births that\noccur outside of marriage (which are less often\nfollowed by long-term union stability than are\nmarital births). Because children are more likely\nto live with their mother when their parents'\nunion ends (Amato, 2000), fathers today are\nmore likely to be living away from their bio-\nlogical children than are mothers--and than\ntheir mid-20th-century counterparts. Overall, a\nstriking aggregate decline in the proportion of\nU.S. men living with their own biological chil-\ndren has been observed between the mid-1960s\nbeyond. From the perspective of children,\naccording to recent census data, 27% of all\nchildren under age 18 were living away from\ntheir biological father in 2014 (U.S. Census\nIn addition to changing demographic pat-\nterns, fathers' involvement in family life has also\nchanged substantially over the past half-century,\nreflecting shifts in family gender roles and the\ndivision of household labor and market work.\nAlthough providing economic support remains\nFathers' Money and Time 11\nimportant, fathering today also often includes\nnurturing and providing direct care; engaging in\ncognitive stimulation and play activities; taking\nresponsibility for coordinating children's care\nand activities; and connecting the child to his\nor her extended family, community members,\nand other resources (Cabrera, Tamis-LeMonda,\nBradley, Hofferth, & Lamb, 2000; Marsiglio,\nAt the intersection of changes in family\ndemography and the nature of fathering is the\nfact that there is, today, great heterogeneity\nin how men enact the father role. Although a\nsignificant body of research has explored the\n\"new fatherhood\" and its consequences for\nchildren (Cabrera & Tamis-LeMonda, 2012;\nLamb, 2010), less well understood is how the\nvarious dimensions of contemporary fathers'\ninvolvement may be interrelated, particularly\nacross residential contexts. In this article we\nprovide descriptive evidence about how fathers'\neconomic capacities and contributions are\nlinked to fathers' time involvement (across\nseveral measures), comparing resident versus\nnonresident fathers over Years 1\u00ad9 after a focal\nchild's birth. This is an important question\nbecause this interrelationship may affect the\ntotal amount of investment that children \"get,\"\nwhich is linked with children's well-being and\nAlso, this work highlights the challenges for\nnonresident fathers to remain actively involved\nwith children, as they cannot benefit from the\njoint allocation of parenting tasks that occurs\namong coresident couples and as they must nav-\nigate greater complexity when new partners (of\nfathers or mothers) get involved (Tach, Mincy,\nConceptual Framing and Prior Empirical\nResearch\nFamily scholars often point to two key domains\nof parental investments in children--economic\nresources and parenting behaviors--or, collo-\nquially, money and time (Thomson & McLana-\nhan, 2012). Economic resources enable parents\nto provide the food, clothing, and shelter req-\nuisite for daily living as well as the material\ngoods and experiences that promote positive\nchild development (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn,\nenting time encompasses the wide range of\ninteractions, behaviors, and activities that allow\nparents to provide the appropriate warmth, sup-\nport, control, and monitoring that are intrin-\nsic to high-quality (or so-called \"authoritative\")\nparenting, which has been shown to be posi-\ntively related to children's well-being (Amato &\nAlthough early research on parenting empha-\nsized the importance of mothers for children,\nthe past few decades have produced a large\nliterature more specifically focused on father-\nhood, exploring variation in its content, context,\nand implications (Furstenberg, 1988; Lamb,\nthe father role has broadened from the heyday\nof the breadwinner\u00adhomemaker family model\nproviding economic support remains a key\nelement of fathering and fathers' identity today\n(Christiansen & Palkovitz, 2001). Economic\ncontributions and capacities are reflected in\nthe work hours that fathers expend in the labor\nmarket, their earnings (which result both from\nwork hours and reflect characteristics such\nas age and education), and--for nonresident\nfathers--the actual amount that they pay toward\nchildren's expenses in the form of child support.\nWith respect to fathers'(noneconomic) involve-\nment with children, one of the first and most\nenduring typologies of father involvement iden-\ntified three key components: (a) accessibility,\n(b) engagement, and (c) responsibility (Lamb,\nAccessibility refers to time fathers are available\nto children (even if not directly interacting),\nengagement refers to fathers' time with children\ndoing activities together, and responsibility\nrefers to fathers' helping to arrange resources\nand activities for children (Lamb, 1986). We\nexplore each of these here.\nLinks Between Fathers' Money and Time\nInvestments, by Residential Status\nFor cohabiting and, especially, married men,\npaternal investments of money and time occur\nconjointly within what some scholars have\ncalled the \"package deal\" (Furstenberg & Cher-\nclassic theory of household production posits\nthat households \"combine time and market\ngoods to produce more basic commodities that\ndirectly enter their utility functions\" (p. 495).\nAs Weiss and Willis (1985) argued, children are\na collective good, and parents living together\n12 Journal of Marriage and Family\n(especially with the insurance value of marriage)\ncan jointly allocate their investments of time in\nmarket work and time with children to achieve\nan efficient outcome (Steinberg, 2001). Because\ntime is finite, time spent in the labor market\nis by definition time not spent with children,\nso we would expect a negative relationship\nbetween employment and parental involvement\ngenerally, but especially for fathers, who have\nhistorically spent more time in breadwinning\nBy contrast, nonresident fathers face both\nbarriers and disincentives to their involvement\nwith children, and providing economic support\nmay in fact facilitate fathers being involved in\nother ways. When fathers live apart from their\nchildren, they have less incentive to invest in\nthem because they cannot be certain how any\ncontributions will be spent (Weiss & Willis,\n1985). When combined with the lost economies\nof scale (two households vs. one), child-rearing\ninvestments by nonresident fathers are likely\nto be inefficiently low without policy interven-\ntion (Willis, 2000). Also, mothers may serve\nas \"gatekeepers\" to children after separation\n(Allen & Hawkins, 1999), and financial con-\ntributions help mothers to perceive fathers as\nmore competent (Fagan & Barnett, 2003). In\nparticular, fathers' greater work effort, higher\nearnings--and, even more so, their actual finan-\ncial contributions--may give them (and the\nmother) a greater sense of being a \"good\" father\nand hence encourage their involvement in other\nways (Johnson, Levine, & Doolittle, 1999;\nLerman & Sorenson, 2000). Recent studies\nhave found a positive link between paternal\nemployment of unmarried, nonresident fathers\nand father\u00adchild contact (Cabrera, Fagan, &\nas well as between fathers' child support (espe-\ncially informal support) and fathers' time with\nGarasky, Stewart, Gundersen, & Lohman, 2010;\nfore, although, as for resident fathers, time at\nwork cannot be time spent with children, we\nwould expect a positive relationship between\nnonresident fathers' economic capacities and\ntime involvement.\nConfounding Factors\nSelection may play a role in how fathers'\neconomic characteristics are associated with\nfathers' time involvement with children. Dis-\nadvantaged fathers (who are often young,\nracial/ethnic minorities, had a nonmarital birth,\nhave been incarcerated, had children with more\nthan one partner, and experienced a nontradi-\ntional family structure in youth) generally have\nweaker connections to the formal economy\nand lower levels of father involvement than\ntheir more advantaged counterparts (Berger\n& Langton, 2011; Cheadle, Amato, & King,\n2010). Additional factors that may influence\nfather involvement include health (Coley &\nand fathering attitudes and context (Carlson &\nchild can influence fathers' work effort and time\ninvolvement (Lundberg, McLanahan, & Rose,\n2007), and a grandmother living in the home\nprovides another set of hands to help with child\nrearing but may also alter fathers' duties and\nresponsibilities (Dunifon, Ziol-Guest, & Kopko,\nThe Present Study\nIn this article we provide new information about\nfathers' involvement with children over Years\n1\u00ad9 after a focal child's birth, using data from\nthe Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study\n(http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu).\nWe examine how fathers' economic capaci-\nties and characteristics (money) are related to\ntheir direct involvement (time) with children,\nexploring differences between resident and\nnonresident fathers. This research sheds light\non the nature of contemporary fatherhood and\nwhat children \"get\" from parents and highlights\nthe challenges for nonresident fathers to stay\ninvolved.\nMethod\nData\nWe use data from the Fragile Families and\nChild Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal study of\nurban births (with an oversample of nonmari-\nried and 1,187 married), and the weighted sam-\nple is representative of births in U.S. cities with\nwith mothers and fathers took place in 75 hos-\npitals in 20 cities (in 15 states) just after the\nFathers' Money and Time 13\nbaby's birth, and follow-up interviews were con-\nducted about 1, 3, 5, and 9 years after the birth.\nOverall, 4,331 fathers were interviewed at least\nonce from birth through Year 9. At the 1-, 3-, 5-,\nand 9-year follow-up surveys, the proportions of\neligible unmarried (at birth) fathers interviewed\nrespectively.\nAnalytic Sample\nWe limited our sample to fathers who were\ninterviewed at least once over the 1-, 3-, 5-,\ndropped fathers who were interviewed in jail\n(because incarceration hinders fathers' ability\nto contribute both time and money; n = 102,\n2.5%) and cases in which the focal child did\nnot reside with the biological mother at least\n(2.2%) were dropped because of missing data\non the main variables of interest (father's eco-\nnomic capacities or time involvement). The full\nanalytic sample for this article consists of 3,869\nfathers. We pooled interviewed cases across the\nobservations, with a mean number of 2.9 sur-\nvey waves for each father. Fathers' residence\nstatus relative to the focal child is reported\nat each survey wave and can change across\nwaves (if the father moves in or out); resident\nfathers contributed 7,167 person-year observa-\ntions, and nonresident fathers contributed 3,888\nperson-year observations.\nObservations with missing data on covariates\nwere multiply imputed with chained equations\nusing the mi commands in Stata 14. All vari-\nables were included in the imputation equations,\nand 10 imputed data sets were created. The frac-\ntion missing was 11% or less for every vari-\nable except earnings, with 30% of person-years\nmissing primarily because of missing data at\nthe 1-year survey (we imputed this information\nas noted later). Only observations with com-\nplete information on the outcome variables were\nused for analyses (White, Royston, & Wood,\n2011). The sample varies slightly across the esti-\nmated models, as the number of cases with com-\nplete information on each father involvement\nmeasure fluctuates. It is important to keep the\nanalytic sample in mind when interpreting the\nfindings; fathers lost to attrition by the 9-year\nsurvey were more disadvantaged than those who\nremained.\nFathers' Economic Characteristics (Money)\nWe used several measures of fathers' economic\ncharacteristics in order to capture different\naspects of fathers' work effort and capacity\nas providers. Across the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year\nsurveys fathers reported on their employment\nand earnings during the previous year. For\nour employment measure, we combined hours\nworked per week and weeks worked per year\nto create a measure of average weekly hours\nworked. For our earnings measure, we used\ninformation based on fathers' reports about\nearnings from all jobs in the past year to get a\nmeasure of annual earnings (converted to 2008\ndollars--the approximate year of the last survey\nwave). Fathers who said they \"didn't know\"\ntheir exact earnings were given a range of val-\nues, which we then converted to median values\nwithin categories. In addition, a direct question\nabout total earnings from all jobs was not asked\nof all respondents at the 1-year survey, so we\nimputed the missing observations with a series of\npredictors: currently employed, weeks worked\nper year, relationship status, race, education,\nimmigrant status, and ever incarcerated.\nFor nonresident fathers, in addition to work\nhours and earnings, we also include the total\nannual amount of child support paid, reported by\nmothers. At each survey wave, mothers indicated\nthe amount of formal child support received in\nthe past year (or since a formal order began\nor changed) as well as the amount of informal\nsupport received. We summed these amounts\nand converted the total into an annualized metric.\nNonresident fathers without a formal order and\nno informal agreement with the mother were\ncoded as 0. Fathers' child support payments are\ninflation-adjusted and reported in 2008 dollars.\nFathers' Direct Involvement (Time)\nWe measured fathers' direct involvement with\nchildren with multiple variables that correspond\nto the key domains of paternal involvement:\naccessibility (time), engagement, and responsi-\nbility. We relied on mothers' reports of fathers'\ninvolvement in order to avoid inflated associa-\ntions due to shared method variance, whereby\nthe same individual reports on both the indepen-\ndent and dependent variables (Marsiglio et al.,\n2000). Fathers' accessibility to (or time with)\nthe child reflects how often the father spent\none or more hours a day with the child in\nthe past month, ranging from 1 (never) to 5\n14 Journal of Marriage and Family\n(every day). We measured paternal engagement\nin father\u00adchild activities at Years 1, 3, and 5 as\nthe mean number of days (0\u00ad7) that the father did\neach of four activities with the child in the past\nweek: singing, reading stories, telling stories,\ntively). At Year 9, engagement included different\nactivities reflecting children's older age: playing\nsports or outdoor activities, reading with or talk-\ning about books, talking with the child about his\nor her day, and helping with homework. Also,\nthe response scale was changed to reflect activ-\nities in the past month, ranging from 1 (never)\nto 5 (every day); we assigned the 1\u00ad5 scores to\n0\u00ad7 days to yield a range of variation similar\nto those at prior waves ( = .85). To examine\nfathers' shared responsibility for child-related\ntasks, we relied on mothers' reports about how\noften the father (a) \"Looks after [child] when\nyou need to do things,\" (b) \"Runs errands like\npicking things up from the store,\" and (c) \"Takes\n[child] places (he/she) needs to go, such as to\nday care or the doctor.\" Response choices ranged\nfrom never (1) to often (4), with higher average\nscores indicating greater shared responsibility\n( = .89\u00ad.95 across waves). An additional mea-\nsure of fathers' time with children was available\nfor nonresident fathers: Mothers reported the\nnumber of days fathers saw the child in the past\nmonth (range: 0\u00ad30). We also created a com-\nposite involvement measure that used all items\nfrom the time, engagement, and responsibility\nmeasures common to nonresident and resident\nfathers; each item was standardized with a mean\nfor resident fathers and .91\u00ad.94 for nonresident\nfathers across waves).\nCovariates\nWe included a number of time-constant and\ntime-varying covariates that may be associated\nwith both fathers' economic capacities and\ntime involvement. All time-constant measures\nwere reported by fathers at the baseline survey\nunless otherwise noted. We include whether\nthe parents were married when the focal child\nwas born (reported by mothers). Fathers' age\nat birth was self-reported in years. Fathers'\nrace/ethnicity was specified as non-Hispanic\nWhite (reference), non-Hispanic Black, His-\npanic, and non-Hispanic other race. Fathers'\neducation was measured with categories of less\nthan high school (reference), high school degree,\nsome college, and bachelor's degree or higher.\nImmigrant status indicated that the father was\nborn outside the United States. Fathers' family\nbackground reflected whether he lived with both\nbiological parents at age 15. We also included\nfathers' attitudes toward fathering, based on\nwhether they responded strongly disagree (1) to\nstrongly agree (4) with the following statements:\n(a) \"Being a father and raising children is one of\nthe most fulfilling experiences a man can have,\"\n(b) \"I want people to know that I have a new\nchild,\" and (c) \"Not being a part of my child's\nlife would be one the worst things that could\nhappen to me.\" Responses were averaged, and\nhigher scores indicated more positive attitudes\n( = .73). We also indicated whether the child\nwas a boy.\nTime-varying covariates were measured at\neach wave and were reported by fathers unless\nnoted otherwise. Fathers' self-reported health\nstatus ranged from poor (1) to excellent (5). Reli-\ngious service attendance ranged from never (1)\nto more than once a week (5). Fathers with a\nmajor depressive episode were classified accord-\ning to the Composite International Diagnos-\ntic Interview--Short Form (Kessler, Andrews,\nMroczek, Ustun, & Wittchen, 1998). Mothers'\nand fathers' combined reports indicated whether\nthe father had ever been incarcerated by each\nfollow-up wave. The father reported the total\nnumber of biological children he had had with\nthe focal child's mother and with other women\n(multipartnered fertility).\nWe also included time-varying covariates that\ncaptured mothers' and fathers' relationship sta-\ntus. For coresident fathers, we included a vari-\nable indicating that they were legally married\nto the child's mother (vs. cohabiting). For non-\nresident fathers, we included a dummy variable\nindicating they were in a dating relationship with\nthe mother (vs. not romantically involved), and\nwe included separate variables indicating that\nthe father--or the mother--was involved in a\nromantic relationship with a new partner. Last,\nwe included whether the child's grandmother\nwas living with the mother and child and the\nnumber of hours that the mother worked per\nweek, both reported by mothers.\nSample Description\nTable 1 shows the time-invariant characteristics\nof our sample by residence status at the 1-year\nsurvey, weighted by city sampling weights.\nFathers' Money and Time 15\nTable 1.

Sample statistics measured at the Year 1\nsurvey.\nOverall, resident fathers were more advantaged\nthan nonresident fathers. Resident fathers were\nmore likely to have been married to the child's\nmother, to have higher levels of education,\nto have lived with both biological parents at\nage 15, and to have more positive fathering\nattitudes. Nonresident fathers were much more\nlikely to be of minority race/ethnicity, to have\nbeen incarcerated, and to have had a child with\nanother partner.\nAs shown in Table 2, the composition of resi-\ndent and nonresident fathers changed over time,\nas an increasing number of coresident couples\nbroke up. As a result, changes in mean levels\nof father involvement across waves reflect both\nchanges in the parenting behavior of fathers who\nremained in a given status as well as changes in\nthe sample composition as fathers moved from\nresident to nonresident status (and a small num-\nber moved from nonresident to resident status).\nAt 1 year, 71% of resident fathers were mar-\nried to the focal child's mother. By 9 years, this\nfraction had increased to 88%, reflecting mar-\nriage among some cohabiting couples and that\na greater share of cohabiting than married par-\nents broke up over time. For nonresident fathers,\n18% were dating the focal child's mother at 1\nyear, compared to 10% by 9 years. At 1 year,\n32% of nonresident fathers were involved with\na new partner, which then increased over time.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe first present descriptive statistics on the eco-\nnomic and involvement variables, by residence\n16 Journal of Marriage and Family\nTable 2.

Then we use two multi-\nvariate analytic techniques (with pooled data\nacross the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year surveys) to\nexamine how fathers' economic resources were\nassociated with fathers' direct involvement\n(time, engagement, and shared responsibility).\nBecause we have repeated measures about the\nsame men over time, we used models designed\nfor panel data. Random effects models use vari-\nation both between and within fathers, including\ntime-constant and time-varying variables, and\nfixed effects models use variation only within\nfathers over time to examine how changes in\neconomic characteristics are associated with\nchanges in direct involvement, controlling for\ntime-varying variables (time-constant variables\nare automatically dropped). The latter reduces\nbias by controlling for unobserved individual,\ntime-invariant characteristics that may be asso-\nciated with fathers' economic resources and\nFor example, some fathers may have personal\nvalues (e.g., conscientiousness) that predict both\ntheir hard work in the labor market and their\nactive involvement with children. The Hausman\ntest (at p < .05) indicated that random effects\nmodels were more efficient for resident fathers\nbut that fixed effects models should be used for\nnonresident fathers (in other words, the error\nterm is correlated with the predictor variables).\nBecause we are conceptually interested in\nbetween-father as well as within-father varia-\ntion, we present both random and fixed effects\nresults for both resident and nonresident fathers.\nWe estimated separate models for resident and\nnonresident fathers, pooling across waves based\non residence status at each wave. (Note that\n43% of ever-nonresident fathers and 27% of\never-resident fathers were observed only once\nin their respective residence statuses so do not\ncontribute to the fixed effects estimates.) Given\nhigh correlations among our measures of eco-\nnomic resources and involvement (all pairwise\ncorrelations are over .6), we estimated sepa-\nrate models for each economic characteristic\npredicting each involvement measure.\nResults\nWe first describe patterns of fathers' economic\ncapacities and direct involvement with children\nby residence status at 1, 3, 5, and 9 years fol-\nlowing the birth of the focal child (see Table 2).\nAs expected, we found that resident fathers\nhad much higher economic capacities and were\nmuch more involved than nonresident fathers;\nin other words, children who lived with their\nfathers received greater paternal investments\nof both money and time. Levels of resident\npaternal involvement appeared to be quite stable\nover time. By contrast, nonresident fathers'\naverage earnings and child support payments\nincreased across waves, partly because formerly\nresident fathers entered this group after union\ndissolution, whereas paternal time involvement\ntended to decrease across waves. Because, as\nnoted above, the sample of nonresident fathers\nbecomes more positively selected over time, the\ndecline we observe is likely underestimated.\nWe now turn to our multivariate results about\nhow fathers' economic characteristics and time\ninvolvement are linked. Table 3 shows random\neffects and fixed effects results for resident and\nnonresident fathers. We remind readers that for\neach father-involvement measure (listed down\nthe left column as Panels A\u00adE) a separate regres-\nsion was estimated for each economic variable\nand is presented in an individual cell.\nAnnual earnings are negatively associated\n(but not statistically significantly so) with the\nresident father spending one or more hours with\nthe child. (Because the vast majority of resident\nfathers spend one or more hours with the child\nevery day, we reran this analysis using a logit\nmodel with a dichotomous variable; we found\nthat higher earnings were negatively associated\n[p < .05] with the father spending time with the\nchild every day.) Average weekly hours worked\nare significantly and negatively associated with\nspending time with the child. For each additional\nfewer units of time with the child--a differ-\nence that is significant but modest (about 3% of\na standard deviation). For paternal engagement\nin activities (see Panel B of Table 3), resident\nfathers with higher levels of economic invest-\nment are significantly less likely to engage in\nactivities with the focal child, although the mag-\nnitude of the relationships remains modest. Each\nmeasure of engagement in father\u00adchild activi-\nties (2% of a mean standard deviation). Average\nweekly hours worked is associated with lower\ndard deviation). Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween resident fathers' economic capacities\nand the 1-to-4 measure of shared responsibility\n18 Journal of Marriage and Family\nTable 3.

Res. = residential.\nFathers' Money and Time 19\n(Panel C of Table 3) is negative and signifi-\ncant across both economic indicators, although\nthe magnitudes of the associations are also very\nsmall (1%\u00ad3% of a standard deviation). Sim-\nilarly, the composite involvement measure (in\nstandard deviation units) that combines all the\nfather involvement measures (time, engagement,\nand responsibility) into a single measure is con-\nsistently, negatively related to both economic\nmeasures. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat for resident fathers, greater investment in\nthe labor market is associated with significantly\nlower--though very modest in size--levels of\npaternal involvement; thus, for resident fathers,\ninvestments in breadwinning and in more direct\ninvolvement with the child appear to operate as\nsubstitutes.\nFor nonresident fathers, the pattern of results\ndiffers in two ways: father's economic capacities\nare mostly positively related with involvement,\nand the strength of the association varies by the\nparticular economic characteristic and type of\ninvolvement being considered. Higher levels of\nated with the father being more likely to spend\none or more hours with the child in the past\nweek--although again of very modest size (2%\nor less of a mean standard deviation). For each\nadditional $100 that the father paid in total child\nsupport in a year, he engaged 0.004 more days in\nfather\u00adchild activities. Nonresident fathers who\npaid more in child support also had higher lev-\nels of shared responsibility for child rearing and\nhigher scores on the composite measure of father\ninvolvement. With respect to the number of days\nnonresident fathers saw their child in the past\nmonth, both annual earnings and child support\npayments are both positively and significantly\nrelated. All associations were miniscule to mod-\nest in size.\nWe also tested whether the estimates for res-\nident versus nonresident fathers were signifi-\ncantly different from one another. For all eight\npossible comparisons (two independent vari-\nables \u00d7 four dependent variables) in the random\neffects models, we found that all estimates sig-\nnificantly differ between resident and nonresi-\ndent fathers (p < .05). Because all estimates for\nresident fathers are in a negative direction and\nall statistically significant estimates for nonresi-\ndent fathers are in a positive direction, the signif-\nicant difference points to the fact that economic\ncapacities play a fundamentally different role\nin facilitating the time involvement of fathers\ndepending on whether they live with or away\nfrom their children.\nFixed effects estimates of the relationship\nbetween father's economic characteristics and\ninvolvement--which rely only on within-father\nchange and hence are more conservative with\nrespect to causal inference--are also presented\nin Table 3. However, this approach eliminates\nthe between-father comparison that is of overall\ninterest in this research. For resident fathers, the\nresults for all measures remained negative and\nsignificant, as with the random effects (though\nagain, the magnitudes were very small), except\nthat earnings as linked to responsibility is no\nlonger statistically significant. These results pro-\nvide greater evidence that fathers' investments\nof money and time appear to operate as substi-\ntutes when fathers live with their child(ren): As\nthe same resident fathers increase their earnings\nand time in the labor market over time, they also\ndecrease their engagement and overall involve-\nment with the focal child.\nFor nonresident fathers, some--but not\nall--of the fixed effects estimates are also\nstatistically significant, suggesting that the\nrandom effects results were not entirely due to\ndifferences in characteristics between fathers.\nIncreases in the amount of child support paid\nby nonresident fathers are positively linked with\ngreater involvement across all five measures.\nOn average, nonresident fathers who increased\ntheir earnings also increased the number of days\nthey had seen the child in the past month. These\nresults suggest that as nonresident fathers'\nfinancial contributions to children increase, their\ninvolvement also increases over time. The sin-\ngle exception to this pattern is the link between\naverage weekly hours worked per week; there\nis a significant negative relationship between\nincreasing hours worked and father\u00adchild\nengagement.\nAgain, evaluating whether these point esti-\nmates significantly differed between resident\nand nonresident fathers, we found that four of\nthe eight possible comparisons were statisti-\ncally significant at p < .05 or below; these all\noccurred where the direction of the point esti-\nmate was negative for resident fathers but posi-\ntive for nonresident fathers. It is not surprising\nthat there are fewer differences once we ana-\nlyze only within-father change, yet where we\ndid find persisting differences they support our\ncontention that economic resources may play a\n20 Journal of Marriage and Family\ndifferent role as linked to direct involvement for\nresident versus nonresident fathers.\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our\nmain analyses using fathers' reports of involve-\nment (where available, results not shown); we\nfound no major differences in the overall rela-\ntionship between fathers' economic characteris-\ntics and time involvement, and the coefficient\nmagnitudes were similar. Furthermore, to deter-\nmine the extent to which our results are driven\nby fathers changing residence categories over\ntime (mostly as coresident couples broke up),\nwe conducted a second set of analyses (not\nshown) limited to fathers who were stably res-\nident or stably nonresident, that is, those who\nlived with the focal child over all of Years 1\u00ad9\nversus those who never lived with the child.\nThe results were remarkably similar to our main\nresults, suggesting that the substantive conclu-\nsions are not driven by the changing composition\nof the groups, as fathers (primarily) move out\nof the child's household. Finally, we also con-\nducted a cluster analysis to evaluate whether our\nsmall but differing correlations of money and\ntime for resident versus nonresident fathers were\ndriven by within-group heterogeneity. Using all\nfive money and time variables, cluster analy-\nses yielded three groups of fathers: nonresi-\ndent fathers, higher-earning resident fathers and\nlower-earning resident fathers. We then repli-\ncated our random and fixed effects analyses sep-\narately by cluster, and the results were very\nsimilar to our main results (and the results for\nthe two groups of resident fathers did not differ).\nDiscussion\nIn this article we have presented new descrip-\ntive information about the levels and interre-\nlationships of fathers' economic capacities and\ntime involvement with children among a con-\ntemporary cohort of urban fathers over child\nages 1\u00ad9. As with prior research, we found\nthat resident fathers had much higher economic\ncapacities--and displayed much higher levels\nof spending time with children, engaging in\nfather\u00adchild activities, and sharing responsibility\nfor coordinating children's care--than nonresi-\ndent fathers (Amato, 1998; Carlson & Berger,\n2013). Taken together, our results suggest that\neconomic capacities and contributions (money)\noperate quite differently as related to direct\ninvolvement (time) for resident versus nonresi-\ndent fathers. For resident fathers, there appears\nto be a trade-off between investments in mar-\nket work and time spent in more direct aspects\nof involvement and care: They operate as sub-\nstitutes. At higher levels of work effort and\nearnings, resident fathers displayed significantly\nlower levels of time spent with children, engage-\nment in activities, and shared responsibility. As\nsuch, fathers' investments in financial provision\nappear to \"count\" as investments in children as\ncollective goods, consistent with the notion of\nthe \"package deal\" whereby marriage, father-\ning, and employment go together (Furstenberg\nFor nonresident fathers, across all the pair-\nwise combinations of economic resource mea-\nsures and direct involvement measures, there\nwas only one statistically significant estimate\nsuggesting that financial investment and time\ninvolvement appeared to operate as substitutes\n(hours worked and father\u00adchild engagement in\nthe fixed effects models)--even though greater\ntime in the labor market necessarily means that\nfathers have less available time for other activi-\nties, including parenting. Other than this single\nexception, our statistically significant regres-\nsion estimates all suggested that greater eco-\nnomic capacity and contributions by nonresident\nfathers instead \"go together\" with being involved\nin other ways with their children (spending time,\nengaging in activities, and sharing responsibil-\nity). Therefore, these two domains of involve-\nment (money and time) appear to operate as\ncomplements for nonresident fathers as such\nmen do \"double duty\" to remain involved with\ntheir children.\nTaken together, these findings extend our\nunderstanding about how fathers contribute\nto children's lives and how their investments\nvary--in both level and implications--as a\nfunction of whether they are living with or\nliving away from their children (and the mothers\nof their children). It is important to note that we\ncannot identify the direction of this association\nhere, although prior research that has explicitly\nconsidered the directionality of money and time\ninvestments for nonresident fathers suggests\nthat child support payments enhance father\ncontact more than contact enhances payments\n(Nepomnyaschy, 2007). Thus, our research\nfurther suggests that, for nonresident fathers,\nhigher levels of economic resources may be\nan important prerequisite for fathers to also\nhave direct involvement with their children.\nAlso, we have not considered differences in the\nFathers' Money and Time 21\nassociation as children age--a useful topic for\nfuture research.\nFrom a broader perspective, our results\nsuggest that differences across fathers in what\nthey invest in children can contribute to grow-\ning inequalities in the next generation. Men\nwho share parental investments with biological\nmothers in the same household not only have\nhigher levels of both economic resources and\nparental time involvement but also benefit from\nthe economies of scale that enhance parents'\nability to jointly (and efficiently) allocate the\nmarket work and household investments they\nmake in their children as a collective good. As\nsuch, men living with children and mothers\nhave greater flexibility in how they enact the\nfather role, and they also have more support in\ndoing so. By contrast, nonresident fathers--who\nhave lower levels of economic resources--face\nhigher transaction costs in order to spend time\nand engage with their children at the same time\nthat they have less flexibility in how they invest\nas parents.\nAlthough we believe our research provides\na useful extension to the literature, we also\nacknowledge several limitations. First, our\nresults are relevant only to families of children\nSecond, fathers are typically underrepresented\nin national surveys (Nelson, 2004), and the\nFragile Families study also did not interview\nsome fathers and lost some fathers to attrition\n(typically the more disadvantaged fathers); our\nresults thus cannot estimate the associations of\ninterest for the missing group of nonresident\nfathers. Third, we recognize that fathers may\nbe involved in other ways that we are not mea-\nsuring here (e.g., telephone calls, cards/letters,\nor e-mail). Fourth, we used mothers' reports\nin our main analyses to avoid using the same\nreporter for both the independent and dependent\nvariables, but mothers may not have accurate\ninformation about fathers' involvement, espe-\ncially for nonresident fathers (Coley & Morris,\n2002). Our mostly similar findings when using\nmeasures based on fathers' reports were thus\nreassuring. Fifth, although our methods partially\naccounted for unobserved heterogeneity, our\nresults could still be biased by time-varying\nunobserved differences.\nIn sum, this article has provided new descrip-\ntive information about fathers' involvement in\nchildren's lives across residential contexts. We\nfound important differences in how the father\nrole is enacted for resident versus nonresident\nfathers. Although resident fathers appear to\nexperience a trade-off between their time in the\nlabor market and their time directly involved\nwith children, nonresident fathers' contributions\nappear to \"go together\" such that financial capa-\nbilities and contributions serve to increase other\naspects of involvement. Given the low economic\nresources of many nonresident fathers, this\ncircumstance may create challenges for fathers\nto remain actively involved in their children's\nlives with respect to both money and time, with\nlong-term implications for children.\nNote\nThis research was supported by the Child Support Research\nAgreement between the Wisconsin Department of Children\nand Families and the Institute for Research on Poverty (Prin-\ncipal Investigators: Maria Cancian and Dan Meyer), as well\nthe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child\nHealth and Human Development through a grant to Mar-\nChild Wellbeing Study was also provided by the Eunice\nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and\nfoundations (see http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/\nabout/funders for a complete list).
