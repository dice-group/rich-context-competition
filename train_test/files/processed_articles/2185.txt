We selected genetic loci associated with BMI or obesity in European-descent samples and examined them in a\nmultiethnic adolescent sample.\nAmerican (AsA) participants of the National Longitudinal Study of   (Add Health; ages 12\u00ad21 years, 47.5% male),\nwe assessed the association between 41 established obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with BMI using\nadditive genetic models, stratified by race/ethnicity, and in a pooled meta-analysis sample. We also compared the magnitude of\neffect for BMI\u00adSNP associations in EA and AfA adolescents to comparable effect estimates from 11 861 EA and AfA adults in the\nAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ages 45\u00ad64 years, 43.2% male).\nRESULTS: Thirty-five of 41 BMI\u00adSNP associations were directionally consistent with published studies in European populations, 18\nachieved nominal significance (Po0.05; effect sizes from 0.19 to 0.71 kg m\u00c0 2 increase in BMI per effect allele), while 4 (FTO,\nTMEM18, TFAP2B, MC4R) remained significant after Bonferroni correction (Po0.0015). Of 41 BMI\u00adSNP associations in AfA, HA and\nAsA adolescents, nine, three and five, respectively, were directionally consistent and nominally significant. In the pooled meta-\nanalysis, 36 of 41 effect estimates were directionally consistent and 21 of 36 were nominally significant. In EA adolescents, BMI\neffect estimates were larger (Po0.05) for variants near TMEM18, PTER and MC4R and smaller for variants near MTIF3 and NRXN3\ncompared with EA adults.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that obesity susceptibility loci may have a comparatively stronger role during adolescence\nthan during adulthood, with variation across race/ethnic subpopulation.\nKeywords: genetics of obesity; adolescence; BMI; African; Hispanic; Asian American\nINTRODUCTION\nAdolescence is a period of high risk for weight gain1,2 Adolescent\nobesity is highly predictive of adult-onset obesity and severe\nobesity (body mass index (BMI) X40 kg m\u00c0 2), particularly in\nminority populations.3\u00ad5 In the past 5 years, genome-wide\nassociation studies (GWAS) have identified nearly 40 common\ngenetic loci associated with BMI and obesity in European middle-\naged adults.6\u00ad9 Studies in children have replicated some of these\nassociations.8,10\u00ad13 Few studies examined these associations in\nadolescents and fewer have compared the magnitudes of effect\nduring different phases of the life course. A few longitudinal\nstudies of specific genetic variants have shown stronger genetic\nassociation during adolescence,14\u00ad16 and notable decline\ngested larger effect sizes for variants in/near TMEM18, SEC16B,\nKCTD15 and BNDF in European children and adolescents\ncompared with adults.12\nRecent GWAS in non-European ancestry populations have\nidentified additional loci.17\u00ad20 Targeted genotyping studies of\nselected variants have been undertaken in African Americans\n(AfA),20,21 Hispanic Americans (HAs),22 and several ethnically\ndiverse populations.23 However, these studies have been limited\nin scope of variants tested and have had relatively small sample\nsizes. The contribution of genetic loci for BMI on body mass during\nadolescence across different ancestral populations remains largely\nunknown.\nTo study the contributions during adolescence of BMI single-\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in European adult\npopulations, we used nationally representative data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of   (Add Health)\naged 12\u00ad21 years.

Add Health is a nationally representative cohort of\ndrawn from a probability sample of 80 US high schools and 52 US middle\nschools, representative of US schools in 1994\u00ad95 with respect to region,\nurban setting, school size, school type and race or ethnic background.\nby design Wave I adolescents still of school-age, including those currently\nin high school and high school drop outs. Oversampled subgroups include\nrelated and non-related adolescents sharing a Wave I household (n \u00bc 5524\nWave I respondents living in 2639 households),24 and several race/ethnic\nsubpopulations, including Chinese, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Filipinos.\nyears) followed all Wave I respondents, regardless of Wave II participation.\nThe most recent data collection (Wave IV) included follow-up interviews\nrespondents. Survey procedures have been described elsewhere25\u00ad27 and\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board, University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill.\nRace/ethnicity. Genetic markers used to determine ancestry were\nunavailable. As a proxy for ancestry, we used a race/ethnicity variable\nconstructed using survey data on ancestral background and family\nrelationship status from participants and their parents (that is, country of\norigin, length of time in the US, ancestry and adoption). We use a four-\ncategory race/ethnicity classification: EA, AfA, HA and AsA, with control\nvariables for subpopulation ancestry: Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South\nAmerican, Mexican, Other Hispanic, Chinese, Filipino and Other Asian. In\naddition, we classified Hispanic and Asian individuals as non-US born (first\ngeneration immigrants), and US born (2nd or 3rd generation immigrants),\ngiven differences in BMI by immigrant status.28,29\nLiterature-based SNPs\nWe initially selected 68 SNPs associated with BMI and waist circumference\nfrom the Genome-wide Investigation of ANThropometric measures (GIANT)\nconsortium and other studies in European adults for genotyping.6\u00ad8,30,31\nWe assessed redundancy using the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD)\namong these 68 SNPs within a multiethnic HapMap reference panel (CEU,\nYRI and CHB populations, excluding SNPs with a pairwise r240.80),\nreducing the number of SNPs to be genotyped to 42 spanning 39 loci. We\nincluded two SNPs at three loci (near MC4R, SEC16B and SH2B1) to capture\nvariation in LD for Asian and African genetic structure around these loci. Of\nand 4 have been associated with obesity.9\nGenotyping. DNA was isolated from Wave IV saliva samples at the\nInstitute of Behavioral Genetics in Boulder, Colorado using the BuccalAmp\nDNA extraction kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA), quantified by PicoGreen\nfluorescence and visualized on standard agarose gels. DNA quality was\nassessed and genotyping performed at the Biospeciman Processing Core\nand Mammalian Genotyping Core (University of North Carolina, Chapel\nHill) using TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and\nstandard protocols using the ABI Prism 7900-HT Sequence Detection\nSystem. Genotypes were called using SDS 2.2.2. Based on 277 duplicate\nsample pairs, the overall discordance rate across SNPs was 0.3%. Further\nassessment of quality control was performed using PLINK 1.07. The\ngenotype call rate was 497.8% in each of the four race/ethnic groups. One\nwas excluded, resulting in a 41 SNPs investigated in the analyses. Another\ntwo SNPs were excluded in specific race/ethnic groups: rs867559 (HA) and\nOutcome measure: BMI. Weight and height were measured during in-\nhome surveys using standardized procedures.

Our final\nStatistical analysis. BMI\u00adSNP association tests in Add Health were\nconducted using Stata software, version 12.1 (Stata Corp., College Station,\nTX, USA). All analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, and results for BMI\u00ad\nSNP associations within each race/ethnic groups were combined and\nanalyzed using pooled meta-analyses. We assumed an additive genetic\nmodel and used multivariable linear mixed models to regress each SNP on\nBMI, adjusting for age, sex, current smoking (at least one cigarette/day for\n30 days), geographic region of residence and an indicator for self-reported\n(n \u00bc 81) versus measured height and weight, and models for AfA included\nindicator variables for oversampling based on education level. In a\nsensitivity analysis, we ran all models without the participants with self-\nreported heights and weights (n \u00bc 81) and found no difference in the\nmagnitude and direction of estimated effects (see Supplementary Table 2).\nHispanic and Asian models included indicator variables for subpopulation:\nCuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American, Mexican, other Hispanic,\nChinese, Filipino and other Asian and for immigrant status: non-US born\n(first generation), and US born (2nd or 3rd generation). In all models,\nsample clustering and familial relatedness were accounted for using\nseparate random effects for school and family. Effect estimates were\ncombined and meta-analyzed in METAL software using the inverse s.e.\nweighted approach.33 For each SNP association, we evaluated\nheterogeneity between race/ethnic groups using Cochran's Q.

Effect sizes were larger\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough GWAS have identified several common genetic loci\nassociated with BMI in European-descent, middle-aged adults6\u00ad8\nthe extent to which findings generalize to other lifecycle periods\nand other racial/ethnic groups is just beginning to be explored.\nUsing ancestrally diverse, national data on adolescents, we\nevaluated 41 established BMI and obesity SNPs from European-\ndescent adult studies to assess replication in EA adolescents, to\nmeasure generalization across EA, AfA, HA and AsA, and to\ncompare effect estimates for EA adolescents to middle-aged\nadults. We observed evidence for generalization across all groups,\nespecially in EA and AfA, which had the largest sample sizes. These\ndata provide evidence for larger effect sizes in both EA\nadolescents compared with adults. In general, the observed\neffect estimates were larger, up to 3\u00ad5 times larger, indicating a\nstronger estimated effect on BMI in EA adolescents compared with\nmiddle-aged EA adults.\nGeneralization in EA adolescents\nWe observed 35 directionally consistent associations relative to\npublished results in European-descent samples, of which 18\nachieved nominal statistical significance (Po0.05). Only one of the\nfour obesity SNPs achieved nominal significance. Most GWAS SNPs\nfor BMI-related traits have replicated in EA adult populations.6\u00ad8,30\nOther periods in the life course have not been routinely\ninterrogated, though studies in children have replicated findings\nGeneralization across ancestrally diverse populations\nIn the meta-analyzed sample, we observed 21 of 41 nominally\nsignificant BMI\u00adSNP associations, and 36 of 41 that were\ndirectionally consistent with published studies. Similarity in the\ngenetic architecture of BMI across race-ethnic groups is of interest.\nSeveral of the loci are thought to have a role in the central nervous\nsystem, speficially with weight regulation. Of the 10 SNPs that\nwere directionally consistent across all four race/ethnic groups,\nfive are located near the genes NEGR1, MTCH2, SH2B1, MC4R and\nTMEM18 that are highly expressed in the brain. SH2B1 is implicated\nin leptin signaling,40 and disruption of MC4R and SH2B1 in mice\nresults in hyperphagia and obesity.41\u00ad43 NEGR1 is thought to affect\nneuronal outgrowth in the developing brain.44 The SNP in NPC1\nimplications for cholesterol trafficking in the central nervous\nIn contrast, some findings were inconsistent across race/ethnic\nstrata, likely due to insufficient power but also possibly due to\ndifferences in LD. For example, variants in FTO have been\npopulations.38 These SNPs exhibit low LD (o0.3) with each other\nin both the CEU and YRI HapMap Phase II populations and may\nexhibit LD with an unidentified causal variant. We tested one FTO\ndetected in the AfA sample, likely because of differences in LD, nor\nin the AsA sample (although other Asian studies have confirmed\nthe FTO\u00adBMI association17\u00ad19 using the same SNP or one in high\nLD), likely because of the very small sample size. Therefore,\nadditional SNPs are needed to further characterize these\nassociations across race/ethnicity groups.\nEffect size differences in adolescents versus adults\nOur observation of comparatively stronger estimated genetic\neffects in adolescents than adults (Figure 3, Supplementary\nTables 4) is supported by the literature. A study of the association\nbetween FTO and MC4R gene variants with body size in EAs from\nbirth to age 53 years showed evidence for variation of effects that\nincreased between birth and age 20, and then weakened during\nadulthood.15 A study of genetic susceptibility to obesity in\nEuropean children, aged 9 years, and adolescents, aged 15\nyears, found effect sizes for BMI that were 1.4\u00ad2.8-fold higher in\nchildren/adolescents compared with adults for variants in/near\nTMEM18, SEC16B and KCTD15, but two-fold lower for the variant\nin/near BNDF.12 A meta-analysis comparison of BMI and obesity-\nrelated SNPs in children/adolescents versus adults in European\ncohorts demonstrated a larger, though not statistically significant,\neffect on BMI for five loci, including SEC16B, TMEM18, GNPDA2,\nMC4R and KCTD15; our study also identified significantly larger\neffect sizes for BMI in EA adolescents compared with EA adults for\nthe SNPs near TMEM18 and MC4R.\nVariants near MTIF3 and NRXN3 had larger effect sizes in EA\nadults compared with adolescents. The reasons for larger effect\nsizes during adolescence are unclear, however, we note that the\nadolescent MTIF3 and NRXN3 associations in EA were directionally\ninconsistent and non-significant. Other possible limitations\ninclude the relatively narrow age range marked by post-pubertal\ngrowth and body composition changes in Add Health, whereas\nthe ARIC sample spanned almost 20 years (age 45\u00ad64 years), a\ncomparatively stable period of weight change. Cohort differences\nbetween the two samples, such as the decade during which data\nFigure 3.

Of 41 comparisons, the\nSNPs displayed are those with P-value for differences o0.10, sorted\nfrom largest to smallest effect estimates in Add Health adolescents.\nBMI loci in a multiethnic cohort of adolescents\nM Graff et al\nNutrition and Diabetes & 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited\nwere collected, may have contributed to observed differences. The\nARIC adults matured before the obesity epidemic, whereas the\nAdd Health cohort matured in a comparatively more obesogenic\nenvironment and may have experienced differential contributions\nof genetic influences on weight. Over time, and with age, the\nobesogenic environment may have a comparatively stronger\ninfluence on body weight than genetic factors. Finally, the Add\nHealth sample is nationally representative, while the ARIC adults\noriginated from four communities, which may have resulted in\ngreater environmental homogeneity relative to Add Health. Other\ndifferences between Add Health and ARIC, including unmeasured\nenvironmental contexts, might influence BMI. These differences\nhighlight the importance of replicating our findings in age diverse\ncohorts collected and analyzed with consistent sampling designs\nand methodology.\nWhile our study capitalizes on an ancestrally diverse nationally\nrepresentative cohort measured during a unique period of the\nlifecycle, there are study limitations. First, the lack of adult\nestablished obesity loci in all racial/ethnic groups is a limitation,\nparticularly in the HA. Second, we were underpowered to detect\neffects for many of the subpopulations, particularly for the HA and\nAsA adolescents. Third, there may have been important limitations\nto our effect size comparisons, including contextual and sample\nsize differences between the Add Health and ARIC samples.\nFourth, Add Health spans the period from post-puberty through\nyoung adulthood (only 6% of the girls had not attained menarche\nat measurement). However, most of the children were post\npubertal, and therefore weight changes likely reflect changes in\nfat mass, Of greater relevance, however, is the fact that recent\nstudies suggest pleiotropic effects for several loci associated with\nmenarche and BMI.49 Without knowing which phenotype was\ninfluenced first by the genetic loci, we might diminish a true\nassociation on BMI by adjusting for menarche, thus we did not\nadjust for it.\nDespite these limitations, our findings begin to fill a gap in the\nliterature on the high risk period between adolescence and young\nadulthood and in racially/ethnically diverse samples. At the same\ntime, these estimates can be used in future meta-analyses in these\nunderstudied race/ethnic groups. At present, our study is the only\nof its kind in this age group. Using these unique data, we find that\nmany of the genetic variants known to be associated with BMI in\nEuropean-descent adults have relatively larger effects during the\nadolescent period, with variation across race/ethnicity.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
