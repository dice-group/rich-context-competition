Many health behaviors and social environmental factors\nhave been found to be associated with LTL. Several of these are also associated with con-\nscientiousness, a dispositional personality trait. Conscientiousness is a propensity to be\nplanful, adhere to social norms, and inhibit pre-potent responses. Like LTL, conscientious-\nness is prospectively related to mortality, possibly through cumulative effects on health over\nthe life course via multiple pathways. As a result, we hypothesized that childhood levels of\nconscientiousness would predict LTL prospectively in adulthood. We selected a sample of\n60 women in the Hawaii Personality and Health Cohort; 30 described by their teachers as\nhigh on conscientiousness in childhood and 30 described as low on the trait. Dried blood\nspot samples collected in adulthood 40 years later were used as sources of DNA for the\nLTL assay. Conscientiousness was associated with longer LTL (p = .02). Controlling for age\ndid not account for this association. Controlling for education and physiological dysregula-\ntion partially attenuated the association, and the effect remained significant when account-\ning for differences in LTL across cultural groups. These results represent the first evidence\nthat childhood personality prospectively predicts LTL 40 years later in adulthood. Our find-\nings would be consistent with a mediation hypothesis whereby conscientiousness predicts\nlife paths and trajectories of health that are reflected in rates of LTL erosion across the\nlifespan.\n",

Mech-\nanisms linking conscientiousness to health are diverse and include health behaviors such as\nsmoking, physical activity, and diet [5]. Conscientiousness also operates on health outcomes\nvia social environmental factors, such as educational attainment [6], and socioeconomic status\n[7]. As a result, conscientiousness has the potential to offer a large cumulative health benefit\nacross multiple pathways, which may account for the now well-established association between\nconscientiousness and mortality [3]. Conscientiousness is related to patterns of states and\nbehaviors across a wide variety of health related domains, and as a result plays an important\nrole in models of successful aging [8].\nMany of the same mechanisms linking conscientiousness to health and mortality, including\nphysical activity, smoking, and educational attainment, have also been found to predict leuko-\ncyte telomere length (LTL) [9\u00ad12]. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures which cap the ends\nof chromosomes, maintaining their structural integrity and preventing end to end fusion [13].\nIn the absence of telomerase activity, telomeres shorten with each cell division [14]. Critically\nshort telomere length has been proposed as a mechanism leading to cell senescence or cell\ndeath [15]. As a result, LTL has been proposed as a marker of biological cell aging [16, 17].\nConsistent with this, shorter LTL is prospectively associated with mortality from cardiovascu-\nlar disease in elderly individuals [18, 19]. Evidence for LTL as causal mechanism in the aging\nprocess however is limited, and at the present time it is perhaps best viewed as a surrogate end-\npoint for cumulative cellular damage [20].\nBecause LTL is a cumulative outcome resulting from biological insults and stresses across\nmany years, dispositional traits, which may exert persistent effects on factors related to health,\nare expected to also be associated with LTL [21]. While this view is generally accepted, most of\nthe work to date focusing on dispositional characteristics and variation in LTL has focused on\nhealth damaging effects associated with depression [22], anxiety [23], and neuroticism [21] in\nthe context of stressful and traumatic life events [24]. In contrast, few studies have considered\nthat dispositional traits positively associated with health might be associated LTL. Despite a\nlarge body of work suggesting overlapping correlates across both conscientiousness and LTL,\nonly one recent study in Japanese medical students (mean age 23) has reported a cross sectional\nassociation between longer LTL and conscientiousness [25]. To our knowledge ours is the first\nstudy investigating a prospective association between conscientiousness in childhood and LTL\nin later life. Predicated on the notion that conscientiousness serves as a stable dispositional trait\nwhich increases the likelihood that individuals will participate in a variety of health promoting\nbehaviors and select into social environments that are conducive to health, we propose that\nconscientiousness will have a protective effect on LTL. Accordingly, we hypothesized that con-\nscientiousness will predict LTL prospectively, such that individuals higher on conscientious-\nness early in life will show longer LTL in adulthood. We present pilot results using data from\nthe ongoing Hawaii Personality and Health Study. A small number of stored dried blood sam-\nples out of a pool of approximately 800 available for testing were selected to validate our meth-\nods of DNA extraction and assaying LTL; we additionally planned to use these pilot data for an\ninitial test of the association between childhood conscientiousness and LTL. Previously we had\ndemonstrated that childhood conscientiousness predicts a global measure of physical dysregu-\nlation comprised of 11 objective biomarkers [26]. As LTL and physiological dysregulation may\nbe complimentary outcomes, we tested the degree to which childhood conscientiousness was\nassociated with LTL independent of physiological dysregulation. Because LTL has been dem-\nonstrated to vary across cultural and ethnic groups [27, 28], we additionally report on differ-\nences in LTL across ethnic and cultural groups and include this important variable in our\nanalyses.\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nStudy protocols for locating participants in adulthood, the adult clinic visit and for follow-up\nquestionnaires in adulthood were approved by the IRBs at both the Oregon Research Institute\nand the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Hawaii. Upon being contacted in\nadulthood, the participants included in these analyses gave consent for their childhood person-\nality data to be used as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Written consent was provided\nprior to the clinic visit in adulthood, and participants who agreed to provide blood samples\ngave additional written consent for these to be used for future genetic analyses. Prior to com-\npleting questionnaires in adulthood, all participants completed and returned written consent\nforms by mail.\nParticipants\nWe used existing data and stored dried blood spots from the Hawaii Longitudinal Personality\nand Health Study. This project began with teacher assessments of childhood personality\nteachers' personality assessments of all the children in their classrooms were obtained from ele-\nmentary schools on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Kauai (n = 2,418). The schools were geo-\ngraphically dispersed across these islands, and represented a wide range of socio-economic\nstatus (SES).\nBeginning in 1998, efforts were initiated to locate members of the original child cohort in\nadulthood [29]. Currently, 84% of the 2,320 available participants have been located. Of the\nagreed to participate in further research. Participants have completed several questionnaires\nadministered between 1999 and the present. Data from two questionnaires were used in this\nreport. Objective measures of physical health were collected as part of a clinic visit conducted\nat the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Hawaii in Honolulu, and also in clinics\non the islands of Kauai and Hawaii. Health assessments were conducted by qualified staff using\nstandard protocols, and included the collection of dried blood spots (see below for details). A\nparticipants agreed to provide dried blood samples. The average year of assessment was 2006;\napproximately 40 years after the childhood assessments. The mean age of the clinic sample\nat the time of assessment was 51 years. The full adult sample reflects the ethnic diversity of\nHawaii, and includes 44% Asian Americans, 22% Native Hawaiians or part Native Hawaiians,\n15% of European ancestry, and 11% of Filipino ancestry, 4% indicating \"other\", and 4% declin-\ning to respond.\nFinancial constraints limited the number of samples that could be tested in the pilot. To\nallow for the possibility of finding an association we performed this initial test of the hypothesis\nthat childhood levels of conscientiousness would predict adult LTL using an extreme groups\ndesign. LTL tends to differ across sexes, such that women tend to have longer telomeres at any\ngiven age [30]. Participants who were assessed in one school, the University of Hawaii Lab\nSchool (n = 78), were excluded because they were assessed using a different set of items in\nchildhood. Given the concern that sex difference could confound our findings, we elected to\nlimit the current study to only one sex. The pilot sample was selected from women rather than\nmen, and the choice of women instead of men was arbitrary. Fig 1 gives a flow diagram of the\nselection process for the pilot sample. The subsample for the current study was selected from\nthose adult women who had provided a dried blood spot during the clinic visit and had also\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nconsented to allow this material to be used for future genetic analyses (n = 323). We ranked\nthis subset of participants on childhood conscientiousness scores. Of these we selected the\n30 scoring highest, and the 30 scoring lowest on childhood conscientiousness. In terms of stan-\ndardized scores, this corresponded to cutoff points at 1.23 standard deviations above, and\n1.40 standard deviations bellow the mean for childhood conscientiousness.\nMeasures\nChildhood personality. For the sample included in our analyses, a common set of\n39 items across the samples was assessed across schools. Attributes were selected for their\nFig 1. Eligibility and selection of the pilot sample.\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nobservability and focus groups of teachers developed definitions for each item. For each child-\nhood item, teachers were presented with the definition and a list of their students' names. At\nthe end of the school year, teachers ranked every student in their class using a fixed nine-step\nquasi-normal distribution. Students were in grades 1, 2, 5 or 6. The majority of the sample,\nincluding all those in the pilot sample, were assessed on only one occasion in childhood. Exam-\nple items assessing childhood conscientiousness include Careful of personal belongings, Planful,\nand Persevering. Although the items were selected prior to the widespread acceptance of the\nBig Five model of personality, Big Five personality factors have been robustly identified in\nthese data, as is described in detail by Goldberg [31]. Of these, the conscientiousness scale dem-\nonstrates acceptable reliability with  = .77 [32]. The stability of personality traits tends to\nincrease with age [33]. For a subset of the child sample assessed on more than one occasion,\nconscientiousness demonstrated adequate one year stability for childhood traits with a test re-\ntest correlation of r = .53 [34]. Over long spans of time, personality traits are moderately stable.\nThe best available estimate for the expected stability of personality traits over a 40 year span\nderived from a meta-analysis of over 150 longitudinal studies of personality is moderate with\nan estimated correlation of r = .25 [33]. Conscientiousness demonstrates a level of stability in\nour full sample that is directly in line with this estimate. Across a variety of instruments used to\ncollect self-ratings of conscientiousness in adulthood and the teacher assessments in childhood,\nwe find a 40 year stability coefficient of r = .25 [34]. In more recent research, teacher ratings of\nconscientiousness in childhood converge with parent ratings at levels similar to that observed\nfor multiple observers rating adults they know well [35]. Moreover, childhood conscientious-\nness in the Hawaii study shows predictive validity with respect to outcomes decades later in\nadulthood including educational attainment [5], the selection of occupational environments\n[36], health behaviors [5], and objectively measured physical health [26]. This provides strong\nevidence for the reliability and validity of the teacher assessments.\nAdult personality. As part of a mailed questionnaire, participants completed 120 items\nfrom the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP; items, scoring information, scale reliability,\nand convergent validity estimates available at http://ipip.ori.org.) designed to assess the Big\nFive personality factors [37]. Scores on conscientiousness were based on 24 items selected to\nreplicate the facet structure of the NEO-PI-R [38] conscientiousness scale. Participants rated\nthese on a 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (a lot like me) scale. Adult conscientiousness scores were\nthe sum of these 24 items. Reliability of the IPIP-NEO conscientiousness scale is excellent ( =\n.90), and the scale shows high convergence with the corresponding NEO-PI-R scale (r = .80).\nThe NEO-PI-R is one of the most widely used measures of the Five Factor model and has estab-\nlished reliability and validity [38]. Similarly the IPIP-NEO has demonstrated concurrent and\ncriterion validity [39, 40]. Recent reports linking IPIP-NEO conscientiousness measured in\nadulthood to health behaviors [41], objective health outcomes [42], and mortality [43] further\nsupport the validity of the measure. Ten participants in the pilot sample failed to complete and\nreturn the adult personality assessment.\nDemographics. Demographic variables including date of birth, sex, self-identified culture,\nand educational attainment were assessed by questionnaire. Educational attainment was mea-\nsured on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (eighth grade or less) to 9 (postgraduate or professional\ndegree). Five participants did not respond to the educational attainment item.\nParticipants self-selected their own cultural identity from 12 options, and were instructed\nto select the one cultural group that they most identified with in cases where individuals identi-\nfied with more one group. For the current analyses, cultural groups were collapsed into five\ngroups: Caucasian (n = 10), Asian American (n = 21), Hawaiian/part Hawaiian (n = 9), Filipino\n(n = 11), and other (n = 4). Three participants in the pilot sample declined to indicate their cul-\ntural identity.\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nWe performed a series of chi-square goodness of fit tests in order to evaluate whether the\nobserved proportions for cultural groups in pilot sample, and in the selected extreme groups\n(both high and low) differed from the sample from which these were drawn (n = 323). The pro-\nportion of participants in each cultural group did not differ in the pilot sample (2 = 7.34,\nconscientiousness group (2 = 9.25, df = 5, p = .100) when compared to the proportions\nobserved in the sample from which these were drawn (n = 323).\nSmoking. Lifetime history of smoking behavior was assessed via questionnaire. Pack\nyears, defined as smoking one pack a day for one year, were derived from these. To create a\nsmoking variable incorporating cumulative pack years with current smoking status, partici-\npants' self-reported smoking histories were coded into a five point scale based on the distribu-\ntion of smoking history in the full sample (0 =  100 cigarettes smoked, 1 = previously\nsmoked < 8 pack- years, 2 = previously smoked  8 pack years, 3 = currently smoke  \u00bd pack a\nday, 4 = currently smoke > \u00bd pack a day). Eight participants provided incomplete smoking\ndata.\nPhysical activity. Three questionnaire items assessed strenuous, moderate, and mild phys-\nical activity via questionnaire. Participants were asked to rate their activities over a typical\nseven day period in the past year, including only activities lasting 15 minutes or more. For each\nitem, a list of example activities was provided. Frequency for each item was rated on a five\npoint scale (0 = zero times, 1 = one or two times, 2 = three or four times, 3 = five or six times,\n4 = seven or more times). Scores on these three items were aggregated by a weighted sum. Four\nparticipants failed to complete these items. Twelve additional participants were administered a\nshortened questionnaire that did not include the physical activity items.\nBMI. Height and weight were recorded as part of the clinic visit using a stadiometer and a\nbalance beam scale. Scores for BMI were calculated using the standard formula (kg/m2).\nPhysiological dysregulation. Global health status was indexed using an aggregate score of\n11 clinical indicators assessed during the clinic visit. These are systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsure (measured twice and averaged), HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/LDL ratio, fasting tri-\nglycerides, fasting blood glucose, body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, urine protein (log\ntransformed), and whether or not the participant was using prescription drugs for cholesterol\nor blood pressure.\nParticipants arrived at the clinic in a fasting state. Blood from a venous arm draw, as well as\nurine samples, were collected and immediately sent for lab analysis. Waist circumference was\nmeasured at the point midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. Measures of hip cir-\ncumference were made at the point where the gluteal muscle showed the greatest protrusion.\nBlood pressure was measured after five minutes of rest in a seated position using a sphygmo-\nmanometer. Two measures were taken with a one minute interval.\nMeasures were scored such that higher scores corresponded to worse health. For some bio-\nmarkers, scores at either extreme can be unhealthy. We evaluated the number of participants\nin the full sample falling into the low/unhealthy range for each biomarker, and found that in all\ncases less than 1.2% met this criterion. Each measure was standardized and converted to a devi-\nation score from the mean. The 11 biomarkers were not highly correlated with each other, and\nfactor analysis did not reveal a single factor solution. Following recommendations for aggregat-\ning uncorrelated indicators [44] we constructed an index by summing standardized scores,\nsuch that higher scores corresponded to greater physiological dysregulation, and worse health.\nParticipant in the full sample who had more than 3 biomarkers missing were not scored on\ndysregulation. Of the participants included in the pilot sample, all but one had complete data\non the dysregulation measure, and one participant was missing 3 biomarkers. More detail on\nthe derivation of the physiological dysregulation scale can be found in Hampson, et al. [26].\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nLeukocyte telomere length. During the clinic visit, blood from a venous arm draw\nfor long-term preservation of dried blood and nucleic acids for quantitative DNA analysis. Fol-\nlowing the manufacturer's instructions, the dried blood spots were air dried, placed in plastic\nbags with an appropriate desiccant, and stored in the dark at room temperature. Specimens for\nthe current study were identified, then shipped overnight in a room temperature-controlled\nbox to Dr. C\u00f4t\u00e9's lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Researchers who assayed\nthe samples remained blind to all participant data. Six 2mm punches were removed from each\nblood spot. DNA was extracted from these punches using QIA Amp kit on a QIA Cube (QIA-\nGEN), and LTL was assayed using qPCR following methods described by Cawthon [45] which\nhave been modified and recently extended for use on dried blood spot samples [46]. Samples\nwere assayed in duplicate, on two 96-well plates, using the undiluted DNA extracted from the\ndried blood spots. The DNA concentrations ranged from 3 to 7 ng/L. The standard curve was\nbuilt from a serial dilution of human genomic DNA pooled from frozen whole blood from 24\nhealthy donors. Three internal controls (one DNA from a human cell line, one from pooled\ngenomic DNA, and the other from a single volunteer) were included in each run and used for\nquality control related to the Lightcycler run; these were not used to normalize, and their T/S\nratio was not incorporated into the standard curve. All samples were amplified successfully\nand met our quality control criteria. All runs had a PCR efficiency between 1.88 (94%) and\n1.95 (97.5%). The intra-run (n-12) coefficient of variation (CV) for this assay is 5%, and based\non the internal control included in each of the 22 runs performed, the inter-run CV was 8.5%.\nThe assay produces an arbitrary count for telomeric DNA (T), and for a specific single copy\nnuclear gene DNA (S). The ratio of these (T/S) was then used as a measure of average relative\nLTL. We previously showed that DBS LTL is highly correlated with whole blood LTL [46].\nStatistical Analysis\nSPSS version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Group comparisons were evaluated using t-\ntests and ANOVAs. Standardized group differences were estimated using Cohen's d. Tests of\nnormality were conducted using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic. Non-parametric tests were con-\nducted using a Mann-Whitney U test. Effect sizes were estimated by Pearson correlations,\nbiserial correlation, and partial biserial correlations where appropriate, and all significance\ntests ( = .05) were two tailed. To maximize the sample size, all analyses employed pairwise\ndeletion in the presence of missing data, hence sample size varied across analyses.\nResults\nInitial examination of the distribution of the study variables revealed two extreme outliers,\neach with LTL exceeding 3.5 standard deviations above the mean. The two dried blood spots\nused for DNA extraction for these participants had been stored on filter paper designed for\nneonatal blood samples rather than the Whatman micro cards used for the rest of the sample.\nBecause these LTL measurements seemed implausible, and the difference could be attributed\nto the difference in filter paper, they were excluded from our main analysis. Table 1 provides\ndescriptive information on the full sample from which the subsample was drawn, as well as the\nhigh and low childhood conscientiousness groups after removing the two extreme outliers, one\nfrom each group. The subsample (n = 58) did not differ from the full sample (n = 323) on any\nof the variables tested, and LTL was normally distributed (W = .96, p = .09). Consistent with\nour previous work with the Hawaii cohort, higher childhood conscientiousness was associated\nwith higher educational attainment [5], lower BMIs, and healthier (lower) levels of overall\nphysiological dysregulation [26]. The high and low childhood conscientiousness groups did\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nnot differ with respect to age at the time of the childhood assessment, or at the time of the\nblood draw in adulthood. The two groups did not differ in levels of adult conscientiousness,\nsmoking, or physical activity levels. Due to the use of an extreme groups design based on\nchildhood conscientiousness, childhood conscientiousness was not normally distributed (W =\n.81, p < .00). Because of this, associations with childhood conscientiousness were estimated using\nbiserial correlations. The correlation between childhood conscientiousness and adult conscien-\ntiousness was similar in magnitude to that observed in our full sample (r = .19, p = .20, n = 48).\nThe correlation was not significant at the level of p = .05, likely due the small sample size.\nA t-test to evaluate differences in LTL between the two groups was significant (t = 2.38,\ndf = 56; p = .02), such that adult women who had been described by their teachers as higher on\nconscientiousness 40 years earlier had longer LTL (Cohen's d = .62). This difference is illus-\ntrated in Fig 2. We obtained a similar result using a non-parametric test including the two\nTable 1.

Correlations of study variables with LTL.\nn r p value\n*Biserial correlation reported for child conscientiousness and LTL\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nthese variables may account for some portion of the association between childhood conscien-\ntiousness and LTL, we report the partial biserial correlations between childhood conscientious-\nness and LTL controlling in turn for age, physiological dysregulation, educational attainment,\nadult conscientiousness, smoking, BMI, and physical activity separately in Table 3. We con-\ntrasted these with the raw biserial correlation between childhood conscientiousness and LTL\nreported in Table 2. Controlling for age did not attenuate the raw biserial correlation, likely\ndue to the narrow age range in the sample. Similarly, controlling for adult conscientiousness\nhad no appreciable effect. Partial biserial correlations controlling for physiological dysregula-\ntion and educational attainment tended to attenuate the association. In the case of educational\nattainment, the partial biserial correlation failed to reach significance (r = .27, p = .05). Sepa-\nrately controlling for smoking, BMI, and physical activity attenuated the association between\nchildhood conscientiousness and LTL in adulthood in a similar manner.\nTo evaluate the degree to which LTL might vary across cultural groups, we used a one-way\nANOVA. We found differences in LTL across groups, F(4, 50) = 3.27, p = .02. A post hoc analy-\nsis using Tukey's HSD test revealed that individuals who described themselves as Native\nHawaiian tended to have shorter LTL in comparison to all other groups (p < .05), with the\nexception of those classified as other.

There was no significant interaction between ethnicity and childhood\nconscientiousness.\nWe additionally tested a series of one-way ANOVAs in order to evaluate the degree to\nwhich study variables might have differed across cultural groups.

Our findings suggest that childhood conscientiousness\nassessed by teachers predicts LTL 40 years later in adulthood.\nTable 3.

The association remained significant when controlling for age and dysregulation,\nbut failed to reach significance when controlling for educational attainment, smoking, BMI, or\nphysical activity. While the partial biserial correlation was not significant in this case, the\ndegree to which the observed association was attenuated was small. While it is tempting to\nview the transition of significant to non-significant as meaningful, this does not constitute a\nformal test of mediation [47]. Partialing out adult conscientiousness slightly increased the\nobserved biserial correlation (r = .32 versus r = .30). This difference is likely due to sampling\nerror and the smaller sample size available for this analysis (n = 45). Partialing out physical\nactivity similarly increased the magnitude of the observed biserial correlation slightly, although\nin this case the effect was no longer significant (r = .32, p = .05), which is likely attributable to\nthe reduction in sample size due to missing data on physical activity (n = 43). We found signifi-\ncant variation in LTL across ethnic groups, such that those identifying as native Hawaiian\ntended to have the shortest LTL. Both childhood conscientiousness and cultural group identity\nindependently predicted LTL with no evidence of an interaction.\nThese results suggest a novel pathway linking dispositional traits in childhood to cumulative\nhealth that has not previously been incorporated into research on LTL. Childhood personality\ntraits have moderate to low levels of stability across the life-course. Our best estimates of the\nrank order stability of conscientiousness over 40 years corresponds to a correlation of r = .25\n[32, 33]. Both trait level conscientiousness and cognitive features of self-regulation develop and\nimprove from childhood to young adulthood [48]. Despite this, childhood conscientiousness\npredicts outcomes in adulthood including physical health, substance use, career attainment,\nand financial outcomes [5, 37, 49]. In the broader context of lifespan development, LTL com-\nplements the growing list of consequential objective outcomes in adulthood associated with\nchildhood conscientiousness.\nWe did not find an association between adult levels of conscientiousness and LTL. This\nmust be due in part reality that selecting on child conscientiousness for an extreme groups\ndesign magnifies effects for childhood conscientiousness but, given the moderate stability of\nthe trait over 40 years, does not necessarily do so for adult conscientiousness. Sadahiro et al.\n[25] reported a cross sectional association between conscientiousness and LTL in a sample of\nyoung adults at an age intermediate to the two points of personality assessment in our sample.\nIt is possible that conscientiousness assessed at different points in the lifespan may show associ-\nations of differing magnitudes with respect to LTL.\nPersonality and health researchers investigate models of the underlying psychosocial and\nbiological processes that mediate associations between personality traits and health outcomes\nover the lifespan [50]. LTL assessed in adulthood has several advantages as an objective mea-\nsure of health status when studying these models: LTL can reflect cumulative insults, changes\ndynamically over time, and can be readily measured. These features, along with demonstra-\ntions that biological stressors, physical morbidity, and subjective states of distress predict LTL,\nsuggest that LTL may be viewed as a psychobiomarker [51]. As such, LTL offers an outcome\nvariable that reflects the accumulation of health effects associated with numerous psychosocial\nand demographic variables. An important next step for lifespan developmental researchers\ninvolves evaluating the degree to which associations with childhood conscientiousness operate\nindependently of adult trait levels and if so, whether these depend entirely on chains of events\nfollowing from child trait levels and self-regulatory capacities. In models of effects related to\nhealth and aging, LTL may play a unique role as an integrative objective outcome.\nParticular strengths of the current study are the use of a prospective design with a 40 year\ninterval, and the well-executed assessment of child personality. Although these are preliminary\nPersonality Predicts Telomere Length\nresults, they are consequential in suggesting future directions and methods for incorporating\nLTL research into lifespan developmental models of dispositional traits related to health. Con-\nsistent with a lifespan mediation hypothesis, we found that controlling for potential mediators\ntended to attenuate the strength of association between childhood conscientiousness and LTL.\nThe current study has specific limitations. An extreme groups design was selected to\nenhance our ability to detect an association between childhood conscientiousness and LTL in a\npreliminary sample. However, extreme groups designs do not necessarily produce accurate\nestimates of effect sizes and tend to inflate effects sizes associated with the selection variable. As\na result the raw biserial correlation between childhood conscientiousness and LTL is likely\ninflated. Similarly, effect sizes for variables correlated with the selection variable can be dis-\ntorted. In our analyses, partial biserial correlations controlling for variables associated with\nchildhood conscientiousness are likely to be overcorrected. We might expect the true effect size\nof this effect to be reduced in magnitude in a larger sample. We have secured funding to assay\ntelomere length in our larger sample, and in the future we will test this directly. Additionally,\nour small sample did not allow us to test multiple competing predictors, account for confound-\ning variables, or test mediation hypotheses. We limited our sample to women, because there is\nevidence that LTL differs across genders. As a result, our results cannot be generalized to men.\nOur pilot sample is unlikely to give accurate estimates of effects related to cultural group and\nthese results need to be interpreted with caution. Despite this limitation, our results do suggest\nthe importance of investigating differences in LTL across cultural and ethnic groups, and for\ncontrolling for these effects when investigating predictors of LTL. Future analyses using our\nfull sample will allow us to accurately evaluate effects across cultural groups. For all of these\nreasons, we view the present results as preliminary. Finally, we measured LTL using a qPCR-\nbased assay which may have a higher variability than some other methods but is the appropri-\nate option given the type of sample studied here and the large number of samples to be assayed\nin the future.\nDespite these limitations, the finding of a putative association between childhood conscien-\ntiousness and adult LTL is remarkable. There is a paucity of research linking personality at any\nstage in the life course to biomarkers of health; more so for childhood personality traits. Our\nresults suggest a variety of future directions involving lifespan developmental trajectories of\ndispositional traits, physical health, and LTL. In addition to providing a more accurate estimate\nof the effect size of the associations presented here, future research will allow for testing lifespan\nmediation models where behavioral and environmental mechanisms can be evaluated as expla-\nnations of prospective associations between personality traits and LTL. Pathways such as\nsmoking, physical activity, and diet may explain associations between dispositional traits in\nchildhood and LTL years later. Joint or interactive effects of personality traits and sex, socio-\neconomic status, and ethnicity may further explain variability in LTL.\n"
