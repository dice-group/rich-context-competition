The resistance rate of Staphylococcus\nto penicillin was 100% and that to erythromycin was 90.69%. There were varying degrees\nof resistance to other drugs, but no single strain had vancomycin resistance.

As a result, standard\ntreatments become ineffective, infections per-\nsist, and infections may become severe and\ncan also spread to others.1 Antimicrobial\nresistance is an internationally documented\nthreat to health.2 Bacterial infections that are\nresistant to antibiotics can limit the availabil-\nity of effective treatment options, rendering\nsome commonly encountered bacterial infec-\ntions challenging to treat.3 Antibiotic-\nresistant infections are also twice as likely to\nbe associated with greater morbidity and\nmortality and are associated with increased\nhealthcare costs.4 Antibiotics are a keystone\nfor treating bacterial infections and children\nreceive these drugs more frequently than any\nother class of medication. However, inappro-\npriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics\nin the past decades has increased the emer-\ngence of resistant bacterial strains.5 Children\nreceive a lot of primary healthcare services,\nand as such, receive an excessively high\nnumber of antibiotics compared with\nmiddle-aged populations.6 Children are also\nmajor drivers of infection within commu-\nnities and can contribute to the spread of\nbacteria from person to person.7 Nearly 80%\nof childhood cases of urinary tract infection\nin poorer countries are resistant to amoxicil-\nlin, and 60% are resistant to co-amoxiclav.\nMore than a quarter of children are resistant\nto ciprofloxacin (Cipro), and 17% to nitro-\nfurantoin.8 All of the above-mentioned\nfactors require clinicians to be responsible\nfor a correct diagnosis and treatment for\naffected children as soon as possible to avoid\nunnecessary disability and death. Despite\nthis, little research has been published\ndescribing the microbial spectrum and anti-\nmicrobial resistance profile of bacteria from\npaediatric patients in China. Therefore, an\nunderstanding of the pathogens and anti-\nbiotic resistance associated with paediatric\ninfections at our hospital and in nearby\nregions is necessary. In this study, we\nselected clinical data from patients who\nwere admitted to the Paediatric Department\nretrospective analysis of the distribution of\nbacterial species and changes in drug resist-\nance. This study aimed to determine the\nprofile and susceptibility patterns of bacterial\npathogens associated with infections in\npaediatric patients during 5 years.\nMaterials and methods\nSource of strains\nPathogens were isolated from specimens\nthat were collected from all children who\nwere admitted to Shenmu Hospital during\npatients and 154 female patients.\nEthics statement\nNon-routine procedures were used, and\nonly data regarding the results from culture\nand sensitivity of specimens were analysed\nretrospectively. Therefore, no consent was\nrequired from the patients' caregivers.\nBacteriological identification\nIsolation and culture of bacteria were car-\nried out according to the ``National Clinical\nPractice Guidelines''.9 Bacteria were identi-\nfied by the automatic bacteria analyser\nVITEK - 2 identification system and a\nmanual method.\nDrug sensitivity test\nThe fully automatic bacterial identifica-\ntion instrument VITEK - 2 MIC and the\nK-B (Kirby Bauer) Paper Slice diffusion\nmethod were used to test drug sensitivity.\nAntimicrobial impregnated absorbent paper\ndiscs were provided by Oxoid Company\n(UK) and Kangtai Company (China). Test\nmethods and criteria were performed\naccording to the latest standards of the\nAmerican CLSI (Clinical & Laboratory\nStandards Institute) Standards.10 The\nchoice of antimicrobials was as follows:\npenicillin (10 U), ampicillin (10 mg), pipera-\ncillin (100 mg), oxacillin (1 mg), ampicillin/\n(30 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), a high concen-\ntration of gentamicin (120 mg), ciprofloxacin\n(5 mg), vancomycin (30 mg), erythromycin\n(10 mg), imipenem (10 mg), sulfamethoxa-\naztreonam (30 mg). Mueller\u00adHinton\nmedium was used for drug sensitivity tests.\nM-H agar, supplemented with 5% defibri-\nnated sheep blood, was used for determining\nsensitivities of Streptococcus pneumoniae,\nStreptococcus pyogenes and other strepto-\ncoccus spp. Haemophilus spp. were used to\nsupplement the basic medium for culture\nof Haemophilus influenzae. The above-\nmentioned antimicrobial sensitivity paper\ndiscs and culture medium were provided by\nOxoid and Kang Tai Companies.\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains\nwere confirmed by the double-disc method.\nThe antimicrobials used were cefotaxime/\nclavulanic acid (30mg/10mg) and ceftazidime/\nclavulanic acid (30mg/10mg), both provided\nby Oxoid Company.\nQuality control strains\nShaanxi Provincial Clinical Laboratory.\nStatistical analysis\nVITEK - 2 identification system software\nwas used for analysis and processing of\nall of the original test data. IBM Statistics\nSPSS 21 Premium (Chicago, IL, USA) and\nGraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA)\nstatistical analysis software were used for the\nstatistical analysis.\nResults\nDistribution of specimens and strains\nstrains of pathogens were isolated from\nfemale patients. The Fisher\u00adIrwin test\nshowed a significant difference in the\nnumber of isolated strains between sexes\nthe time period into three quantum zones,\nspanning 20 months each, we found that the\nportion of male children steadily increased\n(9.6%) were older than 6 years. The average\nlength of stay in hospital was 6 days and the\ndays (Table 1).\nThe distribution of pathogens included\nmens, 26 cerebrospinal fluid specimens,\n24 urine specimens, and 11 faecal specimens\nstrains of Gram-negative cocci were\ndetected. The main five bacteria were\nEscherichia coli (9.94%), Klebsiella pneumo-\nniae (7.32%), coagulase-negative staphylo-\ncocci (9.94%), Staphylococcus aureus\ndetected. A significantly higher number of\npathogens were isolated from respiratory\nsecretion and blood compared with other\ndistribution ratio of pathogens is shown in\nTable 3. The distribution of pathogens\naccording to variety of specimens is shown\nin Table 4.\nDrug-resistant rate\nAmong common Gram-positive bacteria,\n16 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and\n27 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus\nwere isolated. The average resistance rate of\nStaphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus\nhaemolyticus against penicillin was 100%.\nAmong macrolides, the resistance rate of\nerythromycin was >80%, but no vancomy-\ncin-resistant staphylococci were found\n(Table 5). Among Gram-negative bacilli,\nthe Escherichia coli resistance rate for ampi-\ncillin and piperacillin was >80% while its\nresistance rate against first, second, third,\nand fourth generation cephalosporins was\nnearly 70%. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nresistance rate to ampicillin was 100%.\nTable 1. Demographic representation of the isolated pathogens.\nAge group, n (%)\nHospital stay (days)\nn \u00bc number.\nTable 2.

The\nresistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to\nlevofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, imi-\npenem, and meropenem was <10%, while\nits resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam was\n30%. Escherichia coli was not resistant to\nimipenem and meropenem (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nShenmu City coal mining has resulted in ser-\nious smoky air pollution, rendering the air\nquality poor. This has caused an enormous\nincrease in infections of the respiratory tract\nin hospitalized children.11 Thereis anupward\ntrend of yearly detection of pathogens, but\nthe overall number of pathogens that are\ndetected annually has decreased.12\nOur study showed that the main patho-\ngens of paediatric infection were Gram-\npositive bacteria, accounting for 35.07%,\nwhile Gram-negative bacteria accounted for\nThese numbers of infected pathogens are\nconsistent with most domestic reports.13\nThe predominance of Gram-negative bac-\nteria in hospital-acquired infections is prob-\nably due to the fact that patients are treated\nwith antimicrobial agents before admission.\nAdditionally, many individual clinics do\nnot perform allergy tests, and thus use\nmacrolides of which the main antimicrobial\nspectrum is of Gram-positive bacteria.14\nThis results in a low detection rate of\nGram-positive bacteria, while Gram-\nnegative bacteria have become predominant\nin examinations of pathogens in hospitalized\nTable 5.

Our study showed that detection of\ncoagulase-negative staphylococci infection\nwas highest among all hospital infections\nand its detection rate was much higher than\nthat of other bacteria. This finding is\nin accordance with previous studies.15 The\npathogenicity of coagulase-negative staphy-\nlococci is less than that of Staphylococcus\naureus. However, in the case of immuno-\ncompromised patients, infection may still\noccur, especially an increasingly growing\nresistance of these strains (e.g., methicillin-\nresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci),\nsuggesting that coagulase-negative staphy-\nlococci is an important nosocomial infection\npathogen.16 Monitoring in children shows\nis resistant to penicillin, while 100% of\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to\nvancomycin and rifampicin, which has\nimportant implications for treating penicil-\nlin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nOur 5-year study of paediatric infections\nalso showed that the main five Gram-\nnegative bacteria were Escherichia coli,\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,\nAcinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas\naeruginosa. This finding is consistent with\nthe international literature.17,18 Among\nGram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus hae-\nmolyticus is the most common, followed by\nStaphylococcus aureus.19 Fungal infection\nalso affects a large proportion of children,\nwith the main cause being Candida albicans.\nCommon Gram-negative bacilli show gen-\neral resistance against ampicillin and\nTable 6.

Because these two drugs show\nadverse reactions in children, their use in\nchildren is already limited.20 Our study\nshowed that sensitivity of Escherichia coli\nfor amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and\nnitrofurantoin was >90.0%. Sensitivity of\nKlebsiella pneumoniae to fluoroquinolones\nand amikacin was >92.0%. Pseudomonas\naeruginosa was 100% sensitive to ceftazi-\ndime, cefepime, amikacin, fluoroquinolone,\nand aztreonam. Enterobacter cloacae was\nalso highly sensitive to fluoroquinolones,\ncefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotaxime, and\namikacin. The resistance of Gram-negative\nbacilli to imipenem and meropenem is lower\nin Shenmu City than that of other regions in\nChina,21 which may be related to the strict\ncontrol of antimicrobial drug use in our\nhospital.\nOverall, the situation in Shenmu City\nregarding resistant paediatric pathogens is\nserious. There is an urgent need to strengthen\nmonitoring of the distribution of pathogens\nand bacterial resistance. Strict implementa-\ntion of antimicrobial management, and good\nuse of consultation and an approval system\nresulting in the rational use of antibiotics are\nalso required. At the same time, food and\ndrug supervision agencies and health admin-\nistrative departments should strengthen\nsupervision of antimicrobial drug purchase\nand strictly supervise prescription drugs,\nespecially in private clinics and drug retail\noutlets. Publicity on antibacterial drug health\neducation should be increased through print\nand social media to avoid pre-hospital, non-\nprescription, irrational use of antibiotics. In\nshort, prevention and control of bacterial\ndrug resistance in standard paediatric treat-\nment is an important task.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
