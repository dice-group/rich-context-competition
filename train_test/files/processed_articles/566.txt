Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \n \nCONSIDERABLE evidence points to the enjoyment of\nbetter health and quality of life among married older\nadults relative to their non-married peers (e.g., Bookwala &\nPowers, 2009). These advantages in health and quality of\nlife are likely to accrue at least partially from the benefits\nthat marriage can bring in the form of supportive ex-\nchanges between spouses, ongoing companionship, and\nemotional attachment (e.g., Allen, Blieszner, & Roberto,\n2004). Past research has shown that being in a better quality\nmarriage is directly related to superior quality of life in late\nadulthood (e.g., Antonucci, Lansford, & Akiyama, 2001;\nBookwala, in press; Bookwala, 2005; Bookwala & Jacobs,\nMore importantly, in the face of stressors, a good marriage\ncan serve as perhaps the most important resource of sup-\nport (Cutrona, 1996) by fostering responsiveness to a\nloved one's needs and acts that communicate caring and\nfacilitate adaptive coping with stress. Several studies ac-\ncordingly have confirmed that a better quality marriage can\nmitigate the negative impact of late life stressors on quality\nThe present study focuses on the impact of poor vision as\none such age-related stressor. Specifically, it examines the\nrole of a good marriage as a potential buffer in the adverse\nconsequences of poor vision in late life. Using vision assessed\nboth subjectively and objectively in a national probability-\nbased sample of adults aged 57\u00ad85 years, it examines the\nextent to which different aspects of marital quality (rela-\ntionship satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free\ntime spent with one's spouse) moderate the negative effects\nof poor vision on three specific indicators of quality of life:\nfunctional limitations, feelings of social isolation, and\ndepressive symptomatology. These indices are in keeping with\nthe World Health Organization's (1998) multidimensional\ndefinition of quality of life that incorporates individuals'\nphysical and social functioning and psychological states as\nkey components.\nImpact of Poor Vision\nVision-related problems are widely prevalent during the\nlate life years. Recent estimates obtained from the National\nHealth Interview Survey indicate that 17% of individuals\naged 65+ years reported having trouble with their vision\neven with corrective glasses and lenses (Federal Interagency\nForum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008). Vision-related\nproblems can have demonstrable adverse effects on the\nlives of older adults (e.g., Crews, 1994; Federal Interagency\nFor example, studies have found a link between vision-related\nMarital Quality as a Moderator of the Effects of\nPoor Vision on Quality of Life Among Older Adults\nJamila Bookwala\nDepartment of Psychology, Lafayette College, Pennsylvania.\nObjectives. This study assessed the moderating role of marital quality in the effects of subjective and objective vision\non functional limitations, social isolation, and depressive symptomatology.\nMethod. Data from 738 married older adults drawn from a probability-based representative sample of elders residing\nin the United States were used. Assessments included subjective and objective vision, marital quality variables (relation-\nship satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time spent with one's spouse), and three aspects of quality of life\n(functional limitations, social isolation, and depressive symptomatology).\nResults. Moderated regression analyses found that relationship satisfaction and supportive spouse behaviors moderated\nthe effects of poor self-reported vision on functional limitations and depressive symptoms and the effects of poor visual\nacuity on functional limitations. As hypothesized, poorer vision was unrelated to functional limitations and depressive\nsymptoms in more satisfying marriages but predicted higher levels of both outcomes in less satisfying marriages.\nContrary to expectations, higher levels of supportive spouse behaviors were associated with more functional limitations\nin respondents who reported poorer subjective and objective vision.\nDiscussion. A marriage that is highly satisfying can mitigate the adverse effects of poor vision on functional limitations\nand depressive symptomatology in late life. The moderating role of supportive spouse behaviors in the link between poor\nvision and quality of life is less intuitive, however. Whereas relationship satisfaction may operate as a traditional buffer in\nthe context of poor vision, supportive spouse behaviors may increase in response to or be ineffective in this context.\nKey Words: Marital quality--Moderation--Quality of life--Self-reported vision--Visual acuity.\nBOOKWALA\nproblems and global measures of subjective well-being and\nlife satisfaction in a variety of samples. Wahl, Schilling,\nOswald, and Heyl (1999) observed that greater visual\nimpairment was related to lower subjective well-being in a\nsample of older adults recruited through physician prac-\ntices. Bourque, Leger, Pushkar, and Beland (2007) reported\nthat poor vision was related to lower life satisfaction in a\nrepresentative sample of older Canadians, and Reinhardt\n(1996) found a similar relationship in a convenience sample\nof visually impaired older adults.\nIn terms of more specific aspects of quality of life,\nconsistent with the World Health Organization's (1998)\ndefinition of the construct, O'Donnell (2005) has described\nthe challenges associated with poor vision in late life to be\nthreefold involving functional limitations, losses in social\ninteractions, and increases in depressive symptomatology.\nThese challenges also are in keeping with the disablement\nprocess model (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), according to\nwhich limitations in physical functioning and difficulty in\nperforming day-to-day activities are likely consequences in\nthe face of impairment in domains such as visual function.\nMoreover, the activity restriction model (Williamson &\nthat limitations in functioning (both physical and social)\nand depressive symptomatology are likely adverse conse-\nquences older adults experience in the face of late life stress-\nors, and this model is applicable to the context of poor vision\n(Bookwala & Lawson, 2011). Several studies accordingly\nhave examined the effects of poor vision on functional levels,\nsocial relationships, and depressive symptoms.\nPerhaps the most widely examined effect of poor vision\nis difficulty in the ability to carry out day-to-day physical\nactivities, and studies consistently have found evidence for\nadverse effects (Crews, Jones, & Kim, 2006; Gunnel &\nSternberg, 1992; Travis, Boerner, Reinhardt, & Horowitz,\nwriting, and watching television were common functional\nproblems associated with poor vision. In addition, mobility-\nrelated problems, such as difficulty with moving about out-\ndoors, driving or using public transportation, and conducting\nbank-related business were commonly reported in their\nvisually impaired elderly sample. Travis and colleagues\n(2004) found that older adults with impaired vision reported\nhigher levels of difficulty with instrumental activities of\ndaily living (e.g., selecting/locating and identifying cloth-\ning, food items, and money; using a telephone; writing\nchecks; and taking medications) and that these individuals\nidentified these visual problems rather than other health\nproblems as the source of these difficulties. Crews and col-\nleagues (2006) also found that older adults who reported\nvisual impairment were more likely to report difficulty per-\nforming everyday tasks such as walking, climbing steps,\nand shopping relative to their age-matched peers. In addi-\ntion to contributing to limitations in physical function,\nresearchers propose that poor vision can have an adverse\nimpact on a wide range of social functioning domains\nincluding social network size, relationship maintenance, and\nsocial integration (O'Donnell, 2005; Reinhardt, Boerner, &\nstudies have found that poor vision is correlated with lower\nlevels of social integration (Femia, Zarit, & Johansson, 2001),\nmore difficulty engaging in social relationships (Crews et al.,\n2006), and higher levels of social isolation (Femia et al.,\n2001). Finally, greater depressed affect is commonly associ-\nated with poor vision. Lupsakko, Mantyjarvi, Kautiainen,\nand Sulkava (2002) found that higher levels of depressive\nsymptomatology (but not clinical depression) occurred in a\npopulation-based sample of older adults relative to their non-\nimpaired peers, and Crews and colleagues reported that mild or\nmoderate levels of depressive symptoms are a common comor-\nbid condition among elders who are visually impaired.\nNumerous other studies also have found that older adults who\nrated their vision to be poorer had higher levels of depressive\nsymptomatology in convenience and probability-based sam-\nples (e.g., Brody et al., 2001; Casten, Rovner, & Edmonds,\nBuffering Role of Marital Relationships\nDespite the link that has been reported widely in the liter\nature between poor vision and quality of life outcomes,\nolder adults are not uniform in their experience of adverse\noutcomes associated with poor vision. Social support\ntheory (see Cohen, 2004) suggests that good quality rela-\ntionships can offer a critical resource in adapting to life\nstressors; this is especially the case during the late life years\n1988). According to social support theory, supportive and\nsatisfying relationships can enhance quality of life both\ndirectly as well as via their buffering role in the face of per-\nsonal challenges and stressors (Cohen, 2004). Specifically\nin the domain of adaptation to poor vision, several studies\nhave documented that support from family members and\nfriends can play a key role (e.g., Horowitz, 2004; McIlvane &\nfound evidence for the direct contribution of support from\nboth friends and family (siblings, children, and other close\nrelatives) to lower depressive symptomatology and higher\nlife satisfaction among visually impaired elders. In the same\nsample of visually impaired older adults, McIlvane and\nReinhardt (2001) also found evidence for the buffering role\nof social support. Relative to visually impaired older adults\nwho reported lower levels of social support from family\nand friends, those who enjoyed higher support from these\nsources experienced lower depressive symptomatology.\nA particular type of personal relationship that has been\nlargely overlooked, however, in terms of its potential capacity\nto mitigate the adverse impact of poor vision in late life is\nthe resource of a close marital relationship. The spousal\nrelationship has been identified as playing an especially\nimportant role in health and well-being during the late\nadulthood years (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001; Bookwala,\nenhance broader social functioning by fostering larger so-\ncial networks (Bookwala & Fekete, 2009). When com-\npared with other types of relationships, a good quality\nmarriage also shows a stronger link to better psychologi-\ncal well-being as assessed by negative affect, depressive\nsymptomatology, life satisfaction, and self-esteem (Birditt\nwe know from previous studies that the spousal relation-\nship can play an important role in modifying the impact\nof life stressors on specific quality of life indicators\nThe general pattern of findings shows that a good quality\nmarriage buffers the stress-outcome association in mid-\nand late life. For example, Mancini and Bonnano (2006)\nfound that greater marital closeness moderated the nega-\ntive impact of physical disability on older adults' depres-\nsive symptoms, anxiety levels, and self-esteem. Likewise,\nTower and colleagues (1997) found that a close marriage\nbuffers the stress-related outcomes of living with a spouse\nwho is cognitively impaired or depressed. Bookwala and\nFranks also found that greater marital disagreement exacer-\nbates the link between physical disability and depressive\nsymptomatology.\nThe Current Study\nThe present study hypothesized that a marriage of\ngood quality will buffer the negative impact of poor vision\n(assessed both subjectively and objectively) on quality of\nlife among older adults. As described earlier, poorer vision\nhas been found to be linked to more functional limitations,\nfeelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatol-\nogy. The availability of a spouse with whom one shares a\nsatisfying relationship, who engages in supportive be-\nhaviors, and with whom recreational time is spent can be\nexpected to play a protective role for visually impaired\nelders. Thus, a marital relationship marked by these\ncharacteristics would buffer the negative effects of poor\nvision whereby, relative to their peers in lower quality\nmarriages, older adults with poorer vision who were in\nbetter marriages would experience fewer functional lim-\nitations, feelings of social isolation, and symptoms of\ndepression. Data to test this hypothesis were drawn\nfrom the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project\n(NSHAP; O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, & Smith, 2009; S.\nSmith et al., 2009), a survey-based study of a nationally\nrepresentative sample of older adults residing in the United\nStates.\nMethod\nSample\nThe sample consisted of older adults who participated in\nthe NSHAP (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009; S. Smith et al.,\n2009). The NSHAP is a large-scale survey study that as-\nsessed components of health, social relationships, and well-\nbeing in older adults aged 57\u00ad85 years using face-to-face\nand self-administered questionnaires. The NSHAP data\nidentified as part of a larger national area probability sample\nof households (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009). The NSHAP\nsample was balanced on age and gender subgroups and\noversampled African Americans and Latinos. The NSHAP\nof its original sample (N = 3,005) to receive the objective\nvision assessment. For the present study, eligible cases\nincluded all NSHAP respondents whose vision was objec-\ntively assessed and were married or living with a partner at\nthe time of data collection (N = 927). Of these eligible\nrespondents, those who had no missing data on the study\nvariables were included in the current analysis yielding a\nrespondents). On average, respondents were 68 years of age\nThe majority of the sample had at least a high school\ndiploma or equivalent (82.4%, N = 608) with about one fourth\nof the sample holding a bachelor's degree or higher (N = 188).\nSlightly more than three quarters of the sample described\nand 2.7% (N = 20) as other. All respondents were married\n(In the remainder of the document, the term spouse is used\nto refer collectively to the spouse and cohabiting partner.)\nMeasures\nVision.--Self-reported vision (subjective vision) was\nassessed in the NSHAP using a single-item measure with a\n5-point rating scale (Schumm et al., 2009). Self-report single-\nitem measures of vision have been used successfully in other\nstudies such as the Berlin Aging Study (J. Smith, Fleeson,\nGeiselmann, Settersten, & Kunzmann, 1999) and the Canadian\nAging in the Community Study (see Bourque et al., 2007).\nNSHAP respondents were asked to rate their eyesight\nusing the item \"With your glasses or contact lenses if you\nwear them, is your eyesight poor, fair, good, very good, or\nexcellent?\" Responses were recoded such that higher\nscores represented poorer self-reported vision (M = 2.43,\n46%) rated their own vision to be poor, fair, or good. The\nremaining respondents rated their vision to be very good or\nexcellent (N = 398, 53.9%). Visual acuity (objective vision)\nwas assessed in both eyes together at a distance of 3 m using\nBOOKWALA\na chart with Sloan optotypes manufactured by Precision\nNSHAP interviewers were trained to follow a detailed pro-\ntocol to ensure consistent distance from the chart (via use of\na premeasured string laid out on the floor), line of sight (the\ninterviewer seated the respondent and held the chart at the\nrespondent's eye level), and lighting (sufficient light for\nreading with low glare or strong backlighting). Respondents\nwho normally wore glasses or contact lenses for driving or\ndistance vision were instructed to wear them during the test\nand asked to begin reading the smallest discernible line.\nSuccess or not on this task resulted in the respondent being\ninstructed to read the successive line directly below or\nabove the just-read line, respectively, until the smallest\ndiscernible line successfully read was determined. Perfor-\nmance on the visual acuity test was coded on a continuum\nusing standard guidelines (Schumm et al., 2009), whereby\n20/20 vision or better was coded as \"normal or better\" vision,\n\"moderately decreased\" vision, and worse than 20/60 was\ncoded as \"poor\" vision. Respondents who were unable to\nread the largest line on the Sloan chart at 3 m represented\nwere coded to have a score of 20/200 or poor vision. Scores\nin the sample ranged from normal or better (0) to poor (3)\nvisual acuity test, 18.8% (N = 139) had normal or better vi-\n(N = 33) scored in the poor vision range.\nMarital quality.--The present study used NSHAP assess-\nments of three domains of marital quality: relationship\nsatisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time\nspent with one's spouse. Marital researchers have under-\nscored the importance of measuring different domains of\nand prior research shows that different aspects of marriage\nhave differential relationships to physical and mental health\nindicators (e.g., Bookwala, 2005; Bookwala & Franks,\nThe three aspects of marital relationships were assessed via\nsix items available in the NSHAP data. [The six marital\nquality items were factor analyzed using principal compo-\nnents analysis with varimax (orthogonal) rotation. A three-\nfactor extraction was requested representing the three\ndomains. The results of the orthogonal rotation yielded an\ninterpretable three-factor solution that collectively ex-\nplained 74.624% of the variance for the set of six variables\non Factor 1 that was labeled relationship satisfaction: items\nmeasuring relationship happiness (factor loading = .692);\nemotional satisfaction (factor loading = .855); and physical\npleasure (factor loading = .864). Two items loaded on Factor\n2, labeled supportive spouse behaviors: items measuring fre-\nquency of relying on the spouse (factor loading = .800)\nand opening up to the spouse (factor loading = .806). Factor\n3, labeled free time spent with the spouse, had a single item\nload on that assessed preference for spending free time (fac-\ntor loading = .984). All items loaded on a single factor and\nare described in detail below.] Relationship satisfaction was\nassessed by respondents rating (a) their relationship with\ntheir spouse \"taking all things together\" using a 7-point\nscale ranging from 1 = very unhappy to 7 = very happy, (b)\nhow physically pleasurable they considered the relationship\nto be with the spouse (5-point scale ranging from 0 = not at\nall to 4 = extremely), and (c) how emotionally satisfying\nthey found the relationship to be (5-point scale ranging\nfrom 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely). Mean responses were\ncomputed across the three items such that higher scores\nreflected greater relationship satisfaction (M = 4.12, SD\n= 0.82; Cronbach's a = .75). Supportive spouse behaviors\nwas measured using two items where respondents rated\nhow often they could rely on their spouse and open up to\ntheir spouse. Responses were made using a 3-point scale\nranging from 1 = hardly ever (or never) to 3 = often. Mean\nresponses across the two items were computed such that\nhigher scores represented more supportive spouse behaviors\nwas assessed using a single item that asked if the respondent\nliked to spend free time doing things together with their\nspouse or doing things separately. Responses made on a\n3-point scale (1 = together, 2 = some together and some dif-\nferent, and 3 = different/separate things) were dichotomized\nin keeping with NSHAP-based research that has used this\nvariable (Brown & Kawamura, 2011); responses were dum-\nmy-coded into 0 (responses of some together and some dif-\nferent and different/separate things) or 1 (together).\nspend free time doing things together with their spouse,\nwhereas the remaining responded that they liked to do some\nthings together and some different or that they liked to do\nFunctional limitations was assessed using nine items on\nwhich respondents reported how much difficulty they had\nrelated to walking (e.g., walking a street block, walking\nacross a room), self-care activities (e.g., dressing, eating,\nusing the toilet, bathing or showering, getting in and out of\nbed), and driving (e.g., driving during the day, driving at\nnight). Responses were made on a 4-point scale using codes\nranging from 1 to 4 (no difficulty, some difficulty, much\ndifficulty, and unable to do). Activities that had never been\nperformed were scored as no difficulty; for the driving\nitems, if respondents indicated that they no longer drove,\nthe response was coded as unable to do. Responses to the\nnine items were summed such that higher scores repre-\nsented greater difficulty in performing daily functions (or\nlimitations, feelings of social isolation, and depressive\nsymptoms. The quality of older adults' marital relationship\nwas uncorrelated with objectively assessed vision, whereas\nbetter self-rated vision was related to higher relationship\nsatisfaction and more supportive spouse behaviors.\nBaron and Kenny's (1986) approach for testing moderator\nmodels was used to assess the protective role of marital\nquality in the link between poorer vision and the three indi-\ncators of quality of life, functional limitations, feelings of\nsocial isolation, and depressive symptomatology. Two sepa-\nrate moderated regression models were tested for each\nindicator of quality of life using the SPSS 17.0 statistical\nsoftware package; one model tested the moderating role of\nmarital quality in the effects of self-reported (subjective)\nvision controlling for visual acuity (objective vision) and\nthe second tested the same in the effects of objective vision\ncontrolling for subjective vision. Each model introduced\nsociodemographic (control) variables on Step 1, self-reported\nvision, visual acuity, and marital quality factors on Step 2,\nand the interaction of each marital quality variable and\neither self-reported vision or objective vision on Step 3.\nTo minimize multicollinearity, predictor variables were\ncentered before they were multiplied (Judd & McClelland,\n1989). A significant interaction term, indicating that marital\nquality moderates the effects of vision on the criterion vari-\nable (Baron & Kenny, 1986), was decomposed such that\nsimple slopes were computed and tested for the relationship\nbetween vision and the quality of life indicator for respon-\ndents scoring 1 SD above and below the mean on the mod-\nerating marital quality variable (Aiken & West, 1991).\nTable 2 contains the results of the moderated regression\nmodels. It presents the findings separately for the moder-\nating role of marital quality in the effects of self-reported\nvision and visual acuity. The results for Step 1 (examining\nthe role of sociodemographic variables) and Step 2 (examin-\ning the direct role of the vision and marital quality variables)\nwere identical across the models focusing on self-reported\nvision and visual acuity; the results for Step 3 (the test of\nmoderation) varied across these models. Step 2 indicates\nthat vision assessments and marital quality variables as a set\n9-item scale was found to be internally consistent (Cronbach's\nFeelings of social isolation were assessed using three\nitems (how often do you feel isolated from others, that you\nlack companionship, and feel left out?) adapted from the\nUCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).\nSimilar items were used by Femia and colleagues (2001) in\ntheir study of outcomes associated with vision impairment\nto measure feelings of social isolation in older adults.\nResponses to these items were made using a 3-point scale\nranging from 1 = hardly ever or never to 3 = often, and\nscores were summed such that higher scores represented\nCronbach's a = .80).\nDepressive symptomatology was measured using an 11-\nitem version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00ad\nDepression scale (Radloff, 1977) that assesses the severity\nof depressive symptoms over a 1-week recall period. Items\n(e.g., \"I could not `get going'\" and \"I felt that everything\nI did was an effort\") were answered on a 4-point scale rang-\ning from 0 = rarely/none of the time to 3 = most of the time.\nItem responses were summed with higher scores reflecting\nscale was internally consistent (Cronbach's a = .79).\nControl variables.--Sociodemographic variables were\nmeasured in the NSHAP using standard self-report items.\nThese included age (in years), gender (1 = male, 2 = female),\neducation (1 = less than high school, 2 = high school diploma\nor equivalent, 3 = some college/vocational education, and\n4 = college education or higher), and ethnic background\n(coded as a dichotomous variable, 1 = White vs. 2 =\nnon-White). These variables were used as covariates in the\nmoderated regression models.\nResults\nZero-order correlations between major study variables\nare listed in Table 1. A small but statistically significant\ncorrelation was obtained between self-reported vision and\nperformance on the visual acuity test (r = .24, p < .001). As\nexpected, respondents who rated their vision to be poorer\nalso reported greater functional limitations, feelings of\nsocial isolation, and depressive symptomatology. Those\nwhose visual acuity was objectively assessed to be poorer\nalso reported more functional limitations and symptoms of\ndepression. The three marital quality domains (relationship\nsatisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time\nspent with the spouse) were correlated with each other in\nthe expected direction; these correlation coefficients ranged\nfrom .17 to .45, indicating that these factors assessed related\nbut distinct aspects of marital quality (shared variance rang-\ning from .030 to .203). In addition, consistent with existing\nresearch, poorer marital quality was related to more functional\nTable 1.

On Step 1, being female was associated with more functional\nlimitations, feelings of social isolation, and symptoms of depression; being older and being less educated were associated with more functional limitations\nand symptoms of depression, whereas being of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity was predictive of more feelings of social isolation.

Although\nprevious studies have examined the buffering role of support\nfrom friends and family in the link between visual impair-\nment and well-being in elders (e.g., McIlvane & Reinhardt,\n2001), no study could be located that had examined the\ncapacity of a good marriage to play such a mitigating role.\nAnd yet, the spousal relationship remains a key social tie in\nthe late adulthood years (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001), and\none that is close or marked by better quality has been found\nto be an important resource for older adults (e.g., Bookwala,\nUmberson et al., 2006). The present study hypothesized that\na marriage of good quality will buffer the negative impact of\npoor vision on older adults' quality of life.\nPreliminary analyses showed that poorer self-reported\nvision was consistently related to more functional limitations,\nfeelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatology\nand that poorer visual acuity was related to more functional\nlimitations. This pattern of findings is consistent with other\nstudies that have examined links to quality of life from self-\nand objective assessments of distance vision (Jang et al.,\n2003). Consistent with study expectations and findings from\nother studies (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001; Bookwala &\n2006), the present study also found that better marital quality,\nspecifically a more satisfying marital relationship, predicted\nbetter quality of life in general.\nMost central to the study's goals was the test of the moder-\nating role of a good marriage in the link from vision to quality\nof life. The results showed that higher marital satisfaction\nwas a strong buffer of the effects of poorer self-reported\nvision on functional limitations and depressive symptomatol-\nogy and a weaker but significant moderator of the effects of\nlower visual acuity on functional limitations. These findings\nshow that a more satisfying marriage may be a key resource\nin older adults' adaptation to poor visual function. We know\nfrom past research that a good spousal relationship can play a\nvaluable role in enhancing quality of life (e.g.,Antonucci et al.,\nand that a good quality marriage can mitigate the adverse\neffects of mid- and late life stressors such as physical disabil-\nity or living with a cognitively impaired or depressed spouse\nextend these findings to the domain of visual function to\nshow that a more satisfying marriage buffers the link between\npoor vision and quality of life in late adulthood.\nNot all marital quality indicators, however, served to buf-\nfer the link from poor vision to better quality of life. Leisure\nor recreational time spent with one's spouse did not moder-\nate the negative role of poor vision in functional limitations,\nfeelings of social isolation, and symptoms of depression.\nMoreover, supportive spouse behaviors moderated the link\nbetween poor vision and functional limitations in the direc-\ntion opposite from that expected. More supportive spouse\nFigure 1. Moderator models for self-reported vision.

(b) Simple slopes predicting depressive symptomatology using self-reported vision for high versus low scores on relationship\nsatisfaction (1 SD \u00b1 mean). (c) Simple slopes predicting functional limitations using self-reported vision for high versus low scores on supportive spouse behaviors\n(1 SD \u00b1 mean).\nbehaviors were associated with higher functional limitations\nin the case of poor vision (subjective and objective). A\nplausible explanation for this finding is that supportive be-\nhaviors from one's spouse may be a response to functional\nlimitations that accompany poorer visual ability such that\nolder adults with poorer vision (and thus, more functional\nlimitations) may be more likely to receive more supportive\nbehaviors from their spouse. Some supporting evidence\nfor this explanation is offered by Reinhardt and colleagues\n(2003) who found that more functional disability was linked\nto higher support from family members in a sample of visu-\nally impaired elders. They posit that interactions of family\nmembers are responsive in nature and are likely to be in-\ncreased in times of need as in the case of a spouse who re-\nports high visual impairment and functional limitations. It\nalso is plausible, however, that heightened support from the\nspouse is overprotective or solicitous in nature. Studies of\nvisually impaired elders have shown that overprotection or\nsolicitous support can compromise adaptation and quality of\nlife (e.g., Cimarolli & Boerner, 2005; Cimarolli, Reinhardt,\n& Horowitz, 2006). Thus, solicitous support may result in\nvisually impaired elders being prevented by the spouse from\ncarrying out day-to-day activities and thereby them experi-\nencing more functional limitations. Finally, Antonucci and\nAkiyama (1995) pointed out that interpersonal relation-\nships may exacerbate the effects of stressors when the sup-\nport that is provided is ineffective. The supportive behaviors\nassessed in the NSHAP pertained to emotionally supportive\nbehaviors rather than to material or instrumental support. It\nis plausible that emotionally supportive behaviors are inef-\nfective in the context of poor vision and thus may not buffer\nor may even exacerbate difficulties in day-to-day function. It\nis essential that future studies undertake a more nuanced\nanalysis of the role of different types of supportive behaviors\n(e.g., emotional support vs. instrumental support vs. solici-\ntous support) in buffering versus exacerbating the effects\nof poor vision on functional limitations.\nA noteworthy characteristic of the present findings is\nthat the moderator models for self-reported vision con-\ntrolled for the direct effects of visual acuity and vice versa.\nThis approach is more rigorous because it examines the\nsimultaneous effects of both perceived visual function and\nobjective visual acuity. In addition, it takes into account\ndiscrepancies between individuals' subjective assessments\nof their visual function and objective performance scores.\nAn examination of the match between the two vision as-\nsessments (not reported earlier) showed that 91 respon-\ndents whose visual acuity fell in the moderately decreased\nto poor range rated their vision to be good to excellent and\nan additional 63 respondents whose visual acuity fell in the\nnormal to good range rated their vision as fair or poor.\nThus, approximately one fifth of the sample showed some\ndiscordance between their self-reported and objectively as-\nsessed vision. This is in keeping with the small (albeit sig-\nnificant)correlation(r=.24)obtainedbetweenself-reported\nvision and performance on the visual acuity test. Such dis-\ncordance between subjective and objective assessments of\nvision has been reported in earlier research (Fors,\nThorslund, & Parker, 2006) and thus including both assess-\nments when available in statistical models is desirable. In-\ncluding both subjective and objective measures of vision\nalso can offer complementary information on visual ability\nand may serve to counter the limitations of the other\nformance-based measure of visual acuity does not assess\nimpairments that may be experienced due to visual field,\ncontrast sensitivity, and depth perception problems and\nthus can offer an objective but more exclusive estimate of\nvisual problems. In contrast, she noted that a self-reported\nmeasure of visual ability is likely to capture more global\nevaluations of vision including trouble seeing, difficulty\nreading newspaper print, and difficulty seeing a familiar\nperson across a room's length that provide insight into the\nday-to-day implications of poor vision. As such, self-re-\nported data on visual function are likely to offer a subjec-\ntive but more inclusive estimate of visual problems. Future\nresearch may gain further by assessing even more specific\naspects of visual function objectively (e.g., impairment in\ndepth perception, extreme contrast or brightness sensitivity\nin addition to visual acuity as assessed in NSHAP) and\nsubjectively (e.g., self-reported trouble with reading news-\npaper print and recognizing people at a small distance in\nFigure 2. Moderator models for visual acuity. (a) Simple slopes predicting functional limitations using visual acuity for high versus low scores on relationship\nsatisfaction (1 SD \u00b1 mean).

It does so\nvia data from a representative sample of community-residing\nolder adults in the United States with varying levels of\nvisual function who participated in the NSHAP (S. Smith\net al., 2009). The NSHAP is a rich source of data on\nthe lives of older adults that includes assessments of several\naspects of marital and similar partnered relationships, subjective\nand objective dimensions of visual function, and multiple\ndimensions of quality of life. These strengths notwithstanding,\nit is important to note the study's limitations. First, the data are\ncross-sectional in nature and, as such, preclude unambiguous\ncausal interpretations of relationships. For example, one\ncould argue for the moderating role of quality of life in the\nlink from vision impairment to marital quality. However,\nthere is strong theoretical and empirical evidence for a reli-\nable link from worse visual function to poorer quality of\nstress-buffering hypothesis of social support (Cohen, 2004)\nprovides a viable theoretical argument for treating the spou-\nsal relationship as the moderator in this link. Other studies\ndemonstrating the moderating role of marital quality in the\nface of a diverse set of stressors experienced in late life\nKasl, 1995) further strengthen the rationale for treating the\nspousal relationship as a moderator in the well-established\nlink between vision impairment and quality of life in late\nadulthood. Another limitation tied to the cross-sectional na-\nture of the data is that the present study cannot speak to the\nissue of vision loss because prior levels of visual function in\nthe sample are unknown. As such, it is not possible to assess\nthe extent to which deterioration in vision plays a role in\nquality of life and the extent to which marital quality mod-\nerates the impact of such deterioration. As future waves of\nthe NSHAP become available, however, it will be possible\nto assess these relationships longitudinally. Despite the cross-\nsectional nature of the data, the present study makes impor-\ntant and novel contributions to our understanding of the\nlinkages among vision, marital quality, and quality of late\nlife. It also adds to the growing literature on the protective\nrole that a marriage of good quality can play in the overall\npromotion of health and well-being as individuals age.\nFunding\nThe National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project is supported by the\nNational Institutes of Health--the National Institute on Aging, Office\nof Women's Health Research, Office of AIDS Research, and the Office of\nthis paper were presented at the 63rd annual meeting of the Gerontological\nSociety of America, Atlanta, GA.\nCorrespondence\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Jamila Bookwala, PhD, De-\npartment of Psychology, 305 Oechsle Hall, Lafayette College, Easton,\nReferences\nAiken, L.
