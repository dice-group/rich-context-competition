GDM occurs in cases\nwhere insulin secretion fails to compensate\nfor insulin resistance. Women with a history\nof GDM are at a higher risk of developing\nT2D later in life.5 GDM and T2D are\nmultifactorial disorders with a common\npathogenesis. The diseases share several\nfeatures, including pancreatic beta-cell dys-\nfunction, insulin resistance and association\nwith similar risk factors. A variety of risk\nfactors, including obesity, family history,\nlifestyle, ethnicity, genetics and physical\ninactivity, contribute to the development of\nboth GDM and T2D.6 Earlier studies\nstrongly supported the possibility that\nGDM and T2D share the same genetic\nbackground. Over the past few decades,\nnumerous studies have focused on the iden-\ntification of accumulating genetic variants\nthat are strongly associated with T2D.7\ndownstream of the paired box gene 4\n(PAX4) gene, which is located on chromo-\nsome 7q32 and belongs to a family of\ntranscription factors. The gene plays an\nimportant role in the differentiation and\ndevelopment of pancreatic islet beta cells\nduring fetal development.8,9 A number of\ninvestigations to date have identified\nT2D.10 However, little is known about its\npotential association with GDM. Based on\nthese findings, we hypothesized that the\n(SNP) is associated with predisposition to\nGDM. Therefore, PAX4 may be a novel\ntarget candidate gene for GDM therapy.\nIn the current study, we examined the\ngenetic, clinical and biochemical differences\nbetween GDM and normal pregnancies\naccording to the Strengthening the\nReporting of Genetic Association Studies\ninitiative.11 We aimed to clarify the relation-\nas its association with clinical and biochem-\nical parameters. Our results may provide\nbetter insights into the mechanisms under-\nlying PAX4 gene variations in the develop-\nment of GDM.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\npregnancy subjects selected for study were of\nand 2014, subjects were recruited from the\nInternational Peace Maternity and Child\nHealth Hospital affiliated with the Medical\nSchool of Shanghai Jiao Tong University\nand Bao'an Maternal and Child Health\nHospital, Shenzhen, China. No previous\ndiagnosis of chronic hypertension, type 1\nor type 2 diabetes, infection, renal dysfunc-\ntion, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus\nerythematosus was reported in any case.\nGDM diagnosis was performed according\nto the International Association of the\nDiabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups\ncriteria,12 which later was also imple-\nmented by the World Health Organization\npdf). Our study protocol was in accordance\nwith institutional ethic guidelines and\nnational laws. Informed written consent\nwas obtained from all subjects. This study\nwas approved by the Ethics Committees of\nthe International Peace Maternity and Child\nHealth Hospital affiliated with the Medical\nSchool of Shanghai Jiao Tong University\nand Bao'an Maternal and Child Health\nHospital and conducted in accordance with\nthe principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nStudy protocol\nAll subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose\ntolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of\ngestation to screen for GDM. Subjects were\nexamined in the morning after a 12-h over-\nglucose levels were measured at 0, 1 and 2 h\nduring the glucose challenge. GDM was\ndiagnosed in cases where one of the glucose\nvalues met or exceeded the threshold. Body\nmass index (BMI) for all pregnancies before\ndelivery was calculated as the ratio of weight\n(kg) to the square of height (m2).13 Large,\nappropriate and small for gestational age\nrates were recorded. Biochemical data,\nincluding plasma glucose, glycosylated\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and triglyceride\nlevels, were additionally measured in all\ncases.\nGenotyping\nGenomic DNA samples were extracted from\nperipheral whole blood using the TIANamp\nBlood DNA kit (TIANGEN Biotech,\nBeijing, China). Genotyping was performed\nusing SNaPshot (ABI Prism SNaPShot\nmultiplex kit; Applied Biosystems) on an\ning to the manufacturer's instructions and\nevaluated using ABI GeneScan software.\nApproximately 15% of the samples in our\nstudy were sequenced using an ABI PRISM\n3730 genetic analyzer to reconfirm genotype.\nReproducibility of data was 100%. The\nproportion of technically successful geno-\ntyping out of all samples assessed for geno-\nPrimers for amplification were designed\nusing Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). All\nprimers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech\nCo., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fragments of\nthe variant were amplified from 100 ng DNA\nin a 20-ml reaction mixture containing\nward primer, 1 mM reverse primer and 0.5 U\nTaq polymerase (TaKaRa). A touchdown\nPCR program was used according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. The primer\nsequences for PCR amplification were as\nfollows: forward 50-CAACAGTGCTGCCT\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nthe Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables\nwere expressed as mean \u00c6 standard devi-\nation and compared using the Student's\nt-test. Association of the allele and genotype\nof the SNP with the disease was analyzed\nusing Pearson's 2 test and OR (odds ratio).\nDeviation from Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium was assessed using the Chi-square test.\nAll tests were two-sided, and a value of\np < 0.05 was accepted as statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nClinical and biochemical characteristics of\nsubjects\nThe basic clinical and biochemical char-\nacteristics of all patients with GDM and con-\ntrols are presented in Table 1.

A number of\ngenetic variants related to T2D are also\nreported to be associated with GDM.18\nSeveral genome-wide association studies\nhave suggested that mutations or poly-\nmorphisms in PAX4 are associated with\nwhether PAX4 is linked to GDM, we\nevaluated the possible association between\ntime in this study.\nConsistent with earlier findings, BMI and\nplasma glucose, HbA1c and triglyceride\nconcentrations were significantly higher in\nsubjects with GDM compared with those of\nnormal controls. However, neonatal birth\nweight did not differ between subjects with\nGDM and normal controls. All pregnant\nwomen diagnosed with GDM in the clinic\nunderwent diet and exercise therapy to\nensure that weight before delivery and new-\nborn birth weight were effectively con-\ntrolled.

The relative\nmorphism is located downstream of PAX4.\nWhile several studies to date have focused\non the effects of PAX4 in the pathogenesis of\nT2D, to the best of our knowledge, none\nhave addressed its potential association with\nGDM. PAX4 is a transcription factor\nbelonging to the PAX family of proteins\nthat contains a paired box domain, a paired-\ntype homeodomain and an octapeptide\ninvolved in fetal development and tumor\ngrowth. PAX4 is expressed in early pancre-\natic endocrine cells, which is necessary for\ndifferentiation, development, proliferation\nand insulin secretion of pancreatic islet\nbeta cells. The protein stimulates the expres-\nsion of PDX1, a key transcription factor for\nislet development.21,22 Targeted disruption\nof PAX4 in mice has been shown to reduce\nbeta-cell mass at birth. Shimajiri et al.\nreported that the R121W mutation in\nPAX4 is significantly associated with\nT2D.11 Ma and colleagues identified an\nelevated fasting plasma glucose and\nimpaired beta-cell function in controls and\nearlier age at diagnosis in Chinese popula-\nassociated with T2DM in a Mongolian\npopulation in China.24\nTo determine the functional implications\nformed an association analysis between\nthese variants and biochemical characteris-\ntics.
