Our paper finds\ncross-country differences \u00ad for example, the level of cash usage differs across countries. Cash\nhas not disappeared as a payment instrument, especially for low-value transactions. We also\nfind that the use of cash is strongly correlated with transaction size, demographics, and point-of-\nsale characteristics such as merchant card acceptance and venue.\n",

The aim of the conference was to bring together academics, regulators and market participants to discuss possible\ndevelopments and dynamics that will shape the future retail payments landscape.\nRetail payments provide a very important, yet not the most visible, infrastructure for the operation of the real economy. The way\neconomic actors pay is not only important from a theoretical point of view but also from a policy perspective as the costs for providing\npayment services are substantial in most countries. As we are witnessing a transformation in these markets from traditional paper-based\npayment instruments towards electronic means of payments, the interaction between market forces and regulatory initiatives continues\nto be a determining factor for the future. This interaction, and the possible policy conclusions stemming from it, was the main theme\nof this conference.\nThe selection and refereeing process of this paper has been carried out by the conference organisational team composed of experts\nfrom both organising institutions. As the conference was organised with a focus on the key issues above, papers were selected not only\nbased on their standalone quality but also considering the relevance of the research subject to the themes of the event. Following the\nconference the selected papers have been asked to be revised according to the discussants assigned to the respective paper.\nThe paper is released in order to make the working papers and accompanying research submitted to the conference publicly available.\nAll working papers submitted to the conference can be found at\nhttp://www.ecb.europa.eu/events/conferences/html/131021_ecb_bdf.en.html.\n"
