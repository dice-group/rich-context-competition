Depression declined with age and did not differ by diabetes status in the\noldest respondents (P = 0.01 for age-diabetes interaction).\nCONCLUSIONSdDiabetes differentially affects self-rated overall health and depression by\nage, with convergence in the oldest age-group with and without diabetes.\nIndividualizing care of type 2 diabetes\n(1), particularly for older patients (2),\nhas become a priority. Age influences\nthe diabetes phenotype and therefore pa-\nrameters guiding individualization of care.\nEarlier-onset type 2 diabetes is often more\nsevere and insulin deficient (3,4), has a\nhigher relative and absolute risk of mortal-\nity (5), and allows more time for complica-\ntions to develop (6). Age also influences\npatient-specific illness perception. Older\npatients often have less diabetes-related\ndistress than younger ones (7).\nOur goal in this report was to deter-\nmine whether diabetes differentially im-\npacts physical and mental health by age.\nWe hypothesized that diabetes would have\na greater impact on self-reported physical\nand mental health in middle age than in\nold age comparing persons with diabetes\nwith those without diabetes within age\ncohorts.\nMETHODSdWe obtained permis-\nsion to use data from the National Social\nLife, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP),\na national area probability sample of\nyears. Detailed in-home interviews of re-\nspondents selected from the U.S. popula-\ntion in a stratified random sample were\nconducted in English and Spanish in\nods and procedures have previously been\ndescribed (8). The institutional review\nboards of the University of Chicago and\nthe National Opinion Research Center ap-\nproved the NHSAP protocol; the Partners\nHealthCare Institutional Review Board\ndeemed this analysis exempt.\nDemographic information and medical\nconditions were obtained byself-report (9).\nDiabetes diagnosis was based on an af-\nfirmative response to the following ques-\ntion: \"Has a medical doctor ever told you\nthat you have . . . diabetes or high blood\nsugar?\"\nOutcome variables included comor-\nbidity score, depression, and self-rated\nphysical and mental health. The comor-\nbidity score summed available self-reported\nconditions excluding diabetes (9). Symp-\ntoms of depression were assessed using\nan 11-item version of the Center for Epide-\nmiological Studies-Depression (CES-D)\nscale in which a score of $9 indicates de-\npression (10,11). Physical health and men-\ntal health were self-rated as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor; responses were\ndichotomized into poor and fair versus\ngood, very good, and excellent. Health sta-\ntus relative to peers was rated much better,\nsomewhat better, about the same, some-\nwhat worse, or much worse, with responses\ndichotomized into somewhat and much\nworseversusaboutthesame,somewhatbet-\nter, and much better.\nAll analyses were conducted using\nSAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) with statistical procedures (proc\nsurveymeans, proc surveyfreq, and proc\nsurveyreg) that accounted for the complex\nsampling design using weights to adjust for\nthe probabilities of being selected to par-\nticipate in the study and of not responding\nbased on demographic and survey stratifi-\ncation characteristics. We tested the signif-\nicance of the interaction of age-group and\ndiabetes for each outcome variable.\nRESULTSdDetails of demographic and\nclinical characteristics of the cohort can be\nfound in Supplementary Table 1. The total\ncomorbidity score tended to increase in\nboth groups with age, but among subjects\nwith diabetes the score started from a\nhigher baseline and rose less steeply,\nshowing a significant interaction between\ndiabetes and age-group (P = 0.02) (Fig. 1A).\nThe CES-D score decreased with age\namong diabetes respondents and increased\nc c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c\nFrom the 1Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts;\nthe 2Divison of General Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; the 3Division of\nGeneral Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; the 4Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; and the 5Division of Research,\nKaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.\nCorresponding author: Deborah J.

Among re-\nspondents with diabetes, 18% rated their\nphysical health fair or poor in the 57\u00ad64\nyears age-group, decreasing to only 10% of\nthe oldest age group, while 6\u00ad7% of\nrespondents without diabetes rated their\nhealth fair or poor across all age-groups\n(P = 0.006 for age-diabetes interaction)\n(Fig. 1D). Health status relative to peers\nshowed a more pronounced pattern (P for\ndifference between diabetes and nondiabe-\ntes in the oldest age-group = 0.16; P for age-\ndiabetes interaction = 0.04) (Fig. 1E). Poor\nor fair self-rated mental health showed a\nsimilar pattern, though the age-diabetes in-\nteraction was not significant (Fig. 1F).\nIn multivariable models predicting\ndepression and poor or fair self-rated phys-\nical health, the interaction between diabe-\ntes and age was significant after adjustment\nfor sex, ethnic group, and education level\n(Supplementary Table 2).\nCONCLUSIONSdIn this national area\nprobability sample of community-dwelling\nand the perceived burden of disease differed\nby age and diabetes status. Respondents\nwith diabetes had more comorbid condi-\ntions than those without diabetes across\nthe age spectrum, but depression and\nself-rated health were significantly worse\nchiefly in respondents with diabetes aged\nout diabetes; the oldest age cohort with\ndiabetes did not rate themselves much\ndifferently from their peers without\ndiabetes.\nWhile nationally representative, the\nfindings are limited by their cross-sectional\nnature, the lack of information on du-\nration of diabetes, and, possibly, diabetes\nself-report, though diabetes self-report is\nhighly valid in older populations (12). In\naddition, respondents from different gen-\nerations may differ in how they rate their\nsymptoms of depression and their overall\nhealth. NSHAP did not distinguish between\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most diabetes\nin the population age .57 years is type 2\ndiabetes, and the majority of people af-\nfected by type 2 diabetes are in the age-\ngroup sampled.\nDespite these limitations, this report\ndemonstrates that the experience and per-\nception of diabetes differ by age. Several\nstudies have identified an age-diabetes in-\nwork by showing that while some among\nthe old may have poorly controlled diabe-\ntes (3,15), the physical and psychological\nburden, in general, appears to be greater\nin middle-aged groups. These findings\nsuggest a role for more aggressive medical\nand psychological care in middle-aged\npatients with diabetes, while prioritizing\ndiabetes within the context of other prob-\nlems among older patients.\n"
