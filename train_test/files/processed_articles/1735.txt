Design and Meth-\nods: We used a retrospective cohort study of 211 APS\nclients (74% female; age, M \u00bc 77 years) in two central\nNew Jersey counties. Results: Dementia was the most\nfrequent diagnosis (62% prevalence) and was positively\ncorrelated with occurrences of financial exploitation (R\u00bc\namong female APS clients. Depression (37% preva-\nlence), hypertension (36%), involuntary weight loss\nequally distributed, though urinary incontinence (23%\nprevalence) was strongly correlated with circumstances\nof caregiver neglect (R \u00bc .31; p \u00bc .003). Implica-\ntions: This new effort to link APS workers with geriatric\nclinicians conducting in-home health assessments\nproved effective for identifying a high prevalence of\nremediable health conditions among APS clients suffer-\ning various manifestations of elder mistreatment.\nKey Words: Elder abuse and neglect,\nElder mistreatment, Geriatric assessment,\nAdult protective services\nAccording to the 1996 National Elder Abuse In-\ncidence Study (National Center on Elder Abuse, 1998),\nmistreatment in domestic settings, though only 21%\nof these were reported to and substantiated by adult\nprotective services (APS). Significant variations be-\ntween states in the rates of reporting, investigating, and\nsubstantiating domestic elder mistreatment have re-\ncently been described, which may contribute to such\nunderreporting (Jogerst et al., 2003). In community-\nbased survey research, the prevalence of self-reported\nevents of elder mistreatment among independently\nliving elderly persons ranges from 3% to 5% (Comijs,\nPot, Smit, Bouter, & Jonker, 1998; Pillemer &\ndefinitions and terminology make comparisons difficult\nHealth care professionals constitute one of the\nlargest reporting sources of possible elder mistreatment\nto APS agencies, according to the 2000 State Survey of\nAdult Protective Services (National Center on Elder\nDr. Heath's work was funded in part by grant support through the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation New Jersey Health Initiatives Project\n035783.

Elder\nmistreatment, however, has been shown to have\na significant impact on the mortality of its victims,\nindependent of other comorbidities (Lachs & Pillemer,\n2004; Lachs, Williams, O'Brien, Pillemer, & Charlson,\n1998). Other studies based on hospital-based clinical-\nassessment services (Coyne, Reichman, & Berbig, 1993;\nDyer, Pavlik, Murphy, & Hyman, 2000) have identified\na high prevalence of dementia and depression among\nthose suffering neglect or abuse. In some settings, APS\nagencies have established relationships with health\ncare providers to jointly respond to elder-mistreatment\noccurrences (Dyer et al., 1999; Mosqueda, Burnight,\nLiao, & Kemp, 2004), often in association with\nconcurrent medical education (Heath, Dyer, Kerzner,\nOur current study describes the diagnostic findings\nof medical and functional conditions from one such\ncollaboration between APS agencies and a geriatric-\nassessment service in assessing homebound older adults\nwho were experiencing various forms of elder mis-\ntreatment. Our study objectives were to describe the\nprevalence of remediable geriatric conditions and to\nseek associations between such previously undiagnosed\nfindings with the type of mistreatment the APS clients\nundergoing the assessment were suffering.\nMethods\nSetting\nIn 1998, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nprovided funding to initiate an in-home interdisciplinary\ngeriatric medical-assessment service called Linking Geri-\natrics With Adult Protective Services (LGAPS) to serve\nthe APS units in Middlesex and Somerset counties in\ncentral New Jersey. APS regulations in New Jersey focus\non vulnerable adults residing in the community who,\nbecause of physical or mental illness, disability, or defi-\nciency, lacksufficient understanding or capacityto make,\ncommunicate, or carry out decisions concerning their\nwell-being and therefore are at risk for abuse, neglect, or\nfinancial exploitation. APS social workers respond to\nreports of alleged mistreatment by investigating the cir-\ncumstances of the vulnerable adult and intervening on\nbehalf of the client to remediate the mistreatment issues\nthat have been substantiated. New Jersey provides train-\ning for its APS workers about the recognition of common\nhealth-related impairments in the elderly population and\nthe use of screening tools for reviewing functional skills.\nPrior to the initiation of LGAPS, participating\ngeriatric clinicians met with the APS staffs in both\ncounties to review their training in recognizing health\nissues and to discuss the collaborative process by which\nthe social work and health care teams might work best\ntogether. Referrals to the LGAPS in-home assessment\nservice were made by the APS workers from among their\nclients with substantiated mistreatment who had unmet\nhealthneedsat thetime ofthe initial APScontact. LGAPS\nassessment services were limited to those APS clients\nwho did not have an existing health care provider that\ncould be identified by the APS worker or who refused to\nleave their homes to access a prior source of health care\nservices as recommended by their APS workers.\nLGAPS assessments were conducted by a nurse\npractitioner\u00adgeriatrician physician team in collabora-\ntion with the referring social worker at the residence of\nthe referred APS client. The assessment process included\na detailed medical and functional history along with\na limited physical examination, including blood pres-\nsure measurements, assessment of gait and mobility,\nvisual and hearing acuities, and formal screening\nassessment of cognition (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,\nstatus (American Academy of Family Physicians, 1999).\nThis retrospective cohort study is based on assess-\nments of 211 APS clients referred for LGAPS assess-\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Board for the\nProtection of Human Subjects of the University of\nMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Robert Wood\nJohnson Medical School.\nOutcome Measures\nThe classifications of mistreatment--neglect, finan-\ncial exploitation, and abuse--that we used came from\nthe APS workers and reflected the state-reporting\nterminology in use at the time of the study (New Jersey\nState Department of Health and Senior Services, 2000).\nThese classifications served as independent variables\ncorrelated with the findings of the geriatric-assessment\nprocess, grouped into medical diagnoses of dementia,\ndepression, hypertension, diabetes, and active pain;\ninvoluntary weight loss; and functional issues of falling,\nincontinence, uncorrected vision or hearing sensory\nimpairments, limited food access, and alcohol abuse.\nData Analysis\nWe entered data into SPSS for Windows Version 11.0\nfor descriptive statistics and tests for associations using\nboth parametric and nonparametric statistical measures.\nResults\nDemographics of Study Population\nThe mean age of the 211 APS clients referred for\n(26%)men.Racialandethnicdistributionwasasfollows:\nother (2%). Sixty percent of this cohort was living alone\nat the time of the assessment, and there were no\nsignificantgenderdifferencesinage,race,livingsituation,\nor county of residence between assessedmen and women.\nClassification of Elder Mistreatment\nSelf-neglect was by far the most common manifesta-\ntion of mistreatment among patients referred for\nassessment (161 cases), although most APS clients\nreferred for assessment had more than one form of\nmistreatment identified by the APS workers at the time\nof referral. There were 100 occurrences of caregiver\nneglect, 62 reports of exploitation, and 31 reports of\nphysical abuse. Although we noted no significant\npatterns of age or racial distributions among these\nclassifications of mistreatment, women who were\nreferred for assessment were more likely to have\nWhen we examined living circumstances, self-neglect\nappeared to be associated primarily with women who\nof physical abuse, 6 of the 7 abused men were living with\na caregiver present, whereas for the 24 women there\nwere equal numbers distributed among those living with\nthe perpetrator present and those living alone.\nDiagnostic and Functional Findings\nTable 1 shows the overall prevalence of assessment\nfindings and statistically significant positive correla-\ntions with various forms of mistreatment. Dementia\nwas the most prevalent newly diagnosed condition,\nfound in 62% of referred APS clients. A diagnosis of\ndementia was positively correlated with caregiver\nneglect among women (R \u00bc .17; p \u00bc .03) but not\namong men. However, the mean Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) perfor-\nmance score was significantly poorer for APS clients of\nboth genders who had suffered caregiver neglect than\nfor those who had not experienced neglect (14.6 vs\nin the MMSE performance score among those suffering\nfinancial exploitation or physical abuse.\nDepression was the second most common diagnosis\n(37%) and was not associated with any single form of\nmistreatment. Hypertension was diagnosed in 36% of\nassessed cases whereas diabetes mellitus was identified\namong 16% of assessed cases. Neither medical di-\nagnosis was associated with any particular form of\nelder mistreatment.\nNutritional concerns were commonly identified\namong assessed individuals, with 127 individuals\nhaving either unintentional weight loss (34%) or\nlimited food access (25%) identified. These nutritional\nissues were not associated with any individual type of\nelder mistreatment, nor were there statistical associa-\ntions identified with the living situation of those with\nthese nutritional concerns.\nA significantly high prevalence of pain (32%) was\nidentified in this cohort. Among these 69 individuals, 28\n(13% of the total population) had severe, uncontrolled\npain at the time of the assessment that required\nimmediate intervention. Women living alone were\nmore likely to have unaddressed pain-management\ncognitive performance scores (mean MMSE of those\npain; p , .0001). We did not find pain to be correlated\nwith any single category of elder mistreatment.\nTargeted functional conditions included falling,\nincontinence, and sensory impairment. A total of 58\nindividuals (26%) had fallen, and no single form of\nmistreatment was associated with this finding. How-\never, urinary incontinence, which was another highly\nprevalent functional issue identified among 23% of\nassessed individuals, was highly correlated with having\nimpairment of vision or hearing was found in 47\nassessed individuals (22%). Caregiver neglect was\nassociated with this sensory impairment among men\nTwenty-two individuals (10.4%) had alcohol misuse\nidentified during their assessment. We found alcohol\nabuse to be positively correlated with having suffered\nphysical abuse among these 17 women (R \u00bc .20; p \u00bc\nDiscussion\nThe high prevalence of remediable geriatric con-\nditions identified in this cohort of APS clients reflects\neffective case finding by the participating APS workers\ncollaborating with geriatric health care clinicians. The\n211 clients referred during this 35-month study period\nconstituted 22% of the total case load of substantiated\ncases of mistreatment in both counties.\nThe predominance of neglect among the APS clients\ndescribed here is consistent with the known national\ndistribution of the various forms of elder mistreatment\n(Lachs & Pillemer, 1995). The high prevalence of\ndementia and of depression in this study is also\nconsistent with findings in previous studies focused on\nneglected populations (Coyne et al., 1993; Dyer et al.,\n2000). The gender differences seen with the associations\nof exploitation and caregiver neglect among demented\nwomen and caregiver neglect among men with un-\ncorrected sensory impairment and with physical abuse\noccurring among women with alcohol abuse have not\nbeen reported previously.\nTable 1.

Cognitively impaired clients may not\nhave been able to report pain as well as those with\nbetter cognitive function. Pain may have been one of\nthe most recognized ``unmet health needs'' identified by\nthe referring APS social workers, in part reflecting the\ndeclining health state of their clients suffering abuse or\nneglect (Reyes-Gibby, Aday, & Cleeland, 2002).\nThe frequency of unintentional weight loss was not\nfound to be associated with any individual form of elder\nmistreatment and identifies another feature that should\nbe investigated among older adult victims, as it may be\na marker for serious undiagnosed underlying disease.\nHealth care providers will encounter older patients\npresenting with symptoms or signs of possible mis-\ntreatment that may include but are not limited to the\nfollowing: neglect of personal hygiene, health, or\nwelfare; hindered access to needed medical services;\ninadequately explained multiple bruising, pressure\nsores, or other trauma; and psychological signs of\nmaltreatment or impoverishment. When such signs are\nidentified, providers must take the appropriate action\nof reporting such situations to the APS-responding\nagency for investigation and intervention (Jogerst et al.,\nAn important limitation of these data is their\napplicability to other populations of abused or neglected\nelders living in community settings but not having been\nidentified as having unmet health needs, the determina-\ntion used by the APS social workers to trigger the LGAPS\nassessment process described here. Other APS clients\nwith similar unmet health needs will have an identified\nphysician or other source of health care that can be\nenlisted by the APS workers. In addition, the provision of\nthe assessment process described here was conducted in\nthe home setting and therefore was limited in the\nthoroughness of some elements of the diagnostic pro-\ncess, although the home setting facilitated other aspects\nof the assessment process (e.g., falling assessment).\nAnother common concern in elder mistreatment\nresearch is the lack of common terminology across APS\nagencies to categorize manifestations of elder mis-\ntreatment. Prior reports (Levine, 2003; Daly & Jogerst,\n2001) have documented the variation between states in\nthe use of mistreatment classification terms such as\nabandonment (not used in New Jersey) as well as\nterminology such as self-neglect, which is included\namong the issues that APS must address in New Jersey.\nFinally, the prevalence rates and diagnostic associations\ndescribed here are based on a community-dwelling\nsample of mistreated adults and may not reflect the\nexperience of mistreated residents living in institutional\nsettings such as nursing homes. This study does have\nrelevance for questions regarding institutionalization,\nhowever, because APS-service utilization has been\nidentified as a ``risk factor'' for nursing home placement\n(Lachs, Williams, O'Brien, & Pillemer, 2002).\nIn conclusion, the high prevalence of identification\nof many remediable geriatric health issues among\ncommunity-dwelling victims of elder mistreatment\nresulted from a productive collaboration between geri-\natric health care providers and APS workers responding\nto elder abuse and neglect.\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, American Dietetic Association,\nNational Council on Aging Inc.
