In fact it takes\nonly 100 ms to determine the attractiveness of a face (Willis and Todorov, 2006). Faces\nthat are more symmetrical, closer to the norm, or show greater evidence of estrogen or\ntestosterone are generally perceived as more attractive (Cunningham, 1986; Grammer and\nRhodes, 2006; Wong et al., 2008). The eyes receive greater attention than any other feature\nof the face (Althoff and Cohen, 1999; Davies and Hoffman, 2002) and provide important\ncues that influence attraction during social interactions. Dilated pupils indicate emotional\nThe limbal ring\narousal (Bradley, Miccoli, Escrig, and Lang, 2008) and are rated more attractive by males\nand females (Tombs and Silverman, 2004). Observers prefer a direct gaze when judging the\nattractiveness of a happy face, more than when judging the attractiveness of a disgusted\nface, and this difference in preference is greater when viewing a face of the opposite sex\n(Conway, Jones, DeBruine, and Little, 2008). Here we show that a feature of the eye called\nthe limbal ring also affects facial attractiveness.\nThe limbal ring appears as a dark annulus outlining the iris. This outline can be\ncaused by pigmentation of the peripheral iris or by the internal optics of the eye (Shyu and\nWyatt, 2009). The visibility of the limbal ring can be decreased or completely removed by\na variety of medical conditions that affect the transparency of the peripheral cornea. These\ninclude neovascularization and Pterygium related to unhealthy stem cells at the corneo-\nsclearal limbus (Ang et al., 2010; Mort, Ramaesh, Kleinjan, Morley, and West, 2009;\nSangwan, 2001; Zheng and Xu, 2008) and cloudiness caused by corneal edema or corneal\narcus (Fernandez et al., 2009; Khurana, 2007). The limbal ring also becomes less visible\ndue to conditions more closely related to advanced age such as glaucoma and arcus sinilis\n(Cavallotti and Cerulli, 2008). As demonstrated in Figure 1, the thickness of the limbal ring\nthickness of limbal rings begins to decline even in youth, before degenerative diseases\nusually begin. Thus a clearly visible limbal ring is a probabilistic indicator of both health\nand age.\nFigure 1. Limbal-ring thickness decreases as a function of age\nNote: Ellipses were drawn to fit the inner and outer boundaries of the limbal ring on faces chosen\nrandomly from www.Facity.com. Thickness was computed as the mean difference of the major and\nminor axes of the two ellipses. The thickness of the limbal ring in this graph is reported as a\nproportion of the radius of the iris, to provide a scale invariant measure.\nThe limbal ring\nThis raises the question: Are judgments of facial attractiveness shaped to use the\ninformation within the limbal ring in a potentially adaptive way? To answer this question,\nwe showed observers, on each trial, two faces that were identical except that the eyes of\none had dark limbal rings and the eyes of the other had no limbal rings. Observers chose\nwhich face was more attractive, and indicated the degree of their preference.\nMaterials and Methods\nFace stimuli\nTen male and nine female faces were selected from the PUT Face Database\n(Kasiski, Florek, and Schmidt, 2008). One additional female face from the Radboud Faces\nDatabase (Langner et al., 2010) was used to create the final set of male and female stimuli.\nOnly faces with neutral or slightly smiling expressions were used. The stimuli were edited\nin Adobe Photoshop to create versions with and without dark limbal rings. In order to\nremove any limbal ring already present in the iris, while preserving acceptable image\nquality, irises from the Database of Human Iris Images (Dobes and Machala, 2002) were\nused in place of the original iris and pupil. One unique iris was chosen for each face by\nselecting a lightly colored iris close to the eye color of the original face. Each iris image\nwas cropped to remove any limbal ring already present, and distinctive pigmentation was\nremoved that so that iris patterns would not be obviously identical in each eye. Next, a\ncircle with a radial gradient was imported from Adobe Illustrator and placed within the iris\nat fifty percent opacity to create images with dark limbal rings. Faces within each final pair\nwere identical besides the presence or absence of the limbal rings. Figure 1 shows\nexamples of male and female stimulus pairs. The final stimulus set also included mirror-\nreversed pairs to prevent confounds caused by head direction, and inverted (upside-down)\npairs to determine whether the limbal ring is processed as a local feature or a configural\nfeature. There were a total of 80 stimulus pairs. All faces had blue or light-colored eyes.\nThe limbal ring\nFigure 1. Examples of stimulus pairs, with dark limbal ring faces to the right\nThe limbal ring\nProcedure\nforced-choice face preference test. Each was seated approximately 30 inches from a 27\"\nApple iMac display, and directed to read the instructions displayed onscreen explaining\nhow to use a slider adjustment to indicate their face preference for each stimulus pair. The\nslider was moved to the left if the left face was more attractive and to the right if the right\nface was more attractive. The distance of the slider away from center indicated how much\nmore attractive one face appeared than the other. The slider could move 6 degrees in either\ndirection from center; the units used to record the slider position were 16.67 units per\ndegree.\nEach trial began with a fixation cross at the center of the screen for 750\nmilliseconds before the stimulus pair was presented. Then the observer was allowed as\nmuch time as needed to enter a rating with the slider at the bottom of the screen. Each\nimage subtended 18.8 degrees vertical visual angle and 14.1 degrees horizontal visual\nangle. The images of the pair were presented side by side, spaced 200 pixels apart, and\nsubtended a total horizontal visual angle of 28.3 degrees. Stimulus pairs were presented in\nrandomized order in two blocks separated by a 30 second break. If the limbal rings image\nof a pair appeared on the left in the first block, then it appeared on the right in the second\nblock, and vice versa. Trials were randomly mixed with an equal number of distracter trials\nin which faces varied in iris size rather than in limbal ring strength. This created a total of\n320 trials that were completed in an average time of about 30 minutes.\nResults\nObservers' ratings were assigned positive values if they moved the slider toward the\ndark limbal ring image, or negative values otherwise; mean values of zero indicate no\npreference. Right-tailed t-tests were used to determine if male and female observers\npreferred dark limbal rings in male and female stimuli. Mean ratings of all stimuli across\nmale and female observers were significantly greater than zero (t(44) = 3.68, p < .001), as\nwere mean ratings across observers when viewing only male (t(44) = 3.90, p < .001) or\nfemale (t(44) = 3.38, p = .001) faces. Male observers preferred the limbal ring in both male\nindependent-sample t-tests revealed no significant difference between male and female\n.863) faces.

Male and female ratings of attractiveness for male and female faces\nNote: Positive values indicate preference for faces with a dark limbal ring.\nDiscussion\nThe limbal ring is caused by anatomical and optical components and becomes less\nvisible with age or poor health. Male and female participants rated faces with clearly\nvisible limbal rings as more attractive, suggesting that both sexes have been shaped by\nnatural selection to use the limbal ring as a probabilistic indicator of reproductive fitness.\nInverted stimuli were included in the study to test if limbal rings are processed as\nlocal features or configural features of the face. When viewing upright faces, we exploit\nspatial relationships among facial features (i.e., their configuration), but when a face is\npresented upside-down we rely primarily on local features (e.g., the shape or color of the\neye; Diamond and Carey, 1986; Maurer, Le Grand, and Mondloch, 2002; Murray, Yong,\nand Rhodes, 2000; Rossion and Gauthier, 2002). Our finding that inverted faces are rated\nmore attractive when they have a dark limbal ring suggests that the limbal ring is processed\nas a local feature in the analysis of facial beauty. Our further finding that a dark limbal ring\nenhances attractiveness of upright faces more than of inverted faces could be interpreted as\nThe limbal ring\nindicating that the limbal ring also has some role in the configural analysis of facial beauty\n(see, e.g., B\u00e4uml, 1994). However, a more likely explanation is simply that the eyes, and\ntherefore the limbal rings, receive fewer fixations and less attention when faces are inverted\n(Barton, Radcliffe, Cherkasova, Edelman, and Intrilligator, 2006; Davies and Hoffman,\nWhen rating attractiveness of the opposite sex, men typically place more emphasis\nprinciple, the limbal ring could serve as a signal of youth: Thickness of the limbal ring\ndeclines with increasing age, as shown in Figure 1. Our data show no evidence that the\nlimbal ring affects male ratings of attractiveness differently than it affects female ratings.\nThis might indicate that the limbal ring is used as a signal of health but not of youth. Or it\nmight indicate that our experiment did not detect real differences in male and female\nratings. Our stimuli have only a dark limbal ring or no limbal ring; perhaps adding more\nsubtle variations to the limbal rings would lead to more nuanced results. It would be\ninteresting to test directly whether the limbal ring affects judgments of age. One could, for\ninstance, have observers estimate the ages of faces shown one at a time, and have each face\nappear twice at random in the sequence, once with a dark limbal ring and once with a\nminimal limbal ring. If the versions with dark rings are estimated to be significantly\nyounger, this would be good evidence that the limbal ring can affect judgments of age.\nOne might argue that the preference for a dark limbal ring in our experiment is due\nto an artifact in our stimuli: One face in each pair has no limbal ring at all, and one might\nargue that this is so unnatural that it makes the face unattractive. However, eyes with faint\nor nonexistent limbal rings are common, and there are many attractive faces with faint\nlimbal rings.\nIt may be that the preference for a dark limbal ring in our experiment is due not\nsimply to its signaling of corneal clarity and iris pigmentation, but also to enhancing of the\napparent whiteness and brightness of the sclera by increased local contrast. The relative\ncontributions of these two factors to attractiveness can be tested in future experiments by\nusing stimuli in which the scleras have been adjusted to have equal apparent brightness and\nwhiteness. Even after such an adjustment, the luminance contrast between the sclera and\niris plays a vital role in social interactions by indicating gaze direction (Ando, 2002; Sinha,\n2000). The direction of gaze is interpreted more quickly for opposite sex faces with\nexaggerated sex-typical features, suggesting that detecting the gaze of potential high-\nquality mates was an important selection pressure (Jones, Main, DeBruine, Little, and\nWelling, 2010). A dark limbal ring provides an additional contrast boundary and may\nfurther enhance gaze-dependent social interactions.\nIn principle, the limbal ring could be a rich source of probabilistic information\nabout youth and health. Our experiment shows that a dark limbal ring is more attractive\nthan no limbal ring; however, it is an interesting and open question whether human vision\nhas been shaped to exploit subtle differences in limbal rings, or whether we have been\nshaped to use simple heuristics such as \"dark is better\" or \"thick is better.\" The results\ncould have practical application: Colored contact lenses are now commercially available\nthat mimic the appearance of a limbal ring.\nThe limbal ring\nThe faces in our experiment had lightly colored irises; however, the limbal ring is\nmore difficult to detect in darker irises. Therefore the limbal ring might have less influence\non attractiveness in faces with dark irises. This is an interesting topic for further\nexperiments.\n"
