In their 1994 contribution to  a  volume  on His pan ic dru g use , Friedman, Sufia n, and Des Jarlais lament that only a few studie s re port how Latino inje c\u00ad tion dru g users (IDUs) differ  in AIDS-related  behav ior, re lations h ips, or knowledge from African-American and no n- His panic non-African-American IDUs, and we know of no studies that have syste mat ic al ly i nve stigated differences among sub sets of Latino dr ug users (2) .\n  Despite the absence  of  analyses  spec ifically  des igned to comp a re s u bgroups of Hispan ic drug use rs , a body of literature on His panic s ub group and HIV has beco me available over the past 5 years. This  li te ratur e  s uggests that Puerto Rican drug use rs are lik e ly to be at su bsta n\u00ad tially higher risk for contracting HIV than Mexican or Mexican-American dru g use r , and that th is is likely to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe due to a hi ghe r i nc ide nce of i nject io n practices amo ng Puerto Rican  d rug use rs.  In  th is pape r, we  rev ie w  th is d ise ase statu and ri k be havior li te rature and cons ide r how the risk of vario us s ub groups m ig ht be estimated.\n\n\n  Puerto R ic a n p opulatio ns experience highe r rates of num ero us adverse he alth co nd itio ns than o the r Hispanic population s (3- 5). Data  on  HIV  and  AIDS  prevalence amo ng Hisp anics are co ns iste nt with this  pattern.  HIV sero prevale nce (6,7), AIDS prevalence (8), and AIDS mortality (9) have been fo und to be sub stantia ll y higher amo ng Pue rto Ricans than amo ng other Hispa nics, and low e r amo ng Hispan ics of Mex ic an ances try.\n  To ide nti fy behavioral factor s that ma y ha ve co ntrib\u00ad uted to thi  HIV-disease  pattern  a mong  Hispa nic  ,  re\u00ad searc hers have often use d the U.S. Centers for Di ease Control and Preve nt ion (CDC) ' s transm iss io n route clas\u00ad sification   y  tern.  Among  the  CDC's  class ificatio n  ,  il\u00ad le gal drug in jection  has  been  ide nt ified  a  the trans m is\u00ad s io n route mo s t co mmon amo ng Pue rto Rican s with AIDS, whereas male- male sex is ident ified as the co m\u00ad monest route among othe r sub group s of Hi panics with AIDS (10). A survey of Latin os with AIDS by Dia z and Kleve ns (1 1)  an d  the  sero prevalence  s ur vey  cited  (7) le nd further sup port to the notio n that Pue rto Rica ns are mor e likely than other His panic s to be IDUs. Conversely, Pue rto Rican respo nd e nts to the National Hea l t h Inter\u00ad view Survey- AIDS Supplement  were  no  more lik  e ly than Mexican-American respond e nts to  report  injection drug use o r other h igh- risk behaviors (12).\n\nBehavioral  Ris k\n\n  The cited stud ies c omp are disease rates  and  risk  be\u00ad hav iors  for  different  Hispani c  po pul ations.  Howeve r, ne ith er disea se rate nor risk  behavior  rates  offer  ad\u00ad equate i nfo rmation o n behaviora l risk, the degree of risk attac he d to specif i c kinds  of  behav iors  for  s pecific grou ps. To meas ur e behav io ral risk, researchers  use  i n\u00ad fo rmatio n on disease state, behavi or, and other relevant phenome na to an\u00b7ive at an es timation of ri k. This esti\u00ad mation represents the  probability  that  a  member  of  group X will acq uir e the di ease from  behavior  Y,  given  a specific set of assumptions.\n  Previous studi es have est i mated the relative  risk  of AIDS fo r me mbers of the Hispanic  population  in  the United States compared wit h the no n-Hi sp anic  wh ite popul atio n ( J 3) and the relative risk of AIDS for  mem\u00ad bers of variou Hispanic  subpopulation  s  in  the  United States by birthplace given certain disposing behavior cat-\n\n\n\negories (14). The ava ilabili ty of pu bli s hed est i mates  of the probability of HIV transm iss ion for va rio us r isk be\u00ad haviors  now  makes  it  poss ible  to  esti mate  the  ri  k  to wh ic h differently situated i nd ivid uals are exposed as a result of the ir behav iors. To  o ur  knowledge,  Smith  and co lleag ues' presentation at the 1 993 International Con\u00ad ference on AIDS represents the on ly  attempt  to  arrive  at suc h an estimation (] 5). Their estim atio n method incor\u00ad porated in fo rmatio n about indi vidu a ls' HIV-r elevant be\u00ad haviors; specifical ly, it  incorporated  information  about types of sex ual contacts, rates of co nd om  use , and  num\u00ad ber of partners (15). In this paper , we propo  e  to estim ate the risks of differently situated person with i n three His\u00ad panic subpo pulations. Like Smith and co lleag ues' esti\u00ad mation met ho d, the estimatio n method use d he re inco r\u00ad porates info rma tion  about  behaviors.  Unlike  the  earlier re port ,  thee  timatio n  method  u  ed  here also  incorporates i nfo rmatio n abo ut the soc ial c ontext (specifica ll y, the city) in which suc h behaviors occ ur.\n\nMETHODS\n\n  Data for this study were co llected from samp les of out-of-tr ea tm en t long-te nn drug users at 1 8 s ites in the  nit ed  States as part of the first wave of a longi tudinal mu lt is ite interve ntion s t udy  on drug use , HIV ris k behaviors, and risk-red uc tion  outcomes s uppo rted  by the National l nstit ute on Drug Abuse (the Cooperative Agreement for AIDS Com\u00ad mun it y- Based Outre ach/Inter ve ntion Resear c h).  Targeted  snowball sa mpl i ng methods adapted to the ide ntifi cat ion and rec ru itm e nt of hid\u00ad den popu lations we re  use d  to obta in  the  study  sam ple  ( J 6).  To  be e li gible for the study , i ndi viduals  were  required  to  have  injected  an il l icit s ubstan ce during the last 30 days or smoked crack coca ine at least once during the previous 48 hour s and not  to have  been  in drug  treat\u00ad me nt dur in g th e 30 days prior to part icipation. ln add ition, study par\u00ad ticipants were re qu ired to be 1 8 years of age or older, to res ide withi n the boundar ies of the targeted areas, a nd LO s ign an informed co n e nt. All c andidates were req uir ed to prov ide a urine sa mpl e, which was scree ned  fo r cocai ne  a nd opio id  metab oli te  . Cand idates  clai m in g drug inj ec tio n we re req ui red to show rece nt need le- t rack markin g. Th ose who claimed Lo have s mok ed crack cocaine mu st have had pos iti ve urine screens for coca in e to be included in rhe stud y. Sub jects who did not meet the e li gi bili ty c riteria were de le ted from the samp le.\n  Partic i pants w ho could not pro vide a ver i fiable address and te le\u00ad pho ne num ber for reco nt ac t in the fol low-up wave of the study were not i nclu ded. Int erviews were conducted in private settings by trained in \u00ad terv ie wers ,  usu a.11y  at  researc h  ce nters  loc ated  in  the  neigh borhoods from which study participants were rec ruited. Partici pants were re mu \u00ad nerated for their time ; this fee varied by site.\n\nMeasures\n\n  The Ri k Behavior Assess me nt (RBA) was used to coll ec t informa\u00ad tion about nee dle risk behaviors , sex ris k behav io rs, a nd demo gra ph ics ( 1 7). The re li abilit y and vali dity of the drug use and sex ua l behavior items on  this instrument  have been demo ns trated (J 8). Behavioral ques\u00ad\ntions in the RBA so lici ted information on the number of times and the number of  people with whom  a re  pondent engaged  in  needle  use  and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsexual ri sk behav i ors durin g  the  30 days  before being interviewed. Th ese behavioral self -reports were used to compute estim ates of HIV transmissi on ri sk . A more complete desc ripti on of the measur es used in\nthi s stud y is avail able from the corr esponding author.\n \nJn additi on to estim ating each respondent's overall ri sk, estimates were made of the ri sk from each risk behavior separat el y. That i s, calculations as in Eq u atio n I were perform ed for each ri sk behavior.\n\nOverall ri sk and ri sk s from sp eci fic behavi ors were estimated usin g\n\nRi sk; =  I  -  ( I  -  r;);\"\n\n\nnumber s of ri sk acts describ ed in the RBA. Thirty-day  frequencies of two injection ri sk behavi ors were estimated: inj ecting wit h a needle (or syringe or \" works\") that had been previously used by another person, and usi ng cooker, co tton, and /or rin se water that had been used by someone el se. Thirt y- day frequ encies of sex- ri sk behav iors were handl ed in a si mil ar way to injection ri sks . Eig ht sex- ri sk behaviors were estimated from RBA  responses. N u mber  of  insertive  and recep\u00ad ti ve, vagin al and anal sex acts in the previous 30 days were reported. Report s were furth er subdi vid ed by how of ten a condom was used and not used. Each resp ondent was asked about the number of sex acts with mal e partners and female partn ers separately.\nFrequencies of inj ection and sexual behaviors were used to com pute\nan estim ate of the respondent' s overall risk of HIV in fecti on durin g the previous 30 days. O verall transmissi on ri sk was consid ered  to be a fun ction of the number of  occa  ions  of  each  ri  k  behavior  and  the indi vidual transmissi on ri sk for  each behavior (20).  For  the  IO mea\u00ad sur ed ri sk behaviors (2 injection ri sk and 8 sex ri sk behav iors). overall transmissi on ri sk was esti mated as:\n\n     Ill\n\nwhere I ; i s the per-act HI V transmissio n probabilit y of risk behav ior i, and n; i s the number of tim es ri sk  behav ior i occurred during the past 30 day s for I O ri sk behav iors. The per-act transmissi on probabilit y depends both on the transmission rate and on the prevalence of HI V in the relevan t population:\n\nwhere p, i s the prevalence of HIV in the population of partn ers fo r ri sk behav ior i and /; is the rate o f transmissi on of HI V for risk behav ior i. The relevant populati on was taken to be the cit y or metropolitan area. Populati on prevalence of HIV (p;) was estimated based on the metro\u00ad polit an A I DS preval ence rate where the data were coll ected ( 10). A I DS pr evalence can  be used  as a rough estim ate of  HIV  prevalence.  An  e ti mate of the local HIV pr eval ence rate was computed by di viding the 1996  number  of  cumulati ve  A IDS  cases  by  the  1996 estimated  cit y\npopulation for each metropo li tan area from which data were draw n.\n  Per-act transmi ssi on ri sk probabiliti es /f) were imput ed based on the\nbest avail abl e esti mates of transmission ri sk probabiliti es. A t the tim e o f the analysi s, th best per-act  transmission ri sk  estimates  were as foll ows:\n\n shar ed cooker, cotton, and  water, / 2  = 0.000067,  set  at  I %  of  the inj ecti on transmissi on rate; no publi shed esti mates of this valu e were found\n vagin al sex from male to femal e with out a condom, / 3 = 0.00 I\n recepti ve anal  sex  with out a condom, /  =  0.02 ( 19)\n \nRisk behav iors were assumed to be relati vely stabl e and to extend into the past. B ecause HI V has a long incubatio n peri od (32,33), 30-day ri sks were projected over a I 0-yea r peri od according to the formula (3):\n      I 0-year ri sk = I -  ( I - ri sk) 120[4]\n  To establi sh the vali di ty of  esti mated ri sk , the cumul ative I 0-year ri sk estimate was related to HIV serostatus in the sample. Respond ents who had previou sl y been told they were HIV posi ti ve were excl ud ed from the anal ysi s, as were those who were not te red for HIV . A r-test comparin g I 00 cases testi ng posi ti ve for HIV to I 633 cases testi ng negati ve for HI V found si gni ficantly greater ri sk on the overall measure\nfor  the  HI V  positi ve cases  (r  =  3.64).  Those respondents who were\nHIV negati ve  had  an esti mated  10-year  ri sk  o f  9.9%,  whereas those respondents were HIV posi ti ve had an estim ated 10-year ri sk of 19.4%.\n\nIndependent Variables\n  Cases from the Cooperati ve Agreement dataset who identi fi ed them\u00ad sel ves as M exic an Am eri can, M exican, or Puerto Ri can and who were recruit ed from ites in the continental U nit ed States were selected for this study. Dumm y  variabl e  were  created  for  self -identi fi cation  as M exican and Puerto Ri can. M ex ican- Ameri can sel f-id enti f ication was used as the resid ual category. Gender was coded 0 = male and I = female. Thirt y-day income was selected to measure inc ome. Educa\u00ad tional aua in ment was mea ured with a 3-point scale, in whi ch I rep\u00ad resented having less than a hi gh school education, 2 represented havin g recei ved onl y a hi gh school education or a general educati onal dipl oma (G ED), and 3 represented havin g more than a high school educati on, for instance, trade school or coll ege.\n  I njection drug use was created as a dummy vari ab le for respondents who reported hav ing ever inj ected drugs. Prev i ous experi ence of HIV testin g as a control vari able to account for possibl e effects of k nowl\u00ad edge of personal  erostatus on ri sk behavi or. Respondents who reported a previous HIV blood test (not includin g the HIV  test  admini stered during parti cipation in this stud y) were coded as h avi ng had experience of HI V testin g. To control for possible effects of age on ri sk, the current study used sel f-reported age, a continuous vari ab le. Respondent s who reported sex in the previo us 30 days with  a pa rtner of the  ame gender or who identi fi ed them el ves as gay, lesbi an or bisex ual were coded as havi ng had a same-gender (\" same-sex\") partner.\n  Geographic region has been found to predict  HIV  seroprevalence rates (34,35). M ontoya  and  A tki nson (36)  found that geographic  loca\u00ad ti on, as proxim atel y measured by time zone, correctly classi fi ed cit ies accordi ng to high, moderate, and low HIV -seroprevalence rates. T here\u00ad fore, tim e zone was in cluded in this study as a control for geographic effects. Westwardn ess ( ti me zone) of each si te was measured by  as\u00ad si gning the si te an integer from I to 5, where  I  represented  Eastern time, 2 represented Central time, 3 represented M ountain time, 4 rep\u00ad resented Pacifi c time, and 5 repr esemed Ala ska tim e.\n\nRESULTS\n  T he 366 0 Hispanic s selec ted for thi study were drawn from 18 sites of the Cooperative Agreement, as shown in F igure  J.

A  la rge  body  of ev ide nce has sug gested that race and ethn ic it y are im\u00ad portant determ i na nt s of ris k behav io r. How eve r, most researc h that examines the effect of race/e thnic ity on  risk be hav io r amon g His pan ics aggregates all Hispa n ic s u b\u00ad gro u ps i nt o a si ng le  c atego ry.  Res u lt  of  this analysis s how that suc h an approac h mask s c ritic al d iffere nce betwee n Hi s pan ic ub group s and that d ifferenc es  within a give n race/ethnicity are signi ficant facto rs  in determin\u00ad i ng  esti mated  ris k  for HIV.  In  particular ,  th is pa pe r s hows that the es timated HIV risk amo ng s ub gro up s of His pan ic drug use rs is s ign ifica nt ly  higher  for  Puerto R ic ans  than it  is  for  Mexic ans  or  Mexican  Amer ic ans i nd e pe nd e ntly of soc io demog raph ic facto rs, sex ual pref\u00ad erenc e , and geog rap h ic time zone .\nBecause  of  the way the estim ated HIV  risk was com\u00ad\nputed, the highe r est im ated HIV ris k for  Puerto  Rica ns, as compared with o the r H is panic s ub g roups, may be the res u lt of behavioral ris k d ifferen ces or  HIV prev ale nce d iffere nce s. T hu s, the hi gh est imated HIV ris k amo ng Puerto Ric ans, as compared  with  that  of  othe r His pan ic s u bgrou ps, may be the result of the ir re lati ve ly h ig her\n\n\nL}A IDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Vol. 21, No. I , M ay I , /999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum bers of risk behavior acts and/o r the h ighe r HIV prevalence in the cities where they l i ve . By est i mati ng HIV risk using ris k be hav io rs a nd co mm unit y HIV prevalence  toget her ,  a  more  comp le te  est imate  of the d is tr ibution of HIV risk among  His pani cs  ca n  be  ob\u00ad tai ne d.\n  T heoretic ally , a  relationship  exists  between  risk  be\u00ad hav io rs and HIV prevaJence. Philipson and Posner (37) argue  that  if  the HIV preva lence within a  community in c reases, the likelihood of indi vidu als engagin g in risk behavior will decrea se. This occurs  beca use  as  the  prob\u00ad ab ility of HIV in fecti on increases, the price  of  ris k  be\u00ad hav i o r  (in  terms  of  i lln ess  and  suffering)  i ncre ases ; he nce, risk behavior wi ll  decrease.  Thus,  it  is  expected that i nd i vid uals  li vi ng in a reas  with a hi gh HIV  preva\u00ad le nce wi ll be less willing to s hare syri nges or have un \u00ad protected ex. Future research shou ld examine the re la\u00ad tionship between ris k behavior and HIV prevalence  rates amo ng the gene ral popu lation and es pec ially amo ng His\u00ad panics.\nIn th is s tud y, i nco me was fo und to have a positive\neffect on es timate d HIV risk. It is certai n ly possible that extra i nco me is used  to buy  more drugs  i nstead of  clea n s yr i nges. A pos iti ve coeffic ient on i nc ome could also mea n that c ities with a h igher HIV prevalence have, in gene ral, hi gher i nc omes than c ities with lower HIV prevalence. This may he lp  ex plain  the  hi gher HIV  risk est i mates amon g Pue rto Ricans. Although this analys is acco unt ed fo r geograp hi c loc atio n as meas ur ed by ti me zone , most of the Pue rto Ric ans l ived in the New York City me tro polita n a rea, whe re the cost of livin g is h igher than in o ther locatio ns. C urr e nt research supp orted by the Nat io na l Institute of Drug Ab use (NID A) on soc ial net\u00ad wo rks mi ght he lp determine whe the r (a nd why) higher i nco me ind ividu als engage in ris k behaviors with ot he r h ighe r i ncome i nd i vid ual s, or whet her they engage in ris k behavior s with lo wer income i nd i vid uals. T h is wi ll he l p researcher s determine how much ris k behavior or what types of risk behav io rs are d rive n by eco nom ic factors and how much are driven by othe r soc ial factors. Because cle ar d iffe re nces a re prese nt in HIV est i mated risk a mong Hisp an ic s ub group s in specific behavioral doma i ns, the next lin e of researc h need s to addre ss those factors that account for those  differe nces .  Associations with different econo mic , sociol ogic , and psychological influences sho ul d be exp lo red before definite  conclu\u00ad sions are drawn. For instance this stud y did not  permit us to i nvest igate the effects of accu ltu ration and religio s ity on risk behav io rs (38). Future stud ies buildin g on the existing eth no graph ic li te rature and inco rpora ti ng de\u00ad tailed eli c itat io n resea rc h are ne eded to account more\n\n\nthoroughly  for  the  link  observed  here  between different et hn ic su bgroups and ex ual and need le-s hari ng ris ks.\n  Moreover , the combin ed effects of soc ioeconom ic de\u00ad privation and rac ia l segregation  hou ld be exp lo red.  So\u00ad cia l isolation a nd racia l se gregation have long been as\u00ad sociated with higher rates of drug  us e , early  ini tiation of sex ual ac tivity, and other health ris ks (39,40). Further research sho uld exp lo re the exact mechanism by whic h these factors contribute to  risky  behaviors  amo ng  His\u00ad panic su bgroups.\n  Some limitatio ns of the stud y amp le s ho u ld be enu\u00ad merated. First, the samp le use d in th is s tudy was a tar\u00ad geted samp le of ID Us and crack cocaine us er s who were not in treatment. The refo re, gene rali zation sho u ld not be exte nd ed to othe r types of drug use rs, to drug use rs in treatment , o r to nond rug use r . Moreover , give n that the targeted population is h idden , the resea rche r  has  no  way of know ing whether the samp le obtained re present s th i population  as  regards  age,  ge nde  r,  and  other demo\u00ad grap hi c c hara cte ri tics.\nThis stud y is the first to quantify d ifference in est i\u00ad\nmated HIV ris k amo ng three su bgroup of Hisp an ic drug use rs. As suc h, it le aves us w ith intriguing questions regarding spec ific facto rs that may he l p exp lain the  be\u00ad hav io ral  differe nces  reported  here .  Broad  ethni c  labels s uc h as Puerto R ic a n,  Mexican,  or Mexican  American are but a first step in telling us  abo ut  the  way  the specific cu ltur al processes of these sub groups interact with  indi\u00ad vid ual c haracte rist i c to in fl uence behavior (41,42). Measurement of other soc ial factors in f utur e hea lth be\u00ad havio r s tud i es , parti c u la rly when these tud ies targe t groups out s ide the dominant cultur e, will be helpful in developing and implementing app ropriate  intervention progra ms fo r eac h of these Hispanic su bgrou ps.\n\n  "
