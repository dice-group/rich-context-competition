The existing paradigm, in this case, the culture of performativity in educa-\ntion, through its obeisance to marks, grades, and detention as indicators of learning and\nmerit, feeds off and in turn sustains beliefs in the role of education in maintaining the\nsocial status quo.\nThe provisions of the RTE Act 2009 were built to work together as an organic unit to\nsupport the well acknowledged principle that knowledge cannot simply be transferred\nfrom teacher to pupil. Using this principle known as constructivism, which also under-\nlies Argyris's single-loop learning, each child constructs her own understanding and\nlearning. The teacher acts as a facilitator by continuously observing and assessing what\nthe child has understood, and on this basis proceeding to clarify or add information. This\nprocess of continuous comprehensive evaluation was mandated in the RTE to enhance\nboth learning and inclusion. Academic authorities under the RTE Act were notified by\nthe central and state governments for prescription of curriculum and evaluation proce-\ndures in conformity with the framework of the NCF 2005.\nHowever, as this article shows, it was found that instead of the intended CCE based\non the NCF 2005, another procedure, also incidentally named CCE, was being imple-\nmented. This CCE process with a system of assessment that was internal to the school\nhad been developed (at short notice) for the secondary stage to replace the 10th class\nboard examinations of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).\nThe manner in which policy implementation can go astray has been demonstrated in\nthis article as it attempts to describe and explain the appeal of this CCE, which came\nneither from the authorized academic authority nor was appropriate for the stage at\nwhich it came to be widely adopted. The article dwells\non the policy actors, their motivations and interests, and\nthis all too hasty application of CCE which predictably\nfailed to enhance learning at the developmental stage\nat which it was applied. The ricocheting effects of this\nmisapplication have led to the RTE Act being placed in\nParliament to allow the state to bring back the pass\u00adfail\nsystem, and the culture of performativity and exclu-\nsion at the elementary stage that the RTE Act had aimed\nat eradicating.\nIn conclusion, this article returns to implications of this\ncase for any cultural change in public policy without\nfirst changing the social norms that sustain such policies\nof exclusion.\nAs undergraduate students of psychology, one\nof our first `experiments' in the psychology lab\nwas on `knowledge of results'. Here, a `subject'\n(usually a wary student from another course) was\nblindfolded and instructed to turn a pointer on its pivot\nto make an angle of 45 degrees, 30 degrees, etc. Subjects\nwho were told how close they came to the required\ntarget were found to progressively improve with each\nattempt, while the subjects who were given no such\nsimultaneous feedback of assessment, or `knowledge\nof results', did not.\nI was unimpressed by this introduction to the psy-\nchology of learning; did something as obvious as this\nreally need to be demonstrated by an experiment?\nToday, I worry that this fundamental principle seems\nto be overlooked to ensure that every child learns. This\nhappens, even as the right to education and learning is\navowed as integral to the 12th plan agenda of inclusive\ngrowth. Issues of annual surveys of learning achieve-\nment in schools, of reintroduction of 10th class board\nexaminations, and a return of detention policies domi-\nnate current emanations from the NITI Aayog, the\nCentral Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and\nthe Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE),\nrespectively--all apparently in an endeavour to ensure\nthe betterment of learning for all children in schools.\nForegrounding these is the disenchantment with\nContinuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), a\ncurricular intervention intended to ensure that every\nchild learns through the institutionalization of a\nprocess that is child-centred, integral to the learning\nprocess and of benefit to both \"learners themselves and\nto the educational system by giving credible feedback\"\nIn 2009, the Right to Education (RTE) Act had man-\ndated `continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE)\nof a child's understanding and ability to apply the\nsame' (Section 29.2.h) to complement policies such as no\ndetention and age appropriate admission at the elemen-\ntary stage among its slew of reform measures having\nthe potential to transform the institutional structure\nand climate of elementary education in India (Kumar,\n2017). Simultaneously, for the secondary stage, the CBSE\nannounced a paradigm shift from examination to effec-\ntive pedagogy in the replacement of its 10th class board\nexams with school-based evaluation--CCE with effect\nHowever, barely after it lifted off, CCE is in trouble\nat both the elementary and the secondary stages.\nexpressing concern at \"deteriorating learning outcomes\nit was resolved, to amend the no-detention policy by\nmaking suitable amendments to the RTE Act\", and\nin August 2017, a Bill in Parliament to this effect was\nreturn of pass\u00adfail exams in elementary classes will\nmake CCE redundant at the elementary stage. While at\nthe secondary stage, the announcement, almost imme-\ndiately thereafter, by the CBSE, of the restoration of\n10th class board exams for the 10th grade from the year\nstage (CBSE Circular No. Acad-05).\nThe culture of performativity in education--a term\nusedbyStephenJ.Ball(2000)todescribesociety'sobses-\nsion with statistics, testing, grades, and goals--has\noften been rued in reiterating that education should be\nabout all round development of potential rather than\nabout marks in an annual exam. In this context, there-\nfore, this article attempts to understand this rejec-\ntion of CCE--a system which had sought to counter\nthis culture of performativity through a child-centred\nintervention rooted in the principle of simultaneous\nfeedback in order to ensure that every child learns.\nThe article reflects on the research on CCE in prac-\ntice, using the lens of organizational theory to draw\nimplications for the success and sanguinity of future\nattempts at ensuring that each child is learning. At\nthe outset, however, this article explains how learning\nis constructed--a process which those familiar with\norganization theory will recognize as akin to single-\nIn order to understand how the RTE Act attempted to\nfacilitate learning, one first needs to appreciate the\nprocess of learning itself. Frequently conceptualized as\nthe filling of a jar, it has for long been recognized that\nlearning is not as simple as transferring knowledge\nfrom one mind to another. For instance, all students on\nhearing the same lecture do not acquire the same knowl-\nedge, and will not reproduce it like a tape playing back\na recording. The fact that every child understands and\nlearns differently tells us that the process of learning\ninvolves connecting new information to existing under-\nstanding and constructing new knowledge with the help\nof cognitive resources, tools, and social interactions.\nIf knowledge cannot be transferred, then the teacher\ncannot be a giver but the facilitator of that knowledge.\nWithin classroom interaction, the child makes explicit\nhis/her current understanding (and is thus an active\npartner and not a passive receiver)--thereby enabling\na teacher to correct, clarify, add, and further facilitate\nthe construction of knowledge in a continuous process\nof assessing, evaluating, and facilitating. The process\nof learning thus builds on a student's existing knowl-\nedge, with facilitation from the teacher. Known as\nconstructivism, this paradigm of learning is at the core\nof the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005.\nThis along with a process of CCE, of what needs to be\ndone next to facilitate learning by the teacher, has been\ndescribed as `two of the most progressive measures to\nreconceptualise and re-imagine what was essentially\na rote-based education system' (Economic & Political\nThe similarity of this process toArgyris and Schon's (1978)\nsingle-loop learning might immediately be apparent to\nstudents of organizational theory, for it too is grounded\nin constructivism (Kinsella, 2006). Furthermore, an under-\nstanding of the learning loop and the management of\norganizationallearningasinterdependentprocessesallow\none to more readily appreciate the clauses of the RTE Act\n2009 that sought to make provision for the enabling condi-\ntions for a constructivist process of teaching and learning\nin classrooms.\nThe RTE Act restricts class sizes, to a maximum of 40\nchildren at the primary stage and to 35 children per class\nfor grades 6\u00ad8, to ensure that the teacher may devote\nthe individual attention necessary to active engagement\nand discovery of each child's current state of knowl-\nedge. To empower teachers to devote themselves solely\nto teaching (and escape deployment for cattle censuses,\netc.), the RTE Act prohibits non-teaching duties except\nfor those related to election, census, and disaster\nmanagement. A teacher's duty has been for the first\ntime been specified by law, as are a minimum number\nof school working days and teacher working hours\n(distinct from instructional hours). Clauses provide\nfor teachers to be professionally trained, and for their\nservice conditions and remunerations to be according\nto declared norms--a sore point with schools gaining\nfrom exploitation of the teacher labour market.\nAll children must only be in full-time formal schools\n(and not in part-time non-formal education centres for\nthe poor). For the first time in India, a school is defined\nby law and norms for basic infrastructure (like an\nall-weather building, etc.) prescribed.\nWith schools, teachers, and children in place, the RTE\nAct mandates the conditions for learning and construc-\ntion of knowledge--a school environment without\ncorporal punishment, fear, or threats. A provision for\nno-detention, already a policy in 23 states, was put\ninto the law. If education is child-centred, active, and\nfocused upon all-round development, then evaluation\nhas necessarily to be an ongoing process of observation\nand correction. Therefore, CCE was mandated as part\nof the teaching\u00adlearning process.\nThus, in the RTEAct, learning is understood as being con-\nstructed in a process very similar to Argyris and Schon's\nsingle-loop learning through a continuous process of\ndetection and correction of error, while other clauses of\nthe Act put together the conditions for such learning to\ntake place, which, as in the case of Senge's learning organ-\nizations (Senge, 1990), work together as a system.\nWorking together as a system, the RTEAct had the poten-\ntial for actualizing individual goals of personal learning\nand national goals of the right of elementary education\nof each and every child. Perhaps, this strength was also\nits weakness. The removal of any one key element also\nhad the potential to unravel it.\nThe term CCE is indigenous in its genesis. CCE was rec-\nommended as an alternative to annual examinations\nin the report of the India Education Commission (1964-\n66, also referred to as Kothari Commission), and reiter-\nated in the National Policy on Education, 1986. Evolving\nrecommended it as a system of evaluation `integral to\nthe teaching learning process' (Sharma, 2014, p. 3). CCE\ninvolving `ongoing observational and qualitative assess-\nments of children and the use of feedback within learning\nactivities using a \"daily dairy\" as the tool in this process\nwas advised by the National Curriculum Framework\nof assessment for learning and has been described as `an\nIndian form of formative assessment' (Sreekanth, 2017,\np. 3). CCE primers produced by the National Council of\nEducational Research and Training (NCERT, n.d.) demon-\nstrate its use for all subjects at the elementary stage.\nFor the secondary stage, the CBSE conceptualized CCE\nas sets of `formative assessments' (FAs), the scores\nfor which, fed into the scores of term-end tests called\n`summative assessments' (SAs) that provided a final\nscore at the end of each grade. Worldwide, the process of\nFAis used by teachers and students to provide feedback\nduring instruction in order to adjust ongoing teaching\nand learning. Acknowledged as a route to raising\nstudent achievement, the term FA has acquired a buz-\nzword status (Louie et al., 2011). SA, in contrast to FA,\ninvolves tests or regular activities separate from the\nteaching\u00adlearning process, such as in tests at the end of\na completion of a chapter or at the end of term.\nResearch studies on implementation of the CCE report\nconfusion among teachers and parents about CCE\nscared of CCE as the students.\nThe system of evaluation, instead of becoming inte-\ngrated into the process of teaching and learning, were\nfelt as an extra burden. The shifting of focus away from\nteaching\u00adlearning to the process of assessment and\nrecord-keeping, and of time being wasted in the process\nof maintaining records, were a common refrain from\nthat students feel that it will mean more assessments for\nthem on an ongoing basis. Teachers feel that their work\nhas increased tremendously with assessments having\nadditional descriptive indicators.\nIn place of the envisaged flexibility in curriculum trans-\naction, it was found that `the requirements of following\ncertain formats has come to dominate schooling and\nthat teachers fulfil the needs of the CBSE\u00adCCE in a\nThe situation was not much different at the elemen-\ntary stage in government schools. In a study of CCE\nprogrammes of 12 states and union territories (UT)\nacross India, it was found that instead of following the\nmore flexible pattern advised by the NCERT, the CCE\nmaterial of most states comprised of `formal prescrip-\ntive and rigid recording procedures of the FAs' (Sharma,\npractice of `gathering information of child's learning\nprogress through different cycles of FAs and SAs is\nbeing used to label her/him with a particular level and\nis beating the purpose of assessment for learning and\nthe teaching\u00adlearning process itself, far from becoming\nchild-centred, `continues to be teacher centred and\nfocussed on rote memorisation, choral repetition and\nthe copying kind of drill-oriented activities'. The main-\ntaining of records too had become dissociated from\nwhat was taking place in the classroom and,\n[t]he most disturbing finding from the field was that\nacross states and schools, CCE records are exclusively\nmaintained for showing supervisors, and for reporting\nto parents, never for understanding students learning\nprogress, gaps and needs. Recording of assessment find-\nings (qualitative or marks/grades) seems to be an end in\nThese disparaging research reports on the CCE add\nto the negative opinions expressed in meetings of the\nCommittee for Assessment and Implementation of CCE\nin the context of the No-Detention Provision in the RTE\nAct set up in 2012 (also known as the Geeta Bhukkal\nCommittee). At the final meeting of this subcommittee,\nthe chairperson summarized its views thus:\nIn all the field visits undertaken by the sub-committee\nand in class room interactions with the student, teachers\nand parents, there is a common perception about negative\nimpact of No Detention policy. All of them have expressed\na need for detention policy if the performance of schools\nand students have to be improved. So many states raised\nthis issue in the CABE meeting because they are dealing\nwith field responses. In the state legislative assemblies,\nEducation Ministers are being questioned on the rationale\nand implication of introducing No Detention policy.\nIn Haryana, Call Attention motions have been moved on\nthe subject. If the records of other state assemblies are exa-\nmined, such discussions are likely to be available. This\nwas a demand for re-examination of this provision by\nlarge number of states which led to constitution of the\nSub-Committee to review this matter in detail....\n(Report of the `Committee for Assessment and Implem-\nentation of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation\n[CCE] in the context of the No Detention Provision in the\nExpectedly, this subcommittee recommended amend-\nment of the roll-out plan of no-detention; and their\nadvice for `a system of state-wide assessment at grades\n3, 5 and 8--with no detention up to grade 5, provisional\npromotion after grade 5 and detention after level 8', all\nAs observed earlier, contrary to the high expectations\nfrom CCE in bringing about a transformation in the\neducation system, through a process of FA integrated\ninto the teaching learning process, what transpired\nwas quite reverse. Not only were CCE/no-detention\nresisted politically but field experiences of CCE too\nbelied the anticipated freedom from examinations,\nstress reduction, and child-centred flexibility in curric-\nulum transaction.\nMoreover, although two variants of CCE were available\n(one developed by the NCERT for the elementary stage\nand the other by the CBSE), in the field the variants of\nthe CBSE model (characterized by FA scores added to\nSA scores) were predominantly found to be in use in\nmost states--even at the elementary stage, and also\nin central schools such as Kendriya Vidyalayas, and\nJawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (for which the NCERT\nwas the notified academic authority for curriculum and\nevaluation under the RTE Act).\nASSESSMENT\nThe findings from research studies that the CCE in\npractice (predominantly the CBSE model of CCE) was\nconfusing and burdensome instead of stress reducing\nand learning enhancing prompts questions about why\nit was perceived that way.\nCloser examination of the CBSE manual (CBSE, 2010a)\nand the procedures for FA reveals an operationaliza-\ntion of FA inconsistent with internationally accepted\ndefinitions such as those of UNESCO's International\nBureau of Education (IBE; 2013)2 which stipulates FA\nas integral to the teaching\u00adlearning process, involving\nstudents in the process of assessment and feeding\nback to inform students and the adaptation of ongoing\ncurriculum transaction. Globally, FA is understood as a\n`process' (and therefore not marked or graded, as was\ndone in the case of the FAs of the CBSE)--`any assess-\nment system that involves tests or regular activities that\nare interpreted in relation to performance criteria and\nwhich are reported are deemed summative assessment\nof learning' (Brown, 2013, p. 2). Recognizing the intri-\ncacy of this process, Black (2007) explains:\nA frequent misunderstanding is that any assessment by\nteachers, and in particular the use of a weekly test to\nproduce a record of marks, constitutes formative assess-\nment.Itdoesnot.Unlesssomelearningactionfollowsfrom\nthe outcomes, such practice is merely frequent summa-\ntive assessment: the key feature, interaction through\nfeedback, is missing. Another misunderstanding is the\nbelief that this is about the coursework assessment that\nforms part of some GCSEs; such assessment cannot\naid learning unless there is active feedback to improve\nCBSE's operationalization of FA as marked FAs and\nadded to SAs (end of term SA) has evoked academic\ncensure. Even the report of the Geeta Bhukkal\nCommittee set up in 2012 notes that academic member\nVinod Raina questioned the lack of coherence between\nCCE of NCERT and CBSE, and reported inadequa-\ncies in the understanding of CCE; academic member\nDr Kiran Devendra of NCERT is quoted as having\n`expressed concern on conducting more number of\ntests in the name of CCE'; and that academic member\nProfessor Nargis Panchpakesan, `criticised that most\nof the schools are adopting CBSE CCE against NCERT\nsystem of examinations is being merely dressed up in\na new set of terms (formative and summative assess-\nment, scholastic and co-scholastic domains, and the\nlike) instead of the necessary holistic shift in approach\nto assessment that is actually called for'. While\nsion of the assessment of the so-called scholastic areas\nor curricular areas into FA and SA as the CBSE's major\ncontribution to the evolution of the CCE framework'.\nSreekanth (2017) raised objections to `a centralised\nprescription and monitoring mechanism [which] takes\naway the essence of FA' (p. 13) and to the summing up\nof FA and SA scores, `aggregating the two together to\nproduce end of year grades is questionable' (p. 4).\n`Thereasonforthisstateofaffairs'accordingtoSrinivasan\nthe CBSE model of CCE in Jawaher Navodaya Schools,\nmay be attributed to the gaps in the understanding of\nCCE at the planning level in the three important organi-\nsations involved in the business, namely, NCERT, CBSE\nand NVS'. On the other hand, perhaps with greater\nthe `missing linkages and coherence between CCE\nconcept and operationalization to the lack of engage-\nment of suitable expertise for the academic activity,\nhaving theoretical and practical understanding, appro-\npriate to the context, and keeping current concerns in\nclear focus'. He raised issues regarding understanding\nof the philosophy of FA among the group formulating\nthe CBSE manual on CCE:\nThe composition of the group that has formulated the\nCBSE manual is largely drawn from the practitioner\ncommunity (teachers) whose practical experience and\ninterests are of course important to be taken into account.\nHowever, there is a lack of involvement of academics in\nthe group who understand the philosophical dimensions\nof the reform and the appropriate role of FA in the new\nIf indeed the CBSE's formulation of CCE resulted from\nmisunderstanding of the FA construct, then three ques-\ntions come to the fore. First, the question of its launch\nin this condition by the CBSE; second, of the unques-\ntioning adoption of this model, even at the elemen-\ntary stage by the central government and by most state\ngovernments; and third, of the appeal of this model\nover the NCERT model of CCE.\nLaunch by CBSE\nParallels come to mind from a historic, premature, and\nill-fated launch of NASA's Challenger, which exploded\nsoon after lift-off. Researchers who examined this\ndisaster through a behavioural ethics lens found that\nin common with many organizational and policy deci-\nsions, the construal of the issue had a determining effect\non the decision to launch. Ambiguity regarding the\ntechnical safety of the Challenger's `O-Rings' should\nbeen perceived from the perspective of safety first.\nHowever, framing it as a management decision ensured\nthe fading out of issues such as safety first, while issues\nof time and efficiency, and of pleasing the bosses at\nNASA came to the fore.\nIn the case of CBSE's CCE, Sreekanth (2017) points out\nthat the reform was launched without a pilot study\nbeing carried out to ascertain its feasibility and modifi-\ncation needs. He says, `in the case of CCE of the CBSE,\nfocus group discussions were held with stake holders\nand the scheme was then launched across all schools\nannounced its scheme to all the heads of the CBSE insti-\nrationale quoted the then Union Minister for Human\nResource Development:\nPush the process of examination reform in accordance\nwith NCF 2005. This will include making the Class X\nexamination optional, thus permitting students contin-\nuing in the same school (and who do not need a board\ncertificate) to take an internal school assessment instead.\nThisquoteisfromtheAgendaitemNo.7oftheMinister's\n(PIB, 2009). It was perhaps the rush to meet the dead-\nline of the Minister's 100 day agenda which prompted\nCBSE's urgency to launch its CCE without trial.\n2009 came into effect; the CBSE extended the imple-\nmentation of CCE for Classes VI\u00adVIII in the schools\nthat are affiliated to it. The CBSE published a series of\nmanuals on CCE. Later, many states introduced CCE\nfor Classes I\u00adVIII'. Thus, within less than a year, the\nCBSE had not only extended itself to its own schools\nbeyond the secondary stage (CBSE, 2010a) but the\nsame model was adopted by schools under the central\ngovernment and, as reiterated by Srinivasan, state\ngovernments too adopted this model for the elemen-\ntary stage of Classes I\u00adVIII. One explanation for this\nis obvious, when the RTE Act came into effect in 2010,\nCBSE's CCE model was readily available, whereas\nNCERT exemplars did not come out for a few more\nNeo-institutional explanations for the ready adoption\nof the CBSE's CCE lie in the view of institutions being\nembedded in and influenced by their environment (field)\nfrom whom they seek legitimacy. In situations of uncer-\ntainty rather than functional efficiency, which is often\ndifficult to ascertain, logics of confidence and good faith\nprevail (Meyer & Rowan, 1977), in this case, faith in the\nCBSE. Furthermore, isomorphism with dominant others\nin the field offers both supportive buffering and shared\nlegitimacy. Viewed from these standpoints, reassurance\nfeasibly met convenience in state governments' decision\nto adopt a tried and tested model of CCE already in use\nin private CBSE and central government schools.\n`Currently the board examinations negatively influ-\nence all testing and assessment throughout the school\nEven as most would agree with this statement in the\nNCF, it is equally true that examinations, marks, and\ngrades represent the familiar that one is comfort-\nable with. Marks and grades enable one to know how\na child is doing in school. Across schools, their rela-\ntive performances in board exams are perceived as\nindicators of their standing. Thus, even as one might\ndisparage such a culture of performativity in the\neducation system, the fear of negotiating the educa-\ntional minefield devoid of such performance markers\nsupports resistance to their obliteration.\nConceding the necessity to acknowledge social and\nparental subscription to the performativity culture,\nDhankar (2017) points out that the most important\nargument of those wanting to rescind CCE and rein-\nstate a compulsory board is that `the children will reach\nthe next level of school grossly under\u00adprepared .... This\nargument cannot be dismissed summarily'.\nThe choice and reinforcement of CBSE's model of CCE,\nwith its multiple-registered, marked, and summated\ntests in preference over the NCERT's model (devoid of\nsuch dramatic evidences) was thusly set in the logics\npoints out that `in most states, the conduct of periodic\nassessments using a fixed set of prescribed tools and\ntechniques and recording marks/grades or descrip-\ntive qualitative statements is considered the impor-\ntant part of CCE'.\nSuch performativity culture reasoning was evidenced\nin the Gujarat state government's choice of CCE model.\nIn this model, FA, although described by the manual as\nan integral part of teaching\u00adlearning activity, `inclu-\nded grading and marking and a weightage in the\nsemester and year-end final grade'. Astonishingly, it\nwas found that the state-level core group was aware that\nthis was conceptually not appropriate; nonetheless, they\nopined that this `needs to be done because formative\nassessment will not get done if it is not graded and no\nPerhaps this finding of a deliberate twist of meaning to\nFA in the above case to serve the purpose not of CCE,\nbut of teacher accountability, supports Sreekanth's app-\nrehension about the CBSE's FA, and whether `as an\naffiliating and monitoring agency for the schools affil-\niated to the Board, it has adopted its own priorities\nand mechanism to implement CCE which is not in\nPrevailing dispositions in favour of performativity\nin education make it easy to comprehend the attrac-\ntiveness to policymakers of assessments which serve\nmultiple, even contradictory purposes, exemplifying\nBall's statement (2000, p. 2) that `performativity is a\ntechnology, a culture and a mode of regulation, or a\nsystem of terror in the operation of which purposes are\ncontradictory, motivations blurred'. Apparently, the\nvery appeal of CBSE's CCE lay in its unproblematic\naccommodation, in contrast to the systemic transfor-\nmation required by NCERT's CCE, within the existing\nexamination-valuing status quo. Second, its adoption\nby CBSE-affiliated and central government schools lent\ncredence to its functional fitness as an appropriate tool\nfor the assessment for learning that it purported to be.\nBut above all, perhaps the deciding factor in its appeal\nto policymakers, as seen in the case of Gujarat, resided\nin its potential as a tool for teacher accountability.\nThus, as seen in this section the CCE in practice, in its\ndesign and implementation, was mutated by under-\nstandings of education by actors e.g. policymakers,\nteachers, parents, society--within the frame of reference\nof a performativity culture, reducing it to a competitive\ngame and a set of motions to be ticked off as done. The\nframe itself, through which the CCE was construed and\nunderstood, remained untouched.\nCONCLUSION\nWhat does the lesson of the CCE portend for education\nwithin the agenda of inclusive growth? Is it, as sugg-\nested by the experiment described at the beginning\nof this article, about the psychology of learning and\nthe presence/absence of the all-important feedback\n(learning) loop connecting performance achieve-\nments and objectives? Would a policy designed to fit\nthe feedback loop correctly into the teaching learning\nprocess change policy outcomes to ensure that every\nchild learns? As seen in this article, the intent of policy,\nits tools, and its processes of implementation are medi-\nated by understandings and meaning-making by actors\nin the system.\nIn the context of India, Wiener's (1991) research on the\nbelief systems of educational policymakers shows that\nIndia's per capita income and economic situation is less\nrelevant as an explanation than the belief systems of the\nstate bureaucracy. According to Weiner:\nAt the core of these beliefs is the Indian view of the social\norder, notions concerning the respective roles of upper\nand lower social strata, the role of education as a means\nof maintaining differentiations among social classes, and\nconcerns that `excessive' and `inappropriate' education\nfor the poor would disrupt existing social arrangements.\nIt was in line with such beliefs, widely shared by\neducators, social activists, trade unionists academic\nresearchers, and, more broadly by members of the\nIndian middle class, holds Weiner, \"that resources\nwere channelled into elite government and state aided\nprivate schools, in an effort to create an educated class\nthat is equal to educated classes in the West, and that\nis capable of creating and managing a modern enclave\nWeiner could well have been echoing Weber's (1946\nNot ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern\nmen's conduct. Yet very frequently the `world images'\nthat have been created by `ideas' have, like switchmen,\ndetermined the tracks along which action has been pushed\nby the dynamic of interest.\nWhat the psychology of learning experiment failed to\nconsider or convey to me at that time, I realize now, is that\nthe feedback to the learner is mediated through the will\nof the interventionist and his/her motivations to enable\nthe learner to learn. Policy is implemented by adminis-\ntrators, teachers, and others in the system, and its lines\nof action are determined by the `dynamic of interest'.\nEducation policy necessarily involves teachers but often\nfails to `involve' them. Gavin Brown reminds us,\nIt cannot be assumed teachers will enact policy as\nintended. Indeed there is strong evidence that how\nteachers conceive of a phenomenon, acts to filter (i.e.\ncontrol what they will pay attention to), frame (i.e.\ncontrol how they will understand what they pay atten-\ntion to), and guide (i.e. influence their behaviour) their\nPolicy intentions require shared values and commit-\nment to purpose--including, as pointed out by Jhingran\n(2013, p. 31), `teachers' beliefs about children's learning,\nteaching, assessment, the hierarchical teacher\u00adstudent\nas does the fate of the RTE mandated CCE, `isolated\nreforms in techniques of measurement will not have\nmuch meaning unless accompanied by concomi-\ntant changes in the classroom culture'. The culture of\nperformativity which pervades our system of education\nand our conceptions of what education is, what it is for,\nand even the organization of the process of teaching\u00ad\nlearning itself needs overhauling, if it truly wants to\nembrace every child within the larger agenda of inclu-\nsive growth.
