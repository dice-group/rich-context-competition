It causes nearly 8,000 deaths per\nyear,1 is the leading cause for liver transplanta-\ntion,2 and has contributed to a rise in the incidence of\nhepatocellular carcinoma.3 Quality of life is impaired for\npatients infected with the virus, even among those with-\nmillion people in the U.S. with chronic hepatitis C. Al-\nthough the incidence of new infections has declined, the\nnumber of deaths may continue to increase 2- to 4-fold\nover the next 20 years due to prevalent cases with long-\nstanding infection.5,6\nThe future public health burden of hepatitis C could\npotentially be mitigated by antiviral therapy.5 In the last\ntwo decades there have been dramatic improvements in\ntreatment for hepatitis C. The benefit of adding ribavirin\nto interferon was demonstrated in a series of studies in the\nlate 1990s,7 and then pegylated interferon was approved\nat the end of 2001. Combination therapy with pegylated\ninterferon and ribavirin can now achieve sustained viro-\nlogical response (SVR) in 50% of patients,8 compared to\nrates of 17% with standard interferon alone.7 Patients\nwho achieve SVR enjoy long-term remission of disease,\nwith liver-related mortality rates comparable to the gen-\nDespite these improvements, there are reasons to be-\nlieve that the uptake of antiviral therapy may be limited.\nPatients with hepatitis C are more likely to lack health\ninsurance and a usual source of care.12,13 Studies have\ndemonstrated that primary care physicians lack knowl-\nedge about risk factors and testing for hepatitis C.14,15\nAccess to a specialist willing to prescribe antiviral therapy\nmay be another limiting factor.16 Finally, many patients\nAbbreviations: NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey;\nSVR, sustained virological response.\nFrom the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Michigan,\nAnn Arbor, MI.\nFunded in part by grants from the Greenview Foundation and the American\nGastroenterological Association (to M.L.V.).\nAddress reprint requests to: Michael L.

Several\nstudies from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and\nHealth Maintenance Organizations have reported low\ntreatment rates among patients identified to have hepati-\ntis C.18,19 However, no national data exist on the number\nof patients currently receiving antiviral therapy in the\nU.S., or the impact of current practice patterns on the\nburden of hepatitis C. The aims of this study were to\ndetermine the public health impact of current antiviral\ntherapy and to identify barriers to treatment of hepatitis\nC.\nMaterials and Methods\nNumber of Patients Treated for Hepatitis C\nTo determine the number of patients receiving antivi-\nral therapy in the U.S., data were obtained from Wolters\nKluwer on the number of new patient prescriptions for\npegylated interferon products (peg-interferon -2a and\nKluwer maintains a longitudinal nationwide sample of\npatients filling prescriptions at retail, mail-order, and spe-\ncialty pharmacies.20 This sample captures 31% of paid\nprescriptions nationwide. Every patient is given an en-\ncrypted unique identifier in order to differentiate between\nnew prescriptions and refills. Prescription data from this\nsample are then linked to a second database that measures\ntotal monthly prescription volume in the U.S. from a\nrandom sample of pharmacies with computer manage-\nment systems. This database represents 80% of U.S. retail\nprescriptions. In this fashion, the number of prescriptions\nfrom the longitudinal patient sample is projected to de-\ntermine the total number of prescriptions per year for a\ngiven product. Demographics of subjects in the Wolters\nKluwer longitudinal sample (Source Lx) compare simi-\nlarly to those from the U.S. census, as shown in Appendix\nA.\nImpact of Antiviral Therapy on Burden of Disease\nMarkov Model Structure. In order to estimate the\nimpact of current practice patterns on the future burden\nof hepatitis C, we created a dynamic population Markov\nmodel of patients with chronic hepatitis C in the U.S.\nchange in size due to new infections, or due to patients\nbeing removed from the cohort because of death from\nliver disease or other causes, as shown in Fig. 1. The pri-\nmary endpoint of the model was the number of liver-\nrelated deaths projected to be prevented by antiviral\ntherapy during this period.\nInput Data and Model Assumptions. All variables\nincluded in the model are shown in Table 1. Baseline\nprevalence was obtained from the National Health and\nNutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES),21 and annual\nincidence of new infections was obtained from the Cen-\nters for Disease Control.22 The proportion of acute cases\nprogressing to chronic hepatitis C was estimated from the\nproportion of cases in NHANES with positive antibody\nbut negative RNA.21 The number of patients receiving\nfrom national pharmacy data (Wolters Kluwer database,\nas described above). The number of patients receiving\nantiviral therapy each year after 2007 was projected by\nfitting a three-parameter inverse linear equation to the\nto the least-squares criterion.23 Liver-related mortality\nrate without treatment was based on current mortality\nattributable to hepatitis C,1 and was assumed to increase\nby 10% of the baseline rate each year5,6 to account for the\nincreasing average duration of infection. Nonliver mor-\ntality rate was based on life tables from the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics,24 and was assumed to increase by\n10% of the baseline rate each year to account for aging of\nthe hepatitis C population. The SVR rate was set at 50%\nin the base-case analysis,8 with a 10-fold reduction in\nliver-related mortality risk among those achieving\nSVR.9-11 Calculations were performed using Excel (Mi-\ncrosoft, Redmond, WA). The model cycle length was 1\nyear, and no discounting was performed.\nSensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis was per-\nformed on all variables. This was done both to determine\nsusceptibility of the base-case estimate to uncertainty sur-\nFig. 1.

For example, future advances in\nantiviral therapy may improve rates of SVR, or public\neducation campaigns could increase the number of cases\ndetected. Finally, because current guidelines recommend\nselecting patients for treatment in part based on their risk\nof future complications,25 in sensitivity analysis the\ntreated patients were assumed to have a 100% higher risk\nof liver-related death than those untreated.\nReasons for Lack of Treatment\nTreatment decisions were investigated using data from\nthe NHANES Hepatitis C Follow-Up Questionnaire.\nEvery 2 years, NHANES selects a random sample of the\nU.S. population to participate in a health examination\nversion, participants testing positive for hepatitis C were\nsent a letter informing them of their test results. Four\nmonths later, they received a follow-up telephone ques-\ntionnaire. In all, 277 subjects were contacted during the\nthree iterations of this survey, the response rate was 136\n(49%), and there were three partial completions, yielding\na sample size of 133 completed questionnaires.\nThe NHANES questionnaire, which can be seen at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/\npf_hcq_03_08.pdf, contains a series of questions about\ntesting, follow-up, doctor's recommendations, and sub-\nject decision-making about treatment for hepatitis C. Re-\nsponses to these questions were used to place subjects into\nthe following categories with regard to treatment: (1) un-\naware of the diagnosis, (2) aware of the diagnosis, but did\nnot seek further medical attention, (3) doctor did not\nrecommend treatment, (4) subject refused treatment, and\n(5) treated. This classification was performed indepen-\ndently by two authors (M.V., R.T.), and agreement was\n100%. Subjects who were previously unaware of their\ndiagnosis and sought medical attention during the 4\nmonths between notification of their diagnosis and re-\nceipt of the questionnaire were classified as \"unaware.\"\nSample weights were used to adjust for oversampling of\nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, and subjects age 65 in\nthe NHANES study.26 Chi-square analysis was then used\nto determine bivariate associations between these catego-\nries and variables such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\ninsurance status. Calculations were performed using Stata\n10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nResults\nNumber of Patients Treated for Hepatitis C.

Only by increasing treatment rates by 75%\nand increasing SVR rates to 75% could more than half of\nthe liver-related deaths be prevented.\nReasons for Lack of Treatment. Results from the\nNHANES questionnaire indicate that the primary reason\nfor lack of treatment is lack of diagnosis, as shown in Fig.\n60%) were previously unaware of their diagnosis, 12 (ad-\nup with a doctor about their hepatitis C, 33 (adjusted\nby their doctor not to be treated, 8 (adjusted proportion\nThis suggests that the largest barrier to treatment is failure\nto diagnose infection with hepatitis C.

Projected population size of people with\nchronic hepatitis C in the U.S., with and without anti-\nviral therapy.\njected the impact current therapy will have on preventing\nliver-related deaths over the next two decades. We found\nthat relatively few patients have been treated with pegy-\nlated interferon, and treatment rates appear to be declin-\ning. These findings are similar to a recent report from\nEurope, in which treatment rates varied by country from\n1% to 16% of hepatitis C patients ever treated.27 If this\ntrend continues, antiviral therapy may prevent fewer than\n15% of liver-related deaths caused by hepatitis C in the\nFortunately, new treatments for hepatitis C are antici-\npated to become available in the next several years, which\nshould increase rates of SVR among patients receiving\ntreatment.28 However, treatment first requires a diagno-\nsis, and in this study we found that approximately half of\nall people with hepatitis C in the U.S. are unaware of their\ndiagnosis. There are several possible reasons for this situ-\nation. First, lack of health insurance poses an obvious\nC were uninsured,12 and this number has likely increased\nsince that time. Second, because hepatitis C is usually\nasymptomatic, patients without any other medical prob-\nlems may not seek medical attention. In the NHANES\nsurvey, we found that respondents lacking a usual source\nof medical care were 19 times more likely to be unaware of\ntheir diagnosis. This is unfortunate, because those pa-\ntients without comorbidities may be the best candidates\nfor antiviral therapy. Finally, identification of risk factors\nand testing for hepatitis C may be a low priority during a\nbusy primary care appointment. It has been estimated\nthat provision of all recommended preventative care\nwould consume 7.4 hours of each primary doctor's day,\nleaving no time for other tasks.29 Because the U.S. Pre-\nventative Services Task Force has concluded that insuffi-\ncient evidence exists to recommend screening for hepatitis\nC, physicians may consider this a low priority.30 Further-\nmore, physicians may not realize the value of diagnosing\nhepatitis C, because prior studies have identified limited\nknowledge about the disease among primary care physi-\ncians.14 Thus, increasing the number of patients diag-\nnosed will require education of the public and physicians\nalike, as well as attention to the worsening problem of the\nuninsured in the U.S.\nEven if all patients with hepatitis C were aware of their\ndiagnosis, a number of barriers to treatment would still\nremain. First, many patients will be ineligible for cur-\nrently available antiviral therapy due to decompensated\ncirrhosis, comorbidities, or other reasons. Second, some\npatients may not follow up for further care, and others\nmay not be referred to a specialist who prescribes antiviral\ntherapy. In our study we could not differentiate between\nlack of referral by the primary physician versus lack of\ntreatment by the specialist, but prior studies have sug-\ngested that lack of referral is a major barrier. In one survey\nof primary care physicians, 72% would not refer a patient\nwith normal liver enzymes for treatment,14 despite evi-\ndence that such patients can develop progressive disease.31\nAdditionally, patients in some areas may have limited\naccess to specialists who treat hepatitis C, because 20% of\nall gastroenterologists prescribe 80% of antiviral therapy\nin this country.16 As mentioned above, it is possible that\nfuture improvements in antiviral therapy will increase en-\nthusiasm for treatment among the medical community,\nand thus increase the number of patients treated. How-\never, very little is known about health services delivery and\nquality of care for hepatitis C, and further research in this\narea is needed.\nAlthough this study is the first to examine the public\nhealth impact of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C, it does\nhave several important limitations. First, the Wolters Klu-\nwer sample includes only commercial pharmacies, and\ndoes not include Veteran's Affairs pharmacies or patients\ntreated in clinical trials. Therefore, it is possible that the\ntrue number of patients treated for hepatitis C each year\nin the U.S. is being underestimated. Conversely,\nNHANES estimates were used for the prevalence of hep-\nFig. 4. Reasons for lack of treatment among respondents to the\nNHANES Hepatitis C Follow-Up Questionnaire (n  133).\nTable 3.

Thus, because potential errors in the numerator and\ndenominator lie in the same direction, estimates of the\nproportion treated may be reasonably correct. A second\nimportant limitation is that the NHANES questionnaire\ndoes not provide sufficient detail to thoroughly examine\npatient and physician decision-making about testing and\ntreatment for hepatitis C. Finally, any attempt to predict\nthe future is likely to be imprecise. Therefore, projections\nregarding future treatment rates and liver-related deaths\nare only intended to provide a rough overview of the\npublic health impact of antiviral therapy. The strength of\nthis study is that it provides the first look at nationwide\npractice patterns for treatment of hepatitis C.\nIn conclusion, despite tremendous advances in antivi-\nral therapy, current antiviral therapy is projected to pre-\nvent fewer than 15% of liver-related deaths caused by\nings of this study is that the future development of new\nand better medications will have a less than optimal im-\npact on this problem unless more patients are diagnosed\nand referred for treatment. Increased public health efforts\nare needed to improve access to antiviral therapy for pa-\ntients with hepatitis C.\n"
