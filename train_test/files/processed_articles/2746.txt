Competitive products typically include\nitems sold in vending machines, school stores and snack bars, or a\n`\nla carte in the cafeteria, through in-school fundraisers, and offered\nto students during classroom parties and as rewards in the\nclassroom [6].\nCompetitive foods and beverages are widely available in schools\n65% of U.S. public elementary-school students could purchase\nfoods or beverages from competitive venues (vending machines,\nschool stores/snack bars, and or a\n` la carte lines) [9]. The third\nSchool Nutrition and Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA-III),\npublic elementary schools offered at least one source of\ncompetitive foods and beverages, including the traditional sales\nvenues (vending machines, school stores/snack bars, and a\n` la carte\nlines) as well as fundraisers, parties, and given as rewards in the\nclassroom; furthermore, 29% of elementary school students\nconsumed competitive items during the average school day [10].\nAlthough many studies have examined the availability of\ncompetitive foods and beverages in tradition sales venues [10\u00ad\n18], less work has examined the prevalence and characteristics of\nschool fundraising activities, or the extent to which school\nfundraising practices are associated with policy restrictions on\nitems sold through fundraisers.\nNationwide data suggest that school fundraisers are common in\nthe U.S., and, therefore, are an important component of any\nstrategy to change the competitive food environment in schools.\nSNDA-III results from 2004\u00ad05 indicated that classroom parties,\nbake sales and other fundraisers were a common source of\ncompetitive foods for elementary school students [10], with 37% of\npublic elementary schools holding some sort of fundraiser [7].\nHigher estimates were obtained by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention's nationally-representative School Health\nPolicies and Programs Study 2006, which found that at 76% of\nelementary schools, an organization such as the parent-teacher-\nassociation sold foods or beverages at school or in the community\nto raise money [12]. Specifically in elementary schools, the items\nsold were chocolate candies (50% of schools), baked goods (50% of\nschools) and sugar-sweetened beverages (21% of schools) [12].\nResearch is accumulating to demonstrate that policies regarding\ncompetitive food and beverages--including those sold as well as\nthose offered in the classroom and in other ways on campus--are\nsignificantly associated with children's diets and weight status, and\na recent comprehensive research review documents the impor-\ntance of such policies in schools [19]. Although, the evidence\nspecifically relating to fundraisers is fairly limited thus far, research\nsuggests that school fundraisers may be associated with student\nweight outcomes. Kubik and colleagues [20] found that in\nMinnesota middle schools, school practices--including fundrais-\ning--were associated with student body mass index (BMI). Higher\nscores on a school food practices scale that included classroom and\nschool-wide fundraising activities (as well as allowing foods and\nbeverages in the classroom, snacks and beverages in hallways, and\nfood-based rewards) were associated with higher student BMI\nscores [20]. However, the specific association between fundraising\nactivities and student BMI was not examined.\nWith regard to strategies for improving school fundraising\npractices, some work in secondary schools has established a link\nbetween fundraising policies and school practices. In a study of 45\nmiddle schools and 71 high schools in the Midwest during 2006,\n37% of schools used chocolate, candy, and high-fat baked goods\nfor school-wide fundraising activities, and 50% of schools had\npolicies addressing the nutritional quality of foods and beverages\nused in fundraising [21]. Healthful fundraising policies were\nassociated with school practices, and there was a greater\nconcordance between school fundraising policies and practices in\nmiddle schools than in high schools [21]. However, while it is clear\nthat fundraising activities are a source of high-calorie foods and\nbeverages in elementary schools [10], thus far little attention has\nbeen paid to the relationship between policy efforts to change\nschool food-related fundraising and implementation at the\nelementary-school level. State-specific research has shown that\npolicy strategies can impact school practices. For example, the\ncomprehensive state laws to combat childhood obesity--created\na statewide health advisory committee to develop specific\nrecommendations for nutrition in schools, and also required\nschool districts to establish committees to develop locally-relevant\npolicies for schools. Subsequently, the prevalence of school policies\nprohibiting the use of food in fundraising by student groups\nincreased significantly, from 54% to 70% of elementary schools\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been directed to the\npotential for state laws and school district policies to play a role in\npromoting healthy school environments. In the U.S., the Child\nNutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 [23] mandated that\nschool districts participating in federal child nutrition programs\n(i.e., school breakfast and lunch programs, in which most public\nschool districts participate) must adopt and implement a wellness\npolicy by the first day of the 2006\u00ad07 school year; these policies\nwere to include nutrition guidelines for all foods, including\ncompetitive foods and beverages. Each local school district was\nresponsible for establishing the guidelines, allowing for much\nvariability in policy focus, strength and implementation. Since the\nwellness policy mandate went into effect, policies to address\ncompetitive foods and beverages have increased in prevalence, but\nschool students nationwide were enrolled in a district that\nrestricted fundraisers during the school day [17]. Further\nrefinements in district policies are expected, following the Healthy,\nHunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 [24], which continues to require district\nwellness policies. This legislation also directed the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) to develop nationwide\nregulations for competitive foods and beverages (although the\nfederal rule will not preempt stronger state and/or local laws/\npolicies). Currently, the only USDA regulation regarding compet-\nitive foods is a prohibit on the sale of foods of minimal nutritional\nvalue (FMNVs)--a category that includes carbonated soft drinks\nand sodas, as well as certain candies-- in the cafeteria during\nmeals, but these items may be sold elsewhere at school even during\nlunch [6].\nIn the meantime, however, there is scant data on whether--or\nhow--state law and/or district policy efforts nationwide are\nassociated with school-level policies and practices. The current\nstudy uses cross-sectional data from a nationally-representative\nsample of U.S. public elementary schools during the 2009\u00ad10 and\n2010\u00ad11 school years, along with corresponding district policies\nand state laws, to examine the associations between state laws,\ndistrict policies, and school-level fundraising restrictions.\nMethods\nData on school practices were gathered via mail-back survey.\nData on corresponding district policies and state laws were\ngathered via commercially available public-use sources as\ndescribed below. This study was reviewed and approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nA waiver of documentation of informed consent was granted, as\nconsent was implied by return of the survey.\nSchool-Level Data\nSampling and Weighting. For each year, a different sample\nof schools was used, and each of the samples were developed at the\nInstitute for Survey Research at the University of Michigan and\nwere designed to be nationally-representative of U.S. public\nelementary schools (containing a 3rd grade) from the contiguous\nstates (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). School weights were\ndeveloped and adjusted for non-response bias.\nProcedure. Surveys were mailed to school principals in\nJanuary of each school year, with subsequent follow-up by mail,\ne-mail and telephone until recruitment ended in June of each year.\nThe instructions requested that the survey be completed by the\nprincipal or other staff with knowledge of school practices\npertaining to student health. A $100 incentive was offered to the\nrespondent or school for returning the survey. The response rate--\ncalculated using the American Association for Public Opinion\ndouble-entered for quality assurance.\nMeasures. Information on school fundraising restrictions was\ngathered with three survey items. The first item asked respondents\nto indicate ``Does your school have any school-wide policies\nregarding the nutritional quality of items sold for PTA fundraisers\nHealthier School Fundraising\nor other fundraisers?'' with responses of ``Yes'' (coded = 1), ``No''\n(coded = 0) or ``N/A, no fundraising.'' Two additional items asked\nwhich of the following types of restrictions were present: 1) No\nfoods of minimal nutritional value (FMNVs; carbonated soft drinks\nand certain candies) and 2) No soda/soft drinks. These items were\ncoded 1 = ``Yes'' versus 0 = ``No'' or ``No restrictions.'' For the\ncurrent analyses, the 5.1% of schools (n = 65) that did not allow\nany fundraising were re-coded as 1 = yes for each of the\nfundraising items (i.e., complete ban).\nContextual Factors. School-level demographic and socio-\neconomic data were obtained from public use data files from the\nNational Center for Education Statistics (Common Core of Data\n2009\u00ad10). These variables were used as covariates in regression\nanalyses. Data were obtained on all available school characteris-\ntics, coded as follows: school size (total number of students in the\nschool), coded in tertiles as small (,451 students), medium (451\u00ad\n621 students), and large (.621 students; referent); the percentage\nof students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (as a proxy for\nsocioeconomic status; SES), coded in thirds as lower SES (.66%),\nreferent); U.S. census region, coded as West, Northeast, Midwest\nand South (referent); and locale, coded as rural, town, suburban,\nand urban (referent). For racial/ethnic composition each school\nwas coded as one of four exhaustive and mutually-exclusive\ncategories: majority ($66%) White students (referent); majority\n($50%) Latino students; majority ($50%) Black students; and\ndiverse (no majority).\nDistrict-Level Policy Data Collection\nFormal policy documents (i.e., wellness policies, associated\nrules/regulations, and other policies embedded by reference into\nthe wellness policy/rules) were collected from the corresponding\nschool district for each elementary school in the sample. Policies\nwere gathered by trained research assistants using an established\nprotocol via internet searches, with telephone calls and/or\nmailings to find policies that were unavailable online and to verify\ncomplete policy collection for policies that were available online.\nAll district policies were reviewed and double-coded and analyzed\nby two trained researchers using an adaptation of a coding scheme\ndeveloped by Schwartz and colleagues [26] and presented by\nChriqui and colleagues [27,28]. After double-coding was com-\nplete, a consensus review was conducted to discuss any discrep-\nancies (,5% for these topics).\nPolicy provisions pertaining to fundraisers were coded as: 0 = no\npolicy, if there were no fundraising food/beverage standards;\n1 = weak policy, if restrictions on items sold for fundraising were\nvague, suggested but not required, only applied to a limited set of\nproducts (e.g., FMNVs), or applied for less than the whole school\nday; 2 = strong policy, if specific fundraising nutrition standards\nwere required; and 3 = complete ban, if all competitive foods were\nbanned. In addition, policy codes for two specific nutrition\nstandards were used in the current analyses, candy and regular\nsoda, each coded for whether the policy applied specifically to\nitems sold as fundraisers. The candy item was coded as: 0 = no\npolicy; 1 = weak policy, if the item was restricted but not\nprohibited; 2 = strong policy that prohibited candy in fundraisers;\nand 3) complete ban on competitive foods or fundraisers. The soda\nitem was coded using a five-level variable: 0 = no policy; 1 = weak\npolicy, if the item was restricted but not prohibited; 2 = regular\nsoda prohibited but not all sugar-sweetened beverages; 3 = all\nsugar-sweetened beverages prohibited; and 4 = competitive bev-\nerage or fundraising ban. District policy variables were collapsed\nsuch that 1 = any strong/required policy (original codes of 2, 3, or\n4, as appropriate) versus 0 = no policy or a weak policy (original\nState Law Data Collection\nState laws, effective as of the beginning of September of each\nschool year were compiled through natural language and Boolean\nkeyword searches of the full-text, tables of contents, and indices of\ncodified state statutory and administrative (regulatory) laws\ncommercially available from subscription-based legal research\nproviders, Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis. Codified state statutory laws\ninclude legislation enacted by the state legislatures while codified\nadministrative laws include all rules/regulations promulgated by\nstate Boards of Education. For purposes of this study, all those\nlegislative laws and rules/regulations that were formally codified\nwere included for this analysis. Any ``informal'' policies adopted by\nstate Boards of Education, for example, that were not codified into\nrule/regulation were excluded from this study. The vast majority\nof all such rules/regulations are codified into law and are included\nherein. The codified state laws (including regulations) were\nvalidated against publicly available secondary sources including\nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, the National\nAssociation of State Boards of Education, and the National\nCancer Institute's Classification of Laws about School Students\n[29\u00ad31]. State laws were coded using the same methods and\ncoding rubric as described above for district policies.\nData Analysis\nThe initial sample included 1278 schools. At 31 schools, the\nsurvey item on school-level fundraising restrictions was skipped,\nand at 28 schools, district policy data were not available (schools\nwithin 26 unique districts). At four schools, data were unavailable\non free and reduced lunch eligibility (a covariate), thus the final\nsample size for analyses reported here was reduced to 1215\nschools. The samples were selected as separate cross-sectional\nsamples for each year, but a small amount of overlap occurred\nbetween the two years; nine schools responded in both years, along\n2010\u00ad11). Analyses were conducted with the data treated as a\nstacked cross-sectional dataset, controlling for year.\nAnalyses were conducted using complex survey commands in\nSTATA/SE 12.0 [32] and accounted for the clustering of schools\nwithin districts and states. Data were weighted to provide\ninference to all public elementary schools in the U.S. First, the\nsample characteristics were tabulated (Table 1). Then the\nprevalence of school policy status was tabulated; based on cross-\ntabulation of the collapsed (binary) district policy variables and the\nbinary state law variables, each school was classified into one of\nfour mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories for each\nfundraising policy category of interest (i.e., overall fundraising\nrestrictions, no sodas in fundraisers, no candy in fundraisers): 1) no\ndistrict policy and no state law; 2) district policy only; 3) state law\nonly; and 4) both state law and district policy (Table 2). Then, the\nrelationships between state law and school policies and between\ndistrict and school policies were examined with a series of\nmultivariate logistic regressions that included a set of three\nvariables to account for district policy and state law (Table 3). For\nregression analyses, a set of three dummy codes compared each of\nthe three latter categories against `no policy' (referent). Outcomes\nwere coded so that 1 = the presence of a school-level nutritional\nrestriction on fundraisers and 0 = no restriction. Each school\nvariable was matched to the relevant policy dimension (i.e.,\npolicies pertaining to candy and soda were used to predict school-\nlevel restrictions on FMNVs). Table 3 also presents predicted\nmargins, which equal the adjusted prevalence of schools that\nHealthier School Fundraising\nplaced restrictions on fundraisers within each policy category (i.e.,\nno policy, district-only, state-only, and both district and state),\ncontrolling for covariates. Standard errors were adjusted to\naccount for the sampling variability of the covariates in the model.\nFinally, to examine the characteristics of schools where the\nschool-level policy was or was not consistent with district policies\nand state laws, Table 4 presents the percentage of schools with or\nwithout a school-level policy regarding the nutritional quality of\nitems sold in fundraising, among the schools where district policy\nand state law both required such restrictions. It also presents the\npercentage of schools with or without a school-level policy among\nschools in states where both the district policy and state law did not\nrequire such restrictions. These breakdowns compare the\npercentage of schools with a policy within demographic subgroups.\nResults\nAs reported by survey respondents at 1215 U.S. public\nschools had some sort of school-wide restriction regarding the\nnutritional quality of items sold for fundraisers (see Table 1).\n11; as tested in a multivariate logistic regression including\ncovariates, this did not differ significantly across the two years.\nAcross the two years, responding schools were located in 834\nunique districts, with schools located in 407 unique districts in\ndistricts were represented for both years. Across those 834 districts,\n252 (30.2%) had a strong fundraising policy. Responding schools\nwere located in 47 states (all states except Alaska, Hawaii,\nWyoming, and the District of Columbia), with most states (n = 44)\nrepresented for both years, two states (North Dakota and Rhode\nIsland) represented for 2009\u00ad10 only, and one state (Vermont)\none or both years, 10 (21.3%) had a strong law. When examined in\ncombination (Table 2), most schools were located in districts and\nstates with no policy at either level; however, approximately one-\nfourth of schools were subject to policies at both levels.\nAcross the multivariate logistic regression models--predicting\nall three types of fundraising restrictions at schools--schools with a\ncombination of a state law and a district policy were more than\ntwo times as likely to have nutritional limitations on fundraisers\nthan were schools where there was no corresponding law or policy\n(Table 3). Additionally, elementary schools located in districts with\noverall fundraising restrictions and prohibitions on soda sold\nthrough fundraisers were also more likely to restrict fundraisers\nand prohibit soda, respectively.\nFurther analysis indicated that school-level policies were not\nnecessarily consistent with state laws and district policies (Table 4).\nWhere state law and district policy required fundraising limita-\nyears.\nCharacteristic % Schools\nFundraising Outcomes\nAny fundraising restrictions 39.2\nSchool Demographics\nRegion\nLocale\nRace/ethnicity of students\nStudent eligibility for free or reduced- price lunch\nSchool size\nPercentages sum to 100 within category, but due to rounding may not sum to\nData are weighted to the school level, n = 1215 schools.\nTable 2.

This varied significantly by region and student race/\nethnicity, with school-level policies being concordant with a strong\ndistrict policy and state law among 77.1% of schools in the West\nversus 39.1% of schools in the South, and for 71.4% of majority-\nLatino schools compared with 44.3% of majority-White schools\nand 47.0% of majority-Black schools (Ps,.01). Information given\nin response to an open-ended follow-up question regarding the\ntypes of school-level fundraising policies in place indicated that\nmany schools follow relevant state laws and/or district policies;\nhowever, in some cases, respondents indicated that although their\nschool was subject to a district wellness policy, those fundraising\nrestrictions were not always followed by the school. As also shown\nin Table 4, school-level policies were reported by 29.7% of schools\nlocated in states with no law and districts with no policies,\nsuggesting that some schools are developing policies independent-\nly; this did not vary by school demographic characteristic.\nDiscussion\nOur results show that elementary school-level fundraising\nrestrictions are related to state law and district policy, but relevant\npolicies and laws at the state and district level are not consistently\nimplemented in schools. Across the board, the combination of\npolicy at both the state and district level was significantly\nassociated with a doubled likelihood of having a school policy,\nsuggesting that district policies are helping to reinforce the state\nlaws in this area, and that policy at both jurisdictions increases the\nlikelihood of school-level restrictions. For overall fundraising\nrestrictions, having a policy at only the district level was also\nassociated with school-level policies; however, laws at the state\nlevel only (in the absence of district policies) were not associated\nwith school-level policies. It is possible that districts are more\neffective at conveying information to the school-level than are\nstates, or that enforcement provisions are stronger at the district\nlevel. These possibilities warrant further examination as to why\nschool-level policies are more consistent with relevant district\npolicies, but state laws are not.\nElementary schools located within districts and states where\nboth had a strong policy/law were more than twice as likely to\nimpose nutritional restrictions on fundraisers, to prohibit FMNVs\nin fundraising, and to prohibit soda in fundraising activities. In\naddition, specific provisions within the policies/laws were also\nassociated with school-level restrictions, both for FMNVs and for\nsoda. Policies banning candy and soda were positively associated\nwith the presence of a school-level limit on FMNVs, and policy\nrestrictions on soda were associated with school-level bans on the\nuse of soda and/or soft drinks in fundraising activities. Neverthe-\nless, further analysis indicated that elementary school-level policies\nwere not necessarily consistent with district/state policies. Where\ndistrict policy and state law required fundraising limitations, only\n55.8% of schools reported having a school-level policy. The\npercentage of schools with a school-level policy was higher among\nschools in the West versus the South, and among those with a\nmajority of Latino students versus a majority of White or Black\nstudents. The reasons for these variations are unclear but warrant\nfurther examination, as it will be important to better understand\nthe barriers to school-level implementation of district policies and\nTable 3.

Some possibilities include concerns about lost revenue\nassociated with implementing fundraising restrictions, regional\nvariations in enforcement of policies, or that certain states and\ndistricts are more effective at conveying policy information to the\nEncouragingly, districts are continuing to develop and strength-\nen their wellness policies [28,34] and research is accumulating to\nshow that district policies and state laws are associated with school\npractices. For example, district policies are associated with reduced\navailability of junk foods and sugar-sweetened beverages in schools\n[35,36]. Studies in individual states have shown significant\nimprovements in the school food environment following develop-\nment of laws and policies pertaining to foods in schools [22,37,38].\nAnd, policies pertaining to competitive foods and beverages are\nassociated with healthier dietary behaviors and weight outcomes\namong students [19].\nNevertheless, much more research is needed on the barriers to\nimplementation of state laws and district policies pertaining to\nfundraising. With many school districts facing severe and ongoing\neconomic challenges, schools and parent-teacher organizations are\ngenuinely in need of strategies to raise funds for equipment and\nstudent activities, but for public health reasons it is important to\nraise money in ways that do not compromise students' health.\nFortunately, however, there are other options for schools to raise\nfunds that are both healthy and profitable. According to a report\nfrom the Center for Science in the Public Interest, walk-a-thons,\nbook fairs, recycling fundraisers, auctions and car washes are all\nprofitable fundraising options [39].\nThe health consequences of consuming sugary, high-calorie\nproducts are well documented. Given the national epidemic of\nchildhood obesity and the importance of providing healthy school\nenvironments for young children, schools should consider using\nnon-food-related fundraisers [39] or to ensure that any food-\nrelated fundraisers adhere to nutrition standards applied to items\nsold in other competitive food venues such as a\n\u00b4 la carte lines and\nvending machines [1]. As the USDA develops regulations and\ntechnical assistance materials related to wellness policies, as well as\ncompetitive food and beverage standards as required by the\nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 [24], an opportunity exists to\ninclude provisions related to the nutritional content of food/\nbeverage items sold through in-school fundraisers. In addition,\nmore research is needed on the student-level impact of fundraising\npractices (i.e., actual student-level consumption habits and weight\noutcomes).\nLimitations\nRelative to other data sources, these estimates are based on\nlarge numbers of schools over two school years, and the nationally-\nrepresentative sample allows for inference to school practices\nacross the country. However, there are also several potential\nTable 4.

As with any survey that relies upon\nreported rather than observed data, it is possible that the estimates\nwere affected by various reporting biases (e.g., desirability bias,\nresponse bias); however, the weights were adjusted to account for\nschools' propensity for non-response. The district fundraiser\npolicies and state laws were assessed based on their inclusion in\nthe sampled districts' congressionally-mandated wellness and\nrelated policies and codified state laws, respectively. In other\nwords, we evaluated formal policies ``on the books'' rather than\nany informal guidelines, parent/student handbooks, or policies ``in\npractice'' that may also exist at the district and/or state levels.\nThus, the estimates of district policy prevalence are conservative\nbut given the relationships observed here, we expect that any\nadditional ``informal'' policies would only further solidify the\nrelationship between these policies and school-level restrictions.\nOne of the dimensions for the district and state coding scheme\naddressed fundraising restrictions on ``candy,'' which we mapped\nto school-level FMNV restrictions; this is not a perfect match\nbecause although FMNVs include some types of candy, they do\nnot include chocolates, which are commonly used in fundraisers.\nThus, the policy dimension was broader than the school-level\noutcome, but nevertheless both were associated.\nThe school survey inquired about ``school-wide policies,'' but\nthis does not guarantee that such policies would always have been\nenforced. In other words, respondents may have indicated that the\nschool had a policy, but fundraising activities conducted by the\nparent-teacher organization or other groups might not have\nactually followed that requirement. Some respondents may have\ninterpreted the item as regarding only policies that were developed\nat the school level, thus answering ``no'' where the school followed\ndistrict policy but did not have a separate formal school policy, per\nse; however, some schools answered this item affirmatively then\nwrote in that they ``follow district policy,'' and our pre-testing of\nthe survey with school principals did not reveal comprehension\ndifficulty for this item. The goal of the school item was not to\nidentify the source of the policy, but rather to assess whether the\nschool had a policy or not. Nevertheless, some under-reporting of\nschool-level policies (in districts that actually did have relevant\npolicies) may have occurred; unfortunately we could not discern\nwhether some of the schools in states/districts with policies that\nreported not having a school policy either had mis-reported their\npolicy status or whether they truly did not know of or did not have\na school policy. We also did not inquire about frequency or type of\nfundraising activity; in other words, our study addressed school\npolicies, but not actual practices. There is much variability in\npractices, for example, in the frequency and type of fundraising\nactivities; there is certainly an important difference between a\nschool having a monthly bake sale in which high-calorie sugary\nitems are offered directly to students versus a yearly school\nfundraiser that involves door-to-door sales of cookie dough or\nother products. Finally, we were unable to assess the magnitude of\nstudent exposure to energy-dense products--nor of the impact on\nweight outcomes due to student consumption of such products--\nthrough fundraising, but focused instead on school-wide fundrais-\ning restrictions. Nevertheless, the results do demonstrate the strong\nassociation between school policies with state law and district\npolicy, and the continued need to promote school-level imple-\nmentation of policies.\nConclusions\nIn summary, many U.S. public elementary schools do not place\nnutritional restrictions on school fundraising activities. Few\ndistricts and states have strong policies about the nutritional\nquality of products used in fundraisers but, when they do, policies\nat both jurisdictions are associated with school-level restrictions.\nRevision of formal district policies and state laws to strengthen\nexisting provisions written as recommendations rather than\nrestrictions may be an effective strategy for impacting the\nelementary school environment, as would the development of\nnew policies and laws where none exist. The USDA also has an\nopportunity through the forthcoming competitive food regulations\nto ensure that the standards apply broadly to all competitive foods\nsold in schools, including in-school fundraisers. Additional efforts\nare required to help schools follow district policies and state laws.\n"
