    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores the changing roles of families in children's developing literacy in the\nUK in the last century. It discusses how, during this time, understandings of reading and\nwriting have evolved into the more nuanced notion of literacy. Further, in acknowledging\nchanges in written communication practices, and shifting attitudes to reading and writ-\ning, the paper sketches out how families have always played some part in the literacy of\nyounger generations; though reading was frequently integral to the lives of many families\nthroughout the past century, we consider in particular the more recent enhancement of\nchildren's literacy through targeted family programmes. The paper considers policy\nimplications for promoting young children's literacy through work with families.\n",
