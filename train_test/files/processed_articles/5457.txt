The question that arises is how different these\ntypes of recent movements really are from previous mobilisations.\nA prototype example of such a movement emerged in Spain after mass demonstrations\non 15 May 2011, stimulating also the rise of similar ones in Greece, Portugal and else-\nwhere. Inspired by St\u00e9phane Hessel's essay Indignez-vous! (Hessel, 2010) \u00ad published in\nEnglish as Time for Outrage (Hessel, 2011) \u00ad the so-called 15M or Indignados movement\nin Spain attracted mainly young people not connected with any of the established political\nactors, such as parties of the left and trade unions, but mobilised instead through informal\nnetworks (Anduiza et al., 2014). The Spanish Indignados certainly seem to fit the idea of\nnew movements as a form of `connective action' (Bennett and Segerberg, 2013), mainly\ndriven by young, politically alienated and unattached people, networking through social\nHowever, alternative accounts of movement mobilisation elsewhere contradict or at\nleast shed doubt on the empirical usefulness of this framework. Comparative studies of\nanti-austerity protest suggest that, in many cases, traditional left-wing political parties\nand trade unions are still prominently involved (Peterson et al., 2015). In Portugal, for\ninstance, Accornero and Ramos Pinto (2015) found that labour unions were the most\nimportant factor in anti-austerity protest from 2010 to 2013. Similarly, anti-austerity\nmobilisation in Greece during 2010 did not fit this new model, mobilising instead a broad\nrange of people with protest experience, not just the young or the politically detached\nGreece, a country severely hit by the economic crisis and experiencing mass protest\nagainst unpopular austerity measures, offers an ideal setting to explore how movements\nevolve and how people mobilise in light of the above debates and of empirical develop-\nments. Anti-austerity mobilisation can be found at various stages between 2010 and 2015.\nTo analyse the development of protest movements over time, the concepts of `waves' and\n`cycles' are frequently used in the literature. However, the concept of a `cycle' implies an\nelement of a standard sequence of events which we think is not appropriate here (see\nbetween three distinct `waves' of anti-austerity protest in Greece which involve different\nmobilisation patterns.\nThe first wave consists of the anti-austerity mass protest that emerged during 2010 and\nintensified after the bailout agreement in May (R\u00fcdig and Karyotis, 2014). The second\nwave of protest occurred in 2011 and saw not only a further increase in participation\n(Diani and Kousis, 2014) but also an expansion of its activities, notably with the occupa-\ntionofcentralsquaresbyanIndignados-inspirednewmovementcalledtheA\n[Aganaktismeni] (Mavrommatis, 2015; Simiti, 2014; Sotirakopoulos and Sotiropoulos,\n2013). A third wave of mobilisation, from mid-2012 onwards, coincided with a partial\nshift of focus from the streets to the electoral arena, with a previously marginal party, the\nCoalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), establishing itself as the main party of the move-\nThis article seeks to analyse these developments in Greece, drawing on a series\nof original general public attitude telephone surveys conducted by Kapa Research\nwas conducted in December 2010. A stratified quota sample was used as the selection\nmethod, with one interview per household and quotas defined according to census data\nfor gender, age and region. Telephone codes corresponding to each region in relation to\nits population size were selected, with the remaining dialling digits generated randomly\nwith the aid of computer software and producing a dataset with 1014 valid responses.\nIn December 2011, 511 of those respondents were re-interviewed. Despite the rather\nlarge degree of survey attrition, analyses of the background of respondents compared\nwith non-respondents do not reveal any significant non-response bias. A new repre-\nsentative survey was carried out in February 2015, following the same process as the\nfirst one and resulting in 1019 valid responses.\nThe timing of these surveys and the consistent use of identical questions administered\nto both participants and non-participants in demonstrations provide a unique opportunity\nto study how the anti-austerity movement evolved over time. More specifically, the aims\nof this article are twofold: first, to explore the extent to which the emergence of the Greek\nIndignados and the rise of an anti-austerity party changed the nature of anti-austerity\nmobilisation in Greece compared to 2010; second, to investigate any links that might\nexist between a protest movement and electoral politics by analysing the extent to which\nparticipation in anti-austerity demonstrations was a factor in SYRIZA's eventual victory\nin the January 2015 elections. Before discussing our empirical results and their broader\ntheoretical and empirical implications, the article starts with a closer look at the specific\ncontext of the three waves of anti-austerity protest in Greece.\nSocial movements seek to shape their political and institutional context but they are\nalso themselves a product of that same context. As Charles Tilly (1979: 131) noted, the\narray of collective actions, or `protest repertoires', which are available to them are\ndetermined and limited by the particular time, place and population of a specific socio-\npolitical and historical context. The first wave of anti-austerity mobilisation in Greece\nwas a direct response to the introduction of austerity measures in 2010 (Psimitis, 2011).\nNew official police data, first presented here (see Figure 1), demonstrate the high fre-\nquency of protest events (7123) that accelerated after the first bailout agreement was\nsigned in May 2010. Rather than representing a particular sector of society, protesters\ncrossed through all ideological divides, professional backgrounds and age cohorts.\nMost crucially, in this first phase, factors such as the degree of relative deprivation\nwere a significant predictor of opposition to austerity and potential protest but were not\nconducive to explaining who actually took to the streets. Instead, the most important\nfactor was socialisation into protest through prior participation before the economic\nThe rise of anti-austerity protest in 2010 did thus mainly reflect Greece's strong and\nidiosyncratic `protest culture', a historically romanticised and glorified view of conten-\ntious politics, largely rooted in the successful struggle against the military junta in the\n1970s (Andronikidou and Kovras, 2012). The comparatively frequent and intense protest\nactions in Greece is organisationally linked to a number of resilient extra-parliamentary\nleftist groups (Kassimeris, 2005), as well as trade unions and parliamentary parties of the\nleft, giving it an `old politics'flavour. On the whole, the high share of the population with\nexperience of protest activity meant that a large reservoir of individuals existed who\ncould re-mobilise in the anti-austerity movement of 2010 and subsequently. Indeed,\naccording to our first survey fielded in December 2010, 23% of the adult population\nclaimed to have participated in anti-austerity demonstrations earlier in the year.\nAnti-austerity protest in Greece seemed to evolve further during 2011, bringing the\npercentage of people claiming to have taken part in a demonstration up to 36%, when our\nsecond survey was fielded in December 2011. A key feature of this second wave of mobi-\nlisation was the rise of the Aganaktismeni movement, inspired by the occupation of Tahrir\nSquare in Cairo and the 15M movement in Spain. Also referred to as the `movement of\nsquares' (Diani and Kousis, 2014; Kaika and Karaliotas, 2014), this phenomenon added\na new protest mode to strikes and demonstrations used in 2010, focusing on the occupa-\ntion of public spaces, most visibly in Syntagma Square in front of the Greek Parliament,\nfrom 25 May until 7August 2011, with further isolated events after the summer (Aslanidis\nand Marantzidis, 2016: 132). The protesters' main call was for more accountable and\ndirect models of democracy and for an end to austerity (Diani and Kousis, 2014;\nSotirakopoulos and Sotiropoulos, 2013). Such grassroots, self-organised assemblies in\ncentral squares are defined by their inclusive and diverse nature, their fluid and leaderless\nstructure and their use of and mobilisation via digital media (Castells, 2012).\nPrevious analyses have identified various new aspects of the Aganaktismeni move-\nment, as compared with the first wave of protest in Greece: its extensive use of social\nmedia (Theocharis, 2016), its `apartisan and peaceful character' (Garc\u00eda-Albacete and\ndiversity of views it represented, stretching across the political spectrum, including the\nfar right (Kaika and Karaliotas, 2014; Simiti, 2014). Clearly, the dominant perception is\nthat the Aganaktismeni added a new, unique dimension to Greek anti-austerity protest.\nIn Spain, this form of protest attracted younger, more educated and less politically\ninvolved participants than other movements (Anduiza et al., 2014). Our data allow us to\nhave a closer look at the socio-political profile of the `Greek indignados' to assess the\nextent to which their emergence facilitated a substantial step-change in the nature of the\nanti-austerity movement in Greece.\nA third wave of mobilisation began in the run-up to the May/June 2012 Parliamentary\nelections. Coordinated Large Protest Events (LPEs), with over 5000 participants and\nSource: Hellenic Police Statistics, Personal Communication with Press Office, 2 April 2012 and 2 September 2014.\nsynchronised actions across the country, declined significantly after March 2012, following\na peak in the previous period (Diani and Kousis, 2014; Kanellopoulos et al., 2016). However,\nthe absolute number of marches and demonstrations recorded in the police data remained\n6months of 2014. Admittedly, such protest event data are not issue-specific and lack details\non their size, networks and claims, which a systematic study of LPEs can more reliably\nprovide. It does, however, indicate continuing levels of decentralised yet widespread\n`everyday forms of resistance' (Scott, 1985), which are typically not captured by main-\nstream newspaper reports (see Mueller, 1997). In the absence of any other major social\nmovement organising protests at that time, it does not seem unreasonable to hypothesise\nthat most of these protests targeted austerity. Such an interpretation would certainly be con-\nsistent with our survey findings. In our third survey fielded in February 2015, 28% of our\nrespondents said they had participated in anti-austerity protests after June 2012. Thus, from\nour attitude data, a picture develops of protest emerging strongly in 2010 and rising further\nBeyond the question of how later protest participants compared with those involved at\nthe high time of mobilisation in the previous two waves of protest, the 2012\u00ad2015 phase\nis of particular interest because of its relation to party politics. Crucially for this third\nwave, opponents to austerity found new opportunities to express their discontent in the\nelectoral arena. The radical-left SYRIZA emerged as the main political force against aus-\nvote. In the next section, we propose a model which we apply to analyse not just protest\nbehaviour across the three waves but also the drivers of voting for SYRIZA in 2015.\nDissecting the Drivers of Protest\nThe above narrative reveals the complex, multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of the\nanti-austerity movement in Greece. To analyse the drivers of participating in demonstra-\ntions in each of the three waves identified, we propose two models. The first model offers\na synthesis of variables from a range of protest theories and traditions. Membership in\ntrade unions, left-wing ideology and male gender are typical characteristics of `old'social\nmovements (Walgrave and Van Aelst, 2001). A high level of formal education, strong\npolitical interest and post-materialism (Barnes et al., 1979) were seen as indicative of\nparticipation in `new social movements' (NSM), along with `social capital' explanations\nsuch as membership in voluntary organisations and a high level of interpersonal trust\n(Benson and Rochon, 2004; Kaase, 1999). Variables associated with `new new social\nmovements' and the notion of `connective action' (Langman, 2013) complete the model,\nnamely, engagement with social media and detachment from political parties, which fea-\ntured in the Spanish indignados case (Anduiza et al., 2014).\nOur second model considers issue and context-specific variables as additional con-\ntrols, in line with R\u00fcdig and Karyotis (2014). Controlling for opposition to austerity, sup-\nport for the notion that people should protest against the measures and place of residence\nis designed to tease out which variables distinguish between potential and actual protest-\ners. Prior socialisation into protest before 2010 will account for the contextual influence\nof the Greek `protest culture'. The results are presented in Table 1.\nOur analysis of the first wave of mobilisation during 2010 reveals, rather emphatically,\nthat it fits more closely to the profile of `old' social movements. Being male, left-wing\nTable 1.

Beyond these, people\nunder 50years who are interested in politics are more likely to take part in demonstra-\ntions, but other NSM variables do not make a difference. Once we apply the controls of\nour second model, only left-wing self-positioning remains a statistically significant pre-\ndictor. This resonates with previous studies which found that in 2010, the anti-austerity\nmovement in Greece was largely dominated by the `usual suspects', who already had\nThe second wave of protest during 2011 is marked by the emergence of the\nAganaktismeni, which may have substantially altered the characteristics of the anti-\nausterity movement in Greece. Our first model suggests that the movement at that time\nmainly mobilised the under 65s on the left of the political spectrum, but none of the other\nvariables associated with `old' or `new' social movements figure as statistically signifi-\ncant predictors. Once the controls are applied, the profile of 2011 demonstrators is rather\nsimilar to those from the earlier wave, with the exception of younger age groups coming\nin as significant predictors. Anti-austerity demonstrations in 2011 attracted a somewhat\nyounger group of people but otherwise, against our expectations, the second protest phase\ndid not lead to a greater importance of predictors associated with the NSM model. What\nappears to have happened is that as popular mobilisation increased to unprecedented\nlevels, a more varied group of people was attracted to participate in protest activities,\nwhich did not fit the usual pattern. This does tally with the qualitative accounts of the\nAganaktismeni, which emphasised the larger variety, both socially and politically, of\nthose participating in protest events during 2011 (see, for example, Simiti, 2014).\nOur data also allow us to have a closer look at the Aganaktismeni phenomenon. In our\nDecember 2011 survey, we asked about participation in demonstrations against austerity,\nbut separately, respondents were also asked whether they had personally taken part in\n`the protest movement of \"Aganaktismen\" in the central squares of Greece'. 36% of our\nsample declared having taken part in anti-austerity demonstrations and 29% in the\nAganaktismeni.2 A total of 43% claimed to have participated in either demonstrations or\nAganaktismeni, representing quite a remarkable mobilisation of the Greek population\nagainst austerity. However, perhaps surprisingly, the two groups only partially over-\nlapped. More than 70% of protesters had engaged in both types of protest, but about a\nfifth had only taken part in demonstrations, and 1 in 10 had only participated in the\nAganaktismeni but not in anti-austerity demonstrations.\nA more detailed comparison of these three groups (results not shown) suggests that the\nAganaktismeni participants who apparently did not perceive their actions as being part of\nan anti-austerity demonstration are markedly different from the other two groups and\nfrom 2011 demonstrators as a whole. They are older, less likely to be members of volun-\ntary organisations and have a lower degree of interpersonal trust. This combination of\npredictors suggests that a theory of political alienation \u00ad which, so far, has not been used\nfor the explanation of anti-austerity protest \u00ad might be relevant here: the Aganaktismeni\ntouched, at least marginally, on a group of people who are not part of the usual Greek\nprotest culture but clearly do not fit a `new social movement' profile either.\nA more drastic transformation of the anti-austerity movement in Greece manifests\nitself during the third wave of protest, after the June 2012 elections. Contrary to the ear-\nlier waves, there is a larger dominance of variables associated with the NSM approach\nduring this period. Interpersonal trust, political interest and post-materialism are all sig-\nnificant predictors of taking part in demonstrations, in addition to left\u00adright positioning.\nThe result is even stronger in favour of the NSM framework, once we include the control\nvariables: not only do interpersonal trust and political interest remain statistically signifi-\ncant, but also being under 35years. Membership of trade unions is now negatively associ-\nated with taking part (but not statistically significant), indicating overall quite a shift from\nan `old' to a `new' social movement basis.\nThe 2015 survey also allows us to examine the effect of social media. At the bivariate\nlevel, we find that demonstrators follow politics via social media very frequently (40%),\nas opposed to 28% of non-demonstrators. Even once we control for age, gender, educa-\ntion and political interest, high use of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, does\ncome out as a statistically significant predictor of protest participation. However, once we\ninclude the austerity-related variables and prior demonstration experience as controls in\nour second model, the logit coefficient for social media remains positive but not statisti-\ncally significant. This finding could be interpreted both in contextual and substantive\nterms. Social media was certainly frequently used by the organisers of Aganaktismeni\nevents, but it may be doubtful whether it was an important mobilisation tool. According\nto Yannis Theocharis et al. (2015), Twitter was far less important for mobilisation pur-\nposes to the Aganaktismeni than to the Spanish Indignados or the Occupy movement\nin the US. More fundamentally, the idea that social media plays a key role for protest\nmobilisation in general has been disputed or qualified by various studies (e.g. Brym et al.,\n2014; Lee and Chan, 2016). Indeed, our data suggest that while social media may have\nplayed a role in protest organisation in Greece, and a vital one in the case of the\nAganaktismeni according to journalistic accounts (Theocharis, 2016), virtual support for\nthe anti-austerity movement does not necessarily translate into actual protest.\nMobilisation and Electoral Politics\nThe analysis has so far focused on demonstrators. In the third wave, however, protest is\nalso partially displaced from the streets to the electoral arena, with SYRIZA emerging as\nthe main political opponent to austerity through conventional channels. Strategically\nrevamping its discourse `to align itself closely with the populist Zeitgeist of the indigna-\ndos', SYRIZA developed an `osmotic relationship' with protesters and progressively\nattracted the support of many voters who rejected not only austerity but also the (perceived\nStavrakakis and Katsambekis, 2014). After the June 2012 elections, in particular, SYRIZA\n`tried to bring together diverse groups by re-affirming the same antagonistic frontier estab-\nlished by the aganaktismenoi'(Prentoulis and Thomassen, 2014: 228). These observations\noffer an opportunity to explore one aspect of the understudied association between social\nmovements and elections (McAdam and Tarrow, 2013). Would our model drawn from\nprotest theories also help explain SYRIZA's victory in the January 2015 elections?\nThe results of our analyses, presented in the last two columns of Table 1, reveal not only\nsignificant similarities but also differences between the drivers of demonstrating and vot-\ning. With SYRIZApresenting itself as a party committed to rolling back austerity, it cannot\nbe a surprise that its voters share with demonstrators opposition to austerity, support for\nprotest and left-wing ideology. Crucially, including participation in any anti-austerity dem-\nonstrations in our full model, we find that it is positively associated with voting for\nSYRIZA. Over half (54%) of those who demonstrated against austerity between 2010 and\n2015 voted for SYRIZA in the January 2015 elections. This underlines the intrinsic rela-\ntionship between electoral and non-electoral arenas and the effects of protest on party poli-\ntics, clearly an area that merits further investigation in comparative settings.\nThere are also some other noteworthy and counter-intuitive findings. Social media has\na statistically significant and positive effect on voting for SYRIZA in 2015. This result\ntallies with analyses of SYRIZA's election campaign, which was carefully crafted to\ncounter its perceived exclusion from pro-establishment traditional media. This helped\nSYRIZA dislocate the dominant narrative that there was no alternative to austerity\n(Common Space, 2015; Tsakatika and Eleftheriou, 2013). The negative effect of union\nmembership on the SYRIZA vote on the other hand indicates that it failed to strengthen\nits ties with trade unions, which have historically been dominated by the Socialist PASOK\nand the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), and where, pre-crisis, it had no real militant\ntradition or base (Tsakatika and Eleftheriou, 2013).\nBeyond voting for SYRIZA, demonstrators have also developed a fairly high level of\nparty identification with the party. 36% of demonstrators did not feel close to any party,\nbut 39% felt `close' to SYRIZA in 2015. This is quite a change from the beginning of\nthe movement. Back in 2010, 60% of anti-austerity demonstrators did not feel close to\nany party. SYRIZA was a small left-wing party, with which only 3% of demonstrators\nidentified. In our models of participation in demonstrations, the variable indicating a\nlack of party identification is negative (but not statistically significant) across all three\nwaves. The implication is that protesters in Greece, unlike the Spanish indignados, are\nnot radically detached from political parties, and in fact increasingly identified with\nSYRIZA over time, which contributed to its electoral success.\nConclusion\nThe results of our analysis of anti-austerity protest in Greece based on surveys covering a\nperiod of more than 5\nyears reveal many distinct elements of continuity and change.\nContrary to expectations, the rise of the Greek version of the Indignados during 2011 did\nnot decisively transform the anti-austerity movement in the way that `Occupy social\nmovements' did in other countries. Our data show that the social background of anti-\nausterity demonstrators in 2011 was very similar to 2010, although younger people, as\nwell as some who showed signs of not just political but also social alienation, featured\nmore prominently. There is, however, clearer evidence of the movement's evolution dur-\ning its third wave of mobilisation, after 2012, with elements of the `new' social move-\nment' approach complementing its earlier `old social movement' characteristics, such as\nleft-wing ideology and prior socialisation into protest. Age, which is not a factor during\nthe first wave, becomes statistically significant for those under 50\nyears in the second\nwave and is further narrowed down to the under 35s during the third wave. In this third\nwave, interpersonal trust and political interest are positively associated with protest, but\neducation, post-materialism and membership of voluntary associations do not feature.\nThe pattern of mobilisation which we identify, thus, does not easily fit into an `old'\nversus `new'/`new new' movement distinction. Further analysis may reveal several dis-\ntinct paths towards protest participation. We also have to note that in concentrating on the\nsocial background of demonstrators, we had to ignore other variables which may play an\nimportant role in shaping the movement, for example, the degree of economic depriva-\ntion, blame attribution or `rational choice' type considerations. One notable advantage of\nour approach is that we are able to compare protesters with non-protesters, while similar\nstudies elsewhere rely on surveys of demonstrators alone (e.g. Anduiza et al., 2014;\nGrasso and Giugni, 2015; Peterson et al., 2015). For future work, exploring in greater\ndepth the causes of the changes in the movement which we document should be of\nparticular interest. Further analysis is needed on whether this is based on personal changes\namong demonstrators or reflects the pattern of mobilisation and demobilisation of veteran\nand new protest participants.\nFinally, our article underlines the links between electoral and non-electoral arenas. A\nparticularly interesting feature of the change over time is the emergence of SYRIZA as\nthe party which a substantial share of demonstrators identify with. A relatively high level\nof party identification may normally be a promising basis for future electoral success.\nHowever, given that SYRIZA was unable to fulfil most of its election promises on the end\nof austerity in Greece and now faces the daunting task of implementing a new austerity\nprogramme it signed up to in July 2015, it will be interesting to see to what extent it can\nmaintain its electoral support base or face a new wave of anti-austerity protest.\n"
