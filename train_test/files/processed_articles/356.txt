The effect of decreasing mortality among medically\ncomplex children with cardiac or lung disease on the overall\nRSV mortality rate is unknown. Here we describe trends in\nbronchiolitis-associated deaths among US children and esti-\nmate deaths potentially associated with RSV infection by using\nnational data for bronchiolitis and pneumonia deaths. Current\nestimates of childhood mortality associated with RSV infection\nare important for economic assessments of prevention inter-\nventions, including the cost-effectiveness of the recently licensed\nhumanized murine monoclonal anti-RSV antibody, palivizu-\nmab [13\u00ad15], and of candidate RSV vaccines.\nMethods\nSources of data. We analyzed multiple cause-of-deathmortality\ndata compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers\n17]. A bronchiolitis-associated death was defined as a death for\nwhich an International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision;\nICD-9) code for acute bronchiolitis (466.1) appeared anywhere on\nthe death record [18]. Since 20 multiple causes-of-death can be\nlisted on a death certificate, use of such a strategy should capture\nboth nosocomial bronchiolitis cases and those deaths for which\nbronchiolitis was a contributing, but secondary, cause. Records for\namined. The single underlying cause of death for each bronchiolitis-\nassociated death was determined by using computerized selection\nand modification rules that were developed to ensure international\nBecause congenital heart disease [10, 21], chronic lung disease\n[22], and premature birth [23] have been associated with increased\nmorbidity among infants hospitalized with RSV infection, these\nconditions were specifically ascertained among those children who\ndied with bronchiolitis. Prematurity was defined by the appearance\nof ICD-9 code 765 (disorders relating to short gestation and un-\nspecified low birth weight) anywhere on the death record. Children\nwere classified as having lung disease arising in the perinatal period\nif any of the following codes appeared in death records: 769 (res-\npiratory distress syndrome), 770.1 (meconium or massive aspiration\nsyndrome), 770.2 (interstitial emphysema and related conditions),\nmonary immaturity not otherwise specified), 770.5 (other atelec-\ntasis originating in the perinatal period), 770.7 (chronic respiratory\ndisease arising in the perinatal period), 770.8 (other respiratory\nproblems after birth arising in the perinatal period), or 770.9 (un-\nspecified respiratory condition of the fetus and newborn). The fol-\nlowing ICD-9 codes were used to define the presence of congenital\nheart disease: 745 (bulbous cordis anomalies and anomalies of car-\ndiac septal closure), 746 (other congenital anomalies of the heart),\n(other anomalies of aorta), 747.3 (anomalies of pulmonary artery),\nData analysis. The distribution of bronchiolitis-associated\ndeaths was examined by year, month of death, age (!1 year or 1\u00ad4\nyears), sex, race (white, black, or other), and association with other\ndiagnoses listed in death records. Place of residence was analyzed\nby using the 4 standard census geographic regions: Northeast,\nSouth, Midwest, and West. Among infants, annual bronchiolitis\nmortality rates were calculated as the number of deaths per 100,000\nlive births [24]. For children 1\u00ad4 years old, denominators were\ncalculated by subtracting births from intercensal population esti-\nmates of children !5 years old for the corresponding year [25].\nPoisson regression analysis was used to determine risk ratios (RRs)\nand to calculate 95% confidence intervals [26]. To detect possible\nproportions of death records that listed bronchiolitis as the un-\nderlying, rather than a multiple, cause of death were compared by\ncalendar year with the Cochran-Armitage test by StatXact 3 soft-\nware (Cytel Software). A similar method was used to compare the\nproportions of children dying with bronchiolitis also diagnosed\nwith prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease\nover time. A 2-tailed was considered statistically significant.\nEstimates of RSV-associated deaths. Death certificates often\ndo not specify the etiological agent of many infectious diseases,\nincluding bronchiolitis. Therefore, we assumed that the proportions\nof children dying with bronchiolitis or pneumonia who were in-\nfected with RSV were similar to the proportions of children hos-\npitalized in temperate countries for bronchiolitis or pneumoniawho\nwere RSV infected [27\u00ad37]. Thus, RSV-related deaths were esti-\nmated by multiplying the average annual number of bronchiolitis\ndeaths by 0.3\u00ad0.7 and by adding this figure to the average number\nResults\nBronchiolitis-associated deaths. During the 19-year study\nperiod, 1806 bronchiolitis-associated deaths occurred among\nold. Among infants, the median age at death was 3 months\n(interquartile range, 2\u00ad5 months). Bronchiolitis-associated\ndeaths peaked in January, when 18% of deaths during the study\nperiod occurred (figure 1). Most bronchiolitis deaths, 77%\namong children !1 year old and 71% among children 1\u00ad4 years\nold, occurred during the typical November through April RSV\nseason. The proportion of bronchiolitis-associated deaths dur-\ning the RSV season was significantly greater among children\n!1 year than among children 1\u00ad4 years old ( ). Patterns\nof monthly mortality did not vary by calendar year or geo-\ngraphic region of residence (data not shown).\nBronchiolitis was the underlying cause of death in 55% of\nchildren who died with bronchiolitis (table 1). Either acute bron-\nchiolitis or acute bronchitis was the underlying cause in 62% of\ndeaths.

Although\nsome year-to-year variability in these rates was demonstrated,\nparticularly among infants, the 1997 rates were similar to the\nAlthough the majority of bronchiolitis-associated deaths oc-\ncurred among white children (64%), mortality rates were sig-\nnificantly higher among black infants (RR, 2.4) and black chil-\ndren 1\u00ad4 years old (RR, 3.0), compared with those of white\nchildren (table 2). Male infants were 1.5 times more likely to\ndie with bronchiolitis than were female infants; however, boys\n1\u00ad4 years old were not at a significantly increased risk of dying\nwith bronchiolitis. Children in the South faced the greatest risk\nof dying with bronchiolitis (RR, 1.6), compared with that of\ninfants in the Northeast, who had the lowest rates.\nEstimates of RSV-associated mortality. A mean of 1772\npneumonia-associated deaths occurred annually among chil-\ndren !5 years old during the study period; of these, 1261 deaths\n(71%) occurred among infants !1 year old. To estimate RSV-\nassociated mortality, we multiplied the annual average of pneu-\nmonia deaths by 0.08\u00ad0.25 and added this number to the annual\naverage of 95 bronchiolitis deaths multiplied by 0.3\u00ad0.7. Under\nFigure 2.

In contrast, child-\nhood deaths associated with any respiratory disease decreased\nsteadily. Fewer than 3000 respiratory deaths occurred annually\nduring the last 4 years of the study period, 1500 fewer than the\n4500 estimated for RSV alone by the Institute of Medicine.\nMost children dying with bronchiolitis were not concurrently\ndiagnosed with underlying prematurity or pulmonary or cardiac\nconditions. This finding suggests that the majority of RSV-related\ndeaths do not occur among children who are presumed to be at\nhigh risk for severe RSV LRTIs. Prophylactic therapy with either\nRSV-enriched human immunoglobulin or a humanized murine\nmonoclonal anti\u00adF protein antibody is available for premature\ninfants and children with chronic lung disease [13]. However, our\nfindings suggest that appropriate use of these antibody therapies\nwill not prevent the majority of RSV-associated deaths.\nAlthough the only specific ICD-9 code for RSV-related dis-\nease (RSV pneumonia, code 480.1) appeared infrequently in\nthe records of children who died with bronchiolitis (1.6%), the\nseasonal pattern of deaths and the fact that 79% of these deaths\noccurred among infants provide evidence that RSV is the pri-\nmary virus associated with bronchiolitis deaths. Our findings,\nthat male infants are more likely to die with bronchiolitis than\nare female infants and that black children and those living in\nthe South are at the greatest risk of bronchiolitis-associated\ndeath, are consistent with results of studies of children hospi-\ntalized with RSV infection. Boys are 1.5 times more likely\nthan are girls to be hospitalized with RSV infections [4, 37],\nand lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased\nrisk for hospitalization with RSV [6, 38]. Black race and resi-\ndence in the South have been used as crude surrogates for lower\nsocioeconomic status among US children [39].\nTable 2.

We\nalso found that 80% of these deaths occur among infants,\namong adults 65 years old may be RSV associated [40]. There-\nfore, considerably more RSV-related deaths appear to occur\namong the elderly than among children !5 years old.\nThe fact that fewer than 3000 respiratory deaths of all types\ncurrently occur among young children may constitute the most\ncompelling evidence that the 1985 Institute of Medicine RSV\nmortality estimates are too high to be applicable to the current\nUS population of children. The 1985 figures were derived by\ngle tertiary-care facility (5%) to the US population of children.\nMore recent hospital-based studies indicate that mortality from\nRSV-associated illnesses among high-risk children has de-\ncreased since then [11, 12]. In addition, many children with\ncommon childhood diseases (e.g., bronchiolitis) are hospitalized\nin general community hospitals. The application of morbidity\nand mortality estimates derived from tertiary-care centers,\nwhich typically care for more severely ill children, to the general\npopulation may overestimate serious sequelae, including death.\nFor example, initial reports from academic medical centers of\nchildren evaluated for febrile seizures indicated recurrence rates\nas high as 71% and a markedly increased risk for later non-\nfebrile seizures [41]. Subsequent population-based studiesfound\nlower febrile seizure recurrence rates (29%\u00ad35%) and only a\nnominally increased risk for epilepsy among children followed\nup after an initial febrile seizure [41]. Other examples of referral\nbias in observational studies conducted within tertiary-care fa-\ncilities include clinical trials and outcomes studies among pa-\ntients with multiple sclerosis [42] and diabetes mellitus [43].\nAn interesting finding in our analysis is that, although mor-\ntality rates for all respiratory disease deaths among children\n!5 years old decreased during the study period, bronchiolitis-\nassociated mortality rates remained essentially unchanged.\nIn contrast, bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization rates in-\ncreasing hospitalization rates have not been accompanied by\nconcomitant increases in mortality rates. These findings prompt\n2 hypotheses: (1) improved medical and surgical care has\ndecreased the proportion of children hospitalized with bron-\nchiolitis who die, and (2) children with less severe bronchiolitis\nhave had an increased chance of hospitalization since 1980.\nMortality among high-risk RSV-infected children hospital-\nized in academic centers decreased during the study period [11,\n12]. As the study period progressed, we believe that less severely\nill infants may have been more likely to be hospitalized for\nbronchiolitis. Changes in the evaluation and monitoring of\nyoung children with lower respiratory tract illnesses could result\nin increased bronchiolitis hospitalizations, without affecting\nmortality rates. For example, expansion of pulse oximetry use\nin the evaluation of wheezing infants might lower the threshold\nfor hospitalization among RSV-infected children who have mild\nhypoxia but who are not at risk of impending respiratory failure\n[4]. Also, pathology studies linking viral respiratory infection\nto sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases [44] and epi-\ndemiological associations between SIDS deaths and temporal\npatterns of RSV detection [8] may have compelled health care\nproviders to hospitalize more young RSV-infected infants for\napnea observation as pediatric monitoring methods improved.\nOur population-based study has several limitations. One is the\nlack of ICD-9 codes that specifically and completely capture\nRSV-associated mortality. Therefore, we were forced to estimate\nthe RSV mortality burden by multiplying deaths associated with\nbronchiolitis or pneumonia by the proportions of these diagnoses\nassociated with RSV infection among hospitalized children.\nSome children whose deaths were related to RSV infection may\nnot have been included in the death records we used. For ex-\nample, it is possible that infants dying with chronic lung disease\nduring the winter months may have had undocumented respi-\nratory viral infections that contributed to their mortality. How-\never, too few children currently die in the United States with\ndiagnoses such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia to account for\nthe differences between our estimates and those of the Institute\nof Medicine. Finally, the presence of comorbid conditions may\nhave been underestimated in death certificate records. On the\nbasis of a previous study, we almost certainly underestimated the\nprevalence of prematurity [45]. For other conditions that we were\nspecifically interested in, however, death certificates appear to\nrecord underlying conditions adequately. For example, congen-\nital heart disease, when examined as a single entity, is completely\ncaptured in death records, although specific diagnoses (e.g.,\ntetralogy of Fallot) are not adequately identified [46].\nA variety of therapies for bronchiolitis and RSV disease were\nintroduced or became more widely used during the study period,\nincluding ribavirin, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids [47].\nHowever, increasing use of these drugs did not lead to decreasing\nrates of childhood bronchiolitis deaths. Corticosteroid treatment\nof bronchiolitis and RSV infection was found ineffective in 2\nlarge, well-designed clinical trials [48, 49]. Use of ribavirin in\nseverely ill patients with RSV disease may not improve outcomes\n[50, 51], and routine use of bronchodilators in less severely ill\npatients remains controversial [52, 53]. An apparent lack of an\neffect of more medication use on bronchiolitis-associated mor-\nbidity has also been demonstrated among hospitalized children.\nCanadian children hospitalized with RSV infections in 12 pedi-\natric tertiary-care centers experienced similar lengths of stay at\neach center, despite considerable variation in medication use,\nparticularly among previously healthy children [54].\nIn summary, RSV-associated mortality among young US\nchildren is considerably lower than previously estimated. It is\nunlikely that currently available prevention or therapeutic in-\nterventions will substantially influence RSV-associated mortal-\nity among young children. If RSV-associated mortality is to be\nreduced, effective RSV vaccines that can be administered safely\nto infants and the elderly are needed.\n"
