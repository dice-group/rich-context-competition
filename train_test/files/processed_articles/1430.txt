Data on\ntherapy for diabetes, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose, and HbA1c\nvalues were\nobtained by structured questionnaires and by clinical and laboratory assessments.\nRESULTS -- According to the data, 29% of patients treated with insulin, 65% treated with\noral agents, and 80% treated with diet alone had never monitored their blood glucose or\nmonitored it less than once per month. Self-monitoring at least once per day was practiced by\n39% of those taking insulin and 5\u00ad6% of those treated with oral agents or diet alone. For all\npatients combined, the proportion of patients who tested their blood glucose increased with an\nincreasing HbA1c\nvalue. However, when examined by diabetes therapy category, there was little\nrelationship between HbA1c\nvalue and the proportion testing at least once per day or the\nproportion testing at least once per week.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In this cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes, the increase\nin frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose with increasing HbA1c\nvalue was associated with\nthe higher proportion of insulin-treated patients in higher HbA1c\ncategories. Within diabetes\ntherapy categories, the frequency of self-monitoring was not related to glycemic control, as\nmeasured by HbA1c\nlevel.\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose is\nbelieved to be a useful component of\npatient self-care practices. For pa-\ntients with type 2 diabetes, the American\nDiabetes Association (ADA) position is\nthat daily self-monitoring is especially im-\nportant for those treated with insulin or\noral agents to monitor for and prevent\nasymptomatic hypoglycemia (1). Self-\nmonitoring is also suggested for these pa-\ntients to facilitate reaching blood glucose\ngoals, although the role of self-monitoring\nin diet-treated patients with type 2 diabe-\ntes is not specified by the ADA (1). Given\nthe two-fold objective of monitoring glu-\ncose levels at both the low and high ends\nof the spectrum, it might be expected that\nmonitoring might be more frequent for\nthose with lower and those with higher\nblood glucose values compared with pa-\ntients in the intermediate range. We in-\nvestigated the relationship between blood\nglucose level, measured as HbA1c\n, and the\nfrequency of self-monitoring in a nation-\nwide sample of patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes.\nMETHODS -- Data were analyzed\nfrom the third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III),\nin which questionnaire, clinical, and lab-\noratory data were obtained for a repre-\nsentative sample of adults with type 2\ndiabetes. NHANES III was conducted\nand included a stratified probability sam-\nple of the civilian noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population (2). Participants were in-\nterviewed in their homes and were given a\nstandardized set of examinations and lab-\noratory measurements in a mobile exam-\nparticipants aged 25 years, of whom\nby a physician before the survey. Women\nwith diabetes diagnosed only during\npregnancy (n  105) and subjects with\ntype 1 diabetes, defined as those with age\nat diagnosis 30 years who had continu-\nous insulin use since diagnosis of diabetes\n(n  23), were excluded from analysis.\nsidered to have type 2 diabetes.\nInformation was obtained by struc-\ntured questionnaires on diabetes therapy\nand blood glucose self-monitoring. Mea-\nsurement of HbA1c\nwas made during a\nseparate clinical examination in which\n88.2% of the interviewed subjects partic-\nwas measured by a\nhigh-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphic assay as used in the Diabetes Con-\ntrol and Complications Trial. The upper\nlimit of normal for HbA1c\nin the assay sys-\ntem is 6.1%, defined as the mean  2 SDs\nwith fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dl\ndl. This value (6.1%) is virtually identical\nto the upper limit of normal (6.0%) rec-\nommended by the ADA using the same\nassay system (1). Statistical analyses were\nperformed using SAS (Statistical Analysis\n                                                \nFrom the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health,\nBethesda, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Maureen I.

Logistic regression\nwas performed using SUDAAN (Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC) to assess the relationship be-\ntween HbA1c\nand self-monitoring in those\ntreated with insulin, oral agents, or diet\nalone.\nRESULTS -- The median age of the pa-\nmale, 26% were of minority race or eth-\nnicity, 55% had a high school education\nhad a regular source of primary medical\ncare, and 85% had at least two physician\nvisits in the 12 months before the survey.\nvalues and\nthe frequency of blood glucose self-\nmonitoring, according to diabetes ther-\napy. One-fourth of patients treated with\ninsulin and most patients treated with\noral agents or diet alone had never moni-\ntored their blood glucose or monitored\nit less than once per month. Self-\nmonitoring at least once per day was prac-\nticed by 39% of those taking insulin and\nwas infrequent for those treated with oral\nagents or diet alone.\nIn Fig. 1, the patients are distributed\naccording to deciles of HbA1c\n. The per-\ncentage of patients in each decile who\nwere treated with insulin rises with in-\ncreasing HbA1c\nvalue. The percentage\ntreated with oral agents is relatively con-\nstant across deciles 3\u00ad10, and the per-\ncentage treated with diet alone declines\nmarkedly with increasing HbA1c\nvalue.\nThe frequency of self-monitoring by\npatients in each decile of the HbA1c\ndis-\ntribution is shown in Fig. 1. The propor-\ntion of patients who tested at least once\nper week or who tested at least once per\nday increased with increasing HbA1c\nvalue. Testing at least twice per day was\nuncommon and showed no relation to\nvalue.\nFigure 2 illustrates the frequency of\nself-monitoring by patients for those\ntreated with insulin, oral agents, or diet\nalone in each quintile of the HbA1c\ndistri-\nbution.

The proportion testing at\nleast twice per day was highest in the low-\nest quintile for those taking insulin (8% of\ninsulin-treated patients) and was low\nthroughout the spectrum of HbA1c\nfor\nthose taking oral agents or treated with\ndiet alone.\nLogistic regression models were con-\nstructed to further evaluate the associa-\ntion of self-monitoring and HbA1c\n. In\nthese models, there was no relationship\nbetween the frequency of self-monitoring\nlevel for those treated with in-\nsulin, oral agents, or diet alone (P  0.5).\nCONCLUSIONS -- The data for all\npatients combined indicate that self-\nmonitoring of blood glucose is more com-\nmon as HbA1c\nincreases, suggesting that\npatients with poorer glycemic control\nhave a greater tendency to self-monitor.\nHowever, the increase in frequency of\nself-monitoring with increasing HbA1c\nvalue is related to the higher proportion of\ninsulin-treated patients, who are more\nlikely to self-monitor, in higher HbA1c\ncategories. Within each diabetes therapy\ncategory there was little relationship be-\ntween the frequency of testing and HbA1c\nvalue. Indeed, half of patients with HbA1c\n8%, the ADA value at which intensifi-\ncation of glucose control is recommended\n(1), monitored less than once per week.\nPrior studies have shown that self-\nmonitoring is more common in Cauca-\nsian patients than in African-American or\nMexican-American patients (3,4). Those\nwith more education, those who have had\na diabetes patient education class, and\nthose who have frequent physician visits\nare more likely to practice self-monitoring\n(4). However, self-monitoring was not re-\nlated to higher income or to having health\ninsurance (4).\nThe relationship between HbA1c\nvalue and self-monitoring frequency was\ninvestigated in a study in England of 290\ntype 2 diabetic patients treated with insu-\nlin; no association was found (5). A study\nin Missouri of 61 type 2 diabetic patients\nwho self-monitored found no difference\nin mean GHb values based on the fre-\nquency of testing (6). Among 115 patients\ntreated with oral agents at a Veterans Ad-\nministration Medical Center in Arizona,\nglucose control was independent of the\nnumber of blood glucose test strips dis-\npensed (7). Some reports have questioned\nthe efficacy of self-monitoring in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes (8,9). In contrast, the\nimportance of self-monitoring in patients\nwith type 1 diabetes is more certain, and\nan increased frequency of self-monitoring\nis generally associated with decreased\nvalues for these patients (5,10).\nSelf-monitoring is considered to be a\ntool to guide patient and physician action\nwith respect to changes in diet, physical\nactivity, and use of antihyperglycemic\nmedication. Both patient and physician ac-\ntion are needed to change diabetes man-\nagement when hyperglycemia is evident.\nPatients with differing levels of insulin re-\nsistance and -cell reserve may respond\ndifferently to self-monitoring and changes\nin diabetes control regimens. The true im-\npact of self-monitoring could be assessed\nin a randomized clinical trial with pre-\nestablished guidelines for how glucose\nmonitoring results would be used to facil-\nitate achievement of glycemic targets.\nAdequate co-involvement of the med-\nical care team, the patient, and the family\nappears to be important in effective man-\nagement of diabetes. Clinical trials have\ndemonstrated that health care systems\nthat utilize nurses and other nonphysi-\ncian personnel as case managers and\nthose with telephone-based contact are\nefficacious in improving glycemic con-\ntrol, blood pressure, and lipid levels (11\u00ad\n14). Key elements in the success of the\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial\nwere the frequent clinic visits involving\nnurses and dietitians and the extensive\ntelephone access to these health care prac-\ntitioners. These elements were afforded to\npatients in the intensive intervention\ngroup, and HbA1c\nremained low through-\nout the study (15). Availability of social\nsupport, such as that provided by nurse\ncase-managers, appears to be a major\nfactor that contributes to adherence by\ndiabetic patients to such behaviors as fol-\nlowing a diabetic diet, weight loss, taking\nprescribed medications, checking blood\nglucose, and checking feet (16). In a lo-\ngistic regression analysis of the NHANES\nIII type 2 diabetic patients, the HbA1c\nlevel\nwas not significantly associated with having\na primary source of ambulatory medical\ncare, the number of physician visits per\nyear, having any type of health insurance,\nor having private insurance (17).\nThe NHANES III is a cross-sectional\nstudy, and it cannot be determined from\nthis study whether self-monitoring influ-\nenced blood glucose control. Further-\nmore, the study was conducted during\nthe period when Medicare reimbursed the\ncost of blood glucose monitors and test\nstrips for monitors only for patients\ntreated with insulin. Although self-testing\nof blood glucose does not require moni-\ntors, it is likely that the lower frequency of\ntesting by patients treated with oral agents\nand diet alone was a result, in part, of the\nlack of reimbursement. In 1998, this pol-\nFigure 2--Percentage of patients with type 2\ndiabetes in quintiles of the HbA1c\ndistribution\nwho self-monitor their blood glucose, accord-\ning to diabetes therapy.
