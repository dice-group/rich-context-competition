Compared with girls aged 12\u00ad17 years in highest-income households, lowest-income\nhousehold girls had higher prevalence of obesity (17.9 vs. 13.1%, P , 0.05), central obesity\n(14.1 vs. 5.9%, P , 0.01). Apart from higher prevalence of elevated non\u00adHDL-C among low-\nfactor prevalence differences were observed between lowest- and highest-income background\nyoung adults.\nCONCLUSIONS--Independent of race/ethnicity, 6- to 17-year-olds from low-income fam-\nilies have higher prevalence of obesity, central obesity, sedentary behavior, and tobacco expo-\nsure. Multifaceted cardiovascular health promotion policies are needed to reduce health\ndisparities between income groups.\nSocioeconomic position (SEP) is a\nmultidimensional construct, em-\nbodying prestige, relationships, op-\nportunities, and access to resources (1,2).\nIn adults, low SEP, measured as lower\neducation level, self-reported economic\ndifficulties, or impoverished locality,\nstrongly predicts increased cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) risk factors, CVD events,\nand mortality (3). Increased adult CVD\nrisk is also related to adverse early life cir-\ncumstances, independent of adult SEP\n(2). This relationship may be mediated\nby early onset of risk factors that track\ninto adulthood and accelerate progres-\nsion of atherosclerosis (4,5). However,\nevidence of the relationship between\nchildhood SEP and CVD risks in early\nlife is limited, inconsistent, and suggests\nvariation by sex and age (6,7).\nIn the U.S., CVD risk factors are in-\ncreasingly common in youth, exhibit racial/\nethnic variation, and have been attributed\nto a myriad of interconnected factors\n(genetic influences, birth weight, paren-\ntal BMI, nutrient quantity and quality,\nand activity levels) (8,9). Among U.S.\nchildren and adolescents, socioeconomic\ndisadvantage is common, varies by race/\nethnicity, and persists into young adult-\nhood (10). Therefore, examining the\ncontribution of SEP to emergence of early\ncardiometabolic risk may provide insights\ninto origins of socioeconomic disparities\nin CVD risk and has implications for\nsocietal action and policies aimed at pre-\nventing and controlling health and eco-\nnomic burdens across the life course.\nFurthermore, identifying and evaluating\nspecific, modifiable exposure-outcome as-\nsociations and the strength of these rela-\ntionships may help guide the design of\nappropriate interventions.\nWe used recent nationally representa-\ntive data to determine whether SEP is as-\nsociated with prevalence of common CVD\nrisk factors in U.S. youth, independent\nof related sociodemographic covariates\n(race/ethnicity, age, and sex).\nMETHODS--We analyzed data from\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\nlected by the National Center for Health\nStatistics at the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention.

The average of three brachial ar-\ntery BP readings (taken by physicians after\n5 min in a rested sitting position) (11) was\nused for analysis.\nElevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c\n)\nwas\nmeasured in participants aged $12 years\nfrom whole blood using Diamat HPLC\n(high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy; BioRad Laboratories, Columbia, MO\nG7 HPLC Glyco-\nhemoglobin Analyzer (Tosoh Medics,\nsays were standardized to reference meth-\nods from the Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial (12).\nElevated non-HDL cholesterol (non\u00ad\nHDL-C) was calculated as total cholesterol\nmg/dL) equivalent to adult LDL $3.37\nmmol/L (130 mg/dL) were considered ele-\nvated (17). In all participants, total choles-\nterol and HDL-C were measured using\nRoche/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics\nmethods.\nElevated high sensitivity C-reactive\nprotein (hs-CRP) was defined as $10.0\nmg/L (1.0 mg/dL), which corresponds to\n75th percentile in published data and in-\ntermediate CVD risk in adults (18).

Serum hs-CRP was estimated\nin all participants using latex-enhanced\nnephelometry.\nAmong participants aged 8\u00ad24 years,\nwe calculated the proportion with 1, 2, or\n$3 of the following risk factors: central\nobesity, elevated sBP, elevated hs-CRP,\nhigh non\u00adHDL-C, and tobacco exposure.\nData for HbA1c\nand sedentary behavior\nwere not available for children ,12 years.\nPrincipal exposure variable\nHousehold income is a dynamic, poten-\ntially modifiable indicator of SEP, reflect-\ning current material resources (2). We\nused poverty-income ratio (PIR), an index\nof income in relation to family need, de-\nrived from household income and feder-\nally established poverty thresholds (based\non family size and annual changes in cost\nof living [tracking Consumer Price Index])\n(19).

We used multiple imputa-\ntion to account for missing income data\n(n = 1,235). Income was selected for im-\nputation because it had the highest rate of\nmissing cases; missing data on CVD risk\nfactors (range: 0\u00ad16% missing; average:\n7.3% missing per outcome) were not im-\nputed since these outcomes are less pre-\ndictable. Missing income and PIR were\npredicted based on race/ethnicity, house-\nhold size, and household reference per-\nson's age and sex. Ten imputed datasets\nwere created and imputations were com-\nbined. In addition, we performed sensi-\ntivity analyses isolating participants with\nmissing PIR data in a separate category to\nidentify whether CVD risk profiles in this\ngroup deviated markedly from partici-\npants without missing data.\nFollowing descriptive explorations\nof population characteristics, sex-specific\nlogistic regression models controlling for\ncovariates were used to investigate the\nmain effects of PIR on CVD risk. We in-\ncludedall first-order interactions andtested\ntheir significance using design-adjusted\nWald F tests to examine whether SEP-\nCVD relationship(s) varied by other inde-\npendent variables (age and race/ethnicity).\nTo estimate the proportion of partic-\nipants with each CVD risk factor in each\nPIR tertile, sex- and age-specific predicted\nmarginal probabilities (a type of standard-\nization in which predicted values from\nregression models are averaged over the\nentire sample's covariate distribution)\nand 95% CIs were estimated. We tested\nwhether risk factor differences between\nPIR groups were significant using Wald\nF tests.\nWe also used multinomial logistic\nregression to calculate the proportion of\nparticipants with 1, 2, or $3 risk factors\nby PIR tertile and tested for between-\ntertile differences and age-PIR interaction\nin youth with $3 risk factors.\nAll tests were two-sided.

This study's findings\nadd to existing literature that shows house-\nhold socioeconomic circumstances (20)\nand access (to material, information, social,\nand environmental resources) affect health\noutcomes through shaping health-related\nawareness and behaviors (dietary prefer-\nences, activity levels, and tobacco use) (21).\nIn our data, socioeconomic disparities\nin behavioral-environmental risk factors\nTable 1--Sociodemographic profile of U.S. NHWs, NHBs, and MAs aged 6\u00ad24 years,\nn Population size* Weighted %\nAge (%)\nSex (%)\nEthnicity/Race (%)\nHousehold size (%)\nHousehold income (%)\nPoverty level (%)\n*In millions. Missing values for income group (n = 972) and poverty level (n = 1,235) were estimated using\nmultiple imputation.\nCardiovascular risks in youth across income groups\n(physical inactivity and tobacco exposure)\nwere similar in both sexes and more\nstrongly evident among adolescents but\nnot young adults. This may be related to\nsimilarly high prevalence of behavioral\nand anthropometric risks across all in-\ncome tertiles in young adults. For exam-\nple, we observed large differences between\nSEP strata in the prevalence of central\nobesity in boys and tobacco exposure in\nboth sexes, among the youngest age-\ngroups, which tended to diminish with\nage. This highlights how age-related tran-\nsitions and social context adjustments\n(e.g., adoption of detrimental health be-\nhaviors in response to different psycho-\nsocial, environmental [school, college, and\nearly career], or socioeconomic stressors)\nmay contribute to behavioral and anthro-\npometric changes.\nOur data further highlight that the\npathways mediating SEP influences on\nrisk factor emergence are nonlinear and\ncomplex (22). The sociodemographic and\neconomic exposures that cumulatively\nIn particular, socioeconomic disparities\nin the U.S. mirror race/ethnicity differ-\nences with worse CVD risk profiles noted\namong minority race/ethnicity youth\n(8,23). In analyses accounting for PIR\n(Table 2), we found NHB and MA youth\nexhibited significantly higher odds of\nobesity, central obesity, sedentary behav-\nior, elevated sBP, elevated non\u00adHDL-C,\nand elevated HbA1c\nbut also lower likeli-\nhood of tobacco exposure--these patterns\nNHANES estimates (8). Also, in keeping\nwith previous estimates, lowest PIR group\nyouth of all races/ethnicities were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be sedentary and ex-\nposed to tobacco. These findings identify\nspecific behavioral risks among youth that\ncan be targeted with health promotion\nstrategies and highlight that poverty is as-\nsociated with health risks among all race/\nethnic groups.\nThese analyses are, however, cross-\nsectional. Thus, temporal and causal in-\nferences are limited, as are estimations of\npopulation-level cardiovascular benefits\nfrom alleviating poverty in lowest PIR\ntertiles. We transparently used sophisti-\ncated imputation and sensitivity analyses\nto address limitations of missing income\ndata; sensitivity analyses treating missing\nPIR data as a separate category showed\nCVD risk factor prevalence estimates in\nthis group were no different from those\nin referent highest PIR tertile.

Also, although PIR is a robust indi-\ncator of current resources, we recognize\nthat this national-level threshold cannot\naccount for regional cost-of-living differ-\nences and does not comprehensively rep-\nresent the multiple domains of SEP, each\nof which provides a unique lens on how\ndisadvantage affects health. The limited\nnumber of per-survey observations pre-\ncluded examination of CVD risk profile\ntrends over time. Lastly, we focused on\noverarching SEP-CVD risk relationships\nand could not account for individual var-\niability in growth, maternal and paternal\nBMI, and intrauterine exposures.\nThis study's strengths are the fol-\nlowing: large, nationally representative,\nhigh-response rate sample; use of objec-\ntive outcome measures; exposure (PIR)\nthat integrates variations in household\nneed and purchasing power over time;\ndesign-adjusted statistical methods; and\nstratification by age and sex to account\nfor pubertal changes and/or socially pat-\nterned differences between sexes.\nImplications\nThese findings showing greater prepon-\nderance of behavioral CVD risks among\nyouths from lowest-income households\nprovide two important inferences. First,\nviewed in the context of established trends,\nthese data forewarn of recurring health\nand economic burdens. Second, this study\noffers insights into meaningful avenues\nfor intervention, reinforcing that poor SEP\nhinders achievement of positive lifestyle\nchoices. These implications are discussed\nseparately.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau (19) estimates\nthose ,18 years lived below the federal\npoverty level (for a family of four, annual\nduring the past 4 decades (10). Since the\nprevious national-level reported data (8)\ncollected 2 decades ago, our findings\nshow persistent socioeconomic and health\ndisparities among U.S. youth.\nEarly life socioeconomic conditions in-\ndirectly affect life course (adult SEP and\nhealth risks) (24) plus foretell low SEP\nover ensuing generations. Early life oppor-\ntunities (e.g., education) shape future\noccupation, income, parity, personal (self-\nesteem and resilience) and social capital\n(relationships and networks), and invest-\nments in opportunities for the next gener-\nation (1). Moreover, metabolic, vascular,\nand orthopedic consequences associated\nwith CVD risk cumulatively translate\ninto high health care costs and potentially\nless productive life years, further reducing\nprospects of escaping low SEP.\nHealth-related behaviors are estab-\nlished early, and CVD risks persist into\nadulthood (25). Sedentary behaviors and\ntobacco exposure were common among\nadolescents but ominously twofold higher\namong young adults, suggesting that ear-\nlier intervention may circumvent future\nburdens. Also, national youth surveil-\nlance shows that previous declines in to-\nbacco use are leveling off and positive\nweight-related behaviors have both been\ndeclining, emphasizing the need to reener-\ngize prevention and promotion programs.\nHowever, the complexity of constraints\nfaced by disadvantaged groups necessitate\nthat CVD prevention policies address\nmultiple levels (8,23). For example, since\npoverty contributes to low awareness of\nhealth risks, food insecurity, and restricted\nchoice (21), regulations targeting price and\ncontent of foods and beverages are less\nmeaningful without greater affordability\nof healthy alternatives. In a similar manner,\nneighborhood planning and safety are\nrequisites for promoting physical activity.\nLastly, to achieve population-level benefits,\nhealth promotion programs must reach\nlow-income minority populations.\nThis study reports the most recent\nyouth CVD risk factor distributions across\nSEP strata and isolates relationships be-\ntween income disparities and health be-\nhaviors. These results are hypothesis\ngenerating--to reduce health and socio-\ndemographic disparities nationally, policies\nthat attenuate the effects of socioeconomic\nstressors must be judiciously tested to\nevaluate if they enhance the effectiveness\nof health promotion strategies. Finally,\nsince our data predate the current economic\nFigure 1--Predicted prevalence (%) of multiple risk factors for U.S. male (A) and female (B) NHWs, NHBs, and MAs aged 8\u00ad24 years by PIR\ntertile (T) and age-group. *P , 0.05 for difference between T1 and T3 in having at least three risk factors (out of: central obesity, systolic\nhypertension, elevated hs-CRP, high non\u00adHDL-C, and tobacco exposure).
