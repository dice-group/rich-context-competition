Previous work investigated potential risks between Taq I (rs731236) and Bsm I\n(rs1544410) VDR polymorphisms with prostate cancer in humans; however, results are inconsistent.\nMethods: We conducted a meta-analysis to retrieve genetic association analyses of rs731236 and\nPooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess genetic associations, and\nheterogeneity was assessed by Q and I2statistics.\nResults: Our findings suggest a significant association between rs731236 and prostate cancer risk\nin Asians and African Americans, but rs1544410 was not associated with prostate cancer under\nthree genetic models.\nConclusion: Future studies including larger sample sizes and the analysis of gene functions are\nneeded to help develop prostate cancer treatment.\n",

Clinical studies showed that the inci-\ndence of prostate cancer increases with age,\nwith a high incidence of disease concen-\ntrated in individuals 70\u00ad80 years of age.\nHowever, patients with familial hereditary\nprostate cancer are usually less than 50 years\nold.2 An increased disease incidence is also\nrelated to frequent sexual activity, a high-fat\ndiet,3 race, and regional location.\nMolecular biology and epidemiological\nstudies results suggest that the pathogenesis\nof prostate cancer may be associated with\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\nseveral genes.4\u00ad8 For example, polymorph-\nisms of the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR)\nare closely associated with prostate cancer.\nVDR is located on human chromosome 12\nand encodes the nuclear hormone receptor\nfor vitamin D3.9,10 VDR is a ligand-depen-\ndent nuclear transcription factor, which\nplays an important role in maintaining\ncalcium metabolism, and regulating cell\nproliferation and differentiation.11 Several\nSNPs have been identified in VDR that\nappear to influence the risk of cancer and\nother disease,12,13 including bone mineral\ndensity, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoma-\nlasia.14\u00ad16 In normal and malignant prostate\ncells, VDR expression mediates the bio-\npolymorphisms in different regions of VDR\ncause different effects. The Bsm I\nVDR; this polymorphism does not affect the\namino acid sequence of VDR, but many\nstudies have suggested that it is closely\nrelated to prostate cancer risk.20\u00ad23 The\nonymous mutation located in VDR exon 9,\nwhich is also associated with prostate cancer\nSeveral studies have investigated the\ncancer worldwide. However, the results are\ninconsistent.30\u00ad32 Therefore, we conducted a\nnew meta-analysis to assess the effect of\nthese two SNPs on the risk of prostate\ncancer.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy and data extraction\nWe carried out a search of the literature to\nretrieve association analyses of Taq I\nmorphisms with prostate cancer published\nSpringer, and ScienceDirect databases using\nciation analysis'. For data extraction, we\npaid attention to the publication time, coun-\ntry of publication, population information,\ngenetic models used, case and control\nsample size, and polymorphism genotype\nand allele frequencies.\nStatistical analysis and meta-analysis\nWe detected allele frequencies by Hardy\u00ad\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) using\nthe 2 test. Ideally, allele frequencies\nwere stable and unchanged (P > 0.05).\nHeterogeneity was tested for using Q\nand I2 statistics, with P < 0.05 indicating\nsignificant difference. In the absence of\nheterogeneity, the fixed-effects model was\nused to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of\neach study; otherwise the random-effects\nmodel was used.

These negative\nassociation results could be explained by\nour method of identifying studies from the\nliterature, or could reflect the fact that we did\nnot analyse other prostate cancer risk factors\nFigure 1.

Larger investigations should there-\nfore be conducted together with molecular\nfunction studies of susceptibility genes\nand loci.
