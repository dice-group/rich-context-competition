However, while a structured cutoff hierarchy has been established for BMI, a rigorous analysis to define\nindividuals as obese using the WHtR has not been performed on a sample of American adults. This study attempts\nto establish a cutoff for the WHtR using metabolic syndrome as the outcome.\nMethods: The study sample consisted of individuals that were part of the National Longitudinal Study of\nfemales) that were complete respondents for the variables of interest at Wave IV. The participants ranged from\n24.55-33.60 years. Weighted and unweighted receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed\npredicting metabolic syndrome from the WHtR. Cutoffs were chosen using the Youden index. The derived cutoffs\nwere validated by logistic regression analysis on the Add Health participants and an external sample of 1 236\nparticipants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nResults: The ROC analysis resulted in a WHtR cutoff of 0.578 (Youden Index = 0.50) for the full sample of complete\nsample with a WHtR greater than the derived cutoff were more likely (Odds Ratio = 9.8, 95 % CI (6.2, 15.3)) to have\nmetabolic syndrome than those that were not.\nConclusion: A WHtR cutoff of 0.580 is optimal for discriminating individuals with metabolic syndrome in two\nnationally representative samples of young adults. This cutoff is an improvement over a previously recommended\ncutoff of 0.5 as well as other cutoffs derived from international samples.\n",

McQueen3\n Keywords: Waist-to-height ratio, Cutoff, Obesity, Epidemiology, Metabolic syndrome\nBackground\nObesity is an increasing worldwide problem and known\nrisk factor for the development of several chronic diseases\n[1, 2]. BMI has traditionally been used as an indicator of\nweight status and cardiometabolic risks associated with\nbeing overweight. However, despite being widely utilized\nas the default for determining weight status, evidence sug-\ngests an inconsistent ability of the BMI to predict disease\nrisk. Several studies have shown individuals that were\noverweight or obese based off of BMI cutoffs were actually\nat reduced mortality compared with normal weight indi-\nviduals, while only those that were severely obese or\nunderweight were at an increased risk [3\u00ad5].\nFor these reasons, alternative measures of weight status\nthat take the distribution of body mass into consideration\ncould be superior diagnostic measures for identifying car-\ndiovascular and metabolic disease risk. One of these mea-\nsures is the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), which has been\nshown to outperform BMI and waist circumference (WC)\n* Correspondence: Adam.Bohr@Colorado.edu\nUSA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2016 Bohr et al.

An international cutoff of 0.5\nhas been proposed in the past [6, 7]. In addition, cutoffs\nhave been established in Asian populations. For example,\na study of Beijing adults established WHtR cutoffs of\n[8]. Another study conducted in China suggested cutoffs\nHowever, it has been shown that WHtR may discrimin-\nate differently in Asian versus non-Asian populations,\nand rigorous analysis has not been performed to estab-\nlish a cutoff that can be applied to obesity research for\npopulations in the United States [10].\nThe primary objective of this study was to establish\nsuch a cutoff using a sample of Wave IV participants\nfrom National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health). In addition, we tested the validity of the\nderived cutoff using another sample of young adults\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES). The results of this study could be\nused in future Add Health studies to aid in analyses\nwhen the WHtR is the outcome variable. In addition, it\ncould be used as a metric in other studies using young\nadults in the United States when obesity or risk of obes-\nity is an outcome of interest.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe study utilized a sample of individuals from Add\nHealth [11]. Add Health is a longitudinal study that\ninvestigates how social and environmental factors may\ninfluence health and has followed a cohort of individuals\nthrough four waves of interviewing and testing since its\nstudy utilized variables from Wave IV testing. The full\nAdd Health study consisted of 20 792 participants. Add\nHealth participants provided written informed consent\nfor participation in all aspects of Add Health in accord-\nance with the University of North Carolina School of\nPublic Health Institutional Review Board guidelines.\nThe initial subsample of this population consisted of\nindividuals that were part of blood glucose homeostasis\nmeasurements (n = 15 701). Additionally, the packages\nused for analyses in the current study required complete\ninformation for all variables used, and a substantial\namount of the respondents had missing data for some of\nthe Wave IV measurements and variables. Any respond-\nent that did not have complete information for all of the\nvariables used was not part of the final analysis. The\nfinal sample for analyses consisted of 7 935 participants.\nFor purpose of comparison, descriptive statistics are pre-\nsented for both this sample as well as the respondents\nthat were removed in Table 1.\nRace, sex, age, and smoking variables\nRacial classification used the variable \"AH_RACE\" and\ncombined the groups \"nonHispanic Asian\" and \"nonHis-\npanic Native American\" due to sparsely populated cells\nfor those groups. Race was treated as a factor, comparing\n\"nonHispanic African Americans\", \"nonHispanic Asian/\nNative American\", and \"Hispanic\" to the referent cat-\negory, \"nonHispanic Caucasian.\" Age was measured con-\ntinuously in years. Average age of the participants at\nin the amount of days smoked in the last month [11].\nSex was dichotomous with males coded as \"1\" and\nfemales coded as \"2.\" The names of the source variables\nused can be found in Additional file 1: Table S1.\nCardiometabolic outcomes\nFor description of the collection of cardiometabolic mea-\nsurements in Add Health, please refer to the supplemen-\ntary information to this manuscript (Additional file 2:\nSupplementary Information).\nWhen possible, the National Cholesterol Education\nAdult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) diagnostic\ncriteria for metabolic syndrome were used for classifica-\ntion purposes [12, 13]. Individuals are considered to\nhave metabolic syndrome if three or more of five risk\nfactors are present. These include high waist circumfer-\nence, high blood pressure, high fasting blood glucose,\nhigh triglyceride (TG), and low HDL [12, 13]. The\nNCEP/ATP III criteria were applied for determination of\nboth high waist circumference (men: > 102 cm, women: >\ndue to the issues related to fasting time for blood glucose\nmeasurements and the fact that only deciles were released\nfor lipid measurements, other constructs for risk in these\nareas were used.\nIn place of fasting blood glucose, glycolated hemoglobin\n) was used as a measure of glycemic homeostasis.\nIndividuals with HbA1C\n> 5.7 % were classified as pre-\ndiabetic or diabetic, which roughly corresponds to fasting\nblood glucose of  100 mg/dl [14]. Because no absolute\nmeasures for TG or HDL were released, decile ranks were\nused to classify individuals for these two risk factors. Pre-\nold males and females, respectively. The same study re-\nfore, males that were in the top three deciles and females\nthat were in the top two deciles for TG were classified has\nhaving this risk factor. Males that were in the bottom two\ndeciles and females that were in the bottom three deciles\nfor HDL were classified as having this risk factor.\nIndividuals that had three or more of the risk factors\nwere classified as having metabolic syndrome, resulting\nin an overall prevalence of 23.35 % of individuals that\nwere part of the final cutoff analysis. The sex specific\nfemales. These are slightly higher than those reported in\nHeight (cm) and waist circumference (cm) were ex-\ntracted from the Add Health Wave 4 anthropometric\nmeasurements. Waist circumference was measured to\nthe nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border of the iliac\ncrest. The WHtR metric was calculated by dividing waist\ncircumference by height.\nROC analysis: unweighted\nDue to limitations of the statistical software package used\nto identify cutoffs, we initially conducted unweighted\nROC analysis which did not account for sampling weights,\nstrata, or clusters. Analysis using metabolic syndrome as\nthe classification variable and WHtR as the continuous\npredictor variable was performed to determine the appro-\npriate WHtR cutoff. Both sex specific and full sample ana-\nlyses were performed. The optimal cutoffs in this study\nwere determined by the Youden Index, which is defined as\nSensitivity + Specificity - 1 [15]. All analyses and calcula-\ntions were done using R version 2.15.3 via the RStudio\nROC analysis: weighted\nWe also conducted weighted ROC analysis, which\naccounted for sampling weights, strata, and clustering.\nAdd Health employs a multi-stage, stratified, and clustered\nsampling strategy. In addition, certain racial, ethnic, and\nsocioeconomic groups were intentionally over-sampled\n[18]. In order to account for the weights, strata, and\nclusters, the R package \"Survey\" was used to create a\nstudy design value that could be applied to different\ntypes of analysis [19].\nCount % Count %\nSex\nRace\nSmoking\nMetabolic Outcomes\nMean SE Mean SE P Value\nSE (Standard Error)\nTo conduct the weighted ROC analysis, \"Survey\" was\nused to generate weighted contingency tables that ac-\ncount for weights, strata, and clustering variables. Step 1\ninvolved creating potential cutoffs for the WHtR from\n0.5-0.6 at a resolution of every hundredth. Step 2 involved\ngenerating contingency tables for these cutoffs and pres-\nence of metabolic syndrome, and step 3 involved calculat-\ning the sensitivity and specificity of each potential cutoff.\nFor both the full and male only samples, the Youden Index\nincreased until 0.57 and then began to decrease. Cutoffs\nevery thousandth, and steps 2 and 3 of the analysis were\nrepeated. For females, the Youden Index increased until\n0.59 and then decreased. Cutoffs were created ranging\nand steps 2 and 3 of the analysis were repeated.\n\"Survey\" was also used to calculate the area under the\ncurve (AUC) for the optimal cutoffs by generating logistic\nregression models to predict metabolic syndrome from\nthe derived cutoffs. Concordance was then calculated\nfrom these models to determine the AUC.\nLogistic regression model\nSeparate analysis was performed to test the derived cutoffs\nwhile controlling for confounding factors. Indicator vari-\nables were created for whether or not an individual was\nabove the WHtR cutoff identified in the ROC analysis.\nWeighted and unweighted logistic regression models were\nconstructed for the full sample, males only, and females\nonly. These models predicted presence of metabolic\nsyndrome from the WHtR cutoff indicator, race, sex,\nage, and smoking.\nExternal validation\nFinally, the derived cutoffs were tested using an external\n2008 collection periods. Analysis was restricted to\ncomplete respondents for the variables of interest and to\nindividuals aged 25-35 years for comparison with the\nAdd Health participants. This resulted in a sample of 1\n236 respondents. A construct for metabolic syndrome\nwas created, and the following contingency tables were\ngenerated predicting metabolic syndrome from the de-\nrived cutoffs: Unweighted, full sample, WHtR > 0.580;\nUnweighted, males only, WHtR > 0.578; Unweighted,\nfemales only, WHtR > 0.580; Weighted, full sample,\nWHtR > 0.580. Finally, logistic regression analysis was\nused to test the cutoff's ability to predict metabolic syn-\ndrome while controlling for race, age, sex, and smoking\nstatus. A complete description of the variables (Additional\nfile 3) used as well as descriptive statistics (Additional\nfile 4) for this sample can be found in the supple-\nmentary information to this manuscript.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for the sample of complete respon-\ndents as well as the respondents that were removed can\nbe found in Table 1. P values from independent tests of\nproportions and means are displayed to test for system-\natic differences between the complete respondents and\nthe incomplete respondents. The two samples differed in\nthe demographic categories, with the most pronounced\ndifferences between males and females (P < 0.0001),\n\"nonHispanic Caucasian\" and \"nonHispanic African\nAmerican\" racial categories (P < 0.0001), and age (P <\n0.0001). However, they did not differ on smoking status\n(P = 0.997) and all but one of the metabolic outcomes\n(Waist Circumference, P < 0.0001). Prevalence of meta-\nbolic syndrome was not significantly different (P = 0.534)\nbetween complete respondents and incomplete respon-\ndents. Finally, the samples did not differ in measures of\nweight status or weight distribution (BMI: P = 0.165,\nThe results of the unweighted ROC analysis are pre-\nsented in Table 2. In addition to sensitivity and specifi-\ncity, point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for\npositive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value\n(NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likeli-\nhood ratio (NLR), and odds ratios (OR) were calculated.\nPPV is the probability that a person that tests positive\nfor the disease outcome is an actual case, while NPV is\nthe probability that a person that tests negative for the\ndisease outcome is not a case. PLR and NLR are mea-\nsures of how much a test result will change the odds of\nhaving a disease or not having a disease. The ROC plots\nfor this analysis are presented in Fig. 1.\nThe ROC analysis resulted in a WHtR cutoff of 0.578\n(Youden Index = 0.50) for the full sample of complete\n0.818)) for females only.

Each WHtR\ncutoff was a highly significant predictor (P < 0.0001)\nwith the inclusion of constructs for race, smoking,\nage, and sex.\nValidation results\nThe full results of the validation analyses are presented\nin the supplementary information (Additional file 5:\nTable S4 and Additional file 6: Table S5) to this manu-\nscript. The overall cutoff of 0.580 resulted in a Youden\nweighted analysis. In addition, the derived cutoffs were\nhighly significant predictors of metabolic syndrome in\nthe weighted and unweighted full sample logistic regres-\nsion models as well as the unweighted sex-specific logis-\ntic regression models.\nDiscussion\nRecent research has established WHtR as a more useful\ndiagnostic measure for overweight than BMI. This could\nbe due in part to the fact that BMI does not take lean\nmass or the distribution of body weight into consider-\nation. Fat distribution is known to factor greatly into risk\nof cardiovascular disease and early death, as visceral fat\nis more metabolically active and associated with greater\nsystemic inflammation when compared with subcutane-\nous adipose tissue [20, 21]. As such, visceral adiposity is\nmore causally related to insulin resistance, hypertension,\nAdd Health is an ideal sample and study design to\nconduct cutoff research and has several features that en-\nhance the validity as well as the utility of our findings.\nFirst, WHtR, as well as all of the metabolic outcomes,\nwere measured in the field by trained technicians rather\nthan self-reported. In addition, the design of the Add\nHealth study allows for opportunity to make true popu-\nlation inferences as it is a nationally representative study\nwith variables in place to account for complex sampling\nstrategy. Finally, Add Health is a longitudinal study with\nseveral waves of data collection and includes a vast array\nof associational parameters for body composition and\nweight distribution. The richness of this data may allow\nresearchers to observe how the cutoff may change as the\nsample ages in addition to how behavioral, genetic, and\nsociodemographic factors may impact risk of being over-\nweight as defined by WHtR.\nWe opted to use metabolic syndrome as our disease\noutcome as it incorporates a host of cardiovascular out-\ncomes that are linked to mortality. The prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome that we observed in men (28.2 %)\nand women (19.6 %) was slightly higher than had been\nold males and females, respectively, while Ford et al.\nmales and females, respectively. Waist circumference\nwas by far the largest source of the difference observed,\nas our sample had a prevalence of abdominal obesity of\nBoth of these were significantly higher than reported by\nErvin et al. (32 % and 49.8 % in males and females,\nrespectively).\nAnother element of our sample worth commenting on\nis whether or not there were significant differences\nbetween the individuals that were complete respondents\nfor the variables we were observing and those that were\nnot included in our analysis. It is possible that selection\nbias could have occurred if there were systematic differ-\nences between individuals that were complete respon-\ndents, which would make our results less generalizable.\nTable 2 Unweighted ROC Analysis Predicting Metabolic Syndrome from Waist-to-Height Ratio: Add health Study 1994-2008\n(95 % Confidence Interval) PPV (Positive Predictive Value) NPV (Negative Predictive Value) PLR (Positive Likelihood Ratio) NLR (Negative Likelihood Ratio)\nThe individuals that were selected had significantly\nhigher occurrence of high waist adiposity. In addition,\nthere were racial and sex differences between the groups,\nwith the final sample having fewer males and \"nonHispa-\nnic African Americans\" and more \"nonHispanic Cauca-\nsians\" than the sample of participants that were not\nselected. However, none of the other metabolic outcomes\ndiffered between the two samples and there were no dif-\nferences between WHtR and BMI of the participants. In\naddition, our decision to conduct sex specific and full\nsample analyses reduces the chance that differences in\nproportion of males and females could affect the final ana-\nlyses. Finally, we tested the cutoffs established while con-\ntrolling for race, and these cutoffs stayed highly significant\nin all analysis.\nPrevious research had suggested a potential inter-\nnational cutoff of 0.5. However, investigation of the Add\nHealth sample indicates that this may not be appropri-\nate. This cutoff is significantly below both the median\nple and would classify the vast majority of the sample as\noverweight. If used to predict metabolic syndrome, this\nFig. 1 ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristics). AUC (Area Under the Curve)\ncutoff performs relatively poorly (Sensitivity: 0.97, 95 %\ncompared to the cutoffs we've established.\nWe performed both analysis that accounted for sampling\nstrategy (ie. weights, strata, and cluster) and analysis that\ndid not. There were slight differences in the resulting cut-\noffs between the weighted analysis and the unweighted ana-\nlysis, though none of the diagnostic measurements differed\nbetween the two sets of analysis. The weighted analysis re-\nwhile the unweighted analysis resulted in cutoffs of 0.578\nand 0.580 for males and females. The difference in cutoffs\nfor females was somewhat concerning. However, there was\nwould indicate that cutoffs in this range would have\nroughly the same diagnostic capability.\nGiven that two different sets of analyses were per-\nformed, and that sex-specific cutoffs have been proposed\nin the past, we feel that it is appropriate to recommend\nweight. However, considering that there were only\nslight differences between the results of the weighted\nand unweighted analysis, as well as the similar diagnostic\ncapabilities within a narrow range of cutoffs, we also feel\nthat it is appropriate to additionally report a single, overall\nUnweighted Full Sample Females Only Males Only\nOR P Value OR P Value OR P Value\nNonHispanic Caucasian Ref Ref Ref Ref Ref Ref\nWeighted Full Sample Females Only Males Only\nOR P Value OR P Value OR P Value\nNonHispanic Caucasian Ref Ref Ref Ref Ref Ref\n(95 % Confidence Intervals) OR (Odds Ratio)\nTable 3 Weighted ROC Analysis Predicting Metabolic Syndrome from Waist-to-Height Ratio: Add health Study 1994-2008\n(95 % Confidence Interval) PPV (Positive Predictive Value) NPV (Negative Predictive Value) PLR (Positive Likelihood Ratio) NLR (Negative Likelihood Ratio)\nThe results of the logistic regression support the use\nof these cutoffs and also show their physiologic signifi-\ncance. The cutoffs remained highly significant predictors\nin all analyses even with the inclusion of race, sex, smok-\ning status, and age. Additionally, the odds of metabolic\nsyndrome increased drastically if an individual was above\nthe cutoff. Males above the cutoff of 0.578 were greater\nthan eleven times more likely to have metabolic syn-\ndrome than males that were not, while females that were\nabove the cutoff of 0.580 were greater than twelve times\nmore likely to have metabolic syndrome than females\nthat were not. These results were similar in the weighted\nand unweighted analysis.\nLimitations\nThe primary limitation of the current study was the lack\nof absolute measures for HDL and TG. This prevented\nus from applying the NCEP/ATP III criteria for classifica-\ntion of metabolic syndrome. Several other studies that use\nmetabolic syndrome apply the NCEP/ATP III criteria, so\nour inability to do so impairs the comparability of our\nresults with other studies.\nWe were also limited in how we classified resondents\nas having high blood glucose. The lack of control over\nthe fasting time of the participants made the results of\nthe blood glucose less reliable. We were, however, able\nto use HbA1C\nas an indicator of glucose status. While\nis the gold standard for glycemic homeostasis, it\ntoo deviates from the ATP III criteria and therefore\nlimits our comparability with other studies.\nIn addition, while the logistic regression models in-\ncluded controls for race, sex, age, and smoking; they did\nnot include other common confounding factors such as\nphysical activity or socioeconomic status of the partici-\npants. As the primary purpose of these models was val-\nidation of the cutoffs and not variability explanation in\nmetabolic syndrome, we felt it was appropriate to be\nparsimonious in covariate inclusion. Finally, we feel that\nthe strength of the association, both statistically and\nphysiologically, between the WHtR and metabolic syn-\ndrome is such that it is unlikely additional covariates\nwould completely diminish the relationship.\nThe paper is limited by the cross-sectional nature of\nthe data and study design. While Add Health itself is a\nlongitudinal study, we utilized only data from Wave IV.\nThis prevents us from drawing a causal relationship\nbetween the WHtR cutoff and metabolic syndrome.\nFinally, a significant amount of the sample (7 776 re-\nspondents) was lost due to missingness of any one of the\nmeasures of interest. In addition, the final sample differed\nfrom removed respondents in racial and gender make-up.\nThis impairs the ability of our findings to generalize to this\nparticular population and introduces the potential for\nsampling bias. However, we feel that our use of sampling\nweights, strata, and cluster variables in analysis attenuates\nsome of these issues. Finally, it is our contention that\nthough there is likely some degree of sampling bias\npresent, due to the fact that there were no differences\nbetween complete and incomplete respondents for the\nprimary variables of interest (WHtR and metabolic syn-\ndrome) it is unlikely that the results are unreliable.\nConclusion\nBased on both weighted and unweighted analyses, we\ncutoff of 0.58. These cutoffs can be used in prospective\nAdd Health studies that use the WHtR as a predictor or\noutcome and provide a measure of the physiologic sig-\nnificance of differences in the WHtR. As the prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome has been shown to increase with\nage, future studies are warranted to determine age ap-\npropriate cutoffs. In addition, a more hierarchical cutoff\nstructure similar to that of BMI could be developed. Our\ncutoff identified individuals that had metabolic syn-\ndrome, but cutoffs could be developed to identify those\nat low risk, moderate risk, and high risk. Finally, the\nAdd Health study provides a unique opportunity to\nfollow the cohort prospectively, which will allow us to\nobserve the disease histories of individuals that are\nabove or below these cutoffs.\nData availability statement\nAll data used in this study is publicly available at the\nAdd Health website: www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information is available at BMC Public\nHealth's website.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
