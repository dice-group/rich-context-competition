The prevalence of asthma has been\nrising steadily over the past few decades, particularly\namong children (3). A variety of sociodemographic, health,\nand health behaviors have been implicated as risk factors\nfor asthma, including income, race, family structure, resi-\ndence, and smoking (4\u00ad11). Estimates of the risk associated\nwith each of those predictors vary in both size and statisti-\ncal significance, in part because some studies rely on par-\nents' retrospective reports of health conditions (1, 5, 6,\n8\u00ad10), while others are based on medical records or on clin-\nical examination at the time of the study (7, 11). Maternal\nreports may suffer from recall bias as well as the fact that\nfew parents have been trained in how to diagnose asthma or\nto differentiate it from other respiratory conditions.\nMedical records data overcome those drawbacks but typi-\ncally are available only for children who use a particular\nhealth care provider. Hence, they cannot be used to gener-\nalize about patterns of health or health care utilization in the\ngeneral population. The design of the studies from which\ndata are drawn also varies, complicating the comparison of\nasthma findings.\nIn this paper, we compare predictors of asthma using two\ndifferent criteria to identify cases: maternal reports and\nmedical records. We make use of a unique data set that col-\nlected information from birth certificates, medical records,\nand mothers of a nationally representative, population-based\ncohort, which allows us to compare across two different\nreporting sources for the same sample of young children. We\nfind considerable discrepancies in not only the estimated\nprevalence of asthma but also its distribution across children\nwith different sociodemographic and health characteristics,\ndepending on the source reporting on asthma.\nData were extracted from the 1988 National Maternal and\nInfant Health Survey (NMIHS) and its companion 1991\nLongitudinal Follow-up (LF). The NMIHS was based on a\nsample of birth certificates for children born in 1988, and it\noversampled Black infants and low birth weight infants. In\ntionnaires that requested information about demographic\nbackground, socioeconomic characteristics, and the child's\nhealth (12, 13). Overall, 83 percent of the livebirths from the\nNMIHS participated in the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up.\nAt follow-up, mothers were asked to list the names and\naddresses of all medical care providers visited by the sam-\npled child since birth, and they were asked to grant consent\nfor the National Center for Health Statistics to request all\nmedical records for that child from those providers. Consent\nwas granted by 94 percent of mothers. Consent rates did not\ndiffer significantly according to the sociodemographic char-\nacteristics of the mother or child. If consent was given, a\nquestionnaire was sent to each named provider asking for\ninformation on the type of provider, the reasons for each\nvisit, and any diagnoses or procedures that occurred at that\nvisit. The Medical Provider Survey data file comprises\n99,117 records, one for each reported visit to a medical\nprovider. Seventy-seven percent of the nominated providers\nsupplied medical visit data for 6,159 children, 75 percent of\nthose present at follow-up (14). A discussion of selectivity\nof provider response is described elsewhere (15).\nFor this analysis, a maternal report of asthma was based\non a response of \"yes\" to the question on the 1991 mother's\nquestionnaire: \"Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse,\nor other medical provider that the sampled child had\nasthma?\" As shown in very poor concurrence with the doc-\ntor's diagnosis data (see below), however, these data appear\nto reflect the mother's opinion of whether the child has\nasthma; hence, we refer to them as \"maternal reports of\nasthma.\" A doctor's diagnosis of asthma was based on men-\ntion of asthma on a medical record in either a checklist of\npossible conditions or a listing of asthma by name or\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification, code 493.0 as a diagnosis for any\nvisit (16). Medical providers had the option of filling the\ninformation for each visit into a National Center for Health\nStatistics form or attaching a copy of the medical records for\nthe sampled child. Information on the gestational age, gen-\nder, and race of the infant was drawn from the birth certifi-\ncate; information on breastfeeding, smoking, child care,\nhousehold composition, income, and residence from the\nmother's questionnaires at baseline and follow-up; and\ninformation on other diagnoses from the medical records.\nTo investigate whether the sociodemographic and health\npredictors of early childhood asthma depend on the source\nof asthma report, we estimated logistic regression models of\n1) a medical provider diagnosis of asthma or 2) a maternal\nreport of asthma. The two models were estimated with the\nsame set of predictor variables, using only the 6,159 chil-\ndren for whom both maternal and medical records data were\navailable at the time of follow-up. Analysis of medical\nrecords data from the NMIHS/LF showed that children who\nreceived health care in clinics had Medicaid or no insurance\nand were members of a racial or ethnic minority, and that\nthose who lived in an urban area were more likely than other\nchildren to be excluded from our analysis because none of\ntheir medical providers responded. Moreover, those same\nattributes were associated with having some, but not all, per-\ntinent medical providers respond; hence, it is possible that a\ndoctor's diagnosis could be overlooked because some of the\nchild's medical records were not available for analysis (15).\nTo test the sensitivity of our results to completeness of med-\nical records, we compare results of models for the sample of\nchildren for whom all nominated providers responded (65\npercent of the overall sample) with those for the full sample.\nPrevalence estimates are weighted to the population level\nusing the sampling weights provided by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics for the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up.\nSampling weights are calibrated to be representative of chil-\ndren born in the United States in 1988 who were alive at the\ntime of the follow-up and to incorporate adjustments for the\ninitial sampling design as well as loss to follow-up (13).\nLogistic regression is used to examine the effects of\nsociodemographic and health factors on chances of an\nasthma diagnosis by the time of the 1991 Longitudinal\nFollow-up. Estimated standard errors were corrected for\ncomplex sampling using SUDAAN computer software (17).\nRESULTS\nOverall, the mother, the medical provider, or both identi-\nfied 1,094 cases of asthma. Thirty-six percent of the cases\nwere mentioned by both the mother and the medical\nprovider, 36 percent by the mother only (e.g., the mother but\nnot the medical provider), and the remaining 27 percent by\nthe medical provider only. The kappa statistic for concur-\nrence between maternal reports and medical records was\nrestricted the sample to those children for whom all medical\nproviders responded, the kappa statistic was 0.47, suggest-\ning that incomplete provider response did not explain the\ndifference between the two sources' reports of asthma.\nMothers were more likely to recall and report serious cases\nof asthma, such as those that resulted in a hospitalization.\nHowever, there is surprisingly poor concurrence between\nmaternal reports and medical records, even for relatively\nsevere cases. For only 79 percent of the 190 children with\nmedical records that indicated hospitalization for asthma did\ntheir mother report that the child had ever been diagnosed\nwith asthma. Inclusion of children hospitalized for other seri-\nous respiratory conditions in the comparison (n  241)\nresulted in only slightly higher agreement (80 percent).\nEstimates of asthma prevalence differ substantially\ndepending on which reporting source is used: Weighted to\nnational levels, the prevalence estimates for asthma in the\nsample were 7.7 percent based on medical records or 10.0\npercent based on maternal reports. Restricting the definition\nof \"cases\" to those for whom both the mother and medical\nprovider mention asthma yields a prevalence of 4.1 percent;\nbroadening the definition to include any child for whom\neither the mother or medical provider reported the condition\nyields a prevalence of 13.6 percent.\nTable 1 presents characteristics of children according to\nwhether they had asthma reported by 1) both the doctor and\ndoctor only (n  299), or 4) neither the doctor nor the\nmother (e.g., no asthma reported; n  5,054). Doctor-only\ncases were more likely to be non-Hispanic White, nonpoor,\nand from smaller families in which the mother did not\nsmoke but did breastfeed. Asthma cases reported by both the\nmother and the doctor had a higher average number of med-\nical visits since birth than those for whom either one or the\nother source reported asthma. Mother-only cases were con-\nsiderably more common among children for whom some\nproviders did not respond to the survey (47.6 percent com-\nEffects of Reporting Source on Asthma Risk Factor Conclusions 247\ndoctor or doctor-only cases), raising the possibility that the\nchild had been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor, but that\nthe pertinent medical records were not included in the data-\nbase.\nLogistic regression models of asthma were estimated\nusing either a doctor's diagnosis of asthma (whether or not\nthe mother also reported asthma) or a maternal report of\nasthma (whether or not a doctor also reported asthma) (table\n2). Relations between several of the sociodemographic or\nhealth variables and asthma were consistent whether a doc-\ntor's diagnosis or a mother's report of asthma is used as the\nindicator of an asthma case. A gestational age of less than 28\nweeks and a gestational age of 28\u00ad33 weeks, male gender,\nand Black race were associated with elevated risks of\nasthma in either model (p < 0.05 for all variables). However,\nfor each of those variables except gender, the estimated odds\nTABLE 1.

In both the mother's and doctor's models\nwith the complete provider sample, poverty did not attain\nstatistical significance, in part because of the much smaller\nsample size than in the full sample model (n  3,883 and\nDISCUSSION\nAn analysis of data for a nationally representative cohort\nreveals substantial discrepancy in maternal reports and med-\nical records of asthma among young children. Maternal\nreports yield not only a higher estimate of asthma preva-\nlence but also a different distribution, with wider variation\nacross a larger number of sociodemographic and health\nbehaviors. When maternal reports of asthma are used to\nidentify asthma cases, poverty, large family size, maternal\nsmoking, not having been breastfed, and urban residence are\nall statistically significantly associated with a greater risk of\nasthma in multivariate models. When medical records are\nused to identify asthma cases in the same sample of chil-\ndren, none of those factors is significant. Although previous\nresearch has examined how characteristics of the mother or\nchild affect the concordance of child health data sources (15,\n20), those studies have not taken the additional step of look-\ning at how discordance affects conclusions about which\ngroups are at higher risk of poor health.\nOur findings offer insight that is not available from\ncomparing results of studies of asthma based on medical\nrecords against results of different studies based on mater-\nnal reports (21). Because the NMIHS/LF draws data from\nmedical records and maternal reports for the same set of\nchildren, it is possible to rule out differences in study\ndesign or sample as reasons for the observed discrepancies\nbetween those sources in estimated asthma prevalence and\ndistribution. A handful of other studies with data from both\ntypes of sources have also shown substantial discordance\nbetween maternal reports and physical examination results\nfor children. Using data from the Health Examination\nSurvey, Jessop and Stein (21) found that maternally\nreported asthma was often not mentioned in the clinical\nfindings. Similar patterns across conditions have been\nobserved for adult health (22).\nSome of the inconsistency in the published literature\nregarding the prevalence and distribution of asthma among\nchildren stems from differences in definition or measure-\nment of asthma. For example, patterns of point prevalence\nof asthma at the time of screening via questionnaire or clin-\nical examination differ from patterns of annual prevalence\n(in the 12 months prior to the study), which in turn will dif-\nfer from those for cumulative or lifetime prevalence because\nof variations in symptoms across a child's lifetime (9). Both\nof the reporting sources used in this analysis provide esti-\nmates of cumulative prevalence. Hence, differences across\nsources cannot be attributed to that factor.\nA possible drawback to the comparison of data from the\ntwo reporting sources in the NMIHS/LF is that the length of\nthe recall period is far shorter for the medical records than\nfor the mother's reports. Data are recorded in the medical\nchart immediately after a patient's visit, but the mothers\nwere asked to report on their child's health over a 3-year\nperiod. Nonetheless, the patterns seen in the maternal report\ndata from the NMIHS/LF are likely to be typical of those for\nhealth surveys that retrospectively collect information on\ncumulative or lifetime prevalence (22), although they prob-\nably overstate recall bias for estimates for shorter time peri-\nods such as 3 months or 12 months, intervals often used in\nhealth surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey\nor the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nAnother weakness of these data is that roughly one third\nof children were missing medical records for one or more of\ntheir health care providers, raising the possibility that they\nhad in fact been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor but that\ninformation was missing from the data set. However, incom-\nplete provider response does not appear to explain differ-\nences between maternal reports and medical records in the\nset of risk factors identified for asthma. When we reesti-\nmated the model for doctor's report of asthma focusing only\non children for whom all providers responded to the survey,\nthe same set of risk factors was statistically significant as in\nthe model with both complete and incomplete medical\nrecords, although the poverty effect became larger and\ncloser to statistical significance.\nAn issue that affects the study of asthma risk factors\namong young children is the difficulty in diagnosing asthma\nin this age group, including such issues as differentiating\nbetween bronchitis and asthma and the different criteria for\nthe frequency and severity of wheezing and other respira-\ntory symptoms. However, although these factors introduce\nvariability across doctors in the diagnosis of asthma, they\nare unlikely to explain the observed discrepancies between\ndoctors' diagnoses and maternal reports of asthma.\nAnother possible reason for the discrepancy between\nmaternal reports and medical records in these data is that\nreactive airway disease (a term used by many physicians\nwho suspect but are not yet ready to name asthma) will be\ncoded as 493.0 (asthma) unless the physician specifically\nnotes \"reactive airway disease, not asthma\" on the patient's\nchart (23). For those visits, the parent would not be told the\nchild had asthma, yet the medical record data would be\ncoded as mentioning asthma. This type of error could affect\nother health surveys that rely on parents' reports of asthma.\nSimilar errors could occur with other health conditions in\ninstances where the physician uses a synonym for a health\ncondition that doesn't match the precise terminology or cod-\ning that would be written on medical charts and, hence,\nmight not match the wording on a health survey. For exam-\nple, the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up asks about \"chronic\northopedic problems,\" which a parent might not recognize\nas synonymous with \"bone or joint disease.\"\nWhen considering the implications of the observed dis-\ncordance between maternal reports and medical records on\nasthma or other health conditions, one should note that nei-\nther reporting source can be considered to be the definitive\n\"gold standard\" against which the other should be judged\n(21). Medical records are completed at the time of each visit\nby trained medical providers who are familiar with diagnos-\ntic criteria. Hence, medical records are less likely to suffer\nfrom either recall bias or misdiagnosis than are the retro-\nspective maternal reports. However, if children are not taken\nto a physician for a particular health problem, that problem\nwill be overlooked in the medical records.\nEvidence from other studies suggests that differences in\nhealth care utilization may be an important factor in\naccounting for the higher prevalence estimates based on the\nmaternal reports than on the medical records. Children from\nurban areas, low income families, and those families lacking\nhealth insurance are less likely to receive medical care for\nasthma (10, 24), reducing the chances that they will be diag-\nnosed. Joseph et al. (25) showed that a substantial share of\nschool-aged children had clinical evidence of asthma\ndespite a lack of a physician's diagnosis of the condition. In\na study of discrepant reporting of asthma, Miller et al. (15)\nshowed that mother-only reports were nearly twice as com-\nmon and that physician-only reports were only 60 percent as\ncommon among children from poor families. Children who\ndid not have health insurance were also more likely to have\nasthma reported by their mother but not by a medical\nprovider. These findings suggest that analyses based on\nmedical charts or discharge records are likely to understate\nthe deleterious effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on\nthe risk of asthma or other health conditions.\n"
