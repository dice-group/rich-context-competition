We examine adolescent friendship networks using a Stochastic Actor-Based model-\ning approach to observe the flow of emotional support provision to peers and the effect\nof support from parents, while simultaneously modeling smoking behavior. We utilized\none school (n = 976) from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\n(AddHealth) Study. Our findings suggest that emotional support is transacted through an\ninterdependent contextual system, comprised of both peer and parental effects, with the lat-\nter also having distal indirect effects from youths' friends' parents.\n",

Social\nsupport serves varied functions for health and health behavior, with emotional support gener-\nally extending to intimacy, attachment, and the ability to confide in and rely on someone, all of\nwhich contribute to feeling cared for [4]. Emotional support is one of the most relevant and\nyet most complex domains of social support for health, as it is related to both salutary [5] and\nadverse health outcomes [2,6\u00ad8].\nPeer and parental support provision\nSocial support from both peers and parents is a critical socialization force in adolescence.\nParents are role models for adolescents as they learn social competencies, which in turn affect\nadolescents' ability to form friendships [9\u00ad11]. As adolescence progresses, peer relationships\ngain increasing importance, becoming as salient a source of support for youth as are their\nparents [12]. Studies suggest that adolescents view both their friends [13\u00ad15] and parents [16\u00ad\n18] as primary sources of social support, including emotional support [19,20].\nPeer and parental support differentially impact adolescent behavior including substance\nuse [18,21].
