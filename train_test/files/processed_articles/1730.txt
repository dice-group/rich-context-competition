Pyrethroids\nexert their neurotoxicity by slowing the open-\ning and closing of voltage-gated sodium chan-\nnels in insect and mammalian nerve cells\n(Shafer et al. 2005). Recent toxicologic studies\nshow interference with chloride channels and\nother target systems (Ray and Fry 2006; Shafer\nand Meyer 2004). Although the acute toxicity\nto humans is well documented (Spencer and\nO'Malley 2006), data on health effects of\nlower-level exposures are currently limited to\nanimal studies. Findings from these suggest\nthat additional research on human exposures is\nwarranted. In their review of 22 rodent studies,\nfor example, Shafer et al. (2005) report associa-\ntions between in utero pyrethroid exposures and\npersistent changes in neurochemistry, motor\nactivity, behavior, and learning.\nIn July 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) reported mea-\nsurable levels of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid\n(3PBA), a metabolite of several commonly\nused pyrethroids, including permethrin, cyper-\nmethrin, cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and fen-\nvalerate, in 75% of urine samples analyzed for\npesticides (n = 3,048) in the U.S. National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n2005b). Pyrethroids are metabolized in mam-\nmals by ester hydrolysis and subsequent conju-\ngation to a number of primary and secondary\nmetabolites, including 3PBA (Godin et al.\n2007). In vitro studies with human liver\nmicrosomes implicate carboxylesterases (Nishi\nhyde dehydrogenases (Choi et al. 2002), and\net al. 2007) as responsible enzymes. A handful\nof studies using adult volunteers and pest con-\ntrol operators estimated half-lives of 3PBA in\nurine of 6\u00ad24 hr after pyrethroid exposure,\nwith near complete elimination after several\ndays (Eadsforth et al. 1988; Eadsforth and\nDespite the NHANES evidence of wide-\nspread exposure in the U.S. population, little is\nknown about how Americans are exposed to\npyrethroids. Current research shows that both\ndiet and nondiet factors may be important pre-\ndictors of body burden. In their study of 23\nchildren 3\u00ad11 of age in Seattle, Washington,\nLu et al. (2006) found associations between\nurinary 3PBA and reported use of pyrethroids\naround the home and on pets, and eating con-\nventional versus organic diets. Three small-\nthe CDC to evaluate exposures to pyrethroids\nsprayed for vector control found significant\nassociations between urinary 3PBA and use of\npesticides on pets in one study, but no signifi-\ncant difference in 3PBA before and after (1\u00ad4\ndays) spraying in any study (CDC 2005h). In\ntheir study of 386 mother\u00adinfant pairs in New\nYork City, Berkowitz et al. (2003) found lower\nurinary 3PBA among women living in public\nversus private housing, but no consistent asso-\nciations among 3PBA and other sociodemo-\ngraphic or pesticide use predictors. Williams\net al. (2006) detected permethrin in plasma\nfrom 17 New York City women who reported\nusing pyrethroids to control roaches at home\nversus none in samples from 21 women using\nalternative strategies.\n  conducted in Europe suggests that\ndiet is an important exposure pathway. Urinary\n3PBA has been regularly detected among\nGerman subjects reporting no household use or\noccupational exposure to pyrethroids (Heudorf\nSchettgen et al. 2002). A small-scale study by\ntwo Italian cities provides similar indirect evi-\ndence for the influence of diet.

A secondary objective was to explore\nwhether the NHANES data could be used to identify particular foods driving 3PBA levels.\nMETHODS: We divided subjects into child (6\u00ad10 years of age), teen (11\u00ad18 years), and adult ( 19\nyears) age groups and restricted our analyses to subjects in the morning sampling session who\nfasted for  8 hr beforehand. Regression modeling consisted of several model-building steps and a\nfinal Tobit regression on the left-censored log 3PBA measurements. We also conducted bootstrap\nanalyses to evaluate the stability of the regression parameters.\nRESULTS: Reported household pesticide use was not significantly associated with urinary 3PBA in\nany age group. Diet was significant for all three groups, and certain foods appeared to contribute\nmore than others. Among adults, tobacco use was positively associated with 3PBA (p = 0.0326),\nand positive associations were suggested with the number of cytochrome p450\u00adinhibiting medica-\nCONCLUSIONS: Although exploratory, our findings underline the importance of collecting accurate\ndata on household pesticide use and dietary intake when evaluating pyrethroid exposure\u00adbiomarker\nrelationships.\nKEY WORDS: 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, biomarkers, dietary exposure, pesticides, pyrethroids.\nexplaining variability in urinary 3PBA for each\nage group. A secondary objective was to explore\nwhether the NHANES data could be used to\nidentify particular foods driving urinary 3PBA\nlevels in each group. Our overall goal was to\nhelp identify major pathways of pyrethroid\nexposure in everyday American life and thus\ninform the design of future exposure and inter-\nvention studies.\nMethods\nNHANES data collection. Detailed data collec-\ntion methods are available at the NHANES\napproved by the CDC Institutional Review\nBoard. Briefly, urine samples were collected\nduring the medical examination. Subjects were\nrandomly stratified into morning (50% of sub-\njects) and afternoon/evening sessions (50% of\nsubjects), with morning sampling beginning at\napproximately 0830 hours, afternoon sampling\n1730 hours. Subjects in morning, afternoon,\nand evening sessions were requested to fast\n2001). Self-reported fasting duration was\nrecorded before sample collection. A 24-hr\ndietary recall interview was conducted where\nsubjects worked with trained interviewers using\nmeasurement aids to record all foods/beverages\nconsumed from midnight to midnight the day\nrecall data include estimates of grams eaten by\ndescriptive eight-digit food code. To improve\naccuracy, the computer-assisted interview used\nAlthough this method has been validated for\nassessing adult macronutrient intakes (Conway\net al. 2004), we did not find peer-reviewed val-\nidation studies for children, teens, or consump-\ntion of individual foods.\nBasic demographic data, as well as infor-\nmation on household pesticide use, physical\nactivities, occupation, and other factors poten-\ntially relevant to pesticide exposures, were col-\nlected during the household sample person\nfamily members served as proxy respondents\nfor subjects 6\u00ad15 of age. Information on use of\npesticides in the home, yard, and foundation\nduring the previous month was collected using\na family questionnaire, administered with the\nsubject or household head. Interviews were\ngenerally conducted 1 week before the exami-\nnation, with the longest lag approximately\ntions focused on chemicals used to \"control\nfleas, roaches, ants, termites, or other insects\"\nWe recoded the NHANES occupation\ndata to identify subjects with potential work-\nplace exposure. NHANES question OCD230\nasked subjects the industry they worked in, and\nquestion OCD240 asked the type of work they\nperformed. We created a new variable with five\nresponse categories--don't work, other, farm,\ncleaning, and working in a private house-\nhold--and categorized subjects based on their\nExclusion/inclusion rules for regressions. We\nexcluded subjects missing urinary 3PBA mea-\nsurements, missing diet interview data, or with\ninterviews coded \"not reliable\" (CDC 2005g).\nIn the adult group, we also excluded pregnant\nsubjects (18% of subjects tested) because uri-\nnary 3PBA levels differed significantly between\npregnant and nonpregnant female subjects\nBecause the dietary recall period ended at\nmidnight the night before sample collection,\nwe included only subjects who attended the\nmorning session and reported fasting  8 hr,\nhoping to exclude subjects who ate foods that\nwere not recorded in the diet interview. We\nused 8 hr as the cutoff because that was the\nminimum duration between the midnight\nclose of the recall period and the earliest hour\nof the morning examination session.\nPreparation of dietary interview data.\nDiet data for the pesticide subsample\nincluded 3,573 eight-digit descriptive food\ncodes. Many (n = 1,031) of these foods were\neaten by only one subject. In the teen and\nadult groups, we removed foods eaten by\n< 1% of the restricted sample, whereas we\nremoved foods eaten by < 5% of the restricted\nchild sample. Including these rarely eaten\nfoods in the regressions would likely result in\nunstable parameter estimates and would not\ncontribute to our understanding of variance\nin urinary 3PBA, so we decided to exclude\nthem. We used 5% instead of 1% for the\nchild group because the child sample size was\napproximately 30% and 16% of the teen and\nadult sample sizes, respectively.\nRegression model building. For each age\ngroup, we adapted initial model building\net al. (1990), involving the following steps:\nStep 1. Construct a list of potential\nnondiet predictors of pyrethroid exposure\nfrom the literature (Appendix 1).\nStep 2. Screen individual nondiet predic-\ntors by conducting univariate regressions of\nlog 3PBA on individual nondiet predictors,\npassing only those with p-values  0.2 to step\n3. The step 2 model form is\nXi\nwhere ln 3PBA is the ln-transformed urinary\n3PBA concentration; i indexes the step 1\nnondiet predictors, (i.e., i = 1, NND)\n, and NND\nis the total number of nondiet predictors\nconsidered; Xi\nrepresents the predictor in the\nunivariate regression. These are class indicators\nfor categorical variables or actual values for\ncontinuous variables.\nStep 3. Perform a single Tobit regression\ndetection limit on all step 2 nondiet predic-\ntors, and select those predictors with p-value\n 0.2 for inclusion in the final model (predic-\ntors with p-values > 0.2 we manually removed\nfrom the step 3 regression until all remaining\npredictors had p-values  0.2). Tobit regres-\nsion is appropriate for left-censored data sets\nwith normally/lognormally distributed error\n+ j\nXj\nwhere j indexes the nondiet predictors (cate-\ngorical and continuous) that pass the step 2\nscreen (note that this is a subset of the step 2\npredictors, such that j  i); Xj\nrepresents the\npredictor in the multivariable regression.\nStep 4. Perform a backward elimination\nregression of the residuals from step 3 on\nreported 24-hr grams eaten by food code, and\nselect only those food codes with p-values\n 0.2 for inclusion in the final model. The\nstep 4 model form is\nR(ln 3PBA)ND\n+ k\nXk\nwhere R(ln 3PBA)ND\nare the residuals from\nthe step 3 regression, k indexes the individual\nfood item (e.g., carrots), and Xk\nindicates the\nnumber of grams of food item k consumed\nby each subject.\nTo control for urine dilution, we included\ncreatinine as a predictor at each regression step.\nCreatinine is sometimes used this way because\nits excretion rate is independent of urine flow\n(Boeniger et al. 1993). Although this approach\nhas limitations, including diurnal, seasonal,\nand age-related changes in creatinine excretion\ncreatinine was the only physiologic variable\navailable in NHANES for dilution correction.\nFinal regression models. For each age\ngroup, we fitted the final model using Tobit\nregression, ln 3PBA, and only the predictors\nthat passed steps 2\u00ad4. We included second-\norder polynomials and interaction terms for\nthe nondiet predictors, whereas we tested\nfood predictors for main effects only. The\nfinal model form is\nis the overall mean of the ln-trans-\nformed urinary 3PBA concentration, j indexes\nthe nondiet predictors, m indexes the nondiet\npredictor interaction terms, 1j\nis the linear\nregression coefficient for the jth nondiet\nRiederer et al.\npredictor, 2j\nis the quadratic regression\ncoefficient for the jth nondiet predictor, 3jm\nis the regression coefficient for the interaction\nbetween the jth and mth nondiet predictors,\nk\u00b4 indexes the individual food predictor that\npassed step 4, 4k\u00b4 is the linear regression coef-\nficient for the k\u00b4th food predictor, and Xk\u00b4\nindicates the number of grams of food k\u00b4\nconsumed by each subject.\nAfter step 3, step 4, and the final model\nfitting, we evaluated our model assumptions\n(normality, homoskedasticity) by examining\nplots of predicted values versus standardized\nresiduals, and histograms and normal proba-\nbility plots of standardized residuals. We used\nand backward elimination regressions, respec-\ntively. We specified a lognormal distribution\nfor the Tobit regressions, and left 3PBA values\ncensored at the reported detection limit\nrion for statistical significance was p  0.05 for\nthe regression parameters.\nThe NHANES data include sample\nweights and other design variables ordinarily\nused to adjust statistical inferences to represent\nthe U.S. population. We chose not to apply\nthese weights or other design adjustments\nbecause we applied numerous exclusion crite-\nria. Further, we were concerned with explor-\ning relationships among urinary 3PBA and\ndiet/nondiet exposure factors in a convenient\nsample rather than generalizing results to the\nU.S. population.\nBootstrap simulations. We conducted\nbootstrap simulations (Efron 1979) to evaluate\nthe impact of the model selection procedure on\nvariability in the regression parameters for the\nfood predictors. Ordinary confidence intervals\nand p-values account for the effects of sample\nsize given a particular model, but the model\nselection procedure adds additional variability.\nBecause the consumption data for each food\npredictor were typically characterized by a large\nnumber of zero values, and a smaller number\nof nonzero values depending on the number of\nsubjects who ate that food, the regression para-\nmeters may be unduly influenced by outlying\npoints. The bootstrap approach allows evalua-\ntion of whether certain foods remain signifi-\ncant predictors if we randomly remove\nobservations, thus testing the influence of\npotentially outlying points. We hypothesized\nthat foods appearing as significant predictors in\nmost of the simulated regressions would have a\nsignificant association with urinary 3PBA that\nwas not simply due to chance.\nTo create each bootstrapped sample, we\nsample n random observations with replace-\nment from the restricted data set, where n is\nthe restricted sample size (Figure 1). We then\nperformed the regression procedures described\nabove on the bootstrapped sample, with one\nexception: because we automated the bootstrap\nsimulations, we did not manually remove pre-\ndictors with p-values > 0.20 during step 3. If\n 5% of subjects in the child group or 1% in\nthe teen and adult groups did not eat a particu-\nlar food in the bootstrapped sample, we did\nnot include that food in the step 4 regression.\nWe repeated this process 5,000 times for each\nage group. We constructed box plots of the\nbootstrapped regression parameters for food\ncodes that were significant predictors of urinary\n3PBA in the original regressions.\nResults\nRestricted sample sizes. Figure 1 shows the\nfinal restricted sample sizes by age group and\nthe number of subjects removed by each\nexclusion rule. Final sample sizes for the\nincomplete observations (i.e., missing data for\none or more predictors) did not exceed 2% of\ntotal observations for any age group. Final\nsample sizes were approximately 40% of the\nstarting sample size, with the exception of the\nchild group, for which we excluded an addi-\ntional 20% of subjects for not meeting the\n 8-hr fasting criterion.\nAmong the restricted samples, we found\nno significant difference in 3PBA detection fre-\nquencies by age group (Fisher's exact p =\n3PBA differed significantly (Wilcoxon rank\ncreatinine for the child, teen, and adult groups,\nrespectively. We substituted the detection limit\nfor below-detection values for all analyses\nreported in this section. We did not normalize\nurinary 3PBA by creatinine in the regressions.\nModel specifications and fit diagnostics.\nThe screening steps reduced the number of\n(1 nondiet/16 diet) in the child group, from\nin the adult group. Probability plots of stan-\ndardized residuals supported the lognormality\nassumptions, whereas plots of standardized\nresiduals versus predicted 3PBA values showed\neven scatter across the range of predicted val-\nues for each group. We evaluated model fit by\ncomparing the difference between \u00ad2 log like-\nlihood for the final fitted model and that of a\nreduced model containing the same observa-\ntions but only urinary creatinine as a predictor\n(creatinine-only model) (Collett 1994). We\ntested two other models using the same obser-\nvations--one with only nondiet predictors,\nthe other with only food predictors--against\nthe creatinine-only model for each age group.\nFor all groups, all models tested explained sig-\nnificantly more of the variability in urinary\n3PBA than did the creatinine-only model (i.e.,\nchi-square p-values for all tests were < 0.05).\nSignificant predictors of urinary 3PBA by\nage group. Tables 1 and 2 show the regression\nparameter estimates and corresponding p-values\nfor significant predictors of urinary 3PBA in the\nchild and teen, and adult groups, respectively.\nDiet and nondiet predictors of urinary 3PBA in NHANES\nFigure 1.

In the child group,\nonly ground beef had a 5th\u00ad95th percentile\nbootstrapped  range above zero (Figure 2). In\nthe teen group, mayonnaise-type salad dress-\ning and Caesar dressing had 5th\u00ad95th per-\ncentile ranges above zero, whereas pepper-type\nsoft drinks, presweetened instant tea, tortilla\nchips, whole wheat bread, and M&Ms peanut\ncandies had 5th\u00ad95th percentile ranges below\nzero (Figure 3). In the adult group, foods with\n5th\u00ad95th percentile bootstrapped  ranges\nabove zero included bacon, corn puffs/twists,\nand endive/chicory/escarole/romaine lettuce;\nno adult foods had 5th\u00ad95th percentile ranges\nbelow zero.\nDiscussion\nStatistical significance versus random chance.\nBecause we compared a large number of pre-\ndictors with urinary 3PBA levels, it was reason-\nable to expect that spurious associations may\nbe found due to chance. For example, in a case\nwhere no predictors were associated with a\nresponse variable when we compared 100 pre-\ndictors with the response variable using a 5%\ncutoff for probability, approximately five pre-\ndictors would be expected to display statistical\nsignificance due to chance. If we found a larger\nnumber of predictors (i.e., > 5%), we would be\nconfident that at least some of the predictors\nrepresented true association rather random\nchance. Following this example, in the child,\nteen, and adult regressions, we would expect 1,\n5, and 5 predictors, respectively, to be signifi-\ncant due to chance alone. However, 8 predic-\ntors were significant in the child model, 23 in\nthe teen model, and 21 in the adult model.\nThis suggests that at least some are indeed pre-\ndictors of urinary 3PBA in these groups and\nthat the associations we see are not all due\npurely to chance.\nPesticide use predictors of urinary 3PBA.\nDiet and household pesticide use are hypothe-\nsized to be major contributors to pyrethroid\nbody burden in non-occupationally exposed\nAmericans. In our analyses, diet was a signifi-\ncant predictor of urinary 3PBA for all three age\ngroups. This was not unexpected because one\nor more pyrethroids were detected in 52% of\nthe 260 food items analyzed for pesticides in\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA 2001).\nReported household pesticide use was not\na significant predictor of urinary 3PBA in any\nage group. A possible methodologic explana-\ntion for the observed lack of association in the\nchild and teen models may lie in the fact that\nthe NHANES interviews were conducted\nDiet and nondiet predictors of urinary 3PBA in NHANES\nFigure 3.

The lack\nof association could be due to true differences\nin pyrethroid use practices and behaviors in\nchildren and teens versus adults. For example,\nparents may store pesticides out of reach or\nprohibit their children or teens from using\nthem. Parents of young children may use\nfewer pesticides at home. Although we did\nnot observe a difference in reported indoor\nuse among the three groups, a greater per-\ncentage of adult subjects reported using pesti-\nthe child and teen groups, respectively).\nLikewise, the percentage of teen and adult\nsubjects reporting nonprofessional yard appli-\ncations (10\u00ad11%) was twice that reporting\nprofessional applications (4\u00ad6%), whereas\nsimilar percentages reported nonprofessional\nand professional applications in the child\ngroup (4\u00ad5%). This may reflect underreport-\ning of yard pesticide use by adult proxy\nrespondents of child subjects.\nThe lack of association between reported\nhousehold pesticide use and urinary 3PBA in\nour child and teen models contradicts the\nfindings of Lu et al. (2006), although study\ndesign differences limit comparison. Lu et al.\ncollected 15 consecutive days of urine samples\nand asked about household pesticide use dur-\ning the past month. They also administered\ntheir questionnaire on sampling day 1,\nwhereas the NHANES household pesticide use\nquestionnaire was administered 1\u00ad3 weeks\nbefore sampling. The narrower window of\ntime between potential exposure and urine col-\nlection in the Lu et al. (2006) study may partly\nexplain the contradictory findings. The mis-\nmatch in ages between Lu et al. (3\u00ad11 years of\nage) and the restricted NHANES sample\n(6\u00ad10 years of age) may also help explain the\ndifference because younger children have been\nshown to exhibit greater hand-to-mouth activ-\nity than do older children (Xue et al. 2007),\npotentially resulting in higher contaminant\nbody burdens. It is important to note that Lu\net al. (2006) studied a small cohort of metro-\npolitan Seattle, Washington (USA) families,\nwhose pesticide use practices may not be repre-\nsentative of other U.S. regions.\nIn their study of German children, Becker\net al. (2006) found significant associations\nbetween reported indoor pesticide use (yes/no)\nand urinary levels of other pyrethroid metabo-\nlites but not 3PBA. They did find a significant\nassociation between 3PBA and permethrin\nconcentrations in house dust, which might be\nargued is a more accurate measure of indoor\nuse than is self-reported use during the previ-\nous month because the half-life of pyrethroids\nin dust may be longer than 1 month (Leng\net al. 2005). Nonetheless, Becker et al. cite\nthree other German studies, across a range of\nsubject ages, in which the dust\u00ad3PBA relation-\nship was not significant.\nOther significant nondiet predictors of\nurinary 3PBA. Significant nondiet predictors\nin the teen model included urinary creatinine\nand BMI and their square terms, indicating\npossible nonlinear associations between these\npredictors and 3PBA. Creatinine and its\nsquare term were also significant in the adult\nmodel, as was active tobacco use. We origi-\nnally included tobacco use as a predictor\nbecause of its status as a known CYP450\ninducer (Appendix 1). However, we cannot\nexclude the possibilities of direct exposures\nfrom tobacco (although most pyrethroids cur-\nrently are not registered for use on U.S.\ntobacco) or indirect exposures to pyrethroid-\ncontaminated dust from increased hand-to-\nmouth activity potentially associated with\ntobacco use.\nThe occupation variable did not return the\ncategories we expected to be significant,\nnamely, farm (NHANES categories farm\noperators/managers/supervisors, farm/nursery\nworkers, and related agricultural/forestry/fish-\ning occupations) and cleaning (NHANES\ncleaning/building service occupations cate-\ngory) (CDC 2005i). Instead, working in a pri-\nvate household or other jobs (a composite of\nall other NHANES categories not coded farm,\ncleaning, or household) were significantly\nassociated with lower 3PBA versus not work-\ning (Table 2).\nIn the adult model, two nondiet predictors\nhad p-values close to our significance criterion:\nreported number of prescription medications\nknown to inhibit CYP450 used in the past\nutes spent gardening in the past month ( =\nsample, 14%, 3%, and 1% of subjects reported\ntaking one, two, or three CYP450-inhibiting\nprescription drugs, respectively; 41 drugs\ninhibiting a range of CYP450 isoforms were\nreported. Di Consiglio et al. (2005) demon-\nstrated with human in vitro preparations that\nseveral organophosphate pesticides inhibit\nCYP450-mediated degradation of an antide-\npressant medication, but we were unable to\nfind studies on the effect of therapeutic drugs\non pesticide metabolism in general, or\npyrethroids specifically. The question of drug\ninfluences on pesticide pharmacokinetics may\nbe worthy of further exploration. Because only\nthree of the subjects who reported gardening in\nthe past month also reported using pesticides,\nwe did not expect to see any relationship\nbetween gardening activity and urinary 3PBA.\nSpecific foods driving urinary 3PBA levels\nby age group. For all age groups, the regres-\nsions produced a greater number of foods that\nwere significantly associated with urinary\n3PBA than might have been expected due to\nchance. Further interpretation is complicated\nby the fact that the regressions returned foods\nwith both positive and negative  values. We\nfind this difficult to explain beyond the simple\nargument we outlined in a similar study (Ryan\net al. 2001), namely, that a positive  suggests\nthat the corresponding food item contained\npyrethroids whereas a negative  suggests the\ncorresponding food did not contain\npyrethroids and substituted for one that did.\nIn the present study, we used simple boot-\nstrap resampling to provide additional insight\ninto how variance in the NHANES food data\nmight influence the  estimates. Certain\nfoods remained significant in a majority\n(which we define arbitrarily as 70% or more)\nof the bootstrap simulations, suggesting that\nthe data variability did not affect the contri-\nbution of these particular foods in explaining\nthe variance in urinary 3PBA. These foods\nwere not always the most frequently con-\nsumed, for example, Caesar dressing in the\nteen group. Foods that were significant in\n70% or more of the simulations and had\n5\u00ad95th percentile bootstrap  ranges above\nzero included ground beef in the child group\nand mayonnaise-type salad dressing, bacon,\nand Caesar dressing in the teen group. No\ncentile  ranges below zero.\nLimitations and future research. We did\nnot apply NHANES sample weights or other\ndesign variables during our analyses, prevent-\ning us from generalizing our results to the U.S.\npopulation. The inclusion of the NHANES\ndesign variables is unlikely to change the\nregression coefficients substantially because our\nmodels controlled or stratified by age and race,\ntwo primary characteristics used for oversam-\npling in NHANES. However, incorporation of\nthe design variables could affect the standard\nerrors and statistical significance of the predic-\nOur work demonstrates the limitations of\nusing large observational data sets like\nNHANES for evaluating exposure\u00adbiomarker\nrelationships. We chose an exploratory\napproach because the current literature on\npyrethroid exposures and urinary 3PBA is\ninconsistent, resulting in many reasonable\na priori hypotheses. From this starting point,\nwe used a multistep model selection proce-\ndure to screen predictors based on p-values.\nThe dependence of p-values on sample size is\nwell known, and the large sample sizes espe-\ncially in our adult group may have resulted in\na failure to screen out certain foods that were\ntruly unrelated to 3PBA. We used a bootstrap\napproach to evaluate the impact of this model\nselection procedure on variability in the\nregression parameters for the food predictors.\nThe bootstrap results presented in Tables 1\nand 2 demonstrate how certain foods, even\nthose eaten relatively frequently in the origi-\nnal sample (e.g., lettuce), appear as significant\nRiederer et al.\npredictors only in a fraction (e.g., lettuce =\n42%) of the bootstrapped regressions,\nwhereas Figures 2\u00ad4 demonstrate that the\nestimated  values for many foods are not sig-\nnificantly different from zero after a large\nnumber of simulations. This illustrates one\npotential pitfall associated with drawing con-\nclusions from a single regression model of a\nlarge data set with many low-frequency pre-\ndictors: slight permutations of the data such\nas those achieved by random resampling may\nlead to different conclusions.\nAnother limitation is that we did not test\ninteractions between certain foods likely to\nhave been eaten together (e.g., salad dressing\nand lettuce) because we did not have adequate\ndegrees of freedom. Failure to account for\nthese correlations may produce unstable\nregression coefficients that are influenced by\noutlying points and may not be readily inter-\npretable for certain combinations of foods\ndue to the arbitrary partitioning of variance\nbetween them. Additional research is needed\non which foods are most often eaten together\nand which foods are likely to contain\npyrethroid residues. Further, we did not dis-\ntinguish between foods eaten at home versus\nout, although NHANES provided this infor-\nmation; this could have biased our results if\nmore pyrethroids are typically present at one\nof these locations. Last, we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that there were important pre-\ndictors of urinary 3PBA that we did not con-\nsider simply because they were not included\nDespite these limitations, our results point\ntoward one practical conclusion and several\ninteresting hypotheses for future testing. The\npractical conclusion is that we did not detect\nan association between reported household\npesticide use and urinary 3PBA in the\nNHANES data. Future survey directors may\nconsider collecting more detailed information\nabout pesticide use events, including dates,\nchemical names, and/or application types,\nalthough this would add to subject burden. If\nthe goal of NHANES is to provide cross-sec-\ntional reference values, and not to link expo-\nsure factors with biomarker levels, then the\ncost of a more detailed pesticide use question-\nnaire may not be justified.\nFuture hypotheses to be tested include the\nassociation between urinary 3PBA and con-\nsumption of the specific foods with positive \nvalues in our bootstrap analyses (e.g., ground\nbeef in the child model). This might be accom-\nplished with the current NHANES data by\naggregating the eight-digit food codes into\nlarger categories (e.g., by grouping all the bacon\ncodes). However, these associations might be\nmore efficiently investigated using diet and\n3PBA data from ongoing longitudinal studies\n(e.g., Lu et al. 2006). Our results are also sug-\ngestive of potential interactions between pre-\nscription medications and pyrethroid\nmetabolism, but research characterizing specific\nmetabolic and interaction pathways in humans\nis needed. Interactions between pharmaceuticals\nand dietary pesticide metabolism might be\ninvestigated through controlled studies where\nmatched subjects eat the same foods and differ\nonly by medication status.\nREFERENCES\nBarr DB, Wilder LC, Caudill SP, Gonzalez AJ, Needham LL,\nPirkle JL. 2005.
