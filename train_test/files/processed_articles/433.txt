    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nStudies of the effect of milk consumption on bone density have focused on white women. The applicability to\nother races is unclear. This study of 4316 women found a racial difference in the effect of early milk\nconsumption on bone. Further study is required to evaluate the etiology of this difference.\nIntroduction: Early milk consumption has been found to influence bone mineral density positively throughout life.\nPrevious studies leading to this finding focused on white women; there are no data to support the view that black\nwomen also gain an equivalent benefit from early milk consumption.\nMaterials and Methods: Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII), we analyzed the relationship between reported childhood and teenage milk consumption and current hip bone\nmineral density at four sites (femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip) among postmenopausal and 20-\nto 39-year-old non-Hispanic white (NHW) and black (NHB) women. Potential confounding variables were accounted\nfor in the analysis.\nResults: Controlling for age and body mass index, teenage milk consumption was significantly associated with\nhigher bone mineral density at all four sites among both postmenopausal and 20- to 39-year-old white women, but\nwas not associated with bone mineral density at any site among black women. A similar pattern was observed for\nchildhood milk intake. The interaction between race and teenage milk consumption significantly explained post-\nmenopausal bone mineral density at all sites, whereas the interaction between race and teenage milk consumption was\nsignificant at two of the four sites among the 20- to 39-year-old women.\nConclusion: The results show racial differences in the effect of early milk consumption on peak and postmenopausal\nbone mineral density.\n",

Conversely, a number of protective\ncharacteristics have been identified. Calcium intake, espe-\ncially before achieving peak bone mass, is a determinant of\nbone mass throughout life. Milk contributes over one-half of\nthe calcium to the average American child's (2\u00ad11 years\nold) diet. All dairy products together provide 70% of\nchildhood calcium intake.(3) The effects of dairy products\non calcium metabolism are not limited to their high calcium\ncontent. Some dairy products also contain significant quan-\ntities of sodium and protein, both of which have been\nassociated with urinary calcium loss.(4) Because milk has a\nhigher ratio of calcium to sodium and protein than other\ndairy products, it is reasonable to consider that milk may\ninfluence bone density more positively than other dairy\nproducts.(5)\nMilk consumption in children and teenagers has been\nassociated, in many cross-sectional and a few prospective\nstudies, with enhanced bone mineral acquisition, higher\npeak bone mass, and higher bone density in adulthood.(6\u00ad12)\nThe effect of milk consumption by older women on bone\nmass is less well defined, but some studies have found a\nThe authors have no conflict of interest.\n1Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.\n2Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.\n\u00a9 2003 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\npositive impact.(8,10) All these studies excluded blacks. The\nrelationship between early milk consumption and BMD\namong black women has yet to be explored.\nFor several reasons, the results of studies suggesting\nincreased bone mass in white women with high childhood\nand teenage milk consumption may not apply to black\nwomen. Despite clear similarities, there are significant dif-\nferences between black and white women in the factors gov-\nerning mineral metabolism and bone mass. Black women have\nsignificantly higher bone mass than whites.(13\u00ad15) Black\nwomen also have lower bone turnover rates, higher parathyroid\nhormone (PTH) levels, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels\n[25(OH)D], and lower urinary calcium excretion than white\nwomen.(14\u00ad18) In addition, the high prevalence of lactose in-\ntolerance among blacks may impair their ability to benefit\nfrom diets high in lactose-containing products such as\nmilk.(19) Undoubtedly, there are other undefined racial dif-\nferences in calcium metabolism between white and black\nwomen. There is clearly a paucity of research on racial\ndifferences in calcium metabolism, especially dietary calci-\num's effect on bone mass. The National Institutes of Health\nconsensus statement on optimal calcium intake noted the\ndearth of information on calcium requirements among dif-\nferent ethnic groups and recommended further research in\nThe current study explores the differential effects of\nchildhood and teenage milk consumption on hip BMD in\nwhite and black postmenopausal and 20- to 39-year-old\nwomen.\nData source\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) was conducted between 1988 and\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, to assess the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian non-institutionalized popu-\nlation of the United States. NHANES III data are freely\navailable for analysis.(21,22) The survey was based on a\nhighly stratified, multistage, probability sample design.\nSampling weights were developed to account for the com-\nplex survey design, survey nonresponse, and survey non-\nFor the postmenopausal women, we selected all non-\nHispanic postmenopausal (i.e., reported no menstrual period\nfor the previous 12 months) women who responded to\nquestions regarding childhood and teenage milk consump-\ntion. Women were excluded if information about weight,\nheight, age at menopause, or current calcium intake data\nwere missing. Bone densitometry had to be technically\nsatisfactory for inclusion in the study. NHANES III in-\ncluded 2086 non-Hispanic white (NHW) postmenopausal\nwomen, but 167 had technically unacceptable DXA tests, 1\nhad incomplete weight data, 149 were unsure of the date of\ntheir last menstrual period, 58 and 77 had incomplete teen-\nage and childhood milk consumption information, respec-\ntively, and 58 had incomplete calcium data. The survey also\nincluded 953 non-Hispanic black (NHB) postmenopausal\nwomen, but 124 had technically unacceptable DXA tests, 1\nhad incomplete weight information, 118 were unsure of the\ndate of their last menstrual period, 18 and 32 had incomplete\nteenage and childhood milk consumption information, re-\nspectively, and 22 had incomplete calcium intake data.\nAmong black women, those excluded were younger (p \n0.001), and they were less likely to have used oral contra-\nto have been physically active in the previous month (p \n0.005). A similar pattern held for excluded white women.\nThey were younger (p  0.001), less likely to have used\noral contraceptives (p  0.001) or hormone replacement\n(p  0.01), and less likely to have been physically active in\nthe previous month (p  0.03). Excluded white women\nwere also more likely to have breastfed (p  0.02). Other\nvariables, including level of childhood and teenage milk\nconsumption, were comparable between excluded and in-\ncluded women. The white postmenopausal women ranged\nin age from 22 to 90 years, and the black women ranged\nfrom 21 to 90 years of age.

There were no differences between the excluded\nand included black women in terms of age, BMI, hormone\nreplacement use, smoking, drinking, physical activity, or\nage milk consumption part of this study, whereas 904 NHW\nwere included to evaluate the effect of childhood milk\nconsumption.\nBone density measurements\nBone densitometry of the hip was performed on all non-\npregnant NHANES III participants 20 years of age or older.\nBone density was measured at five hip sites: femoral neck,\ntrochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's triangle, and total hip.\nAs recommended by the NHANES III documentation and\nthe International Society for Clinical Densitometry, our\nstudy did not use the data for Ward's triangle.(1) All mea-\nsurements were performed using the Hologic QDR 1000\nDXA machine (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA). A rigorous\nquality control program was maintained throughout the\nsurvey as documented by Wahner et al.(24) All DXA tests\nwere reviewed individually at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester,\nMN, USA) for technical evaluation before inclusion in the\ndatabase.\nDietary intake, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle\ncharacteristics\nNHANES III evaluated dietary intake using a 24-h di-\netary recall interview, and specific nutrient values were\nestimated. As a separate part of the NHANES III interview,\nparticipants were asked how much milk they drank as\nold). Participants chose from six levels of milk intake for\neach age range: none, less than one glass per week, one\nglass per week, between one glass per week and one glass\nper day, one glass per day, and more than one glass per day.\nBecause of potential misclassification and because subtle\ndifferences in milk intake are unlikely to have significant\nclinical effects, we stratified the responses into three cate-\ngories: less than 1 glass of milk per week (low), at least 1\nglass of milk per week but no more than 1 glass of milk\ndaily (intermediate), and greater than 1 glass of milk per day\n(high). The breakdown of milk consumption in the interme-\ndiate group was similar for blacks and whites both in the 20-\nto 39-year-old group and among postmenopausal women.\nFor example, 9.7% of NHW and 9.1% of NHB postmeno-\npausal women consumed one glass per week, 28.3% of\nNHW and 27.1% of NHB consumed between one glass per\nof NHB consumed one glass of milk per day as teenagers.\nThe figures were similar for childhood milk consumption,\nwith a higher proportion drinking one glass of milk daily\nParticipants were defined as having a history of oral\ncontraceptive pill use if they had ever taken birth control\npills for any reason and as having a history of hormone\nreplacement therapy if they had ever taken estrogen or\nfemale hormone pills other than oral contraceptive pills or\nhad used female hormone patches. Women were defined as\nhaving a history of breastfeeding if they had breastfed any\nof their children for at least 1 month. Participants were\ncategorized as having engaged in some form of physical\nactivity in the previous month if they reported one of the\nfollowing activities: jogging/running, bicycling, swimming,\ncalisthenics/exercising, aerobics or aerobic dancing,\ngardening/yard work, lifting weights, or any other exercises/\nsports.\nParticipants were defined as having smoked if they\nsmoked 100 or more cigarettes during their lifetime. Partic-\nipants were categorized as having a history of heavy alcohol\nuse if they reported that they consumed daily five or more\nalcoholic drinks regularly during their lifetime. Race was\ndefined as black or white using both self-report and family\nquestionnaires. Participants were asked their race (white,\nblack, other), and ethnicity (Mexican-American, Other His-\npanic, Not Hispanic). This study included all women who\nwere designated as either white or black, but were not\nHispanic.\nStatistical analysis\nWe analyzed two populations: postmenopausal and 20- to\n39-year-old women. The methods outlined below were ap-\nplied to each population individually. Multiple linear re-\ngression analysis was performed on each study population\n(including both NHW and NHB) to determine if there was\na racial difference in the effect of early milk consumption\non BMD. Models included a categorical race variable, an\ninteraction term between race and milk consumption, and\npotentially confounding variables. For the postmenopausal\nwomen, we repeated the interaction analyses, excluding\npotentially biased groups (previous diagnosis of osteoporo-\nsis, a history of hip fracture, or had taken thyroid hormones,\nanticonvulsants, systemic corticosteroids, or drugs primarily\naffecting calcium metabolism in the previous month). We\nfurther analyzed the effect of early milk consumption on\nBMD for each race individually. These analyses used the\nsame multiple linear regression models, excluding the race\nand interaction terms. The least-square means method was\nused to calculate the mean (SEM) BMD, by race, for\ngiven levels of childhood and teenage milk consumption at\neach site.\nThe multivariate analyses for the 20- to 39-year-old\nwomen included most of the covariates from the postmeno-\npausal model. Years since menopause was excluded for\nobvious reasons, as was a history of breastfeeding. Current\ncalcium intake was excluded because calcium intake in\nyoung adulthood is likely to correlate highly with early milk\nconsumption. Because many studies have shown that early\ncalcium consumption has a much greater effect on BMD\nthan young adult calcium intake, we felt that including this\nvariable would obscure real results, not control for a poten-\ntial confounder. All analyses were repeated controlling for\nage, controlling for both age and BMI, and controlling for\nthe full multivariate model. Because the results of the first\ntwo models were similar, only the results of the age and\nBMI model are reported.\nBaseline differences in clinically relevant variables be-\ntween milk consumption groups were analyzed using the 2\ntest and Student's t-test. All analyses were performed using\nSAS-callable SUDAAN 8.0 (Research Triangle Interna-\ntional, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), using the appro-\npriate sample weights and taking into account the stratified\nsurvey design.\nRESULTS\nPostmenopausal women\nDescriptive statistics for postmenopausal women, by race\nand milk consumption, are shown in Table 1. For both races,\nthose who reported drinking more milk during childhood\nhad significantly higher current calcium intake. Black\nwomen in the higher milk intake groups were more likely to\nhave used hormone replacement. For white women, those\nwith higher milk intake were more likely to have breastfed\na child and were more likely to have been physically active\nin the prior month. Higher teenage milk consumption also\ncorrelated with higher calcium intake, more physical activ-\nity, and breastfeeding among white women, in addition to a\nhigher probability of using hormone replacement. Reported\nteen milk intake was not correlated with calcium intake\namong the postmenopausal black women, but was associ-\nated with higher probability of breastfeeding. There were\nalso differences between the NHB and NHW postmeno-\npausal women. NHB women had a higher prevalence of\nprevalence of physical activity in the past month (51.8%\ndaily calcium intake was significantly lower than white\nWhite Black\nglass/week Intermediate\nglass/day p\nglass/week Intermediate\nglass/day p\nChildhood\nYears since\nmenopause\ncigarettes\nUsed oral\ncontraceptive pills\nPhysical activity\n(past month)\nUsed hormone\nreplacement\nCurrent calcium\nintake (mg/day)\nTeenage\nYears since\nmenopause\ncigarettes\nUsed oral\ncontraceptive pills\nPhysical activity\n(past month)\nUsed hormone\nreplacement\nCurrent calcium\nintake (mg/day)\n* Baseline differences between milk consumption groups for relevant categorical were analyzed using the 2 test, while continuous variables were\ncompared with the value of the 1 glass/week group using the unpaired Student's t-test, using appropriate sample weights and incorporating the stratified\nsurvey design.\nwomen in the highest childhood or teenage milk intake\ncategory had even lower current daily calcium intake than\nwhites in the lowest milk intake group (for childhood, 519\ntrolled for all of these variables in the multivariate analyses\nreported below, and therefore, these specific differences\ncannot account for our results. However, this widespread\nand significant variation highlights the complexity of study-\ning racial differences. Factors unimportant in investigations\nof relatively homogenous populations may significantly\nconfound studies of diverse populations.\nTo determine if race modified the effect of early milk\nconsumption on postmenopausal BMD, we used a regres-\nsion model including an interaction term between race and\nreported milk intake. The results are shown in Table 2.\nControlling for age and BMI, the teenage interaction term\nwas significant at all sites (p  0.01\u00ad0.04). This association\nwas attenuated in the full multivariate model, but the inter-\naction term remained significant at three of the sites (p \n0.02\u00ad0.03) and was of borderline significance at the femoral\nneck (p  0.05). While the interaction term did not reach\nstatistical significance at any site for childhood milk con-\nsumption in the limited model, it did approach significance\nchanter, and intertrochanter) in the multivariate model.\nThese results suggest that, in terms of postmenopausal\nBMD, whites benefit more from teenage, and possibly\nchildhood, milk consumption than blacks do.\nAll interaction analyses were repeated, excluding poten-\ntially biased groups as noted previously. The changes in\nstatistical significance were minimal. While interactions at\nfive sites became slightly less significant, the p values at all\naffected sites were still 0.10. Conversely, some borderline\nsignificant (p  0.05) after excluding potentially biased\ngroups. Excluding users of systemic corticosteroids en-\nhanced the significance of the teenage milk intake by race\ninteraction at the femoral neck (p  0.05) and the childhood\nmilk intake by race interaction at the total hip (p  0.05).\nExcluding women who reported a previous hip fracture also\nimproved the significance of the childhood milk intake by\nrace interaction at the total hip (p  0.05).\nRacial subgroup analysis was performed to investigate\nthe effect of early milk consumption on postmenopausal\nBMD for each race individually. The regression coefficients\nof multiple linear regression models of postmenopausal\nBMD on reported teenage milk consumption controlling for\nage and BMI are shown in Table 2. At all sites, white\nwomen with the highest milk intake had significantly higher\nBMD than those in the lowest category of milk intake, and\nthere was a significant linear trend toward higher BMD with\nhigher milk intake at all sites. Interestingly, among black\nwomen childhood and teenage milk consumption had a\nnegative, albeit statistically insignificant, effect on post-\nmenopausal BMD. Once again, controlling for the nine\nadditional variables listed previously (see right side of Table\n2) lessened the statistical significance of these findings, but\nthe higher milk intake groups still tended to have higher\nBMD among white women (all p  0.10). The linear effect\nbecame less pronounced, and there seemed to be a plateau\neffect of milk consumption, with similar BMD values for\nthe intermediate and highest milk intake groups. The effect\nof childhood milk consumption on BMD among white\nwomen was somewhat less clear than the effect of teenage\nmilk consumption. The values of the coefficients for child-\nhood milk consumption were similar to those seen with\nteenage milk consumption, but the statistical significance\nwas lower, likely because of the smaller number of subjects\nconsuming little or no milk during childhood. Only two\nsites showed a significant linear relationship among whites\n(trochanter and total hip) after controlling for age and BMI.\nAt all sites, however, white women with the highest milk\nintake had significantly higher BMD than those in the\nlowest group. Once again, the signs of the coefficients for\nwhites and blacks were reversed, with milk consumption\nhaving a positive effect on BMD among white women and\na negative, although statistically insignificant, effect among\nblack women.\nLeast-square means were calculated for white and black\npostmenopausal women by reported teenage milk consump-\ntion and are shown in Fig. 1. For white women, the mean\nBMD, adjusting for covariates, seems to increase with\nhigher milk intake, whereas this is not the case among the\nblack women.\nWe repeated our analyses on the 20- to 39-year-old\nwomen participating in NHANES III. Descriptive statistics\nfor this population, by race and childhood and teenage milk\nintake, are shown in Table 3.\nThere were no racial differences in the prevalence of\nheavy alcohol use (black, 6.4% versus white, 6.3%, p \n0.31) between black and white women in this population.\nHowever, there were other racial differences. Blacks had a\nlower prevalence of physical activity in the past month\n0.001). Black women's current daily calcium intake was\nThe interaction between childhood milk consumption and\nrace was not significant at any site in either the limited or\nfull multivariate models, but the corresponding interaction\nfor teenage milk consumption trended toward significance\ntwo of four sites, after controlling for age and BMI, and at\none site in the full multivariate model (see Table 4). White\nwomen in the highest milk intake group had significantly\nhigher BMD than women in the lowest intake group at all\nsites. Similar to our results from postmenopausal women,\nmilk consumption had no significant effect on BMD at any\nsite analyzed among the black women.\nLeast-square means were calculated for white and black\nwomen by reported teenage milk consumption and are\nshown in Fig. 2. For white women, the mean BMD, adjust-\ning for covariates, at each of these sites is significantly\nhigher among those drinking more milk. There is no such\ndifference among the black women. Once again, white\nwomen seems to benefit from drinking more milk as teen-\nagers, whereas blacks do not. Of note, blacks had higher\npeak and postmenopausal BMD at all sites, independently\nof childhood or teenage milk consumption status.\nDISCUSSION\nBlacks have lower calcium intake during both childhood\nand adulthood than whites.(25) However, despite chronically\nlower calcium intake than white women, black women have\nControlling for age and BMI Full multivariate model\nWhite\ncoefficient\nBlack\ncoefficient\nInteraction\np value\nWhite\ncoefficient\nBlack\ncoefficient\nInteraction\np value\nChildhood\nTotal hip\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nTrochanter\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nIntertrochanter\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nFemoral neck\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nTeenage\nTotal hip\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nTrochanter\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nIntertrochanter\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\nFemoral neck\n1 glass/week Reference Reference Reference Reference\n* The childhood milk intake analysis included 1656 white women and 725 black women, while teenage milk intake analysis included 1675 white women\nand 735 black women. Of the white women, 131 and 208 consumed less than one glass of milk per week as children and teenagers, respectively. The\ncorresponding figures were 51 and 87 for the black women.\n The full multivariate model included milk intake (three levels), age, BMI, hormone replacement (ever used), oral contraceptives (ever used), years since\nmenopause, smoking (ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes), alcohol consumption (heavy use), physical activity (at least once in past month), breast\nfeeding (ever feeding for 1 month), pregnancy (ever), and current daily calcium intake.\n Race  milk intake.\na much lower prevalence of osteoporosis and osteope-\nnia.(1,26) Until the results of this study, however, there was\nno information in blacks on the relationship between child-\nhood and teenage milk consumption and BMD in their adult\nyears. The results of this analysis indicate that the expected\npositive relationship between early milk consumption and\nBMD is not demonstrable among black women.\nOur results show a significant racial difference in the\neffect of early, especially teenage, milk consumption on\npeak and postmenopausal bone density. As demonstrated by\nprevious studies, white women benefit significantly from\nchildhood and teenage milk consumption, but our observa-\ntions suggest that black women derive no such benefit.\nSeveral plausible mechanisms to explain these observations\nare worthy of comment.\nLactose intolerance is common among blacks. Milk con-\nsumption in lactose intolerant individuals may decrease\ntransit time, thereby reducing calcium absorption and the\nabsorption of other nutrients essential for skeletal health.\nHowever, multiple studies have demonstrated that lactose-\nintolerant individuals absorb calcium from milk normally,\nor at least sufficiently.(27\u00ad29) Furthermore, there is specific\nevidence that lactose-intolerant black female adolescents\nadapt to high-lactose diets with a reduction in symptoms\nassociated with lactose consumption.(30) However, milk\nconsumption over a prolonged or developmentally critical\nperiod of time among lactose-intolerant subjects may affect\ncalcium absorption or metabolism in entirely different ways\nfrom the published reports. Additionally, investigation of\ncalcium absorption in lactose-intolerant individuals has fo-\ncused on white women, raising the possibility that blacks\nwith lactose intolerance may adapt differently.\nGenetic diversity may play a role in explaining the dem-\nonstrated racial differences. For example, polymorphisms in\nthe vitamin D receptor are thought by some to be associated\nwith a marked effect on bone density among white\nwomen(31) and may affect calcium absorption among chil-\ndren.(32) The same polymorphisms, while present in a large\nproportion of black women, do not seem to be correlated\nwith bone density among black women.(31,33) Undoubtedly,\nother genetic distinctions will be of interest when they are\nelucidated.\nDietary interactions between calcium and other minerals\nand nutrients(34\u00ad36) are unlikely to account for the negative\ncorrelation between early milk consumption and bone den-\nsity in black women, but differences in calcium homeostasis\nmay provide a clue toward explaining our results. Black\nchildren and teenagers seem to absorb calcium more effi-\nciently.(37,38) Furthermore, blacks retain more calcium, as\ndemonstrated by lower 24-h urinary calcium excre-\ntion.(14\u00ad18) Vitamin D and PTH have a different physiology\nin blacks, reflecting a picture similar to secondary hyper-\nparathyroidism. Serum 25(OH)D lower and serum 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D and PTH concentrations are lower\namong blacks.(14\u00ad16,18) Nevertheless, bone turnover is lower\namong blacks.(39) Lower bone turnover and greater calcium\nretention may tend to negate the importance of low calcium\nintake among blacks. Alternatively, high calcium intake\nearly in life may interfere with the development of this\nhighly efficient calcium conservation metabolism, and thus\nput these black women at greater risk for age-related and\npostmenopausal bone loss. Of course, milk is a complex\nfood and contains nutrients besides calcium, which may\naffect bone mass, such as phosphorus, protein, and vitamin\nFIG. 1.

Plausibly, racial variation in the responsiveness to or\nmetabolism of these or other constituents in milk might play\na role in explaining these results.\nMilk consumption in childhood may not only directly\nhelp in the accrual of peak bone mass. It may also be\nbeneficial by establishing a pattern of milk consumption that\nlasts throughout life. Our results support this assertion. Milk\nconsumption in childhood correlates well with milk con-\nsumption and calcium intake later in life for both black and\nwhite women. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that\ndespite much lower average calcium intake, black women\nhave higher bone density than white women. This suggests\nthat calcium intake in general may not play as pivotal a role\nin bone health for black women as it does for whites. Other\nphysiological factors, some of which have been listed, may\nbe dominant and thereby limit the importance of early milk\nintake among blacks on bone mass.\nThis study has several limitations. The history of milk\nconsumption was self-reported, and for the postmenopausal\nwomen, were recalled behaviors of 45\u00ad55 years before the\nsurvey. Nevertheless, distant dietary recall has consistently\nproven superior to current diet as a predictor of historical\ndiet.(40\u00ad44) Furthermore, recall of milk intake correlates well\nwith historical intake, with correlation coefficients ranging\nfrom 0.47 to 0.58. In addition to recall history, recall bias is\nanother potential limitation of our study. In this case, how-\never, a recall bias would have to correlate milk consumption\nwith BMD differentially by race, positively for whites and\nnegatively for blacks, to produce the reported results. Bone\ndensity testing was in its infancy at the time of this study\nand few women in the population had previously undergone\nbone density testing. To affect the results, the few women\npreviously tested would have had to remember their bone\ndensities and associate these values with early milk con-\nsumption, a most unlikely scenario.\nWhile we were able to control for concurrent potentially\nconfounding variables, we could not address associations\nbetween early milk consumption and potentially confound-\ning factors during childhood or teenage years. For example,\nchildhood milk consumption may be positively associated\nwith childhood physical activity in one racial group but\nnegatively correlated in the other.

Thus, while our results show racial variation in the\neffect of milk on bone density, these findings cannot be\ndirectly related to bone strength or fracture risk. Nor do they\ninfer that milk doesn't have important effects on these other\nparameters in black and white women.\nA final noteworthy limitation refers to the possibility that\nthe classification of regular milk drinkers differed between\nblacks and whites. It is conceivable that white children in\nthe highest category of milk consumption ingested much\nmore milk than the black children in the same, highest,\ncategory of milk consumption. This concern would also\nhave to assume the ingestion of milk, and therefore calcium,\nin the black children, even in this highest intake category,\nwas below the threshold for optimal calcium absorption.\nThis study has several major advantages over previous\nstudies addressing this issue. First, the sample size is large,\nand the survey population, as appropriately weighted, is\nrepresentative of the entire United States population. Previ-\nous studies recruited subjects from smaller geographic ar-\neas, limiting the generalizabilty of their results. Second,\nNHANES III used rigorous quality control measures to\nensure the validity of BMD measurements. In fact, these\ndata were used to develop the universal reference values for\nhip BMD measurements. Third, data on multiple potential\nconfounding factors were collected, allowing us to control\nfor all six important confounders noted by Weinsier.(5)\nFurthermore, two adult populations were used to support\nthe validity of our findings: young and postmenopausal\nwomen. Any confounding factor, such as childhood physi-\ncal activity, unaccounted for in the analyses above, would\nhave to be similar for these two generations of women.\nThese consistent results suggest that the racial difference in\nresponse to early milk consumption seen in postmenopausal\nwomen have their origins much earlier and persist through-\nout life.\nIn conclusion, there are racial differences in the effect of\nearly milk consumption on peak and postmenopausal bone\ndensity. Our results do not diminish the well-documented\nand essential role of adequate calcium intake in a variety of\nskeletal health issues. In fact, this study supports an impor-\ntant role for early milk and calcium consumption in pro-\nmoting lifelong bone health among white women. While the\nphysiological mechanisms underlying the differences\namong whites and blacks remain to be identified, the public\nhealth implications are clear. Universal recommendations\nfor dairy product consumption are based on incomplete data\nand should be reconsidered pending rigorous investigation\nof the effects of dairy products on bone health among racial\nand ethnic minorities.\n"
