What I refer to here as \"political contex-\ntual\" effects such as national election issues and the influence\nof party leaders in championing or rejecting political issues at\nan election (action on climate change is a contemporary\nexample) may have implications for the measurement of post-\nmaterial values. I contend that lengthy national election cam-\npaigns in countries such as Australia and the United States\nmay produce the equivalent of what Inglehart refers to as\n2005), and influence the estimation of postmaterial values.\nRonald Inglehart's thesis of the \"Silent Revolution\" of value\nchange is one of the most influential claims in political science\nInglehart & Welzel, 2005) argues that the value priorities of\ncitizens (i.e., their \"broad societal goals\") in advanced industri-\nalized countries have been shifting since the end of World War\nII, from concern over the economy and physical security\n(\"materialism\") toward an emphasis upon quality of life (\"post-\nmaterialism\"). Inglehart's thesis is based upon two hypotheses\nrelated to the concepts of scarcity and socialization.\nInglehart (1997) claims \"[A]n individual's priorities\nreflect the socioeconomic environment: one places the great-\nest subjective value on those things that are in relatively\nshort supply\" (p. 33). Influenced by Maslow's needs hierar-\nvive, people must first have their basic material needs\nsatisfied, such as food, shelter, and physical safety. When\nbasic materialist needs have been satisfied and material secu-\nrity is achieved, people are free to explore higher order\nneeds, such as improving their quality of life. Citizens of\naffluent countries are increasingly likely to pursue higher\norder goals leading \"to a gradual shift in which needs for\nbelonging, esteem, and intellectual aesthetic satisfaction\nbecame more prominent\" (p. 34). In Inglehart's terminology,\ncitizens of affluent nations have become more \"postmaterial-\nist.\" The socialization element of Inglehart's thesis suggests\nthat those born in advanced industrialized nations after World\nWar II have grown up under relatively affluent conditions\ncompared with their parents and grandparents. On average,\npostwar generations are claimed to be far more postmaterial-\nist than their predecessors. This trend toward postmaterial-\nism has continued (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005), so that since\nthe end of the World War II, citizens of advanced industrial-\nized countries have become increasingly postmaterialist.\n1University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nBruce Tranter, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 22, Hobart, Tasmania\nEmail: Bruce.Tranter@utas.edu.au\nThe Impact of Political Context on the\nMeasurement of Postmaterial Values\nBruce Tranter1\n Keywords\npostmaterial, values, Australia, political context, Australian election study, election issues, political\n2 SAGE Open\nThese patterns are tendencies, as large proportions of citi-\nzens are classified as \"materialists\" by Inglehart, but typi-\ncally, younger cohorts in advanced democracies are more\npostmaterial than their older counterparts, with the propor-\ntion of postmaterialists increasing over time (Inglehart, 1997;\nInglehart & Welzel, 2005). Inglehart does not claim that\npostmaterialists are non-materialistic or that they are not\nconcerned about physical security or the economy (Inglehart,\n1997). Rather, with their material needs reasonably satisfied,\nthey are free to pursue postmaterial goals, such as supporting\nenvironmental protection, human, women's, and minority\nrights.\nMeasuring Value Orientations\nInglehart measures value orientations using two batteries of\nsurvey questions. The first is referred to as the \"four-item\nindex\" or \"short values index\" consisting of questions that\nask respondents to prioritize four items. The short values\nindex is used extensively by survey researchers, for example,\nin the World Values Surveys (WVS), the International Social\nScience Program (ISSP) surveys, and the Australian Election\nStudy (AES) surveys.1\nCritics of Inglehart often take issue with the way he mea-\nsures value orientations, commonly attacking the validity of\nthe materialism\u00adpostmaterialism index (e.g., Bean &\nKornberg, McIntyre, Bauer-Kaase, & Kaase, 1999; D. W.\nexample, Clarke and Dutt (1991) find high unemployment is\nassociated with increased levels of postmaterial values,\nrather than decreases as the values change thesis predicts.\nDuch and Taylor (1993) argue that the short values index\nmeasures pro-democratic orientations, whereas Warwick\n(1998) finds \"that the original index registers support for\ndemocratic principals in particular, and not simply a more\ngeneral postmaterialism\" (p. 603). More recently, Clarke\n(2000) maintains the short index is a \"seriously flawed\ninstrument for measuring values and value change in\nadvanced industrial (and other) societies\" because of its\n\"sensitivity to prevailing economic conditions\" (p. 481),\nwhereas Tranter and Western (2010) suggest the short index\nis subject to question order effects that influence estimates of\nvalues orientations.\nNevertheless, Inglehart and his colleagues have defended\nthe value shift thesis vigorously (e.g., Abramson, Ellis, &\nInglehart (1997) maintains the short index \"has proven to be\nwhereas Inglehart and Abramson (1994) contend that on \"the\nusual tests of validity\" the index \"has performed remarkably\nwell\" and the \"dimensional structure of the measure . . . has\na theoretically coherent structure across a wide range of\nResearch Aims\nThis research is not a critique of Inglehart's values change\nthesis per se, but attempts to show that estimations of post-\nmaterial values based upon Inglehart's widely applied\nshort values index are subject to the influence of political\nevents. The point of departure here is not in attacking the\nconceptualization or measurement of postmaterialist value\norientations, but examining how Inglehart's values mea-\nsures are influenced by important political issues and\nleader effects that are present around national elections. I\ncontend that \"political context\" must be accounted for,\nbecause, as Inglehart (1981) suggests, \"Period effects\"\n(p. 887)--short-term influences on values such as varia-\ntions in the inflation and unemployment rates--influence\nthe measurement of value orientations. Period effects may\nsuppress, or alternatively, boost levels of societal postma-\nterial values at particular times, but according to Inglehart\ndo not influence the underlying values formed during early\nsocialization.\nThe posited effect examined here arises because of the\nway in which value orientations are measured. Arguably,\nall four items in the short index (see Appendix A), both\nthe materialist items \"maintain order in the nation\" and\n\"fight rising prices,\" and the postmaterialist items \"give\npeople more say in important government decisions\" and\n\"protect freedom of speech,\" are likely to be influenced\nduring election campaigns. The \"maintain order\" item\nrelates to bread and butter political issues and national and\nstate security. Although security issues are frequently of\nconcern to governments, they have become even more\nsalient in recent years with the so-called \"war on terror-\nism.\" Similarly, border security is a highly publicized\nissue in many affluent countries faced with increasing\nnumbers of refugees seeking asylum, such as Australia.\nInglehart's \"rising prices\" item is clearly associated with\ninflation, but perhaps also more broadly with economic\nmanagement.\nImportantly, all of Inglehart's question items tap perennial\npolitical concerns. However, such concerns are increasingly\nimportant and visible, even to less politically engaged citi-\nzens, during national election campaigns when the voting\npublic is bombarded with mass media coverage of salient\npolitical issues. For example, in recent federal election cam-\npaigns in Australia, election issues included border security\n(e.g., \"turn back the boats\") and economic management/cli-\nmate change issues (e.g., \"stop the carbon tax\"; Bean,\nMcAllister, & Pietsch, 2014). Responses to relevant items on\nthe values index are therefore very likely to be influenced\nduring national elections.\nThe main aims of this research can be summarized in the\nfollowing research questions:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent does \"political con-\ntext\" influence the measurement of postmaterial values?\nResearch Question 2: Can political influences account\nfor Australia's lower than expected levels of postmaterial-\nist values (i.e., as expected under Inglehart's values\nchange thesis)?\nData and Method\nData analyzed here are from the AES surveys from 1990 to\nJones, Denemark, & Gow, 1993; Jones, McAllister, & Gow,\nBean, McAllister and Pietsch 2014). These data are system-\natically sampled from the Australian Electoral Roll, a list of\nall Australians registered to vote in federal elections. AES\nsurveys are administered via mail with several follow-up\nstrategies to maximize responses. Further details of these\nsurveys, including response rates, are available at the AES\nsite (http://aes.anu.edu.au/).\nmeasures postmaterial values with a four-item question,\nwhere respondents are asked to prioritize the two most\nimportant aims of the nation. The values questions as they\nappear in the AES are shown in Appendix A. In the WVS, the\nshort index items appear as the second set of questions in a\nlonger values battery. In the AES, the longer values battery is\nadministered on occasion, however, in such cases the short\nindex items appear first, in contrast to the WVS. This is a\npreferable form of administering these questions, because as\nTranter and Western (2010) have shown, a question order\neffect arises that tends to inflate levels of postmaterial values\nwhen the short index questions appear in the middle of the\nlonger values battery.\nOrdinary least squares (OLS) regression is used in the\nanalyses below, following Abramson et al. (1997). Primarily\nOLS is used here for ease of comparison of the results. The\nstrategy in the tables containing regression estimates below\nis to first present what Inglehart (1997) refers to as the\n\"materialist-postmaterialist percentage difference index\"\n(PDI; p. 134) for various years. Several controls are then\nintroduced to adjust for aspects of social background--age\n(years),3 sex (1 = men), and education level (1 = degree) and\nthe impact of political context.4 The rationale for the latter is\ndescribed in detail in the next section.\nTechnically, the intercept from the OLS regression mod-\nels is analogous to the PDI. That is, the multiple regression\nmodels estimate the PDI for each AES survey from 1990 to\n2013, where the PDI-dependent variable is regressed upon\nseveral independent variables to adjust for political context\nat each federal election. PDI estimates from four regression\nmodels are presented in Table 4 to show the adjusted PDI,\nafter controlling for social background (Model 1), political\nissues (Model 2), leader thermometers (Model 3), and politi-\ncal party ID (Model 4).5\nElection Issues, Party Leaders, Party\nID, and Political Context\nMeasuring postmaterial values with data from election sur-\nveys is potentially problematic when values are measured\nwith the short values index. That is, the issues discussed dur-\ning election campaigns may influence responses to the val-\nues index, because the issues that typically emerge during\nelection campaigns tend to be associated with the items com-\nprising Inglehart's short index. For example, economic issues\nalmost always tend to be high on the agenda of political par-\nties in advanced industrialized nations. In Australia (and\nelsewhere), border security has in the last decade or so been\nan issue of contention for the major parties, both under the\nconservative party leadership of current Prime Minister Tony\nAbbott and John Howard before him (Devetak, 2004; Noble,\n2005) and also under recent Labor governments led by Julia\nGillard and Kevin Rudd. Economic and security issues\nshould be associated with \"materialist\" values, as measured\nby Inglehart's \"maintain order in the nation\" and \"fight rising\nprices\" items.\nAlthough the relative salience of election issues varies\nfrom one election to the next, several issues have been\nimportant during campaigns in the period under consider-\nlected in the AES during this period, with economic\nmanagement, and health and education the most important in\nrecent elections. The importance of taxation and (un)employ-\nment vary according to prevailing economic circumstances\nwhile the environment (and more recently, global warming)\nhas also been a relatively important issue in recent years. For\nexample, during the \"green\" election of 1990 (Bean,\n29% of those sampled chose interest rates as the issue of\ngreatest concern, 18% inflation, and 11% selected the envi-\nronment, taxation, and unemployment, respectively, whereas\nof the sample chose management of the economy as the most\nimportant issue, followed by 17% who opted for health and\nMedicare and 14% for education.\nAlthough I am not able to offer a control/test experimental\ndesign to examine the hypothesis that political context influ-\nences responses on the short values index, another way of\nexamining this hypothesized effect is to consider associations\nbetween political issues and postmaterialism using data from\nthe most recent AES. A cross tabulation is presented using\ndata from the 2013 AES (Table 1). Based upon responses to\nthe question \"Which of these issues was most important to\nyou during the election campaign?\" it is apparent that \"mate-\nrialists\" tend to prioritize economic issues (i.e., taxation,\nmanagement of the economy), whereas postmaterialists are\n4 SAGE Open\nmore concerned with issues such as the environment, global\nwarming, and education. However, because election issues\ntend to vary over time, as does the relative salience of peren-\nnial issues, the election issue questions included in each AES\nalso vary, making consistent operationalization of election\nissues problematic over time.6 The small number of relevant\nelection issue question items available for analysis across all\nelections analyzed means that some measures of political\ncontext are missed. I therefore also examine the influence of\nthree proxy variables of political context based upon voter\nevaluations of major party leaders and political party\nidentification.\nAs the literature on political party identification indicates,\npolitical leaders offer voters cues about complex political\nissues. Party identification is claimed to form a \"perceptual\nscreen through which the individual tends to see what is\nfavourable to his partisan orientation\" (Campbell, Converse,\ndealignment thesis suggests there has been a weakening of\npartisan loyalties (Dalton, 1996; Dalton, Flanagan, & Beck,\n1984), partisanship remains a powerful predictor of voting in\nGilens and Murakawa (2002) arguing that partisans take the\ncues of political leaders more frequently than engage in\n\"substantive assessment of competing evidence and argu-\nments\" (p. 21). In Australia, although the major parties both\nvie for public acceptance as stewards of the economy, AES\ndata suggest the conservative coalition partners tend to have\ngreater public acceptance in terms of their credibility on eco-\nnomic management. Labor has historically been associated\nwith stronger policies on health, education, and industrial\nrelations, and, along with the Australian Greens (although to\na lesser extent) with the environment. I contend that feelings\nthermometer variables that measure voter evaluations of\npolitical party leaders, to an extent also capture variations in\nthe political issues that are prioritized from one election to\nthe next. In addition to the four issue priority variables, the\npolitical leader variables act as supplementary measures of\npolitical context at each federal election.\nThe AES presents a variety of possibilities for measuring\nvoter evaluations of respective political leaders. Questions\nhave been included in all AES from 1990 onwards regarding\nthe qualities of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the\nOpposition (and on occasions, other political leaders). Such\nquestions ask respondents to rate leader qualities such as\ntheir honesty, intelligence, strength of leadership, knowl-\nedge, trustworthiness, competence, and so on. However,\nthese questions have not been asked in a consistent manner\nover time, so that only relatively few comparable items\nthermometer\" questions have appeared in every election sur-\nvey from 1990 onwards. For example, the \"feelings ther-\nWe would like to know your feelings about the party leaders.\nPlease show how you feel about them by circling a number from\n0 to 10. 10 is the highest rating, for people you feel very\nfavorable about, and 0 is the lowest rating, for people you feel\nvery unfavorable about. If you are neutral about a particular\nperson or don't know much about them, you should give them a\nrating of 5.\nHow do you feel about: Bob Hawke? How do you feel about:\nAndrew Peacock?\nFor analytical consistency, the feelings thermometer vari-\nables are operationalized to measure the impact of political\nleaders upon value orientations at each federal election.\nAlthough these questions ask what voters \"feel\" about the\nmajor party leaders and do not capture the multidimensional-\nity of leadership qualities, they serve as a useful proxy vari-\nable to capture voter evaluations of leaders. Evidence of this\nis apparent in the high correlations between multiple item\ncomposite leader scales constructed from various leader\nquality items and the single item 0 to 10 scales. For example,\nTable 1.

Australian Election Study (2013).\nNote. Subscript letters that vary across each row denote significance at p < .05 or better.\ncomposite scales constructed from items measuring Labor\nand Coalition leader characteristics using 2010 AES data\nhave strong Pearson's correlations with the party leader ther-\nmometers (i.e., the Pearson's r for the coalition leader vari-\nable is .76 and Labor leader is .78).7 Feelings thermometer\nvariables for the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition\nat each federal election are therefore used as an additional\nmeasure of political context in the analyses that follow. This\napproach has the advantage of applying consistent indicators\nto capture the influence upon value orientation estimates of\nthe two most important major party leaders at each federal\nelection.\nSimilarly, it is important to add political party identifica-\ntion as a control for \"rusted on\" partisans who may be aligned\nwith particular election issues. Party identification is opera-\ntionalized as Liberal and National party supporters scored 1;\nother parties and the non-aligned scored 2 and Labor identi-\nfiers scored 3. Placing the Australian Greens at the midpoint\nof the party ID scale given they are a party of the postmate-\npotentially problematic here. The Greens formed as a national\nparty in 1992. However, while a \"Greens\" party ID response\ncategory was included in the 1990 AES, it was omitted in\n1993, although the number of respondents identifying as\nGreens continued to be very low throughout the 1990s.\nTherefore, once again for consistency, Green identifiers are\ncoded to the midpoint of the party ID scale.\nAnalyses\nTable 2 shows the percentage responses for materialists,\npostmaterialists, and those who hold mixed values based\ncalculated to gauge the relative levels of postmaterial versus\nmaterial values. Positive PDI results suggest that the propor-\ntion of postmaterialists is greater than the proportion of\nmaterialists in a given election year, with negative PDI indi-\ncating a preponderance of materialists over postmaterialists.\nAccording to these results, Australia is not and has never\nbeen a \"postmaterialist\" country during the period examined\nAustralia was quite a materialist country around 20 years\nand 1998, the proportions of materialists and postmaterialists\nwere evenly balanced. However, in the new millennium, the\nresults indicate that Australia has been shifting back to the\nmaterialist than two decades earlier.\nThese results are not necessarily contrary to what is\nexpected according to Inglehart's thesis. Inglehart allows for\nfluctuations in value priorities due to changing economic cir-\ncumstances (e.g., increases to inflation rates) that he refers to\nas \"period effects,\" and claims that these may have a short-\nterm impact upon the PDI. Yet he argues that serious social\nand economic events such as major wars or economic depres-\nsion (or their lack) shape the value orientations of genera-\ntions, particularly during their \"formative years.\"\nFurthermore, the values change thesis implies that younger\npeople tend to become more materialist than their parents if\nthey experience severe long-term economic downturns or\nthreats to their physical security during their formative years.\nHowever, neither of these scenarios appears to explain the\nAustralian case.\nAustralia, with its strong economy and having arguably\nbenefitted from the economic stimulus package introduced\nby the Rudd Government, has enjoyed relatively favorable\neconomic circumstances since the recession of the early\n1990s and appears to have been relatively insulated from the\nglobal financial crisis (GFC). Although these results indicate\nthat the GFC has had an impact upon PDI in Australia,\ntoward materialism appears to have begun even earlier, as is\napparent in the dips toward the materialist pole in 2001 and\nHowever, other national survey data suggest thatAustralia\nis a far more postmaterialist country than the AES data indi-\ncate (Table 3). With the exception of the 2011 WVS data that\nalso likely reflect \"period effects\" due to the GFC, other ear-\nlier WVS, AuSSA, and ISSP data suggest Australia tends\ntoward the postmaterialist pole. Nevertheless, the anomalous\ncomment. The former appears to under-represent materialists\nand over-represent mixed values compared with other sur-\nveys in this series, resulting in a slight postmaterialist PDI\nunlike other surveys in Table 3, the 1994 ISSP sample\nNote. PDI = percentage difference index.\n6 SAGE Open\ncomprises a panel from an earlier ISSP survey (Kelley,\nEvans, & Bean, 1995), so panel attrition may have had an\nimpact upon the values estimates for 1994.8 There may also\nbe sampling and other issues underlying the extreme postma-\nquestions were administered as part of the longer values\nindex, and as mentioned above, Tranter and Western (2010)\nfind that this approach inflates levels of postmaterial relative\nto material values estimates. The sampling approach used for\nthe WVS is also potentially influential here.9 It is therefore\npossible that question ordering effects and different sampling\nstrategies have contributed to the anomalous values results\nfor the 1995 WVS compared with other surveys in Table 3.\nNevertheless, data from the AES are at odds with those\nfrom other national surveys that use similar mail out designs\nand sampling frames (i.e., AES and AuSSA samples are both\ndrawn from the Australian Electoral Roll using systematic\nsampling). What is clearly different is that the AES are post-\nelection surveys, and responses to the short values index\nappear to have been influenced by election campaigns.\nTo what extent, then, do election issue priorities and\nleader variables influence the PDI in the multivariate case,\nthat is, after controlling for known correlates of value orien-\ntations, respondent sex, age, and educational achievement?\nPDI for each election from 1990 onwards are presented in\nTable 4. The results of four OLS regression models for each\nyear are also presented. The first model shows PDI after con-\ntrolling for sex (men 1, women 0), age (measured as a con-\ntinuous variable in years), and degree (1/0). The second\nmodel adds the four issue priority dummy variables, the third\nmodel adds 0 to 10 major party leader \"feeling thermome-\nters,\" and the fourth political party identification scale in\ncombination are included to adjust PDI for political context.\nThe results in Table 4 indicate that the background variables\nin Model 1 have some impact upon the PDI, swaying the PDI\nconsiderably toward postmaterialism in some years, such as\nduction of political issues variables in Model 2 tends to shift\nthe PDI back toward the materialist pole, although the shift\nin some cases is modest. However, when the leader ther-\nmometer variables are added to the regression equation in\nModel 3, the regression estimates of PDI are far less materi-\nalist than the original PDI.10 In fact after controlling for the\nproxy measures of political context--political issues and\nleader effects--the adjusted PDI for Australia becomes posi-\ntive in six of the nine election years analyzed, compared with\nthe original estimates that were all negative. Overall, this\npattern persists after party identification is added (Model 4).\nSurvey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA; 2003).\nNote. PDI is the percentage of postmaterialists minus percentage of materialists calculated from 4-item index. Missing responses coded to the \"Mixed\"\ncategory. PDI = percentage difference index.\nTable 4. Political Context and Percentage Difference Index (OLS).\nNote. Dependent variable is 4-item values index coded as PDI where postmaterialist = 100, mixed = 0, materialist = -100. PDI estimates in Table 4\nvary slightly to Tables 2 and 3 as the latter were calculated based on materialist and postmaterial figures rounded to first decimal place. Models 1 to 4\ncoefficients represent regression intercepts for each year when the following independent variables are introduced. Model 1 = sex (1 = men), age (years),\nand tertiary degree (1 = degree); Model 2 = Model 1 + political issue dummy variables (taxation = 1, education = 1, the environment = 1, health = 1);\nModel 3 = Model 2 + labor and coalition leader 0 to 10 scales; Model 4 = Model 3 + Party Identification scale (1 = Liberals + Nationals; 2 = no party ID\nor other party; 3 = Labor). OLS = ordinary least squares; PDI = percentage difference index.\nThe regression results suggest that political context does\nindeed influence the measurement of value orientations as\nmeasured with Inglehart's short values index. In the\nAustralian case, for all the election surveys the PDI becomes\nless materialist when political context is controlled, implying\nthat the measurement of value orientations during or soon\nafter election campaigns is potentially problematic. The\ninfluence of political context upon value orientations is more\nclearly demonstrated in Figure 1, where the PDI and adjusted\nPDI are portrayed graphically over time.\nDiscussion\npostmaterialist difference index does not rise above zero\nduring these years, suggesting Australia is relatively \"mate-\nrialist\" for an advanced industrialized country. As Inglehart\nacknowledges (e.g., Inglehart, 1997; Inglehart & Welzel,\n2005), the measurement of postmaterial values is influenced\nby \"period effects.\" Although generational replacement is\nclaimed to account for intergenerational shifts in value ori-\nentations at the national level, Inglehart (1997) maintains,\n[I]ntergenerational population replacement is not the only factor\ninvolved: period effects, reflecting current conditions, also have\nan impact--but the direction of their impact is predictable . . . a\nmajor decline in the economic and physical security experienced\nby a given society would tend to retard or reverse the effects of\nintergenerational population replacement, and periods of\nexceptional prosperity would tend to magnify the effects of\nThe evidence from nine national election surveys from\nAustralia suggests that measuring postmaterial values\nusing postelection surveys influences the measurement of\npostmaterial values, in a similar manner to the \"period\neffects\" described by Inglehart. The influence of national\nelections upon values is analogous to period effects\nbecause many of the issues raised by political leaders dur-\ning campaigns and promulgated by communications media\nare associated with, and influence responses to, items on\nthe short values index. In a sense this phenomenon is not\nsurprising, as the materialist items \"maintain order in the\nnation\" and \"fight rising prices,\" and the postmaterialist\nitems \"protect freedom of speech\" and \"give people more\nsay in government decisions\" could well have been\ndesigned with election slogans in mind.\nTranter and Western (2009) find higher levels of post-\nmaterial values in polities with multiple parties, particu-\nlarly where green parties had gained national parliamentary\nrepresentation. This research also emphasizes the impact\nof political contextual factors, showing that the timing of\nsurvey administration also influences estimates of postma-\nterial values. The evidence from Australia suggests that\nmeasuring value orientations using postelection surveys\ntends to suppress the postmaterial difference index toward\nthe materialist pole. This is demonstrated indirectly by\ncomparing values estimates from the AES surveys with\nthose from other reputable national surveys that were not\nadministered during federal election years, and also by sta-\ntistically adjusting the postmaterial difference index to\ncontrol for political issues and major party leader effects.\nPDI\nFigure 1. PDI and PDI adjusted for Election Issues, Leader `thermometers', Age, Sex and Degree.\n8 SAGE Open\nAustralia appears to be a \"postmaterialist country\" based\nupon data from the WVS or the Australian Survey of Social\nAttitudes, but is far more \"materialist\" based upon AES\ndata. Yet when important political variables are controlled,\nAustralia is located on the postmaterial end of the values\ncontinuum in six of the nine election surveys analyzed\nhere, closer to where Inglehart's thesis predicts an advanced\nindustrialized country should be situated. While conten-\ntious, Inglehart's short values index is a useful predictor of\nsocial and political attitudes and behavior, although for\nestimating value orientations in a cross-national context,\nthis research questions the comparability of values data\nfrom the AES.\nAlthough this research is based upon Australian data, it\nhas broader, implications for the study of value change\nover time and cross-nationally. This study demonstrates\nthe influence of political factors upon the measurement of\npostmaterial values in an advanced industrialized nation,\nbut also raises questions for further research. The short\nvalues index is sensitive to economic and social issues--\neconomic recessions, high inflation and unemployment,\nor social upheavals--so-called \"period effects\" (e.g.,\nthat salient political issues, such as economic manage-\nment, border security, perceived threats of international\nterrorism, or politically divisive issues such as climate\nchange (e.g., see McCright & Dunlap, 2011; Poortinga,\nSpence, Whitmarsh, Capstick, & Pidgeon, 2011; Tranter,\n2011) and the leaders that champion such issues, also\ninfluence the measurement of postmaterial values.\nAlthough formal election campaigns may be relatively\nbrief, in countries such as the United States, congressional\ncampaigning is lengthy (Panagopoulos, 2013) and cam-\npaign duration appears to be lengthening in countries such\nas Australia. Long election campaigns should therefore be\nconsidered as having the potential to impact upon the\nmeasurement of postmaterial values. In light of this\nresearch, the accuracy of postmaterial values estimates\nwould be enhanced by statistically controlling for politi-\ncal contextual effects where possible, or avoiding the\nmeasurement of value orientations during or soon after\nnational election campaigns.\nAppendix A\nShort (4-Item) Values Questions\nInglehart has frequently employed the four-item values bat-\ntery, where respondents were asked a question similar to\nthe following form of the question as it appears in the 2013\n\"Next, a question about what you think the aims of\nAustralia should be for the next ten years.

A longer, 12-item version of the index appears in surveys\nsuch as the World Values Surveys (WVS) and Eurobarometers\n(Inglehart & Welzel, 2005), although for reasons of question-\nnaire space and cost, the longer index is used far less frequently\n(see Appendix A).\n 2. See Abramson (2011) for a comprehensive discussion of the\nmajor critiques of Inglehart and his collaborators and their\nresponses to the critics.\n 3. Although Inglehart argues that value orientations are genera-\ntionally based, age cohort differences in values are very weak\nin Australia (Tranter & Western, 2009). I therefore operation-\nalize a parsimonious model that controls for age in years rather\nthan use age cohort variables.\n4. Other potentially relevant controls such as income are not\navailable for all Australian Election Studies (AES), so for con-\nsistency of the models over time, income is not included.\nAppendix B\nPercentage Difference Index, Election Issues, and \"Feelings Thermometers\" (Pearson's r).\nLabor leader Hawke Keating Keating Beazley Beazley Latham Rudd Gillard Rudd\nCoalition leader Peacock Hewson Howard Howard Howard Howard Howard Abbott Abbott\nNote. Four-item values index coded as PDI where postmaterialist = 100, mixed = 0, materialist = -100. \"Which of these issues was most important to you\nduring the election campaign?\" (taxation, education, the environment, health and Medicare, each scored 1/0). Labor and coalition \"feeling thermometer\" 0\nto 10 scale, political party identification (1 = Liberals or Nationals; 2 = other party or no party identification; 3 = Labor party).\nAppendix C\nPolitical Context and Postmaterial Difference Index Model 4 by year (OLS).\nElection issues\nThermometers\nNote. OLS = ordinary least squares.\n 6. Four items--\"taxation,\" \"education,\" \"the environment,\" \"health\nThese are entered into the regression models as dummy variables.\nThe wording of two of these question items varied slightly across\nsurveys. In 1993, \"taxation\" was absent but \"business tax\" was\nincluded as an election issue, so was substituted, whereas from\n1996 onwards, \"health\" was listed as \"health and Medicare.\"\n 7. The questions were, \"Here is a list of words and phrases peo-\nple use to describe party leaders. Thinking first about [leader\nname], in your opinion how well does each of these describe\nhim/her--extremely well, quite well, not too well, or not well\nat all?\" The leader qualities were as follows: the leader is . . .\ncompetent, compassionate, sensible, a strong leader, honest,\nknowledgeable, inspiring, trustworthy. Both composite leader\nscales had Cronbach's alpha coefficients of .93.\n 8. The study description notes for the 1994 International Social\nScience Program (ISSP) on the ISSP site suggest, \"The panel\nof respondents from the ISSS/A 1993 \"Inequality II\" survey,\nwhich was in turn a panel on the earlier National Social Science\nSurvey \"Family and Changing Sex Roles\" and \"Lifestyles\"\nsample drawn from the (compulsory) Australian electoral rolls\nby the Australian Electoral Commission. Potential respondents\nwere eligible for inclusion in the 1993-94 survey if they had\ncompleted the 1993 survey, had not indicated that they did\nnot wish to participate further and were still contactable at the\nsame address. Number of Units in Original Sample: 2318.\"\n9. The description on the WVS site suggests that the 1995\nAustralian survey was \"self administered,\" yet according to\nquestionnaire documentation on the site, the 1995 WVS ques-\ntionnaire was administered face-to-face by interviewers. A pri-\nvate company, Roy Morgan Research (Melbourne), collected\nthe 1995 WVS data, as opposed to academic researchers who\nundertook other surveys examined here. The documentation\naccompanying the 1995 WVS does not provide a detailed\ndescription of the sampling strategy used, but states, \"The\nsample was designed to be representative of the entire adult\npopulation, that is, 18 years and older.\"\n10. Pearson's correlations between the short values index (coded:\nissue priority variables and major party leaders \"feelings ther-\nmometer\" variables (Appendix B) show weak associations\nfor issues measures, although considerable variation between\nelections and estimate signs as issue salience fluctuates.\nAlthough weak, the \"taxation\" correlations are all negative,\nindicating taxation tends to be a material issue, whereas the\n\"environment,\" and to a lesser extent \"education\" are post-\nmaterial issues. Health and Medicare correlations varied only\nminimally from zero. For the leader scale variables, with the\nexception of a very weak association for 1990, postmaterialist\nvalues correlations with Labor leaders tend to fluctuate, but are\nmore strongly and negatively associated with coalition leaders\nover time. Coalition leaders are associated with the short val-\nues index to a much greater extent than Labor leaders.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbramson, P.
