As a consequence, patients\nwho demonstrate AI after a course of GCs\nrespond better to GC treatment. We performed\na retrospective study to estimate disease activity\nduring a 3-year period after a course of GC treat-\nment for active IBD, and investigated the rela-\ntionship between disease activity and the\noutcome of a low-dose short Synacthen test\n(LDSST) performed within 1 week of finalizing\nGC treatment.\nMethods\nStudy design\nA retrospective observational study.\nStudy population\nFrom the hospital data records, we identified all\npatients with international classification of dis-\neases (ICD) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and\nCrohn's disease (CD), who had performed an\n2012 at the Department of Medicine, Ume\u00e5\nUniversity Hospital, Sweden. Due to the reports\nof a high prevalence of GC-induced AI in patients\nwith IBD,6 there was a low threshold for testing\nwith LDSST after a course of GCs at our clinic\nduring this time period.\nUme\u00e5 University Hospital is a primary catchment\napproximately 800 patients with IBD were treated\nat our clinic. The inclusion criterion for this retro-\nspective observational study was an established\nIBD disease that had been treated with GCs and\nhad undergone an LDSST to evaluate the HPA\naxis 1\u00ad7 days after a standard course of GC.\nLow-dose short Synacthen test\nAn LDSST (1 g) was used to test adrenal func-\ntion. This test has shown excellent correlation with\nthe insulin tolerance test10 and is the standard test\nfor investigation for AI in our department.11 The\npatients were informed not to use oral or inhaled\nsteroids 24 h before the test. An intravenous cath-\neter was inserted into the forearm and a blood\nsample was drawn at baseline, and then at 30 and\n40 min after 1 g of Synacthen was administered\nintravenously. Plasma cortisol was analyzed by\nCobas Cortisol (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz,\nThe LDSST was considered normal if the peak\ncortisol level was at least 550 nmol/L; a peak corti-\nsol level below 550 nmol/L was defined as AI.\nFurthermore, if the peak cortisol level was 400\u00ad\n549 nmol/L the test was judged as mild AI, whereas\nif the peak cortisol level was below 400 nmol/L it\nwas judged as severe AI. In addition to the first\nLDSST, all additional LDSSTs were registered to\nestimate the time when HPA function was restored.\nMedical records\nMedical, surgical and laboratory records for the\nincluded patients were thoroughly reviewed for\ndata concerning the time before and the 3 years\nafter the first LDSST was performed. Before the\nfirst LDSST, data on estimated lifetime pre-\ncumulative doses of prednisolone and budeson-\nide, IBD type, disease duration, previous\ntreatment (surgery and medical) and the use of\nother GC formulas (enemas, inhalers, topical)\nwere collected. The estimated lifetime pre-cumu-\nlative dose of GCs was defined as the sum of all\noral prednisolone doses prescribed to the patient\nbefore the first LDSST. The duration of the GC\ncourse used before the first LDSST was esti-\nmated. Most patients received a standardized\nprednisolone treatment schedule, which started\nwith 40 mg prednisolone daily for 1 week, fol-\nlowed by 30 mg prednisolone daily for 1 week,\nand then slowly tapered down during the addi-\ntional 10 weeks. Patients who prolonged their\ntreatment (>3 months) due to `steroid depend-\nency' were registered. The standardized schedule\nfor budesonide (only used by CD patients) was\n9 mg per day for 3 months followed by 6 mg per\nday for 3 months. The major focus of the present\nstudy was on disease activity within 3 years after\nthe LDSST. The time until post-GC treatment\nflare-up was obtained from the medical records.\nA flare-up was defined if the doctor, due to active\nA Ibrahim, P Dahlqvist et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 831\ndisease, intensified the therapy by increasing the\n5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) dose, restarted GC\ntreatment (local or oral), initiated/intensified\nimmunomodulators, biologics or if surgery was\nperformed. Escalation of therapy was defined as if\nthe patients during the observation period had\nstarted immunomodulators, biologics or had\nneeded surgery due to IBD. At our clinic, all\npatients with IBD are encouraged to report by tel-\nephone as soon as they suspect a flare-up of the\ndisease. In addition, they visit the clinic for at\nleast annual check-ups. If the patient was in\nremission during the whole 3-year period, the\ntime for the next flare-up was set to 3 years. We\nalso registered whether the patient was treated\nwith GC replacement therapy due to a subnormal\nLDSST. Standard replacement therapy used at\nour clinic is hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily.\nFecal calprotectin\nFecal calprotectin (FC) level was used as an\nobjective biomarker of gut inflammation. The\nsamples for FC were analyzed at the Department\nof Laboratory Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University\nHospital, by the CALPRO\u00ae Calprotectin ELISA\nTest according to the manufacturer (Calpro AS,\nLysaker, Norway) instructions. Bilevel material\nsupplied by the manufacturer was used for quality\ncontrol. The detection limit for FC is <20 \u00b5g/g.\nAs a marker of gut inflammation, we used the first\nFC after the LDSST and the median value of all\nFC tests analyzed during the observation period.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS\nStatistics version 23. Non-parametric tests were\nused for comparing ordinal scales and continuous\nvariables (Mann\u00adWhitney U test) and for correla-\ntions (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).\nThe Chi-square test was used for crosstabs analy-\nses, and Fisher's exact test was used if there were\nfewer than 10 cases. Student's t test was used for\nparametric comparison. A two-sided p-value less\nthan 0.05 was regarded as significant. Means and\nstandard deviations were used for continuous var-\niables and medians and interquartile range (IQR)\nwere used for ordinal variables. Due to the explor-\natory purpose of the study we did not correct for\nmultiple testing.\nResults\nBasal characteristics\nSixty-three patients (27 UC, 36 CD) fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria and were included in the analy-\nsis. Forty patients (63%) had a subnormal\nLDSST after GC treatment and 14 patients\n(Figure 1). Among the patients with AI the\nmean peak stimulated serum cortisol was 385 \u00b1\n115 nmol/L; the distribution of peak serum corti-\nsol value for the patients is shown in Figure 1.\nThere were no differences in age, gender, IBD\ntype, disease duration, the use of inhalation ster-\noids, topical steroids, the pre-cumulative lifetime\ndoses of prednisolone and budesonide or dura-\ntion of the steroid course between patients with a\nsubnormal versus a normal LDSST (Table 1).\nMale gender and a history of previous IBD sur-\ngery (five patients for CD and two patients for\nUC) was significantly more common in the sub-\njects with a peak cortisol <400 nmol/L.

The remaining 41 patients\n(20 UC, 21 CD) who were steroid-free after the\nLDSST were retrospectively observed for 3 years\n(Table 2). The patients with a peak cortisol\n<400 nmol/L had significantly longer time until\nFigure 1.

Seven out of these 10\npatients had received replacement therapy in\nphysiological doses but none of the patients had\nreceived courses of GCs due to flare-ups. These\n10 patients remained insufficient in their cortisol\nproduction until at least 3.1 \u00b1 2.5 years (mean \u00b1\nSD) after the first LDSST.\nDiscussion\nWe could verify a high incidence of GC-induced\nAI in patients with IBD, in line with earlier stud-\nies.6 This study suggests an association between\nGC-induced AI and lower disease activity in\npatients with IBD after GC treatment. This is a\nnovel finding and requires verification in prospec-\ntive studies. The association was most obvious in\npatients with more severe AI. In line with this,\npatients with AI defined by a peak serum cortisol\n<550 nmol/L had significantly lower FC values\nafter GC treatment compared to patients with\nnormal adrenal function.\nThe subjects in our study showed a large variabil-\nity in peak cortisol after LDSST (Figure 1). A\nplausible explanation for the variability in post-\nGC-exposure AI is the wide inter-individual vari-\nability in GC sensitivity.13 Such variability could\nalso explain the finding that patients with AI after\nTable 2.

It is well known that if inflammation\nresolves in the gut mucosa it predicts a favorable\nclinical outcome in patients with IBD.14 A patient\nwith a higher GC sensitivity thus has better odds\nto achieve mucosal healing.\nA recent review thoroughly presents putative\ngenetic mechanisms for GC resistance in patients\nwith IBD.15 A decreased response to GCs \u00ad that is\n`GC resistance' \u00ad is common in inflammatory dis-\neases. For example, 30% of patients with rheuma-\nwere reported to be resistant to GC.17,18 Factors\nresponsible for individual GC sensitivity are ster-\noid bioavailability in the affected organ, GC recep-\ntor expression and affinity and GC receptor\nsignaling.13 Polymorphisms in the GC receptor\ngene (NR3C1) may influence the formation of the\nGC receptor (GR) and the GR\u00adGC complex and\nchange the expression of target genes. Several\nalterations in the NR3C1 gene have been\ndescribed, notably the BclI polymorphism, and\nassociated to GC response.19 An increased sensi-\ntivity to GCs via this polymorphism has been sug-\ngested to predict GC treatment response in\nchildren with IBD, but this has not been con-\nfirmed in other studies.15 Other genes that may\nplay a role in GC sensitivity are the ARCB1/\nMDR1 gene and the IP013 gene, involved in cyto-\nplasmic GC transport.15 Furthermore, a gene pol-\nymorphism in the GC-induced transcript 1\n(GLCCI1) gene has been related to variable dis-\nease activity and therapeutic response to GC in\nasthma and rheumatoid arthritis.13,20 This gene\npolymorphism in the GR has not been studied in\npatients with IBD.\nDespite the established term `steroid-dependent',\nwhich is used to classify patients with IBD in clini-\ncal trials,21\u00ad23 GC has failed to be effective overall\nin patients with CD as a maintenance treatment,24\nbut this does not rule out the possibility that a sub-\nset of patients (who are sensitive to GC) may ben-\nefit from such treatment. Perhaps also small doses\n(physiological doses) could benefit `glucocorticoid\nsensitive' patients in analogy to what we observed\nin the patients with GC-induced AI in our study,\nwhere the majority of patients in the group with\nmore severe AI were on long-term hydrocortisone\ntreatment. One can also hypothesize that some\npatients who are classified as `steroid-dependent'\nhave GC-induced AI and therefore have difficul-\nties terminating steroid treatment. However, long-\nterm treatment with GC is also restricted by side\neffects such as osteoporosis and infections.25 The\nidentification of a marker that could determine\nwhether a patient is sensitive or resistant to GC\ntreatment early in the course of IBD might improve\ntailoring of the treatment for patients with IBD. A\npatient with decreased sensitivity to GC treatment\ncould receive an alternative treatment (immu-\nnomodulators or biologics) earlier instead of\nrepeated courses of GCs; a patient who is sensitive\nto GCs could perhaps receive a lower treatment\ndose. Interestingly, a pilot study found an associa-\ntion between in-vitro measurement of T lympho-\ncyte GC sensitivity and clinical response to GCs in\nsubjects with UC.26 Whether a LDSST or basal\nserum cortisol before steroid treatment can predict\nGC responsiveness is not known. In contrast, there\nwas no difference in HPA axis suppressibility\nmeasured by a dexamethasone suppression test,\nbetween GC resistant and sensitive asthma\npatients.27 Similar studies are therefore of interest\nin subjects with different types of IBD, as there is a\nlack of useful predictors for development of AI\nafter GC therapy.4\nThe present study confirms the high incidence of\nGC-induced AI in patients with IBD seen in other\nshow that in a substantial number of patients with\ninduced AI, the subnormal adrenal function per-\nsists sometimes for years after the withdrawal of\nGC treatment. Desram\u00e9 and colleagues found a\nmean recovery time of adrenal function of 7.2\nSynacthen test.6 In the present study, using an\nLDSST, we found an even longer time to normali-\nzation of adrenal function (mean 3.1 years). The\nconsequence for patients with IBD living with a\ndysfunctionalHPAaxiswasstudiedbyMinderhoud\nand colleagues.32 The authors found no association\nbetween fatigue in quiescent IBD and AI, but\nunfortunately all patients who had taken steroids\nwithin 12 months before the study were excluded,\nand only a few patients were assessed by an LDSST.\nIn some clinical settings, an LDSST for every\npatient with IBD treated with GCs may be\nimpractical; instead, an annual test of baseline\nserum cortisol, as has been suggested for\npatients with asthma taking inhaled corticoster-\noids, could be feasible. A baseline serum cortisol\nA Ibrahim, P Dahlqvist et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 835\n<100 nmol/L strongly suggests the need for oral\nhydrocortisone treatment, and a serum cortisol\nLimitations\nThis is a retrospective observational study, and\nthe decision to test for HPA axis function was\nmade by clinical judgment and not in a standard-\nized study protocol, which makes it difficult to\ncontrol for possible confounders and selection\nbias. For example, the patients with replacement\ntherapy tended to be older and may therefore pre-\nsent with a more quiescent disease than younger\npatients. As this is a retrospective study, the infor-\nmation that stated why the physician had ordered\nan LDSST was in most cases lacking and the pre-\ncumulative GC doses varied significantly.\nThe LDSST has a high sensitivity for AI, con-\nstructed to detect subtle HPA axis insufficiency.11\nTherefore, the subtle HPA axis insufficiency\ndetected in a large proportion of our patients may\nhave limited clinical implications.\nIn conclusion, our study verifies that AI after\nstandard GC treatment for IBD is common.\nImportantly, suppression of the HPA axis is asso-\nciated with lower inflammatory activity in the gut.\nWe suggest that a low threshold to test for AI after\na course of GCs for IBD is informative about the\nclinical course, including the possible need for\nGC replacement treatment. Prospective studies\nare needed to define the clinical consequences of\nGC-induced AI in patients with IBD.\n"
