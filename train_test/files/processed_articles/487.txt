    "abstract": "Abstract\nBecause certain groups at high risk for HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)\ncome together in correctional facilities, seroprevalence was high early in the epidemic. The share of the HIV/AIDS epidemic\nborne by inmates of and persons released from jails and prisons in the United States (US) in 1997 was estimated in a\nprevious paper. While the number of inmates and releasees has risen, their HIV seroprevalence rates have fallen. We sought\nto determine if the share of HIV/AIDS borne by inmates and releasees in the US decreased between 1997 and 2006. We\ncreated a new model of population flow in and out of correctional facilities to estimate the number of persons released in\ncorrectional facility that year. Nine years later, only one in seven (14%) of infected Americans was among the 9.1 million\nleaving, a 29.3% decline in the share. For black and Hispanic males, two demographic groups with heightened incarceration\nrates, recently released inmates comprise roughly one in five of those groups' total HIV-infected persons, a figure similar to\nthe proportion borne by the correctional population as a whole in 1997. Decreasing HIV seroprevalence among those\nadmitted to jails and prisons, prolonged survival and aging of the US population with HIV/AIDS beyond the crime-prone\nyears, and success with discharge planning programs targeting HIV-infected prisoners could explain the declining\nconcentration of the epidemic among correctional populations. Meanwhile, the number of persons with HIV/AIDS leaving\ncorrectional facilities remains virtually identical. Jails and prisons continue to be potent targets for public health\ninterventions. The fluid nature of incarcerated populations ensures that effective interventions will be felt not only in\ncorrectional facilities but also in communities to which releasees return.\nCitation: Spaulding AC, Seals RM, Page MJ, Brzozowski AK, Rhodes W, et al.

Spaulding1*, Ryan M. Seals1, Matthew J. Page1, Amanda K. Brzozowski1, William Rhodes2,\nTheodore M. Hammett3\n1 Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America, 2 Abt Associates Incorporated, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States\nof America, 3 Abt Associates Incorporated, Hanoi, Vietnam\n Introduction\nAn earlier paper [1] estimated the share of selected infectious\ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome), borne by persons who\nspent at least part of the year in correctional facilities (CFs) in the\nUnited States (US) in 1997. That paper examined the percentage\nof individuals with a particular disease in the total US population\nwho passed through a US CF in 1997. Multiplying prevalence by\nestimates of the size of the populations that moved through CFs\nyielded projections that, among all persons in the US with HIV/\nAIDS, between 20% and 26% had been incarcerated for at least\npart of that calendar year [1]. The results were widely\ndisseminated; as of September 2009, according to www.Scholar.\nGoogle.com, the paper has been cited 242 times. The findings\ncommunicated the challenges presented by the disproportionately\nhigh levels of infectious diseases in correctional settings. Further-\nmore, they demonstrated the importance of improving the health\nof the community by treating jail and prison inmates, since\nvirtually all of those incarcerated eventually return to the\ncommunity. Using the correctional setting as a venue for\ndiagnosing HIV disease could benefit those passing through CFs\nas well as those living in the communities to which they return [2].\nPrimary and secondary prevention to reduce the high proportion\nof HIV/AIDS borne by incarcerated persons could help reduce its\noverall prevalence in the US.\nAre CFs still important targets for public health interventions? If\nthe criminal justice population represents a smaller share of the US\nHIV epidemic, intervening in the CFs may have a smaller impact\non the US population as a whole and may be less cost effective\nthan in 1997. If the number of inmates infected is still high, and if\nthere are individuals in the correctional population who have poor\naccess to healthcare when at liberty, CFs may remain important\nsettings for public health interventions. Development of public\nhealth interventions that can capitalize on even brief access to\nincarcerated individuals may provide additional justification for\npublic health agencies to work among persons passing through\nCFs.\nA number of trends in the past nine years influence the answer to\nthese questions. While HIV seroprevalence among people in CFs\nsame time, the way in which HIV affects the correctional population\nhas changed. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has\nmarkedly improved treatment for HIV, resulting in prolonged\nsurvival among both infected inmates and those previously\nincarcerated [7]. Rapid diagnostic algorithms for HIV [8\u00ad11] and\nbrief behavioral interventions for prevention and management of\nHIV [12\u00ad14] have proven effective. Given these trends and their\nimportant policy implications, our objective was to recalculate the\nshare of HIV/AIDS borne by correctional populations in the US.\nWe developed new estimates of the size of the population\nflowing through CFs in one year and the number of releasees that\nsame year. Our estimation methodology accounts for the fact that,\nbecause so many individuals pass through more than once, neither\nthe reported number of CF intakes nor of releasees represents\nunique persons passing though a facility. Using these estimates of\nthe number of persons ever incarcerated during a year and the\nnumber of releasees, we developed estimates for the proportion of\nHIV borne by the respective populations.\nMethods\nFor this update, we estimated the share of HIV/AIDS in\nincarcerated persons during 2006. Using data from the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics (BJS), we estimated the percentage of inmates\nafflicted with HIV/AIDS and applied these percentages to the\nnumber of persons passing through CFs in 2006. Dividing this\nperiod prevalence by the number of infected persons nationwide\nprovided estimates of the proportion of the US epidemic of HIV/\nAIDS borne by inmates and releasees.\nWe used a period prevalence rather than point prevalence because\na 1-d snapshot of the incarcerated population fails to describe\nadequately how many different people enter and exit CFs during any\ngiven year. Jails and, to a lesser extent, prisons are characterized by\nflux [15]. For example, the Atlanta City Detention Center turns over\nits population rapidly, with a mean length of stay of just 22.5 h\n(Sgt. Rafael Bryant, personal communication, December 30, 2008).\nPrison inmates have a mean length of stay of 3 y [15].\nFigure S1 displays the relationships and movements between\nlocations within the correctional system, with the upper half\nrepresenting custody and the lower half representing freedom. A\nhypothetical inmate may commit a crime, be arrested, be booked\ninto a jail, and enter a cell pre-adjudication (a), go to court, and be\nsentenced and transferred to prison (e). For most individuals, this\nwould take place within one year. Our methodology strove to\naccount for this course of events and would count this individual as\none person admitted to the correctional system. If the individual\nwere eventually released on parole (k) and went on to recidivate\nwithin one year, she or he would be represented by the dotted line\n(i). If an individual was released from jail, either on bond or after\ncharges were dropped, and was subsequently re-incarcerated in the\nsame year on new charges, she or he would begin the travel through\nthe criminal justice system at point (a) again. Our methodology\ncounted this individual as just one person involved in the criminal\njustice system in the given year. Any recidivism after one year would\nmake her or him a unique admittee in the next year.\nNumber of Correctional Facility Inmates and Releasees\nData on the size of the stock population (those in cells and not\nmoving in or out during a given year), total admissions, and total\nreleases in 2006 were taken from publications of the BJS and the\nNational Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP, website at\nhttp://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/ncrp). Estimates of the size\ncomposition of the stock population were taken from data\nnumber of jail admissions, we took data from the 2006 Annual\nSurvey of Jails (available on the NCRP website) and used the\nmethod of Sabol and Minton [16] to derive a figure for total\nadmissions.\nOther than an estimate published in one previous paper [1], we\nare aware of no nationally representative data on re-arrest rates in\njail detainees published in the peer-reviewed literature. For this\npaper, the estimate of the number of unique persons represented\nby total jail admissions in a year was derived from several sources\nof information: two smaller jails in jurisdictions with combination\njails and prisons; data from the 1989 BJS Census of Jails; a\npreviously published estimate by two of our authors (WR, TMH)\nbased on data from the Drug Use Forecasting System [1]; and\ncommunication with four very large jail systems, collectively\nrepresenting 2.5% of all admissions nationwide, that have inmate\ndata reporting systems able to provide information on how many\nunique persons were represented in the pool of all admissions for a\ngiven year (see Table 1). An important caveat is that the various\nsources provide counts of slightly different, but closely linked\nevents--arrest, booking, admission into a jail cell. The mean value\nof the number of entrances into the pre-trial division of the\ncriminal justice system per individual in each data set was used as\nour estimate of admissions per individual, because the data from\nseveral sources provided similar estimates. Dividing the number of\ntotal jail admissions in a year by the average number of jail\nadmissions per individual provides us with an estimate of the\nnumber of individuals admitted to jail in a given year.\nIn order to determine the number of releases from jails in a 1-y\nperiod, we first calculated the net yearly growth of the jail system.\nThe difference in average daily US jail population between 2005\nand 2006 represents the balance between admissions and releases.\nThe residual number of persons indicates the number of persons\nby which the jail population grew. By subtracting the amount by\nwhich the population grew from the total number of admitted\nindividuals, we can estimate the number of unique releasees.\nWhile jail admissions require an estimate based on national data\nand recidivism rates, prison records allowed us to perform a more\ncomplete enumeration of the number of individuals admitted and\nreleased in a year. In the current paper, we wanted to account for\nthe growing number of persons admitted to state prison who are\nsame-year recidivists, predominantly parole violators. In 2006,\n17% of the state parolee population returned to incarceration [17].\nThis phenomenon is not as pronounced in the Federal Bureau of\nsupervised release) returned to federal custody during the same\nyear [17]. In the earlier paper, the number of prison releases was\nconsidered a reasonable estimate of the number of different people\nreleased from prisons because the average length of stay was\ngreater than one year. Therefore, the estimate did not reflect the\nnumber of prisoners released on parole who returned to prison\nwithin a year ([i] in Figure S1) [1]. Information on the frequency\nof prison releasees who were readmitted and had more than one\nrelease in a single year were taken from NCRP. Because 2003 data\nwere the latest available as of the preparation of this paper, we\nstability and judge the suitability of extrapolation to 2006.\nRecords on all prison admissions from the 34 states reporting to\nNCRP were reviewed (according to date of birth, race, and state of\nimprisonment) to identify how many represented unique persons\nHIV/AIDS in Inmates/Releasees\nand how many prisoners were admitted multiple times. To\nextrapolate the figures for the remaining 16 states not included in\nNCRP data, we calculated the overall percentage of BJS-reported\nadmissions comprising unique persons. We removed data from the\nsingle state with a proportion of unique releasees more than two\nstandard deviations below the mean (California, with abnormally\nhigh recidivism) and from the one state with a proportion of unique\nreleasees more than two standard deviations above the mean (North\nCarolina, with abnormally low recidivism) and recalculated the\nmean ratio of unique persons admitted relative to total number of\nadmissions. We next examined the trend of state prison admission\nstatistics on admissions to Federal prisons were added to yield the\nnumber of unique admittees to prisons nationwide. We used the\nsame approach to derive unique releasees from prisons nationwide.\nTo estimate the total number of releasees in the community, we\naccounted for people who were released from jail into prison. Data\nfrom the State Court Processing Statistics of large urban counties\n(available on the NCRP website) provided an estimate of the\nproportion of individuals sentenced to prison who were detained\npretrial. This group of individuals released from jail directly to\nprison was subtracted from the total number of jail releasees to\nobtain the number released to the community.\nrecalculated the 1997 prison release estimates using the new approach.\nBecause a complete enumeration of unique jail releasees does not exist\nfor 1997, we retained the earlier estimate of jail releasees.\nDetermining Sex and Race/Ethnicity Proportions\nWe sought to describe the composition of incarcerated\npopulations going in and out of CFs by race/ethnicity and sex.\nThe total number of persons ever inside a CF and the total\nnumber of releasees is mostly influenced by the flow of persons\nthrough jails [1]. We weighted the cohort by sex and race/\nethnicity proportionally to the demographics of its constituent\nparts. We relied on self-reports of sex and race/ethnicity in recent\ninmate surveys to derive demographic data. For prisoner race and\nethnicity demographics, we used a published 2004 survey of state\ninmates [18]. For similar demographics for jail detainees, we used\nresults from the BJS 2002 Survey of Jail Inmates available on the\nNCRP website. In both surveys, the term ``whites'' and ``blacks''\nstood for non-Hispanic whites and blacks, respectively; ``Hispanic''\nreferred to those of Hispanic ethnicity regardless of race.\nMethods for Deriving HIV/AIDS Data\nHIV in jail and prison populations. Data derived from BJS\n2002 Survey of Jail Inmates were used to estimate overall HIV\nprevalence among jail detainees who had been tested for\nHIV [19]. Additional information was taken from CDC data on\nHIV prevalence among untested jail detainees [10].\nBJS produces annual estimates of the number of HIV/AIDS\ncases in prisons based on reports from state and federal prison\nsystems. Testing practices vary widely between states, with some\nsystems testing all incoming inmates, some testing all outgoing\ninmates, others conducting routine seroprevalence surveys, and\nstill others with little or no routine testing. The state with the\nhighest prevalence of HIV, New York, uses an innovative\nmethodology for estimating stock population prevalence; blinded\nseroprevalence surveillance has been conducted on a sample of\npercentage of the current population that entered during each\n2- to 3-y entry period, one can assign an estimate of the HIV\nprevalence to the block and thus derive an HIV prevalence\nTable 1.

In late 2008, the CDC released\ndata for 2006 on HIV/AIDS prevalence by race and ethnicity in\n33 states with name-based reporting, based on new methodology\n[21]. Data on AIDS prevalence is collected in all states and\nreported to the CDC [22]. We used these CDC data for estimates\nof AIDS prevalence in the total population.\nSensitivity Analysis\nWe performed a bidirectional sensitivity analysis to assess the\nstability of our estimate of the proportion of HIV/AIDS borne by\nthose released from CFs in 2006. To assess the extreme upper limit\nof our estimate, we assumed that all jail and prison admissions and\nreleases reported by the BJS were, in fact, unique persons (inflating\nthe numerator) and employed the lower bound of the CDC\nestimate for HIV/AIDS in the US (deflating the denominator). To\nobtain a lower limit, we assumed that the average jail inmate was\nincarcerated 1.5 times, and employed our point estimate for\nunique prison releases and the upper bound of the CDC estimate\nfor HIV/AIDS in the US. We estimated how many fewer HIV-\ninfected persons would be in the cohort of releasees if this higher\nreturn rate were used and assessed whether or not the number of\nreleasees would decline by the same number of persons as did the\nnumber of admittees. To estimate the difference in the likely\nnumber of HIV-infected persons in this release cohort, we\nmultiplied the HIV seroprevalence of jail detainees by the number\nof persons by which the release cohort declined.\nResults\nEstimates for the ``stock'' population, the number of persons\nbehind bars on June 30, 2006, are from the BJS, which estimated\nNumber of Individuals Passing through Correctional\nFrom the 2006 Annual Survey of Jails data, using the method of\nSabol and Minton [16], we calculated that there were 12.8 million\nadmissions to jails in 2006.

Dividing the total number of admissions by the number of\njailings per individual yields 9 million unique persons admitted to\njails in 2006 ([a+d] in Figure S1). The number of releasees was\nfound by taking the difference between the mid-year US jail\nmeaning there were that many fewer releases than admissions.\n([b+c+e+g+h] in Figure S1).\nRecords from 2003 NCRP data on all prison admissions from\nthese 34 states.

Added to the states already covered by NCRP, we\nshowed very little variation between years, leading us to conclude\nthat the data were stable enough for short-term extrapolation.

For\nthe total number of persons who were ever in a CF in 2006, about\n85% were jail inmates. Releasees were composed of about 95% jail\ndetainees and 5% prisoners.

Thus, the revised estimate of unique releasees\nfor the denominator changes estimates of the epidemic borne by\nthe correctional population only moderately (Table 6).\nHIV/AIDS: Period Prevalence among Inmates and\nProportion of the US Epidemic\nBased on the varying testing practices among prison systems,\nthe BJS, in HIV in Prisons, 2006, reported prison HIV/AIDS\nprevalence of 1.7% and an AIDS prevalence of 0.5% [4]. Because\nsome of these states do not routinely test for HIV, this estimate\nmay be inaccurate, but the bias could be in either a positive or\nnegative direction.\nIn a nationally representative survey of jail inmates' medical\nthemselves to be HIV positive [24]. Of those surveyed however,\napproximately 0.8% of all jail inmates with unknown HIV status\npositive, it raises the overall jail HIV prevalence estimate to 1.6%,\nwhich is almost as high as the estimate for prisons. As a previous\npaper noted, jail and prison populations have similarities in\ndemographics related to HIV risk.[1] We applied an HIV\nprevalence of 1.7% to both jail and prison populations.\nTables 7 and 8 show the estimated number of persons infected,\nby race and sex. The HIV prevalence data by race and sex, from\nthe 2004 Survey of State Inmates (available on the NCRP website),\nwere multiplied by the number of persons in the demographic\ncategory to give estimated crude estimates of the number of\npersons infected, which are shown in Tables 7 and 8. If none of the\nHIV-infected men ever in a CF classified as ``other'' were black,\nthen 73,466 black men would be infected; if all of the HIV-\ninfected male prisoners classified as ``other'' were black, then\n92,591 of black men would be infected.

Treating all 12.8 million\njail releasees and 713,473 prison releasees reported by the BJS as\nunique persons and using the lower bound of the CDC estimate of\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in the US, the proportion of HIV/AIDS\nborne by releasees is 20.6%, which is lower than the midpoint of\nrange. Given the uncertainty of the earlier estimate, we can\nconclude that even if our estimates of unique releasees were grossly\ninaccurate, the proportion would not have shifted substantially\nfrom 1997 levels. To calculate a lower bound, we assumed that the\naverage number of incarcerations per jail inmate was 1.5 (the\nhighest return rate found in sources of data for Table 1). Using this\nreturn rate yielded an estimated proportion of HIV/AIDS borne\nby releases from CFs of 12.7%. The range of the estimate was\nwho each were incarcerated 1.5 times rather than 1.4 times per\nyear, approximately 500,000 fewer persons were admitted to jail.\nThis adjustment would not change the number of persons who\nwere released from jail to go to prison or who were released from\nprison; therefore, the absolute number of releasees would decline\nadjustment would mean that 8,500 fewer HIV-infected persons\n(4.5% fewer than previously estimated) were released from\nDiscussion\nWe suggest four factors that could explain the diminishing\nproportion of HIV/AIDS borne by the populations moving\nthrough CFs; these four factors could contribute either alone or in\ncombination. First, with increased life expectancy for persons with\nHIV with the advent of better therapeutics, infected persons are\nTable 7.

Second, while a person may have\nbeen infected in his or her crime-prone years, with HAART,\nprison AIDS mortality has fallen [20], and that person is more\nlikely to survive incarceration, be released, and stay out. Third, the\npast decade has seen a decline in the number and proportion of\nHIV/AIDS cases among injection drug users [21,22], probably\ndue to interventions to reduce the harm associated with parenteral\ndrug use.\nFinally, considerable effort has been made by prison systems,\nand some jails, to enhance discharge planning for HIV-infected\npersons [24]. The effects of these programs are difficult to assess. A\ncontrolled but non-randomized trial has been conducted in North\nCarolina [25,26]. Preliminary results show a non-significant trend\nin the efficacy of discharge planning, but final results have yet to be\npublished as of submission of this manuscript. Observational\nstudies seem to show that those CFs with adequate discharge\nplanning do better than those without [27]. A program in Rhode\nIsland compared the recidivism of HIV-infected women to\nhistorical controls and found a significant difference in return\nrates [28]. Enhanced discharge planning of HIV-infected inmates\nbeyond that usually received by prisoners may be contributing to\nlower recidivism rates in the HIV-infected population in Rhode\nIsland.\nOne limitation of this study was the need to make numerous\nassumptions about the proportion of persons who would move\nfrom a jail to a prison and the number of releasees who would\nreturn to the same type of facility in the space of 1 y. The\nsensitivity analysis shows that even with faulty estimates, the\ngeneral trend is probably accurate. We emphasize the unlikelihood\nof all jail and prison releasees representing unique persons. A\nsecond limitation is that our recidivism data were based on rates of\nreturn to the same institution. The assumption that recidivists\nwould be reincarcerated in the identical jurisdiction is not far-\nfetched, given that many releasees would be on probation or\nparole, which often stipulates residency in the same jurisdiction.\nThird, HIV/AIDS prevalence in prisons and jails was largely\nderived from self-reported data, and an estimate of the prevalence\nin untested individuals was applied. We believe this would bias our\nestimate of inmates with HIV/AIDS slightly downwards, if at all.\nBecause certain groups at high risk for HIV/AIDS come\ntogether in correctional facilities, seroprevalence was high early in\nthe epidemic; 16.2% of men and 25.1% of women tested for HIV\nin 1989 at the New York City jail on Rikers Island were found to\nbe HIV-positive [29]. The decline in HIV prevalence among\ncorrectional populations has been offset by the growing number of\ninmates. Although the proportional share of HIV/AIDS borne by\nthose passing through CFs has declined since 1997, the total\nnumber of HIV infected persons who are in this flow has remained\nsteady at roughly 150,000 individuals, an estimate that is only\nmarginally perturbed by an assumption that each detainee is\nincarcerated 1.5 rather than 1.4 times per year.\nAs the HIV epidemic has matured, the share borne by releasees\nhas decreased, but the total number of persons with HIV released\nfrom CFs is unchanged. This steady size of the target population\nleads us to conclude that CFs still represent a rich focus for public\nhealth interventions. Interventions in CFs may have the greatest\nimpact on the HIV epidemic among minority men, given the\ndisproportionate incarceration rates in the US criminal justice\nsystem. The proportion of minorities diagnosed with HIV late in\nthe course of disease, less than 12 mo before a diagnosis of AIDS,\ncontinues to lag behind whites [30], so reaching minority\npopulations is a public health priority. Jail and prison inmates\nrepresent a captive, and still very important, audience for HIV\ntesting, counseling, and prevention messages. After diagnosis,\nenabling HIV-infected releasees to link to community care is of\nutmost importance. Because virtually all persons entering CFs\nreturn to the community, effective interventions benefit not only\nCF populations but also the communities to which releasees\nreturn.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Populations Flowing through Correctional Facilities\n"
