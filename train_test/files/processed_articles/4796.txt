Hajer (2003) for example argues for recognition\nof new patterns of political engagement where citizens are increasingly on `stand by',\nwaiting for issues that will `ignite'their involvement and that often emerge at the `end of\nthe pipe' during policy implementation.\nA key response to the increasing salience of end-of-the-pipe conflict has been the\nproliferation of invitations to citizens to participate in public decision-making. As\nNewman (2011) argues, however, a key set of questions raised by participatory initia-\ntives concerns the identity of the citizen welcomed into such spaces: if certain forms of\n`active citizenship' are openly encouraged by authorities anxious to enrol the legitimis-\ning authority of the `ordinary' citizen, more `activist' orientations are typically consid-\nered problematic. Yet, if communicative planning theory has focused increasing attention\non the need to foster `people-centred' forms of governance as a means of `re-enchanting\ndemocracy' (Healey, 2012), it is perhaps curious that the qualities required of the citizen\nhave not always been central.1 Indeed, normative theory has arguably paid relatively lit-\ntle attention to how the democratic citizen-subject it requires might be summoned.\nMoreover, despite long-standing commitments to democratic participation in planning\ndecisions, in practice, high levels of anxiety attend to the identity of the citizens that turn\nup at the `end of the pipe' and their ability to meaningfully and legitimately participate\n(e.g. the `NIMBY' problem!).\nIn this article, I therefore argue that focusing attention on the subjectivities required\nof citizens can illuminate key aspects of the challenge of realising a more democratic\nform of planning (e.g. a form of planning within which all of those affected are able to\nparticipate in decisions either directly or through representative channels). My concern\nis to contribute to understandings of the ambiguous political potential that is opened up\nin the fields of power where citizens are called to meet state planning functions, drawing\nattention to both the normative construction of the `good citizen' in planning theory and\nthe often overlooked politics of citizen-subject formation in planning practice. Beyond\nthis, however, by adopting a `citizens' eye view', I also aim to highlight often hidden\ndimensions of citizens' experiences that have significant implications for understanding\nthe political and democratic possibilities of political participation in contemporary\nplanning.\nThe article is structured as follows: I begin by critically reviewing the qualities that\ndifferent theoretical conceptions of democratic planning might require of the citizen.\nFollowing this, I use examples from Scotland to contrast these normative constructions\nwith the limited forms of democratic citizenship currently invited in practice, drawing\nattention to a repertoire of techniques that use constructions of what constitutes `good'\nand `bad' citizenship to manage the conflict generated by development. These examples\nhighlight perhaps predictable failings of existing planning democracy from the perspec-\ntive of citizens `ignited'by a political culture that paradoxically encourages their engage-\nment but also defends against its disruptive effects. Finally, I go on to consider what the\nexperience of becoming politically active means for theories that seek to promote more\ndemocratic planning practices. I conclude that a focus on the forms and practices of citi-\nzenship fostered within the policy process helps to identify important aspects of the\nchange required to transform the democratic ethos of planning while also raising key\nconcerns about the demands that planning processes make of citizens in the name of\ndemocracy.\nThe `good citizen' in planning theory\nDeliberative (or collaborative or consensus-seeking) planning theory, influenced by\nHabermas' (1996) model of deliberative democracy, is premised on fostering inclusive\ndebate between all those with a `stake'in a decision in order to shape democratic agreement\nabout the best course of action. Agonistic planning theory, drawing particularly on the\nwork of Chantal Mouffe (1993, 2005), has been presented as a critical counter-point to\nagreement-seeking versions of communicative planning. For Mouffe, the political cannot\nexist without disagreement and any `consensus' can only ever be the stabilisation of an\nexisting balance of power. Pointing to the prevalence of conflict, strife and dispute in plan-\nning, agonistic planning theorists have argued for an alternative ethos premised on foster-\ning respectful disagreement to avoid the coercive dangers of the search for consensus.\nIncreasingly well-rehearsed debates between deliberative and agonistic planning the-\norists have focused largely on the extent to which communicative exchanges can or\nshould be geared towards shaping agreement or allowing the expression of disagree-\nment. However, as noted above, the qualities required of the citizen, and how such a citi-\nzenry might emerge and become committed to either a deliberative or agonistic\nconception of what constitutes good democratic planning remains underdeveloped (cf.\nNorval, 2007). In this section of the article, I therefore sketch (admittedly generalised)\npictures of the citizen that deliberative and agonistic theories of democracy would sum-\nmon into being. I then use these sketches to consider what this focus means for accounts\nof democratic planning.\n`The deliberative citizen'\nThe deliberative citizen commits to the idea that `that parties to political conflict ought\nto deliberate with one another and through reasonable argument try to come to an agree-\nment on policy satisfactory to all' (Young, 2001: 671). This requires her to engage in\nrational discussion within which she will forward reasons justifying her preferences and\nlisten to the arguments forwarded by others. Her aim is to achieve a rational consensus\n(or at least some temporarily binding agreement) through deliberative processes that\napproximate to Habermas' normative `ideal speech situation', characterised by perfect\ncommunication between actors with equal power.2\nDeliberation needs to be conducted sincerely, for example, with a faith in the pro-\ncess, respect for other participants and a commitment to acting with a communicative\nethos. This latter condition means that the deliberative citizen will not act strategically\nto pursue her own ends, but will earnestly seek to work with others to shape a rational\nagreement. While elements of interest-based `bargaining' and `fair compromise forma-\ntions' are widely accepted to be the best that can be hoped for in real-world conditions,\nin order to ensure that deliberation is free and equal and that only the force of the better\nargument is brought to bear on decisions, the deliberative citizen should commit to\nbracketing off the distorting influence of power on deliberation. She should therefore\n`check her privilege' and seek to ensure that such distortions do not enter into the\ndeliberative process.\nThe deliberative citizen is not necessarily required to leave her pre-existing beliefs,\nmotivations and interests outside of deliberation; however, she is required to enter into a\ncommunicative exchange with a willingness to reflexively reshape them through inter-\nsubjective dialogue (Chambers, 1996). Ideal forms of deliberation are also therefore a\npotentially transformative experience for the democratic subject, leading to new under-\nstandings of interests, preferences and even of deeply held individual and collective\nGiven this rather demanding set of requirements, considerable debate in both politi-\ncal and planning theory has focused not just on the (un)desirability of the deliberative\nideal, but also on the (im)possibility of achieving something approximating genuine\ndeliberation in real-world conditions (see, for example, Benhabib, 1996a). Key con-\ncerns have centred on the impossibility of truly bracketing power from deliberation\nand ensuring that all citizens have full `epistemological authority' in deliberative set-\ntings (e.g. Saunders, 1997; Young, 2001). This has led some advocates to question\nwhat commitment to a deliberative ethos means for the political activity of citizens\nwho would seek to achieve it in real-world settings? Young (2001) and Fung (2005)\nboth conclude that `deliberative activists' cannot always be expected to act delibera-\ntively but might be required to denounce their principles and adopt non-deliberative\nforms of political action in order to fight against unjust realities that make fair delib-\neration impossible.\nOthers, however, have gone further to ask whether and why citizens would choose to\norganise their collective affairs deliberatively in the first place (Saunders, 1997), particu-\nlarly where this presents such a challenging model of legitimate democratic behaviour.\nNorval (2007) further suggests that existing accounts of deliberative democracy do not\npay enough attention to the processes involved in becoming a democratic subject com-\nmitted to deliberation, for example, how can such a deliberative citizen be summoned\nand the requisite qualities fostered?\n`The agonistic citizen'\nFor Mouffe (1993), the agonistic citizen needs to identify with the broad principles of\nliberal democracy:\nWhat we share and what makes us fellow citizens in a liberal democratic regime is not a\nsubstantive idea of the good but a set of political principles specific to such a tradition: the\nprinciples of freedom and equality for all ... To be a citizen is to recognize the authority of such\nBy cultivating identification with these principles, the citizen accepts membership of a\npolitical community but not in a way that determines her identity \u00ad she remains free to\nargue between competing interpretations of freedom and equality. The citizen therefore\ndevelops an agonistic respect for other participants without being obliged in any way to\nstrive for agreement with them, taming the potentially antagonistic results of disagree-\nment such that `enemies' are redefined as `adversaries'.\nFor the agonistic citizen, the aim of political action within this community is to secure\nthe hegemonic position of a particular articulation of `freedom and equality for all'. This\nmeans articulating new demands to unsettle an existing hegemonic settlement that is the\nsedimentation of an historical set of power relations. The task of the `radical democratic'\ncitizen, Mouffe's normatively preferred mode of agonistic citizenship, is to articulate\n`chains of equivalence' that link together the demands of all those fighting against rela-\ntions of domination, creating new `us' and `them' identities in the process. The radical\ndemocrat is therefore a counter-hegemonic activist.\nMouffe also questions the strict requirements of rational deliberation laid out by\nHabermas and his followers, arguing that the effects of power are not a distortion of a\npotentially perfect form of communication but an intrinsic element of all communica-\ntion, i.e. there can be no ideal speech situation or communicative rationality that is\npower-free. Mouffe's agonism therefore encourages citizens to see politics not as rational\ndeliberation but as a passionate activity which draws on registers of affect, influencing\nactors' attachment to particular discourses. This means that the agonistic citizen is not\nbound by rules of rational argumentation and allows a wider range of political expression\nto be considered legitimate, including recourse to strategic and direct action, and rhetori-\ncal and symbolic forms of politics that are often potent symbols of conflict, bringing\npower out into the open so that it can be contested.\nAs Norval (2007) highlights, the agonistic focus on disagreement emphasises important\naspects of democratic practice, but also tends to neglect the necessary institutionalisation of\nany democratic ethos, for while democracy can and does act as a valuable disruptive force, it\nalso needs to `act as the medium in which general purposes become crystallized and enacted'\n(p. 55). An account of democracy that focuses only on the opening up of lines of disagree-\nment therefore seems less well equipped to explain how legitimate decisions can be reached\n(and what role reason giving and justification might be expected to play in such processes).\nBy opening democratic practice up to raw political passions, some critics also worry about\nthe potential dangers of unleashing and legitimising undemocratic forces (Benhabib, 1996b).\nHere, Mouffe's focus on the political as the expression of underlying antagonism arguably\nmilitates against the exploration of an ethos within which agreement is possible, where citi-\nzens may learn to make decisions together even across lines of difference.3\nUnderstanding the demands of democratic citizenship made by\nplanning theory\nKey agreement-seeking planning theorists like Healey (2006) have long argued that real-\nworld planning communication is unlikely to come close to the deep level of consensus\nTable 1.

They have also acknowl-\nedged the challenges of ensuring equality between participants in communicative\nexchanges, and the need to open up deliberation to different types of knowledge. More\nrecent work has taken account of the agonistic critique and seeks to emphasise the scope\nfor dealing with disagreement within agreement-seeking deliberations (Forester, 2012;\nInnes and Booher, 2010), highlighting key qualities that collaborative governance should\nAgonistic planning theory meanwhile, having emerged as a critical, deconstructive\nresponse, has begun to explore the institutional changes required to open up decision-\nmaking spaces to legitimate disagreement (e.g. Bond, 2011; M\u00e4ntysalo et al., 2011;\nPl\u00f8ger, 2004). Theorists have also recognised that the distance between their arguments\nand agreement-seeking models is not always pronounced. Few, for example, envisage\nplanning decisions that do not require the deliberative exchange of reasons (Bond, 2011).\nHillier (2002), following Benhabib (1996b), therefore, argues for forms of deliberation\nthat can do justice to the agonistic qualities of democracy. In this spirit, some recent work\nexplores how an agonistic ethos might help productively reframe deliberative debates\nIt is also clear from the discussion above, however, that ideal-typical deliberative\nand agonistic planning (or any blending of the two) would require the cultivation of\nspecific civic virtues, including particular conceptions of how the common good\nshould be understood and what constitutes legitimate political behaviour. This is sum-\nmarised in Table 1. Following Cruikshank (1999), each ideal-type normatively\nexpresses a `will to empower' that requires the production of citizen-subjects commit-\nted to what each takes to constitute the rights and responsibilities of good democratic\ncitizenship.4 However, questions about how such virtues are cultivated and what would\nlead people to commit to them as deliberative or agonistic citizens are not always\nclearly addressed (cf. Norval, 2007). This raises questions about how citizens within\n`precariously democratic societies' (Forester, 1989: 3) might acquire the democratic\nethos these theories require of them?\nMuch of the wider literature in political theory (e.g. Young, 2001), deliberative pol-\nicy-making (e.g. Dodge, 2010) and planning theory (e.g. Purcell, 2009) has arguably\ntended to focus on already committed and skilful political actors (e.g. activists, social\nmovements and campaign organisations). Debate has often focused on the kind of demo-\ncratic ethos and practices that open opportunities to such actors. Alternatively, the focus\nin planning theory on the role of professionals in fostering such qualities has perhaps\ntended to implicitly assume the presence of publics able to effectively deliberate pro-\nvided the spaces created for them are designed to be suitably inclusive. Hajer's (2003)\nnotion of `citizens on stand-by' also implies the presence of citizens who are already\ntechnically equipped to engage but simply need to be `ignited'. This is an understandable\nbias within bodies of work that make important contributions to understanding political\nand policy action. However, the lacuna in accounting for the process of becoming a com-\npetent citizen represents a significant gap for understanding the `end-of-the-pipe' mobi-\nlisation of `ordinary' (here meaning not previously politically active) citizens in\npolicy-political spaces. In the next section, I further explore aspects of this gap by con-\nsidering the identity of the `good citizen' in contemporary planning practice.\nThe `good citizen' in planning practice\nIn this section of the article, my focus shifts from the theoretical to the empirical.\nRecognising that both deliberative and agonistic planning theories are rooted in critique\nof actually existing democratic practices, my aim is not to develop an empiricist critique\nof the potential for emergence of either the agonistic or deliberative citizen. However, by\ncontrasting these models of democracy against prevailing modes of citizen-subject for-\nmation, I argue that it is possible to assess some of their critical potential and limitations.\nMoreover, this empirical encounter also reveals often hidden dimensions of the chal-\nlenges faced by `ordinary citizens' seeking to influence planning decisions.\nThe context of this search for the subject of a new democratic ethos is the recently\nreformed land-use planning system in Scotland. This section of the article therefore\ndraws on two related projects. The background analysis is informed by a research project\nthat investigated the `culture change' agenda that has accompanied a concerted pro-\ngramme of reform to the planning system since the reopening of a Scottish Parliament\nthrough devolution within the United Kingdom in 1999 (Inch, 2013). The bulk of the\nargument, however, reflects my ongoing involvement with a charity called Planning\nDemocracy (PD) that campaigns for a fair and inclusive planning system in Scotland.\nThis campaign has been informed by a project that gathered `citizens' stories' of partici-\npating in the reformed planning system, using these to make the case for change (see\nThe idea of collecting `citizens' stories' can be understood as an application of plan-\nning theory's productive engagement with story as a means of learning from and about\nplanning practices (e.g. Forester, 1999; Sandercock, 2003). All of the stories collected\ninvolved citizens active within community groups who had mobilised against unwanted\ndevelopment, typically they had formed to fight `end-of-the-pipe' battles against major\ndevelopment with significant environmental impacts. In total, more than 20 stories were\ncollected from a wide variety of geographical and socio-economic contexts, including\ncommunities living next to existing and proposed waste facilities, power stations, mines\nand quarries in the heavily populated `central belt' between Edinburgh and Glasgow;\nmajor container terminal and bridge developments up the east coast of Scotland; and\ncontroversial, large-scale housing proposals in and around existing settlements (Planning\nCitizens were invited to narrate their experiences chronologically, reflecting on key\nmoments in their engagement with the planning system. Most stories were collected\nthrough meetings in people's homes where notes were taken that were later written up\nand where possible sent to participants to check. In some other cases, citizens provided a\nwritten account of their own experiences. Methods were dictated by available resources,\na desire to make participants feel comfortable talking to us, and the aim of growing\nPlanning Democracy's network rather than by the imperatives of generating academic\nresearch material. As a result, the stories generated were not recorded or transcribed,\nlimiting the material available for subsequent writing-up and meaning, unfortunately,\nthat citizens' `voices' cannot readily be recounted here.\nThe stories collected were deliberately subjective and do not represent an exhaus-\ntively detailed account of participating in Scottish planning. However, those involved\nhave confirmed that they faithfully reflect their often striking experiences of being\n`ignited'as citizens in the planning process in Scotland, and the particular details reported\nhere have been checked by several of those involved to ensure that they are true to their\nexperiences. Below, I first discuss the ways in which `good' and `bad' forms of citizen-\nship are defined by the dominant culture of the planning system. I then explore how this\nshapes the experiences of citizens seeking to influence development.\nPro-growth planning, depoliticisation and the management of citizens\nThe land-use planning system in Scotland underwent major reform with the passing of\nthe Planning Etc. Scotland Act in 2006, the first time the Scottish Government had made\nuse of new powers to pass primary legislation in relation to planning since devolution.\nAs in reform initiatives elsewhere a range of diverse goals motivated change. Central to\nthe rhetoric of reform, however, were two key, potentially contradictory goals: to speed\nup decision-making in the interests of economic efficiency and to improve public partici-\npation in the system.\nWhile the government has acknowledged a tension between these goals, the balance\nbetween them has rarely been explicitly debated. However, since the onset of recession and\nthe election of a Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) administration `sustainable economic\ngrowth' has been further prioritised as the overarching purpose of the planning system\n(Scottish Government, 2010). The hegemonic position of pro-growth planning means that\ndevelopment is effectively synonymous with the public interest, the primary good that the\nplanning system should seek to promote. This suggests that participation is subordinate to\nthe goal of pursuing light touch planning and ensuring that any perceived `costs of delay'\nin decision-making are minimised in the interests of development and growth.\nThe commitment to development as a public good effectively elevates a conception of\nthe good above democratic rights to decide where the public interest lies in the use and\ndevelopment of land. In this context, continued commitment to the language of participa-\ntion, while remaining necessary to legitimize decisions, requires careful management.\nThis is a familiar feature of attempts to incorporate citizens into decision-making, creat-\ning tendencies towards tokenistic participation that is only able to recognise citizens'\nrights to a voice when it does not threaten the fundamental commitment to pro-growth\nplanning. More recently, this has been characterised as part of a post-political form of\nplanning, where the hegemony of growth requires the displacement of the political ener-\ngies that can be generated when citizens mobilise against development (e.g. Gunder and\nHillier, 2009). The management of this settlement through the participatory and repre-\nsentative democratic spaces in the Scottish planning system therefore draws on a range\nof what Cruikshank (1999) terms `technologies of citizenship' as it seeks to define the\n`good' citizen. Two key examples can illustrate the workings of such technologies: `the\neducation of the \"good\" citizen' and `labelling practices'.\nEducating the `good citizen'. Professionals have long expressed anxiety about the compe-\ntence of non-experts to make planning decisions (cf. Damer and Hague, 1971). In Scot-\nland, this has led to a renewed focus on the need to `educate' citizens and elected\nrepresentatives not just about the logic of the system but how much they should expect\nto influence its decisions. This is apparent in the work of Planning Aid Scotland (PAS),\nan organisation that provides an important free planning advice service through a net-\nwork of professional volunteers. As a body increasingly reliant on government funding\nfor its operations, however, PAS has become concerned to reconcile the public to the\nrealities of pro-growth planning:\nPAS believes that effective engagement must lie at the heart of the Scotland's planning system\n... However, PAS equally recognises that efficiency and effectiveness in supporting sustainable\neconomic growth is paramount. It is for this reason ... that PAS wishes to put before the\ncommittee its concern that public expectations of the planning system are being insufficiently\nmanaged in terms of opportunities and rights to oppose planning decisions. (PAS, 2012)\nThe idea of `managing public expectations' makes clear a desire to promote certain\nforms of participation. The education of citizens becomes less an effort to empower them\nto influence democratic planning decisions and more an exercise in `positioning' such\nthat they will play the role of the `good citizen'that the system makes up for them: active\ncitizenship is therefore encouraged as long as it does not become `activist' and threaten\nto frustrate development activity (cf. Newman, 2011).\nLabelling practices. In the logic of a system that seeks to legitimise development and where\nexpressions of oppositional citizenship are viewed as problematic, it is common for citi-\nzens to find themselves `labelled'or `positioned'in ways that undermine the legitimacy of\ntheir voice (Healey, 2012). The most widely used example of this in planning disputes is\nthe label `NIMBY', dismissing opposition to development as parochial and self-interested\n(Burningham, 2000; McClymont and O'Hare, 2008). In addition, however, professionals\noften question the representativeness of citizens' voices by reference to those who do\nparticipate as `the usual suspects', a group of typically well-educated and resourced citi-\nzens disproportionately able to pursue their particular interests.\nThe `usual suspects' are often contrasted against the spectre of the `silent majority'\nwhose interests professionals make claims to represent, often equating this with the ben-\nefits that development may bring. Such labelling practices are widespread within plan-\nning professionals' discussions of citizens who participate in Scotland; however, there is\ntypically less scrutiny of the `interests' or `representativeness' of other actors, for exam-\nple, developers, professionals themselves or elected politicians.\nAs with any such label, the element of potential truth within it (there may well be\nNIMBY opponents, `silent majorities' and `usual suspects') detracts attention from the\npolitical operation of such categories and the ways in which they serve to marginalise\ncertain voices, restricting citizens to certain compromised subject positions:5 those who\nparticipate are narrowly self-interested and therefore do not need to be listened to; the\nviews of those who do not participate can be inferred by professional or political `repre-\nsentatives' as the authentic voice of the `ordinary' citizen. As Clarke (2010) suggests,\ngovernmental strategies to enrol the moral authority of `ordinary citizens' into decision-\nmaking therefore produce a politics of claim-making where the power to speak as/for the\n`ordinary citizen' is a key stake. In this way, as Pl\u00f8ger (2004) notes, the logic of\nthe system is involved in constructing its own enemies and/ or refusing to recognise the\nlegitimacy of adversarial perspectives.\nThese examples outline two of the ways in which the hegemonic position of sustain-\nable economic growth is defended through the use of technologies of citizenship: the\neducation of citizens and labelling practices are techniques that limit the legitimacy of\npolitical challenges raised by end-of-the-pipe citizen mobilisation by predetermining\nboth `good' and `bad' subject positions for citizens. Below I consider such practices\nagainst the experiences of citizens who have sought to influence change through the\nplanning system, highlighting how people seek to resist the always uncertain power of\nsuch technologies of citizenship and questioning the potential consequences of their\ndeployment, both for those involved and for the democratic legitimacy of planning\ndecisions.\nBecoming a planning citizen\nBeing `ignited': issues, interests and values\nHajer's (2003) concept of `citizens on stand-by' suggests that the Scottish Government's\nkey aim of promoting a less adversarial planning culture by promoting earlier engage-\nment of the public does not readily correspond to the ways citizens typically come to be\n`ignited' by issues. This was certainly true of the majority of citizens and groups whose\nstories PD heard. Most were not `active citizens' aware of their rights and the opportuni-\nties available. They typically had little experience of political engagement or planning,\nsharing a broadly negative view of politics and often not understanding their actions as\n`political'. Many felt they had not chosen to get involved but had been summoned by the\nunexpected news that an application for development had been made close to where they\nlived. All were therefore part of a series of publics called into being by specific issues\nwith significant local impacts (Dewey, 1989; Leino and Laine, 2011). As such, their\nengagement was inherently adversarial, activated by their concern and typically opposi-\ntion to the development in question.\nMost of those PD met were homeowners, suggesting that this may be one key factor\nin shaping a sense of stake in the local environment; however, the preservation of prop-\nerty values was rarely cited as a primary motive for mobilisation in their respective\nlocal campaigns. Instead, a variety of factors seemed to have motivated citizens to react:\nthis included the disruption of valued place qualities (such as the loss of centuries old\nrights of way used by crofting communities in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant in\nthe Highlands; or of public parks whose protected `Common Good' land status was\nthreatened in Edinburgh), through to the health concerns that motivated citizens to react\nagainst the proposed development of energy-from-waste facilities (incinerators) in the\ncentral belt.\nMany citizens had become acutely aware of how others (including professionals and\ndevelopers) sought to label their campaigns in terms of narrow self-interest and were\nanxious to refute such a reductive categorisation, feeling that it denied their right to care\nfor the place they lived in or to articulate concern about issues raised by development.\nOne citizen who had waged a long-running campaign to have alternative economic\ndevelopment opportunities included in their local plan, only for a developer to win\napproval for an incinerator against community wishes, eloquently argued,\nWe did everything `by the book', followed all the appropriate procedures and yet we are going\nto be worse off than if we had never engaged with the Development Plan process, while the\nincinerator developer completely circumvented the process and the planning system supported\napproval of the application ... We are not Nimbys in this scenario ...\nThis highlights both a high degree of frustration with the process but also engagement\nwith a politics of recognition as she sought to contest the subject-positions she felt the\nsystem positioned her in.\nPeople often spoke of the emotional impacts involved in sustaining protracted cam-\npaigns, highlighting how deeply committed they had become to the issues in question.\nSuch commitments seem to consist of a complex mixture of perceived interests along-\nside sometimes deeply held beliefs and previously unacknowledged and emergent under-\nstanding of their own values. As in many aspects of life, these values sometimes\nencompass contradictory hopes, anxieties and concerns for their future, those of their\nfamilies and wider locality. The process of being ignited had often led people to under-\nstand not just the issues involved, but their local area and themselves in new ways. For\nexample, citizens ignited by another incinerator proposal in the central belt moved from\nvery immediate concerns for the health of their children and those of their neighbours to\nactive engagement with the perceived failings of local politics through to the need for\nnew national and European policy to make sure that other communities would not face\nthe same problems. This highlights how a limited focus on participants as rational actors\npursuing their self-interest cannot do justice to the complex realities of being `ignited'\nand illustrates the need to understand the identity of citizens who mobilise against\ndevelopment not as fixed and pre-existing but as at least somewhat fluid and emergent in\nrelation to the issues involved, drawing from previous life experiences, current life cir-\ncumstances and understandings of possible futures.\nKnowledge, tactics and resources\nFor all of those involved, the process of being `ignited', however reluctantly, had led to\na challenging period of learning for which few felt adequately equipped. Most spoke of\nthis as an ongoing struggle to understand how to influence decisions. In some places, this\nwas rendered easier by the presence of professional residents with knowledge of plan-\nning and an expectation that they were entitled to participate. In a couple of high-profile\ncases, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) provided further support and expertise.\nIn at least one more working-class community with a long history of living with environ-\nmentally intrusive land-uses, people spoke of a strong cultural barrier that needed to be\novercome because protesting `just isn't the kind of thing we do around here'. This illus-\ntrates how certain citizens and communities (typically professional and middle class) are\nlikely to be better equipped to represent themselves, or how others may be empowered\nto do so if an issue becomes a cause celebre. However, for all, this remained a major\nchallenge.\nAll of those PD met sought to engage and influence planning decisions through the\nwindows of opportunity afforded by the system, making and encouraging written repre-\nsentations, and attending relevant committee meetings (though in Scotland it is rare for\nthe public to be given the right to speak at such meetings). The process of navigating the\nsystem was, however, characterised by considerable confusion and frustration, involving\nmultiple wrong turns and the investment of large amounts of time and energy into letter\nwriting and research that could later prove entirely ineffective. All also spoke of an\nincredibly steep and energy sapping learning curve as they spent their evenings and\nweekends gaining the expertise they needed to frame arguments that would be valid in\n`planning terms'. Most felt that they were constantly struggling to keep abreast with\ndevelopments that seemed to proceed behind their backs as developers and local plan-\nning authorities met. As one of the anti-incinerator campaigners introduced above sug-\ngested, `We felt like we were getting on the train at the last stop, everyone else is more\nprepared, decisions seem to be already made'.\nEngaging in these official forms of deliberative activity was time consuming and\nlaborious, and involved community members communicating on the terms set by the\nexpert driven system. Many, sensing or experiencing real limits to the effectiveness of\nthis approach, also sought to register their opposition in other ways, organising commu-\nnity meetings and protests outside council meetings or on election days, seeking to gain\nlocal press coverage through direct action (e.g. by blocking roads with slow moving traf-\nfic or organising mass Christmas card writing campaigns to the Scottish Government).\nCitizens often felt that such forms of activism were more successful in generating popu-\nlar pressure, politicising issues and challenging elected representatives. However, the\nplanning system often remained impervious to such pressures. In a third campaign\nagainst an incinerator, the local community generated some 5000 objections influencing\nthe local authority's decision to refuse the application, only for the applicant to\nsuccessfully appeal to the Scottish Government (even had the original decision been\nupheld, in Scotland this would not have prevented the applicant from simply submitting\na revised scheme for the same site, potentially requiring a rerun of the entire process,\nsomething that many communities lived in real fear of given the time and energy\nrequired).\nCampaigns and relationship building\nOrganising a campaign group often brought people together and created new attach-\nments within local communities. However, the membership and strength of groups was\ntypically unstable, tending to dwindle over the extended life of many campaigns. Most\ncampaigns seemed to be sustained by the persistence of a small group of committed\nvolunteers who sought to mobilise others as and when possible to generate funds or write\nrepresentations. The framing of campaigns typically involved the articulation of a claim\nto represent a particular place and its qualities. This was not always accepted without\ncontestation, and in certain cases, disputes did develop between those for and against\ncertain developments. This was particularly visible in the case of the park in Edinburgh\nwhere `Common Good'land was proposed as the site of a new school \u00ad splitting the local\ncommunity and leading to a long-running and often bitterly contested struggle, including\nattempts to publicly `name and shame' opponents of the development.\nAs noted above, in some cases, NGO support provided links that could reinforce citi-\nzens' knowledge and ability to represent themselves. Online and personal communica-\ntion with other campaign groups fighting against similar developments were also\ncommon. However, even where citizens developed wider concerns for the issues raised\n(e.g. the development of incinerators), for most, the focus of their campaign remained\nnecessarily local, bound by the specific proposal involved and the logic of a planning\nsystem that is focused on site-specific decision-making (cf. Rootes, 2007).\nRelations between campaign groups and local authorities were mixed and often\nrelated to past experiences and the authority's view of the development in question.\nWhile many sought to keep lines of communication open and relations amicable, few\nfound planning officers sympathetic or willing to act as `guerillas in the bureaucracy' on\ntheir behalf (cf. Gonzalez and Vigar, 2008). Relations with elected representatives were\nalso often characterised by a general culture (and some specific histories) of mistrust.\nSometimes they were also frustrated by rules that limit elected officials to a quasi-\njudicial role in making planning decisions, preventing them from responding to many\ncommunity concerns or speaking publicly about issues they will later vote on.\nIn many cases, there seemed to be a tendency towards seeing officials in oppositional\nterms, viewing `them' and `the system' with considerable suspicion and campaigners\nregularly complained about the use of delaying tactics and misinformation to frustrate\ntheir activities (including e.g. local authorities `losing' large numbers of objections or\nannouncing consultation periods during school holidays).\nSome groups sought to engage with developers and in return certain developers too\nwere willing to reciprocate, sending representatives to meet with concerned citizens.\nHowever, it was more typical for relations of mistrust to characterise this relationship, with\nneither `side' willing to `reveal their hand' and each apparently withholding information\nfrom the other. Faced with concerted local opposition, moreover, communities often\nreported that developers employed a variety of coercive strategies. These ranged from the\nemployment of public relations specialists to conduct consultation exercises, to an unwill-\ningness to release background data (often by invoking `commercial confidentiality'),\nthrough to the issuing of threats of legal action against named members of community\ncouncils opposing projects. For example, in the case of the community who had cam-\npaigned positively for alternatives only for an incinerator application to be approved, a\nthreat by the developer to pursue legal action against campaigners led them to abandon a\npossible Judicial Review of the decision. Practices of this sort clearly sit outside any norms\nof democratic planning yet are rarely subjected to scrutiny.\nPublic participation, private lives\nOne of the striking aspects of all the stories was the extent to which campaigns became\na key part of people's lives, taking up large amounts of time and energy, often over a\nperiod of years. Citizens' reported not feeling able to go on holiday for several years for\nfear that the next stage of a process would be announced and their opportunity to respond\nbe gone by the time they returned. Some (who could) invested large amounts of money\nto fund the expertise required to participate effectively (e.g. planning, technical or legal\nadvice), for most, this required intensive fundraising efforts. Others, dealing with the\nthreat of legal action from developers, had to consider the possible consequences of their\ninvolvement. Many found it hard to reconcile the impacts that these battles had on their\njobs, businesses, family lives and even their health. These more private `costs of political\nparticipation' are rarely discussed in considerations of citizen mobilisation, yet here they\nwere central and often played a critical role in people's capacity to sustain engagement.\nThe costs of participation also influenced people's subsequent disposition towards politi-\ncal activity. The high levels of attrition found among community groups should be\nunderstood in this context \u00ad many people simply give up making space for such exhaust-\ning activity.\nTrajectories of political engagement\nFor some of those involved, their engagement had led them to remain politically active\nin planning matters, becoming proactively engaged in future rounds of local plan-\nmaking. Among the case studies, there were also examples of citizens who had gone on\nto studies in higher education for the first time, and others whose local engagement led\nto extensive engagement in national level debates. Some, becoming expert in particular\nissues, had joined wider activist networks or environmental NGOs to challenge the pol-\nicy positions that made certain forms of development acceptable (e.g. in the case\nrecounted above to question whether incineration is a waste disposal method that should\nbe acceptable in Scotland).\nFor many others, however, the experience proved disempowering, provoking feel-\nings of loss and even leading to anxiety states. Some, disabused of an implicit faith that\nthe system would prove transparent and reasonable, became somewhat cynical or mis-\ntrustful. Others, sometimes with long-running histories of alienation from officialdom,\nfound their hostility towards the local state reinforced. This was not necessarily directly\nrelated to the result of the process. Some groups were `successful' (at least temporarily,\nor were lucky enough that the proposed development did not materialise for e.g. com-\nmercial reasons); however, nearly all reported profound frustration and a sense that their\nvoices were not listened to. Most would have shared the view of one citizen who,\nreflecting on a long campaign against a major biomass development on the east coast,\nsuggested the process had left him `exhausted, disillusioned and frustrated'. Lying\nbeneath this was a feeling that the process was not transparent or accountable and that\ndecisions were less the product of democratic processes than of a deeply unjust system\ndesigned to ensure that development was imposed on local communities regardless of\ntheir views.\nDiscussion: in search of the subject of a new democratic\nethos\nHaving considered what is required of the citizen as a democratic actor in planning the-\nory and then outlined the reality of some citizens' experiences of becoming politically\nengaged in contemporary planning disputes, in this section of the article, I consider what\nhas been learned from this search for the subject of a new democratic ethos. As I do so, I\nconsider the implications this has for further research and thinking about the relationship\nbetween citizenship and democratisation of the politics of planning.\nCitizens' stories of becoming politically active in Scotland's planning system high-\nlight that both deliberative and agonistic conceptions of planning citizenship remain nor-\nmative ideals, operating at a remove from the rules that govern actually existing planning\npractices. These rules seem set up as a series of defences that protect an overarching\ncommitment to development as a public good. The commitment to development is dem-\nocratically determined by the Scottish Government, yet its legitimacy is limited and pro-\nposals often draw out tensions in citizens'willingness to accept this understanding of the\npublic interest. These tensions emerge as end-of-the-pipe conflict, and drawing out dif-\nferent expectations as to how the development of land should be governed. However, the\ncases gathered by PD in Scotland suggest that the ambiguous language of participation\nstruggles to provide either an effective means of neutralising this conflict or meaningful\nopportunities to democratise decision-making.\nCitizens `ignited' in response to planning issues in Scotland often draw on elements\nof both deliberative and agonistic political practice. As deliberative citizens they produce\nwritten representations and seek opportunities to engage in dialogue with decision-\nmakers. However, the inequality of arms between citizens and professionals ensures that\ndeliberation is neither fair nor inclusive. Some groups of citizens also therefore engage\nin direct action designed to influence representative decision-makers \u00ad a more agonistic\nform of political practice. However, the planning system is also set up to defend against\nsuch raw political energies. In short, those summoned by the planning system in Scotland\nare not currently invited to participate as either deliberative or agonistic citizens.\nThe hegemonic position of pro-growth planning in Scotland means that there are seem-\ningly very few advocates for more democratic planning at present. The effects of reces-\nsion and ongoing reform initiatives have consolidated acceptance of the overarching\nimperative of growth. This has led to a focus on improving efficiency in decision-making\nand on developing relations between local authorities and the development sector in order\nto facilitate development more effectively \u00ad building cultures within which the politicisa-\ntion of plans or proposals through representative or participatory democratic channels\nreadily comes to be seen as a problem that must be defended against (Inch, 2013).\nIn contrast to the mobilisation of systemic defences against potentially disruptive\nchallenges to pro-growth planning, both deliberative and agonistic theories of planning\ntherefore retain critical potential: each is capable of highlighting failures in the\ndemocratic quality of existing decision-making. Notwithstanding differences in the dem-\nocratic ethos each would seek to cultivate, for advocates of either deliberative or agonis-\ntic planning democracy, there is a need to bridge the gap between theory and practice in\norder to argue for the further democratisation of planning democracy, challenging the\nlimited ways in which citizens are currently invited to participate and pushing to\nstrengthen rights to democratic participation against the hegemonic claims of (neo)lib-\neral private property rights. One key challenge for such advocates is to work through the\nlimitations of current approaches to participation to highlight the failure of existing dem-\nocratic channels, using this as a basis from which to argue for change. From this perspec-\ntive, the agonistic emphasis on contestation and struggle in unsettling existing settlements\nand constituting new claims for democratisation seems particularly important.\nIndeed, from the experiences recounted above, an agonistic mode of planning citizen-\nship perhaps offers a more promising account of citizens' initial mobilisation in end-of-\nthe-pipe planning disputes. In such cases, citizens define themselves through the\narticulation of lines of difference between `them'(developers and often local authorities)\nand `us'(claiming to represent a local community). In establishing such adversarial posi-\ntions, there is a confrontation between very different logics of appropriate action: that of\nthe market-led planning system and that of citizens staking a claim to democratically\ninfluence development that affects their lives. However, too strong an attachment to such\n`them' and `us' identities may also militate against effective relationship building and\nrisk sliding into intransigent, cynical or antagonistic position-taking that can foreclose\nother, more deliberative possibilities (Healey, 2012). This suggests a need to further\nexplore how citizens can harness the agonistic qualities of end-of-the-pipe conflict and\nyet shape forms of policy-politics that remain alive to the possibilities of deliberation.\nThe experiences of citizens and their struggles for recognition within the planning sys-\ntem in Scotland also therefore reaffirm a need for normative theories of democratic plan-\nning to further consider the qualities they require of the citizen and how these might be\nactively fostered.\nGoing further, however, these citizens'experiences highlight that the heroic figures of\nthe agonistic activist and the reasonable deliberator present only a partial picture of the\nqualities required by the everyday politics of many planning disputes. As noted above,\nexisting literature tends to stress how already ignited political actors adopt a mix of tac-\ntics to pursue their goals: sometimes participating as good deliberative citizens but at\nother times adopting more agonistic forms of political practice. The citizens' stories that\nPD collected provide further evidence to endorse such an approach. However, they also\nhighlight the struggles experienced by ordinary citizens as they mobilise and seek to\nunderstand how they can influence planning decisions. Most were not self-consciously\npolitical actors who thought of themselves as activists (indeed, in many cases, this was\ndefinitely not how they understood themselves); their process of `ignition' was far from\nautomatic. Rather, they were `reactive citizens', struggling to learn and explore a reper-\ntoire of practices that often sorely tested their knowledge, resources and persistence. If\n`ordinary' citizens' experiences represent an increasingly significant form of political\nengagement in `precariously democratic societies' (Forester, 1989: 3), then it seems cru-\ncial to learn from them to inform campaigns for better democratic planning.\nIn general, localised, end-of-the-pipe mobilisation has tended to be viewed with some\nsuspicion. Within planning, it is often casually equated with NIMBYism and related\nmistrust of the motivations of those involved, for example, the potentially perverse\neffects of intensive local opposition displacing problems onto others less able to repre-\nsent their interests (concerns that may sometimes be well placed but should also not be\nuniversally assumed). This has often been part of a justification for attempts to involve\npeople early on in the production of plans and strategies, i.e. before site-specific conflicts\nemerge. Less technocratically, within urban environmental politics and social movement\nstudies, local mobilisations are often seen as lacking progressive credentials where they\ndo not readily `jump scale'to provide a broader challenge to economic or state structures\n(Rootes, 2007), with radical potential only existing where universal claims emerge from\nparticular struggles (Griggs and Howarth, 2008).\nAs Hajer (2003) suggests, the increasingly pervasive nature of end-of-the-pipe mobi-\nlisation suggests a need to find ways of working with the intensive political energy that\ncan emerge at the local level. More than this, however, there is also a need to further\nunderstand the democratic subjects who emerge in such spaces, accepting that the `activ-\nist' figure familiar in much academic writing does not immediately fit with the self-\nunderstanding and behaviour of many `ordinary citizens' who find themselves in such\ncircumstances (cf. Jupp, 2012 on other forms of `everyday' or `ordinary' activism). The\nexperiences PD collected show how the intensely local dynamics of planning conflicts\ncan generate very different trajectories of personal political engagement. With reference\nto planning theory's long-standing interest in planning as a process of social learning\n(Friedmann, 1987), this suggests a need for further research to understand the `learning\ncurve' involved in becoming a planning citizen, the different trajectories such political\nmobilisation can generate and what motivates the journeys taken by different citizens.\nFurther work might also develop a more empirically rich understanding of the longer\nterm dynamics generated by local planning conflicts, considering when and under what\ncircumstances end-of-the-pipe involvement might lead on to either involvement at more\nstrategic levels of planning or to the articulation of more `universal' political claims.\nThe stories collected by PD also highlighted the mobilisation of strong political ener-\ngies that `gripped' people in more than simply self-interested or purely cognitive ways.\nThe refusal of the planning process to acknowledge and work with such emotional con-\ncerns severely limits the potential to do justice to such energies. Instead, they are often\ndisplaced onto the private lives of those involved or occasionally reflected back into\nconflicts within local communities. The high costs of political participation borne by\nthose citizens who mobilise through the planning system are, however, rarely addressed\nwithin existing literature. This omission detracts attention from a major set of impacts\nthat require greater scrutiny, potentially reconfiguring understanding of the `mediating'\nresponsibilities of public professionals in managing the suffering and harm that planning\nprocesses can generate. That the experience of struggle imposes often unreasonable\ndemands on citizens also presents a salutary corrective to any tendency to romanticise\nthe agonistic emphasis on conflict, highlighting a need for a form of democratic planning\nthat can also care for the citizens it engages, fully considering what `respectful disagree-\nment' should mean for all participants. Given that another significant outlet for unac-\nknowledged emotional energy may be its projection onto the local state, this also raises\nquestions about the long-term impacts that the operation of `systemic defences' may\nhave on the legitimacy of democratic planning (cf. Inch, 2012).\nAlthough jarring with the long-standing assertion that planning is political rather\nthan the preserve of any specialist technical expertise, pervasive anxieties about the\ncapacities and interests of the citizens (and elected representatives) who do engage\nsuggest wariness about entrusting decisions to democratic processes. For many, the\nopening up of planning decisions to a more nakedly and passionately political process\nmay threaten good decision-making or risk empowering already privileged groups to\npursue reactionary interests. Such concerns further highlight the responsibility of plan-\nners to recognise and find ways to channel the political energies that planning issues\ngenerate.\nWhile Huxley and Yiftachel (2000) are surely right to argue that planning is about\nmore than decision-rules, the debate between an agonistic opening up of disagree-\nment and a deliberative desire for consensus at some level does revolve around creat-\ning legitimate procedures for taking decisions, recognising as Mansbridge (1996)\nargues that there are necessarily coercive elements to democratic decision-making.\nDebate must then revolve around who wins and who loses from any given set of\nrules, who is coerced, how, when and why. Within this picture, enhanced procedural\nrights are not a sufficient condition for just planning (Porter, 2014), but they remain\nnecessary as part of a struggle to democratise decisions about the use and develop-\nment of land in established liberal democracies. Indeed, many of the stories that PD\nheard highlight the importance of a sense of procedural justice to citizens operating\nwithin such spaces.\nThe argument I have developed here further suggests that procedural rules must also\nrecognise that they make a wider range of demands of citizens than has typically been\nacknowledged. Arguably, existing theories too readily assert the virtues of democratic\ncitizenship while paying less attention to the demands they make of citizens. In practice\nmeanwhile, rules often seem concerned to defend a commitment to development as a\npublic good rather than foster robust and inclusive debate about how places should\ndevelop. As a result, planning processes do little to engage the energies citizens bring\nwhile often imposing significant hidden costs on them.\nConclusion\nIn this article, I have explored what democratic planning requires of the citizens it would\nseek to engage. Outlining requirements of the deliberative and agonistic citizen, I have\nargued that much existing theory does not fully acknowledge the demands it would make\nof these ideal citizen-subjects and has therefore sidestepped a significant challenge for\nthe project of shaping more democratic planning practices. Tracing this through into\npractice, I have highlighted how various `technologies of citizenship' can be used to\ndefend against the potentially disruptive effects of end-of-the-pipe citizen mobilisation\nwithin pro-growth planning cultures. By listening to the experiences of citizens ignited\nby such end-of-the-pipe struggles, I have sought to highlight ways in which agonistic and\ndeliberative planning theories retain both critical potential and limitations. However,\nbeyond this, I have suggested that citizens' experiences raise further issues that have not\nbeen widely considered in existing debates. Drawing attention to the presence of a range\nof hidden costs, I have argued that they raise significant questions about the demands that\nare made of people in the name of democracy. In doing so, I have pointed to the need for\nfurther consideration of what political participation requires of citizens, the forms of\ndemocratic learning that they engage in and the broader significance of their political\nparticipation. Overall, the experiences of the `ordinary citizens' drawn on here point\ntowards a different, as yet unacknowledged demand, a demand for democratic planning\nprocesses that can care for the citizens they summon while fully and fairly engaging the\npolitical energies they bring. It is a demand that remains to be addressed in both theory\nand practice.\n"
