In the United States, Donald Trump surprised friend and\nfoe with his election to the US Presidency, and during the primaries Bernie Sanders\nmanaged to attract a large share of dissatisfied Democrats. Similar developments\nhave been taking place for a longer series of election cycles in Europe. Until\nrecently, most of the headlines concerned radical right parties. In the aftermath\nof the elections to the European Parliament in May 2014, for instance, many\nnews outlets designated the electoral victory of the Front National (FN) in\nFrance and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in Britain as a\npolitical `earthquake'.1 The recent successes of parties such as Alternative fu\n\u00a8 r\nDeutschland (AfD) in Germany, Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) in the\nNetherlands and the Movement for a better Hungary (Jobbik) also demonstrate\nhow radical right parties have become important political forces in almost all\nEuropean countries. Yet radical left parties have experienced a simultaneous rise\nin success. Parties like Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain are gaining ground\nelectorally, attracting much journalistic and academic attention, shock, and awe\ntowards the radicalisms on both extremes of the political spectrum.\nImportant to the future of democratic governance is not just understanding the\ncharacteristics of the parties manifesting these radicalisms, but also understanding\nthe motives and characteristics of voters giving radicalisms their political power and\nfuture. Unfortunately, existing scholarly and popular discussions of radicalism\noffer limited insight into what drives radical left as opposed to radical right\nvoters. Studies on the party level have suggested that radical left and radical\nright parties have plenty in common. Both party families have been shown to be\nnationalist (Burgoon, 2013; Halikiopoulou et al., 2012), eurosceptic (Hooghe et al.,\nthat also voters for these parties may resemble each other, two recent studies have\nfound that radical left and right voters share key political desires and discontents,\nand come from similar social strata (Lubbers and Scheepers, 2007; Visser et al.,\n2014). Although these studies have encountered important differences between the\ntwo electorates--especially some ideological attributes and levels of education--\nsuch differences do not constitute the central focus of study or receive a theoretical\naccounting. The emphasis on commonalities instead of differences is strengthened\nby the pervasiveness of the concept of `populism'. Populism is often defined as the\npolitical message that the good people are neglected, exploited or corrupted by an\nevil elite (see Mudde, 2004). This message can regularly be encountered among\nboth radical left- and radical right-wing politicians. The present focus on populism\nincreases the attention to what parties like the FN in France and Podemos in Spain\nhave in common instead of what divides them. The existing literature, hence,\nprovides a portrait of radical left and right voters in which differences are excep-\ntions that prove a rule: that the similarities among radicalisms are the principal\npattern of importance to electoral democracy.\nIn this article we take issue with this portrait. Our main argument is that radical\nleft and right bases should be seen as splinters from the party families with which\nthey are commonly associated. While they may well share discontent and economic\nvulnerabilities, they can also be expected to express the traditions and sentiments\nassociated with their respective mainstream counterparts, particularly with respect\nto (non-)egalitarian and (non-)altruistic values, and with respect to (anti-)cosmo-\npolitanism that can be clearly linked to such values. We test our expectations\nthrough analysis of European voters and support for radical right and radical\nleft parties, using seven waves of European Social Survey (ESS) data (from 2002\nAlthough our analysis uncovers similarities between the support bases of the two\nparty families, the data also reveal major differences that manifest the legacies of\nleft versus right orientation.\nOur findings are important to understanding contemporary democratic politics.\nThey reveal that, although voters for the radical left and the radical right have a lot\nin common in socioeconomic terms, such voters also differ in fundamental respects\nthat mirror well-known differences between the mainstream left and mainstream\nright. These differences can be expected to shape European politics for years to\ncome, not only in national political arenas, but also the supranational EU arena,\nwhere radical left and right parties sometimes collaborate with each other, at least\nwithin their respective party families. The distinctions between multiple radical left\nand right parties suggest that national and European party systems are likely to\nface increasing polarization in attitudes and positioning toward the EU, immigra-\ntion, law-and-order and inequality.\nRadical parties and radical voters\nRadical parties on both the left and the right are increasingly successful in Europe.\nAs a result of, among other factors, increasing electoral volatility (Van der Meer\net al., 2012), growing media attention for radical parties (Boomgaarden and\nVliegenthart, 2007; Walgrave and De Swert, 2004), and the rising salience of issues\nthat these parties `own': immigration, Islam and security for the radical right; socio-\neconomic inequality and the financial crisis for the radical left; and European inte-\nEuropean countries are now seriously challenged by at least one credible radical\nparty. What makes these radical parties so attractive to voters?\nWhen it comes to the radical right, extensive study has delineated key explana-\nnationalist parties, meaning that they strive for congruence of the political unit\n(the state) and the cultural unit (the nation). Yet radical right parties endorse a\nxenophobic form of nationalism that can be called `nativism'. In Mudde's useful\nformulation, nativism `holds that states should be inhabited exclusively by mem-\nbers of the native group (``the nation'') and that non-native elements (persons and\nideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state' (Mudde,\n2007: 19). Modern European radical right parties also tend to be populist: they\nemploy a discourse portraying `the good people' as exploited, betrayed, neglected\nor corrupted by `an evil elite' (Mudde, 2007; Rooduijn, 2014). The radical right\nparty family constitutes a homogeneous party family. Although radical right par-\nties often differ from each other regarding ethical issues, the party family is as or\nmore homogenous than are, for instance, the conservative or liberal party families\nVarious studies have shown that those who vote for radical right parties come\nfrom lower socioeconomic positions. Such voters are generally less educated, tend to\nhave lower incomes and come from `lower' social classes, and are more likely to be\nvariables affect vote choice, mediated by attitudes like preferences toward immigra-\ntion, European unification, law-and-order, and political cynicism (Arzheimer, 2009;\nWhile radical right voters may tend to have lower socioeconomic positions, it does\nnot follow that citizens from lower socioeconomic strata are automatically inclined\nto vote for the radical right. These citizens might just feel equally attracted to the\nradical left. Indeed, studies of voting behavior have long found that people with\nlower socioeconomic positions tend to vote for left-wing parties, whereas citizens\nfrom higher socioeconomic strata are more likely to vote for right-wing parties\n(Evans, 2000). This has made sense, as left parties have long called for decreasing\nincome differences by redistributing welfare, whereas right-wing parties tend to\noppose such state intervention. While differences between the traditional left and\nright have blurred over the years, radical left parties continue to decry the skewed\nsocioeconomic structure of contemporary capitalism, and to advocate reducing\ninequalities through far-reaching redistribution and through major changes in eco-\nnomic and power structures (March, 2011: 8\u00ad9). Radical left parties also strongly\ncriticize the `neo-liberal' character of global and European economic integration.\nThis agenda should appeal to the same lower-class, economically vulnerable voters\nassociated with radical right parties. Ramiro (2016) has indeed found that those who\nvote for radical left parties tend to be those who identify with the working class.\nRadical distinction\nStudies of radical right and radical left parties uncover, as expected, patterns\nof support broadly in line with such possibilities. Both party families have been\nfound in their position-taking to be broadly nationalist (Burgoon, 2013;\n(Rooduijn and Akkerman, 2017). As for voters for radical parties, Lubbers and\nScheepers (2007) found that citizens with lower incomes and from lower classes\n(manual workers) are more inclined to vote for both the radical left and right.2\nVisser et al. (2014) come to similar conclusions, focusing on the subjective position-\ning of citizens as extreme left or right based on their self-placement on a 0 to 10 left-\nto-right scale. These studies have unearthed important differences between radical\nleft and right voters. Supporters of the radical right tend to be less educated than\nother voters, while voters for the radical left tend to be more educated. And Visser\net al. (2014) find attitudinal differences between the radical left and right, revealing\ndistinct orientations on redistribution and ethnic diversity. In these studies,\nhowever, such differences are not explained or further examined theoretically\nor empirically. Indeed, the broad tenor of existing studies is that the individual\nsocioeconomic profiles of support for the radical left and right are more common\nthan distinct.\nIt is important to look more closely, however, into differences between radical left\nand radical right voters, and to explore whether support for radical left and radical\nright parties reflects, or fundamentally departs from, the orientations of the party\nfamilies with which they stem. Well-known differences between left and right with\nrespect to the state and markets may in some respects fade and in other respects get\namplified once one gets to the radical left and right. In any event, empirical differ-\nences characterize support for the radical left and for the radical right, belying any\nsimple explanation--for instance the higher education levels of radical left compared\nto radical right supporters. These patterns and enigmas need fuller examination\nin light of what `left' and `right' mean in contemporary politics--reckoning with\nsingle or multi-dimensional conceptions of the electoral political space (cf. Van der\nArgument: The party-ideological roots of distinct radicalisms\nWe argue that differences in voter support for radical left and for radical right\nparties--that is, `radical distinctions'--reflect the socioeconomic interests but also\nnormative preferences associated with the broader and deeper historical traditions\nof the `left' and `right'. Whether voter positions underlie or are cued by party\norientations (Ezrow et al., 2011), voters supporting the radical left and right can\nbe expected to share important commonalities but also to be divided by differences\nin economic positions and social attitudes. On the one hand, both party families\nhave traditions favoring representation of socially and economically disadvantaged\ncitizens, and both traditions share extreme offshoots from mainstream movements,\nexpressing outspoken political and economic discontent, distrust, and protest. On the\nother hand, classic and well-known left-right distinctions predict very different nor-\nmative bases for the radical left and right. Radical left supporters, in direct contrast\nto their radical right counterparts, can be expected to harbor economically egalitar-\nian and altruistic views. These crucial distinctions, in turn, can be expected to under-\ngird important differences in the way radical left and right voters view the promise\nand pitfalls of globalization. All such differences, finally, make sense of the stark\ncontrast in the education levels of radical left and right voters.\nWe argue that radical left and radical right voters are, like mainstream voters,\nideological voters (see Van der Brug et al., 2000). Radical voters' attitudes about\nthe policy issues they deem important are decisive for vote choice, such that\nvoters choose a party that is ideologically proximate. This often boils down to\na choice for a party with either a left-wing or a right-wing ideology.3 Once this\nmain ideological choice is made, other factors determine for which specific party\nan individual votes. We believe that those with lower socioeconomic positions are\nmore likely to vote for radical parties because these parties better address their\neconomic struggles and political concerns (see below). Hence, a voter with a low\nsocioeconomic status (SES) who is politically and economically discontented and\nholds a left-wing ideology will likely vote for a radical left party, whereas a\nsimilar voter with right-wing positions will be prone to vote for a radical right\nparty. In other words, both radical left and right voters will most likely have\nlower socioeconomic positions and stronger feelings of economic and political\ndiscontent compared to the average voter. However, they will be completely dif-\nferent from each other in terms of their principal voting motivations: their main\nideological attitudes.\nThis puts the onus on where and how the relevant ideological attitudes are\noverlapping or contrasting. We argue that one can deduce areas of both overlap\nand contrast from the histories of broader left and right party families. We begin by\ndiscussing the areas of overlap, or similarities, but we focus more on differences,\ndeveloping three sets of hypotheses on how radical left and radical right diverge in\ntheir ideological positioning: Hypotheses on normative-ideological differences con-\ncerning (economic) egalitarianism and the responsibilities and role of government\nin support of such egalitarianism; hypotheses on differences on issues of national-\nism versus cosmopolitanism; and hypotheses on differences concerning the charac-\nter and implications of a voter's education.\nShared interests and discontents\nBoth radical left and right parties, in contrast to their mainstream counterparts, are\nfocused on representing the social and economically vulnerable to have grown\nfrustrated with the mainstream. This shared focus, whatever its particular origins,\npredicts that the socioeconomic interests and profiles of those supporting the rad-\nical left and right ought to converge. Economic and demographic conditions that\nhave been found to cause or select for economic risk or vulnerability--lower-class\nprofessional orientation, unemployment, low income--can therefore be expected to\ndistinguish both radical right and radical left voters from their mainstream\ncounterparts.\nBoth radical left and radical right voters have also been shown to share strong\nanger towards conventional politics and the economy. They often express deep\ndissatisfaction with the functioning and stewardship of the economy and govern-\nment, and express low trust in politicians and political institutions (Rydgren, 2007).\nTheir party platforms often have at their center radical changes to government\ninstitutions and policies, albeit usually within the ambit of the democratic process\nRadical distinctions in statism and egalitarianism\nBeyond these important commonalities, the normative ideological traditions histor-\nically associated with left and right can be expected to attract different kinds of voters\nto distinct left and right radicalisms. Consistent with the historical traditions of the\nleft and right in 20th century European politics, the party families sharply clash on\nnormative ideals related to economic justice and to the state's economic intervention\nin pursuit of such justice. The first manifestation of such normative ideals is broad\neconomic egalitarianism. This commitment has been central to leftism of all\nshades--particularly when related to economic equality of outcome or opportunity.\nAnd it has not been shared by right-wing partisan discourse and positioning; in fact,\nmany right-wing parties reject such egalitarianism in favor of embracing economic\ndifference based on birth, ability, or wealth (Klingemann et al., 2006). This distinc-\ntion on economic egalitarianism might well be part of a broader distinction with\nrespect to egalitarianism generally--encompassing not only economic but also pol-\nitical and social equality of opportunity and condition. But we suspect that the\neconomic face of egalitarianism is as important as any in the ideological distinctions\nbetween left and right. Hence, this contrast on economic egalitarianism can be\nexpected to yield a major difference between left and right radicalism.\nH1: Voters who support economic egalitarianism (equality of opportunity and effect\nin economic life) are more likely to vote for radical left parties compared to main-\nstream parties, but not more likely to vote for radical right parties compared to\nmainstream parties.\nRelated to this commitment is an other-regarding altruism or compassion histor-\nically associated with left parties and left voters--as in the Anglo-American con-\ncept of `do-gooder' altruism. This pattern is less discussed as a symbol of the left.\nBut there is clear reliance on such rhetoric more on the left than the right, often\nrelated to the collective ideals of fairness in opposition to Darwinian individualism\n(Zettler and Hilbig, 2010). There is some substantial evidence that various mani-\nfestations of `altruism' and other-regarding (or `socio-tropic') concern yield more\nleft-wing rather than right-wing voting (Mutz and Mondak, 1997; Zettler and\nHilbig, 2010). Moreover, studies in political psychology have shown that the\nBig Five personality trait of Agreeableness--characterized by trust towards\nothers, tolerance, and altruism (Costa et al., 1991)--also affects radical left and\nright voting. Individuals scoring high on Agreeableness (i.e. those who are trustful\nand altruistic) tend to be concerned about welfare and solidarity, and are more\nlikely to hold a left-wing ideology and vote for a (radical) left-wing party\n(Chirumbolo and Leone, 2010). Those who score low on this trait, however,\nhave been shown more likely to experience an ``immigrant threat'', and therefore\nmore likely to vote for radical right parties (Aichholzer and Zandonella, 2016).\nWe deduce from this pattern that altruism increases the likelihood of voting for the\nradical left, but decreases that of voting for the radical right.4\nH2: Voters who express altruism (other-regarding concern for the wellbeing of others)\nare more likely to vote for radical left parties compared to mainstream parties, but less\nlikely to vote for radical right parties compared to mainstream parties.\nThe historical differences between left and right not only concern major ends, such\nas economic egalitarianism, but also the means to achieve such ends. The most\nimportant of these concerns the role of the state or government to intervene in the\neconomy in pursuit of egalitarian or altruist principles. This is a central dividing\nline between mainstream left and right in most contemporary democracies\n(Castles and Mair, 1984; Korpi, 1983). Left-wing voters and parties embrace inter-\nventionist government policies to regulate and humanize market economies and\npromote egalitarianism and wellbeing of the poor. Some radical right parties have\nexpressed support for state interventions to help the deserving poor, albeit often\nwith a welfare chauvinist tendency. Yet, because such positions only touch upon\nsuch issues, often amidst conflicting or exclusionary standards, we do not expect\nradical right-wing voters to differ from mainstream voters.\nH3: Voters who embrace an active government or state to intervene in the economy to\npromote economic egalitarianism are more likely to vote for radical left parties com-\npared to mainstream parties, but not more likely to vote for radical right parties\ncompared to mainstream parties.\nRadical distinctions in nationalism/anti-globalization\nThe above differences should also have strong implications for attitudes of radical\nleft and right voters with respect to globalization. Various studies show that the\nleft-to-right political spectrum harbors a horseshoe-shaped pattern in euroscepti-\ncism of party platforms (Hooghe et al., 2002) and anti-globalization generally in\nsuch platforms (Burgoon, 2013).5 Recent studies of radical left and right supporters\nhave also found this U-curve of euroscepticism to unite the two extremes\nvariation in the kinds of nationalism embraced in radical left and radical right\nplatforms--with the former engaging in more civic nationalism and the latter\nmore ethnic or xenophobic nationalism. Yet both radicalisms share `a common\ndenominator' of euroscepticism.\nThis portrait of radical left and radical right voters sharing strong nationalism\nmay need some revision in light of the arguments and hypotheses developed above.\nThe same SES and normative-ideological attitudes towards egalitarianism and\ngovernment economic activism that we hypothesized to undergird distinct left and\nright radicalisms can be expected to strongly color the attitudes on globalization. In\nparticular, the socio-economic conditions and normative positioning on egalitar-\nianism can be expected to cut in the same direction for the radical right, but in\nopposite directions for the radical left. For the radical right parties and their sup-\nporters, low SES and anti-egalitarianism and anti-economic activism push voters\ntowards anti-European integration, anti-globalization, and anti-immigrant atti-\ntudes. With respect to immigrants, for instance, economic insecurity for radical\nright parties dovetails with their rejection of egalitarianism or equal treatment.\nFor radical left voters, on the other hand, the SES and attitudes on egalitarian-\nism and state activism cut in opposite directions. On the one hand, the low SES of\nvoters ought to make them likely `losers' of globalization, including with respect to\nthe skewed labor-market competition posed by immigration. On the other hand,\nvoters embracing egalitarian and altruist values and believing in the propriety of\neconomic interventions to uphold those values might have offsetting attitudes\ntowards globalization. Their commitment to redress inequities might make them\nsee globalization, including immigration flows, as threatening less-skilled citizens\nand communities (Mansfield and Mutz, 2009). But that same commitment might\nfoster substantially less anti-globalization and anti-immigrant attitudes in particu-\nlar--as newcomers can be seen as deserving equal treatment even in a world with\nsubstantial borders and inequalities (Pantoja, 2006).\nSuch logic suggests that radical left and radical right voters harbor distinct anti-\nglobalization attitudes. Radical left voters and parties, unlike right counterparts,\ncan be expected to be particularly focused on the inegalitarian aspects of global-\nization (i.e. opposing a `Neo-liberal Europe' but not a `Social Europe'). And we\ncan expect radical left and right voters to have very different atittudes on immi-\ngration, where the equality, equal treatment, and social inclusion of newcomers\ndivide the left and right. On top of such logic from our above analysis, the histor-\nical and mainstream left has been found to have strong ties to globalism and\nought to moderate any nationalism among the radical left as opposed to radical\nright voters. To conclude, although the radical left and right electorates share a\nnegative attitude toward European integration, they likely differ radically vis-a\n` -vis\ntheir attitudes regarding the immigration face of globalization.\nH4: Voters who are more anti-immigration are more likely to vote for radical right\nparties compared to mainstream parties, but less likely to vote for radical left parties\ncompared to mainstream parties.\nRadical distinctions in education\nEducation is an important measure of SES relevant to skill-profile and economic\nrisk: the more educated (European) voter will be more equipped with the skills in\ndemand in the modern global economy, and less likely to be attracted to radical left\nor right parties. This should apply in equal measure to left and right radicalism.\nYet, education also shapes and ideas about the global economy and internation-\nalism in ways that foster cosmopolitanism. Education has been found to spur pro-\nglobalization and pro-immigration attitudes among voters, via cosmpolitanism and\nnot just or mainly of skill premia (Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2010; Hainmueller\nand Hopkins, 2014). Education is also associated with reduced levels of euroscepti-\ncism (Hakhverdian et al., 2013), and higher levels of cosmopolitanism directly\n(Mau et al., 2008). Education can be expected to lead to straight-ahead and con-\nsistent rejection of radical right parties--with respect to the intervening link of\ncosmopolitanism, not just the intervening link of lowering socioeconomic risk.\nBut with respect to support for radical left parties, more education can be expected\nagain to have offsetting implications. More educated individuals may experience\nless economic frustration that plausibly underlie both left and right radicalism.\nHowever, via their education, these individuals may also have a more cosmopolitan\nembrace of global interaction and of egalitarian treatment of immigrants. It is\npossible, of course, that education plays out in ways that constitute two distinct\nbases for radical left support--on the one hand, those of low SES including edu-\ncation, who embrace the state-activist egalitarianism and nationalism; and on the\nother hand, those of higher SES who support the same but also the equal treatment\nof immigrants. In general, education should play out differently for radical left and\nradical right voter support.\nH5: Voters with higher education are more likely to vote for radical left parties\ncompared to mainstream parties, but less likely to vote for radical right parties com-\npared to mainstream parties.\nAn implication of the above analysis is that education should affect radicalisms in\nways that are conditional upon egalitarian and altruistic attitudes. The higher\neducated who vote for radical left parties are most likely individuals supporting\negalitarian and altruistic attitudes, as for it will be less in their own economic\ninterest to vote for parties that criticize capitalism and propose higher taxation.\nThey vote for the radical left because they think that society at large will profit\nfrom a successful radical left. Education socializes political values onto students,\nincluding values of equality and democracy (Stubager, 2008). And a `sociotropic'\norientation can require a modicum of reasoning and knowledge that education can\nfoster (Dee, 2004; Van de Werfhorst and De Graaf, 2004). Political knowledge may\nincrease the effects of egalitarian ideology on voting and position-taking on par-\nticular issues, including taxing and spending issues (Gomez and Wilson, 2001;\nRelatedly, education's tendency to foster cosmopolitanism might be stronger\namong the more ideologically egalitarian and altruistic (Hainmueller and Hiscox,\nwho vote for radical left parties are likely to be more egoistic; they vote for the\nradical left because they have fewer opportunities on the job market, as a result of\nwhich it is in their direct economic interest to vote for a party that proposes to\nprotect the socioeconomically most vulnerable.\nH6: The tendency of the higher educated to vote for radical left parties (relative to\nmainstream parties) increases when voters embrace egalitarian and/or altruist values,\nand this does not hold for the tendency to vote for radical right parties compared to\nmainstream parties.\nData and measurement\ntest our hypotheses (ESS, 2016). We focus on the voting patterns of respondents\nwith respect to 26 radical right and 23 radical left parties in 23 countries, summar-\nized in Table 1. We selected those individuals who voted for either one of the\nselected radical right or radical left parties, or for a mainstream party (i.e. a liberal,\nsocial democratic, conservative or Christian democratic party). The categorization\nof radical right parties is largely based on Mudde (2007) and that of radical left\nparties on March (2011).6 Some parties are doubtful cases. The Dutch LPF and the\nBritish UKIP, for instance, are relatively moderate, and some scholars doubt\nwhether these parties qualify as radical right (see Mudde, 2007). We did not include\nthe Alternative for Germany (AfD) in our analysis, because in 2014--the most\nrecent year in our data--this party was not (yet) radical right (see Arzheimer,\n2015). Other parties might be perceived as being too extreme to be in the radical\nright party family. An example is the German NPD. Similarly, KKE in Greece and\nKSS in Slovakia might be defined as something other than radical left parties\n(March, 2011). While existing literature and party studies support the present cat-\negorization, we experimented with other categorizations, taking account among\nother issues of the heterogeneity of radical left as opposed to radical right parties\n(March, 2011). As shall be discussed below, this does not lead to different substan-\ntive findings.\nThe dependent variables are based on the vote choice of respondents.\nRespondents were asked whether he or she voted during the last national general\nelection. If yes, he or she was asked which party s/he voted for. Based on this\nvote-choice variable we constructed various dichotomous dependent variables rep-\nresenting comparisons between categories of parties, based on the following three\ncategories: (1) mainstream; (2) radical right; and (3) radical left.7 Our baseline\nmodels include radical right versus mainstream and radical left versus mainstream.\nOur independent variables address the expectations articulated above. The first\nset is relevant to SES: Education, Class, Subjective income and Unemployed (See for\nmore information the Online Appendix). Another set of variables concerns nor-\nmative stances on political and economic dissatisfaction. We included a variable of\nEconomic dissatisfaction, which measures how satisfied respondents are with the\nstate of the economy in their country (0 \u00bc `extremely satisfied'; 10 \u00bc `extremely\ndissatisfied'). And we included a measure of Political distrust in our analysis.\nOn an 11-point scale respondents could indicate trust in the country's parliament\nand the country's politicians. We recoded these so that they range from `complete\ntrust' (0) to `no trust at all' (10), and combined them into a political trust scale\nA third set of variables gauges the normative-ideological stances of voters rele-\nvant to hypotheses 1\u00ad3. To measure Egalitarianism (for H1), we rely on a question\nasking respondents whether they believe the following description applies to them:\n`S/he thinks it is important that every person in the world should be treated\nequally. S/he believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life'.\nThe 6-point Likert-scale answers range from 1 (`not like me at all') to 6\n(`very much like me'). To measure Altruism, relevant to hypothesis 2, respondents\nanswered another 6-point Likert-scale question on whether respondents recognize\nTable 1.

Finally, to\nmeasure support for government intervention to support egalitarian goals, relevant\nto H3, we rely on Government redistribution, measuring whether respondents strongly\ndisagreed (1) or strongly agreed (5) with the proposition that `The government\nshould take measures to reduce differences in income levels'.\nA final set of independent variables concern anti-globalization sentiments.\nWe focus on the two domains consistently addressed across multiple ESS waves:\nEuropean Union integration and immigration. Our Anti-EU measure is based on\nthe question `European unification should go further or has gone too far',\nresponses ranging from 0 to 10 (0 \u00bc `European unification should go further'\nthrough to 10 \u00bc `European unification has already gone too far'). Anti-immigration\n(hypothesis 4) is a scale that measures perceived ethnic threat.9 The new variable\nwas recoded so that 0 means `immigrants are good rather than pose a threat' and\n10 is that `immigrants pose a large threat' (Cronbach's Alpha \u00bc 0.84).\nWe control for a respondent's priority for a strong state and law-and-order.\nWe rely on Strong state for safety, based on a 6-point Likert-scale asking whether\nrespondents judge themselves similar to someone for whom `it is important that\ngovernment is strong and ensures safety', with answers ranging from 1 (`not at all\nlike me') to 6 (`very much like me'). All models control for religiosity, age, gender,\nand rural/urban residence of the respondent. Religiosity is measured in subjective\ncategories ranging from `not at all religious' (0) to `very religious' (10). Age is in\nyears, though we dropped all respondents younger than 18 years old who are\nnot allowed to vote yet. A gender dummy classifies females as 1 and males as 0.\nThe rural/urban residence is urban (1) versus rural (0). Our baseline estimations\nare logistic regression models that include country- and year-fixed effects to\naccount for the fact that respondents are nested within both countries and years.\nThe reported coefficients are odds ratios, and standard errors are robust-clustered\nby country-year. The observations are also weighted using the population size\nweights and the design weights provided by the ESS. Observations with missing\nvalues were deleted listwise.\nFindings\nTable 2 displays the results of the baseline logistic regressions. Models 1 through\n4 consider the conditions relevant to the likelihood of voting for the radical right as\nopposed to mainstream parties (mainstream is coded as `0' and radical right as `1').\nModel 1 is a minimalist model of demographic controls plus education; Model 2\nadds the remaining SES variables (class, unemployment and income); Model 3\nadds Anti-immigration, and Model 4 Anti-European Union. Models 5\u00ad8 repeat\nthe same stepwise estimates for radical left party votes relative to mainstream\nparty votes (0 \u00bc mainstream; 1 \u00bc radical left). By necessity, the analyses on radical\nright and radical left voting cover the countries where these respective party\nTable 2. Logistic regression models estimating radical right and radical left support.\nMainstream (0) vs. Radical Right (1) Mainstream (0) vs. Radical Left (1)\n2 (man.superv.\nAnd skilled)\n4 (routine non-\nmanual)\nClustered standard errors; entries are odds ratios.\nfamilies are present. This means that these models are run on a (partially) different\nselection of countries. To be sure that this different coverage does not drive the\nresults, we also present models directly comparing radical right to radical left voters\nin the country-waves where these party families coexist. As will be discussed below,\nthese analyses lead to very similar substantive findings.\nThe results show that both radical left and right voters tend to be dispropor-\ntionately lower class. Although not all class categories differ significantly from the\nreference category of semi- and unskilled manual workers and agricultural\nlaborers, the lower and higher level professionals and managers and entrepreneurs\ndo differ in the expected direction from this category. When it comes to radical\nright voting, unemployment and income lose statistical significance with the add-\nition of attitudinal controls. Still, lower socioeconomic positions yield, to some\nextent, higher likelihood of voting for radical parties compared to mainstream\nparties--albeit with some heterogeneity in our models. The clear exception is, as\nexpected, education (H5), which tends to statistically significantly lower chances of\nvoting for radical right but increases the chance of voting radical left.\nAdditional evidence for hypothesis 5 is that the negative effect of education on\nsupport for radical right voting becomes less negative once one controls away the\ninfluence of (direct measures of) socioeconomic risks. Similarly, the positive effect\nof education on the chance of voting radical left becomes more positive once one\ncontrols for the same socioeconomic parameters, suggesting that what remains of\nthe education effect after removing economic risks has to do with the positive\nimpact on radical left support via education's fostering of cosmopolitanism.\nFinally, Table 2 considers the effect of Anti-European Union and Anti-\nImmigration attitudes on radical left and right voting. Respondents with stronger\nAnti-European Union attitudes tend to disproportionately support both the radical\nright and left parties (see model 4 and model 8).10 However, with respect to Anti-\nimmigration (H4), considering immigration to be a threat is much more likely to\nspur radical right voting, but much less likely to spur radical left voting. These\neffects are among the substantively (and statistically) strongest in the model, where\na one-unit increase in the 10-point scale of Anti-immigration is associated with a 57-\npercent increase in the odds of supporting radical right and 8-percent drop in the\nodds of supporting radical left parties. In line with our theory, the positive effect of\neducation on support for radical left and negative on support for radical right are\nboth dampened by inclusion of these putative intervening variables.\nTable 3 considers full models including all attitudinal variables relevant to the\nhypotheses above, though now excluding Anti-European Union so as to retain fuller\ncoverage. Models 1 and 2 repeat specifications for all the models in Table 2, but\nhere we also include the remaining attitudinal parameters. Model 1 focuses on the\nradical right, while model 2 focuses on the radical left. This allows a side-by-side\ncomparison of how the various SES and attitudinal factors, beyond anti-globaliza-\ntion attitudes, affect left and right radicalisms. Consistent with Table 2,\nwe see substantial overlap again in the SES conditions (except education) and\nthe striking difference in Anti-immigration. Interestingly, neither radical right nor\nTable 3.

The patterns broadly corroborate the above\nhypotheses. Consistent with hypothesis 1, radical left voters are more likely to\nsupport Egalitarianism while radical right voters are less likely to do so.\nConsistent with hypothesis 2, radical left voters are also more likely to express\nAltruism, while radical right voters are not. Consistent with hypothesis 3, finally,\nradical left voters are much more likely to Support Government Redistribution than\nare mainstream voters, whereas radical right voters are not.\nModel 3 in Table 3 considers an alternative specification of the baseline results.\nIt focuses on only radical voters, with the dependent variable being 1 for radical\nleft voter and 0 for radical right voter. This sets the patterns of the baseline\nmodels into sharper relief. For instance, the two sorts of radical voters are similar\nwith respect to class background or income, but significantly different with respect\nto unemployment: radical left voters are only half as likely as their radical right\ncounterparts to be unemployed (OR \u00bc .55). And of course, we see again the large\ndifference with respect to education. More striking, still, are the differences with\nrespect to the party legacies of the left and right, with patterns virtually identical to\nthe baseline (Models 1 and 2).\nThe results so far have shed light on all of our hypotheses, except for hypothesis\n6. The expectation of H6 is that highly educated supporters of the left express\naltruistic and egalitarianist attitudes, and that the effect of education on voting\nfor radical left parties will become more strongly positive among more egalitarian\nTable 3. Continued\nRadical\nRight\nRadical\nLeft\nRR (0) vs.\nClustered standard errors; entries are odds ratios.\nand altruistic voters. To test this hypothesis, we add to the specifications reported\nin Table 3's model 1 and 2 interaction terms between Egalitarianism (or Altruism)\nand Education. The results are summarized in Table 4. Model 1 in Table 4 shows\nthat the interaction effect is not significant when it comes to radical right voters.\nFor radical left voting, however, the interaction is significant (model 2).\nFigure 1 clarifies the marginal effects of the interactions. The first panel (a)\npresents the insignificant interaction between altruism and education for voting\nradical right rather than mainstream. The figure shows a consistent negative\neffect of education on radical right voting, irrespective of altruism levels.\nPanel (b) displays the inverse interpretation of the same interaction term, which\nreads that altruism has no significant effect on voting for the radical right compared\nto mainstream parties--no matter the level of education. Figure 1's third and\nfourth panels show the same marginal effects for radical left voting. Here, the\nthird panel (c) shows no significant effect of education for more egoistic individ-\nuals. However, for more altruistic voters education becomes positive and statis-\ntically significant. Importantly, the difference in the education effect between very\negoistic and very altruistic voters is also statistically significant. Panel (d) confirms\nthat the interaction is significant and shows that the effect of altruism on radical left\ncompared to mainstream voting is significant only among higher-educated voters.\nThese results provide substantial support for hypothesis 6: the higher educated vote\nradical left only when they are more altruistic. Importantly, the interaction plaus-\nibly captures conditional effects in the opposite direction: not only is the tendency\nTable 4.

Both have been thought to draw upon similar socioeconomic voter positions.\nExisting empirical studies of voter radicalisms have affirmed such patterns, while also\nunearthing some differences. The problem is that such differences are more induced\nthan explained, leaving them conceptualized as, at most, ad hoc exceptions that prove\na rule that the radical left and radical right share more than they contest.\nWe argue that although the radical left and right voter-bases have plenty in\ncommon, they strongly differ when it comes to their main voting motivations.\nWith respect to fundamental values on equality, altruism, and appropriateness of\ngovernment promotion of equality, radical left voters embrace and radical right\nvoters more readily eschew such values. As a plausible consequence of such diver-\ngences in fundamental values, radical left and right voters differ in their national-\nism: The radicalisms of both left and right share concerns about the European\nUnion, but they yield diametrically opposed attitudes about immigration--where\nthe radical left shows marked signs of cosmopolitanism and the radical right clear\nnativism. Finally, these patterns clarify why radical left voters tend to be more\neducated than their radical left counterparts (or, indeed, more than mainstream\nvoters): the radical left's commitment to cosmopolitanism, itself likely a product of\negalitarianism, develops in part through education.\nFuture studies should investigate the relationship between egalitarianism, educa-\ntion, and radical voting in more detail and by means of more sophisticated attitu-\ndinal measurements. Further, it is important to assess the role of macro-level\nvariables like socioeconomic inequality, economic growth and the percentage of\nforeign-born residents. Another possible venue for future research is development\nof radical voting over time, or differences between various regions within Europe.\nMeanwhile, our findings clarify the future of radicalisms and of coalition for-\nmation in an age of electoral turmoil in Europe. The findings imply that the rad-\nical left and radical right likely to draw on very different segments of the same pool\nof `losers of globalization'. Relatedly, the competing radicalisms can be expected\nto rally discontents to very different ends and party programs--to seek to\nwin hearts and minds in ways that should be familiar to what we know about\nleft-right divides in electoral democracy. Another important implication is that\nradical left and radical right parties, both doing better in the polls and national\nelections, may be less likely to find a common cause and form coalitions than is\noften discussed or feared. We know that such coalitions are possible--as in the\nwake of the 2015 Greek elections when Syriza formed a government with a small\nradical right party. Such an example, our arguments and evidence suggest, repre-\nsent a `bootlegger-baptist' coalition--always possible in political life, but no\nharbinger for enduring and broader political alliances. Examples of radical left and\nradical right cooperation are exceptions that prove, or at least predict, a rule--a\nrule of radical distinctions.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been made possible through the\nAmsterdam Centre for Inequality Studies (AMCIS) of the University of Amsterdam.\nSupplemental material\nSupplementary material is available for this article online.\nNotes\n2. Lower service workers, however, are not more likely to vote for the radical right,\nwhereas labor supervisors and self-employed people, for instance, are.\n3. Van der Brug and Van Spanje (2009) have found that party positions in Europe are\nmainly structured by a single left-right dimension.\n4. Note, however, that Bakker et al. (2016) found that voting for populist radical left\nparties could be more common among those scoring low on Agreeableness. Yet research\non the relationship between personality and radical voting is still in its infancy (see\n` -vis EU-attitudes).\n5. But note that mainstream parties strongly differ from each other when it comes to their\nattitudes and strategies regarding the EU (see Adam et al., 2017).\n6. See for similar categorizations also Akkerman et al. (2016), Gomez et al. (2016), Ramiro\n7. This vote-choice question is asked every two years, implying that the last national election\ncould be several years earlier, potentially yielding recall error. However, incorrectly recalled\nparties are often ideologically close to the original vote, and recall tends to be biased\ntowards current party preferences (Van Elsas et al., 2016). Given our interest in distin-\nguishing radical-right and left parties from mainstream parties, and our focus on voting\npatterns more generally, vote recall measures are most appropriate. In addition, voters may\nbe more likely to remember their vote choice if they have opted for a radical party.\n8. This question focuses on a narrow part of altruism, other-regarding behavior towards\nothers in one's own midst, not all others. But this does gauge subjective willingness to\nregard and help others, and is the only ESS question to do so.\n9. This scale is based on the following questions: (1) `Would you say it is generally bad or\ngood for [country]'s economy that people come to live here from other countries?'; (2)\n`Would you say that [country]'s cultural life is generally undermined or enriched by\npeople coming to live here from other countries?'; and (3) `Is [country] made a worse or a\nbetter place to live by people coming to live here from other countries?'\n10. The anti-EU variable has been added separately because including it leads to a strong\nreduction in the sample size.\nReferences\nAdam S, Antl-Wittenberg EM, Eugster B, et al.
