We tested sera collected in the National\nHealth and Examination Survey (NHANES) from\nbodies and compared these results with results from sera\ncollects data on a nationally representative sample of the\nprevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black persons\nthan among non-Hispanic white persons (age-adjusted\nage. No statistically significant differences were found\nbetween T. gondii antibody prevalence in NHANES\nlence has remained stable over the past 10 years in the\nUnited States.\nToxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite of\nwarm-blooded animals. However, only members of the\ncat family (Felidae) are definitive hosts for the organism,\nwhich is shed in their feces for several weeks after the\norganism has completed a sexual cycle in their intestinal\nepithelial cells. Infection in humans generally occurs either\nby ingesting viable tissue cysts in raw or undercooked\nmeat or by ingesting oocysts shed in the feces of a cat.\nAfter acute infection, T. gondii continues to exist in tissue\ncysts in humans, particularly in the muscles and brain.\nHowever, in people with immunodeficiencies such as\nAIDS or malignancies, rupture of cysts results in disease\nreactivation, including encephalitis or disseminated toxo-\nplasmosis. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to T. gondii\nappear early, reach a peak within 6 months after infection,\nand are detectable for life.\nWhen a pregnant woman is infected for the first time,\nand the infection spreads to the fetus, congenital T. gondii\ninfection may be clinically apparent in the neonate in the\nfirst months of life or later during infancy, childhood, or\nadolescence (i.e., cause neurologic or eye damage) or may\ncongenital toxoplasmosis occur each year in the United\nStates (1). In an analysis of data from a large HIV-infected\ncohort, toxoplasmosis was found to be the most frequent\nsevere neurologic infection among persons with AIDS in\nthe United States, even after the advent of highly active\nantiretroviral therapy (2).\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nestimates that one half of T. gondii infections in the United\nStates are caused by ingestion of raw or undercooked\ninfected meat (3). A community-based study in Maryland,\ncomparing persons who did not eat meat with those who\ndid eat meat, supports the USDA estimate (4). In 1999,\nMead and colleagues estimated that of the 750 deaths\ncaused by toxoplasmosis each year, one half were the\nresult of eating raw or undercooked meat, making toxo-\nplasmosis the third leading cause of foodborne deaths (5).\nTo present the prevalence of infection in the U.S. pop-\nulation, we report the Toxoplasma-specific IgG results of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) con-\nToxoplasma IgG antibody seropositivity during these years\nto the prevalence observed previously in NHANES III\nToxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies, indicating that they\nhad been infected with the organism (published prevalence\nwas age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. population; prevalence\nfor same population age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. popula-\nMethods\nNHANES Samples\nBeginning in 1999, NHANES became a continual sur-\nvey.

The continual NHANES is released in 2-year group-\nings (cycles). Two or more years of data are necessary to\nhave adequate sample sizes for subgroup analyses.

To compare\nanalyses are limited to the overlapping age groups (i.e.,\n12\u00ad49 years of age) and stratified on variables previously\nexamined in NHANES III (6). Age was grouped as 12\u00ad19,\nspecimens were also available from a limited number of\nsampled in this age range). Although the NHANES III data\nin this 6\u00ad11 year age group cannot be considered national-\nly representative because of the low response rate, we\npresent the previously calculated prevalence (6) for this\ngroup in our results because these are the only U.S. data\navailable for this age.\nRace/ethnicity was defined as self-reported non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American\nof Mexican Americans was conducted to ensure adequate\nrace/ethnicity variable used was the one most consistent\nwith the NHANES III race/ethnicity coding.

In previous NHANES surveys, the Taylor\nseries linearization method was used to estimate standard\nerrors. These standard errors account for the sample\nweights and complex sample design.
