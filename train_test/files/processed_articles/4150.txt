By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with\navailable online data sources, the system traces each\nvisitor back through the network to its possible\norigin. The end of that trace is an image that potentially\nshows the visitor's physical environment.\nTo obtain the image of a visitor's location Tracing\nYou asks for no special permissions; it simply references\nthe same information every user leaves with every web-\nsite they visit. One piece of that data is the visitor's\nInternet Protocol (IP) address. Formatted as a numer-\nidentifies the device used to view the site, whether it\npoints to one's phone, laptop, or tablet. Every IP\naddress is registered with the Internet Assigned\nNumbers Authority, and thus has data associated\nwith the IP addresses' registration.\nTracing You starts with this IP address and follows\nthe trail. First it looks up the IP address using ipinfo1 to\nobtain geolocation data. This query returns a latitude/\nfies a precise location on the earth. The latitude/longi-\ntude is sent to Google in order to query their Street\nView, Static Maps, and Javascript Maps data services.\nUsing these queries, Tracing You searches for the\nclosest available match it can find, whether it is a\nstreet image in front of the location, an interior image\ninside the location, or, if nothing else, a satellite image\nfrom above. Once found, this image is combined with\ntext information from ipinfo and shown on the Tracing\nYou interface (Figure 2). The interface shows this image\nas one ``tile'' of six--the other tiles representing the five\nmost recent visitors aside from the current user. As new\nusers visit the site, tiles are updated to show the new\nlocations. Others already watching the site see tiles\nupdate as new visitors arrive.\nHow visible? The (in)accuracy of tracing\nlocation via IP address\nThe accuracy of the location shown in relation to a\nvisitor's current location can vary widely. Sometimes\nthis image is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly\ndislocated. For example, Tracing You might show a\nphotograph taken inside the building the visitor sits\nwithin. Alternatively, the image shown may be a\nstreet photograph from down the block, a few blocks\nover, or, in some cases, much further away. When street\nview images aren't available, the system resorts to sat-\nellite imagery, showing a several block radius around\nthe suspected location.\nHow close the system gets to a visitor's actual loca-\ntion depends on how networks are built, configured,\noperated, and distributed, which network the visitor's\ndevice uses, and the accuracy of the data associated\nwith those networks. Further, the ``trace'' may be com-\nplicated by a visitor's use of network obfuscation tech-\nniques such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or\nTor, both of which hide the user's real location by\nencrypting their data and routing their traffic through\nproxy networks. Big Data sources such as Google\nMaps are regularly updated with new information; in\nthis way, Big Data's ``picture'' of the world is continu-\nally refined. As that picture becomes more resolved,\nTracing You will become more accurate. As new data\nsources are made available, the author intends to inte-\ngrate them into the artwork.\nFigure 1. Tracing You installed at the PLUNC Festival in Lisbon, Portugal, 2016.\n2 Big Data & Society\n\"Creepy,'' ``Cool,'' and ``BIG FAT FAIL\":\nReactions to Tracing You reveal\nattitudes towards surveillance\nAs an artwork, Tracing You has been written about in a\nvariety of publications such as Le Monde, The Creator's\nProject, and Kill Screen, has been exhibited internation-\nally at shows and festivals in Paris, Lisbon, Chicago,\nNew York, and London, and has been shared widely on\nsocial media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The\nresulting public discussion of Tracing You has included\nobservations of the work through comments, tweets,\nand posts. Examining these reactions can reveal current\nattitudes towards surveillance.2\nSome reactions to Tracing You are easy to predict.\nFor example, many of those who wrote about the\nproject expressed concern for what it can do. An\nemblematic example of this is a Tweet from user\n@paulcarvill: ``this websites [sic] traces you and\nshows the closest available image of your current phys-\nical environment. . . BRRRR CREEPY'' (Carvill, 2016)\n(Figure 3). In other words, one primary reaction to the\nartwork's ability to track and display visitor locations\nhas been fear. This was expected by the author/artist.\nOther reactions were less expected. For example, a\nnumber of visitors expressed happiness about Tracing\nYou, often manifest as an appreciation of the work's\ntechnical ability to accurately find their location.\nTwitter user @jbj called the work ``pretty cool'' and\nincluded his own annotated screenshot showing how\nTracing You had correctly found his location (Jones,\nThe least expected reactions were expressions of\nanger. However, these were not expressions of anger\nover the artwork's surveillance or intention of locating\nits visitors, but instead were expressions of anger over\nTracing You's inability to be more accurate than it\nalready is (Figure 5).\nFacebook user Debbie Beele's comment about\nTracing You, when translated to English by\nFacebook, includes the following: ``For me, so a big\nfat fail for this art project. It does not do what it prom-\nises'' (Beele, 2016). In other words, Beele feels let down\nby what she sees as a disparity between the project's\npromise to try and locate her and the results she sees.\nFigure 2. Tracing You (screenshot).

Twitter user @paulcarvill calling Tracing You\nThis kind of angry response about the work's varying\n(in)accuracy was expressed by a number of users across\nmany sites.\nVeillance, transparency, and the\ndesire for visibility\nThese visitor reactions to Tracing You provide clues to\nunderstanding user attitudes of surveillance post-\nSnowden. Those whose location is most accurately\ndetected express concern over how easily their current\nlocation can be visualized. One's positionality, based on\nrace or gender for example, likely plays a role here, as\nthe risks of being visible are higher for some. But\nothers, especially those like Beele whose particular net-\nwork configuration rendered her location less visible,\nhave expressed anger over the perceived invisibility.\nWhy might someone be angry about this, in effect\nexpressing a desire for more accurate surveillance of\nthemselves?\ninsistence on radical transparency.3 Social media in\nparticular has conditioned many to not only accept\nThis is because being as visible as possible on sites\nlike Facebook and Twitter is the key that permits\nentry into and full participation within those site's sys-\ntems of interaction and connection. Users can lurk or\nhide if they choose, but doing so severely limits user\nexperience. When this desire for visibility intersects\nwith ubiquitous transparent veillance, it contributes\nnot only to an acceptance of being seen, but also\nhelps to produce the negative emotions expressed by\nusers less visible to surveillance systems. Being less\nFigure 4. Twitter user @jbj calling Tracing You ``cool--and correct.\"\n4 Big Data & Society\nvisible within social networks means having less power;\none's power (to influence opinion, to increase friend\nnetworks, etc.) is dependent on one's visibility.4\nAs a result, many visitors to Tracing You have\nalready been conditioned by social networks to\nequate visibility with power. Thus, by mirroring the\nveillant structures of sites like Facebook, Tracing You\nalso produces--at least for some of its visitors--a simi-\nlar desire for visibility. This happens despite the overt\npotentially negative surveillance implications proposed\nby Tracing You's ability to reveal one's physical\nlocation.\nFigure 5. Facebook user Debbie Beele calling Tracing You a ``BIG FAT FAIL.\"\nSummary\nTracing You investigates issues of veillance, transpar-\nency, and Big Data from a practice-based artistic\nresearch perspective. By showing website visitors what\ncan be gleaned of their current physical environment\nbased on nothing more than visiting a website, the art-\nwork provokes its visitors to consider how networks are\nbuilt, configured, operated, and distributed, and how\nthose aspects affect their own visibility to the system.\nAt the same time, the work puts the viewer into a sous-\nveillant position (Mann, 2013: 3), as they are simultan-\neously viewing not only their own ``traces'' but also\nthose of others around the world. In an age when vari-\nous networks we engage with daily make us more or\nless visible to others, Tracing You models these systems\nin a way that lets users consider their personal relation-\nship to the network. How susceptible are we to surveil-\nlance networks? How much surveillance do we accept,\nor even desire in this age of radical transparency? By\nhelping visitors answer these questions, Tracing You\nreveals the emotional landscape that network visibility\ncultivates. As Big Data improves its understandings of\nthe world, Tracing You will further test how veillance\nand transparency affects our willingness and desire to\nbe seen by others.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
