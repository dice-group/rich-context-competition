This behavior preserves the gene in other\nindividuals when aid is extended to kin members \u00ad the individuals who are most likely to\ncarry a copy of the same altruism gene. This is represented by Hamilton's rule (c < br),\nwhich indicates that an altruist will perform an altruistic act when the biological cost (c) is\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nless than the product of the reproductive benefits (b) and the genetic relatedness (r) shared\nbetween the altruist and recipient. From Hamilton's rule, researchers have found that\npeople are more likely to risk their lives to aid close kin over both distant kin and non-kin\nin life-threatening scenarios (Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994; Fitzgerald and\nlikely to aid healthy kin over those with a disorder that inhibits reproduction of the altruism\ngene (Burnstein et al., 1994; Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985; Fitzgerald and Colarelli,\nHowever, it seems like most, if not all, altruism research has used two specific\nexamples when studying life-threatening altruism. These two examples are 1) the burning\nhouse \u00ad in which a participant is told to imagine that one or more kin members are trapped\nin a burning house and they need the participant to rescue them (Burnstein et al., 1994;\nwhere a participant is told to imagine a kin member needs the participant to donate a kidney\nin order for that kin member to survive (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007; Stewart-\nWilliams, 2007, 2008). Both of these examples adequately portray the deadly risk involved\nin this type of altruism, but they may not be the most fitting examples of life-threatening\nsituations. For instance, other altruism research has found that other animals (including\nnon-human primates) take part in life-threatening altruistic acts to help their kin as well\n(Kaplan, 2005; Moehlman, 1979), which indicates that altruistic behavior may stem from a\ndistant common ancestry and has therefore been surviving since before the development of\norgan donation and houses.\nAlthough organ donation is a very new concept in human history and therefore is\nvery unlikely to be an accurate representation of life-threatening altruism in hunter-gatherer\nsocieties, humans have been controlling fire and living in house-like residences for\nthousands of years. Therefore, it is possible that burning houses may have been occurring\nlong enough in human history to shape altruistic behavior \u00ad allowing for generations of\nexperience with life-threatening situations in which a kin member must be saved from a\nburning residence. However, life-threatening altruism in non-human primates and other\nanimals indicate that fighting off predators and attackers should be examined to obtain\npotentially more accurate representations of life-threatening altruism.\nThus, although the burning house and kidney donation examples adequately display\nthe life-or-death risk of the specific altruistic act involved, the acts themselves (especially\nthe kidney donation example) may not be sufficiently exhibiting the risk associated with\nlife-threatening altruism that would have occurred in early hominid environments (e.g.,\nAustralopithecus) or in non-human primate societies (e.g., chimpanzees), such as fighting\noff attackers and/or predators (Chagnon, 1988; Kaplan, 2005). Therefore, the current study\nfocused on violent types of life-threatening altruism in which a person's kin member is\nbeing attacked by an aggressor, and the responses to these altruistic acts will be compared\nto the standard non-violent altruism scenarios (i.e., burning house and kidney donation\nexamples).\nSex Differences (or lack thereof) and Altruism\nStudies on non-violent altruism have found there to be no sex differences when it\ncomes to performing these life-threatening acts (Burnstein et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nequally likely to sacrifice their own lives to save a close kin member (Mills, Pedersen, and\nGrusec, 1989). However, due to the non-violent nature of the altruistic acts that are\ngenerally used, this finding may be incomplete.\nEvolutionary theory and research have argued that males are more physically\naggressive than females (Buss and Duntley, 2006; Daly and Wilson, 1988). This physical\naggression in males may have evolved (among other reasons) from intrasexual competition\n(Buss and Duntley, 2006). Males compete with each other for the most attractive and/or\ndesired mates (Buss, 1988; Darwin, 1871), so this competition has led to aggression. In\nfact, males are responsible for 99% of all same-sex murders worldwide (Daly and Wilson,\n1988) \u00ad supporting the theory that physical aggression in males stems from intrasexual\nconflict. Conversely, females often resort to verbal aggression during instances of\nintrasexual competition (Buss and Dedden, 1990); therefore physical aggression has not\ndeveloped in females to the extent that it has developed in males.\nThere is a plethora of data that support the theory of intrasexual competition and\nmale aggression, but it is also possible that this intrasexual conflict has grown to inter-\ngroup conflict over the years. This would have led male aggression to develop as a means\nof protecting oneself, one's kin members, social status, reproductive status, and resources\nfrom attackers (Buss and Duntley, 2006). Intergroup conflict has led to warfare, pillaging,\nabduction and subsequent rape of females between opposing groups (Chagnon, 1988;\nWrangham, 1999). If defensive physical aggression would not have developed, groups\nwould have suffered severe injury, death, and loss of females \u00ad all of which would decrease\nand/or inhibit reproduction. Thus, it is possible that males may be more physically\naggressive than females when it comes to defending themselves and/or kin members. If\nmales and females are forced into a situation in which they have to perform a violent act to\nsave a kin member (e.g., physically fighting off an armed attacker), the results may show a\nsex difference \u00ad something that has not been found in any previous altruism research.\nMale altruists may be more likely to physically assault an attacker to save a kin\nmember than female altruists. Of course, one possible exception to this theory centers on\nthe mother-child kin relation. Because mothers invest a great deal of time and resources\nduring gestation, and have complete maternal certainty, they are much more likely than\nfathers to tend to the needs of their offspring, which includes protecting them from\npredators, sharing precious resources (e.g., food, water, and shelter), and general interest in\nthe offspring during development (Babchuck, Hames, and Thompson, 1985; Taylor et al.,\n2000). Also, multitudes of studies have found that paternity uncertainty decreases the\nlikelihood of altruism and investment in many types of family members, including parents,\ncousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents (Bishop, Meyer, Schmidt, and Gray, 2009;\nWeitzel, 1996; Jeon and Buss, 2007); so it would not be surprising to find that females\nwould be more likely than males to be violently altruistic to save their offspring. However,\nthe current study examined the influence that violence may have on altruism toward\nsiblings, cousins, and friends \u00ad siblings and friends are unaffected by the paternity\nuncertainty principle, and previous research on altruism toward cousins did not find any sex\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Design\nfrom Central Michigan University \u00ad a Midwestern-American university with an on-campus\nstudent population of about 20,000. The average age of the sample was 20.7 years (SD =\n4.3). Participants were given extra credit in one of their psychology courses for their\nparticipation.\nThe study design consisted of a 3 (genetic relatedness between participant and\nrecipient) x 2 (types of altruism: violent vs. non-violent) x 2 (sex of target) x 2 (sex of\nparticipant) mixed design. Genetic relatedness, sex of the participant, and sex of the target\nwere between-subject variables whereas type of altruism was a within-subject variable. The\ndependent variable was the estimated likelihood of performing the altruistic act.\nStimulus Materials and Measures\nA questionnaire containing four fictional scenarios in randomized order was used.\nEach questionnaire pertained to one specific target person that was related to the participant\nin some way. The target was described as being either the participant's sibling (r = .50),\ncousin (r = .125), or best friend (r = 0). Each scenario depicted a situation in which the\ntarget person was in serious peril and would die if the participant did not act to save them.\nTwo different examples were used for each type of altruism (creating a total of four\naltruism scenarios). Non-violent altruism consisted of the burning house example and the\nkidney donation example. Both examples yielded a reasonable level of internal consistency\n( = .70) and were therefore aggregated to create the non-violent altruism variable. Violent\naltruism consisted of an example depicting the target person being mugged and another\nexample depicting the target person being chased by an attacker. Both examples yielded a\nhigh level of internal consistency ( = .85) and were therefore aggregated to form the\nviolent altruism variable. Within each scenario was a statement indicating to the\nparticipants that there is a great chance of dying if they choose to help the person in peril.\nAfter each scenario, there was a question asking \"What is the likelihood of you helping this\nperson?\" Responses were recorded by circling a number on a 5-point Likert-type scale in\nwhich 1 = \"definitely not helping,\" 2 = \"probably not helping,\" 3 = \"maybe helping,\" 4 =\n\"probably helping,\" and 5 = \"definitely helping.\"\nProcedure\nParticipants were given two copies of a consent form. They read and signed both\nconsent forms, returned one to the experimenter, and kept the second for their own records.\nAfter the consent form, they were given a condition assignment form that consisted of six\nquestions. Each question asked the participants if they had one of the following six kin\nmembers/friends \u00ad brother, sister, male cousin, female cousin, male best friend, female best\nfriend. The participants were randomly assigned to a single condition based on the kin\nmembers/friends they indicated they had. For example, if a participant indicated they had a\nbrother, sister, and a male best friend, then he/she was randomly assigned to only one of\nthose conditions \u00ad either the brother, sister, or male best friend group. Each participant was\nonly allowed to participate in one condition.\nAfter being assigned to a condition, the participants were given the paper and pencil\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\naltruism questionnaire and asked to think of the specific person to which they were\nassigned (e.g., their brother, sister, etc.). They were then asked to read the questionnaire\nand circle a number on the 5-point Likert-type scale below each of the four scenarios. After\neveryone had finished, the researcher collected the questionnaires and dismissed the\nparticipants.\nResults\nA 3 (genetic relatedness) x 2 (type of altruism) x 2 (sex of target) x 2 (sex of\nparticipant) mixed-design ANOVA was performed on the participants' altruism ratings.\nThe results revealed a significant main effect of genetic relatedness, F(2, 204) = 22.03, p <\n.001, p\u00b2 = .18. A Tukey post-hoc analysis found that people considering their siblings had\na higher estimated likelihood of helping than people considering cousins and friends, but\nthere was no significant difference in altruism ratings between people considering their\ncousins and people considering their friends. Genetic relatedness did not interact with any\nvariables. See Figure 1 for the mean altruism ratings based on genetic relatedness.\nFigure 1. Mean likelihood of performing a life-threatening altruistic act as a function of\naltruism type and genetic relatedness.\nNon-violent Violent\nType of Altruism\nMean Altruism Ratings\nBest Friend\nCousin\nSibling\nA significant main effect for type of altruism was also found, F(1, 204) = 16.17, p <\n.001, p\u00b2 = .07, indicating people had a higher estimated likelihood of helping those in\nviolent altruistic situations than non-violent ones. However, this main effect was qualified\np\u00b2 = .06. Follow-up analysis found that people were just as willing to help male and\nfemale targets in non-violent situations (p = .51), but they were more willing to help female\ntarget did not elicit a main effect nor did it interact with any other variables. See Figure 2\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nfor mean altruism ratings based on sex of target and type of altruism.\nFigure 2.

See Figure 3 for mean altruism ratings based on sex of\nparticipant and type of altruism.\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nFigure 3. Mean likelihood of performing a life-threatening altruistic act as a function of\naltruism type and sex of the participant.\nNon-violent Violent\nType of Altruism\nMean Altruism Rating s\nMale Participants\nFemale Participants\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to examine any possible differences between the non-\nviolent (i.e., the burning house and kidney donation examples) and violent (i.e., fighting off\nan attacker) examples of life-threatening altruism among kin and non-kin. The estimated\nlikelihood to help siblings more than cousins and friends in these life-threatening scenarios\nsupports multitudes of previous altruism studies (Burnstein et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and\ndifference in the degree of genetic relation between distant kin and non-kin (in this case,\ncousins and friends) appear smaller than the difference in genetic relation between close\nkin and distant kin and/or non-kin (Burnstein et al., 1994; Neyer and Lang, 2003), it was\nnot surprising to find that participants' estimated likelihood to help cousins and best friends\nwere similar in these life-threatening situations \u00ad especially since emotional closeness\nbetween altruists and their friends have been shown to increase the likelihood of altruism\nAlthough the violent altruism examples yielded higher altruism ratings than the\nnon-violent examples, the results show that people react pretty similarly when presented\nwith both types of situations. For instance, the lack of interaction between genetic\nrelatedness and type of altruism showed that people are just as willing to help a specific\nperson in a non-violent life-threatening situation and in a violent life-threatening situation.\nIn other words, a person is equally likely to give his or her sibling a kidney and save that\nsibling from an attacker. As is consistent with Hamilton's rule (c < br), the biological costs\nof the non-violent and violent altruistic acts are quite similar (at least they were in the\ndescriptions that were given to the participants in this study), so it is not surprising to see\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\nthat people are just as likely to help a sibling in non-violent and violent situations.\nThe increased estimated likelihood to help females in violent situations supported\nprevious evolutionary theory (Chagnon, 1988). This result may reflect an evolved\nmechanism that developed as a means of protecting the females of a tribe during times of\nwar and pillage between groups, when women would be taken by out-group members\n(Chagnon, 1988). This would explain why people were just as likely to help men and\nwomen in the non-violent situations \u00ad male and female kin are equally likely to possess the\naltruism gene (provided their genetic relation to the altruist is the same), but female kin\nwere more likely to be kidnapped by invading tribes and male kin stood a stronger chance\nof fighting off these invaders.\nThe increased altruism ratings from male participants in violent situations also\nsupported previous evolutionary theory and research on sex differences and aggression\n(Buss and Duntley, 2005; Daly and Wilson, 1988). These results do not support any claim\nthat men are `better altruists' than women; it merely reflects the violent tendencies that\nseem to be more prevalent in men than women.\nHowever, the significantly higher altruism ratings from female participants in non-\nviolent situations were interesting because they do not support any previous altruism\nresearch. Usually, a sex difference is not found when the non-violent altruism examples are\nWilliams, 2007, 2008). It may be that female participants in the present study were aware\nof their decreased willingness to help kin and friends in violent situations and therefore\ncompensated by circling greater altruism ratings for the non-violent situations. This seems\nunlikely, but it could be possible since all participants were presented with all altruism\nexamples. Therefore this may represent a limitation of this study and perhaps future\nresearch could use altruism type as a between-subject variable to examine if this is the\nreason for the significant effect.\nConclusion\nAlthough Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory has been supported time and\ntime again, the present study helped to shed light on this theory as well as the studies that\nhave supported it. Although previous studies have generally found no sex differences in\naltruism, the current study shows that there are certain facets of altruism that have not yet\nbeen studied \u00ad such as violent altruistic situations \u00ad which have left an incomplete picture\nof inclusive fitness theory. In addition, the present study used altruistic examples that may\nbe more evolutionarily significant (e.g., fighting off an attacker) than the traditional\nexamples that have been used, but still found a similar relationship between the examples\nand the likelihood of altruism, which indicated that the traditional examples, although they\nmay not reflect one's evolutionary past, are valid examples to use in altruism research.\nHowever, the violent altruism situations used in this study are just a couple examples of\nhow different details in the altruistic situations used in altruism research can influence\nparticipants' responses. Future research may be necessary to examine other possible types\nof altruistic examples that incorporate other events from our hunter-gatherer past, such as\nevading predators or hunting for survival in the wilderness.\nViolent versus non-violent altruism\n"
