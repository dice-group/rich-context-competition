Angiotensin II (AII) has an important role in the renal lesion provoked by 5/6 nephrectomy (NE). This\nstudy evaluated the CP extract effect on renal lesions provoked by 5/6 NE.\nMaterials and methods: Male Wistar rats submitted to 5/6 NE were treated or not treated with CP extract and\nfollowed for 90 days. Systemic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria, renal functional and structural parameters, ACE activity,\nurinary levels of monocyte chemoattrant protein-1 (MCP-1) and transforming growth factor  (TGF-) were evaluated.\nResults: Albuminuria and hypertension were less intense in the treated (NE+CP) group compared to the untreated\n(NE) group. CP extract treatment reduced the fall in glomerular filtration rate observed in NE rats. Glomerulosclerosis,\ntubulointerstitial lesions, increase of macrophages and AII positive cells in the renal cortex, as well as increases in renal\nACE activity, urinary levels of MCP-1 and TGF- were attenuated in NE rats by CP treatment.\nConclusions: The treatment with CP extract reduced the SBP and functional and structural renal changes in 5/6 NE\nrats.

AII can also activate nuclear\nfactor-B (NF-B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases\nBrazilian embauba (Cecropia pachystachya)\nextract reduces renal lesions in 5/6\nnephrectomized rats\nClaudia do C Maquiaveli1, Edson R da Silva2, Helo\u00edsa DC\nFrancescato1, Roberto S Costa3, Cleonice GA Silva1, Dulce E\nCasarini4, Fernanda A Ronchi4 and Terezila M Coimbra1\n Keywords\nCecropia pachystachya, renal failure, angiotensin II, inflammation\n1Department of Physiology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n2Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n3Department of Pathology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n4Department of Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nCorresponding author:\nTerezila M Coimbra, Department of Physiology, School of Medicine of\nPaulo, Brazil.\nEmail: tmcoimbr@fmrp.usp.br\nOriginal Article\n(MAPK).11,12 The MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)\nand NF-B have been implicated in apoptosis, inflamma-\ntion and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. The\nrenoprotection by antagonists of AII has been extensively\ndemonstrated in models of nephropathies and in prospec-\ntive controlled trials in patients with kidney disease.13\u00ad15\nCecropia pachystachya (CP) is a plant that grows in the\nrainforests of South America and is popularly known in\nBrazil as embauba. The plants that belong to the genus of\nCecropia are traditionally used in several Latin American\ncountries to treat hypertension, and pulmonary and cardiac\ndisease.16 CP extract is a rich source of polyphenols,\nmainly flavonoids, that have antioxidant and anti-inflam-\nmatory activities. 17\u00ad19 The antihypertensive and cardio-\nvascular protective effects of flavonoids and procyanidins\npresent in food were associated with angiotensin convert-\ning enzyme (ACE) inhibition.20,21 Polyphenols isolated\nfrom CP leaf extract such as orientin, isoorientin, isovi-\ntexin, isoquercitrin and procyanidins, can provoke ACE\ninhibition in vitro.22 However, studies of the effect of CP\nextract on the progression of kidney disease have not been\nperformed yet. Therefore, the aim of our study was to eval-\nuate the effect of CP extract on renal injury provoked by\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and experimental protocols\nthis study. The animals were maintained in a total of four\nanimals per cage at a temperature of 22\u00b0C with a light-dark\ncycle of 12 h and fed with standard diet ad libitum. The\nexperiments were performed in accordance with the ethi-\ncal principles for animal experimentation adopted by the\nBrazilian College of Animal Experimentation, and the\nAnimal Experimentation Committee of the University of\nS\u00e3o Paulo at Ribeir\u00e3o Preto School of Medicine approved\nthe study protocol (COBEA/CETEA/FMRP-USP, proto-\naccording to the technique described previously.23 The ani-\nmals were anesthetized with 2.5% tribromoethanol solu-\ntion in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) (0.15 mol/l\nNaCl and 0.01 mol/l phosphate buffer, pH=7.4) adminis-\ntered intraperitoneally (1 ml/100 g). The right kidney was\nremoved, and an infarction was provoked in two-thirds of\nthe left kidney by ligation of one or two branches of the\nleft renal artery. In the control group, a sham (S) operation\nwith manipulation of the renal pedicles without causing\nischemia or destruction of renal tissue was performed via\nlaparotomy. The animals were divided into four groups,\nwhich received the following treatments beginning 15\ndays after surgery: sham group (S) (n=10): untreated ani-\nmals that underwent the sham surgery; sham+CP (S+CP)\n(n=9): animals that underwent the sham surgery and were\ntreated with CP extract; nephrectomized (NE) (n=11): 5/6\nNE animals that were untreated; and nephrectomized+CP\n(NE+CP) (n=14): 5/6 NE animals that were treated with\nCP extract. After the surgical procedure, all groups were\nfollowed for a period of 90 days. Body weight (BW) and\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP), measured by the tail-cuff\nmethod (CODA System, Kent Scientific, Torrington,\nConnecticut, USA) were evaluated each month from 15\u00ad\n90 days after surgery. The animals were placed in meta-\nbolic cages for 24 h, and urine samples were collected to\nquantify albumin excretion (AE).\nPreparation, standardization and administration\nof CP extract\nBotanical identification was performed by Gerson O\nRom\u00e3o of the Herbarium of the Escola Superior de\nAgricultura Luiz de Queiroz of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\nwas deposited. Leaves were washed and then dried in the\nshade for 10 days. The leaves were completely dehydrated\nat 40\u00b0C for three days. The dried CP leaves were ground in\na mill (type Wyllie, Tecnal, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil)\nto obtain the powder that was used to prepare the CP\nextract. The CP extract was prepared at a proportion of 2%\nw/v (weight of vegetable/ volume of distilled water) for 30\nmin at 72\u00b0C. The CP extract was then decanted for 10 min,\nvacuum filtered, frozen and lyophilized to determine the\nconcentration. The process was repeated throughout the 75\ndays of the experiment. The CP extract was administered\nin amber glass drinkers given daily to the animals. Six\nsamples in triplicate were lyophilized weekly before and\nduring the experiment to verify the concentration of CP\nextract. Based on an evaluation of water consumption of\nthe animals over a 24 h period, the CP extract was diluted\nfor administration of a dose of 0.6 g/kg. The consumed\nvolume (ml) of the extract per box was determined and the\nmean dose was evaluated during the treatment.\nDetermination of the main compounds of the\nCP extract\nThe determination of the constituents from CP was per-\nformed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectra in\nMicroTOF Ic equipament (Bruker Daltonics). Separation\nwas done using RP-amide (Ascentis-Supelco, Sigma-\nAldrich) column (25 cm x 4.6 mm; 5 \u00b5M). The samples at\n5 mg/ml were prepared in 0.1% formic acid and 10 \u00b5[ was\ninjected into the column with a flow of 1 ml/min. The con-\nstituents were eluted by linear gradient from 10 to 35%\nacetonitrile-water containing 0.1% formic acid in 30 min.\nThe chromatography was monitored by diode array detec-\ntion (DAD) at 280 nm and mass spectra. The constituents\n432 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nwere characterized by the retention time (RT), mass spec-\ntrum and ultraviolet-visible spectrum.\nRenal function studies\nThe albumin in urine samples was quantified by electroim-\nmunoassay24 and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was\nevaluated 90 days after surgery by inulin clearance. The\nrats were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (40 mg/kg,\nintraperitoneally). After tracheostomy, the femoral artery\nand vein were cannulated to collect blood samples and to\ninject fluids, respectively. The ureters were cannulated to\ncollect urine. Urine samples were collected before the\nadministration of inulin solution to analyze TGF- and\nMCP-1. After this urine sample collection the rats received\na priming inulin dose (12 mg/100 g diluted in PBS solu-\ntion), followed by a maintenance inulin dose of 0.5 mg/\nmin/100 g. After 60 min stabilization, urine was collected\nfor 1 h, and the blood was sampled at 30 and 60 min. The\nkidneys were perfused through the aorta with PBS solution\nand removed for histological and immunohistochemical\nstudies. The animals were killed via anesthesia overdose.\nInulin was quantified in the plasma and urine samples by\nthe method of F\u00fchr et al.25 Sodium and potassium were\nmeasured in the plasma and urine by flame photometry\n(Micronal, model 262, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), and urine osmo-\nlality was assessed by freezing point depression using an\nOsmometer (Fiske OS, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA).\nQuantification of TGF- and MCP-1 in urine\nThe urine samples collected by the ureter were immedi-\nately treated with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonil fluoride\n(PMSF, Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, Missouri, USA)\nand stored at -70\u00baC until analysis. The TGF- and MCP-1\nquantification was performed by ELISA using commercial\nkits (Promega Corporation, Madison, Missouri, USA and\nPierce, Rockford, USA, respectively). The median values\nof TGF- and MCP-1 in the urine samples are expressed in\npg of TGF- or MCP-1 per mg creatinine.\nEnzymatic activity assay\nACE catalytic activity was determined fluorimetrically as\ndescribed by Friedland and Silverstein.26 The renal cortex\ntissue was homogenized in borohydrate buffer 100 mM,\nPMSF 10 mM (1 g tissue: 10 ml buffer). The homogenates\nsupernatant was frozen at -70oC until analyzed. An aliquot\nof plasma or kidney homogenate (10 \u00b5l) was incubated\nwith 200 \u00b5l assay solution (ZPhe-HisLeu 1 mM, sodium\ntion was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of NaOH 280\nmM. The liberated dipeptide, HL (His-Leu), was measured\nusing a Tecan Infinit F200 equipment as follows.27 One\nhundred of o-phthaldialdehyde (20 mg/ml) diluted in\nmethanol was added and after 10 min the solution was\nfor 10 min at room temperate. The standard curve was\nobtained using varying concentrations of L-HL and it\nshowed a linear relation between relative fluorescence and\nHL concentration. All the assays were performed in dupli-\ncate. The values median of the ACE activity in the renal\ncortex or plasma are expressed in nmol/mg of protein or\nmU/ml of HL produced, respectively.\nLight microscopy\nHistological sections (3 \u00b5M) were stained with Masson's\ntrichrome for examination under a light microscope. The\nincidence of glomerulosclerosis was determined by scoring\n50 glomeruli within a section of each kidney. The glomeru-\nlar sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesion incidence were\nevaluated by scores that reflected changes in the extent of\n>75%), and mean values per kidney were calculated. The\nfractional interstitial area in the renal cortex was determined\nby morphometry with a light camera connected to analyzer.\nTwenty grid fields (measuring 0.200 mm2) were evaluated\nin the renal cortex of each kidney. Interstitial areas were first\nmanually encircled on a video screen and then determined\nby computerized morphometry (Axion version 4.8.3, Zeiss)\nand the mean values per kidney were calculated.\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nThe sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 1/30\nanti p-JNK monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, USA), 1/200 anti-\nAII polyclonal antibody (Peninsula Laboratories, San\nantibody that only reacts with cytoplasmic antigen present\nin macrophages and monocytes (Serotec, Oxford, UK),\nantibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The reaction prod-\nuct was detected with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase com-\nplex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA).\nNegative controls were created by replacing the primary\nantibody with normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or\nrabbit IgG for monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies,\nrespectively, at equivalent concentrations. The color reac-\ntion was developed with immunoglobulin G (IgG, Sigma\nChemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).\nThe sections were counterstained with methyl green or\nwith Harris hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. To eval-\nuate the immunoperoxidase staining for p-JNK, vimentin,\nand the cortical glomeruli and tubulointerstitial region were\nsemi-quantitatively graded through examination of 50 glo-\nmean score per kidney was calculated.28 Vimentin was used\nas a marker of tubular cell lesions and was assessed only in\nthe tubulointerstitial area.29 Desmin was used as a marker of\npodocyte lesions and was only evaluated at the glomerular\nedge.29 The scores mainly reflected changes in the extent,\nrather than the intensity, of staining and depended on the\npercentage of glomeruli or grid field showing positive stain-\nThe number of ED1 (macrophages/monocytes)-posi-\ntive cells (glomeruli and renal cortical tubulointerstitium)\nand of AII (cortical tubulointerstitium) were counted\nthrough the examination of 50 glomeruli and 30 grid fields\n(measuring 0.200 mm2), respectively, and the mean counts\nper kidney were calculated.\nStatistical analysis\nOne way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Newman-\nKeuls comparison test was used for the data that were nor-\nmally distributed (SBP, BW and AII) or that showed a\nnormal distribution after log10\ntransformation (AE, ED1+\nand TGF-). Those data are expressed as mean and stand-\nard error of the mean (SEM) or geometric means and con-\nfidence intervals, respectively. For data related to other\nstudied parameters, we used nonparametric Kruskall-\nWallis test with Dunn's post-test. Those data are expressed\nas median and interquartile. The Mann-Whitney test was\nperformed for analysis of the fractional interstitial area and\nmean consumed dose. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows, GraphPad\nSoftware, San Diego, California, USA. The level of statis-\ntical significance was set at p<0.05.\nResults\nDetermination and control of the CP extract\ndose\nCP extract dose was determined from a previously pilot\nexperiment based on the effect in SBP after 15 days of the\ntreatment. The rats consumed a daily dose of approxi-\nmately 0.6 g/kg. There was no difference (p>0.05) between\nthe mean dose consumed by the groups treated with CP\nkg)] during the 75 days of the treatment.\nDetermination of the main components of the\nCP extract\nTwo predominant peaks detected at 280 nm in the\nLiquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass\nSpectrometry (LC-ESI-MS+) analysis of CP extract\nrepresent the chlorogenic acid and orientin. The pres-\nence of chlorogenic acid was confirmed by comparison\nwith a UV/VIS spectrum of the authentic sample. The\nmatched. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant peak\nin CP extract, followed by orientin. The identity of ori-\nentin was confirmed by RT (14.9 min) and the fragmen-\ntation patterns in ESI/MS-. It has been shown that\norientin inhibits ACE in in vitro studies.22\nSystolic pressure blood (SBP), body weight and\nalbumin excretion (AE)\nThe 5/6 NE rats showed a significant increase in SBP and\nAE compared to the sham rats. However, the increase in\nto NE rats (Table 1). There was no difference in body\nweight between 5/6 NE groups (Table 1).\nRenal function studies\nThe 5/6 NE rats presented reduction in GFR and increase\nin the sodium and potassium fractional excretion com-\npared to rats from sham groups. Treatment with CP extract\nreduced all these alterations. However, the change in urine\nosmolality was not modified by treatment with CP extract\n(Table 2).\nTGF- and MCP-1 urinary excretion\nIncrease in the urinary excretion of TGF- and MCP-1 was\nobserved in 5/6 NE rats when compared to sham groups.\nThese alterations were attenuated by CP extract treatment\n(Table 3). Data from the S+CP group are not shown.\nEnzymatic activity assay\nIncrease in ACE activity in both renal tissue and plasma\nwas observed in 5/6 NE rats when compared to sham\ngroup. The increased activity in renal tissue was attenuated\nby CP extract treatment (Table 3). There was no significant\ndifference in ACE activity between S and S+CP groups\n(data not shown).\nLight microscopy\nLight microscopy studies of the renal cortex of rats that\nunderwent 5/6 NE revealed the following morphological\nfeatures, which are characteristic of this model: glomeru-\nlosclerosis, tubular lumen dilation with denuded base-\nment membrane, swelling/flattening of proximal tubular\ncells with brush border loss, tubular atrophy, and an\nincrease in the interstitial area with inflammatory cell\ninfiltrates. These histological changes were less intense in\n434 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nthe NE+CP rats (Figure 1(a)\u00ad(e)). The score for glomeru-\nlosclerosis was higher in the NE rats untreated compared\nto NE+CP rats and the fractional relative interstitial area\nwas also higher in these rats (p<0.05, NE vs NE+CP)\n(Figure 1(f)).\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nThe expressions of vimentin in the tubulointerstitial area\nand desmin at the glomerular edge were higher in the\nrenal cortex of 5/6 NE rats than in sham rats. These\nincreases were attenuated in NE rats by treatment with the\nCP extract (Figure 2). The increased p-JNK expression\nand the number of ED1-positive cells in the renal cortex\ntubulointerstitium and glomeruli observed in 5/6 NE rats\nwere also lower in NE+CP rats (Figure 3). The number of\nAII positive cells in the tubulointerstitial area from the\nrenal cortex was higher in the NE rats compared to the\nsham rats and this increase was less intense in NE+CP\ngroup (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study show that treatment with CP\nextract reduced the blood pressure and the functional and\nstructural renal changes in 5/6 NE rats. These effects were\nassociated with the reductions of the number of positive\ncells for AII, as well as the ACE activity in the renal cor-\ntex of CP-treated rats. The increase in AII renal content\ncould be due to higher plasma levels of AII and/or the\nTable 1.

We observed a\nsignificant reduction in the number of macrophages in the\nglomeruli and tubulointerstitial area of the renal cortex\nfrom 5/6 NE rats treated with CP extract. The reduction of\nthese inflammatory cells in the renal cortex of the treated\nrats was associated with the reduction of AII and p-JNK\nexpressions, and of ACE activity in renal cortex and of the\nurinary levels of TGF- and MCP-1.

There is evidence that urinary\nTGF- is derived from renal biosynthesis and not from\nplasma.1,33 In previous clinical and experimental studies\nperformed in our laboratory, we observed a correlation\nbetween the rate of urinary TGF- excretion and the inci-\ndence of glomerular sclerosis and tubule interstitial\nlesions.1,34 Together, TGF- and AII can induce pheno-\ntypic modification in cells, causing them to express -\nsmooth muscle actin and increase the production of\ncollagen and other ECM components, which was evi-\ndenced by the higher fractional interstitial area in renal\ncortex from NE compared to NE+CP rats.\nCP extract treatment also attenuated the podocyte\nlesions in the NE rats and this was evidenced by reduction\nof desmin expression at the glomerular edge, a sensitive\nmarker of podocyte lesions.29 The reduction in podocyte\ndamage in the NE+CP rats can explain the decreased albu-\nminuria in these animals until 60 days after surgery.
