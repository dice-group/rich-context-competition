    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe seek to advance cultural models theory by contributing to issues related to theory, methods, and testing the external\nvalidity of a cultural model. We propose that cultural models are learned as if they were truly properties of collectivities but\nhave no primary existence except in individual representations of them. The shared aspect of cultural models also implies\ncollective awareness of the if\u00adthen entailments of cultural models. We use inductive ethnographic methods of freelisting\n(n = 80) and pile sorting (n = 39) to derive a cultural model of romantic love in the United States. From these tasks, we\ndeveloped a cultural model of successful romantic love consisting of normative scenarios. For successful romantic love\nrelations, a person would feel excited about meeting their beloved; make passionate and intimate love as opposed to only\nphysical love; feel comfortable with the beloved, behaving in a companionable, friendly way with one's partner; listen to the\nother's concerns, offering to help out in various ways if necessary; and, all the while, keeping a mental ledger of the degree\nto which altruism and passion are mutual. Our model is supported through an examination of two extended case studies.\nFurther research is required, of course, but we believe we have a rather novel and dynamic cultural model that is falsifiable\nand predictive of successful love relationships. The model is unique in that it combines passion with comfort and friendship\nas properties of romantic love.\n",

The second half uses two\nextended cases to illustrate how this model works in every-\nday life and how predictive it is of participants' assessments\nof their romantic love relationship as well as to shed light on\nthe decisions they make and actions they take. Taken as a\nwhole, both sections provide a road map for conducting cul-\ntural models research. There are other road maps, but we\nshow how theory and methods can be linked to culture and\npsychology in an explicit way for investigating cultural mod-\nels and how humans use them for purposive behaviors. We\nare aware of the fact that there are likely to be ethnic, gender,\nage, and class differences as well as cross-cultural differ-\nences that are missed in this research; however, our aim is to\nhighlight what we suspect may be prototypical features of\nAmerican conceptualizations of romantic love.\nWe need to add that this study is an attempt to capture the\ncore generic features of a cultural model of romantic love. We\nthink we have done this; however, there may well be variants\nor alternative models of love relationships that also exist. We\ndoubt that there is a one-size-fits-all cultural model of roman-\ntic love that fits all people equally well. To assert that we\ndescribe a cultural model of romantic love does not mean (a)\nthat there are not other competing models, (b) nor that people\nwho share this model share it in the same way. As the \"love\nstyles\" literature that we will discuss shows, many people\nprefer other styles of love besides romantic; thus, companion-\nate sorts of love or some mix of various styles are also found\n1State University of New York at New Paltz, USA\n2Vytautus Magnus University, Kaunas, Lithuania\n3University of California, Riverside, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nVictor C. de Munck, State University of New York at New Paltz, 1 hawk\nEmail: Victor@bestweb.net\nRomantic Love in the United States:\nApplying Cultural Models Theory\nand Methods\nVictor C. de Munck1,2 and David B.

John Alan Lee\ndeveloped a \"color theory of love\" in which varieties (or\nhues) of love are comprised of a set of primary styles that mix\ntogether to form a potentially infinite number of \"love styles\"\n(Lee's phrase). However, there were six main love styles--\nagape, mania, ludus, storge, eros, and pragma. These styles\nhave generated much survey-based research, particularly by\nthe foremost adopters of his theory, Clyde Hendrick and\nStyle theories of love are functional, social-psychological\ntheories by which individuals and couples can be classified into\nsome set of love styles by virtue of how much they possess of\neach salient attribute of that love style. It is unfortunate, how-\never, that style theories tend to identify individuals with singu-\nlar, all or nothing styles, while recognizing that individuals, in\nfact, have admixtures of those styles present in their love \"pro-\nfile\" and that these proportions may change in terms of context\nor partner. The Hendricks and Hendrick (2006) wrote,\nThe \"amount\" of each love style that an individual manifests can\nliterally be plotted on a graph. The shape of the profile, its\nchange over time, and its relationship to other variables become\npotential empirical questions to be answered by research guided\nby hypotheses. To date, our research has not dealt with profiles\nper se, but with each of the six dimensions individually. (p. 151)\nWe admire the work of the Hendricks and suggest that cul-\ntural models theory helps advance the bounded delineations\nof love types inherent in a \"styles\"-based theory of love.\nThe evolutionary psychological paradigm on romantic\nlove has become quite popular thanks to David Buss and\nHelen Fisher, whose works have been on nonfiction best-\nseller lists. Recently, this approach has come under some\nbecause of its questionable assumptions and its selective,\noften misguided, use of ethnographic material to reflect back\non the sexual mores of Paleolithic foragers. Evolutionary\npsychologists have developed a field for the study of roman-\ntic love that can be divided into three components. The first\nis that of evolutionarily adapted mental modules that dispose\npredictable sorts of mate selection, satisfaction, and retention\nThe second, highlighted by the work of Helen Fisher and her\ncolleagues, is how these universal expressions of sex, attach-\nment, and intimacy are promoted by the human neural and\nhormonal systems. As a result, Fisher asserts that love (as the\noverarching term for the articulation of sex, attachment, and\nintimacy) is a \"drive,\" like hunger and thirst, and not an emo-\nMashek, Li, & Brown, 2002). The third research area derived\nfrom the biobehavioral approach is in cross-cultural research\nas reflected in the works of Jankowiak and Fischer (1992);\nMunck et al. (de Munck, Korotayev, & Khaltourina, 2009; de\nMunck, Korotayev, Khaltourina, & de Munck, 2010). These\nresearchers want to demonstrate that romantic love is a cul-\ntural universal or examine various corollaries that follow as\na result. Much of this work relies on primary ethnographic\nand survey data while others on cross-cultural databases such\nas the Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF). While our\nresearch concerns one culture only, we note that single cul-\ntural studies with an eye toward universal features of love are\nnot at all uncommon. Since the late 1990s, there has been a\nveritable cottage industry of studies on romantic love in cul-\ntural anthropology. Most of this has been spurred by gender\nstudies, interest in globalization, and as an extension of more\ntraditional anthropological interests in marriage practices\nand norms. Research on romantic love in cultural anthropol-\nogy has been mostly ethnographic and qualitative rather than\ntheory and survey driven. In this cultural and nonevolution-\nary frame, some representative cultural anthropologists'\nwriting on romantic love, sex, and marriage are LauraAhearn\nWhat makes these researchers representative of writings on\nthese subjects in cultural anthropology are (a) their focus on\nethnography written from a reflexive point of view (i.e., the\nauthor is a subject in the ethnography; (b) obtaining data via\ninterviews and conversations or directed dialogues with their\ninformants; (c) favoring a grounded theoretical approach\nthat derives cultural constructs, motivations, ideologies, and\npractices from discourse or textual analysis; (d) the\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 3\nmultisited or multimode nature of their work; (e) an attention\nto applied considerations particularly in terms of HIV/AIDS\nand social justice; (f) the concern with constructions of gen-\nder and modernity as shaping conceptions of intimacy, sex,\nand the self vis-\u00e0-vis one's spouse or partner; and (g) chang-\ning patterns of love, sex, and marriage as a result of modern-\nization, migration, and globalization. These works are\nsituated in a contemporary context that is attentive to agency,\ncontingency, macrostructural forces, and emotion as cultur-\nBarry Hewlett and Bonnie Hewlett (2008) and William\nJankowiak (2008) were among the few researchers in cul-\ntural anthropology who bridged what seems to be a theoreti-\ncal and methodological divide between psychologists and\ncultural anthropologists in the study of romantic love. Their\nwork combines a comparative theoretical approach with both\nethnographic and survey methods to evaluate their hypothe-\nses or research questions. It is within the spirit of these\nresearchers' approach to the study of romantic love that our\nproject is situated. That is our goal is to propose a theoretical\nand methodological approach that can be adapted to ethno-\ngraphic (local, contextualized) and ethnological (cross-cul-\ntural, universalist) research goals. Jankowiak, Shen, Yao,\nWang, and Volsche (2015) have very recently conducted\nresearch among urban youths in China directly using ques-\ntionnaire criteria designed to test de Munck et al.'s (2009)\nproposed universal criteria of romantic love. Their factor\nanalysis of the questionnaire results substantiated four of the\nfive criteria that are found in the model tested here--that is,\naltruism, intrusive thinking, emotional fulfillment, and psy-\nchological betterment. The fifth sexual attraction or passion\nwas not tested but found to be present among urban youth\n(Jankowiak et al., 2015). We, therefore, assume that these\ncriteria will also be found (among others) as constituting a\ncultural model of romantic love in America.\nLiterature Review--Cultural Models\nTheory\nThe concept of cultural models was first introduced in\nHolland and Quinn's (1987) introduction to an edited vol-\nume titled Cultural Models in Language and Thought. They\nwrote,\nCultural models are presupposed, taken-for-granted models of\nthe world that are widely shared (although not necessarily to the\nexclusion of others, alternative models) by the members of a\nsociety and that play an enormous role in their understanding of\nthat world and their behavior in it. (Holland & Quinn, 1987,\np. 4, emphasis in original)\nIn the same volume, Roy D'Andrade elaborated by empha-\nsizing that \"A cultural model is a cognitive schema that is\nintersubjectively shared by a social group\" (Holland &\nfor granted\" aspects of cultural models are central to\nunderstanding their function. We assume, as an \"objective\nfact,\" that the relevant others of our social group also have\nand use the same cultural models. As a consequence, we can\nanticipate their behaviors and presume they are able to ade-\nquately \"read\" our behaviors. The \"taken for granted\" notion\nalso presumes that the cultural model operates out of our\nawareness, effortlessly and in a \"chunked\" manner. For\ninstance, when recounting a baseball game and one states\nthat \"Jeter hit a home run,\" we do not need to unpack all that\nis left unsaid (i.e., the ball, bat, stadium, \"Jeter,\" or the flight\nof the ball, etc.).\nD'Andrade and Strauss (1992) advanced the idea of cul-\ntural models as models that \"instigate\" or motivate behav-\niors. Thus, romantic love can motivate lower level behaviors\nsuch as calling someone up, going on dates, declaring sexual\nexclusivity and commitment, and so on. Strauss (1992) used\nthe idea of personal semantic models to show how cultural\nmodels are personalized and have variable motivational\nforce depending on the life histories of individuals. Her main\ncase study was of a man who saw his role as \"breadwinner\"\nas a basic role requirement of fathers and husbands, but who\nmore strongly identified with his own role as a marathon run-\nner. The cultural model theorists mentioned above show that\ncultural models are not independent of each other but form a\nnetwork of models with varying degrees of motivational and\npersonal salience depending on individual life history and\npersonality.\nOur theoretical orientation and goals are quite similar to\nthat pioneered by Quinn in her research on marriage, Strauss\non her research of the working class, and Holland and\nthe concept of cultural model (or schema) to describe emo-\ntions, thoughts, and actions as they occur in everyday life.\nThe difference is that these authors predominantly rely on\ninterview material; we, in contrast, seek to first develop our\ncultural model of romantic love from a variety of systematic\nmethods pioneered by Romney and his colleagues. Two of\nthe main methods described by Weller and Romney (1988)\nare freelisting and pile sorting. These methods tend not to be\nadopted by the above researchers. We have synthesized these\ntwo approaches by adopting the freelist and pile sorting\nmethods to develop our cultural model of romantic love and\ninterview data to show how they may work to guide and\ninterpret behaviors in everyday love relationships.\nDealing With Contingency in Cultural\nModel Theory\nA cultural model that people use must include some range of\nresponses to contingencies so that people will be able to\nanticipate and maneuver (i.e., survive) in other than the usual\ncontexts. Without such contingencies, the model will have\nno resilience or situated potential. The cultural model has to\ncontain shared, systematic information on what is expected\nwhen the default model cannot be followed.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn our discussion below, progressing to and including the\ncase materials, we tackle the issue of cultural models and\ncontingency by moving from thin (abstracted) to thick (con-\ntextualized) data. The thin data are used to develop a cultural\nmodel of romantic love while the thick data are used to deter-\nmine whether informants use our model, how they instantiate\nit in their reasoning and behaviors, and to discover how they\nimprovise when the cultural model is not realized or cannot\nbe fully applied.\nExamining Freelist Data\nIn deciding on our sample, we wanted only people who were\npresently or recently engaged in a romantic love relationship.\nFor the case studies, we only recruited informants who were\npresently in a romantic love relationship (and not of the \"affair\"\nvariety). In total, 40 Americans from a small rural town in\nupstate New York, and 40 from New York City were asked to\nrespond to the freelist question, \"What do you associate with\nromantic love?\" The respondents were between 20 and 50\nyears of age; 44 were females and 36 were males. Our sample\nwas obtained \"on the fly\" by recruiting individuals at various\npublic settings--laundromats, parks, on campus, bus stations,\nand the like.All informants were offered US$10 for their labor.\nThe first author with two research assistants went over the\nfreelist data and coded them as single terms or phrases when\npossible. The majority had to agree (two of three) for the cod-\ning of extended texts, and texts that appeared as synonyms\n(joy/joyful).There were no obvious differences in the responses\nof respondents of different ages, gender, or between rural and\nurban New Yorkers; consequently, freelists were combined.\nThe freelist terms used for analysis below include only\nterms mentioned four or more times. This rather arbitrary\ncutoff point is, according to Borgatti and Halgin (2011), ade-\nquate for analyzing a list of terms that has some reach across\nour sample and, thus, can be considered \"to some extent\" a\ncultural domain (see Figure 1).\nAfter finishing the freelists, we discussed the responses\nwith most informants to aid our understanding of what they\nmeant by the terms. We are confident in our interpretations;\nhowever, we expect to conduct further studies of the key\nfreelist terms to enhance the validity of our interpretations.\nThe subsequent pile sort indicates the main semantic dimen-\nsions that underlie their relationship vis-\u00e0-vis each other.\nThe terms fit quite well with the emphasis of different\nresearchers on romantic love. For instance, \"being together\"\nand \"connection\" fit with criteria of romantic love proposed\nby most sociologists or psychologists, particularly those who\nemphasize a \"Platonic model of romantic love\" that K\u00f6vecses\nromantic love in the United States (see also Lindholm, 1998a,\n\"Sex\" and \"passion\" fit with most of the definitions of roman-\ntic love that acknowledge the erotic/passionate aspect of\ntheory of love posits passion as one vertex; Berscheid &\nsynthesis of companionate and passionate feelings). \"Mutual\"\non the importance of equal status as a precipitating condition\nand attribute of romantic love, as well as de Munck and\nromantic love, as a criterion for marriage, is causally related\nto an increase in female status and intimacy. While Sternberg\nviews intimacy as a second vertex, he does not reflect on an\nassessment of mutuality as a necessary condition for inti-\nmacy. Yet, it seems to us unlikely that romantic love could\nflourish as a cultural norm or even as a possibility, unless a\ncultural space can be created for the couple to meet as equals\nTerms such as \"honest,\" \"trust,\" \"do anything,\" and \"sac-\nrifice\" reflect that the beloved is thought to possess personal\nvirtues that make him or her unique and worth loving. This\nfits well with the Platonic conception of romantic love as\nUnited States. It furthermore supports the main premise of\nlove proposed by Hegi and Bergner (2010) that \"Investment\nin the well-being of the other [IWB] . . . was the characteris-\ntic most strongly and consistently endorsed as essential to the\nfour kinds of love under investigation\" (p. 633).\nFinally, we found that romantic love is associated with the\nterms \"friendship,\" \"comfortable,\" and \"content.\" These are\nthree attributes Jankowiak (2008) would identify with \"com-\nfort love\" and Swidler would identify with her informants'con-\nceptualizations of love after marriage (i.e., \"real love\"). This\nFigure 1. Freelist terms for \"what do you associate with\nromantic love?\" sorted by frequency.\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 5\nsuggests that key features of what would more colloquially be\nreferred to as companionate love are also a subset of romantic\nlove, at least in the American cultural model. Berscheid and\nHendrick (2003) have viewed companionate and romantic love\nto be in an \"either/or\" relationship (Hendricks & Hendrick,\nthat \"it is quite common for young lovers to claim that their\npartner is their best friend\" (p. 163). However, despite the\nbelated recognition of \"friendship\" as an aspect of romantic\nlove, there is no attempt to incorporate it into their love style\nmodels of romantic love. Fehr (1988), using a freelist task, is\nthe only researcher, to our knowledge, who found friendship to\nbe a significant feature of romantic love in her Canadian sam-\nple; thus, her work supports our findings.\nThe implications of our model are that our model of\nromantic love seems to include aspects of different love styles\nsuch as agape, companionate love, and storge. It suggests that\ndelimiting love into styles does not quite capture the full\nrange of emotions and relational qualities that are associated\nwith a romantic relationship. We suggest that love styles may\nbetter refer to tendencies that are foregrounded and back-\ngrounded or more prominent in a relationship. Indeed, this is\nimplied in much of the styles literature, especially by Lee\n(1976), but it is not applied in the research on love styles. We\ndo think that as an individual's love relationships may vary\nover time, certain features of the relationship wax or wane.\nPile Sorts: The Structure of\nRomantic Love\nTo further explore the structural relationship between the\naspects elicited through the freelist, we took the top 44\nterms (all mentioned 2 or more times) to conduct a pile sort\ntask in which terms are sorted in \"piles\" based on their\nperceived similarity to one another. Recruiting methods\nwere the same as before; our sample consisted of 20 infor-\nmants from the rural area and 19 from New York City (we\nlost one pile sort form). Informants were asked to sort the\ncards into two piles and to continue dividing into two piles\nuntil they could no longer divide or were left with only two\nindex cards per pile. The goal of this exercise was to reveal\nthe semantic structure of the relationships among the\nterms. An \"aggregate proximity matrix\" (aka agprox)--the\nproportion of times terms were sorted with each other--\nwas produced from the pile sort data. The higher the per-\ncent of times terms were sorted together, they are judged as\nbeing similar in meaning by the sample. A multidimen-\nsional scale (MDS) is produced directly from the agprox\nand provides a visually readable (i.e., interpretable) repre-\nsentation of the agprox matrix (see Figure 2). Terms\nlocated closer to each other were sorted together more fre-\nquently than those far away; thus, they can be interpreted\nas more similar to each other in meaning than terms that\nare farther away. As it is a two dimensional MDS, the\nterms are organized according to two dimensions of rela-\ntions that can be read along the up-down, \"vertical\" dimen-\nsion and the left-to-right, \"horizontal\" dimension. The\ndimensions refer to underlying semantic continua along\nwhich the terms are located.\nMultidimensional scales are intended to be interpreted in\nterms of underlying continua. The horizontal dimension\nseems to be graded along an evaluative, \"good-bad\" contin-\nuum with \"bad\" terms along the left side (from the reader's\nview) and good terms to the right. \"Free\" is the only \"mid-\ndle\" term, indicating that some informants evaluated it as\n\"bad\" and some as \"good,\" which seems reasonable given\nthat some informants might perceive \"freedom\" as a threat to\na love relationship, while others might interpret \"freedom\"\nas an outcome of love. For instance, Swidler's (2002) infor-\nmants noted that in \"true love,\" one is free to express one's\n\"true self.\"\nFigure 2. MDS of terms associated with romantic love (using pile sort data) by U.S. informants.\nNote. MDS = multidimensional scale.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe vertical dimension appears to be an energy dimension\nmoving from low energy terms on the top to high energy\nterms on the bottom. Thus, lost, vulnerable, helpless are sim-\nilar to content, secure, not alone in that they are not high\nenergy feelings or qualities. Frustrated, angry, and jealous\nare similar to strong, care, warm, equality in that they are\ntypically (though not always) mid-level energy conditions\nthat do not seem quite as \"energetic,\" for instance, as the\nterms below them. At the bottom of the MDS, the terms\nobsessive, anxious, explosive, located on the negative side,\nare similar to butterflies, passion, excited, giddy in that they\nrefer to high energy conditions or states.\nBased on the above analyses of the freelist and pile sort\ndata, we constructed a general cultural model of successful\nor positive romantic love. The proposed cultural model con-\nsists of a \"thin\" set of unmarked normative scenarios that\nexemplify the values, feelings, states, and attendant generic\npreferred actions that either reflect or cause those feelings,\nvalues, and states as presented in the MDS. Thus, for suc-\ncessful (i.e., \"good\" or \"happy\") romantic love relations, a\nperson would feel excited about meeting their beloved and\nmaking passionate intimate love, as opposed to only physical\nlove; and at the same time feel comfortable, behave in a com-\npanionable, friendly way with one's partner, listen to the\nother's concerns about her or his job, offer to help out in vari-\nous ways--while keeping a mental ledger of the degree to\nwhich altruism and passion are mutual. This cultural model\nof romantic love should be predictive of states, values, and\nfeelings that are associated with romantic love in the love\nstories or experiences of people who hold and value this\nmodel of romantic love. Note that this model differs from the\nuniversal feature model of love used for cross-cultural analy-\nsis in that it relies on an episodic memory to create a script.\nWe must emphasize that we are proposing a cultural model\nof romantic love. We do not claim that everyone values or\nholds this model but we do assert that it seems to be a preva-\nlent and prototypical model of romantic love that accords\nboth with our interview data and with the social-psychologi-\ncal literature on romantic love. Indeed, we think most people\nknow this model implicitly if not explicitly, but many people\nmay opt for a companionate or other type of model of love\nrelationship depending, among other things, on their person-\nalities. Further investigation with larger samples will expli-\ncate the extent to which we can more confidently generalize\nour findings to a larger population. We do not think the\naspects of the cultural model described above are offered\ndirectly by informants. Instead, they are embedded in the\nindividually constructed versions of culturally shared sto-\nries--stories that are the unmarked prototypic exemplars that\nget extended to and then realized in individual particulars.\nFor example, we expect that if one is in a love relationship,\nshe or he will tell stories that reflect the honesty and commit-\nment of the beloved, or perhaps how commitment had been\nan obstacle for a while but overcome over time. If there are\nconcerns about trust, these are likely to be mentioned in\nstories that explain or describe why there is a lack of trust\nand that will also reflect a measure of dissatisfaction with the\nrelationship. We would expect that a happy story of love will\nmost likely include one or more of the positive aspects of\nlove that we have found in the data from which we have\ninferred our proposed cultural model.\nThe characteristics used by informants to describe the\nmodel are capable of modification as a result of the dynamic\nfeedback loops between sets of concepts that describe or\ncharacterize aspects of a given cultural model and individual\nrealizations of the model in specific concrete situations. In\nthe ideal scenario, these coexist without stress or disjunc-\ntion--that is, the relationship is assessed as mutual, commit-\nted, and intimate, there is passion, and there is friendship.\nBut in people's specific instantiations of these, they often\nhave to deal with and assess the implications of apparently\n(and stressfully) disjunctive or inconsistent attributes; this\nassessment can move them to variant cultural models or can\nlead them to reconceptualize the seeming inconsistencies as\nsomething consistent. Inconsistencies come up quite a bit in\nthe two case studies we present, and we see how the infor-\nmants deal with such inconsistencies either by modifying\ntheir romantic love model (\"maybe I'm incapable of pas-\nsion\") or causing some kind of ambiguity-based conflict (\"is\nit love or is it lust?\"). In fact, it is quite possible that, similar\nto Hutchins's (1995) description of navigation or Gatewood\nand Lowe's (2006) account of credit unions, no one ever uses\nor \"sees\" the whole cultural model at once, but only those\naspects that fit a particular situation or upon which someone\nis reflecting.\nWe hypothesize that the more a member of a love dyad\nassesses the dyad to fit the above model, the more satisfied\nshe or he is with the relationship. The less the relationship\nfits the above model, the less satisfied the member who\nmakes that assessment and the more they will try to alter the\nrelationship to fit the above model, or remain dissatisfied, or\nterminate the dyad. We also hypothesize that many scenar-\nios, as presented by informants, will illustrate attributes from\nthe cultural model we have developed. We assume that sce-\nnarios illustrating aspects of our cultural model will be pre-\nsented as salient or go unmentioned as default scenarios that\n\"go without saying\" whereas those scenarios that contrast\nwith any aspect of our cultural model will be marked and\ndeliberated on by the informant as somehow deviant from\ntheir understanding and expectations of a successful roman-\ntic love relationship.\nA Pilot Test of Our Cultural Model\nThrough Two Case Studies\nThe two informants used for pilot testing our cultural model\nare Rose, a 20-year-old student, and Darryl, a 42-year-old\nelectrician, construction worker, and general handyman\n(these are pseudonyms). We chose these two for two reasons:\nFirst, we have four full interviews over a span of a year for\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 7\nboth, which have been fully coded. Second, within the con-\ntext of an article, we aim to provide thick descriptive data\nfrom the interviews to show how either the given informant\nuses the proposed cultural model or how we can use it to\nexplain her or his behavior. We did not select them a priori\nbecause they fit our cultural model; indeed, we would be\nhard-pressed to find two people who fit it in some perfect\nway. People do not fit the model as much as our model can\nbe used to explain and predict what people think, feel, and\ndo. Our claim is that our informants are using as their refer-\nence standard a cultural model similar to the one we have put\nforth. The fullness of treatment is required to assess the rela-\ntionship of their actions and views of their actions to our pos-\nited cultural model. To add other people or to compile across\ninformants would be impossible, within an article format,\nwithout losing the way a model is used during the develop-\nment of a relationship over time and across different situa-\ntions and conditions.\nThe interviews were examined by reading through the\ntranscriptions and then coding and querying them for pas-\nsages that reflect our proposed cultural model as well as\nwhatever other features appeared salient to our informants\nbut were not captured by our cultural model. Interviews\ncommonly took 1 hr, often more. The first three interviews\nwith each informant took place over a 2-month period and\nthe fourth interview was approximately 9 months after the\nthird interview. Both Darryl and Rose had been in serious\nrelationships; Darryl had married when he was 31 years old\nand separated from his wife when he was 33 (officially\ndivorcing her when he was 40). He had a son, 9 years old, at\nthe time I was interviewing him. Darryl had custody of his\nson--as his wife had substance-abuse problems and was in\nand out of mental health centers. He worked as a landscaper\nand electrician. Darryl is of European descent, intelligent,\naffable, did not have a BA but was taking courses occasion-\nally with the intention of becoming a schoolteacher. He had\nserved in the military and was interested in the Lakota\nIndians and archeology as a hobby. He was not particularly\npolitical and referred to himself as an \"Independent.\"\nRose was a 21-year-old student at a New England\nUniversity (not the one where the first author teaches). She\nhad a 24-hr-a-week job and a 3.80 grade point average\n(GPA). Her parents were from Italy and apparently had an\narranged marriage. She had a steady relationship with a non-\nItalian White male that lasted from high school till the end of\nher senior year in college. We know nothing about her politi-\ncal inclination but guess that her background is middle-of-\nthe-road to Democrat.\nWe will provide excerpts from the interviews beginning\nwith Rose. The interviews serve as a source of instances\nand attributes for exploring the usefulness of our cultural\nmodel of romantic love--and we are using the interviews\nas a means to flesh out (i.e., provide scenarios) and focus in\non the cultural model suggested by the freelist and MDS\ndata. A brief assessment of the interview excerpts as they\neither fit or contravene our proposed cultural model follows\neach excerpt.\nCase Study 1: Rose\nRose's first interview data.Rose met her boyfriend, Josh, in\nthe 11th grade, she says, \"All my friends had boyfriends and\nI was just sick of it; I mean I was a fat lonely person just by\nmyself.\" She and Josh became a couple quickly.\nRose continues,\nAfter 1 month together he [i.e., Josh] said he was in love with\nme and I thought that was just too soon, that there was no way.\nAnd I told him, there was just no way he could know enough of\nme to say \"I love you\" . . . We stayed together every day. . . . I\nwas looking for love at that moment, you know, to satisfy my\nneeds for that time period. Because after school I wanted to be\nwith someone, I didn't want to just sit at home and watch TV. . .\nI wanted to be with someone. I wasn't looking for three years\ndown the road, two years down the road; I was just looking for\nright now. Who am I going to bring to my prom? You know it\nwould be great to bring someone there whom I loved to bring to\nthe prom with me and that's what my train of thinking was of a\nrelationship . . .\nAssessment of proposed cultural model.Here we see that\npeer pressure and the social milieu of high school is a pri-\nmary motivation for Rose to search for what she calls a love\nrelationship. This interview reflects something that was\nnot picked up in the freelist or pile sort data and that is the\nimportance of one's relevant peer group and what they are\ndoing to \"pre-accelerate\" (Manning, 2009) the process of\nfalling in love. Of course, this should not be surprising to us,\nas romantic love is by its very nature construed as a social\nrelationship. We have here what is sometimes spoken of as\n\"social pressure\" and affiliative goals, with the understand-\ning that such pressure and striving to \"fit in\" can be either\nexplicit or implicit. It should be noted that although social\npressure and the desire to fit in may be motivating factors\nin themselves, they are not attributes or part of the default\nromantic love model, but they can be part of alternative\n(marked) and negatively valued alternative cultural model\nstory lines. Here, also, Rose is able to look at her behavior\nboth from \"inside\" (how she felt and thought) and \"outside\"\n(how others expected her to be) perspectives and see how\nthese converged to influence her own motives and behavior.\nCultural models often include multiple roles (any of whose\nfillers may be applying the model) entailing the possibility\nof seeing the modeled situation from the perspective of any\nof those roles. Thus, cultural models, importantly, provide\na framework for people to consider and take account of the\nlikely perception of their behavior by others or the effects of\ntheir behavior on others.\nIn other ways, she presents scenarios and thought-feeling\ncomplexes that fit with our cultural model: the two of them\nbeing together every day and not wanting to be alone. She\n8 SAGE Open\nalso indicated that her romantic model of romantic love also\ncontained a timeline based on the development of the rela-\ntionship akin to Quinn's (1992) metaphorical model of\nromantic love as a \"journey\" and \"project.\"\nSecond interview data. This was a key interview session, and\nwe will provide two passages. In the interest of space and\nwhat will be patently clear to the reader, we will keep the\nanalysis quite brief. The point is not to analyze as much as it\nis for readers themselves to recognize how key aspects of our\nproposed cultural model are expressed by and, thus, have\npredictive ability and provide insight into Rose's discourse.\nVdM:\nLet's talk about your general philosophy of love\nand how it fits in with your life . . . how important\nlove is to you.\nRose:\nSure yeah. Let's see. Uhmm . . . let me think for a\nsecond . . . well to be in love what I would want\nis . . . I want someone who is my friend who I can\ntalk to who cares about what my opinions are\nuhmm. Someone who does treat you differently\nthan other people so you can tell that you are spe-\ncial to him and that when you are together you\nfeel secure you feel that the love is present there.\nUhm . . . and it was a friendship too and uhm and\nto be in love allows you to have fun with that per-\nson no matter what you do it could be the stupid-\nest thing and it is just fun with that person because\nyou get along so well . . . and I don't know . . . you\ncan share the most intimate like deepest thoughts\nyou have or anything embarrassing you know any\nbad thing, you can share it with that person . . .\nyou have to feel comfortable with that person you\nhave to be able to trust them uhm you never have\nto fear that when you tell them something it won't\ngo in one ear and out the other that they'll remem-\nber what you say you know . . . uhm . . . they\nreally have to care about you . . . this is all going\nboth ways too uhm and.\nExcerpt 2.2.We had been discussing Rose's life at school\nand she describes a temporary boyfriend, named George.\nVdM:\nHow did you meet George? [She begins by dis-\ncussing Josh.]\nR:\nWe were just so emotionally attached . . . [in high\nschool] . . . and . . . during my first year . . . [in\ncollege] . . . I thought he would cheat on me. I\nkept saying to guys that I wouldn't break up with\nanyone because of Josh and then I became inter-\nested in George and I just knew that he was so\nmuch better for me . . . [than Josh]. I told him\nabout Josh but I didn't tell Josh about George. I\nthought it would naturally happen that I would\nget attracted to someone else. So I told Josh that I\nwanted to see other people because we hadn't\nbeen with other people. If he wasn't so honest and\nso good to me [pause] I know that he would never\ncheat on me . . . [referring to Josh]. He just knows\nthat we're going to get married . . . I am afraid\nthat if I do break up with him I'm not going to\nfind someone as good as him. . . .\nVdM: And Josh, how does he fit or not fit hmmm?\nR:\nWith Josh I'm attracted to him but for some rea-\nson I can't get into the physical part of it and I\nthink that totally is what's wrong with our rela-\ntionship right now. I am not sexually attracted to\nJosh but am to George . . . that's putting it into a\nslot 'cause I feel bad 'cause I want to be that way\nbut I can't and he needs that and I need that in a\nrelationship and it's okay for me right now that\nit's not too physical 'cause that's not really what I\nwant and uhm I don't know. But for him . . . that's\npart of a relationship that's what makes a rela-\ntionship different from a friendship. And I think it\nhas to be there for you to distinguish a relation-\nship from a friendship to keep it going . . .\nVdM: Is that the primary difference?\nR:\nThat's not the complete difference but you can\n. . . like I have a friend right now and we have\nlove for each other just because we have known\neach other a really long time and we're really\ngood friends but it doesn't necessarily lead to a\nrelationship . . . maybe we could have passionate\nsex but yeah I guess there has to be something\nelse there I don't know if I can say what it is but\nthere has to be something else . . .\nShe had sexual relations with George but not intercourse.\nFinally, she broke up the relationship with George because\nshe told Josh who became very upset and she says,\nhe loves me so much and I loved him but I was hurting him . . .\n[it] made me sad. . . . I just said I was sorry . . . we didn't really\ntalk much afterwards and then I left. I told him I never would do\nit again, . . . that I was sorry that I loved him so much and I\nprobably knew that I was going to do it again.\nAssessment of proposed cultural model.In Excerpt 2.1,\nRose is referring to attributes associated with friendship,\nintimacy, in short, aspects one finds in the \"good,\" low-mid-\nlevel energy area of the MDS. She also introduces a linked\ncultural model of the \"true\" self (vs. false or staged self) that\nallows her to be stupid and vulnerable and, hence, intimate.\nThe \"if-then\" relationship between a true self and true love\nwas also emphasized by Swidler's (2002) informants. How-\never, in Swidler's case, it was associated with love after mar-\nriage when an enduring relationship had been established.\nIn this case, true love is, according to Swidler, contrasted\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 9\nwith romantic love. We did not find such a contrast probably\nbecause both Rose and Darryl were single rather than mar-\nried and were involved in the courtship rather than the settled\ndown phase of a relationship.\nIntimacy, altruism, and mutuality--concepts we have\nidentified with our cultural model of romantic love--were\nalso expressed in Excerpt 2.1. In addition, and something not\npresented in our model of romantic love but certainly not\nopposed to it, is the notion of being made to feel special. The\nidea of feeling special and \"unique\" is reflected in the com-\nplex of terms in the freelist and MDS, and is perhaps a higher\norder term for some complex of terms such as \"commitment,\ncomplete, intimacy, friendship,\" and so on. We also conjec-\nture that feeling unique is not mentioned as an aspect of\nromantic love because it is not a property per se of the model\nbut a consequence of the model and related as the idea of a\n\"true self\" to a cultural model of the self and, as a result, sug-\ngests further avenues for research.\nExcerpt 2.2 complements the first in that Rose expresses\nwhat results when the salient aspects of the \"good, high\nenergy\" dimension of romantic love are absent. This, clearly,\nis the problem in her relationship with her long-term boy-\nfriend, Josh. Again, we see how a concept of self is seam-\nlessly intertwined with the cultural model of romantic love,\nas she first considers herself at fault and is motivated to have\na relationship with George to test, in essence, if her \"self\" is\nlacking the ability for good, high energy states and feelings\nor if it is a problem of the romantic relationship itself. Our\ncultural model of romantic love does not predict that she\nwould seek another relationship, but it is a feasible predic-\ntion from our model given the absence of high energy good\nfeelings in her relationship with Josh. To rationalize the\nabsence of good, high energy feelings, she introduces a new\ncultural model--that of marriage--and evaluates Josh in\nlight of both the romantic and marriage cultural models.\nFinding him to be a strong fit with her marriage cultural\nmodel, she decides to reconsider her developing sexual rela-\ntionship with George, whom she links with romantic love.\nApparently, at that time, the cultural model for marriage hav-\ning a stronger motivating force than the one for romantic\nlove, she decides to break off her relationship with George\nand profess fidelity to Josh. Given our theory of cultural\nmodels, we expect such additional inputs as we do not\nbelieve that cultural models are cognitively engaged in pure\nisolation from others and that a major research thrust in the\nfuture will have to focus on these connections, as Strauss\nwhen introducing connectionist theory to describe cultural\nmodels.\nThird interview data (a discussion on unprotected sex)\nVdM: With Josh, did you always use a condom?\nR: In the beginning we did a lot.\nVdM: Condoms?\nR: Yeah and just recently we tend not to.\nVdM: How did that happen?\nR:\nI don't know, I thought, you know it would make\nit more exciting, I could finally feel like I was\nbeing swept off my feet.\nVdM: Was it a big decision?\nR:\nI don't know I just thought about it and decided\nto do it.\nVdM: Was he surprised?\nR: I don't know.\nVdM: Did it make a difference in your relations?\nR:\nWell I'm just a bad person to talk to about\nthis 'cause we're not that sexually active that\nmuch anymore . . . we've had unprotected sex\nlike 4 times . . . the last 4 times . . . and it wasn't\npleasurable . . . I could totally say stop and he\nwould have, but I don't. I wanted it to be pleasing\nfor me . . . and him.\nVdM:\nHave you thought of why it's not pleasing to\nyou?\nR:\nYeah I'm like that 1% [laughs] . . . the 1% that\njust can't enjoy sex.\nAssessment of proposed cultural model. This excerpt shows\nhow cultural models must be flexible enough to deal with\ncontingencies.\nObviously, life is not perfect and is, as noted before, a\ncontingent enterprise. No cultural model ever totally or per-\nfectly specifies anyone's complete behavior in any situation.\nIn part, this is because specific contingencies can move our\napplication of one or another piece of a cultural model from\nits default to some marked variant. But, more basically, we\nmust remember that a cultural model itself only actually\nspecifies what is needed for its functioning. Only when the\ncultural model is instantiated in some situation--that is,\nwhen the specifics of that situation are interpreted in terms\nof, and fitted to, the cultural model's parameters--does its\napplication acquire the added behavioral content of that situ-\nation. And then this behavioral content only acquires behav-\nioral implementation when the cultural model is realized as\nthe model on which each players' actions or acted-on inter-\npretations are based.\nConsequently, there is never a perfect fit between cultural\nmodel and behavior. Cultural models that \"work\" must be\nabstract enough to deal with contingencies, yet concrete\nenough to direct behavior in patterned and predictable ways\nthat conform to the model. By practicing unsafe sex, Rose is\nattempting to fulfill the \"high energy\" aspect of romantic\nlove with Josh. She is not directly seeing her behavior in\nterms of a whole cultural model of romantic love, but she is\nspecifying a part of her \"model\" that is not being satisfied.\nShe further brings into her \"dynamic awareness\" another cul-\ntural model--marriage. She finds George to be a better fit for\nthe cultural model of marriage that she employs and, thus,\nmodifies or alters her cultural model of romantic love by\nblaming herself, rather than Josh, for her inability to find\npassion (or good, high energy feelings) in her relationship\nwith Josh. This compromise allows for the possibility of\nmarrying Josh while not fulfilling her \"holistic\" cultural\nmodel of romantic love. \"Holistic\" is in quotes, because she\nis unable to mentally see the whole model but her actions\nindicate that high energy, good feelings are important to her,\nso we can reasonably conclude that the cultural model of\nromantic love we have posited is one that Rose employs.\nFourth interview data (9 months after the third interview)\nVdM: The world is dying to know about you and Josh.\nR:\nJosh and I are over; I haven't talked to him in 2\nmonths. During the summer I was in X (note: X,\nY, and Z are names of universities) and he was in\nY; we didn't speak to each other too much and\nwe were just growing farther and farther apart.\nSenior year came and he was in Z. We started\ntalking . . . once a week . . . there was nothing\nthere and we decided that we couldn't commit,\nand we just would try to date other people, but of\ncourse he said that he didn't, I said I wasn't but I\nwas and then I went to Cancun in March. When I\ncame back I told him I had kissed someone in\nCancun, he got really mad at me. We had talked\nabout trying to work things out after graduation,\nbecause we would have more time to commit to\neach other, to see if that's what we really wanted.\nHe got really angry with me and I said I told you\nthat I can't commit to you right now, I don't think\nit's fair that you did. He kept saying that I was the\none for him but I said \"you can't form an opinion\nunless you have something to compare it to,\"\nbecause he hasn't had any other girlfriends. He\ntold me that he had cheated on me and had rela-\ntionships with other people . . . the whole time\nwhen he was acting like a perfect person . . . like\nhe had never done anything wrong . . . was\nalways faithful and never cheated on me.\nMeanwhile, I was always the bad one trying to\ntell him the truth and finally he just breaks it to\nme all at once. I wasn't mad at him for cheating\non me because I would be hypocritical if I did,\ncause I was doing the same thing but I was trying\nto be honest about it and so it was awful. That\nended things right there.\nVdM: It was awful?\nR:\nHe was the one person I thought I could trust.\nVdM: What do you mean the one person?\nR:\nHe was the one person that stuck by me, I am not\nsaying that I was a great person to him but he\nalways stuck by me. I just thought it was uncon-\nditional and I could trust him with anything and\nhe would never hurt me intentionally, and he did\n. . . not intentionally; but I thought for sure that\nhe would feel bad enough that if he did do that he\nwould tell me right away. I just had it all wrong.\nHe thought that he could get away with it.\nVdM:\nAnd you found out over the phone?\nR: Yes.\nLater during this interview, Rose said,\nI was planning on breaking up with Josh and I almost instigated\nit telling him that I kissed someone in Cancun. I am always\ntrying to instigate a fight so he would break up with me because\nI didn't have the courage to break up with him. I was giving him\nenough reasons to be like \"forget it Rose.\" He never would do\nthat.\nAssessment of proposed cultural model. The first author never\ninterviewed Josh (nor George) so we cannot make suppositions\nconcerning the motivations for their actions or their feelings.\nRose had built up a strong model, supported by scenarios of\ntrust and Josh's commitment and faithfulness to her. She had\nbeen the \"bad one\" and Josh the \"good one\" and this had played\na significant role in her decision to break up with George and\nstay with Josh and also her decision to experiment with unpro-\ntected sex as a way of increasing passion and excitement. In\nan earlier interview, she had discussed with her mom how her\nrelationship with Josh lacked passion and she was interested\nin meeting other males. Rose said, \"My mom knows how I\nfeel and she thinks I should meet other people but she thinks\nI should marry him [i.e., Josh].\" After the break up with Josh,\nshe had considered telling her parents but decided against it for\nnow because \"My mom loves Josh, she thinks he is perfect.\"\nThis and earlier discussions on peer pressure suggest that part\nof the \"directive force\" of a cultural model is peer and fam-\nily pressure. This is hardly surprising. However, in this case, it\nreinforced Rose's own assessments of Josh as having all sorts\nof personal virtues that she might not \"find again.\" Despite this\n\"rose-colored\" view of Josh, she was, at least by what she said,\nnot as angry or upset as one might expect when she found out\nhe had lied and cheated on her all along. Instead, she expressed\nrelief that the relationship ended. We suggest that had her rela-\ntionship met the complete model of a successful romantic love\nrelationship (including, in this case, high energy aspects of\npassion and excitement in life), she would probably have been\ndevastated by Josh's confession--and it is not likely that she\nwould have kissed someone when on holiday in Cancun (or if\nshe had, she would not have told him). Our proposed, develop-\ning cultural model of romantic love serves us well in providing\na framework and story line by which to understand and predict\nRose's motives, feelings, and actions.\nCase Study 2: Darryl\nAt the time of the first interview, Darryl was 42; he had been\ndivorced for 2 years and had had full custody of his\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 11\n9-year-old son, Rich, since he was 2 years old. According to\nDarryl, his ex-wife has substance-abuse problems and was,\nconsequently, in and out of both jail and mental institutions.\nHe made his living as an electrician, construction worker, and\ngeneral handyman in a rural area of New England. He was\ndevoted to his son and made a reasonable but certainly not\nextravagant income. During the four interviews, we focused\non both his ex-wife and his current \"girlfriend\" Hannah. For\npurposes of space, we will only focus on material related to\nhis present relationship. He, apparently, rarely saw or heard\nfrom his ex-wife.\nFirst interview on Darryl's philosophy of romantic love.Darryl\nbegan by noting that when he was younger, he would pursue\nany woman he had a \"romantic interest in.\"\nD:\nToday I see lots of issues like caring, honesty,\ntrust and understanding as attributes that I would\nlook for and that's not to say that I couldn't meet\nsomeone and fall in love . . . that's not what I am\nsaying but I think it's difficult to find out if some-\none has all those characteristics before you nec-\nessarily fall in love with them . . . I mean I'm\ninvolved with a lady now . . . I love a lot of things\nabout her, she's very understanding, she's very\nsharing, there's a lot of compromise and every-\nthing. There's a lot of things I love about her but\nI don't think I am in love with her. It's kind of\nhard to explain I guess. I love a lot of things about\nher as a human being, there are a lot of things I\nlove about her . . . but I just don't feel this strong\npull inwardly. I mean I can just tell inwardly that\nit's probably not what she wants it to be . . . so I\nkind of . . . I told her that that I love her in a lot of\nways but I don't love her in the ways that she\nexpects me to . . . I am not in love with her.\nBasically she has all these attributes but there's\nthis additional thing this feeling that I have inside\nthat I think has to be there which is not there.\nVdM:\nWhat is that feeling, is it something that one can\ndescribe?\nD:\nI'm not sure . . . if it's biological or just me over\nthe years . . . that my ideas have changed, and I\nam not exactly sure how to describe it. I thought\na lot . . . of the way people change. I know I\nchange when I get into a relationship especially\nwhen I have abstained from a relationship for a\nlong time . . . which I have done . . . and suddenly\nI feel more energetic, more alive . . . but there's\nsomething more, some substance more I think it's\nboth physical and mental--I think there's some-\nthing that goes on mentally that makes you feel\nhigh but also physically you just feel more\nempowered I guess. It makes you feel stronger as\nan individual.\nAssessment of proposed model. Darryl begins with terms\nthat imply \"mutuality\" and the negotiation of power and care\nwithin a relationship: \"understanding,\" \"sharing,\" \"compro-\nmise.\" He observes that his cultural model has changed over\ntime, earlier it was more of a \"ludus\" type model where love\nand sex were inosculated with one another. He distinguishes\nbetween a companionate and passionate model and, like for\nRose, something is missing; but unlike for Rose, it is more\nineffable and is not necessarily \"passion.\" As he attempts to\ndescribe it, it begins to sound more like a sports energy drink;\nit makes one high, gives one energy both physically and men-\ntally. Thus, this seems to refer to a general good feeling, high\nenergy state that is triggered by \"being together\" with the\nother qualities--mutuality and caring, honesty--that make\nfor a successful relationship but are subsequent to and not an\ninherent aspect of romantic love. Yet, without these qualities,\nromantic love is transitory, as reflected in his discussion of\nhis wife with whom he was in love but could not live with.\nHis romantic love model focuses on the high energy features\nand a sense of personal transformation (i.e., romantic love\n\"makes you stronger as an individual\") that occurs when one\nis with the beloved. In these statements, Darryl appears to\nbe using a Platonic model, of the kind reflected in the work\nryl, romantic love is a transcendental state that you achieve.\nTwo individuals are less than the whole, by \"achieving\"\nrequited, mutual love, the two become a whole--the love\ncouple. Furthermore, when you achieve this state, you are\ngranted increased energy and confidence. This conception of\nromantic love as a transcendental state is, it seems, virtu-\nally identical to Rose's conception, whose focus is on fix-\ning what is lacking--that is, passion. However, unlike Rose,\nDarryl assesses and views his conception (or cultural model)\nof romantic love in terms of its impact on what is for him\nhis more important role as father. Thus, when he talks about\nhow his ideas of romantic love have changed, he does not\ndirectly note that these changes are not just a function of age,\nbut what came with his aging--a son. Like Rose, he also\nfeels that individuals can intentionally engineer their court-\nship relationship to fix what is lacking.\nVdM: Can being in love be cultivated?\nD:\nYeah I think it can. Like this relationship I am in\nnow . . . it doesn't necessarily mean I couldn't fall\nin love with her tomorrow . . . but I feel there is\nsomething missing in me . . . I think you can defi-\nnitely grow into it . . . especially if you have a lot\nof good feelings . . . like I said I have a lot of good\nfeelings towards this lady.\nHe had been dating Hannah, whom he referred to through all\nof the first interview and most of the subsequent ones as\n\"lady,\" for approximately 2 months at the time of the first\ninterview. He explains,\nShe was very disturbed when I said I didn't [love her] . . . she\nsaid she just figured that I did. And I said \"well you know . . . we\nnever discussed it\" . . . well I have a son, so that kind of comes\ninto play too.\nShe said,\n\"how are you going to explain to your son if he asks you\nquestions about why I am sleeping over and why all of a sudden\nis there a woman sleeping in your bed with you?\" . . . He's never\nknown any woman that's slept in my bed . . . I mean he knows\nhis mother but she left when he was 2.\nAssessment of proposed cultural model.Just as Rose did,\nDarryl first blames himself for not being \"in love\" with Han-\nnah: \"Something is missing in me.\" Furthermore, like Josh,\nHannah is described as having lots of good attributes that\nfrequently are identified with love but they do not catalyze\nDarryl to fall in love with Hannah (as not Rose with Josh).\nHanna professes to be \"in love\" with Darryl, but while appar-\nently motivated to reciprocate, he is unable to do so, because,\nin part, of the lack of attributes identified with the \"good\"\nfeelings, high energy zone. His role as a father has an impact\non his cultural model; at least, Hannah (as he tells it) seems\nto think so. She seems to create a cultural scenario where if\nthere is a child in the house and a woman sleeps with a man\nregularly, the group is a family and by implication the father\nqua husband loves his wife (as she does him). However, by\npromoting this cultural model of family, she seems to have\noverstepped her bounds and used the wrong strategy, for to\nput herself in that position she, by implication, must also\nbe \"like a mother\" to Darryl's son. However, her actions do\nseem to lead to Darryl modifying his initial causal model of\nromantic love relationships. Whereas he had indicated that\n\"falling in love\" precedes finding out about the quality of the\nrelationship and virtues of the beloved, he now clearly argues\nthat one can \"grow\" into love when the other person exhib-\nits all those good traits (mainly low energy, positive values,\ncharacteristics, and behaviors). It further seems that this\nswitch was spurred by recognizing that Hannah's scenario is\nalso one that his son employs since \"he's never known any\nwoman that's slept in my bed . . .\"\nWith confidence, we can see that both Darryl and Rose\nconsider romantic love not just a feeling but something that\ncan be intentionally cultivated and modified. For Rose, the\ncultivation refers primarily to the psychological domain of\nher own desire to feel passion and be engaged in a love rela-\ntionship that kindles passion. For Darryl, the cultural model\nof romantic love needs to be modified so it articulates with\nhis role as father and that he has control of the relationship.\nThus, Hannah's demands, her agency if you will, is a threat\nto his autonomy in the relationship because his relationship\nwith his son has priority. For him, the quality that is lacking\nis in a rough way a positive articulation of both relationships\nin which the cultural model of the love relationship as posed\nby Hannah complements rather than threatens the cultural\nmodels that form his relationship with his son, including, as\nHannah alludes to, the dual role of lover and (step)mother to\nhis son.\nInterview 2 (2 weeks later; the woman had been over both\nweekends). Hannah was 38 years old, divorced, and without\nchildren. Hannah's father had given her a TV and she had\nasked Darryl if he wanted one and he went to pick it up when\nshe was not at home. That night, she phoned him. Darryl tells\nthe story.\nD:\nShe said, \"I just wanted to call up and report a hit\nand run and the theft of a television,\" and she\nlaughed and I laughed too; and we talked.\nVdM: Did it scare you?\nD:\n[Slight hesitation] . . . No because I knew she\nwas kidding. . . . So we got to talking and she\nsaid, \"well did you talk to your son?\" and I said,\n\"I didn't tell him that we fell in love.\" And she\nsaid, \"well you should explain to him that you\njust don't sleep with someone that there should\nbe love there before you do that.\" And I said,\n\"well I think you should definitely have strong\nfeelings.\" And I was . . . once again she was\nthrowing \"love\" out very swiftly and easily and\nso in trying to discuss it I told her that I liked her\na lot and . . . and I liked everything about her and\nI think that was the offensive thing . . . that I\nwouldn't change that word \"like\" or \"care\" to\n\"love\" and she became very upset and [when]\nwe ended the conversation that night she\nwouldn't talk or respond to any questions or any-\nthing I said; so I said, \"well why don't I call you\ntomorrow night?\" So the next day, that night I\nwent home and I called her and I had thought\nabout it a lot during the day . . . and I told her that\nI realize that I was just afraid of the word love\n. . . and that my definition was not the same as\nyour definition . . . and before that I said, \"and I\nrealize that I was wrong I can't say I love you, I\ncan say `I love your eyes,' `I love your face' and\n`I love your mind' and `I love your humor' and I\ncan say all those things but it's still not evoking\nthe feeling that I think love is. And `I am sorry\nthat you are hurt but it was never my intention to\nhurt you.'\" Then I reminded her of the conversa-\ntion we had when we first got together and I was\nlying on one side of the bed and she was lying on\nthe other and you know \"you said you were lone-\nsome\" and we went through the conversation\nagain and she said, \"well maybe it's both our\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 13\nfears it's my fear of being rejected, [\"she didn't\nsay rejection but something like that,\" Darryl's\naside] . . . and your fear of trusting someone.\"\nAnd then she said, \"you can trust me.\" And . . .\nand . . . so I explained to her, \"I don't feel that\nI'm in love with you, that's not saying that I\ncouldn't grow to love you or fall in love with you\ntomorrow but I am not making that commitment\nright now.\" And she and I . . . she still seemed to\nbe upset and she called me the next day and she\nindicated that she was okay with it now, that it\ndidn't bother her and this weekend she came\nover.\nVdM: Did you have a good time?\nD:\nYeah, I mean it seemed like . . . that it was a little\neasier . . . that we both knew where we stood.\nShe indicated . . . she did say something this\nweekend that she still wasn't sure about my not\nbeing able to say that I was in love with her but\nthat she was willing to take the fact that I love all\nthese things about her in the meantime and hope\nthat it grew into something . . .\nVdM: Does she love you?\nD:\nYes. Well and I mean it's hard and I told her\nmaybe you should sleep in your bed, the other\nbed, and I'll sleep in here, because, I told her, I\ndon't want . . . if this doesn't work out . . . I don't\nwant you to feel that you are just a sexual outlet\nfor me . . . so I mean that way, this way, maybe\nwe should pull apart that much at least . . . if you\nare concerned about it, then let's abstain from the\nsexual part of this until I . . . you know . . . until\nwe see what happens . . . I mean if I . . . if I'm not\ngoing to fall in love with you and if that's going\nto upset you then maybe you don't want to have\na sexual relationship with me.\nVdM: What did she say.\nD:\nI'll think about it . . . I'll have to think about it\n. . . this was during the day and by night she said\nthat she wanted to sleep in the same bed as me\nand so . . . we had sex all night . . . [laughs] every\nopportunity we had.\nAssessment of proposed model. Her gift of a television is\nreminiscent of the high frequency \"gift\" received in the freel-\nist.Also H. Fisher (1992), discussing the importance and uni-\nversality of gift giving as part of the courtship process, wryly\nnoted that even male flies give small pieces of carcasses to\nfemale flies as a prelude to mating. Gifts of course as Marcel\nMauss pointed out are rarely if ever \"free\" and usually entail\nreciprocity; thus, the giver implicitly ensnares the giftee in\na web of obligations. F. G. Bailey (1971) also noted that the\nGerman etymology of gift (gif) refers to either \"gift\" or \"poi-\nson\" and suggested that this double meaning (\u00e0 la Mauss)\ninheres to gift giving. Hence, Hannah's remark of a \"Hit\nand run . . . theft,\" although overtly intended to be humor-\nous, covertly suggested that she and Darryl were connected\nthrough a series of obligations and counter-obligations that\nsuggest in its pure sense \"family\" and in its poisoned sense\n\"obligatory service.\"\nFurthermore, unlike Josh, and perhaps biased by the lens\nof Darryl's narrative, Hannah seems to be the pursuer in this\nrelationship with Darryl retreating, hesitating, and demarcat-\ning his son and himself as the family group, independent of\nHannah. These separate cultural models (of family life and\nobligations) serve as directive forces that impact Darryl's\ncultural model of love. Both, Darryl and Hannah seem to\nagree that, at their age and in Darryl's situation of an \"incom-\nplete prototypical family,\" romantic love when mutual entails\nboth marriage or cohabitation at the very least, and Hannah's\nadopting, to some extent, the role of \"mother\" to Darryl's\nson. If we ignore these complicating features, we ignore the\n\"morass of contextuality\" within which cultural models are\napplied, necessarily adapting to a mental environment that\ninvolves other cultural models distributed with more or less\ncoherence, centrality or salience, and directive, motivational\nforce.\nDarryl discusses how after the gift, Hannah begins to\n\"throw\" the word \"love\" around very \"swiftly and easily.\" In\nhis narrative of his discussion with her, he attempts to distin-\nguish between like and love, noting that he loves many things\nabout her but is not \"in love.\" He, like Rose, and as before,\nblames himself, explaining to Hannah on the phone that he\nwas \"just afraid of the word love.\" Hannah brings up their\nmutual fears, she of \"being alone\" and \"rejection,\" he of \"trust-\ning,\" as, in a way, cultural models that inhibit the expression or\nfulfillment of the cultural model of romantic love and family,\nas she sees it. Both Darryl and Hannah see love and family (by\nthis meaning living together and being a family or like a fam-\nily) as joined or inosculated cultural models with the one\n(love) inevitably leading to the other. He makes clear that his\nfeelings for her are distinct from another cultural model that is\nproximate to romantic love, that of sex and particularly of\nmales as using women as \"sexual outlets.\" His feelings are\nmore than that. He unambiguously means by this he has strong\naffectionate feelings for Hannah, which can be ambiguously\ninterpreted as moving toward romantic love (which Darryl has\nsaid can \"grow\") or just settling into a state of \"companionate\"\nlove or \"like.\" Some of the attributes of companionate love\nand liking overlap with our proposed cultural model of roman-\ntic love but do not comprise it. Perhaps Hannah initiates sex\nthat evening (this is more conjectural) because it is a try for the\npassion that is important for love--her desire for Darryl to\nwant and need her in his life in the way that he asserts to be\nlacking. However, here there is another ambiguity at play, as\nHannah has made it clear that sex implies love, particularly\nwhen there is a child in the house, while Darryl has made it\nclear that sex is sex and can exist as its own cultural model\nindependent from the cultural model of romantic love. Hence,\nthere is room for ambiguity and contestation between the users\nof similar cultural models within our theory of cultural\nmodels.\nInterview 3. About 2 months after the second interview, Dar-\nryl had been seeing Hannah for some time and decided that\nhe would tell his son about his \"strong feelings\" for her.\nD:\nWell my son was kind of disturbed; on the week-\nends he sleeps in my bed as a . . . what he calls \"a\nspecial treat.\" We started this when he was very\nyoung. . . . However, he's 9 now and he should be\nmoving into his own bed anyway and of course\nthis brings up feelings of jealousy and daddy\nloves her more than he loves me.And I explain to\nhim that I love him just as much as I ever did.\nVdM: Did he want to sleep with you.\nD:\nOh he definitely wanted to sleep with me but I\nsaid that well Hannah's going to be sleeping in\nthere. And he said, \"I don't care I'm sleeping in\nthe middle\" and every opportunity he got when-\never we could get close to each other he would\nget right between us . . . so he was feeling threat-\nened. And I indicated to her that, that you know .\n. . that she needed to also understand his needs\nand that he was feeling threatened and that she\nneeded to make him feel comfortable by giving\nhim a hug.\nVdM: Oh she wasn't doing that?\nD:\nNo, no, in fact there was one occasion where . . .\nshe's always been pleasant to him . . . but there\nwas this one occasion where she was standing in\nfront of me and he came into the room and he\nimmediately got between us and he put his arms\naround me and he was hugging me and she put\nher arms like over his shoulder and reached\nanother hand under his shirt and pinched his\nchest and immediately tears came to his eyes and\nhe went \"ohh\" and leaned over . . . and I was just\nhugging I didn't know what the problem was. He\nslipped out between the two of us and he was\nkind of crying . . . so I asked him what the prob-\nlem was and she walked into the other room, into\nthe kitchen, and I asked him well what's the\nproblem, and so then he said, \"she pinched me\nreally hard and it hurt.\" . . . When I confronted\nher, \"oh did I hurt him I didn't mean to, I didn't\nrealize that it had hurt him I just gave him a little\nfriendly pinch.\" I don't know I was thinking well\ndo I say . . . you know . . . reasonable doubt . . .\nmaybe she didn't really think she was hurting or\nmaybe it was intentional on her part maybe she\nwas feeling threatened that . . . and that didn't do\nanything for my feeling any closer . . . this past\nweekend she was very friendly to him and he\nwas very friendly to her. . . . he's never . . . I don't\nthink it's been an issue . . . a lot of times the\nwomen that I have met and gone home with are\nfrom school that are younger and as soon as they\nsee him and what a responsibility he is they usu-\nally run the other way . . .\nAssessment of proposed cultural model.In a situation in\nwhich alternative cultural models can be applied (instanti-\nated), members of the culture choose which to foreground--\neven if there may exist cultural defaults concerning how to\nrank and prioritize them. Darryl's role as father trumps his role\nas lover to Hannah. Hannah's attempt to become a full mem-\nber of the family meets with active resistance from Rich (the\nson) as well as passive resistance from Darryl. This is clear\nwhen Rich tearfully tells his father how Hannah pinched him\nunder his shirt and that it \"hurt\" him. Darryl, after discuss-\ning the incident with Hannah, took a neutral position, stat-\ning \"reasonable doubt.\" Thereafter, after perhaps boundaries\nhad been established, Rich and Hannah were friendlier with\neach other. He added that other (younger) women who had\ncome over and met Rich decided they were not interested in\ndeveloping a relationship with Darryl. Thus, Darryl's rather\npassive behavior, conciliatory, and affectionate responses to\nHannah suggest that he also recognizes that while he may not\nbe \"in love\" with her, she might represent the best possibility\nfor a woman to become part of his family as she has all sorts\nof personal virtues. It seems then that he is, given his situ-\nation as an older, relatively poor male with a son, also cal-\nculating the probability of achieving the prototypical family\nimage--that is, with Hannah as wife and mother--and that\nthis model becomes as salient in its \"motivational\" force as\nthe romantic love model. Roy D'Andrade (1992) stated that\nthe \"marriage model\" is nested in the romantic love model\nbecause a person will say \"I married because I am in love\nwith X,\" but to say \"I am in love with X because I married X\"\ndoes not (in our culture) make sense. Thus, for D'Andrade,\n\"love\" is the master motive and \"marriage\" the basic-level\nmotive. But that is taking these two as logical and isolated\nconcepts not as contextualized \"thought-feeling\" complexes\nas Claudia Strauss (1992) described cultural models.\nIn the fourth interview, 9 months later, Darryl said that he\nand Hannah were making arrangements for her to move in\nofficially, as she was staying at his house frequently. He was\nstill not \"in love\" with her but had decided that he loved her,\nand his son had grown to love her, too. Thus, apparently, over\ntime, the conflicts between Hannah and Rich were resolved\nand, as he repeated, they \"were no longer an issue.\"\nConclusion\nThe two case studies we have presented show that the pro-\nposed cultural model of romantic love provides insight and\nhas some predictive strength. We have proposed that the key\nattribute field categorizations for a U.S. cultural model of\nromantic love are: high and low energy associated with good\nde Munck and Kronenfeld 15\nfeelings (e.g., excited, passion, comfortable, content), a men-\ntal ledger indexing mutuality (in commitment, altruism,\ntrust), and personal virtues (e.g., honest, intelligent, humor).\nWe do not offer a cultural model comprised of three or so\nstyles or traits as do most love researchers, but view our pro-\nposed cultural model as a flexible, generic set of normative\nscenarios that people see as exemplifying romantic love and\ntriggered at specific times or in given situations. Such catego-\nrizations are informants' culturally standard attribution of\nattributes to the cultural model's story--attributes that can be\nused by informants to index the cultural model, especially\nwhere the cultural model is used as a reference standard. For\ninstance, if one's lover is suddenly leaving for a long trip, one\nmay for reassurance index mutual ideas and feelings of com-\nmitment and trust, and also various personal virtues such as\nhonesty. A cultural model must be \"thin\" enough to encom-\npass many different situations, phases of a relationship, and\nfeelings; yet it must not be so thin that it is too abstract and\ngeneral for specific uses. Our cultural model approach meets\nthis \"just right\" criteria. Further work will allow for a greater\nfleshing out of the types of unmarked normative stories\nindexed by our cultural model.\nWe think that the freelist and pile sort material and the\nsample used (plus its fit with many other studies cited) pro-\nvide strong evidence that the proposed cultural model of\nromantic love is one held by some (even if it is not yet clear\nhow many) North Americans. Much more work will need to\nbe done to determine the reach and use of this cultural model.\nThis is a test run of our theory. There are some issues we\nneed to address in the future. First, we need to repeat the\nbasic methodology with different samples to evaluate the\nvalidity, reliability, and reach of our proposed cultural model\nand also to discover if there are other prototypical models.\nFor reliability testing, we would need to gather samples in\nother areas of North America and see if through the same\nprocedures of freelisting and pile sorting, we would come up\nwith substantially the same cultural model. For testing the\nexternal validity of our proposed model, we have predicted\nthat those who meet the criteria for a satisfying love relation-\nship according to our model would also report being satisfied\nwith their love relationship. Those, like Rose, who feel some\narea of the cultural model for a good love relationship is\nlacking--such as passion or mutuality--would mention this\ndissatisfaction in interviews or surveys and probably attempt\nto resolve this dissatisfaction.\nWe need to develop the field/dimension concept (i.e., good-\nbad/low-high energy) a bit more to recognize how it relates to\nthe actual cultural model scenario, how the fields \"fit\" together,\nand whether they vary in salience across individuals, contexts,\ngender, personality types, the life cycle, and so on. Third, we\nperhaps need to be more attentive to the distinction between\nthe continuum of dimensions and the respective parts (or fields\nand attributes) and the holistic conception of romantic love\nexpressed particularly by Darryl. We need to further explore\nthe relations among these parts and conceptions--and to\nconsider how elements, which in the basic story form are part\nof a seamless assemblage, can emerge as distinct entities in\ntasks such as freelists of relevant attributes or in situations\nwhere one is clearly \"missing in action.\" Fourth, we need to\nconsider both logically derived and actual variant models of\nthe prototypical model we have proposed and the conditions\nand processes through which such variants are developed.\nFifth, we need to elicit a wide variety of scenarios to develop\nunmarked scenarios that are associated with the fields and\nattributes we have proposed. Sixth, we also need to consider\nthe flexibility of cultural models as they compete with con-\ntrasting models of either the same situation (e.g., other models\nof romantic love) or different situations (e.g., romantic love vs.\nparenting), and to discover a means to determine which mod-\nels are likely to contrast with which other models and under\nwhat conditions.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, we do believe that the\nwork we have done provides a kind of recipe for constructing\nand analyzing cultural models. Undoubtedly, there are many\nother ways to do this; however, we consider the theoretical\nand methodological guidelines proposed serve as a \"good\nrecipe\" that we hope others will decide to employ in their\nown research.\nAuthors' Note\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at\nState University of New York (SUNY), New Paltz.\n"
