Pickering8\nBackground\nDepression has been found to predict the incidence of hypertension\nand other adverse cardiovascular events in prospective studies.\nInsomnia and short sleep duration, which are typical symptoms\nof depression, have also been shown to increase the risk for\nhypertension incidence. Insomnia is associated with increased\nactivation of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis, and short\nsleep duration raises average 24-h blood pressure, which over time\ncould lead to structural adaptations that gradually reset the entire\ncardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium.\nNo previous published population studies have examined whether\ninsomnia and sleep duration mediate the relationship between\ndepression and hypertension incidence.\nMethods\nbyageoftheFirstNationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey\n(NHANESI)(n=4,913)usingCoxproportionalhazardsmodels.\nResults\nMiddle-aged subjects who suffered from depression at baseline\nwere 44% more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension over\nthe follow-up period after controlling for covariates (hazard ratio\nsleep duration and insomnia were also significantly associated\nwith hypertension incidence.

Despite known connec-\ntions between sleep parameters and hypertension, no previous\nepidemiological studies have explored whether sleep duration\nand insomnia act as mediators in the relationship between\ndepression and hypertension.\nKnowledge of whether there are mediating effects of sleep\nduration and insomnia on the relationship between depres-\nsion and hypertension could lead to the development of\ninterventions to decrease the excess cardiovascular morbid-\nity and mortality associated with depression. In this study, we\nexplored the relationship between depression and hyperten-\nin the Epidemiologic Follow-up Studies of the First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I).25\nMethods\nParticipants. Subjects for this study were participants in the\nNHANES I.25 The baseline measures of depression, sleep dura-\nsurvey, and then hypertension incidence was determined until\n1992. The NHANES I survey was a probability sample of the\ncivilian noninstitutionalized US population between 1971 and\n25 and 74 at baseline were successfully traced and interviewed\nsurvey (n = 5,192), who did not answer any of the depression\nquestions (n = 237), and who did not answer all of the sleep\nquestions (n = 181) were excluded from the analyses, yielding\na final sample size of 4,913 subjects. All subjects gave informed\nconsent. This study involved analyses of a publicly available\ndataset that did not include identifying information and, there-\nfore, met federal guidelines for exemption from review by an\ninstitutional review board.\nMeasures.Theprimarydependentvariableforthisstudywasthe\nwho had systolic blood pressure readings >140mmHg or\nsurvey or who had been diagnosed with hypertension at or\nsure readings were taken at the same sitting, and readings\nwere not taken if maximum inflation level was >160mmHg\nas specified by the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up\nProgram.26 Incident cases of hypertension were determined by\nself-report of physician diagnosis, by hospital diagnosis, or by\nsurveys.\nThe primary independent variable for this study was depres-\nsion. To measure the presence of depressive symptoms, we\nused the standard cutoff score of 16 out of a total possible score\nof 60 on the 20-question CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression Scale).27 Of the 89 subjects who reported\ntaking antidepressants, 44 had scores on the CES-D in the\nnondepressed range. We included subjects taking antidepres-\nsants in the depressed category.\nWe tested the hypothesis that baseline sleep duration and\ninsomnia would act as mediators of the relationship between\nthe independent variable of baseline depression and the\ndependent variable of hypertension incidence. The subject's\naverage sleep duration in hours was determined by their\nresponses to the question: \"How many hours of sleep do you\nusually get a night (or when you usually sleep)?\" We cat-\negorized the sleep duration variable (5, 6, 7\u00ad8, and 9h) as\nopposed to retaining it as a continuous variable because each\nadditional hour of sleep was not associated with the same\nchange in the dependent variable. Subjects were asked three\nquestions about how often they had trouble falling asleep, wak-\ning up during the night, and waking up too early and not being\nable to fall asleep again with responses including \"1 = never,\"\n\"2 = rarely,\" \"3 = sometimes,\" \"4 = often,\" and \"5 = almost\nTable 1 | (Continued)\nBaseline characteristics n\nDepression at baseline\nP value\nHypertension incidence over follow-up\nP value\nYes (%) No (%) Yes (%) No (%)\nBMI, body mass index.\naMean (s.d.).\noriginal contributions\nDepression and Hypertension Mediated by Sleep\nalways.\" We added the scores from the three questions to \ncreate\nan index of insomnia ranging from 3 to 15 with increasing\nscores being indicative of more severe insomnia.\nCovariates in our multivariate models included age (5-year\ninterval), sex, race/ethnicity (white or nonwhite including\nblack, Hispanic, Asian, and others), education (high school\ngraduate or <high school graduate), body weight (body mass\nper day), physical activity (6 = high, 5, 4, 3, and 2 = low), and\nTable 2| Relationships between baseline characteristics, sleep duration, and insomnia\nBaseline characteristics\nSleep duration in hours\nP value\nMean insomnia\nscore (mean (s.d.))

Missing values for covariates, which\nfor all covariates represented <1% of the total sample size, were\nimputed using mean and mode substitution.\nStatistical analyses. After preliminary univariate and bivariate\nanalyses, we used Cox proportional hazards models to exam-\nine the effect of depression on the risk of being diagnosed with\nhypertension over follow-up. The time duration to diagnosis\nwas determined from the baseline date to the first report of\nhypertension. The first adjusted model (Model 2) included\nmultiple covariates. To test whether sleep duration and insom-\nnia acted as mediators in the relationship between depression\nand hypertension incidence, we included these variables sepa-\nrately in Models 3 and 4, and then together in Model 5. The\nsignificance of individual coefficients was determined by the\n95% confidence limits for hazard ratios (HRs).\nWe theorized that the mediating effects of sleep duration and\ninsomnia on the relationship between depression and hyper-\ntension incidence would differ by age because age has been\nshown to act as an effect modifier in the relationship between\nsleep duration and hypertension incidence with associations\nin middle-aged subjects but not in elderly subjects.17 To test\nwhether there would be differences between middle-aged and\nelderly adults in the mediating effects of sleep duration and\ninsomnia, we divided the sample into two age-groups with\nthe ages of 32 and 59 years in one group and subjects who\nwere between the ages of 60 and 86 years in another group. We\ntested for interaction between depression and all covariates.\nThe NHANES I included weights to account for the complex\nsampling design and to allow approximations of the US popu-\nlation. We conducted both nonweighted analyses using SAS\nsoftware (SAS System for Windows, version 9.1; SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and weighted analyses using SUDAAN software\n(release 10.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC). We chose to present only the unweighted results\nfor four reasons. First, the unweighted results were generally\nconsistent with minimal effects of the complex survey design\non the main conclusions derived from the weighted estimates.\nSecond, our objective was not to provide national estimates,\nbut to look at the potential mediating effects of sleep dura-\ntion and insomnia on the relationship between depression and\nhypertension incidence. Third, our study's baseline measures\nso the weights created for baseline measures taken from the\nlost to follow-up between the two waves. Fourth, there have\nbeen differences of opinion regarding the appropriateness of\nusing the sample weights with the NHANES.28\nResults\nWe found sleep duration to act as an effect modifier in the\nrelationship between depression and hypertension incidence\nin middle-aged subjects (P = 0.05). In middle-aged subjects,\nthe presence of depression, and either short or long sleep dura-\ntion was associated with a higher incidence of hypertension\n(Figure 1). None of the interaction terms between \ndepression\nand the other covariates were significant. Tables 1 and 2 show\nthe results from bivariate analyses. Depression and hyperten-\nsion incidence were both associated with short and long sleep\ndurations, non-Caucasian race/ethnicity, low education, obes-\nity, diabetes, alcohol abstinence, physical inactivity, higher\ninsomnia scores, and higher pulse rate. Depression was also\nassociated with hypertension incidence, female sex, age 70,\nunderweight obese body weights, and increased cigarette\nsmoking, whereas hypertension incidence was also associ-\nated with age 80. Both short and long sleep durations were\nassociated with older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, low edu-\ncation, alcohol abstinence, and low physical activity. Short\nsleep duration was associated with overweight and obese body\nweights, diabetes, and increased cigarette smoking. Higher\ninsomnia scores were associated with increasing age, female\nsex, Caucasian ethnicity, low education, diabetes, alcohol\nabstinence, decreased cigarette smoking, and lower physical\nactivity.\nTable 3 shows the hazards ratios of being diagnosed with\nhypertension over follow-up. There were 663 total incident\ncases of hypertension over this period. The relationships\nbetween depression, sleep duration, insomnia, and hyperten-\nsion incidence differed between middle-aged and elderly sub-\njects. Among middle-aged subjects, those who suffered from\ndepression were significantly more likely (Model 1, HR = 1.65,\nnosed with hypertension over the follow-up period, and these\nresults were attenuated with the inclusion of the covariates in\nhypothesis that sleep duration and insomnia would act as\nmediators of the relationship between depression and hyper-\ntension incidence, the inclusion of sleep duration and insom-\nnia together in Model 5 appreciably attenuated the association\nance of the change attributable to insomnia.

We found significant asso-\nciations between the exposures of depression, insomnia, and\nsleep duration, and the outcome of hypertension incidence\nonly in middle-aged subjects and not in elderly subjects. There\nare a number of potential explanations for the different rela-\ntionships found in middle-aged and elderly subjects. First,\nshort sleep duration has been found to be more strongly asso-\nciated with hypertension incidence17 and obesity24 in middle-\naged subjects than in elderly subjects. Second, advanced age is\nassociated with changes in sleep architecture with increased\ndifficulties initiating and maintaining sleep,29 so differences in\nsleep parameters between depressed and nondepressed elderly\nsubjects would be less marked than for middle-aged subjects.\nThird, depression has been found in elderly subjects to be asso-\nciated with systolic hypotension30 and a lowering of systolic\nblood pressure over time.31 One recent cross-sectional study\nwith adult subjects (ages 18\u00ad65) found depression to be associ-\nated with lower systolic blood pressure and a lower prevalence\nof isolated systolic hypertension,32 but the authors did not test\nfor interaction by age or conduct analyses stratified by age,\nso it is likely that the associations they found were weighted\nby lower systolic blood pressures in elderly subjects suffering\nfrom depression. Combined systolic and diastolic hyperten-\nsion is common in middle-aged hypertensive patients, whereas\nisolated systolic hypertension accounts for over 60% of hyper-\ntension in elderly populations,33 so the lack of an association\nbetween depression and hypertension in elderly subjects in\nour study could be due to the specific influences of depression\non systolic blood pressure in elderly subjects.\nTable 3| Hazards ratios (95% CI) as computed with Cox proportional hazards models for hypertension incidence over the follow-up\nperiod by depression, sleep duration, and insomnia at baseline\n Sleep duration\n Sleep duration\n Sleep duration\nCI, confidence interval.\naModel 1, unadjusted. bModel 2, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body weight, diabetes, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, physical activity, and pulse rate. cModel\n3, adjusted for variables in Model 2 plus sleep duration. dModel 4, adjusted for variables in Model 2 plus insomnia. eModel 5, adjusted for variables in Model 2 plus sleep duration and\ninsomnia.\noriginal contributions Depression and Hypertension Mediated by Sleep\nMiddle-aged subjects who suffered from depression were\n65% more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension over the\nfollow-up period. Controlling for covariates partially attenu-\nated the relationship. The relationship was then further atten-\nuated after controlling for sleep duration, so the influence of\ndepression on hypertension incidence is likely to be related\nin part to the effects of sleep duration on blood pressure. Our\nfindings that both short and long sleep durations are associ-\nated with depression are consistent with the fact that insomnia\nand hypersomnia are symptoms of depression that can directly\naffect sleep duration. We found short, but not long, sleep dura-\ntion to be associated with hypertension incidence. Chronic\nshort sleep durations could result in prolonged exposure to\nraised 24-h blood pressure and heart rate that could entrain\nthe cardiovascular system to operate at a higher pressure\nequilibrium through structural adaptations, such as arterial\nand left ventricular hypertrophic remodeling.20 The relation-\nship between depression and hypertension incidence was also\nattenuated with the inclusion of insomnia in the multivari-\nate models, so insomnia could also be on the causal pathway\nbetween depression and hypertension. Insomnia could con-\ntribute toward hypertension through increased activation\nof the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis34 and through\nless pronounced nocturnal fall in systolic and diastolic blood\nShort sleep duration and insomnia are different, yet related\nentities. Insomnia entails dissatisfaction with the quality of\nsleep and an inability to sleep given adequate opportunity.\nInsomnia can result in short sleep duration, but individu-\nals with short sleep duration do not necessarily suffer from\ninsomnia. They may sleep less because they choose to do so\nor because they lack the opportunity to sleep. In the final mul-\ntivariate model that included both sleep duration and insom-\nnia, both short sleep duration and insomnia were significantly\nassociated with hypertension incidence. The hazards ratios for\nboth short sleep duration and insomnia were attenuated when\nthey were included together in the final multivariate model,\nindicating their influence upon one another's ability to affect\nhypertension incidence.\nAdjustment for sleep duration and insomnia reduced the\nstrength of the association between depression and hyperten-\nThe ability of covariates, such as body weight, diabetes, and\nphysical activity, to reduce the strength of the association\nbetween depression and hypertension incidence could also be\npartially attributable to the effects of sleep duration and insom-\nnia on these covariates. Sleep duration has been linked to dia-\nbetes and obesity in both experimental21,22 and epidemiologic\nstudies.23,24 Feeling tired from inadequate sleep could lessen\none's desire to engage in physical activity.\nAlthough the results from this study are consistent with the\nhypothesis that insomnia, and to a lesser extent sleep dura-\ntion, act as mediators of the relationship between depression\nand hypertension incidence, a number of limitations to these\nanalyses must be considered as well. Statistical analyses alone\ncannot distinguish between mediation and confounding, and\nalthough strong arguments can be made that sleep \ndisturbances\nrepresent a causal mechanism by which depression increases\nthe risk for hypertension incidence, it is possible that sleep dis-\nturbances are associated with some other unmeasured mecha-\nnisms. Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, have been shown\nto be associated with both depression and hypertension inci-\ndence, so the presence of these disorders could have played a\npart in our results. The NHANES I follow-up survey did not\ninclude questions on sleep disorders, but we would expect\nthat individuals with sleep apnea would be more likely to\nself-\nreport longer sleep durations because they are often una-\nware of their disrupted sleep patterns and require more sleep\nto compensate for poor sleep quality. The prevalence of sleep\napnea in patients with insomnia has been found to be only 6%\n(ref. 36), so it is unlikely that sleep apnea played a large role\nin our results. Another limitation of the study is the lack of\nrepeated measures of depression, sleep duration, and insom-\nnia over the follow-up period. Changes in these variables over\nfollow-up could have affected the results. Hypertension also\nfrequently goes undiagnosed, and we have no way of knowing\nwhether subjects suffering from depression, short sleep dura-\ntion, and insomnia were more or less likely than subjects with-\nout these conditions to seek or receive treatment, and therefore\nto be diagnosed with hypertension. Other limitations include\npossible bias arising from lost to follow-up and missing data\non baseline risk variables.\nThe results from this study are consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that insomnia and sleep duration play roles in the etiol-\nogy of hypertension in middle-aged individuals suffering\nfrom depression, suggesting that interventions that increase\nthe amount and improve the quality of sleep could potentially\nserve as treatments and as primary preventative measures for\nhypertension in these individuals. Behavioral interventions\ncould include assistance with implementing sleep hygiene\npractices and with modifying maladaptive sleep habits.\n"
