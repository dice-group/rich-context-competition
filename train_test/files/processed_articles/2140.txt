However, this\nhypothesis has not been tested in large-scale hand OA cohorts. Our study aimed to determine whether there is a\ncross-sectional relationship between serum leptin levels and hand OA in a population-based sample of US adults.\nMethod: We used the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a national cross-\nsectional population-based survey, to study the relationship between hand OA and serum leptin concentration. We\napplied previously established classification criteria for hand OA. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were excluded.\nPotential confounders included sex, body mass index, the presence of polyarticular OA, diabetes, and total\ncholesterol. We estimated unadjusted mean leptin concentration by hand OA status and by all confounders. We\nfurther developed a linear regression model to assess mean leptin levels, adjusted for appropriate confounders.\nResults: Of 2,477 subjects in the NHANES III sample that had a hand examination and did not have rheumatoid\narthritis, 1,056 (42.6%) had a leptin measurement and were included in the analysis. Subjects with and without\nleptin measurement had similar demographic characteristics.

As nonweight-bearing\njoints, the hand is a useful target for the study of non-\nmechanical risk factors for OA pathogenesis [2-10].\nObesity has been observed to have associations with\nOA development in nonweight-bearing joints as well as\nin weight-bearing joints [11-14]. Adipokine hormones\nsuch as leptin have long been thought to contribute to\nOA pathogenesis directly, independent of the mechani-\ntide, is predominantly produced in white adipose tissue\nand regulates food intake and energy expenditure.

How-\never, there have been few studies of nonweight-bearing\njoints - such as the hand joints - to examine nonmecha-\nnical risk factors for OA. Leptin was not associated with\nhand OA progression in a recent study of fewer than\n300 subjects [19]. To date, no study has examined the\ncross-sectional association between leptin and hand OA\nin a population-based sample. The objective of our\nstudy was to determine whether a cross-sectional rela-\ntionship exists between leptin and OA in a US popula-\ntion-based sample of adults at least 60 years of age.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy sample\nWe used data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a national\ncross-sectional population-based survey conducted from\nnon-institutionalized US population. Survey data, which\ninclude demographics, health status, health disorders,\nand behaviors among others, were collected by house-\nhold interviews. Physical examinations and blood draws\nwere also performed by physicians at mobile examina-\ntion centers. For this analysis we used data from the\ndemographic file [20], the examination file [21], and the\nserum leptin file [22]. Our analysis was restricted to\nor older because NHANES III conducted the hand\nexamination only on these subjects.\nNHANES III subjects were randomly assigned to be\ntested for leptin [22]. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis\nwere excluded from the analysis, based on clinical infor-\nmation collected at the physician interview, examination\nand criteria used by Dillon, Rasch and colleagues\n[23,24]. Institutional Review Board approval was not\nnecessary because the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey is a publically available database.\nData elements\nAssessment of hand osteoarthritis\nWe applied a previously developed algorithm for defin-\ning hand OA in the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey. Dillon and colleagues developed a\ndefinition of hand OA in the National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey database that is modeled on\nthe American College of Rheumatology definition [23].\nThe American College of Rheumatology criteria and the\nNHANES III definition differ slightly, as shown in Table\n1[23]. We defined asymptomatic hand OA as cases ful-\nfilling criteria 2 to 4 but not criterion 1. In the group\nwithout hand OA, subjects did not have symptoms or\nphysical examination evidence of hand OA. Hand radio-\ngraphs were not released from NHANES III for analysis.\nLeptin\nHuman studies have shown that leptin levels probably\npeak between 12 midnight and 2:30 am, and are lowest\nbetween noon and early afternoon [25]. In NHANES III,\nleptin was measured in the morning after an 8-hour\novernight fast. Leptin has been shown to remain stable\nwhen stored frozen for many years [26-29]. The labora-\ntory analysis for serum leptin was performed by Linco\nResearch, Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA) using a radioimmu-\nnoassay with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against highly\npurified recombinant human leptin. Detectable concen-\ntrations of the assay range from 0.5 to 100 fg/l. Within-\nassay and between-assay reliability coefficients of varia-\ntions range from 3.4 to 8.3% for radioimmunoassay and\nPotential confounders\nWe hypothesized that age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass\nindex (BMI), the presence of polyarticular OA, diabetes,\nand total cholesterol may confound the relationship\nbetween leptin and hand OA. We thus accounted for\nTable 1 Hand osteoarthritis classification criteria\nAmerican College of Rheumatology criteria Criteria for symptomatic hand OA using NHANES III data adapted from Dillon and\ncolleaguesa\nHand OA is identified if participants meet\nHand OA is identified if participants meet criteria 1 to 4:\n1.

The\nremaining analyses were performed on those with a\nhand examination and a leptin measurement. We cal-\nculated percentages by hand OA status for all potential\nconfounders. We estimated unadjusted mean leptin\nlevels by hand OA status and the other potential con-\nfounders stratified by sex. We stratified analyses of lep-\ntin by sex because the mean and variance of serum\nleptin concentration was much greater among females\nthan in males. We further applied linear regression to\nestimate the adjusted mean leptin by hand OA status\nstratified by sex. To fit the most parsimonious model,\nwe only included potential confounders in the final\nmodel if they reached statistical significance at an\nalpha level of 0.05. We used SAS statistical software\n(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina,\nU.S.A.) to perform all analyses. To account for the\ncomplex multistage survey design and to obtain esti-\nmates representative of the non-institutionalized US\npopulation, we used survey procedures within SAS and\nweighted the analyses using the appropriate survey\nsampling weight.\nResults\nOf the 2,589 subjects who had interviews and hand\nexaminations, examination data were complete in 2,498.\nNineteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis were\nexcluded.

Detailed data on the demo-\ngraphic and clinical characteristics of our sample strati-\nfied by hand OA status are shown in Table 2.\nUnadjusted mean leptin levels stratified by sex and all\npotential confounders are shown in Table 3. Among\nmales, the unadjusted mean leptin level did not vary\nsubstantially by hand OA status. Those with no hand\nOA had a mean leptin of 8.22 (95% confidence interval\nOA.

None of\nthese differences in adjusted mean leptin levels was sta-\ntistically significant (all P > 0.05).\nDiscussion\nThe present study used data from NHANES III to\ndescribe the cross-sectional relationship between leptin\nand hand OA. The study did not provide evidence to\nsupport the hypothesis that hand OA is associated with\nincreased serum leptin level. Stratified and multivariable\nanalyses did not show evidence of a difference in leptin\nlevels in the symptomatic hand OA, asymptomatic hand\nOA, and no hand OA groups. The multivariable\nanalyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI status, and\nthe presence of polyarticular OA as indicated by radio-\ngraphic knee OA, diabetes status, and serum cholesterol.\nOur analyses have several important strengths.\nNHANES III has a large sample size, making it unlikely\nthat we simply missed an effect due to chance. Also,\nselection bias is unlikely because the NHANES III sam-\nple was representative of the US population. Lastly,\nsince we accounted for the complex sample design and\nused the sampling weights, the estimates are representa-\ntive of the US population [22].\nThe study also has limitations. A possible explanation\nfor our null result is that the association between hand\nOA and leptin is complex and cannot be assessed using\na cross-sectional sample. Leptin may be associated with\nhand OA at one time point of its development only.\nHowever, in the longitudinal study carried out by Yusuf\nand colleagues, serum leptin was not found to be asso-\nciated with hand OA progression in 6-year follow-up of\n248 participants [19]. The paper by Yusuf and colleagues\nused a longitudinal design with a radiographic case defi-\nnition [19]. In the present cross-sectional study, we\nmeasured hand OA by an algorithm that incorporates\nsymptoms and physical examination. These two\napproaches are complementary, and neither supports an\nassociation between serum leptin and hand OA.\nAnother explanation for the null result is the possible\nmisclassification of hand OA in NHANES III. There is\nno gold standard for the diagnosis of hand OA. Our use\nof the classification criteria suggested by Dillon and col-\nleagues could have resulted in misclassification. Many\npatients with early or developing OA start with pain,\nfollowed by delayed onset of bony enlargement for\nmonths or years. Using our criteria, these subjects\nwould be categorized as having no OA. Misclassification\nof this sort would tend to bias associations toward the\nnull and could indeed play a role in our negative\nfindings.\nAs expected, our results confirmed that leptin is asso-\nciated with gender and BMI status, consistent with prior\nanimal and human studies [30-33]. These findings pro-\nvide face validity for the leptin measurements. Our\nstudy is the largest population-based confirmation of\nsuch a relationship in humans, with prior studies in the\nTable 2 Demographic characteristics of the sample by hand osteoarthritis status\nSymptomatic hand OA Asymptomatic hand OA No hand OA\nAge\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nBMI status\nRadiographic knee OA\nDiabetes\nTotal cholesterol\nData presented as n (%).
