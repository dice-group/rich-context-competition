This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal\nallograft survival after renal transplantation using meta-analysis.\nMethod: Eligible studies were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library on 1 November 2014, and eligible studies\nwere recruited and synthesized using a meta-analysis methodology.\nResults: Twelve investigations were included in this meta-analysis for the assessment of the relationship between the\nACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft survival. In this meta-analysis, the ACE I/D gene polymorphism was\nnot associated with renal allograft survival after renal transplantation for overall populations, Caucasians, Brazilians\nand Africans. Interestingly, the ACE D allele and DD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival after renal\ntransplantation in the Asian population.\nConclusions: ACE D allele and DD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival after renal transplantation in\nthe Asian population. However, more studies should be performed to confirm this association.\n",

Most of the epidemiologic\ninvestigations studying the relationship between the\nACE I/D gene polymorphism and the renal allograft sur-\nvival after renal transplantation were conducted in recent\ndecades. However, the available evidence is weak, due\nto the sparseness of data or disagreements among the\nreported studies. The evidence from meta-analysis might\nbe powerful compared with the individual investigation.\nWe performed this meta-analysis to investigate whether\nthe ACE I/D gene polymorphism is associated with renal\nallograft survival after renal transplantation.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy for the assessment of\nthe relationship between ACE I/D gene\npolymorphism and renal allograft survival\nThe relevant studies were searched from the electronic\ndatabases of PubMed, and Cochrane Library on 1\nNovember 2014. The retrieval strategy of `(renal allograft\nsurvival) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme) AND\n(polymorphism OR variant)' was entered into these data-\nbases. The additional reports were identified through refer-\nences cited in recruited articles.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria\n(1) The outcome had to be renal allograft survival.\n(2) There had to be at least two comparison groups\n(case group vs control group).\n(3) Investigation should provide the data of the ACE\nI/D genotype distribution.\nExclusion criteria\n(1) Review articles and editorials.\n(2) Case reports.\n(3) Preliminary result not on the ACE I/D gene poly-\nmorphism or outcome.\n(4) Investigating the role of ACE I/D gene expression\nin disease.\n(5) If multiple publications for the same data from the\nsame study group occurred, we only recruited the\nlater paper into our final analysis.\nData extraction and synthesis\nThe following information from each eligible investiga-\ntion was extracted independently by two investigators:\nfirst author's surname, year of publication, location of the\nstudy performed, control source of the control group and\nthe number of cases and controls for ACE I/D genotypes.\nThe results were compared and disagreement was resolved\nby discussion.\nStatistical analysis\nCochrane Review Manager Version 5 (Cochrane Library,\nUK) was used to calculate the available data from each\ninvestigation. The pooled statistics were counted using\nthe fixed effects model, but a random effects model was\nconducted when the P value of heterogeneity test was less\nthan 0.1.8,11 Results were expressed with odds ratios (OR)\nfor dichotomous data, and 95% confidence intervals (CI)\nwere also calculated.

There were 12 included stud-\nies for this meta-analysis. There might be no association\nbetween the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft\nsurvival in the overall population, although more eligible\nstudies should be conducted in the future to confirm it.\nFurthermore, there was also no association between the ACE\nI/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft survival in\nCaucasian, Brazilian or African populations. However, the\nnumber of included studies for the Brazilian andAfrican pop-\nulations was small, and more studies should be conducted to\nexplore this relationship. Interestingly, the ACE D allele and\nDD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival in\nthe Asian population, and there was no notable heterogeneity\namong the included studies, and a fixed effects model was\nconducted to calculate the pooled OR. However, the number\nof included studies for the Asian population was small. More\nstudies for the association between ACE I/D gene polymor-\nphism and renal allograft survival in the Asian population\nshould be performed in the future.\nThis meta-analysis was the first to study the relation-\nship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal\nallograft survival after renal transplantation. This investi-\ngation included 12 studies using meta-analysis and\nreported that the ACE D allele and DD genotype might\nbecome valuable indicators to predict renal allograft sur-\nvival in Asian populations. However, those results should\nFigure 3.
