    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This DataWatch examines the health insurance coverage of former\ndata from the 1997 National Survey of America's Families. Although the major-\nity of women who left welfare were working, only 33 percent of these women\nobtained health coverage through their jobs. Rates of uninsurance increase\nwith the number of months since leaving welfare and with declines in Medicaid\ncoverage. A year or more after leaving welfare, 49 percent of women and 30\npercent of children were uninsured.\nMajor changes took place in the nation's welfare sys-\ntem in the latter part of the 1990s. National welfare reform\nlegislation, the Personal Responsibility and Work Oppor-\ntunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, replaced Aid to\nFamilies with Dependent Children (AFDC) with a new federal\nblock grant program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami-\nlies (TANF). Prior to PRWORA, several states had already imple-\nmented major changes to their welfare systems under federal waiv-\ners. One intent of these welfare reform efforts was for persons who\nleave cash assistance to remain on Medicaid. The current downward\ntrend in both welfare and Medicaid caseloads, however, has in-\ncreased concern that many of those leaving welfare are being unin-\ntentionally and inappropriately dropped from Medicaid.1\nUsing nationally representative data from the 1997 National Sur-\nvey of America's Families (NSAF), this DataWatch examines the\nextent to which former welfare recipients maintain health insurance\ncoverage. The NSAF was conducted before states implemented\nPRWORA but during a period in which caseloads were already\nfalling rapidly, in part because of the strong economy and earlier\nwelfare changes under state waivers.

Since the Family Support Act of\n1988, states have been required to provide Transitional Medicaid\nAssistance (TMA) to families who left AFDC because of increased\nearnings. Under TMA former welfare recipients can retain Medicaid\nfor six months regardless of income, and for another six months if\ntheir income does not exceed 185 percent of poverty after disregards\nfor child care expenses.2\nPregnant women and children may be eligible for Medicaid\nthrough federal and state poverty-related provisions.3 In some states\nboth adults and children who are categorically eligible can qualify\nfor Medicaid through medically needy programs. Children and\nadults with qualifying disabilities may obtain Medicaid eligibility\nthrough Supplemental Security Income (SSI). With the delinking of\nMedicaid and cash assistance under PRWORA, states are required\nto provide Medicaid coverage to all families who meet the income\nand family structure guidelines that applied to the state's AFDC\nprogram 16 July 1996. States also now have great flexibility in ex-\npanding coverage beyond these thresholds.4\nBecause of these provisions, most former welfare recipients\nshould be eligible for Medicaid immediately after leaving welfare.\nMost families still have low incomes after leaving welfare, but the\nfew with relatively high incomes may be ineligible.5 Children are\nmore likely than adults are to retain eligibility after leaving welfare.\nWhile both children and adults can become eligible as medically\nneedy, children remain eligible through the poverty-related provi-\nsions, and the primary remaining path for adults is limited to TMA.6\nData And Methods\nThis study uses data from the 1997 NSAF, a household survey that\nprovides information on 100,000 children and adults representing\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian population under age sixty-five.\nThe NSAF sample was designed to provide both state-repre-\nsentative estimates in thirteen states (Alabama, California, Colo-\nrado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,\nNew Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin) and\nreliable national-level estimates. The survey oversampled families\nwith incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.7 The\noverall household response rate was approximately 70 percent.8\nIn families with children, the respondent was the adult who\nknew the most about the children's education and health care. The\nrespondent was asked whether she ever received AFDC in her name,\nor in the name of any of her children, since January 1995.

The\nsurvey also asked whether the family had ever stopped receiving\nAFDC payments for more than one month since January 1995.9\nFor this study, \"former welfare recipients\" (or \"welfare leavers\")\nrefers to women and children in families who stopped receiving\nAFDC at any point between January 1995 and the date of the inter-\nview in 1997 and were not currently receiving AFDC.10 Families who\nleft welfare since January 1995 but were receiving AFDC at the time\nof the interview are not included in our sample of welfare leavers.\nOther families may have left welfare, returned, and left again. The\nsurvey does not allow us to identify such families, but they are\nincluded in our sample. The survey asks the month and year the\nfamily last received an AFDC check, which is used to compute the\nnumber of months since the family last received AFDC. Some of the\nwomen welfare leavers received welfare not for themselves but on\nbehalf of their children. For brevity, however, we henceforth refer to\nwomen in families that left welfare simply as \"women who left\nwelfare.\"\nThe percentages we report below were weighted to produce esti-\nmates representative of the national population. The weights reflect\nthe design features of the sample, including the oversampling of\nlow-income households in the study states, and contain adjust-\nments for nonresponse and undercoverage. The reported numbers\nreflect the actual, rather than weighted, number of survey responses.\nVariance estimates were computed using a method that adjusts for\nthe survey's complex sample design.11\nResults\nn Insurance coverage of former welfare recipients. We identi-\nfied 1,004 women who left welfare at some point between January\n36 percent of these women reported receiving Medicaid; 23 percent\nobtained private/employer coverage; and a few (4 percent) were\ncovered under other forms of public health insurance (such as Medi-\ncare and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed\nServices, or CHAMPUS) (Exhibit 1). The net result is that 41 per-\ncent of women who had previously received welfare were uninsured\nin 1997. These insurance groups are not mutually exclusive, and,\naccordingly, the percentages do not add to 100 percent. Some\nwomen, for example, had both Medicaid and private coverage.12\nWe identified 1,662 children who formerly received welfare. Chil-\ndren were more likely than women were to have Medicaid coverage\nafter leaving welfare. Fifty percent of former child welfare recipients\nwere enrolled in Medicaid; 27 percent had private coverage; and 2\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nC O V E R A G E & W E L F A R E\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The net result was that 25 per-\ncent of children who previously received welfare were uninsured.\nn Insurance coverage by the number of months since leav-\ning welfare. Because eligibility for transitional Medicaid assistance\nelapses after twelve months, we should expect the Medicaid cover-\nage of former welfare recipients to fall with time after leaving the\nwelfare rolls. For women who left welfare less than six months ago,\nwe found that 56 percent kept Medicaid coverage (Exhibit 2).13 This\npercentage fell over time to 22 percent for those who left welfare\nmore than a year ago. Although the number receiving private/em-\nployer coverage rose over time, only 28 percent of women who left\nwelfare had private coverage one year after leaving. Because the\nincrease in employer coverage does not offset the declining rate of\nMedicaid participation, the percentage who are uninsured rises\nwith the time since leaving welfare. Forty-nine percent of women\nwere uninsured one year after leaving welfare.\nThe pattern for children is similar, but more children (70 percent)\nHealth Insurance Coverage Of Former Welfare Recipients, 1997\n= =\nMedicaid/state\nPrivate/employer\nMedicare/CHAMPUS/other\nUninsured\nSOURCE: 1997 National Survey of America's Families.\nNOTES: Columns do not add to 100 percent because some persons had multiple sources of health insurance coverage.\nCHAMPUS is Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services.\nHealth Insurance Coverage Of Former Welfare Recipients, By Number Of Months Since\nWomen\nLess than 6 months\nOne year or more\nDon't know/missing\nChildren\nLess than 6 months\nOne year or more\nDon't know/missing\nSOURCE: 1997 National Survey of America's Families.\nNOTES: Significance tests are in comparison with those who left welfare less than six months ago.

After one year 47 percent of chil-\ndren remained enrolled. Private/employer coverage increased from\n13 percent in the first six months to 29 percent after one year. The\npercentage of children who were uninsured after leaving welfare\nincreased with time, from 19 percent in the first six months to 29\npercent after one year; however, this difference is not significant.\nThe health insurance coverage pattern of those who were missing\nthe month's information appears most similar to the pattern of those\nwho left welfare more than a year ago.14\nn Insurance coverage and employment. For the remainder of\nthis DataWatch we use the full sample of former welfare recipients,\nregardless of the number of months since they left welfare. For\nformer welfare recipients, virtually all private coverage comes\nthrough a woman's own employment or her spouse's employment.15\nFifty-six percent of women reported having a job, but of these only\n33 percent had private/employer coverage (Exhibit 3).16 Women\nwho were not working were only slightly more likely than those\nwho were working to have Medicaid coverage.17 Those who were\nnot working also were less likely to have private/employer coverage,\nand most of the 11 percent who did were covered as a dependent\nthrough their spouse's employment.\nFor children, 47 percent were covered by Medicaid when their\ncaretaker was working. When their caretaker was not working, the\npercentage covered by Medicaid was slightly higher. Children were\nless likely to be covered by private/employer insurance when the\ncaretaker was not working than when the caretaker was working.\nHealth Insurance Coverage Of Former Welfare Recipients, By Employment Status,\nWomen\nHave a job/working\nNot in the workforce/\nunemployed\nChildrena\nHave a job/working\nNot in the workforce/\nunemployed\nSOURCE: 1997 National Survey of America's Families.\nNOTES: Significance tests are in comparison with \"have a job/working.\" We do not include Medicare/CHAMPUS/other in the\nexhibit because very few former welfare recipients received these forms of public health insurance coverage.\na Caretaker's employment status.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nC O V E R A G E & W E L F A R E\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

More than half of women\nwho leave welfare have incomes that put them below the federal\npoverty line (Exhibit 4). Only 12 percent have incomes in excess of\n200 percent of poverty. Medicaid coverage for these women falls\nsignificantly as income as a percentage of poverty rises, but Medic-\naid covers only 44 percent of those with incomes below the federal\npoverty line. Private health insurance coverage increases with in-\ncome, but even for those with incomes above 200 percent of poverty,\nonly 49 percent obtain private coverage. The net result is that rates\nof uninsurance among women who formerly received welfare are\npoverty. Once incomes exceed 200 percent of poverty, the gains in\nprivate insurance begin to offset losses as a result of falling Medicaid\ncoverage, and the rate of uninsurance among these women falls to\nPatterns of child health insurance coverage by income are similar.\nFor the 66 percent of former child welfare recipients in families with\nincomes less than the federal poverty level, 59 percent have Medic-\naid, even though most of these children should have been eligible\nunder federal poverty-related provisions (Exhibit 4).18 Medicaid\ncoverage falls significantly to 36 percent for children with incomes\nover 200 percent of poverty. Private insurance coverage rises signifi-\ncantly from 22 percent for those under the poverty line to 45 percent\nfor those over 200 percent of poverty. The resulting pattern on child\nrates of uninsurance is that the children most likely to be uninsured\nare those with incomes between 100 percent and 200 percent of\npoverty. In this group 32 percent of children are uninsured, although\nthe difference between these children and those below the poverty\nline (24 percent) is not statistically significant.19\nHealth Insurance Coverage Of Former Welfare Recipients, By Poverty Status, 1997\nWomen\nChildren\nSOURCE: 1997 National Survey of America's Families.\nNOTES: Significance tests are in comparison with 0\u00ad100 percent of poverty.

For the entire sample of those leaving welfare,\nwe found that 41 percent of women and 25 percent of children were\nuninsured. One year or more after leaving welfare, 49 percent of\nwomen and 29 percent of children were uninsured.\nEven women who follow the \"welfare-to-work\" objective of wel-\nfare reform and gain employment have roughly even odds of being on\nMedicaid, privately insured, or uninsured after leaving welfare. Only\nabout a third of the 56 percent of women who hold jobs after leaving\nwelfare obtain private coverage through their jobs; this can happen\neither because the employer does not offer health insurance or be-\ncause the worker decides that the cost is too high. Children are more\nlikely to be covered after leaving welfare because federal and state\nMedicaid eligibility rules are more inclusive of children than they\nare of adults. Considering current efforts to target health coverage to\nneedy children, it is puzzling that so many persons who are already\nknown to the welfare system and are likely to remain in poverty do\nnot receive Medicaid and go uninsured.\nSeveral of the reasons commonly cited for low take-up rates in\nMedicaid overall probably operate here as well.20 First, stigma at-\ntached to Medicaid could deter some former welfare recipients from\nreapplying for coverage. Second, PRWORA has greatly increased\nthe complexity of Medicaid eligibility rules, and these rules may be\ndifficult for former welfare recipients to comprehend. Third, state\nadministrative requirements, such as completing complicated appli-\ncation forms and undergoing in-person interviews at a welfare of-\nfice, may place difficult burdens on newly working parents. Fourth,\nthe complexity of the new Medicaid eligibility rules may be difficult\nto understand even for welfare caseworkers, who have the major\nresponsibility for educating poor families about Medicaid.\nBeyond 1997 it is not clear whether the problem of unin-\nsurance after leaving welfare will get better or worse. The\nsystem has become increasingly difficult for both caseworkers\nand families to navigate, and many welfare leavers may be deterred\nfrom applying for Medicaid simply because of these administrative\n\"Stigma attached to Medicaid could deter some former welfare\nrecipients from reapplying for coverage.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nC O V E R A G E & W E L F A R E\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Moreover, PRWORA gave states\nnew flexibility in expanding coverage to children and their parents,\nand some states are beginning to take advantage of these provisions.\nThis paper is a product of the Assessing the New Federalism project, which is sup-\nported by the Annie E.

Families also are eligible for TMA if they lose welfare because their child-sup-\nport payments increased. The caretaker is required to report the family's\nincome quarterly and must continue working to remain eligible. PRWORA\nextended states' obligation to provide TMA until 2001. See J. Kaplan, \"Transi-\ntional Medicaid Assistance\" (Washington: Welfare Information Network,\n3. Federal law requires states to provide Medicaid to children under age six with\nfamily incomes below 133 percent of the poverty line, as well as to older\nof poverty. In 1997 children between the ages of six and about thirteen with\nfamily incomes below the poverty level were eligible for Medicaid. Most states\nhave expanded coverage beyond these minimum requirements.\n4. States have the option of lowering the income limits on eligibility to the level\nthat applied 1 May 1988. States also are able to adjust the way countable\nincome is computed for the purposesof determining Medicaid eligibility using\nthe AFDC-based rules. See C. Mann, \"An Analysis of the AFDC-Related\nMedicaid Provisions in the New Welfare Law\" (Washington: Center on\nBudget and Policy Priorities, 19 September 1999). By increasing the amount\nand types of income that are disregarded, states can expand their Medicaid\nprograms. See J. Guyer and C.

Because this method captures\nonly fourteen additional families, the effect of not using this probe in the latter\npart of the survey should be negligible.\n10. We exclude men who formerly received welfare from our analysis because\nthere were too few of them to examine separately and because men and\nwomen differ, on average, across all of the key variables in this study.\n11.

Even when we limit the sample to women who were working, who should\nthereby meet the requirements for TMA, only 63 percent who left welfare less\nthan six months ago were on Medicaid.\n14. See R.

Despite several differences in the data\nsources, the results of the two studies are fairly similar. Our results for unin-\nsurance among welfare leavers are somewhat higher than those reported in the\nearlier study: 36 percent versus 23 percent for women, and 24 percent versus\n17 percent for children.

We find that women were less likely than men\nwere to be employed after leaving welfare; thus our figure, which is restricted\nto women, is lower. We obtain identical estimates when wedo include men in\nour sample.\n17. Of the women who formerly received welfare and were not working, 65 per-\ncent had family incomes below the federal poverty level. Of those who were\nworking, 53 percent had family incomes below the federal poverty level.\n18. Children who were older than thirteen in 1997 were not all eligible for Medic-\naid because of the ongoing phase-in for children age six and older with in-\ncomes less than 100 percent of poverty. When we limit this analysis to chil-\ndren who are thirteen years old and under, all of whom are Medicaid eligible,\nonly 63 percent had Medicaid.\n19. These patterns do not mimic health insurance coverage for low-income per-\nsons overall. Comparing the health insurance coverage of former welfare re-\ncipients with incomes below 200 percent of poverty to published NSAF re-\nsults for all nonelderly adults and children below 200 percent of poverty, we\nfind that former welfare recipients are more likely be on Medicaid, less likely\nto have private insurance, and more likely to be uninsured.
