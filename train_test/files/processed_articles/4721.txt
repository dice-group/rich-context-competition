    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article reflects on how data circulations and data analysis have become a central and routine part of contemporary\nlife; it does this through the lens of a particular cultural form: the game of football. More specifically, the article focuses\nupon the role of data in the production and playing of football, with the suggestion that forms of measurement and\npattern recognition are now central to the performance of footballers and the recruitment and organization of squads.\nThe article reflects on what this case study reveals about the implications of data, metrics and analytics for contemporary\nculture and suggests that we can use examples like football to see how embedded these data-processes are in the social\nworld. This article presents the concept of productive measures as one means for analysing such developments.\n",

In the\nlatter of these cases, Big Data can potentially be seen to\nbe central to the workings of contemporary capitalism\nand, possibly, as a resource, facilitator and mechanism\nfor the spread of what Brenner et al. (2010) refer to as\nthe processes of `neoliberalization'. Big Data provides\nthe measures by which competition and markets can\nunfold. Against this backdrop, this article attempts to\nsee Big Data as an established and integrated part of\ncontemporary culture. Such an approach allows us to\nexplore the ways in which these data are already play-\ning a part in shaping and defining the social world.\nThat is to say, this article is concerned with how\ndeeply embedded digital data already are in systems\nof measurement, in social ordering and in the perform-\nance of the social world.\nWhen we pause to look closely it is possible to reveal\nthis vast interweaving of new types of data within the\nfabric of social processes. This article takes an ordinary\npart of popular culture, football, and shows how new\nforms of data have steadily redefined this particular\ngame. Rather than seeing this as a sudden rupture or\nmoment of change, this example is telling of a longer\nscale shift in the use of metrics in sport and the more\ngeneral reliance upon statistics and probability calcula-\ntions in the `taming of chance' (Hacking, 1990). As I\nwill describe, these explorations do not suggest that\nmetrics have suddenly become a central part of culture,\nrather it suggests that what we are seeing is an intensi-\nfication of processes that have a long history. Through\nfootball, as a global sport played and watched by mil-\nlions, we might then begin to see just how significant\nthese apparently new types of `big' or by-product data\nDepartment of Sociology, University of York, Heslington, York, UK\nCorresponding author:\nDavid Beer, Department of Sociology, University of York, Heslington,\nEmail: david.beer@york.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution\nof the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.\nsagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nmight be for culture on a larger scale. That is to say that\nwe might see how Big Data, as it is now most often\nreferred to, is not something out-there but is instead,\ninherently, an established presence in our everyday cul-\ntural lives. Alongside this, football is a useful example for\ntwo further reasons. First, it is data heavy in the way it\nhas come to be run and consumed, so it gives us a sort of\narchetypal cultural data assemblage with which to work.\nSecond, the mass-consumption of football, through and\nwithin its changing infrastructures, allows us to explore\nhow consumer capitalism is being reshaped by data and\nhow this translates directly into everyday experiences.\nWe might begin by suggesting that football, as a\ncontemporary cultural form, exemplifies a kind of\n`everyday neoliberalism' (Mirowski, 2013). In his key\nbook on the survival of neoliberal political formations\nafter the global economic crisis, Philip Mirowski argues\nthat part of the reason for the endurance of neoliberal-\nism is its embeddedness in the everyday. Mirowski's\nwork is highly historically sensitive so this should not\nbe read as being neoliberalism's unexpected or sudden\nmoment of glory, rather Mirowski is situating everyday\nneoliberalism in a history of political governance which\nhe argues is now so embedded that it has seeped into\nimportance of our `brushes with neoliberalism on a\ngranular scale'. From this perspective the everyday is\nthat `a kind of ``folk'' or ``everyday'' neoliberalism has\nsunk so deeply into the cultural unconscious that even a\nfew rude shocks can't begin to bring it to the surface\nlong enough to provoke discomfort'. For Mirowski\nthere is no single market or notion of competition\nthat becomes dominant, but rather neoliberalism is\ntranslated into everyday practices and notions of self.\nAs such, Mirowski (2013) suggests that we should\nattempt to understand the `contours of neoliberal con-\nsciousness' and that we should `explore the accretion of\nneoliberal attitudes, imaginaries, and practices that\nhave come to inform everyday life' (pp. 91\u00ad92).\nThe discussions offered in this article have a kind of\nsubtext: the focus is upon the role of data, metrics and\nanalytics in culture: but in the background this article\ncan also be read as an attempt to explore the `contours'\nof `everyday neoliberalism' as they play out in particu-\nlar social spheres and as systems of measurement and\ncompetition become a routine part of everyday atti-\ntudes, imaginaries and practices. In other words, we\nhave the complex history of neoliberalism (see Gane,\n2014) in its various ongoing uneven and specific `recon-\nstructions' (Peck, 2010: 6) running alongside the history\nof the emergence of `statistical thinking' (Porter, 1986)\nin culture and sport.\nAs this would suggest, and although it is sociologic-\nally interesting in its own right, this article is centrally\nconcerned with football only in so far as it allows us to\nunderstand the role of these new types of digital by-\nproduct data and their wider implications for culture.\nIts value as a case study is in allowing us to see the\ncirculations of these data and to understand how new\nforms of measurement and calculation are now inte-\ngrated into, or will come to be integrated into, everyday\ncultural experiences. Matthew Fuller, Lisa Adkins and\nCelia Lury (2012: 6) have claimed that data `surpluses\nare routinely harvested and put to work in new ways,\nincluding in novel forms of value creation'. They con-\ntinue by arguing that `rather than being inert or dead,\nin the contemporary social world data is brought into\nexistence as active or ``alive''' (Adkins and Lury, 2012:\n6). Indeed, it has been suggested that there is an emer-\ngent `politics of circulation' in which data have come to\nrecursively fold-back into and reconfigure culture\n(Beer, 2013). Football is an example that can be used\nto, at least partially, make visible this `politics of circu-\nlation'. Plus, aside from noting the importance of sport-\nwith the league table proving particularly powerful in\naffording neoliberal forms of marketised competition\nates the generation, accumulation, filtering, archiving\nand sorting processes of data in different forms and is\ntherefore suggestive of how the broader social world is\ncoming to potentially be reworked and reconstituted by\ndata and metrics. To sensitise us to such processes, and\nto enable us to think through the ways in which meas-\nurements produce and cajole as well as capture and\nenvision, this article will begin to develop the concept\nof productive measures. This concept considers not just\nwhat can be measured and how, but it can also be used\nto reflect upon how these systems are presented, mar-\nketed and understood. The concept of productive meas-\nures is aimed at understanding the exchanges between\nemergent systems of measurement and the neoliberal\nattitudes, imaginaries and practices to which\nMirowski refers.\nProductive measures\nIt may seem odd to suggest that the way that culture\nis produced, or in this case the way a sport is played,\ncan be reshaped and reworked by data. In fact we can\nplace such an argument within a long tradition of\nwork on the history of statistics; in his influential\nwork in this area, for example, Ian Hacking (1990)\ntalks about statistics and classifications `making\npeople up'. This broad line of argument is also actu-\nally entirely in keeping with much of the most reveal-\ning recent work on digital or Big Data. Data and\nanalytics are often understood to be powerful in\nenacting or constituting the social world. This core\n2 Big Data & Society\npremise has been argued in a variety of ways. There is\na sense that there is an ontological shift at play as\ndata and analytics become a central part of the func-\ntioning of the social. Louise Amoore's recent book is\none particular highlight. In this text, Amoore\nexplores the way that notions or visions of what is\npossible come to shape preemptive decision-making\nprocesses \u00ad here we find a break from the earlier work\non probability in the move to understand how metrics\npredict possible outcomes. Amoore (2013: 9, italics in\nthe original) describes her book in the following\nterms:\nThe specific modality of risk that I address in the\nchapters that follow has an anticipatory logic: it acts\nnot strictly to prevent the playing out of a particular\ncourse of events on the basis of past data tracked for-\nward into probable futures but to preempt an unfolding\nand emergent event in relation to an array of possible\nprojected futures. It seeks not to forestall the future via\ncalculation but to incorporate the very knowability and\nprofound uncertainty of the future into imminent\ndecision.\nAmoore's book is concerned with how data are used\nto project imagined futures that are then used to inform\ndecision-making processes; thus, data and predictive\nanalytics of different types become a part of practices,\ndecisions and social outcomes. Again, this is not so\nmuch a rupture as a set of analytic opportunities that\nare seen to be found in new types of data. From this\nperspective, data analytics do not just shape what is\nknown, they also shape what is knowable. This is not\nabout what is probable, but what is possible \u00ad hence\nAmoore talks of `the politics of possibility'.\nThere are other prominent examples of these types\nof constitutive arguments. Scott Lash (2007), for\ninstance, has argued for the role of data and algorithms\nin new types of, what he calls, `post-hegemonic' power.\nElsewhere, in geography, Kitchin and Dodge (2011)\nhave built a persuasive case for the centrality of data\nand code in the functioning of contemporary `code/\nspace', with software modelling shaping social out-\ncomes and ordering practices. Adrian Mackenzie\nhave argued for the need for software studies to be part\nof broader conceptions of the social world \u00ad these\ninclude accounts of how software and code come to\norder the social in various ways. The list could go on,\nbut for purposes of brevity we might accept for the\nmoment that there is an emergent and increasingly\nbroad interest in the constitutive power of data, software\nand analytics.\nThis wave of interest in the constitutive power of\ndata, software and code is increasing as it becomes\nclear that data are, in a number of ways, central to\nthe make-up of contemporary social formations of dif-\nferent types. Despite this excellent emergent body of\nliterature, we are still only at the foothills in our critical\nanalysis of the role of data in culture and society.\nThe scale of these changes would appear to far outstrip\nthe existing analytics; as a result we are likely to feel\nthat we are playing catch-up. Thanks to the existing\nwork, and also to other insights into `the social life of\nmethods' (Ruppert et al., 2013) \u00ad which argues for an\nunderstanding of how methods and forms of analysis\nhave moved outside of research practices and into the\nsocial world \u00ad we are in a position to continue to open-\nup these potential social transformations and the impli-\ncations of the apparent rise of data and analytics.\nAs Ajana (2013) has pointed out though, it is not\nthat these forms of measurement have come from\nnowhere. Instead she argues that biometrics of different\nsorts have long histories. Ajana suggests that trans-\nformations in media and the processes of digitalization\nhave simply altered the capacity and scope of these\nsystems of measurement (see also Beer, 2014; Higgins\nare actually seeing the `remediation of measure'. Ajana\nexplains, there is a need:\nto challenge the label of newness that is often stapled\non [biometrics] and to draw attention to the fact that\nthe body has for so long been the subject of control,\nmeasurement, classification and surveillance. The dig-\ntalisation aspect of biometrics has certainly intensified\nsuch processes and opened up the body to further\nFor Ajana, as a result of a range of developments,\nwe are seeing an intensification of systems of measure-\nment, yet these systems have a very long genealogy\n(see also Crampton and Elden, 2006). Indeed, if we\nlecture's on Security, Territory, Population (Foucault,\n2007) it is clear how historically embedded the connec-\ntions are between forms of `calculation', `techniques of\npower' and the `art of government'. These connections\nbut they are dealt with most directly at the beginning\nand end of the course \u00ad most notably in relation to the\nuse of statistics, measurement and statistical apparatus\nin the early lectures and culminating in the final two\nlectures with a focus upon questions of competition, the\nuse of statistics in defining interests and the emergence\nof circulation and a `circular ontology' (for a detailed\nreading of Foucault's lectures in relation to calculation,\nand extends these themes in his analysis of the geneal-\nogy of neoliberalism in the following year's lecture\ncourse on biopolitics. What we are dealing with here\nthen has both a technical and political history (which\nhas been elaborated in terms of population metrics\nby Ruppert, 2011). At the same time though, new\npossibilities and opportunities are emerging for the\nintegration and expansion of such techniques and inter-\nests as a consequence of some key changes in the infra-\nstructures and mediation of everyday life. When\nthinking of productive measures then, we are thinking\nof the intensification of systems of measurement along\nwith the rise of powerful data infrastructures and the\nconstitutive and productive power that these systems of\nmeasurement might have for the way that the social is\nperformed. These productive measures do not emerge\nfrom nowhere; we would expect them to be situated in\nthis technical and social history of emergence and\nintensification. To add to this, if we combine the\nnoted observations about the constitutive power of\ndata and data analytics together with conceptions of\nneoliberal governance then we have a pressing and\npotentially profound cocktail of developments with\nwhich to concern ourselves.\nFootball, data and metrics: Playing\ngames through data\nIn the case of football the constitutive powers of data\nare highly visible. Even tuning in to a football phone-in\nor listening to the commentary on a game we are pre-\nsented with innumerous examples of statistical think-\ning. Metrics and statistical insights filter into the way\nthe game is talked about and reveal a type of everyday\nneoliberalism that has sunken into this popular cultural\nform. The way the game is discussed and presented is\nnow very stats heavy, from the mistakes made or cau-\ntions handed out by referees to the historical and\ncomparative performance of managers and on to the\ntracking of players' actions and movements. The cover-\nage of football and its discourse are full of metric based\ndifferentiations \u00ad and, of course, football is not the only\nsport that is like this. The game of football is undoubt-\nedly changing as a consequence of the presence and use\nof data. The influences take numerous forms. The way\nthat metrics influence how the game is understood in\nturn fold-back into fan reactions and organizational\ndecisions in quite complex and interwoven feedback\nloops. Data are game changers. What is most difficult\nto appreciate is how data are used, like catalysts, in\nrecursive and recombinant processes and systems.\nData are drawn from the game, which then informs\nhow the game is played and consumed, which then\nfinds its way into the data, and so on. . .\nTo give some sense of the scale and embedded role of\ndata analysis in the performance of football, we can\nturn first to the structures of the clubs themselves.\nJust by way of an opening illustration, if we begin\nwith the top four teams as they finished in the top\ndivision in England in the previous season we find\nthat all four clubs have embedded teams of data ana-\nlysts in their coaching set-ups.1 The club staff profiles\nshow that these individuals and departments play a cen-\ntral part within the clubs' organisation and coaching,\noften catering for first team coaching through to their\nyouth academies. Frequently, these public profiles link\ndata analytics with performance management and team\nimprovement. I will speak about the data analysis\ncompany Prozone in a moment, but, as an example,\none of the top four clubs employed a former Prozone\nemployee for their own in-house data analysis. Another\nclub had a performance analysis department, with the\nexpress purpose of using statistics to shape team per-\nformance. This club even hosted a series of videos of\nthis data analysis department in action, showing how\nthey used statistics before, during and after games in\norder to refine performance. Half-time even provided\nopportunities for the data analysis to be a real-time part\nof the game as it unfolded, with interactive white-\nboards used to communicate the analysis to the players.\nThe videos show how players are given the analysis and\nhow they then use it to shape their performance, with\none player commenting on how he discovers whether or\nnot he has played well from the post-match statistics.\nIndeed, the remaining two clubs both had dedicated\nteams of performance analysts. The exact role of\nthese analysts was less clear for one club but was\nmore visibly integrated into the coaching techniques\nof the other. In this later case there was a team of\nanalysts with defined roles and management structure.\nThere is even a notable visual dimension to the ana-\nlytics, with statistics often used alongside video \u00ad and\nwith one club even employing a specialist in visualiza-\ntion to enable the data to be used in different visual\nforms. Smartboards, iPads and other devices were\nused to provide the players and managers with key ana-\nlytics and the means for their communication.\nAll of the top four teams had data analytics built\ninto their coaching structures, and all made this visible\nthrough their public profiles \u00ad with one club even show-\ning exactly how these analytics were used. Data\nanalytics are not just a part of the actual set-up of\nthese clubs, they are also a part of how they publicly\npresent themselves. It would seem that they aim to be\nseen to be cutting-edge in their use of analytics. It is\nimportant to add though that data analytics are not\nsimply the domain of top-level elite clubs. The pattern\ncontinues for other smaller clubs, albeit on an appar-\nently different scale. Selecting two teams from the\nfourth tier of English football, based upon their\nbeing located in areas where the author has lived,\nboth clubs had performance analysts included in their\n4 Big Data & Society\ncoaching staff,2 one of which was expressly involved in\nusing statistics and data to aid team performance.\nAcross the sector it would seem that the role of such\nanalysts is to `boost . . . competitive performance', a role\nizations that are defined by the conditions of neoliberal\ncompetition.\nOn top of this, and extending the reach of such\nmetricisation beyond professional football, items such\nas Adidas' trackable football boots mean that anyone\nowning such an item can become their own football\nperformance data analyst as the `quantified self'\n(Lupton, 2013) combines with the codified `permeable\nlogject' (Dodge and Kitchin, 2009). Similarly, football\ndata sites, such as StatsBomb, provide the means for\nfans to also be data analysts themselves.\nStatsBomb.com provides data analysis insights of dif-\nferent types through its group of analysts and writers.\nThe site provides a range of data analytics; these\ninclude visualisations of individual players' perform-\nances across a range of core metrics (such as goal\nconversion rates, through balls, the number of times\nthey were dispossessed and so on). There are also\ndynamic maps that show the movement of players\nduring matches; here players are represented by dots\nthat move around the pitch and as they are involved\nin the play the size of the dot increases.The glossary of\nStatsBomb's data shows that they also use metrics ran-\nging from shot dominance, shooting accuracy through\nto assists and other more complex statistics about the\nperformance of the defence that takes account of ball\npossession. This would seem to be an invite to play with\nthe data and to be your own analyst.\nThe above is suggestive of the influence of data in the\norganisation of football clubs and team performance,\nbut what about its influence on the players themselves?\nThis is a more difficult territory to explore, and I will\nonly touch upon it in this article, but we can turn here\nfor some sense of the possibilities to the Secret\nFootballer, an anonymous professional footballer\nwho writes for The Guardian newspaper. In an article\nFootballer spoke of his experiences of data in the game.\nHe began by linking the changes he had seen in football\nwith those that had already taken place in baseball:\nThe Moneyball philosophy first used by the Oakland A's\ngeneral manager Billy Beane is the study of a set of under-\nestimated statistics that are then used to find undervalued\nbaseball players in the transfer market. Soccernomics, the\nfootball equivalent, is the analysis of a similar set of num-\nbers used to give teams a competitive edge.\nThe well-known Moneyball philosophy is based\nupon using data to find and uncover what is\nunderstood to be hidden value. The idea being that\nplayers who are either undervalued or who will come\nto have value later in their careers can be identified\nearly on and thus traded below their market rate.\nThis approach uses whatever metrics are available,\nwhich has drastically escalated in recent years, to illu-\nminate potential value (with the speed of decision-\nmaking being crucial, as with the velocity of high\nspeed trading described by Mackenzie, 2014). The\nresult is that decision-making processes are altered by\nthe presence of data. The sense is that data can be used\nto inform decisions and that this is seen to be a more\nobjective and analytically accurate approach to deci-\nsion-making. In other words, there is a sense that redu-\ncing the need for human intuition, discretion and\nagency can lead to decision-making being more accur-\nate and value-generating. There is a faith here in the\nnumbers, or as Theodor M Porter (1995: 8) has put it, a\n`trust in numbers' and `faith in objectivity'. Here we see\nthe conditions in which such faith and trust are able to\nthrive. Indeed, a recent discussion of the role of data in\nrevealed some further details of the integration of\ndata in the life of the footballer. The discussion,\nwhich involved two recently retired players and one\ncurrent player, revealed some of the ways in which\nthe presence of metrics shaped players' behaviours. It\nwas suggested that players play the game in order to\nimprove the metrics and that there was something of a\nburgeoning obsession with performance metrics. The\npass completion static in particular was noted as\nbeing important, with players choosing safe short\npasses in order to increase pass completion statistics.\nSimilarly, it was suggested that what was described as\nan `intensity' measure \u00ad which related to prolonged\nsprints \u00ad was also a particularly prominent stat and\nsomething of a bugbear that could be manipulated by\ncertain movements on the pitch. An existing football\ncoach suggested that data analysts had a powerful\nrole in decision-making practices in many clubs, with\ntheir analysis being used to make decisions about team\nselection and the like.\nSimilarly, the Secret Footballer continued by\ndescribing how this type of metric-based approach\nand philosophy had come to shape the game they are\npart of:\nWhen Liverpool failed in a bid for Gae\n\u00a8 l Clichy, it was\nreported that Comolli turned to Jose\n\u00b4 Enrique after dis-\ncovering that his statistical figures were far more\nimpressive than Liverpool's scouting report suggested.\nHe was also much cheaper than Clichy in terms of the\ntransfer fee and salary. What stood out about Jose\n\u00b4\nEnrique, supposedly, was that he had one of the highest\npass completions and entries into the final third; he\ncould also be credited with having a direct hand in\nmany of Newcastle's goals.\nAgain, this description illustrates how data became\ncentral to highlighting perceived value and in decision-\nmaking. In this case, the data used came to influence\nthe players who made-up a particular squad. The use of\nmetrics in this case led directly to an alteration in play-\ning staff. One player was seen in a new light as a result\nof data about pass completion rates, field position and\nso on. In a separate instance, the Arsenal manager\nArsene Wenger admitted that statistics were used in\nthe decision over the transfer of Gabriel Paulista\n(Pitt-Brooke, 2015). It is interesting to note that the\ninterview about the Paulista transfer reveals that the\nquality of the statistics was important but only in so\nfar as they reinforced the `eye' of the coaches. It is\ninteresting to note too, alongside my earlier observa-\ntions about the coaching structure of leading football\nclubs, that Arsenal have been reported to have\npurchased a data analysis company in 2012 (Hytner,\n2014) \u00ad the descriptions of the analytics offered by it\nsuggest that the analysis is taken beyond things like\ngoal assists to see if the pass was accurate enough\nthat the player receiving it did not have to break\nstride and so on. Here we have data directly shaping\na financial decision, with economic consequences,\nand also directly shaping the game itself. Data analysis\nhere is used to find what is understood to be hidden\nvalue and to exploit it for market position and a com-\npetitive edge.\nThe above is suggestive of how data are used in the\ntransfer business; the Secret Footballer also suggests\nthat these data are used to shape gameplay itself. In\nthis case, data about football are used to inform how\nplayers are coached and ultimately to reinforce or\nchange playing practices \u00ad with echoes of my earlier\nobservations made about analysts in coaching staff\nstructures. As the Secret Footballer describes, `[i]n\nopen play, a huge amount of study, from my own\nexperience at clubs, is devoted to the calculation of\nwhat are described as final third entries, penalty box\nentries and regains of the ball in the final third'. In\nthis case, data extracted from football games are used\nto explore what is successful. Then the patterns that\nrepresent success are used to coach and shape playing\npractices. The direct aim is no longer to score a goal,\nfor example, but instead players are coached to aim for\na certain number of passes or final third entries.\nDefensively they might be coached to head the ball to\ncertain places from crosses and so on. The result is that\nplayers' behaviours are directly shaped by the data\nand their uses, sometimes based on the team-play and\nother times on individual practices. The picture is of a\ngame that is managed, and sometimes potentially\nmicromanaged, by metrics. Players are coached to\nfollow the patterns of success that are found in the\ndata. The coverage does not end there, with further\nindications that teams are seen to be drawing widely\nwith some even asking if the human agency involved in\nfootball club decision-making might be usurped by\nthose with the skills to find patterns in Big Data\n(Lee, 2014). Of course, not all clubs will be run or\ncoached in the same way; there is likely to be resistance\nor defence of values, as with Wenger's assertion of the\nrole of the `eye' in decision-making, but this gives a\nsense of the scale of influence that data have in the\nproduction of a football matches. Playing the game, it\nwould seem, is about playing the stats. This leads us to\nconsider the scale of the data assemblage in football\nand the industry of analytics that has emerged.\nProductive measures in organisations\nand structural decision-making\nThe above is suggestive of just how deeply this particu-\nlar cultural form is implicated by the presence of data\nand analytics \u00ad which in turn is suggestive of how\nmetrics and biometrics are intensified by digitalisation\nprocesses (as discussed by Ajana, 2013). We can use this\nas the base from which to observe the broader industry\nof analytics that has emerged in football. Indeed, the\npresence of the data solutions industry in sport offers\nfurther insight into the intensification of the role of\nmetrics in culture. Returning to the central themes of\nthis article, what is interesting here is not just the data\nassemblage itself but how it is described, marketed and\npresented.\nWe can begin with the Football consultancy\ncompany Soccernomics. This particular organisation\nis illustrative of the broader emergence of an industry\nof data analytics and data solutions (see Beer, 2013:\n`Consultancy, Research, Ideas', describe their practices\nas follows:\nWe use data analysis to help clubs and national feder-\nations improve performance and save money. By finding\nhidden truths in the numbers, we can determine which\nplayers and coaches are over-performing, helping your\nclub find value in recruitment. Our penalty analysis,\nbased on game theory, has been used in FA Cup,\nChampions League and World Cup finals. (taken from\nhttp://www.soccernomics-agency.com/ November 2013)\nReflecting the Moneyball approach, here we can see\ndirectly how data and analysis are being presented to\nfootball clubs and how the options they offer might be\ndeployed. Data analysis here is depicted as the means\n6 Big Data & Society\nby which greater efficiency might be achieved. It is\npresented as the means by which performance is\nimproved whilst efficiency also increases (echoing the\nuse of a `performativity' equation as a legitimising\ntool as described by Lyotard, 1979). In this instance,\ndata analysis is charged with finding `hidden truths',\nwhich might then expose where value is to be found.\nAgain, we have the sense that data analysis has the\ncapacity to reveal patterns or forms of knowledge\nthat are not possible with human agency alone. Also\nhere we see that decision-making is intended to be\nswayed and shaped by data analysis \u00ad which player,\nwhich coach, how to take penalties, and so on. The\nimage produced is the one in which data analysis tran-\nscends the capacities of individuals and provides new\ntypes of agency that can be called upon to get decisions\nright (potentially in self-reinforcing ways).\nSoccernomics though does not represent an isolated\nexample, far from it. Perhaps a better-known example\nin terms of the media coverage it has received over the\nlast decade is Prozone. According to their marketing\nmaterials at the end of 2013, Prozone were:\nEstablished in the UK in 1998, Prozone have been\npioneering the use of performance analysis in football\nfor over a decade and in that time we've worked with\nsome of the leading coaches in the world of sport. We\nnow have offices in the USA, Spain, UAE, India and\nJapan and offer the world's leading performance ana-\nlysis service.\nHere we get an impression of both the length of time\nin which data analysis has been finding its way into\nfootball and also the apparent global spread of such\npractices. Again, their accounts of their services focus\nupon the potential for enhanced decision-making and\nfor finding patterns in data that lead to improved per-\nformance and greater efficiency.\nSimilarly, from the 2013 marketing materials,\nProzone claim that:\nFrom the flexibility offered by our real-time, self coding\nanalysis products to the depth and accessibility of infor-\nmation delivered by our post-match and opposition ana-\nlysis services, we're constantly breaking new ground and\nsetting the standard for what can be achieved with\nobjective and reliable performance insights.\nThe suggestion here is that there are new develop-\nments and new types of analysis that are being devel-\noped and honed in order for decisions to be more\n`objective' and for performance to be more `reliable'.\nSuch an approach to data and metrics is seen to offer\nobjective decision-making which outstrips the more\nsubjective understandings of individuals. As Porter\nnumbers . . . has at least the appearance of being fair\nand impersonal'. What Katherine Hayles (2006) has\ncalled the `cognisphere' begins to mesh with decision-\nmaking processes and stretch them out across human\nand machine agency. We are also presented here with a\nversion of Louise Amoore's (2013) `politics of possibil-\nity', with data derivatives being used to imagine futures\nand make predictions about what will work and what is\npossible. In this instance, Prozone are known for offer-\ning football match analysis, for providing visualisations\nof games and performance, for tracking players, and\nfor tracking team and ball movements through games,\nwhich in turn are then analysed in various ways. These\npractices and visualisations can be seen then to be\nimplicated in this `politics of possibility' to which\nAmoore refers, with various possible outcomes being\ndrawn into current decision-making.\nTo enhance their credentials, and to also illustrate\nwhat a routine part of football data analysis has\nbecome, various endorsements are used in the market-\ning of these data solution services. These include the\ncurrent Derby County and former England Manager\nSteve McClaren, as well as other international coaches.\nFor instance, the following endorsement is illustrative\nof how Prozone's analytics are now depicted as a rou-\ntine part of the game itself:\nPROZONE3 is a very useful tool for me and my staff. In\na short space of time I can acquire key statistical infor-\nmation on teams and individuals as well as viewing that\nof our rival teams. For these reasons Prozone remains a\nproduct that is critical to the work of my team. (Ernesto\nValverde, Former Manager Olympiacos FC, from\nProzone website)\nWe have to acknowledge that this is an endorsement\ntaken from the company's own marketing, but it is\nnevertheless highly suggestive, along with the earlier\naccounts of coaching staff analysts, of how data ana-\nlysis is embedded into the practices and production of\nfootball. Alongside this, it is also illustrative of how\ndata analysis is presented as a norm and as a progres-\nsive move in this cultural sector. It indicates an attempt\nto present data analysis as a routine part of cultural\nproduction. Data analytics are used in the preparation\nfor games, in understanding performance, in finding\nsuccessful patterns of play, and it is part of how the\nteam is coached and organised. We see here that data\nabout football circulates back into the game itself, a\nprocess of data circulation that fits with broader pat-\nAs I have already indicated, the influence of data\nand analytics is not limited to the patterns of play on\nthe field. Prozone also provide analytic services for\nshaping decision-making around player recruitment,\nthus the make-up of the team becomes a product of\ndata analytics. As they put it, `Prozone RECRUITER\nis a game-changing online solution that enables teams\nto make considered technical scouting decisions\ninformed by objective performance information'.\nAgain, this is promoted as a more `objective' and\ndetached form of decision-making that sees beyond\nthe subjective positions of scouts and coaches to\nreveal hidden value. Decisions are presented as being\nmore `considered' and `technical'. This then is illustra-\ntive of how these forms of data and metrics are viewed\nand how their capacities are understood. The message\nis clear, data analytics lead to more objective decision-\nmaking which in turn leads to the discovery of hidden\nvalue, with the result being greater performance and\nefficiency.\nIn August 2014, it was announced that the video\ngames company Sports Interactive, who are responsible\nfor the popular Football Manager series of games,\nwould allow Prozone to use their games database to\ninform their actual player scout analytics (BBC,\n2014). The database behind these games was seen to\nbe so accurate that it could be used to inform actual\nfootball transfer activity. Here the consumption of\nfootball in the form of a video game begins to blur\nwith the actual production of the game itself, with\nthose playing the game working from the same metrics\nas those producing and organizing the actual football\nteams and matches \u00ad which might conjure the image of\na kind of hyperreal `ludodrome' (Atkinson and Willis,\n2007). These types of circulations add further complex-\nity to our understanding of how metrics feedback into\nthe social and cultural world, with consumption and\nvirtual game play being integrated into systems of foot-\nball production themselves.\nWorking on a similar time scale, thus suggesting that\nthe escalation of metrics in sport intensified from the\nAs well as providing statistics to professional clubs\nOpta also provide data services to broadcasters, pub-\nlishers, betting companies, sponsors and fans. This\nreveals the way that this data solution industry oper-\nates, providing data and data services for a range of\ndifferent types of customers. `Finding beauty in the\ndetail' is Opta's tagline. It is also notable that they pro-\nvide these data services for 40 different sports. We see\nhere the scale of the use of data in culture, which goes\nfar beyond football and is global in its reach \u00ad Opta\nhave 140 employees across 10 countries \u00ad and weaves\ntogether the interests of bookmakers, fans and com-\nmentators as well as those of the actual clubs them-\nselves. Again, the clubs are invited to use this data in\n`scouting', `recruitment' and `performance' analysis or\nto prepare for upcoming opponents. Echoing the types\nof services provided by the other providers, Opta\nemphasize the scale and detail of their data, which is\ndescribed as both `live' and `archived' as well as being\n`fast' and `robust'. Indeed, the focus is upon the speed\nof the analysis and how comprehensive the archive of\ndata is. Opta emphasize the `authenticity' and `credibil-\nity' of the data, which is provided in ways that `illumin-\nate' and `inform' or to provide `sensational facts'.\nAs well as the detail of the data, again the accessibility\nof the visualisations is a core component of the services,\nwith `graphical overviews' and 3D graphics with `vir-\ntual angles' all providing users with variegated visual\ninsights. Again, media companies and football clubs\nfans are also invited to be their own analysts and to\nuse these `immersive' data, with live match day event\ncentres that are available on mobile phone platforms.\nIt would seem that data solutions and analytics in the\ncultural sphere are deeply embedded in the industry as\na whole.\nThe types of performance data feeds that Opta pro-\nvide gives a sense of the intensity of the data that is\nbeing extracted \u00ad this simply was not available before\nthe data assemblage escalated from the late 1990s.4\nOpta offer three tiers of performance data feeds; these\nvary in their complexity and detail. Across a range of\nnational football competitions \u00ad and again it should be\nnoted that this goes beyond football and into other\nsports \u00ad they capture data on `every on-the-ball con-\ntact'. For every `event' they log a series of `descriptors'\nthat include `pitch co-ordinate, a player and team ref-\nerence plus a time stamp'. The result of using these\n`variables' is a range of statistics about the game.\nOpta suggest that this level of detail means that they\ncan separate out different `types of pass', tell which\ntackles were `goal-saving' or that `regained possession\nin the final third'. They can even, they claim, tell what\ntype of shot has been hit at goal and provide compari-\nsons. Clearly then we have here an advanced data\nassemblage and analytics industry that intensifies the\npresence of metrics in culture, both in terms of its pro-\nduction and its consumption (through broadcasters,\nprint media and even directly to the fans).\nOf course, these discussions of metrics in football\nforce us to ask questions about what might be under-\nstood to be the immeasurable parts of football or\naspects of performance that are not easily quantified.\nIt is possible that the types of performance, practices\nand actions that are captured by the data and that are\ntherefore easily measured are those that then become\nothers words, the data that are captured define what is\ndeemed to be of value. Other practices, which may be\nsuccessful but are not captured easily by the data, are\nthen potentially sidelined. We might imagine that there\nare some involved in these organisations that would\n8 Big Data & Society\nresist the usurping of their own intuition in making\nsuch decisions. In his recent autobiography, to pick\nan example, the former footballer and manager Roy\nKeane (2014) used such systems but raises some ques-\ntions about the use of statistics and the limitations they\npresent for the judgment of coaches and managers,\nwhich is one amongst other indicators of a defence of\nhuman agency in decision-making even if this is ultim-\nately reinforced through metrics. Furthermore, in terms\nof a game like football we might wonder how artistry,\ncreativity, unorthodox play and expressiveness are\nmeasured or factored into such decision-making pro-\ncesses. There is no doubt that there are proxies for\nsuch things within these systems of analysis, but it is\nunlikely that this is enough for many of the protagon-\nists \u00ad there is still plenty of scope for seeing how the\nextent of the faith in these analytics might vary. This\ntype of question might be used to open-up what Luigi\nDoria has called the `problems of measure' (Doria,\nthe complex relations between `value and values' that\nhave been reasserted and rearticulated recently by Bev\nSkeggs (2014). Football, like other cultural forms, can\nbe used to explore the tension that Skeggs's levers open,\nwith value in football, in monetary and organisational\nterms, clashing with the values of players and fans,\nwhich are often based around heritage, artistry and\nenchantment (elaborated in phrases like ``they play\nfootball the way it should be played'', ``they are a\nproper footballing side'', ``x is a cultured player'', ``x\nis an old fashioned No.10'', and so on).\ncultural representations' and that it is `in its very\nessence that the cultural fabric is woven by number\nalone . . . a ``cultural fact'' is a numerical fact'. This\nencourages us towards seeing `numbers' as far-reaching\nand significant in cultural consumption. Numbers\nshape understandings of cultural representations, or\nso Badiou's formulation would suggest, and those num-\nbers also have the capacity to become facts. We have to\nconsider how, as with football, culture more broadly is\nconceived, as well as produced, through numbers. The\nexamples I have mentioned intimate outwards towards\nthe presence of data and metrics, as Badiou hints, as\nbeing woven into the `cultural fabric'. The example of\nfootball presents opportunities for thinking about how\nwe conceive of culture more broadly through number\nand what that means for the things that might go\nunknown.\nConcluding thoughts\nOn the surface this article has explored how football is\nbeing reshaped through the presence of a growing data\nassemblage and the analytics offered in the form of data\nsolutions. It focused upon the role of data in the pro-\nduction and playing of football, with the suggestion\nthat forms of measurement and pattern recognition\nare now central to the performance of footballers and\nthe recruitment and organization of squads. Data are\nused to create an `information overlay' (Mitchell, 2005)\non the game itself. As in other spheres, we see data\nshaping as well as tracking behaviours. I'd like to\nbegin this brief conclusion by emphasizing that this art-\nicle is not just about football, rather it is implicitly\nabout the wider uses and consequences of emergent\nforms of data, measurement and analytics in culture.\nThe football case study is indicative of broader social\nshifts and the rising use of data and metrics in various\nsocial spheres. This is an article about the use of data\nand analytics to reshape the performance of the social,\nbut it is also an article about how metricisation is\ndescribed, presented and promoted in the discourse.\nWhat I have found here is that paying attention to a\nparticular cultural data assemblage and cultural infra-\nstructure, of which I have only touched the surface,\nreveals the way in which data circulate and reshape\norganizations, practices, behaviours and perceptions.\nAs this case study intimates, these forms of data are\nalready an integrated, immanent and embedded part\nof the social world, of our practices and of everyday\nhave noted, `social scientists are only just beginning to\nengage with this emergent political economy of data\nincluding the politics of measurement attached to it'.\nAnd as the case study described here suggests, this is\nno longer emergent but routine and embedded. Systems\nof measurement are not restricted to football, they are a\ngrowing part of contemporary society (for an account\nof this across various social spheres see Higgins and\nLerner, 2010). Football is a useful example because it\nis instructive of the processes themselves and how they\nmight continue to fold-back into the social. The conse-\nquences for agency, decision-making, notions of effi-\nciency and the like were framed here in terms of\nMirowski's (2013) notion of `everyday neoliberalism'.\nThe ideas highlighted through football begin to illumin-\nate significant transformations in how the social world\nis organized, structured, ordered and performed\nthrough data and metrics. These transformations\npoint to this embedded form of everyday neoliberalism,\nin both the formation of the data assemblages and how\nthese technologies fold into culture.\nTo return to the introduction of this article then,\nfootball provides us with illustrative examples of `the\npolitics of data circulations' (Beer, 2013). It also pro-\nvides further illustration of how data circulations\nreshape culture. We can readily see how metrics fold-\nback, in feedback loops, reconfiguring the structure and\nform of the game itself, whilst also potentially reconfi-\nguring how it is consumed. These are large-scale pro-\ncesses that have implications for football itself and for\nhow it is appreciated. This is illustrative of broader\ncultural shifts and of the more general reshaping of\neveryday life by software, code, algorithms and data\ncirculations. The job of sociology will be to unpick\nand attempt to understand the consequences and\ndynamics of these processes as they continue to\nunfold across different social spheres. We might try to\nlocate such systems of measurement, efficiency and\ncompetition within broader political narratives. If we\nwish to place cultural forms within such broader con-\ncerns we need to begin with the material instantiations\nof data, metrics and analytics \u00ad both in terms of the\ntechnologies and systems of measurement and also in\nterms of the types of thinking that encourage their use\nand the rhetoric that facilitates their appropriation. To\ngive one illustration of this, Will Davies (2014: xi) has\nargued that `uncertainty . . . is a key concept for neo-\nliberalism'. One place to start would be to explore how\na certainty in measurement creates uncertainty in those\nbeing measured.\nThe developments I have described in this article\nare not all new, many are based within a fairly long\nhistory, but as Ajana (2013) has argued, these pro-\ncesses are intensifying as a result of digitalization and\nsome broader cultural shifts towards the perceived\nvalue of data and measurement. These developments\ndo not just have implications for this one game;\ninstead these are questions that face the playing and\nunderstanding of the social game more broadly. What\nare often referred to as Big Data, or maybe digital\nby-product data, are not something that exist outside\nof the social world. They circulate through it, reshap-\ning it, altering and disrupting the configurations of\npower and decision-making. These new types of\ndata are an implicit and integrated part of how the\nsocial world is performed and enacted. Football is a\nuseful example for seeing just how deeply these data\nare a part of one particular cultural sphere, but the\nimplications and questions I have outlined here reach\nfar beyond football. They are actually, in my view,\nsome of the most pressing questions that face social\nanalysis today. The use of metrics in football is a\nparticularly profound example of the `social life of\nmethods' (Ruppert et al., 2013), with analytics, visu-\nalization and statistical techniques used in the con-\nduct and enactment of culture, yet it provides us\nwith a series of issues and questions that might be\napplied to less data-centric cultural forms. I would\nlike to conclude by briefly reflecting on some of\nthese issues.\nIn this article, I have suggested that we can explore\nthe presence of productive measures. These productive\nmeasures are intensified and have new scales of possi-\nbility as a result of the growing data assemblage and\nindustry of data analytics. Productive measures, we\nmight conclude, are also responsible for producing as\nwell as tracking the social. They shape behaviours. As\npeople are subject to these forms of measurement they\nwill produce different responses and outcomes, know-\ning, as they often will, what is coming and the way that\ntheir performance will become visible. Culture more\nbroadly may be subject to the equivalent of the\nsimple short pass to a fellow player.\nBased on the case study used in this article and some\nof the points from the key academic literature, we\nmight draw together some closing observations about\nthese productive measures. The first is that by thinking\nof productive measures we are likely to develop an\ninterest in revealing the varying extents of the faith\nplaced in metrics. The extent of this faith in football\nand elsewhere is unclear at the moment, but it is clear\nthat there are perceived values in such metrics\n(academics are likely to see a parallel set of experiences\nto footballers in this regard, see Burrows, 2012). The\nthriving industry of analytics shows that there is some-\nthing of a burgeoning faith in numbers in football at\nleast, if not sport more generally. Second, we can see\nthat the aim of a productive measure is to locate and\nilluminate hidden value, to find things in the data that\ncannot be seen otherwise and to exploit them. Metrics\nare seen to be productive in this regard, they are seen to\nmake efficiencies, reveal truths and find value. Third,\nand relating to this, productive measures define (as well\nas track) what is valued and what are considered\ndesired behaviours and practices. For the footballer it\nmight be pass completion or final third entries, or what-\never the buzz statistic of the day might be, for\nacademics it might be journal articles in the right\nimpact-factor journals and so on. By defining what is\npossible, data and metrics afford what Louise Amoore\n(2009) calls `lines of sight'. As such, and fourth, these\nproductive measures are likely to set the rules, schema\nand frameworks that constrain and contain the social\nworld. These rules of measurement are likely to be pro-\nfound and to become the rules of the game itself. As\ngame the system in rational, self-interested but often\nunpredictable ways to subvert metrics, algorithms,\nand automated decision-making processes'. Here\nthough the systems of measurement set the rules for\nengagement, even if they are ultimately resisted or sub-\nverted. Finally, and by way of summing up, productive\nmeasures exist to enable claims towards strategy, calcu-\nlation and risk management. As such they are intended\nto limit possibilities and to reduce the chances of error.\nThey are seen to be objective and are trusted, some-\ntimes and maybe even often ahead of or in conjunction\n10 Big Data & Society\nwith human agency and discretion. I would suggest that\nthe discussions in this article, and the notion of pro-\nductive measures, would lead us toward these issues\nand open them up for further exploration.\nIn understanding Big Data, or whatever we may wish\nto call it, we should begin with these cultural instanti-\nations, such as football, and then develop an under-\nstanding of the part that they are playing in the\nformation of social, political and cultural developments\nof different types. As with other neoliberal formations, in\nfootball we can see how the `capacity to quantify, dis-\ntinguish, measure and rank' is central to navigating `con-\ncultural data assemblage we have only begun to unravel\nhere illustrates the scale to which these systems can\nmeasure and rank in multifarious and detailed ways.\nQuestions of data, metrics, analytics and number in\nthe cultural sphere are not marginal, rather they are cen-\ntral to contemporary cultural formations. This article is\nintended to work towards an analysis of culture that\nattempts to understand this presence and to place it\nwithin a broader social and political context \u00ad\nnamely one in which questions of measurement are\ntied closely to questions of power and processes of\n`variegated neoliberalization' (Brenner et al., 2010).\nAnd more broadly, as Stuart Elden (2006) has demon-\nstrated through the work of Heidegger, politics,\nnumber, measurement and calculation are deeply inter-\nrelated. Culture, and popular culture, can be found at\nthe forefront of these developments, both in terms of\nthe infrastructures and assemblages of data and meas-\nurement and as the location of the everyday `brushes'\nwith neoliberalism that Mirowski (2013) has deftly\nopened-up for analysis. Examples of everyday cultural\nforms, like football, have the potential to enable a\ngranular analysis of the measurement and calculation\nof life, people and experience. Using Mirowski's (2013:\n92) work we can see everyday `neoliberal attitudes,\nimaginaries, and practices' in the production of this\nglobal cultural form. These cultural forms, I would\nsuggest, give us focal points for unravelling and under-\nstanding the politics of data circulations and the place\nof number in contemporary social life.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1.
