Some studies show that older\nadults with high SES have better health than those with\nlow SES,2,15,18 but other studies show that the strength of\nthis association decreases, or even disappears, among\nolder ages.1,5,10 However, there are very few studies\nabout this relationship in developing countries.13,21\nMost experts hold that SES differences in health are\nproduced as a result of various health-related fac-\ntors such as living and working conditions, access to\nhealth care services, social relationships, and diversi-\nfied lifestyles.6,14 SES differentials in health may also\nresult from health selection. People with preexisting\nillness drift down the social scale: those with poor\nhealth are selected into lower SES through decreased\nlabor force participation or through withdrawal from\nSome studies have shown that health variations in adults\nare attributed to both early and later life circumstances,7\nsuggesting that childhood SES has lasting effects on\nhealth beyond its impact on later status attainment.\nOther studies did not find a significant association be-\ntween childhood SES and later health once adult SES\nis taken into account.16\nThe relationship between SES and health is shown to be\nstrong, regardless of how SES is measured, whether via\nis no consensus about the idea that in old ages there is\nno difference in health among different SES.\nAccording to House et al9 social stratification of aging\nand health is produced by social and biological mecha-\nnisms which determine both exposure to and the impact\nof a set of psychological variables. House et al9,10 argued\nthat socioeconomic differences in health (morbidity)\nincrease through early old age and do not converge\nuntil later old age (i.e., age 75 and older).\nDespite the numerous studies about this subject, the\nmajority of them were carried out in developed coun-\ntries and little attention has been given to developing\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate\nthe impact of SES on health in older ages and how\nthis relation changes when controlled for confounding\nINTRODUCTION\n618 Condi\u00e7\u00f5es socioecon\u00f4micas e a sa\u00fade na velhice Ramos M\nvariables in a developing country. The hypothesis is\nthat due to the great distance between social strata and\nunequal access to adequate health care in Brazil, SES\nhas a significant impact on elderly health. The knowl-\nedge about the impact of SES in the elderly health is\ncrucial for developing policies and because older adults,\nparticularly those at more advanced ages, are a fast\ngrowing population segment.\nMETHODS\nThe study was based on cross-sectional data from\nthe Survey on Health, Well-Being, and Aging in\nLatin America and the Caribbean (SABE),* which\nwas funded by the Pan American Health Organization\nand coordinated by the Center for Demography and\nEcology on the University of Wisconsin \u00ad Madison.\nIn Brazil, it was coordinated by Faculdade de Sa\u00fade\nP\u00fablica, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.\nand older living in private households in urban areas\nin the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, during the year 2000. It was\ngenerated through a multistage process by conglomer-\nates with stratification of the units at the highest levels\nof aggregation.\nMost interviews were carried out directly with the\naged and only 12.9% of them were carried out with a\nsubstitute or proxy. However, the main variables were\nnot obtained from questions answered by proxies.\nMissing cases were less than 5%. There were 12% of\nmissing cases for depression symptoms and 16% for\nnumber of diseases under the age of 15. There were\nno significant differences between respondents and\nnon-respondents, tested by logistic regressions on the\nindependent variables.\nIndividual analysis for different age groups were not\nperformed as recommended in the literature (Elder4\n1999) as there were not enough cases for that.\nFour measures of health in adulthood were examined:\nmemory capacity, depression, self-rated health and\nmorbidity.\nMemory capacity was assessed using Folstein8 Mini-\nMental State Examination (MMSE), a recall test, which\nincluded words and numbers showed to subjects in a\ncertain order, in different moments during the interview\nprocess.\nFor studying depression, the Yesavage Geriatric De-\npression Scale24 was used with 15 dummy variables.\nThe number of depressive symptoms was a count of the\naffirmative responses, with three items tapping positive\naffect reverse coded.\nSelf-rated health was based on a 5-point scale ranging\nfrom poor to excellent. This measure captures respon-\ndents' overall assessment of their own medical and\nfunctional status.\nIn regard to morbidity, respondents indicated whether\nthey have ever been told by a doctor that they have/\nhad cancer, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular\ndisease, chronic lung illnesses, high blood pressure or\narthritis/rheumatism. Seven dummy variables indicated\nthe presence of each disease. Prior research7 has shown\nsubstantial agreement between surveys self-reports\nof medical conditions and medical record reports of\nmajor medical conditions in representative samples in\nthe United States. The number of chronic conditions\nwas the total number reported, ranging from zero to\nseven.\nThe independent variable was the adult's SES, corre-\nsponding to respondent's own education, purchasing\npower and main occupation in life. Education was\nmeasured in complete years of schooling.\nPurchasing power was assessed by the ownership of\ngoods, which in Brazil reflect social class position\n(Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisas**\n\u00ad BrazilianAssociation of Marketing Research). Those\nitems are: automobile, refrigerator, washing machine,\nwater boiler, microwave oven, telephone, VCR/DVD\nplayer, stereo system, fan, air conditioner and heater.\nMain occupation was based on the International Stan-\ndard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) of the Inter-\nnational Labor Organization (ILO). Based on Waitzman\n& Smith,23 occupations were added into three categories\nand converted into three dummy variables. The first\ncategory was high status occupation (jobs requiring\nhigh education, offering opportunities, well-paid, and\ninvolving technical work and independent decision\nmaking); the second category was medium status oc-\ncupation (craft jobs requiring some years of education\nand affording latitude in decision making); the third was\nlow status occupation (often machine-paced and subject\nto strict timetables, rules and supervision and with little\nsecurity and opportunity). High status occupation was\nthe reference category in the multivariate models.\nThe variable \"income\" was not used due to the exces-\nsive number of missing cases (86.4%).\nAlthough the literature emphasizes people's childhood\nSES should be known in order to understand adult's\n* Palloni A, Pelaez M, Abdala C, Alfonso JC, Ham-Chande R, Hennis A, Lebr\u00e3o ML, Lesn-Diaz E, Pantelides E, Prats O.

In terms of occupation, subjects tended to\nhave low occupational status (71.3% of the sample),\nwhich was associated with poor self-evaluation of\ntheir SES during childhood (p0.05). Interviewees\nwith low occupational status evaluated their SES dur-\ning childhood as poor as those with high occupational\nstatus, thus showing the predominance of low social\nmobility in Brazil.\nThose who positively rated their health during child-\nhood not always rated their current health in a positive\nway. Specifically, among those who rated their health\nduring childhood as good, 12.1% of them rated their\ngood; 2.4% as very good and 7.3% as excellent. The\nANOVA test for self-rating of health between past and\ncurrent number of diseases was statistically signifi-\ncant: the highest number of diseases is related to the\nlowest health rating categories. The Tukey Post hoc\ntest identified significant differences in terms of the\naverage number of diseases between good and excel-\nlent categories.\nAn ANOVA test showed a significant association be-\ntween self-rating of health and the number of depressive\nsymptoms, where the highest means were seen in the\nlowest health rating categories.There was no significant\ndifference among positive categories.\nAnother ANOVA showed significant association be-\ntween memory capacity and self-rated health, the high-\nest means were in the positive health rating categories\nbut without significant difference between good, very\ngood and excellent categories.\nSelf-rating of health was not affected by childhood\ncharacteristics, differently than that expected (Model\n1; Table 1). Education had a positive effect on the\nsubjective rating of health (Model 2). Even after con-\ntrolling this effect was reduced but still statistically\nsignificant. The purchasing power followed the same\npattern, i.e., after controlling for confounders, it had\na greater effect on self-rated health compared to the\neducation effect. Therefore, only some dimensions of\nSES have an impact on the way Brazilian older adults\nrate their health.\nThe controlling variables that had a negative effect on\nthis indicator of health were: morbidity (number of\ndiseases), depression (number of depressive symptoms)\nand intake of medicines. As expected, self-rating of\nhealth was affected by physical and mental health.\nhealth, this is not problematic in Brazil because social\nand intra-generational mobility is not so frequent.19\nThus self-rated childhood SES was included in the\nmodels as a control.\nControlling variables were the following:\nChildhood SES \u00ad Respondent's rating of SES as a\nchild was coded on a 3-point scale ranging from poor\nto very good.\nChildhood health \u00ad Respondent's rating of health as a\nchild was coded on a 5-point scale ranging from poor to\nexcellent. Although retrospective reports of childhood\nhealth are subject to recall bias and measurement error,\nprevious studies5 found a high level of internal consis-\ntency between reports of general health and specific\nlong-term health limitations in childhood. Other measure\nof childhood health was obtained as a dummy variable\nfrom the question if the subjects had to remain in bed\nat home for one month or more due to a health condi-\ntion under the age of 15. The last measure of childhood\nhealth was the total number of diseases under the age of\n15, which ranged from zero to seven and involved the\nsame set of diseases used to measure adult number of\npresent chronic conditions. Height was also included as a\ncontrol, indicating health problems during childhood.\nOther controlling variables were sex and age, mari-\ntal status, living arrangements, intake of medicines,\nsmoking, category of health insurance, and physical\nexercise, defined as regular physical exercise in the\nlast six months.\nAfter the descriptive analysis, four regression models\nwere constructed for each adult health outcome. Model\n1 included childhood SES and health only. Model 2\nadded SES indicators. Model 3 added other health indi-\ncators in adult life, indicators of comorbidity for each of\nthe dependent variables were included along with age,\ngender and living arrangements. Model 4 added risk\nbehaviors and category of health insurance. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using the SPSS version 14.0.\nMulticolinearity was not a problem.\nRESULTS\nThe scores for memory capacity were summed and total\nwith an alpha coefficient of 0.77.

Physical activities appeared to contribute for\nreducing the current number of diseases.\nThe multivariate analysis showed that education had a\nsignificant positive impact on memory capacity even\nafter controlling for confounders (Table 3).

However, the effect of occupation disappeared in\nthe presence of controls related to current health status.\nAge had an important impact on memory capacity, as\nmemory capacity decreases with aging.

Education had a weak effect on depression, which\nwas no longer seen after controlling. The only SES in-\ndicator that had a significant negative effect on depres-\nsion was purchasing power. Age, physical activity and\nsmoking had a negative impact on depression. Women\nreported fewer depressive symptoms than men.\nDISCUSSION\nExcept for morbidity, at least one indicator of SES had\na significant effect on other three health indicators (self-\nrated health, memory capacity and depression).\nThe lack of SES effect on morbidity can be explained\nby the study sample, which comprised elderly people in\nTable 3. Multivariate models predicting memory capacity of the elderly. S\u00e3o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, 2000.\nVariable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nb  b  b  b \nSelf-evaluation of SES during\nchildhood\nSelf-evaluation of health during\nchildhood\nNumber of diseases under the age\nHad to remain in bed at home due to\na health condition under the age of 15\nStandard errors in the parentheses\nwhom the majority of diseases are related to the aging\nprocess. Thus, these diseases could not be prevented or\npostponed even if these people would have knowledge\ngained through education.\nThose subjects who rated their health during their\nchildhood as poor now rate it positively. This may be\ndue to the many health problems suffered in the past,\nthat nowadays, with the new generation of medicines\nand vaccination available, they can better manage\ntheir health. Thus, they tend to positively rate their\ncurrent health. To verify this assumption, an ANOVA\nwas performed to test these differences, but it was not\nstatistically significant. With regard to other health\nmeasures, there were no variables available to verify\nthis association.\nThe association between education and memory ca-\npacity is possible to be explained in the sense that it is\nexpected that those older adults with more educational\nresources (formal knowledge) should be those who\nexercise more their memory functions.\nThe impact of purchasing power on memory capacity\ncan be understood in the extent to which those older\nadults who have more access to certain types of goods,\nlike those related to communication and media resourc-\nes, can have more chance to exercise their memory.\nThe effect of high status occupation on memory capac-\nity is explained by the fact that high status occupations\nare those that involve more intellectual challenges than\nthe low status occupations, these last involve more\nmanual activities.\nOne explanation to the positive and significant impact\nof childhood health on adult depression could be that\nthe severity of childhood health problems are more\nimportant than the absolute number of conditions on\nmental health status later in life. The negative impact\nof smoking on depression can be related to the fact that\nnicotine has a stimulating effect on mood.\nThe impact of number of diseases during childhood on\nadult depression happens because many diseases can\ncause limitations and dependency. Unfortunately the\ninformation about disability could not be used in this\nstudy due to excessive number of missing cases.\nThe fact that only purchasing power has an impact on\ndepression can be explained by the huge inequality of\nBrazilian society and, as mentioned before, low social\nmobility. Thus, Brazilians tend to value the ownership\nof certain goods, not only as a way to have access to a\nvariety of resources and social position but also to be\nsocially recognized and accepted.3\nThe present study has potentially important implications\nas it shows health cannot be approached as a unique\nhomogeneous concept and can provide information for\ndeveloping social policies. Also, it confirms that SES\nand childhood events are important to explain elderly\nhealth problems. This emphasizes the importance of\npreventive policies not only for older adults but also\nfor early ages.\nOther strength of the study is the use of a life course per-\nspective in a developing country context, even though\nthere was no longitudinal data available. It is possible to\nargue that taking childhood characteristics into account\nprovided information about subject's life course. Some\nhealth indicators in adult later life may be the outcome\nof a variety of childhood conditions and experiences.12\nBy using those retrospective questions was possible, at\nsome extent, to compensate for the fact there was no\nlongitudinal data to use a life course perspective.\nHowever, the present study has some limitations. First,\nit was not possible to check whether the impact of SES\non health varies by age group as there were not enough\ncases in each group to perform individual analysis. Sec-\nond, income was not used in the study due to the exces-\nsive number of missing cases.Third, as aforementioned,\ndata were gathered at one point in time and therefore\nit was not possible to conclude that SES causes health\nproblems in late life. However, other studies10,15 have\nnot shown evidence of reverse causality, that is, that\npoor health conditions lead to low SES. Another inter-\npretation problem of cross-sectional studies is survival\nbias. It is expected that subjects with poor childhood\nSES have lower survival rates. However, it is possible\nthat low social mobility in Brazil tends to attenuate the\ndifferences between those who survived.\nA fourth limitation arises from the fact that data were\nbased solely from self-reports and childhood events\nusing retrospective questions. However, it is believed\nthat whenever people are informed by their doctor they\nhave a health problem it means a real and serious health\nproblem. There is controversy in the literature over the\nreliability and validity of retrospective reports of health\nevents. There is clearly no way to deal with this issue\ngiven the data available in the present study.\nAnother limitation is the external validity. This sample\nis representative of a major Brazilian city and a destina-\ntion of migrants from other parts of the country but it\ncannot be assured these results can be generalized to\nthe whole country.\nRegardless of those limitations, the study results\nshowed a relationship between SES and health status\nin late life in developing countries, and also a need for\nfurther longitudinal research in these countries.\nIn conclusion, the study results do not fully corroborate\nprevious results of other studies that there is a lack of\nassociation between SES and health among elderly\npopulation. However, they show that not all SES in-\ndicators have an effect on specific health dimensions.\nThere is a need for developing policies taking into\naccount different health dimensions and different SES\nindicators individually.\n624 Condi\u00e7\u00f5es socioecon\u00f4micas e a sa\u00fade na velhice Ramos M\n1.
