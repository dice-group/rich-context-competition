    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn 2010, nearly 400 million women worldwide were of menopause age (45-54).Although many women transition through\nmenopause with ease, some experience distress and a subsequent decrease in quality of life.The purpose of this qualitative\nstudy was to examine the experiences of distress in women during the menopause transition.A narrative analysis methodology\nwas used maintaining participants' complete narratives when possible.In-person interviews of 15 midlife women were digitally\naudio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Women shared narratives of distress related to menstrual changes, emotional\ninstability, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido affected by their relationships with self, partners, work, and family. Some\nexperiences were presented against a backdrop of the past and influenced by concerns for the future. Detailed stories\nilluminated the effect that distressful symptoms had on quality of life and captured how intricately woven symptoms were\nwith the women's interpersonal and social lives.\n",

Although many\nwomen transition through menopause with minimal discom-\nfort, studies have shown that some women experience distress\nduring the menopause transition (Alexander et al., 2007;\n2005). In addition, for some women, a decreased quality of\nlife is an unfortunate consequence of distressful symptoms\nduring the menopause transition (Avis et al., 2009; Bl\u00fcmel\nTreatment for women during the menopausal transition,\nspecifically hormone therapy (HT), has raised concerns for\nclinicians and women (Theroux, 2010; Writing Group for\nthe Women's Health Initiative [WHI], 2002). More than\never before, women seek alternatives such as herbs, soy\nproducts, and natural hormones (Hill-Sakurai, Muller, &\ndoes not consistently support the efficacy and safety of\nsuch treatments (Files, Ko, & Pruthi, 2011; Lethaby et al.,\n2007). For women whose lives have become disrupted, the\nmedical community becomes a source of support as they\nseek explanations and assistance for their concerns\n(Ayuranci, Orsal, Arslan, & Emeksiz, 2010; Bl\u00fcmel et al.,\nHowever, when women present with symptoms attributed to\nmenopause, the depth and breadth of the women's experi-\nences elude the health care practitioner and few options\nexist. What lacks is a clearer understanding of women's\nmenopausal symptoms within the context of their lives\nBackground\nA challenge in the study of distress during the menopause\ntransition is that distress may mean different things to differ-\nent people, including women and scientists. The inscrutability\nof distress as a concept precludes the ease by which it can be\ndefined, understood, and measured (Mass\u00e9, 2000). Generally,\nresearch foci tend to reflect three aspects of distress during\nmenopause: (a) the primary experience of distress--anxiety,\nirritability, angst, depression--often attributed to potential\nneuroendocrine changes in the brain (Finset, Overlie, & Holte,\n1University of San Francisco, CA, USA\n2Yale School of Nursing, New Haven, CT, USA\n3Family Health Care Nursing, University of California San Francisco,\nCorresponding Author:\nMarcianna Nosek, School of Nursing and Health Professions, University of\nEmail: mnosek@usfca.edu\nDistress During the MenopauseTransition:\nA Rich Contextual Analysis of Midlife\nWomen's Narratives\nMarcianna Nosek1, Holly Powell Kennedy2, and Maria Gudmundsdottir3\n Keywords\nmenopause transition, distress, midlife women, symptoms, context, nurse midwives/practitioners, quality of life\n2 SAGE Open\nSteiner, Dunn, & Born, 2003; Woods, Carr, Tao, Taylor, &\nMitchell, 2006); (b) a secondary response to the intensity\nand impact of empirically supported symptoms related\nto menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal\ndryness (Avis, Crawford, Stellato, & Longcope, 2001; Brown,\nGallicchio, Flaws, & Tracy, 2009; Guthrie, Dennerstein,\nTaffe, Lehert, & Burger, 2004); or (c) psychological states\nresulting from the emotional responses to menopause or aging\n(Lindh-A, Hoffmann, Hammar, & Kjellgren, 2007; Ogle\n& Damhorst, 2005), inability to cope with stressors (Bauld &\ndifficult life trajectories (Alexander et al., 2007), or innate\npersonality traits that cause excessive stress reactions to\nmidlife challenges (Bosworth, Bastian, Rimer, & Siegler,\nwoman experiencing distress, the contextual background\nof her life will shape her experience (Strauss, 2011); yet this\nis nearly impossible to quantify through the use of instrumen-\ntation (Mass\u00e9, 2000). The scope of her experience is beyond\na questionnaire.\nIn a review of studies on menopause, Utian (2005b)\ndeclared there is strong evidence to support that only vaso-\nmotor symptoms and vaginal dryness can be directly attrib-\nuted to the endocrinological changes occurring during the\nmenopausal transition. However, he also emphasized that\nsocial, cultural, psychological, and environmental factors\ncan influence the variety of responses that midlife women\nhave to various symptoms, and that there is a \"need to\nunderstand the factors that determine this variation in\nresponse\" (Utian, 2005b, p. 8). In addition, Woods and\nMitchell (2005) raised the concern that \"clinicians do not\nhave access to data about the meaning women assign to\ntheir experiences\" (p. 155). Although efforts have been\nmade quantitatively and qualitatively to study the psycho-\nsocial tapestry of midlife women, researchers have failed to\ncapture the details of the rich contextual background of\nwomen's experiences of distress in menopause.\nA midlife woman's life is complex; she is situated--\nphysically, hormonally, emotionally--in her changing body.\nShe also resides within her social, cultural, and economic\nenvironment. Although she has been the focus of a multi-\ntude of studies, the factors examined cannot wholly explain\nwhy some women experience distress during a normal\nreproductive transition such as menopause. An in-depth\nunderstanding of the physiological, psychological, social,\nand cultural influences of women's experiences of distress\nduring the menopause transition is lacking. Therefore, to gain\na fuller understanding of the phenomenon, the purpose of the\nstudy was to investigate the various experiences of distress\nthat women report during the menopausal transition.\nThe aim of this article is to present the analysis on the\nspecific context of symptom experience as part of a larger\nNosek, Kennedy, & Gudmundsdottir, 2010). The main\nresearch question of the study was as follows:\nResearch Question 1: From the perspective of the\nwoman during the menopause transition (meno-\npausal years), what is the essential experience of\ndistress?\nMethod\nThis study used a narrative analysis methodology (Riessman,\n1993). As a way to counter more abstract ideas, narratives\ncreate a concrete avenue to explore the understanding of\nhuman existence in relation to an individual's interaction\nwith the world (van Manen, 1990). Examining the rich con-\ntextual layers of women's lives through shared stories of\nlived experiences allows for the salience of shared meaning\nembedded in the social, cultural, and intersubjective life\nParticipants and Recruitment\nWomen, between the ages of 40 and 60, who were currently\nexperiencing or had previously experienced distress attributed\nto menopause and were English speaking, were considered\nwomen who had experienced symptoms as a result of natural\nmenopause or at least had intact ovaries were considered\nunless the symptoms reported were prior to an oophorectomy.\nEfforts were made to include women of diverse ethnic, racial,\nand cultural backgrounds to gain a broad representation of\nstudy aimed to capture women who attributed their symptom\nexperience to menopause, no diagnosing of menopause status\nwas required other than what the women reported. Women\nwho were not currently experiencing, or did not in the past\nexperience, distress during the menopause transition were\nexcluded because the specific focus of this study was on\nwomen who self-identified as experiencing distress attributed\nto menopause.\nMost study participants responded to advertisements on\nan online community volunteer board or to flyers at grocery\nstores posted in two cities in California, USA. The remaining\nwomen were recruited through word of mouth or through\nsnowballing techniques. A total of 15 women participated\nand were offered US$20.00 for each interview.\nData Collection and Analysis\nParticipants were interviewed in person using an open-\nended interview guide and each interview was digitally\naudio recorded. The principal investigator conducted all\ninterviews of the women who were interviewed once, for\n45 min to 2 hr at a confidential place of their choice. A short\nquestionnaire was used to assess demographics such as age,\nmarital status, number of children, education level, and\nincome. Each woman was first asked to share her experi-\nences of menopause and to add any specific stories that\nNosek et al. 3\nwould elucidate the distress of her experiences. Email\ncorrespondence was also included as data. All data were\nAudio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim\nby a professional transcriber who included interviewer's\nquestions and participants' utterances, hesitations, false\nstarts, and phrases to denote expressions such as laughter\nand intonation changes such as a whisper or loudness of\nvoice. After organizing transcribed interviews in the\nATLAS.ti 5.0 computer program, the interviews were read\nseveral times with attention paid to emerging narratives and\nthemes. In addition, audio recordings were listened to\nduring the analyses to capture these fluctuations that aided\nin the interpretation of the narratives. Elements from\nand van Manen's (1990) methods were used for data analy-\nsis. Each offer a different method of analyzing the data but\nall the methods are within a narrative analysis methodology\nthat emphasizes the identification of stories/narratives as a\nway of accessing insight to how individuals make sense of\nthemselves and their external world (Frost, 2009). Gee's\npoetic structures were employed for the discussion of find-\nings from the larger study published elsewhere (Nosek,\n2012) and was especially useful in the relaying of chaos\nnarratives that appeared to have no apparent restitution\nNarratives used for this article particularly lent themselves\nwell to be re-transcribed for analysis per Labov (1997)\nbecause they contained elements of a true story with the des-\nignated components: A = abstract (where narrators denote the\nbeginning of a story), O = orientation (where we are oriented\nto time, place, and characters of the story), CA = complica-\ntion action (where actions of the story unfold), E = evaluation\n(where narrators offer their emotional response or interpreta-\ntion of the unfolded actions), R = resolution (where actions or\ncrises are resolved), and C = coda (where we are brought\nback to present denoting the end of the story). The re-\ntranscription of the narratives into elements of a story\nafforded the salience of what the narrator found important\nto relay, with special attention payed to the evaluation as it\nreflects the narrator's interpretation of the event, and the\nmeaning ascribed to it. Whenever possible, narratives were\nleft whole to maintain the integral threads of participants'\nvoices and lives. Further details of data collection and analy-\nsis are reported elsewhere (Nosek et al., 2010).\nEthical Considerations\nThe study received ethical approval by the University of\nCalifornia San Francisco's (UCSF) Committee on Human\nResearch. Written informed consent was obtained from\neach participant. Confidentiality and the right of refusal\nat anytime were stressed. Pseudonyms chosen by partici-\npants were used in all documentation and recording of\ndata.\nStudy Rigor\nSeveral practices were employed throughout the study that\naimed to establish methodological rigor (Riessman, 1993).\nTrustworthiness and credibility were enhanced by including\ndirect quotes from participants' interviews, incorporating\nmember checking, using a research team for analysis, focusing\non structure (where stories fell within the text, the utterances,\ntone, and volume used) and texture/content (the words chosen,\nthe interpretations of experiences given by participants), and\nspending adequate time with the text to allow for \"thick\" inter-\npretation (see Nosek et al., 2010, for further details regarding\nstudy rigor).\nFindings\nSample Characteristics\ninterviewed for up to 2 hr each. The youngest participant\nstated she began experiencing symptoms of menopause at\nage 31. Close to half of the women were still in menopause\ntransition, and the rest were post menopause. A diverse\nsample was achieved with ethnic/racial backgrounds that\nincluded Latin, Caucasian, and African American. In all, 7 of\nthe women were married or living with a partner, whereas 8\nwere single or divorced. The women's employment included\na range of occupations, and they were well educated and\nevenly distributed across income levels (see Table 1).\nSymptom Experience\nThe women reported a range of distressing symptoms such as\nhot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, decreased libido,\nmood changes, menstrual changes, and sleep disruption\n(Nosek et al., 2010; see also Table 1). Findings on a theme\nrelated to the stigma of menopause (Nosek et al., 2010), a first\nperson composite narrative of women's experiences (Wertz,\nNosek, McNiesh, & Marlow, 2011), and a case study on one\nwoman's transformative journey (Nosek, 2012) have been\npreviously reported. The findings reported here are exemplars\npresented as full narratives that elucidate specific symptoms\nof menstrual changes, mood alterations, vaginal dryness, and\ndecreased libido. Included also are narratives that portray the\nconsequential impact on quality of life as a result of symptom\nexperiences. Rich details of how the contextual backdrop of\ntheir lives pertaining to work, relationships, sexuality, and\nidentity threads through their experiences will be particularly\nhighlighted and maintained via the presentation of complete\nnarratives when possible.\nMenstrual Changes\nMenstrual cycles that were unpredictable, painful, and\nheavy were reported by some of the women. One woman\n(pseudonym China) described the change in her menstrual\n4 SAGE Open\ncycles as her main concern in menopause. China was 40\nyears old at the time of the interview, and reported her\nsymptoms began when she was in her 30s. She listed other\nsymptoms such as urinary tract infections and sleep disrup-\ntion, and then illustrated how she arrived at determining\nher symptoms were due to menopause. \"`You're a classic\ncase,' I've heard it over and over, you know, `for meno-\npause.'\"\nChina occasionally worked as a football game concession\nworker. She narrated how the unexpected happened one day\nwhen she was at work. Her narrative is left intact except for\nthe exclusion of utterances and is presented using Labov's\nI'm getting to the end of it [period] now. (A)\nI got my period a week and a half ago (O)\nand I had to [work] a football game\nand I was crying, and I thought I had to go pee and\nI didn't. (CA)\nAnd I . . . I didn't get a break. I had to beg for one.\nI thought I had to [pee] and it turns out it's my period\n. . .\nIt started out as a good day. By the end of it was bad. (E)\nIt was a disaster . . . (E)\nIt was horrible. Horrible. (E)\nHad I totally expected it and then,\nit would have been better. (CA)\nI just felt horrible. I felt crampy. I felt both. (E)\nI'm dealing with football fans and it's terrible.\nSo it was like the whole package.\nI had to beg for a break because I didn't know what\nwas going on. (R)\nI'm talking about like seven hours later.\nAnd they didn't give me my ten-minute break.\nOh I'm debating whether I want to go back and it's not\nlaziness. (C)\nWell don't you think they'll think I'm lazy? (E)\nChina brought to attention the distress related to the\nunexpected nature of the experience. However, not only did\nChina have to deal with the physical symptoms of bleeding\nand cramping, but the demands of the work environment\nalso greatly affected the situation causing her more distress.\nAmid her discomfort, she was unable to even take a 10-min\nbreak. She worried that if she did not return, they would\nthink she was lazy. China clearly painted a picture of a\nwoman anything but lazy, but the unfortunate reality of oth-\ners' inability to ever know what she experienced lingered in\nthe aftermath of her story. The experienced distress becomes\nsalient as she describes the unfolding of the day as it started\nout \"good\" and slowly turned \"bad.\" China's evaluative\nstatements, such as \"horrible\" (used repetitively) and \"disas-\nTable 1.

The pause\nthat occurred in between the repetition of \"horrible\" as well as\nthe decreased tone of her voice to nearly a whisper contrib-\nuted to the listener's understanding of the narrator's anguish.\nMood Alterations\nEmotional changes that also seemed to be unpredictable\nwith rapid onsets concerned many of the women, and\nreports of their partners, family members, and they them-\nselves not recognizing who they have become demonstrated\nthe accompanied angst it caused. Martha's main distressful\nepisode was experienced in the context of a relatively stable\nwork and personal life. Her relationship, a long-term\nmarriage of 25 years, was generally a source of support for\nher. Her sons were grown and living outside the home. The\nfollowing narrative about her primary experience of distress\nwas shared at the very beginning of the interview. Her main\nexperience of distress was an emotional episode that lasted\nonly a day or two, but the fear of it repeating and the impact\nthat it could have on her marriage and work propelled her\nto seek immediate treatment. The re-transcription of\nher narrative per Labov's (1997) recommendation affords\nthe reader the ability to follow the unfolding events and\nelements of this one point in time story.\nUm, but the thing . . . that was really bad (A)\nwas I just suddenly started feeling (O)\nso mentally out of it . . . just crazy. (CA)\nLike just very suddenly I felt . . . anxious.\nUh, I felt anxious. I felt paranoid. (CA)\nI felt just really, really crazy.\nAnd it was like so out of context with my life, but I\n. . . I (E)\njust really felt like it had . . . it must be hormonal . . .\n(E)\nIt just . . . it was just so off the scale for me. (E)\nI just went running to the doctor to get hormones, (R)\nI knew I was either going to lose my relationship,\nor I (raising volume) was going to lose my job,\nor I was just going to lose my mind.\nIt's just like that bad. (E)\nI cannot possibly function in my life with this. (E)\nSo, it's . . . it's hard to explain, you know.\nSudden mental illness. (laughter release)\nBut I just felt so crazy and awful and, you know, just\nanxious. (CA)\nAnd just like I wanted to jump out of my skin. (C)\nMartha emphasized the unexpectedness of her experience\nby using the word sudden twice in the first couple of lines\nand juxtaposed it with the contrast of her normal state of\nbeing. She stressed that she did not recall ever having any\nincidence like this in the past. Past and future merge in the\npresent moment of her episode. Loss was the main fear for\nthe future against the backdrop of a previously calm mind,\nand secure job and relationship. Her voice rose during this\npart of the story accompanied by a serious toned laughter as\nif the incredulousness of the situation was bordering on\nabsurd.\nCandy also shared concerns about mood changes. She\nrelayed a story that included multiple family members, her\ncoworkers, her husband, and her cat. Her mother brought to\nher attention that her \"whole attitude has changed.\" Her\ndaughter reprimanded her for \"snapping\" at her grandmother.\nShe was \"edgy\" at work because of \"the changes.\" Her hus-\nband just \"backs off and he leaves [her] alone.\" When asked\nwhat she found the most distressful about this, she concluded\nwith, \"My attitude, like I said it scares, it scares me. It really\ndoes because it's like I'm a different, totally different per-\nson.\" Candy expressed fear about not recognizing the person\nshe had become. She came to this realization in relation to\nwhat was normal for her in the past. She relayed what was\nimportant to her--familiarity of self, and her relationships--\nat home and at work.\nVaginal Dryness\nFay lived with her boyfriend who was 12 years younger\nthan she. This age dynamic became salient at other points\nduring her interview. She relayed that a great source of her\ndistress stemmed from vaginal dryness during intercourse.\nThe following narrative describes one particular night of\nlovemaking with her boyfriend and her ensuing distress.\nThis narrative was also re-transcribed using Labov's (1997)\nmethod because it contained all elements of a true story.\nWell I can give you a specific day. Um (pause) . . . (A)\nI was going through having sex with my boyfriend (O)\nand I was really enjoying it,\nand all of a sudden I got really, really dry. (CA)\nAnd he's taking an antidepressant--It took him longer.\nAnd it began to really be painful. (E)\nAnd he didn't want to stop (CA)\nbecause it meant that he'd have to build up impetus\nagain, (E)\nand I had to forcibly ask him to stop and use a\nlubricant, (R)\nbecause it was getting painful (E)\nand I didn't want to tell him it was getting painful (CA)\nbecause he was . . . I knew if he was hurting me he\nwould stop. (E)\nHe wouldn't want to go on.\nAnd um, I just couldn't get through to him (CA)\nbecause he couldn't tell that I needed lubrication\nand it was just a painful reminder that I'm getting\nold. (E)\nSo now we keep a ton of lubricant by the bed. (R) (C)\n6 SAGE Open\nThe iterative use of \"and\" revealed by the re-transcription\nof the narrative draws attention to the incessant layers of the\nevent. The complexity of a symptom such as vaginal dryness\nunfolds as Fay relays details of one experience. Even after\n\"forcing\" her boyfriend to stop and use lubrication seems to\nresolve the problem, Fay continues on to emphasize the dif-\nficulty in achieving resolution and the meaning it had for\nher. We see how Fay's boyfriend's personal circumstance\nwith depression and subsequent use of antidepressants\naffected his ability to reach orgasm, and amassed the distress\nrelated to Fay's vaginal dryness. Yet, the fact that she \"didn't\nwant to tell him\" when it began hurting implied a strong\nneed to care for him and his sexual needs. The 12-year-age\ndifference between Fay and her boyfriend shaped her experi-\nence of this symptom reflected in her final evaluation that\nthe whole episode was a reminder of aging. This profoundly\nportrayed the intensity of the meaning of the experience for\nher. She chose to discount his contribution to the problem\nand placed the onus on herself.\nDecreased Libido\nMartha told of her decreased sexual drive as she shared her\nconcerns: \"The other thing that uh, that was distressing to\nme um, was that my libido was really low . . . It's just got-\nten worse and worse. I don't like it at all.\" She elaborated\nabout why this was distressful to her. \"That's distressing\nbecause I think oh, you know, is this guy going to stay with\nme if I don't want to have sex, you know?\" The gravity of\nher concern was revealed as she emphasized that \"it's\nreally not a good thing.\" The decrease in libido highlighted\nthe context of her concern as she worried about the effect\nit might have on her relationship. Decreased libido in and\nof itself was not an issue for Martha; it was the potential\nloss that could occur as a result that troubled her.\nA decrease in libido among married women was not\nalways presented as causing distress in the woman's life as\nwas the case for Martha. Elizabeth, a 55-year-old woman\nwho had been married for many years, actually welcomed\nthe change in focus that a decrease in libido afforded. She\nlamented that her previous focus on sex prevented her from\ndoing things such as \"research this historical period, or go\nmake a quilt or go dancing.\" However, she revealed the key\nto her success as a married woman with a newfound\ndecreased interest in sex was that her husband had decreased\ninterest also. \"And it works in my relationship with my hus-\nband and . . . that's all that matters. And . . . that's what\nmatters.\" Her relationship was not threatened by her lack of\nlibido, in contrast with Martha's experience, and that's \"all\nthat [mattered].\"\nWork environments, relationships, concerns for the\nfuture, and comparisons with the past affected the women's\nexperiences of distress. The context of their lives contributed\nto, or more accurately constituted, the distress experienced\nby the women.\nQuality of Life\nVarious consequences occurred as a result of the women's\nmenopausal experiences. Some women were concerned that\ntheir symptoms would occur in the middle of a social situa-\ntion and that they would be unable to manage their discom-\nfort and thus would avoid socializing, or some would change\nlifestyles to compensate--ultimately causing a decrease in\nquality of life. The following stories depict the consequences\nof participants' experiences that contributed to their distress.\nWhat was most significant for China was the develop-\nment of menopausal symptoms early in life. She addressed\nhow menopause began taking a \"toll\" on her life quality. The\nsudden onset of symptoms precluded her from engaging\nsocially for she felt her reaction to them would affect her\nability to behave in an acceptable manner. China expressed\nthe distress of this as she explained that she withdrew because\nshe did not \"want to lash out at people and be in pain and\nhunched over.\" She felt robbed of her youth elaborating,\n\"I haven't dated in (pause) 2 years or had a boyfriend in 6.\nAnd it just didn't feel good.\" The following narrative by\nChina demonstrates how severely China's social life had\nbeen altered by her symptoms.\nYou're going to laugh at this one. (A)\nThis isn't even a physical thing.\nThis was a day I was actually feeling good.\nI'll tell what was the most distressing one.\nI was going through my temp series; I had ended\na job. (O)\nAnd I'm going down, I'm in the elevator . . .\nand I don't know if they were lawyers or accountants\n. . .\nget on board. Just asked me if um, (CA)\nI wanted to join them. I mean as a friend . . . (CA)\nI was like I was feeling better but I was like,\nwhat if I see them again? (E)\nWhat if I come here again? What if I don't feel\ngood? (E)\nWhat if something . . . what if? You know. (sad voice)\nI was worried . . . (E)\nand I was actually feeling one of my better days.\nIt was distressing . . . (E)\nIt's like what if I wasn't feeling good and they're won-\ndering (CA)\nwhat's wrong with me and . . . They'd be wondering\nwhy is she so unfriendly? (CA)\nI didn't want to come off as being unfriendly.\nAnd he was . . . they were disappointed. (E)\nThat's how the whole thing came up. (C)\nChina hesitated to join the party out of fear of what might\nhappen in the future. She worried about the future as she\nfeared seeing the men at a later time when she was having\nsymptoms. It was a fear of what might happen, not only in\nNosek et al. 7\nthe immediate future but anytime later, that stopped her from\nparticipating in a simple social event. This clearly demon-\nstrated the social impact of her symptoms on her life and the\nsubsequent distress.\nNancy's main distress was due to frequent and intense hot\nflashes describing, \"as soon as one would go away within the\nnext half hour, one would come back.\" The frequency and\nduration of both the hot flash itself and its \"gradual\" dissipa-\ntion created an almost continuous sensation. They affected\nevery part of her life. She quit her gym membership because\nworking out caused an increase in hot flashes. Even reading\na newspaper became difficult: \"If I was reading something\nand . . . and I had a hot flash, I'd probably quit . . . it would\nbe distractive. I would lose the point of the article.\"\nSusan Jane addressed a decrease in quality of life as a\nresult of her 9 months of night sweats. She elaborated, \"For\nme it was such a decline in the quality of my life and in the\nquality of my physicality and the enjoyment of my sexuality\nthat it wasn't worth it.\" She spoke of \"riding a wave of\necstasy\" until her menopause hit and declared, \"that's all\nover with, like all this work you've done, you're back to\nsquare one.\" Her recap of this loss was \"a death beyond a\ndeath within a death.\" Juxtaposing who she was before\nmenopause with who she became post menopause clearly\nportrayed the drastic changes that had occurred for Susan\nJane as well as the subsequent distress (see Nosek, 2012, for\ncase study of Susan Jane's experience).\nThe individual experiences of participants' symptoms\nvaried according to the circumstances and context of the\nwomen's lives and encompassed interpersonal, social, and\nwork situations. The consequences of symptoms manifested\nin a decreased quality of life for many of the women as they\nattempted to make sense of their embodied changes.\nDiscussion\nThis article focused on the specific contextual background\nof women's experiences while adhering closely to the wom-\nen's narratives. The intact narratives reported in this study\ncaptured a rich life world perspective and facilitated the\nknowledge gained by closely examining the nuances and\nintricate web of midlife women's symptom experiences\nattributed to menopause. Other findings from the original\nstudy have been reported elsewhere and demonstrate the use\nNosek et al., 2010); however, in this article, the narratives\nshared were mostly told as complete stories that warranted\nthe use of Labov's (1997) method. Nonnarrative segments\nby Susan Jane and Nancy that portrayed the effect of symp-\ntoms on their quality of life, and Candy as she spoke of her\nchanges in mental state.\nThese findings demonstrated how the immediate world of\nthe participants affected their distress, as well as how their\nsymptom experiences affected their ability to interact with\ntheir immediate world. The temporal contexts of women's\nlives became salient as their present situations arose from a\ncomparison with past circumstances, and poised against\nfuture concerns. In previous studies, references to past are\nused generally from a life course perspective, where women's\nstressful pasts are demonstrated to predict symptom experi-\nences later in life (Kuh et al., 2002; Schmidt, Murphy, Haq,\nRubinow, & Danaseau, 2004). However, they often imply\nthat midlife challenges are just another crisis along the dis-\nruptive life trajectory of some women indicating an innate or\nlearned inability to cope. Future is examined in a manner\nsuch as Reynolds's (2000) study on catastrophizing where\nassociations between distress and \"despairing anticipations\nabout the future\" are found (p. 114). Using those frameworks,\nwomen are seen as inflating situations or lacking ability to\ncontrol reactions to current circumstances. The stories told in\nthis study portray women as having reasonable concerns for\nthe future situated in socially and culturally shared values and\nlife experiences. For example, the fact that Candy was expe-\nriencing symptoms much earlier than her peers most likely\nhad contributed to her distress. Not only did she experience\nfeeling \"robbed of her youth,\" but she may also have lacked a\npeer group to share with or gain support from.\nStudies have examined other social factors of women's\ndistress and have found associations with social support,\npresence of teens in the house, marital satisfaction, and dif-\nficulties with family members (Avis et al., 2003; Chedraui,\n(2003) found that being married increased quality of life in\nmidlife women across four ethnic groups. Many of the\nwomen's narratives in this study involved partners. Martha's\nmarital status contributed to her experiences of distress\nmainly for fear of losing her partner due to her emotional\ninstability and decreased libido. Conversely, Elizabeth's\ndecreased libido was not a problem for her because of her\nhusband's acceptance of it, which was \"all that mattered.\"\nFay's being partnered contributed to some of her distress\nbecause of the conflicting circumstances between their sex-\nual needs. Hinchliff, Gott, and Ingleton (2010) conducted a\nqualitative analysis of women's sexual relationships during\nmenopause and demonstrated similar variations in women's\nsexual experiences that were greatly dependent on the con-\ntextual tapestry that existed between the women and their\nsexual partners.\nSome researchers have proposed that having multiple roles,\nincluding work outside the house, can buffer distressful meno-\npausal experiences as they may increase women's feelings of\nself-esteem and self-efficacy (Strauss, 2011). In this study,\nwomen either feared their symptoms would interfere in their\nability to perform at work or work conditions exacerbated\ntheir difficulty in managing their symptoms.\nQuality-of-life effects, commonly examined in studies of\nmenopause, attempt to grasp the severity of symptom experi-\nence. However, the instruments used often fall short of\nunveiling the specifics of how the women's lives are affected\n8 SAGE Open\nUtian (2005a) addressed how vasomotor symptoms can\naffect women's quality of life, but added that the \"effects\nare difficult to quantify because of the many factors that\ncontribute to overall QOL satisfaction\" (p. 3). Conversely,\n\"many factors\" of the participants' lives in this report were\nilluminated via the rich stories that the women shared of\ntheir distressful experiences. Avis and colleagues (2009)\nreported that all menopausal symptoms examined in their\nstudy of midlife women were significantly positively\nrelated to reduced function on all five domains of a quality-\nof-life measurement. This is important to report, but again,\ntheir data founder to enlighten researchers and clinicians of\nany specific contextual details of the impact of symptoms\non the women's lives, as well as how the everyday worlds\nof the women contribute to the symptoms experienced.\nLimitations\nInterviewing partners and family members of women may\nhave illuminated the extended impact of women's distress. In\naddition, only heterosexual and able-bodied women partici-\npated. Experiences of lesbian and physically challenged\nwomen would have greatly enhanced the findings.\nConclusion\nExperts in the field have recommended the exploration of the\nsociocultural elements of menopause experiences (Utian,\nrevealed complex interpersonal and social elements of symp-\ntom experience during the menopause transition. Moreover, the\nframework and method used in this study afforded the rich\nexamination of interactions between women's experiences and\ntheir surroundings in a more informative manner. Qualitative\ndata allow for a more in-depth view of participants' lives, but\nmore often than not, reports are given as a thematic analysis\nonly, with very brief supportive excerpts. Keeping a narrative\nintact reveals much more of the intricacies of experiences,\nincluding the players involved, the everyday meaning persons\nplace on these experiences, and the efforts involved in creating\nresolutions. The understanding gained from this narrative\nanalysis of women's experiences increases the awareness of a\npotentially misunderstood group of women.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This study was\nfunded by a Betty Irene Moore Nursing Doctoral Scholarship.\nReferences\nAlexander, J.
