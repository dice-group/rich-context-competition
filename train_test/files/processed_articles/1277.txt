Persons 60 years of age,\nAfrican Americans, and Mexican Americans were over-\nsampled. After being interviewed in their homes, the par-\nticipants were invited to attend one of three examination\nsessions (morning, afternoon, or evening) in a mobile ex-\namination center.\nMeasurements\nBody measurements of survey participants were taken\nusing standardized methods and equipment. For all mea-\nsures, NHANES participants wore underwear, disposable\npaper gowns, paper pants, and foam rubber slippers. WC\nwas measured using a steel measuring tape to the nearest 0.1\ncm at the high point of the iliac crest at minimal respiration\n(15\u00ad18). Weight was measured on a Toledo self-zeroing\nweight scale (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH), and height\nwas measured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.\nBMI was calculated from measured weight and height and\nwas categorized into three groups (normal, 25 kg/m2;\naccording to World Health Organization criteria (19). Other\nvariables included in the analyses were sex, age, race/\nethnicity (i.e., white, African-American, Mexican-Ameri-\ncan, and other), and years of education.\nStatistical Analysis\nThis study analyzed the mean WC and the prevalence of\nabdominal obesity in men and non-pregnant women 20\nin men and 88 cm in women, based on criteria from the\nNCEP ATP III (8). The prevalence of abdominal obesity,\ndefined by ethnic-specific cut-off points as proposed by the\nInternational Diabetes Federation (9), was calculated. To\ndemonstrate the overall changes in the past 15 years and in\nthe most recent 4 years in mean WC and in the prevalence\nof abdominal obesity, the total differences in the estimates\nnificance of the changes was tested by using the pooled t\ntest (pooled t-statistic  difference in the means or propor-\ntions of the two estimates divided by the pooled standard\nerror of the two estimates, which was calculated as the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of the two standard\nerrors). An  of 0.05 was used as the critical value of\nstatistical significance for the two-sided t tests. All analyses\nwere performed using SUDAAN software (Release 9.0;\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to\naccount for the complex sampling design and to calculate\nestimates representative of the civilian, non-institutional-\nized U.S. population.\nResults\nAmong NHANES men and non-pregnant women 20\nyears of age who attended the mobile examination center,\nthose who had a WC measure were as follows: 15,454\nwomen (Table 1).

Similar in-\ncreasing trends in the prevalence of abdominal obesity\ndefined by using ethnic-specific cut-off values for WC\nsuggested by the International Diabetes Federation were\nobserved (see Appendix).\nTo examine whether the increase in WC reflected a\ngeneral increase in body weight rather than a specific in-\ncrease in abdominal adiposity, we examined the change\nin mean WC (Figure 1) and in prevalence of abdominal\nobesity (Figure 2) by three categories of BMI. Among both\nmen and women, significant increases in mean WC were\nfound in all three BMI categories. Both men and women\nwith a BMI of 30 kg/m2 had the largest increase in mean\nWC. In contrast, a significant increase in the prevalence of\nabdominal obesity was found only among men with a BMI\ncant increase was found in each of the BMI categories\nFigure 1: Age-adjusted means of WC among U.S. adults 20 years of age according to BMI, NHANES III (1988\u00ad1994) to NHANES\nFigure 2: Age-adjusted prevalence of abdominal obesity (NCEP ATP III: WC 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women) among U.S. adults\nIncreasing Abdominal Obesity in U.S. Adults, Li et al.\namong women, particularly among those with a BMI of\nTrends of Mean WC and the Prevalence of Abdominal\nAn overall increase of 1.5% and 2.0% in mean age-\nadjusted WC occurred for men and women, respectively\n(Table 1).

Increases in energy intake (20),\ndespite recent declines in the prevalence of inactivity (21),\nlikely contributed to the secular trends in mean WC and in\nprevalence of abdominal obesity.\nAs the epidemic of overall obesity measured by BMI\nincreased (12,13), the prevalence of abdominal obesity as\nmeasured by WC correspondingly increased. However, the\nrates and demographic patterns of such an increase in over-\nall obesity and abdominal obesity may differ. Recent data\nindicate that the relative increase in the prevalence of over-\nall obesity as measured by BMI was 7.3% for men and 8.0%\ncontrast, the relative increase in abdominal obesity at the\nthat in overall obesity, as evidenced in our study. Further-\nmore, as shown in our study, the total relative increase from\nobesity seemed to be more pronounced among men and\nwomen ages 20 to 29 years and among both men and\nwomen with a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2.

Because we used a\ncut-off value of 88 cm to define abdominal obesity in\nwomen and the mean WC in the recent NHANES surveys\nwas near this threshold, it was likely that a small increase in\nWC could lead to a large increase in the prevalence of\nabdominal obesity.\nAlthough the overall unadjusted and age-adjusted\n2004 were significant, the age-specific changes were mostly\nnot significant. In part, this is attributable to the smaller\nnumbers of participants in each age group and, in part, to\nsmall changes in WC in some age groups in this short period\nof time. In almost all instances, whites had the highest\nprevalence of abdominal obesity among men, and African\nIncreasing Abdominal Obesity in U.S. Adults, Li et al.\nAmericans had the highest prevalence of abdominal obesity\namong women.

Thus, these\ntwo groups may be at particularly high risk for any future\nobesity-associated complications. In contrast, both African-\nAmerican men and women had the highest prevalence of\noverall obesity and the largest relative increases between the\nAlthough women showed a clear inverse relationship\nbetween educational attainment and the prevalence of ab-\ndominal obesity, men did not. However, among both sexes,\na direct relationship occurred between educational attain-\nment and relative increases in abdominal obesity. It is\nunclear why people with a higher education level tended to\nhave a greater increase in the prevalence of abdominal\nobesity. To the extent that educational attainment reflects\nsocioeconomic status, the expected relationships between\nsocioeconomic status and obesity seem to be attenuating in\nrecent NHANES surveys.\nInterestingly, significant increases in the prevalence of\nabdominal obesity seemed to be more pronounced within\nthe group with BMI values of 25 to 29 kg/m2 than within\nother BMI groups for both men and women. Additional\nanalyses showed that the mean BMI of each NHANES\nsurvey was similar for each of the three BMI groups.\nTherefore, the larger increase in abdominal obesity in this\nspecific group may not be related to the change in BMI. One\npossible explanation may be attributable to the use of a\ncut-off point of 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women to\ndefine abdominal obesity. Because the mean WC in the\ngroup with BMI values of 25 to 29 kg/m2 is closer to the\ncut-off point than those of the other two groups, people in\nthis BMI group are more likely to exceed the thresholds to\nbe defined as abdominal obesity when their WC increases.\nNevertheless, further research is needed to examine the root\ncauses that lead to differential trends of abdominal and\noverall obesity.\nOur results highlight the critical need to understand the\nsecular trends in abdominal obesity in the United States.\nIncreasing evidence indicates that abdominal obesity as\nmeasured by WC may be more important than the overall\nobesity as measured by BMI in predicting all-cause mortal-\nity and morbidity of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases\n(2\u00ad4,6). In addition, WC may be superior to BMI in mea-\nsuring abdominal adiposity (22). Furthermore, a combina-\ntion of BMI and WC may provide a better prediction of\nobesity-related mortality and morbidity than BMI or WC\nalone (23). As shown in a recent study, relative to the\n(BMI 30 kg/m2) was positively associated with total mor-\ntality, but overweight (BMI 25 to 29 kg/m2) was inversely\nassociated with total mortality (24). It is unknown whether\nthis counterintuitive finding among people with a BMI of 25\nto 29 kg/m2 in this study is attributable to lean body mass.\nIn fact, lean body mass is inversely related to all-cause\nmortality (25). Therefore, monitoring the changing trend of\nabdominal obesity may provide additional information for\nmore accurately predicting all-cause and obesity-related\nmortality and morbidity and an opportunity for intervention\nin clinical practice and public health campaigns. Because\nrelatively few health care professionals routinely measure\nWC, efforts are needed to promote the measurement of this\nimportant anthropometric parameter as a \"vital sign\" in\nprimary care practice.\nIn summary, the results from our analyses provide an\nupdated look at the trends in WC and abdominal obesity in\nthe United States. Mean WC increased among all sociode-\nmographic groups examined in this report. Increases in\nabdominal obesity were particularly striking among over-\nweight men and women (BMI 25 to 29 kg/m2). Previous\nstudies showing that increased mortality risk related to\nexcess body fat was due mainly to abdominal adiposity (6)\nraise potential concerns about how the increases in the\nprevalence of abdominal obesity that we demonstrated may\naffect future adverse health outcomes in the United States.\n"
