    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study examined attributions generated by cardiac rehabilitation patients shortly after experiencing a cardiovascular\nevent, exploring whether attribution type was associated with health appraisals and outcomes concurrently and 21months\nlater. Attributions fell into three categories: controllable behavioral ones, uncontrollable biological ones, and stress-\nrelated causes. Linking attribution type to appraisals and outcomes showed that creating a behavioral attribution was\nbeneficial in the short-term for control appraisals, but was associated with increased anxiety symptoms 21months later.\nThus, cardiac rehabilitation providers should encourage patients to maintain a future-focus that promotes perceived\ncontrol over health promotion behaviors that reduce risk for recurrence.\n",

In her influential piece on cognitive adaptation,\nShelley Taylor (1983) outlines steps commonly taken in\nthe wake of trauma: the generation of meaning, the bolster-\ning of perceived control, and self-enhancement. The first\nstep in this cognitive process, the creation of meaning, is\noften accomplished through the generation of a causal\nattribution. Empirical evidence supports the process of\nmeaning creation via causal attributions among patients\ndiagnosed with various forms of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD). For example, Cameron etal. (2005) found that the\nmost common causal attributions endorsed by myocardial\ninfarction (MI) patients via a checklist method were stress,\nhigh cholesterol, heredity, and eating fatty foods, and that\nthese attributions remained stable over a 6-month follow-\nup period. Another study found not only similar types of\nattributions generated by MI patients at baseline (i.e.\nsmoking, heredity, and stress) but also some volatility in\nendorsement over time (Reges etal., 2011). Specifically, at\n2-year post-hospitalization, more patients endorsed high\ncholesterol, lack of physical activity, and problems at work\nas causes than at baseline. Day etal. (2005) found that\nthe most commonly endorsed attributions among CVD\npatients via a checklist were heredity, hypertension, high\ncholesterol, physical inactivity, and poor food habits.\nFurthermore, nearly one-third of the sample endorsed\nstress/negative emotions as a causal factor in their diagno-\nses. A more recent study among coronary artery bypass\ngraft (CABG) patients that used an attribution checklist\nfound the most common causes to be stress and genes for\nboth men and women (Dunkel etal., 2011). Results also\npointed to a gender difference: whereas men were more\nlikely than women to make an attribution to past behavior,\nwomen were more likely than men to attribute their diag-\nnosis to destiny.\nThe above-mentioned studies examined attributions\ngenerated via a checklist, but other researchers have col-\nlected patients' open-ended causal explanations. For exam-\nple, Martin etal. (2005) qualitatively analyzed MI patients'\nattributions, collapsing them into the following commonly\nCausal attributions following a cardiac\nevent: Short- and long-term differences\nin health appraisals and outcomes\nKymberley K Bennett, Jillian MR Clark,\nKadie Harry and Alisha D Howarter\n Keywords\nbeliefs, heart, outcomes, psychological distress, social cognitions\nUniversity of Missouri--Kansas City, USA\nCorresponding author:\nKymberley K Bennett, Department of Psychology, University of\nMissouri--Kansas City, Cherry Hall, Room 302, Kansas City, MO\nEmail: bennettkk@umkc.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \ncited categories: stress, comorbidities, diet, smoking,\nheredity, and physical inactivity. Comparisons by gender\nshowed that men were significantly more likely to generate\ncontrollable behavioral attributions compared to women.\nThis gender difference translated to behavioral disparities\nmonths later, as men were more likely to self-report\nimprovements in diet and exercise habits compared to\nwomen. Astin and Jones (2004) qualitatively examined\nCVD patients' causal attributions, collapsing them into\nthree main categories: biological causes, behavioral causes,\nand stress. Results revealed gender differences, such that\nwomen were more likely than men to generate biological\nand stress attributions, but men were more likely than\nwomen to create behavioral attributions. The same three\nattributional themes were found by Bennett and Marte\n(2013) among cardiac rehabilitation (CR) patients, but\nthese authors reported no gender differences in biological\nor stress attributions and only a trend for men to create\nmore behavioral attributions than women. Therefore, ample\nevidence exists than CVD patients engage in a causal\nsearch following a cardiac event, and that these attributions\ntypically fall into three categories: controllable behavioral\ncauses, uncontrollable biological causes, and stress (e.g.\nResearchers have begun to more deeply investigate how\nthese three types of attributions affect physical and psycho-\nlogical recovery. Two studies suggest adaptive effects on\nrecovery from the creation of behavioral or modifiable/con-\ntrollable causal attributions. Blair et\npatients' attributions for their cardiac events, using them to\npredict attendance at CR. Results showed that patients who\ncreated attributions to causes that were controllable (e.g. diet\nand physical inactivity) were more likely to attend CR than\npatients who generated uncontrollable attributions, even after\ncontrolling for sociodemographic variables such as sex and\ndistance to the nearest CR site. An intervention study by\nBroadbent et\nal. (2009) aimed to strengthen controllable\nbehavioral attributions among patients post-MI. Results\nshowed that the intervention group endorsed high cholesterol\nand physical inactivity to greater degrees post-intervention\ncompared to the control group. Furthermore, these authors\nsuggest that their attributional retraining was adaptive because\nthe intervention group was more likely to return to work at the\n3-month follow-up compared to the control group.\nWhereas support has been found for behavioral attribu-\ntions assisting in recovery, the effects of stress attributions on\nadjustment are mixed. On one hand, Dunkel et\nfound that CABG patients who endorsed stress and personal-\nity causal attributions at baseline had a worsening of depres-\nsive symptoms over a 1-year period, after controlling for a\nhost of sociodemographic and clinical factors. On the other\nhand, Bennett and Marte (2013) reported that baseline stress\nattributions were associated with improvements in a measure\nof energy expenditure over the course of CR, and that self-\nreported engagement in healthy behaviors mediated the\nrelation. Furthermore, little work has investigated the effect\nof biological attributions on adjustment and recovery. One\nstudy was located that examined a sample of older adults with\nchronic health conditions, the most common of which was\nheart disease (42%; Stewart etal., 2012). Results showed that\nendorsing an \"old age\" attribution (i.e. a biological one that is\nuncontrollable) for one's chronic health condition was associ-\nated with poor self-reported health, poor engagement in\nhealth behaviors (e.g. eating a nutritious diet), and a greater\nlikelihood of death at the 2-year follow-up (36% vs 14%).\nHypothesis and research questions\nThis study was conducted to examine whether (a) attribu-\ntions generated by a sample of CR patients align with pre-\nvious research, (b) gender differences exist in the creation\nof these attributions, and (c) these attributions have effects\non health appraisals and outcomes. Prior studies suggest\nthat patients' attributions fall into three main categories:\nbehavioral causes that are largely controllable (e.g. lack of\nexercise and poor diet), biological causes that are largely\nuncontrollable (e.g. heredity), and interpersonal stressors.\nThese categories have emerged across studies that use\nopen-ended questions and checklist formats, hence\nHypothesis 1. Participants' attributions will fall into\nthree main categories: behavioral ones that are control-\nlable, biological ones that are uncontrollable, and stress-\nrelated causes.\nGiven gender differences documented in the literature,\nwe also hypothesized\nHypothesis 2. Men will be more likely to create behav-\nioral attributions than women, whereas women will be\nmore likely than men to create biological and stress\nattributions.\nBecause evidence is mixed on the adjustment/recovery\neffects of creating behavioral, biological, and stress attribu-\ntions, we did not test specific hypotheses. Rather, we\nexplored whether these types of attributions result in differ-\nences in concurrent and prospective health appraisals and\noutcomes through two research questions, specifically\nResearch Question 1. Are there concurrent differences\nin health behaviors, perceptions of control, and psycho-\nlogical and physical health status as a function of the\ntype of attribution created at the beginning of CR?\nand\nResearch Question 2. Are there long-term differences\nin health behaviors, perceptions of control, and\nBennett et al. 3\npsychological and physical health status as a function of\nthe type of attribution created at the beginning of CR?\nMethod\nParticipants\nBaseline (i.e. Time 1) data were collected from 209 patients\n(65.6% male) enrolled in a CR in a Midwestern state. Ages\nyears, with an average age of\nyears (standard deviation (SD)=11.1years). A vast\nmajority of the sample reported their ethnic background to\nbe European American (91.8%). Other ethnicities repre-\nsented in the sample include African American (5.3%) and\nNative American (1.9%). Although most participants were\npercent\nreported being divorced, 9.1\npercent were widowed,\n3.8percent were single and had never married, and 1.4per-\ncent was separated from their partners at the time of the\nstudy. Most participants had completed high school or\nattended a college or trade school (47.9%), whereas\npercent completed a\ngraduate degree. A majority of participants reported not\nworking outside the home (58.7%), and the average house-\nhold income range for the previous year was between\nParticipants in this study varied widely in the diagnosis\nfor which they were referred to CR. The most common\npercent were referred, was the\nplacement of a stent. The other most common diagnoses\nwere CABG (17.6%), MI with the placement of a stent\n(13.8%), and valve replacement or repair (9.0%). All par-\nticipants were stratified by risk for disease progression on\nthe basis of the American Association of Cardiovascular\nand Pulmonary Rehabilitation (2004) guidelines. Risk\nstratification assignments of low (59.4%), moderate\n(36.1%), or high (4.4%) were made by CR staff and based\non participants' diagnoses, prior cardiac events if appro-\npriate, and current risk factors (e.g. smoking, concurrent\nailments, and diet). Participants attended an average of\nprograms.\nFollow-up data were collected from 112 participants\nmonths later. The follow-up sample was\npercent male with an average age of 63.7\nyears\npercent were married or living with a partner,\n43.8percent had completed high school or attended a col-\nlege or trade school, most (i.e. 58.6%) did not work out-\nside the home, and the average household income range\nUS$69,999. A series of chi-squares and independent sam-\nple t-tests were conducted to determine whether the fol-\nlow-up sample differed from the baseline sample on any\ndemographic or study variable. Results showed that the\nfollow-up sample was older (M=63.68), better educated\n(M\n=\n5.00), and had lower risk stratifications for disease\nprogression (M\n=\n1.36) than the full baseline sample\n(Ms\n=\nsome caution is warranted in generalizing prospective\nfindings to the full sample.\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited through a Phase II CR program\nin a Midwestern city. Phase II CR programs typically run\nfor 12weeks and are primarily comprised of monitored\nexercise classes. Recruitment for the study occurred in\ntwo phases. First, CR staff members summarized the\nstudy's objectives and procedures during introductory,\nintake interviews with new patients. If patients provided\npreliminary written consent, their contact information\nwas forwarded to our research team. The second phase\nof recruitment occurred when our research team mem-\nbers called these interested patients within 1\nweek of\ntheir intake interviews. During these phone calls, more\ndetailed information about the study was provided to\npatients, and if they expressed interest, a study packet\nwith a consent form, Time 1 questionnaire, and postage-\npaid return envelope was mailed to them. Research team\nmembers communicated to prospective participants that\nthey were not obligated to participate if they received a\nstudy packet by mail. If, after reading through the mate-\nrials, a patient consented to being in the study, he/she\nwas asked to sign the consent form and return it, along\nwith the completed questionnaire, in the enclosed enve-\nlope. Follow-up questionnaires (i.e. Time 2) were mailed\nto participants 21months later, approximately 18months\nfollowing completion of CR. Participants returned their\ncompleted Time 2 questionnaires to us in postage-paid\nenvelopes. All study procedures were approved by the\nappropriate hospital and university institutional review\nboards.\nMeasures\nQuestionnaires comprising several standardized measures,\nas well as items specifically designed for this study, were\nused at Time 1 and Time 2.\nCardiac attributions. At Time 1, using an open-ended ques-\ntion, participants were asked what they believed to be the\nmain cause of their cardiac events: \"If you had to pick one\nmajor cause for your heart condition, in your own words,\nwhat would that cause be?\" Participants were provided a\nspace in which to write their answers. The use of a single,\nopen-ended question to assess causal attributions for car-\ndiac events is supported by results of French etal. (2005),\nwho found that although MI patients can identify multiple\n4 Health Psychology Open \npossible causes, most focused on a single cause for their\ncardiac events.\nCardiac symptom experiences. Patients' experiences of car-\ndiac-related symptoms were assessed with three questions\npants were asked how many times during the preceding\nweeks they suffered from three common CVD-related\nsymptoms: (a) pain in chest, (b) pressure or heaviness in\nchest, and (c) shortness of breath. Responses were made on\n=never and 5=\nmore than 15 times) and\nsummed, with high scores indicating frequent experience\nof symptoms.\nEngagement in health-promoting behaviors.Participants'\nengagement in healthy behaviors was assessed with six\nitems adapted from Naslund and Fredrikson (1993) at Time\n1 and Time 2. Items measured how often during the past\nmonth participants engaged in a variety of healthy and\nunhealthy behaviors (e.g. eating red meat, fruits, and vege-\ntables and engaging in light or moderate intensity work-\nouts) on a 7-point scale (1=never and 7=more than once a\nday). Responses were summed so that higher values reflect\nengagement in more healthy behaviors.\nControl appraisals.Perceptions of control were measured\nwith two items adapted from Bennett et\nfocus on CVD-related recovery and prevention: \"In gen-\neral, how much personal control do you think you have in\nrecovering from your cardiac event?\" and \"How much per-\nsonal control do you think you have in preventing another\ncardiac event?\" Responses to these two questions were\nmade on a 4-point scale (1=very little and 4=total) at Time\nSymptoms of anxiety. Participants completed the Beck Anx-\niety Inventory (BAI; Beck and Steer, 1990) to measure the\ndegree to which they experienced symptoms of anxiety at\nTime 1 and Time 2. The BAI presents 21 common symp-\ntoms of anxiety such as difficulty breathing and hands\ntrembling. Respondents were asked to report the frequency\nthey experienced these symptoms along a 4-point scale\n(0=not at all and 3=severely). Scores can range from 0 to\n63, with high scores reflecting high symptoms of anxiety.\nSymptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms were meas-\nured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck\npants to rate their degree of agreement with 21 items tap-\nping symptoms of depression such as sadness, loss of\npleasure, and fatigue. Respondents rated their degree of\nagreement with these items along a 4-point scale (0=I do\nnot feel sad and 3\n=\nI am so sad or unhappy that I can't\nstand it). Possible scores range from 0 to 63, with high\nscores reflecting high depressive symptoms.\nResults\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics, coefficient alphas\n(where appropriate), and correlations for all study\nvariables.\nHypothesis 1: content analyses of attributions\nattributions for their cardiac events. Seven participants left\nthe attribution question blank and were excluded from the\nanalyses presented below. Of the remaining 202 partici-\npants, most (168; 83%) generated only one attribution for\ntheir cardiac events; however, 26 participants generated\ntwo attributions (13%) and eight participants generated\nthree attributions (4%). In order to test Hypothesis 1 (i.e.\nthat attributions will fall into behavioral, biological, and\nstress themes), content analyses of these attributions fol-\nlowed a multi-step process. First, four coders reviewed a\nrandom sample of 25percent of the attributions, devoid of\nany identifiers, in order to develop a set of common themes\n(or coding categories). Individually, coders generated a list\nof themes into which the random sample of attributions fell.\nSecond, a group meeting was held wherein themes were\ncompared, discussed, and amended, resulting in a set of 13\nagreed-upon coding categories. Third, the four coders inde-\npendently assigned another random sample of 25percent of\nthe attributions into these 13 coding categories. Fourth, a\nmeeting was held to discuss the codings, resolve any dis-\ncrepancies, and revise the coding categories if needed.\nConsensus was reached on the assignment of attributions to\nthe coding categories, and no revision to those coding cat-\negories was necessary. Fifth, the four coders individually\nreviewed and assigned the remaining 75percent of the attri-\nbutions into the coding categories. Sixth, a group meeting\nwas held wherein the coders discussed and resolved all dis-\ncrepancies.Across all attributions, coders agreed 91percent\nof the time, yielding a free marginal kappa of .90.\nTable 2 provides the 13 coding categories, the number of\nattributions assigned to each category, and examples from\neach coding category. Results showed that the most com-\nmon type of attribution generated by participants was hered-\nand poor self-care (9.8%). Consistent with Hypothesis 1,\nthese 13 categories can be further collapsed into three broad\ncausal themes found in the literature: (a) behavioral (con-\ntrollable) causes (poor diet, poor general self-care, lack of\nexercise, smoking, and obesity); (b) biological (uncontrol-\nlable) causes (heredity, non-cardiac-related conditions, car-\ndiac-related conditions, and age); and (c) stress. The\npersonality and miscellaneous categories (n=15) were\ndropped from subsequent analyses. For the current sample,\n92 participants (45.5%) generated a behavioral cause,\nwhereas 90 participants (44.6%) created a biological cause,\nand 24 participants (11.9%) believed stress to be a cause. A\nBennett et al. 5\ntotal of 11 participants (5.4%) created both behavioral and\nbiological attributions.\nHypothesis 2: gender differences\nChi-square analyses were conducted to test whether men cre-\nated more behavioral attributions than women, and whether\nwomen created more biological attributions than men. Because\nvery few participants created stress attributions, gender com-\nparisonswerenottested.Resultsrevealednogenderdifferences.\nMen were just as likely as women to make behavioral attribu-\n=\n.11), while women were just as\np=.68).

Because very few participants\ncreated stress attributions, this category was dropped in\nsubsequent analyses. Table 3 provides results of mean com-\nparisons on these different outcomes by whether partici-\npants endorsed a behavioral/controllable cause (yes/no)\nand a biological/uncontrollable cause (yes/no). The top half\nof Table 3 provides comparisons on outcomes at Time 1 by\nattribution category, whereas the bottom half of the Table\nprovides comparisons on outcomes at Time 2.\nConcurrently, independent sample t-tests showed that\nparticipants who made a behavioral attribution at the\nbeginning of CR engaged in fewer healthy behaviors\ntheir counterparts who did not make a behavioral attribu-\ntion. Additionally, participants who made a biological\nattribution at the beginning of CR engaged in more\ntrended toward experiencing fewer anxiety symptoms\ntheir counterparts who did not make a biological\nattribution.\nThe longitudinal comparisons in the lower half of Table\n3 were done with analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs),\ncontrolling for baseline levels of the outcomes.

Consistent with Hypothesis 1, patients' explana-\ntions fell into three main categories: biologically based ones\nTable 3.

Biological and\nbehavioral attributions were created by almost equal propor-\ntions of participants, whereas stress was mentioned by\nfewer. Within the biological theme, the most commonly\nmentioned attribution involved heredity, whereas within the\nbehavioral theme, the most commonly cited cause was poor\ndiet. These results suggest that controllable and uncontrol-\nlable causes are equally salient to patients as they engage in\na causal search to understand their diagnoses. Our results\ndepart from past studies in the relatively low number of\npatients who endorsed stress as a cause. It is possible this is\nan artifact of our relatively affluent and educated sample, a\nmajority of which no longer worked outside the home. By\nextension, it may be that these participants were subjected to\nfewer stressors than participants in other studies who were\nyounger or lower in socioeconomic status (e.g. Cameron\net\nrelated findings differ from other studies, caution is war-\nranted in generalizing beyond this sample.\nBased on prior studies, Hypothesis 2 predicted gender\ndifferences in the types of attributions created: whereas\nmen were predicted to make more behavioral attributions\nthan women, women were predicted to generate more bio-\nlogical and stress attributions than men. Results did not\nsupport this hypothesis, however, as no gender differences\nemerged for behavioral or biological attributions (and too\nfew stress attributions were generated to test for gender dif-\nferences). Results imply that men and women are equally\nlikely to draw on controllable and uncontrollable causes\nwhen creating meaning following a cardiac event. This may\nreflect a change in gender norms surrounding the role of\nbehavior (i.e. exercise) in the promotion of physical health.\nWhereas older generations of women may have avoided\nphysical exertion, women of all ages now endorse attitudes\nthat embrace the central role of physical activity in health\npromotion (e.g. Ransford and Palisi, 1996; Rydwik etal.,\n2012). Our results also likely reflect a more accurate view\nof CVD risk factors by both men and women, recognizing\nthat biological and behavioral risk factors often co-occur\nand interact to shape one's risk for CVD.\nThis study also sought to explore (through Research\nQuestions 1 and 2) whether attributions made at the begin-\nning of CR would differentiate between patients in their\nself-reported health appraisals and outcomes concurrently,\nand whether any longitudinal differences would be sus-\nmonths later. At the beginning of CR, results\nshowed that participants who created a behavioral attribu-\ntion reported engaging in fewer health-promoting behav-\niors in the preceding month compared to those who did not\ngenerate a behavioral attribution. The opposite was true for\nthose who created a biological attribution. Together, these\ndifferences suggest that patients had insight into the ori-\ngins of their disease. For example, people who cited \"poor\ndiet\" or \"lack of exercise\" as causes self-reported fewer of\nthose corresponding behaviors than participants who did\nnot generate behavioral attributions. Significant differ-\nences also emerged for appraisals of control over recovery\nfrom CVD and control over prevention of recurrence.\nParticipants who generated a behavioral cause reported\nsignificantly more perceived control over recovery and\nprevention compared to participants who did not create a\nbehavioral attribution. Conversely, participants who gen-\nerated a biological attribution felt significantly less per-\nceived control over prevention than those who did not\ngenerate a biological attribution. Again, this pattern of\nresults suggests insight into the origins and course of treat-\nment for patients following a CVD event.\nAlthough the cross-sectional results are encouraging on\naccount of participants' seemingly accurate views of the\norigins and trajectories of CVD, the benefits associated\nwith making behavioral attributions seem to disappear lon-\ngitudinally. Patients who created behavioral attributions at\nbaseline reported significantly more cardiac symptom\nexperiences 21months later compared to those who did not\ncreate a behavioral attribution. The same difference can be\nseen in symptoms of anxiety: patients who created a behav-\nioral attribution at baseline experienced significantly more\nanxiety symptoms 21months later than those who did not\ncreate a behavioral attribution. The direction is opposite for\nthose who created biological attributions at baseline: they\nexperienced significantly fewer cardiac and anxiety symp-\ntoms 21months later compared to participants who did not\ngenerate biological attributions. This pattern suggests that\nbelieving one's behavior caused CVD is associated with\npsychological distress that can manifest as anxiety symp-\ntoms, or may translate to slower physical recovery opera-\ntionalized as the experience of cardiac symptoms.\nThese findings are surprising, and depart from several\nprominent attribution theorists. For example, Janoff-\nBulman (1979) suggests that behavioral self-blame attribu-\ntions should aid psychological adjustment because behavior\nis malleable. Character, on the other hand, is predicted to be\ndistressing because one's disposition is presumed to be\nimmutable. To the extent that heredity and biological fac-\ntors are uncontrollable, Janoff-Bulman's ideas would sug-\ngest behavioral attributions, but not biological attributions,\naid in recovery and adjustment. However, these results\nstrongly challenge the notion that creating a behavioral\nattribution is adaptive through enhancements in control\nappraisals; although differences in recovery and prevention\ncontrol were seen cross-sectionally, no differences remained\n21months later. Rather, our findings imply that an attribu-\ntion that absolves someone of control (e.g. heredity) can\nhave a positive impact, and that rehabilitation efforts should\nuse a forward orientation coupled with enhancements in\ncontrol over future behaviors (Bennett etal., 2013).\nThese findings may have implications for CR providers.\nFirst, results suggest patients should not be encouraged to\nruminate about past behaviors in an attempt to identify one\n8 Health Psychology Open \nor more that caused their cardiac event. In fact, avoiding a\nbehavioral attribution may protect patients from distress,\nwhich in turn could negatively affect their motivation or\nself-efficacy for sustained physical activity. Within the con-\ntext of CR, the creation of a behavioral attribution may cre-\nate anxiety about needing to change that behavior, which\ncould interfere with the confidence being formed through\ncontinued participation in CR. Therefore, maintaining a\nfuture orientation, with a focus on building confidence to\ncontrol future behaviors, seems warranted. Second, CR's\nstrong focus on building exercise capacity seems to affect\nall patients regardless of the type of attribution created at\nbaseline. That is, there were no differences found by attri-\nbution category in engagement in healthy behaviors. In\nfact, paired sample t-tests among participants who com-\npleted questionnaires at both times showed that regardless\nof whether behavioral or biological attributions were cre-\nated, they made significant improvements in healthy behav-\nThus, as an intervention, CR seems quite effective in\nincreasing health promotion behaviors.\nLimitations and future directions\nThese data are the first of which we are aware to link open-\nended cardiac attributions to self-rated health appraisals\nand outcomes nearly 2\nyears after a cardiovascular event.\nHowever, several study limitations are noteworthy. First,\nresults are based on an ethnically homogenous, relatively\naffluent sample of CVD patients participating in a CR pro-\ngram. Research shows that referral rates to CR are low\nticipation in CR among eligible patients even lower\nsample likely represents a motivated group of patients that\nmay differ from others not participating in CR. In order to\nincrease generalizability of findings, future research should\nrecruit a more heterogeneous sample of CVD patients,\nincluding ones who are not enrolled in CR. Second, all data\nin this study were self-reported; thus, they are subject to\nshared method variance, social desirability, and other\nresponse biases. Future research would benefit from clini-\ncal assessments of distress, cross-informant ratings of\nsocial-cognitive constructs, and observations of exercise-\nrelated behaviors. Third, attrition occurred between the\nassessments, resulting in a loss of approximately one-half\nthe sample at Time 2. Although attrition over time points is\nnormal, especially with follow-ups over many months (as\nwas the case in this study), some caution is warranted when\ninterpreting the longitudinal findings. Comparisons\nrevealed that the sample used for the longitudinal analyses\ndiffered from the full sample in age, education, and risk\nstratification. Therefore, future research should attempt to\nreduce attrition at follow-up. Finally, these data cannot\nspeak to the stability of cardiac attributions made. Future\nresearch should measure patient-generated attributions\nover time to determine whether these causal searches yield\nstable meanings about the origins of one's CVD.\nConclusion\nThis study examined types of causal attributions generated\nby CR patients shortly after experiencing a cardiac event,\nwith results showing that biological and behavioral ones\nwere generated in equal proportions. Despite predictions,\nno gender differences emerged. Thus, men and women\nwere equally likely to create biological (uncontrollable)\nand behavioral (controllable) attributions for their cardiac\nevents. Linking attribution type to outcomes showed that\ncreating a behavioral attribution seemed to be beneficial in\nthe short-term for control appraisals, and that participants\ndisplayed insight into the origins of their diagnoses by\nmaking either behavioral or biological attributions.\nHowever, over time, any benefit to making a behavioral\nattribution disappeared, as it was associated with increased\nanxiety symptoms 21months later. These findings suggest\nthat CR providers should discourage patients from looking\nbackward when creating meaning, but rather should encour-\nage patients to maintain a future-focus that promotes per-\nceived control over health promotion behaviors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary\nRehabilitation (2004) Guidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation\nand Secondary Prevention Programs (4th edn).
