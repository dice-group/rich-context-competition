    "abstract": "Abstract\nChina's rapid and sustained economic growth offers an opportunity to ask whether the advantages of growth diffuse throughout\nan economy, or remain localized in areas where the growth has been the greatest. A critical policy area in China has been the\nhealth system, and health inequality has become an issue that has led the government to broaden national health insurance\nprograms. This study investigates whether health system resources and performance have converged over the past 30 years\nacross China's 31 provinces. To examine geographic variation of health system resources and performance at the provincial\nlevel, we measure the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence in indicators of health system resources (structure),\nhealth services utilization (process), and outcome. All data are from officially published sources: the China Health Statistics Year\nBook and the China Statistics Year Book. Sigma convergence is found for resource indicators, whereas it is not observed for\neither process or outcome indicators, indicating that disparities only narrowed in health system resources. Beta convergence\nis found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators, reflecting that provinces with poorer resources were catching\nup. Convergence found in this study probably reflects the mixed outcome of government input, and market forces. Thus,\nleft alone, the equitable distribution of health care resources may not occur naturally during a period of economic growth.\nGovernmental and societal efforts are needed to reduce geographic health variation and promote health equity.\n",

The health system of China is also con-\nverting from a centrally planned health system to one that is\nmore market oriented.1 These transitions have resulted in an\nexpanded supply of high-quality hospital services, especially\nto the people in large cities. Unfortunately, the majority of\npeople in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties\naccessing good-quality and affordable health care.2 Health\ninequality has become a major issue in the health system of\nChina, which raises concerns among the general public and\nthe government.3 In China, health inequality at the individual\nlevel is reflected in health disparities between rural and urban\nareas and variation among provinces. The health disparity\nbetween urban and rural areas has been decreasing, but still\nexists.4 Geographic health variation is also dramatic, but less\nstudied. In 2005, Shanghai, the most affluent city in China,\nenjoyed 78 years' life expectancy at birth, which was the\nhighest in China. However, the life expectancy at birth in the\npoorest province in Western China was only 65 years.5 The\nextent of diffusion of the advantages of growth throughout\nthe economy has not been rigorously studied. Our hypothesis\nis that over the 30 years'economic growth, geographic varia-\ntion in health system resources and performance at the pro-\nvincial level has decreased and is achieving convergence.\nThe alternative hypothesis is that over the 30 years' eco-\nnomic growth, health resources and performance at the pro-\nvincial level have increased, resulting in divergence.\nGeographic variation in health is caused by multiple fac-\ntors, such as the upstream unequal social determinants and\nthe relationship between government and market in the\nhealth system. The health system itself also plays an inde-\npendent and important role. The first question we will\n1University of California, Los Angeles, USA\n2Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China\nCorresponding Author:\nDi Liang, Department of Health Policy and Management, UCLA Fielding\nexplore is the current extent of geographic variation in health\nsystem resources and performance. The next is how it has\nchanged during the past 30 years in the face of the rapid,\nsustained economic growth.\nGeographic variation in health system resources and per-\nformance can be analyzed with several methods. Small area\nvariation studies have been widely used, especially with\ncomparisons of health care expenditures (HCEs) in different\nregions; for example, the Dartmouth Atlas points out varia-\ntions of expenditures as possible explanations of high health\ncosts. The Dartmouth researchers have also presented simu-\nlations that suggest that the cost savings would be huge if\nhigh-cost regions could, somehow, reduce their costs to those\nof low-cost regions.6 Convergence analysis is another\nmethod to study geographic variation. Convergence analysis\ndoes not focus on the difference between specific areas, but\nlooks at the time trend of variation reduction in HCEs, or\nother health indicators. Triggered by the seminal articles by\nBarro and Sala-i-Martin and Mankiw etal, a huge amount of\nconvergence literature emerged in various contexts, mainly\nto study patterns of economic growth across different\nregional economies.7-9 Health economists have also adopted\nconvergence analysis to measure health variation within and\nbetween regions. The convergence of HCEs has been studied\nin the European Union and the United States.10-14\nLimited publications have explored geographical variation\nin China at the provincial level or small-area level. Chou and\nWang examined regional health expenditure inequality by\ntesting 2 hypotheses on HCE convergence from 1978 to\nconvergence was observed, but convergence in regional clus-\nters was found. However, very few studies to date have looked\nat the geographic health variation longitudinally. We sus-\npected that it may be related to the accessibility of geographic\nhealth data either at the provincial or small-area level.\nIn addition, quality of health services in China was rarely\nassessed according to Donabedian's typology of structure, pro-\ncess, and outcome, partly because of insufficient data on the\nprocess and outcome measures of health services.16\nDonabedian's typology has been widely used as a conceptual\nmodel for constructing indicator systems to assess the quality of\ncare at the individual level as well as the performance of a health\ncare system. We believe that the Donabedian way of categoriz-\ning health system performance is meaningful and useful from a\npolicy perspective, and our study will apply convergence analy-\nsis to each category of health system performance to study the\nvariation of China's health care at the provincial level.\nMethods\nSigma Convergence\nThe theory of welfare maximization under the usual condi-\ntion of diminishing marginal product suggests that health\nresources at the margin should be allocated to those areas\nthat are least well-off for aggregate welfare to be maximized.\nIn other words, if health inequality within a country were to\ndiminish, health indicators would converge with time and\naggregate social welfare would be maximized.\nOne of simplest methods for estimating convergence is to\ncalculate sigma convergence. Sigma is the standard devia-\ntion of the log transformed value of a variable. Therefore,\nsigma convergence occurs when the value of sigma falls over\ntime among different provinces.\nSigma is calculated as follows:\n\nt\ni\nn\ni t\ni\nn\ni t\nn\ny\nn\ny\n= -\n= =\n \n(log log )\n, ,\nwhere y\ni,t\nis the value of a health indicator of province i at\ntime t.\nBeta Convergence\nBeta convergence refers to a process in which poor regions\ngrow faster than rich ones. For instance, in our study, beta\nconvergence would suggest that the health care resources\nand performance had improved faster in poorer provinces\nthan richer provinces in China. When all economies are\nassumed to converge toward the same steady state regardless\nof their specific features, beta convergence is said to be abso-\nlute. When the steady state may depend on features specific\nto each economy, beta convergence is then said to be condi-\ntional. Economists have acknowledged that beta conver-\ngence is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sigma\nconvergence.7\nIn this study, the following model is used to test absolute\nbeta convergence:\nT\ny\ny\ny\ni t T\ni t\ni t i t\nlog log ,\n,\n,\n, ,\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= + +\nwhere y\ni,t\nis the value of health indicator of province i at time t,\nT\ny\ny\ni t T\ni t\nlog ,\n,\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the growth rate per year from time t\nthrough time t + T,  is the intercept, and  is the error item;\n implies the presence of beta convergence. In our analysis,\na negative and significant value for beta means the presence\nof beta convergence. The estimated value of beta also indi-\ncates the rate of convergence. Besides, the following model\nis used to test conditional beta convergence:\nT\ny\ny\ny gX\ni t T\ni t\ni t i t i t\nlog log ,\n,\n,\n, , ,\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= + + +\nwhere X\ni,t\nrepresents the conditional variables including\ngross domestic product per capita, and population of prov-\nince i at time t.\nLiang et al 3\nIn this article, we first estimate the national convergence\nby calculating the sigma value of 7 health indicators. For 2\nstructure measures, we also estimate the regional conver-\ngence by categorizing China's 31 provinces into 3 regions:\nEastern China, Central China, and Western China, according\nto the classification in the China Health Statistics Year Book.\nThe conception of Eastern China, Western China, and Central\nChina is both geographic and economic. Provinces in Eastern\nChina are the most prosperous and richest. Provinces in\nWestern China are generally poor. Provinces in Central\nChina are generally better off than their western counter-\nparts. Eastern China contains 11 provinces and municipali-\nties: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu,\nZhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan.\nCentral China contains 8 provinces: Shanxi, Jilin,\nHeilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei.\nWestern China contains 12 provinces and 1 municipality:\nSichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi,\nGansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Inner\nMongolia. Average levels of each indicator in the 3 regions\nare calculated for comparison. Sigma convergence within\neach region is also tested.\nBesides, we also test both absolute and conditional beta\nconvergences for all 7 health indicators.\nIndicators for the Performance of China's Health\nSystem\nIndicators at the provincial level are selected to measure\nhealth system performance according to Donabedian's typol-\nogy. Seven health indicators are chosen according to the rel-\nevance, precision, and accessibility of the data. The definition\nand available years of data for each variable are listed in\nTable 1. Structure indicators include beds per 1000 people\nand physicians per 1000 people. These two structure indica-\ntors reflect the direct input of resources available for the\nhealth system. Process indicators include outpatient visits,\nhospital admissions, bed occupancy rate, and average length\nof stay (LOS) in hospitals, reflecting the utilization of outpa-\ntient and inpatient services. Maternal mortality rate is the\nsingle outcome indicator in our analysis. Maternal mortality\nis an appropriate indicator to be included in the study because\nit has been the focus of China's health services system for\nmany years. Other outcome measures such as infant mortal-\nity and life expectancy at birth would have been desirable to\nuse as well, but these data are only collected in China's\ndecennial census. Hence, they are excluded from the analysis\nas they are only reported in 3 years during the past 30 years.\nAll data are collected from the China Health Statistics\nYear Book and the China Statistics Year Book.17,18 We only\ninclude data of provinces and municipalities in mainland\nChina, excluding data from the Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative\nRegion, and Taiwan. It is notable that population data at the\nprovincial level are based on the National Population Census\nof the People's Republic of China. Thus, the per capita data\nare calculated based on the actual population of long-term\nresidents and migrants rather than the household registration\nsystem that excluded migrants. Thus, a large number of\nmigrant workers and their family members who are not reg-\nistered in the local household registration system are still\ncounted as local residents in the population census data.\nResults\nResults of the sigma convergence analysis are mixed. Sigma\nconvergence is found for the structure indicators, but not for\neither the process indicators or the outcome indicator. At the\nsame time, beta convergence is found in most chosen indica-\ntors, except for 2 process indicators (outpatient visits and\nhospital admissions).\nThe tested sigma value for physicians per thousand peo-\ngence of this indicator. Sigma fell sharply in the 1980s and\nTable 1.

Maternal death is defined as the death of\na woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, due to any\npregnancy-related cause, excluding irrelevant causes. According to WHO's definition,\nthe total number of pregnant women is substituted by total number of live births\nNote. LOS = length of stay in hospital; WHO = World Health Organization.\n(see Figure 1). The falling sigma value indicates that provin-\ncial mean levels of physicians per thousand people became\nFor beds per thousand people, no convergence is observed\nwhereas convergence after 2003 is seen (see Figure 3).\nFurther study on the mean number of beds per thousand peo-\nple at the provincial level probably explains the trends\ndescribed above (see Figure 4). Average beds per thousand\npeople in Eastern China, Central China, and Western China\nwere all below 2.5 in the early 1980s. From then on, the num-\nber of beds in Eastern China increased steadily in the 1980s\nand stayed almost stable in the late 1990s. However, in\nCentral China and Western China, bed supply increased\nto 2003, beds per thousand people in Central China and\nWestern China decreased. After 2003, all 3 regions experi-\nenced a sharp increase in average number of beds. In other\nwords, the gap between Eastern China and the other 2 regions\nwidened from the 1980s, reducing convergence.\nProvincial data for outpatient visits, hospital admissions,\nbed occupancy rates, and maternal mortality rate are only\navailable for less than 10 years. Sigma divergence is found\nfor bed occupancy rates. As for average LOS in hospital, the\nfell after 2000. The sigma values for the other 3 indicators\nfluctuated within the past 10 years.\nSigma convergence within each region (Eastern China,\nCentral China, and Western China) is also tested. Different\npatterns of convergence are found within different regions.\nFor physicians per thousand people, although nationwide\nsigma convergence is found, sigma convergence is not\nobserved within all regions. Western China showed no sigma\nyears. In Central China, sigma convergence is only observed\nafter 2000. In Eastern China, sigma convergence is found\nfrom the 1980s. These results indicate that within Central\nChina and Western China, variation in human resources did\nnot decrease along with the economic growth, but in the\nEastern China, convergence in human resources input\naccompanied overall economic growth. As for beds/1000,\nsigma convergence only occurred within Western China\nsigma convergence is only observed after 2000. Such differ-\nences might be due to unequal input of structure resources.\nBeta convergence has been found in most chosen indica-\ntors, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions (see\nTable 2). The estimated beta values indicate the speed of\nconvergence. In general, process and outcome indicators\nconverged much faster than structure indicators. Without\nFigure 1.

However, sustained\neconomic growth does not necessarily have equal impact on the\nstructure, process, and outcome of the health system. Sigma\nconvergence is found for resources across the provinces of\nChina during the long study period, but consistent results are not\nobserved for indicators of process and outcome. At the same\ntime, beta convergence is observed in 5 out of 7 health indica-\ntors, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions.\nIn our study, sigma convergence is found in 2 structure\nrowing gap of resource distribution. Such results are consis-\ntent with studies that used Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient,\nand the Theil index to describe the geographic distribution of\nhealth resources in China.19 Convergence could emerge\nwhen provinces with lower per capita resources caught up\nwith provinces with higher per capita resources, or when\nprovinces with higher per capita resources declined to the\nlevel of provinces with lower per capita resources. The tested\nbeta convergence in structure indicators suggests that prov-\ninces with lower per capita resources and worse performance\nwere catching up.\nThe underlying drivers of resource distribution in China\nduring the past 30 years are both market forces and govern-\nment power. In China, health care is mainly financed by\ngovernment investment, public health insurances, and out-\nof-pocket fees. The majority of government investments are\nfrom local government, rather than central government. The\nscale of resource input largely depends on local economic\nconditions.20 Public health insurance funds are also local-\nized. However, provinces in China have had unequal eco-\nnomic development since 1980s, resulting in an uneven\nlocal financial capacity to pay for health services. For the\nindicator of beds/1000, the trends of sigma divergence in\nanced economic development among provinces. However,\nthe obvious sigma convergence after 2000 probably repre-\nsented the input from central government. The 2000 World\nHealth Organization report on health system performance\nand the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis\npushed the central government to allocate resources toward\npublic health services and health equity issues. Since then,\nthe central government has expanded resource input dra-\nmatically to less developed areas in Central China and\nWestern China to build and expand primary hospitals and\npublic health facilities.21 Such enormous investment from\ncentral government and local government might contribute\nto the sigma convergence of structure indicators as well as\nbeta convergence in procedure and outcome indicators in\nrecent years. For instance, China's New Cooperative\nMedical Scheme, a large government subsidized health\ninsurance plan, has improved finances of township health\nMoreover, in 2009, the Chinese government implemented\nan ambitious health reform that is aimed to build up basic\nhealth services system for all.23 The success of these re-dis-\ntributive measures on physicians per capita seems be more\nambiguous than measured focused on beds.\nThe absence of constant sigma convergence in process and\noutcome indicators is probably the result of multiple factors.\nFirst, determinants outside the health system could influence\nthe process and outcome indicators differently. Although the\noutcome indicator, maternal mortality rate, is very sensitive to\nhealth services performance, it is also influenced by many\nsocial and cultural factors.24 Second, even if the gap in struc-\nture indicators was narrowed, changes in the process and out-\ncome variables would lag and may take years to observe. And\nlast but not least, the data availability has limited our ability\nto evaluate the convergence in process and outcome mea-\nsures. It is notable that the absence of constant sigma conver-\ngence does not contradict the tested beta convergence, as beta\nconvergence is not a sufficient condition for sigma conver-\ngence, which directly reflected the narrowed disparities.\nAlthough our data are collected from officially published\nsources, the accuracy of the data at the provincial level is\nTable 2. Beta Convergence Analysis Results.\nIndicators\nYears\navailable\nBeta coefficients of absolute\nbeta convergence\nBeta coefficients of conditional\nbeta convergence\nprobably imperfect. One concern for the accuracy of aggre-\ngate data is patient mobility. In China, some people travel to\nseek better health care in other provinces. These people are\nnot counted in the population data, as they are not local resi-\ndents. However, these people usually only seek specialty\ncare in tertiary hospitals, and thus should have little impact\non the overall health indicators. Second, data for most pro-\ncess and outcome indicators are only available for less than\n10 years, so it is difficult to determine the trend of sigma\nconvergence during the relatively short period of time. In\naddition, we are aware that most health indicators in this\narticle reflect the quantity of health resources and health ser-\nvice utilization, rather than the quality of care. However,\navailable data for outcome measures are scarce. If longitudi-\nnal data at the provincial level are available, many broader\noutcome measures, such as all-cause mortality and cause-\nspecific mortality, should be interesting to study in the future.\nConclusions\nConcerning health inequality in China, geographic variation\nof health system performance is examined at the provincial\nlevel. The degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence\nis measured for indicators of structure, process, and outcome\nof the health system. Sigma convergence is found in resource\nindicators like the number of physicians per thousand people,\nwhereas it is not observed in process and outcome indicators.\nBeta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 pro-\ncedure indicators. Thus, over the 30 years of economic growth,\nnot all health indicators have achieved convergence, and when\nsigma convergence did occur in structure indicators, it is still\nuncertain whether real equity has been achieved. It represents\na call for more central government resources allocated to\nresource-poor areas, and more efforts to promote health equity\nin the society, to possibly translating economic benefits into\nmore equitable distribution of health care resources.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
