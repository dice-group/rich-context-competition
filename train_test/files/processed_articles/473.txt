The odds of heavy\ndrinking and other drug use were lower among non-\nmedical users of prescription opioids motivated only by\npain relief compared with nonmedical users who re-\nported pain relief and other motives and those who re-\nported non\u00adpain relief motives only. The odds of medi-\ncal use of prescription opioids were lower among\nnonmedical users who reported only non\u00adpain relief mo-\ntives compared with other types of nonmedical users.\nConclusions: The findings indicate motives should be\nconsidered when working with adolescents who report\nnonmedical use of prescription opioids. Future efforts\nare needed to identify adolescents who may need appro-\npriate pain management and those at increased risk for\nprescription opioid abuse.\nfoundation for the treat-\nment of acute and chronic\npain and these medications\nare highly efficacious when\nused properly.1 However, the nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription opioids has in-\ncreased significantly among adolescents\nand young adults over the past decade in\nthe United States.2-5 The National Survey\non Drug Use and Health, the Monitoring\nthe Future (MTF) study, and the Na-\ntional Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol\nand Related Conditions represent 3 of the\nlargest national drug studies in the United\nferent measures to assess nonmedical use\nof prescription opioids, each measure in-\ncludes nonprescribed use of scheduled opi-\noid analgesics.

Those nonmedical us-\ners who reported \"to relieve pain\" as their sole motive\nhad fewer drug-related problems than other nonmedi-\ncal users.10,11 Furthermore, 1 study showed the odds of\ndrug-related problems did not differ between nonmedi-\ncal users who reported to relieve pain as their sole mo-\ntive and those individuals who did not engage in non-\nmedical use of prescription opioids.11\nAdolescence represents a particularly important devel-\nopmental period to understand motives for nonmedical\nuse of prescription opioids because individuals who ini-\ntiate nonmedical use of prescription opioids at or before\n18 years of age are more likely to develop prescription opi-\noid use disorders than those who initiate later in life.12 Ex-\namining the motives for nonmedical use of prescription\nopioids and related substance use behaviors in a national\nsample of high school seniors in the United States would\nhelp identify nonmedical users who may need appropri-\nate pain management and those at increased risk for drug\nabuse. Improving the knowledge base regarding motives\nfor nonmedical use of prescription opioids is critical for\ninforming clinical practice and designing effective pre-\nvention efforts. The objectives of the present study were\nto assess (1) the prevalence of motives for nonmedical use\nofprescriptionopioidsinanationallyrepresentativesample\nof high school seniors in the United States and (2) the as-\nsociations between motives for nonmedical use of pre-\nscription opioids and substance use behaviors and medi-\ncal use of prescription opioids.\nMETHODS\nThe MTF study annually surveys a cross-sectional, nationally rep-\nresentative sample of high school seniors in approximately 135\npublic and private schools in the coterminous United States.3 The\nMTF study uses a multistage sampling procedure. In stage 1, geo-\ngraphic areas or primary sampling units are selected; in stage 2,\nschools within primary sampling units are selected (with prob-\nability proportionate to class size); and in stage 3, students within\nschools are selected. The student response rates for high school\ncause so many questions are included in the MTF study, much\nof the questionnaire content is divided into 6 different question-\nnaire forms that are randomly distributed. This approach results\nin 6 virtually identical subsamples. The measures relevant for this\nstudy (eg, motives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids)\nwere asked on Form 1, so this study focuses on the subsamples\nreceiving Form 1 within each cohort.

The response scale ranged from 1 (none) to 7\n(2 or more packs per day). Marijuana and other illicit drug\nuse--including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, psychedelics other\nthan LSD, and heroin--were measured by asking respondents\nhow many occasions (if any) they used [specified drug] in\ntheir lifetime, past 12 months, and past 30 days.

All rights reserved.\nMedical use of prescription opioids was assessed by asking\nrespondents whether they had ever taken prescription opioids\nbecause a doctor told them to use them. Respondents were in-\nformed that prescription opioids are sometimes prescribed by\ndoctors and drugstores are not supposed to sell them without\na prescription. These included Vicodin, OxyContin, Perco-\ndan, Percocet, Demerol, Dilaudid, morphine, opium, and co-\ndeine. The response scale included (1) no; (2) yes, but I had\nalready tried them on my own; and (3) yes, and it was the first\ntime I took any.\nAnalyses were restricted to those respondents with complete\ndata on demographic characteristics and drug use variables. The\nunadjusted prevalence rates for motives to engage in nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription opioids--across demographic charac-\nteristics and substance use behaviors--were calculated with\ncross-tabulations. 2 Tests of homogeneity and logistic regres-\nsion analyses were conducted to determine whether sociode-\nmographic characteristics and substance use behaviors were sig-\nnificantly associated with motives for nonmedical use of\nprescription opioids. For purposes of analysis, the following 4\nmutually exclusive groups were examined: (1) no past-year non-\nmedical use of prescription opioids, (2) past-year nonmedical\nuse to relieve physical pain only, (3) past-year nonmedical use\nto relieve physical pain and other motives, and (4) past-year\nnonmedical use for motives other than to relieve physical pain.\nThe multistage sampling design resulted in clustering of data,\nwhich may cause some overstatement of the statistical signifi-\ncance when conducting analyses that do not fully account for\nthe complex design. Based on the number of comparisons being\nperformed, we used a conservative  of .01 for all 2 and lo-\ngistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).\nRESULTS\nApproximately 12.3% of the respondents--high school\nseniors in the United States--reported lifetime nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription opioids and 8.0% reported past-\nyear nonmedical use. Table 1 shows the prevalence of\nmotives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids among\nhigh school seniors in the United States. The leading mo-\ntives included \"to relax or relieve tension\" (56.4%), \"to\nfeel good or get high\" (53.5%), \"to experiment, see what\n\"to have a good time with friends\" (29.5%). The mo-\ntives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids did not\ndiffer between women and men based on 2 tests with 2\nexceptions; women reported higher prevalence rates than\nThe majority of nonmedical users of prescription opi-\noids reported more than 1 motive. Among nonmedical\nusers who reported motives, approximately 6.1% re-\nported pain relief as their only motive, 38.7% endorsed\npain relief and other motives, and 55.2% reported non\u00ad\npain relief motives only.\nThe association between past-year frequency of non-\nmedical use of prescription opioids and motives was ex-\namined. The past-year frequency of 10 or more occa-\nsions was significantly higher for several motives than\nthe past-year frequency of other motives (P.01).

The prevalence of nonmedical use to relieve pain\nis similar to the only other study to examine motives for\nnonmedical use of prescription opioids based on nation-\nally representative samples of American high school se-\nnonmedicalusersweremotivatedtorelievephysicalpain.13\nNotably, lifetime and annual prevalence rates of nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription opioids in the earlier study13 (10%\nand 6%, respectively) were lower than this study (12% and\n8%, respectively). Furthermore, the present study found\nthat nonmedical users of prescription opioids who re-\nported relief of physical pain as their sole motivation had\nsignificantly lower rates of substance use behaviors than\nother nonmedical users.\nRecent studies have identified several important char-\nacteristics of nonmedical use of prescription drugs that\ncan influence drug abuse potential, including fre-\nquency, coingestion with other drugs, and route of ad-\nministration.11,14-20 The findings of the present study pro-\nvide evidence that motives were significantly associated\nwith frequency of past-year nonmedical prescription opi-\noid use, nonoral routes of administration, coingestion of\nprescription opioids and other drugs, and substance use\nbehaviors. Nonmedical users of prescription opioids mo-\ntivatedonlytorelievephysicalpainhadconsiderablylower\nodds than nonmedical users reporting other motives to\ncoingest prescription opioids with other drugs or use pre-\nscription opioids via nonoral routes. Notably, nonmedi-\ncal users who reported physical pain relief and other mo-\ntives generally resembled nonmedical users who reported\nonly non\u00adpain relief motives in regard to substance use\nbehaviors. These results reinforce previous studies that\nhave shown adolescents and young adults who engage\nin nonmedical use of prescription opioids for motives\nother than \"to relieve pain\" are at increased risk for drug\nFuture clinical and research efforts should attempt to\ndifferentiate between motives for nonmedical use of pre-\nscription opioids because the present study identified sub-\ntypes that were significantly associated with medical use\nof prescription opioids and substance use behaviors. In-\nterestingly, we found few sex differences in the motives\nfor nonmedical use of prescription opioids, which re-\nsemblesfindingsfromearlierworkwithinsecondaryschool\nstudents.10,13 Notably, we found that more than 7 in every\n10 nonmedical users of prescription opioids motivated by\npain relief reported a lifetime history of medical use of pre-\nscriptionopioids.Recentworkindicatesnearly40%ofhigh\nschool seniors who reported nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion opioids in the past 12 months obtained these medi-\ncations from their own previous prescriptions.21 These re-\nsultssuggestthatappropriatepainmanagementandcareful\ntherapeutic monitoring could contribute to reductions in\nthe nonmedical use of prescription opioids among ado-\nlescents. In addition, the elevated rates of substance use\nbehaviors found among nonmedical users reporting any\nmotives other than \"to relieve physical pain\" indicate such\nbehaviors are part of a pattern of \"multiproblem\" behav-\nior.22 Taken together, these findings suggest screening ef-\nforts should be used to identify nonmedical users of pre-\nscription opioids who may require appropriate pain\nmanagement and/or those who need more comprehen-\nsive assessment for substance use disorders.\nBased on the elevated risk for substance abuse among\nnonmedical users who reported any motives other than \"to\nrelieve physical pain,\" future work should identify sub-\ngroups of nonmedical users who endorse combinations of\nmotives because most nonmedical users have multiple mo-\ntives underlying their behavior. Further, nonmedical us-\nersofprescriptionopioidsmotivatedonlybypainreliefhad\ngreater odds of more than 33% of the substance use out-\ncomes relative to their high school peers who did not use\nprescription opioids nonmedically. Future research is\nneeded to determine the extent to which increased rates\nof substance use among such individuals could be related\nto untreated pain. Although the risk for substance abuse\nappears to be lower among nonmedical users of prescrip-\ntion opioids motivated by pain relief relative to nonmedi-\ncal users with other motives, there are health risks to those\nwho use prescription opioids on their own, without a phy-\nsician's orders, regardless of motive. For example, non-\nmedical users of prescription opioids do not benefit from\nclinical assessments and monitoring nor do they receive\nimportant medical information that accompanies appro-\npriate pain management. Thus, nonmedical users are likely\nunaware of the medication's proper use, contraindica-\ntions, or potential for interaction with other drugs.\nThe present study had some limitations that need to\nbe taken into account while considering the implica-\ntions of the findings. First, the results may not be gen-\neralized to other adolescent populations because our\nsample was drawn from high school seniors and did not\ninclude individuals who had dropped out or who were\nabsent from school on the day of the survey administra-\ntion. Future research should examine motives for non-\nmedical use of prescription opioids in adolescents not at-\ntending high school to assess whether findings in the\npresent study can be replicated in other populations. Sec-\nond, nonresponse may have introduced potential bias in\nthe present study and the data are subject to the poten-\ntial bias introduced when collecting substance use be-\nhaviors via self-reports surveys. The present study at-\ntempted to minimize potential biases by implementing\nconditions that previous research has shown minimize\nbiases, such as informing potential respondents that par-\nticipation was voluntary and assuring potential respon-\ndents that data would remain confidential.23-25 The preva-\nlence rates of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in\nthe present study were comparable with rates reported\nfrom national studies of adolescents and young adults.5,8\nFinally, the cross-sectional design of the study pre-\nsented limitations and longitudinal studies are needed\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

In this regard, identifying mo-\ntivations associated with nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion opioids at an early stage can help distinguish\nindividuals in need of an evaluation for pain manage-\nment and/or those who need more comprehensive as-\nsessment and may require substance abuse treatment. The\nfindings of the present study suggest it is essential to move\naway from combining multiple subtypes into the same\nmeasure of nonmedical use of prescription opioids.\nCorrespondence: Sean Esteban McCabe, PhD, Sub-\nstance Abuse Research Center, University of Michigan,\nAnn Arbor, 2025 Traverwood Dr, Ste C, Ann Arbor, MI\nAuthor Contributions: Drs McCabe and Cranford had\nfull access to all of the data in the study and take respon-\nsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of\nthe data analysis.
