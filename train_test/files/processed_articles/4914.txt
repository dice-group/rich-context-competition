    "abstract": "Abstract\nDiminished vitamin D is common among older individuals. Sunlight contributes more to vitamin D synthesis than diet\nor supplementation. This study examined associations between objectively measured light exposure, vitamin D serum\nlevels, and bone biomarkers in 100 men aged over 60years. Light exposure was measured in lux via Actigraph monitors\nfor 1week. Significantly, greater levels of vitamin D were observed in participants with higher light exposure. Seasonal\ndifferences in lux were also noted. Significant differences in bone markers were not found. Objective measurement of\nlight exposure is an inexpensive, simple, and effective way to address vitamin D deficiency.\n",

Reduced levels of circulating serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) have been associated\nwith muscle weakness and reduced bone mineral density\n(BMD), along with subsequent falls and fractures leading\nto increased nursing home admissions (Weaver et al.,\n2010). Chronic deficiency results in osteomalacia (bone\nsoftening; known as rickets in children), osteoporosis\n(porous bone), faster turnover of calcium metabolic activ-\nity, and an increase in production of parathyroid hormone\n(PTH), which exacerbates the process of weakening bones\nsuspected to be important for maintaining proper immune\nsystem operation and cognitive function (Buell et al., 2010;\nHolick, 2004). Vitamin D may also offer a protective factor\nin a broad range of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, multi-\nple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia (Buell\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services esti-\nmated that one-third of the total US population is at risk due\nto insufficient (25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and\nng/mL) or deficient (25(OH)D concentrations below\n20ng/mL) levels of vitamin D and global estimates are as\npercent for older adults having vitamin D\ninjuries were estimated to cost the US$30\n(Center for Disease Control (CDC), 2014).

While\ndietary intake and supplementation augment production\nof vitamin D and provide a sparring effect, light exposure\nhas been documented to provide as much as 90percent of\nan individual's vitamin D requirement (Hall et al., 2010;\namount of light exposure necessary to positively affect\n25(OH)D levels varies based on personal circumstances\nlocation and time of year are two major determinants of\nvitamin D production. Those living in more northern loca-\ntions may experience virtually no vitamin D production\nfor nearly half of the year (Lips, 2001). Production is also\nheavily determined by skin composition as well. Vitamin\nD production is higher in lightly pigmented skin com-\npared to heavily pigmented skin (Lips, 2001). Furthermore,\nthe skin in senior adults can continue to produce the pre-\ncursors of vitamin D, but research shows that this organ\nno longer does so as efficiently as during youth because of\nreduced 7-dehydrocholesterol levels (American Geriatrics\nSociety Workgroup, 2013; MacLaughlin and Holick,\ncancer, public health organizations have given blanket\nrecommendations to limit sun exposure and increase use\nof sunscreen, which could be reducing population levels\nthat a minimal \"10-min exposure of head and arms (unpro-\ntected) three times per week is adequate to prevent vita-\nmin D deficiency\" or \"doses small enough to produce\nonly minimal tanning\" can create beneficial increases in\nCurrent research has not consistently demonstrated ben-\neficial effects or reduced risk of disease and falls in the\nolder population with the exclusive use of oral vitamin D\nHowever, despite continued debate on the role of supple-\nmentation in producing various positive outcomes, there is\nlittle doubt that sunshine is the most important contributor\nto healthy vitamin D levels (Autier et al., 2014; Theodoratou\net al., 2014). Research in objective monitoring of light\nexposure in respect to vitamin D and bone markers may\nyield valuable insight into diagnostic and treatment proto-\ncols in the older population.\nOne of the routinely used means of collecting outdoor\nactivity and light exposure is via sunlight exposure ques-\ntionnaires. Advantages of these instruments include low\ncost, fairly uncomplicated administration, and standardiza-\ntion (Falk and Anderson, 2012). However, questionnaires\nmay provide imprecise measurement of vitamin D status\ndue to the wide variety of personal factors that inhibit vita-\nmin D production, such as sunscreen use, clothing material,\nWearable light detection monitors have the potential to\nbecome valuable objective tools whose benefits include\ncost effectiveness, small size, and light weight, practicality\nin participants' natural environments, and allowance for\nmonitoring over long-term periods (Martin and Hakim,\n2011). This method is also an effective means of reducing\nrecall and reporting bias that could negatively impact the\ndata.\nPrevious research to determine a correlation between\nobjectively measured light in lux (one lumen per square\nmeter) and serum 25(OH)D levels has been limited and\nyielded mixed results. Calogiuri et al. (2013) found no\nsignificant differences in vitamin D levels for those in an\noutdoor versus indoor activity group but did find a small\npositive correlation between vitamin D levels and objec-\ntively measured light exposure. Their participant group\nwas limited in size (14), and the timetable between light\nexposure and blood draws being less than 24hours post-\nexposure may have been too short to have demonstrated\na significant difference in vitamin D levels. In another\nsimilar study, researchers in Korea were unable to con-\nfirm a relationship between serum 25(OH)D and sunlight\nmeasured by objective means; however, they noted\na small sample size (20 women) and low compliance\nwith outdoor activity due to cold weather during their\nNovember collection period as potential limiting factors\nClearly, institutionalized and/or housebound elderly\nindividuals are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.\nSo, what is the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency or\ninsufficiency in an older population if they are relatively\nactive? The Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of\nWar Studies had a unique opportunity to measure light\nexposure in a prior research project where activity and\nsleep were measured, and lux was included. We sought to\nidentify in the same cohort of 120 older men whether\nlight levels, measured by lux as a feature of ActiGraph\naccelerometer monitors, correlated with vitamin D and\nassociated bone metabolic biomarkers.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe participants were a subset of Vietnam-era repatriated\nprisoners of war (RPWs) from all branches of services, as\nwell as a matched comparison group (CG) of combat veter-\nans (who had been in similar combat but were never cap-\ntured/imprisoned). They have been voluntary contributors\nto the Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of War studies\nannual medical and psychological follow-up program\nwithin the Department of Defense since 1973. Their ages\nyears (mean\n=\n73, standard deviation\nand 24 CGs) who took part in medical follow-up at the\nFields et al. 3\nreported being in good physical health for their ages and\nwere able to travel to the Mitchell Center in Pensacola,\nFlorida, to engage in the study. Their average grip strength\nwas above normal (45\nkg) and their comfortable walking\ngait was on par with their age group (1.3m/s) (Bohannon,\nwere free from psychological diagnoses (76 participants).\nThey supplied actigraphy and lux data and had a vitamin D\nassay collected as part of their routine medical follow-up.\nwere omitted because they did not have a vitamin D assay\ncollected at the time of actigraphy collection. Particulars of\nthis cohort have been previously published (Segovia et al.,\n2013). This study was reviewed and approved by an institu-\ntional review board, and all participants included in this\nresearch have consented to being included in the study.\nLux meters\nActiGraphTM GT3X+ monitors (ActigraphTM; LLC,\nPensacola, FL, USA) with lux meters were used to gather\nexposure to light in our participants. These actigraphy mon-\nitors include triaxial accelerometers that identify move-\nment, steps, kilocalories, as well as lux. The monitors have\n512MB of memory and activity and light collection\noccurred at 30Hz. Participants wore the monitor for seven\nconsecutive days and nights on their non-dominant wrist.\nTypical lux level estimates for the GT3X+ were as follows\n(Table 1).\nProcedures\nBlood samples were obtained as part of routine clinical\npractice, which included serum vitamin D, and other rele-\nvant bone biomarker data (calcium, phosphorous, and alka-\nline phosphatase). Actigraphy monitors with lux meters\nwere scheduled to turn on when participants returned home.\nLux levels were collected for 7days and nights from 92 of\nthe 100 participants. Of the remaining eight participants,\nseven wore the ActiGraph for 6days, and therefore, lux was\ngathered for only those 6days, and one participant wore the\nActiGraph for only 4days. These eight had forgotten to put\non the device at the designated time.\nData analysis\nng/mL is widely considered\nwithin normal limits. Using this criterion as a cut point for\nnormal (30ng/mL) and abnormal (<30ng/ml) vitamin D\nlevels, the data were divided into these two groupings to\ncompare average daily light (in lux) exposure collected\nfrom the ActiGraph and the associated bone metabolic bio-\nmarkers. Since it took a year to collect this amount of data,\nseasonal differences had to be accounted for as well. The\ndata were divided into the four seasons based on the official\ncalendar start of the season in the northern hemisphere (i.e.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics of seasonal quartiles and mean lux\nillustrated differences in mean lux levels, particularly for\nfall and winter (see Table 2).

This finding was expected since there is\na direct correlation between exposure to ultraviolet B\n(UVB) and serum concentrations of vitamin D. While the\nassociations were not robust across all potential interac-\ntions between objectively collected light and vitamin D val-\nues, some of the associations were significant and indicate\nthat further evaluation within a larger and more controlled\ndesign is prudent. A broad range of personal factors could\nhave influenced the data including diet, clothing choice,\nand sunscreen use.\nWhile there is no globally accepted stratum defining\nng/mL is\ncommonly considered within normal limits. Using this cri-\nterion as a cut point for normal and abnormal vitamin D\nlevels and comparing with average daily light (in lux)\nexposure collected from ActiGraph monitors, this study\nwas able to partially establish anticipated seasonal differ-\nences in lux levels with winter and fall lux rates signifi-\ncantly lower than summer. These differences may be based\nupon seasonal sunlight variations as well as more amenable\nweather conditions that contribute to extended outdoor\nexposure.Also observed was an overall interaction between\nobjectively measured sunlight with serum vitamin D levels\nshowing that participants with abnormal vitamin D levels\nhad significantly less average daily light exposure com-\npared to those within normal limits of vitamin D. A signifi-\ncant increase in both lux values and vitamin D were\nobserved during the fall season only. Contrary to expecta-\ntion, the light exposure and vitamin D interaction was not\nsignificant across all seasons nor was it associated with\nbone metabolic markers.\nLimitations\nThe use of a cohort of aged Caucasian men from a high\nsocioeconomic status restricts the ability to generalize\nresults to the average US population. Also, there were no\ndata collected on diet, nutritional supplementation, or sun-\nscreen use for the participants. Additionally, serum PTH\nlevels may have provided additional insight but were not\npart of the routine laboratory tests. Finally, this study is a\ncross-sectional study, and causality cannot be determined.\nDespite these constraints, it is important to note that our\nfindings are similar to results observed in previous research\ndemonstrating the importance of continued research into\nobjectively measured sunlight on the production of vitamin\nD and overall bone health.\nConclusion\nWith a large portion of the US population diagnosed with\nabnormal vitamin D levels and associated costs of fall-\nrelated injuries estimated in the billions of dollars, it is\nimportant to explore all available avenues of diagnosis and\ntreatment of abnormal vitamin D. Today's advances in\ntechnology have contributed to the production of smaller\nand less invasive personal health monitoring devices; the\nuse of light meters to objectively obtain personal data on\nlight exposure could offer healthcare providers, patients,\nand caregivers an opportunity to reliably evaluate reduced\nsunlight as a potential impediment to positive overall\nhealth. They could also provide a uniquely accurate and\nreliable tool for treatment and evaluation of any benefits\nreceived by sunlight therapy. Future research of vitamin D\nlevels in older populations would benefit from the contin-\nued use of objectively measured sunlight exposure while\ncontrolling for such factors as dietary and supplementation\nintake of vitamin D as well as sunscreen use.\n"
