    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nYY1 (Yin and Yang 1) is a multifunctional, ubiquitously\nexpressed, zinc finger protein that can act as a tran-\nscriptional activator, repressor, or initiator element binding\nprotein. Previous studies have shown that YY1 modulates\nthe activity of reporter genes driven by the myelin PLP\n(proteolipid protein) (PLP1/Plp1) promoter. However, it is\nknown that Plp1 intron 1 DNA contains regulatory elements\nthat are required for the dramatic increase in gene activity,\ncoincident with the active myelination period of CNS (central\nnervous system) development. The intron in mouse contains\nmultiple prospective YY1 target sites including one within\na positive regulatory module called the ASE (anti-silencer/\nenhancer) element. Results presented here demonstrate that\nYY1 has a negative effect on the activity of a Plp1-lacZ fusion\ngene [PLP(+)Z] in an immature oligodendroglial cell line (Oli-\nneu) that is mediated through sequences present in Plp1\nintron 1 DNA. Yet YY1 does not bind to its alleged site in the\nASE (even though the protein is capable of recognizing a\ntarget site in the promoter), indicating that the down-\nregulation of PLP(+)Z activity by YY1 in Oli-neu cells does\nnot occur through a direct interaction of YY1 with the ASE\nsequence. Previous studies with Yy1 conditional knockout mice\nhave demonstrated that YY1 is essential for the differentiation\nof oligodendrocyte progenitors. Nevertheless, the current study\nsuggests that YY1 functions as a repressor (not an activator) of\nPlp1 gene expression in immature oligodendrocytes. Perhaps\nYY1 functions to keep the levels of PLP in check in immature\ncells before vast quantities of the protein are needed in mature\nmyelinating oligodendrocytes.\n",

The structure\nof the gene in mouse and man is quite similar (reviewed in\nconserved between the two species, demonstrating 50%\nidentity for the proximal 1.3 kb of sequence and 91% identity\namong the initial 135 nucleotides using the algorithm of Myers\nand Miller (1988). Moreover, the sequence orthologous to site\non the numbering system by Macklin et al. (1987)] is highly\nconserved, having 93% identity with the human sequence.\nWithin this sequence there is an exact match to a high affinity\nCCAT core YY1 target site (consensus5 VDCCATNWY) (Yant\net al., 1995) that is identical to the corresponding sequence in\nman. However, unlike the case when the human PLP1 promoter\nwas used to drive a reporter gene in glial cell lines (Berndt et al.,\n1992), deletion of `site 3' from the mouse Plp1 promoter did\nnot cause a major diminution in the levels of reporter gene\nactivity (Wight et al., 1997), suggesting that this sequence does\nnot function as a positive regulatory element in mouse. More\nrecently it has been shown that overexpression of YY1 in the\nimmortalized mouse oligodendroglial cell line, Oli-neu, causes\na dose-dependent decrease in mouse Plp1 promoter driven\nreporter gene activity when the cells were kept proliferating in\ngrowth medium (ODM) and 1% horse serum (He et al., 2007a).\nHowever, YY1 overexpression did not lead to a significant\nchange in reporter gene activity when the cells were pressed\nto differentiate by dibutyryl cAMP treatment the day fol-\nlowing transfection, except perhaps for a slight decrease\nwith the highest amount (2 mg/well) of YY1 plasmid (He et al.,\n2007a). Thus, if anything, the mouse counterpart to site 3\n(termed prom 3) appears to function as a negative regulatory\nelement.\nWhile the aforementioned studies have focused on effects\nof YY1 via regulatory sequences within the promoter and\nadjoining 59-flanking DNA, the first intron of the mouse Plp1\ngene also contains many prospective YY1 binding sites (Wight\nand Dobretsova, 1997). Transgenic mouse studies (Li et al.,\nPlp1-lacZ fusion genes is critical to attain high levels of\nexpression in brain during the active myelination period\nof CNS development, in keeping with the temporal pattern\nexhibited by the endogenous Plp1 gene. Transfection analysis\nusing a battery of Plp1-lacZ constructs containing partial\ndeletion of Plp1 intron 1 DNA revealed the presence of a\nsingle positive-regulatory element within the intron that is\nbeing able to overcome (or counterbalance) the effects from\nnegative-regulatory elements located elsewhere in the intron,\nthe positive-regulatory element functions as an enhancer in\nwe designated the positive regulatory element ASE (anti-\nsilencer/enhancer). The ASE has been minimally mapped to\n2004) and contains an exact match to a high affinity YY1\ntarget site (consensus5VDCCATNWY; Yant et al., 1995) spanning\nother potential YY1 binding sites with exact matches to the\nCCAT core consensus sequence. To address the effects that these\nsites might play in modulating Plp1 gene expression, transfec-\ntion analysis was performed in Oli-neu cells with Plp1-lacZ\nfusion genes containing all, some, or none of mouse Plp1 intron\n1 DNA. Oli-neu cells were used for this study because they are\nslightly more mature than N20.1 cells, based on the relative\namounts and types of splice variants expressed by several myelin\ngenes including Plp1 (Pereira et al., 2011). In some experiments\ncells were co-transfected with an expression construct to\nincrease the levels of YY1. Here we report that inclusion of Plp1\nintron 1 DNA greatly enhances the levels of Plp1-driven lacZ\nexpression in Oli-neu cells. The increase in expression is largely\nattributable to the ASE regulatory element. However, over-\nexpression of YY1 mitigates this response, apparently through an\nindirect mechanism. YY1 did not bind to the alleged target motif\nin the ASE as determined by gel shift analysis, although it did to\na target site in prom 3 from the promoter. Both the ASE and\nprom 3 contain an exact match to the YY1 consensus sequence\n(VDCCATNWY). Therefore, the YY1 consensus sequence can be\nrefined further based on differences in the sequence between\nASE and prom 3.\nCell culture\nDr Patrizia Casaccia (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) gene-\nrously provided the mouse Oli-neu cell line (Jung et al., 1995)\nwith permission from Dr. Jacqueline Trotter (University of\nMainz).

PLP(+)Z also contains all of Plp1 intron 1\nDNA, whereas PLP(2)Z lacks the intron altogether. The\ncorresponding partial deletion constructs contain some of\nPlp1 intron 1 DNA and were named according to the deleted\nthe entire intron from positions 1\u00ad8140 (Wight and Dobretsova,\n1177) inserted into the PstI site at the deletion\u00adjunction site of\nclarity.\nF-YY1 (FLAG-tagged YY1) was expressed from the plasmid\nhuman YY1 immediately downstream of the CMV (cyto-\nmegalovirus) promoter in pCEP4F (Zhu et al., 1995).

Empty vector (pBluescript\nSK+; Stratagene) was added to bring the total amount of DNA\nto 3 mg per well. Each Plp1-lacZ construct was transfected in\nduplicate per experiment. In some cases, pCEP4F-YY1 was\nincluded as well. Cells were transfected using the FuGENETM 6\nTransfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) according\nto the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 4.5 ml of the\nFuGENETM 6 Reagent was mixed with 95.5 ml of DMEM (with-\nout serum) before adding plasmid DNA (3 mg total in 16.7 ml of\nsterile water). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room\ntemperature and then added directly to the culture medium of\nan individual well. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-DNA\naddition in 190 ml of Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega). The\nGalacto-Light Plus Kit (Applied Biosystems) and Luciferase\nAssay System (Promega) were used to determine the relative\nlevels for b-gal (b-galactosidase) and luciferase activity,\nrespectively, as described earlier (Dobretsova and Wight,\n1999). Luminescence was detected using an AutoLumat LB\n953 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) as RLU (relative light\nunits). Values for b-gal activity were corrected for differences\nin transfection efficiency first by subtracting the amount of\nbackground luminescence inherent in the b-gal and luciferase\nassays as determined by the RLU generated in lysates prepared\nfrom cells transfected with pBluescript SK+ alone, and then\nby adjusting the b-gal RLU in proportion to a set amount\n(26106 RLU) of luciferase activity. Results are presented as the\nmeans\u00a1S.D. of b-gal activity relative to that obtained for\nPLP(2)Z transfected cells, which was arbitrarily set at 1 (fold)\nin every experiment, and were calculated from at least three\nindependent experiments.

In\nparticular, the PLP(+)Z transgene depicted in Figure 1, which\nutilizes Plp1 genomic DNA [proximal 2.4 kb of 59-flanking\nDNA downstream to the first 37 bp of exon 2] to drive lacZ\nreporter gene expression, is temporally regulated in brain\nsimilar to that of the endogenous Plp1 gene. However, the\ndevelopmental increase that is normally reached during\nthe active myelination period is severely attenuated when\nPlp1 intron 1 DNA is omitted from the transgene [PLP(2)Z\nconstruct depicted in Figure 1].\nDeletion-transfection analysis with constructs equivalent\nto PLP(+)Z aside from missing a portion of Plp1 intron 1 has\nidentified a single positive regulatory element (ASE) and\nmultiple negative regulatory elements that are functional in\nDobretsova et al., 2004). The cumulative effects of these\nregulatory elements are counterbalanced in N20.1 cells,\nhence PLP(+)Z and PLP(2)Z yield relatively similar levels of b-\ngal activity in transfected cells. However, as shown in\nFigure 2, the relative levels of b-gal activity in transfected\nOli-neu cells is much greater for PLP(+)Z (,50-fold higher)\nthan PLP(2)Z. To test the effects that increased levels of YY1\nmight have on this ratio, Oli-neu cells were co-transfected\nwith a YY1 expression plasmid (pCEP4F-YY1). Elevated levels\ncaused a dramatic drop in the b-gal activity for PLP(+)Z,\nwhich was not significantly different from that obtained with\nPLP(2)Z (Figure 2). Increased amounts of YY1 plasmid led\nto a further decrease, in a dose-dependent manner.

Similar to the results presented in Figure 2,\noverexpression of YY1 led to a significant decrease in the\nrelative levels of b-gal activity in PLP(+)Z transfected cells\ncompared with those transfected with PLP(2)Z (Figure 3).\nresulted in a dramatic decrease in the levels of b-gal activity\ncompared with PLP(+)Z transfected cells containing endogen-\nous levels of YY1 (i.e. not co-transfected with pCEP4F-YY1).\nF] was able to fully restore the levels of b-gal activity back to\nthose obtained with PLP(+)Z (Figure 3). However, overexpres-\nsion of YY1 caused a significant decrease in the levels of b-gal\n(Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, the amount of nuclear YY1\nproduced by the YY1 expression plasmid exceeded the\nendogenous level, and was discernible by an increase in\nmolecular weight on account of the FLAG tag. Taken together,\nthese data suggest that overexpression of YY1 has a negative\neffect on the action of the ASE in Oli-neu cells.\nYY1 levels are similar in Oli-neu and N20.1\noligodendroglial cell lines\nBecause the ASE appears far more potent in Oli-neu cells\n5807+ASE-F transfected cells compared with PLP(2)Z was\nFigure 1 Schematic diagram of the mouse Plp1 gene and related Plp1-lacZ constructs\nThe mouse Plp1 gene is shown at the top and contains seven major exons (black boxes) that span 15.6 kb of DNA.

A positive regulatory element called the ASE (green star) is located within the first intron at\nDobretsova, 1997). Plp1-lacZ constructs pertinent to this study are depicted directly below the gene. All constructs contain 2.4 kb of\nmouse Plp1 59-flanking DNA, exon 1 and the first 37 bp of exon 2, which is fused (in-frame) to a lacZ expression cassette (blue box).\nIn addition, PLP(+)Z also contains all of Plp1 intron 1 DNA, whereas PLP(2)Z is missing the intron altogether. The intron 1 partial\ndeletion constructs contain a portion of Plp1 intron 1 DNA and were named accordingly. For instance, PLPD809\u00ad5807 is missing\nin the native (forward; F) orientation.

Likewise, when\nprom 3 was used as a probe, a similarly sized EMSA complex\nwas formed (lane 14), which could be competed for by\nthe addition of unlabelled YY1 consensus oligonucleotide,\nsuggesting that YY1 can bind to this region of the mouse Plp1\npromoter. However, when an upstream oligonucleotide (prom\n1) was tested that corresponds to mouse Plp1 59-flanking\nbut two mismatches relative to the YY1 consensus, no DNA\u00ad\nprotein complex was formed (lane 2). Hence, sequences\nflanking the CCAT core are also critical for YY1 binding.\nEMSA analysis was also performed with nuclear extracts\nfrom Oli-neu cells that had been transfected with pCEP4F-\nYY1 two days earlier.

Yet YY1 has been shown to bind\nto target sites within the first intron of (other) genes and\nexpression. Because mouse Plp1 intron 1 DNA contains mul-\ntiple putative YY1 binding sites (Wight and Dobretsova, 1997)\nand is essential for the generation of high levels of Plp1-lacZ\ntransgene expression in brain during the active myelination\nperiod of CNS development (Li et al., 2002b), effects from\nelevated levels of YY1 on Plp1-lacZ gene activity via Plp1\nintron 1 sequences were investigated in the current study.\nPreviously it has been shown that targeted ablation of Yy1\nin oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through the use of Cnp-\ncre mice results in hypomyelination and cells being arrested\nat an immature stage (He et al., 2007a). The impediment in\ndevelopment is likely due to an inability to transcriptionally\ndown-regulate the expression of oligodendrocyte differenti-\nto the promoters of these inhibitors during oligodendrocyte\nprogenitor differentiation causing `repression of repressors',\nwhich in turn is required for differentiation to progress (He\nmRNA levels for Plp1, MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein),\nand UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase (Ugt8) in\nthe brains of YY1 conditional knockout mice at postnatal day\noligodendrocyte terminal differentiation.\nOn the other hand, YY1 overexpression in glial cells via\ntransfection has produced a variety of effects, some of which\nare contradictory. Endogenous levels of Plp1 gene transcripts\nin primary cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitors were\nlargely unchanged when transfected with different amounts\n(0.5, 1 and 2 mg) of a plasmid (pCX-yy1) which expresses human\nYY1 (He et al., 2007a). However, it is unclear exactly what\nthe transfection efficiency was in those experiments. If the\nefficiency was relatively low, then any changes in Plp1 gene\nexpression due to the elevation in YY1 levels would likely have\nbeen obscured by the high background of untransfected cells.\nConsequently, most studies have utilized Plp1-reporter gene\nconstructs co-transfected with YY1 expression plasmids to\ndetermine how YY1 modulates Plp1 gene activity. Ideally,\nanother reporter plasmid such as RSVL would also be included\nin order to correct for differences in transfection efficiency\nbetween samples.\nIn the present study, where differences in transfection\nefficiency have been accounted for, overexpression of YY1 in\nOli-neu cells caused a decrease in PLP(+)Z expression relative\nto that for PLP(2)Z (Figure 2). Given that both Plp1-lacZ\nconstructs are equivalent except for the addition of Plp1\nintron 1 DNA in PLP(+)Z, the down-regulation of PLP(+)Z\nexpression must have been mediated through regulatory\nFigure 7 YY1 does not bind directly to the ASE sequence, but does to a motif in the mouse Plp1 promoter\nEMSA analysis was performed with the indicated 32P-labelled probes (46104 c.p.m./reaction). Unlabeled DNA (200-fold molar\nexcess) was added to some reactions as a potential `cold' competitor. See Table 1 for sequences of the oligonucleotides (double-\nstranded 27-mers). The respective probes were incubated either with nuclear extracts (4 mg nuclear proteins/reaction) prepared from\nextract prepared from transfected cells, which is the same as that used for the Western-blot analysis shown in Figure 4. Arrow points\nto a specific DNA\u00adprotein complex formed by nuclear proteins (most probably YY1) binding to the YY1 consensus and prom 3 probes.\nReactions containing purified YY1 also formed a complex with slightly reduced mobility due to inclusion of a polyhistidine tag on the\nprotein.\nO.

Indeed, activity of the ASE (a very\npotent enhancer in Oli-neu cells) was thwarted by elevated\nlevels of YY1 (compare the relative b-gal activities for\nwithout the YY1 expression plasmid in Figure 3). However,\neven though the ASE contains a potential YY1 binding motif\nthat complies exactly with the VDCCATNWY consensus, YY1\ndid not bind to this sequence, although it could to another fit\nsituated in the promoter (prom 3; Figure 6) analogous to the\ncircumstances with site 3 in the human PLP1 promoter\n(Berndt et al., 2001). [Analysis of the mouse Plp1 sequence\nusing MatInspector (Cartharius et al., 2005) revealed a YY1\nmotif in the sequence for prom 3, but not the ASE, using the\nconsensus sequence CGCCATNTT as defined by Kim et al.\ncleotides contain a mismatch at position 2 compared with the\ntide contains an additional mismatch (TRC) at the last\nposition, it is likely that the terminal thymidine residue is\nimportant for YY1 binding.] Hence elevated levels of YY1\nappear to counter ASE function (albeit not through direct\nbinding to the ASE sequence itself), and consequently down-\nregulate Plp1-lacZ gene activity in Oli-neu cells. As well, YY1\noverexpression in Oli-neu cells has been shown to have a\nnegative effect on the activity of a reporter gene whose\nexpression is driven wholly by the mouse Plp1 promoter (and\nexpression of the mouse Plp1 gene appears to be negatively\naffected by YY1. Curiously, the human promoter was\npositively regulated by YY1 in CG4 cells (rat oligodendroglial\ncell line), although increasing the amounts of YY1 plasmid\ntransfected was inversely correlated with reporter gene\nactivity (PLP1-CAT activity/mg protein) that had not been\ncorrected for any deviations in transfection efficiency (Berndt\net al., 2001). Whether these seemingly incongruent findings\nare the result of differences in the host cell (Oli-neu vs. CG4)\nand/or the relative amount of YY1 plasmid transfected to\nPlp1-reporter construct, or simply misleading because varia-\ntions in transfection efficiency had not been accounted for in\nsome studies, or truly due to a species-specific difference\nin the gene's regulation is presently unknown. Nonetheless,\ndown-regulation of mouse Plp1 driven reporter gene expression\nby YY1 is in line with the results obtained from mice with\nconditional ablation of yy1 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. He\net al. (2007a) demonstrated that YY1 expression is necessary for\noligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. Presumably, YY1 is\nrequired to repress expression of terminal differentiation\ninhibitors. When oligodendrocyte progenitors isolated from\nthe cortex of neonatal Yy1floxed/floxed mice were transduced with\na CMV-Cre adenoviral vector and subsequently encouraged to\ndifferentiate by mitogen withdrawal, PLP immunoreactivity was\nmuch decreased in the YY1 ablated cells because they failed to\ndifferentiate. However, this does not mean, a priori, that YY1 is\nan activator of mouse Plp1 gene expression. In fact, our results\nand those of He et al., (2007a) suggest that YY1 negatively\ninfluences its expression through sequences in Plp1 intron 1 and\nthe promoter, respectively. Yet, when Oli-neu cells are pressed to\ndifferentiate, elevated levels of YY1 did not significantly alter\nthe activity of a mouse Plp1 promoter-luciferase construct\nexcept for possibly a slight decrease with the highest amount\n(2 mg/well) of YY1 plasmid tested (He et al., 2007a). Thus the\nrepressive effect of YY1 on Plp1 gene expression appears to\nlessen (or be lost) as the cells move through the latter stages of\ndifferentiation. Perhaps YY1 helps to keep Plp1 gene activity\nlevels in check in immature cells before copious quantities of\nPLP are needed in myelinating oligodendrocytes.\nTaken together, our results and those of others (He et al.,\ngene expression in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and im-\nmature oligodendrocytes. The decrease in Plp1 gene activity\ncaused by YY1 is mediated in part through sequences present in\nthe first intron, and with respect to the ASE does not occur via\ndirect recognition of a YY1 target site. Perhaps elevated levels\nof YY1 cause a decrease in the expression of one or more of the\nactivators that form a complex on the ASE. Alternatively, YY1\noverexpression could diminish ASE activity by having an effect\non the posttranslational modification of an ASE constituent, or\nbind via a protein\u00adprotein interaction and subsequently recruit\na negative regulatory factor to the ASE complex. No matter\nwhat, this is above and beyond any effect mediated through\nthe promoter (e.g. prom 3) since all of the Plp1-lacZ constructs\nused in the present study contain the same Plp1 59-flanking\nDNA. It is worth mentioning that this effect was observed in the\nface of proportionately much less transfected YY1 plasmid\nthat focused solely on the PLP1/Plp1 promoter (and adjacent\n59-flanking DNA). In summary, YY1 appears to function as a\nnegative regulator of mouse Plp1 gene activity via multiple\nregions of the gene, including the first intron.\n"
