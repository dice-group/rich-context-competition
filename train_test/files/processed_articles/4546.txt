    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study examined the perception of aging among a cohort of pre-service teachers undertaking an undergraduate\ndegree in primary school education. Using a self-reported questionnaire adapted from the work of Rubin and Berntsen, 331\nundergraduate students were asked a series of questions relating to their perceptions of aging. It was concluded that younger\npre-service teachers held a more positive perception of aging than older pre-service teachers. Younger pre-service teachers\nseemed to display a greater level of optimism toward future life experiences, eager to explore their world and make new\nrelationships, than were older aged students.\n",

Furthermore, it is generally claimed that most adults\nwant to remain young and claim to be younger than their\nbiological age and, in particular, see younger years (18-39\nyears) as the golden years (Rubin & Berntsen, 2006; Stephan\net al., 2011). Therefore, the question of why this discrepancy\nexists in terms of life span of adults wanting to be younger\nneeds to be explored. One way to account for this discrep-\nancy is to explore perceptions around aging within a homo-\ngeneous group of adults (i.e., pre-service teachers) with a\nshared common experience, to provide a qualified, holistic\nexplanation. Thus, exploring how pre-service teachers per-\nceive their own age may provide insights into how they come\nto document or record their own aging process in terms of\ntheir own life trajectory (Henderson, Goldsmith, & Flynnm,\n1995). The present study will fill a gap in the literature in\nterms of how adult pre-service teachers come to perceive\ntheir own aging. Knowing how pre-service teachers perceive\ntheir own aging will provide insight into the discrepancy of\nwhy adults want to appear younger than they are\nbiologically.\nThis notion of wanting to remain young is neither a new\nnor novel concept, as it stretches back to age old cultures,\nmythologies, and legends, where individuals over time have\ngrappled to live longer and younger, and defy the aging pro-\ncess (Eibach, Mock, & Courtney, 2010). A biological under-\nstanding of aging argues that aging is an inevitable biological\nconstruct that not only involves physical and psychological\nchange but can also neither be turned back nor stopped\ninvestment has been made into scientific research to find\nways for people to defy the very process of aging (Couteur &\ngerontology have led to the discovery of a molecule called\nResveratrol, which when consumed claims to improve health\nand increase longevity; however, while this has not been\nadequately tested on human beings, many individuals seem\nto be using this drug to defy aging (Baur et al., 2006).\nFurthermore, the use of antioxidants to delay aging has not\nbeen found to be an effective defense against aging either\n(Couteur & Sinclair). To this end, medical science or bio-\ngerontology, while trying to address the issue of longevity,\nstill appears to have no conclusive answers to preventing\naging. Therefore, the answer may not lie in medicine, and\ngiven this, perhaps it is better to address aging from an \"atti-\ntude\" point of view in terms of a developmental trajectory\nperspective around aging, subjective experience, and percep-\nFor this article, the life span is divided into the following\nstages: infancy, early childhood, middle childhood,\n1University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nJ-F, Faculty of Education, University of Tasmania, Locked Bag 1307,\nEmail: j.f@utas.edu.au\nPre-Service Teachers' Perception of Age\nThrough a Developmental Lens\nJ-F1, K.

It is also claimed that adults\nabove the age of 40 report feeling 20% younger; it is further\nasserted that the process of discrepancy between actual age\nand ideal age increases with chronological age (Barak et al.,\n2001). To this end, a great majority of adults (40+ years) per-\nceive younger age (18-39 years) to be far more exciting, fun,\nand enjoyable and view aging as a barrier to their quality of\nsupported the above by noting that older adults are not only\nlikely to deny their actual age but also see themselves as\nyounger than they are. Monk and Eibach (2011) argued that\nhow a person feels about his or her own age is an important\nphenomenological concept as it \"determines whether people\ntake into account their aging attitudes when evaluating their\nown lives\" (p. 979); thus, exploring how adults perceive and\ncome to see their own age can provide insights into the dis-\ncrepancy between how they feel about their own age, their\nactual age, and the aging process in general.\nPerhaps then, subjective experience in terms of attitudes\nshow how one comes to process his or her own aging, it may\nbe necessary to consider this as a prelude to explaining the\ndiscrepancy of wanting to be younger. Monk and Eibach\n(2011), in a 10-year longitudinal study, found that when indi-\nviduals have unfavorable aging attitudes, they are likely to\nexperience negative outcomes in their aging. Data were col-\nlected at two different time periods: Wave 1 initial surveys\n(n = more than 7,000) were collected by MacArthur Midlife\nset of data was collected by the Institute on Aging at the\nThe second survey contained more than 70% of the partici-\npants from the original sample. Aging attitudes and life satis-\nfaction questions were posed through a questionnaire, and\nthis measured positive and negative attitudes about the aging\nprocess. Subjective age was measured through the difference\nbetween reported chronological age and the age participants\nreported feeling. Monk and Eibach found that participants in\nthan their chronological age. In terms of positive affect, it\nwas found that better perceived health around aging led to\npositive affect, and negative perceived health led to negative\naffect among participants. Based on this finding, Monk and\nEibach claimed that subjective age and well-being are depen-\ndent on a person's attitude toward aging. However, equally,\nhow one quantifies and measures subjective age, well-being,\nand attitudes likely vacillates the findings; hence, consider-\nation must be given to how one comes to experience his or\nher own aging beyond a later positive and negative affect.\nTo understand aging, Rubin and Berntsen (2006) closely\nexamined three questions: What is the distribution of subjec-\ntive age over life span? Does it support the age denial life-\nspan-developmental view? and Are there discrepancies in\nage denial in early adulthood? All of the participants (N =\nThere was a 58% response rate to the surveys. All of the\nquestions in the survey were concerned with how one felt\nabout his or her age (e.g., How old do you feel inside?).\nResults showed that age discrepancy among participants\ngrew exponentially as participants got older until the age of\n40, after which there was no significant change. Furthermore,\nyounger participants (up to age 25) reported feeling older\nthan their chronological age, meaning that they were more\nfavorable toward aging. However, 70% participants above\nthe age of 39 reported that they felt younger, while 27%\nreported they felt exactly the same as their age, and only 2%\nreported feeling older than their age. Overall, this study\nfound that participants reported that they felt 20% younger\nthan their actual age, and this was more predominant in par-\nticipants in their 40s and above.\nIn terms of perceptions around aging, Montepare and\nLachman (1989), using a life-span-developmental frame-\nwork, explained this discrepancy between actual age, ideal\nage, and felt age by noting that \"the tendency of aging adults\nto maintain younger subjective age identities is a form of\ndefensive denial by which they can dissociate themselves\nfrom the stigma attached to growing old\" (p. 73). Langer\n(2010) argued that how one perceived his or her age influ-\nenced his or her quality of life, life satisfaction, and how one\ncomes to age. Langer found that there was an increase in\nquality of life, health, and longevity among elderly when\nthey were encouraged to re-think how they viewed aging,\nsuch that those who were able to perceive their aging posi-\ntively became healthier and more active. Stephan et al.\nyouthful subjective age (e.g., the sense of feeling younger\nthan one's own age) leads to greater life satisfaction and per-\nhaps even longevity.\nMontepare and Lachman (1989) explored self-percep-\ntions of age from adolescence to old age alongside life satis-\nfaction among individuals living in Boston (N = 187; 81\ncompleted a survey that related to how old they felt in terms\nof their looks, actions, behaviors, and current life satisfac-\ntion. Participants were also invited to answer questions about\ntheir fears, apprehensions about their own age, and the aging\nprocess. Results showed that younger (i.e., 20 years) partici-\npants had a more positive outlook on age as they embraced\nolder age identities. Middle-aged (40 years) and older\n(60 years) participants saw themselves younger than their\nactual age. Older participants not only rejected their own age\nidentities but viewed aging with reluctance by not positively\nwelcome aging. In terms of gender difference, older woman,\nalthough they reported younger age identities, reported less\nlife satisfaction. However, with older men, life satisfaction\nJ-F et al. 3\nwas independent of their age. Importantly, Montepare and\nLachman (1989) found that younger people not only enjoyed\ntheir actual age but also appeared to want to grow older and\nlooked forward to aging with greater optimism. Could these\nfindings be similar for pre-service teachers, where younger\npre-service teachers look forward to aging?\nAnother explanation as to why individuals want to remain\nyoung could be due to the prevailing societal stereotypes,\nviews, and attitudes that portray being young as more allur-\ning and desirable and equally that old age brings far more\ndifficulties and challenges to everyday life (Eibach et al.,\nby noting that the discrepancies between actual age, felt age,\nand ideal age are due to the regular \"exposure [of] elderly\n[on] television, television commercials, movies and print ads\n. . . [that] heighten. . . awareness of problems of aging, rang-\ning from cognitive difficulties to financial insecurity\"\n(p. 681). It also appears that popular media not only upholds\nnegative stereotypes about aging and enforces them as reali-\nties for everyone but also promotes adults to be younger\n(Holladay, 2002). In addition, although the media presents a\nfew positive messages of aging, the overall message is nega-\ntive: Older adults are perceived negatively and are more\nsalient within everyday media (Horton, Baker, Cote, &\nDeakin, 2008). Such views may be influenced by negative\nstereotypes and perceptions of older adults as less active, not\ncapable of everyday activities, and dependent on others\nScobee (2006) believed that misconceptions about the pro-\ncess of aging could be attributed to minimal social encoun-\nters across ages.\nNegative portrayal of older people is likely to lead to indi-\nviduals denying their actual age so that they are not labeled\ndependent and needful (Farney et al., 2006; Foos & Clark,\nmedia shapes and maintains our views, as well as cultivates\nour \"conceptions of what later life might hold for aging indi-\nviduals\" (p. 681). Thus, it is important to know whether and\nto what extent these stereotypes and/or popular media come\nto influence a person's perception of his or her own age,\nespecially among pre-service teachers, in an effort to find out\nto what extent they adhere to such stereotypes. One way to\naddress negative stereotypes in society is to expose individu-\nals to facts and real-life experiences about aging. Gorelik,\nDamron-Rodriguez, Funderburk, and Solomon (2000) stud-\nied undergraduates' (n = 189) interest in aging by comparing\nthem with a random comparison group (n = 261). All partici-\npants completed a survey on aging interest and found that\nregular contact with older adults and engaging in aging\ncourses positively influenced undergraduate students to view\naging more positively. Gorelik et al. argued that regular\nexposure to gerontology content and regular contact with the\nelderly were likely to influence students to view old age\npositively.\nSimilarly, Van Dussen and Weaver (2009) conducted a\nstudy using university students (n = 552) to understand stu-\ndent attitudes toward older people and gerontology educa-\ntion in general. They found that students with greater contact\nwith older adults had a more positive outlook on aging and\nthe elderly. Over the past few decades, much of the interest\nin aging studies has been influenced by knowledge around\naged care and support for the elderly (e.g., 65+), and little\nfocus has been given on how pre-service teachers view or\nperceive their own age and what meanings and values they\nattach to their own age. Several studies have been under-\ntaken in the area of gerontology, in terms of women studies\nand facial decoding of older people, but very few studies\nhave looked at how pre-service teachers, both male and\nfemale, perceive themselves in terms of their own age\nWhile a number of studies have focused on aging, no\nstudy has actually documented real-life accounts of pre-\nservice teachers around their views of aging. The reason for\nchoosing pre-service teachers was to not only capture their\nperceptions about aging but also because to date no study has\ndocumented their experiences and importantly it will assist\nin their overall assessment of their own aging process as they\nbegin to work school students. Based on the premise of \"at\nwhat age does the young, middle-aged, and the elderly feel\naimed to capture how pre-service teachers come to experi-\nence their own age and aging process\nMethod\nPre-service teachers at a university in Tasmania enrolled in a\nhuman development unit were invited to participate in the\nstudy. Although sampling occurred mainly on the basis of\nconvenience, care was taken to ensure that participation was\nvoluntary without any academic credit, incentives, or mone-\ntary reward. Furthermore, no identifiable information was\ncollected from participants. Information and consent for the\nstudy were presented to students online through the units\nonline home page using Blackboard.\nInstrument\nPre-service teachers were invited to complete a question-\nnaire constructed to capture perceptions of age adapted from\nthe work of Rubin and Berntsen (2006). This questionnaire\nhad eight questions: Three were demographic (e.g., age, gen-\nder, and ethnicity), three were forced responses related to\nperception of age (with a provision to make qualitative\ndescriptions for their response), and two were qualitative\nquestions directed at determining what factors influence\none's perception of one's own age. Furthermore, the ques-\ntionnaire was used to collect preliminary demographic infor-\nmation (age, gender, and ethnicity) and information relating\n4 SAGE Open\nto perceptions of age. Questions relating to age were pre-\nsented in multiple-choice format (e.g., Are you happy with\nyour age?--yes, no, or neither) with the provision of open-\nended responses to describe the reason for the participants'\nresponse/choice.\nParticipants\nAll participants (N = 331) were pre-service teachers enrolled\nin a first-year pre-requisite unit on human development at a\nuniversity in Tasmania. The majority of participants were\nfemale (76%), and the age range of participants was from 18\nmore than 50% of the participants below the age of 20.\nDesign\nThis study used a survey design. Overall, this activity took\napproximately 5 min for participants to complete. The sur-\nvey questionnaire was completed online through Blackboard\nas part of a weekly learning activity within the unit.\nMethod of Analysis\nGiven that the focus of the study was mainly qualitative, data\nanalysis aimed to explore and identify broad and unique\nthemes from within the data. Data from Blackboard were\nexported to an Excel spreadsheet, each row of the Excel\nspreadsheet clearly showing each participant's response,\nrespectively, against his or her demographic information\n(e.g., age, gender, etc.). The three forced responses related to\nperception of age were used to assess overall percentages of\nresponses in terms of yes or no, and quantitative data around\ndemographic details were presented through simple descrip-\ntive statistics. All qualitative descriptions were thematically\ncoded. In this, qualitative data were obtained by comparing\nall specific descriptions to develop a common theme, which\nwas directly validated by the participant's description.\nHence, qualitative analysis occurred on a thematic level to\nshow how participants perceived their own age.\nResults\nEach qualitative response in the \"Results\" section of this\narticle is followed by the age and gender of the participant;\nthis is shown in parentheses. Further qualitative responses\nare shown in line with main themes. Results are presented for\neach question asked.\nQ1. Are you happy with your current age? (Actual Age)\nA majority (83%) of the participants reported that they\nwere happy with their current age. Both younger (18-39) and\nolder (40+) participants reported that they were happy with\ntheir current age.\nYounger participants reported a greater sense of cheerful-\nness and independence entering their adulthood years; this is\nbest summed up by one participant reporting, \"I feel I have\nmany possibilities and opportunities awaiting my life\" (F19).\nAnother participant (F18) reported, \". . .I am young, healthy,\nand legal! . . .,\" and yet another (F18) reported, \"I am happy\nbecause as an 18 . . . you can do what you want.\" Another\nparticipant (M18) said, \"I'm enjoying the responsibilities\nand freedom associated with adulthood,\" indicating a sense\nof optimism and cheerfulness about his own age. Another\nmajor theme was optimism toward the future. This was best\nexpressed by a participant (M18) who described an eager-\nness toward future prospects:\nI am happy with my age because I have a whole future of\nprospects ahead of me such as completing university, getting\nmarried to my fianc\u00e9e, traveling, becoming a psychologist and\nhaving children. Although it is frightening to be growing up so\nquickly I have many things in my future to look forward to.\nIt also appears that this sense of optimism leading to a\nsense of identity was felt by another participant (F18) who\nstated, \"I am happy with my age as I feel I am at the age\nwhere I am respected as an adult but still can enjoy life as a\nkid sometimes.\"\nOlder participants reported a sense of contentment, free-\ndom, enjoyment, and accomplishment with their current age\nas one participant described, \"I am happy because I have\nsome freedom to do what I please, I am old enough to be\ntaken seriously and I still aspire to do many things before I\ndie\" (F56). Another participant reported,\nI am happy because this is where I am, I am starting a new part\nof my life and it is fun to experience what is happening in my\nlife now. I do not wish to be 18-25 because I have been there and\nit's not as much fun. It is a hard life struggling to keep a roof\nover your head and food on the table . . . life is good now and\nYet another participant reported, \"I have been able to\nenjoy lots of different experience . . .\" (M47). There was also\na great level of contentment in how participants came to see\ntheir own age; participants appeared not to count their age by\nyear but in how they came to accept themselves. One partici-\npant stated,\nI feel content within myself and comfortable within my own\nskin. I am learning new things with the added benefit of life\nexperience and hindsight. I have overcome conflicts from my\nyouth and am now free from the anxieties and unhappiness they\nused to cause me. I am very happy with the age I am at now and\nwould not wish to go back in time. (M43)\nQ2. Do you feel younger or older? (Felt Age)\nLess than half (41%) of the participants reported that they\nfelt neither older nor younger. More specifically, more than a\nJ-F et al. 5\nquarter (26%) of the participants reported feeling older, and\njust over one third (31%) reported feeling younger than their\nown age.\nYounger participants reported feeling young, and a small\npercent reported feeling older; such views seemed to be\nintrinsic for some and extrinsic for others with one partici-\npant reporting, \"I feel immature for my age [as in I am not]\nemotional wise, I feel childish and often stupid. I look physi-\ncally younger than my age too, and that doesn't help\" (F18).\nEqually, some participants claimed that they felt old and\nyoung at the same time with one participant (M19) reporting,\n\"I do not feel older or younger than my age.\" Another\nreported feeling both:\nI feel younger because a lot of people assume I am a lot younger,\nthus they treat me like a child. But I have recently felt older too,\nbecause of a fall-out with a friendship group made me realize\nhow immature they were and how I have different goals and\naspirations to them. I also feel older because I have had to move\nout of home to study this course and it has put more responsibility\non me. On the other hand, moving out of home has made me feel\nyounger too, because I find it very difficult to cope without my\nHowever, when participants had responsibilities such as\njobs and family commitments, and were involved in study,\nthey reported feeling older. One participant reported, \"I feel\na little older than my age because I am always so tired with\ndoing Uni full time and working two jobs along with teach-\ning a martial art. I am too busy feel about 30 years old\"\n(M20). Another reports, \"I feel around 30 I would say it is\nmost likely that this is because I have had a child and feel the\npressure and responsibility that usually comes with age\"\nOlder participants reported that they felt younger than\ntheir chronological age; they claimed to feel younger through\nrelationships or associations. One participant reported,\nMy children make me feel younger. I have a close relationship\nwith them both, very\nstrong bonds. I remain interested in their lives which keeps me\ninformed of the changes society is going through and how it\naffects them, not just me. My husband is 13 years older than me\n(l am 40, he is 53). He has always referred to me as his young\nwife, and after 17 years together, he must have conditioned me\nto believe this. I try to keep as healthy as I can, my mind as\nactive as I can, so I don't feel older than 40. I suppose some days\nI feel my age, but mostly I feel mid's. (F40)\nAnother participant reported, \"In many ways I still feel\nlike I did when I married (at 19yrs), or when my children\nwere young. I am still very much the same person, with a lot\nmore wisdom and life experience\" (F40). In other cases,\nalthough participants recognized biological aging, they still\nclaimed to be younger either in how they looked, acted, and\nbehaved or in how they perceived experiences. In relation to\nthis, one participant reported, \"I still feel the same as I did 20\nyears ago. My body would contradict that as I am not as fit or\nactive as I used to be\" (F50). Another participant reported,\nI act younger than my age. I refuse to conform to what a 42-year-\nold should wear for example. I am active and have a positive\noutlook on life, which makes me feel younger. My kids keep me\nQ3. Do you wish you were younger or older? (Ideal Age)\nMore than half of the participants (68%) reported wishing\nto be neither younger nor older. Around a quarter (25%) of\nthe participants reported wishing to be younger, while a\nsmall (5%) group reported wanting to be older.\nYounger participants (only a small group) reported they\nwere older in terms of responsibility due to wanting life sta-\nbility and maturity. One participant reported,\nthen I would no longer be in Uni and I would be old enough to\nget married and start having a family. I am very anxious about\nhow my life will turn out (e.g. who I will marry, where I will\nwork/live, etc.) so I would like to be a little bit older so that I can\nstart to think about these things. (F18)\nAnother reports, \"I wish I was 22 years of age, so as I am\nnot looked upon as young; according to my age rather than\nmy maturity\" (F19). However, a great majority of partici-\npants reported that they did not wish to be younger or older\nsuggesting that they were comfortable with their current age.\nOne participant reported, \"I do not wish that I were older or\nyounger than the age I am now\" (M19); another reported, \"I\nam very happy with the age I am at now!\" (F18). Yet another\nreported,\nI feel happy at my current age (18) as it is the first time in my life\nwhere I have gained a sense of independence and no one is\ndependent on me (i.e. I have no children to worry about, etc.). I\nam looked upon as young, which seems to have nothing but\npositive things associated with it, that is, don't have to worry\nabout the signs of aging. Therefore I am happy with my age.\nAnother participant reported,\nI am happy being 32. I do not wish to be younger again, as I\nLOVED my teenage/early 20s, but I have no desire to return to\nthem. I love being a Mum and concentrating on my family time.\nI also do not wish to be any older. (F32)\nOlder participants reported that they were younger and\ndenied their chronological age: \"I wish I was younger,\nalthough I don't look or feel 48, I am not comfortable being\nclose to 50\" (F48). Another participant reported, \"I feel\nyounger, because I don't look 50. I have a young son who\nkeeps me young\" (F50). Others wished they were younger\n6 SAGE Open\ndue to inherent physical benefits, and to this end, one partici-\npant reported, \"I'd like to be in my 30s with the physical\nenergy and looks I had then\" (F53). Another participant sim-\nply reported, \"younger to be more mobile and fit\" (F49). Yet\nanother reported, \"I'd like to be in my 30s with the physical\nenergy and looks I had then, but the knowledge about life\nthat I have now\" (F53). However, similar to younger partici-\npants, a majority of older participants also did not wish to be\neither younger or older suggesting perhaps that they were\ncomfortable with their age. One participant reported, \"I am\nhappy being the age I am now. I would not want to change it\"\n(F40). Another participant reported, \"I like my age and don't\nwish to be younger or older\" (F40).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nA novel aspect of the study is that the findings reported here\nare highly consistent with those reported by prior research-\ners, even with a unique pre-service teacher sample from\nTasmania, Australia. The findings of this study revealed that\nolder participants were positive about aging. Older partici-\npants seemed content with their age and seemed to be more\nemotionally positive about their aging while recognizing that\nthey were aging physically; to this end, older participants\nwere also quite comfortable with their actual age. One expla-\nnation for this could be due to the fact that they were at the\nuniversity as students interacting with younger students,\nwhich in turn could have possibly reinforced a sense of\nyouthfulness. Attaching positive meaning to aging could\nhave resulted in older participants feeling younger but not\nwishing to be younger (i.e., ideal), and this is in line with the\nfindings of Monk and Eibach (2011). This finding confirmed\nLanger's (2010) notion that how one perceives his or her age\ninfluences his or her quality of life and life satisfaction.\nUnlike the findings of Rubin and Berntsen (2006), the pres-\nent study found only a very small percentage (5%) of older\nstudents reporting that they felt younger, where they denied\ntheir chronological age. This is in line with Horton et al.\n(2008) who noted that older people saw themselves far more\npositively in terms of their own aging compared with nega-\ntive stereotypes and beliefs about age in society. Furthermore,\nit was likely that this group of individuals have conceptual-\nized aging in terms of their relationships, associations (e.g.,\nrelating to their own children and interacting with students at\nuniversity who are far younger than themselves), and activi-\nties they are involved in rather than in terms of their biologi-\ncal clock or chronologically.\nYounger participants seemed to be positive with all\naspects of their aging; this was in line with the findings of\nMontepare and Lachman (1989). Younger participants were\nmore excited coming to terms with their age and having free-\ndom as an adult. Also, given that younger students have\nbegun their first year at university, this may have further led\nthem to experience new found freedom, make new friends,\ngain independence, and in some cases, experience living\naway from home, and, therefore, all these collectives could\nhave led them to appreciate and anticipate several new expe-\nriences leading them to appreciate their actual age. Perhaps\nthese shared experiences appeared to be far more salient than\nother external influences such as media views or societal ste-\nOverall, the results of the current study found that younger\nstudents were more positive about their actual age than older\nstudents; younger students perceived their age more favor-\nably and with greater optimism than older students. Older\nparticipants were content and positive about their current\nage. These findings also underscore several important issues\nfor future research. First, it would be important to determine\nwhether the study's domains were restrictive or were robust\nacross diverse populations. Qualitative studies would allow\nmore careful exploration of the meaning of specific con-\nstructs across diverse groups. Second, research is needed to\ndetermine whether specific attributes of aging are missing.\nQuite possibly, there are other beliefs about aging that have\nnot been captured by the published literature. Finally, there is\na need for teacher educators to examine how they teach aging\nor life-span development in their courses.\nThis study provided new and important information about\naging in tertiary students. Using a survey based on the aging\nwork of Rubin and Berntsen (2006) and the published litera-\nture, the study showed that pre-service teachers' perceptions\nof aging did not differ from the published literature concern-\ning the \"main stream\" population. This indicated that those\nentering the teaching profession have attitudes and percep-\ntions relating to aging that are consistent with the general\npopulation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBarak, B., Mathur, A., Lee, K., & Zhang, Y.
