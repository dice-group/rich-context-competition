In the USA the most heavily\nadvertised brands are Marlboro, Newport,\nand Camel.1 2 Few analyses have delved into\nthe specific varieties popular among youth.\nDo ``Lights'' or ``Full Flavors'' predominate?\nTo answer this question, data on the cigarette\nbrand preferences of smokers in the 2002 US\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health\nwere analysed.\nUsing the on-line analysis feature of the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Data\nArchive,3 cigarette brand used in the last 30\ndays was cross tabulated with the type of\ncigarette (Full Flavor, Light, Ultra Light, self\nreported) used in the past 30 days. Separate\nanalyses were conducted on three age\nAnalyses accounted for survey design char-\nacteristics and percentages were weighted to\nthe US population.\nFigure 1 shows the top five varieties in\neach age group. Marlboro Lights were the\nmost popular brand style in all three age\ncategories. The popularity of Marlboro Full\nFlavor (FF) decreased with age, as did\nNewport FF. Marlboro Ultra-Light was not\nas popular with the youngest respondents.\nOverall, Marlboro brands held 50.6% of the\nyoungest smokers, 53.5% of the young adult\nsmokers, but only 37.8% of the older adult\nsmokers. The relationship of Newport use\nof 26+ year olds smoked Newports. Camel\nLights and Newport Lights varieties were\nmuch more popular among youths than\namong older smokers. Newport was the\ndominant brand among African American\nsmoke Newport Lights. By contrast, only\nsmoked Newport FF and 4.2% smoked\nNewport Lights. Doral Lights and Basic FF\nand Lights together accounted for 9% of the\nadult market, yet were practically non-exis-\ntent in the youth market (,1%).\nIt appears that Marlboro Light is the most\npopular brand style among younger smokers\nin the USA. Marlboro Full Flavor and\nNewport Full Flavor are quite popular, with\nCamel less so. Five of the top nine varieties in\nall three age categories are Lights or Ultra-\nLights, though the specific varieties varied by\nage. Discounted brands (Doral and Basic)\naccount for a sizable percentage of the adult\nmarket but a miniscule percentage of the\nyouth market. The youth market in the USA\nappears dominated by varieties of the major\nadvertised brands; other products make up a\nmore modest percentage of the market.\nConversely, the adult market is much more\ndiffuse, with the major varieties commanding\nsmaller overall percentages of the market.\nLight varieties appear to be popular choices\nfor younger smokers. Similar investigations\nin other countries could shed further light on\nyounger smokers' brand choices, particularly\nin those countries that have banned descrip-\ntors such as ``Light'' and ``Mild''.\nR J O'Connor\nDepartment of Health Behavior, Roswell Park Cancer\nInstitute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo NY 14203,\nUSA; richard.oconnor@roswellpark.org\nREFERENCES\n1 Kaufman NJ, Castrucci BC, Mowery P, et al.\nChanges in adolescent cigarette-brand\n2 Cummings KM, Hyland A, Pechacek TF, et al.\nComparison of recent trends in adolescent and\nadult cigarette smoking behaviour and brand\npreferences.

In the past, various issues have\nbeen raised in debates on this topic.1 2\nProponents cite evidence that increased taxes\ndeter young people from using tobacco3\u00ad5 and\nargue that additional revenues can be used to\nprovide health care services for children\nand to support smoking prevention pro-\ngrammes.6 7 Opponents argue that higher\ntobacco taxes place an unfair burden on\nsmokers in low income groups.8\u00ad10\nTo gain insight into how Texans view new\ncigarette taxes, data from a statewide tele-\nphone survey (random digit dialling of work-\ning residential numbers) of 6345 adults were\nanalysed. The survey was conducted between\nwere asked whether they support a $1 per\npack increase in cigarettes taxes. They were\nalso asked about the use of these taxes to\nprovide funds for children's health care and\nprogrammes to prevent tobacco use among\nyoung people. To learn how views differed\nbetween those who use tobacco and those\nwho do not, as well as between those in\ndifferent income groups, participants were\nalso asked about their own tobacco use and\ntheir household income.\nable for different analyses. Current smokers\nsmokers reported household incomes below\n65% favoured a $1 per pack increase in\ncigarette taxes. Support for the $1 per pack\nincrease grows when the taxes are to be used\npartly for preventing young people from\nsmoking (77%) or to help provide health\ninsurance for children in low income families\n(75%). Smokers and non-smokers differed\nnotably in their opinions, and there were also\nsignificant differences between income\ngroups, as shown in fig 1. Confidence\nintervals are \u00a12% or less except in the low\nincome group of smokers, where they are\napproximately \u00a15% because of the smaller\nsample size.\nAmong non-smokers, support for a $1 per\npack tax rises significantly when its proposed\nuses include smoking prevention and chil-\ndren's health insurance. When the use is not\nspecified, higher income non-smokers are\nmore likely to favour the tax than low income\nspecified use is smoking prevention, the level\nof support is 82% among non-smokers in\nboth income groups. However, when a\nspecified use is health insurance for children\nin low income families, support is weaker\namong higher income non-smokers than\namong low income non-smokers (77% v\nAmong smokers, support for the $1 tax was\ndramatically affected by its proposed use.\nWhen the use was not specified, support was\nincome groups. However, when smokers\nconsidered proposed uses for smoking pre-\nvention and children's health insurance,\nlevels of support among the higher and low\nincome groups, respectively, increased to 48%\nand 59% with prevention use and to 53% and\n67% with child health use. Interestingly,\nwhen the proposed uses were for prevention\nor health insurance for children in low\nincome families, support for a $1 tax was\nsignificantly greater among smokers in the\nlow income group than among those in the\nhigher income group (p , 0.01).\nFigure 1 Top five cigarette brands among 12\u00ad\nPercentages are weighted to the US national\npopulation.\nPostScript\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nLETTERS\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThis research was supported by a grant from\nthe National Cancer Institute (US-NIH).\nState funds were not used in the preparation\nof this report.

Responses to cigarette tax\nincreases by race/ethnicity, income and age\nWhat was ``light'' and ``mild'' is\nnow ``smooth'' and ``fine'': new\nlabelling of Australian cigarettes\nWe have just discovered (February 2005) a\nnew ``premium'' sideline of Australia's sec-\nond largest selling brand, Peter Jackson. The\nnew members of the Peter Jackson ``brand\nfamily'' come in black, grey, and white packs,\nrespectively, labelled ``full flavour'', ``smooth\nflavour'', and ``fine flavour''. We believe this\nis an industry response to a looming ban on\n``light'' and ``mild'' descriptors.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer\nCommission (ACCC) has investigated\nwhether ``light'' and ``mild'' descriptors\nbreach the Commonwealth Trade Practices\nAct. It has told Parliament that it believes the\nindustry has been involved in misleading and\ndeceptive conduct, and that it is negotiating a\nsettlement with the three manufacturers.\nWe know that large numbers of Australian\nsmokers continue to believe that ``light'' and\n``mild'' cigarettes provide relative health\nbenefits.1 Although product promotions are\nnow tightly restricted, Australian smokers\ncontinue to be lured with what is probably\nthe largest and most complex variety in the\nworld of ``milds'' (the term Australian man-\nufacturers prefer),2 3 all designed to create a\ncompelling illusion of reduced harm.4\nMajor Australian brand families typically\nhave six notional strength variants, based on\nCommonwealth labelling regulations: ``1 mg\nor less'', ``2 mg or less'', ``4 mg or less'',\nor less''. Government mandated information\non the side of each pack includes notional tar,\nnicotine, and carbon monoxide yields in\nthese six ``tar bands''. This is scheduled for\nreplacement by qualitative information in\nlabelling regulations come into force. The\nindustry also differentiates variants with\nvarious ``mild'' descriptors and/or more pro-\nminent use of the ``tar band'' figure. It is\nunclear whether the industry will be able to\nuse notional tar figures once ``light'' and\n``mild'' descriptors are prohibited.\nCurrent industry conduct demonstrates\nthat tar yields are very important to it. The\nmost recent Australian Retail Tobacconist has a\ncover advertisement for leading ``budget''\nbrand, Horizon, informing retailers:\nNow your Horizon customers can get\ntheir favourite brand in an exciting\nnew look pack. With new descriptors\nand clearer numbers all our packs\nare much easier to identify. Research\nproves that your customers will find\nthe new pack more appealing and a\nlot easier to recognize.5\nMoreover, a number of brands are labelled\nwith notional tar yields not listed in the\nlabelling regulations. For example, Marlboro\nLights and Winfield Special Mild 6 are both\nlabelled as ``6 mg or less''. Trade promotional\nmaterial for Winfield Special Mild 6 indicated\nthat the ``6 mg or less'' notional tar yield was\nintended to attract smokers of the ``8 mg or\nless'' variant of Winfield interested in switch-\ning to a lower yield brand.6\nThe new Peter Jackson Select Blend varieties\npush the envelope by combining innovative\nverbal descriptors with non-prescribed notional\ntar yields. ``Full flavour'' is labelled ``9 mg or\nless'', ``smooth flavour'' is labelled ``6 mg or\nless'', and ``fine flavour'' is labelled ``3 mg or\nless''. The backs of the packs describe the\nvarieties as respectively delivering a ``rich, full-\nflavoured smoking experience'', ``an extra\nsmooth smoking experience'', and ``a more\nrefined smoking experience''. This language\ndoes not suggest gradation in risk as clearly as\n``mild'',``extramild'',and``ultramild'',butlink-\ning these terms and visual imagery suggesting\ndifferential experience to tar yields will build\nbelief that ``smooth'' and ``fine'' mean ``safer''.\nIf the industry can make ``smooth'' and\n``fine'' effective replacements for ``light'' and\n``mild'', we will lose some of the potential\npublic health benefit from prohibiting the\nlatter descriptors and removing ISO tar\nyields. There is a strong need for improved\nmonitoring of industry responses to efforts to\nend the ``lights'' and ``milds'' deception, as\nwell as for increased political will to prevent\n$1 tax for smoking prevention\n$1 tax for child health\nNon-smokers\nSmokers\nNon-smokers\nSmokers\n%\n%\nFigure 1 Support for cigarette tax increase according to proposed use, smoking status, and\nhousehold income.\nEthics approval: Ethics approval for this study was\nreceived from the University of Texas Health Science\nCenter at Houston Institutional Review Board.\ne\no\nd\nCompeting interests: The authors have no competing\ninterests.\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nresponses which amount to continuing the\ndeception by new means.\nB King, R Borland\nVicHealth Centre for Tobacco Control, The Cancer\nCouncil Victoria, Australia\nCorrespondence to: Bill King; bill.king@cancervic.\norg.au\nREFERENCES\n1 Borland R, Yong H-H, King B, et al.

The\nBanning smoking in public places\nThis book is simultaneously depressing and\nreassuring for people involved in the battle to\nremove environmental tobacco smoke from\npublic places. The tactics used to oppose a\nbylaw requiring all public places, including\nbars, to be smoke-free in Greater Victoria in\nCanada in the late 1990s are depressingly\nfamiliar to those currently fighting for\nsmoke-free bars in Australia. On the other\nhand, it is reassuring that the opposition does\nnot seem to have developed any new strate-\ngies, their moves becoming increasingly\npredictable.\nFor that reason, this is an excellent tool for\npeople trying to bring about tobacco control\nthrough legislation and public policy and will\nprovide a good insight for people working in\nother areas of public health. While the\nplayers in this story are very specific to\nGreater Victoria, Canada, the logistics of the\ncampaign strategy are almost universally\napplicable. The tactics used to oppose tobacco\ncontrol are global and the lessons learned\nfrom this campaign are worth sharing with\nthe international tobacco control community.\nSmoke-free has been written by a journalist,\nBarbara McLintock, so it is a comfortable,\neasy to read story. Those who want more\nacademic details of the campaign, with\nstatistics, evaluation, and analysis, can find\nthat in journal articles published elsewhere.\nThe value of this book is the insight into the\npower struggles and spheres of influence\nwhich are the hidden drivers of legislative\nchange.\nIt also puts a human face on the battle and\nreinforces the need to support staff given the\nunenviable job of enforcing tobacco control\npolicies among people who do not want\nthem. I have to admit that I found the\ndescription of the aggressive hostility against\nthe Capital Health Region staff, orchestrated\nby some of the bar owners, confronting and\nwondered what provision has been made in\nAustralia to deal with the possibility of such\ntactics.\nBut it is those details which make the book\na very powerful blueprint for what is needed\nto bring about effective policy change. The\ngrowing acceptance of anti-smoking strate-\ngies by the general community has not\nremoved all the heat from the issue and the\nbattle does not end with the passing of\nlegislation. The need for strong leadership\nand a commitment to resources to enforce\nthe legislation once it is in place may well\ncontinue for a number of years.\nW Oakes\nThe Cancer Council NSW, Australia;\nwendyo@nswcc.org.au\nSmoke-free: how one city\nsuccessfully banned smoking in all\nindoor public places\nEdited by Barbara McLintock.
