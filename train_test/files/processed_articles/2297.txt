    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Because of the magnitude of the global tobacco epidemic, the World Health Organisation developed\nthe Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), an international legally binding treaty to control tobacco\nuse. Adoption and implementation of specific tobacco control measures within FCTC is an outcome of a political\nprocess, where social norms and public opinion play important roles. The objective of our study was to examine\nhow a country's level of tobacco control is associated with smoking prevalence, two markers of denormalisation of\nsmoking (social disapproval of smoking and concern about passive smoking), and societal support for tobacco control.\nMethods: An ecological study was conducted, using data from two sources. The first source was the Tobacco Control\nScale (TCS) from 2011, which quantifies the implementation of tobacco control policies in European Union (EU)\ncountries. Data on smoking prevalence, societal disapproval of smoking, concern about passive smoking, and societal\nsupport for policy measures were taken from the Eurobarometer survey of 2009. Data from Eurobarometer surveys\nwere aggregated to country level. Data from the 27 European Union member states were used.\nResults: Smoking prevalence rates in 2009 were negatively associated with a country's TCS 2011 score, although not\nstatistically significant (r = -.25; p = .21). Experience of societal disapproval was positively associated with higher TCS\nscores, though not significantly (r = .14; p = .48). The same was true for societal support for tobacco control (r = .27;\np = .18). The TCS score in 2011 was significantly correlated with concern about passive smoking (r = .42; p =.03).\nSupport for tobacco control measures was also strongly correlated with concern about passive smoking (r = .52, p = .006).\nConclusions: Smokers in countries with a higher TCS score were more concerned about whether their smoke harms\nothers. Further, support for tobacco control measures is higher in countries that have more of these concerned smokers.\nConcerns about passive smoking seem central in the implementation of tobacco control measures, stressing the\nimportance of continuing to educate the public about the harm from passive smoking.\n",

Rates of smoking have levelled\noff or declined in the developed world, while they are\nincreasing in the developing world [2]. Because of the\nmagnitude of the tobacco epidemic, the WHO developed\nthe first legally binding international treaty on public\nhealth, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n(FCTC) [3]. When this treaty went into force in February\n2005, governments throughout the world committed to\nimplement a minimum set of tobacco control measures,\nbut were also expected to go beyond that, following add-\nitional FCTC Guidelines. Governments now have a wide\nrange of interventions at their disposal to reduce tobacco\nuse, such as adopting high cigarette taxes, banning\ntobacco advertising and promotion, creating smoke-free\npublic places and worksites, introducing health warnings\non cigarette packs, and implementing mass media cam-\npaigns to educate about the harm from tobacco. How-\never, more than five years after FCTC came into effect,\n* Correspondence: mc.willemsen@stivoro.nl\n1STIVORO, Dutch Expert Centre on Tobacco Control, The Hague, The\nNetherlands\n2CAPHRI, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Willemsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

There also is a grow-\ning body of literature, predominantly from political\nsciences, examining how these tobacco control interven-\ntions come about in diverse social and political contexts.\nAdoption and implementation of specific tobacco con-\ntrol interventions is thought to be primarily the outcome\nof a political process [9-11], where social norms and\npublic opinion may play an important role. Jacobson and\nZapawa argue that changes towards more restrictive\ncivil norms regarding smoking facilitate the enactment\nof legislation, while laws institutionalize nascent civil\nnorms and contribute to a social climate that dis-\ncourages smoking [12]. Kagan and Nelson, in a discus-\nsion of the politics of tobacco regulation in the United\nStates, conclude that, on balance, US tobacco policy\nreflects shifts in public opinion [13]. A central factor in\nexplaining both the effect of policies on smoking and\nexplaining how these policies originate in society is the\nconcept of denormalisation. Chapman recently argued\nthat \"there is a dynamic, synergistic relationship be-\ntween formal tobacco control interventions and policies,\nfalling smoking prevalence and the increasing range and\ngrowth of markers [of denormalisation of tobacco]\" [14].\nAn important aspect besides denormalisation is level\nof support for policies in the general population. Support\nfor smoke-free legislation is an important determinant of\ncompliance with the legislation [15,16]. Studies found\nthat support for tobacco policies, particularly smoke-\nfree legislation, further increases after implementation\n[16,17]. However, few studies looked at the association\nbetween level of societal support for tobacco control\nand countries' tobacco control policy level.\nThe objective of our study was to examine how a\ncountry's level of tobacco control is associated with mar-\nkers of denormalisation of smoking, smoking prevalence,\nand societal support for tobacco control. We conducted\nan ecological study, using country as the unit of analysis.\nThe European Union provides a good setting for such a\nstudy, because tobacco control implementation data are\navailable from the Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) [18],\nwhile Eurobarometer surveys [19] provide data on\ndenormalisation, smoking prevalence, and support for\ntobacco control. A recent study reported on the associ-\neter data on smoking prevalence, self-reported exposure\nto passive smoking, and support for smoking bans [20].\nThey found that TCS scores were negatively (although\nnot statistically significant) associated with smoking\nprevalence and positively (and significantly) associated\nwith public support for smoking bans in workplaces.\nHowever, they did not examine support for other policies\nnor markers of denormalisation. We investigated the\nassociations between the more recent 2011 TCS score\nwith Eurobarometer data on societal support for tobacco\ncontrol measures, smoking prevalence, and markers of\ndenormalisation of smoking.\nMethods\nThe TCS is based on the six most effective and import-\nant tobacco control policies according to the World\nBank [18]. A questionnaire was sent to correspondents\nin all European countries, using a scoring system [18].\nThis scoring system was developed by a panel of experts\nwho agreed on the allocation of points to the scale and\ndecided on what weight should be given to policies in\nthe scale, reflecting the relative effectiveness of each\npolicy. The maximum score is 100, with subscales for\nprice (maximum 30 points), public place bans (max-\nimum 22 points), public information campaign spending\n(maximum 15 points), advertising bans (maximum 13\npoints), health warnings (maximum 10 points), and\ntreatment (10 maximum points). For the present study,\nthe total score was used. Data were taken from the\nSmoking prevalence data were from the Special\nEurobarometer 332, which had fieldwork data conducted\nically conducted by the Gallup Organisation in the\n27 countries of the EU, for the European Commission.\nThe Eurobarometer uses a multi-stage random sample\ndesign. In each country, a number of sampling points\nwas drawn with probability proportional to population\nsize and population density. In each of the selected\nsampling points, a starting address was randomly\ndrawn. Further addresses were selected by standard ran-\ndom route procedures, from the initial address. In each\nhousehold, the respondent was randomly drawn, follow-\ning the closest birthday rule. Samples sizes varied\nall those aged 15 years and older. Interviews are con-\nducted via face-to-face in people's homes. For all coun-\ntries, a national weighting procedure was carried that\ntook into account country distributions with respect to\ngender, age, region and size of locality.\nSmoking prevalence was measured in respondents\naged 15 years and older with the following question:\n\"Regarding smoking cigarettes, cigars or a pipe, which of\nthe following applies to you?\". Respondents with an\naffirmative answer to the option \". . .you smoke at the\npresent time\" were regarded to be a smoker.\nThe Special Eurobarometer 332 includes two items\nthat can be regarded as markers of tobacco denormalisa-\ntion. The first is Societal disapproval of smoking, which\nis measured with the question: \"Has any of the following\nthings led you to think about quitting in the last 12\nmonths . . .. The society disapproves of smoking?\" (Yes,\nNo). This item was also used in other studies as an indi-\ncator of the social denormalisation of smoking [22-24].\nThe other item is Concern about passive smoking,\nmeasured with the question \"Has any of the following\nthings led you to think about quitting in the last\n12 months . . .Concern about the effect of your smoke\non non-smokers?\" (Yes / No). Both items were mea-\nsured among smokers who made a quit attempt in the\nData on societal support for policy measures were\nobtained from the Eurobarometer with four questions:\n\"Would you be in favour of or opposed to any of the fol-\nlowing measures?\" (1) Banning display and advertising of\ntobacco products in points of sales / shops; (2) Banning\nthe sales of tobacco products via the Internet; (3) Putting\npicture health warnings on all packages of tobacco pro-\nducts; (4) Increasing taxes on tobacco products. Answer-\ning categories on these four questions were: \"In favour\"\nand \"Opposed\". A scale was formed with a Cronbach's\nAlpha of 0.77. These questions were answered by all\nrespondents.\nThe Central Committee on Research Involving Human\nSubjects in the Netherlands requires no ethical approval\nfor non-medical survey research.\nAnalyses\nThe relationships between TCS scores, smoking preva-\nlence, the two markers of tobacco denormalisation,\nand societal support were first examined by means of\nPearson's correlation coefficient and scatter-plots. Next,\nmultiple regression analyses were conduced to examine\npredictors of TCS 2011 score and predictors of support\nfor tobacco control. We checked for multicollinearity by\nexamining variance inflation factors. For all analyses,\nSPSS statistical package version 19 was used.\nResults\nSmoking prevalence varied between 16% (Sweden) and\napproval as a reason for quitting varied between 10%\n(France, Slovenia) and 42% (Slovakia), with mean 21.3%\n(Sd 8.4). Concern about passive smoking as a reason to\nquit varied between 12% (Sweden) and 55% (Ireland),\ncontrol policies was lowest in Austria (51) and highest in\nThe correlations between the study variables are pre-\nsented in Table 1. Smoking prevalence rates in 2009\nwere negatively associated with a country's Tobacco\nControl Scale score in 2011, although not statistically\nsignificantly correlated with concern about passive\nsmoking (r = .42; p = .03), meaning that smokers who said\nthat they quit smoking due to concerns about how\ntheir smoke affects others, were more likely to live in a\ncountry with a more advanced 2011 TCS score. This\nassociation is graphically illustrated in Figure 1. This\nassociation remained borderline significant in a regression\ntrolling for social disapproval, societal support, and smok-\ning prevalence (Table 2). Inspection of the scatterplot\n(Figure 1) reveals that two countries have a strong\ninfluence on the total distribution. These are the UK and\nIreland, both having a high TCS score and a high propor-\ntion of smokers saying that they have quit because of con-\ncern about passive smoking. The association is no longer\nsignificant without these two countries.\nThe data presented in Table 1 further reveal that\nexperience of societal disapproval was positively asso-\nciated with higher TCS scores, but the correlation was\nnot significant (r = .14; p = .48). The same was true for\nsocietal support for tobacco control (r = .27; p = .18).\nSupport for tobacco control measures was strongly cor-\nrelated with concern about passive smoking (r = .52,\np = .006). This remained significant after controlling for\nproportion of smokers and social disapproval of smok-\ning in a regression analysis (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nA previous ecological study found that EU countries\nwith a higher overall TCS score have higher public sup-\nport for smoke-free legislation (smoking bans) [20]. Our\nstudy adds to this with two important findings. First,\nsmokers in EU countries with higher TCS scores are\nmore concerned about the effect of their smoke on\nTable 1 Correlation matrix (Pearson Correlation Coefficients with 2-tailed p values; N=27)\nMeasure % Smokers in 2009 TCS 2011 Societal Disapproval Concern Passive Smoking Societal Support for TC\nTC = Tobacco Control; TCS = Tobacco Control Scale.\nothers, which can be regarded as a marker of tobacco\ndenormalisation. Second, support for tobacco control\nmeasures is higher in countries that have more of these\nconcerned smokers. Together, these findings support the\nidea that the issue of passive smoking is central to\ntobacco control in Europe. Our data also suggest that\nthere are still large differences within Europe. The fact\nthat the association between TCS score and concern\nabout passive smoking depends heavily on two countries\n(the UK and Ireland) which both have a very high TCS\nscore, suggests that these two countries have been much\nmore successful in advancing the implementation of the\nFCTC measures alongside denormalizing tobacco use,\nthan the rest of Europe.\nDespite the paucity of ecological data in the scien-\ntific literature, the importance of level of concern\nabout passive smoking was already acknowledged dec-\nades ago by the tobacco industry. They initiated social\naccommodation programs and started covert attempts\nto deceive the public about the health risks from expos-\nure to tobacco smoke [25], creating controversy about\nresearch firm drafted a report, commissioned by Philip\nMorris, describing and comparing ecological data which\nthey had collected on attitudes towards smoking in a\nlarge number of countries across the world [27]. They\nlooked at the relationship between concern about pas-\nsive smoking and the desire for further restrictions on\nsmoking, finding a strong correlation between the two\nfactors. The authors commented that \"this is much\nstronger than any other driving factor such as social\nacceptability or disliking the smell\". The industry used\nthese data to tailor their efforts to normalize smoking\non a country-to-country basis.\nAlthough the two markers of denormalisation were\nstrongly correlated (r = .47; p = .01), they were not\nequally strongly associated with the TCS score. The item\nFigure 1 Scatter plot of the association between the total TCS score of 2011 and concern about passive smoking is the reason for\nquitting.\nTable 2 Results of multiple linear regression analysis\nPredictors Standardized Beta P VIF\nVIF = variance inflation factor.\nTable 3 Results of multiple linear regression analysis\npredicting societal support for tobacco control\nPredictors Standardized Beta p VIF\nVIF = variance inflation factor.\n`concern about passive smoking' showed a high correl-\nation (r = .42; p = .03), but the item measuring `social\ndisapproval of smoking' was only moderately and not\nsignificantly associated with TCS scores (r = .14; ns).\nThis suggests that more elaborate measures of tobacco\nde-normalization are needed. We therefore recommend\ndeveloping and including well validated, comprehensive\nmeasures of tobacco de-normalization in future popula-\ntion surveys.\nWe found a negative association between a country's\nTCS score and the proportion of smokers (r = -.25),\nalbeit not statistically significant (p = .21). This com-\npares well to the results from a previous ecological study\nusing the same number of 27 countries, but comparing\nfound a correlation of -.32 (p = .11) between TCS score\nand proportion of daily smokers [20]. Both studies prob-\nably suffer from the small sample size (N = 27). Another\nfactor obscuring any true association between the two\nvariables might be the low reliability of Eurobarometer\nsurveys. A recent study comparing smoking prevalence\nproportions from the Eurobarometer 2006 with data\nfrom national bureaux of statistics of the 27 EU coun-\ntries, found large discrepancies, probably due to the\ninadequate sample sizes in Eurobarometer surveys which\nhamper an accurate estimation of the proportion of\nThe study has some limitations. Although the\ntobacco control score was measured two years after the\nEurobarometer scores, it seems not justified to infer\nstrong causality from our ecological data. Although this\nseems less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility that\nadoption of more stringent tobacco control policies leads\nto people becoming more aware and concerned about\nthe harmfulness of smoking. Longitudinal data with rep-\nresentative samples of the population are needed to\nreally disentangle direction of causality and such studies\nare very much needed. Nevertheless, the fact that the\nEurobarometer data preceded the tobacco control score\nprovides some reassurance that concern about passive\nsmoking does indeed drive the implementation of more\nstringent tobacco control measures. Finally, we cannot\nrule out the possibility that the association between TCS\nscore and level of concern about passive smoking\nreflects common underlying factors which have not been\ncontrolled for, such as political and cultural differences.\nConclusion\nWe used ecological data to examine tobacco denormali-\nsation, an important emerging topic in the field of\ntobacco control. Our assumption was that countries that\nhave higher levels of tobacco denormalisation would\nhave more advanced tobacco control policies. Our find-\nings suggest that this might be true for one marker of\ndenormalisation, i.e. level of concern about the harm\nfrom passive smoking. This also suggests that it remains\nvital to educate the public about the harm from passive\nsmoking. Even in some developed countries, the aware-\nness of the risks from passive smoking can still be\nalarmingly low. For example, a recent study found that\nin the Netherlands only 61% of smokers agree that\ncigarette smoke is dangerous to non-smokers, whereas\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMW conceived and designed the study, coordinated and carried out\nstatistical analyses and drafted the manuscript.
