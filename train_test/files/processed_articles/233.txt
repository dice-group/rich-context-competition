Patterns of sexual partner\nchoice influence the transmission of infections in this\npopulation.\nGoal: To examine patterns of sexual mixing, bridging, and\nconcurrency in American adolescents and the association of\nthese characteristics with condom use.\nStudy Design: This project used the AddHEALTH survey\ndata. The survey selected a sample of schools, then conducted\nwave of data collection was conducted 2 years later. The data\non sexual relationships collected in the study were analyzed.\nResults: Respondents ranged in age from 13 to 17 years. Sex\npartnerships with persons of differing age groups were very\ncommon in this population (45% of sexual partnerships). Re-\nlationships with persons of different ethnicity were more com-\nmon among Latinos (42%) than among white (14%) and black\n(15%) respondents. A large proportion of the sample reported\nmore than two partners (56%). Among these persons, a large\nproportion reported partners in two different age groups\n(69%) and ethnic groups (35%) as well as concurrent partners\n(54%). Condom use was lower among persons with partners in\ndifferent age groups and among persons with a larger number\nof partners.\nConclusions: The large number of adolescents who have\nsexual relationships with persons of different characteristics\ncreates bridges for infections between different groups. Coun-\nseling of sexually active adolescents should include discussion\non issues of power and communication in these relationships.\nstrated the importance of sexual mixing patterns in a pop-\nulation for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases\n(STDs). Sexual networks form the pathways across which\nthese infections are transmitted from one person to another.\nUnlike casual contact, sexual partnering is nonrandom and\nhas major consequences for the rate and extent to which an\ninfection can spread.1\u00ad4 Strong assortive mating can lead to\nmultiple, decoupled epidemics in a population,5,6 whereas\nrandom mating tends to generate slower but larger epidem-\nics in the long run.7,8\nHallinan and Williams9 discussed five factors identified\nin the social psychology literature that act as bases of\ninterpersonal attraction: propinquity, similarity, comple-\nmentarity, status, and reciprocity. Propinquity and similarity\nare believed to have the greatest impact on friendship for-\nmation. Individuals are more likely to establish ties with\nthose with whom they have more opportunities to interact.\nFurthermore, given propinquity, individuals are more likely\nto form relationships with those similar to themselves in\nattitudes, values, and behavior. Hence, because ethnic\ngroups are segregated residentially, and because shared\ncultural values exist within ethnic groups, individuals may\nbe more likely to have relationships with members of their\nown race or ethnic groups. Relationships with individuals\nwho have like characteristics can be designated as assorta-\ntive (like with like), and relationships with those who have\ndifferent ethnicity as disassortative.\nThis research is based on data from the ADD Health Project, a program\nproject designed by J. Richard Udry (PI) and Peter Bearman, and funded by\nHuman Development to the Carolina Population Center; University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill; with cooperative funding participation by\nthe National Cancer Institute; the National Institute of Alcohol Use and\nAlcoholism; the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication\nDisorders; the National Institute on Drug Abuse; the National Institute of\nGeneral Medical Sciences; the National Institute of Mental Health; the\nNational Institute of Nursing Research; the Office of AIDS Research, NIH;\nthe Office of Behavior and Social Science Research, NIH; the Office of the\nDirector, NIH; the Office of Research on Women's Health, NIH; the Office\nof Population Affairs, DHHS; the National Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, DHHS; the Office of Minority\nHealth, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DHHS; the Office of\nMinority Health, Office of Public Health and Science, DHHS; the Office of\nthe Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, DHHS; and the\nNational Science Foundation.

The practice of younger women having sex with\nolder men assisted in the transmission of HIV infection to\nyounger cohorts in Africa,10 and the practice of older men\nhaving sex with younger men facilitated the spread of HIV\ninfection among gay men in the United States.11,12 Further-\nmore, in a study on the sexual networks of American adults,\nit was noted that the higher infection rates for bacterial\nSTDs among blacks can be explained by patterns of sexual\nnetworks within and between different racial/ethnic\nSex partnerships that overlap in time, or concurrent part-\nnerships, also have been identified as explanations for dif-\nferences in disease prevalence among different popula-\ntions.14\u00ad17 Concurrent partnerships increase the opportunity\nfor an infection to spread quickly in a network of sexual\npartners by allowing infections during a given period to be\ntransmitted to and from each partner who participates in the\nnetwork. Concurrency in sexual networks has been identi-\nfied as a factor associated with the spread of HIV infection\nin Uganda,15 and with the risk of chlamydia infection in a\ncommunity study in Colorado.17\nDifferences the characteristics of partners, particularly\ndifferences in partner age, may have an effect on sexual\nbehavior and the use of condoms. Only a small number of\nanalyses have considered the effects of partner characteris-\ntics on condom use and the use of contraceptives. Differ-\nences in age or other characteristics of partners may reflect\ndifferences in the power to make decisions in a relationship,\nand these differences in power may affect the degree to\nwhich condoms or other contraceptive methods are used.\nFor example, in a study on the degree of control that young\nwomen have over their first intercourse, Abma et al18,19\nfound that women whose first sexual partners were signif-\nicantly older than themselves were more likely to report that\nthe intercourse was involuntary. These women also were\nless likely to report that contraceptives were used.\nAmerican adolescents experience high rates of STD in-\nfection.20 As compared with older adults, adolescents (10-\nat higher risk for acquiring STDs because they may be more\nlikely to have multiple partners, to engage in unprotected\nintercourse, and to select higher risk partners. In addition,\nadolescent women may have an increased risk of infection\nwith Chlamydia trachomatis because of cervical\nAlthough a large literature exists on adolescent sexual\nbehavior in the United States, relatively little information is\navailable on the sexual mixing patterns of adolescents. The\nobjectives of this report are to describe the mixing patterns\nof American adolescents by age and ethnicity, to describe\nthe patterns of bridging partners and concurrency by age\nand ethnicity, and to examine the association of bridging\nand concurrency in this population with condom use.\nMethods\nData for this study was drawn from the National Longi-\ntudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). The Ad-\ndHealth data were designed to assess the health status of\nadolescents, and to explore the causes of their health-related\nbehaviors, focusing on the effects of multiple contexts or\nenvironments (both social and physical) in which they\nlive.25 A sample of schools was selected by Quality Edu-\ncation Data, Inc. The sample of schools was stratified by\nregion, urbanicity (urban, suburban, or rural), school type\n(public, private, or parochial), ethnic mix, and size. Conse-\nquently, 80 schools were selected by probability propor-\ntional to size. More than 70% of the originally sampled high\nschools participated in the study. If a school refused to\nparticipate, a replacement school was selected from the\nsame stratum.\nParticipating schools provided a roster of students for use\nin the project. In most cases, schools also agreed to admin-\nister the in-school questionnaire to each student during one\nclass period. The in-school sample was completed by\nOnce a high school was selected, a feeder school (one that\nincluded seventh grade students and sent its graduates to\nthat high school) was recruited. A feeder school then was\nselected in each of 80 communities.\nNext, a sample of students on school rosters was selected\nto participate in an in-home interview. Students were\ngrouped into 12 grade and gender strata within a school, and\nan average of 17 students were selected randomly from each\nwithin-school strata. This method yielded approximately\nschools. In 16 small schools, all the students were selected\nfor in-home interviews.\nRespondents selected through this two-stage sampling\nprocedure constituted a nationally representative sample of\nadolescents. Additional students were chosen to represent a\nnumber of ethnic groups and disabled students, and to create\ngenetic samples of related individuals. Only students se-\nlected from the nationally representative sample were in-\ncluded in this study. This nationally representative sample\nprovided data on 18,924 respondents interviewed in their\nhomes in wave 1.\nrespondents were interviewed in their homes. Data from\nboth the Wave 1 and the Wave 2 interviews are included in\nthis report.\nThis analysis focuses on the sexually active portion of the\nsample. During the in-home interview, information on sex-\nual activity was obtained through two different sequences of\nquestions. Respondents were asked a direct question on\nwhether they ever had sexual intercourse. In wave 1, of the\nported that they had sexual intercourse. Merging the two\nwaves of data, 9303 respondents distinctly reported ever\nhaving sexual intercourse.\nThe unit of analysis in this report consists of both indi-\nvidual records and sexual relationships. For the analysis\nrelated to sexual partners, the respondent level data file had\nto be converted from one with a record for each individual\nto a file with a record for each sexual partner. The 9,303\nindividuals who answered the direct question affirmatively\nIn each of the two waves, the respondents were asked to\nreport on relationships in the preceding 18 months. Some\ntelescoping might have occurred, such that respondents\nreported relationships in wave 2 that began more than 18\nmonths before. Relationships reported by the same respon-\ndent in waves 1 and 2 were compared on five variables\nincluding demographic and relationship variables. This pro-\ncedure identified 724 relationships (2.7% of the sample\nrelationships) that likely were duplicates. These relationship\nrecords were deleted from the relationship data set. Finally,\nrelationships for which the respondent did not report sexual\nintercourse with that partner were deleted from the file.\nExamination of the data on partners also showed that\nsome individuals who answered the direct question by say-\ning they never had sexual intercourse later reported inter-\ncourse when asked about specific partners. From these\ncases, 363 additional relationships were added to the rela-\ntionship file. Only 20 of the reported relationships were\nhomosexual. These were deleted from the file. The total\nnumber of heterosexual relationships used in the analysis\nIn the 16 schools wherein all the respondents were eligi-\nble for the in-home interview, a large number of relation-\nships (but not all) were reported by both partners, causing\nthose relationships to be overrepresented in the analysis.\nTabulations provided by the AddHealth staff at the Univer-\nsity of North Carolina on the frequency of relationships\nreported by both partners allowed adjustments to the sam-\npling weights that compensated for the overrepresentation\nof these relationships.\nStatistical Methods\nCross-tabulations were developed to examine respondent\nand partner agreement on variables such as age and ethnic-\nity. To test the significance of differences between distribu-\ntions, 2 statistics were used. The SUDAAN statistical\npackage was used to estimate standard errors of percent-\nages, taking the clustered design into account.26\nTo examine the association between individual charac-\nteristics and condom use, a logistic regression analysis was\nused. The SUDAAN statistical package was used to gener-\nate logistic models using sampling clusters to group obser-\nvations.23 The results are reported as important if the P\nvalues of a test statistic were smaller than 0.05.\nADDHealth data includes weights designed to compen-\nsate for unequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse.\nEach relationship was assigned the corresponding wave 1 or\n2 weight for the respondent. Weights were used in all\nanalyses to provide national estimates of relationship char-\nacteristics for adolescents.\nMeasures\nAge. The data on age were coded in single years for both\nrespondent and sexual partner. Differences between ages of\nthe partners were coded as more than 2 years older, within\n2 years, and more than 2 years younger.\nEthnicity. The data on respondent and partner ethnicity were\ncoded as white, black, Latino, or other. These data were collected\nby the respondent's report of his or her most important ethnicity.\nPatterns of mixed ethnicity were not analyzed because only 2.7%\nof the respondents reported a second ethnicity.\nCondom use. Condom use refers to whether the respon-\ndent ever reported using condoms with sexual partners.\nGender. Gender refers to the reported gender of the\nrespondent.\nConcurrency. Concurrency was determined by examin-\ning the dates for the first and last times the respondents had\nTABLE 1.

Persons with concurrent relation-\nships had overlapping dates.\nBridge age. A respondent was classified as a bridge\nperson for age if he or she had partners in more than one age\ngroup. Age groups were classified as more than 2 years\nyounger than the respondent, within 2 years of the respon-\ndent's age, or more than 2 years older than the respondent.\nBridge race. Bridge race was defined as a respondent\nwith a partner in more than one ethnic group.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the\nrespondents in the study who reported sexual relationships.\nage 17 years or older. More than half of the sample (62%)\nwere of other races.\nPartner Choice\nTable 2 shows descriptive data on relationship partners\nby age, gender, and ethnicity. In the total sample, 78% of\nthe partnerships were with someone of the same ethnicity,\nand 22% were with someone of a different ethnicity. Age\ndifferences between partners were common in the sample.\nApproximately 55% of the relationships included a partner\nwithin 2 years of age. However, older partners were re-\nported in nearly one third of the relationships, and younger\npartners in the remainder (12.6%).\nThe age of the respondent was associated with several of\nthe partner characteristic variables. The older respondents\nwere somewhat more likely to have a partner of the same\nethnicity (80%) than the youngest respondents (74%). The age\nof the respondent also was related to age differences between\npartners. The youngest respondents (age 14 years or younger)\nwere more likely to have partners two or more years older\n(41%), and few partners two or more years younger (3%). The\noldest age group (age 17 years or more) had a substantially\nlarger proportion of partners who were two or more years older\n(28%) and two or more years younger (17%).\nGender was not associated significantly with ethnicity of\npartner. However, the girls were more likely than the boys\nto have partners two or more years older (49% of the girls\nversus 14% of the boys), whereas the boys were more likely\nto have partners two or more years younger (22% of the\nboys versus 4% of the girls).\nEthnicity was related to several characteristics of partner\nchoice. Both white and black respondents had a low per-\ncentage of partners of other races (13% of the whites versus\n15% of the blacks), whereas Latinos and others had a higher\npercentage (42% and 77%). The age of the partner did not\ndiffer among ethnic groups.\nMultiple Partners\nTable 3 shows the proportion of respondents who re-\nported more than one partner. Approximately 44% of the\nTABLE 2.

Among all the respondents, the girls re-\nported concurrent partnerships more often than boys (58%\nof the girls versus 50% of the boys, P  0.05). This\ndifference was found in all the ethnic groups.\nTwo types of bridge partners were considered in this\nanalysis: bridge by age and bridge by race. Bridge by age,\nor the reporting of partners from two different age groups,\nwas very common in this population. Approximately 69%\nof the respondents reported partners in two different age\ngroups. The percentages were slightly lower for black and\nLatino respondents (66% of the blacks versus 65% of the\nLatinos).\nThe girls were much more likely to report partners in two\ndifferent age groups than the boys (61% of the boys versus\n77% of the girls, P  0.01).

The data indicate that whereas some similarity exists\namong partner characteristics, partners with different char-\nacteristics also are quite common. Similarity can be found in\nthe ethnicity of the partners associated with both white and\nblack adolescents. Most partners come from the same ethnic\ngroup. However, Latinos and respondents of other ethnicity\nhave partners of different ethnicity more frequently. These\nresults on ethnicity are consistent with those from studies of\nU.S. adults27 and urban youth.28 In contrast to the results for\nethnicity, partners of different ages often were observed in\nall ethnic groups. This was observed most often for female\nrespondents.\nA large proportion of the sample respondents reported\nmore than two sexual partnerships, concurrent partnerships,\nand partners in two different age groups. The reporting of\npartners in two different ethnic groups varied strongly by\nethnicity. The reporting of multiple partners and partners in\ntwo or more age or ethnic groups was very common in this\npopulation. Bridging by age was very common among girls,\nand bridging by ethnicity was very common among persons\nin Latino and other ethnic groups. Concurrent partnerships\nwere common in all age and ethnic groups.\nCondom use was reduced for persons with multiple part-\nners and for those with partners in different age groups.\nWhen control was used for these factors, condom use was\nfound to have a positive relationship to concurrency, al-\nthough the bivariate relationship was negative.\nIn a network study of chlamydia infection, Potterat et al17\nfound that both concurrency and a disassortative mixing\npattern by ethnicity were associated with chlamydia trans-\nmission. Although the dependent variable in the current\nstudy was condom use rather than chlamydia infection,\nother variables including number of partners and bridging\nby age were more important predictors of reduced condom\nuse. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of the current\nstudy, concurrency had a positive association with condom\nuse. Differences in results may have resulted from differ-\nences between adolescent and adult populations, and in the\nstudy selection criteria.\nIn a study of sexual networks among American adults,\nLaumann and Youm13 found that black adults usually se-\nlected blacks as sexual partners, and that there was much\nmore mixing between core and periphery groups in the\nblack population. The current study found a high degree of\nwithin-group choice among American adolescents, although\nlack of information about the sexual behavior of adolescent\npartners prevents a similar analysis of these data.\nThese findings from this study are important for STD\nclinics, family planing clinics, and other health providers\nwho work with sexually active adolescents. Multiple rela-\ntionships and relationships with persons of different age and\nethnic groups increase the vulnerability of adolescents to\nTABLE 6.

Adding to this risk is the\nlower use of condoms in these relationships. The counseling\nof sexually active adolescents should include discussion of\ndifferences in power or communication that may occur\nwhere a partner's personal characteristics may differ.\nReferences\n1.
