Continuous monitoring is essential part of the\nwork for any intervention to be carried out owing to the seasonal and inter-annual variability. The article discusses the\nmeasurement criteria and stages in an operational plan for a monitoring exercise, preparation and execution. Erosion\ncan be due to a variety of natural and anthropogenic causes in general. The topic draws attention of both researchers\nand coastal communities equally. This article explains the need for operational strategies for an optimal monitoring of\ncoastal erosion. Demonstration of such methodology was presented with a case study at a micro-tidal sandy beach\nlocated in Tamil Nadu. A generic set up for a plan boundary to measure met-ocean parameters over a time and spatial\nextent covering the beach and near-shore sediment regime, shore face and surf zone hydrodynamics is discussed. For\na detailed understanding, numerical models are set up against the measurements to have a feel of the spatial variability.\nValidation was taken up extensively and the predictions were used to enhance the measurements in spatial and temporal\nscales, advantages with such setup.\n",

The drivers can be\nmany, of which climate change and source sink alternation\nare major. Among coastal issues, near-shore erosion has\nbecome a major threat worldwide. Sediment erosion and\naccretion being natural processes, any anthropogenic\ninfluence exacerbates the environmental condition of the\ncoast. The population density and the developmental activ-\nities along the coastal belt accelerate the semi to perma-\nnent modification in an irreversible way. Every country\nhas reported erosion and accretion, whereas emphasis is\nbeing laid on coastal zone management and proper budget-\ning. Around 45.5% of Indian coastline is undergoing\ncoastal erosion, while about 19.8% of coastline is found to\nbe stable and 35.7% of coast shows signs of accretion\nMonitoring coastal erosion is undeniable due to its wide\nrange of impacts to the livelihood. For a sustainable coastal\nmanagement, it is necessary to understand the interrela-\ntionship between the physical processes and the forcing\nfactors, and their effects on the coastal system. Coast can\nbe studied in terms of shoreline dynamics (Boak and\nTurner, 2005) or in terms of near-shore morphological\nchanges. Understanding the processes involved in coastal\nerosion requires awareness on the interactions between\nonshore and offshore environmental processes that\nincludes wave energy and propagation direction, episodic\nweather events and trends in climate change, the materials\non the coast and the supply or extraction of sediments. In\nOperational strategy to monitor coastal\nerosion in tropical areas\nBasanta Kumar Jena, D Sathish Kumar and Karunakar Kintada\n Keywords\nCoastal erosion, hydrodynamic modelling, beach morphology, Littoral Environmental Observation and near-shore\nmeasurement\nCoastal and Environmental Engineering, National Institute of Ocean\nTechnology, Chennai, India\nCorresponding author:\nBasanta Kumar Jena, Coastal and Environmental Engineering, National\nEmail: bkjena@niot.res.in\nOriginal Article\n136 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\naddition, the influence of man-made structures can greatly\nalter the natural regime (Archetti and Zanuttigh, 2010;\nGranja and Pinho, 2012). The monitoring methods should\nbe as comprehensive as possible to obtain important infor-\nmation on regional bathymetry along with natural features\nand materials (Holland et al., 2009). Coastal morphology\nand its dynamics have to be quantified over time and ero-\nsion risks have to be evaluated considering present and\npotential future scenarios.\nSeveral methods from traditional beach surveying to\nremote sensing are in practice for coastal morphodynamic\nmonitoring. Static measurements are employed to conduct\nprofile surveys and slope of the beach. Although remotely\nsensed data have also been successfully used for coastal\nmonitoring, the results were accurate to the order of the\nresolution and validation undertaken. Satellite radar, par-\nticularly SyntheticAperture Radar (SAR), were used to get\nthe shoreline information (Niedermeier et al., 2000) and\naerial digital photography used to obtain three-dimen-\nsional (3D) information through photogrammetric analysis\nfixed video imagery (Archetti and Zanuttigh, 2010;\nDavidson et al., 2007) are also used which provide con-\ntinuous data, which can have an optimal temporal resolu-\ntion, but to limited stretches.\nLaser surveys can deliver similar or slightly better (10\u00ad\n15 cm) accuracy in the vertical component and can be an\nalternative to aerial photography techniques. The portabil-\nity of the equipment has facilitated rapid use, but the data\nhandling and processing are anchors in its advancement. A\nrecent approach to topographic surveys is videogramatic\nmobile mapping, where 3D coordinates are extracted from\nstereo video images and are used to monitor the shoreline\nchanges periodically.\nThe generalisation of GPS (Global Positioning System)\nmethods, particularly those using Real-Time Kinematic\ncorrections, has facilitated analysis of spatial variability\nallowing accurate 3D data to be collected both rapidly and\nat high spatial resolution (Barnard and Warrick, 2010).\nThis has been the technology deployed and is still widely\nin use for such assessments.\nOperational strategy\nA broad view on the composite nature of the coastal pro-\ncesses is essential for anticipated monitoring. The coastal\nzone management schemes pertinent to the area of interest,\nboth technical and socio economic, should be the basis of\nthe planning in general. The present methodology needs\nadaptive methods to be developed in grabbing comprehen-\nsive understanding of the system with existing state-of-\nthe-art facilities and minimising cost and uncertainties.\nThe strategic objectives for all inclusive plan elements\nhave an important role in up keeping the safety against\nhazards and formulate a `Frame of Reference'. It also aids\nin regulating the short-term and long-term management\npractices.\nThere are extensive management and monitoring strate-\ngies conceived worldwide particularly for coastal erosion\nissues. CONSCIENCE is one such project launched in\n2007 to enhance the implementation of scientific, sustain-\nable coastal erosion management in Europe (Marchand,\n2010). National integrated coastline management strategy\nis formulated and implemented by France since 2011 with\npriorities to develop coastline monitoring, to prepare strat-\negies that can be shared by public and private stakeholders\nand to move towards a policy for land planning by finding\nmethods for financial intervention. The National Coastal\nZone Management Program, the US programme, instituted\nby NOAA through the US Coastal Zone Management Act\nof 1972 developed to protect, restore and responsibly\ndevelop its nation's diverse coastal communities and\nresources. Many coastal countries have its policy and\naction plans to manage its coastal resources.\nIn the Indian context, the action plan for integrated\ncoastal management became more important due to rapid\ndevelopmental activities that degrade coastal resources in\nthe past three decades. The data for research and planning\nwere very scarce. Recognising the importance of data for\ncoastal and oceanographic research, National Institute of\nOcean Technology (NIOT), Chennai, instituted many\noperational monitoring programmes for data acquisition\naround the Indian coast. Monitoring programmes that are\nsuccessfully initiated by the institute includes (a) Coastal\nMonitoring System that sets up measurements for tide,\nwaves, currents and met-ocean parameters, (b) installation\nand monitoring of HF Radar that measure waves and sur-\nface currents to a maximum radius of 200 km from the\ncoast and (c) Ocean Observation Systems that widely\ndeploy instruments in the open ocean to measure all ocean-\nographic and meteorological parameters. The data sets\nobtained through these programmes are extensively used\nfor many management plan and actions. A separate pro-\ngramme, Sustainable Shoreline Management (SSM) pro-\nject, is organised by the institute for stabilisation of coast\nby adapting different erosion control measures along the\nerosion-prone coastal stretches in India.\nAccording to the Concepts and Science for Coastal\nErosion Management (Marchand, 2010), a Commission\nof the European Communities (EC)-funded project\ndescribes the decision-making technique for operational\nbeach management in a four-stage processes such as the\nfollowing: (a) quantitative state concept defines the pre-\nsent state of the coast and its natural behaviour, (b) bench-\nmarking process specifies whether any actions are\nrequired, (c) intervention procedure provides a detailed\ndefinition of what action is required when the benchmark\nvalues are exceeded and finally (d) evaluation procedure,\nthrough feedbacks the effectiveness of the management\nactions will be assessed.\nFor the first two stages wherever secondary data are\navailable with prerequisite accuracy, detailed measure-\nments are not required. Otherwise, a strategic plan of\nmeasurements has to be carried out to understand the\nlocalised physical and environmental conditions that regu-\nlate the natural behaviour of the coast. The presence of\ndatabase for a remote site/coastal village is difficult to\nestablish, unless a base line study has been carried out.\nThis article is built on such occasion and the details of set-\nting up an operational plan for measuring the parameters\nthat influence the sediment transport of the coast. The plan\nis optimised by numerical modelling from which areas of\nincreased sensitivity to specific processes at the site are\nidentified and field measurements are modified to suite the\ndata need to be collected.\nCriteria in developing operational strategy for\nerosion monitoring\nManagement plans are site-specific and hence monitoring\nshould adhere to the programme in addition to collection\nof standardised data set. Primary data play a substantial\nrole in every project management, and a specific field\noperational strategy for measurements is, therefore, criti-\ncal. The operational strategies are mainly developed for\nprimary data acquisition to implement an effective field\ncampaigning plan. Suitable control measures are pro-\nposed based on the data quality and numerical model\nresults.\nThe initial programme planning will be based on how\nto address the problem and the need for the coast (immedi-\nate and long time), with stakeholder's consultation if any.\nA thorough search for secondary data follows with a pre-\nliminary large-scale modelling effort to understand the\nlocal circulations if any. Although the secondary sources\nprovide an insight on the regional circulation, an intro-\nspective view of the system has to be evaluated whether it\naddresses the primary problem, otherwise unconvinced; a\nproper data collection strategy is envisaged. In the case of\ninsufficient data, a detailed operational field programme\ncan be planned and applied.\nAs there exist several ways of estimating the loss/ero-\nsion, both analytical and numerical, a general view has to\nbe taken without any bias. A simple numerical model\nshould be built with sensitivity analysis of different cali-\nbration parameters for the problem understudy. Then a\ncontrol boundary has to be chosen and measurements for\nvalidating the concept should be planned. It follows by\nchoice/availability of instruments, time and spatial scales\nof measurement to be listed. A detailed financial implica-\ntion has to be prepared and should undergo external assess-\nment for funding, after which deployments have to be\nundertaken on the approved time scales.\nNIOT has undertaken such deployments for research,\nfor more than two decades. Over time, different systems\nwere tried and a systematic operational strategy, as shown\nin Figure 1, was developed for undertaking beach mor-\nphology and erosion cases.\nSivakholundu et al. (2014) have given a brief overview\non the problem. This study is formulated based on it. The\narea falling in a micro-tidal region with minimal water\nlevel gradients, greater emphasis was laid on other param-\neters. This includes met-ocean elements, observed inde-\npendently against requirement.\nSite description\nThe said site falls on the south of Chennai, India. Kadalore\nChinnakuppam, Kadalore Periyakuppam (KPK) and\nAalikuppam are three villages located closely within a dis-\ntance of 0.5 km to the south of palar estuary (Figure 2).\nThis region has undergone severe erosion since 2011,\nowing to tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, namely,\nMadi in December 2013, which created a permanent drift\nin coastline kinetics. The beach has not recovered natu-\nrally over subsequent years. This resulted in exposure of\ncoastal buildings to direct wave battering (Figure 3).\nGenerally, east coast is understood to have a net northward\ndrift with seasonal inversion. The discharges through the\nriver are largely uncertain owing to upstream dams and\nnon-perennial nature.\nField observation plan\nAt first, a field monitoring plan has been prepared to quan-\ntify variation in the beach volume over a period. Real-\nTime Kinematic (RTK) GPS surveys were employed to\nestablish beach profiles. Surveys were conducted every\nmonth at spring low tides. The unit width volumes along\nwith gridded data sets on very fine site data were calcu-\nlated across the entire stretch. Littoral Environmental\nObservation (LEO) was carried out to have a manual feel\non the breaking characteristics and estimate long-shore\ncurrent (Figure 4) by using simple methods proposed by\nAnnual changes in the beach area above water level\n(Figure 5) were carried out in Shoreline and Nearshore\nData System (SANDS) package and net erosion has been\nobserved. The net annual average long-shore sediment\ntransport rate calculated using Central Electricity\nRegulatory Commission (CERC) formula (Coastal\nmagnitude is in acceptable limits with existing literature\n(Jena et al., 2001). With a brief understanding of the net\nchanges, a process-based model is planned for further\nassessment. This includes wave transformation and two-\nway coupled flow hydrodynamics. Coupled wave and\nhydrodynamic model has been used by Bhaskaran et al.\n138 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\nMurty et al. (2016) to study cyclonic impacts on coast inun-\ndation in a regional level. The present model domain is\nconstructed such that it reflects all the above-mentioned\nshallow water processes. This requires a calibration of flow\nmodel to properly represent the wave refraction by the\ncurrent, circulation cells if any. An initial validation\nagainst measurements is essential as the sensitivity of\nlittoral transport to friction is expected to be high.\nKeeping above aspects, a deployment plan has been\nprepared (Figure 2). After a thorough sensitivity assess-\nment, feasibility for deploying instruments was exten-\nsively deliberated and measurement depths are arrived.\nThe collection strategy includes continuous and rapid\nmeasurement sessions. The measurement scheme planned\nincludes a current meter in the northern section, a tide in\nsouthern portion and waves offshore. An integrated meas-\nurement inside the control boundary at two locations was\nplanned for the validation. LEO observations were carried\nout on a daily basis for a long-term assessment.\nInstruments used\nBathymetry was obtained from field surveys using echo\nsounder and DGPS, logged on the Hypack software.\nMeasurements such as wave, current and water levels have\nWave measurement was carried out at three locations by\ninstruments of different make.

Stages in development of a field operational plan.\ndepth, around 7 km offshore from Kadalur Periyakuppam.\nAcoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) is deployed at 12 m,\n4 m water depths in line with the first location. The advan-\ntages of this deployment include collection of wave, cur-\nrent and tide information simultaneously.\nThe Wave and Tide Recorder (WTR) measures tide and\nRCM 9 captures the current data. LEO plates were used\nand GPS floats were deployed for the calibration. Trained\npersonnel were deployed for carrying out the surf zone\ncharacteristics including LEO.\nNumerical model\nThe numerical model was setup on Delft3D suite. The\nmodel domain was aligned with the control boundary, with\nincremental resolution curvilinear grids (Figure 4). A cou-\npled wave and flow model was simulated to calibrate with\nthe data measured off KPK at 12 m depth. Measured wave,\ntide and current data sets are used as model boundaries to\nassess the calibration of underlying variables. Bursts in\ndata are avoided as current generation numerical models\nbecome computationally expensive for such assessments.\nA comprehensive validation has been undertaken against\nmeasurements.\nAlthough the measurements are verified and quality\ncontrolled, certain stretches remain flagged and authentic-\nity cannot be established. Such data sets were kept in sus-\npension. Although the beach erosion can be largely\nattributed to the wave and calibration of the model has\nbeen undertaken extensively, the third-generation model\nFigure 2. Location of Kadalur Periyakuppam.\n140 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\nstill has limitations in very shallow water. Sensitivity to\ndifferent formulations is not undertaken at the moment and\nstandard cases are expected to be representative. Wind-\ninduced circulations in shallow water is another major fac-\ntor, which can alter the tidal flow direction.\nThe above model has been input with boundaries\nderived from the global models on a time-to-time basis,\nand the surf zone width and long-shore current were esti-\nmated. The sediment transport model of Van Rijn (2007)\nwas used to estimate the drift. The advantage of the two-\ndimensional (2D) model was taken to assess the formation\nof bars. The model-derived depth-averaged velocity for\nsea and swell conditions (Figures 6 and 7) along the coast\nclearly captures the pattern of near-shore currents due to\nbreaking waves from which the point of measurement is\nfurther planned to observe more intensively. The results\nare validated against LEO measurements, as presented in\nTable 2. With these generated information, the observation\nlocations were altered spatially to capture the required\nalong-shore current characteristics both spatially and tem-\nporally, the bathymetry surveys on the bar migrations.\nWith above-said strategy, LEO data set for over 3 years\nwas collected so far.\nConclusion\nThe present coast is observed to be influenced by tropical\nclimate system and that of Bay of Bengal, having two\nFigure 3. Exposure of building foundation due to waves.\nTable 1. Annual average long-shore sediment transport.\nFigure 5. Long-shore currents measured using LEO plates.\nFigure 6. Depth-averaged near-shore currents during swell.\n142 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\nmonsoon spells with seasonal winds and driven circula-\ntion. Additionally, storm waves batter the coast at least\nonce in a year, which sets different erosional rates on the\ncoast within the season. So a systematic deployment plan\nunder the adopted operational strategy is to be followed.\nErosion control measures for any coast requires an\nextensive understanding of the coastal setting and sedi-\nment transport patterns. Measurements in near-shore envi-\nronments are often tedious and more expensive due to\nuncertain environmental conditions with breaking waves,\nswift currents and surprisingly vandalism. Innovative\nmethods wielded out of experience are adapted for each\nspecific cases. The operational strategy thus plays a vital\nrole in data collection methodology to find a suitable solu-\ntion based on the existent scenarios. It has to be understood\nthat the strategies often differ with issues faced by the\ncoast of interest.\nWith the given methodology of measurements at site,\ncalibration and numerical modelling prediction going hand\nin hand according to the operational strategy setup for this\nlocation, desirable along-shore currents were achieved.\nThe strategy also recommends long-term field measure-\nments for a complete understanding of the site.\n"
