The latest\nversion of R-ZES, Resolute OnyxTM, was\ninvestigated the 1-year clinical outcomes of\npatients who had received this new\ntechnology.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design and population\nThis was a single-centre retrospective\nregistry analysis. From the launch of\nResolute OnyxTM, all patients treated in\nthe Division of Cardiology, Queen Mary\nHospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong\nKong who had been fitted with a Resolute\nFebruary 2016 were identified in the hospital\ndatabase and recruited to the analysis. There\nwere no exclusion criteria except patients\nlost to follow-up or those who could not\nbe contacted for assessment at 1 year after\nstent implantation. Baseline demographics,\nprocedural details and follow-up data\nwere recorded. All treatment and clinical\ndecision-making processes were subject to\nthe attending cardiologists.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Ethics Committee of Queen\nMary Hospital, University of Hong Kong,\ninformed consent was waived by the\nInstitutional Ethics Committee as this was\na retrospective analysis without any alter-\nation in patient management.\nStudy endpoints\nThe primary endpoint was 1-year target\nlesion failure (TLF), defined as a composite\nof cardiac death, myocardial infarction\n(not clearly attributed to a non-target\nvessel), or a clinically indicated target\nlesion revascularization by percutaneous or\nsurgical methods at 12 months. All clinical\noutcomes were defined according to the\nAcademic Research Consortium (ARC).4\nDeaths were considered cardiac unless an\nunequivocal non-cardiac cause could be\nestablished. Secondary endpoints included\nindividual components of the primary out-\ncomes: target vessel myocardial infarction;\nclinically-driven target lesion revasculariza-\ntion (TLR), defined as repeat revasculariza-\ntion within the stented segment including\n5 mm proximal and distal border zones;\nclinically-driven target vessel revasculariza-\ntion (TVR) and stent thrombosis defined\naccording to the ARC as definite, probable,\nor possible.4 A revascularization was con-\nsidered clinically-driven if repeat angiog-\nraphy showed a diameter stenosis !50%\nwith at least one of the following: (i) history\nof recurrent angina pectoris, presumably\nrelated to the target vessel; (ii) objective\nsigns of ischaemia at rest or during exercise\ntest by electrocardiogram, presumably\nrelated to the target vessel; (iii) abnormal\ntest results of invasive functional diagnostic\ntest (fractional flow reserve); or (iv) a TLR\nwith a diameter stenosis !70% even in the\nabsence of the aforementioned ischaemic\nsigns or symptoms.\nStudy device\nResolute OnyxTM (Medtronic Inc., Santa\nRosa, CA, USA) is a zotarolimus-eluting\nstent designed for higher procedural success\nand better acute performance. The design is\nbased on its predecessor, the ResoluteTM\nIntegrity drug-eluting stent, which was\nextensively studied in the Resolute Global\nClinical Program.3 In brief, the stent is\nmanufactured using continuous sinusoid\ntechnology that employs a single strand of\nwire to form a sinusoidal pattern of crowns,\nwhich is laser fused at selected crowns. This\ndistinctive wire-forming facilitates smooth\ntracking in tortuous vessels and allows\nexcellent conformability.5 The drug polymer\nBioLinx is highly biocompatible with a\nhydrophilic surface designed to minimize\ninflammation.6 The polymer elutes the drug\nzotarolimus, which is a synthetic analogue\nthe zotarolimus dose released by day 60.7\nThe latest version Resolute OnyxTM utilizes\ncore-wire technology in which the cobalt\nalloy incorporates a platinum iridium core\nfor increased radiopacity. Moreover, the\nstrut thickness is further reduced to 81 mm\nstrength and the crossing profile is\nResolute OnyxTM stents used in patients\nincluded in this registry study ranged from\n2.0 mm to 5.0 mm diameters and the stent\nlengths were up to 38 mm.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Continuous variables are as\nmean \u00c6 SD. Categorical values are pre-\nsented as absolute values or percentages.\nComparison of continuous data was per-\nformed by one-way analysis of variance,\nMann\u00adWhitney U-test or independent-\nsamples t-test depending on data distribution.\n2-test and Fisher's exact test were used\nto compare categorical data. A two-sided\nP-value of 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\npatients were implanted with Resolute\nOnyxTM stents. Two patients were lost to\nfollow-up, so 250 patients completed the\n1-year assessment and were entered into this\nanalysis. A total of 577 Resolute OnyxTM\nstents were implanted. Baseline demograph-\nics are presented in Table 1; 89 patients\nmellitus and 21 patients (8.4%) with end-\nstage renal failure (ESRF) were on dialysis\n(haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis).\nInterventional procedures and lesion details\nare presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.\nwith acute coronary syndrome including ST\nelevation myocardial infarction and eight\npatients (3.2%) had cardiogenic shock.

Lesion characteristics of patients who\nwere implanted with Resolute OnyxTM stents\nLesion characteristic\nCohort who received\nResolute OnyxTM\nData presented as n of patients (%).\nthose with ultra-high-risk characteristics.\nFor example, this current cohort included\npatients with cardiogenic shock, patients\nwith ESRF receiving dialysis, a high pro-\nportion of patients with T2DM and even\npatients who presented with cardiac arrest\nrequiring haemodynamic support. This cur-\nrent cohort reflects real-world coronary\nintervention practices, which is difficult to\nstudy in prospective randomized clinical\ntrials. In this present study, many of the\nTLFs occurred in those ultra-high-risk\npatients and this further provides insight\ninto the use of the Resolute OnyxTM stent in\na real-world population.\nIn the present study, 45% of patients had\ndiabetes mellitus and 70% had small vessel\ndisease. Small vessel stenting has tradition-\nally been associated with higher rates of\nrestenosis and repeat revascularizations.9,10\nThe degree of neointimal proliferation is\nrelatively independent of the reference vessel\nsize and hence the proportion of cross-\nsectional luminal narrowing is higher in\nsmall vessels compared with large vessels.11\nThe problem is further complicated by the\npresence of T2DM that predisposes to\nneointimal hyperplasia while patients with\nT2DM tend to have diffuse small vessel\ndisease.12 These current data suggest that\nthe Resolute OnyxTM stent had similar\noutcomes in small and large vessel diseases,\nwhich is similar to its predecessor stent as\ndemonstrated by the Resolute Global\nClinical Program small vessel subgroup\nanalysis.13 Even in ultra-small vessels\nimplanted with a 2.0 mm Resolute OnyxTM\nstent, the results were satisfactory and fur-\nther studies will be required to investigate\nthe optimal treatment of ultra-small vessel\ndiseases.\nOf the patients in the current study who\nexperienced TLF within 1 year, a significant\nproportion were patients with ESRF receiv-\ning dialysis (five of 11 patients). Chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) is known to be\nassociated with increased mortality and\nmorbidity from coronary artery disease.14\nParticularly in those with ESRF on dialysis,\nwho are frequently excluded from clinical\ntrials, treatment failures are common after\nrevascularization no matter whether percu-\ntaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cor-\nonary bypass grafting are performed.15 Even\nwith second-generation DES, the 1-year\nTLF rate approached 15% and more than\n30% needed repeat revascularization in\nlonger term follow-up.16\u00ad18 In this current\nregistry, five out of 21 ESRF patients (24%)\nsuffered from TLF within 1 year, which is\nquite a high proportion. With the aging\npopulation, increasing prevalence of T2DM,\nCKD and better renal support, the incidence\nof coronary artery disease in patients\nwith ESRF is set to increase. Further\nadvancements in coronary revascularization\ntechnology including PCI and stenting is\nTable 5.

First,\na lack of a control group prevents compari-\nson with other stents. Secondly, the small\nsample size and low event rates render\nconclusive outcome and independent pre-\ndictor analyses difficult. Furthermore, the\nretrospective study design was subject to\nselection bias, although it allowed recruit-\nment of a real-world PCI practice cohort\nand only two patients were lost to follow-up.\nIn conclusion, the Resolute OnyxTM stent\nshowed a favourable 1-year clinical per-\nformance in a real-world population.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nHung Fat Tse received consulting fees from\nMedtronic.
