Age adjusted rates of total, occupant,\npedestrian, and alcohol related fatalities were calculated. The total MVC fatality rate for each race/\nethnic group was then adjusted for proportion of rural residence.\nResults: Compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), American Indians had raised relative risks for\nMVC fatality in all gender and residence subgroups. Hispanic females and rural Hispanic males had\nlower relative risks, as did rural African-American men.\nRaised relative risks for American Indian men and women included all subgroups: total, occupant,\npedestrian, and alcohol related. Hispanic and African-American men both had raised relative risks of\npedestrian related fatalities, and Hispanic men had a slightly higher relative risk while Hispanic women\nhad a lower relative risks, for alcohol related fatality. Hispanic men and women and African-American\nmen had lower occupant fatality rates. Close to half (45%) of the excess MVC fatality among American\nIndians can be attributed to residence in rural areas, where MVC fatality rates are higher. There were\n1.85 occupants in crashes involving NHW deaths compared with 2.51 for Hispanics and 2.71 for\nAmerican Indians (p<0.001). The proportion of occupants not using a seatbelt was higher in Hispanics\nand American Indians in both urban and rural areas.\nConclusion: The major disparity in MVC fatality in Arizona is among American Indians. The higher\nMVC fatality rates among American Indians occur in all age groups, in both urban and rural areas,\nand among occupants and pedestrians. Rural residence, lower rates of seatbelt use, higher rates of\nalcohol related crashes, a greater number of occupants, and higher rates of pedestrian deaths all con-\ntribute to the American Indian MVC fatality disparity.\nHigh rates of pedestrian fatality occur in men in all three race/ethnic minorities in Arizona and among\nAmerican Indian women. In contrast to other studies, African-Americans and Hispanics did not have\nraised total MVC fatality rates and compared to NHWs actually had lower rates in the rural areas of\nthe state.\nUnintentional injuries are the fifth leading cause of death\nin the US and 45% of injury deaths are caused by motor\nvehicle crashes (MVC). The MVC death rate differs by\nHispanics.1\nThere has been little scientific research into the causes of\ndifferent racial/ethnic MVC fatality rates. The bulk of the\nliterature addresses the excess MVC fatality among American\nIndians.2\u00ad12 In addition, Schiff and Becker have documented\nhigher MVC fatality rates among both Hispanics and\nAmerican Indians compared with non-Hispanic whites\nin Colorado, Hispanics had MVC fatality rates 1.7 times those\nof NHWs with higher rates among drivers, occupants, and\npedestrians.13 Baker et al found similar rates of occupant fatal-\nity among African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites among\nthose ages 5\u00ad19 years but when these rates were adjusted for\nvehicle miles traveled, African-Americans had higher fatality\nrates in the age range 5\u00ad12, followed by Hispanics whereas\nHispanics had the highest rates among those 13\u00ad19 years of\nVarious explanations have been offered for these differ-\nences. Several studies have documented higher rates of alcohol\nfatalities5\u00ad8 16 among American Indians.

The race of each person\nkilled is not listed. We used all FARS records for crashes that\noccurred in Arizona during the study period. The National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) multiple cause of death\nfile is compiled from death certificates and includes the causes\nof death, personal information including race, and residence.\nWe used the NCHS records for Arizona residents that listed an\nInternational Classification of Diseases code of E810 through E825\n(motor vehicle fatalities).\nUsing a method first described by Fife, we matched FARS\nrecords to NCHS records to create a data set comprising vari-\nables from both files.28 We first matched on the common vari-\nables of age, gender, date of death, and county of death.\nMatched records were then extracted from each data set. Since\nsome records differed only by county where the death\noccurred, we then matched using age, gender, and date of\ndeath; again, matched records were extracted. The final match\nsequence included age, gender, county, and date of death but\nallowed the age from the FARS record to vary by one year from\nthe NCHS age. We excluded motorcycle and bicycle fatalities.\nmet the criteria noted; 4307 matches were achieved using all\nfour common variables, 287 matches resulted after excluding\nthe county, and 181 matches used all four variables with age\nallowed to vary by one year. Thereby, a total of 4775 matches\nwere achieved, 87% of NCHS records and 77% of FARS records,\nrepresenting 4305 crashes. There was no significant difference\nbetween the proportion of death certificates matched for\nAmerican Indians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and NHWs.\nEach fatality was then classified according to race/ethnicity,\ngender; and urban, rural. We classified race into five groups:\nAfrican-American, American Indian, NHW, Hispanic, and\nothers based on information from the NCHS record. For the\nurban/rural variable we classified two counties as urban: Mar-\nicopa County, which contains Phoenix, has a population den-\nsity of 231 per square mile, and Pima County, which contains\nTucson, has a density of 73 per square mile. The other 13 Ari-\nzona counties, with population densities ranging from 3\u00ad24\nper square mile, were classified as rural. (One American\nIndian reservation in Pima County, the Tohono O'odham, was\nclassified as rural due to its size and distant location from Tuc-\nson.) Each death was classified as an occupant (drivers and\npassengers) or pedestrian using the FARS data. Seatbelt use,\nnumber of occupants, and the designation of alcohol related\nwere taken from FARS. The alcohol related variable used was\nthe police designation of whether the crash was alcohol\nrelated.\nPopulation denominators for each year were derived from\nBureau). When calculating rates for the entire period, the 1993\npopulation estimates were used. Age adjusted rates were cal-\nculated using the direct method with the 2000 US population\nas a standard. Annualized rates were calculated by dividing\nthe rates for the entire period by seven.\nAn urban/rural adjustment was performed by calculating\nwhat each race/ethnic specific age adjusted MVC rate would be\nif the urban/rural residence distribution were the same as for\nNHWs. Significance levels were set at p<0.05 and 95% confi-\ndence intervals were calculated for all statistical tests except\nfor the age group comparisons where, due to the number of\ncomparisons, a p<0.01 was used.\nRESULTS\nAfrican-American, and 54 other. Because of the low number in\nthe \"other\" category, these were excluded from further analy-\nHispanics, 200 American Indians, and 27 African-Americans\n(13 were not listed).\nTable 1 shows the annualized, age adjusted MVC fatality\nrates by gender and residence for each race/ethnic group.\nAmerican-Indians had the highest rate in all four groups.\nTheir relative risks were over three times those of NHWs in all\ngroups. Hispanics had lower rates than NHWs in all groups\nexcept urban males whereas African-Americans had lower\nrural rates in males.\nTables 2 and 3 show the occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol\nrelated MVC fatality rates for males (urban and rural\ncombined) and females respectively. Compared with NHW\nmales, Hispanic males had lower rates of occupant and total\nMVC fatality and higher rates of pedestrian and alcohol\nrelated fatality while African-American men had a higher\npedestrian fatality rate. American Indian males had higher\nrates in all categories. Compared with NHW females, Hispanic\nfemales had lower occupant, alcohol related and total fatality\nrates, African-Americans had lower occupant fatality rates,\nand American Indians had higher rates in all categories.\nWomen had lower total, occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol\nrelated fatality rates than men in each racial/ethnic group but\nAmerican Indian women had higher rates in each category\nthan did men in all other racial/ethnic groups.\nTable 4 shows what the total MVC fatality rate for each\nrace/ethnic group would be if their urban/rural residence dis-\ntribution were the same as NHWs (80% urban). The\nurban/rural adjustment changes the Hispanic and African-\nAmerican rates only slightly whereas the American Indian\nrate declines by 26%. Close to half (45%) of the excess\nmortality of American Indians (the difference between the\nAmerican Indian and NHW rates) is accounted for by their\nhigher proportion of rural residents.\nTable 5 lists the total MVC fatality rate by age for each race/\nethnic group. Compared with NHWs, Hispanic females have\nAmerican Indian men had significantly higher rates in all age\nTable 1 Annualized MVC fatality rates*, by gender, residence, and race/ethnicity, Arizona, 1990\u00ad96\nWhite American Indian Hispanic African-American\nRate (No) RR Rate (No) RR 95% CI Rate (No) RR 95% CI Rate (No) RR 95% CI\nRR, relative risk compared to non-Hispanic whites.\nCI, confidence interval.\n252 Campos-Outcalt, Bay, Dellapena, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\ngroups except age 75 and older whereas American Indian\nwomen had significantly higher rates in seven out of nine age\ngroups.

The police\ndesignation of alcohol involvement can be a subjective\njudgment and may or may not be corroborated by a blood\nTable 2 Total, occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol related MVC fatality rates* for\nTotal MVC fatality Occupant Pedestrian Alcohol related\nRR, relative risk compared to non-Hispanic whites.\nCI, confidence interval.\nTable 3 Total, occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol related MVC fatality rates* for\nTotal MVC fatality Occupant Pedestrian Alcohol related\nRR, relative risk compared to non-Hispanics whites.\nCI, confidence interval.\nTable 4 Urban and rural MVC fatality rates* by race/ethnicity, Arizona, 1990\u00ad96\n% Urban Urban rate Rural rate Total Adjusted\nUsing the formula (0.8 \u00d7 urban rate + 0.2 \u00d7 rural rate).\nMotor vehicle crash fatalities by race/ethnicity 253\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nalcohol concentration (BAC) measurement. One study in\nwestern Washington state found that police assessment of\ndriver intoxication was reasonably accurate when investigat-\ning crashes that involved a driver who was transported to a\ntrauma center.29 Whether this degree of accuracy is achieved\naround the country in fatal crashes involving drivers of differ-\nent races/ethnicities is unknown. There are several variables in\nFARS pertaining to alcohol, each with limitations. To the\nextent that a race/ethnic group is subject to bias or police pre-\nconceived notions of alcohol impairment, their rates of alcohol\ninvolvement will be higher or lower depending on the\ndirection of the bias. This issue is deserving of further study. In\nour data, there were no race/ethnic differences in the\nproportion of urban fatalities with BAC measured. However,\nonly 20% of American Indian fatalities in rural areas had a\nBAC measured compared with 29% of Hispanics and 33% of\nNHWs (p<0.001). There was an across-the-board lower\nproportion of fatalities with BAC measured in rural areas\nAnother limitation is the lack of vehicle and pedestrian\nexposure data. Without knowing the vehicle miles driven or\npedestrian miles walked for different race/ethnic groups, we\ncannot tell if differences are due to amount of exposure or to\nother variables.\nThe problems with race/ethnic identification are well\nknown. The NCHS classification is taken from death\ncertificates and is subject to the degree of accuracy in the state\nagency responsible for vital statistics (in Arizona, the Arizona\nDepartment of Health Services). In New Mexico high accuracy\nhas been found for the designation of Hispanics9 but it is\nunknown if Arizona also achieves this rate of accuracy.\nUnder-classification of American Indian deaths is well\ndocumented.30 Under-counting American Indian deaths will\nresult in a mortality rate that will be underestimated. Census\nclassification of race/ethnicity is self designated. There is per-\nsistent concern in Arizona that race/ethnic groups are under-\ncounted; this is especially a potential for Hispanics because of\nthe large number of undocumented Hispanics who reside in\nthe state. To the degree that this undercounting occurs, calcu-\nlated mortality rates will be overestimated.\nWith the cautions just discussed in mind, this study found\nthat the only race/ethnic group to have consistently higher\nrates of MVC fatality was American Indians. In comparison\nwith NHWs, Hispanics had significantly lower rates except for\nurban males. African-American males had slightly higher\nrates in urban areas but lower rates in rural areas;\nAfrican-American females had rates similar to NHWs.\nHigher mortality rates for American Indians were found\namong both occupants and pedestrians, in both men and\nwomen in urban and rural areas, and in most age groups.\nClose to half of the excess American Indian MVC fatalities can\nbe attributed to the proportion who live in rural areas. Alcohol\nuse, number of occupants, seatbelt non-use, and pedestrian\ndeaths were all contributors to the raised American Indian\nMVC fatality rate. A similar result was found in the Pacific\nNorthwest where raised MVC injury rates were found among\nAmerican Indians, more so in rural than in urban areas, and\nalcohol impairment and seatbelt non-use were higher among\nThis study is consistent with one conducted a decade ago\nthat also showed increased rates of rural, occupant, pedes-\ntrian, and alcohol related mortality rates among American\nIndians in Arizona.8 Since that time MVC mortality rates have\nimproved among all Arizonans, except American Indian\nfemales. However, the improvements have been greater in\nnon-American Indian males and this, plus the lack of\nimprovement in American Indian females, has caused\nincreased American Indian relative risks of MVC mortality in\nOne issue regarding motor vehicle safety in rural Arizona is\nthe autonomous legal status of reservations. Arizona has 22\nIndian reservations, each with separate traffic laws and differ-\ning levels of resources devoted to enforcement. This can lead to\nmore lenient law enforcement, which can influence rates of\nspeeding, seatbelt use, or driving under the influence of alco-\nhol. There are examples of motor vehicle safety programs and\nenhanced enforcement in American Indian communities that\nhave been successful.2 32 33 At the time of the study one tribe\nhad passed its own seatbelt law and six others had adopted\nthe Arizona state law, resulting in 82% of the American Indian\nreservation population being covered by one or the other laws.\nIn addition, the Indian Health Service initiated an emergency\ntakes about 10 years before such systems can be expected to\nreduce MVC mortality.35\nThere are a number of programs communities can adopt to\nattempt to reduce MVC fatalities. The Task Force on Commu-\nnity Preventive Services has published recommendations on\nhow to increase the use of child safety seats and seatbelts and\nhow to reduce alcohol impaired driving. These recommenda-\ntions include a combination of community education, stronger\nTable 5 Total MVC fatality rates* by age and race/ethnicity, Arizona, 1990\u00ad96\nWhite Hispanic American Indian African-American\nMale\nFemale\nCompared to non-Hispanic whites the difference is significant at p<0.01.\n254 Campos-Outcalt, Bay, Dellapena, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nlaws, and enhanced law enforcement.36 To the extent that\nAmerican Indian communities adopt these strategies, their\nMVC fatality burden should decline.\nIn addition, half of the American Indian reservations in\nArizona prohibit the sale and possession of alcohol, including\nthe two largest. For residents of large and isolated reservations\nthis can mean a long drive or walk to obtain alcohol. The effect\nof these policies on total MVC mortality is unknown. In urban\nareas increased availability of alcohol is associated with\nincreased rates of alcohol related crashes,37 whereas research\nin rural areas has had mixed results when examining the\nrelationship of distance to alcohol outlets and the incidence of\nalcohol related crashes.38\u00ad40 However, none of these studies are\nspecific to American Indian communities.\nThis study found lower MVC fatality rates in Hispanics\ncompared with NHWs even though Hispanic men had higher\nrelative risks for alcohol related and pedestrian deaths and\nmen and women combined had a higher proportion of seatbelt\nnon-use among occupants killed. This may reflect fewer vehi-\ncle miles traveled compared with other race/ethnic groups.\nThis result is not consistent with two other studies performed\nin the Southwest where higher MVC fatality was found\namong Hispanics in Colorado and New Mexico.9 13 One of\nthese, by Schiff and Becker, took place 32 years ago, however.9\nIn addition, New Mexico has a higher proportion of the popu-\nlation that is rural than does Arizona and rural and urban\ncrashes were not analyzed separately. Harper et al used a simi-\nlar method in a nearby state.13 While that study included resi-\ndence (urban, rural) in the variables studied, and Hispanics\nhad a lower proportion of fatalities occurring in rural areas\nthan did whites, separate urban and rural rates were not cal-\nculated. It is not possible to discern what the results of adjust-\ning for residence would be. Our results should serve to caution\nagainst extrapolating race/ethnic differences in one state to\nanother, even if the states are in the same geographic region.\nWhile this study shows, in our state, that Hispanics and\nAfrican-Americans have population based MVC rates similar\nto NHWs, it does not allow any conclusion about risk related\nto vehicle miles driven or trips taken. It is also unclear how\nsocioeconomic factors, such as income levels, educational lev-\nels, employment rates or occupations, affect MVC fatality\nrates. The higher pedestrian fatalities among the three ethnic\nminority groups may be related to less access to motor vehicle\ntransportation and public transportation, and increased rates\nof traveling by foot, and specific circumstances of pedestrian\ntravel that are particularly hazardous such as on roads with\npoor lighting and no sidewalks.5 The greater mean number of\npassengers among American Indians and Hispanics may also\nbe related to less availability of car transportation, thereby\nplacing a greater number of individuals at risk during a crash.\nUsing an older car can increase risk because of lower safety\nstandards. However, the age of cars at the time of the crash in\nthis study did not differ by the race/ethnicity of the drivers.\nIncome probably also affects the number of miles driven and\nthe exposure to risk of a MVC. All these issues deserve further\nstudy.\nWhile improvements in MVC fatality continue to be made,\nthere remains a marked disparity in Arizona for American\nIndian MVC fatality. Ways to decrease pedestrian and alcohol\nrelated fatalities, increase use of seatbelts and to affect the\nfactors associated with rural related MVC fatality, such as road\nconditions and access to emergency services, need to be found\nif this disparity is to be reduced.\n"
