    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article explores potentially productive parallels between ethnographic interviewing, mindfulness-based practices,\nand recovery processes. First, we consider ethnographic interviews as dialogic and affective encounters that reflect and\ncomplement the recovery process, paradoxically enhancing agency by illuminating one's lack of control. For individuals in\nrecovery from substance abuse and associated trauma, the ethnographic interview may provide an opportunity to examine\npast events and gain insight into factors that contributed to risky situations and behaviors. We propose that the dialogic space\ncreated by the ethnographic interview resembles the moment-to-moment awareness cultivated by mindfulness practices\nand may have individual-level benefits for similar reasons. We briefly explore the relevance of recent research on epigenetic\nand neural plasticity. Finally, the potential for greater awareness of these mindfulness mechanisms to enhance ethnographic\ninterviews is discussed.\n",

Beginners would like to avoid or\nshorten this period; they do not realize how fruitful it is.\nIn our interviews with recently arrested street sex workers, I\n(first author) remember the early morning chill arriving at\nthe jail; the slow process of moving through layers of secu-\nrity and the physical barriers of gates opening and closing;\nyelling \"Hit!\" to the correctional officers inside the plate\nglass to activate the door; waiting outside the cells for women\nto come out while my colleague (second author) entered the\n\"pod\" to meet with them and offer the opportunity to partici-\npate in our research. Then we would move to a separate,\nsemiprivate room, mostly soundproof but with windows all\naround, where we were seen but not heard by the officers in\nthe control station. There we went through the lengthy pro-\ncess of informed consent that paved the way for the inter-\nviews at the core of our research design.\nI also remember the awkward first moments of the inter-\nview, as I attuned myself to the emotional timbre of the com-\nplex individual in front of me and adjusted once again to the\ncold imposition of the jail setting and to the compelling\nnarratives that emerged in response to the questions I posed,\nsometimes deeply personal in the depth of their detail. These\nfumbling moments were not considered \"research\" in our\nformal research design, but they were fundamental to the\nprocess of establishing a space where these narratives could\nunfold, in spite of those cold institutional surroundings.\nWe began conducting these ethnographic interviews in\n2009, as part of a mixed-methods study of substance misuse\nand street sex workers in the Detroit area. These interviews\nwere not intended to be therapeutic; they were neither a form\nof treatment nor a tool of diagnosis, but a method of schol-\narly inquiry. However, in carrying out such interviews, we\nfound that participants sometimes claimed a therapeutic ben-\nefit from the interview, even though none was promised or\nintended. The question was, simply, \"why?\"\nAs we became immersed in the study of people in recovery\nand their social contexts, we also grew increasingly interested\n1University of Michigan\u00adDearborn, USA\n2The City of Detroit, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPaul Draus, University of Michigan\u00adDearborn, 4901 Evergreen Road,\nEmail: draus@umich.edu\nParallel Paradoxes and Useful\nUselessness: Notes on the Confluence\nof Ethnography, Mindfulness, and\nRecovery\nPaul Draus1, Juliette Roddy1, and Kanzoni Asabigi2\n Keywords\nsociological research methods, sociology, social sciences, sociological theory, sociology of health and illness, alcohol, drugs,\nand tobacco, sociology of mental health\n2 SAGE Open\n(on an intellectual level) and engaged (on an interpersonal\nlevel) in the process of recovery itself. In the course of our\ninterviews, it became apparent that our act of listening was\nitself important not only for research purposes (the data\ngleaned from it) but also for the embodied process of recovery\nof which we were now effectively a part.\nWe began to consider the ways in which ethnographic\ninterviews themselves might contribute to recovery, even\nif--perhaps even because--that effect was unintended. In\nthe pages that follow, we propose that these interviews func-\ntioned as dialogic encounters, which may actually enhance\nprocesses of recovery, in part because they promote a non-\ngoal-directed state of mindfulness. We support this claim\nwith examples from our research. We then consider the par-\nallel paradoxes inherent in sociology, recovery and mindful-\nness as they relate to expanding agency by surrendering\ncontrol. Finally, we conclude with a reflective discussion on\nthe positive potential of this link between mindfulness, eth-\nnography, and recovery, and the importance of being truly\npresent in ethnographic research.\nEthnographic Interviews as Dialogic\nand Affective Encounters\nAs noted above, ethnographic interviews are very different\nfrom interviews used as therapy. Ethnographers do not seek\nto diagnose or assist people with life management skills\nthrough interviewing them, and our informed consent explic-\nitly states that we are not a part of a treatment program and\nthat participation in our interviews carries no implications for\ntheir treatment or their legal status. We state that this research\ncould potentially inform treatment or prevention programs in\nthe future. In this way, our interviews might have a benefit for\nothers, even if there is no actual benefit to the individual at the\ntime. While we believe in this long-term goal, and our publi-\ncation of research attests to this pursuit, it leaves out some-\nthing important: the experience of the interview itself.\nClassical conceptions of ethnography tended to view the\nresearcher as an objective recorder and analyst of informa-\ntion, if not invisible then at the very least detached (Van\nresearch differs from other social science research methods\nprimarily in that it shrinks the distance between observer and\nobserved, allowing for the greater detection of what he calls\n\"agency effects\" as well as a deeper understanding of the\nindividual, or Verstehen (p. 104).\nAs with other forms of ethnographic research, the goal of\nsuch interviews is to gain insight into the individual's life-\nine understanding of the other person must start out from acts\nof explication performed by the observer on his own lived\nexperience\" (p. 113). In other words, the interview offers a\nview into the participant's interior world, even as that world\nis in the process of evolving.\nArcher's (2003) concept of the internal conversation\noffers another way of thinking about the ethnographic inter-\nview. According to Archer, the internal conversation is a\nmediator between structure and agency, as individuals\nactively reflect upon their social situation and contemplate\ntheir choices and goals. While ethnographic interviews are\nclearly not internal conversations, they are not truly two-\nsided conversations either. As defined by Spradley (1979),\nan ethnographic interview is a particular type of speech\nevent, similar to a friendly conversation but with a number of\ndifferences: turn-taking is less balanced, the conversation\nmay include substantial repetition, and the ethnographer is\nmore likely to express ignorance and interest and to encour-\nage expansion rather than abbreviation. Interviews thus cre-\nate a space in which researchers can gain information through\nan individual's self-presentation. At the same time, those\nindividuals may share their daily life and experience and also\nreflect upon it, engaging in a kind of externalized version of\nan internal conversation, allowing the ethnographer to listen\nin on a conversation, or dialogue, between these various past,\npresent, and potential selves.\nAs proposed by Frank (2010), the truly dialogic interview\nacknowledges the possibility that both parties will change as\na result of the interaction. A dialogic approach implies that\nthe ethnographic interview is about more than the informa-\ntion--cultural, psychological, or otherwise--that is elicited\nfrom, or about, the participant. It is also fundamentally about\nconnection. The \"affective turn\" in the humanities and social\nsciences makes a similar point concerning the two-way flow\nof effects and affects resulting from human interactions.\naffects . . . offer a complex view of causality because the affects\nbelong simultaneously to both sides of the causal relationship.\nThey illuminate . . . both our power to affect the world around us\nand our power to be affected by it, along with the relationship\nbetween these two powers. (p. ix)\nIn the case of the ethnographic interview, the affective\nencounter that occurs between the ethnographer and the\nrespondent is not only a speech event but a physical and emo-\ntional event as well. According to Parr (2010), \"affect is the\ntransitional product of an encounter, specific in its ethical\nand lived dimensions and yet it is also as indefinite as the\nexperience of a sunset, transformation, or ghost\" (p. 11). If\nan interview is truly dialogical, then it is an encounter in\nwhich both participate fully, even if one person is primarily\nlistening and the other is doing most of the talking.\nSetting the Stage: Opening Narrative\nand Reflexive Space\nThe beginning of a qualitative interview serves to foster a safe\nspace of interaction between the interviewer and the individ-\nual participant. Our own interview protocols typically begin\nDraus et al. 3\nthe same way, regardless of the topic that we are investigat-\ning: \"The purpose of this interview is for me to learn from\nyou and your experiences.\" In our interviews with women\nwho had recently engaged in street sex work in Detroit, we\nalways began with an open-ended, stage-setting question,\noften using spatial language, asking participants to tell what\nkind of place they are in, and how they got there. Here is one\nexample of an opening statement to a participant:\nOkay, I would like to begin just by asking you to tell me a little\nbit about your life as it is today, and where you are in your life\nright now. I mean I know where you are physically. But, tell me\na little bit about your life and how you got here.\nThis question invited the individual to actively narrate her\nexperience. For example, a transgender man who had\nrecently been arrested while engaging in street sex work\nresponded this way:\nR: Okay. I basically had like a good upbringing. Nothing too\nspectacular. Um, good home, whatever. There is nothing like\nreally, really different. But basically, the whole reason I started\nlike going out and getting out on the street or whatever, is\nbecause it was an easy way to make money and the whole how I\nstarted--honestly how I started to like smoke the weed, a little\ncoke was basically peer pressure. I started smoking weed with\nmy best friend in the 'hood, then one day, uh, I started dressing\nin drag, and from that, from there on, I noticed how much\nattention I get, how much money I got . . . I was introduced to\ncocaine, the powder, the powder to snort, toot-toot. And um, the\ngirls say it keeps you up, so from then on, it took from one girl\ngiving me a bump to me buying my own 20 sack of powder and\nit just, it progressively got worse and . . . . that is how I ended up\nhere.\nAnother example, from an interview with a woman at a later\nstage in the program, invites a very different accounting or\nnarration.\nR: Um now? I am ah, I am a student. I am in the Culinary\nAcademy. Um, I have a 16-month-old daughter--I am in my--I\nhave been in a long-term relationship--well to me long term is\n3 years, so . . . . But I been going, I been in a relationship going\non 3 years, um . . . Basically I'm, now I'm pretty boring. I-I\ngenerally go to school, come home, spend time with, pick my\ndaughter up from day care. Spend time with her and then get up\nthe next day and do the same thing over again. On the weekends\nI really kinda--stay home or I go visit--friends. You know I\ndon't have any family that lives in the Detroit area, so I spend\nlong conversations on the phone on the weekends with my\nsister--we have coffee--on Sunday morning and talk on the\nphone for like 2 hr. You know, but other than that, I'm really\nboring now.\nIn both of these cases, the individual is using narrative not\nonly to relate information but also to make sense of it. The\nsecond of the two responses above is an act of framing and\ninterpretation as much as it is a recording of facts and details\nconcerning that individual's social context. We see evidence\nof both \"positionalities\" and \"interior worlds\" (Maynes,\nPierce, & Laslett, 2008) in her descriptions of daily life and\nin the assertion that \"I'm really boring now.\" This statement\ncontains an implicit comparison, and the follow-up question\nasks the participant to explicitly compare past phases of her\nlife with the one she is in now:\nIR: Yeah. And how would you compare that--in this sort of\nphase in your life with other phases in your life, other time\nperiods in your life--or other positions you've been in?\nR: I never thought that I would be where I am today--I NEVER\nthought that I would EVER get my act together. I always thought\nthat I would just be on the streets for the rest of my life; I used to\nthink that I actually like the way I lived--I actually like getting\nhigh, I actually like being on the streets; I used to think that.\nHere we see a reflexive dimension opening up within the\ninterview, which now becomes not only a conversation\nbetween an \"ethnographer\" and an \"informant\" but also a\nconversation with previous selves. The narrative that results\nis therefore a complex negotiation, being both a product and\na process, a summation, and an aspiration.\nAccording to Gold (2007), narrative plays a crucial role in\nthe recovery process because it allows people to transform\npast trauma into a useful tool for healing not only them-\nselves, but others as well. Writing about recovery from psy-\nchosis, Gold (2007) states that it \"is an arduous biological,\npsychological, social and spiritual journey--a gradual pro-\ncess of restoring connections and health\" (p. 1272). Going\neven further, Frank (2010) argues that narratives are them-\nselves agents, ushering in new possibilities of thought and\naction. Neurological research suggests that hearing another's\nstory, and having one's own story actually be heard, pro-\nduces neural coupling that is both intimate and automatic\n(Stephens, Silbert, & Hasson, 2010). In other words, a bio-\nlogical response happens on both sides. As researchers\nengaged in active listening, we have experienced this phe-\nnomenon within some very memorable interviews. What we\ndid not realize at the time was how this might also contribute\nto both a state of mindfulness and the recovery process.\nMindfulness and Recovery\nGrabovac, Lau, and Willett (2011) use a Buddhist psycho-\nlogical model to break down the process of moment-by-\nmoment awareness that all human beings experience. First,\nthey state that an individual can be aware of only one object\nat a time. Second, with awareness of any object comes a posi-\ntive, negative, or neutral feeling tone. Third, reactions of\nattachment and aversion arise in response to this feeling state,\nnot to the object itself. Fourth, not being aware of attachment\nand aversion can make this process habitual, which may lead\n4 SAGE Open\nto mental proliferation. Finally, habitual attachment and aver-\nsion and the resulting mental proliferation lead to suffering,\nincluding possible clinical symptoms (see Figure 1).\nIn contrast, they define mindfulness as \"the moment-by-\nmoment observing of the three characteristics (imperma-\nnence, suffering and not-self) of the meditation object\"\n(Grabovac, Lau, & Willett, 2011, p. 4). The model described\nby Grabovac et al. closely parallels the cycle described in a\nsubstance misuse recovery manual by Tighe (1999), who\nprovides a cartoon (Figure 2) showing an individual respond-\ning to an event emotionally, then reacting to the emotion (one\nstep removed from the event).\nSimilarly, Lewis (2011) argues that addiction is a phenome-\nnon that does not fall clearly into the camps of either individual\n\"choice\" or biological \"disease,\" but instead consists of \"a\nsequence of transitory states underlying impulse, reflection and\nemotions that include shame and remorse\" (p. 154).\nRecovery from addiction is closely tied to the recognition\nof this cycle. Bien (2009) states that awareness of the cycle\nmay itself aid in the process of recovery:\nUrges arise or fail to arise, and we are not in control of this\nprocess. Since we are not in control, we deserve neither credit\nnor blame for their occurrence or lack. What matters is how we\nhandle the urge to relapse when it does arise. Though it may\nseem counterintuitive, mindfulness suggests that we are better\noff being aware of the relapse thoughts and feelings when they\narise instead of trying to deny their arising. (p. 294)\nHe continues, \"The most important psychotherapeutic impli-\ncation of mindfulness may lie not so much in techniques to\nFigure 1. Cycle of attachment/aversion and mental proliferation.\nSource. Grabovac, Lau, and Willett (2011).\nDraus et al. 5\nteach clients--though these may be valuable--but in the\ncapacity of the therapist to be truly present\" (p. 296). As an\nexample of this phenomenon, Santorelli (1999) describes a\ngroup meeting in a stress reduction clinic, stating that as indi-\nviduals share their stories of suffering, \"There is a spontane-\nous arising of mindfulness--of awareness cultivated by our\nwillingness to hear one another, to sit together without judg-\nment, without giving advice, without reaching for easy\nanswers or invoking shallow affirmations\" (pp. 12-13).\nRegardless of how the state of mindfulness is achieved,\nresearch suggests that it may reduce stress related to events and\nhave therapeutic effects. Because our ethnographic research\nfocuses on individuals with histories of substance misuse and\ninvolvement in the criminal justice system, we are especially\ninterested in research relating to mindfulness interventions in\nsubstance misuse treatment or recovery programs and correc-\ntional settings. Himelstein (2011) reviewed empirical research\nregarding the effects of mindfulness-based programs on cor-\nrectional populations and found that they contribute to enhance-\nment of psychological well-being and decreases in substance\nuse and recidivism. Howell and Buro (2011) found evidence\nthat the cultivation of mindfulness results in enhanced execu-\ntive processes, better emotion regulation, and less cognitive\nrumination and behavioral avoidance.\nThe following extended passage, from an interview with\na woman in recovery, provides an astute breakdown of what\nshe learned in her treatment program:\nIR: So were there skills that you learned, particular things you\nlearned in terms of about yourself-in analyzing yourself or-or in\nterms of structuring your-your time--skills like that or is it more\nthe sort of the relationships that you had with people there?\nR: Just that I could be better, you know what I'm saying? That I\nwas worth more. You know I-I am not a-I've never-I'm--I don't\nknow how to explain it um--I don't know if you call it like skills\nthat I learned; I just learned to believe in myself. You know what\nI'm saying--that life is better than what--being on the streets or\ngetting high--life is, life is good if you just do the right thing,\nyou know what I'm saying? I-I don't always make the right\ndecisions; even now--I still make stupid decisions, but who\ndoesn't, you know what I'm saying--not everybody does\neverything right.\nIR: Can you, can you think of a time or-or ah moment when\nthat--whenyoubecameawareofthat?Thatyouhadlearnedthat--\nR: When my therapist broke down my arrogance. Because I'm\nvery arrogant and I'm very hard headed--I'm very stubborn and\nI want to do things my way; when she finally got through to\nme--when she had me write this paper on arrogance, um, I\nlooked at and I said--are you serious because I sounded so\nridiculous on the paper. And that's when I finally realized that I\ncan't do things the way I want to do things because the way I do\nthings, I always end up doing something that I shouldn't or that\nat the time sounds great or--but I don't think the whole way\nthrough. I-I live for the now.\nIR: Yeah.\nR: And that's how I used to be, you know what I'm saying; I can\nactually--sit down now and think about things and what the end\noutcome will be.\nIR: Yeah.\nR: Whereas before, I just acted.\nFigure 2. The cycle of event, response, emotion, and behavior.\n6 SAGE Open\nIR: Yeah.\nR: I was a reaction-type person. You know?\nHere, we see an illustration of the concept of mindfulness\nemployed in a therapeutic way--stepping back from the\nmoment, not simply reacting but paying attention to one's\nown reactions and thinking about them. She refers to herself\nas \"living for the now\" and as a \"reaction-type person.\"\nThese statements are actually a contradiction from a mind-\nfulness perspective, because a person who simply reacts usu-\nally does so on the basis of past experiences. However, the\ntherapist's exercise in having the woman narrate her own life\nallowed her to see the reaction process for what it was; in that\nsense, it allowed her to be truly in the moment, aware of what\nwas happening to her, but also aware of how she was\nresponding.\nIn our earliest interviews, a similar moment often occurred\nwhen participants were asked to reflect on the daily routines\nthat characterized life in the street. In these two passages,\ntwo different women describe how this process made them\nfeel:\nPassage 1:\nIR: All right. So we talked a little bit about what your life was\nlike then before you came in here. You know, not just this last\ntime but the time before that. The last thing I want to ask you\nabout is when you think about this life that you've been living\nhere and where do you see for yourself going forward into the\nfuture.\nR: Wow. What I think about this life that I've always lived in is\ncompletely ridiculous. It was exhausting, it's tiring. Not only\nthat but it's also the sickness from not always being, not always,\nyou know, not always having my dope when I need it, you know.\nI would eventually get it, but it might take some time before I\ncould get it and being sick, and it was just hard. So I'm just tired\nof it.\nPassage 2:\nIR: Okay, so based on what we just talked about, what are you\nthinking about now in terms of just like you've already talked\nabout this, but--\nR: That it's a waste. I want more. I want something that stands\nout and goes, \"Wow.\"\nIR: So what do you think you would like to do? I mean what do\nyou see for yourself?\nR: My goal is to stay abstinent . . . abstinent of all drugs. Get a\nhigher education. To stay in treatment, because I got to go for 15\nmonths. I got to go to a 15-month program. So they're going to\nhelp me with my levels. You know, each level I get to, the stage.\nBecause I got a brilliant mind. When my mind starts opening up,\nI'm really smart. I can really think believe or not. When I get on\nthat dope, I'm useless.\nIR: Now, you said though that--so in living this life you were\nliving here, you didn't have much time to think. You didn't\nspend much time thinking about your life?\nR: No. I couldn't even find my brain cells.\nHere, we see that the ethnographic interview may reflect or\nenhance the moment-by-moment awareness that also charac-\nterizes mindfulness. These statements also reflect the under-\nstandings of the recovery process articulated to us by\nnumerous individuals that we met in the course of our\nresearch. For example, a man at a recovery picnic on Belle\nIsle in Detroit told us that recovery involved a process of\nintentional \"mind-mapping.\" While recovery emphasizes an\n"
