Introduction\nAccording to the 2003\u00ad2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) the\nobesity as one of the major lifestyle concerns of the United States [1,2]. Although the prevalence of\noverweight children and adolescents of all ages (2\u00ad19 years) is on the rise, elementary school aged\nchildren (ages 6\u00ad11 years) have the highest prevalence of overweight (18.8%) [1]. Overweight in\nchildren is determined by plotting a child's Body Mass Index (BMI) on a Center for Disease Control\n(CDC) growth chart; children whose BMI is greater than the 95th percentile as compared to children of\nthe same sex and age are considered obese [1]. Currently, the CDC classifies a child as obese at or\nabove the 95th percentile of weight for their age and gender and as overweight if the child is at or\nabove the 85th percentile [3]. Although not all obese infants become overweight children, and not all\noverweight children become obese adults, there is a greater likelihood that obesity beginning in early\nchildhood will persist throughout the life span [4]. In addition to increasing the risk of obesity in\nadulthood, childhood overweight is also the leading cause of pediatric hypertension and is associated\nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus [5]. Obesity also increases the risk of coronary heart disease, places extra\nstress on the weight-bearing joints, and is associated with high incidence of liver disease and\nasthma [6]. Besides these physical effects, being overweight may have deleterious psychological\neffects on children such as: lowering self-esteem; affecting relationships with peers; and, causing\nsocial problems [7].\nEtiologies of childhood overweight include modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Modifiable\ncauses include physical inactivity, sedentary life style, low socioeconomic status, unhealthy eating\nhabits, and environmental factors [8]. Specifically, modifiable risk factors for children include lack of\nregular exercise, high frequency of television viewing or computer usage, low family income,\nnon-working parents, over-consumption of high-calorie foods, snacking while watching television or\ndoing homework, and over-exposure to advertisement of high calorie foods. The common\nnon-modifiable cause of obesity is genetics, with greater risk of obesity found in children of obese and\noverweight parents [9]. Interventions for reducing childhood obesity aimed at modifiable risk factors\nhave been extensively indicated in the literature as key to reversing the detrimental health effects that\nimpact the quality of life in children [11].\nIt is well documented that the number of single-parent households in the United States is rising.\nwhile single-father families increased from less than half a million to 2 million (1% to 6%) within the\nsame time period [11]. One explanation for the increase in single-parent families may be the rise in late\nmarriages, which increases the likelihood of non-marital births, and is also associated with increased\ndivorce rates. The proportion of single-parent homes differ by race and gender whereby 47% of Black\nfemales as compared to 14.4% of White non-Hispanic females and 8.6% Black males as opposed\nto 5.1 % of White, non-Hispanic males reported being the head of a single-parent household\nThere are significant social problems for children and parents associated with single-parent\nhouseholds; these problems include difficulties with role identity for children and social stigma\nassociated with single-parent status. Single parents often experience role strain when balancing the role\nof wage earner with parental responsibilities. Research has indicated that children of single parents are\nless likely to eat at the table together and are permitted to play and watch television during meals [12].\nPoverty has been consistently linked with single-parent households, especially those headed by\nwomen [13]. Children of female-headed households consumed more total fat, saturated fat and\nsweetened beverages as well as had a higher percent of \"more than two hours of television/video\nviewing\" than children of dual family households [10].\nObjectives\nThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association between parental status and\nchildhood overweight. Secondary objectives were to assess dietary and blood cholesterol differences of\nchildren from single or dual households. We hypothesized that in a national population there would be\nhigher obesity rates for children from single-parent households than for children of dual-parent\nhouseholds and that children of single-parent households would consume more calories from fat than\nchildren from dual-family households.\n2. Methodology\nThe NHANES III data-set was appropriate for the study since it facilitated matching children with\ntheir parent's data. The NHANES survey design is a stratified, multistage probability sample of the\ncivilian non-institutionalized U.S. population. Data were extracted from NHANES III during the time\nperiod 1988\u00ad1994, matching parents with children and forming the dataset: Resier I A Files. The\nand 780 with dual-parents. The continuous physical variables analyzed for the children were age, sex,\nrace, height, weight, and BMI. Dietary recall data were collected and included the following:\nconsumption of total energy; carbohydrate; protein; total fat; saturated fat; and, mono/poly unsaturated\nfatty acids. Single dietary recalls were obtained from children but proxy was used by care providers\nand from the school if the children were unable to answer the questions. Children were matched to\ntheir corresponding parents based on family sequence numbers in the adult and youth data files. The\nvariables analyzed for the parents were sex, marital status, level of education, and annual family\nincome. Physical activity of children was not measured by the survey and could not be estimated from\nthe data. Data acquisition of parenthood status by NHANES III allowed us to classify the children as\nliving in a single-parent household if widowed, separated and divorced caretakers were reported.\nMatching of parents and children was not possible in previous years and has not been available in\nsubsequent surveys. All other children were considered to be living in dual-parent households.\n2.2. Anthropometrics\nA systematic, randomly selected, sub-sample from the general NHANES sample was asked to\nparticipate in a more detailed data collection including: measurements of body weight and height;\nfasted blood draw to assess blood cholesterol levels; and, a dietary assessment. An appointment was\nset for health measurements at a local mobile center with trained medical personnel and childcare\nservices were provided during the participants' examination and interview. Respondents agreed to and\nsigned an additional informed consent form. The details of the procedure are available at the NHANES\nwebsite. There are slight variations each year; however, the general procedures are consistent.\nThough BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2) in adults, a different method is applied for\nchildren, which further classifies them based on age and sex. According to the CDC definition,\nchildren whose BMI is greater than the 95th percentile are considered obese and children whose BMI\nrange between the 85th and 95th percentile are classified as overweight [3]. Children with BMI\nbetween the 5th and 85th percentile are categorized as normal weight and children less than\nthe 5th percentile are considered underweight. The criteria for weight status of different age groups are\ngiven in Table 1.\nTable 1. BMI corresponding to different age groups, sex, and BMI Percentile (%).\nAge (years)\nMale Female Male Female Male Female\n* BMI number is plotted on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts (for either girls or boys) to obtain a\npercentile ranking.\n2.3. Dietary Assessment Methods\nThe detailed dietary recall method used by NHANES was a 24 hour recall. Trained interviewers\nusing computer-assisted dietary software asked participants (in English or Spanish) questions\nregarding what they ate and drank for a complete day from midnight to midnight. Translators were\navailable and questions could be answered by proxy. Visual aids, charts and graphs were used by the\nparticipant to recall the type or brand of food/beverage and the quantity. The interviewer recorded the\nconversation for transcription purposes and the process usually took between 15 and 30 minutes. An\nadditional 10% of participants were telephoned for an additional 24 hour recall interview either in\nperson or by telephone to improve validity. From the 24 hour recalls, total calorie, protein,\ncarbohydrate and fat consumed per day per person could be assessed.\n2.4. Primary Outcome Variable\nFor our study, the variable, BMI was chosen as the primary indicator of obesity because it is\nconsidered an appropriate indicator of body fatness. A binary variable for obesity (95th percentile)\nversus other was computed for logistic regression models with single parent as the primary predictor\nand age, parental education, family annual income and race as covariates.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated to determine the percentage of overweight children by sex and\nparental status. The two groups were normally distributed and had approximately equal variances of\ntheir Body Mass Index which was verified by Levine's test. The two groups were independent of each\nother. The association of parental status and childhood overweight was evaluated by comparing mean\nBMI, dietary recall data, and blood parameters between the children of single- and dual-parent\nhouseholds. Statistical analyses were performed with independent sample t-tests of the two groups,\ncomparing the BMI and dietary recall data among the children living in single- and dual-parent\nhouseholds. Statistical analysis was performed using an independent sample t-test to compare the\nmeans of variables including: BMI; dietary intake; and, blood parameters among the various age\ngroups for children of single- and dual-parent households. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nwas performed to compare the BMI status of children of different races for single-parent households.\nTo test the association of obesity and parental status, logistic regression models were run with obesity\nversus no obesity as the dependent variable, single-parent household as the independent variable and\nage, income race and education as the covariates. The final sampling weight and Taylor's linearization\nmethods were used for variance estimation to account for multistage stratified cluster design.\nStatistical analyses were conducted using Stata 10.0 SE and the Strata database was imported\ninto SPSS version 18 for the logistic regression analyses. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was\nconsidered significant.\n3. Results and Discussion\nChildren of single-parent (N = 219) and dual-parent (N = 780) households were almost equally\ndistributed by sex. However, the proportion of overweight children from single-parent households\n(41%) was more than children from dual parent households (31%) (Table 2).\nTable 2.

Children from dual parent\nhouseholds had significantly (p < 0.01) lower BMI (19.2 \u00b1 5.4) than children of single-parent\nhouseholds (21.5 \u00b16.5). Total caloric intake was marginally significant (p < 0.06) between children of\nalso higher in children of single-parent household (91 \u00b1 1.5) compare to children of dual parent\nhousehold (88 \u00b11.4; p < 0.05). Total fat and saturated fat intakes (g/day) were higher (p < 0.05) in\nchildren of single-parent households (9.1 \u00b1 6.2; 3.3 \u00b1 1.0) than children of dual-parent households\nTable 3.

Model 1 tested the likelihood of being a single\nparent with child obesity. Model 2 included child's age and parental education level and was the best\nmodel. Model 3 added race and income as covariates and was not better than model two (Table 5).\nTable 5.

Cont.\nAnnual Family Income Beta SE OR P\nThis study found that children from single-parent households tend to be more overweight than\nchildren from dual-parent households. These results are in opposition to an obesity study of matched\nchildren and parents (N = 600 children) randomly selected from two community and two hospital\nclinics in New Haven, CT [14]. The investigators found lower obesity rate for children living with\ngrandparents or in foster care than for either dual- or single-household parents [14]. However, the\nresults of our study are in accordance with an earlier epidemiological study of the American family\nand childhood obesity trends [15], a home environment and childhood obesity national longitudinal\nstudy [16] as well as population trends from the United States Census as reported from the US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and several other studies [17-20].\nNumerous studies regarding parental factors such as hours of maternal employment and parents'\nBMI influencing childhood obesity indicated dietary intake was a confounder and should be\nconsidered in future studies. Our results indicated a higher total fat intake for children from\nsingle-parent households as opposed to those from dual family households. The results of a consumer\nexpenditure survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of approximately 7,500 households\nindicated that fewer vegetables were purchased by single-parent households (single father or mother)\nas compared to dual-parent households [20]. Although not causal, these findings suggest a likelihood\nof higher consumption of dietary fat by children of single- as opposed to dual-parent households since\nthere has been an established negative association of vegetable intake with dietary fat intake [20].\nDespite the established positive association of dietary fat and obesity, not all children are diagnosed or\ntreated and those who are treated often receive general dietary advice rather than family counseling\naimed at developing appropriate strategies [14].\nOur findings of significantly higher cholesterol levels and lower HDL (higher LDL) levels in\nchildren from single-parent households may have public health implications. According to current\ndietary guidelines for children and adolescents, the association between hyperlipidemia and childhood\nobesity has been well-established [21]. Elevated LDL levels in children, even in the absence of obesity,\nplace them at elevated risk for CVD, hypertension and type 2 diabetes [5,6,21]. Obesity and high blood\ncholesterol may be the outcome of increased consumption of packaged and convenience foods by\nsingle-parent or dual-working parent households [22].\nOur results indicate that Black children from single-parent households had significantly higher BMI\nas compared to White children. Federal reports indicate that the ratio of overweight children\nages 6\u00ad11 years old in 2003 was significantly higher for African American girls (1.6) as compared to\ngreater risk of being overweight than non-Hispanic White females [23].\n3.2. Strengths and Limitations\nA major strength of this study was that the subjects were randomly selected through a national data\nset which identified persons by race and matched parents with children. The sample size was\nconsiderably large and represents all children in United States. There has been an increase in the\nnumber of single-parent households in the United States since this study data were collected\n(1988\u00ad1994). Incidence of obesity and overweight has also been increasing exponentially among\nchildren. Subsequent NHANES datasets do not include enough information to match children with\ntheir parents in order that single-parent or dual parent status can be determined. Therefore, our study is\na timely analysis of parental household factors in childhood obesity using the most current national\ndata matching children and parents.\nSeveral limitations of this study need to be noted. First, the study was a cross-sectional analysis and\ndoes not establish the temporal relationship between parenthood status and obesity in childhood;\nhence, causal relationships cannot be established. The dataset did not allow for analysis of\nsingle-parent households headed by gender; however, based on census statistics, most single-parent\nhouseholds are reportedly headed by females (76%) [11]. On the other hand, there is data indicating\nthat single-parent households headed by males have been increasing in recent years, 26% of all\nsingle-family households were headed by males [11]. Since food allocations differed by gender with\nrespect to single-parent homes [20], it would be of interest to study whether or not there would be any\ndietary or clinical differences, between the children from single-parent households headed by men\nversus women. Another potential limitation was that the data did not include information about the\nlength of time since divorce or separation which could play an important role in the development of\nobesity. Although dietary recall was conducted with a trained interviewer and with a standardized\nprotocol, the information was self-reported and may have subject-bias. We did not account for the\neffect of genetics and physical activity which are associated with obesity among children. Mexican\nAmericans were distinguished from other ethnicities only for certain variables and Hispanics could\nhave chosen to classify themselves as either Black or White. Physical activity was not measured by\nNHANES for the dataset of matched parents with children. This is perhaps the most serious limitation\nof the study. Physical activity level is a major component of energy expenditure and is strongly\nassociated with obesity.\n4. Conclusions\nOur results indicate a positive relationship between single-parent status and excess weight in\nchildren. There were racial differences in body weight (Black children had higher BMI than White\nchildren); however, low family income was not significantly associated with children being overweight\nin a single-parent to dual parent household-comparison. Children from single-parent households\nconsumed more calories and fat than children from dual-parent households. Blood cholesterol was\npositively associated with BMI and both are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Our findings\nsuggest single-parent households may have cultural and social factors contributing to excess weight\ngain and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Since single-parent households are increasing, further\nstudies are needed to explore the dynamics of single-parent households and its influence on childhood\nobesity. Despite the fact that parents are central to successful community and school based obesity\ninterventions, they have not been included in the development or design of these programs [22].\nInterventions in the schools involving parents and children in the preparation of convenient and\nhealthy meals taking into consideration household status, economic constraints and cultural\npreferences are warranted.\n"
