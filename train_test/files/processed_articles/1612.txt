Colonization by pre-\ndominantly gram-negative bacteria arising\nfrom dental plaque stimulates an inflamma-\ntory response that in some individuals, results\nin the breakdown of the connective tissue\nsurrounding teeth (Preshaw et al. 2004).\nPeriodontal disease can lead to tooth loss in\nadults and has been linked to a number of\nsystemic disorders such as cardiovascular dis-\nease, stroke, and preterm birth (Pihlstrom\net al. 2005). Although environmental factors\nhave been implicated as possible risk factors\nrole of environmental toxins in the etiology of\nthis disease has received limited attention.\nCadmium is a ubiquitous toxicant in our\nenvironment, and an estimated 2.3% of the\nU.S. population has elevated levels of urine\ncadmium (> 2 \u00b5g/g creatinine), a marker of\nchronic exposure and body burden (Paschal\net al. 2000). Human exposure to Cd is pos-\nsible from a number of sources, with smok-\ning being a major contributor (Paschal et al.\n2000). Other sources of Cd include emissions\nfrom industrial activities, including min-\ning, smelting, and manufacturing of batter-\nies, pigments, stabilizers, and alloys [Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\n(ATSDR) 2008]. Cadmium is also present in\ntrace amounts in certain foods such as leafy\nvegetables, potatoes, grains and seeds, liver and\nkidney, and crustaceans and mollusks (Satarug\net al. 2003). Once in the body, Cd accumu-\nlates in the kidney and liver and is excreted\nThe pathologic effects of Cd on bone,\nincluding the ability to promote inflamma-\ntion, are pertinent to periodontal disease,\nwhere disruption of the host inflammatory\nresponse is considered a primary factor in\ndisease progression and subsequent alveolar\nbone loss. The adverse effects of Cd expo-\nsure on bone are well established (J\u00e4rup\nlogic studies have documented an associa-\ntion of chronic low-level Cd exposure with\ndecreases in bone mineral density (BMD)\nand osteoporosis (\u00c5kesson et al. 2006; Alfv\u00e9n\n1999). Data from experimental models sug-\ngest that Cd disrupts the bone remodeling\nprocess, decreases skeletal mineralization, and\nenhances bone loss (Brz\u00f3ska and Moniuszko-\nJakoniuk 2004). Cadmium exposure has also\nbeen shown to stimulate, in a number of cell\ntypes and tissues, the production of pros-\ntanoids (e.g., prostaglandin E2), cytokines\n[e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-\n(TNF-)], and matrix metalloproteinases\nBased on this evidence, our hypothesis\nwas that, because of its ability to promote\ninflammation and affect the bone remodel-\ning process, environmental Cd exposure may\nbe associated with periodontal disease. We\nused data from the third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII), a nationally representative survey con-\nUnited States.

Cadmium adversely affects\nbone remodeling, and it is therefore possible that environmental Cd exposure may be a risk factor\nfor periodontal-disease\u00adrelated bone loss.\nObjective: We examined the relationship between environmental Cd exposure and perio\ndontal\ndisease in U.S. adults.\nMethods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III). We defined periodontal disease as clinical attachment loss of at\nleast 4 mm in > 10% of sites examined. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses\nto estimate the association between creatinine-corrected urinary Cd levels and periodontal disease.\nResults: Of the 11,412 participants included in this study, 15.4% had periodontal disease. The age-\nadjusted geometric mean urine Cd concentration (micrograms per gram creatinine) was significantly\nanalyses, which included extensive adjustments for tobacco exposure, showed that a 3-fold increase\nin creatinine-corrected urinary Cd concentrations [corresponding to an increment from the 25th\nsubset of participants who had limited exposure to tobacco, but only after removing six influential\nobservations.\nConclusion: Environmental Cd exposure was associated with higher odds of periodontal disease.\nKey words: environmental tobacco smoke, NHANES III, periodontal disease, smoking, urine\nArora et al.\nbiomarker of exposure to ETS; n = 1,555).\nWe further excluded pregnant (n = 264) and\nbreast-feeding women (n = 100) to avoid the\neffects of increased bone remodeling and also\ntransient changes to periodontal tissues during\nthese periods (Kalkwarf and Specker 2002;\nUrine Cd and creatinine measurements.\nDetails of the urine collection and Cd analysis\nhave been reported previously (Paschal et al.\n2000). Briefly, during the physical examina-\ntion, a 10-mL spot sample of urine was col-\nlected from survey participants. Cadmium was\nquantified by Zeeman effect graphite furnace\natomic absorption spectrophotometry with\na detection limit of approximately 0.01 ng/\nmL (NCHS 2006). Each sample was analyzed\nin duplicate, and mean measurements were\nreported. Specimens with Cd concentrations\n> 6 ng/mL were reanalyzed for confirmation\n(Paschal et al. 2000). We used creatinine-\ncorrected urine Cd concentrations (micrograms\nCd per gram of creatinine) in our analyses.\nPeriodontal examination. Details of the\nperiodontal examinations have been previ-\nously described (Westat, Inc. 1992). Briefly,\nsix trained and calibrated dentists examined a\nmaximum of seven teeth of the upper jaw in\na randomly selected half-mouth (quadrant).\nSimilarly, a maximum of seven lower teeth\nwere also examined in a randomly selected\nlower quadrant, giving a maximum possible\ntotal of 14 teeth examined per participant.\nClinical measurements of periodontal disease\nwere done at two sites (mesiobuccal and buc-\ncal) for each tooth. We focused our analysis on\nclinical attachment loss, which is a measure of\nthe amount of periodontal tissue lost because\nof the disease process. In NHANES III, clini-\ncal attachment loss was the distance from the\ncementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the base of\nthe sulcus measured (in millimeters) using a\nNational Institute of Dental   (NIDR)\nperiodontal probe (Figure 1). We calculated\nthis distance by subtracting from the pocket\ndepth, the distance from the gingival mar-\ngin to the CEJ. We used a case definition of\nperiodontitis as attachment loss of  4 mm in\n> 10% of sites examined.\nAssessment of tobacco exposure. Because\ncigarette smoke is a major source of Cd in U.S.\nadults (Paschal et al. 2000) and is also associated\nwith an increased risk of periodontal disease\n(Tomar and Asma 2000), we considered it an\nimportant potential confounder of any observed\nassociation between Cd exposure and periodon-\ntal disease. We incorporated into our study two\nassessments of cigarette smoking. First, we used\nserum cotinine, a biomarker of both active and\npassive exposure to cigarette smoke. Serum coti-\nnine was measured using isotope-dilution liquid\nchromatography with tandem mass spectrom-\netry (Bernert et al. 1997), with a limit of detec-\nused pack-years of cigarette smoking, calculated\nby multiplying the reported average number of\ncigarettes smoked daily by the reported number\nof years smoked and dividing this product by\n20 (cigarettes per pack). In addition to ciga-\nrette smoking, we used questionnaire-recorded\nresponses to categorize participants as never,\npast, or current users of chewing tobacco, pipes,\nand cigars. To estimate ETS exposure, we used,\nin addition to serum cotinine, the response to a\nquestionnaire item: \"At work, how many hours\nper day are you close enough to people who\nsmoke so that you can smell the smoke?\" To\naccount for potential exposure to ETS at home,\nwe included the number of smokers at the par-\nticipant's home (0 vs.  1) in our analyses.\nDiabetes, BMD, and urinary albumin\nmeasurements. We included in our analy-\nses certain systemic conditions that may\nbe potential confounders because of their\nreported associations with both Cd expo-\nsure and periodontal disease. We classified a\nparticipant as having type 2 diabetes if he or\nshe reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes\n(other than during pregnancy), reported tak-\ning prescription medications (either insulin\nor oral agents) for diabetes, had a nonfasting\nhad a fasting plasma glucose  7.0 mmol/L\n(126 mg/dL), or had a glycosylated hemoglo-\nbin (HbA1c\n) measurement > 6.1% (Perlstein\nBecause studies have previously reported\nassociations between osteoporosis and peri-\nodontal disease (Wactawski-Wende 2001), we\nalso included in our analyses total hip BMD\nmeasurements to adjust for osteopenia and\nosteoporosis. NHANES III measured BMD\nusing a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\nMA, USA), and verified data quality in a\nquality control program (Wahner et al. 1994).\nUrinary albumin concentrations were meas\nured using a solid-phase fluorescent immuno-\nassay (Gunter et al. 1996). Urinary albumin\nconcentrations were dichotomized at 30 \u00b5g/\nmL because concentrations above this level are\nconsidered indicative of renal damage (Paschal\nStatistical analysis. We examined sum-\nmary statistics and scatter plots for key vari-\nables to identify outliers. We also studied\nage-adjusted geometric mean urine Cd con-\ncentrations [age standardized to the 2000\nU.S. census population using age categories\nSchoenborn 2001)] and periodontitis within\nkey subject characteristics. Subsequently, we\nused multivariable-adjusted logistic regression\nto estimate the prevalence odds ratio (OR) of\nhaving periodontal disease for increments in\nloge\n-transformed, creatinine-corrected urinary\nCd concentration. We report our results as\nORs for a 3-fold increase in urinary Cd [i.e.,\nexp(\n^\nloge[Cd]\n\u00d7 ln[3])], which corresponds to\nan increment in urine Cd concentration from\nthe 25th to the 75th percentile. The principal\nmodels incorporated variables previously asso-\nciated with periodontal disease, including age\n(years), sex, education of head of household\n(< high school, some high school, or > high\nschool), ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, other),\nhousehold income ( 100% of federal poverty\nline or < 100% of federal poverty line), serum\ncotinine (nanograms per milliliter), cigarette\nchewing tobacco (never, past, current user),\npipe smoking (never, past, current user), cigar\nsmoking (never, past, current user), number of\nsmokers at home (0 vs.  1), exposure to ETS\nat work (yes vs. no), number of teeth missing,\nBMD (grams per square centimeters), urine\nalbumin ( 30 \u00b5g/mL vs. > 30 \u00b5g/mL), blood\nlead level (micrograms per deciliter), and type\n2 diabetes (yes vs. no). We included survey\nphase and examiner identification numbers\n(coded 1 to 6) in the model to adjust for dif-\nferences between survey phases and variations\nin the measurements of periodontitis (Slade\nWe were concerned that the observed\nassociation between Cd and periodontal dis-\nease may be confounded by active or passive\nexposure to tobacco.

Furthermore,\nwe were also concerned that the markers of\nsystemic conditions (diabetes, BMD, urinary\nalbumin) we included in our analyses may\nnot be confounders but rather intermediates\nFigure 1.

Blood lead has\npreviously been associated with periodontal\ndisease, so we undertook analyses restricted\nto participants with blood lead concentra-\ntions < 3 \u00b5g/dL, which was the median\nblood lead concentration in our participants.\nFor all data analyses, we used SAS version\n9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)\nand accounted for the complex multistage\nsampling design of NHANES III.

In examin-\ning this association, we adjusted for smoking\nand several other established risk factors for\nperiodontal disease that may potentially con-\nfound its observed relation to Cd exposure.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nepidemiologic study to report on the potential\nassociation between environmental Cd expo-\nsure and periodontal disease in U.S. adults.\nOur findings are supported by the known\neffects of Cd exposure on bone and other tis-\nsues. Chronic low-level Cd exposure has been\nlinked to decreased BMD and osteoporosis in\na number of epidemiologic studies (\u00c5kesson\nbeen confirmed in animal experiments where\nadministration of low levels of Cd over peri-\nods of up to 24 months resulted in decreased\nBMD and increased incidence of osteoporosis\n(Brz\u00f3ska and Moniuszko-Jakoniuk 2004). In\nthese experiments, the serum concentration\nof cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen\n(a marker of bone resorption) was increased\nwhereas the activity of serum alkaline phos-\nphatase (a marker of bone formation) was\ndecreased, indicating a disturbance of nor-\nmal bone metabolism due to Cd exposure.\nData from a number of laboratory experi-\nments suggest that inflammatory mediators,\nsuch as prostanoids, cytokines, and MMP,\nmay be responsible for these effects. In vitro\nexperiments have shown that Cd exposure\nstimulates the production of prostaglandin\nSimilarly, Cd promotes the release of calcium\nfrom organ cultures of neonatal mouse calva-\nria, and this effect is dependent on the induc-\ntion of the prostaglandin-synthesizing enzyme\ncyclooxygenase-2 (Romare and Lundholm\n1999). The effects of Cd on cytokines appear\nto be dose dependent such that low concen-\ntrations of Cd increase the release of cytokines\n(e.g., interleukin-1 and TNF-), but at higher\nconcentrations this effect is less prominent\nThe available evidence thus suggests that\nCd may further aggravate disturbances in the\nbone remodeling process that are present in\nperiodontal disease. Periodontal disease is\ncaused by accumulation of plaque bacteria in\nthe gingival sulcus and subsequent release of\nlipopolysaccharide and microbial peptides that\nelicit a host inflammatory response (Preshaw\net al. 2004). With advancing disease, there\nis destruction of periodontal ligament and\nloss of attachment caused primarily by host-\nderived enzymes (MMP) and inflammatory\nmediators (prostaglandins and cytokines).\nThe latter are also responsible for the stimula-\ntion of osteoclasts, which leads to resorption\nof alveolar bone. Given the important role\nof inflammation in periodontal disease, it is\nplausible that environmental factors, such as\nexposure to Cd, that stimulate the release of\ninflammatory mediators may contribute to\nperiodontal-disease\u00adrelated tissue destruction.\nTable 2.

We also did not adjust for missing teeth in this\nanalysis because tooth loss may be a consequence of periodontal disease rather than a confounder.\nCadmium and periodontal disease\nTobacco smoke contains many chemi-\ncals that may elevate the risk for periodontal\ndisease (Barbour et al. 1997), and it is also a\nmajor source of Cd exposure in U.S. adults\n(Paschal et al. 2000). We therefore placed\nparticular emphasis on distinguishing the\nrelationship between Cd and periodontitis\nfrom the effects of smoking. We adjusted\nour analy\nses for cigarette smoking using\nself-reported smoking behavior and serum\ncotinine, a biomarker of exposure to tobacco\nsmoke. We also used questionnaire-recorded\nresponses to identify participants with expo-\nsure to cigarette smoke in their home and\nwork environment. The relationship between\ncreatinine-corrected urinary Cd and peri-\nodontal disease remained significant after we\nintroduced these variables into our multi-\nvariable-adjusted logistic regression model.\nWithout the inclusion of all tobacco variables\nin our analyses, the association between uri-\nnary Cd and periodontal disease was nota-\nbly stronger than that reported in Table 2,\nconfirming the importance of tobacco expo-\nsure in our study. Furthermore, we were con-\ncerned that tobacco exposure may contain\nseveral risk factors for periodontal disease that\nmay partially \"compete\" with Cd, obscur-\ning the observed association between Cd and\nperiodontal disease among tobacco users and\nthose exposed to high levels of ETS. It is pos-\nsible that, among these individuals, other con-\nstituents of tobacco smoke may promote the\ndevelopment of periodontal disease to such an\nextent that Cd exposure no longer has a sub-\nstantial impact on risk. We therefore under-\ntook separate analyses among participants\nwith very low tobacco exposure and found\nthat the relationship between urinary Cd con-\ncentrations and periodontal disease was stron-\nger in this group than among our full study\npopulation. However, this association was\nstrongly influenced by six observations that\nmarkedly affected the parameter estimates for\nthe Cd variable in our regression analyses. We\ntherefore recommend caution in interpreting\nthe association between Cd and periodontal\ndisease observed in low-tobacco\u00adexposed par-\nticipants because this was statistically signifi-\ncant only upon removal of three influential\npoints (and we also excluded three additional\noutliers). Although these observations repre-\nsent a small proportion of cases in the low-\ntobacco\u00adexposed subgroup [see Supplemental\nMaterial for details (http://www.ehponline.\nis plausible that some residual confounding\nby tobacco exposure remained in our analyses\nand accounts for some or all of the association\nbetween Cd and periodontal disease.\nEnvironmental lead exposure was also a\npotentially important confounder in our study\nbecause blood lead levels have been associated\nwith periodontal-disease\u00adrelated bone loss in\nthis population (Dye et al. 2002; Saraiva et al.\n2007). Furthermore, lead exposure has been\nlinked with increased expression of MMP-9\n(Barbosa et al. 2006), a protease that is also\nelevated in periodontal disease (S\u00f6der et al. in\npress). In addition to adjusting for blood lead\nconcentrations in our main analyses, we under-\ntook additional analyses restricted to partici-\npants with blood lead concentrations < 3 \u00b5g/dL\nand found that the association between urine\nCd and periodontal disease was stronger.\nThe present study is limited primarily\nby its cross-sectional design, which prevents\nus from establishing a temporal relationship\nbetween Cd exposure and periodontal dis-\nease. However, the use of urinary Cd, which\nis a marker of long-term exposure, allowed\nus to consider the effects of Cd exposure over\nperiods on the order of a decade or longer\n(Lauwerys et al. 1994). Furthermore, it is\nunlikely that reverse causality (periodontal dis-\nease affecting levels of Cd in urine) is responsi-\nble for the observed findings. In cross-sectional\nstudies that include older adults, as this one\ndoes, survival to be in the cohort may be influ-\nenced by the exposure of interest; if Cd expo-\nsure increases the risk of mortality (Nawrot\net al. 2008), any resulting bias in our findings\nwould likely be toward under\nestimating Cd's\nassociation with periodontal disease. Although\nour study is strengthened by a large sample size\nand the use of detailed measures of a number\nof important covariates, including exposure to\ntobacco smoke, unmeasured or mismeasured\nvariables may have confounded the observed\nassociation between environmental Cd expo-\nsure and periodontal disease.\nWidespread exposure and increasing\nevidence of systemic health effects at levels\npreviously considered unimportant make envi-\nronmental Cd exposure a significant public\nhealth issue. Although information on the oral\nhealth effects of this toxicant remains limited,\nour results suggest that Cd exposure may be an\nimportant risk factor for periodontal disease in\nadults. Prospective epidemiologic studies and\ncontrolled animal experiments are needed to\nconfirm and elucidate the mechanisms behind\nthe findings of this study.\nReferences\n\u00c5kesson A, Bjellerup P, Lundh T, Lidfeldt J, Nerbrand C,\nSamsioe G, et al. 2006.
