    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Many persons with serious psychiatric conditions who could benefit from\navailable treatments do not receive care, and the barriers are generally understood to be\nlimited knowledge, inadequacies in insurance coverage, and stigma. Sophisticated ap-\nproaches are needed to realistically eliminate these and other barriers. Public policy should\nfocus on criteria for need for care and encourage interventions that facilitate treatment\nwhen it can be helpful. Appropriate insurance coverage is indispensable, and achieving\nmental health parity will require careful management of care. Policymakers must help to\ncreate a trustworthy management structure that is inclusive, that develops and dissemi-\nnates models of best practice, that encourages evidence-based decision processes, and\nthat ensures continuing dialogue and procedural fairness in managed care decision making.\nThe gap between the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the U.S.\npopulation and the provision of appropriate care is increasingly viewed as a\nmajor public health issue.1 Much effort is now being given to understanding\nand eliminating barriers to care, to informing the public about available treat-\nments, and to motivating primary care physicians to recognize and treat these con-\nditions.2 Many now recognize that lack of insurance coverage, stigma, and inade-\nquate public information contribute to this gap between prevalence and care, but\na more complete understanding is needed for the sophisticated design of success-\nful programs. This paper presents a model that takes account of each stage of the\nhelp-seeking process and suggests targeted points of intervention relevant to\nmeeting needs in an evidence-based and efficient way.\nRecognizing symptoms and seeking care are part of an iterative sequence in\nwhich persons become aware of changes in how they feel, assess the effects and\nmagnitude of these changes, attribute meaning to them, decide whether they have\na problem, assess the nature of the problem, calculate whether the problem would\nbenefit from intervention, decide to pursue intervention, assess whether formal\nB a r r i e r s T o C a r e\nDavidMechanicistheRen\u00e9DubosProfessorofBehavioralSciencesanddirectoroftheInstituteforHealth,\nHealthCarePolicy,andAgingResearchatRutgersUniversityinNewBrunswick,NewJersey.\n\u00a92002 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Most surveys cannot capture the richness of the experi-\nence of interpreting meanings and making attributions, nor can they disentangle\nthe web of interconnections involved in such decision making. Studies that have\naddressed the sequential nature of the help-seeking process generally find that in-\nfluences vary at different points in the illness interpretation and help-seeking\nRecent Surveys Of Reported Symptoms And Care\nI briefly review three nationally representative studies to provide some insight\ninto barriers to care among persons who report symptoms and limitations that\nmight signify a need. The most recent is a telephone survey conducted in 2001 for\nthe National Mental Health Association (NMHA) of 3,239 adults age eighteen and\nolder. Respondents to this survey (known as NMHAS) were screened using a va-\nriety of questions on depression and anxiety; 1,319 respondents were interviewed\nin greater depth, including 999 with symptoms of clinical depression or general-\nized anxiety disorder or both and 320 who were judged to be asymptomatic.5 I\nalso use reports from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a face-to-face sur-\nsessed the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third\nEdition, Revised (DSM-III-R) disorders among persons ages fifteen to fifty-four.\nFurther, I report findings from the Healthcare for Communities (HCC) study, a\nthe survey component I examine here was conducted for the purpose of tracking\nalcohol, drug, and mental health services use.7\nEach of these surveys is cross-sectional, so they all are limited in representing\nthe sequential help-seeking process. All three agree, however, that large propor-\ntions of the population who have symptoms indicative of a possible mental illness\nreceive no care for this problem. Ronald Kessler and his colleagues, for example,\nfound that only 46 percent of respondents who met their criteria for a twelve-\nmonth serious mental illness (a DSM disorder associated with measured impair-\nment) received professional treatment for their emotional problem in the prior\ntwelve months.8 Donna McAlpine and I have reported that in the HCC almost\nthree-fifths of persons with a severe mental illness did not receive any specialty\nmental health care.9 Similarly, the NMHAS reported that while almost a third of\nthe adults surveyed had symptoms indicative of clinical depression or generalized\nanxiety disorder, only 18 percent of these respondents received a doctor's diagno-\nsis for those symptoms. In each of these surveys, the proportions of persons receiv-\ning treatment can be greatly enlarged by adding additional comorbidities to the\nM e n t a l H e a l t h\n1 3 8 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For example, Ramin Mojtabai and colleagues, using the NCS, re-\nported that while only 13 percent of persons with only a mood disorder sought\nmental health specialty care in the prior twelve months, 25 percent who had a\ncombination of mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders sought such care.10\nHow People Explain Not Seeking Help\nThe structured population surveys that measure disorders limit respondents'\nleeway to explain themselves. Thus, we must reconstruct respondents' motiva-\ntions from how they responded to the reasons for not seeking care provided by the\nsurvey instruments used.\nIn the NCS only 32 percent of the 1,792 respondents who had a twelve-month\ndisorder sought professional help of any kind or perceived a need for such help.\nSimilarly, only 18 percent of respondents in the NMHAS who had symptoms char-\nacteristic of major depression or generalized anxiety disorder had received a diag-\nnosis from a doctor. Less than one-tenth of the undiagnosed group believed that\ntheir symptoms meant that they had a mental disorder, and more than half of those\nwith a doctor's diagnosis also did not agree. The stigma associated with the term\nmentaldisorder is an important barrier; even patients commonly treated in inpatient\nunits reject this characterization of their problem.11 Persons with a serious mental\nillness who deny that their problem is a \"mental illness\" report more positive so-\ncial relations and a higher quality of life. Much of the negative effect of defining\none's problems as a mental illness is explained by perceived stigma, lower self-\nesteem, and depressive symptomatology.12 Beyond diagnosis and impairment,\nother factors associated with perceiving a need for professional care in\nmultivariate analyses include a positive attitude toward seeking mental health\ncare, marital disruption, being female, having comorbid physical conditions, hav-\ning a history of maternal psychopathology, and having insurance coverage.13\nIn the NMHAS, undiagnosed respondents who reported that they would not\nseek a doctor's assistance for symptoms such as those covered by the survey were\nasked to respond to various possible reasons.14 The largest group, 44 percent, re-\nsponded \"not serious, I can handle it.\" The second largest group, 28 percent, re-\nported having limited or no insurance, and another 18 percent reported being \"too\nbusy to see a mental health professional.\" While the items did not adequately cap-\nture issues related to stigma, the item \"don't want a record of having sought care\"\nwas only cited by 5 percent of this group. About one-tenth of respondents re-\nported fear of having to take medications or not knowing of a doctor to go to.\nIn the NCS Kessler and colleagues also report that of those with twelve-month\nserious mental illness, 55 percent did not believe that they had a problem that re-\nquired treatment.15 The majority of those who did not seek treatment also re-\nported that they wanted to solve the problem on their own (72 percent) or\nthought that the problem would get better by itself (61 percent).

Other frequent re-\nsponses included being unsure about where to go for help (41 percent), feeling\nthat seeking help takes too much time or is inconvenient (28 percent), and various\nresponses indicating perceived lack of treatment effectiveness (45 percent).\nThese lists of reasons provide some useful information but fail to accurately\nconvey the complexity of people's thought processes as they try to make sense of\ntheir symptoms, decide what to do about them, and then rationalize their deci-\nsions. Consider a person who has a serious disorder that somewhat limits activi-\nties and who perceives that treatment might be helpful. However, lacking insur-\nance coverage and having competing wants and needs for use of available\nresources, such persons might decide that they want to solve the problem on their\nown and that the problem is likely to go away by itself eventually anyway. Thus,\nthey might be willing to delay care and observe the course of their distress.\nThe decision process itself is likely to be sequential, during which persons mon-\nitor their symptoms, determine the extent to which they get better or worse, and,\ndepending on the seriousness and course of the symptoms, may periodically re-\nevaluate their decision. Encouragement or coercion from friends and family or\nfrom a primary care physician also may influence the decision process.16 Also, per-\nsons who know other users of mental health services or who are part of larger net-\nworks of \"friends and supporters\" of mental health services use are more likely to\nenter pathways of care.17 At any point, reevaluations of the need for treatment may\nbe weighed against other economic and family needs, and insurance may play a\nlarger role than is apparent. Economic studies conducted prior to the widespread\nuse of managed behavioral health care found that the use of psychiatric services\nwas more responsive to insurance coverage than was the case with other medical\nservices.18 It seems plausible that managed care has modified this pattern by ag-\ngressive utilization management of mental health care use, but direct evidence on\nthis issue is not available.\nCorrelates Of Care-Seeking Stages\nNumerous studies have observed that different factors affect various stages of\nthe help-seeking process. As Mojtabai and colleagues found, the magnitude and\nseverity of symptoms and limitations are the most important predictors of recog-\nnition of a need for professional help.19 However, only 59 percent of those who per-\nceived such a need sought help, and none of the psychiatric variables of impor-\ntance in the recognition process was statistically significant at this next stage.\nInstead, having a positive attitude toward seeking mental health care, being in the\n45\u00ad54 age group, and reporting a physical condition were associated with acting\non one's perceived need. The insurance measure available in this study was poor,\nbut there was a tendency for those with insurance coverage other than Medicaid\nM e n t a l H e a l t h\n1 4 0 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Positive attitudes toward professional help\nand insurance coverage also increased the likelihood of selecting mental health\nspecialty care. These findings are consistent with earlier studies of community\nand student populations that found that some social characteristics function\nmore in deciding whether to seek help, while others are more important in deter-\nmining pathways into specific types of care.20 Over time people tend toward\nsources of assistance that are socially and culturally compatible.\nOverall, the magnitude and severity of distress and disability are the most im-\nportant determinants of perceiving a need for care. Help seekers with greater dis-\ntress are more likely to use mental health specialty care than are those with less\ndistress. Social selection, however, occurs across the range of distress and impair-\nment, and factors independent of psychopathology and disability help to explain\nwho enters treatment and the varying trajectories of care. Understanding such\nfactors could be useful in designing strategies to achieve a better fit between need\nand treatment.\nTreatment Of Mental Illness Is Not Unique\nThe processes that define how persons with symptoms identify need and de-\ncide to seek care are common to most types of illness. However, the values mea-\nsured on predictors such as perceived stigma, insurance coverage, expectations of\ntreatment benefits, and the like may vary a great deal from one illness to another.21\nIn a classic article on the ecology of medical care, Kerr White and his colleagues\nused existing data to characterize the selective trajectories that brought individu-\nals from a population at risk to various levels of care.22 A recent update of these\ndata indicates that approximately 80 percent of the population report an illness in\nany given month, but only about a third of the population consider seeking medi-\ncal care.23 Slightly more than one in five will actually visit a physician's office. Ap-\nproximately one in fifteen will visit an alternative-medicine provider. As with\npsychiatric symptoms, the extent of morbidity is the single best predictor of who\nreaches treatment, but the care trajectory depends on many factors other than\nsymptoms.\nA variety of models have been developed to explain these help-seeking trajecto-\nries.24 Use of less conventional treatments and providers fits a social movements\nmodel. Early users of such services are quite distinct in their social and cultural\ncharacteristics, but as the provider or treatment gains wider cultural acceptance,\nB a r r i e r s T o C a r e\n\"The magnitude and severity of distress and disability are the most\nimportant determinants of perceiving a need for care.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

They are joined by phar-\nmaceutical manufacturers and practitioners whose economic and professional in-\nterests are tied to public acceptance of various medications and forms of therapy.\nAs newer medications have become available, a close alliance has developed\namong mental health advocates, mental health professionals, and pharmaceutical\ncompanies, all seeking to gain cultural acceptability and market share for their\ntherapies. This coalition is increasingly at loggerheads with public and private\npurchasers and with managed behavioral health care companies, which are con-\ncerned about the potential growth in demand and costs. The challenge is to clearly\nidentify who among the population with psychiatric symptoms could gain from\ntreatment and how best to remove the barriers to their treatment.\nn Prevalence of psychiatric conditions. In the past couple of decades psychi-\natric epidemiology has greatly advanced its influence by measuring conditions rep-\nresentative of disorders covered by the DSM.26 These studies generally find that\nabout a third of the U.S. population has had a psychiatric or substance abuse disor-\nder in the prior twelve months, and more than half are believed to have had a disor-\nder that meets DSM criteria at some point in their lives. Similar estimates are in-\ncreasingly made for children. There is much reason to believe that the criteria for\ndisorders based on DSM descriptions reached by professional consensus are\noverinclusive; that is, they include persons who do not need, would not benefit from,\nand may even be harmed by treatment.27 More recent studies have added disability\nand impairment criteria to narrow the definition of needed treatment.28 This im-\nproves the estimates' usefulness, but they continue to be unconvincing to critics.\nn Overselling the need for treatment. There are disadvantages in overselling\nthe need for treatment. Inflated estimates are met with considerable public skepti-\ncism and have limited credibility, thereby undermining support for extensions of in-\nsurance. Others derive the impression that providing needed mental health care is a\nbottomless pit and not a high priority among competing needs and demands. There\nis also concern that a treatment focus on symptoms that will resolve themselves and\nthat are often reactive to disturbing life circumstances could undermine more con-\nstructive coping efforts and capacities. Some mental health advocacy groups have\nsought treatment and mental health parity legislation only for persons who meet\ncriteria for specified conditions, often referred to as \"disorders of the brain.\" While\nthe intent of such specification has public policy merit, such artificial distinctions\nhave no scientific validity and exclude many who would benefit from treatment.\nM e n t a l H e a l t h\n1 4 2 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In fact, such assertions about the population are meaningless.\nMost people will have a medical condition during any given year, but making such\na public pronouncement would have no purpose. Beyond whatever rhetorical\nvalue it might have to alert or alarm the public about the prevalence of \"mental ill-\nness,\" such estimates have little policy import. A large variety of conditions are\nlisted in the DSM. We would do much better discussing schizophrenia, major de-\npression, and anxiety disorders in their appropriate context rather than talking\nbroadly about mental health and mental illness. The term mental illness itself is a\nmajor barrier to treatment. Moving away from this concept is difficult to achieve\nbut a worthy aspiration.\nn Inadequate treatment for serious disorders. Studies that focus on those in\nthe population with the most severe and persistent illnesses find that the care re-\nceived is inadequate by any reasonable criterion.29 Many factors may contribute,\nsuch as the lack of insight and resistance to treatment among many patients, lack or\ninadequacy of insurance coverage, lack of access to appropriate services and profes-\nsionals, and the seemingly intractable character of some of these disorders that may\ndiscourage professional interest. Although certain services can be helpful for even\nthe most intractable disorders, providing such services requires more effort and co-\nordination than is often available. There is also competition and value disagreement\namong mental health advocates about the desirability of focusing services on a\nsmaller but more severely ill population compared with efforts to prevent or treat\nless severe pathology earlier. These divisions are exacerbated by uncertainties asso-\nciated with the costs and benefits of different treatment priorities.\nA solution to this challenge is to have a broad definition for eligibility and cov-\nerage but then allow experienced professionals to make the determination of\nwhat care is needed. This essentially is what managed behavioral health care was\nintended to do, and such an approach is required if we are to have any reasonable\nimplementation of parity in health insurance between general medical and mental\nhealth care. Managed behavioral health care, however, lacks trust among advo-\ncates for the mentally ill as well as the general public. Problems of trust are com-\npounded by disagreements among professionals about appropriate criteria for\ntreatment, by the profit orientation of much of the managed care industry, and by\nvery vigorous management of mental health services compared with management\nof other medical services.30 Thus, managed behavioral health care now functions un-\nder sustained derogation, litigation, and efforts at micromanagement. This is hardly a\nhelpful atmosphere in which to make difficult policy and treatment decisions.\nB a r r i e r s T o C a r e\n\"Behavioral research makes clear that knowledge by itself is not a\nsufficient inducement to bring people into needed care.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Open-ended insurance for the range\nof available treatments, and the ability of providers to induce demand for some of\nthese services, exceeds anything purchasers are willing to pay for. Thus, restoring\ntrust in managed behavioral health care strategies, developing systems to base\ntreatment availability on the best available evidence and practice, and providing\nmechanisms for procedural justice in rationing care are necessary requirements.\nNorman Daniels and James Sabin suggest a starting framework for procedural jus-\ntice that includes making rationales for limiting access available to the public, pro-\nviding \"reasonable\" reasons for such limitations, allowing patients and doctors to\nchallenge decisions and argue for their revision through established mechanisms,\nand having a process to ensure fidelity to these procedures.31 The evidence is per-\nsuasive that a well-functioning managed care approach can provide an acceptable\nlevel of care at a cost that purchasers could support, and managed care is the only\nroad to a realistic application of parity.32\nThe Need For Sophisticated Public Education\nDespite much effort, the public is still only vaguely aware of most types of psy-\nchiatric morbidity and the availability of effective treatments. Most of the effort\nhas gone into increasing awareness of clinical depression and its treatment, and\nthe greatest progress seems to have been made in this area. But even here, two-\nfifths of persons in the NMHAS who were symptomatic but undiagnosed re-\nported that they had never heard of this condition. In a condition less well known\nto the public, generalized anxiety disorder, 84 percent who were symptomatic but\nundiagnosed reported that they had never heard of this condition.\nWe do not have comparable data for other specific diagnostic entities, but we\ncan reasonably assume that the public is unaware of most. The public is also un-\naware of most medical diagnoses, and it would be pointless to attempt to achieve\nbroad, highly specific knowledge. However, a small number of conditions account\nfor most population morbidity, and increasing public understanding of these con-\nditions and their evidence-based treatment potential would be of value. Mental\nhealth professionals have been correct in focusing on depression because of its\nprofound disabling consequences and the availability of helpful treatment.33 Ex-\npanding efforts to provide a more sophisticated understanding of the half-dozen\nor so conditions that cause much impairment and for which useful treatments are\navailable could serve as a good basis for future educational efforts.\nBehavioral research makes clear that knowledge by itself is not a sufficient in-\nducement to bring people into needed care. Distress and impairment and aware-\nness of treatment potential provide motivation, but a range of other enabling fac-\ntors make it more probable that perceived need will translate into treatment.\nThese include the implementation of an action plan with such steps as specifically\nM e n t a l H e a l t h\n1 4 4 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Involvement in\nsocial circles supportive of treatment helps some to overcome barriers of what to\ndo and how to do it and makes taking some action more acceptable. Public infor-\nmation campaigns have to more clearly include and explain action plans.34\nAdditional Implications For Public Policy\nThe challenge for public policy is to develop a structure that makes it possible\nto close the gap in unmet need at a cost that purchasers and the larger society will\nfind acceptable. Advocates have argued for decades for more resources to be de-\nvoted to mental health treatment, but they face many competitors. The good news\nis that we have increasingly convincing evidence that need can be met at an ac-\nceptable cost by sophisticated management of care. The bad news is that the in-\nstruments for achieving this--managed behavioral health care strategies--are\npersistently bad-mouthed by professionals who see their incomes and autonomy\nthreatened and by many advocates who dislike any constraints on the provision of\ncare. Any reasonable pattern of mental health services that is sufficiently compre-\nhensive and that does not exclude large numbers of people will have to be a system\nthat is carefully managed.\nPolicymakers have to stay focused on the key issues: extension of insurance cov-\nerage for psychiatric morbidity; continued development and dissemination of\nmodels of best practice; encouragement of an evidence-based decision process;\nand procedures to ensure continued dialogue and procedural fairness in managed\ncare decision making. They also must recognize the uncertainties and inadequa-\ncies of care and promote continued knowledge development and understanding.\nAssessments of need are best made by experienced professionals. From a policy\nperspective, this is achieved by easing the initial access to care and evaluation, so\nthat a balanced judgment can be made of the extent of need and the benefits from\ntimely and focused treatment. In principle, this is what good managed behavioral\nhealth care is intended to achieve, but the public remains suspicious of its motives\nand decision-making criteria.\nThe challenge is to increase acceptance of a managed approach\nthat is essential to putting into place a realistic concept of mental health\nparity. It is evident that a tighter regulatory structure will be required to\nachieve public legitimacy. Such a structure would include an appropriate and fair\ncomplaint and grievance process, the use of patient representatives to adjudicate\ndisputes informally and early in the treatment process, and clear and visible guide-\nlines for rationing decisions that can be contested by patients or their advocates.\nThis is not an ideal world, but probably all of this is possible within present reali-\nties. Government can help by prudently designing a regulatory framework that\nachieves these objectives and contributes to building public trust.\nB a r r i e r s T o C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
