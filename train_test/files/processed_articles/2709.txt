The racial attitude of\ninterest is how religious Americans explain the persistent socioeconomic gap\nbetween Blacks and Whites in the United States. Before proceeding with the\ncurrent study, we first provide a brief overview of research on the intersections of\nrace/ethnicity, congregational diversity, and racial attitudes.\nBACKGROUND\nDoes Race/Ethnicity Account for Variations in Racial Attitudes among\nReligious Affiliates?\nOver the past few decades, a growing body of research has examined the link\nbetween race/ethnicity and Americans' racial attitudes, and particularly their at-\ntitudes on racial inequality. Results generally suggest that Blacks and Hispanics\nare more likely than Whites to attribute Black/White socioeconomic inequality\nbetween 1998 and 2006, the percentage that had at least some African Americans rose from\n27 percent to 36 percent; for Latinos, the percentage rose from 24 percent to 32 percent; and\nfor Asians, the percentage rose from 17 percent to 20 percent.\nto structural causes such as racial discrimination and/or unequal access to quality\neducation. Research also suggests that, when compared with Whites, Blacks are\nless likely to attribute Black/White inequality primarily to individualist sources\nKrysan 2000). Studies focusing on religious Americans in particular report\nsimilar findings. For example, when compared with religiously affiliated Whites,\nBlacks' understanding of racial inequality is more structural and less individualist\nWhile we know of no study that explores whether Hispanic and White religious\naffiliates differ in their explanations for Black/White inequality, Hispanic reli-\ngious affiliates are more likely to endorse structural explanations of poverty in\nAnd Hispanics on the whole are more likely than Whites to affirm structural ex-\nplanations for Black/White inequality and poverty (Edgell and Tranby 2007;\nnicity and motivational explanations are mixed.3 In light of previous research,\nwe expect that:\nH1: Religiously affiliated Blacks and Hispanics will be more likely than religiously affiliated\nWhites to affirm structuralist explanations for Black/White inequality, and less likely to affirm\nindividualist explanations for Black/White inequality.\nDoes Congregational Diversity Moderate the Relationship between Race/\nEthnicity and Racial Attitudes? Considering Two Perspectives\nThe potential link between congregational diversity and racial attitudes both\nwithin and across various racial and ethnic groups is an important issue to address\nbecause of controversies in the literature on multiracial faith communities.\nWhile the prevailing opinion is that attending racially homogenous congrega-\ntions tends to reinforce racial divisions on various social attitudes (Lincoln and\nof whether or not significant racial/ethnic differences in racial attitudes will\ntion as a central organizing feature in the United States (Bonilla-Silva 1997;\nOmi and Winant 1994), some scholars contend that racially diverse faith com-\nmunities are racialized institutions that typically cater to the racial sensibilities of\nthese multiracial congregations, though racially diverse in attendance, remain\n3Edgell and Tranby (2007) found no link between Hispanic ethnicity and motivational\nexplanations for Black/White inequality. However, in Hunt's (2007) study, he found that\nwhile Hispanics and Blacks were less likely than Whites to affirm motivation alone as an ex-\nplanation for Black/White inequality, they were more likely than Whites to affirm both moti-\nvation and structural explanations for Black/White inequality. Elsewhere, Hunt (1996) found\nsimilar results regarding poverty explanations.\nsocial spaces in which the White hegemony characteristic of society at large is\nnot challenged, but rather is reproduced within the congregation. There is some\nevidence to support this claim. For example, in Edwards's ethnographic study of\nan interracial church, she recounts that \"African-American attendees . . . were\nactually more inclined to use individually oriented explanations for racial in-\nequality than were white attendees\" (2008:96). This finding would suggest that,\nrather than challenge dominant White racial frames that blame Blacks for in-\nequality, multiracial congregations may (1) actually reinforce White racial\nframes, thus influencing minority attendees along these lines, and/or (2) attract\nminority attendees who are already assimilated to the dominant White culture\nH2a: Whites in multiracial congregations will affirm explanations for Black/White inequality\nthat are no different from Whites in nonmultiracial congregations.\nH2b: Blacks and Hispanics in multiracial congregations will affirm explanations for Black/\nWhite inequality that are relatively less structuralist and more individualist than Blacks and\nHispanics in nonmultiracial congregations.\nThis perspective, however, is not universally echoed among sociologists of\nrace/ethnicity and religion. An alternative theory suggests that racially diverse\nfaith communities may be successful in reducing and/or eliminating racial/ethnic\ndifferences in racial attitudes. Some scholars (e.g., DeYoung et al. 2003; Emerson\npromote more progressive attitudes toward racial issues, particularly among\ngious services with any number of Blacks exhibit a lower tendency to stereotype\nBlack Americans when compared with Whites who attended religious services\nwithin a completely White congregation. Subsequent studies also find a positive\nassociation between attending a multiracial congregation and Whites' holding\nmore progressive racial attitudes on issues such as interracial families and neigh-\nborhood diversity compared with Whites who attend more racially homogenous\nthis could be a selection effect. But, this relationship has been affirmed by some\nBlack and Hispanic participants in multiracial faith communities are not assimi-\nlated to dominant White racial frames, but maintain their distinctive racial\nviews. Emerson and Yancey (2008) find that Blacks who attend multiracial con-\ngregations report racial attitudes that are no different when compared with\nBlacks who attend congregations where Blacks are the majority (see also\nthat the racial composition of Hispanics' congregations has little if any affect on\ntheir racial attitudes.\ncontact hypothesis, which suggests that racial/ethnic integration potentially\nameliorates racial prejudice particularly among the majority group as their mis-\nconceptions about minority groups are challenged. Such contact, however, often\ndoes not have the same result among minority group members, as they are\nalready more familiar with the dominant group than vice versa. As it relates to\ncongregations, these findings lend support for Emerson's (2006) contention that,\nregardless of race/ethnicity, individuals who attend multiracial congregations are\nmore likely to adopt views of racial inequality that are distinct from Whites who\nattend predominantly White, homogenous congregations. Based on this argu-\nment, we propose an alternative hypothesis to H2a-b.\nH3a: Whites in multiracial congregations will affirm explanations for Black/White inequality that\nare relatively more structuralist and less individualist than Whites in nonmultiracial congregations.\nH3b: Blacks and Hispanics in multiracial congregations will affirm explanations for Black/White\ninequality that are no different from Blacks and Hispanics in nonmultiracial congregations.\nThis Study's Contribution\nThough this is not the first study to link race/ethnicity, congregations, and\nracial attitudes, there are several differences between the present study and prior re-\nsearch on this topic. First, in contrast to previous works that relied on nonrandom\nsamples, this study utilizes data from a nationally representative sample of religious\nattendees linked to a nationally representative sample of congregations. Second,\nrather than one or two religious traditions, our sample includes respondents from\nover 100 denominations encompassing all of the major religious traditions in the\nUnited States. Third, we offer a more rigorous analysis of race/ethnicity, congrega-\ntional context, and racial attitudes. We consider whether racial/ethnic differences\nin racial attitudes differ by whether or not religious respondents participate in a ra-\ncially diverse faith community. We must clarify, however, that our research does\nnot attempt to test whether perceived or actual intergroup contact influences the\nracial/ethnic differences in racial attitudes. In this sense, our research is not an\nactual test of the contact hypothesis, since we do not have information about the\nfrequency or quality of intergroup contact occurring in religious communities. Nor\ncan we establish temporal precedence as our data are cross-sectional. Therefore, we\nmust settle for an examination of a setting in which intergroup contact could occur\nand how this setting may relate to racial attitudes across racial/ethnic groups\nthrough direct influence and/or self-selection.\nMETHODS\nData\nA strength of our study is the novel pairing of nationally representative data\nfrom two sources: the GSS and the NCS. We use individual-level data from the\n1998 and 2006 GSS, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults\nthe GSS has sampled roughly 3,000 persons in even-numbered years. We use GSS\ndata from 1998 and 2006 because in these years, the survey included special modules\non religion and spirituality. These individual-level GSS data are combined with\ndata from the 1998 and 2006 NCS, a survey of a nationally representative sample of\nreligious congregations in the United States. The 1998 and 2006 GSS included a set\nof items asking respondents who say they attend religious services at least once\nor twice a year to report the name and location of their religious congregation\n(Chaves and Anderson 2008). Because each NCS congregation was nominated by\nat least one GSS respondent who attends that congregation, congregation-level data\ngathered by the NCS can be linked to individual-level data collected from the GSS\nrespondent who attends that congregation. This linkage enables us to examine the\nassociation of congregational characteristics on individuals. The response rates for\nDependent Variables: Explanations for Racial Inequality\nThe dependent variables in this study are respondents' explanations for socioe-\nconomic inequality between Blacks and Whites in the United States. We focus on\nstructuralist and individualistic understandings of racial inequality, as used in pre-\n2007; Taylor and Merino 2011). Three items ask whether or not racial discrimina-\ntion, inadequate access to quality education, and Blacks' lack of motivation or will-\npower are important in explaining socioeconomic differences between Blacks and\nWhites. Respondents were asked about these possibilities separately, providing\nthree sets of dichotomous responses. We sum the items for discrimination and edu-\ncation to create a three-point structural explanations scale, where 0 \u00bc a respon-\ndent answered \"no\" to both structural items; 1 \u00bc a respondent answered \"yes\" to\none structural item, and 2 \u00bc a respondent answered \"yes\" to both structural items.\nWe use the motivation item (coded 1 for agreement and 0 for disagreement) to\nmeasure an individualist explanation for inequality. Our coding of these variables\nmatches previous research by Taylor and Merino (2011).4\nIndependent Variables\nRace/ethnicity. Rather than relying on a racial dichotomy such as Black/\n4The GSS included another option to explain socioeconomic differences between Blacks\nand Whites in the United States: Because most Blacks have less in-born ability to learn. Less\nthan 6 percent of Black, White, and Hispanic religious adherents in our survey responded yes\nto this question. Consistent with previous research on race/ethnicity and beliefs about socioe-\nconomic differences between Blacks and Whites (e.g., Emerson and Smith 2000; Hinojosa\nand Park 2004), we exclude this measure from our analysis.\nuse a coding scheme that distinguishes non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and\nHispanics. Following Hunt (2007), Hispanics are identified as respondents who\nsaid that their ancestors came from countries or parts of the world that indicate\nHispanic origins. This was accomplished using existing codes on the GSS vari-\nable ETHNIC, from which four categories were selected: those indicating (1)\nMexico, (2) Spain, (3) Puerto Rico, and/or (4) other Spanish origins. Our result-\ning categories for race/ethnicity are Blacks (i.e., persons identified as Black on\nthe GSS variable RACE, and who are not Hispanic), Hispanics (of any race,\nidentified as described above), and non-Hispanic Whites (i.e., persons identified\nas White on the GSS variable RACE, and who are not Hispanic). Non-Hispanic\nWhites are the reference category in regression analyses. Due to limitations of\nsample size for Asians and persons of other races, we restrict our analyses to com-\nparisons of the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States.\nMultiracial and nonmultiracial congregations. Following previous research on\nracial diversity in faith communities (Christerson et al. 2005; DeYoung et al.\nracial congregations as places where no one racial group is 80 percent or more of\nthe congregation. Nonmultiracial or uni-racial congregations are places where 80\npercent or more of a congregation is of the same race and they serve as our\nreference group. In order to link GSS and NCS data together, a respondent must\nhave attended a religious service at least once in the previous year. Con-\nsequently, our analysis is limited to American adults who identify with a faith\ncommunity at least marginally. This accounts for approximately two-thirds of\nControl Variables\nMultivariate models include a host of sociodemographic and ideological con-\ntrols following research on Americans' attitudes toward racial inequality (Edgell\nAge is measured in years and captures all respondents from age 18 to 89.\nEducation is measured in years. Homeowners are coded as a dummy variable with\nHomeowners \u00bc 1, and others \u00bc 0. Gender is coded \"1\" if female and \"0\" if male.\nIn order to control for region, we created dummy variables for South, West,\nNortheast, and Midwest. We treat South as the reference group. Hinojosa and\nPark (2004) found that political orientation is strongly associated with beliefs\nabout Black/White inequality. Therefore, we include a respondent's political view,\nmeasured on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 \u00bc extremely liberal, to 7 \u00bc ex-\ntremely conservative. We also measure a congregation's political view using the\nNCS data. The question wording for the variable was: \"Politically speaking,\nwould your congregation be considered more on the conservative side, more on\nthe liberal side, or right in the middle?\" We coded this variable 1 \u00bc liberal; 2 \u00bc\nmiddle; and 3 \u00bc conservative. We include a limited set of controls for religious\ntradition. Although it is customary to separate Protestants into Evangelical,\nMainline, and Black traditions (Steensland et al. 2000), there are not a sufficient\nnumber of multiracial congregations in each of these categories to permit us to\ntest our hypotheses. By necessity, we restrict our comparisons to Protestant,\nCatholic, and other faith. We create dummy variables for these three broad tradi-\ntions. Protestants serve as the reference group in our statistical models, since\nProtestant congregations in the United States are recognized as lagging behind\nCatholic parishes and congregations of other faith groups in regard to racial\nordinal variable that ranges from 1 \u00bc once or twice in the past year, to 7 \u00bc more\nthan once a week. We control for congregation size using the NCS measure of\nnumber of regular attendees. We use the logged number of attendees to correct\nfor skewness. Since we are using data from two points in time eight years apart,\nAnalytic Procedure\nWe begin by presenting descriptive statistics for the combined GSS\u00adNCS\nsample in table 1. This is followed by mean comparisons of racial attitudes\nbetween attendees of multiracial and nonmultiracial congregations across\nWhites, Blacks, and Hispanics in table 2. Our multivariate analytic strategy uses\nordered logistic regression and binary logistic regression to test the relationships\nbetween race/ethnicity, congregational diversity, and explanations for Black/\nWhite socioeconomic inequality. Table 3 presents models estimating structural\nand motivation explanations for Black/White inequality. For structural explana-\ntions (models 1 and 2), we estimate models for this three-point ordinal variable\nwith ordered logistic regression. Models 3 and 4 focus on opinions about Blacks'\nsupposed lack of motivation. We estimate models for this dichotomous variable\nwith binary logistic regression. For both explanations, we estimate two models.\nThe first model tests for direct associations of race/ethnicity, congregational\ncontext, and control variables. The second model adds interaction terms for\nBlack \u00c2 multiracial congregation and Hispanic \u00c2 multiracial congregation. We\nexplore these possible joint associations further in tables 4 and 5. Table 4 divides\nthe sample by congregation type: nonmultiracial and multiracial. For these sub-\nsamples, we estimate models for structural explanations (models 1 and 3) and\nmotivation as an explanation (models 2 and 4). Table 5 displays separate models\nby race/ethnicity for each dependent variable. In all tables, results are presented\nas odds ratios.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics on all variables used in our analyses.\nBlacks and Hispanics are nearly 25 percent of all respondents in our sample.\nApproximately one in five respondents (21 percent) attends a multiracial congre-\ngation. In addition to descriptive statistics for the full sample, the final three\ncolumns list descriptive statistics by race and ethnicity. These columns give us a\npreliminary answer to our first research question: Does race/ethnicity account for\nvariations in racial attitudes among religious affiliates? Consistent with previous\nresearch, religiously affiliated Blacks appear more likely to affirm structural expla-\nnations for inequality and less likely to accept the motivation explanation.\nBlacks have the highest mean for structural explanations (2.06) and the lowest\nmean for motivation (0.39) of the three groups in our study, significantly differ-\nent from both Hispanics and Whites. Religiously affiliated Whites have the\nlowest mean for structural explanations (1.76), but this mean is only significantly\ndifferent from Blacks, not Hispanics. While the mean for motivation is slightly\nhigher for Hispanics (0.55) than for non-Hispanic Whites (0.49) in our sample,\nthis difference is not statistically significant. These descriptive statistics strongly\nsupport our first hypothesis regarding Blacks, but not Hispanics.\nTABLE 1 Descriptive Statistics for Full Sample and by Race/Ethnicity\nFull sample\n(mean)\nWhite\n(mean)\nBlack\n(mean)\nHispanic\n(mean)\nCongregation's political\nview\naDifferent from Whites at .05 level or better.\nbDifferent from Blacks at .05 level or better.\ncDifferent from Hispanics at .05 level or better.\nTable 2 presents comparisons of means on inequality explanations between\nattendees of multiracial and nonmultiracial congregations with Whites, Blacks,\nand Hispanics considered separately. There are no significant differences between\nWhites or Hispanics by congregational context in their likelihood to affirm\neither structural or motivational explanations for racial inequality. Attending a\nmultiracial congregation is not associated with racial attitudes for either group.\nThe only significant difference is found between Blacks who attend multiracial\ncongregations and Blacks who attend nonmultiracial congregations regarding\nstructural explanations. Specifically, Blacks in multiracial congregations (1.78) are\nsignificantly less likely than their counterparts in more homogenous congregations\n(2.11) to affirm structural explanations for inequality (p , .01). Interestingly,\nBlacks in multiracial congregations appear just as likely as Whites in either non-\nmultiracial (1.75) or multiracial (1.76) congregations to affirm structural explana-\ntions. These bivariate findings would thus lend qualified support to hypotheses 2a\nand b. To test our hypotheses further, we turn to multivariate models.\nStructural Explanations\nModels 1 and 2 in table 3 estimate the association of race/ethnicity and con-\ngregational context with structural explanations for Black/White inequality, net\nof other congregational and individual level controls. Model 1 speaks to our first\nresearch question and hypothesis (H1). Controlling for religion and other demo-\ngraphic variables, religiously affiliated Blacks and Hispanics are significantly\nmore likely than religiously affiliated Whites to affirm a structural explanation for\ninequality. Belonging to a multiracial congregation is not statistically significant\nin predicting support for structural explanations. Model 2 addresses our second\nresearch question: Does congregational diversity moderate the relationship\nbetween race/ethnicity and racial attitudes? Only the interaction term for\nBlack \u00c2 multiracial congregation is significant. Despite the increased odds of\nsupport for structural explanations of inequality held by religious Blacks overall,\nBlacks in multiracial congregations prove to be less likely than Blacks in non-\nmultiracial congregations (or Whites in multiracial congregations) to hold this\nview. This finding supports the second hypothesis (H2b). Across both models 1\nTABLE 2 Mean Comparisons for Explanations of Black/White Inequality across Race/Ethnicity\nand Congregational Context\nWhite Black Hispanic\nNonmultiracial Multiracial Nonmultiracial Multiracial Nonmultiracial Multiracial\naDifference between multiracial and nonmultiracial attendees significant at .01 level,\ntwo-tailed test.\nTABLE 3 Estimated Odds Ratios for Structural and Motivation Explanations for the Black/\nWhite SES Gap among Religious Affiliates\nPredictors\nStructural Motivation\nBlack \u00c2 multiracial congregation 0.35**\nHispanic \u00c2 multiracial\ncongregation\nCongregation's political view 0.82***\nCongregation size (logged) 0.88***\naReference group is South.\nbReference group is Protestant.\nTABLE 4 Estimated Odds Ratios for the Black/White SES Gap among Religious\nAffiliates across Congregational Characteristics\nNot multiracial\ncongregations\nMultiracial\ncongregations\nStructural Motivation Structural Motivation\nCongregation's political view 0.85***\nCongregation size (logged) 0.91*\naReference group is South.\nbReference group is Protestant.\nTABLE 5 Estimated Odds Ratios for the Black/White SES Gap among Religious Affiliates across Racial/Ethnic Groups\nWhites Blacks Hispanics\nStructural Motivation Structural Motivation Structural Motivation\naReference group is South.\nbReference group is Protestant.\nand 2, several control variables stand out as consistent correlates to structural\nexplanations of inequality. Age and education have a positive association with\nstructural explanations for racial inequality. Women are more supportive of\nstructural explanations as are persons outside the South. The political views\nof individuals and congregations relate to structural explanations as well.\nPolitically conservative people and politically conservative congregations are\nboth associated with lower levels of support for structural explanations, as are\nlarger congregations.\nIndividualist Explanation\nModels 3 and 4 in table 3 estimate the association of race/ethnicity and con-\ngregational context with support for the claim that Blacks' alleged lack of moti-\nvation is a contributing factor to Black/White socioeconomic disparities, net of\ncontrols. Model 3 takes us back to our first question and hypothesis (H1) about\ndifferences in racial attitudes by race/ethnicity. As expected, religiously affiliated\nBlacks are significantly less likely than religiously affiliated Whites to support\nthis claim. Hispanic congregants, on the other hand, are significantly more likely\nthan non-Hispanic White congregants to attribute Black/White socioeconomic\ndivisions in the United States to Blacks lacking the necessary motivation to\neliminate these gaps. Thus, Hispanic religious affiliates are both more structural-\nist (model 1) and more individualist (model 3) than their white counterparts\n(see Hunt 2007). Our first hypothesis is only partially supported here. Model 3\ndemonstrates again that the racial composition of a congregation is no guarantee\nof shared racial attitudes. Attendees of multiracial congregations are not signifi-\ncantly different from attendees of nonmultiracial congregations in regard to their\nviews on motivation as a source of racial inequality. Pertaining to our second re-\nsearch question, neither of the interaction terms in Model 4 is statistically signifi-\ncant. The racial composition of a congregation does not seem to moderate the\nrelationship of race/ethnicity and motivation as an explanation of inequality.\nAge, education, gender, region, personal political view, and congregation's polit-\nical view are significant control variables. Older adults are associated with\nsupport for structural explanations and motivation as an explanation. For all\nother control variables, increased support for structural explanations is paralleled\nby a rejection of motivation as an explanation. Women as well as residents in the\nWest and Midwest (when compared with the South) have lower odds of explain-\ning Black/White socioeconomic gaps on the basis of Black's lack of motivation.\nIndividuals and congregations with conservative political views display higher\nodds of holding this attitude.\nRacial Attitudes by Congregational Context\nThus far, we have consistent evidence that attitudes toward racial inequality\ndiffer by race and ethnicity within congregations. The influence of congregation-\nal context seems negligible in general, but does moderate the racial attitudes of\nBlacks somewhat. Table 4 provides a more detailed look at influences on racial\nattitudes by congregational context. Models 1 and 2 predict structural and moti-\nvation explanations for Black/White inequality, focusing on individuals who\nattend nonmultiracial congregations. In the typical U.S. congregation where\nracial diversity is minimal, Blacks favor structural explanations more than\nWhites (model 1). Blacks and Hispanics also differ from Whites in regard to mo-\ntivation as an explanation (model 2), but the direction of this association is op-\nposite for the two minority groups. Blacks are less affirming of motivation than\nWhites, while Hispanics are more affirming than Whites. As seen in table 3, edu-\ncation, gender, region, personal political view, and congregation's political view\nare associated with both racial attitudes. Models 3 and 4 predict our two explana-\ntions for Black/White inequality for individuals who attend multiracial congrega-\ntions. Within multiracial congregations, significant differences in racial attitudes\nfor Blacks and Whites disappear. While Blacks in multiracial congregations now\nappear slightly less structural and more individualist than their white counter-\nparts, these differences are not statistically significant. Hispanics in multiracial\ncongregations appear more structurally oriented than Whites (model 3), but\nthese two groups within multiracial congregations are not statistically different in\ntheir opinion of motivation as a cause of Black/White inequality (model 4). In\nboth types of congregations (across all four models), education and the congrega-\ntion's political view relate to both racial attitudes. Education is positively associ-\nated with structural explanations and negatively associated with motivation as\nan explanation. Political conservatism in congregations is related to less support\nfor structural explanations and more support for motivation as an explanation.\nLarger congregations, regardless of racial composition, show a tendency toward\nantistructural thinking.\nRacial Attitudes by Race/Ethnicity\nOur final models represent another way to answer our second research ques-\ntion and test hypotheses 2a and b and 3a and b. Instead of comparing racial/\nethnic groups' attitudes by congregational context, table 5 compares the associa-\ntion of multiracial congregations and racial attitudes by race and ethnicity.\nOrganized this way, being in a multiracial congregation is not associated with the\ninequality explanations affirmed by Whites, Blacks, or Hispanics. The finding\nthat Whites in multiracial congregations are no different from Whites in non-\nmultiracial congregations in their explanations for Black/White inequality sup-\nports hypothesis 2a, thereby rejecting hypothesis 3a. The finding that neither\nBlacks nor Hispanics in multiracial congregations are significantly different from\ntheir counterparts in nonmultiracial congregations in their inequality explana-\ntions supports hypothesis 3b, thereby rejecting hypothesis 2b. The only consis-\ntent trend here would be that attending a multiracial congregation has a\nnegligible association with respondents' racial attitudes when compared with\nothers of the same race or ethnicity. It is possible, however, that these null find-\nings may be due to the decrease in sample size when models for racial/ethnic\ngroups are estimated separately. These findings should thus be considered in\nconjunction with those in tables 2\u00ad4 where we find that Blacks and Hispanics in\nmultiracial congregations do think differently about racial inequality than do\nWhite congregants or others of the same race/ethnicity in more racially homoge-\nnous congregations.\nAmong the control variables, only region is statistically significant across\nracial/ethnic groups. Whites and Hispanics in the West are more structuralist in\ntheir thinking about Black/White inequality than are members of the same race/\nethnicity in the South (models 1 and 5). Whites and Hispanics in the Midwest\nare less individualist than members of the same race/ethnicity in the South\n(models 2 and 6). Whites and Hispanics in the Midwest diverge in their support\nfor structuralist explanations however. Whites in this region are more structural-\nist (model 1), while Hispanics are less structuralist (model 2). There are no re-\ngional variations in racial attitudes for Blacks. Only for Whites are any other\ncontrol variables significant. Structuralist explanations are more common for\nWhites who are older, more educated, female, living outside the South, more po-\nlitically liberal in their personal politics, in more politically liberal congrega-\ntions, and in smaller congregations (model 1). An individualist explanation for\ninequality is more common for Whites who are older, less educated, male, living\noutside the West or Midwest, more politically conservative, or in more politically\nconservative congregations (model 2).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we used congregational-level data from the NCS linked to indi-\nvidual files in the GSS to examine the interplay of race/ethnicity and congrega-\ntional context in predicting the racial attitudes of religious Americans. The\nresults of our analyses generally support our first hypothesis. Consistent with\nother work on religion and racial attitudes, explanations for racial inequality\namong religiously affiliated Blacks are more structural and less individualist than\ntheir White counterparts, holding all else constant. Slightly different, however,\nHispanics understanding of racial inequality was both more structuralist and more\nindividualist than Whites (table 3: models 1 and 3). On the surface, these find-\nings point to limitations in the assumption of racial/ethnic similarity thesis\ncal processes that shape racial attitudes do not vary across racial/ethnic groups.\nThe finding that religiously affiliated Hispanics tend to embrace both structuralist\nand individualist explanations for racial inequality suggests that, while acknowl-\nedging the role of structural barriers, they may cling more tightly to the American\nDream than Blacks, believing that all racial/ethnic minority groups can prosper if\nBeyond racial/ethnic differences in racial attitudes, we were interested in the\npossible moderating influence of congregational context. We posed competing\nhypotheses. Hypotheses 2a and b predicted that Whites in multiracial\ncongregations would hold similar attitudes to other Whites, while Blacks and\nHispanics in multiracial congregations would show more similarity to Whites'\nracial attitudes, i.e., being less structuralist and more individualist in their expla-\nnations of Black/White inequality. Hypotheses 3a and b proposed the opposite: a\nchange in racial attitudes for Whites in multiracial congregations, but not for\nBlacks and Hispanics. Our results reveal that race/ethnicity and religion do inter-\nsect in meaningful ways to shape the racial understandings of Blacks, Whites,\nand Hispanics. Blacks that attend racially homogenous congregations are signifi-\ncantly more likely than Whites in such congregations to affirm structural expla-\nnations for inequality and less likely to affirm individualist explanations (tables 3\nand 4). However, Blacks that attend religious services in multiracial congrega-\ntions are significantly less likely than either Whites in multiracial congregations\n(see Edwards 2008:96) or Blacks in more racially homogenous congregations to\nendorse structuralist understandings of racial inequality (tables 2 and 3). This\nlends some support to hypothesis 2b. Blacks in multiracial congregations may be\ninfluenced by such congregations to embrace a dominant White racial frame in\nwhich the importance of structure is diminished, and such congregations could\nalso be attractive to Blacks who already embrace those perspectives on inequality.\nThis finding is complicated however by the fact that Blacks in multiracial congre-\ngations looked no different in their racial attitudes from Blacks in nonmultiracial\ncongregations, as seen in table 5. The impact of multiracial congregations seems\nto be more a reduction of attitudinal differences across racial/ethnic groups than\na stark contrast between people of the same race in different types of congrega-\ntional settings. The attitude most affected within multiracial congregations is\nstructuralist thinking. Blacks in multiracial congregations are less structuralist,\nrelative to their white counterparts (tables 2 and 3), while Hispanics in multira-\ncial congregations are more structuralist (table 4).\nFor Whites, our findings match the expectation stated in hypothesis 2a. We\nfound no statistically significant differences in support for structural explanations\nof racial inequality between Whites who attend multiracial congregations and\nthose who attend nonmultiracial congregations (tables 2 and 5). Hence, multira-\ncial congregations are not necessarily social contexts in which dominant White\nracial frames are challenged, but in fact, such contexts may actually affirm the\nMarti 2005). We did, however, observe statistically significant differences in\nracial attitudes between Hispanics who attend religious services in multiracial\ncongregations and their White counterparts, with Hispanic attendees being\nmore likely to affirm structural explanations for Black/White inequality than\nWhite attendees (table 4). This finding does not align with either of our compet-\ning hypotheses (2b or 3b). It may be that Hispanics in multiracial congregations\nare at least more progressive on this issue than Whites. Lastly, when analyzing\neach racial/ethnic group separately, we found no substantive differences between\nattendees of multiracial congregations and attendees of nonmultiracial congrega-\ntions for any race/ethnicity on their tendency to affirm motivation as an\nexplanation for Black/White inequality. The findings reported in table 5 match\nour predictions hypotheses 2a and 3b.\nSeveral other consistent influences on racial attitudes are apparent in our\ntables. Education is related to more structuralist and less individualist views of\nBlack/White inequality. Political conservatism for respondents and for congrega-\ntions is associated with less support for structuralist explanations and more\nsupport for the individualist explanation. Our findings on education are hardly\nsurprising. Education has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to combat racial\nhostilities for over five decades. The impact of political views is a novel contribu-\ntion of our study. Congregations are voluntary associations composed of individu-\nals who with similar backgrounds and beliefs. Politics may be part of what draw\npeople together within religious groups. Hence, congregations may possess a po-\nlitical orientation that attract some but repel others. Some scholars point to the\nperceived confluence of religion and conservative politics in the United States as\na factor explaining the rise of religiously unaffiliated Americans, many of whom\nconservative politics is not conducive to progressive racial attitudes in congrega-\ntions. It is important to point out, however, that the effects of education and po-\nlitical views seem to apply most noticeably to White congregants. These\nvariables are statistically significant in tables 3 and 4, but they are significant\nonly for Whites in table 5. Another caveat worth noting is that political views\nmay be a proxy for theological conservatism. We do not control for the theologi-\ncal orientation of a congregation and our markers of religious tradition\n(Protestant, Catholic, and other faiths) are necessarily broad. As a result, we\ncannot definitively say that political conservatism, separate from theological\nconservatism, alters racial views inside congregations. Our analysis does call at-\ntention to the racial implications of religion and politics.\nCONCLUSION\nMuch of the previous literature on religion and racial attitudes has concen-\ntrated on the racial attitudes of White Americans, and has often elided the role\nof congregational factors in providing an important context for the interplay reli-\ngion, race/ethnicity, and racial ideology. We attempt to expand on this discussion\nby empirically examining how congregational diversity moderates the association\nbetween race/ethnicity and racial attitudes. Specifically, we provide more nuance\nand detail to the discussion of racial differences in racial attitudes by assessing\nwhether these race-based attitudes vary by the racial composition of religious\ncongregations. In doing so, we join a growing list of researchers investigating\nmultiracial congregations, and our study informs current discussions about the\nextent to which racially integrated congregations serve as spaces where racial/\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, our data are\ncross-sectional and thus we cannot make claims about causation or consistency\nof the observed associations over time. Second, since individuals are not clustered\nwithin congregations in our linked data sets, we cannot use more sophisticated stat-\nistical procedures, such as multilevel modeling. Third, although we theorize about\nthe importance of context, we have no way to test cross-racial interactions in con-\ngregations. Nor do we examine which specific groups are present in multiracial con-\ngregations. Both of these are fascinating follow-up questions that we hope future\nresearch will explore. Given these limitations, we have tried to be cautious in pre-\nsenting our results to avoid making sweeping claims.\nOur results suggest that race/ethnicity, congregational diversity, and racial at-\ntitudes interact in revealing ways. First, White explanations for racial inequality\nare not associated with whether they attend a diverse congregation or not. This\nimportant finding sheds some light on the supposed potential of multiracial con-\ngregations to challenge the racial status quo. It has been argued that interracial\ncontact may decrease antiblack sentiment and promote more progressive racial\ncase under the right conditions, our study demonstrates that Whites in multira-\ncial congregations are just as likely as Whites in predominantly White congrega-\ntions to question the importance of social structure in accounting for Black/\nWhite inequality and emphasize the importance of Blacks' own motivation. And\nsecond, Blacks who attend multiracial congregations are less likely to affirm\nstructural explanations for racial inequality than Blacks in nonmultiracial con-\ngregations. In other words, Blacks who attend multiracial congregations seem to\nembrace explanations of racial inequality that are more in line with the dominant\nWhite racial frame, diminishing the importance of structural factors such as dis-\ncrimination or lack of access to education. This finding would lend greater support\nto the argument of scholars (e.g., Edwards 2008; Pitt 2010) who question the po-\ntential of multiracial congregations to challenge White hegemony within society\nat large. Indeed, our findings suggest that multiracial congregations may (1) influ-\nence minority attendees to embrace dominant White racial frames and/or (2)\nselect on minority attendees who already embrace such frames in the first place.\nOur findings highlight the need for deeper examination into how contexts\nimpact White/non-White racial attitudes. Previous studies suggest the effects of\nethno-racial diversity on racial attitudes are conditional on socioeconomic factors\nplay into the development of racially diverse congregations (Dougherty and Huyser\ncontext likewise modifies linkages between race/ethnicity and racial attitudes. The\ncomplex intersection of race and social class is not adequately disentangled in\npresent congregational research. Second, the link we discover between a congrega-\ntion's political orientation and the racial attitudes of congregants is worth further\nexploration. Congregations are not immune from the racial politics echoing\noutside their doors. Ideas about racial inequality link in powerful ways to race,\nreligion, and politics. Multiracial congregations are a valuable setting for under-\nstanding the competing forces that shape Americans' racial attitudes.\nFinally, we propose a continued examination of ethnic/racial interaction\nwithin racially diverse congregations. We do not wish to argue here that intimate\ncross-race relationships are absent within diverse congregations, or that these re-\nlationships do not powerfully affect participants. Ethnographic research consis-\ntently affirms that both majority and minority racial group members within\ndiverse congregations are powerfully influenced by the experience of diversity in\nWong 2009). Rather, our findings suggest that, despite the potential of multira-\ncial congregations to bridge racial differences and promote religious unity within\nthe congregation (Marti 2005), the dominant racial ideologies outside these con-\ngregations are powerful and, consequently, interracial interaction within multira-\ncial congregations may still leave certain racial beliefs unchallenged, or even\nimport those racial ideologies to congregants (Christerson et al. 2005; Edwards\n2008). Future research on the consequences of participating in multiracial con-\ngregations for individuals should seek to disentangle the mechanisms by which\ndiverse faith communities promote solidarity and change across ethno-racial\nlines, or conversely, reinforce dominant racial ideologies within individuals.\nREFERENCES\nAllport, Gordon W. 1954.
