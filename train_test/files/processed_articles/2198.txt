Without clear guidance on the causal\npathways between peers and alcohol use, adolescent alcohol interventions may be incomplete. The objective of\nthis study is to disentangle selection and influence effects associated with the dynamic interplay of adolescent\nfriendships and alcohol use.\nMethods: The study analyzes data from Add Health, a longitudinal survey of seventh through eleventh grade\nU.S. students enrolled between 1995 and 1996. A stochastic actor-based model is used to model the co-evolution\nof alcohol use and friendship connections.\nResults: Selection effects play a significant role in the creation of peer clusters with similar alcohol use. Friendship\nnominations between two students who shared the same alcohol use frequency were 3.60 (95% CI: 2.01-9.62) times\nmore likely than between otherwise identical students with differing alcohol use frequency. The model controlled\nfor alternative pathways to friendship nomination including reciprocity, transitivity, and similarities in age, gender,\nand race/ethnicity. The simulation model did not support a significant friends' influence effect on alcohol behavior.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that peer selection plays a major role in alcohol use behavior among adolescent\nfriends. Our simulation results would lend themselves to adolescent alcohol abuse interventions that leverage\nadolescent social network characteristics.\nBackground\nEarly adolescent alcohol use is a major public health\nchallenge. One quarter of all adolescents begin drinking\nalcohol by 13 years of age [1]. Drinking before the 14th\nbirthday is associated with a fourfold increase in risk of\nalcohol dependence in adulthood [2]. Early alcohol initi-\nation is linked to many risky adolescent behaviors, in-\ncluding marijuana and cocaine use, having sex with\nmultiple partners, and academic underperformance [3].\nA wide body of literature indicates that adolescents\nand their friends exhibit more similar alcohol use behav-\nior than would be expected by chance alone [4,5].\nDrinking by a best friend has been tied to alcohol initi-\nation among middle and high school students [6,7]. In a\nsystematic review of longitudinal studies on adolescent\ndrinking, alcohol-using peers were consistently predict-\nive of an adolescent's own drinking behavior at a later\nwave [8]. However, there is debate over the mechanism\nby which friends come to resemble one another over\ntime. One possible explanation is that similarities occur\nas a result of peer influence, or the spread of behaviors\nand behavioral norms through social ties. In this manner,\nthe behavior of an individual would move toward the\naverage behavior of one's friends over time. Another\npathway to homogeneity within friendships is that\nfriends may be similar due to social selection, or homo-\nphily, the tendency for similar people to be attracted to\nand form friendships among one another.\nUnderstanding the mechanism by which similarity in\nalcohol use behavior among adolescent friends occurs is\nan important clinical matter. Lacking clear direction on\nthe causal pathways between peer interactions and alco-\nhol use, adolescent brief alcohol interventions have pro-\nduced, at best, mixed results [9,10]. As an example,\n* Correspondence: marlon.mundt@fammed.wisc.edu\n1Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Mundt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

It would also allow for the possibility of multi-\nplier or spillover effects from targeted individuals to a\nlarger network of friends. Selection-driven behavior pat-\nterns in adolescent groups would lend themselves to\ninterventions that target alcohol use in adolescent\nfriendship groups identified through social network\ncharacteristics.\nPrevious studies have attempted to disentangle selec-\ntion from influence effects in adolescent alcohol use\n[8]. Analytic techniques employed have included struc-\ntural equation modeling [11-13], latent growth models\n[20]. These studies have relied on lagged indicators of\nalcohol use and friendship connections in an attempt to\nisolate the selection effect from influence. The results\nindicate that both selection and influence are occurring,\nbut the relative contribution of the two factors cannot\nbe determined.\nA major limitation in prior studies on selection and in-\nfluence effects in adolescent alcohol use is the failure to\naccount for the co-evolution of network ties and alcohol\nuse behavior. Assuming network ties are fixed while esti-\nmating changes in drinking produces biased parameter\nestimates. In a similar manner, modeling alcohol use as\nconstant when estimating friendship tie formation can\nlead to systematic error in results. In addition, previous\nstudies are limited in their control for social network\nelements beyond the unidirectional dyadic relationship\nwhich could drive friendship formation and behavior\nchange. These factors include reciprocity (i.e., the likeli-\nhood to reply to friendship with friendship) and transi-\ntive closure (i.e., the likelihood of friends of friends to\nbecome friends). Furthermore, previous modeling strat-\negies fall short in accounting for the dependent nature\nof social network ties data. Peer interactions that encom-\npass interdependent selection and influence effects vio-\nlate the notion of independence required by traditional\nmodeling techniques such as structural equation or fixed\neffects modeling. The complexity of longitudinal social\nnetwork data necessitates more advanced statistical\nmethods than were used in previous studies of adoles-\ncent alcohol use.\nA new analytical approach to the analysis of the co-\nevolution of social network ties and behavior is stochastic\nactor-based modeling [21-23], which provides a power-\nful new tool to simultaneously model an agent's selection\nof friends based on alcohol use and changes in an agent's\nalcohol use behavior over time. The primary assumptions\nof the actor-based model are that individuals choose their\nfriendship ties and their behaviors in one step-at-a-time\nmicro-steps. At each micro-step, an agent maximizes a\npersonal utility function for surrounding network and\nrelative friend behavior. At that time point, the agent\nonly considers the current network characteristics in de-\nciding whether a change in behavior or network tie is\npreferable to the current state. In this manner, the\nprocess of co-evolution of network and behaviors from\none wave of data to another is simulated as a result of a\npotentially large number of individually unobserved\nmicro-step changes, and the network and behavior pre-\nferences parameters can be estimated. The actor-based\nmodel can disentangle selection and influence and deter-\nmine their relative contribution to similarities in alcohol\nRecent studies have begun to use actor-based model-\ning to examine the relative contribution of selection and\ninfluence effects on adolescent alcohol use [26-30]. In\none such study, a sample of 1,204 7th graders in Finland\nwere followed for 30 months to determine the degree to\nwhich the children selected or were influenced by\nfriends based on alcohol use. The results indicated both\nselection and influence played a role in alcohol use\nsimilarities among friends, although influence was\nstronger at younger ages and selection became stronger\nas students aged [30]. Another study followed cohorts\nof 4th graders, 7th graders, and 10th graders in Sweden\nfor 2 years. The findings indicated that selection based\non alcohol use was strongest in early adolescence, while\nboth influence and selection effects contributed to alco-\nhol use similarities during later adolescence [29]. More\nresearch is needed to determine the relative role of se-\nlection and influence in alcohol use homogeneity within\nadolescent friendships. The current study will add to\nthis body of literature by examining alcohol use behav-\nior in a large sample of 7th through 11th grade U.S.\nadolescents.\nWithout clear guidance on the causal pathways be-\ntween peers and alcohol use, adolescent alcohol inter-\nventions may be incomplete [9,31,32]. To fill this gap in\nthe literature, the present study will investigate the selec-\ntion and influence processes as they relate to peer\nfriendship formation and alcohol use behavior in the lar-\nger context of adolescent friendship networks. Specific-\nally, the study will address the following research\nquestions:\nSelection Research Question #1 Do adolescents select\nfriends with similar\nalcohol use?\nInfluence Research Question #2 Do adolescents adjust\ntheir alcohol\nconsumption in\ncorrespondence with\nthe alcohol\nconsumption level of\ntheir friends?\nWe hypothesize that both selection and influence\neffects will be present in the network model of adoles-\ncent alcohol use.\nMethods\nData source\nThis study analyzes data from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add\nHealth study used stratified sampling to choose high\nschools and middle schools which were representative of\nUS schools nationwide based on region of the country,\nurbanicity, school funding, and racial composition [33].\nTo construct the Add Health study sample, initially, all\nwere invited to complete an In-School Survey. Students\ncompleting the In-School Survey (n = 90,118) were then\neligible for the longitudinal portion of the study, which\nbegan with an in-home interview and parent survey. A\nrandom sample of 20,745 students selected from the In-\nSchool Survey respondents completed a Wave 1 in-\nhome survey, which was administered between April\nand December, 1995. The Wave 1 survey collected data\non social and demographic characteristics of the respon-\ndents, education and occupation of parents, household\nstructure, risk behaviors including alcohol use, expecta-\ntions for the future, self-esteem, health status, school-\nyear extracurricular activities, and friendships. As part of\nthe in-home survey, students selected their five best\nmale and five best female friends from a complete school\nroster.\nApproximately one year later, Wave 1 participants\nwho had not yet graduated from high school were\nrecontacted for a Wave 2 in-home survey. The Wave 2\nin-home survey (n = 14,738) took place between April\nand December, 1996. The content of the Wave 2 survey\nwas similar to data collected in Wave 1, including fre-\nquency of alcohol consumption over the past year. As\npart of Wave 2, students were again provided with a\ncomplete school roster and asked to name their five best\nmale and five best female friends. The Wave 2 cohort\nexcluded all subjects who were in their final year of high\nschool at Wave 1.\nThe Add Health sampling design included saturated\nsampling of students at 14 schools. All students in at-\ntendance at these schools at the time of the Wave 1 sur-\nvey were included in the sampling frame for the in-home\nsurvey. The inclusion of all students from a school allows\nthe investigation of complete peer network structures\nand their influence on behaviors and life choices.\nAnalysis sample\nThe study sample for the present analysis includes 2,563\nAdd Health subjects from the saturated school sub-\nsample. Subjects who completed the Wave 1 in-home\ninterview but were non-responders at Wave 2 were\nincluded in the model using the SIENA imputation ap-\nproach [21]. In this approach, outgoing ties of non-\nresponders are imputed and treated as non-informative\nfor statistical calculations using last observation carry\nforward while incoming ties are allowed to vary and to\ncontribute to the estimation procedures. The sample\nexcluded subjects who did not name or were not named\nby at least one friend at either Wave 1 or Wave 2.\nLow network stability between study waves could\nthrow doubt on the reliability of the friendship data\nreported and may increase the likelihood of convergence\nfailure in the iterative estimation process. The Jaccard\nindex is a measure of network stability between study\nwaves [34], indicating the proportion of existing friend-\nship ties within each school which remain consistent\nfrom Wave 1 to Wave 2 out of the total number of ties\nreported at either wave. The index is calculated as:\n\u00f0 \u00de;\nis the number of ties present at both waves,\nis the number of new ties formed in Wave 2, and F10\nis the number of ties dissolved between Wave 1 and\nWave 2. A Jaccard Index of 0.20 or higher for the school\nis generally required for inclusion in a stochastic actor-\nbased model analysis [21]. One school from the satu-\nrated subsample was excluded from the analysis based\non a Jaccard index of less than 0.20. A possible explan-\nation for low network stability is that friendships change\nwhen students transition from a middle school to high\nschool setting. A total of 13 schools were included in the\nanalysis.\nMeasures\nVariables were chosen a priori based on previous find-\nAlcohol use\nOn the in-home survey, students answered the question:\n\"How often did you consume alcohol in the past year?\"\nCategorical responses included never, 1 or 2 times, 3 to\n12 times, monthly but not weekly, weekly, and more\nthan once a week.\nSocial networks\nAt both Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the study, students pro-\nvided responses to: \"Name your 5 best male and 5 best\nfemale friends from your school roster.\" Social networks\nwithin each school resulted from the formation of a\nfriendship matrix based on the directed friendship\ndesignations.\nDemographics\nStudents provided age, grade, and race/ethnicity data at\nthe in-home interview. Age was calculated to the nearest\nmonth.\nFamily characteristics\nOur previous studies of the Add Health data show that\nfamily bonding is a strong predictor of adolescent alco-\nhol use [36]. Study participants answered: \"On a scale of\n1 to 5, how often do you and your family have fun to-\ngether?\" This item on family fun represents the notion\nof family bonding in Add Health. In addition, parents of\nthe sample students indicated in a parent interview con-\nducted at Wave 1 how often they drank alcohol in the\npast year.\nStatistical analysis\nStochastic actor-based modeling\nThe analysis uses stochastic actor-based modeling to as-\nsess the co-evolution of alcohol use and friendship ties\nfrom Wave 1 to Wave 2 of the study [21]. The stochastic\nactor-based model assumes changes in the network take\nplace according to a continuous-time Markov chain with\nstationary transition distribution. Changes from Wave 1\nto Wave 2 occur through mini-steps where the future\nstate of the network is dependent only on the present\nstate. Each mini-step is evaluated by choosing a random\nstudent i among all network members and either a po-\ntential friendship change or behavior change. In a poten-\ntial friendship change, the student i might change an\noutgoing tie to student j so as to maximize the objective\nfunction for network structure and a random unex-\nplained influence:\nf X\ni\n; x i  j\n\u00f0 \u00de; z\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe UX\ni\nt; x; j\n\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere  is the parameter set, x(i ! j) is the network\nchanges that would occur if the tie between individual i\nand individual j in the network were changed, z is the\nstate of behaviors within the network, and U is an inde-\npendent random component. For a given actor i (the\nactor who takes the micro-step), the objective function is\nmaximized over all potential alters j. The  parameters\nare estimated by Method of Moments (MoM). The MoM\nalgorithm compares the observed network (obtained\nfrom the data) to hypothetical networks generated\nthrough repeated Monte Carlo simulations [22].\nSimilarly, the individual i might make a one-step\nchange in alcohol-use behavior based on the objective\nfunction for the parameterized alcohol outcome and a\nrandom influence:\nf Z\ni\n; x; z i\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe UZ\ni\nt; z; i\n\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere  is the parameter set for behavior changes, x is\nthe current state of network ties, z(i) is the next poten-\ntial behavior state that would occur after a micro-step\nchange, and U is an independent random component.\nBy estimating the  parameters in the model, the simu-\nlated analysis seeks to define what tendencies and trends\ninfluence changes in friendship ties and in alcohol-use\nbehavior. The study model simultaneously evaluates the\nevolution of the adolescent friendship network and ado-\nlescent alcohol drinking while controlling for age, gen-\nder, race/ethnicity, parental drinking, and family\nbonding. The study uses the statistical program RSIENA\n(Simulated Investigation for Empirical Network Ana-\nlysis) [21], originally designed by Snijders and van Duijn\n[37] and programmed by Ruth Ripley and Krists\nBoitmanis.\nModel specification\nThe model specification consists of two parts, friendship\nnetwork evolution and alcohol use behavior evolution.\nFirst, the friendship network evolution portion of the\nmodel identifies the preferred choices in friendship ties\ndepending on a list of friendship choice variables.\nFriendship choice variables are based on current net-\nwork structure and friend attributes at each iterative step\nof the simulation process. Three alcohol-related vari-\nables are included in the friendship evolution part of the\nmodel: (1) the effect of an adolescent's alcohol use be-\nhavior on number of friends chosen (alcohol use\nego), (2) the effect of an adolescent's alcohol drinking on\nthe probability of being chosen as a friend by others\n(friend alcohol use), and (3) the effect of similar alcohol\nconsumption on friendship selection (alcohol use\nsimilarity).\nSeveral characteristics of the friendship network struc-\ntake account of the overall density of friendship ties\nwithin the network (density), the likelihood to recipro-\ncate friendship nominations (reciprocity), the tendency\nfor friends of friends to be friends (transitive triplets),\nthe propensity for closure in three-person friendships\n(3-cycles), the propensity for individuals with more in-\ncoming friendship nominations to attract further friend-\nship nominations (in-degree popularity), the tendency\nfor individuals who name many others as friends to at-\ntract friendship nominations (out-degree popularity),\nand the inclination for students who name more friends\nto generate even more out-going friendship ties over\ntime (out-degree activity). Control variables are age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity effects on the number of\nfriends chosen, on the probability of being chosen as a\nfriend, and on the likelihood of friends being of similar\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity.\nSecond, the alcohol use behavior evolution portion of\nthe model specifies a list of variables that could\ninfluence potential alcohol drinking behavior changes.\nThe model contains one main friendship-related influ-\nence component: the tendency for alcohol use to change\nbased on the average drinking of immediate friends.\nControl variables include age, gender, race/ethnicity, par-\nental drinking, family bonding and linear and quadratic\nshape effects modeling average drinking across the\nnetwork.\nWe employ both the Snijders-Baerveldt meta-analysis\n(two-sided) test [40] and the Fisher's combination pro-\ncedure [41] to test overall significance of the primary\nand control variables across schools. The Snijders-\nBaerveldt test makes inference about parameters in the\npopulation of schools from which the studied schools\nare considered to be a sample, while the Fisher's com-\nbination procedure makes inference only about the\nparticular schools in the study. The Fisher's procedure\nprovides two tests, a right-sided test that the overall\nvariable effect is positive and a left-sided test that\nexamines if the overall variable effect is negative. To\ncontrol for the multiple testing (right and left), we\nconsider an effect to be significant if either of the\ncombination tests was significant at level p  .025. In\nthe case of conflicting Snijders-Baerveldt and Fisher's\ncombination test results, we lean toward accepting the\nFisher's test due to the variation in school sizes in the\nsample.\nResults\nThe sample consisted of 2,563 adolescents in grades 7\nthrough 11 at Wave 1 of the Add Health survey\nfifths (39%) of respondents were minorities, with 16%\nAfrican American, 18% Hispanic, and 3% Asian. Forty-\nfour percent of the adolescents' parents reported drink-\ning alcohol in the past year. Over 70% of the adolescents\nreported strong family bonding by indicating that they\nhad fun with their family quite a bit or very much. The\nof the original sample. Subjects lost to follow-up be-\ntween Wave 1 and Wave 2 were more likely than Wave\n2 respondents to be weekly alcohol users at Wave 1\nences between respondents and non-respondents in age,\ngrade, gender, race/ethnicity, or family bonding.\nCharacteristics of the 13 schools in the study and alco-\nhol use within the schools are reported in Table 2. The\nmean number of students per school was 197. At Wave\n1, the average number of friendship nominations to\nother students in the same school was just over two per\nstudent. Fifty percent of students reported no alcohol\nuse in the past 12 months at Wave 1. Alcohol abstainers\nincreased to 54 percent at Wave 2. The proportion of\nmonthly or weekly drinkers increased between waves,\nJust over half of the students reported the same drinking\nfrequency at both waves of the study. Drinking changes\nfrom Wave 1 to Wave 2 were equally balanced with 24\npercent of respondents reporting an increase in drinking\nfrequency and 24 percent reporting a decrease.\nTable 3 presents the friendship network evolution from\nWave 1 to Wave 2.

Adolescents are more likely to nominate\nas friends others who drink similarly to themselves,\nwhich is consistent with a selection effect.\nFigure 1 displays the range, 25th percentile, and 75th\npercentile for  parameter estimates of friendship net-\nwork evolution parameters across the 13 schools in the\nstudy over 1-year follow-up. The dominant features of\nfriendship evolution are reciprocity, transitivity, and age,\nrace, and alcohol use similarity.\nTable 4 presents the results of the alcohol behavior\nevolution portion of the model from Wave 1 to Wave 2.\nInterestingly, more frequent drinking by immediate\nfriends was not significantly associated with increased\nfrequency of alcohol consumption (p = .139).

To\nachieve this goal, we utilize a stochastic actor-based\nmodel to analyze the dynamic interplay of friendship for-\nmation and alcohol behavior changes as they co-evolve\nover time. Specifically, the study evaluates if similar alco-\nhol use among friends is more likely a result of a ten-\ndency for adolescents to choose friends with similar\nalcohol use behavior, or as a result of teen influence on\neach other's drinking.\nThe results demonstrate that selection effects in adoles-\ncent friendships are based, in part, around commonalities\nSelection Effects\n*\n* *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* *\nInfluence Effects\n*\n*\n*\nFigure 1 Boxplots of Selection and Influence Effects across Schools.

Homophily in friendship forma-\ntion is also based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The\nanalysis controls for reciprocity (i.e. tendency to have re-\nciprocal friendships), transitivity (i.e. tendency to be-\ncome a friend of a friends' friend), and degree effects\n(i.e., number of in-coming or out-going friendship nomi-\nnations) as drivers of friendship formation. Our results\nare in line with previous studies showing selection\neffects to be a strong factor in alcohol use similarity\nwithin adolescent friendships [27-30]. Our study is the\nfirst to employ agent-based modeling for disentangling\npeer selection and influence effects on alcohol use beha-\nviors in a sample of U.S. middle and high school students.\nThe study findings offer little support for influence\neffects among teens after the social ties with their peers\nare in place. Our findings suggest that friends share\nsimilar alcohol behaviors not because they adjust to the\nbehavior of one another, but because they selected each\nother as friends to some degree because of similar alco-\nhol use patterns, or of similarity in their behaviors asso-\nciated with alcohol use. The results are in contrast to\ntwo European studies that identified both selection and\ninfluence as significant in alcohol use similarities among\nadolescent friends [29,30]. Our study population was\npredominantly 10th and 11th graders, which may have\ncontributed to the differing outcomes. Prior studies\nnoted that friendship selection played a relatively stron-\nger role than peer influence when explaining similarity\nof early adolescent friends' alcohol use and that influence\neffects tended to diminish as students aged [27,30].\nInterestingly, we found evidence of close family bonds,\ndefined here as having family fun, to be negatively asso-\nciated with alcohol intake. These data demonstrate that\nstrong family ties may offer protective benefits against\nadolescent alcohol consumption.\nOur results argue that homophily limits an adoles-\ncent's social interactions in a way that has powerful\nimplications for the information they receive and the\nattitudes they form toward alcohol use. Homophily cre-\nates strong divides in adolescent social environments,\nwhich set the stage for reinforcing alcohol use norms.\nMore research is needed to evaluate the dynamics of so-\ncial network and alcohol use change over time. Future\nstudies may need to explore how modifications of social\nnetworks could affect adolescent alcohol abuse.\nThe strength of the study lies in its innovative meth-\nodology, wealth of friendship variables, prospective de-\nsign and large study sample size. The study also has\nseveral limitations. First, adolescents were limited to\nnominate only up to 10 friends which may have\nobscured the friendship formation parameters in the\nmodel. However, other studies show that students on\naverage report having four friends [27,30]. Second, the\nanalysis, by limiting itself to friendships within a school,\nmay not have captured all peers in the adolescent social\nnetwork. The average number of friends reported in the\nsample was approximately two, fewer than in other stud-\nies [27,30]. This implies that potentially only some of\nthe influential peers were nominated, which limits the\nconclusions that can be drawn. However, school-based\nnetworks may be most pertinent for intervention efforts.\nThird, alcohol use in the study was self-reported. How-\never, self-reported alcohol use is generally considered to\nbe a valid measure among adolescents. Add Health used\na computer assisted data entry process for sensitive\nquestions such as alcohol and drug use to protect confi-\ndentiality and enhance full reporting. Fourth, we only\nexamined alcohol, and not tobacco and other drug use,\nin the analyses. It may be the case that peer selection oc-\ncurred not specifically for alcohol, but for other sub-\nstance use as well. It is also possible that other peer\ncharacteristics (e.g., peer delinquency) may precede ado-\nlescent alcohol use and be related to both peer selection\nand influence. Fifth, loss to follow up, in particular\nTable 4 Stochastic Actor-Based Model Results for Influence Effects on Alcohol Use Behavior\n()\np-\nvaluea\nBetween\nschool\nstd. dev.\nFisher's combination 1-side test\nRight-side(+) Left-side(-)\naSnijders-Baerveldt two-sided test [39].\nParameter estimates  and standard error for stochastic actor-based model of change in alcohol use in the Add Health study.

The increase in alcohol abstainers\nover the course of one year, which is in contrast to lon-\ngitudinal studies showing higher prevalence of drinking\nwith increasing age [42], suggests there may be limits to\nthe generalizability of the results. The 44% frequency of\nparental alcohol consumption also raises questions about\nthe representativeness of the sample, as national surveys\nindicate that 60%-70% of adults are alcohol drinkers\n[42]. Parents of adolescents in the study may have\nunderreported their current drinking. Sixth, the selection\nand influence processes may depend on contextual and\ncultural aspects of the schools analyzed, which limits\ngeneralizability to different school contexts and cultural\nsettings. Finally, the study does not directly address\nwhether the peer selection and influence processes oper-\nate in a similar manner for alcohol initiation or for heavy\ndrinking. Future studies could investigate the role of\npeer interactions in alcohol initiation and heavy\ndrinking.\nConclusions\nThis investigation demonstrates that network selection,\nor homophily, plays a prominent role in adolescent alco-\nhol drinking similarities among friends. Understanding\nthe dynamics through which adolescent friendships and\nalcohol use are initiated and maintained will allow for\ndesigning adolescent alcohol abuse intervention strat-\negies to groups or subgroups of students. Our findings\nmay be of interest to parents, health care professionals,\nschool administrators, law enforcement and community\nleaders who focus on alcohol prevention efforts.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMM conceived of the study, participated in the design, ran the analyses, and\nhelped draft the manuscript.
