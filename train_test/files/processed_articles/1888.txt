Arthritis; Smoking; Hypertension; Hospitalization; NHEFS; NHANES.\nINTRODUCTION\nArthritis affects 17.5% of all adults, and is the leading\ncause of disability in the United States (1). Although it is\nnot a fatal condition, the health burden related to arthritis\nis substantial. Functional and physical limitations are far\ngreater in persons with arthritis than in those without, and\nhaving arthritis appears to exacerbate the clinical course of\nother chronic conditions (i.e., cancer, hypertension, and\ncoronary heart disease) by increasing the limitation of\nactivities of daily living (2) and the risk of cardiovascular\nevents (3). The social impact of arthritis is also great;\narthritis patients are more likely to report needing assis-\ntance from others, and report fewer opportunities for so-\ncial interaction and sports or outdoor activities (4).\nArthritis is more common in overweight adults (5); a\nrecent study found that overweight adults were 4 times\nmore likely to have arthritis than adults of normal weight\n(6). Another study estimated that adults with arthritis and\nother rheumatic conditions accounted for approximately\n$186.9 billion in medical care expenditures (7). Further-\nmore, research has shown that hospital admissions are the\nlargest component of rheumatoid arthritis costs, account-\ning for more than 50% of the annual cost of rheumatoid\nWe compared the impact of arthritis on the number of\nhospitalizations of adults ages 45\u00ad74 with the impact at-\ntributable to smoking and hypertension. A simulation\nmodel based on the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Followup\nStudy (NHEFS) was used to estimate the hospital admis-\nsions attributable to each risk factor in NHANES III adults\nages 45\u00ad74. Several features of the model helped ensure\nthat the estimates were comparable. First, the model esti-\nmates hospital admissions for any cause, which reflect the\neffect of each risk factor on admissions for which it is\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n1Dawne M.

Second,\nthe equations that link risk factors to admissions are based\non a single, population-based nationally-representative\ndataset. Third, a wide range of risk factors is included in\nthe model, so that the effect of each is estimated after\ncontrolling for all others.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES) are large national surveys conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics that collect informa-\ntion about risk factors and health outcomes of representa-\ntive samples of Americans. The NHANES are the basis for\nnational studies and goals, such as some of those in\nHealthy People 2010, a national health report designed to\nidentify significant preventable threats to health and to\nestablish national goals to reduce these threats (10).\nThe estimates presented in this article are based on data\nnal followup, (NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study\n[NHEFS]), which tracked participants' health for 2 de-\ncades, allowing baseline risk factors to be linked to subse-\nquent outcomes. The NHEFS was used as the basis for our\nsimulation model. The hospitalization submodel of the\nsimulation model was applied to data for adults from\nlence of risk factors in that survey better represents current\ntrends in adults (e.g., more obesity, and fewer smokers).\nHospitalization submodel. The hospitalization sub-\nmodel consists of projection equations based on the\nNHEFS that link annual hospital admissions for each per-\nson to a comprehensive set of risk factors measured at\nbaseline. The submodel subdivides men and women ages\nfor each group. The NHEFS excluded persons older than\n74 at baseline. For each person (i) within an age-sex group\nin each year of followup (t), logged hospital admissions\nduring the year were related to the individual's baseline\ncharacteristics using the following equation:\nLn admissionsit\n f (risk factors)\nwhere risk factors equal arthritis, current smoking, former\nsmoking, ln systolic blood pressure, overweight, or other\nrisk factors discussed below. The equations are negative\nbinomial count regressions fitted with STATA statistical\nsoftware, version 3.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station,\nTX), (regressions available on request from the author).\nCount regressions are closely related to hazard models.\nThey model the number of events during a period of time\n(in this study, a year), while hazard models focus on the\nduration of time between events. Count models are partic-\nularly appropriate for data such as annual hospital admis-\nsions because they are built on probability distributions\nthat assume that the dependent variable takes on only\ninteger values and that zeroes and low numbers are com-\nmon (11). The negative binomial is more flexible than the\nother commonly used count model, the Poisson, because it\ndoes not require the mean and variance of the dependent\nvariable to be equal; it contains the Poisson as a special\ncase. Estimates based on the hospitalization submodel\nhave been published in 2 previous reports (12,13).\nThe submodel is fitted to data for the full 2 decades of\nfollowup and can project admissions over this period,\nadjusting for mortality. The estimates presented here do\nnot use the ability of the submodel to project events over\ntime. All estimates were made for the baseline period,\nbefore anyone had died. Thus the estimates refer to the full\nand compare alternative scenarios for that period.\nThe literature on determinants of heart disease, cancer,\nand stroke was reviewed to identify the risk factors used in\nthe regressions. The focus was on clinical risk factors,\nspecifically, those that would be determined during a visit\nto a physician. Hospital admissions were related to all\nclinical risk factors that have been shown to be statistically\nsignificantly related to disease and/or death in multiple\nstudies: age, race, smoking, systolic blood pressure, over-\nweight and underweight, laboratory test results (serum\nalbumin, serum cholesterol), exercise, alcohol consump-\ntion, diet (fiber, fish/shellfish, fruits/vegetables), and 9\nrisk factor, including arthritis, smoking, and blood pres-\nsure, was estimated after controlling for all other risk fac-\ntors. The measurement of the 3 risk factors focused on in\nthe study (arthritis, current smoking, and hypertension) is\nA dichotomous variable for arthritis was defined, based\non each participant's answer to the question in the\nNHANES I medical history interview, \"Has a doctor ever\ntold you that you have had arthritis?\" Because the question\ndid not distinguish between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid\narthritis, the answer encompassed both.\nOnly half of NHANES I participants were asked about\ntheir smoking habits at baseline; however, at the first\nHealth Statistics retrospectively collected this information\nfor the other half of the participants. Retrospective infor-\nmation was used only when baseline information was\nmissing. Machlin et al (16) reported that, for participants\nages 45\u00ad74 with both baseline and retrospective data, and\nfor the 3 categories of smokers used here (current, former,\nnever), the 2 sources matched for 89% of subject respon-\ndents and 83% of proxy respondents (proxies were used\nprimarily for people who had died). Smoking was repre-\nsented by 2 dichotomous variables in the regressions, one\nfor participants who were smokers at baseline, and one for\nparticipants who reported being former smokers. Never\nsmokers were the comparison group.\nParticipants' systolic blood pressure was measured only\nonce during their physical examinations. Because a single\nmeasurement can be atypical, national guidelines recom-\nmend that a diagnosis of hypertension be based on several\nmeasurements taken at different visits (17). However, be-\ncause the NHEFS is longitudinal (individuals were fol-\nlowed for 2 decades after baseline and hospitalizations\nwere recorded), our estimating equations self-correct for\nthis problem. Individuals who had an unusually high sin-\ngle baseline pressure measurement would naturally have\nhad the number of hospitalizations during followup that\ncorresponded to their true lower pressures. The equations\nlinking hospitalizations to baseline pressures thus correct\nfor regression to the mean because persons whose pres-\nsures were overstated by a single reading contributed a\nsmaller number of hospitalizations during followup than\nthose with genuinely elevated pressures. Systolic blood\npressure was a continuous variable in the estimating equa-\ntions. All continuous risk factors were entered in log form\nbecause logs gave a better fit.\nThe equations used in this analysis, and those used in\nthe study by Russell et al (13), were based on the full\nNHEFS followup through 1992. These equations project\nthe sample experience well, tracking both the higher ad-\nadmissions due to managed care in the later 1980s and\nbenchmark National Hospital Discharge Survey showed\nthat they accurately represented the longer-term trends\nbeyond the early 1990s, especially the return to rising\nannual admission rates among people ages 65 and older\nCohort dataset. The hospitalization submodel was used\nto estimate the impact of arthritis, smoking, and hyperten-\nsion on the number of hospital admissions in adults ages\n45\u00ad74 in the NHANES III. The cohort dataset includes all\nNHANES III respondents in this age group who were ex-\namined by a physician (n  6,265). Data were used on all\nsample persons because 84% of the respondents had com-\nplete information available, 9% of the respondents had\nmissing data for only one risk factor, and only 0.21% (13\nindividuals) were missing data for more than 5 risk factors.\nMissing values were replaced with the mean of the risk\nfactor for the age-sex group.\nArthritis, smoking habit, and systolic blood pressure\nwere determined in the same manner in both the NHANES\nI and NHANES III (except that all NHANES III adults were\nasked about smoking at baseline). Because the NHANES I\nmeasured systolic pressure only once (see above), the first\nNHANES III measurement was used in the analysis to\nmaintain consistency with the projection equations.\nSample weights. NHANES III was a stratified cluster\nsample. Our estimates for each sample person were\nweighted to reflect his/her share of the US population of\ntistical weights available for NHANES III, we used the\nweight associated with medical examinations.\nEstimates. Baseline estimates of annual hospital admis-\nsion rates were calculated by entering observed baseline\nvalues of the risk factors for the 6,265 NHANES III adult\nrespondents ages 45\u00ad74 into the model equations, and\ncalculating admissions for the baseline period. Population\nattributable-risk estimates were then calculated for 3 sce-\nnarios. In each scenario, 1 risk factor was changed in the\nbaseline period, while all other risk factors remained at\nobserved baseline values. These scenarios followed the\nstandard definition of population attributable risk, which\nmeasures the amount of the health problem that could\nhave been prevented if the risk factor had never existed\n(20). The differences between the baseline estimates and\neach of the attributable-risk estimates represent number of\nhospital admissions attributable to arthritis, current smok-\ning, and hypertension, respectively. Simulations were run\nseparately for all persons ages 45\u00ad74 and overweight per-\nsons ages 45\u00ad74. The scenarios are described in detail\nbelow, and the same procedures were followed for both\ngroups.\nAttributable risk scenarios. Arthritis eliminated. All\nNHANES III adults ages 45\u00ad74 with arthritis were identi-\nfied, and the dichotomous variable representing arthritis\nwas set equal to 0 for them (no arthritis); it was already 0\nfor other adults. The model was run with the new values\nfor arthritis while all other risk factors, including smoking\nand systolic blood pressure, remained at baseline values.\nCurrent smoking eliminated. All current smokers at\nbaseline were identified, and the dichotomous variable\nrepresenting current smoking was set to zero for them.\nFormer smokers remained former smokers and both smok-\ning variables remained at zero for true nonsmokers. The\nmodel was run with the new values for current smoking\nwhile all other risk factors, including arthritis and systolic\nblood pressure, remained at baseline values.\nHypertension eliminated. All persons with systolic\npressures of 140 mm Hg or higher (the category that de-\nfines hypertension) were identified and their pressures\nwere reduced to 139. Pressures of other adults remained at\ntheir observed baseline levels. It is important to note that\ntension was often treated aggressively and some NHANES\nIII adults had successfully reduced their systolic pressures\nto below 140 mm Hg. Others, although still hypertensive,\nhad reduced their pressures below what they would have\nbeen naturally. For these reasons, the estimates for hyper-\ntension are best described as showing the effects of \"resid-\nual\" hypertension; these estimates have been published\nRESULTS\nsmoking, and residual hypertension) was common in\nNHANES III adults ages 45\u00ad74 (Table 1). Approximately\nthe sample were current smokers, and 27.8% had residual\nhypertension. A substantial percentage of the sample was\noverweight (43.3%). Men were more likely to be current\nsmokers and women were more likely to have arthritis.\nwere more prevalent in the overweight sample.\nEstimates for all persons ages 45\u00ad74. Arthritis had a\nsubstantial effect on the number of hospital admissions:\nwhen arthritis was eliminated at baseline, the annual hos-\npital admission rate was reduced by 6.2%, or 8.1 admis-\nsions per 1,000 (Table 2). Eliminating smoking had the\nArthritis, Smoking, Hypertension, and Hospitalizations 545\nlargest effect on the number of hospital admissions. If all\ncurrent smokers had been nonsmokers at baseline, the\nannual hospital admission rate would have been reduced\nsion had the smallest effect on hospital admissions; its\nelimination was associated with a reduction of 2.3% or 3.0\nThe role of current smoking on the rate of hospital\nadmissions varied by sex. The impact of eliminating cur-\nrent smoking was almost 3 times greater in men (a reduc-\nwomen (a reduction of 3.7%, or 4.5 fewer admissions per\n1,000 annually). The effects of arthritis and residual hy-\npertension did not vary by sex.\nEstimates for overweight persons ages 45\u00ad74. At base-\nline and for each population attributable-risk scenario,\nannual hospital admission rates for the overweight sample\nexceeded those for all adults ages 45\u00ad74 (Table 3). Elimi-\nnation of arthritis and smoking had comparable effects.\nEliminating arthritis in overweight adults reduced hospi-\ntal admission rates at baseline by 7.4% (11.0 fewer admis-\nsions per 1,000 overweight adults), while eliminating cur-\nrent smoking was associated with a 5.8% reduction in\nannual hospital admission rates (8.6 fewer admissions per\n1,000 overweight adults). The elimination of residual hy-\npertension resulted in a reduction of only 2.7% in hospital\nweight adults).\nFigure 1 compares the reductions in hospital admissions\ndue to arthritis, current smoking, and residual hyperten-\nsion for all adults and for overweight adults. Of the 3 risk\nfactors studied, arthritis was the most important contrib-\nutor to annual hospital admissions for overweight adults\nages 45\u00ad74, while current smoking was the most important\ncontributor for all adults.\nIn the overweight sample as in the full sample, the\nimpact of eliminating current smoking in men was more\nthan twice the impact in women, and the impact of elim-\ninating arthritis and hypertension did not vary by sex.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study help establish the fact that arthri-\ntis has a substantial impact on the number of hospital\nadmissions. Although the estimates of hospitalizations at-\ntributable to arthritis for all adults are somewhat less than\nthose attributable to smoking, they are substantial and\nexceed estimates for residual hypertension.

The effect\nof arthritis on hospitalizations in overweight adults ex-\nceeded the effect of current smoking (7.4% and 5.8%,\nrespectively). Because arthritis is more common and more\ndevastating in this group, this finding suggests a need for\nmore targeted prevention and disease management efforts\nfor overweight adults with arthritis.\nA recently published cost-of-illness study comparing\nosteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and hypertension re-\nported findings similar to ours (21). Taking into consider-\nation both direct costs (physician visits, hospitalizations,\ntests, drugs) and indirect costs (time, lost productivity),\nthis study found that the total annual cost of rheumatoid\narthritis exceeded that of hypertension by more than two-\nfold. The total annual cost of osteoarthritis was also con-\nsiderably larger than that of hypertension (21). These find-\nings further underscore the impact of arthritis on health\ncare utilization and medical costs.\nOne study appears to conflict with our results. Ver-\nbrugge and Patrick, in a study that used national surveys to\nexamine the impact of 7 chronic conditions on health care\nutilization, concluded that arthritis did not have a signif-\nicant impact on hospital use (22). Although their results\nshowed that arthritis was the most common chronic con-\ndition for adults over the age of 65, and ranked first for\nlimitations in adults ages 45 years and older, the authors\nconcluded that arthritis was not a major factor in the\nnumber of physician visits or hospitalizations. This find-\ning is possible because in their study only principal diag-\nnoses for office visits and hospitalizations were consid-\nered, which would tend to underestimate the role of\narthritis (often as a secondary condition) in determining\nhealth care utilization. Our estimates include the effect of\neach risk factor as a contributing cause to hospitalizations\nthat may carry some other primary diagnosis.\nDunlop et al acknowledged that \"Regardless of the def-\ninition or the accounting method, the economic impact of\narthritis is substantial and rising\" (23). In 1997, arthritis\nand other rheumatic conditions were associated with\nvisits (24). There is consistent evidence that people with\narthritis experience higher medical costs than those with-\nout arthritis (23,25). In another study, Dunlop et al dem-\nonstrated that people with arthritis were more likely to\nhave a physician's visit, hospital admission, and out-of-\npocket costs exceeding $5,000 in the previous year, after\ncontrolling for age, sex, comorbid conditions, socioeco-\nnomic status, and other demographic factors (26).\nThere have been a number of recent policy initiatives\nthat address the impact of arthritis as a public health\nproblem. Healthy People 2010 contains 8 objectives aimed\nat reducing the societal and personal impact of arthritis\n(10). In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, in collaboration with the Arthritis Foundation\nand the Association of State and Territorial Health Offi-\ncials, created the National Arthritis Action Plan (NAAP)\n(27). The NAAP is comprised of 4 goals: 1) to establish the\nscientific base of knowledge regarding the prevention of\narthritis and disability; 2) to increase awareness of the\nimpact of arthritis and the importance of early diagnosis,\nmanagement, and prevention; 3) to implement effective\nprevention programs; and 4) to achieve the arthritis-re-\nlated objectives outlined in the Healthy People 2010 ini-\ntiative. These goals are a promising step towards alleviat-\nTable 3.
