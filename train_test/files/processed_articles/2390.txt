An emerging perspective implicates increasing consumption levels of POs as the primary system\nlevel driving factor behind the observed PO-related harms.

Consumption levels of POs were extracted from the technical reports published by the International\nNarcotics Control Board, while data for NMPOU was utilized from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\nAdditionally, data for PO-related morbidity (substance abuse treatment admissions per 10,000 people) and PO-related\nmortality (PO overdose deaths per 100,000 people) were obtained from published studies. Consumption levels of POs\n95% CI =0.165\u00ad0.929). Similar results were also obtained for PO-related morbidity and PO-related mortality measures.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that reducing consumption levels of POs at the population level may be an\neffective strategy to limit PO-related harms.\n",

Prescription opioids (POs) are mainly\nused as analgesics in the treatment of mild to severe\npain, including cancer and chronic non-cancer pain. In\nthe context of expanded pain care, their consumption\nlevels have tripled globally since 1990; however, this ex-\npansion has occurred almost exclusively in high-income\ncountries, particularly the United States, which has ranked\nhighest in per capita consumption of POs (based on stan-\ndardized doses) for the past decade [1].\nCoinciding with this expansion in consumption levels\nof POs in the United States have been several PO-\nrelated harms, namely non-medical prescription opioid\nuse (NMPOU), PO-related morbidity and PO-related\nmortality. For example, prevalence of NMPOU during\nthe past year has risen to almost 5% over the past decade\n[2]. Similarly, substance abuse treatment admissions for\n2010 [3], whereas there has been a fourfold increase be-\ndeaths involving POs [4]. Therefore, it is hardly surpris-\ning that PO-related deaths now surpass deaths related to\nheroin and cocaine use combined [5].\nGiven previous experiences with other psychoactive sub-\nstances, one perspective on this area of research, sup-\nported by emerging evidence from the United States [6-8]\nand Canada [6,9,10], implicates increasing consumption\nlevels of POs as the primary system-level driving factor be-\nhind the surging opioid epidemic.

Data within these reports were available in the\nform of defined daily doses for statistical purposes (S-DDD),\nwhich are technical units of measurements meant for stat-\nistical analysis, and which facilitate comparisons between\ndifferent kinds of opioids based on their potency [1]. In\nshort, calculation of this metric involves a series of suc-\nceeding divisions of the annual consumption of narcotic\nsubstances by 365, country population (millions) during a\ngiven year and defined daily dose [11]. Importantly, a\ngiven year is defined as the midpoint of its interval in the\npresentation of the data for this metric by the INCB [1].\nFor example, the estimate for 2010 represents the average\nPO-related harms: NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and\nPO-related mortality\nMeasures of NMPOU included annual prevalence of\nNMPOU during the past month, past year and lifetime,\nwhich were drawn from nationally representative surveys\nof the United States population: National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health Series [2]. These surveys define NMPOU\nas use without a prescription or use solely for the\nexperiences or feelings induced by POs [2]. Additionally,\ntwo other measures targeting the extent of NMPOU occa-\nsions were also taken from these surveys, namely average\nnumber of days per year per person of NMPOU among\nthe general population and among NMPOU users [2].\nThe PO-related morbidity and PO-related mortality\nmeasures were extracted from published studies [12,13].\nThe PO-related morbidity measure was substance abuse\nwhich was based on data from the Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration's Treatment Epi-\nsode Data Set. Though this measure has been previously\nanalyzed with S-DDD [6], it was included in the present\nstudy to provide a comprehensive overview of the harms\nof PO use in the United States. On the other hand, the\nPO-related mortality measure, PO overdose deaths per\nthe National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-\ndeath file. Importantly, the 2009 estimate for this meas-\nure was based on an imputation procedure, as data was\nnot available in published studies.\nthe consumption levels of POs, NMPOU, PO-related mor-\nbidity and PO-related mortality measures.\nAnalytic strategy\nThe primary analytic strategy involved the computation\nof Pearson's product moment correlations. As such, r-\nvalues and their respective 95% confidence intervals\nwere estimated for the correlations between consump-\ntion level of POs and each of the PO-related harms de-\ntailed previously, viz.: NMPOU prevalence (past month,\npast year and lifetime), average number of days per year\nTable 1 Consumption levels of prescription opioids, non-medical prescription opioid use, prescription opioid-related\nmorbidity and prescription opioid-related mortality measures in the United States from 2001 \u00ad 2010\nprevalence\n(past month)\nNMPOU\nprevalence\n(past year)\nNMPOU\nprevalence\n(lifetime)\nAverage number of\ndays per year per\nperson of NMPOU\n(general population)\nAverage number\nof days per year per\nperson of NMPOU\n(NMPOU users)\nSubstance abuse\ntreatment admissions\nfor POs per\nPO overdose\ndeaths per\npeople\nS-DDD: Defined daily doses for statistical purposes per million inhabitants per day.\nNMPOU: Non-medical prescription opioid use.\nPO: Prescription opioid.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/43\nper person of NMPOU (among the general population\nand NMPOU users), substance abuse treatment admis-\nsions for POs per 10,000 people and PO overdose deaths\nFindings\nFigures 1 and 2 visualize the relationship between con-\nsumption levels of POs and each of NMPOU, PO-related\nmorbidity and PO-related mortality measures included in\nthe present study. Table 2 presents the results of the cor-\nrelational analyses. Based on these data, moderate correla-\ntions were observed between consumption levels of POs\nand prevalence of NMPOU in the past month (r =0.74),\nsumption levels of POs were strongly correlated with aver-\nage number of days per year per person of NMPOU\namong the general population and NMPOU users (r =0.90\nand 0.72 respectively). Furthermore, consumption levels of\nPOs were very strongly correlated with morbidity and\nmortality measures, including substance abuse treatment\nDiscussion\nThis short report documented significant correlations be-\ntween consumption levels of POs and PO-related harms,\nincluding NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and PO-related\nmortality. These correlations are corroborated by evidence\nfrom several other American [8,9] and Canadian studies\n[7,10,11]. For instance, based on nationally representative\nWisniewski et al. also documented significant correlations\nbetween dispensing levels of two POs and NMPOU preva-\nlence and emergency department visits [9].\nFigure 1 Visualization of relationships between consumption levels of prescription opioids and non-medical prescription opioid\nuse measures.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/43\nHowever, the magnitude of three correlation coefficients\nobserved in the present study were noteworthy, as near per-\nfect correlations (r >0.90) were observed with consumption\nlevels of POs: average number of days of NMPOU among\ngeneral population, substance abuse treatment admissions\nfor POs per 10,000 people and PO overdose deaths per\nlinear increases in PO-related harms with increases in\nconsumption levels of POs. Such near perfect correlations\nhave been demonstrated previously for PO-related mor-\nbidity in the United States [6], but to our knowledge not\nfor NMPOU or PO-related mortality. Importantly, these\nfindings suggest that in comparison to prevalence esti-\nmates of NMPOU, average number of days of NMPOU\nmay be better indicators of NMPOU in the United States.\nThis may partly be due to the stabilization of NMPOU\nprevalence estimates over the past decade (p >0.05), and\nthe parallel increases (p <0.05) in average number of days\nof NMPOU over the same time period.\nBased on recent data, there seems to be a convergence\nof evidence implicating increasing consumption levels of\nPOs as the primary system-level driving factor in the sur-\nging opioid epidemic. Interestingly, consumption levels of\nPOs have continued to increase throughout the past dec-\nade, despite limitations in evidence regarding the effective-\nness of pharmacotherapeutic treatment of cancer and\nchronic non-cancer pain with POs [14,15]. For example, a\nreview on the effectiveness of long-term opioid manage-\nment for chronic non-cancer pain concluded that there\nwas only weak evidence to suggest clinically significant re-\nductions in pain [15]. Similarly, the evidence for effective-\nness of POs for cancer pain is mixed [14]. Given this\ncurrent state of the evidence, health policy must weigh\nbenefits of increased consumption levels of POs against\nthe PO-related harms, i.e. potential gains in addressing in-\ndications of pain vs. NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and/\nor PO-related mortality. There exists a need for rigorous\nreviews of clinical indications that legitimately warrant\ntreatment with POs in comparison to other alternatives.\nExperts must debate whether there is a genuine need to\ntreat as many individuals as currently treated with POs in\nthe United States.\nIrrespectively, the link between consumption levels\nand public health relevant harms of POs is similar to\nthat observed with other psychoactive substances, in-\ncluding alcohol and tobacco [16,17]. This link persists in\nFigure 2 Visualization of relationships between consumption levels of prescription opioids and prescription opioid-related morbidity\nand mortality measures.\nTable 2 Correlations between consumption levels of prescription opioids, non-medical prescription opioid use, prescription\nopioid-related morbidity and prescription opioid-related mortality measures in the United States from 2001 \u00ad 2010\nNMPOU prevalence\n(past month)\nNMPOU\nprevalence\n(past year)\nNMPOU\nprevalence\n(lifetime)\nAverage number of\ndays per year per\nperson of NMPOU\n(general population)\nAverage number of\ndays per year per\nperson of NMPOU\n(NMPOU users)\nSubstance abuse\ntreatment admissions\nfor POs per\nPO overdose\ndeaths per\npeople\nNMPOU: Non-medical prescription opioid use.\nPO: Prescription opioid.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/9/1/43\nthe opposite direction as well when the availability of\nPOs is decreased, i.e. reductions in availability coincide\nwith reductions in PO-related harms [18-20]. These\nfindings emphasize that increased availability of psycho-\nactive substances, including medications, should always\nbe considered in a broader context, encompassing both\na clinical and public health perspective.\nA key limitation of the present study pertains to the\ninability to infer causation from the correlations pre-\nsented. For example, closer surveillance due to increas-\ning public health interest may be responsible for the\nobserved increases in consumption levels of POs or PO-\nrelated harms, which would inevitably result in positive\ncorrelations. In summary, using data from the United\nconsumption levels of POs and PO-related harms were\ndocumented. These findings suggest that curbing con-\nsumption levels of POs at the population level may be\nan effective strategy towards limiting PO-related harms.\nAbbreviations\nPO: Prescription opioid; NMPOU: Non-medical prescription opioid use;\nS-DDD: Defined daily doses for statistical purposes per million inhabitants\nper day; INCB: International Narcotics Control Board.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAuthors SI, JR and BF designed the study; SI and JR managed the literature\nsearches and summaries of previous work; KDS undertook the statistical\nanalyses; SI wrote the first draft of the manuscript; KDS, BF and JR edited\nthe first draft of the manuscript; all authors have contributed to and have\napproved the final manuscript.\n"
