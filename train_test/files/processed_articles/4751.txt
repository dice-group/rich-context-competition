    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current Australian government is proposing an agenda focused around social inclusion in an attempt to address the\ncomplex issues associated with inequality evident in this country. Despite valiant attempts, many agencies struggle to offer\ninclusive services, particularly to families who have migrated to Australia from culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD)\nbackgrounds. In this study, we surveyed a range of programs identified by key informants as offering inclusive service\ndelivery with the aim of identifying those aspects of their practice they believed facilitated successful inclusion. We then\nattempt to position our findings within recently emerging critiques of the concept of social inclusion, of which our\nparticipants appeared unaware. This critique addresses the fundamental purpose of social inclusion, and the strategies\ncommonly used to achieve it, arguing that these are based on a deficit approach that positions those who are excluded as\n\"other.\" In identifying those who are excluded as \"other\" and attempting to include them into a hegemonic idea of civil\nsociety as functioning citizens, are agencies actually being racist?\n",

It will be\nargued here, that these principles should be grounded in\nrecognition, and a sound understanding of discrimination and\nsocial oppression to which these members of our society are\nexposed. They should also be informed by a value position\nwithin which diversity is acknowledged and celebrated, and\nwhere beliefs and practices different from one's own are held\nin high esteem (as originally defined by Sims, Guilfoyle,\nThis article discusses a research project that was contracted\nto develop a resource paper to guide practice positioned within\nthe Australian government's social inclusion agenda. We argue\nthat the Gillard government's social inclusion agenda at that\ntime was influencing the thinking behind provision of services\nfor children and families from CaLD backgrounds and that a\ngeneral acceptance of an understanding of social inclusion in\nthe government's agenda (Australian Social Inclusion Board,\n2011) as something that is \"incontestably good\" (Edwards,\n2008) needs to be considered critically.\nBackground\nSocial inclusion is often defined by its obverse, social\nexclusion, on the assumption that social inclusion is what\nsocial exclusion is NOT. Exclusion can be identified as\n. . . a complex and multi-dimensional process. It involves the\nlack, or denial of resources, rights, goods and services, and the\ninability to participate in the normal relationships and activities\navailable to the majority of people in society, whether in\neconomic, social, cultural, or political arenas. It affects both the\nquality of life of individuals and the equity and cohesion of\nDrivers of social exclusion include poverty, low income\nand income inequity, lack of access to employment, poor\neducational outcomes, poor health and well-being, lack of\naccess to social supports and networks, exclusion from\nservices, and social isolation (Department of the Prime\nMinister and Cabinet, 2010). When these risk factors\ncombine, they create a compounding experience of\ndisadvantage that is often self-reinforcing (Sims et al.,\n2008), frequently transmitting across generations. Migrants\nfrom CaLD backgrounds experience social exclusion in\nAustralia in most of these categories and therefore are at\nrisk of long-term and inter-generational exclusion.\nPrejudice can contribute to minority status and result in\nmigrants being more commonly found among the most\n1University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia\n2Edith Cowan University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nMargaret Sims, University of New England, Elm Avenue, Armidale, New\nEmail: margaret.sims@une.edu.au\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\ndisadvantaged groups in society (Hertzman, 2002).\nEvidence demonstrates that racism against migrants often\ncontributes to lack of confidence that prevents active\ninvolvement in the Australian community (Healy,\nHampshire, Ayres, Ellwood, & Mengede, 2007). As\nmigrants' qualifications are often not recognized, their\nemployment options become quite restricted (Sims et al.,\n2008). They are commonly under-employed, or\nunemployed. For example, analyses of the 2006 census data\nAustralians participate in the Australian workforce, but only\nChina do so. Nearly 70% of Iraqi women are not\nparticipating in the workforce.

The most\ncommonly reported difficulties were lack of Australian\nwork experience or references (56%), language difficulties\n(35%), and lack of local contacts and networks (29%;\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics, 2008a).\nThe Australian federal government policy on social\ninclusion (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,\n2010) acknowledges the above concerns and is an attempt\nto address the complex issues associated with inequality.\nThe government's aim is to create \". . . prosperity with\nfairness . . .\" which is to be achieved by the \". . . full social\nand economic participation of all Australians\" (Gillard,\nThere is widespread "
