    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nSince the identification of the gene responsible for HD\n(Huntington's disease), many genetic mouse models have\nbeen generated. Each employs a unique approach for\ndelivery of the mutated gene and has a different CAG repeat\nlength and background strain. The resultant diversity in the\ngenetic context and phenotypes of these models has led\nto extensive debate regarding the relevance of each model to\nthe human disorder. Here, we compare and contrast the\nstriatal synaptic phenotypes of two models of HD, namely\nthe YAC128 mouse, which carries the full-length huntingtin\ngene on a yeast artificial chromosome, and the CAG140 KI\n(knock-in) mouse, which carries a human/mouse chimaeric\ngene that is expressed in the context of the mouse genome,\nwith our previously published data obtained from the R6/2\nmouse, which is transgenic for exon 1 mutant huntingtin.\nWe show that striatal MSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons)\niological phenotypes to that of the R6/2 mouse. These\ninclude a progressive increase in membrane input resistance,\na reduction in membrane capacitance, a lower frequency of\nspontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and a greater\nfrequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents\nin a subpopulation of striatal neurons. Thus, despite\ndifferences in the context of the inserted gene between\nthese three models of HD, the primary electrophysiol-\nogical changes observed in striatal MSNs are consistent.\nThe outcomes suggest that the changes are due to the\nexpression of mutant huntingtin and such alterations can be\nextended to the human condition.\n",

The most studied of\nthese are the mouse models of HD, which have been shown to\nreplicate facets of the disorder (Bates et al., 2002; Hickey and\nemployed a number of different approaches for delivery of\nthe mutant gene and a range of promoters to drive\nexpression at various levels. In addition, experimenters have\nused either truncated or full-length DNA. The differences in\ngenetic context and resultant phenotypes of these models\nhave led to extensive debate regarding the consistency of\noutcomes and relevance to the human disorder. Often\ndifferent research groups have chosen a preferred model in\nwhich to conduct experiments, and findings from different\nmodels are not systematically contrasted. In a comparative\nstudy, we recently reported that similar electrophysiological\nsynaptic phenotypes were identifiable in cortical pyramidal\nneurons of three different mouse models of HD (Cummings\net al., 2009). The first was the R6/2, the most widely studied\nmouse model of HD (Bates and Hockly, 2003; Woodman et al.,\n1 Present address: Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, U.K.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email mlevine@mednet.ucla.edu).\nAbbreviations: ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; AP5, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; BIC, bicuculline methobromide; CNQX, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione;\nEPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current; GABAA\n, c-aminobutyric acid type A; HF, high frequency; HD, Huntington's disease; IPSC, inhibitory postsynaptic current; KI, knock-in;\nLF, low frequency; MSN, medium-sized spiny neuron; WT, wild-type.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\n2007), which expresses a truncated transgene consisting of\nsecond, the YAC128 mouse, carries the full-length HD gene\non a yeast artificial chromosome (Slow et al., 2003). The third\nmodel used a gene-targeting or KI (knock-in) approach to\ninsert a chimaeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 CAG\nrepeats into the murine huntingtin homologue (Hdh) and\nthus expresses the mutant HD gene in the normal context of\nthe mouse genome (Menalled et al., 2003). We concluded\nthat the basic cortical electrophysiological phenotype is\nconsistent across these models and is likely to be true for the\nhuman disease.\nIn the present experiments, we compared electrophysio-\nlogical alterations in synaptic transmission in striatal MSNs\n(medium-sized spiny neurons) in the same three models.\nPreviously, we described progressive decreases in the\nfrequency of spontaneous EPSCs (excitatory postsynaptic\ncurrents) and increases in spontaneous IPSCs (inhibitory\npostsynaptic currents) in MSNs of both R6/2 and R6/1 mice\nmice. We demonstrate that the progressive decrease in\nexcitation and increase in inhibition also occur in these\nmouse models and therefore likely represent a striatal\nsynaptic dysfunction in human HD.\nAnimals\nMice were obtained from our colonies at the UCLA (University\nof California Los Angeles). All procedures were performed in\naccordance with the USPHS Guide for Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at UCLA. Transgenic mice\ncontaining the full-length human HD gene with 128 CAG\nrepeats on a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC128, line 53)\n(Slow et al., 2003), maintained on an FVB/N background, were\nexamined at 1, 6 and 12 months of age. KI mice had a\nchimaeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 CAG repeats\ninserted into the murine huntingtin gene (Menalled et al.,\nwere examined at 6, 12 and 18 months of age.

Mice were\ngenotyped at least twice, once at weaning and again after\nexperimentation, to verify genotype. For all experiments, mice\nof both genders were used as there were no consistent\ndifferences between measures obtained from males and\nfemales.\nSlice preparation\nMice were anaesthetized using halothane and then decapi-\ntated, and the brain rapidly removed to ice-cold dissection\nACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid), containing 130 mM NaCl,\nwith a razor blade and glued by the caudal axis to the stage\ncoronal slices that included the striatum were cut.

Events with\n(IPSCs) were aligned by half-rise time and normalized by peak\namplitude. Events displaying complex peaks were excluded\nfrom this analysis. The decays of both EPSCs and IPSCs could be\nfitted with second-order exponential curves, and these were\nused to determine rise time, decay time and half-amplitude\ndurations.\nValues in the Figures are presented as means\u00a1S.E.M.\nNumerical values for the estimated parameters and sample sizes\nare indicated within the Figures. Differences between group\nmeans were assessed with appropriate Student's t tests (two-\ntailed, unpaired with or without Welch's correction for unequal\nvariance) or appropriately designed analyses of variance followed\nby Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Microsoft Excel and SigmaStat\n2.03 (SPSS) were used to perform all statistical analyses.\nRESULTS\nBasic membrane properties of MSNs\nThe basic membrane properties of striatal MSNs have been\nshown to be progressively altered in slices from R6/2 mice\ndifferences in input resistance or capacitance in MSNs of R6/\n2 mice were seen prior to the onset of the overt motor\nphenotype, while MSNs from behaviourally phenotypic mice\nshowed increased input resistance and decreased capacitance.\nWe therefore assessed basic membrane properties in the\nmonths, no differences in the input resistance of YAC128\nMSNs and their respective WTs were observed. By 12 months,\nhowever, a highly significant (P,0.0001) increase in input\nresistance occurred. No significant differences in membrane\ncapacitance were observed at any age. MSNs from the\nCAG140 KI mice showed no change in input resistance at 6\ndisplayed input resistances that were significantly increased\ncompared with their respective WTs. KI mice also showed a\nmonths, but no difference at 6 months.\nSpontaneous EPSCs\nWe next examined spontaneous EPSCs, which have been\nshown previously to have a progressive decrease in\nfrequency in MSNs of R6/2 and R6/1 mice with overt\nphenotype progression (Cepeda et al., 2003; Rossi et al.,\nmodels (Figure 1). When cell membranes were voltage-\nclamped at 270 mV and spontaneous currents recorded in\nACSF (Figure 1A, left), YAC128 MSNs at 1 month showed no\ndifference in spontaneous EPSC frequency compared with\ntheir WT counterparts. By 6 months, a significant reduction\nprogressive decreases in EPSC frequency were observed\nin the CAG140 KI mice (Figure 1A, right). No difference in\nfrequency was observed in CAG140 KI MSNs at 6 months\ncompared with WTs. By 12 months a significant reduction\ncompared with 6 months CAG140). This reduction with\nrespect to WTs was maintained at 18 months (P,0.01\ncompared with WT).\nEffects of BIC on spontaneous EPSCs\nA proportion of the spontaneous currents recorded at 270 mV\nin standard ACSF could be mediated by GABAA\nreceptors\nand/or the excitatory drive of presynaptic cortical and\nthalamic projection neurons could be suppressed by inhib-\nitory inputs from local interneurons. We applied the GABAA\nreceptor antagonist BIC (20 mM) to eliminate these\ninfluences. Previously, in the R6/2 mice, we observed a\nreduction of 10\u00ad20% in spontaneous EPSC frequency in both\ngenotypes (Cepeda et al., 2003). There was no significant\ndifference in the percentage change seen in WT compared\nwith R6/2 mice and, moreover, the reduction in frequency\nwas maintained. In the YAC128 and KI mice, a different\npattern occurred in response to BIC application (Figures 1B\nand 1C). In all cells from WTs, there was a decrease in\nfrequency of EPSCs in BIC. In YAC128 mice, however, some\ncells responded with a decrease in frequency, while others\nresponded with an increase (Figures 1B and 1C, left panels).\nAt 1 month, only one of eight cells responded with an\nincrease in frequency after BIC treatment, and the overall\noutcome of BIC application was not statistically different\nTable 1 Basic membrane properties of MSNs in YAC128 mice\nSample sizes are indicated in parentheses.

At 6 months, 36% of cells responded with\nan increase in EPSC frequency, but the overall outcome of BIC\napplication was still a decrease that was not significantly\ndifferent from WTs. By 12 months, 75% of cells showed an\nincrease after BIC application and the overall outcome was a\nsignificant increase in EPSC frequency (P,0.001). Despite the\nincrease in EPSC frequencies in response to BIC, the decrease\nin spontaneous EPSC frequency in YAC128 mice compared\nwith values in WTs still occurred at 6 and 12 months. At 6\nmonths, the effect was a trend that was not statistically\nThis differential effect of BIC also occurred in MSNs of\nmonths, in both WT and KI MSNs, BIC application resulted in\na reduction in frequency of EPSCs. At 12 months, 53% of\nCAG140 KI cells responded with an increase in EPSC\nfrequency and, similarly to the oldest group in the YAC128\nmice, the overall effect of BIC did not reach statistical\nfrequency seen in WT MSNs and the ,25% increase seen in KI\nMSNs, the difference in mean EPSC frequency was not\nmaintained in the presence of BIC in this group of cells. Due\nto the technical difficulties of recording from animals at 18\nmonths of age, the effects of BIC were not tested at this age\nSpontaneous IPSCs\nWe reported previously that two populations of MSNs were\nidentifiable in the R6/2 striatum. One population displayed\nan LF (low frequency) of IPSCs and was indistinguishable\nfrom WTs. The other population displayed an HF (high\nfrequency) of IPSCs, which were never seen in WTs (Cepeda\net al., 2004). When IPSCs were isolated at a holding\nmembrane potential of +10 mV in the presence of the\nionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (10 mM)\nand AP5 (50 mM), two populations of MSNs were again\nin the YAC128 mice (Figure 2, left), a small population of\nMSNs with an HF of IPSCs (P,0.001 compared with WT) was\nidentified, but only in transgenic mice. Unlike the R6/2, a\nprogressive difference was also observed in the LF popu-\nlation of cells. At 1 month, the mean frequency of LF IPSCs\nhowever, there was a significant reduction in frequency in\nthe LF population of cells compared with WTs (P,0.01 at\nThe changes in IPSCs were less pronounced and transitory\nin the CAG140 KI mice (Figure 2, right-hand panel). At 6\nmonths, no differences in the frequency of IPSCs, including\nno cells with HF IPSCs, were observed. At 12 months, both LF\nand HF cells were identified.

In contrast, Milnerwood and Raymond\n(2007) demonstrated faster spontaneous EPSC decay kinetics\nin MSNs of YAC128 mice at 1 month. In our hands, at this age\nno differences in EPSC kinetics between WT and YAC128\nneurons were observed (Figure 3A, left panels). At 6 and 12\nmonths, a faster decay time of EPSCs was observed (P,0.01\nand P,0.05 respectively). Rise time and half-amplitude\nduration were unaltered at any age. No differences in the\nidentified (Figure 3A, right panels). At 18 months of age, cells\nfrom these animals had EPSCs with faster decay times\nWe also examined the kinetics of spontaneous IPSCs. In the\nLF and HF populations of R6/2 MSNs, IPSCs were found to have\nfaster decay times (Cepeda et al., 2004) and this effect was also\nobserved in the two lines of mice studied here (Figure 3B). At 1\nmonth of age, IPSCs in the LF population of YAC128 cells\n(Figure 3B, left panels) had a faster decay time (P,0.05).

The reduction in EPSC frequency has also been\nconfirmed by others in the R6/2 mouse and the neurotoxic\n3-nitropropionic acid rat model of HD (Rossi et al., 2006).\nSpontaneous EPSCs were also studied by Milnerwood and\nage and, similar to our results, no differences in EPSC\nfrequency were identified, although there were changes in\nEPSC kinetics. Here, we extend the striatal data in YAC128 to\na reduction in EPSC frequency. Similarly, a reduction in\nspontaneous EPSCs has been observed at 6 months in a model\nof HD in which full-length human huntingtin is carried on a\nbacterial artificial chromosome with 97 mixed CAA-CAG\nrepeats (Gray et al., 2008). Similar to the present dataset, the\ncortical electrophysiological phenotype was demonstrated to\nmouse models of HD (Cummings et al., 2009).\nMSNs receive a major excitatory drive from the cortex, in\nwhich pyramidal neurons from almost the whole cortical\nmantle, but in particular the motor and somatosensory\ncortices, project to the striatum (Bolam et al., 2000).\nTherefore the reduction in EPSC frequency probably represents\na disconnection between the cortex and striatum, which is\nlikely to be mediated by the loss of spines and the presence of\ndysmorphic neuronal processes characteristic of both cortical\nand striatal neurons in HD (Klapstein et al., 2001).\nThalamostriatal projections also provide an excitatory input\nCorticostriatal and thalamostriatal terminals appear to be\nequal in number in non-disease states (Lacey et al., 2005) and\nmay synapse on to distinct populations of MSNs (Dube\n\u00b4 et al.,\n1988) and excitatory synapses formed by corticostriatal and\nthalamostriatal projections have differential electrophysio-\nHowever, the properties of neurons within the thalamic nuclei\nor their influences on striatal neurons have yet to be\ndetermined in HD.\nThere were commonalities and differences in GABAergic\nneurotransmission between the three models of HD.

In R6/2 (and WT) mice, application of a\nGABAA\nreceptor antagonist reduced the frequency of events\nrecorded at a holding potential of 270 mV, suggesting that a\nproportion of these events were GABAergic in origin. In\ncontrast, in MSNs from YAC128, a higher proportion of cells\nresponded with an increase in frequency upon GABAA\nreceptor blockade as animals aged.

Differences in EPSC frequency were detectable as\nearly as 40 days in the R6/2 model, while no differences were\ndetected until 6 months in the YAC128 and only at 1 year in\nthe CAG140 KI. These effects correspond to previous reports\nof phenotypic progression in the YAC128 and KI lines. The\nfinding that no difference in EPSC frequency was observed at\nthe youngest ages in any line of HD mouse models suggests\nthat presymptomatic HD gene carriers are likely to have more\nnormal excitatory inputs to MSNs. In contrast, IPSC frequency\nincreased in a population of cells in the youngest age group\nof YAC128 mice and a trend towards an increase in IPSC\nfrequency was evident in R6/2 mice (Cepeda et al., 2004), but\nno difference was observed in CAG140 mice. This suggests\nthat alterations in inhibitory inputs probably from fast-\nspiking interneurons within the striatum are affected at a\nmuch earlier stage than the excitatory inputs received by\nMSNs from cortical and thalamic projections. Furthermore,\nour previous data suggest that a cortical electrophysiological\ndysfunction may occur earlier than observed in the striatum\nand that the predominant cortical phenotype is an alteration\nin GABAergic neurotransmission (Cummings et al., 2009). As\ninterneurons are relatively spared in HD (Ferrante et al.,\n1985), there has yet to be a systematic electrophysiological\nexamination of striatal interneurons in an HD mouse model\nto determine whether and how they are dysfunctional.\nThe differences that we identified between the models\nincluded altered EPSC kinetics, an altered effect of GABAA\nreceptor blockade on EPSC frequency, and a reduced\nfrequency of IPSCs in a subpopulation of cells in YAC128\nand CAG140 KI mice that were not observed in R6/2 mice.\nThese differences may suggest that these alterations require\nthe full-length mutant huntingtin to occur or may reflect the\npresence of the transgene over a protracted period of time\nand would therefore not be observed in the R6/2 mouse that\nreaches end stage at approx. 3\u00ad4 months of age.

Also, the R6/2 mouse and a KI\nmouse carrying 150 CAG repeats showed consistent changes\nin molecular phenotypes when background strain and disease\nprogression were taken into account (Woodman et al., 2007).\nTherefore it appears that the precise HD gene construct does\nnot significantly alter the basic electrophysiological pheno-\ntypes observed in the cortex (Cummings et al., 2009) and\nstriatum.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that a full-length model\nsimilar basic striatal electrophysiological phenotypes to the\nR6/2 mouse, namely a decrease in EPSC and an increase in\nIPSC frequencies in striatal MSNs. The consistency of these\nphenotypes across different mouse models of HD suggests\nthat these changes are a result of the mutant huntingtin\ngene rather than being idiosyncratic to a particular model.\n"
