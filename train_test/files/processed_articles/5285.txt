In this paper, I argue\nthat the converse is also important: Developmental evidence can inform evolutionary\ntheory. In particular, knowledge about the developmental origins of a psychological trait\ncan be used to evaluate theoretical claims about its evolved function. I use the emotion of\ndisgust as a case study to illustrate this approach. Disgust is commonly thought to be a\nbehavioral adaptation for avoiding the ingestion of pathogens. Given this claim, disgust\nshould be expected to develop at a time when humans are especially vulnerable to the\ndangers of ingesting pathogens, during the immediate post-weaning period from about 3 to\n5 years of age. Despite a strong selective pressure at this point in development, research has\nsuggested that the emotion of disgust and the recognition of the \"disgust face\" do not\nreliably emerge until later in ontogeny, at 5 years of age or after. Given the late\ndevelopmental appearance of disgust, I re-evaluate claims about its adaptive role.\n",

Despite the broad range of these behaviors, all trigger a\ncommon aversive reaction: the emotion of disgust (e.g., Tybur, Lieberman, Kurzban, and\nDeScioli, 2013). Because disgust is such a multifaceted emotion, there are multiple\npossible accounts of its evolutionary origins. The most widely accepted functional\nexplanation is that disgust originally evolved to prevent the ingestion of pathogenic\nsubstances (e.g., Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley, 2008).1 I evaluate this claim using evidence\nAlthough Rozin and colleagues often characterize disgust as being rooted in abstract ideas about the nature\nor origin of \"offensive\" substances, they also describe it as functioning to protect the body from disease and\ninfection (e.g., Rozin et al., 2008, Table 47.1). Because protecting oneself from ingesting pathogens has\nobvious evolutionary significance, this survival-relevant function will be the focus of the present paper.\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nfrom developmental psychology and argue that this particular evolutionary account should\nbe further scrutinized, as it is not consistent with the current developmental evidence.\nIn particular, I assert that it can be productive to apply a developmental lens to\nevolutionary theorizing. Specifically, one can evaluate a proposed functional explanation\nby: a) predicting what developmental patterns and processes would fit that explanation and\nb) examining the developmental evidence in that light. In the current paper, I use the case\nof disgust as a concrete example of how ontogenetic evidence can be used to examine\nclaims about the evolved function of a trait. Several questions guide this analysis:\n1) Fitness value: During what age range should the evolved function of a trait\nafford the greatest benefits for survival and/or reproduction?\n2) Flexibility: Based on functional assumptions about the trait in question,\nshould the evolved design include a fixed set of evolutionarily prepared\nelicitors that develop similarly across varying contexts, or should the content\nof the elicitors instead be variable and primarily shaped through learning\nmechanisms?2\n3) Theory evaluation: Given the answers to the first two questions, does the\nevidence of the developmental trajectory and the flexibility of the eliciting\ncontent fit with the evolutionary hypothesis?\nCombining Evolutionary and Developmental Approaches to Psychology\nEvolutionary psychology has emphasized the importance of developmental\nprocesses since its advent, recognizing that \"nothing about humans could possibly be\nimmune from developmental intervention\" (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992, p. 80). However,\ndespite this theoretical emphasis, a focus on developmental processes has been slow to gain\nempirical traction, as the major advances in evolutionary psychology have historically been\nachieved by researchers studying only adults (although there are a few notable exceptions:\ne.g., Barrett and Broesch, 2012). This lack of developmental research is unfortunate, as it\nmay have contributed to misguided accusations that evolutionary psychology assumes\npreformationism and ignores the crucial role of ontogenetic development in shaping the\nKarmiloff-Smith and Thomas, 2005; Lickliter and Honeycutt, 2003; Ploeger, van der Maas,\nand Raijmakers, 2008). A greater emphasis on development will likely be helpful in\ndeflecting these criticisms in the future (see Bjorklund, 2003; Frankenhuis, Panchanathan,\n2 It is important to note that either possibility \u00ad biologically prepared content or content that is derived from\nsocially transmitted knowledge or other environmental influences \u00ad could be a solution designed by natural\nselection. Following a core tenet of evolutionary psychology, I do not draw a dichotomy between \"innate\"\nand \"learned\" traits, but rather acknowledge that learning and cross-cultural diversity can be products of\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nAlthough developmental psychology has also largely proceeded independently of\nevolutionary psychology, an increasing number of developmentalists are adopting strong\nevolutionary perspectives (e.g., Belsky, 1997; Belsky and Pluess, 2009; Bjorklund and\nparticular, several researchers have underscored the importance of developmental plasticity\nand gene-environment interactions as crucial factors underlying the emergence of evolved\npsychological traits, showing that genotypes may support a range of possible phenotypes\nthat are variably optimal depending on the particular environmental conditions in which an\norganism develops (e.g., Belsky, Houts, and Pasco Fearon, 2010; also see Belsky, 1997;\nIn addition, the emerging lens of evolutionary developmental psychology explicitly\nfocuses on applying an evolutionary perspective to explain and make predictions about\ndevelopmental phenomena. Evolutionary developmental psychology emphasizes that there\nare varying selection pressures at different points in development, and therefore children\n(and other altricial animals) at various ages will exhibit evolutionary adaptations that may\ndiffer from the adaptations that appear in adulthood (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000; Galef,\n1981; King and Bjorklund, 2010). Thus, evolutionary developmental psychology can offer\nfunctional explanations for developmental phenomena (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000;\nAnother way of approaching the integration of evolutionary and developmental\nperspectives is also possible: Developmental evidence can be used to evaluate theoretical\nclaims about evolved functions. Therefore, not only can evolutionary theories help to make\nsense of development (as evolutionary developmental psychology emphasizes), but the\nconverse is true as well: Developmental data can help to make sense of evolutionary\naccounts, which are often primarily based on evidence from adults. Accordingly,\nresearchers can use developmental evidence to rule out, or at least call into question, certain\nfunctional explanations. This approach can also help to highlight developmental\nexperiments that would provide evidence to support or challenge different accounts.\nUnfortunately, however, systematic attempts to pursue this strategy are lacking. In the\nremainder of the paper, I use the example of disgust to demonstrate and encourage the use\nof developmental evidence when assessing the plausibility of evolutionary hypotheses.\nThe \"Oral Origins\" Hypothesis of the Evolution of Disgust\nDisgust can be defined as an emotional reaction that activates the parasympathetic\nnervous system, generates feelings of nausea and a characteristic facial expression, and\nresults in the behavioral avoidance of a stimulus. This is importantly different from\ndistaste, which is a phylogenetically ancient sensory response to toxins that requires\ngustatory contact. Indeed, disgust is thought by some to be a uniquely human emotion\n(Kelly, 2011; Rozin et al., 2008), potentially because it is cognitively complex or perhaps\nbecause humans encountered new survival pressures when their diets become more\nomnivorous or when they began living in dense groups.\nA search for the evolved function of disgust has been a major focus of most disgust\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nresearchers. Whereas some have argued for various unique evolutionary trajectories of\ndisgust to account for the multiplicity of its current functions (Tybur, Lieberman, and\nGriskevicius, 2009; Tybur et al., 2013), I restrict my discussion to an investigation of the\nhypothesized initial function of disgust rather than subsequent exaptations. In particular, I\nfocus on Rozin and colleagues' prominent claim that disgust initially evolved because it\nserved as an effective mechanism for orally rejecting harmful substances (Rozin and\nOrigins\" account of the function of disgust as the hypothesis that disgust evolved because it\nallowed humans to avoid the ingestion of pathogens.3\nAccording to advocates of the Oral Origins hypothesis, humans may have had an\nincreased risk of foodborne disease and infection due to their meat-heavy generalist diet.\nThis would have made it especially advantageous to have a mechanism for the oral\navoidance of infectious substances. Support for this proposal has primarily come from data\nindicating the overlap between neural, behavioral, and physiological correlates of disgust\nand distaste, and the observation that the disgust expression is functionally suited for orally\nexpelling ingested substances and restricting the entry of external substances into the mouth\nIf disgust truly evolved as a food rejection system designed to protect the human\nbody from infectious disease, then disgust should emerge by the developmental time at\nwhich humans are most susceptible to the dangers of ingesting pathogens (e.g., Haidt,\nRozin, McCauley, and Imada, 1997; Stevenson, Oaten, Case, Repacholi, and Wagland,\n2010). During the first 2 years of life, infants in traditional societies are almost exclusively\nbreastfed and are usually carried and kept off of the ground, which protects them from\ningesting harmful microbes (Hrdy, 2011; Sear, Mace, and McGregor, 2000). However,\nevidence suggests that children are especially vulnerable to pathogens during the\nimmediate post-weaning period, before the immune system has fully developed (Dobson\nbased largely on the timing of the mother's next birth, but children are generally weaned by\nwhich is notably much earlier than in other apes (Kennedy, 2005).\nThe post-weaning period from roughly 3 to 5 years of age is therefore a crucial time\nduring which survival depends on the ability to avoid eating and drinking substances that\npose infection risks. Recent public health studies provide information about the causes of\n3 This idea is related to, but distinct from, several other accounts of the evolution of disgust, which posit that\ndisgust serves to motivate an increased avoidance of pathogens through all possible routes of infection,\nincluding skin surfaces and genitals (Chapman and Anderson, 2012; Curtis, 2011; Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie,\nal., 2013). The Oral Origins hypothesis departs from these hypotheses in that it focuses specifically on\nincorporating pathogens through the mouth rather than through other forms of physical contact. However,\nseveral of the considerations discussed in this paper also pertain to these broader conceptions of disgust as a\nmore general pathogen avoidance mechanism.\nEvolution, development, and disgust\ndeath during these early years. Although these data are only available at a country level and\nfor recent years, they can be used as a basis for educated guesses about the kinds of\npathogens that posed the greatest threats to children during human evolutionary history.\nOverall, evidence shows that the oral ingestion of pathogens and parasites from feces and\nother contaminated substances is a major cause of death in childhood, underlying diarrheal\ndiseases as well as hepatitis A, polio, streptococcal infections, tapeworm, and\ntoxoplasmosis (see Curtis, 2011). Indeed, global assessments of the causes of deaths in\nyoung children demonstrate that diarrheal diseases are among the greatest causes of\nmortality, accounting for 18% of deaths in children under 5 years of age (Bryce, Boschi-\nPinto, Shibuya, Black, and the WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group, 2005).\nBased on these considerations, the Oral Origins hypothesis predicts that disgust has\nthe greatest adaptive potential in early childhood and should therefore emerge early in\nontogeny. Additionally, it is reasonable to expect an early preparedness for experiencing\ndisgust at a set of core elicitors, such as feces and rotting meat, since these have universally\nand historically posed a reliable disease threat when ingested.4\nCriteria for Identifying Disgust\nBefore reviewing the developmental evidence, it is important to highlight a key\nmethodological issue: the difficulty of measuring emotional experiences. The obscurity of\nothers' phenomenological states is an issue that continues to plague philosophers of mind\n(e.g., Jackson, 1986; Nagel, 1974), and it also presents a major difficulty for psychologists,\nand perhaps especially developmentalists (Lewis, 2008). Because it is challenging to\ndocument the experience of disgust with the methods that are currently available to\nresearchers, any attempt to identify the developmental emergence of disgust is complicated\nby the initial challenge of defining criteria for its empirical operationalization. Ideally,\nmultiple convergent methods should be utilized; several of these are described below.\nResearchers taking an evolutionary approach to emotion, most prominently Darwin\npresence of an emotion. The Facial Action Scoring Technique (Ekman and Friesen, 1975)\nhas been used as a metric for measuring the early emergence of emotions such as anger\n(Stenberg, Campos, and Emde, 1983) and also disgust (Stevenson et al., 2010). Therefore,\none measurable sign that somebody is experiencing disgust is the \"disgust face,\" an\nexpression that involves a wrinkled nose, squinting eyes, and a gaping mouth. This facial\nexpression also signifies distaste, however, and therefore it can only be taken as evidence\nof disgust when nothing unpleasant is being tasted.\nSelf-report is another commonly used method for identifying the presence of an\nemotion. Because children demonstrate an understanding of the word \"yucky\" by 2 years\nof age (Bretherton and Beeghly, 1982; Fenson et al., 1994), this raises the possibility of\nasking young children to identify \"yucky\" things in order to explore whether this adjective\n4 It should be noted, however, that coprophagy is not unusual among certain other animals, including great\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nextends beyond distasteful substances. However, it is possible that this would only reflect\nconceptual understanding rather than an underlying emotional reaction. Additionally,\nwithin the current disgust literature, self-reports from children have only been used to\nidentify items as \"good\" or \"bad\" rather than specifically disgusting (e.g., Schmidt and\nBeauchamp, 1988; Stevenson et al., 2010), and therefore this evidence is not precise\nenough to demonstrate the presence of disgust.\nYet another way of measuring disgust is by examining physiological or neural\nindicators. For example, electrogastography has allowed researchers to measure gastric\nreactivity, with decreased stomach muscle contractions indicating greater disgust (e.g.,\nShenhav and Mendes, 2013). Additionally, fMRI has been used to explore neural correlates\nof disgust, often finding reliable activation in regions such as the anterior insula (e.g.,\nWicker et al., 2003; but see Schienle et al., 2006). However, measures such as these have\nnot been used with children.\nBehavioral avoidance has also been utilized as a measure of disgust due to its\nobvious functional relevance. However, avoidance alone is insufficient to demonstrate\ndisgust, as various other mechanisms can produce functionally indistinguishable behavioral\npatterns. For example, other negative emotions such as fear and distress are operative in\nmany avoidance responses (e.g., Gerull and Rapee, 2002). Additionally, avoidance may\nsometimes result from non-affective mechanisms. For example, inhibitory control allows\nchildren to suppress their motor responses and therefore avoid touching an appealing but\nforbidden toy (e.g., Carlson and Wang, 2007). Hesitancies to come into contact with certain\nobjects can also be driven by intuitions or beliefs about their negative characteristics. For\ninstance, human infants have natural tendencies to avoid touching potentially toxic plants,\nbut it is not clear that this avoidance involves any particular emotional reaction (Wertz and\nWynn, 2014). Finally, even though many other species faced with the threat of pathogens\nand parasites employ a range of behavioral strategies to avoid contact with common\nsources of infection like feces (Curtis et al., 2011; Hart, 1990; Hutchings, Kyriazakis,\ngenerally presumed to exist independently of a disgust response (e.g., Rozin et al., 2008).\nFor these reasons, I argue that avoidance cannot definitively indicate the experience of\ndisgust in the absence of other converging forms of evidence.\nFinally, another important issue to address is that disgust may not emerge as a\nsingular monolithic package, but might instead develop cumulatively, with various\nsubcomponents arising at different points in development and only eventually forming one\ncohesive mechanism. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that children experience other\nfunctionally appropriate responses to pathogen vectors before acquiring disgust. Though a\ncareful investigation of these issues is beyond the scope of the present discussion, these\ntheoretical possibilities are in need of careful empirical investigation.\nThe Development of Disgust\nDistaste has been documented in newborns by demonstrating mouth gaping in\nresponse to bitter substances (e.g., Rosenstein and Oster, 1988). However, a robust disgust\nresponse lags behind this considerably, and does not seem to be acquired by the onset of\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nweaning. On the contrary, developmental research has repeatedly shown that disgust is a\nrelatively late-emerging emotion, possibly not fully coming online until middle childhood\n(e.g., Rozin and Fallon, 1987). This evidence will be briefly reviewed below.\nTwo-year-old children are often willing to put just about anything into their mouths,\neven objects that are considered highly disgusting by older children and adults (e.g.,\nimitation feces), and young children are therefore generally regarded as completely lacking\ndisgust (Rozin, Hammer, Oster, Horowitz, and Marmora, 1986). One study has found\nlimited evidence of disgust toward oral elicitors as early as 2.5 years of age (Stevenson et\nal., 2010), but a close examination of these data raises questions about whether this\nresearch truly measured disgust rather than another avoidance mechanism (e.g., fear or\ninhibition), as the conclusions were primarily based on evidence of behavioral\napproach/avoidance. When taken through various revolting tasks, such as sniffing fecal and\nurinous odors and being asked if they wanted to touch live maggots or eat candy from the\nbottom of a new toilet, 2.5-year-olds avoided the items nearly half the time, and this\nincreased to 75% by 6.8 years of age. However, children below the age of 6.8 made facial\nexpressions of disgust to these same elicitors less than 20% of the time (much less\nfrequently than smiling), which increased to about 40% by 6.8 years (Stevenson et al.,\n2010). Therefore, even though very young children tended to be unwilling to come into\ncontact with disgusting stimuli, their behavioral avoidance and negative evaluations were\nnot often accompanied by a disgust expression or another more specific indicator of disgust\nand therefore cannot be taken as clear evidence for the experience of disgust. Additionally,\nthese data demonstrate that the disgust response becomes increasingly more pronounced in\nmiddle childhood.\nA separate issue that has often been closely associated with disgust is that of\ncontamination sensitivity. There is mixed evidence regarding the age at which this begins\nto develop (Rozin and Fallon, 1987; Siegal et al., 2011). Rozin and colleagues have found\nthat children under the age of 7 do not reject substances that have come into contact with\nobjects such as insects or used combs (Fallon, Rozin, and Pliner, 1984; Rozin, Fallon, and\nAugustoni-Ziskind, 1985). More recent research has suggested a much earlier onset of\ncontamination sensitivity, as young as 3 years of age (Legare, Wellman, and Gelman, 2009;\nSiegal and Share, 1990). However, this early emergence may be largely due to cultural\nscaffolding, potentially through explicit teaching about germs, as children in Western\ncountries have more robust hygiene-related behaviors than children in developing countries\n(Siegal et al., 2011). Additionally, although beliefs about contamination and feelings of\ndisgust are often linked, there is some evidence that contamination sensitivity may be\ndriven by ideas about magical contagion (Nemeroff and Rozin, 2000) or folk biological\ncausal understandings (Legare et al., 2009) rather than emotional reactions. Most studies on\ncontamination sensitivity have measured avoidance behavior rather than the disgust\nreaction per se, and therefore provide weak evidence for the emergence of disgust.\nAlthough little is known about how particular disgust elicitors develop in\nchildhood, there have been a few investigations of whether there is an evolutionarily\nprepared set of elicitors that universally elicit disgust in adults. Some studies have\ndemonstrated widespread regularities, with several substances (e.g., feces, vomit) appearing\nto be cross-culturally recurrent elicitors of disgust (Curtis et al., 2004; Curtis and Biran,\nEvolution, development, and disgust\n2001). However, these are likely to develop as a result of prepared cultural learning rather\nthan biological maturation (Curtis and Biran, 2001), possibly due to experiences such as\ntoilet training (Rozin et al., 2008). Other cross-cultural evidence suggests that most elicitors\nand remain very plastic throughout adulthood (e.g., Case, Repacholi, and Stevenson, 2006).\nFor example, food is used to establish cultural boundaries from very early in development\n(Mahajan and Wynn, 2012; Shutts, Kinzler, and DeJesus, 2013), and a range of different\nfoodstuffs may be considered delicious or disgusting depending on one's particular cultural\nexperiences (Herz, 2012). Although foods that are considered disgusting are often meat-\nbased and/or fermented, and therefore potentially carry disease in the absence of\nknowledge to the contrary, even foods as innocuous as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\nare considered revolting in certain places. Additionally, disgust is lacking in autistic\nchildren, who have impairments in social learning (Kalyva, Pellizzoni, Tavano, Iannello,\nthat handwashing and hygiene campaigns have had to be instilled as major public health\ninitiatives, and are often unsuccessful (Curtis, Danquah, and Aunger, 2009), suggests that\ndisgust at fecal-oral contamination has not been evolutionarily prepared. Overall, therefore,\nit seems that disgust has been evolutionarily designed to have a great degree of flexibility\nin content, which is likely facilitated by a social learning mechanism of some kind.\nHowever, disgust is not entirely malleable, and it is noteworthy that many disease-causing\nsubstances are regularly considered to be repulsive. It is equally noteworthy that many of\nthese substances (e.g., open sores) generally pose no threat of oral incorporation.\nMost researchers believe that the facial expression of disgust is likely to be the most\nimportant mechanism of the cultural transmission and parental socialization of disgust\nsome have suggested that recognizing the disgust face is the very foundation of developing\ndisgust (Widen and Russell, 2013; also see Harris, 1989). If children are acutely attuned to\nothers' disgust reactions in the first years of life, they should be able to obtain crucial\ninformation about the sources of dangerous pathogens from the context-specific facial\nreactions of local cultural authorities such as their parents.\nStudies have demonstrated that adults' facial expressions of disgust effectively lead\ninfants to learn that particular objects should be avoided (Hertenstein and Campos, 2004;\nMoses, Baldwin, Rosicky, and Tidball, 2001). However, these results are strongly\ninfluenced by ostensive cues that signal culture-relevant information, suggesting that the\nexperimenters' pedagogical displays may have conveyed norms rather than eliciting shared\nemotional states (Egyed, Kir\u00e1ly, and Gergely, 2013). In addition, these studies tested\ndisgust against positive emotions and therefore cannot demonstrate that disgust, rather than\nnegative affect, led to the avoidance. Differential findings with anger or other negative\nemotions are needed before strong conclusions about the specificity of disgust can be made.\nIndeed, recent evidence suggests that young children do not understand others'\nfacial expressions of disgust as actually conveying disgust. The recognition of the\ncharacteristic disgust face appears late in ontogeny, considerably lagging behind the correct\nrecognition of all other basic emotional expressions. Even as late as 7 years of age, most\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nchildren interpret a disgust expression as signaling anger (Widen and Russell, 2008, 2013).\nBecause it takes many years before the facial expression of disgust is interpreted as\nconveying the disgust emotion, there may not be a straightforward way for children to\nobserve what others in their culture consider disgusting until they reach middle childhood.\nThis suggests that when very young children see an adult display a disgusted expression\ntoward an object that should not be orally ingested, their learned avoidance is not occurring\nvia the disgust emotion in particular. Of course, this inability to recognize disgust in others\ndoes not mean that children cannot themselves experience disgust, but rather that social\nlearning about disgust elicitors will be hindered throughout early childhood.\nEvaluating the Developmental Evidence\nIntegrating developmental and evolutionary perspectives allows for an evaluation of\nthe Oral Origins hypothesis that goes beyond examining the apparent functional role that\ndisgust plays during adulthood. In particular, this evolutionary account can be evaluated in\nterms of whether the developmental trajectory of disgust is consistent with its hypothesized\nfunctional benefits. Recalling the three questions posed at the beginning of the paper, and\nframing them in terms of disgust in particular, we can answer as follows:\n1) Fitness value: If disgust evolved to prevent the ingestion of pathogens, its\ncontributions to fitness are not expected to be equivalent across the lifespan.\nRather, disgust should be especially beneficial to survival during the\nimmediate post-weaning period, between the ages of 3 and 5.\n2) Flexibility: According to the Oral Origins hypothesis, a universal set of\n\"core elicitors\" should be evolutionarily prepared for dealing with\npathogenic vectors that recur across all typical environments, and flexible\nlearning should be largely unnecessary in most cases.\n3) Theory evaluation: Disgust does not appear to develop by the point in\nchildhood when humans are most susceptible to the dangers of ingesting\npathogens. Additionally, evidence suggests that disgust evolved such that\nmany of its elicitors are primarily shaped through social learning, rather than\nbeing biologically prepared. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of the\nexisting developmental evidence makes the Oral Origins hypothesis less\ncredible as a freestanding explanation for the existence of disgust.\nOverall, the current evidence does not convincingly indicate that children have\ndeveloped the emotion of disgust before the age of 5. Although it is true that children under\nthis age sometimes avoid potentially disgusting substances, there are currently few\nempirical reasons to believe that they are experiencing an adult-like emotion of disgust\nwhen doing so. Because the content of disgust elicitors may be dependent on learning\ncultural information about what is locally considered disgusting, and because young\nchildren may be delayed in their acquisition of this information due to an inability to\nadequately recognize the \"disgust face,\" it is unlikely that disgust plays a major role in\ndriving young children to avoid ingesting pathogens. Instead, the selection of what and\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nwhat not to eat may rely more heavily on listening to trusted adults and imitating their food\nchoices, which does not require disgust (Lumeng, Cardinal, Jankowski, Kaciroti, and\nemerging computational mechanisms may also contribute to the avoidance of certain\ncategories of potentially harmful substances (e.g., Wertz and Wynn, 2014), and again these\nlikely arise independently of disgust. If future research confirms that disgust does not\ndevelop until middle childhood, this will suggest that humans do not benefit from the\ndisgust reaction at a time when the Oral Origins hypothesis predicts that it would produce\nthe greatest survival advantage.\nPerhaps the late emergence of disgust is due to a lack of necessary cognitive\nabilities or to evolutionary design constraints that prevent an early, unsocialized emergence\nof the emotion and the ability to recognize it in others. In addition, one might contend that\nmuch of the disease transmission that causes diarrhea and related diseases is waterborne or\nairborne, and therefore might be practically unavoidable or lack cues needed for the disgust\nresponse \u00ad but this argument would also constrain the scope of the fitness-enhancing value\nof disgust under the Oral Origins hypothesis. Alternatively, it could be argued that disgust\nis unnecessary in young children because parents' own disgust responses are sufficient to\nkeep their children away from pathogens (e.g., Curtis and Biran, 2001; Tybur et al., 2013).\nHowever, even though young children in small-scale societies are often carried around and\nfed exclusively by caregivers, they are also often given opportunities to experiment with\ntheir environments (especially after weaning), and therefore children still have the potential\nto occasionally put infectious substances into their mouths. Finally, one might reason that\ningesting a wide range of substances during early childhood would presumably strengthen\nthe immune system of surviving children, and therefore an initial lack of disgust could\nactually be adaptive (e.g., Herz, 2012). This fitness benefit would not likely outweigh the\npotential costs of overzealous pathogen consumption, however. The fact that diarrhea is the\nsecond largest child killer worldwide suggests that there would have been major selection\npressures for the emergence of disgust in early childhood if disgust is indeed a mechanism\nthat is primarily geared toward preventing the ingestion of contaminated substances, and\npresuming that diarrhea was also a major cause of child mortality in the environments of\nevolutionary adaptedness. In sum, the Oral Origins hypothesis cannot sufficiently account\nfor the available developmental data.\nOther Evolutionary Accounts of Disgust\nInconsistencies between the Oral Origins hypothesis and the current developmental\nevidence suggest that other possible evolutionary explanations of disgust should be\ncarefully considered. For example, one alternative hypothesis is that disgust arose as an\nadaptation for regulating social interactions rather than oral ingestion. In particular, disgust\ncould serve as a mechanism for behaviorally avoiding pathogen transmission from people\nwho exhibit disease-related cues (Park, Faulkner, and Schaller, 2003; Schaller, 2011;\nSchaller and Park, 2011). This hypothesis identifies an obvious selection pressure that\nwould have led to this uniquely human adaptation: Because parasite risk greatly increases\nwith social group size and density (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Poulin, 1995), prehistoric humans'\nEvolution, development, and disgust\nunprecedented move to living in close proximity with each other would have placed them\nat a higher risk of acquiring harmful microorganisms from other people. Research has\nconsistently demonstrated that disgust can be elicited in adults by presenting them with\nimages of people displaying signs of illness or morphological abnormalities, or by\npresenting them with scenarios of people engaging in deviant social behaviors such as\nincest, cheating, or blasphemy (e.g., Ryan, Oaten, Stevenson, and Case, 2012; also see\nFurthermore, individual differences in disgust sensitivity are predictive of negative\nattitudes toward outgroup members and people who behave in ways that are considered to\nbe non-normative (Hodson and Costello, 2007; Inbar, Pizarro, Knobe, and Bloom, 2009;\nNavarrete and Fessler, 2006; Terrizzi, Shook, and Ventis, 2010). Other functional\nhypotheses about the evolution of disgust are possible as well, and developmental evidence\nwill provide an important empirical tool for assessing their plausibility.\nConclusions and Future Directions\nCurrent evidence suggesting a late developmental emergence of disgust is\nproblematic for the Oral Origins hypothesis. Of course, further research on developmental\ntrajectories and acquisition patterns is necessary before confident claims can be made about\nthis account, as the developmental evidence is currently sparse and future investigations\ncould potentially uncover an earlier emergence of disgust, thereby overturning my present\nevaluation. However, if such additional empirical studies cannot yield supportive\ndevelopmental evidence, this will significantly diminish the plausibility that the Oral\nOrigins hypothesis can fully account for the existence of disgust.\nIn conclusion, a thorough consideration of the relevant developmental evidence can\nbenefit evolutionary psychologists investigating the legitimacy of various functional\nclaims. Although the present paper has specifically looked at disgust as a case study, the\napproach used here can substantially contribute to the evaluation of adaptationist\nhypotheses about a wide variety of other traits, ranging from the psychological (e.g.,\nreligious belief) to the morphological (e.g., bipedalism). Scholars evaluating competing\nhypotheses about the functional origins of a trait may find this method especially\nbeneficial. Overall, this approach can serve as valuable way to combine evolutionary and\ndevelopmental perspectives.\n"
