Drotar (1994) ad-\ndressed the issue of limited generalizability when clinic-based studies are used to\nstudy pediatric patients. Bias occurs because researchers miss eligible children\nand families who live within the catchment area but do not get included in the\nstudy. This population-based analysis, of a nationally representative sample of\nAmerican children, provides data to address Drotar's criticism of past clinic-\nbased studies.\nThe term cerebral palsy refers to a nonprogressive motor disorder, with\nresultant tonal and/or movement abnormalities and frequently associated disabil-\nities, that follows damage to an immature brain.

However,\nthese authors still estimate a prevalence of 2.3/1,000 live births, which is in\nkeeping with the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Study of\nschool age children (Yeargin-Allsop et al., 1992).\nEpidemiological studies of CP have been widely published and reviewed\nduring the past 10 years. The majority of these studies have addressed risk\nepidemiological research has explored the question of whether, and to what\ndegree, children with CP experience behavior problems. Behavior problems are\ncommonly reported by parents of children with disabilities, as well as by their\nphysicians and educators. We chose to address this question using a large (N =\nInterview Survey (NH1S) Child Health Supplement. This data set is particularly\nappropriate to address the question of behavior problems in children with CP\ncompared to those without CP as these data include children based on their\nparent's address and not dependent on whether they attend a specific clinic. The\nparents were asked a range of questions, including their child's health status\n(chronic and acute health problems) and their report of behavior problems. The\nfocus of this ongoing national survey supplement is to estimate the prevalence of\nhealth problems in children.\nSelection bias may be a problem with clinical studies in which subjects with\nCP are selected as cases and those without CP are sampled from another clinic\n(presumably with another health problem). Those included as CP cases, who\nattend clinics, may have more significant health problems either associated with\nCP or with other comorbidities, than do children with CP who do not regularly\nattend clinics. Selection bias may also affect a comparison group of children\nwithout CP sampled from other clinics. These children may have other health\nproblems that may result in an increased probability that they may develop\nBehavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 449\nbehavior problems. This inappropriate comparison may result in underestimating\nthe true association between CP and behavior problems. By using the NHIS\nChild Health Supplement we eliminate this bias by including children sampled\nfrom their communities and not from clinics.\nTheoretical Framework for Hypotheses\nOur analysis of a national data set focuses on the occurrence of behavior\nproblems in children with CP. We believe the presence of a physical disability is\ncompounded by social and emotional challenges. The causal pathway for the\ndevelopment of emotional and behavior problems is not clear. It is possible that\nemotional problems are the inevitable comorbidities of specific conditions of\nchildhood. It is also possible that some of the behavior problems are preventable.\nTo establish whether the behavior problems are preventable we must first deter-\nmine if children with specific chronic health conditions have different behavior\nproblems or different magnitudes of these problems. With this understanding we\nwill be able to design prevention interventions.\nThere is a notable progression in the magnitude of the association between\nbehavior problems and health conditions as we move from episodic to chronic\nand from non-central nervous system (CNS) to CNS-involved conditions. For\nover 20 years researchers have reported a positive association of childhood\nchronic conditions and behavior problems (Breslau, 1985; Breslau & Marshall,\nResearchers have reported stress, anxiety, and limited contacts with peers, re-\nlated to childhood diabetes, rheumatic disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, sickle\ncell anemia, and asthma (Billings, Moos, Miller, & Gottlieb, 1987; Daniels,\nMoos, Billings, & Miller, 1987; Noll, Bukowski, Rogosch, LeRoy, & Kulkarni,\nBehavior Checklist and found that children with chronic physical disorders had\nmore behavior problems than control children although the magnitude of their\nbehavior problems was not very severe. It appears that emotional adjustment is\nassociated with the severity of the condition and the degree of functional limita-\ntions experienced by the child (Billings et al., 1987; Fowler, Johnson, & Atkin-\nNHIS Child Health Supplement to assess the effect of chronic conditions and\nsocioeconomic factors on behavior problems in children, ages 4--17 years. Their\nresults indicate that \"rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top\n10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health\ncondition compared to children without a chronic health condition (95% confi-\ndence interval of 1.29 to 1.86).\" This result suggests that chronic conditions are a\nrisk factor for behavior problems independent of socioeconomic factors.\nThe literature on chronic conditions in children also includes studies of\nchildren with CNS conditions. Cadman et al. (1987) compared social and school\nadjustment of children with chronic illness alone to children with chronic illness\nand disability. The latter group, which included children with CNS impairments,\nhad more significant problems. Similar results were reported by Howe, Fein-\nstein, Reiss, Molock, and Berger (1993). They found that children with chronic\nillness without CNS involvement were more like the comparison children than\nchildren with CNS conditions. Likewise, Weiland, Pless, and Roghmann (1992)\nfound that primary care providers were significantly more likely to report that\nchildren with serious conditions involving the CNS had behavior problems\nwhereas those without CNS involvement were not reported to be significantly\ndifferent from normal children. These studies indicate that children with a dis-\nability involving the CNS are at increased risk for behavior problems compared\nto children with other types of chronic conditions.\nSince CP is a subset of chronic CNS conditions we reviewed the literature to\ndetermine if there are reports on the severity of the problem or specific behavioral\ndomains affecting children with CP. The prevalence of behavioral problems in\nchildren with CP and the nature of these problems have been reviewed by a\nnumber of researchers. The prevalence of disturbed behaviors or emotional mal-\nadaptations in different groups of children with CP have been reported to be from\nThe stability of behavior problems over time was described by Breslau and\nMarshall (1985) in a 5-year study of 255 children with physical disabilities.

In school-age children with CP, other researchers\nhave found behavioral problems including passivity, immaturity, and anxiety\nbloom, 1971). Based on the literature and our clinical experience we anticipated\nthat issues related to isolation and dependency could be problematic for children\nIn addition, we felt it was important to analyze the independent association\nof mental retardation (MR) and CP and behavior problems as well as the com-\nbined effect. Murphy, Yeargin-Allsopp, Decoufle, and Drews (1993) analyzed\nthe population-based Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Study and\nreported that 65% of the children with CP had MR. This confirmed our clinical\nimpression that these two conditions were often highly associated. Thus, since\nboth MR and CP are CNS conditions it would be beneficial to compare the\nbehavior problems associated with the two conditions.\nThe behavior categories used in our analysis were selected by Zill (1990)\nBehavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 451\nwho \"tapped some of the more common behavior syndromes in young people.\"\nThe same scale has been used in several published articles and the problem\nbehavior factors identified in this study are consistent with those in the literature\nThis study provides an analysis of data from the NHIS. It was designed to\nanswer the question: Are behavior problems identified by parents of children\nwith cerebral palsy in a nonclinical setting? The specific hypotheses that were\ntested are:\n1. Children with CP have more behavior problems than children with no\nchronic or acute health conditions.\n2. Children with MR have more behavior problems than children with no\nchronic or acute health conditions.\nMETHODS\nChild Health Supplement. The NHIS is a U.S. sample survey conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics since 1957. The survey staff conduct in-\nperson interviews with approximately 40,000 households. Information in the\nNHIS includes reports by adults about their health and the health status of their\nchildren as it relates to acute and chronic conditions and health services utiliza-\ntion. Supplements to the NHIS focus on special populations and health concerns.\ntheir children's behavior on the BPI. Children 4-17 years of age, whose parents\nreported that they had a diagnosis of CP, were selected as cases. The same\nprocedure was used to obtain children with MR, and children with other chronic\nhealth conditions (CHC). CHCs included chronic respiratory, cardiovascular,\nglandular, digestive, or other chronic conditions, excluding CP and MR. The\ncomparison group throughout the analysis was children without any chronic or\nacute health condition. We could only assess which behavioral problems were\nassociated with CP unconfounded by the presence of MR for the 1981 survey\nbecause the 1988 survey did not specify MR presence. The distinct category of\nMR was not included in the problem list read to parents for the 1988 interview.\nInstead children with MR were included in a broad coding category of neurologic\nconditions. Therefore, a subanalysis was conducted on the 1981 survey in which\nchildren with CP (and no MR) and those with MR (and no CP) we re compared to\nchildren having no chronic or acute diseases to assess their relative frequency of\nbehavioral problems.\nWe first assessed behavioral problems among all children with CP compared\nto children with no health conditions. There were 47 children with CP, 50\nchildren with MR, 6,038 children with some chronic health condition excluding\nCP and MR, and 5,930 children with no acute or CHC. We combined the\nnumber of cases. We felt this was justified since the diagnosis of CP is often\nmade before a diagnosis of MR can be ruled out. This second analysis, with a\nmixed groups of children with CP, is useful since it represents an actual group of\nchildren with CP selected from the population.\nMeasurement Instrument\nBehavioral problems were assessed in the NHIS Child Health Supplement\nusing a 28-item BPl based on parent report. The Index was developed by Zill and\nPeterson, based on numerous preexisting instruments (Achenbach & Edelbrock,\nHealth Statistics, 1971). The high reliability of the scale has been reviewed by\nnumerous researchers (Gortmaker et al., 1990; McCormick, Gortmaker, &\ntheir validation of the BPl based on its ability to discriminate between children\nwho were and were not referred for clinical help.\nParents were asked to report the frequency with which their children exhib-\nited a range of behavioral problems. Weighted scores were obtained for response\ncategories by assigning 2 (often true), I (sometimes true), and 0 (not true). We\nused the procedure described by Gortmaker et al. (1990) for dichotomizing the\nbehavior variables into the children in the bottom 90th percentile and those in the\ntop 10th percentile. Gortmaker et al. reported validity of the BPl and the 1981\nNHIS for children with chronic health conditions by correlating the scores on the\nBPl with parental reports of the child ever seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist, or\npsychoanalyst (r = .28). We repeated this method of validation for the 1981 and\n1988 children with CP, using our weighted scores, and found a significant\ncorrelation between the BPl scores and receipt of mental health services (r =\nreceived mental health services. Among those children who score in the top 10th\npercentile of the BPl, 49% got mental health services. Only 7% of all other\nchildren received mental health services. The 90th percentile corresponds to a\ncombined surveys using sometimes true or often true responses to behavior\nproblems. The cutoff scores for dichotomizing the specific behaviors, for 1981\nBehavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 453\ndependency 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Thus, the case definition for having a\nbehavior problem was established by high scores on the subset behaviors. In fact,\nat a minimum, a behavior problem was defined as having sometimes true re-\nsponses at least once for peer conflict, at least twice for dependency and antiso-\ncial, at least three times for anxiety, at least four times for hyperactive, and at\nleast five times for headstrong. This weighting was used for all of the procedures\ndescribed in the statistical analyses. The period of reference for reporting was the\nprevious 3 months.\nThe item composition of the Behavior Problem Index (all items) is as\nfollows: Antisocial: cheats or tells lies, bullies, cruel or mean; disobedient at\nschool; not sorry after misbehaving; trouble getting along with teachers (5 items);\nAnxious/Depressed: sudden changes in mood; feels unloved; too fearful or anx-\nious; feels worthless; unhappy, sad, depressed (5 items); Headstrong: high\nstrung; argues too much; disobedient at home; stubborn, sullen; very strong\ntemper (5 items); Hyperactive: cannot concentrate; easily confused; impulsive;\nobsessive; restless (5 items); Immature/Dependent: (4-11 years only) clings to\nadults only, cries a lot, demands a lot of attention, too dependent on others (4\nitems); Peer ConflictISocial Withdrawal: has trouble getting along with other\nchildren; not liked by other children; withdrawn (3 items).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe scores were calculated for the subscales and for a composite variable\n\"any problems,\" for the total sample, and for the subsets of the sample. The\nscores were weighted by the frequency of occurrence reported by the parent. The\n\"any problem\" variable was created by summing the subset scores. Frequency\ndistributions of demographic factors for the total sample and its subsets were\ncalculated in order to justify comparisons based on these factors. Chi-square tests\nwere used to compare the demographic characteristics for children with CP,\nchildren with MR, and children with a CHC excluding CP, and MR (chronic\ngroup) with children with no acute or CHC.\nMultiple logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios\nfor the relationship between selected behavioral problems in the three groups of\nchildren (CP, MR, and CHC) and children in the control group. Logistic models\nwere used because the dependent variable is dichotomous (presence or absence\nof a behavior problem) and the independent variable is discrete (CP or control).\nWe controlled for additional variables (race, gender, age, family structure, region\nof the U.S.). The result (odds ratio) can be interpreted as the likelihood of an\noutcome given a condition. Thus, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.4 can be interpreted as\na behavior being 2.4 times more likely to have a score greater than the 90th\npercentile of the overall sample, given a child with CP, compared to children in\nthe survey with no chronic or acute conditions (odds ratio of 1 is neutral).\nScores greater than the 90th percentile from the overall sample mean scores\nwere used as the cut point for each problem behavior. The following problem\nbehaviors for the 4- to 17-year-olds were assessed from the BPI: being antisocial,\nanxious, headstrong, hyperactive, and having peer conflict. Cases with missing\ndata for any of the variables were excluded from the logistic regression models.\nRace of the child (white, nonwhite), gender of the child (female, male), age of\nthe child (under 12 years of age, 12 years or older), family intactness (two-parent\nhomes, single parent or foster care), and geographic region of residence of the\nfamily (northeast, midwest, south, west) were considered potential confounders\nin the analyses (the risk groups are italicized). Dependency was assessed for the\n4- to 11-year-old children controlling for race, gender, family intactness, and\ngeographic region of residence.\nRESULTS\nthe 1988 sample. This increase in prevalence is consistent with the literature\nwhich suggests that survival of very low birth infants increased during the study\nperiod and this increase contributed to an increase in prevalence of CP over time\n(Bhushan et al., 1993). We compared the mean behavior scores for the sample of\nsurvey, the children with CP only mean score was 11.1 (SD 10.3) compared to\nsurvey, the children with CP mean score was 9.5 (SD 9.0) compared to children\nwith other chronic conditions mean score of 7.5 (SD 7.5).

In addition, children with chronic health\nconditions were more likely, compared to controls, to have antisocial behaviors\nand peer conflict.\nWhen comparing adjusted odds ratios for children with CP to those of the\nCHC group it is clear that children with CP have a much higher risk for behav-\nioral problems. Being dependent and headstrong are the most problematic behav-\niors for children with CP. Since children with CP and MR were not excluded\nfrom the analysis presented in Table III it is possible that those children with both\nconditions may be at increased risk of developing behavioral problems indepen-\ndent of the CP. For this reason, we conducted a subanalysis to evaluate behav-\nioral problems in children with CP without MR (CP-only group) and those with\nMR and no CP (MR-only group) compared with the control group.\nTable IV provides the results to suggest that children in the CP-only group\nwere 4.9 times more likely to have any behavioral problem than the controls.\nAnd the MR-only group were 7.9 times more likely to have any behavioral\nproblem than the controls. The comparison of the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for\nall these groups across the various behavior problems indicate that not all of the\nbehavior problems identified in Table III could be attributed to CP.

We found that 48.9% of the children with CP (n = 23)\nattended special self-contained classrooms and 29.5% received psychiatric ser-\nvices. Of the children with CP, 10 went to special school as well as received\npsychiatric services.

In total, 41 of the 47 children with\nother impairments or health problems.\nDISCUSSION\nThe primary focus of the present study was to identify behavior problems\nassociated with CP in children, using a population-based national survey and\nparent reports. This analysis is responsive to Drotar (1994), who called for a\nwider array of research methods and designs in order to provide replication and\nto improve generalizability of results. A limitation of previous research results\nfrom biased case accrual through tertiary care centers, and restrictions to the case\ndefinition of CP which exclude children with MR and other comorbidities. Our\nanalysis gives us insight into the complex challenges facing children with CP and\ntheir families.\nThe results of this analysis indicate that the previous estimates of the fre-\nBehavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 459\nquency of behavior problems may be exaggerated. Our finding that 25.5% of\nchildren with CP had a behavior problem, which is lower than previous estimates\nof 30-80%, probably results from our use of a national data source which does\nnot restrict the cases to children with CP who attend specialty practices or other\nwith CP who function well and receive little extraordinary medical care. Thus,\nthe sample used in our analysis is more likely to represent the wide array of\nchildren with CP including those not attending specialty clinics.\nThe general pattern of our findings corroborates previous studies suggesting\nincreased levels of behavioral disorders among children with chronic illness\nchronic illness with CNS involvement (Breslau & Marshall, 1985; Howe et al.,\n1993). Although children with CP are at greater risk for developing behavior\nproblems, across all dimensions of the BPI, they are considerably less likely to\ndevelop problems assessed by the antisocial and peer conflict scales. As a group,\nchildren with CP are at considerable risk for developing problems assessed by the\nheadstrong and the dependency scales. An examination of the item content of the\nheadstrong scale reveals a combination of noncompliance at home and mood\ncontent, whereas the dependency scale items appear to be more internally consis-\ntent. It is interesting to speculate about the possible antecedent conditions con-\ntributing to the development of problems in these behavioral domains. It is quite\npossible that parental management practices may be a contributing factor to these\nbehavioral problems. Headstrong behaviors, for example, may be the conse-\nquence of inconsistent disciplinary practices or the failure of parents to set\nappropriate limits in their management practices. Likewise, dependency may\nalso be fostered by the failure to teach skills which lead to the development of\nindependent functioning. For children with CP, the physical limitations may also\ninfluence their ability to function independently. Clearly, future research should\nbe undertaken to determine how parent disciplinary practices and parent-child\ninteractions influence the behavioral development of children with CP. Addi-\ntionally, research should also be extended to examine behavioral consistency\nacross situations (i.e., home, school) using behavioral rating scales and observa-\ntional methods.\nThe number of children with CP was relatively low in the NHIS since CP is\na rare event. Therefore, we are cautious about the interpretation of this analysis\nsince the number of children with CP with each behavior is small. Another\nlimitation of our analysis is that cross-sectional data can only show an associa-\ntion. Additional studies that have a longitudinal design are necessary to provide\ninformation about the development of behavior problems over time and causality.\nOur inability to separate out MR from CP in the 1988 data represents a\nconfound which, because of the data, cannot be addressed. However, since all\nthe behavior problems, except being headstrong and dependent, were more se-\nvere for children with MR (1981 data set) we believe that these behaviors, which\ncontinued to be significant and severe for the combined group, are truly problem-\natic for a mixed group of children with CP.\nOur analysis indicates that approximately 87% of the children had another\nhealth or school problem. The list of comorbidities was quite extensive, includ-\ning respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory, musculoskeletal, sensory, and other\nconditions. Other researchers have reported that the most common comorbidities\nfor children with CP include MR, epilepsy, and sensory impairments. The report-\ned frequency of MR in children with CP was 65%; 46% of children with CP had\nepilepsy, 15% had a sensory impairment (Murphy et al., 1993). For those with\nsevere mental retardation (1Q < 50) the percentage with CP ranges from 20-40%\nSome researchers question the use of a data set that is not designed specifi-\ncally for the study of chronic conditions, since the severity of the condition is not\n1989). The severity of MR and CP was not available in this data set and this\nshould be investigated in further research to discern how problem behaviors vary\nalong this dimension.\nAnother limitation of this study is the sole reliance upon parents as the\nsource of the child's adjustment. Wallander et al. (1988) suggested that maternal\nperception of child behavior is probably dependent on certain child and maternal\ncharacteristics. Future research should seek to validate parent reports using other\ninformants such as professionals and teachers, and behavioral observation sched-\nules. Another approach to validation is to identify the correlation between high\nscores (above the 90th percentile) and referral to counseling services. We found\nthat 7 of the 12 children with CP who had scores above the 90th percentile for\nbehavior problems were referred to psychologists, psychiatrists, and other coun-\nselors. This validation of the Behavior Problem Index used for the 1981 NH1S\nwas reported previously by Gortmaker et al. (1990).\nThe implications of this analysis are multifaceted. It is clear that parents\nperceive some behavior problems are associated with CP in children. Although a\nsubstantial proportion of children with CP experience significant behavioral\nproblems, our findings also reveal most do not develop such problems. Addition-\nal research, therefore, needs to focus on identifying protective factors related to\nchildren and their environments that may reduce the risk of developing the onset\nof behavioral problems. These factors could include social support networks and\nschool placements. Finally, research needs to address the effectiveness of antici-\npatory guidance, therapeutic effects of ongoing interventions for the disability\n(e.g., occupational, physical, and speech and language therapy), and psychologi-\ncal counseling for the children and/or families.\nBehavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 461\nThis study adds a population-based analysis to the literature on behavior\nproblems associated with childhood cerebral palsy. Breslau (1985) reported that\n\"brain involvement conferred a risk for social isolation independent of mental\nretardation\" for 98 children with CP who were seen in teaching hospital clinics.\nWe suggest that perhaps social isolation is a problem associated with children\nwith severe CP. Our results imply that dependency and headstrong behaviors are\nchallenges faced by a diverse and, therefore, representative group of children\nwith CP.\nREFERENCES\nAchenbach, T. M., & Edelbrock, C.
