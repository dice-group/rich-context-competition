The main purpose of the programme is to contribute\nto the long-term development of the Mediterranean area\nand to strengthen transnational cooperation among peoples\nof 57 regions in 10 different EU member states and 3 can-\ndidate countries (MED Programme, 2015a).\nIn 2013, the MED Programme launched its eighth and\nThe objective of this call was to facilitate an adequate\nresponse to the maritime development priorities of the\nMediterranean by addressing several key challenges such\nas `maritime innovation and economic development',\n`environment protection', `transport and accessibility' and\n`governance and policy response' (MED Programme,\nwere approved being Bluene1 and Enercoast2 the two pro-\njects specifically tackling marine renewable energy (MRE)\nand renewable energy in coastal areas. Selected projects\nand beneficiary partners assumed not only the mission to\naddress key maritime challenges in the Mediterranean area\nbut also to set up the bases for the continuation of activities\nConcerning MRE,3 its theoretical potential for electric-\ndemand of electricity (International Energy Agency (IEA),\n2013). Besides its huge potential, other advantages attrib-\nuted to MRE are as follows: contribution to energy inde-\npendency from indigenous resources, CO2\nemission free\npower, complement to other onshore renewable sources\n(International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2014)\nMED Programme and transnational\ncooperation contributions to marine\nrenewable energy in the Mediterranean\narea: What next?\nJavier Gomez Prieto1 and Natalia Caldes2\n Keywords\nEuropean Territorial Cooperation, Interreg, EU Regional Policy, Mediterranean area, blue energy\n1Joint Secretariat, MED Programme, Marseilles, France\n2Energy Systems Analysis Unit, CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain\nCorresponding author:\nJavier Gomez Prieto, Joint Secretariat, MED Programme, 13 Boulevard\nEmail: jagomez@regionpaca.fr\nSpecial Issue Article\n96 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\nthroughout the supply chain of the marine energy sector by\nIn Europe, although MRE technologies are still in the\nResearch and Development (R&D) phase, wave and tidal\nenergy could provide up to 100\nGW of installed capacity\nresources, the Atlantic arc is the most favourable area for\nocean energy but the Mediterranean also counts on poten-\ntial for MRE implementation (EC, 2014b).\nTherefore, given the existing challenges and the magni-\ntude of the untapped MRE potential, the aim of this article\nis to analyse the contributions of ETC to the deployment of\nMRE in the Mediterranean. For this purpose, the experi-\nence of the MED Programme throughout the Bluene and\nEnercoast projects was studied by comparing their obtained\nresults against the defined EU roadmap and the actions\nneeded to overcome the existing burdens for MRE deploy-\nment in Mediterranean. The added value of this work lies\non a joint analysis of two different projects including their\nresults relevance and their continuation potential in the\nness for European policy decision-making.\nMethodological framework\nThe methodological approach of this work is based on three\nsteps: first, identification of key challenges and roadmaps\nfor MRE deployment based on a thorough literature review;\nsecond, an analysis of results achieved by Bluene and\nEnercoast projects, as well as their potential to contribute to\novercome existing hurdles and thus stimulate the deploy-\nment of MRE in Mediterranean; and third, the identification\nof links between results of analysed projects with current\nEuropean strategy of reference for blue energy. Finally,\nbased on the findings from these two evaluations, conclu-\nsions suggest how European Transnational Cooperation can\nenhance MRE implementation in the Mediterranean.\nKey challenges, barriers and roadmap\nfor MRE\nCompared to other forms of renewable energy, most of the\nMRE potential remains untapped because of the various\nbarriers that persist. For this situation to change, there is a\nneed to better understand the complex hurdles to ocean\nenergy technology deployment and to engage interna-\ntional community and various stakeholders to work\ntogether aiming at enabling conditions to unleash its\npotential. Accordingly, various institutions have done\nremarkable efforts to identify and document what are the\nmost immediate barriers (technical, administrative and\nregulatory), as well as required actions to overcome them\n(see for instance policy priorities in IRENA (2014) and\nIn the European Union context, the Directorate General\nfor Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG MARE) has car-\nried out an impact assessment of policy options for MRE\ndeployment and identified as main challenges: (a) the need\nto strengthening the EU's transmission grid infrastructure,\n(b) high technology costs and difficult access to finance,\n(c) integration of MRE in maritime spatial planning\n(MSP), (d) simplifying licensing procedures, (e) better\nexchange of information on the environmental impacts\nand (f) assuring grant and revenue support (EC, 2014a).\nDG MARE has also initiated an action plan in order to help\nunblock the potential of ocean energy for the coming years\n(see Table 1).\nETC as driver of blue energy in the\nMediterranean: the case of Bluene\nand Enercoast projects\nETC is a key objective of the EU Cohesion Policy and\nallows partners of different regions and countries to iden-\ntify and implement good practices, develop joint\napproaches and define methodologies around common\nchallenges in key issues such as among others, innovation,\ngovernance and sustainable energy.

Under a capitalisation approach,\nfuture projects and initiatives addressing blue energy in\nthe Mediterranean should improve what was achieved or\nto create new and innovative solutions based on already\nacquired experiences.\nImproving what exists could, for instance, imply enrich-\ning and/or keep feeding the obtained databases gathering\ninformation on (a) MRE existent technologies; (b) interna-\ntional conferences on research, policy and cooperation\nissues; (c) legislation frameworks of reference; and (d)\nexistent projects already co-financed by European and\nnational funding.\nNew and innovative solutions may involve designing\nstrategies to address identified key priorities for MRE\ndeployment in Mediterranean (see Figure 1) such as\nimproving financing and developing knowledge on MSP\nand integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) (Bluene\nLinking achieved results to European\naction plan for blue energy\nAs indicated in section `Key challenges, barriers and\nroadmap for MRE', the EC throughout its Directorate for\nTable 2.

Key priorities of marine renewable energy in the Mediterranean.\n98 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\nMaritime affairs and Fisheries is developing action plan\nfor stimulating deployment of blue energy. The plan is cur-\nrently in its first phase with the implementation of the\nocean forum discussions which will support the design of\na blue energy roadmap expected for 2016.\nAs the forum is open to all type of stakeholders and\nactors addressing blue energy, Enercoast and Bluene pro-\njects provide specific elements of analysis for MRE sup-\nport in the Mediterranean sea. The key messages of both\nprojects are summarised as follows according to the three\nestablished workstreams of reference.\nTechnology and resource workstream\nOffshore wind industry is mature enough to expand in the\nMediterranean sea, like in Northern Europe. Current and\ntidal turbines are also developed, but they are not suitable\nfor areas characterised by low current/tidal velocities\nexistent in the Mediterranean sea. As a very general\napproach to the issue, the more favourable places for blue\nenergy investments are the gulfs of Lions in France, the\nMessina straight in Italy and the coastal areas of Aegean\nand Ionian seas.\nThe two most important actors to facilitate MRE\ndeployment in the Mediterranean are governments, and\nindustry and technology sectors. Governors should imple-\nment stable and reasonable legislation to guarantee appro-\npriated frameworks as well as promote the efficient use of\navailable resources (human, technical and natural). At the\nsame time, industry and technology actors provide exper-\ntise and enable testing process of new technologies adapted\nto Mediterranean conditions. Actions from other actors\n(e.g. research, non-governmental organisations (NGOs)\nand media) can also play an important role in the progress\nof blue energy projects.\nClusters are very appropriate vehicles for the promotion\nof blue energy and increase of the competitiveness of the\ninvolved industries. Moreover, synergies between public\nand private actors should be established as a way to access\nmore stable funding opportunities. In addition, the differ-\nent analyses undertaken have shown serious gaps in rela-\ntion to the potential of energy sources, the diffusion of\nenergy plants and the lack of cost-benefit analyses.\nAdministrative issues and finance workstream\nIn the Mediterranean, there exist several funding channels\nto support research, technical and promotional activities\nEU programmes will allocate investments to promote\nMRE through research and innovation (e.g. Horizon 2020\nProgramme), environment (LIFE Programme) and coop-\neration (Interreg Programmes). However, a key challenge\nremains in the capitalisation of already co-financed initia-\ntives so as to build upon existent results.\nThe renewable energy sector (onshore) provides legal\nand administrative experience for the deployment of MRE\ntechnologies. Lessons learnt should be integrated as key\nreference in new blue paths for instance by adapting related\npolicies, integrating actors and discovering synergies from\na technical and administrative point of view.\nThe involvement of the private sector and of all other\ninvolved stakeholders (local and regional institutions, gov-\nernments, universities and economic associations) is\nessential to overcome the technical and non-technical bar-\nriers that jeopardise the effective diffusion of MRE.\nEnvironment workstream\nMSP and ICZM should be addressed first as a way to\nunblock MRE in the Mediterranean. The integration of\nblue energy projects with other activities (aquaculture,\ndesalinisation and tourism) should be addressed within a\nholistic approach. Blue energy chain needs to be further\nanalysed in order to design strategies to fulfil identified\ngaps in the Mediterranean sea.\nThe definition of protocols, plans and laws for the\nimplementation and installation of blue energy projects\nshould be done according to available resources and in\ncoherence with the protection of the environment. The par-\nticular promotion of MRE on key territories such as islands\ncould imply additional benefits to local communities while\nimproving social acceptance.\nAwareness raising activities, associated tools and com-\nmunication strategies should be improved to demonstrate\nconcrete benefits to several types of stakeholders ranging\nfrom end-users to policy makers.\nAdapted roadmap for the Mediterranean\ndriven by cooperation\nThe analysed state of the art of MRE in the Mediterranean\narea indicates substantial differences with respect to devel-\nopments and characteristics of other European seas (e.g.\nAtlantic and Baltic). Accordingly, European policies\naddressing blue energy should consider specific regional\nchallenges in order to effectively facilitate MRE support.\nThe Transnational MED Programme through Bluene\nand Enercoast projects has identified key action lines to\novercome barriers for blue energy projects in coming\nyears. These action lines represent the common vision of\nstakeholders engaged in related cooperation processes and\ntherefore should be considered in the design of future blue\nstrategies adapted for the Mediterranean:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Identification of suitable locations for new blue\nenergy technologies;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Clusterisation and creation of value chains;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Elaboration of MSP and ICZM;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Efficient transmission of the energy produced;\nGomez Prieto and Caldes 99\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Increase health and safety of blue energy projects;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Improve financing for the development of blue\nenergy projects;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Develop zones for testing technologies;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Assessment of environmental impacts and effects\nof blue energy technologies.\nConclusion\nETC is a strategic instrument of the EU Cohesion Policy\nable to address regional challenges such as the deployment\nof MRE in the Mediterranean. The MED Programme pro-\njects Bluene and Enercoast have delivered useful outputs\nhighlighting the barriers and priorities to be addressed and\nsuggested key cooperation frameworks to give continuity\nto what has been achieved.\nThe capitalisation approach and new projects' architec-\nture developed by the MED Programme will facilitate the\ncontinuation of further steps towards supplementary\nsynergies are also possible (and expected) with other ini-\ntiatives, projects and funding channels of reference in the\nMediterranean identified by analysed projects.\nProjects' results were obtained in a crucial moment\nwhere EU strategy on blue energy is being built.\nAccordingly, ETC results can be used as significant input\nfor policy-making process not only at sub-national,\nnational or regional level but also at European scale.\nNevertheless, an adapted MRE roadmap for the\nMediterranean should include ETC as a driving force able\nto compile and share visions of several actors, as well as a\nway to enhance political and industry coordination.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
