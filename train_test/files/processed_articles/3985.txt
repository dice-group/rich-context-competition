    "abstract": "Abstract\nScientific work on national election forecasting has become most developed for the United States case, where three\ndominant approaches can be identified: Structuralists, Aggregators, and Synthesizers. For European cases, election\nforecasting models remain almost exclusively Structuralist. Here we join together structural modeling and aggregate\npolling results, to form a hybrid, which we label a Synthetic Model. This model contains a political economy core, to\nwhich poll numbers are added (to tap omitted variables). We apply this model to a sample of three Western European\ncountries: Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. This combinatory strategy appears to offer clear forecasting gains,\nin terms of lead and accuracy.\n",

Next to that\napproach, there is also a stream of atheoretical efforts to\npredicting election outcomes, which mainly focus on reduc-\ning the error of forecasts. This article adopts an innovative\nsynthetic approach to predict the outcome of elections in\nEurope by combining structural predictions with informa-\ntion from polls. We find that polls do not add much to the\npredictive value of sound structural models of vote choice,\nbut that approaches which balance theory, data, and time\nconsiderations forecast elections best.\nWe adopt the categorization of dominant scientific\napproaches that emerged in the pivotal 2012 US presiden-\ntial election, sorting forecasters according to three2 labels:\nStructuralists, Aggregators, and Synthesizers (Lewis-Beck\nand Stegmaier, 2014a). These approaches can be differenti-\nated by their application of theory, data, and time. The\nretical model of the election outcome. They usually begin\nwith a core political economy explanation, such as vote = f\n(presidential popularity, economic growth). The unit of\nanalysis tends to be the nation and the estimation is ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) on single equations. Furthermore,\nthis estimation is static, rather than dynamic, resulting in a\nunique final forecast.\nIn contrast, the Aggregators (Blumenthal, 2014;\ntions in opinion polls. A well-known example comes\nfrom Real Clear Politics, with its voter preferences (per-\ncentages) combined over a number of multiple polls.\nUnlike the Structuralists, the Aggregators offer no the-\nory of the vote, but the unit of analysis is still usually the\nnation. Further, unlike the Structuralists, forecasting by\nAggregators is dynamic, with repeated estimates across\nthe campaign.\nTaking a different approach, the Synthesizers (e.g.\nborrow from both the Structuralists and the Aggregators.\nThey start with a political economy theory of the vote, and\nemploy aggregated and ongoing polling preferences as\nwell. They analyze data either at the national level or the\nstate level. The analysis may include multiple equations\nForecasting elections in Europe:\nSynthetic models\nMichael S.

Forecasts are updated, with repeated\nestimates across the campaign. In sum, these models join\nelection theory with the strengths of aggregation and\ndynamic updating. Synthetic modeling will be the focus of\nour European analyses here. In terms of general approach,\nthe Synthetic Model operates much like contemporary\nweather forecasting models. The fundamental variables\ngoverning the atmosphere (the electorate) first generate an\nevent forecast, say a rain storm (an election). That forecast\nis subsequently checked against additional, incoming infor-\nmation, as the storm pattern (or vote intentions) is tracked.\nThus, the initial forecast is updated, and modified regularly\nby ever more current forecasts. The process then becomes\ndynamic (on this weather analogy, see Lewis-Beck and\nElection forecasting in Europe: the\nstate-of-the-art\nWhat is the state-of-the-art with respect to election fore-\ncasting in Europe? Structuralists dominate, as is clear from\nthe work of Whiteley (2005) on the UK, Nadeau et al.\nGermany, Dassonneville and Hooghe (2012) on Belgium\nand Magalh\u00e3es et al. (2012) on Spain. These models tend to\nbe based on a political economic theory of voting. The\nmodeling is single-country, single-equation OLS work.\nEstimation remains static, with one unique forecast issued.\nThe unit of analysis is usually, but not always, the nation.\nFrench example, with the unit of analysis being the region,\nrather than nation:\n= + - +\n- = =\n. * . * . *\n-\n( )\nwhere V = legislative vote share of parties on the left, first-\nround; P = popularity of parties on the left, SOFRES polls,\nthree months prior to the election; E = regional unemploy-\nment rate, from the quarter before the election. (Note that\nthe model fits the French data about as well as it fits US\ndata of the same sort.)\nWhat about Aggregators? This approach, where polls\nare combined and systematically used to forecast, is almost\nnon-existent in Europe.3 However, using individual polls\non vote intention to forecast represents a long-standing tra-\ndition, especially within the media. In the UK in particular,\nthere has been plentiful work in the aggregator tradition\nWhat about Synthesizers? We know of no examples of\nSynthetic Models for a general national election in Europe.\nThis piece is the first attempt to build such a Synthetic\nModel.\nBuilding synthetic models to forecast\nEuropean national elections\nOur aim is to combine a sound Structural Model with a\nsound Aggregate Polling Model, so forming a hybrid--a\nSynthetic Model--which can forecast national election\noutcomes (incumbent vote share Vt\n) accurately across a\nsample of European democracies. Given that this is a first\neffort at developing Synthetic Models for European coun-\ntries, we do not wish to be exhaustive in the cases covered.\nInstead, we focus on a limited number of established\ndemocracies, with sufficient variation in electoral and party\nsystems. In addition, in order to develop stable and robust\nforecasting models, we aim to maximize the number of\ncases on which these national estimations are based. This\nimplies we seek out countries with extended time series\ndata on at least 10 general elections with sound coverage of\nmacro-economic and government support indicators, as\nwell as sufficient polling data on voting intentions. The\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland all met these strin-\ngent data requirements and were accordingly selected for\nthis founding examination.\nWe aim to use a structural forecasting model that will be\napplicable across a number of European countries, even\ngiven all their multi-party variety. Therefore, the decision\non the forecasting target is of utmost importance. Previous\nresearch developing election forecasting models for differ-\nent European nations indicates that accountability-mecha-\nnisms are context specific. Lewis-Beck and Paldam (2000:\n119) have argued that \"in a multi-party system, the eco-\nnomic voter may target a whole coalition, a party within the\ncoalition, or even assign a particular economic policy to a\nparticular party.\" Given that we seek a generally applicable\nmodel, our preferred forecasting target is the vote of the\nincumbent government--irrespective of whether this is a\nsingle-party government, a minority coalition government\nor a majority coalition government. Despite potential dif-\nferences in the extent to which coalition parties are blamed\nfor the economy, a number of studies forecasting multi-\nparty elections demonstrate an overall link between eco-\nnomic conditions and the vote for the governing parties\nDassonneville and Lewis-Beck, 2014; Magalh\u00e3es and\n2010). We believe it is substantively interesting to forecast\nthe combined vote of the incumbent coalition in a multi-\nparty context, rather than individual parties' vote shares.\nhave referred to a simple rule from their German work: \"a\ngoverning coalition whose parties obtain a majority of seats\nin an election continues in office, while a coalition that fails\nin that objective is replaced by another one.\"\nThe proposed Structural Model, with its political econ-\nomy core, reads Vt\n= f(Economy, Government Support).\nOperationally, it might read Vt\n= f(GDPt-x\n, Government\nLewis-Beck and Dassonneville 3\nPopularityt-x\n). The proposed Aggregate Polling Model pre-\ndicts the incumbent vote share as a function of (aggregated)\nvote intention, Vt\n= f(Vote Intentiont-x\n). Operationally, it\nmight read Vt\n= f(Median Vote Intentiont-x\nThe Synthetic Model begins with the long-term fixed\neffects from electoral theory, as captured in the Structural\nModel. Then, it adds to that the short-term effects induced\nby other forces, as represented by the Polling Model (with\nits use here of Median Vote Intention, VIt-x\n.) The addition of\nthis variable can be justified on several grounds. First, it\nrepresents \"omitted variables\" in the theoretical specifica-\ntion of the vote function. This justification seems highly\nplausible, given the parsimony of the structural specifica-\ntion itself. Also, its inclusion can be regarded as a proxy\nvariable for the vote itself. To the extent that these argu-\nments are sound, we should find that VIt-x\nhas a significant\ncoefficient and reduces prediction error, improving the\nforecast over time.\nThus, the Synthetic Model offers a combination of the-\nory and empirics, in dynamic form, featuring progressive\nre-estimations as the election becomes closer. With refer-\nence to the 2012 US presidential election forecasting work,\nit is most similar to the superlative efforts of Erikson and\ndiscrete, i.e. the estimates are at monthly intervals, begin-\nSynthetic models: the analysis strategy\nin practice\nWe first estimate the Structural Model (at t-6) for each\nEuropean country. Then, we estimate the Aggregate Polling\nModel (t-6 to t-1). Finally, we estimate a combined, single-\nequation Synthetic Model (t-6 to t-1). This dynamic\nassumes that while the Structural Model is fixed (at t-6), the\nAggregate Polling Model moves each month (from t-6 to\nt-1). This formulation allows a new \"nowcast\" of the elec-\ntion result with each passing month (Lewis-Beck and Tien,\n2013). For our initial tests, we look at three different parlia-\nmentary democracies of Western Europe: Germany (1980\u00ad\nWe present the same basic structural forecasting model\nfor each of these European democracies, which implies that\nwe are using analogous measures for each of our cases. To\nthis end we rely on one macro-political indicator and one\nmacro-economic indicator. Following a standard approach\nin the election forecasting literature, the political indicator\nis a measure of government approval.7 We have chosen to\ninclude this general government approval indicator instead\nof approval of the prime minister for three main reasons.\nFirst, our dependent variable is general, referring to the\nvote of the coalition as a whole. Second, given our aim of\ndeveloping a generally applicable model for European\ndemocracies, government approval data appears to be a\ncommon denominator for single-party governments, coali-\ntion governments and minority governments. Third, in\ncountries where politics is extremely personalized, we\nwould expect the PM's popularity to be reflected in approval\nratings of his/her government as well.8 We build in a lead\ntime in the structural models by including the data for gov-\nernment approval as measured six months before Election\nDay. As evident from the country-specific plots in Figure 1,\nthere is a positive relationship between governmental\napproval and incumbent vote share in each of the countries\nanalyzed.\nAs a measure of the economy in each of the democracies\nanalyzed, we make use of GDP growth rates (quarterly\nnational accounts, change compared to the same quarter of\nthe previous year).9 Within research on economic voting,\nGDP and unemployment are considered to be \"the big two\"\nmost general objective measure of economic welfare.\" We\nthus believe it fair to assume GDP growth serves as a good\ngeneral measure for the state of the economy in the coun-\ntries under study. As with the political indicator, this eco-\nnomic variable will be measured with a lead time of about\n6 months. To this end, we include GDP growth rates from\ntwo quarters before the election quarter. The bivariate\ncountry-specific plots in Figure 2 illustrate that relationship\nbetween GDP growth and incumbency vote share is as\nexpected. The better the economy is doing--and thus the\nmore economic growth there is--the higher the vote share\nthat incumbents obtain on Election Day.\nHaving presented our measures, in a next step, we\ninclude the political and economic indicators in a model to\npredict the incumbent vote share for each of these European\ndemocracies.10 The structural models are estimated (OLS)\nin Table 1 below. We can evaluate their forecasting perfor-\nmance in terms of the following criteria: Accuracy, Lead,\nParsimony, Replication and Currency (Lewis-Beck, 2005;\nLewis-Beck and Tien, 2013). With respect to accuracy, the\nto 5.5. These numbers suggest, qualitatively, that accuracy\nis \"good\" to \"very good.\" With respect to lead time, it is 6\nmonths before the election, which must be rated \"excel-\nlent.\" The model is quite parsimonious, with only two inde-\npendent variables, drawn from strong election theory.\nReplication is easy enough, given the straightforward and\navailable measures used. With respect to currency, which\nrefers to how updated the forecast is, we see that it is static,\noffered once 6 months out. The model appears to work best\nfor Germany, which yields the highest goodness-of-fit, the\nlowest prediction error, and the lowest collinearity.\nAs a second step, we estimate a number of polling mod-\nels, predicting the incumbent vote share by means of infor-\nmation from the polls.11 The estimations for these polling\nmodels appear in Table 2 below. Let us evaluate them by\nthe same criteria. With respect to accuracy, the R2 ranges\n4 Research and Politics \nThese numbers suggest, qualitatively, that accuracy ranges\nfrom \"fair\" to \"very good.\" Lead time now varies from a\n\"long distance,\" at 6 months, steadily down to 1 month, a\n\"short distance\" from the election. The model is extremely\nparsimonious, with only one independent variable; how-\never, that variable is predictive rather than explanatory (i.e.\nit is not based on election theory). Replication is relatively\neasy, as these polling numbers are generally available. With\nrespect to currency, or the fact that a model is regularly\nupdated and hence provides news value on the \"now\"\n(Lewis-Beck and Tien, 2013), we can say the model is\ndynamic, moving from a lead of 6 months down to 1 month\nbefore the election. A 1-month lead time appears to offer\nthe best accuracy, yielding a prediction error of 2.2 to 4.1\ndepending on the country. We cannot easily point out what\nmodel performs best in terms of accuracy, as different indi-\ncators would lead to contrasting conclusions. On the one\nhand, it looks like the synthetic model predicts best in\nGermany, which is the country with the highest R2 range\n(.67 to .85). On the other hand, it looks like the model per-\nforms best for the United Kingdom, which has the lowest\nThe estimations for the Synthetic Models appear in\nTable 3 below. Let us evaluate these models by the same\ncriteria (Accuracy, Lead, Parsimony, Replication and\nCurrency).

The model is relatively\nFigure 1. Government approval and incumbent vote share in Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\nLewis-Beck and Dassonneville 5\nFigure 2.

S.E. Coef. S.E.\n6 Research and Politics \nparsimonious, with two explanatory variables (based on\ntheory) and one predictor variable (a proxy based on empir-\nics, or omitted variables). The replication of the model,\nwith these simple available measures, poses no challenge.\nWith respect to currency, it is dynamic, from 6 months\ndown to 1 month. The model with a 1-month lead time per-\nforms quite well and has a prediction error range of 2.3 to\n4.4; this model performs best in the United Kingdom and\nGermany, but not in Ireland. The 4-month models have a\nprediction error range of 2.6\u00ad2.9. This 4-month lead works\nabout as well as the 1-month lead, and affords a good deal\nmore distance from the election target.\nWhen we examine improvement in the model fit statis-\ntics, we discover that the incremental increase in model fit\nlargely confines itself to the United Kingdom. There are\ntwo potential reasons why we do not observe such a pat-\ntern of gradual improvement in Ireland or Germany. First,\nthe polling data on which the estimations are based are\nricher for the United Kingdom. Especially for the Irish\ncase, the limited number of available polls can render the\nestimates particularly sensitive to the impact of outliers.12\nSecond, the United Kingdom is the country for which the\nStructural Model performs worst. Consequently, the poll-\ning part--which quite logically becomes more accurate as\nElection Day draws near--is the more important part in\nthe UK models. The improved model fit of the Polling\nModel thus has a greater observable effect on the com-\nbined models for the United Kingdom than it does for the\nGerman or Irish cases.\nPerforming multivariate analyses on small-N samples\ncomes, of course, with some methodological problems,\nespecially as the number of independent variables increases.\nAs an alternative strategy, therefore, we present the results\nof a second set of Synthetic Models in Table 4. These mod-\nels only include two main independent variables: a struc-\ntural variable and a polling predictor. We first saved the\nTable 2. Polling models.Germany.\n Coef. (S.E.) Coef. (S.E.) Coef.

These predicted values\n(or y-hats) were subsequently used as the independent vari-\nables of the models presented in Table 4. We therefore limit\nthe number of independent variables included in the\nSynthetic Models while still making full use of the infor-\nmation and predictive power of the structural and polling\nmodels. As is clear from a comparison of the VIF-statistics\nTable 4. Synthetic models \u00ad y-hats.Germany.\n Coef. (S.E.) Coef. (S.E.) Coef. (S.E.) Coef. (S.E.) Coef. (S.E.) Coef.

From the\nresults in Table 4 it is evident that in the German case, the\nstructural part dominates, while for both Ireland and the\nUnited Kingdom the polling part dominates. The results for\nthe United Kingdom are noteworthy; over time we can\nobserve decreasing coefficients for the structural part and\nincreasing coefficients for the polling part. As such, the UK\nexample illustrates how the polls become a more accurate\npredictor of the results as Election Day draws near.\nPresumably that is because the polls come to reflect the\nfundamentals13 of the Structural Model (Erikson and\nWlezien, 2012), which is also why the importance of the\nstructural part is reduced over time.\nComparative model evaluations\nHow do the three modeling approaches compare? First,\nthere is the basic comparison between the Structural and the\nPolling Models. Taken alone, the Structural Model gener-\nally outperforms the Polling Model, i.e. better statistical fit,\nless prediction error, more lead time, better explanation of\nthe vote. Thus, if a forecaster had to choose one of these two\nstrategies, the Structural Model would be preferred. This\nrecommendation offers comfort to those who put their faith\nin theory. But the forecaster does not in fact have to choose\none of these two strategies. Instead, he or she could add the\ntwo together, via a Synthetic Model. Is the combination of\nthe two strategies worth it? Yes. A synthetic approach offers\nclear reduction in prediction error, and it is dynamic, allow-\ning continual nowcasting across the campaign. However,\nthere are tradeoffs. The error reduction from selecting the\nSynthetic Model is not large, and the loss of lead time is not\nsmall, given that the optimal model is only 1 month out. As\nan important nuance, however, the data suggest that, in fact,\nalmost the same accuracy can be gained at 4 months out.\nPredicting with a 4-month lead is therefore a marginally\nsub-optimal choice that might be worth it.\nConclusions\nSynthetic Models should be pursued further in the quest to\ngain accuracy in forecasting national elections in Europe.\nThere are two primary directions for future research. First,\nscholars should extend Synthetic Modeling to more\nEuropean countries. Second, scholars should extend\nSynthetic Modeling to the subnational level, focusing on\nlower, perhaps more politically relevant, units of analysis.\nSuch a subnational move would greatly increase the num-\nber of observations, which is an important consideration\nsince this forecasting strategy gains statistical power with a\nlarge, independent database.\nOur analyses offer a first effort at developing synthetic\nforecasts for elections in European countries. The results of\nthese analyses indicates that when one succeeds in building\na sound Structural Model that accurately forecasts elec-\ntions, polls do not add much to what we can forecast six\nmonths out already. It seems, therefore, as if the fundamen-\ntals of vote choice theories can, to a large extent, predict\nelections in Europe. As an important nuance, however, the\npolls do add information--perhaps campaign effects--\nwhich these fundamentals cannot capture. This additional\ninformation becomes all the more important as Election\nDay approaches, and offers substantial insight for predict-\ning the outcome of elections where structural factors play a\nsmaller role in voters' choices.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nSupplementary material\nThe online supplementary material is available at: http://rap.sage-\npub.com/content/by/supplemental-data.\nNotes\n1.
