As framed by\nAlba and Nee (2003), in a formulation no less influential than that of\nPortes and Zhou, assimilation is understood as resulting from the individ-\nual pursuit of rational action. In this view, the immigrants' need to pur-\nsue a better life in a strange, foreign environment produces small, virtually\ncostless, cumulative changes, each one of which makes the next advance a\nbit easier. With time, immigrants acquire skills and the capacity to\ndemonstrate competence, gaining recognition, reward, and exposure to an\nincreasingly diverse mix of people.\nYet it is precisely this approach -- \"research . . . dominated by a\nstrong individualistic bent where the social context in which economic\nsuccess or failure takes place is either absent or is introduced in ad hoc\nfashion\" (Portes 1995, 274)\" -- that the hypothesis of segmented assimi-\nlation rejects. By contrast, segmented assimilation theory emphasizes the\nimportance of the context of reception, a feature of the society of immi-\ngration and one shared by all members of the group and which in turn\noverrides or amplifies the effect of individual characteristics. For Portes,\nRumbaut, Zhou, and other proponents of this theoretical perspective, the\ncrucial contextual influences derive from the ways in which migration pol-\nicy, reception by the native population, and characteristics of the co-ethnic\ncommunity combine to create a distinct mode of incorporation. Varying\nacross groups and conditioning the emergence of strong and solidary or\nweak and fragmented communities, modes of incorporation can both\ndirectly produce positive, negative, or even neutral effects, and can also\nindirectly alter the impacts of such individual attributes as skills or experi-\nence. If the mode of incorporation proves positive, the social environment\ncan either enhance the benefits of individual-level resources or compensate\nfor their absence. By contrast, the opposite occurs when incorporation\ntakes place via a negative mode: The benefits of individual-level resources\nare overridden and the fallout from any deficit is enlarged.\nThis paper seeks to return scholarly attention to this core intellectual\ndivide between segmented and conventional (or neo-)assimilation\napproaches, doing so through a theoretical and empirical reconsideration\nof contextual effects on second-generation outcomes. As we will show, the\nempirical approach followed by Portes and his collaborators is deficient:\ntheir criteria for defining context of reception are neither clear nor stable;\ncontext of reception is never directly measured, but instead proxied by\nnationality; and reliance on country of origin proxies precludes the multi-\nlevel modeling necessary to directly test for the impact of specific contex-\ntual effects. Furthermore, although they propose a two-level model,\nentailing direct (main) and indirect (interactive) effects, their analysis of\nsecond-generation outcomes only examines direct effects.\nIn the pages below, we rectify these shortcomings. First, we intro-\nduce the idea of a multilevel model of contextual effects, using three\nobjective measures to create a one-dimensional scale that ranks national-\norigin groups according to the favorability of the receiving context. Sec-\nond, to conceptualize the receiving context in a multidimensional way, we\nenter our three objective measures of reception context as group-level vari-\nables in a multilevel regression model. Third, we enter interaction terms\nbetween our group-level variables and family-level human capital. We\napply this new approach to the analysis of educational attainment among\nsecond-generation young adults in the United States.\nFor this analysis, we draw on two large-scale surveys: Immigrant Sec-\nond Generation in Metropolitan New York (ISGMNY) conducted in\ntan Los Angeles (IIMMLA), undertaken in 2004. Both engage with the\nsame issue motivating this paper and hence contain the relevant, migra-\ntion-related information; both entailed quota sampling of specific second-\ngeneration populations. We pooled the two surveys generating a dataset\nwith extensive origin-level variation (we have at least one representative\nfrom 67 national-origin groups), thereby gaining the capacity to systemati-\ncally analyze the net impact of variation of each context dimension on the\nvariation in the outcome variable, in this case, years of education.\nTaking the three contextual factors identified by the segmented\nassimilation perspective as our point of departure, our analysis provides\nsupport for the importance of societal reception and group-level resources\nwhen predicting educational attainment. In contrast, we do not find any\nevidence that governmental reception matters for educational attainment.\nIn addition to these main effects, we use cross-level interactions to exam-\nine how the context of reception alters the educational transmission pro-\ncess within immigrant families. Our results suggest that among families\nfacing a favorable societal context of reception and enjoying the capacity\nto draw on significant group-level resources, parental human capital has a\nbigger effect on second-generation educational attainment. Or viewed the\nother way around, the friendliness of the context of reception makes the\ngreatest difference for families with high human capital. While clearly\nhighlighting the relevance of some aspects of the reception context, the\nanalysis reveals significant complexities that existing approaches, based on\nmore or less ad hoc comparisons of national-origin groups, did not\ndetect.\nInitially introduced by Portes and Bach in their 1985 study of Mexican\nand Cuban immigrants, the idea of \"modes of incorporation\" received its\nfull exposition in Portes and Rumbaut's 1990 Immigrant America, later to\nbe expounded in identical terms in the second, third, and fourth editions\nof Immigrant America as well as in Legacies. The authors put forward the\nconcept of \"context of reception,\" identifying receiving government poli-\ncies, labor market conditions, and the characteristics of groups' own eth-\nnic communities as the salient components. Disaggregating government\npolicies, the authors identified exclusion, passive acceptance, or active\nencouragement as the three relevant types. Labor market conditions also\nincluded several features, of which the most important was \"the manner\nin which particular immigrant groups are typified\" (1990, 86), whether\npositively or negatively, thus underlying the centrality of a preference for\nor prejudice against certain ethnicities. The ethnic community is classified\nby class composition. If it includes primarily manual workers, commu-\nnity-level networks can facilitate access only to entry-level jobs. In con-\ntrast, if the community includes a significant business or professional\nelement, \"support of ethnic networks is not contingent on acceptance of a\nworking-class lifestyle\" and newcomers may be introduced \"from the start\nto the whole range of opportunities. . .\" (1990, 89; italics added). Modes\nof incorporation figured prominently in Portes and Zhou's seminal 1993\narticle on the second generation, as they contended that \"the context that\nimmigrants find upon arrival. . .plays a decisive role in the course that\ntheir offspring's lives will follow\" (82); likewise, modes of incorporation\nwas a cornerstone concept in Legacies.\nAlthough the context of reception is positioned at the very core of\nsegmented assimilation theory, the concept has never been operationalized;\nrather than measure mode of incorporation, Portes and his collaborators\nconsistently proxied it by using nationality. Thus, when Portes and Rum-\nbaut find that between-group differences persist after the application of\nvarious controls, they conclude that \"the direction of these effects fits clo-\nsely with our knowledge of the modes of incorporation for each of these\nHowever, the source of that knowledge is never identified; moreover, the\njudgments entailed in placing groups in the typology are often ad hoc.\nFor example, it may well be the case that \"neutral\" appropriately describes\nthe governmental policy response to the migration of both Jamaicans and\nChinese, as asserted in Legacies. And yet, as for decades, substantial num-\nbers of Chinese have entered as foreign students, and more recently as\ntemporary high-skilled workers, and permanent residence was granted to\nChinese students living in the United States as of the Tiananmen Square\nmassacre, one wonders whether it might not be better to describe this\nmigration as one in which \"authorities take active steps to encourage a\nSecond, despite emphasizing the importance of group-level charac-\nteristics on individual-level outcomes, most empirical treatments of seg-\nmented assimilation theory ignore the nested, hierarchical structure\nrequired for models which include contextual variables. Segmented assimi-\nlation theory includes a lower level of individual and family-level pro-\ncesses, nested within or clustered by a higher level of national origins.\nGroup-level characteristics at the higher level exert an independent effect\non second-generation outcomes while also altering the family- and indi-\nvidual-level processes at the lower level. Consequently, we need sufficient\ncases -- here, national origins -- at the higher level to systematically\nassess the importance of contextual variables while accounting for compo-\nsitional differences within groups. This affords a multilevel modeling\nstructure which can separately evaluate the impact of a group-level trait\n-- in this case, the mean level of education -- from the effect of the cor-\nresponding characteristic working at the individual level -- in this case,\nparental education.\nThird, while the works reviewed above contend that modes of incor-\nporation result from the combination of types of each different feature,\nnowhere can one find a hypothesis specifying the effects likely to be pro-\nduced by different combinations, a significant deficiency as the typology\ndeveloped in Legacies involved three different features, prejudiced/neutral\nsocietal reception, hostile/neutral/favorable government reception, and\npoor/working class/professional co-ethnic community (2 9 3 9 3),\nleading to 18 different combinations. At the extremes, the possibility that\ndifferent combinations of features could yield significant differences cer-\ntainly seems reasonable: A context entailing favorable governmental recep-\ntion and neutral societal reception and a professional co-ethnic\ncommunity could well yield advantages in contrast to the diametrically\nopposite context involving hostile government policy and prejudiced soci-\netal reception and poor co-ethnic community. The appropriate test, how-\never, would involve changing only one of the three determining variables\n(policy, societal reception, and co-ethnic community) at a time, leaving\nthe other two constant. Indeed, a recent appraisal using this method finds\nlittle empirical support for such smaller combinatorial differences (Wal-\ndinger and Catron 2016). Moreover, even when implementing this\nmethod, it proves impossible to assess the effects of each dimension indi-\nvidually: Does government reception matter more or less than societal\nreception in influencing educational outcomes for the children of immi-\ngrants?\nLast, as noted above, Portes, Rumbaut, Zhou, and collaborators pro-\npose the existence of cross-level interactions. These authors first emphasize\nthe main effect associated with mode of incorporation and socioeconomic\nsuccess: At the group level, more positive modes of incorporation yield\nbetter net outcomes than negative modes of incorporation. But they also\nanticipate that mode of incorporation will influence relationships at the\nindividual level, altering the relationship between skills or experience and\nindividual-level outcomes. Thus, in chapter 4 of Legacies, Portes and\nRumbaut \"consider two alternative effects of group differences in contexts\nof reception: their direct causal impact on socioeconomic achievement\nand the extent to which they modify the influence of individual human\ncapital and other variables. In statistical parlance, the first are additive\neffects and the second are interactive effects. In that chapter, Portes and\nRumbaut examine main (or additive) and interactive impacts as they affect\nthe earnings of the parents of the immigrant children studied in Legacies,\nfinding, for example, that years of US residence have no effect on the\nearnings of Mexican and Nicaraguan parents, while increasing earnings\namong Cuban and Vietnamese parents. Yet while they also contend that\nfirst-generation trajectories mold second-generation experiences, empiri-\ncally they never take up the question of how modes of incorporation\ninteract with parents' characteristics to affect outcomes among the chil-\ndren themselves. As the argument that \"social context . . . can alter, in\ndecisive ways, the link between individual skills and motivations and their\nproposition, we fill in this gap.\nIn a later section of this paper, we address these lacunae, evaluating the\nmain and interactive effects of each dimension of the mode of incorpora-\ntion with objective measures. First, however, we identify those contextual\nfeatures of the reception society likely to influence second-generation out-\ncomes. Those features correspond to the three components comprising\n\"modes of incorporation,\" but are specified in ways that more clearly\nidentify the mechanism linking each context to outcome and also allow\nfor more precise measurement.\nGovernmental Reception: Policy and Status Prevalence\nAs noted in a recent National Academy report, US immigration policy\nhas seen \"the proliferation of immigration statuses that provide different\ndegrees of permanence and security,\" (NASEM 2015, 2-2) with the result\nthat legal status has become \"a new axis of social stratification, similar to\nother social markers such as social class, gender, and race\" (NASEM\n2015, 3\u00ad22). For our purposes, the crucial immigration statuses fall into\nthree broad categories: undocumented status, which can be characterized\nas hostile; refugee status, which is favorable, encouraging migration and\naffording rights and assistance for permanent residence, including reunifi-\ncation with family members; and a residual \"neutral\" category of those\nwho enter as immigrants, namely green card holders and those with fixed\nterm visas, for whom immigration is not actively encouraged but who\nwith documented status enjoy greater rights than legally present \"nonim-\nmigrant\" visitors. By exploiting the within-group prevalence of undocu-\nmented and refugee members, we can characterize immigrants as\npositively, negatively, or neutrally received by the US government. We\nexpect this group characterization to influence second-generation outcomes\nin myriad ways.\nUndocumented migration is path dependent, reflecting its deeply\nentrenched character, its linkage to ongoing recruitment networks and infor-\nmal contacts between settlers and newcomers, as well as the specific histori-\ncal conditions linking sending and receiving countries (Massey, Durand,\nand Malone 2002). Undocumented status is therefore very unevenly\ndistributed across immigrants of different origins, a pattern that may inten-\nsify the strength of the link between nationality, on the one hand, and civic\nstratification and social stigma on the other. Insofar as undocumented\nmigration impedes individual social mobility (Bean et al. 2011; Yoshikawa\n2011), it may also yield a cumulative impact, attenuating the capacity to\nmobilize resources through ethnic social networks, whether the resources are\nthose relevant to the search for jobs, the sharing of business context, or par-\nticipation in community institutions. Consequently, we hypothesize that\nnegative impacts on second-generation outcomes can be expected in popula-\ntions among whom undocumented immigration is widespread.\nBy contrast, refugee status is valuable. Whereas standard modes of\nentry -- whether as legal \"nonimmigrant\" (tourists, students, businessper-\nsons), legal permanent resident, or unauthorized immigrant -- result\nsolely from individual- or household-level decisions, in the United States\nrefugee movements are more centrally organized, reflecting the fact that\nthe status needs to be determined prior to migration and typically gets\napplied to larger subpopulations of origin countries. Refugee policy both\nfacilitates the entry of selected groups fleeing persecution and assists their\nsubsequent integration. Members of the initial refugee wave may be par-\nticularly vulnerable, often arriving without a base of co-ethnics to provide\nhelp or orientation. But that situation no longer holds for the later arri-\nvals, who benefit both from their own refugee status and from the advan-\ntages that this same status generated for the earlier group of newcomers.\nThus, as compared to undocumented status, the prevalence of refugee sta-\ntus varies even more widely across national-origin groups; where wide-\nspread, we hypothesize that effects will be positive.\nCo-Ethnic Community: Group-Level Education\nThe distribution of legal status across national-origin groups within any\nparticular country largely results from government policies and decisions.\nAlthough not entirely independent of government policies, other factors\nlead migrations to vary greatly in selectivity, with implications for group-\nlevel characteristics that may also affect immigrant and second-generation\noutcomes. For example, Indians comprise the most positively selected of\nimmigrants living in the United States: Schooling among the average\nIndian immigrant exceeds a college degree. Mexican migration is also\nselective: While the poorest segments of Mexico's population typically lack\nthe resources needed to move to the United States, well-educated\nMexicans have little incentive to move to the United States, as employers\ntend not to adequately reward their investment in schooling. Conse-\nquently, Mexican emigration is more likely to stem from populations that\nare deprived relative to the United States, but better off than average in\nAs with legal status, we hypothesize that group-level differences in\neducational attainment will alter the ability to capitalize on ethnic social\ncapital, for reasons related to the resources that schooling helps individuals\nto access and the symbolic meaning it conveys. On average, group-level\neducation is correlated with other resources likely to affect immigrant and\nsecond-generation outcomes, whether having to do with the ways in\nwhich referral networks connect to employers and jobs, the quality and\ndiversity of information conveyed through ethnic ties, or the degree of\nengagement and understanding of host society institutions (Borjas 1992).\nTo the extent that social circles tie immigrants and their offspring to other\npeople of the same origin, the rewards of education or the penalties of\nlack of schooling may be widely shared. Just such an example can be\nfound in Inheriting the City, a book based on one of the surveys used in\nthis paper: The authors mention a barely literate Chinese mother in New\nYork, who knew her daughter should go to an elite public high school,\nrequiring passage of a competitive examination (Kasinitz, Mollenkopf, and\nWaters 2008, 352), thus highlighting how cross-class cutting social ties\nand strong ethnic solidarity can promote upward mobility among disad-\nvantaged members of a diverse group.\nMoreover, education also has a reputational effect, sending a signal\nto outsiders, who may focus on the obvious characteristics that a person\nmight share with others of the same or similar background, as opposed to\nindividual traits (Lee and Fiske 2006). Indeed, these tendencies toward\nstatistical discrimination have discouraged the migration of higher-skilled\nMexican immigrants, whom employers are apt to perceive through the\nprism of the average Mexican immigrant, whose schooling is relatively\nlow (Mattoo, Neagu, and \nSocietal Reception: Prejudice and Discrimination\nWhile the average educational profile of an immigrant group may yield\nreputational effects, other characteristics are likely to influence the ways in\nwhich any foreign-origin group is perceived. At the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were seen as\nswarthy, but at the turn of the twenty-first century they are perceived as\nwhite and hence indistinguishable from the dominant group (Roediger\n2005). Migration streams from elsewhere in the world may not share that\nsame acceptability. Migrants from the Caribbean and Africa are likely to\nsuffer from long-standing prejudices against persons of African origin.\nWhile persons of Mexican background are often seen as occupying an\nintermediate position in the American racial order, somewhere between\nblacks and whites, that characterization also implies some significant\ndegree of rejection. The prevalence of the \"model minority\" image may\nbe a source of protection for immigrants from Asia, but the view that\nAsians are also \"forever foreigners\" suggests that levels of acceptability\nmay not reach those attained by contemporary immigrants from Europe\nor Canada. For instance, Hersch (2011) documents a significant wage dis-\nadvantage between immigrants of the lightest and darkest skin colors.\nAlthough there is a great deal of phenotypical diversity within origin\ngroups, broad ethno-racial categories of \"Asian,\" \"Latino,\" and \"black\" are\nstrongly associated with region of origin and thus racial stratification can\noperate at the group as well as the individual level. Moreover, extensive\nqualitative evidence of \"colorism,\" or disadvantage by darkness of skin,\nexists even within pan-ethnic and racial groupings (Bonilla-Silva 2006;\nHunter 2007), suggesting the importance of still finer variation in skin\ncolor at the national-origin level within broader racial groupings.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we test for these contextual effects in\ntwo ways. First, we create a unidimensional scale measuring context of\nreception derived from the Legacies framework, testing for its impact on\neducational attainment in a multilevel framework. Second, we replace this\nunidimensional second-level variable with a multidimensional second-level\nmodel including objective measures corresponding to each of the context\nconcepts outlined above: governmental reception, co-ethnic community,\nand societal reception.\nMODEL\nWe use a multilevel model that takes the nested structure of families\nwithin groups into account, adjusting for the correlation in individual-\nlevel characteristics within origin groups and testing for both the direct\nand the contextual effect (Gelman 2012) of educational attainment among\nimmigrants on the educational attainment of the second generation. We\ntake the educational attainment y of respondent (i) nested in group j as a\nfunction of parental Education E and a matrix of control variables X.\nEach group j has a different intercept aj\nwhich is normally distributed\nand modeled as a function of the group-level variables Z. Small greek let-\nters indicate (vectors) of coefficients with b indicating the effect of paren-\ntal education and the vector c, the effects of the control variables. In the\nsecond line, the vector h indicates the effects of the group-level variables\nZ on the intercept a.\nyij\n\u00bc aj\n\u00fe bEij\n\u00fe cXij\n\u00fe eij\naj\n$ N \u00f0hZj\n; rh\n\u00de\nIn a next step, we let the effect of parental education b vary across\ngroups, which allows us to test for theoretically informed contextual charac-\nteristics that predict heterogeneity in the transmission of education across\nimmigrant groups (Luthra and Soehl 2015). This extends the model to:\nyij\n\u00bc aj\n\u00fe b\nj\nEij\n\u00fe cXij\n\u00fe eij\n\u00f0aj\n; b\nj\n\u00de $ N hZj\n;\nX\nh\n \nMethodologically, this follows a line of inquiry that has used multi-\nlevel models to ascertain the effects of contextual variables on educational\noutcomes among the children of immigrants (Levels et al. 2008) or on\nother socioeconomic outcomes (e.g., Kanas and Tubergen, 2009). While\nmost of this Europe-based research has examined variation across different\nreceiving countries, we are necessarily limited to one receiving country.\nHowever, we exploit here, as have other scholars (Kalmijn and Van\nTubergen 2010), the ample variation in receiving context by national ori-\ngin that exists within the United States.\nThe question then is what is the proper level at which to define the\n\"community\" that faces a context of reception? Ideally one would con-\nstruct reception context not simply as a function of the country of origin,\nbut also reflecting variation by period of migration, local context of ori-\ngin, and precise location of settlement. While our measure of the co-eth-\nnic community takes geography into account, as it is based on data from\nNew York and Los Angeles, we cannot disaggregate our measures of the\npolicy context or of societal reception below the national level.\nDATA\nAll individual-level data in the study stem from a pooled sample of two\nlarge-scale surveys of the children of immigrants: Immigrant Second\nGeneration in Metropolitan New York (ISGMNY, Mollenkopf et al\nMobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA, Rumbaut et al 2008),\nundertaken in 2004. We limit our samples to the children of at least one\nforeign-born parent in all analyses, and restrict the age range to those 23\nand above to reduce left censoring on our dependent variable, educational\nattainment.\nWe operationalize context using a unidimensional scale drawn from\nthe Legacies framework as well as drawing on three objective indicators of\neach dimension of the context of reception. Each of these methods\nrequires somewhat different samples. When evaluating the use of mode of\nincorporation with the unidimensional context scale, we are necessarily\nlimited to the national origins discussed in the existing literature, in order\nto have sufficient information to assign each origin a value on each of the\nmode of incorporation dimensions. These national origins are those quota\nsample groups in both the IIMMLA and the ISGMNY, outlined in\nincorporation analysis, where we rely on secondary sources to assign val-\nues, rather than current judgments in the literature, we include all\nnational-origin groups in our sample (N = 2,955; origins = 67).\nWe do not have full information on some of the group-level variables\nin our dataset. In particular, we are missing skin color information on 28\norigin groups, or 8 percent of all individual observations. To preserve the\nvariation in our sending countries, we multiply impute the missing skin\ncolor information at the country level using a variety of national-level indi-\ncators (see online Supporting Information). Our imputation results in 15\ndatasets of imputed values. The standard errors reported in all analyses are\nadjusted for multiple imputed data and analyzed using the MI multiple\nimputation suite of commands in Stata 13. For our regression analyses that\ninclude group-level variables, we use multilevel mixed-effects models with a\nvarying intercept to account for the hierarchical structure of the data.\nVARIABLES\nDependent Variable\nWe use second-generation educational attainment as our dependent vari-\nable in all models, doing so for a variety of reasons. The first concerns its\nsubstantive importance: Educational attainment is the most important\nImmigration policy\nFavorable (2) Neutral (1) Hostile (0)\nSocietal reception\nNeutral or\npositive (1)\nPrejudiced\nNeutral or\npositive (1) Prejudiced (0)\nNeutral or\npositive (1) Prejudiced (0)\nCo-ethnic\ncommunity\nWorking\nDominican Republic Mexico, El Salvador,\nGuatemala\nEntrepreneurial/\nprofessional (2)\nFormer\nSoviet\nUnion\nVietnamese West Indies, Colombia,\nPeru, Philippines,\nChina, Korea, Ecuador\nmediator in the relationship between parental and child occupation and\nincome (Blau and Duncan 1967). Second, educational attainment, unlike\nlabor market outcomes, is generally completed and relatively \"fixed\" by\nthe mid- to late twenties and therefore can appropriately be examined in\na still young second-generation population. Finally, as an outcome that is\nmore proximate to and influenced by the childhood environment than\nlater integration outcomes -- such as those of occupation, income, or\nplace of residence -- it is an outcome where we may best be able to\nobserve contextual effects deriving from the immigrant parents' experience\nupon arrival in the receiving society.\nWe measure educational attainment in number of years, using\ndetailed information on schooling and university completion available in\nboth surveys.\nIndependent Variables\nThe independent variable in all analyses is the context of reception. We first\nintroduce a multilevel model with a unidimensional context of reception\nscale at the national-origin level, followed by a multilevel model with an\nindicator for each dimension of the context of reception and finally a\nmodel that adds cross-level interactions.\nOne-Dimensional Context Scale. In order to identify any possible\nsystematic relationship between modes of incorporation and second-\ngeneration outcomes, we apply the Legacies framework to create a scale,\nfollowing the existing secondary literature in ways that are faithful to the\napproach developed by Portes and his collaborators. Thus, in Table 1, we\ncreate a context of reception table displaying the possible combinations of\nthe three main variables and then populate each cell with origin groups in\nIIMMLA and ISGMNY. Using the manuscripts emerging from the\nIIMMLA and ISGMNY projects, we characterize the first dimension,\nimmigration policy, as positive for groups with a large proportion of\nrefugees, neutral for groups with small proportions of both refugees and\nundocumented immigrants, and hostile for groups with large proportions\nof undocumented immigrants. The societal reception is divided into\nneutral or positive for predominantly European immigrant-origin groups,\nand prejudiced for others. Finally, the co-ethnic community is divided\ninto poor, working class, and entrepreneurial/professional classes,\ndepending on the self-employment and education levels for each group.\nEach category of the three features is assigned a number from \"0\" to \"2\"\nin the table above, and these numbers are then summed to create a\ncontext of reception scale score. As shown in the first line of Table 3, the\naverage score in the groups we can rank is 3.2, with a range of \"1\" for\nthe least favorable to \"5\" for the most favorably rated groups. Former\nSoviet Jews, surveyed in New York, and the Vietnamese, surveyed in Los\nAngeles, stand at the top, with rankings of \"5\" and \"4,\" respectively, and\nMexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans in Los Angeles at the bottom\nwith a ranking of \"1.\"\nMultiple Dimensions of Immigration Contexts. Following the discussion\nabove, we develop several new measures of the mode of incorporation,\nallowing each dimension to be independently assessed and relying on\nobjective data sources.\nTo reflect the facilitative and constraining aspects of governmental\nreception, we rely on secondary data on legal status prevalence during the\ntime of parental migration. An appropriate measure of governmental\nreception needs to be temporally relevant, reflecting an early period in the\nrespondents' lives and one prior to the survey. As the respondents sampled\nwho mainly immigrated to the United States within a 15-year time frame,\nationalize the concept of government reception to reflect key policy devel-\nopments during the respondents' youth.\nWe construct a scale of status prevalence based on two indicators:\n(1) the number of persons from any given country legalized under the\nregular amnesty program of 1986 as a fraction of the total population\nfrom that country in 1990, and (2) the number of persons admitted as\npersons admitted to the United States from that country during the same\nperiod. We compute these proportions using data from the statistical year-\nbooks of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the 1990 Cen-\nsus. We distinguish six levels. The most negative (1) includes immigrant\nnationalities with a large proportion of undocumented individuals, for\nwhich the number of persons legalized in the 1986 amnesty programs is\nequal to or greater to 20 percent of the nationality's 1990 population and\nfor which no persons were admitted as refugees during the 1980s. At the\nother extreme, level six includes nationalities with a large refugee compo-\nnent, for which the number of persons admitted as refugees during the\npopulation and for which no persons were legalized in the 1986 (defini-\ntions of all levels appear in Table 2).1 We enter this scale as a continuous\nvariable in our analyses, making the strong assumption of equal distance\nbetween each value of the scale. However, we check for sensitivity of our\nresults to this assumption by including the scale as a series of 0/1 indica-\ntors as well.\nTo assess the impact of co-ethnic community differences in educa-\ntion, we use a variable measuring average years of schooling by national\norigin for the foreign born aged 25 and older as reported in the 1980 US\nCensus. As the co-ethnic community is specific to the local context, we\ndraw on information keyed to respondents' place of residence, whether in\nNew York or in Los Angeles, to create a summary measure for all respon-\ndents in the two surveys.

Table 5 displays group-level means of the\nmeasures of sending and receiving context we have obtained from sec-\nondary sources by national origins and the context of reception scale\nadapted from the Portes/Rumbaut typologies of modes of incorporation\n(as described above).\nAt the extremes, as expected, we immediately see congruence in the\nthree operationalization measures. The Central American groups with the\nmost negative context of reception score share a medium-dark average\nskin color, low average years of education, and a uniformly negative legal\ncontext of reception. Similarly, the Eastern European groups that occupy\nthe most positive context of reception cell in the Legacies table share\nhigher levels of group education, high refugee rates, and are predomi-\nnantly light-skinned. However, the large number of respondents who\noccupy the intermediate cells of the table is actually quite heterogeneous.\nProfessional ethnic groups with neutral government receptions, but a neg-\native societal reception, are very diverse: High levels of education and low\npercentages of undocumented immigrants prevail among Filipinos; the\nChinese, in contrast, have lower average levels of education and an undoc-\numented minority. Colombians once again represent another configura-\ntion, reporting an undocumented minority but with an average education\nat 11 years and a generally light complexion. Hence, even when using the\nmultidimensional framework developed in Legacies and in other writings,\norigin groups that fall into the moderate context of reception configura-\ntions appear upon closer inspection to be quite dissimilar.\nComparing Context Indicators as Predictors of  \nIn order to empirically assess the different approaches outlined above, we\ncompare a series of models, regressing years of education on both the uni-\ndimensional and multidimensional measures of contextual effects, along-\nside typical controls for individual-level factors. The samples differ slightly\nas described above, but each model uses a combined sample of observa-\ntions from both IIMMLA and ISGMNY, restricted to those aged 23 and\nabove with valid responses to all control variables. We enter these control\nvariables in four steps, first only controlling for age, sex, and schooling\nstatus (Model 1), then including parental education, parental occupation,\nwhether the respondent was separated from a biological parent during\nchildhood (Model 2); we then add the language spoken in the respon-\ndent's childhood home (Model 3), and finally respondent's place of birth,\nAverage years education Status prevalence scale Skin color\nGroups with a context of reception score of 1\nGroups with a context of reception score of 3\nGroups with a context of reception score of 5\nand respondent's citizenship status (Model 4). Table 6 presents a sum-\nmary of these results focusing on the context measures. The full models\ncan be found in the online Supporting Information.\nOne-Dimensional Context of Reception Scale. We first evaluate the impact\nof contextual effects using the one-dimensional context of reception scale.\nThe results of this endeavor are seen in the first part of Table 6.\nThe effect of the scale is statistically significant across all specifica-\ntions. A one-point increase in the context of reception scale is associated\nwith about one-half year of additional expected schooling among the chil-\ndren of immigrants of the same age and sex. However, more than 40 per-\ncent of this effect is accounted for by individual-level factors such as\nparental educational, occupation, and family separation. After all controls\nhave been applied (far right column), the context of reception continues\nto yield an effect but it is now more modest, at about one-third of a year\nof expected schooling. These initial results therefore confirm the impor-\ntance of national-origin context on second-generation educational attain-\nment, but do not provide further insight into which dimension(s) of the\ncontext of reception may be driving this result.\nMultiple Dimensions of Context. In the next section of Table 6, we show\nthe results of a series of models using separate, objectively defined\nindicators for each of the mode of incorporation variables. Both average\nyears of education in the community and average group skin color yield\nstatistically significant results. In the first model with only demographic\ncontrols, a one-year increase in average education in the community is\nassociated with about a one-fourth of a year increase in respondent's\neducation. This coefficient declines by about half once all individual-level\ncontrol variables are added and in the final Model 4, each additional year\nin the average education level of co-ethnics is associated with an increase\nof 0.14 years completed education. This result confirms earlier research\ndemonstrating the importance of ethnic group human capital on\nintergenerational mobility (Borjas 1992). However, our analysis here\nfurther demonstrates that the impact of ethnic group resources on\neducational attainment holds even when including further origin group-\nlevel controls.\nTurning to societal perception, we see that each shade darker in the\ngroup average skin color is associated with a decrease of about one-fifth of\na year of education. Interestingly, this negative effect is not accounted for\nCoef SE Coef SE Coef SE Coef SE\nOne-dimensional context scale (N = 2,287)\nMultiple dimensions of context (N = 2,955)\nMultiple dimensions of context with cross-level interactions (N = 2,955)\nIndividual-level controls included Age, Sex, City,\nand school status\n+ Parental Educ., Occ.,\nand whether separated or not\n+ Language growing\nup\n+ Legal Status and\nGeneration\nNote: Significance levels: ** <0.01; * <0.05; +<0.1.

Moreover, even after accounting for the fact that darker-skinned\ngroups have lower levels of education and worse contexts of reception at\nthe group level, group skin color maintains an independent association\nwith lower levels of schooling in the second generation.\nFinally, the coefficient for the legal status prevalence scale is both\nsubstantively small and not statistically significant, throughout all of our\nmodels. We conducted several sensitivity tests to confirm this unexpected\nfinding, including entering the reception scale as a categorical variable and\nentering the percent refugee and percent IRCA regularizations separately.\nThe coefficients remained insignificant across all models.\nMultiple Dimensions of Context with Cross-Level Interactions. The final\nrows in Table 6 display the results including the multiple dimensions of\ncontext as well as cross-level interactions between these dimensions and\nfamily-level resources (highest parental education). To facilitate\ninterpretation, all variables are grand-mean-centered. In the final model\nincluding all controls, significant (at the 0.1 level) interactions exist\nbetween the individual-level variable of parental years of education, on the\none hand, and the group-level variables of skin color and average years of\neducation, on the other. The relationship between parental and\nrespondent education is stronger in populations with higher average levels\nof education. In contrast, the relationship between parental and\nrespondent education is weaker among immigrant groups with darker skin\ncolor.\nTo summarize these relationships, Figure I displays the intergenera-\ntional transmission coefficient for immigrant families belonging to\nnational-origin groups of different mean levels of education, for those in\ngroups with the lightest (1.5 on the skin color scale) and the darkest skin\ncolor (7 on the skin color scale). For instance, the educational attainment\nof an immigrant parent belonging to a group with the darkest skin color\nand very low group-level years of education has essentially no relationship\nto the educational attainment of the second-generation child. For an\nimmigrant from a white-origin group with high mean education, the\ntransmission rate approaches the US national average (Card 2005), with a\ntransmission rate of slightly over 0.3. Thus, the contextual effects of the\ngroup at large exert not only a main effect, but also interact with the sta-\ntus transmission process within the immigrant family. Individual\nimmigrants from groups with darker skin color, or lower levels of educa-\ntion, are less able to transmit their educational attainment to their\nUS-raised children.\nDISCUSSION\nOur paper is the first to systematically operationalize and compare alterna-\ntive approaches to the measurement of contextual effects in second-genera-\ntion educational attainment. Furthermore, we have gone beyond the\ntypical nationality (i.e., dummy variable) approach by interacting each\nindicator with parental education, thereby testing whether context yields\nan interactive as well as an additive, or main, effect. A rigorous assessment\nof the currently dominant modes of incorporation approach is clearly\nrequired, yet our endeavor also shows the formidable empirical hurdles\nIntergenerational educational transmission\nGroup years education\nLightest skin color (1.5) Darkest skin color (7)\nEducational transmission parent to child\nFigure I.

The greatest challenge entails finding reasonably proximal indi-\ncators of the concepts measured at a level of detail that represent migrant\norigins at the national level and not broader categories such as \"Central\nAmerican.\"\nThese difficulties notwithstanding, we believe that we have success-\nfully introduced new potential measures of each dimension of the mode\nof incorporation. In the case of group-level resources, this has proven rela-\ntively easy: Group-level education strongly and significantly predicts sec-\nond-generation attainment; its relationship to years of education is robust\nto many alternative specifications. Other dimensions reveal some distance\nbetween the measurements we could assemble and the underlying con-\ncepts. The difficulty in measuring societal discrimination has required the\nuse of an indirect proxy for potential discrimination, skin color, likely\nweakening the observed relationship between this variable and second-gen-\neration educational attainment. However, the effect of skin color remains\nsignificant and in the expected direction even in models including all indi-\nvidual-level controls; therefore, it likely captures the societal reception\ncontext as outlined above. Moreover, in separate analyses not presented\nhere, we observed a stronger relationship between group average skin color\nand second-generation outcomes than between group-level reports of dis-\ncrimination and second-generation outcomes.3 We also believe that our\nmeasure of status prevalence is of high quality, relying on detailed infor-\nmation from official statistics at the national-origin level. Thus, the lack\nof statistical significance points to the possibility that this dimension of\nthe reception context may in fact not systematically affect second-genera-\ntion educational attainment. Given that even undocumented children of\nimmigrants often have to \"learn to be illegal\" (Gonzales 2011) only after\nleaving the protection of formal schooling, educational attainment may be\na second-generation outcome less vulnerable to group-level status preva-\nlence than, for instance, labor market outcomes or political participation.\nIn addition to providing new, objective, and replicable measures of\nmode of incorporation, we also compared alternative ways of operational-\nizing the concept in models predicting second-generation educational\nattainment. Recent systematic evaluations of this approach using the CILS\ndata (Waldinger and Catron 2016) have found that when systematically\napplied to all meaningful comparisons, and varying one dimension at a\ntime, results are often inconsistent with the predictions of the modes of\n3Results available on request.\nincorporation model. In additional analyses, which are available as Supple-\nmental Material, we implement a similar approach using the IIMMLA\nand IMSGNY data and come to conclusions similar to those reported by\nWaldinger and Catron.\nThe one-dimensional context of reception scale tested here has sig-\nnificant advantages over country-by-country, context of reception compar-\nisons; it is more parsimonious, and collapsing these differences into a\nscale also enables us to employ appropriate multilevel models, which take\ninto account the correlation of observations within national-origin groups.\nMost importantly, the scale also better predicts second-generation attain-\nment.\nHowever, this scale remains problematic. Unlike the alternative\napproach we develop, it lacks the ability to discern mechanisms underly-\ning the group-level differences in academic performance: Is it the legal\ncontext, the societal context, or the community characteristics that matters\nmost? Moreover, this approach shares a weakness with the country-by-\ncounty origin comparisons in that it relies on subjective decisions about\nwhere in the Legacies table each country of origin resides; the researcher\nmust either be highly knowledgeable of the legal and local context facing\neach immigrant group or rely on the existing categorizations, as we have\ndone.\nThe multidimensional approach developed in this paper addresses all\nof these concerns. First, by including measures of legal context, societal\ncontext, and co-ethnic community characteristics, we can discern which\ndimensions of the reception context exert an impact on second-generation\noutcomes and also how those effects vary. Second, as opposed to the sub-\njective rankings presented in Legacies and other related works, we rely on\nobjective measures of each dimension: INS statistics for governmental\ncontext of reception, group average skin color measures for societal recep-\ntion, and the average level of education for the foreign born of the same\nethnic group in the local context (New York City boroughs or Los Ange-\nles county). Using these secondary sources, additional origin countries can\nbe easily added to the model, and this approach can also be exported to\nother receiving countries.\nThis operationalization allows us to identify the distinctive impact of\neach contextual variable on second-generation educational attainment, net\nof other contextual- and individual-level measures. In turn, we gain the\ncapacity to assess the relative importance and impact of one contextual\nvariable relative to the other. Thus, a standard deviation change in group-\n(0.12 9 1.58) years increase in predicted years of education. While a stan-\ndard deviation change toward darker group-level skin color is associated\nin years of education.\nFinally, to fully evaluate the predictions of segmented assimilation,\nwe need to examine not only the main effect of the context of reception\non second-generation attainment but also the ways in which contextual\ncharacteristics at the group level facilitate or hinder status transmission\nwithin immigrant families. Our effort to do so actually confirms one of\nthe key contentions on which the hypothesis of segmented assimilation\nrests: namely that, in addition to a direct impact, context can alter the\nimpact of parental resources. However, we bring significant further refine-\nment to that hypothesis, as we show that these interactive effects take\ncomplex form. On the one hand, belonging to a disadvantaged group,\nwith low educational resources or exposure to prejudice due to darker\nskin, diminishes overall educational attainment net of individual-level\ncharacteristics. On the other hand, family-level resources matter less for\nsecond-generation members of disadvantaged groups. The consequences\nare paradoxical as they can point toward greater opportunity in the sense\nthat one's parental pedigree matters less for how one does in life, but they\nmay also mean that advantaged members of these disadvantaged groups\nwill be less able to pass on their higher achievements to their children.\nSeparating out the main and interaction effects of the context of reception\nenables us to explain what is often framed as contradictory findings in the\nliterature: the ability of the children of disadvantaged immigrant groups\nto greatly surpass their parents in terms of educational attainment (lower\ntransmission due to interaction with parental education), while still lag-\nging behind more privileged immigrant groups and native whites (negative\nmain effect on attainment).\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough endlessly contested, assimilation has long provided the master\nconcept for understanding the transformations undergone by immigrants\nand their descendants. However insightful, this perspective neglects the\ncontext under which international migration occurs, a shortcoming\nwhich the theory of segmented assimilation attempts to address.\nAlthough contextual factors are inherently of sociological interest, the\nvery nature of population movements across states gives them heightened\nimportance.\nThe influence of context on the incorporation of immigrants has\nlong been a central theme in the work of Alejandro Portes, who has\nadvanced \"modes of incorporation\" as a concept for summarizing the key\ncontextual factors linked to the receiving context. However, we find this\napproach wanting. As we have shown, the concept itself is fuzzy and ill-\ndefined; the criteria used for assigning nationalities to modes of incorpora-\ntion are subjective, with the result that nationalities differing on objective\ncharacteristics have been assigned to the same mode of incorporation.\nMost importantly, the concept is never operationalized, but rather mea-\nsured by the proxy of nationality, thus relying on names when generaliz-\nable theory demands variables.\nResponding to precisely that challenge, this paper has disaggregated\nmode of incorporation into its three components -- policy reception,\nsocietal reception, and co-ethnic community -- identifying the objective\nindicators of status prevalence, mean years of schooling, and mean skin\ncolor that correspond to each concept. In so doing, we gain the leverage\nneeded to discriminate among each of the distinctive contextual influences\nthat might affect second-generation outcomes, generate a metric that links\ndifferences in contextual factors to the outcome of interest, and assess the\nimportance of one factor, relative to another.\nAs we have shown, this approach yields superior results. Comparing\nnames generates coefficients that are only inconsistently significant (Wal-\ndinger and Catron 2016). An index ranking nationalities according to the\nadvantage/disadvantage associated with a mode of incorporation produces\nmore robust effects, but it is neither a meaningful metric (what, exactly, is\nentailed in a one-step difference in modes of incorporation?) nor does it\nidentify the specific feature -- government policy, societal reaction, or co-\nethnic community -- responsible for the result. Our method, in contrast,\nallows us to defensibly assign a large number of national-origin groups\nwith different values on all three dimensions of the immigrant context of\nreception. We can then go on to use multilevel models that allow the\ncomparison of the relative, and independent, impact of both group- and\nindividual-level characteristics on second-generation educational attain-\nment, as well as the interaction between the two.\nAs the measures we use are objective and drawn from publicly avail-\nable sources, these indicators can be applied by other scholars to other\ndatasets; their utility can be assessed in light of alternatives that other\nresearchers may propose. And so we close our paper with the all too com-\nmon call for more research, motivated by the belief that in this case the\nstakes are simply too high to rely on rule-of the thumb judgments of criti-\ncal concepts and inconsistent operationalization.\nREFERENCES\nAlba, R.
