    "abstract": "Abstract\nOne consequence of the advent of cyber communication is that increasing numbers of people go online to ask for, obtain,\nand presumably act upon advice dispensed by unknown peers. Just as advice seekers may not have access to information\nabout the identities, ideologies, and other personal characteristics of advice givers, advice givers are equally ignorant about\ntheir interlocutors except for the bits of demographic information that the latter may offer freely. In the present study,\nthat information concerns sex. As the sex of the advice seeker may be the only, or the predominant, contextual variable\nat hand, it is expected that that identifier will guide advice givers in formulating their advice. The aim of this project is to\ninvestigate whether and how the sex of advice givers and receivers affects the type of advice, through the empirical analysis\nof a corpus of web-based Spanish language forums on personal relationship difficulties. The data revealed that, in the absence\nof individuating information beyond that implicit in the advice request, internalized gender expectations along the lines of\nagency and communality are the sources from which advice givers draw to guide their counsel. This is despite the trend in\ndiscursive practices used in formulating advice, suggesting greater language convergence across sexes.\n",

Choose.\" For Sartre, the\nmoral of the story is that, when someone solicits advice, they\nhave already chosen the answer they want, as the advice they\nwish to receive guides the selection of advice giver. If Sartre's\nobservation was ever right, in cyber communication it no\nlonger holds. Increasing numbers of people go online to ask\nfor, obtain, and presumably act upon advice dispensed by\nunknown peers, mindful or not of the potential risks involved\nin this practice (e.g., erroneous information, abusive lan-\nguage or content, dangerous emotional manipulation from\nthe advice giver, or receiver, or both).\nJust as online advice seekers may have to or may choose\nto ignore the identities, ideologies, worldviews, and other\npersonal characteristics of advice givers, advice givers are\nsimilarly positioned with information about the interlocutors\nasking for advice, except for the bits of demographic infor-\nmation that are sometimes freely offered or given away in\nposts (e.g., age, gender, and some personal circumstances\nrevealed in the questioning). The advice they offer is thus not\nguided by what they think the advice seeker wants to hear (as\nin Sartre's interpretation of his experience above) but on\nwhat they think will be relevant or appropriate to an unknown\ninterlocutor. Thus, advice is formulated on the basis of very\nlimited contextual information and the few demographic fac-\ntors their interlocutors reveal.\nA number of researchers have shown that insufficient\ninformation about individuals or situations tends to trigger\nfrom others stereotypical inferences and responses. Thus,\nKunda and Sherman-Williams (1993) propose that, \"in the\nabsence of other information, expectations about an individ-\nual will be guided by stereotypical beliefs about categories\nsuch as his or her profession, ethnicity, or gender\" (p. 90).\nWhen it comes to online advice, given that the only piece of\ndemographic information advice seekers provide is their sex,\nsex becomes a salient feature in the interaction. We can spec-\nulate that the salience of gender norms is likely to influence\nthe nature of advice offered, and thus advice givers will for-\nmulate responses based on their internalized gender role\nexpectations and stereotypes, which may be triggered uncon-\nsciously or automatically.\n1Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nSusana A.

Eisenchlas1\n Keywords\ngender role expectations, gender stereotypes, online advice, Spanish language\n2 SAGE Open\nGender Stereotypes\n\"Gender roles\" have been described as society's shared\nbeliefs that apply to individuals on the basis of their socially\nidentified sex (Eagly, 2009) and are thus closely related to\ngender stereotypes. Stereotypes can be conceptualized as the\ndescriptive aspects of gender roles, as they depict the attri-\nbutes that an individual ascribes to a group of people (Eagly\n& Mladinic, 1989). Stereotyping is often seen as necessary,\nas it is a way of simplifying the overwhelming amount of\nstimuli one constantly receives from the world (Ladegaard,\n1998), constraining potentially infinite numbers of interpre-\ntations (Dunning & Sherman, 1997). Another line of inquiry\nextends the function of stereotypes from the interpretation to\nthe rationalization and justification of social practices\nCommon to these interpretations is the view that the result-\ning representation is usually selective, distorted, and often\noversimplified.\nStereotypes of men and women commonly reflect Bakan's\n(1966) distinction between two dimensions, often labeled\nagency, or self-assertion, and communion, or connection\nGlick, 2001). Men are generally thought to be agentic--that\nis, competent, assertive, independent, masterful, and achieve-\nment oriented, while women are perceived as inferior to men\nin agentic qualities. Conversely, women are generally\nthought to be communal--that is, friendly, warm, unselfish,\nsociable, interdependent, emotionally expressive and rela-\ntionship oriented--while men are perceived as inferior in\ncommunal qualities (Eagly & Mladinic, 1989). Empirical\nstudies investigating the extent to which gender stereotypes\napply have consistently found that their content is heavily\nsaturated with communion and agency (Eagly & Mladinic,\nand feminine stereotypes can be seen as complementary in\nthe sense that each gender is seen as possessing a set of\nstrengths that balances out its own weaknesses and supple-\nments the assumed strengths of the other group (Cameron,\nattributes serves to reinforce male superiority and female\nsubordination as it naturalizes these beliefs, thus making\nthem acceptable to men and women (Jost & Kay, 2005;\nsuggest that these distinctions appear to be pancultural, a\nstrong claim that requires empirical investigation.\nGender roles are descriptive and prescriptive (Eagly,\n2009). The descriptive aspect, or stereotype, tells men and\nwomen what is typical for their sex in particular contexts and\nsituations. The prescriptive aspect tells them what is expected\nor desirable (Rudman & Glick, 2001). Prentice and Carranza\nThe stereotypic belief that women are warm and caring is\nmatched by a societal prescription that they should be warm and\ncaring. Similarly, the stereotypic belief that men are strong and\nagentic is matched by a societal prescription that they should be\nViolations of gender role expectations are met with criti-\ncism and penalized (Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman &\nGlick, 2001). Furthermore, societal gender prescriptions\ntend to be internalized and thus self-imposed to a certain\nextent (Postmes & Speares, 2002). Thus, W. Wood and Eagly\n(2010) suggest that the power of gender roles is their embed-\ndedness \"both in others `expectations thereby acting as social\nnorms and in individuals' internalized gender identities,\nthereby acting as personal dispositions\" (p. 645). This\nexplains, at least partly, the potency and stability of gender\nexpectations that seem to endure despite changes in tradi-\ntional gender relations we have experienced in recent\ndecades, and the finding that gender stereotyping appears to\nbe equally strong among women and men (Blair & Banaji,\nKunda and Sherman-Williams (1993) claim that stereo-\ntypes affect impressions even in the presence of individuat-\ninginformation,byaffectingtheconstrualofthatinformation.\nSimilarly, Dunning and Sherman (1997) argue, on the basis\nof a series of experiments they conducted, that specific infor-\nmation about individuals does not reduce the impact of ste-\nreotypes, as stereotypes often lead people to make tacit\ninferences about that information. They found that these\ninferences alter the meaning of the information to affirm the\nimplicit stereotypes people possess. Moreover, experimental\nresearch on stereotypical beliefs about social categories has\nshown the strong impact they have, even in the absence of\nconscious endorsement (Jost & Kay, 2005; W. Wood &\nEagly, 2010). Dunning and Sherman poignantly refer to this\nphenomenon as an \"inferential prison\" and wonder whether\nstereotypes are \"maximum security prisons, with people's\ninferences and impressions of the person never escaping far\nfrom the confines of the stereotype\" (p. 459), or whether\npeople can escape these prisons as knowledge increases.1\nLanguage is one area where gender roles and expectations\ncan be constructed and reproduced. The notions that through\nlanguage women exhibit same-sex solidarity and \"support\"\nwhereas men harass and \"control\" (Fishman, 1978) or that\nwomen talk to foment or enhance relationships, while men\ntalk to solve problems, are among the most entrenched gen-\neralizations found in popular culture and are widely exploited\nby the advertising industry, among other media (Talbot,\n2000). These views, however, have been challenged in recent\nlanguage and gender literature. For instance, Eckert and\nMcConnell-Ginet (1992) argue that these gendered portray-\nals derive from research on the American White middle class\nand are far from being universal. Verbal practices that contra-\ndict the stereotypical generalizations have been documented\nby Ochs (1992) in her study of Western Samoan households,\nby Bierback (1997) in her study of a Barcelona neighbor-\nhood association, by Morgan (1991) in a study of African\nAmerican discursive practices, and by Macaulay (2001) in\nEisenchlas 3\nher study of political radio and television interviews, among\nothers. Research on gendered practices in Computer\nMediated Communication (CMC) has also yielded conflict-\ning results; while some studies report correlations between\nThese contradictory findings suggest that gendered lin-\nguistic practices are highly context-specific, and that the\ncontext of the interaction may be more important than gender\nper se in determining linguistic behavior (Cameron, 1992;\nRodino, 1997). Thus, rather than looking for binary categori-\nzations of gendered behaviors, current scholarship focuses\non localized instances, and on how gender is socially per-\nformed, co-constructed, and negotiated in interactions\n2001). The concept of Communities of Practice (CofP) has\nbeen particularly fruitful in examining the construction of\ngender through language. CofP has been defined as \"an\naggregate of people who come together around mutual\nengagement in some common endeavour. Ways of doing\nthings, ways of talking, beliefs, values, power relations--in\nshort, practices emerge in this course of mutual endeavour\"\nthe present study do not constitute a community in the strict\nsense of the term as their interactions are usually limited to a\nsingle exchange, which is insufficient to develop common\npractices. It is likely then that in giving advice, participants\nare drawing on preexisting norms of how this speech act\nshould be expressed, rather than on their knowledge of\ncoparticipants in the interaction or the norms of the particular\ngroup.\nGender and Prosocial Behaviors\n\"Prosocial behaviours\" are \"behaviors consensually regarded\nas beneficial to others,\" and include actions such as helping,\nsharing, comforting, guiding, rescuing, and defending\ncan be considered as one type of prosocial behavior.\nAlthough experimental studies on prosocial behaviors\nhave shown that men and women readily help others in need,\nbeliefs about gender roles lead to the expectation that differ-\nences in helping behavior would obtain across genders:\nWomen will approach help in ways that are primarily com-\nmunal, whereas men will have primarily an agentic focus.\nOutside of academia, these notions have been popularized by\nbooks such as You Just Don't Understand (Tannen, 1990),\nwhich claim that men \"report talk,\" that is, they talk to solve\nproblems, while women \"rapport talk,\" that is, they talk to\nfoment or enhance relationships. Grey (1992), in the book\nthat became probably the biggest seller in its category, Men\nAre From Mars, Women Are From Venus, endorses these dis-\ntinctions and claims that these differences in communication\nacross genders are universal.2 Moreover, if these are internal-\nized expectations, the sex of the advice seeker should have as\nbig an effect on the type of advice offered as the sex of the\nadvice giver, in particular, in situations where extragender\nvariables are unknown and the only salient variable is sex.\nOne area where these expectations can be explored is in\ncomputer-mediated interactions among strangers. Following\nits wide expansion across all demographics, the Internet was\ninitially hailed as an inherently democratizing medium that\nwould enable access to all those with literacy skills and tech-\nnological savvy, making social differences irrelevant or\ninvisible online. Contrary to early expectations, however,\nclaims of widespread gender equality have not been sup-\nported by most research on online interaction (Harp &\nresearch examining chats, forums, and listservs has found\nthat certain phenomena associated with stereotypical charac-\nterizations of gendered linguistic behavior were not dimin-\nished but actually reinforced online.3 Thus, if the type of\nadvice is guided by implicit gender stereotypes, there is little\nreason to believe that the medium of interaction will impose\ndramatic departures from societal norms. Rather, it is\nexpected that off-line gender dynamics will likely be repro-\nduced online and that gender expectations found off-line will\ncreep into online interactions.\nThe Present Study\nTo test whether the distinction between expectations of\nagency and communality obtains outside the English speak-\ning environment, this study extends the discussion into\nSpanish language, by investigating whether there is a rela-\ntionship between gender and the type of advice people give\nand receive online from unknown interlocutors. Its particular\nconcern is advice on difficulties in intimate relationships.\nPrevious studies on advice giving (online and off-line) have\nexamined expert\u00adnonexpert interactions (e.g., DeCapua &\nissues of power, hierarchy, or expertise can play a significant\nrole in advice givers' linguistic expressions (Vine, 2009).\nPeer-to-peer advice among strangers has received signifi-\ncantly less attention.\nThe present study is part of a larger investigation explor-\ning gendered linguistic practices in peer-to-peer online\nadvice giving, focusing on the discursive formulation of\nadvice tokens in the Spanish language (Author, 2012). It was\nexpected that, if stereotypical characterizations of gendered\nbehavior hold (e.g., Tannen, 1990), considerable differences\nbetween men and women would be found in the formulation\nof advice on relationships difficulties, with men being con-\ncise and direct and women being more emotionally expres-\nsive, exhibiting higher displays of emotional language and\nhigher levels of indirectness to protect others'feelings. These\nexpectations were not supported, as no significant differ-\nences were found in the discursive formulation4 of advice\ndispensed by males and females. Instead, the data showed\nthat males and females were very direct in their advice,\n4 SAGE Open\nSex Frequency %\nTable 2. Advice Receivers' Sex (n = 223).\nSex Frequency %\nfavoring bald directives over all other possible linguistic\nexpressions. Furthermore, it was expected that the sex of the\naddressee would trigger different responses in terms of\ndirectness and politeness, with men receiving advice\nexpressed in blunter, more direct formulations. Contrary to\nexpectations, the sex of the addressee did not make a signifi-\ncant difference, as males and females were equally forward\nand direct when dispensing advice to either sex. Thus, the\nexpectation that there would be marked differences in the\nlanguage used online by males and females, as suggested by\nprevious research (Herring, 1993 and subsequent work; Selfe\nThe lack of attested differences in the discursive formula-\ntion of advice in online interactions, however, need not cor-\nrelate with lack of gender differences in the type of advice.\nAs shown in the literature, implicit gender role stereotypes\ncan be activated when identifying information is minimal\n(Kunda & Sherman-Williams, 1993). In the data analyzed in\nthis article, the only demographic information that partici-\npants explicitly provided about themselves was their sex, and\nthus it is expected that the sex of the discussants will be a\nsalient factor in the interaction. Thus, the present study seeks\nto contribute epistemically to this area through an examina-\ntion of the effect of the sex of online interlocutors on the type\nof advice given to them, that is, what type of advice is given\nto males and females--not just what type of advice they pro-\nduce--and to identify whether implicit stereotypes play a\nrole.\nBased on the above discussion, the following hypotheses\nwere formulated and tested in the present study:\nHypothesis 1: There will be a difference between the\nadvice given by men and by women.\nHypothesis 2: Men will be more likely to be advised to\nact and women to communicate.\nHypothesis 3: There will be a difference in the type of\ntalking advice given to men and to women.\nHypothesis 4: As advice givers and as interlocutors,\nwomen will exhibit more emotional disclosure and dis-\nplay than men.\nMethodological Approach\nComputer-mediated discourse analysis (CMDA; Herring,\n2004) was used to investigate production mechanisms of\nadvice giving within a small corpus of online advice col-\nlected in web-based discussion forums. CMDA attempts to\ncharacterize how the properties of computer-mediated inter-\nactive written discourse are influenced by social and cultural\nfactors. This method is particularly well suited to systemati-\ncally explore the quality and quantity of particular properties\nof the language used online. This data collection method has\na number of advantages over others: (a) it enables direct\naccess to online behavior and socialization patterns in inter-\nactional settings; (b) as the data, although written, also\nexhibits features of spoken language (Soffer, 2010; Yates,\nactually say or write rather than speculate about or infer from\nspeakers' intuitions or knowledge of prescribed norms,\nwhich are not always reliable indicators of behavior (one of\nthe problems of surveys and discourse completion question-\nnaires); (c) it can yield a large number of linguistic tokens\nthat can be used easily to create a corpus without the time\nand effort involved in transcribing oral interactions (one of\nthe limitations of Conversation Analysis); and (d) it can\naccommodate text-based as well as graphic signs such as\nemoticons, which form a crucial part of the message.\nThe Data\nThe corpus of advice offers analyzed in this article was col-\nlated from responses to 17 questions posted by males and\nlanguage sites (the appendix lists the websites consulted).\nTwo of these sites were primarily advice oriented (i.e.,\nAcomplejados, PSICOFXP), while the others were open\nforums. In both cases, participants choose the topics of the\nquestions and obtained responses from peers, not from pro-\nfessionals.5 The questions posted asked for advice on how to\nbreak up with a boyfriend or girlfriend without hurting their\ncontributors. In all, 169 of the posts indicated the sex of their\ncontributor--86 from males and 83 from females--while for\nthe remaining 54 posts the contributor's sex was unspecified.\nwere females. These figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2,\nrespectively.\nProcedure\nThe vast bulk of online posts included in the analysis were\ntreated as advice on the basic criteria that the respondent has\nEisenchlas 5\nused (a) explicitly marked recommendations; (b) directives,\nwhich in Spanish are typically expressed through impera-\ntives (\"positive commands\") or subjunctives following nega-\ntion (\"negative commands\"); (c) modal verbs of obligation;\n(d) value judgment or impersonal expressions; or (e) that the\nresponse included a personal experience that offered an\nimplicit but unambiguous suggestion on a course of action to\ntake. Examples of each type are shown in Table 3. The strat-\negy type is given in the left column, followed by an example\nin Spanish and its translation.\nResponses limited to sharing an experience but that did\nnot propose a solution, or where the focus was on criticizing\nor abusing the advice seeker did not qualify as advice follow-\ning the strict criteria adopted for this study and were thus\ndisregarded. All websites used, except for Yahoo Mexico and\nVogue Espa\u00f1a, were from Argentina, as the list of sites in the\nappendix reveals. However, the respondents' backgrounds\nvaried more than the list suggests due to the global\naccessibility that the Internet affords. This was evident in the\nrespondents' use of regionalisms that are not typical of\nArgentinian Spanish, and whose origin could not be identi-\nfied in some instances. For this reason, respondents' geo-\ngraphical backgrounds, which could have yielded cross-\ndialectal differences, were ignored in this study.\nHaving identified the posts that fulfilled the criteria, the\nnext step of analysis consisted of systematically classifying\nand coding each post according to the type of advice given.\nThree clearly distinct categories emerged, with the advice\ngivers recommending that the advice seeker (1) embark on\nsome sort of action or (2) talk with their partner, and this\nadvice type involved either (2a) telling the truth or (2b) lying\nor giving excuse. Many responses in Category 2b show\nattempts at humor, either as a mitigating strategy or as a way\nof mocking the advice seeker. A third strategy involved pre-\nsenting alternatives (y . . . si no hay m\u00e1s onda . . . deciselo . .\n. o desaparece [well, if there is no vibe . . . tell him . . . or\ndisappear]). As very few posts used this strategy, the results\nwere subsumed into the relevant first two strategies. Table 4\npresents an example of each type of advice strategy found in\nthe data. The response type is given in the left column, fol-\nlowed by an example from the corpus and its translation in\nthe central and right columns, respectively.\nThe next step involved quantifying the frequency distri-\nbution of the different strategies. A total of six measures of\nadvice (three to male advice seekers, three to female advice\nseekers) were examined in terms of the extent to which the\nfrequency of these categories of advice differed when given\nby male versus female advice givers. Participants' advice\nwas reported in terms of sex of advice giver and frequency of\nadvice giving per sex of advisee. Twenty percent of the posts\nTable 3.

Overall, advice givers' most fre-\nquently recommended strategy to deal with the break up situ-\nation, mentioned by 63% of participants, was to \"talk\" with\nthe boyfriend or girlfriend and either discuss the situation or\nexplain why they wanted to break up the relationship.\nHowever, the examination of frequencies and percentages\nper strategy category reveals some interesting trends when\nthe sex of the advice giver is taken into account. The type of\nadvice dispensed by males seems evenly distributed between\nthe two strategies, with a marginal but not significant trend\ntoward \"talk\" (51% vs. 49%). But a significant difference\nwas found in female responses: Predominantly, women pre-\nferred talk to action as a means of problem solving, with 106\nrespondents (75%) recommending this strategy. Thus, the\nproportion of men who advise respondents to act was signifi-\ncantly different from the proportion of women who advise\nrespondents to act, as shown by chi-square tests conducted\nAdvice Given to Males and Females\n(Hypothesis 2)\nTable 6 summarizes the type of advice given to males and\nfemales, collapsing the responses produced by males,\nfemales, and sex-unidentified advice givers. While the table\nshows that talk was still the most recommended strategy,\nmentioned by 62% of participants, men and women received\nstrikingly different advice: Women were advised to talk by\nmost participants (i.e., 82% gave this advice with only 17.5%\nof responses advising them to act). The alternative advice\nwas given to men, although the differences were not as\nblatant: % of responses advised men to act and 45% advised\nmen to talk.

Although this tendency was more marked in\nfemales, a chi-square test conducted on these data reveals no\nsignificant difference between the type of talking advice\nTable 8 summarizes the type of talking advice given to\nmen and women by males, females, and gender-unspecified\nparticipants (n = 139).

Given the limited tokens found in the post, statistical\nanalyses were not conducted on these data.\nPersonal Disclosure\nA number of advice responses included sharing personal\nexperiences of feelings similar to the ones described by the\nadvice seeker, either as a means to establish solidarity or\nempathy with the advice seeker or to establish the respon-\ndent's expertise to offer advice. Furthermore, in nine of the\nposts excluded from previous analyses and classified as\n\"nonadvice,\" respondents apologized for not being able to\noffer advice but shared past or current experiences with\nadvice seekers, thus expressing empathy with their peer. An\nexample can be seen in the following post:\nla verdad que no te puedo dar ninguna solucion xq tenemos\ncasos iguales . . . [The truth is that I can't give you an answer as\nwe are going through similar cases]\nDrawing on stereotypical expectations about gendered\ninteractions, it was predicted that females would share expe-\nriences and disclose personal information more readily than\nmales. It was further expected that personal stories would\nmore likely be shared with females than with males, as\nfemales are typically viewed as relationship oriented. Yet,\nthese expectations were not met. Of the 56 instances of per-\nsonal experiences shared by advice givers, 27 were produced\nby females and 29 by males. Interestingly, males and females\nseemed more willing to share experiences with males, who\nwere the recipients of 43 (77%) of the reports on\nexperiences.\nEmotional Display\n\"Emotional display\" refers to verbal and nonverbal reactions\nelicited in advice givers by the advice seekers'predicaments.\nBased on stereotypical characterizations of gendered emo-\ntional display, it was expected that women would be more\nemotionally expressive than males, and thus their messages\nwould exhibit greater expressions of empathy and sympathy.\nExpressions of sympathy online involve emotive reactions,\nsuch as reporting one's own reactions and feelings about\nanother's troubles (nomas de leerte ya me rompiste el cora-\nzon [just from reading you [your post] you've already broken\nmy heart]), using nicknames, greetings and farewells, tokens\nof encouragement, offers of additional help, and use of emot-\nicons and graphical icons to represent emotions. However, as\nanger is believed to be more characteristic of males (Brody,\nmales would produce more tokens of abuse or flaming.\nMoreover, given the historical imbalance of power between\nmen and women, more sexist remarks were expected from\nmale than from female respondents. These expectations were\nonly partly met. In the following discussion, I examine the\nuse of some of these devices.\nNicknames and Terms of Endearment\nNicknames can be defined as informal names given to indi-\nviduals in place of their given names.6 Although nicknames\ncan be humorous, disparaging, or affectionate, very few of\nthe nicknames found in the data were derogatory. As partici-\npants do not know each other, using an affectionate nick-\nname to refer to the addressee can be seen as either an attempt\nto establish solidarity and show empathy, or as an unwar-\nranted--thus unwelcome--act of familiarity, as in the case\nof \"street remarks\" (Gardner, 1980). The expectation that,\ndue to their nurturing characteristics, females would estab-\nlish solidarity with other females by using a greater number\nof nicknames was not met. The total number of nicknames\nused was 35, of which 31 were used by males and only 4 by\nfemales. More remarkable is that males used nicknames pre-\ndominantly to address other males (n = 27) and only 4 to\naddress females. This seems to indicate that nicknames act\nhere as a male bonding practice.\nThe attempt to establish solidarity with the addressee is\nevident in the nicknames used by males. The most frequently\nused nickname was amigo [friend] and its variants (e.g.,\ncompa\u00f1ero [mate], camarada [comrade]; n = 10); flaco (lit.\nskinny), loco (lit. crazy), chav\u00f3n, compadrito, pibe, all\nroughly equivalent to \"dude\" (n = 10); family terms (papa\n[dad], hermano [brother]; n = 2); and references to masculin-\nity (var\u00f3n, macho; n = 2). There were only two female uses\nof nicknames for male advice seekers (ni\u00f1o, nene [boy]),\nwhich can be seen as derogatory and patronizing. Terms used\nby males to address female advice seekers included a title\n(se\u00f1orita [young lady]) and terms of endearment (amiga\n[friend], amor [love], xica [chica] [girl]), but as indicated,\nthese were extremely rare in the data.\nText-Based and Graphic Emoticons\nA total of 34 emoticons were found in the posts, including\nfour text-based (e.g., XD; =); =P; :() and 30 graphic. The\nmost frequently used emoticon was the graphical smiley \n(n = 9), followed by thumbs up (n = 7). Most of the\nTable 8.

Despite expectations to the contrary and con-\nsistent with Huffaker and Calvert's (2005) findings, male\nrespondents produced more graphic expressions of emotions\nthan females. Moreover, while no differences were found in\nfemale use of emoticons according to the sex of the addressee,\nmales used significantly more emoticons when advising\nfemales than when advising males. Table 9 summarizes these\nfindings.\nGreetings, Farewells, and Encouragement\nUnlike greetings, which were not frequent (n = 11), farewells\nand expressions of encouragement were very common in the\ndata, comprising a total of 115 tokens. Many advice seekers\nended their posts with wishes of good luck, expressing the\nhope that the advice they offered will be useful, or that the\nadvice seeker feels happier soon (ojala q result todo bien\npara vos pibe! [I hope it all works out for you boy!]).\nExpressions of affection toward unknown advice seekers\nwere also frequent (e.g., un abrazo gigante [a giant hug], un\nbesito [a small kiss], un besote [a big kiss]), as were positive\nevaluations of the advice seeker (se ve que sos una buena\npersona [it is clear that you are a good person]) and promises\nthat the advice given will work. A few respondents ended the\npost by offering additional help (si le ha parecido mi consejo\npuede hacermelo saber o le puedo seguir ayudando mi e\nmail es . . . [if you think of my advice you can let me know\nor I can continue to help my e-mail is . . .]. Farewells and\nexpressions of encouragement were grouped together\nbecause at times these could not be clearly separated; some\nexpressions can serve the two functions (e.g., suerte [good\nluck]). These expressions were evenly produced by males\n(n = 56) and females (n = 59). The distribution across recipi-\nents was also balanced, with males receiving 57 of these\ntokens and females 58.\nFlaming\nConsistent with findings in previous studies (Herring, 1993,\nwere in posts by males. A post was deemed as \"abusive\" if it\ncontained an insulting or derogatory evaluation of the advice\nseeker or their partner, as in the following example:\nSos una basura. Ojala te pise un tren a vos [You're rubbish. I\nhope you get hit by a train.]\nOverall, there were 24 tokens of abuse in the responses\n(including nonadvice responses); some directed at the part-\nner of the advice seeker, some at the advice seekers them-\nselves as in the example above. Most of the abusive responses\nwere produced by males (n = 17) rather than by females\n(n = 7), and most were directed at males (n = 17) rather than\nat females (n = 7).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to explore whether gender roles\nand expectations identified in the literature are reproduced in\nonline interactions. The context chosen for this investigation\nwas one particular type of prosocial behavior, peer-to-peer\nadvice given in Spanish language forums. As advice givers\nignore all demographic information about advice receivers\nexcept for their sex, it was expected that sex would become\nthe salient factor in the interaction and impact on the type of\nadvice, thus revealing implicit role stereotypes and expecta-\ntions. The study explored advice as a factor of the sex of\nadvice givers (when this could be ascertained) and of advice\nreceivers.\nFour hypotheses were formulated. The first two hypothe-\nses addressed the expectation that there would be differences\nin the type of advice given by men and women (Hypothesis\n1), and that these differences would correlate with expecta-\ntions of agency and communality (Hypothesis 2).\nFurthermore, differences were expected in the type of \"talk-\ning\" advice given to men and women, with men expected to\nrecommend offering excuses or lying more frequently than\nwomen (Hypothesis 3). Finally, Hypothesis 4 focused on\nwhether the sex of advice givers conforms to the expected\ndisplay of emotional expression in females' response posts,\nand lack of emotion--other than anger--in males' posts.\nWith regard to Hypothesis 1, significant differences were\nfound in the type of advice dispensed by males and females\nand thus the hypothesis was supported. The data showed\nthat, while men were evenly divided between the two main\ncategories of peer-to-peer advice they offered, \"act\" and\n\"talk,\" women overwhelmingly preferred talk to action as a\nmean of problem solving. The results are consistent with the\nstereotypical view of women as communal and relationship\norientated.\nHypothesis 2 was strongly supported by the data. While\n\"talk\" was the overall preferred strategy, the gender of advice\nseekers affected the type of the advice given to them: Women\nwere advised to talk by the majority of respondents (n =\n82.5%), while men were mostly advised to act (n = 55%).\nAlthough the difference in proportions between the \"act\"\n(55%) versus \"talk\" (45%) advice given to men were not as\nextreme as the differences in advice to women, these differ-\nences were still statistically significant. There was a strong\nEisenchlas 9\ncorrelation between the advice given to males and females\nand the two dimensions, agency and communion, proposed\nby Bakan (1966). The fact that men and women predomi-\nnantly advised men to act and women to speak indicates the\nextent to which expected gender roles have been internalized\nand are spontaneously triggered when it comes to offering\nadvice to unknown others. Thus, advice givers \"perform\"\ngender in formulating their advice, by positioning them-\nselves and others through the interaction (conf. Butler, 1990).\nHypothesis 3 was not supported, as no statistically signifi-\ncant differences were found in the type of \"talking\" advice\ndispensed by males and females. The data showed that males\nand females were equally forward in their advice, favoring\ntelling the truth over lying or giving excuses to the partner\nwhen dispensing advice to interlocutors of either sex.\nFinally, Hypothesis 4 was unsupported, as the data showed\nthat neither sex had a monopoly on affect display. While men\nproduced most expressions of anger, when it came to \"posi-\ntive\" emotions men were just as prone as women to display\nemotions online (e.g., through the use of emoticons, expres-\nsions of empathy, affections and encouragement, adulation,\npersonal disclosure, nicknames and terms of endearment\nused to address other males), at times producing more emo-\ntional tokens than women did, and not just with other males\nbut in their responses to females as well. The data showed\nconclusively that most respondents seemed genuinely inter-\nested in helping advice seekers, regardless of sex, at times\noffering additional assistance such as adding a phone number\nor email address in case the advice seeker needed to discuss\ntheir situation further. The expectation that the sex of advice\nseeker would affect the type and amount of emotion dis-\nplayed, so that women would receive more tokens of emo-\ntional support from females while advice dispensed by and to\nmales would be devoid of emotion was thus not met in the\nonline data.\nThe findings that emerge from the analysis of the data\npoint to an interesting dichotomy: With regard to the type of\nadvice, it seems clear that gender roles and expectations are\nalive and well in online encounters. In the absence of any\ndemographic information about interlocutors other than their\nsex, males and females offered advice that is consistent with\ntraditional expectations of gendered behavior along the lines\nof agency and communality. While the data discussed in this\narticle is limited to one context and one language, it contrib-\nutes to the empirical investigation of whether the traditional\ncharacterization of gender roles proposed in the literature\n(e.g., W. Wood & Eagly, 2010) are consistent with those\nfound in other cultures.\nWith regard to online use of language across genders,\nhowever, the picture that emerged is more complex than the\nstereotypically binary characterization of female versus male\nlinguistic behavior would lead us to expect, as many of the\ndifferences identified in previous research (Harp &\nwere not found in this study. Instead, the data pointed to a\nhigh degree of linguistic convergence, in particular when it\ncomes to offering emotional support.\nA few factors may explain the disparity of the findings.\nFirst, language and culture may play a role. Most of the pre-\nvious studies on advice focused on interactions in English,\nwhich may explain differences in results when investigating\nlinguistic practices operating in other languages. Second,\nmany of the previous studies have focused on expert\u00adnovice\nsituations, and thus findings may not transfer into peer-\nto-peer interactions where issues of hierarchy or expertise\nplay no role. Another possible explanation relates to the\ncharacteristics of the communication medium. Previous\nstudies on online exchanges focused on data collected from\nelectronic bulletin boards, blogs, and discussion groups,\nwhich are not anonymous. The data examined in this article\nwere collated from sites where the exchanges between par-\nticipants are one-off events. It may be precisely the anonym-\nity of online interactions that encourages men to \"open up\"\nand be more forward in expressing affect, not just abusive\nbehavior and flaming, but also positive emotions.\nAlthough the corpus on which this naturalistic study is\nbased was small, the data still pointed to some interesting\nresults. In particular, it provided further support to the claim\nthat gendered roles and expectations are triggered spontane-\nously in the absence of individuating information, as these\nare the sources from which participants draw to guide their\nadvice. This is despite discursive practices used in formulat-\ning advice suggesting greater language convergence across\nsexes. This discrepancy may indicate that the role of lan-\nguage in manifesting and/or constructing \"agency\" and\n\"communion\" needs to be further explored across types of\nsites, languages, cultures, topics, and tasks.\nAppendix\nWebsites Consulted\nAcomplejados 2 http://www.acomplejados.com\nAcomplejados 3 http://www.acomplejados.com\nEnFemenino http://foro.enfemenino.com/forum/f101/__\nEnFemenino 2 http://foro.enfemenino.com/forum/\nnovia-sin-erirla.html\nPSICOFXP http://www.psicofxp.com/forums/amor-y-\nPSICOFXP http://www.psicofxp.com/forums/amor-y-\nYahoo Argentina http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/\nYahoo Argentina 2\nCualquiera http://www.foro-cualquiera.com/tus-\nproblemas/66328-quiero-dejar-mi-novio-no-se-hacerlo\n.html\nTus preguntas http://tuspreguntas.misrespuestas.com/preg\nYahoo Mexico http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index\nYahoo Mexico http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/\nindex?qid\nVogue Espa\u00f1a http://foros.vogue.es/viewtopic\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
