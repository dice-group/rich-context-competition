Although breast\ndevelopment in girls started earlier than pubic hair de-\nvelopment, girls completed breast and pubic hair devel-\nopment at approximately the same age. Black girls were\nin all stages of breast and pubic hair development ear-\nlier than white girls. Boys were in stages 2, 3, 4, and 5 of\ngenital development before the comparable pubic hair\nstage. In boys, genital development started earlier than\npubic hair development, but pubic hair development was\ncompleted in less time. Black boys were in genital and\npubic hair development about 7 months earlier than white\nboys. Black and white boys completed genital develop-\nment in approximately 41/2 years, but black boys took ap-\nproximately 6 months longer than white boys to com-\nplete pubic hair development. At stage 2, for 66.2% of\ngirls, breast development preceded their pubic hair de-\nvelopment; for 91.1% of boys, genital development pre-\nceded their pubic hair development.\nConclusions: The results of this study are useful in un-\nderstanding normative variation in the timing and change\nin the development of secondary sexual characteristics\nat puberty.

Such research is not positioned\nto characterize change in secondary sexual\ncharacteristics--genitals, breasts, and pu-\nbic hair--that represent different physi-\nological processes. The available longitu-\ndinal evidence is outdated or covers a\nlimited age span.1 Current information on\ntiming of puberty (ie, age at which ado-\nlescents are in each sexual maturity stage)\nand change in secondary sexual charac-\nteristics (ie, how quickly individuals\nprogress from one stage to the next) is im-\nportant for understanding the etiology of\npubertal disorders as well as normal de-\nvelopment. It is also important to under-\nstand individual-level synchrony (ie, char-\nacteristics developing concurrently) or\nasynchrony (ie, one characteristic devel-\nops before the other) in pubertal devel-\nopment, given that asynchrony has impli-\ncations for health problems.2\nThis investigation was motivated by\nnew findings2 and previous work.3-5 It is\nnot known whether patterns of thelarche\nand pubarche established at pubertal\nonset are sustained longitudinally, or\nwhether patterns of asynchrony are ob-\nserved among boys. The present study\naimed to (1) identify ages when adoles-\ncents were in sexual maturity stages 2\nthrough 5 (Tanner criteria)6-8 for each\nsecondary sexual characteristic; (2) ex-\nplain the relation of development across\npubertal characteristics; and (3) evaluate\nsynchrony of pubertal development\nacross characteristics.

In 1990,\n10 university-based sites recruited participants from desig-\nnated hospitals in Little Rock, Arkansas; Irvine, California;\nLawrence,Kansas;Boston,Massachusetts;PhiladelphiaandPitts-\nburgh, Pennsylvania; Charlottesville, Virginia; Seattle, Wash-\nington; Hickory and Morgantown, North Carolina; and Madi-\nson, Wisconsin. Children were followed up from birth to age\nondary sexual characteristics was performed by a nurse prac-\ntitioner or physician. Institutional review boards at each\nuniversity and the data coordinating center approved the study.\nFamilies gave written consent and children gave assent. See a\npreviously published NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-\nwork study9 for detailed recruitment and selection procedures\nand http://secc.rti.org for study procedures.\nHealthy newborns of English-speaking mothers were re-\ncruited. Attempts were made to contact 3015 families meeting\nenrollment eligibility requirements 2 weeks after birth. Of 1526\nvisit before becoming study participants. There were no sig-\nUS population,10 except that the study sample had slightly more\nFrom enrollment to age 91/2 years, approximately 20% of\nthe sample was lost to follow-up; moving and time constraints\nwere the major reasons for attrition. Dropouts were more likely\nto have lower maternal education and to be nonwhite. Be-\n8.1%, but this attrition was random in terms of sex, annual fam-\nily income, years of maternal education, or race/ethnicity.\nChild sex, race/ethnicity, and years of maternal education were\nreported at 1 month. Only white and black participants are in-\ncluded in this report because the numbers of other minorities\nwere too small. Family income when the child was 91/2 years\nold was converted to an income-to-needs ratio based on fed-\neral poverty guidelines (ratio 2.0 represents low income).11\nBoys' and girls' sexual maturity stage was assessed using Tan-\nner criteria.7,8,12 Girls' sexual maturity staging was based on in-\nstructions from the American Academy of Pediatrics Assess-\nment of Sexual Maturity Stages in Girls,5 augmented with breast\nbud palpation (except for the assessment at age 91/2 years). The\nassessment of stage of sexual maturity is based on photos of\nthe 5 sexual maturity stages (1 indicates prepuberty and 5, full\nsexual maturity) that were used in the Pediatric Research in\nOffice Settings Network study of pubertal development.5 Boys'\nsexual maturity stage was assessed using Tanner's original cri-\nteria.6 For boys and girls, sexual maturity stage is determined\nby comparing the adolescent's sexual development with the se-\nries of photographs showing sexual maturity as stages of breast,\ngenital, and pubic hair development. Annual examinations iden-\ntified sexual maturity stage (1-5) for breast development in girls,\ngenital development in boys, and pubic hair development in\nboth. If a child was between 2 stages, the examiners gave the\nchild the lower stage rating. Examinations continued for girls\nuntil menarche and stage 5 breast and pubic hair development\nwere achieved and for boys until stage 5 genital and pubic hair\ndevelopment were achieved. Beginning at age 101/2, girls re-\nported annually whether menstruation had begun and age at\nfirst menses. Annual maternal report was used if daughter's self-\nCentralized training was provided to all examiners before\nthe first pubertal assessments. Physicians and nurse practition-\ners were annually recertified (requiring 87.5% accuracy) by rat-\ning stages of pubertal development using photos from the Pe-\ndiatric Research in Office Settings Network study of pubertal\ndevelopment5 for girls and Tanner photos for boys.13\nParticipation at each annual examination for 859 children was\nducted analyses separately on each data set. Test statistics and\ncoefficients were averaged across analyses, separately for boys\nand girls, and coefficient standard errors were calculated by com-\nbining within- and between-model variability.15\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical soft-\nware, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina);\nall tests were 2-tailed. Significant differences between chil-\ndren with and without sexual maturity data for all categorical\nvariables were evaluated using 2 tests; continuous variables\nwere evaluated using t tests, assuming unequal variance.\nEstimating Age of Sexual Maturity Stage\nThe ages that girls and boys were in each sexual maturity stage\n(2-5) were estimated for each secondary sexual characteristic\nin separate logistic regressions: breast (girls), genital (boys),\nand pubic hair (girls and boys). For this analysis, whether an\nadolescent was in a particular sexual maturity stage at each as-\nsessment was dichotomized (0 vs 1). The probability of being\nin a stage was estimated at a given age and was modeled using\na random coefficient logistic model with the dichotomized in-\ndicator of being in a particular stage as the dependent variable\nand age at each assessment (in years) as the independent vari-\nable. The intercept was treated as random (ie, individual-level\nvariation was allowed), whereas the effect of age was fixed. The\nages at which the individual had a 50% or greater likelihood of\nbeing in the particular sexual maturity stage for breast and pu-\nbic hair development (girls) or genital and pubic hair devel-\nopment (boys) were estimated.\nOnce the ages of being in the various sexual maturity stages\nfor the different secondary sexual characteristics were esti-\nmated, differences across time and across characteristics were\nmodeled using a doubly repeated measures analysis of vari-\nance. For these analyses, the estimated ages were the depen-\ndent variables, and sexual maturity stage (2-5) and secondary\nsexual characteristics (breast or pubic hair for girls; genital or\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\npubic hair for boys) were repeated (independent) factors. Ad-\nditional models added between-subjects factors for menarche\n(girls only), race (black vs white), years of maternal educa-\ntion, and family income-to-needs ratio. Finally, the length of\ntime (in years) that girls and boys remained in puberty was cal-\nculated as the difference between the ages that individuals were\nestimated to be in sexual maturity stage 5 and sexual maturity\nstage 2 (eAppendix; available at http://www.archpediatrics\n.com).\nEstimating Synchrony vs Asynchrony\nThe estimated age that each individual was predicted to be in\neach sexual maturity stage for breast (girls) or genital (boys)\nand pubic hair (girls and boys) was used to determine syn-\nchrony of pubertal maturation. Given that there is no consen-\nsus about what qualifies as a synchronous pattern, we defined\nsynchronous development as secondary sexual characteristics\nbeing in the same sexual maturity stage within approximately\n4 months of each other. This standard was based on prior lon-\ngitudinal work.17 In an individual, if the difference in the esti-\nmated age of the 2 secondary sexual characteristics was more\nthan 4 months, development was classified as breast or genital\nfirst or pubic hair first. Using age estimates obtained from the\nrandom coefficients logistic regression, the differences be-\ntween the estimated ages for breast vs pubic hair development\n(girls) and for genital vs pubic hair development (boys) were\ncalculated. Children were then classified as to whether they\nexhibited synchrony (difference 4 months) or asynchrony\n(breast or genital development 4 months earlier than pubic\nhair development or pubic hair development 4 months ear-\nlier than breast or genital development) for each sexual matu-\nrity stage.\nRESULTS\nblack boys (7.3%) had valid pubertal measurements for\nat least 1 of the 7 assessments (taken annually from\ninclusion in the study.

Only one inter-\naction between puberty characteristic and family in-\ncome-to-needs ratio was significant (F1,393\nP=.004) and indicated that girls from higher-income\nhomes experienced later breast development than did\ngirls from lower-income homes.\nSimilar to black and white girls, black boys were in\neach stage of genital and pubic hair development earlier\ndiscrepancy between ages that black and white boys were\nin each stage was greater for earlier stages (range, 9.6\nmonths-1.0 years earlier for stage 2) than it was for later\nP.001). With demographic factors controlled, these re-\nsults remained unchanged.\nCOMMENT\nThis report, to our knowledge, presents one of the most\ndetailed longitudinal studies of pubertal development in\nboys and girls conducted to date. Yearly assessments of\nbreast, genital, and pubic hair growth allowed us to ana-\nlyze the ages at which adolescents were in each sexual ma-\nturity stage and the time it took to go from one stage to\nthe next. We also examined synchrony and asynchrony in\nsecondary sexual characteristics in white and black youth.\nBreast development in girls and genital development\nin boys tended to begin before pubic hair development.\nBut pubic hair development occurred faster across the\nstages than did genitals or breasts. In addition, syn-\nchrony between breast or genital and pubic hair stages\ntended to increase with advancing stages.\nOur findings are consistent with cross-sectional stud-\nies showing that girls' pubertal development occurs ear-\nlier than boys', a putative consequence of earlier estro-\ngen synthesis.18 Our observation that breast development\nin girls and genital development in boys precedes pubic\nhair development is also consistent with previous stud-\nAlthough Biro et al2 estimated asynchrony in early pu-\nberty, we extended this analysis by assessing synchrony\nor asynchrony at 4 sexual maturity stages (2-5). At the\nearly stages of puberty, we typically observed asyn-\nchrony between breast and pubic hair stage in girls and\ngenital and pubic hair stage in boys. At later stages of\nsexual maturity, although development in boys re-\nmained asynchronous, breast development and pubic hair\ndevelopment in girls tended to become more synchro-\nnous. The pattern in girls is believed to result from the\nearlier timing of hormonal changes, starting with the ini-\ntiation of cyclic gonadotropin-releasing hormone of a mag-\nnitude sufficient to stimulate gonadotropin and estro-\ngen production,19 which stimulates growth of breast tissue.\nPubic hair growth is stimulated by testosterone and ad-\nTable 5.

Girls who fol-\nlow the breast-first pattern may have higher estrogen lev-\nels and be more at risk as adults for estrogen-related dis-\neases, such as breast cancer, than those following a pubic\nhair\u00adfirst pattern.\nFindings indicate that, at any age, black adolescents\nare more advanced than white adolescents in pubertal de-\nvelopment, consistent with prior research.5,20,21 The ear-\nlier onset of puberty in black youth has been attributed\nto genetic factors, higher body mass index, and nutri-\ntional factors.20 No ethnic differences were observed in\nthe length of time it took to progress from one sexual\nmaturity stage to the next for girls. In contrast, sexual\ndevelopment in black boys took longer than in white boys.\nThese detailed findings suggest that pubertal devel-\nopment cannot be described exclusively in terms of a\nsimple onset and termination because different second-\nary sexual characteristics develop on different sched-\nules that show varying degrees of timing, depending on\nsex and ethnicity. For future research, the present find-\nings raise the question of whether previously reported\nrisks for morbidity related to the timing of puberty on-\nset (eg, metabolic syndrome and reproductive malignan-\ncies22) are associated solely with entry into puberty or\nwhether continuing asynchrony in secondary sexual char-\nacteristics might also be associated with morbidity.\nAlthough drawn from sites distributed throughout the\nUnited States, and reflecting a range of economic, so-\ncial, and educational backgrounds, the sample is not rep-\nresentative of the US population because it is not a prob-\nability sample. The findings may also be biased because\nof dropouts and missing data. Otherwise-eligible chil-\ndren whose mothers were known drug users or who did\nnot intend to continue living near a study site were ex-\ncluded from the study. An additional limitation of the\nstudy is that at the assessment at age 91/2 years, we did\nnot use breast bud palpation, which may have led to an\nunderestimation of the percentage of girls at develop-\nmental stage 2. Nonetheless, this research used a highly\nreliable protocol for assessing pubertal development.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe descriptive findings from this study are useful in un-\nderstanding normative variation in the timing and change\nin secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. They will\nhelp identify children with atypical changes in sexual\nmaturation and unusual progression of sexual matura-\ntion and growth disorders. Replication of this study in a\nrepresentative sample is now needed.\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Biobehavioral Health,\nThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park (Dr\nSusman); Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,\nDuke University, Durham, North Carolina (Dr Houts);\nDepartment of Psychology, Temple University, Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania (Dr Steinberg); Institute for the Study\nof Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck Uni-\nversity of London, England (Dr Belsky); Department of\nPsychology and Social Behavior, University of Califor-\nnia, Irvine (Dr Cauffman); Department of Psychology,\nState University of New York, Geneseo (Dr DeHart); CNA\nCorporation, Alexandria, Virginia (Dr Friedman); De-\npartment of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign (Dr Roisman); and Division of Adolescent\nMedicine, Department of Pediatrics,University of Cali-\nfornia, San Francisco (Dr Halpern-Felsher).\nCorrespondence: Elizabeth J.
