Numerous studies have\ndemonstrated an association of the APOE polymorphism\nand the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD), including\natherosclerosis and stroke [2, 3]. The APOE polymorphism\nhas also been reported to be associated with mortality\nrisk [4, 5]; these findings are controversial, however, as a\nnumber of recent studies did not reveal a relationship\nbetween APOE alleles and mortality [6, 7].\nIt was hypothesised that the APOE polymorphism\nmight be associated with other adverse health outcomes\naffecting the functional status of individuals [8, 9]. This\nhypothesis is justified by the association of a low level\nof high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with disability in\nolder individuals [10, 11], but knowledge of the association\nof the APOE polymorphism with disability remains limited.\nFor example, it was shown that the APOE 4 allele was\nassociatedwithpoorfunctionalstatusincommunity-dwelling\nolder Americans who retained normal cognitive function [8].\nLater studies of Italian octo- and nonagenarians, however,\ndid not show such an association [12]. Moreover, while\nthe APOE 4 allele was not associated with a population-\nwide decline in functional status in the Duke Established\nAPOE gene, disability, and mortality\nPopulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\n(EPESE) participants [13], female carriers of the APOE\n4 allele, particularly those who had comparatively good\nbaseline functional scores, did exhibit significant functional\ndeclines [13]. Further analyses of the EPESE data show no\nassociations between the APOE 4 status and any of the\nfive dimensions of quality of life [14]. More recently, it was\nshown that the APOE 4 polymorphism is associated with\nan excess of mobility limitation but not with self-reported\nfunctional limitations [9].\nAn interpretation of the prevalence of APOE polymor-\nphism in samples of old versus younger individuals has\nsuggested that APOE is a `longevity' gene [15]. However,\nwhile the APOE 4 allele has been shown to signifi-\ncantly increase risks of certain disorders (e.g. CVD, AD),\nits effect on total mortality was not found to be substantial\nin recent studies [16, 17]. This suggests a possible protective\neffect of the APOE 4 allele on risks of other disorders.\nAPOE has also been viewed as a `frailty' gene rather than a\n`longevity' gene [16, 17]. Disability is often viewed as a man-\nifestation of stress vulnerability in older people [18]; such\nvulnerability is referred to as `frailty' by demographers [19].\nAlthough physiological frailty and disability are generally\ndistinct concepts [18], they partly overlap since disability is\nassociated with physiological frailty [18, 20]. If that is the\ncase, a stronger association of the APOE genotypes with\ndisability than mortality would suggest a greater impact upon\nfrailty than upon longevity.\nIn this work we analyse sex-specific associations among\nsubjects stratified by disability status and specific APOE\ngenotypes in a sample of the 1999 National Long Term\nCare Survey (NLTCS) for whom biological specimens were\ncollected. The phenotype of mortality was also investigated.\nWeaddresstwomainquestions:(i) isdisabilitystatussensitive\nto the APOE polymorphism? (ii) do gene actions of various\ngenotypic variants function more as modulators of frailty\nrather than of longevity?\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe NLTCS is a nationally representative survey which\nprovides a large set of self- and proxy-reported data (several\nthousands variables, depending on the NLTCS wave) on\nhealth and functioning of the US elderly with a particular\nfocus on disabled individuals. Each of five NLTCS waves\nis linked to Medicare service use and vital statistics files\nconsidered to be one of the best designed surveys to assess\nchronic disability (activity limitations due to disability or\nhealth problems which require either active help or standby\nhelp, or equipment use and last 90+ days [21]) in the US\nelderly (65+) individuals [22]. To complete the NLTCS,\na two-stage interviewing process was used. A screening\ninterview assessing chronic disability was given to all\nparticipants randomly selected from the Medicare enrollees.\nA detailed interview was given to (i) those who reported\nat least one chronic impairment in (instrumental) activities\nof daily living (I)ADL, (ii) institutionalised individuals, and\n(iii) those who received a detailed interview in a previous\nsamples of individuals who were designated for detailed\ninterviews before being give a test on disability. Therefore,\nby the survey design, disabled persons are over-sampled in\ndetailed questionnaires (for details see [21] and references\ntherein) that provide unique opportunity to focus on such\nvulnerable portion of the older population.\nblood and buccal cell samples were collected to assess the\neffects of selected genetic markers on human longevity and\nphysical function. The APOE 2, 3 and 4 alleles were\ndetermined by the presence or absence of certain restriction\nsites [23]. Assays were done for 1,805 individuals. To test for\nthe reproducibility of the genotyping, 47 peripheral blood\n4/4) were re-genotyped using two different methods: the\noriginal restriction digestion method [23] and an automated\nsequencing method [24]. The results with all three assays\nwere concordant for each of the genotypes.\nFor seven individuals, information on disability was\nmissing, and thus they were excluded from the analysis.\nof interview. The frequencies of the APOE polymorphism\nDisability measures\nInformation on disability is assessed from the NLTCS\ncommunity and institutional questionnaires. Community\nquestionnaire covers 96.4% of the genetic sub-sample\nand assesses six impairments in ADL [25] (eating, getting\nin/out of bed, getting around inside, getting to the\nbathroom/using the toilet, dressing and bathing) and ten\nimpairments associated with IADL [26] (doing heavy work,\ndoing light work, doing laundry, cooking, shopping for\ngroceries, getting around outside, going places outside of\nwalking distance, managing money, making telephone calls\nand taking medicines). Remainder of the sample (n = 65)\nrepresents institutional population which was interviewed\nonly on ADL impairments [21]. Since our analysis shows\nthat inclusion/exclusion of institutionalised individuals does\nnot significantly affect the estimates, we did not distinguish\nbetween institutional and community samples. We have\nfound that the efficient way for analysis is to dichotomise\nthe disability measures selecting three indicators of: (i) any\nIADL); (ii) IADL-only disability (IADL-only, n = 252, 97\nA. Kulminski et al.\nmales; at least one IADL and no ADL), and (iii) ADL\nirrespective of IADL). Since the IADLs reflect generally\nless serious disabilities, while ADLs reflect more serious\ndisabilities [27], by selecting the latter two groups we cover\ndisabilities with distinct severity levels [22]. A reference\ngroup was composed of non-disabled individuals (Non-dis,\nAnalysis\nStatistical analyses of the data were performed using SPSS\nsoftware (release 12.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). To test the\nassociation of distinct disability groups with the APOE\ngenotypes, we used empirical analyses (t-statistics, chi-\nsquare) and logistic regression analyses. Since the results\nof both these approaches were qualitatively similar, only\nthe results of logistic models were retained. The relationship\nbetween the APOE genotypes and mortality was tested using\nthe Cox proportional hazard regression models. Relative\nrisks (RR) of death were calculated over the follow-up time\n(to August, 2003). Analyses were performed for males and\nfemales combined and then for each sex (all models were\nadjusted for age). In each analysis we used dichotomised\nindices indicating carriers of given genotype(s) as contrasted\nto carriers of all other genotypes (e.g. the 2/3 genotype\nversus non-2/3 genotypes) and to carriers of the 3/3\ngenotype. Genetic studies involving multiple genes/alleles\noften require correction for multiple testing [28]. They are\nnecessary to examine for `at least one genetic effect' among\nthe variety of genetic factors subject to testing. Since this\nis obviously not the case in our study, the correction for\nmultiple testing is not required [29].\nResults\nFigure 1 depicts the results of pair-wise logistic regression\nanalyses [odds ratio; (OR)] of the associations between\ndisability and the APOE genotypes for the entire sample.

In this study we examined\nan association of the APOE genotypes with disability of\ndifferent severity and mortality to clarify two issues. First, we\nchecked whether there is an association between a particular\nAPOE genotype and disability. Second, we contributed to\nthe discussion on whether APOE can be considered as a\nUnlike studies by Albert et al. [8] and in support of studies\nby Melzer et al. [9] and Blazer et al. [13], our analysis does not\nshow significantly increased risks of disability in carriers of\nthe three APOE genotypes bearing an 4 allele. Contrary to\nAlbert et al. [8], our analysis reveals protection of the APOE\n4/4 genotype against disability. Specifically, non-4/4\nfemale carriers have 5.3 times greater chance of having more\nsevere (ADL) impairments than the APOE 4/4 female\ncarriers. We also reveal a protective function of 3/3 and an\nadverse function of 2/3 in males with less severe (IADL)\ndisability.\nOur analysis shows that the associations between the\nAPOE polymorphism and disability involve at least three\nfactors: the effects of genotype, severity of disability and\nsex. Aggregation/disaggregation of the data along these\ndimensions provides qualitatively different results that can\npartly explain the disagreement of published studies. First,\nwe show that disaggregation of disability is important.\nSpecifically, while certain genotypes can affect mild disability,\nthey might be irrelevant to severe impairments (e.g. 3/3\nA. Kulminski et al.\ngenotype, see Figure 1). Second, particular genotypes having\nthe same allele can contribute to the combined effect in\ndifferent ways. For example, 2/3 carriers have larger\nchances of less severe disabilities (IADL), 3/4 carriers\nare neutral to the presence of IADLs, and 3/3 carriers\nhave a significantly lower chances of IADL impairments\n(Figure 1). The neutral and opposite tendencies exhibited by\nthese genotypes result in no association between less severe\ndisability and the 3-allele. Finally, sex also appears to be\nimportant, revealing additional significant associations, i.e.\nadverse function of the 2/3 genotype in males and neutral\nimpact in females on less severe disability. Obviously, other\nfactors (e.g. age and the APOE-associated diseases) might\ncontribute to the revealed associations; those issues deserve\nAnother intriguing finding is that none of the six APOE\ngenotypes is predictive of mortality in a Cox regression\nanalyses. Given the significance of the association of a\nparticular APOE genotype with disability and the association\nof disability with frailty [20], as well as the lack of significance\nfor association of the same genotype with mortality, support\nis provided for the view that APOE gene actions may be\nmore significant as modulators of frailty than of longevity\nKey points\n\u00b7 Early studies generally reported no association of APOE\npolymorphism with disability.\n\u00b7 The present NLTCS study demonstrates associations\nbetween disability and APOE genotypes.\n\u00b7 Female 4/4 carriers and male 3/3 carriers have\ndiminished chances of developing more serious (ADL)\ndisabilities than the respective non-carriers.\n\u00b7 The 2/3 genotype increases the chance of less serious\n(IADL) impairments for males.\nFunding\nThe research reported in this article was supported by\nNational Institute on Aging (NIA).\nConflicts of interest\nEach co-author asserts no proprietary interest in the results\nand no financial conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.
