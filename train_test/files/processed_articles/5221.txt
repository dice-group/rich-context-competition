Arguments for the importance\nof engagement in higher education have been directed at\ncampus leadership and have focused primarily on the bene-\nfits for institutions as a means of communicating the credi-\nbility and usefulness of universities as important institutions\nin civic life (Brukardt, Holland, Percy, & Zimpher, 2004;\nKellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant\nUniversities, 1999; TRUCEN: The Research University\nCivic Engagement Network, 2008). While this call for higher\neducation to return to its civic mission is critical for support-\ning and advancing SL pedagogy, many questions remain\nabout the role faculty play as catalysts for the ongoing cul-\ntural and pedagogical shift toward engagement.\nOver the last 30 years, adoption of SL pedagogy in U.S.\nhigher education has grown as colleges and universities\nexplore ways to increase experiential learning opportunities\nfor students to apply what they are learning to local and\nglobal issues (Campus Compact, 2012). In SL courses, stu-\ndents engage in meaningful service activities and critical\nreflection on the service experience to enhance academic\nlearning, deepen civic understanding, and provide some\nmutual benefit to the community through their work (Bringle\n& Hatcher, 1996). SL is a form of community and civic\nengagement; however, it differs from volunteerism or philan-\nthropy by making relevant service a critical component of\nthe teaching and learning activities in a course. SL best prac-\ntices encourage faculty to consider the following when\ndesigning SL courses: develop academic learning goals that\nare connected to and reinforced by the SL activity, establish\nrelationships with community partners that are mutually ben-\neficial, and integrate critical reflection throughout the course\nto connect the service with the learning goals.\nBringle and Hatcher (1995) assert that the faculty role in\ninstitutionalizing SL should not be underestimated as faculty\nare primarily responsible for the direction and design of cur-\nriculum and are therefore gatekeepers for the adoption and\npromotion of innovative pedagogies such as SL. However,\naccording to Tierney and Bensimon (1996), faculty social-\nization through the organizational structure of departments\n1University of Georgia, Athens, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSu-I Hou, Associate Professor and OSL Service-Learning Senior Scholar,\nDepartment of Health Promotion and Behavior, College of Public Health,\nUniversity of Georgia, 251C Wright Hall, 100 Foster Rd, Athens, GA\nEmail: shou@uga.edu\nChanging Pedagogy: Faculty Adoption of\nService-Learning: Motivations, Barriers,\nand Strategies Among Service-Learning\nFaculty at a Public Research Institution\nSu-I Hou1 and Shannon Wilder1\n Keywords\nservice-learning, faculty, research institution, barrier, strategy\n2 SAGE Open\nreinforces faculty perceptions of which activities colleagues\nvalue and which activities are discouraged. As such, there\nseems to be a gap between institutional policies that explic-\nitly provide support for engagement activities such as SL and\nhow such policies are actually applied in different disciplines\nand departmental cultures. A \"top-down\" approach to recog-\nnizing SL as valuable scholarly work is not sufficient for\ninstitutionalizing SL. Perceptions of \"what counts\" toward\nadvancement and promotion have great implications for SL's\nadoption among faculty at different career stages (Jaegar\n&Thornton, 2009). Research has shown that early career fac-\nulty are particularly motivated by extrinsic factors such as\npromotion and tenure for involvement in SL and other activi-\nties outside of traditionally valued scholarly work (O'Meara,\n2003). At research institutions, this gap between institutional\npolicies supporting engagement work and faculty percep-\ntions of localized acceptance from colleagues engaged in\npeer review and evaluation of one another's work is also\ncompounded because research institutions privilege schol-\narly work over teaching and service activities.\nTo further understand the influence faculty has on the\ninstitutionalization of SL, Driscoll (2000) proposed some\nbroad areas for ongoing research including motivation, sup-\nport required, impact of SL on faculty, reported satisfaction,\nand obstacles and challenge. While a few recent studies have\nlooked at faculty motivation, satisfaction, and barriers to\nadoption of SL (Abes, Jackson, & Jones, 2002; Bulot &\nPribbenow, 2005), the faculty role in SL's advancement is\nstill in great need of research. Furco (2001) writes that for SL\nto be fully institutionalized at research universities \"faculty\nmust be made aware of how it is tied directly not only to their\nteaching and service activities, but also to their research.\"\nIntegrating SL into the three spheres of traditional faculty\nwork at research institutions--teaching, research, and ser-\nvice (institutional and public service)--requires understand-\ning the culture and context of a particular institution.\nThe purpose of this study is to examine faculty motiva-\ntions, barriers, and strategies toward SL adoption at a major\npublic research university in the Southeast. The mission of\nthe current study institution includes engagement (service)\nand its promotion and tenure policy specifically mentions SL\nas a scholarly activity that can be included in promotion dos-\nsiers. The current research aims to examine how faculty\nmembers view SL in a university that has set a policy to for-\nmally recognize it and the possible gaps between policy and\npractice. It serves as an example of how to conduct an inter-\nnal study of faculty member perceptions of motivating and\ninhibiting factors, in the context of a large research univer-\nsity. A recent article compared faculty SL perceptions among\nSL faculty versus non-SL faculty and found that the per-\nceived institutional barriers are high regardless of faculty's\nprevious SL involvement (Hou, 2010) and explored ways to\nencourage culture change at an institution that has already\ntaken steps to enact policies for faculty rewards, recognition,\nand support for SL. Therefore, a closer investigation of moti-\nvations and suggested strategies among faculty who have\nbeen engaged in SL could provide some insights on the ten-\nsions between faculty motivations, values, and norms at\nresearch university environment, and practice of engage-\nment. Results have implication on adding new understanding\nof community engagement in higher education among SL\nengaged faculty for identifying supportive strategies to better\nencourage SL adoption, while addressing faculty perceptions\nof institutional barriers.\nMethod\nStudy Participants and Data Collection\nA representative sample of 1,200 faculty members from a\nmajor research university in the Southeastern United States\nwas identified. This research institution has an established\nOffice of Service-Learning (OSL) to promote and support\nthe development of quality academic SL experiences through\na range of faculty development programs and funding oppor-\ntunities. Faculty members who have instructional responsi-\nbility or who had taught a course in the previous academic\nyear were eligible to participate in this institutional-wide\nsurvey.\nAn administrative memo was sent out to deans, directors,\nand chairs informing them of the upcoming survey, followed\nby an invitation email sent directly to faculty members.\nParticipants had a 3.5-week window to respond to the online\nsurvey. The first email reminder was sent out a week after the\ninvitation email, and the 2nd email reminder was sent out a\nweek before the survey was due. A total of 449 faculty mem-\nbers participated in the online survey. This study was con-\nducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board\nfor the Protection of Human Subjects at the researcher's\ninstitution.\nMeasurement\nAn online Faculty SL Benchmark Study Survey was devel-\noped. Online surveys have been utilized commonly as one of\nthe effective ways to gather campus-wide information by the\nstudy institution. This survey was developed by reviewing\nexisting literature, seeking feedback and input from key\nstakeholder groups including the institution's Office of SL, a\ncampus-wide SL Curriculum Committee, and an SL Interest\nGroup (SLIG), which was a campus-wide network consist-\ning of faculty, staff, and community partners. Both quantita-\ntive and qualitative data were gathered. Survey questions\nwere generally stated in a way that all faculty members,\nregardless of their prior experience with SL, would be able to\nrespond. However, to gain better understanding of reasons\nand motivations driving SL faculty to continue to engage in\nSL, and to explore continued barriers faced and recom-\nmended strategies, the current analysis zoomed in on SL\nHou and Wilder 3\nfaculty and their qualitative responses. This study focused on\nidentifying and examining themes from the following three\nopen-ended questions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What do you think motivates faculty involvement in\nSL? Or what factors encourage and hinder faculty to\nbe engaged scholars?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are some barriers you anticipate experiencing\nwhen (or if) you become more involved in SL?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are some strategies you would recommend to\naddress some of the barriers or challenges related to\nfaculty involvement in SL?\nData Analysis\nThe inductive, descriptive analyses were conducted using\nan iterative, analytical approach. Survey responses from\nthe above three structured open-ended questions were\ncompiled and analyzed individually by two trained\nresearchers, generating semantic codes pertaining to the\nissue (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Once codes were agreed on\nat the individual level, the compiled responses were cross-\nanalyzed to identify categories and patterns. The analyses\nwere carried out through several readings and interpreta-\ntion of the raw data. Researchers identified codes via open-\ncoding, and major thematic areas that inductively\ncharacterized faculty motivation, barriers, and strategies\nwere derived.\nResults\nA total of 449 faculty participated in the study; about 60%\nwere males and 80% were tenure(d)-track faculty. The pro-\nportions of faculty from each college/school participating in\nthe survey are representative to the overall institutional sam-\nple. Among these participants, 22.7% had prior SL experi-\nence (n = 102) and were included in the current analyses.\nData showed that the SL faculty group were more likely to be\nfemales, more likely to be at associate professor rank, less\nlikely to come from the arts and sciences college, and more\nlikely to be faculty from education- or social-science-related\ncolleges (Table 1).\nOverall, our data showed that the SL faculty was mostly\ninternally motivated or connected to personal commitments,\nas well as rewards from student appreciation of active learn-\ning strategies and opportunities. Barriers included lack of\ntime, recognition or rewards, and logistical support.\nParticipants suggested providing release time, recognition\nin the promotion and tenure process, training/mentoring,\nand funding opportunities. Key themes identified below\nwere discussed by the order of their importance in each of\nthe three category areas (motivations, barriers, and strate-\ngies), with more frequently mentioned themes discussed\nfirst. Selected quotes were also provided to illustrate key\nthemes identified.\nFaculty Motivations-Key Themes\nPassion and personal interests. A majority of the SL faculty in\nthe study expressed an intrinsic passion for better student\nlearning outcomes as the most important motivational factor.\nThis was an important finding as intrinsic motivation is usu-\nally stronger, which could last longer compared with exter-\nnal incentives. \"Personal interest, desire to provide students\nwith realistic work experience, and adding new challenges to\nteaching\" were some of the reasons mentioned. These fac-\nulty members reported that they \"embraced SL as a preferred\npedagogical strategy due to a desire to communicate the pro-\nfessional and personal challenges involved in service,\" \"a\ngenuine interest in holistic student development,\" \"the\nopportunity to provide students with real world application,\"\nand \"value towards experiential learning.\" Data showed that\npersonal values guided their commitment to SL and was a\nstrong motivating factor evident throughout responses. One\nfaculty member provided this perspective,\nIn my case the motivation to establish a service-learning course\nhas been to give undergraduate students career exploration\nopportunities and to give graduate students applied experience\nneeded to advance their training and careers.\nTable 1. Demographic and Background Information of Study\nParticipants.\nService-learning\nfaculty participants\nAll faculty\nparticipants\n N Percent N Percent\nGender\nAge\nTenure status\nRank\nCollege\n4 SAGE Open\nOf particular interest, however, was that very few faculty\nreported external, tangible rewards as primary reasons.\nIntrinsic motivation was the most important driving force. In\nfact, several noted, \"I got involved despite colleagues'advice\nagainst it.\"\nSocial commitment.Social commitment was the second\nsalient motivating factor. Social commitment reflects per-\nsonal values and is a more intrinsic force. Many faculty\nmembers indicated a true desire to connect with the commu-\nnity through their discipline. \"Passion for community\nengagement,\" \"desire to give back and contribute to com-\nmunity improvement,\" and a \"commitment to supporting the\nland-grant university mission\" were all important reasons of\nsocial commitment. To summarize, internal motivations or\ncommitment, pure passion for it, and a desire to be connected\nwith community were found to be salient among most SL\nfaculty members.\nRewards. The intangible rewards of seeing students gaining\nself-confidence and engage in active learning were the third\nmost frequently mentioned motivational factors. The intan-\ngible rewards received from seeing positive student learning\noutcomes can bring faculty longer-lasting joy and satisfac-\ntion. \"Student enthusiasm and appreciation\" can be powerful\nmotivators for continuing an SL course, noted by one faculty\nrespondent. \"The learning outcome observed in students,\"\n\"the increased learning and discussion that took place in a\nservice-learning class,\" \"satisfaction in helping the commu-\nnity while providing an engaging learning environment,\"\n\"resolving real life problems,\" and \"community relationship\nbuilding\" were all important intangible rewards.\nFaculty Barriers-Key Themes\nLack of (external) reward or recognition. Although many fac-\nulty experienced satisfying intangible rewards from students,\nthe lack of external reward or recognition discouraged many\nSL faculty members. Many SL faculty commented, \"such\nwork is not rewarded or recognized\" and \"service-learning is\nviewed as less academic.\" Several faculty even stated that\n\"tenured faculty are HOSTILE to the idea of service-learn-\ning,\" \"such activities are not counted or are counted less for\npromotion and tenure,\" or \"felt they were being penalized or\ndevalued for pursuing such activities.\" One participant\nstated, \". . . the only aspect of my work that is recognized in\nmy department is standard academic publishing. Anything\nelse--including community projects--is looked down\nupon.\"\nOthers stated,\nIt's something \"extra\" that is incredibly time intensive with little\nprofessionalpay-off.Currently,itfeelsthatcollegeadministrators\nare giving it a lot of lip service and saying how much they value\nit, but in the end it is just a pat on the back if you do it.\nI have a full research agenda and teaching load and I don't have\ntime to do extra activities that are not recognized by my\ndepartment . . . . I publish a great deal, but BECAUSE of my\ncommunity service I am perceived as less scholarly. I am\nactively DISCOURAGED from working in the community.\nSuch work needs to be rewarded but it is not.\nThe fact that non-SL faculty members discounted the\nefforts needed for developing such courses was very discour-\naging. Many SL faculty members voiced their frustrations\nthat colleagues should \"reward community service rather\nthan penalize me for it.\"\nOther faculty members commented,\nMost barriers I have experienced have come from traditional\ntenure track faculty members who have not participated in such\nactivities and have no appreciation for it. They want it to be\nprovided by non-tenure track faculty.\nThe investments in time and energy in SL activities can be\nsignificant and can be devoted to those activities that are\n\"valued\" by the department and colleagues.\nOur data clearly showed that although recognition of SL\nwork was not even among the top three most important moti-\nvators for adoption of SL pedagogy among SL faculty mem-\nbers, it was indeed one of the most significant barriers\nidentified for continuing the work with positive morale.\nTime, time, and more time. Lack of time was the second most\nsignificant barrier. The need for time and energy to establish\npartnerships and coordinate logistics and the lack of release\ntime from other responsibilities posed significant barriers.\nFaculty participants commented,\nTime, lack of logistical support from staff, liability issues, the\ngreater emphasis given to research over teaching in tenure\ndecisions. You will get tenure by being an outstanding researcher\nand an average teacher. You will not get tenure by being an\noutstanding teacher and an average researcher.\nWe, the already overworked faculty members, cannot do\neverything, and the time it takes to conduct a SL course or\nproject takes away much needed time for writing research\narticles and grant proposals. Research productivity leads to\ntenure and promotion and raises--not service-learning courses.\nOur data showed that lack of time was the reality, and\nanalyses suggested that this barrier was still closely linked\nwith the lack of recognition, particularly during the tenure\nand promotion process described above.\nLogistics and funding.These included identification of sites,\ntransportation, and scheduling issues, assessment procedures at\nplacement sites, coordination with community partners, and risk\nmanagement issues. In addition, funding for SL projects was\noften limited and hard to find. Faculty members commented,\nHou and Wilder 5\nFunds for this kind of work are limited, and even if we get funds\nfor this work (which are typically small pots of funding), this\nfunding does not help us research faculty in our demonstration\nof research excellence (in the way that real grants [NIH, EPA,\nNSF, etc.] and manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals do).\nFaculty Recommended Strategies--Key Themes\nReward/incentives.The most important strategy overwhelm-\ningly pointed to establishing more tangible rewards. This\nhighlighted again the barriers identified above needed to be\naddressed. These ranged from release time, reduced course\nloads, providing assistants to help with coordination and com-\nmunication, and limiting enrolment for SL courses. Also, par-\nticipants argued the pressure to produce more credit hours runs\ncontrary to best practices in quality SL courses and suggested\na need to develop institutional policies to limit enrolment.\nPromotion and tenure recognition.This is certainly among a\nsignificant concern among faculty especially in a research-\nfocused university. Faculty suggested recognition strategies\nsuch as to \"show faculty how they could use service-learning\nto enhance promotion and tenure so they don't feel like it is\ngoing to contribute negatively.\" Some commented on the\nneed to change policy so service--broadly defined--is rec-\nognized and counted toward tenure. Furthermore, demon-\nstrating that \"administrative faculty across the institution\nvalue tenure track faculty participation in service-learning\"\nwas viewed as critical to increase the morale of SL faculty.\nTraining/mentoring and funding. Suggestions included provid-\ning workshops and assistance for faculty to incorporate SL\ninto existing courses, and educate not only faculty but also\nadministrators on SL pedagogy:\nTraining--More mentoring and workshops to explain what SL\nis . . . benefits associated with SL . . . how to begin . . . how can\nsomeone incorporate SL in more classes; logistical work and\nwho to contact in the community; where to find support and the\nlike; experiences from a more supportive and engaged\ndepartment. More visibility and publicity about what's going on\nin those types of course.\nProviding more funding opportunities was also suggested,\nsuch as mini-grants to add SL into existing courses, faculty\ngrants for SL projects, and student SL grants or stipends to\ndo more in-depth projects. In addition, \"opportunities to\nshowcase student service-learning projects,\" \"venues to rec-\nognize faculty efforts,\" and \"a focus on scholarship that can\nemerge from service-learning courses\" were suggested.\nDiscussion\nOur data clearly showed that intrinsic motivation to improve\nstudent learning and development was the most important\ndriving force for faculty adopting SL pedagogy despite\ndiscouragement from colleagues or their departments. This\nfinding was consistent with existing studies (Abes et al.,\nVogelgesang, Denson, & Jayakumar, 2010). Although ser-\nvice and outreach is part of the core mission in a public\nresearch university, when it comes to promotion and tenure,\nthe three areas are usually not weighted equally, with\nresearch activity clearly privileged (Furco, 2001). Our cur-\nrent data strongly suggest that perceived external barriers\nwere high even among faculty members who have over-\ncome obstacles and already actively engaged in SL in the\nstudy research institution. These institutional culture and\nvalues toward SL need to be addressed to increase morale\nand encourage further faculty adoption of this pedagogy.\nInstitutions should also explore ways to provide tangible\nrewards and recognition as important strategies to increase\nfaculty morale and promote policy implementation to sup-\nport community engagement.\nAlthough it is no surprise that SL is not a top priority\nwithin research institutions for promotion, our data pro-\nvide important insights from the perspectives of SL faculty\nat a large research institution regarding the tensions\nbetween intrinsic motivations and the extent to which\ninstitutional or cultural norm barriers affecting faculty\nwere willing and able to engage in the SL project. The cur-\nrent study shows that the issues of lack of recognition or\nrewards were overwhelmingly prominent. Although recog-\nnition of SL work was not among top motivators for fac-\nulty SL engagement, it was indeed one of the most\nsignificant barriers identified for continuing the work. The\ntensions between the intrinsic motivations toward experi-\nential learning from faculty members and the non-conduc-\ntive reward system exist in research university environment\nwere high. Despite its explicit service and outreach mis-\nsion, the recent establishment of the OSL, and the promo-\ntion and tenure policy support for SL; faculty in the current\nstudy perceived significant gaps between institutional pol-\nicy and the actual practice norms at their most immediate\nunit (department) levels. This widespread perception that\nSL involvement damages advancement opportunities must\nbe taken into account when providing extrinsic support for\nfaculty adopting SL. The fact that the SL faculty at the\nstudy institution was more likely to be at the associate pro-\nfessor rank indicates their proven success and survival in\nthe tenure and promotion process or their adoption of SL\nafter successful achieving tenure. A significant number of\nthe SL faculty actually indicated having adopted this\napproach for years and in more than one course (80+%).\nThese were likely outstanding faculty with scholarly activ-\nities meeting the more \"traditional\" promotion criteria\nwhile at the same time adopting SL approach, with or with-\nout the support of institutional policy.\nThe significant gaps between institutional policy and\nunit practice on SL may be compounded with the empha-\nsis on traditional research in promotion and\n6 SAGE Open\ntenure criteria, which commonly exist in research-focused\ninstitutions. Hlengwa (2010) provides some theoretical\nperspective on why certain disciplines might be more\nlikely than others to adopt SL pedagogy and provides\nsome insights on the possibilities and constraints of infus-\ning SL into the curriculum. Research universities in par-\nticular are encouraged to consider ways to support forms\nof engaged scholarship such as SL and community-based\nparticipatory research not only in their promotion and ten-\nure guidelines but also through faculty development pro-\ngrams focused on engaged scholarship. In addition to\ninstitutional administrative support, strategies also need\nto be strengthened and targeted at the unit levels to value\nthe important role tenure track faculty play in SL involve-\nment. Special efforts are also needed to gain buy-in and\nsupport among the unit administrative leaders. Identifying\nways to re-frame SL as a form of valued scholarship and\napproach that could facilitate deeper integration of all the\nthree faculty responsibilities warrants attentions. There is\ncontinued need to examine further the enabling and con-\nstraining factors, both from structure (discipline) level\nand faculty perspective.\nThe study is limited in its shorter quotes due to the nature\nof online surveys. Additional insights might be emerged\nfrom more in-depth interviews, particularly with those who\nchose to engage in SL despite the potential risks to their ten-\nure and promotion process, and who eventually earned ten-\nure. Future research could further examine these areas to\nlearn perspectives from this special group of faculty\nmembers.\nIn summary, the study provides insightful comments\nfrom SL faculty in a large research institution and opportu-\nnity of a more representative sample to voice their concerns\nin depicting a better understanding on the issue. Results\nprovide understanding of SL within a research institution\ncontext, as well as insights to help universities better insti-\ntutionalize policy, provide support to address unit culture,\nand institute recognition systems to encourage faculty SL\nadoption.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbes, E.
