Khoury, MD, PhD\nPurpose: The recent discovery of the HFE gene and its association with hereditary hemochromatosis has renewed\nthe attention directed to iron-overload diseases. Population screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is under\ndebate, and population-based estimates of morbidity associated with hereditary hemochromatosis are needed.\nThe purpose of this study is to estimate the number of hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations in the United\nStates using a population-based dataset. Methods: National Hospital Discharge Survey and census data were\nused to estimate hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization rates for persons 18 years of age and over.\npersons in the United States. The rate among persons 60 years of age and over increased more than 60% during\nthis time period. Conclusion: The increase in the rate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations\namong older persons is consistent with recent trends in mortality data and may reflect the rising awareness of\nKey Words: hemochromatosis, hospitalizations, iron overload, population-based, National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey\nHereditary hemochromatosis is a disease of primary iron\noverload. Complications of hereditary hemochromatosis in-\nclude many common disorders e.g., cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiac\ndisease, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and arthritis. Once\nthought to be rare, hereditary hemochromatosis is now under-\nstood to be one of the most common genetic disorders among\nthe United States population. In 1996, a mutation identified in\nthe HFE gene was found to be associated with the majority of\nhereditary hemochromatosis cases.1 Approximately 4 to 5 per\n10,000 persons of European origin are homozygous for the\nnorthern European descent is a carrier. The estimated preva-\nlence of hereditary hemochromatosis based on screening stud-\nies that use serum iron measures ranges from 2 to 5 per 1,000\nThe identification of mutations in the HFE gene launched a\ndebate about population screening for hereditary hemochro-\nmatosis using genetic testing. Although hereditary hemochro-\nmatosis meets several of the World Health Organization's cri-\nteria for screening (e.g., it can be detected before the onset of\nsymptoms, and its complications can be prevented through the\nuse of therapeutic phlebotomy), the justifiability of population\nscreening for hereditary hemochromatosis is questionable be-\ncause its natural history is not well understood. The pheno-\ntypic expression of hereditary hemochromatosis varies and\nmost likely results from interactions between the genetic de-\nfect, age, sex, and environmental modifiers.4 In addition, he-\nreditary hemochromatosis is thought to be both underdiag-\nnosed and under-reported. Cost-effectiveness of potential\nscreening programs cannot accurately be assessed without ad-\nditional information on the disease burden of hereditary\nhemochromatosis at the population level. Databases and reg-\nistries can provide such information.5 For this study, we ana-\nlyzed data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey\nhemochromatosis-associated morbidity: the rate of hereditary\nhemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations in the United\nStates.\nMETHODS\nThe NHDS is a population-based sample survey used to es-\ntimate inpatient utilization of short-stay, nonfederal hospitals\nin the United States.6 The NHDS data files for 1979 through\n1997 contain demographic information for over 4 million\n(non-newborn) hospitalizations. The NHDS data files also in-\nclude up to seven International Classification of Diseases, 9th\nRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) diagnoses per\nrecord. Each record is weighted to allow for inflation to na-\ntional estimates. We selected all records that contained code\n275.0 (disorders of iron metabolism, including hemochroma-\ntosis). We excluded records of persons 18 years of age to\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAmanda S.

We also\nremoved records with ICD9-CM codes consistent with sec-\nondary iron overload diseases.7 These codes included: 273.8\n(hereditary atransferrinemia), 277.1 (porphyria cutanea\nliptocytosis), 282.3 (other hemolytic anemias due to enzyme\nhemoglobinopathies), 282.8 (other specified hemolytic ane-\n(congential dyserythropoietic anemia), 285.9 (unspecified\nanemias), and 964.0 (iron poisoning). The remaining records\nwere considered \"hereditary hemochromatosis-associated\nhospitalizations.\"\nThe U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each year\nare included with the NHDS documentation file. We com-\nputed annual hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospital\nutilization rates per 100,000 U.S. residents by using these pop-\nulation estimates as denominators. We calculated age-specific\nhereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization rates\nyears and over.\nThe NHDS utilizes a stratified, multistage probability de-\nsign. This complex sampling design requires special consider-\nation for presentation of estimates and imposes limitations\nwhen standard errors are calculated for multiple-year esti-\nmates. Guidelines for reporting estimates and calculating stan-\ndard errors are included in the NHDS data documentation.6\nBriefly, if the sample size is 60 or more and the relative standard\nerror is 30%, the estimate may be reported. The relative stan-\ndard error for multiple-year estimates can be determined only\nif the relative standard error for each single-year estimate\nwithin the year group is also computable. Thus, if a multiple-\nyear estimate contains individual annual sample sizes 60, the\nrelative standard error cannot be determined with certainty.\nRESULTS\n3.5 million records for persons 18 years of age or older; only\ndiagnoses. Of these, 171 also listed diagnostic codes for second-\nary iron overload diseases, of which thalassemias and anemias\nwere most frequent. After removing these records, 504 records\nremained for hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospi-\ntalizations. Application of the analytical weights yielded an es-\ntimated 79,580 hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospi-\ntalizations. Among these hospitalizations, code 275.0\naccounted for 22% of the primary diagnoses. The primary di-\nagnoses among the remaining 88% of records varied widely;\ndiagnoses for diseases of the liver and heart were the most\ncommon (Table 1). Diabetes was less common as a primary\ndiagnosis than as a codiagnosis. The mean age of patients with\nhereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations was\nThe hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-\nrange because of small sample sizes (see Methods section).\nThus, we collapsed the data into the following multiple-year\nWe analyzed the hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hos-\npitalization rates for each of these groups separately by age and\nsex. Persons 60 years of age and over had the highest rates of\nhereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization; from\nrate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-\nidents 60 years of age and older.\nWhen we stratified the sample by both age and sex, males 60\nyears of age and over were the only group with a sample size\nsufficient for reportable estimates.

Preva-\nlence surveys suggest that 2 to 5 per 1,000 people have heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis, yet we observed a hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis-associated hospitalization rate of approximately\nthese findings suggest that either people with hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis infrequently require hospitalization or that phy-\nsicians underdiagnose or under-report hemochromatosis, or\nboth. The most frequent codiagnoses among the estimated\n79,580 hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-\ntions were diseases of the heart, liver, and joints, and diabetes.\nAlthough these diseases are among the principal end-stage\ncomplications of hereditary hemochromatosis, each was diag-\nnosed during 10% of hospitalizations.\nUsing the NHDS to quantify hemochromatosis-associated\nmorbidity in the United States has additional limitations. First,\nhospitalizations are only one measure of morbidity and do not\nrepresent a complete assessment of the disease burden associ-\nated with hemochromatosis. Of the people who develop symp-\ntoms as a result of hereditary hemochromatosis, only a subset\nwill see a doctor and be hospitalized. Of those people who are\nhospitalized, only a subset will be diagnosed correctly with\nhereditary hemochromatosis as the underlying cause of their\nsymptoms, because the clinical conditions resulting from the\ndisease are not specific to iron overload.8 Second, because of\nlimited sample size, NHDS is best used to quantify diagnoses\nmore common than hemochromatosis. For example, the sam-\nple sizes for each year were outside the range of reliability for\nuse in calculating confidence intervals, so we could not test for\nsignificance the upward trend in the rate of hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis-associated hospitalizations.\nA previous study also used data from the NHDS to examine\ntrends in hemochromatosis-associated morbidity rates among\nU.S. residents.9 This study used published reports of NCHS\ndata and was, therefore, limited to years where diagnoses coded\ntions per year. However, these estimates were not accurate be-\ncause they did not exclude diagnoses associated with secondary\nforms of hemochromatosis.5 Unlike the earlier report, we used\nthe original data from NCHS to calculate hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis-associated hospitalization rates. We excluded\nconditions associated with secondary iron overload diseases,\nassociated hospitalizations for these same years.\nWe also extended the study period by analyzing the NHDS\nrate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-\ntions among people over 60 years of age increased 60%. This\nincrease parallels the 60% increase in the listing of hemochro-\nings may result from rising awareness in the United States of\niron-overload diseases, particularly hereditary hemochroma-\ntosis. Because of the increased attention given hereditary\nhemochromatosis since 1996, when the HFE gene was discov-\nered, a further increase in hereditary hemochromatosis-asso-\nciated hospitalization rates may be observed as the NHDS data\nfrom 1998 and subsequent years become available.\nReferences\n1.
