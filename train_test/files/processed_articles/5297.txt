As data describing the\neffects of EMPA on these more clinically available and,\ntherefore, more relevant indices of VAT are lacking, we\naimed to determine its effects compared with placebo on\nbody weight, waist circumference (WC) and indices of\ntotal body fat and visceral adiposity over a short and\nintermediate treatment term among patients with T2DM\nenrolled in five clinical trials.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nData from two cohorts of patients participating in rand-\nomized trials, one treated with double-blind EMPA versus\nplacebo for 12weeks (cohort 1) and one treated with dou-\nble-blind EMPA versus placebo for 24\nweeks (cohort 2),\nwere analysed. Cohort 1 comprised participants in the\nEMPA-REG BPTM trial; details of the trial population and\ndesign have been published previously.7 Briefly, patients\nwith T2DM [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7%\nand 10%], hypertension (defined as mean seated office\nmmHg and diastolic\nblood pressure 80\u00ad99mmHg) and body mass index (BMI)\nmg,\nEMPA 25mg or placebo once daily for 12weeks. Patients\nunderwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\n7dayspriortorandomizationandatweek12.Background\nantihypertensive therapy was continued throughout the\nstudy. Cohort 2 comprised participants in four trials:\nREG METSUTM10 and EMPA-REG METTM;11 details of\nthe trial populations and designs are published elsewhere.\nBriefly, all participants in these trials generally had\nrandomized to receive EMPA 10mg, EMPA 25mg or pla-\ncebo as monotherapy (EMPA-REG MONOTM) or add-on\nto background therapies metformin, metformin plus sul-\nphonylurea or pioglitazone with or without metformin\nEMPA-REG PIOTM) for 24weeks. All participants in these\nstudies provided written informed consent, and all studies\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Boards and\nIndependentEthicsCommitteesandCompetentAuthorities\nof the participating centres in compliance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the\nInternational Conference on Harmonization Harmonized\nTripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.\nVariable definitions and biomarker\nmeasurements\nBlood pressure was measured three times (approximately\n2min apart) after 5min of rest in the seated position, using\nthe same arm, method and device throughout the trials.\nHbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were assessed from\nblood samples taken during visits at the trial sites before\nbreakfast and before daily dose of study medication and\nanalysed at a central laboratory using validated assays\n(VariantTM II Turbo ion-exchange high-performance liquid\nchromatography, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, for\nHbA1c measurements; Gluco-quant Roche/Hitachi\nModular glucose analyser, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,\nGermany, for plasma glucose measurements).\nBody composition endpoints\nApart from body weight (kg) and WC (cm) that were meas-\nured directly, the following previously published indices\nwere selected based on the evidence available to reflect\nabdominal fat depots,13 `ease-of-use' from a clinical\npractice point of view and availability of data comprising\nthe formulae in the EMPA phase III clinical trial database\nand were used to estimate body fat content and distribu-\ntion: estimated total body fat (eTBF, YMCA formula):\n\u00d7weight\n(lbs))]/weight for men and 100\nobesity (ICO): WC/body height, constructed to account for\nrace- and sex-specific cut-offs for WC reflecting variability\nin average heights in these populations;16 and visceral adi-\n[triglycerides (TGs, mmol/L)/1.03]\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, mmol/L)] for men;\nC) for women, derived to incorporate the atherogenic dys-\nlipidemia seen with excess visceral adiposity in addition to\nanthropometric indices.17 These indices have been shown\nto closely correlate with cardiometabolic risk factors in\nmultiple investigations18,19 and in some cases proved supe-\nrior to existing indices of central obesity to predict meta-\nbolic syndrome.20 Furthermore, in a post hoc analysis of a\nsubset of the 1549 patients with T2DM randomized to\ntreatment with EMPA versus glimepiride in the EMPA-\nREG H2H SUTM trial, we found strong correlations between\neTBF (YMCA formula) and total body fat by dual x-ray\nabsorptiometry and between WC and ICO and abdominal\nVAT by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), validating the\nuse of these indices in relation to direct measures of VAT\nand total body fat in a similar population of middle-aged,\noverweight and obese patients with T2DM.13 Moreover, the\nindividual parameters used to derive these markers are\nreadily available in the clinical setting and can be applied\nacross a broad spectrum of populations. All endpoints were\nassessed at baseline and at week 12 (cohort 1) or week 24\n(cohort 2).\nStatistical analyses\nBaseline characteristics of each cohort and treatment\nassignment are presented as mean (standard deviation) or\nproportion where appropriate. Changes in weight, WC and\nadiposity indices were assessed between baseline and week\nfrom patients in the EMPA 10mg and EMPA 25mg groups\nwere pooled. These changes from baseline were analysed\nusing an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline\nHbA1c and the baseline value of the adiposity measure as\nlinear covariables, and baseline estimated glomerular filtra-\ntion rate [eGFR by modification of diet in renal disease\n(MDRD)], region and treatment as fixed effects. The num-\nber of antihypertensive medications at baseline was an\nadditional fixed effect in the analysis of cohort 1, and the\nindividual study was an additional fixed effect in the analy-\nsis of cohort 2. Analyses were conducted on the full-analy-\nsis set; for cohort 1, this was defined as randomized patients\nwho received at least one dose of study drug and had base-\nline HbA1c and mean 24-h systolic blood pressure values.\nFor cohort 2, this was defined as randomized patients who\nreceived at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline\nHbA1c value. Values observed after initiation of additional\nanti-hyperglycaemic rescue therapy were set to missing. A\nlast observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was\nused to impute missing data.

Reductions in adiposity markers with\nEMPA were generally seen across all subgroups of age,\nsex and degree of abdominal obesity, with statistically sig-\nnificant heterogeneity of effects observed such that the\neffects of EMPA on reductions in body weight, WC and\nICO were greater with increasing age; and reductions in\nbody weight were greater with more severe abdominal\nobesity in those patients treated for 24\nweeks. There was\nno heterogeneity of the effects of EMPA on body weight,\nWC or indices of visceral adiposity by sex. These results\nsuggest that treatment with EMPA may reduce VAT and\nlead to changes in body composition associated with\nimproved cardiometabolic risk profiles. Given that VAT is\nstrongly associated with increased risk of T2DM, athero-\nsclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and cardiac\nfunction, if any degree of that association is causal, our\nfindings could have potentially important clinical implica-\ntions for the prevention and treatment of visceral adipos-\nity-related cardiometabolic complications and warrant\nfurther investigation. Furthermore, in the context of previ-\nous studies directly measuring changes in VAT, these\nresults suggest that WC and the indices of ICO and VAI\nmight be useful for research and for clinical purposes as a\nsurrogate for VAT. Further studies directly comparing\nthese indices of adiposity with gold standard imaging\nassessments of VAT and other adipose depots are currently\nDedicated imaging sub-studies in clinical trials of\nSGLT-2 have demonstrated improvements in total fat mass\nand size of abdominal fat depots. In a 2-year study of EMPA\nversus glimepiride, total fat mass (by dual x-ray absorptiom-\netry) and visceral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tis-\nsue (SAT) volumes (by MRI) were significantly decreased\namong those treated with EMPA versus glimepiride.12\nSimilar findings were seen in trials of canagliflozin versus\nglimepiride21 and dapagliflozin versus placebo.22 The find-\nings of these three dedicated imaging sub-studies align well\nwith other results of weight reducing interventions3 and\nhave been recently summarized.23 Our results here extend\nthese observations to more clinically applicable indices of\nvisceral adiposity that can be simply applied in the clinical\nsetting and followed through treatment.\nIn contrast to prior dedicated body composition studies\nthat measured total body fat directly with imaging, we did\nnot observe a statistically significant reduction in eTBF\nwith EMPA treatment using the referenced formula. This\ndiscrepancy could be due to the fact that the eTBF formula\nused in this study may be too imprecise to accurately quan-\ntify smaller relative changes in total body fat or may not be\naccurately calibrated for the trial population. However, in\nlight of the presence of a trend towards a reduction in total\nbody fat using the estimating equation in addition to prior\nevidence of a positive effect of EMPA and other drugs in\nthis class on reducing body fat, the reduction of visceral\nand abdominal subcutaneous fat could have potential\nimportant clinical implications for cardiovascular and met-\nabolic risk reduction.\nTable 1.

Several limitations\nalso merit comment. First, although VAT is strongly associ-\nated with cardiometabolic disease and adverse outcomes,\nthis study cannot demonstrate whether reduction in VAT\nwith EMPA contributes to altered glycometabolic, ASCVD\nor heart failure risk. Second, with the large majority of\nstudy participants being Caucasian, our findings may not\nbe generalizable to African-American patients who are\nmore likely to have a lower visceral fat burden compared\nwith other races even at higher BMIs or other racial minori-\nties not represented or underrepresented in the present\nseries of trials. Third, other anthropomorphic and imaging\nmarkers of VAT were not assessed in this study, so we are\nunable to comment on their relation with EMPA treatment.\nFourth, although the use of an LOCF approach to impute\nmissing data may lead to bias in the estimation of treatment\neffects and greater type 1 error, when we examined the\nsimilarity between LOCF and a mixed-effect model\nrepeated measure approach in the individual trials, results\nwere generally consistent.\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EMPA\ncompared with placebo significantly reduced body\nweight, WC and indices of total and visceral adiposity in\ncomposition induced by EMPA will be associated with\nreduced ASCVD and heart failure risk remains to be\ndetermined. The recently reported EMPA-REG\nvascular safety of EMPA versus placebo in a high-cardi-\novascular risk patient population provides further insight\ninto this important clinical question and will help define\nthe role of EMPA in the prevention and treatment of obe-\nsity and T2DM.\n"
