Programs were implemented in randomly selected\nvoting precincts, which allowed for the gold standard in\nprogram evaluation methodology: a randomized controlled\nexperiment. The pilot program increased citizen activism,\nevidenced by a 12% rise in registered complaints and a\nmoderate increase in voter registration.\nWhile the intervention worked as intended, examina-\ntion of the information campaign's effects on electoral out-\ncomes revealed an unexpected result: precincts randomly\nselected for the \"complaints\" intervention had 5% lower\nvoter turnout than those that received no treatment. For\nevery person contacted, at least one person stayed home on\nelection day. In two separate replications of this result,\npre-election panel survey--even if they received no addi-\ntional contact with the NGO--had a voter turnout about\n3% lower than precincts where no data were gathered. In\nall three experiments, relatively innocuous interventions\ninduced voter abstention. Given that these interventions\nare representative of standard methodologies used in\ndemocracy promotion activities and social scientific\ninquiry more generally, an in-depth exploration of these\nunexpected findings may shed light on important and\nunder-reported political processes unfolding in the shadow\nof democracy promotion aid.\nAn individual's decision to turn out to vote on election\nday is typically modeled as a minimally costly action with\nfew direct benefits.1 Since rationalist approaches to turnout\ntypically depend on non-material inducements (i.e. \"expres-\nsive\" benefits) to explain aggregate electoral participation, it\nIntended and unintended consequences\nof democracy promotion assistance to\nGeorgia after the Rose Revolution\nJesse Driscoll1 and F Daniel Hidalgo2\n Keywords\nDemocracy promotion, semi-authoritarian regimes, experimental research\n1School of International Relations and Pacific Studies, University of\nCalifornia at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA\n2Department of Political Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA\nCorresponding author:\nEmail: dhidalgo@mit.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nis plausible that in the Georgian case a small increase in\nnegative emotions--fear or disgust--on the part of study\nrespondents might have tipped the scales against participa-\ntion among some voters on election day. In semi-authoritar-\nian contexts, some citizens believe that regimes can monitor\nindividual voting decisions and use the results to tailor retal-\niations.2 As a result, many post-Soviet elections resemble\n\"rituals of consent\" (\"voting in order to be seen voting by\nanyone who might be interested in keeping track of who is\nvoting\") rather than exercises in preference aggregation.3\nThese fears are not subject to easy falsification. They are\nakin to a conspiracy theory, which can vary in potency\nacross different electoral districts within the same state or\ncounty. We hypothesize that whether a Georgian voter\non individuals' self-assessment of two factors: (a) whether\nthe regime was capable of monitoring his or her vote choice,\nand (b) potential personal costs of retaliation for voting for\nthe opposition. Our suspicion is that our intervention trig-\ngered risk aversion behaviors: staying home on election day.\nAn alternative hypothesis to regime surveillance is dis-\nenchantment with politics in general, as suggested by the\nepigraph to this paper. Randomization of the content of a\n2010 pre-election survey found that refusal to voluntarily\nsupply information was more common the more \"political\"\nthe survey instrument was. This finding was especially\nacute in precincts rife with mistrust of regime intentions.\nPerhaps citizens feared that the data being collected would\nbe somehow used against them. Or perhaps respondents see\npolitics as intrinsically \"dirty,\" and viewed the activities of\nthe foreign-assisted youth who arrived from the capital\nwith some mix of pity and disgust. Regardless of the pre-\ncise mechanism, these findings draw attention to a possible\nsource of bias in much of the survey data collected in semi-\nauthoritarian regimes on politically sensitive subjects.\nLocal context: The Georgian case\nGeorgia is a post-Soviet state that enjoys an unusually\nstrong strategic relationship with the United States. It\nreceives more Western aid per capita than the rest of the\nstates in the region combined.4 In 2003, peaceful protests\nswept Eduard Shevardnadze and his regime from power\nwhen exit polls did not match official vote tallies.5 In the\nwake of the \"Rose Revolution,\" the next president, Mikheil\nSaakashvili, allowed the Soros Foundation, NDI, IRI,\nTransparency International, and various other democracy\npromotion organizations freedom of action.\nAt the time of the study Saakashvili's party, the United\nNational Movement (UNM), dominated the political land-\nscape by using formal institutions--notably the judiciary,\nthe Ministry of Interior, and Parliament--to discourage\nelectoral alternatives.6 As president, Saakashvili enjoyed\nfavorable media coverage and free time on state television\nnetworks. In a pre-election survey conducted in the lead-up\nthat people had to \"vote a certain way to keep their jobs.\"An\nadditional 34% of voters admitted that this happens \"some-\ntimes.\"7 For all the disappointments of the post-Rose\nRevolution era, however, Saakashvili's decision to concede\nelectoral defeat to Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream\nparty in 2012 represents the clearest example of a party in\npost-Soviet Eurasia losing an election and voluntarily step-\nping down from power.8\nTwo facets of the 2008 Parliamentary election deserve\nspecial note. First, the election was conducted in an atmos-\nphere of paranoia and conspiracy. Many voters believed\nthe integrity of the secret ballot was compromised. It was\ntaken for granted by Georgian media outlets that authori-\nties could figure out how constituents voted, and tailor\nrewards or punishments accordingly.9 This is borne out in\nsurvey data. According to a nationally representative\nhousehold survey conducted in the Spring of 2009, only\n50.1% of voters believed that their vote was secret in last\nGeorgian election--a far lower figure than was reported\nfor the same question in either Armenia (72.8%) or\nAzerbaijan (62.8%).10 Second, little distinguished the vari-\nous opposition parties in terms of ideology or policy pro-\nposals. Voters generally went to the polls to either affirm or\nreject the status quo--to either vote vote for or against\nSaakashvili's UNM party.\nProgram evaluation: Expected and\nunexpected findings\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2008 parliamentary elections,\nthe authors worked with an international democracy promo-\ntion NGO to randomize the precincts that would receive a\nvoter information program. The goal of this pilot program\nwas to educate Georgian citizens about common technolo-\ngies of electoral fraud and--it was hoped--to deter voter\nfraud by disseminating accurate information about how to\nfile an anonymous complaint. With the aid of the imple-\nmenting organization, we tailored the content of the mes-\nsage to address types of fraud regularly reported to be\nassociated with Georgia's electoral environment. The pro-\ngram was implemented by the Caucasus Research Resource\nCenters (CRRC). The total program budget was just under\n$10,000. Eligible precincts were those previously selected\nas primary sampling units in a national panel survey on the\n2008 parliamentary elections. Canvassers delivered the\nmessage several weeks after the first wave of the survey. To\nincrease efficiency, precincts were grouped in blocks of\nfour, based on region, urban or rural, 2006 governing party's\nvote share, and percentage of ballots cast between 5:00 p.m.\nand 8:00 p.m. in the previous election, which election\nobservers use as a rough proxy of voter fraud (since ballot\nstuffing tended to occur at the end of the day). Within these\nblocks of four, two precincts were randomly selected to\nreceive the intervention.\nDriscoll and Hidalgo 3\nDescription of intervention\nThe pilot program studied an intervention designed to\nencourage voters to report any observed problems on elec-\ntion day to either local electoral officials or to well-known\nNGO partners (with experience in election monitoring).11\nThe messages were delivered through a combination of\npamphleting and canvassing. In every treatment precinct,\napproximately 30 households were visited by canvassers\nand given a face-to-face oral message and a flier. Canvassers\nalso distributed fliers to roughly 80 additional households\nin the precinct (2\u00ad3 neighbors per home selected). Given\nthat average precinct size in the experimental samples is\n1151 voters and assuming an average of 2 voting age adults\nin each household,12 we would have directly exposed about\n20% of households to the message. The canvassers were\ncollege students recruited from Tbilisi universities. Most\nenumerators had substantial survey administration experi-\nence and training through the CRRC. The text of the mes-\nsages are in the appendix.\nExpected results: Enhanced civic activism\nagainst electoral malfeasance\nThe intent of the \"Complaints\" intervention was to encour-\nage voters to monitor local elections themselves, filing a\ngrievance if election regulations were violated. To check if\nour intervention had this effect, we compiled data on com-\nplaints of electoral malfeasance reported by prominent\nelection monitoring organizations. We use two dependent\nvariables: (a) a dummy variable for at least one complaint\nfiled by a voter in that precinct and (b) the raw number of\ncomplaints filed. Results are presented in Table 1. We find\nstrong evidence that our intervention increased the propen-\nsity of voters to challenge voting procedures on election\nday. The mean difference across treatment and control for\nthe complaints dummy implies a 12% increase in the prob-\nability of a complaint being filed in treated districts. For the\nmodels using the raw number of complaints, the point esti-\nmate is 0.26--which is roughly twice the mean number of\ncomplaints filed in all precincts in the sample.\nUnexpected downstream results: Turnout\nsuppression\nSubsequent investigation of the data revealed another find-\ning: a substantial number of Georgians did not cast their\nvotes on election day in districts selected for the\n\"Complaints\" treatment, as seen in Table 2. The average\neffect of the complaints treatment (unadjusted specifica-\ntion) on voter turnout is about \u00ad5.4%. We find a positive,\nTable 1.

This section presents two partial\nreplications of the result, wherein two pre-election surveys\nare treated as randomized interventions. Subcontracted\nGeorgian canvassers capital city visited randomly selected\nprecincts, asking standard questions about political beliefs\na few weeks before two separate elections. The 2008 and\n2010 CRRC surveys had a multi-stage sampling structure,\nwith precincts as the primary sampling units. In 2008, prior\nto the parliamentary elections, 85 precincts were selected\nout of a total of 3019 precincts using sampling probabilities\n(i ) proportional to the number of registered voters. Using\na virtually identical sampling procedure in the weeks prior\nprimary sampling units for a similar political survey. The\nunit of analysis for this \"experiment\" is the precinct and the\ntreatment is selection into the sample. To recover the aver-\nage treatment effect of being included in the survey sample\non turnout and regime vote share, we fit a weighted linear\nmodel of each dependent variable on a treatment indicator\nvariable and the selection variable, the number of regis-\ntered voters. The weights are inverse probability weights,\nwhere the weight for each treatment unit is equal to\n\nand\nthe weight for each control unit is\n. Because the selec-\ntion weights are known, incorporating these weights in our\nestimation procedure allow us to recover unbiased treat-\nment effect estimates.14 Balance statistics for this design\nare presented in the Appendix.\nThe results are reported in Table 3. In both the 2008 par-\nliamentary election and the 2010 local elections, being ran-\ndomly selected for a pre-election survey had a statistically\nsignificant voter suppression effect. The suppression effect\nout of approximately 3% compared to a lower turnout of\napproximately 2.5%). The results are consistent with the\neffects of the complaints intervention reported in Table 2.\nPotential mechanisms\nWhy did the three interventions lower turnout? The inter-\nventions could have lowered turnout either by changing the\nbehavior of Georgian voters or the functioning of the elec-\ntions themselves. In the latter scenario, exposure to the\ninformation or survey intervention could have deterred\nwould-be ballot stuffers, thus reducing the number of man-\nufactured voters and consequently reducing measured turn-\nout. Ballot-stuffing and tabulation manipulation are\nhowever, European election monitors observed only one\ninstance of ballot stuffing and the ballot counting proce-\ndures were generally assessed \"positively\" (OSCE, 2008:\n7). Under this scenario, political operatives--typically\nallied with the ruling regime--would interpret the interven-\ntions as increasing the probability of being caught and pun-\nished for breaking the law, thus deterring electoral\nmanipulation. According to this hypothesis, one would\nexpect the vote share for the president's party to decrease in\ntreatment precincts, as ballot stuffers would no longer gen-\nerate the same number of votes for the ruling party. The\nevidence for this implication of the fraud dampening mech-\nanism is equivocal. The point estimates of the effect of the\ncomplaints intervention (Table 2) on the vote share of the\npresidential party is positive (albeit not statistically signifi-\ncant), while the effects of the survey (Table 3) are indeed\nnegative (again not significant). Furthermore, it is not clear\nwhy a precinct being selected as a primary sampling unit\nfor a survey would reduce ballot stuffing, since enumera-\ntors were deployed several weeks before the election and\ndid not present themselves as election observers. Given the\nweak theoretical rationale for attributing reduced ballot\nstuffing to the \"survey as an experiment\" intervention and\nthe null results on regime party vote share, the case for this\nmechanism is tenuous.\nTable 3. \"Survey as an Experiment.\"\nTurnout % Pres. Party vote %\nThis table shows the estimated effects of a precinct being included in two different political surveys. The first survey was conducted immediately\nbefore the 2008 parliamentary election. The second survey was carried out before the 2010 local elections. Treatment effect estimates account for\nunequal probability of selection and control for precinct size, the variable used to sample precincts into the \"treatment\".\nDriscoll and Hidalgo 5\nOur favored explanation for the findings is that the inter-\nventions lowered the propensity of some Georgian citizens\nto vote. Being surveyed has been shown to affect consumer\nbehavior (Zwane et al., 2011) in a variety of contexts and\nseveral cognitive mechanisms such as self-prediction and\nrelated priming effects have been proposed as explanations\n(Rogers et al., 2013). The particular characteristics of the\nGeorgian political environment, however, suggest an alter-\nnative mechanism for our findings on voter behavior:\nincreased suspicion of regime surveillance, induced by the\nunexpected arrival of survey enumerators, reduced political\nparticipation. This mechanism is plausible given the wide-\nspread disbelief in the secrecy of the ballot and the common\nview that the government punishes political opponents.\nCitizens in post-Soviet Georgia--many of whom came of\nage in a totalitarian state--may misconstrue enumerators\nfrom the capital asking about politically sensitive issues as\nagents of the state seeking to gather information about their\npolitical sympathies. These types of fears are frequently\nexpressed by Georgian opposition leaders. For example, in\n2009, a Georgian opposition legislator claimed that\ntelephone calls have been made ... to people from a number\nwhich is registered to a division of the Ministry of Internal\nAffairs ... An unidentified individual was conducting a survey\nfrom this number, asking whether or not they were planning to\nattend the 9 April rally, whether they stood in solidarity with\n[participants of] the rally and whether they would change their\nmind if the opposition used weapons [at the rally].\n(BBC, n.d.)\nIf visits by enumerators prime these sorts of fears, it is\nplausible that even a small increase in the perceived risk to\nthe voter or her family could tip the scales against participa-\ntion on election day.\nSome evidence for this mechanism can be observed by\nexamining how treatment effects in the original \"com-\nplaints\" experiment vary by perceptions of the prevalence\nof electoral coercion, as well as the geographic location of\nthe precinct. We examined three main interactions: urban\nprecincts versus rural precincts, prevalence of employer\npressure to vote, and the degree to which employers pres-\nsured employees to campaign.16 If the intervention was\nindeed being interpreted as political monitoring, then we\nwould expect that the effect would be largest in rural areas\nwhere machine politics is more entrenched. The qualitative\nliterature suggests that employment, particularly in the\npublic sector, is often used to mobilize supporters. To that\nend, we examined whether, as expected, the monitoring\neffect was largest in areas where survey respondents\nreported that employer political pressure was highest. We\nalso check whether effect estimates are larger in areas\nwhere employers are perceived to place undue pressure on\nworkers to participate in a campaign.17\nThe results can be found in Figure 1. The treatment\neffects all vary in the expected directions, though only one\ninteraction--perhaps not surprising giving the low sample\nsize--is statistically significant. The intervention had a\nlarger suppression effect in rural areas, as expected. But\nparticularly striking is the \"employer pressure to vote\"\ninteraction, which is statistically significant at the 5% level.\nEmployer pressure to campaign Employer pressure to vote Rural or urban\nAbove median Below median Above median Below median Rural Urban\nStrata\nTreatment effect on turnout (%)\nFigure 1. Heterogenous treatment effects: Heterogeneity in the effect of the complaints treatment on voter turnout by three\nvariables. ATE in each covariate strata is from a linear model with block fixed effects and adjusted for covariates. Standard errors\nare heteroskedasticity consistent.\n6 Research and Politics \nIn areas where relatively few survey respondents believed\nthat employer pressure to vote for particular parties was\nwidespread, the estimated effect on turnout is close to 0. In\nareas with a high number of people citing employer pres-\nsure as widespread, the effect estimate is \u00ad12.7%.\nCumulatively, these patterns in the data provide suggestive\nevidence that the intervention was interpreted by opposi-\ntion voters as a signal that there would be increased regime\nattention to their voting behavior on election day.\nPoliticized data collection and\nIn order to probe the mechanism further, we implemented a\nsurvey experiment in the 2010 pre-election survey. Our\nnew question: Is the behavioral response of Georgian citi-\nzens to a survey instrument different if the survey is clearly\nassociated with politics? Procedurally, we front loaded half\nof the surveys with the \"politics module\" (treatment) and\nplaced these directed political questions at the end of the\nsurvey for the other half of survey respondents (control).18\nEvery respondent was eventually asked political questions,\nso if the hypothesized mechanism is correct, the survey\nitself heightened concerns over regime surveillance in both\nthe treatment and control group. The advantage of the ran-\ndomization of module order is that one can observe if\nGeorgian respondents perform differently on surveys they\nknow to be collecting political behavior data compared to\nsurveys where this was suspected but not known.\nThe dependent variable in the analysis that follows is the\nnumber of questions that the respondent answered \"Don't\nKnow\" or refused to answer.19 The average treatment effect\nfor the full sample can be seen in Table 4. Asking political\nquestions in the first part of the survey increased the num-\nber of \"Don't Know\" or \"Refuse To Answer\" responses by\nan average of 1.7, which does not reach standard levels of\nstatistical significance.\nGiven that a variety of mechanisms could explain how\npriming politics could induce higher rates of non-response,\nwe are particularly interested in heterogeneous treatment\neffects: is non-response attributable to treatment higher in\nprecincts with greater distrust of Georgian political insti-\ntutions and the ruling party? A complication is that it is\nnot possible to use individuals' responses to a question as\na covariate: all answers are \"post-treatment.\" Since the\nthrust of our argument is that respondents are reluctant\nabout providing data and answer questions strategically,\nexamining heterogeneity by individual response risks\nconflating treatment with baseline characteristics.\nEcological inference provides a partial solution to this\nproblem: creating covariates, at a precinct level, based on\naggregates of survey responses that could divide precincts\ntransparently.20 It becomes possible to make generaliza-\ntions about which communities are essentially UNM\nstrongholds and which communities do not believe that\nGeorgia is a democracy.21 Table 5 splits the sample by the\nmedian value of the community level covariates and\nthen displays the average treatment effect within each\nstratum.\nCitizens were less likely to give answers to questions\non the politics-loaded version of the survey (treatment) in\nprecincts where many citizens also report they are not liv-\ning in a democracy, they don't trust the electoral process,\nand they are mistrustful of the UNM.22 The specific ques-\ntions with the the largest difference in non-response rates\nacross the treatment and control conditions also support\nthe favored hypothesis.23 The five questions with the larg-\nest gap in response rates when the politics module was put\nat the front of the survey are as follows, in descending\norder:\nTable 4. The average effect of question order on non-response.

On a scale from 1 to 5 where \"1\" means \"Do Not\nTrust At All\" and \"5\" means \"Trust Completely,\"\nhow would you assess your trust towards domestic\nelection observers?\nIn line with our theoretical expectations, front loading the\nsurvey with political questions most powerfully affected non-\nresponse rates on questions related to monitoring of electoral\npractices, the credibility of the electoral process, and feelings\nabout opposition parties. The first and fourth largest gap in\nresponse rates were questions that asked respondents to rate\nparticular opposition parties (Alliance for Georgia was a coa-\nlition of opposition parties backing the main opposition can-\ndidate in the Tbilisi 2010 mayoral race; We Ourselves was a\nsingle-issue opposition party focusing on the Abkhazia dis-\npute). The three other questions with large gaps refer to the\ncredibility of the electoral process--with particular reluc-\ntance about monitoring, either via cameras and digital record-\ning devices or domestic election observers. We interpret this\npattern as additional circumstantial evidence that the more the\nsurvey veered into questions of politics, the less willing\nGeorgian citizens were to reveal their opinions.\nAll of this may, in part, explain why neither area experts\nnor Georgians themselves predicted that Saakashvili's UNM\nparty would be outmaneuvered in the 2012 election by\nBidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream. Mullen (2012)\nreports that 46% of people contacted for a NDI-funded pre-\nelection survey in the immediate lead-up to the 2012 elec-\ntion refused to tell CRRC survey enumerators who they\nwere planning to vote for. He speculates: \"[T]hat number\nwas based on fear; and fear had become an important part of\nlife under the UNM for many people. It was a fear that\nwould lead people to avoid taking risks that could have put\nthem on the wrong side of the authorities.\" But it is impor-\ntant to remember that is also plausible that respondents sim-\nply did not see themselves in solidarity with foreign-funded\ndemocracy professionals doing surveys. While fear is the\nmechanism that we find most intuitive--and a mechanism\nthat fits neatly into both the rationalist voting framework\nand anti-regime polemics--other psychological mecha-\nnisms are plausible. Simple disgust is difficult to falsify, and\nbroadly consistent with the heterogeneous treatment effects\nreported above. As Nodia's epigraph to this paper makes\nclear, politics in Georgia are widely viewed as dirty work.24\nThe tendency to perceive politicians as corrupt, and respond\nnegatively and emotionally to misused political power, is\nubiquitous in democracies around the globe. The desire by\nGeorgian respondents to avoid dirtying themselves with\npolitics by avoiding it as much as possible could explain the\nbehaviors reported in this study.\nConclusion\nIn recent years a number of studies have used natural and\nfield experiments to demonstrate that the presence of interna-\ntional actors--as election monitors, scientific observers, or\nactivists--can have a causal influence on local electoral out-\ncomes. Unfortunately, as this study emphasizes, it is likely\nthat well-meaning interventions are occasionally misinter-\npreted. And while we are certain that our intervention inter-\nacted in an unexpected way with prevalent beliefs in Georgian\nsociety, we emphasize that our study does not allow us to dis-\ntinguish precisely which inherited beliefs interacted with the\ninterventions to reduce turnout. Did the intervention acciden-\ntally prime fear of regime monitoring? Or did it accidentally\nactivate ambivalence, reminding respondents of some other\ndistasteful aspect of Georgian political life? Future research\nmay be able to discover the mechanism at work.\nThe Rose Revolution is an exemplary case of civil society\nactors nonviolently seizing control of the state apparatus. One\nof the unforeseen consequences was a blurring of the boundary\nof where the regime ends and civil society begins. Well-\nmeaning efforts by foreigners to strengthen civil society, in this\ncontext, were likely interpreted by many Georgians as strength-\nening the state. While this study provides limited grounds for\ngeneralization beyond the Georgian case, or even beyond the\nSaakashvili era, inherited beliefs from the Soviet legacy--a\nculture of bureaucratic compliance that is exploited by incum-\nbent parties, expectations that private behaviors can and will be\nmonitored and reported to authorities, and a sense that the polit-\nical sphere is \"dirty\"--are ubiquitous in the region.25 Residual\nfear of state surveillance is a common phenomenon in post-\nauthoritarian societies. This study should be seen as an invita-\ntion for further research on how authoritarian cultural legacies\ninteract with the standard social science toolkit.\nUnexpected results are not unusual in the nascent field\nexperimental literature on democracy promotion and elec-\ntion observation. Hyde (2010), for example, reports the\nresults of a randomized evaluation of election observers in\nIndonesia, where she found that precinct visits by interna-\ntional observers increased the vote share of the incumbent\nseveral possible explanations, but underscores that the spe-\ncific result is \"somewhat idiosyncratic\" and unanticipated.\nIn a voter mobilization experiment in Uganda, Ferree et al.\n(2011) unexpectedly found that increasing the salience of\n8 Research and Politics \nthe visibility of voting suppressed turnout, particularly\namong women. These results highlight one of the strengths\nof field experiments in that they enable researchers to\nuncover unanticipated effects of interventions. But these\nresults also point to our incomplete knowledge about how\ninterventions common in democracy promotion activities\ninteract with local political practices and cultural beliefs.\nThis study has policy implications. Investments in\nimproving the secrecy of the ballot--and then funding a\npublic information campaign to publicize this fact--would\nprobably indirectly empower opposition parties by reduc-\ning the perceived risks from regime surveillance. But pri-\nmarily these findings represent a sobering reminder that\nU.S. policy ambitions outstrip the current state of knowl-\nedge on how foreign assistance can alter the relationship\nbetween the state and civil society.Ahealthy dose of humil-\nity is justified. While aggregate analysis of democratization\naid have found positive effects on democracy indices\n(Finkel et al., 2008), our results suggest that the conse-\nquences of any particular program can be highly heteroge-\nneous and dependent on hard-to-measure local factors,\nparticularly in countries just emerging from long bouts of\nauthoritarian rule. There is much that we do not know about\nthe technologies used by electoral authoritarian regimes to\nconduct elections in an environment that keeps citizens\ninsecure, atomized, and dependent on the party in power.\nSupplementary Material\nThe replication file is available at: http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/\ndv/researchandpolitics\n"
