    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study was designed to investigate the impact of survival processing with a novel task for this paradigm: the Stroop color-\nnaming task. As the literature is mixed with regard to task generalizability, with survival processing promoting better\nmemory for words, but not better memory for faces or paired associates, these types of task investigations are important to\na growing field of research. Using the Stroop task provides a unique contribution, as identifying items by color is an\nimportant evolutionary adaptation and not specific to humans as is the case with word recall. Our results indicate that\nsurvival processing, with its accompanying survival-relevance rating task, remains the best mnemonic strategy for word\nmemory. However, our results also indicate that presenting the survival passage does not motivate better color-naming\nperformance than color-naming alone. In addition, survival processing led to a larger amount of Stroop interference, though\nnot significantly larger than the other conditions. Together, these findings suggest that considering one's survival when\nperforming memory and attention-based tasks does not enhance cognitive performance generally, although greater allocation\nof attentional resources to color-incongruent concrete objects could be considered adaptive. These findings support the\nnotion that engaging in deeper processing via survival-relevance ratings may preserve these words across a variety of\nexperimental manipulations.\n",

In their seminal work, Nairne, Thompson,\nand Pandeirada (2007) described findings from four related\nexperiments. In each experiment, participants rated the rele-\nvance of a list of neutral, unrelated words to the following\nsurvival scenario:\nIn this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded\nin the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival\nmaterials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady\nsupplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.\nWe are going to show you a list of words, and we would like\nyou to rate how relevant each of these words would be for you\nin this survival situation. Some of the words may be relevant\nand others may not--it's up to you to decide.\nThen, participants received an unexpected memory test for the\nwords that they had rated. Several deep-processing control\nconditions--moving relevance, pleasantness rating, and self-\nrelevance--were pit against the survival-relevance condition.\nAcross all four experiments, Nairne et al. (2007) found that\nprocessing in terms of survival increased retention compared\nto these control conditions. The survival advantage was con-\nsistent across their experiments.

In Experiment 1, participants were assigned to the\nstandard survival condition or one of several important control\nconditions: pleasantness, imagery, self-reference, generation,\nor intentional learning. Across all comparisons, survival pro-\ncessing promoted the best recall performance. These results\nwere also upheld in an additional experiment that compared\nsurvival processing with another scenario: a vacation-\nprocessing condition. These findings have led Nairne et al.\n(2008) to argue that survival processing ``is one of the best--\nif not the best--encoding procedures yet identified in human\nRecently, researchers have begun to investigate the potential\nmechanisms underlying the survival advantage. For example,\nsome have argued that survival processing is particularly effec-\ntive for promoting better memory performance because it\nplanning (Klein, Robertson, & Delton, 2010). Burns and col-\nleagues have also indicated that survival processing promotes\nboth item-specific and relational processing, while control con-\nditions often rely on just a single type of processing during\nencoding (Burns, Burns, & Hwang, 2011; Burns, Hart, Griffith,\n& Burns, 2013). Others have noted that survival processing\nleads to increased elaboration on the to-be-remembered words\nduring the encoding task. According to Kroneisen and Erd-\nfelder (2011), this elaborative encoding during survival pro-\ncessing leads to a larger mnemonic benefit. Their modified\nsurvival passage--which described just a single survival prob-\nlem in a need for water--did not promote better memory when\ncompared with the typical control conditions. Similarly, Ro\n\u00a8er,\nBell, and Buchner (2013) have observed that participants gen-\nerate a significantly greater number of ideas for how the to-be-\nremembered words might be used in survival settings, relative\nto how they might be used in other settings. Together, these\nfindings indicate that modifying the specific task used within\nthe experiment can bring us closer to uncovering the precise\nmechanisms underlying the advantage.\nHowever, results are mixed regarding the use of additional\ntasks to test the survival advantage. For example, researchers\nhave found that survival processing can promote better com-\npound remote association task performance (Garner & Howe,\n2013), location memory (Nairne, Van Arsdall, Pandeirada, &\nBlunt, 2012), and picture recall (Otgaar, Smeets, & van Bergen,\n2010) than control conditions. On the other hand, survival pro-\ncessing does not appear to benefit face memory (Savine, Scul-\nlin, & Roediger, 2011), implicit task performance (McBride,\nassociate learning (Schwartz & Brothers, 2014; unless they\nare animate paired-associates, VanArsdall, Nairne, Pandeir-\nada, & Cogdill, 2015), or spatial N-back performance (Altar-\nriba & Kazanas, 2014). Thus, an interesting area of inquiry for\nthis area of research is determining the precise conditions\nwhen survival processing does and does not enhance cogni-\ntive performance (Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015). As the major-\nity of studies conducted within this area of research have used\nrating tasks designed to promote word memory, we believe\nthat it is important to investigate whether survival processing\ncan improve performance on other tasks as well.\nOne task that has not been used within this area of research\nis the Stroop (1935) color-naming task. In this task, words are\nprinted in color, and participants respond to each word by\nnaming the color. When color words (e.g., red and blue) are\nused, congruent trials (e.g., red printed in red) are easier to\nprocess than incongruent trials (e.g., red printed in blue).\nStroop had commented that this interference from the color\nmanipulation was the result of color naming disrupting normal\nreading. An interesting set of follow-up experiments conducted\nby Besner, Stolz, and Boutilier (1997) manipulated the amount\nof color interference used in their Stroop tasks: Words were\neither printed fully in color or only a single letter within each\nword was presented in color. This latter condition significantly\nreduced the amount of interference in color naming, as less\nattention was given to the entire word.\nWhy would the Stroop color-naming task provide a unique\ncontribution to this area of research? Very few studies have\nexamined the role of survival processing on evolutionarily-\nrelevant tasks (but see Savine et al., 2011 for a failure to\nreplicate the survival advantage with faces). Studies from\nrelated paradigms, such as the emotion literature, indicate that\nprocessing threatening stimuli can have a facilitative effect on\ncolor-naming performance. For example, Shibasaki, Isomura,\nand Masataka (2014) determined that both adults and children\nwere able to detect the color of snakes faster than the color of\nflowers. These findings indicate that negative emotion, and\nperhaps fear in particular, can have a motivating effect on\ncognitive processing.\nDetecting color and identifying items by color are also\nrooted in evolutionary theory (for recent reviews, see e.g.,\n& Mollon, 2003). For example, Bompas, Kendall, and Sumner\n(2013) have determined that normal trichromats (organisms\nwith three types of color receptors on their retina, including\nhumans) detect fruit better than those with color deficiencies,\nwith the largest differences in detection performance at long\ndistances. Other selection pressures may have included a need\nto detect predators, young leaves, or social signals related to\nthese hypotheses have also been assessed using animal models,\nincluding macaque (Horwitz, 2015) and capuchin (Melin et al.,\n2014) monkeys. These hypothetical accounts for the evolution\nof color vision lend themselves to the survival-processing para-\ndigm in that they are the goals outlined within the survival\npassage itself.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nThe Current Study\nThe current study was motivated by a set of related goals. First,\nwe were interested in the impact of manipulating levels of\nprocessing within the survival-processing paradigm. While\nresearchers have begun to investigate the role of deeper process-\ning within the survival passage relative to control conditions\n\u00a8er, Bell, & Buchner,\n2013), the current study aims to compare depth of processing\nwithin the encoding tasks themselves. By using the Stroop task\nspecifically, we can investigate a second but related line of\nresearch. As human color vision is strongly believed to be evo-\nlutionarily adaptive in nature (e.g., Bompas, Kendall, & Sumner,\n2013), using the Stroop task will allow us to determine whether\nsurvival processing can boost color-naming performance. Addi-\ntionally, we are able to determine whether a congruency between\nthe survival passage and the adaptive nature of the color-naming\ntask can promote better memory performance. Finally, by using\nmultiple variants of the Stroop task, we can directly test whether\ndifferences in color-naming performance reported by Besner\net al. (1997) replicate within this paradigm.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants in this experiment (N \u00bc 130) were University at\nAlbany undergraduate students. Each participant gave their\ninformed consent and received either course credit or extra\ncredit for a psychology course. Participants indicated that they\nhad normal or corrected to normal vision and were tested for\nnormal color vision with the Ishihara (1993) Test Chart Book\nfor Color Deficiency.\nExperimental Conditions\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the five condi-\ntions (N \u00bc 26 for each of the five conditions) and received\ninstructions specific to their condition: survival with relevance\nratings, survival with word-color naming, survival with letter-\ncolor naming, pleasantness ratings, or baseline word-color\nnaming. Participants in three of the conditions read the survival\nscenario (Nairne et al., 2007). One condition resembled the\nstandard survival scenario, with all words presented in black\nin a survival-relevance word rating task:\nIn this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded\nin the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival\nmaterials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady\nsupplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.\nWe are going to show you a list of words, and we would like\nyou to rate how relevant each of these words would be for you\nin this survival situation. Some of the words may be relevant\nand others may not--it's up to you to decide.\nThe other two survival conditions used the Stroop color-\nnaming task. Five colors were used (red, yellow, green, blue,\nand purple), with an approximately equal number of words per\ncolor (5 or 6), pseudorandomly arranged with no more than\nthree of the same color in a row. Words were either presented\nin neutral (e.g., stone presented in blue) or incongruent (e.g.,\nemerald presented in red) colors. In one condition, the word-\ncolor naming condition, entire words were presented in color,\nand participants were instructed to name the color of each\nword, via key press:\nIn this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded\nin the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival\nmaterials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady\nsupplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.\nWe are going to show you a list of words, and we would like\nyou to name each color that the word is presented in. Identify-\ning items by color may be useful to survival.\nIn the second condition, the letter-color naming condition\n(Besner, Stolz, & Boutilier, 1997), one letter within each word,\nwas presented in a color. The remaining letters were presented\nin black. Instructions for this condition read:\nIn this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded in\nthe grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival mate-\nrials.Overthe nextfewmonths,you'llneedtofindsteady supplies\nof food and water and protect yourself from predators. We are\ngoing to show you a list of words, and a single letter in each word\nwill be colored. We would like you to name the color of that\nsingle-letter. Identifying items by color may be useful to survival.\nPleasantness rating instructions, with all words presented in\nblack, read:\nIn this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we\nwould like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. Some of\nthe words may be pleasant and others may not--it's up to you to\ndecide.\nOne final condition was used as a baseline for the two Stroop\nconditions. In this condition, participants performed a simple\nword-color naming task (without reading the survival passage),\nin order to determine the effectiveness of color processing in\nencoding a word for later retrieval. In this condition, entire\nwords were presented in color. Their instructions read:\nWe are going to show you a list of words, and we would like\nyou to name each color that the word is presented in.\nMaterials\nAll participants rated or named the color of the same set of 32\nwords, presented in the same order (selected from Nairne et al.,\n2007, Experiments 1 and 2). Five additional words (all concrete\nnouns, selected from Nairne et al., 2007, Experiment 3) were\nused to allow the participants to practice the task, but their\nresponses to these words were not retained for analyses.\nKazanas et al. 3\nProcedure\nParticipants were run individually, within the Cognition and\nLanguage Laboratory. Each word was presented for 5 s, during\nwhich participants performed either the rating or naming task,\nvia keypress. The experimenter assisted with practice trials,\nonly. After the rating or color-naming experimental trials, all\nparticipants performed 2 min of forward digit span (set to a\nlength of seven digits), followed by an unexpected free recall\ntask. Each participant was given a maximum of 10 min to recall\nas many words as they could, in any order.\nAfter the recall task, participants in the three survival con-\nditions answered the following questions (from Nairne & Pan-\ndeirada, 2010): (1) How interesting was the scenario? (2) How\neasy was it for you to create an ``image'' of the scenario in your\nmind? (3) How emotionally arousing was the scenario? (4)\nHow familiar are you with the situation described? Two addi-\ntional questions were included in the questionnaire (from\nOtgaar et al., 2011; Sandry, Trafimow, Marks, & Rice,\n2013): (5) How distinctive, or unusual, was the scenario? (6)\nHow rich in detail would you rate the scenario?\nAfter answering these questions, participants completed a\nbrief demographic questionnaire, which included questions\nrelated to age, gender, education, and native language. Each\nparticipant received a debriefing form and was granted credit\nfor their participation.\nResults\nFirst, participants in all five conditions were matched on age,\nlevel of education, and native language (all ps > .05). In\naddition, there were no significant differences in survival\nrelevance, pleasantness, or color naming (whether naming\nwas according to word or letter color) response times (RTs;\nsignificantly slower than RTs in the baseline word-color\nsurvival-relevance and pleasantness ratings did not interact\nwith recall performance (all ps > .05), which is common in\nthis area of research (see Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015). This is\nan important indicator that a word's a priori survival rele-\nvance or pleasantness does not increase its memorability dur-\ning the recall task.\nNext, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was con-\nducted to detect any differences in the proportion of correct\nrecall among the five conditions. This ANOVA was signifi-\nthat recall in the survival with relevance-rating condition was\ngreatest (M \u00bc .424), which was significantly greater than recall\nin the pleasantness condition (M \u00bc .283; p < .01). These two\nconditions led to significantly greater recall than the three\ncolor-naming conditions (all ps < .01). Recall across the sur-\nvival with word-color naming (M \u00bc .082), baseline word-color\nnaming (M \u00bc .055), and survival with letter-color naming (M \u00bc\n.049) conditions did not differ (all ps > .05). Means and stan-\ndard deviations (SDs) for recall in these five conditions are\nincluded in Table 1, and Figure 1 includes means and 95%\nconfidence intervals.\nA series of one-way ANOVAs and planned contrasts were\nconducted to detect any differences in each of the scenario\nratings among the three survival conditions. Two of these\nANOVAs were significant. The rating for how ``interesting the\nplanned contrasts revealing that participants found the survival\nwith relevance-rating and survival with letter-color naming\nconditions as equally interesting and more interesting than\nthe survival with word-color naming condition. The rating\np < .001, with the survival with relevance-rating condition\nbeing the most imageable and survival with letter-color and\nword-color naming conditions being equally imageable. The\nratings for ``emotional arousal,'' ``familiarity,'' ``distinctive-\nness,'' and ``richness'' did not differ among the three sur-\nvival conditions (i.e., participants found these conditions to\nbe equally arousing, familiar, distinctive, and rich in detail).\nMeans and SDs for each rating by condition comparison are\nincluded in Table 2. Overall, results from the scenario ratings\nreflect those of the recall task: Each of these ratings is believed\nto measure a dimension of encoding that enhances memory and\nretrieval. Thus, it is reasonable for higher ratings on these\ndimensions to correspond with better recall. While participants\nconsistently rated the survival with relevance-rating condition\nhigher than the other conditions on many of these dimensions,\ndifferences across conditions were only significant for the\n``interesting'' and ``imageable'' dimensions, with the ``image-\nable'' ratings matching recall performance. Perhaps the con-\ncrete nature of the relevance-rating task is an important\ncontributor to its effect on memory.\nApproximately half of our participants recalled words that\nwere not included on either the practice or the experimental\ntrials. Intrusions were analyzed in two ways. First, we analyzed\nthe total number of intrusions according to condition, using a\none-way ANOVA. This ANOVA was significant, F(4, 73) \u00bc\n3.728, p < .01. Participants in the survival with word-color\nnaming condition recalled the highest number of intrusions\n(M \u00bc 4.18), which was significantly greater than the number\nreported by participants in the pleasantness condition, who\nrecalled the fewest intrusions (M \u00bc 1.42; p \u00bc .01). We then\ngrouped our intrusions into a number of categories: survival-\nrelated (e.g., knife), semantically related to words from the lists\n(e.g., rock, as stone was one of the practice words), phonolo-\ngically related to words from the lists (e.g., can, as pan was one\nof the experimental words), orthographically related to words\nfrom the lists (e.g., pen, as pan was one of the experimental\nwords), colors (e.g., blue), color related (e.g., fire hydrant), and\nother (e.g., believe). When analyzing the intrusion categories\naccording to condition, two of the interactions were significant:\nsurvival-related category, participants in the survival with\nword-color naming condition made more intrusions (M \u00bc\n2.17) than the baseline color-naming condition (M \u00bc .64) and\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\npleasantness-rating condition (M \u00bc .50; both ps < .05). In the\ncolor-related category, participants in the baseline color-\nnaming condition (M \u00bc .64) made more intrusions than the\nsurvival-relevance rating condition (M \u00bc 0; p < .05).\nFinally, to determine whether the survival scenario moti-\nvated better Stroop performance, we conducted several analy-\nses across the three color-naming conditions. First, we assessed\noverall color-naming accuracy with a one-way ANOVA. There\nwere no significant differences across these conditions (p \u00bc\n.063), though the survival with word-color naming condition\nhad a lower proportion of correct responses (M \u00bc .91), relative\nto the survival with letter-color naming (M \u00bc .98) and baseline\nword-color naming (M \u00bc .98) conditions. Next, we compared\nRTs to incongruent (e.g., emerald presented in red) and neutral\n(e.g., stone presented in blue) words across the three color-\nnaming conditions. Although the survival with word-color\nnaming condition had the largest amount of interference\n(M \u00bc 71 ms), relative to the baseline word-color naming\ncondition (M \u00bc 35 ms) and survival with letter-color naming\ncondition (M \u00bc 1 ms), the magnitude of interference did not\np \u00bc .539. While this pattern of interference data resembles\nthose described by Besner et al. (1997), with a reduction in\ncolor-naming interference when participants focused on the\ncolor of a single letter within a word, any nonsignificant result\nshould be interpreted with some caution. These findings and\ntheir implications are further discussed in the following section.\nDiscussion\nFindings from the current study are numerous and provide a\nsignificant contribution to this area of research. First, we have\nreplicated the survival advantage in memory, when comparing\nthe effects of survival-relevance ratings against pleasantness\nratings and new color-naming conditions. Importantly, this\nadvantage was not due to any significant difference in RTs or\nratings during encoding. However, results from the scenario rat-\nings indicate that the survival advantage may be due, in part, to\nrelevance rating being a more imageable task. There was some\nevidence that survival-relevance rating may be a more interesting\ntask as well. In other words, the encoding portion of the task is\nlikely to be the most critical portion of the task, overall.\nFindings from the color-naming conditions were novel to\nthis paradigm. First, recall performance in these conditions was\nsignificantly worse than the survival-relevance and pleasant-\nness rating conditions. Encouraging participants to consider a\nsurvival situation while color naming impaired later recall per-\nformance. Importantly, there is a precedent for this pattern of\ndata within the survival literature. In a study examining the role\nof cognitive load in the survival advantage, Kroneisen, Rum-\nmel, and Erdfelder (2013) found that increasing load with an\nadditional task reduced word recall and eliminated the survival\nadvantage. Similarly, when comparing recall performance in the\ncurrent study across the color-naming conditions, differences in\nrecall performance were minimal. In addition, as was the case\nwith Kroenisen et al. (2013), recall performance was significantly\nimpaired, with participants in our three color-naming conditions\nrecalling less than 10% of the word list (near floor performance).\nParticularly, poor recall, with little variation across these condi-\ntions, indicates that the survival advantage may rely on additional\nprocessing, relative to less effortful control conditions.\nResults also indicate that survival processing did not moti-\nvate better color-naming performance, relative to the baseline\ncolor-naming condition. When comparing word color-naming\naccuracy, participants who read the survival passage actually\nperformed numerically worse than those who had not read the\nsurvival passage. Similarly, participants who read the survival\npassage before engaging in the color-naming task experienced\na larger amount of interference than participants who had not\nread the survival passage. As differences in the magnitude of\ncolor-naming interference were not significant (a failure to\nreplicate effects reported by Besner et al., 1997), our interpre-\ntations of these findings are cautious. While sample size may\naccount for some portion of null effects, the reduction in Stroop\nFigure 1. A comparison of recall by condition, with 95% confidence\nintervals.\nTable 1. Proportion of Correct Recall: Means and SDs.\nCondition Mean SD\nTable 2. Survival scenario ratings: Means and SDs.\nRating\nSurvival \u00fe\nRelevance\nRating\nSurvival \u00fe\nWord-Color\nNaming\nSurvival \u00fe\nLetter-Color\nNaming\nEmotional\nArousal\nKazanas et al. 5\ninterference has been demonstrated with conditions having as\nfew as 16 participants (Besner, 2001). Thus, our findings may\nbe the result of a sizable difference in design, given the addi-\ntional survival scenario presented to two of the three color-\nnaming conditions.\nWith respect to both survival-processing and color-naming\ninterference, it is possible that the incongruent items (e.g., a\ngreen orange or blue broccoli) were more difficult to concep-\ntualize, as they violated the laws of nature as well as our parti-\ncipants' expectations from previous experiences with oranges\nand broccoli. Thus, these participants may have been particu-\nlarly preoccupied by these items, with greater interference indi-\ncating poorer performance. Importantly, processing this\ndiscrepancy between an object's typical color and its color\nduring the task did not increase recall performance (nor did it\nsignificantly slow RTs).\nHowever, can poorer performance in a color-naming task be\nconsidered adaptive? Perhaps coming across an unusual fruit or\nvegetable requires additional inspection, to ensure it is safe to\ningest, as our general pattern of interference data from the\ncolor-naming task would indicate. In other words, it may be\nthe case that being in a survival setting puts us ``on high alert''\nto find good nutrients. Likewise, our intrusion analyses indicate\nthat participants who read the survival passage recalled more\nsurvival-relevant intrusions than those who had not read the\nsurvival passage. We surmise that these false memories are a\nstrong indicator that survival processing encourages spreading\nactivation from the related words to other words that would be\nuseful in survival situations (e.g., a knife). These findings have\nbeen observed in similar memory studies, such as those within\nthe Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, with both\nadults and children (Howe & Derbish, 2010; Otgaar & Smeets,\n2010). There are many examples of similar ``errors'' within the\nmemory literature, and several of them have similar adaptive\nvalue. For example, a child's tendency to imitate or defer to an\nadult's opinion or memory provides them with unique advan-\ntages. For one, source-monitoring errors provide a valuable\nmemory boost: A young child observes an adult perform a task\nyet falsely attributes the action to themselves, leading to\nincreased elaboration and better memory (see Sellers & Bjork-\nSellers and Bjorklund (2014) have hypothesized that nega-\ntive emotions, such as those related to fearing the consequences\nof a survival situation, may be driving these effects. Thus, these\nseemingly negative consequences of survival processing may\nactually have adaptive value when conceptualized within both\nmemory and evolutionary theories. Together, they indicate that\nsurvival processing provides a large number of benefits, which\ncan only be studied when exploring new tasks and experimental\nmanipulations.\nImplications and Future Directions\nAlthough these results are not the most straightforward exam-\nples of a survival advantage, we believe that they greatly\nextend the original conception of the advantage (Nairne\net al., 2007). In fact, it may be the case that survival processing\nhas far-reaching implications for understanding behavior, such\nas color-naming performance described in the current study.\nThus, this area of literature would greatly benefit from addi-\ntional studies investigating the generalizability of the survival\nadvantage to new tasks and experimental procedures, particu-\nlarly those with adaptive value, such as the unconventional\nintrusion findings reported in the current study. The number\nof experiments designed to study the limits of the advantage are\ngreatly outnumbered by the number of experiments designed to\nreplicate the advantage with different control conditions, par-\nticipant populations, or modified passages (for a review, see\nKazanas & Altarriba, 2015). Thus, we encourage greater explo-\nration of how the advantage fares with tasks that tap into cog-\nnitive domains other than episodic memory (e.g., attention,\nworking memory, etc.). Additional research might also explore\nreal-world applications or more realistic situations for adult-\nage populations (e.g., the first day of school at a new university,\nstarting a new job, etc.). Perhaps future work would benefit\nfrom additional control conditions, such as these familiar situa-\ntions, to compare memory following survival and nonsurvival\nprocessing. A limitation of our study lies in our lack of a\nsituation-based control condition, although we did include a\npleasantness rating task.\nWe also encourage additional research investigating the\nrelationship between considering ones' survival needs and\nidentifying items by color. For example, how would results\nfrom a study using picture stimuli (e.g., having participants\nname the color of a red apple versus a blue apple) compare\nwith our results using words? If participants are concerned\nabout a food shortage, would an unusually colored piece of\nfruit draw more attentional resources? In addition, would some\ncolors capture more attention and increase memorability for\nthose objects? Would participants categorize objects by color\nand recall them together? How might animacy play a role in\nthis paradigm? For example, children as young as 4 years old\ndetect snakes in visual search tasks faster when the snakes are\npresented in color, rather than gray scale (Hayakawa, Kawai, &\nMasataka, 2011). Findings from studies conducted with adult\nparticipants are equally relevant: Color naming is significantly\nfaster when snakes are presented--a threatening stimulus--\nrelative to flowers (Shibasaki, Isomura, & Masataka, 2014).\nFinally, we encourage additional investigations related to those\nconducted by Besner et al. (1997). Our interference data resem-\nble their pattern of data, encouraging additional research\nregarding this phenomenon. We recommend that researchers\nassess whether the reduction in Stroop interference reported by\nBesner et al. (1997) replicates when participants are simulta-\nneously completing other tasks, as we attempted here, using\nsurvival processing. These are just a few potential research\nquestions to continue this interesting area of inquiry.\nConclusion\nOur overall findings indicate that engaging in survival process-\ning increases memory for a set of unrelated words. In addition,\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nthis task led participants to spend more time on words that were\npresented in incongruent colors, relative to participants who\nwere not thinking about the survival scenario. These results\nsupport a survival advantage specifically guided by ancestral\npriorities: Our ancestors would have benefited from turning\ntheir attention toward objects that violated their expectations,\nespecially if they were in danger or needed to quickly gather\nsurvival materials. Additionally, having carefully classified\nand analyzed participants' intrusions--a measure often associ-\nated with false memory--we believe that survival processing\nmay also promote spreading activation from one survival item\nto an entire set of related items. Together, these findings repli-\ncate the survival advantage and extend its generalizability to a\nnew task with adaptive value.\nAuthors' Note\nPortions of these data were presented at the 86th annual meeting of the\nMidwestern Psychological Association, Chicago, IL, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAltarriba, J., & Kazanas, S.
