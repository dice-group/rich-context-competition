T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index, the CSGR Globalisation Index,\nthe KOF Index of Globalization, and the Maastricht Globalisation Index. Besides important similarities as regards structure,\nthe dimensions considered, and the indicators used, the main feature shared by these instruments is the fact that they all\nuse the same unit of analysis: the nation-state. This is a somewhat paradoxical situation, if one considers that one of the\nmost distinctive characteristics of globalization is precisely that its dynamics extend beyond the state and the country. Gives\nthis premise, the aim of the article is, on the one hand, to justify in any case the use of instruments that seek to measure\nglobalization on the basis of states, and, on the other, to propose alternative approaches to such measurement. The article's\nunderlying assumption is that different approaches to the measurement of globalization are not mutually exclusive. Rather,\nsuch a plurality of perspectives is opportune and desirable given the complexity and multidimensionality of the concept of\nglobalization.\n",

In this regard, a first distinction can be drawn between,\non the one hand, indexes that attempt to capture the multidi-\nmensional nature of globalization and, on the other, those that\nfocus exclusively on one dimension of the process, which is\nvery often--but not always--the economic one. Considering\nthat multidimensionality is one of the most characteristic fea-\ntures of globalization, this article will consider only instru-\nments that adopt a multidimensional approach.\nBut besides differing because they take or do not take a\nmultidimensional approach to measuring the phenomenon,\nglobalization indexes are also distinguished by the choice of\ndimensions to be considered, the indicators used in con-\nstructing the index, the weights assigned to the indicators\nthemselves, as well as the techniques by which the latter are\naggregated. A further feature that differentiates among\nattempts made to date to measure globalization is whether\nthey are essentially sporadic or, conversely, whether the\ninstruments used are able to consolidate over time.\nIn this regard, four main instruments have received pro-\ngressive development and at least some updating of the data\non which they are constructed. First, there is the A. T.\nKearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index (The Global\nTop 20, 2007): This has been the first globalization index to\ngain some visibility in the scientific debate, given that all the\nauthors who have subsequently attempted to develop global-\nization indexes have made reference to it, although not infre-\nquently doing so in critical terms. Then there are the CSGR\nGlobalisation Index (Lockwood & Redoano, 2005), the\nMaastricht Globalisation Index (Martens & Raza, 2010), and\nfinally the KOF Index of Globalization (Dreher, Gaston, &\nMartens, 2008), which, among the instruments mentioned, is\nperhaps the most interesting as it is the one for which the data\nhave been most frequently updated, the last occasion being\nReferring to Caselli (2012) for detailed analysis of the\nways in which these instruments are constructed and the\n1Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milano, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nMarco Caselli, Dipartimento di Sociologia, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro\nEmail: marco.caselli@unicatt.it\nNation States, Cities, and People:\nAlternative Ways to Measure\nGlobalization\nMarco Caselli1\n Keywords\nsociology, social sciences, globalization, measurement and scaling method, research methods, selection of research units,\nsociological research methods\n2 SAGE Open\nresults that they have yielded, to be emphasized here is the\nremarkable similarity in the underlying structure of the four\nindexes mentioned, as evidenced in Table 1.\nAll four indexes, in fact, consider the economic and political\ndimensions of globalization. Likewise, all four of them consider\nboth the social dimension--though the A. T. Kearney/Foreign\nPolicy Globalization Index gives it a different name--and the\ntechnological dimension of the phenomenon, although the\nCSGR Globalisation Index and the KOF Index of Globalization\nconsider these two dimensions jointly. The only exception is the\nMaastricht Globalisation Index, which, unlike the other three\ninstruments, also includes an ecological dimension.\nBecause the cultural dimension of globalization is partic-\nularly difficult to measure,3 none of the above four indices\nincludes it among its fundamental dimensions. Nevertheless,\nall the instruments comprise indicators and variables that can\nbe entirely or partly related to the cultural aspects of global-\nization, and which are included in either the social or the\ntechnological dimension.\nComparison of the results of the four indices is compli-\ncated by the fact that they refer to different years and are\ncalculated for a more or less extensive range of countries.4\nHowever, Table 2 is an attempt to make such a comparison\nbased on the relative positions of each country according to\neach index and limiting the analysis to the 55 countries for\nwhich all four indices have been calculated.\nA first finding that emerges from the table is that the highest\nplaces in the rankings of all four indexes are mainly occupied by\nmember-countries of the European Union, and particularly ones\nof small size.5 This finding prompts the question of the extent to\nwhich the instruments effectively measure the degree of global-\nization of countries and the extent to which, instead, they mea-\nsure regionalization dynamics. Accordingly, it would be\nadvisable for globalization indexes to consider not only flows\nand relations between a particular country and other countries,\nbut also the number6 and the geographical position of those\nsame countries (De Lombaerde & Iapadre, 2007). However,\nthis undertaking would encounter the difficulty of collecting\nsimilar information, and the only (moreover partial) attempt in\nthis direction has been made by Vujakovic (2010).\nInspection of Table 2 also shows that, while some coun-\ntries are ranked by the various indices in substantially similar\nmanner--this is the case, for example, of Switzerland,\nDenmark, Sweden, New Zealand, Romania, Thailand, and\nVenezuela--there are others which the various instruments\nconsidered allocate to very different positions. This is the\n(striking) case of the United States, a country considered\nhighly globalized by the A. T. Kearney/Foreign Policy\nGlobalization Index and by the CSGR Globalisation Index\n(5th and 4th position respectively) but which occupies decid-\nedly lower positions in the classifications drawn up on the\nbases of the KOF Index of Globalization and the Maastricht\nGlobalisation Index (22nd and 36th position respectively).\nOther countries whose positions are not determined unequiv-\nocally are, for example, Canada, China, Russia, and Panama.\nThese considerations show that estimates of the global-\nization levels of individual countries may vary even mark-\nedly according to the measurement instrument used. This\nmeans that the choices made when constructing the instru-\nments--especially selection of the indicators, as well as\ndeciding the aggregation procedure and the weights--have\nimportant repercussions on the results obtained.\nNow that the results of four globalization indexes have\nbeen presented, albeit partially, some brief considerations\ncan be made concerning the use of these results. First, as sug-\ngested in Table 2, the results can be used synchronically to\ncompare the levels of globalization of different countries.\nBut they can also be used diachronically to consider the tem-\nporal dimension to analyze the different speeds and trajecto-\nries with which countries are globalizing (or, conversely,\nde-globalizing): a temporal dimension of especial signifi-\ncance because globalization is a process. For this purpose,\nhowever, the data necessary to calculate globalization\nindexes should be collected systematically and continuously\nin time, but this systematicity and continuity today seem\nguaranteed only, as said, by the KOF Index of Globalization.\nThe Nation-State as the Unit of\nAnalysis for Globalization Indices: Pros\nand Cons\nThe indices presented in the previous section, as well as\nmany others, are rather heterogeneous, but they are united by\nthe fact that they all use the same unit of analysis: namely the\nnation-state. This choice is made \"for convenience\" because\nmost of the statistical data, and therefore indicators,\nTable 1.

One suspects,\nin fact, that measuring globalization by referring to the\nnation-state is to distort the very essence of the concept stud-\nied. As already pointed out by the scientific debate, it is of\ncrucial importance to distinguish between globalization and\ninternationalization: While the latter refers to processes and\ndynamics occurring within and in relation to the system of\nnation-states, the concept of globalization refers (also) to\nprocesses that unfold heedless of that system (Sklair, 1999,\nthat the distinctive feature of globalization is deterritorializa-\nof territorial constraints--processes, that is, which may be\nsituated anywhere or, conversely, nowhere (in virtual space\nfor example).\nIn light of these considerations, reflection on the theme of\nglobalization has induced several authors to dispute what has\nbeen variously labeled \"methodological nationalism\" (Beck,\nical territorialism\" (Scholte, 2000): that is, the perspective\nlargely dominant since the origins of the social sciences and\nwhich envisages a substantial overlap between the concept of\nsociety and that of the nation-state, which is therefore con-\nsidered the natural container of economic, cultural, and polit-\nical processes.\nThat of the nation-state, therefore, cannot be the only per-\nspective, the only lens through which one studies and analy-\nses a multidimensional and above all multiscalar process like\nglobalization (Sassen, 2007). However, this does not mean\nthat it is illegitimate to use the nation-state as the unit of anal-\nysis for construction of a globalization measure. Affirming\nthe existence of deterritorialized dynamics and processes is\nnot to deny the persisting and in many respects renewed\nimportance of the spatial dimension of globalization.\nGlobalization, in fact, is an extremely complex phenomenon,\nand part of its complexity resides in the fact that it can be\ninterpreted from different points of view: The deterritorial-\nized dimension of globalization does not exclude the local-\nized one, and the global dimension does not exclude the local\none. The national point of view is therefore one of the many\nlegitimate points of view from which globalization can be\nread (Beck, 2004). This is of particular importance if one\nconsiders that the state contributes substantially to shaping\nglobalization processes: For example, it is the state that fur-\nnishes the infrastructures--particularly for transport and\ncommunications--that make possible the transnational flows\nthat constitute the essence itself of globalization (Axford,\nnation-states continue to be key actors in the economic and\nsocial spheres (Ray, 2007, p. 75) as well as essential referents\nin the everyday lives of all the planet's inhabitants.\nApart from practical convenience, therefore, using the\nnation-state as the unit of analysis in the study and measure-\nment of globalization processes is in many respects an\nacceptable procedure. However, this should not obscure the\nfact that this procedure, however legitimate, allows the ana-\nlyst to grasp only some aspects of globalization and not oth-\ners, even though they are extremely significant. It has been\npointed out, for example, that it is almost impossible to mea-\nsure the ecological aspects of globalization by working on\nnational bases (Dreher et al., 2008, p. 38). More generally,\nthere is the problem of grasping more genuinely global\naspects of the process on the basis of international data\nprocesses are distinguished by their multiscalar nature, the\nproblem is not so much finding and using units of analysis\nalternative to the nation-state as combining several units of\nanalysis and, therefore, different perspectives of inquiry.\nThis is said in the awareness that no perspective and no unit\nof analysis, on its own, can enable an exhaustive account to\nbe made of the complexity of globalization processes.\nDifferent Approaches\nAlthough, for the reasons given above, it appears anyway\nacceptable to measure globalization on the basis of states--the\nparadox remains that studied at this level is a phenomenon\namong whose essential features is that, in certain significant\ndomains, it annuls states, their role, and their boundaries. This\nlatter consideration prompts the question as to whether instru-\nments can be devised that measure globalization using other\nunits of analysis. It should nevertheless be immediately\npointed out that attempts in this direction should not be\nregarded as antithetical to, or in conflict with, the most com-\nmon approach based on the state. In fact, as repeatedly empha-\nsized, globalization is an extraordinarily complex process that\ncan be analyzed and interpreted from numerous standpoints\nthat are not alternative to each other but, on the contrary, com-\nplementary. As Beck (2004) puts it, the logic that guides us\nwhen analyzing globalization should not be that of \"either . . .\nor . . . \" but rather \"both . . . and . . . \"\nIn the same vein, Sassen (2007) explains--as already\nrecalled in the previous section--that a distinctive feature of\nglobalization is its multiscalar nature. That is to say, global-\nization exerts its effects differently according to the territo-\nrial level considered--from the neighborhood to the planet\nas a whole. But there is something more. The effects of glo-\nbalization differ not only according to territorial level but\nalso according to social level. For example, by virtue of the\nso-called \"mobiletic revolution\" (Gross, 1966; Russett,\nand therefore the configuration of physical space. Some dis-\ntances shorten until they almost disappear and are no longer\nobstacles against human action, while others diminish much\nless markedly. The extent of this contraction of distance\ndepends primarily on the characteristics of the places\ninvolved, and especially on the infrastructures with which\nthey are endowed: Ease of transport connections makes the\nmain cities of Europe or North America much closer to each\nother than are villages in many African countries. But it also\ndepends on the characteristics of the people involved: For\nexample, the distance between the European Union and\nKenya is much shorter for the average citizen of the former\nthan it is for the average citizen of the latter.\nGiven these premises, a first unit of analysis--different\nfrom but, as said, not alternative to the state--which can be\nused to construct an index of globalization is the city. This\nunit of analysis has already been used by the instruments\nproposed by Taylor (2004), in particular the one designed to\nmeasure Global Network Connectivity, and by the A. T.\nKearney/Foreign Policy Global Cities Index (The 2008\nGlobal Cities Index, 2008). These are instruments very dif-\nferent from each other in the number of cities taken into\naccount and the way in which they are constructed,7 although\nthey yield largely similar results: As shown in Table 3, in\nfact, fully 9 cities appear in the top 10 positions in the Global\nNetwork Connectivity and the Global Cities Index.\nHere, however, my intention is to focus in particular on\nanother possible unit of analysis for the construction of\ninstruments with which to measure globalization: the person.\nGiven that it has not yet been systematically applied, in the\nnext section suggestions will be made in regard to its possi-\nble definition and implementation.\nThe Person-Based Approach\nThere are authors who point out that, with some exceptions,\nthe human person is largely neglected by theories of global-\nsurprising that the instruments devised to measure the phe-\nnomenon have to date used units of analysis different from\nthe person. Nevertheless, I argue that an approach to the\nmeasurement of globalization that focuses on the single\nindividual is broadly justifiable and, indeed, potentially very\nfertile for understanding the complex and multiform dynam-\nics with which globalization manifests itself. This contention\nis borne out by the fact that, within a particular state, but also\nin a particular city, globalization can and has very different\neffects and meanings for different people. Added to this is\nthe fact that the world is not just a set of states, it is also a set\nof people, whose relationships are not always mediated by\nYet the aim of this section is not to devise an instrument\nfor the measurement of globalization whose unit of analysis\nis the persons. Instead, its more modest intention is to put\nforward suggestions on how such an instrument could be\nconstructed.8\nBroadly speaking, I believe that a Person-Based\nGlobalization Index (PBGI) should consider the following\nsix main dimensions: (a) possession of the resources and the\nabilities necessary to move and act in the global scenario; (b)\neffective mobility and activity in supranational and tenden-\ncially global domains; (c) belonging and a sense of belong-\ning to global, or at any rate nonterritorial, entities; (d)\nexposure to global flows of mass communication; (e) partici-\npation in global, or at any rate supranational, communication\nflows; and (f) degree of global consciousness.\nPossession of the Resources and the Abilities\nNecessary to Move and Act in the Global\nScenario\nThe ability to act in a context more extensive than the local\nand national one, and the ability to live, so to speak, global-\nization and not just undergo its consequences derives from\npossession of certain specific capacities and material\nresources. Indicators of this dimension could be, for instance,\nknowledge of an international lingua franca (primarily\nEnglish), possession of a passport, possession of a credit\ncard, access to the Internet and the ability to use it, and the\namount of personal income. In regard to the first of these\nindicators--relative to language--it might be objected that\nthis would benefit a priori the citizens of English-speaking\ncountries. I would respond to this objection by pointing out\nthat knowledge of English (but also other languages, perhaps\nwith the attribution of diversified weights) is anyway an\nobjective and important factor in the ability to move in the\nglobal scenario. It should therefore be considered.\nEffective Mobility and Activity in Supranational\nand Tendencially Global Domains\nEndowment with the above-mentioned resources and capacities\nmay give rise to different forms--and especially intensities--of\naction in the global sphere. An element certainly to be consid-\nered is the international physical mobility of the subjects stud-\nied. In particular, one indicator could be the number of times in\nwhich, in a given period of time, a national border has been\nTable 3. Comparison Among the Top 10 Cities in Relation to\nthe Global Network Connectivity Index (Reference Year: 2000) and\nthe Global Cities Index (Year of Publication: 2008).\nRank Global network connectivity Global Cities Index\n1 London New York\n2 New York London\n3 Hong Kong Paris\n4 Paris Tokyo\n5 Tokyo Hong Kong\n6 Singapore Los Angeles\n7 Chicago Singapore\n8 Milan Chicago\n9 Los Angeles Seoul\n6 SAGE Open\ncrossed. However, this indicator should be combined with infor-\nmation relative to the number of borders crossed, as well as to\nthe locations of the countries visited, the purpose being to distin-\nguish (or at any rate evaluate differently) globalization from\nregionalization--or from commuting dynamics, as in the case\nof transfrontier workers: This problem has already been men-\ntioned when examining the results of the tools that measure glo-\nbalization on the basis of the nation-state.\nConsideration could also be made of information con-\ncerning the range of action of people's jobs and investments.\nFurther indicators could be the frequency with which sub-\njects find themselves in what Marc Aug\u00e9 (1992) calls \"non-\nplaces\": That is, spaces devoid of local features and therefore\nable to minimize the cultural attrition due to travel and action\nin foreign countries, such as airports or hotels belonging to\nthe great international chains. Again, this dimension could\ncomprise the deliberate use and consumption of foreign\nproducts.9\nBelonging and a Sense of Belonging to Global, or\nat Any Rate Nonterritorial, Entities\ningly identify with groups, or they have a sense of belonging,\nwhich are genuinely global in that they exist not through but\ndespite national boundaries. This is a dimension that cannot\nbe immediately translated into empirical terms, and whose\ndetailed definition would be beyond the scope of the present\ndiscussion. However, I suggest that its principal indicator\nmight be membership of, and activity in, groups of suprana-\ntional extension. Tied to the sense of global belonging is also\nthe spread of cosmopolitan lifestyles, attitudes, and relations\n(Hannerz, 1990). However, this is a key dimension of that\ncultural globalization that is very hard to grasp by using ter-\nritorial indicators. A PBGI instead appears decidedly more\npromising, although identification of the specific indicators\nto use would require reflection falling outside the scope of\nthis contribution. A proposal might be to use statements\nreflecting a more or less cosmopolitan vision of the world,\nand with which the subjects studied would express their\ndegree of agreement or disagreement. The dimension of the\nsense of global belonging would thus also include, ulti-\nmately, the sharing of planetary-level values and principles,\nsuch as those expressed by the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. However, the inclusion of references to val-\nues in an instrument intended to be applicable to a global\nscale appears problematic. In fact, the risk of ethnocentrism\nis very high--and consequently so too is the risk that the\ninstrument will not gain wide recognition.\nExposure to Global Flows of Mass\nCommunication\nA particularly important aspect of globalization is the exis-\ntence of communication flows that traverse the planet in\nasymmetric and fundamentally unidirectional manner. There\nare consequently news stories--but also images, values, and\npatterns of consumption--which may be known to all or\nalmost all of the planet's inhabitants, and which all or almost\nall of the planet's inhabitants can form an opinion about or\ndiscuss.An indicator of this dimension could be, for instance,\nthe frequency with which people watch or listen to interna-\ntional television or radio news broadcasts, the frequency\nwith which they visit international information websites, or\ntheir knowledge about certain global events (for example,\nthe venue of the last Olympic Games or the last World\nFootball Championships).\nParticipation in Global, or at Any Rate\nSupranational, Communication Flows\nThe inhabitants of the Earth are not just passive recipients of\nthe information and communication flows that traverse the\nplanet. Very often, they themselves generate such flows,\nespecially in the form of interpersonal communications at a\ndistance. Indeed, thanks to the development of communica-\ntion media and abatement of their costs, our planet is swathed\nby an extremely dense network of communications; a net-\nwork whose existence is a further distinctive feature of glo-\nbalization, and whose nodes are single individuals (or small\ngroups). Indicators of this dimension could be the interna-\ntional contacts--telephone calls, SMS, email exchanges, and\nother contacts via the Web, as well as those through social\nnetworks like Facebook--made in a particular interval of\ntime. In this case, too, as suggested above in regard to physi-\ncal mobility, consideration should be made of the number\nand the locations of the countries involved in such exchanges,\nso that it is possible to distinguish genuinely global factors\nand situations from others that also come about on a suprana-\ntional scale.\nDegree of Global Consciousness\n\"Global consciousness\" is probably the aspect of globaliza-\ntion that is most difficult to study, and which, therefore, is\nleast studied (Holton, 2005, p. 39). This is so despite the fact\nthat--as emphasized since the first studies on the phenome-\nstitutive dimensions of globalization itself. And also despite\nthe fact that the manner in which people interpret globaliza-\ntion processes, as well as their emotional reactions to them,\nplay a crucial role in determining the strategies and the\ncourses of action enacted individually and collectively in\nresponse to globalization. For example, the difficulty of\nimplementing joint supranational policies to address issues\nof global importance, such as protection of the natural envi-\nronment or the management of economic and financial cri-\nses, is probably due to the fact that, as some authors suspect,\nthere is still insufficient awareness of the global reach of\nsuch issues (Kennedy, 2010, p. 5). Measurement of global\nconsciousness is precluded to instruments that use territorial\nunits of analysis, but it becomes possible when the unit of\nanalysis is the person--which further testifies to the poten-\ntial of this approach. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that\nthe concept of global consciousness is very difficult to opera-\ntionalize: that is, convert into empirically measurable terms.\nIn this case, too, I suggest as possible indicators various\nstimuli with which to record the degree of agreement or dis-\nagreement of informants with statements concerning interde-\npendence relations among different parts of the planet.\nBesides theoretical considerations that may modify,\nenrich, or even reverse my suggestions concerning the pos-\nsible dimensions and indicators with which to construct a\nPBGI, when creating such an instrument, a practical problem\nof particular importance would arise. Unlike the indices\nbased on states or cities, in fact, a PBGI cannot be calculated\non the basis of secondary data--that is, data collected from\nalready-existing statistical sources. Nor, as in the case of the\ninstrument proposed by Taylor, can it be calculated on the\nbasis of information obtainable with \"desk work\"--for\nexample, the exploration and analysis of websites. It will be\ninstead necessary to go into the field and directly question a\nsample of informants: An operation that obviously entails\ndifficulties in terms of organization and costs. In this regard,\nwhile a survey conducted on a planetary scale is unthinkable,\nones of lesser extent, but nevertheless multilocal in scale, are\nfeasible. However, the degree of territorial coverage will be\nless than that obtained by using the other instruments men-\ntioned in the previous sections.\nGiven this difficulty and this consequent limitation, the\nconstruction of a PBGI should move through a first experi-\nmental phase, during which the largest possible number of\nindicators are tested for each of the above-suggested dimen-\nsions, as well as possible others. Subsequently, the results of\nthis first phase should serve to select the indicators, among\nall those tested, to be included in the definitive PBGI. These\nindicators should be as few in number as possible. A particu-\nlarly \"slender\" instrument, in fact, would not require the con-\nduct of an ad hoc survey; on the contrary, it could be easily\ninserted into the numerous surveys periodically carried out\nin almost every part of the world, thus making the datum of\nthe PBGI available on a potentially global scale.\nHaving stated the difficulties involved in the construction\nof a PBGI, also to be emphasized is what instead is one of its\nmain strengths. This consists in the fact that, because the per-\nson is an elementary unit, the data collected in this way can\nthen be combined in multiple different forms. The person-\nbased approach, therefore, is not incompatible with those\nbased on states or cities. For the information collected and\norganized by means of a PBGI would also be able, for exam-\nple, to show the percentage of globalized subjects resident in\na state or a city, and also in a sub- or supranational region.\nBut this same information could also be used to compare the\ndifferent levels of globalization among the members of dif-\nferent professions, or among different scientific communi-\nties, where the last two categories cut across the nation-state\ndimension. Besides comparing the different levels of global-\nization, a PBGI could easily be used to identify and analyze\nthe factors that most influence the degree of globalization of\na person, community, or geographical area. The data of a\nPBGI would be characterized, that is to say, by high mallea-\nbility, and they could therefore be adapted to different needs\nof research and analysis. Finally, as already emphasized in\nregard to the globalization indexes based on states, a PBGI\ncould be used not only for synchronic comparisons but also\nfor diachronic analysis. However, the latter would require\nfurther effort in data collection, with more surveys at regular\nintervals.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, globalization is a multiscalar and multidimen-\nsional process difficult to grasp in its many aspects with a\nsingle measurement instrument. The simultaneous use of\ntools based on different units of analysis could nevertheless\nfurnish a sufficiently rich and comprehensive account of its\nmain dimensions.\nHowever, there are crucial elements of globalization that\ncannot be grasped with tools that use the state, the city, or the\nperson as their unit of analysis. This concerns the systemic\nelements of globalization, which can only be captured if the\nentire planet is used as the unit of analysis. Some of these\nelements, particularly those of an economic kind like the vol-\nume of world trade in proportion to global GDP, can be eas-\nily measured and used, in particular to determine their\nevolution over time. Instead, other elements, consisting of\n\"indivisible\" factors that involve all the inhabitants of the\nEarth, regardless of their spatial locations and social circum-\nstances (Caselli, 2004), appear more difficult if not impossi-\nble to measure. These factors are, for example, the\nsustainability and exploitation of natural resources, or the\nthreat raised by the existence of nuclear weapons. To these\nshould be added the existence of certain procedures, tech-\nniques, and \"expert systems\" now used on a truly global\nscale. These are the procedures, techniques, and \"expert sys-\ntems which make possible the flows of money, products,\nideas, and people that the current globalization indices seek\nto measure. While these elements may not be measurable, it\nshould nevertheless be stressed that a PBGI--and this is a\nfurther advantage of it--could quantify the degree of aware-\nness of their existence among people; in other words, as\nemphasized in the previous section, it could measure that\n\"global consciousness\" which constitutes a key component\nof globalization itself.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nNotes\n1.
