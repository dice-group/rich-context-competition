Discourse analysis indicated that participants\nused two different discourses: a stereotype-affirming defensive discourse, which involved affirming the negative and positive\nstereotypes regarding opiate-dependent and mainstream lifestyles, and a stereotype-refuting defensive discourse, which involved\nrefuting negative opiate-dependent stereotypes while constructing mainstream lifestyles and members negatively. We argue\nthat both discourses fit within a grander discourse concerning normalization with participants' speech functioning to defend\nthem from being negatively stereotyped by making them \"normal\" members of society.\n",

This can push people who are\ndependent on opiates away from mainstream society, as well\nas make recovery more difficult by hampering their reinte-\ngration into the mainstream (e.g., drug offences make it more\ndifficult to become employed). Opiate users may also inter-\nnalize negative stereotypes, losing self-confidence and feel-\ning \"discarded and isolated from mainstream society\"\nreport opiate users' feelings of social exclusion as well as a\nyearning to have a \"normal\" life (Andersson, Nilsson, &\nThe nature of addiction can also push one away from a\nmainstream lifestyle. For example, although economic dis-\nadvantage is not as associated with heroin initiation as the\nstereotype purports (Seddon, 2008), poverty can become a\nserious problem if one becomes dependent, which may then\nlead on to other stigmatized social issues; homelessness,\nphysical/mental illness, and criminality are all more preva-\nlent among opiate-dependent people (Sheard & Tompkins,\n2008). Being part of mainstream society is also about having\nrelationships with others who are part of the mainstream, yet\npeople who become dependent on opiates increasingly with-\ndraw from non-using friends and family (Best, Manning, &\nStrang, 2007). Finally, the opiate-dependent community has\nits own language, shared understandings of needs, and shared\nexperiences that make it more comfortable around like mem-\nbers (Anderson & Levy, 2003), which opiate users may con-\ntrast against the identity and pressures of the mainstream\nWhile there is ample literature concerning how propo-\nnents of mainstream society view opiate-dependent people,\nthere is minimal literature regarding how people who are\ndependent on opiates view or construct their own lifestyles,\nand none that explicitly and purposefully look at how opiate-\ndependent people view or construct a mainstream lifestyle or\nmainstream members.

In Best, Ghufran, Day, Ray,\nand Loaring (2008), the most commonly expressed reason\nfor wanting to be abstinent was becoming \"tired of the life-\nstyle,\" and the strongest cited factor for achieving abstinence\nwas moving away from drug-using friends. Furthermore,\nmainstream services designed to help people become free of\nopiates are often found to be stigmatizing and shaming to\nservice users, effecting continued participation (Gourlay,\nFinally, Nettleton et al. (2011) and Ta\u00efeb, R\u00e9vah-L\u00e9vy, Moro,\nand Baubet (2008) found that people who recover often see\nthemselves as \"damaged\" and seek to establish \"acceptable\"\n(mainstream) identities.\nGiven the present discussion, the aim of this study is to\nexplore how people who are dependent on opiates but are\non a methadone maintenance program talk about and con-\nstruct mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles in reac-\ntion to mainstream and opiate-dependent stereotypes. But\nfirst, it is worth considering participants' positions in the\nstudy; they have taken steps to become free of illegal opi-\nates via methadone maintenance and attending key worker\nmeetings regarding health, employment, housing, and\ncriminal justice. Thus, participants are under explicit sur-\nveillance from a mainstream institution and their help-\nseeking actions implicitly or explicitly represent a shift\ntoward mainstream society.\nMethod\nDesign\nThe study is qualitative, using a \"Think-Aloud\" procedure\nwith some verbal prompts to gain audio data. The order in\nwhich the opiate-dependent and mainstream picture sets\nwere shown was counterbalanced.\nSample\nThis opportunistic sample consisted of six males and four\nfemales, aged 30 to 58 years, all of whom were White British\napart from one male who was Iranian. All participants were\non a methadone program at a harm minimization charity for\ndrug-dependency (where A.M. had volunteered for 9\nmonths), primarily opiates, in outer London. Although no\nparticipants claimed to still be using opiates, this cannot be\nruled out, and some participants said they were using other\nillegal drugs (e.g., marijuana) and/or alcohol. Participant\ndemographics are shown in Table 1. All participants have\nbeen given a pseudonym.\nMeasures\nThe Think-Aloud procedure involved talking as much as\npossible in reaction to the images presented. After the\nparticipant had stopped talking for a significant amount of\ntime (approximately 15 s), the researcher prompted the par-\nticipant to talk about a picture they had not yet discussed or\nif the participant had talked about all of the pictures, then the\nresearcher used a pre-developed prompt or one based on\nwhat they had said during the procedure.\nThe reason for employing the Think-Aloud method was\nto reduce overly thought responses and facilitate a stream of\nconsciousness (Aanstoos, 1983) in the hope of better repli-\ncating more passive, everyday situations where one is on a\nmore reactionary, pre-conscious level.\nProcedure\nParticipants completed the procedure in a small room at a\ndrugs charity they attended almost every day as part of a\nmethadone maintenance program. The researcher explained\nto participants the Think-Aloud procedure and that they\nwould be shown stereotypical images of opiate-dependent\nand mainstream lifestyles, stressing that there were no right\nor wrong answers, as the procedure simply requires talking\nabout what comes to mind when viewing the pictures, and\nthat there are no \"tricks.\" The first set of images was then\nrevealed (which were pinned onto a board at random, apart\nfrom the central image which was always either the picture\nof heroin or the pint of beer depending on the lifestyle that\nwas being represented). After clarifying each picture (e.g.,\nsaying the picture of the squat was not just a run-down house,\netc.), the participant was asked to begin, the microphone was\nswitched on, and the researcher then sat behind them. After\nviewing the first picture set (for 10-15 min), the next image\nboard was set up, the images were explained, and then the\nparticipants were asked to \"think aloud\" about them as well.\nPictures\nThere were eight pictures in each of the two picture sets. One\npicture set was selected to represent a stereotypical main-\nstream lifestyle, and consisted of a family meal, a typical\nTable 1. Participant Demographics.\nInitials Gender Age\nDuration of methadone\nmaintenance Ethnic group\nPhil Male 38 9 months White British\nKate Female 29 9 months White British\nMcLeod and Ogden 3\nsemidetached house, a woman shopping, a pint of beer, com-\nmuters getting on the tube to work, four friends laughing, a\nheterosexual couple, and a credit card. The other picture set\nwas selected to represent a stereotypical opiate-dependent\nlifestyle, and consisted of a block of council estate flats, a\nwoman shoplifting, a mother with two young children (one\nWhite, one mixed race), a heterosexual couple, a homeless\nman with a dog and a cup, a 10 pound note, a large pile of\nbrown heroin, and a squat with some young people sitting.\nThe ideas for images were chosen in collaboration with\npeople who are or have been dependent on opiates. Care was\ntaken not to make the stereotypical opiate-dependent life-\nstyle pictures too extreme to constrict the participants'\nconstructions.\nData Analysis\nThe analysis is placed within the traditions of Potter and\nWetherell's (1987) model of discourse analysis which\nemphasizes the action orientation of talk, considers discourse\nas \"doing,\" and focuses on the ways in which participants\nuse discursive resources and manage issues of interest and\nstake. In addition, the analysis was informed by the princi-\nples of Billig's (1987) rhetorical psychology. Rhetorical psy-\nchology draws on the long-standing history of the study of\nrhetoric and places the ways in which people speak or write\nwithin a notion of argument and ideology and highlights\ntheir cultural context at any given time. Accordingly, using\nboth these perspectives reflects a methodological position\nwhereby the language people use can be read to explore the\npositions they are taking within their given social context.\nResults and Discussion\nOverall, two discourses could be seen within the data relat-\ning either to affirming or refuting stereotypes; these dis-\ncourses fit within a grander discourse concerning\nnormalization. These will be briefly described before being\ndetailed further.\nStereotype-Affirming Defensive Discourse\nOf 10 participants, 4 (Kelly, Sarah, Hamid, and Helen) had\nan overwhelmingly stereotype-affirming defensive dis-\ncourse. On the whole, this involved supporting negative ste-\nreotypes regarding an opiate-dependent lifestyle and positive\nstereotypes regarding a mainstream lifestyle, while keeping\noneself from being labeled a stereotypical \"junkie.\" Given\nparticipants were recruited because they were on a metha-\ndone program, by affirming the negative opiate-dependent\nstereotypes and separating themselves from those stereo-\ntypes, participants placed themselves in a more positive\nlight; by affirming positive mainstream stereotypes partici-\npants could speak of their \"new life\" in a positive way, as\nwell as once again place themselves outside of a negative\nopiate-dependent stereotype by allowing referral to \"nor-\nmal,\" positive aspects of a mainstream lifestyle they kept\nduring the time they used opiates. Thus, one can see how\naffirmation of the stereotypes can serve to defend the partici-\npant's image; however, when \"affirming participants\" were\nunable to separate themselves from a negative stereotype,\ntheir language then often served to make them blameless,\nagain defending their image.\nStereotype-Refuting Defensive Discourse\nOf 10 participants, 3 (Joe, Chris, and Kate) had an overwhelm-\ningly stereotype-refuting defensive discourse. Essentially,\nthis involved challenging the stereotypes and re-organizing\nthe realities presented to make them more equal and over-\nlain. By talking about the mainstream negatively, partici-\npants positioned their current and/or old lifestyles as a more\nequitable alternative, as opposed to a sharp drop in status.\n\"Refuting\" could also challenge the stereotypes by widening\nthe boundaries of the presented conception of mainstream\nand opiate-dependent lifestyles, deconstructing them such\nthat the categories became convoluted. The reconstruction of\nstereotypes did not go so far as to present opiate use posi-\ntively, or whatever lifestyle or activities surrounded opiate\nuse for the particular participant, but talking about it nega-\ntively seemed to be avoided; instead analogies were often\ndrawn, for example, by comparing opiate use with alcohol.\nLike the \"affirming\" discourse, the \"refuting\" discourse can\nbe seen as protecting the participant's image. Again, actions\ncould be constructed as more blameless if \"refuting\" was a\nrestricted option.\nThree participants did not have a mainly \"refuting\" or\n\"affirming\" defensive discourse. Of these, two participants\n(Jack and John) had a more \"affirming\" discourse concern-\ning mainstream stereotypes and more of a \"refuting\" dis-\ncourse concerning opiate-dependent stereotypes, though not\nas strongly as the mainly \"refuting\" participants. The last\nparticipant (Phil) did not say much and the procedure was\nshort as he had a very strong emotional reaction to the \"alco-\nhol\" image; therefore, not enough text is present to make a\njudgment regarding overall discourses.\nNormalizing Defensive Discourse\nThe \"affirming\" and \"refuting\" discourses in essence serve\nthe same defensive function--that of normalization. The\n\"refuting\" discourse worked on more of a group level, chal-\nlenging the construction of normality presented by the ste-\nreotypical images, for example, by blurring the boundaries\nbetween mainstream and opiate-dependent groups and life-\nstyles or by constructing the mainstream negatively, making\nthe lifestyles more equivalent. If we think of the stereotypi-\ncal lifestyles as two separate, hierarchical boxes, the \"refut-\ning\" discourse works by bringing the mainstream box down\nin line with the opiate-dependent box and expanding the\n4 SAGE Open\nborders so they overlap. The \"affirming\" discourse worked\non a more personal level: Instead of challenging the presen-\ntation of group stereotypes, it served to place participants\noutside of the opiate-dependent stereotype, often as an\nexception during the years when they used. If we again think\nof the lifestyles as hierarchical boxes, the \"affirming\" dis-\ncourse largely left the boxes where they were and placed par-\nticipants outside, somewhere in-between. As mentioned,\nmaking oneself blameless was another strategy used by par-\nticipants; this fit into the normalization discourse as it served\nto signal that the participant was not a bad person, but rather\nthat their actions were understandable and normal given their\ncircumstances.\nThe two subdiscourses--stereotype-affirming defensive\ndiscourse and refuting defensive--will now be described in\ngreater depth in relation to the process of normalization.\nStereotype-affirming defensive discourse. As part of the basis of\nan \"affirming\" discourse, a mainstream lifestyle was labeled\nas normal and attractive. Indeed, within an \"affirming\" dis-\ncourse, participants, aside from the topics of alcohol and\nstigmatization, had no criticism of the mainstream and only\ntalked about it in an aspirational way, for example, having\nsteady employment, family meals, shopping for the week\ninstead of a day, and so on:\ncould be anywhere, looks quite nice, hmm I'd like to live there,\nyeah, nice little garden, yeah, quaint . . . family having dinner,\nhmm, yeah, I'd pictured myself happy like this once. (John)\nRight, these are just part of a normal life. (Kelly)\nConsequently, the mainstream was constructed as a posi-\ntive lifestyle, especially in terms of community:\nbut everything's building up nicely, I got a fam- a new baby on\nthe way, and everything seems to be good, you know, I do miss\nfriendship, like I say I'm building up on friends but to be honest,\na lot of my time on my own, cause I isolated myself so much,\nand work, I've lost jobs, you know, really good jobs. (Helen)\nAs exampled in the above quote, the positives of a stereo-\ntypically mainstream lifestyle were often contrasted against\nthe negatives of their own, previous opiate-dependent life-\nstyle--a lifestyle and drug that was constructed entirely\nnegatively:\nthe lifestyle gets you down, everywhere, always `round the\ncorner, and it just takes you places before you know it. (Sarah)\nthis stuff is, is evil and it will make people, the nicest people do\nthe horrible-est things. (Helen)\nIndeed, opiates were portrayed as a drug that \"spirals\" one\n\"out of control\" (Helen). These particular constructions also\nmitigate participants from possible attacks on their character,\ngiven opiates can make the \"nicest people\" commit horrible\nacts and take people places without their knowing. Mitigating\nresponsibility was a feature of \"affirming defensive\" dis-\ncourses in terms of opiates, parental responsibilities, and\ncrime; one participant employed a medical discourse when\ntalking about her opiate dependency:\nyou know I've never met anybody like me, who was taking\ndrugs, everybody was so greedy, \"yeah I'll have that and all this\npills and whatever,\" no I didn't use like that, I just used to stop\nbeing sick. (Kelly)\nHere the participants' drug-use was presented as more of\na necessity, in contrast to the \"greedy\" stereotype (a presen-\ntation that will also be seen in \"affirming\" participants'crim-\ninal activities). Thus, by constructing an opiate-dependent\nlifestyle in a stereotypically negative way, participants can\nboost their image by comparison--\"I wasn't that bad\"--as\nwell as distancing themselves from the \"opiate-dependent\ngroup\" in general. Furthermore, participants talked about\ntheir opiate use in the past tense, positioning them outside of\nthe associated lifestyle.\nNegative stereotyping was not limited to the lifestyle\nor drug however, but extended to opiate users as well.\nThis provided another opportunity to contrast their more\n\"normal\" and \"positive\" opiate-dependency with that of\nthe stereotype:\nmy only saving grace is that I still got my looks and all my teeth\n(laughs), you know, most people they're, they're absolutely, torn\napart by this drug. (Helen)\nthey're stoned, they can't do anything, just get money for drugs,\nI, I had a job for most of the time, umm before I got sick, but that\nwasn't related to umm, to heroin. (Sarah)\n\"Affirming\" participants consistently placed themselves\nin the mainstream prior to drug dependency--further nor-\nmalizing themselves in contrast to the opiate-dependent\nstereotype:\nthese photos represent to me, of what I've had, umm, before I\nheavily got involved with drugs, I had my relationship, I had my\nset of friends, I had my own house, umm, my own business.\n(Hamid)\nIn this quote, we get an indication of how opiates were\nconstructed as a causal factor in negative life outcomes,\nsomething consistently emphasized within an \"affirming\"\ndiscourse.\nIn terms of whether \"affirming\" participants positioned\nthemselves as having more of an \"opiate-dependent\" or\n\"mainstream\" identity in the present, it was variable as par-\nticipants tended to switch depending on the context.\nStill, when it came to an opiate-dependent lifestyle, it was\nspoken of in the past tense. Given participants' history with\nMcLeod and Ogden 5\nopiate use and their affirmation of negative opiate-dependent\nstereotypes, it is not surprising \"affirming\" accounts refer-\nenced shame and guilt at their past:\nI was always ashamed, always feeling guilty because of my kids,\nyou know, and the friends I had left, they knew but, they didn't\nknow, not all of what I was doing. (Sarah)\nEmphasizing guilt helps portray participants as more\nhuman than the opiate-dependent stereotype and helps inoc-\nulate them from potential attacks on their character. Relatedly,\nsome participants also spoke about pretending to be normal\nduring times of opiate use:\nwe were pretending to live a, nice, life, but you know behind\ndoors it was domestic violence, stealing, crack. (Kelly)\nParenthood was quite a prominent theme for each of the\nthree \"affirming\" women, and appeared to represent an\nimportant battleground for protecting their image. For Kelly,\nher keeping and looking after her children was the most\nprominent tool used in distancing herself from the \"junkie\"\nstereotype:\nthey don't see their kids, ok so they might go visit once a year\nbut they've definitely been taking it off whether it's, I don't\nknow I can't imagine how, I mean, I don't know, I don't\nunderstand why you can't look after them though. (Kelly)\nFor Helen, it was a different story:\nreally I should have been thinking about my children and how to\nget them back, I didn't lose them, I handed them to my father,\nvoluntary, I had a break-down, so, but that was due to other\nthings going on. (Helen)\nStealing was another contentious issue. Shoplifting was\nspontaneously admitted to by three of the four participants\nwith a mainly \"affirming\" discourse and one with a mixed\ndiscourse, but none of the three \"refuting\" participants.\nHowever, these admissions fit within the \"affirming defen-\nsive\" discourse by contrasting their stealing--only occa-\nsional, little, and necessary--with the general, over-the-top\nstealing of a typical \"junkie\":\nwell I got charged for both offences and I got put on tag, and\nreally and truly I wasn't a heavy shop lifter, I wasn't someone\nout there earning money for drugs or really or going at it every\nday like some, other guys I know. (Helen)\nAgain, \"affirming\" participants presented themselves as\n\"not-as-bad,\" affirming the stereotype to their advantage.\nThree of the four participants also positioned their stealing\nwithin a more valiant or blameless frame by describing how\nthey had to steal for their kids, even when the money was\ndirectly or indirectly for drugs, and two participants said they\nstole because they needed to eat:\nbut it's usually just because I've been stoned and I need to eat,\nthat's mostly it, but umm, or it's been a couple of times where\nI've nicked a couple of presents `cause it's my daughter's\nbirthday or something, so I can spend the money on drugs but\nI've never nicked solely to buy drugs, never. (Jack)\nMethadone, within the \"affirming\" discourse, was con-\nstructed as a positive intervention, one that would help with\npreventing a return to a previously chaotic life:\nI'm leading that life now because I'm on the methadone. (Kelly)\nAlcohol, on the other hand, was in fact labeled by all but\ntwo participants, across discourses, as a drug as bad as, or\nworse than, opiates:\nin my actual experience of drugs, alcohol is probably about the\nworst drug going, when it comes to how it changes peoples\npersonalities. (John)\nThis negative construction of alcohol, along with the con-\nstruction for mainstream members who drink, enabled par-\nticipants to present their addiction in a more positive light.\nBy bringing alcohol into a similar arena to opiates and mak-\ning their use comparable, participants also de-mythologize\nopiate use and opiate users. The use of alcohol as analogous\nto opiates could be considered a \"refuting\" tactic, but still fit\ninto the \"affirming\" discourse with its higher function of nor-\nmalization. \"Affirming\" accounts may also have benefited\nfrom a flavor of refuting in terms of allowing participants to\nbe more balanced in their highly positive presentation of\nmainstream life, while simultaneously protecting their\nimage.\nThere was one more topic where \"affirming\" discourses\naimed some criticism at the mainstream, and that was related\nto stigmatization:\nto just treat them like a human being, would, would really make\na difference, cause that's what people want, they just want to be\nspoken to normally, treated with respect, unless they've given\nthem a reason, to dislike them. (Helen)\nLike alcohol, commentary regarding stigmatization fit\ninto an \"affirming\" discourse via its higher function of nor-\nmalization--indeed the above quote explicitly relates stig-\nmatization to not being treated normally. Criticism of the\nmainstream was also unproblematic for participants with a\nmainly \"affirming\" discourse because they would talk about\npast stigmatization, keeping them from presently being\nlabeled negatively due to opiate dependency, but also remov-\ning them from the mainstream at the point where it is being\ncriticized--though the \"affirming\" discourse by its nature\n6 SAGE Open\ninvolved the stigmatization of people who are dependent on\nopiates, producing hypocrisy when taken as a whole.\nRefuting defensive.In general, participants with a mainly\n\"refuting\" discourse spoke negatively about mainstream life-\nstyles, with two of the three mainly \"refuting\" participants\nhaving nothing positive to say whatsoever:\nlooks like a typical wage slave environment, everything there is,\nto do with money and, earning it basically, apart from what\nwould appear to be students rather than friends, but all the other\npictures are basically, sheep going to work on the underground,\nwhich I did for years before I wised, wised up, the nice semi-\ndetached house with the nice mortgage on it, which they'll never\nprobably never own. (Chris)\nand what, sitting `round the table not talking, being married and\nnot having, having any fun or what, the couple, look how pissed\nthey look. (Kate)\nHere we can see the construction of mainstream lifestyles\nas money-oriented and monotonous. The contrast to the\n\"affirming\" discourse is stark; whereas \"affirmers\" saw a\n\"happy couple\" (Kelly), \"a good healthy relationship\"\n(Hamid), or a \"lovely family\" (Sarah), \"refuters\" talked\nabout the same pictures negatively. However, mainstream\nlifestyles were at the same time talked about as normal, espe-\ncially by Joe who was less directly critical of mainstream\nlifestyles: Instead of making mainstream lifestyle compo-\nnents more negative, he focused on making opiate-dependent\nand mainstream lifestyle components more equivalent and\ncomparable:\nThat's a normal house, a semi-detached three-bedroom house,\nthat's normal but it's normal living on an estate as well . . . um,\nthem two lovers, are like the lovers in the last one to me, no\ndifference. (Joe)\nAs indicated hereinbefore, the process of normalization in\nthe \"refuting\" discourse, as with its defensive function, is\nmore explicit and direct than the \"affirming\" discourse.\nFurthermore, this normalization extended to the types of\npeople who used opiates as well as opiate use itself, with all\nthree of the \"refuting\" participants using doctors as an\nexample:\nthe ones who come down here (drugs charity) might do but in\nlife you get doctors on drugs, everything don't you, they can\nwrite their own scripts out, you get politicians, everyone on\ndrugs, you just don't see them `cause they got money to go to a\nprivate doctor. (Joe)\nyou'd be amazed at the number of doctors that, secretly addicted\nto opiates, thousands of doctors a year get put away to dry out,\nfrom opiate, addiction, but they're not on the streets, they're not\non that board, their life is quietly brushed under the carpet,\nnobody wants to see it proved that people can live a normal\nlifestyle, and use opiates. (Chris)\nIn addition to illustrating high-status groups using opi-\nates, serving to limit the types of inferences one might make\nfrom knowing someone is/was dependent on opiates, Joe's\nquote has other normalizing--defensive functions--he uses\nan extreme case formulation when stating \"everyone on\ndrugs\" and compares the clients of the drugs charity, who he\nsays might fit the stereotype, to opiate-dependent people one\nwould find in \"life,\" making the stereotypical clients seem\nnot real and minimizing their representation of the group.\nChris's quote is interesting in the way it introduces conspira-\ntorial tones, criticizing the mainstream who \"brush\" normal\nopiate-dependent lives \"under the carpet.\" Furthermore,\narguing a counter position is made more difficult because\nchallenging him would place one with the conspirators or the\nignorant who do not want \"to see it proved that people can\nlive a normal lifestyle, and use opiates.\" Notice here, also,\nthe construction of heroin as a drug which can be controlled,\na drug that does not take everything from you one by one. A\nfinal touch in the quotes was the effect of constructing non-\nstereotypical opiate users as people whom one does not see,\neither because they have money for a private doctor or\nbecause they are deliberately hidden; again, this makes their\npositions more incontestable. This worked especially because\nthe \"refuting\" discourses were bolstered by participants'\nappeals to special in-group knowledge; in other words,\n\"refuting\" discourses, which by their nature involved coun-\ntering common ideas, required participants to make them-\nselves the experts on the topic and the mainstream ignorant\nof reality (this was not a feature of \"affirming\" discourses,\npossibly because \"affirmers\" distanced themselves from an\nopiate-dependent identity):\nthey read a book, go to Cambridge and think they know\nsomething about heroin but unless you've been there, unless\nyou've been there you have no fucking clue, so how do, do they,\nknow me, they don't. (Kate)\nWith the \"refuting\" discourse, participants tended to talk\nabout groups as opposed to individuals, and spoke very little\nabout themselves and the particulars of their own life. As\nsuch, \"refuting\" participants did not talk about guilt, shame,\npersonal crimes, or about what they have lost because of\nopiate dependency. Indeed, for the \"refuting\" discourse, it\nwould not be beneficial to give evidence reinforcing nega-\ntive opiate-dependent stereotypes, and because participants\npresented opiate users as heterogeneous, speaking at a group\nlevel ensures that any negative conjecture is placed within\nthe category of stereotyping and stigmatization. Focus at the\ngroup level also meant \"refuting\" participants did not talk\nabout their \"old selves\" as illegal opiate users, as the \"affirm-\ners\" did--in fact, they rarely talked about their own opiate\nuse at all. Indeed, if the \"refuting\" discourse worked by\nMcLeod and Ogden 7\nchallenging and convoluting the distinction between opiate-\ndependent and mainstream lifestyles, there is less appeal to\na before and after, especially a negative old self and positive\nnew self; the effect of this is to reinforce, or at least not clash\nwith, the construction of people who are opiate dependent as\nnormal people who happen to use opiates. One consequence\nof all this is that the \"refuting\" discourse rarely implicates\nopiates as a causal factor in negative consequences, instead\nattention is deflected:\nthat shoplifter . . . could be stealing for drugs but could just be\nfor some money, most people steal for alcohol. (Kate)\nNot surprisingly then, \"refuting\" participants did not say\nthat the stereotypical opiate-dependent images were a good\nrepresentation of opiate dependency:\nright, in all your pictures, uhh, you're portraying a heroin user as\na down and out, socially maladjusted, emotionally disturbed,\nindividual or individuals, you don't portray, the whole picture of\nheroin addiction or addiction in general. (Chris)\n. . . yeah they represent . . . apart from the one in the middle\n(picture of heroin) they could all be anything, any lifestyle can't\nthey . . . take the drug one out the middle and all the rest could\nbe a normal lifestyle. (Joe)\nHere we see two very different ways to \"refute\" the ste-\nreotypes: Chris describes the pictures as extreme and unrep-\nresentative, while Joe describes them as so normal they could\nbe part of \"any lifestyle.\" Either way the effect is the same,\nwhether a part of a more mainstream or opiate-dependent\nlifestyle, you are normal. Defining normality was particu-\nlarly present in Joe's account, who redefined the boundaries\nof normality several times depending on context, but near the\nend defined each picture as normal (e.g., the squat, shoplift-\ning, heroin use, homelessness), even if he could not describe\nthem as mainstream:\nit's normal, but it's not mainstream . . . yeah only two represent\nthat to me, that was the drugs obviously and the man (homeless\nman), well it represents more alcoholism. (Joe)\n\"Refuting\" participants, by making opiate-dependent\npeople more heterogeneous than the stereotype and widening\nthe catchment area of normality presented in the pictures,\nposition themselves as normal and mainstream, often explic-\nitly, without having to reference specifics of their life:\nhow I live is part of mainstream society as far as I'm concerned,\nI don't try to exile myself from mainstream society, that's\nmainstream society saying I'm not like you. (Chris)\nHowever, when criticizing the mainstream, \"refuting\"\nparticipants, much like \"affirming\" participants, remain\npositioned outside of the mainstream:\nsometimes I feel sorry for them, they got a lot of stress on their\nboat ain't they, got to pay the mortgage and all that. (Joe)\nAs mentioned, the \"refuting\" discourse did not refute so\nmuch that opiates became a positive experience or drug, but\nit was normalized. Furthermore, negative talk about opiates,\nrife in \"affirming\" accounts, was not talked about much;\nwhen opiates were talked about negatively, it was more\ninnocuous than \"affirming\" accounts (e.g., \"physically\naddictive\" (Chris) as opposed to \"evil\" (Helen)) and was\nmost often counterbalanced with an analogy:\nheroin has never really been proved, to kill except in overdoes\nquantities, which is the same in everything, water will kill you in\noverdoes quantities. (Chris)\nMethadone, however, was spoken of very negatively,\nagain contrasting the \"affirming\" discourse:\nmethadone's worse, it's addictive, it gets you down, has side\neffects, withdrawals, umm, and, and the only reason that we get\nit is `cause they won't give us gear to get us off it. (Kate)\nPlacing responsibility of addiction on factors other than\noneself was less of a feature in \"refuting\" discourses, in\npart because the discourse was at a less personal, group\nlevel. Therefore, responsibility, when laid down, was often\nput at the feet of mainstream society as opposed to indi-\nviduals such as partners or family, as in the \"affirming\"\naccounts:\npeople have been shoveled onto these council estates, society\nproduces these problems, you shovel a whole bunch of people\nwho are all addicted to the same substance in one little same\narea. (Chris)\nthey make it illegal, yeah, illegal, and then arrest us `cause we\nneed it, then when people try to get a job they can't, have to steal\nyeah, tell people to get better then say sorry, you have to come\nhere every day at three. (Kate)\nHypocrisy was almost inevitable when refuting the ste-\nreotypes and it was perhaps the most difficult in these\nmoments where mainstream society's part in opiate depen-\ndency was being described. For example, Chris portrayed a\npicture of people living on council estates as \"all\" addicted to\nopiates, and Kate portrayed heroin as a drug that is needed\nand leads to stealing, in sharp contrast to their previous state-\nments. Kate's comments regarding having to get her metha-\ndone script every day during working hours represents\nanother layer to the negativity directed toward methadone as\na solution to opiate dependency. The quotes, in fact, can be\ntaken as commentary on stigmatization, something that the\n\"affirming\" and \"refuting\" discourses had in common along\nwith the rhetoric regarding the status of alcohol--in fact,\nsometimes these concepts combined:\n8 SAGE Open\na heroin's addict a heroin's addict umm, it's acceptable to be an\nalcoholic but it's not acceptable to be a heroin addict, but umm,\nI, both cost the same, how many heroin addicts would we have\nand how many alcohol addicts? Remove the stigma which one's\nmore dangerous? (Chris)\nConclusion\nThe present study therefore aimed to explore how people\nwho are currently dependent on opiates conceptualize\nmainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles using a Think-\nAloud procedure. From the analysis, two discourses could\nbe seen within the data relating either to affirming or refut-\ning stereotypes which can be understood with a grander\ndiscourse concerning normalization. In particular, some\nparticipants illustrated an affirmation of mainstream and\nopiate-dependent stereotypes, which appeared to defend\nthe participant's notion of self, making them blameless and\ndefending their image. In contrast, some showed a refuting\ndefensive discourse which involved re-organizing and chal-\nlenging the realities presented by the stereotypes. These\n\"affirming\" and \"refuting\" discourses in essence served the\nsame defensive function--that of normalization, however,\nwhile the \"refuting\" discourse worked on more of a group\nlevel, for example, by blurring the boundaries between\nmainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles, the \"affirm-\ning\" discourse worked on a more personal level by placing\nthe individual outside of the opiate-dependent stereotype.\nMostly, then, data indicate that people with an opiate-\ndependency have a need to be seen as, and treated as, an\nindividual, three-dimensional human and not as a grossly\nnegative stereotype. This need could be triggered whenever\nmainstream versus opiate-dependent identities or stereotypes\nbecome salient. These results have implications for the ways\nin which this population could be approached and illustrate\npossible barriers and facilitators for uptake and involvement\nin rehabilitation. First, in terms of how this population could\nbe approached, the results from the present study indicate\nthat what these clients actually say may not be a direct reflec-\ntion of what they think but more an illustration of a presenta-\ntion of their self which is defending against existing\nstereotypes. When deciding to engage with a drug program,\nthese identities may become particularly salient as they are\nbeing confronted with the norms of mainstream society.\nTherefore, the ways in which clients in the drug service relate\ntheir life circumstances and how they would like to move\nforward may not present true and concrete versions of reality,\nbut rather their constructions may be borne out of need to be\nseen as a normal individual. Accordingly, those working\nwith this client group should be aware of this need to be\ndefensive and attempt to offer a supportive, empathetic, and\nnon-judgmental relationship to help lower such defenses so\nthat more productive work can take place.\nSecond, in terms of potential barriers to the uptake and\nengagement with support, the results also highlight some\nimplications for practice. In particular, the \"refuting\" dis-\ncourse involved minimizing the negative consequences of\nopiate dependency, while emphasizing the negative conse-\nquences of mainstream life; specifically, methadone was\nlabeled negatively and opiates were constructed as a more\ncontrollable drug. This construction may make it more likely\nthat clients slip back into an opiate-dependent lifestyle, or\neven less likely to enter treatment in the first place. Similarly,\nthe \"refuting\" \"slave wage\" construction of mainstream real-\nity may signify that attaining secure employment is less\nlikely. Therefore, those working with this client group need\nto be prepared to challenge this \"refuting\" discourse, while\nrecognizing the need for normalization. However, this will\nnot be an easy task given the level of functions that this dis-\ncourse serves.\nThird, it is possible that the \"affirming\" discourse may\nsignify positive outcomes in terms of abstinence and integra-\ntion into mainstream society with an associated better quality\nof life. Therefore, it may be beneficial to vocalize agreement\nwith mainstream stereotypes for the purpose of interacting\nwith mainstream members and institutions as it does not\ncause tension or upset the status quo and will be less likely to\nbe interpreted as defensive.\nThere are several limitations to this study which need to\nbe considered. First, participants were on a methadone main-\ntenance program and so the discourses produced, and their\nhypothesized consequences, may not generalize to those who\nare not seeking treatment or indeed to other people on a\nmethadone maintenance program, given the sample size.\nAlso, the potential consequences of the discourses are just\nthat--hypothesized. Future research, preferably quantitative,\nis needed to establish whether there are any significant con-\nsequences and to suggest helpful solutions.\nTo conclude, the results from the present study indicate\nthat participants dependent on opiates relate to stereotypes of\nmainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles in ways that nor-\nmalize their past and current positions in society.Accordingly,\nwhether they refute or affirm the stereotypes presented, they\ndo so in ways to protect and defend against their notions of\nselves. Most treatment programs for opiate dependency offer\na solution to any client's behavior by encouraging a shift\naway from the opiate lifestyle toward a more mainstream\nway of living. The results from the present study not only\nprovide insights into how those with opiate dependency con-\nceptualize these two lifestyles but also highlight potential\nbarriers and facilitators that need to be addressed if this shift\nin behavior is to occur. In particular, the results highlight a\nneed to understand the defensive nature of the rhetoric used\nand that while affirming discourses may facilitate recovery\nrefuting discourses could act as a barrier.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nMcLeod and Ogden 9\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAanstoos, C.
