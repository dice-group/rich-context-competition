In fully adjusted linear\nregression models, sex, age, race, and BMI were independent\ndeterminants of higher UA.\nDiscussion: This study defines serum UA reference ranges\nfor adolescents. It also reveals some intriguing relationships\nbetween UA and demographic and clinical characteristics that\nwarrant further studies to examine the pathophysiological role\nof UA in various disease processes.\nIn humans and higher primates, uric acid (UA) is the final\noxidation product of purine metabolism and is excreted in\nurine. Elevated serum UA levels can result either exogenously\nfrom increased intake of purine-rich foods, or endogenously\nfrom increased production as seen in certain malignancies\nand inborn errors of metabolism; elevated serum UA levels\ncan also result from decreased renal clearance. It is becoming\napparent that UA homeostasis and its relationship with health\nand disease is complex. Elevated serum UA is associated with\nhypertension (HTN), as well as with diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, endothelial dysfunction, obesity, metabolic syndrome,\nnephrolithiasis, intellectual disabilities, and all-cause mortality\n(1\u00ad8). On the other hand, some recent investigations provide\nevidence that UA may be beneficial as an antioxidant/free-\n\nradical scavenger in certain patient groups (9\u00ad11).\nThe association between elevated serum UA and HTN in\nboth adults and children is well-described (1,12). HTN is one\nof the most prevalent diseases in the Western world and track-\ning studies suggest that children and adolescents with elevated\nblood pressure (BP) are more likely to be hypertensive adults\nand develop metabolic syndrome (13,14). Despite multiple\ninvestigations into the relationship between UA and HTN in\nchildren, little is known about the normal range of serum UA\nlevels in children and adolescents. Previous studies on UA\nlevels in children were either based on small sample size or\npresented only mean UA values (15\u00ad18). Further, given that\nprevious studies were not representative of the US population,\nit is possible that they do not broadly represent recent trends\nand changes in diet and demographics.\nSimilarly, associations between serum UA levels and socio-\neconomic status, diet, and other demographic, clinical, and\nlaboratoryparametershavenotbeenestablishedinadolescents.\nTherefore, the aims of this study were to (i) examine serum UA\ndistributions in a large, nationally representative cohort of US\nadolescents; (ii) examine the relationships between UA values\nand dietary and demographic variables; (iii) examine the rela-\ntionships between UA values and BP and other cardiovascular\nrisk factors; and (iv) examine the determinants of elevated UA\nlevels in a multivariate regression model.\nResults\nRelationship Between Serum UA and Demographics\nin these analyses (Figure 1).

In a more recent single-center study using a different\nassay, UA levels were found to vary with age and sex, the ranges\nand male participants, respectively (19).

In\ndeveloping nations, children living in poverty generally expe-\nrience true protein\u00adenergy malnutrition, whereas in devel-\noped nations poverty predisposes to obesity and micronutrient\nmalnourishment (22). Although poverty and protein\u00adenergy\nmalnutrition have been shown to lead to lower serum UA lev-\nels (23), no relationship between socioeconomic status and UA\nhas previously been described in developed nations.\nOur data show the highest UA levels to be associated with the\nhighest percentage of children living in poverty, whereas UA\nlevels in the range 4.3\u00ad5.1mg/dl was associated with the lowest\npercentage of poverty. Also, our data reveal a J-shaped rela-\ntionship between UA and the intake of all dietary components\nexcept fiber. Previous investigations regarding the association\nbetween dietary intake and UA showed increased serum UA\nlevels with higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (24),\ncalories (25), and protein (25,26), and lower intake of vitamin\nC (27). A study using NHANES data in adults revealed that a\nhigher intake of fiber correlated with lower serum UA levels\n(28), which is consistent with our findings. However, a small,\nprospective study in Norway showed no effect of increased\nfiber intake on serum UA levels in adults (29). The observed\nrelationships suggest that dietary factors do relate to UA levels\nbut do not solely explain higher or lower UA levels. Dietary\nfactors did not remain as an independent determinant of UA\nlevels in the final regression model (Table 5).\nThe prevalence of HTN in our cohort was 2.9%, which is\nclose to the value of 3.7% previously reported from older\nNHANES data by Din-Dzietham et al. (30,31), but lower than\nthe value of 4.5% reported by Sorof et al. in a population of\nchildren in a major metropolitan city (31). These differences\nare probably related to data from differing time periods as\nregards the former study, and differences in study population\n(including higher BMI) as regards the latter study.\nResults of recent studies support the possible role of UA as\na mediator of high BP (1,2). In this study, we classified the\ncohort's BP values on the basis of age, height, and gender as\nnormotensive, prehypertensive, and hypertensive. A total\nof 269 adolescents had an abnormal BP classification, which\nwas significantly associated with the UA quartile trend, P <\n0.001. Our findings are consistent with those of Gruskin and\ncolleagues, who compared adolescents having essential HTN\nto age-matched, healthy controls with normal BP and found\nthat those with HTN higher serum UA levels (32). Feig and\nJohnson observed that the mean serum UA level in children\nwith \"white-coat HTN\" was 3.6 \u00b1 0.7mg/dl; in those with sec-\nin children with primary HTN UA was significantly elevated\nTo our knowledge, there have been no previous large pedi-\natric studies examining the relationship between UA and\nmicroalbuminuria. The inverse relationship observed in this\ncohort is possibly influenced by the inclusion of a poorly nour-\nished group with lower UA levels (reflected by dietary intake\ndata and higher C-reactive protein). Also, it is important to\nstress that the albuminuria levels in this cohort were below\nthose that are considered to be clinically relevant in adult pop-\nulations; the significance of microalbuminuria in children has\nnot yet been elucidated.\nOur finding that the highest C-reactive protein levels are\nin the lowest UA quartile group is intriguing and may reflect\nthe presence of a possibly poorly nourished group in the low-\nest quartile. Of note, few previous studies demonstrated a\n\"U-shaped\" or a J-shaped relationship between various cardio-\nvascular outcomes and UA levels (33,34).\nGiven the lack of universally accepted upper normal lim-\nits for UA in adolescents, we built three statistical models to\nexamine two different cutoff points considered as represent-\ning elevated UA (95%, and UA levels in the upper weighted\nquartile of UA (data not shown)), and a third model to exam-\nine predictors of UA level considered as a continuous variable.\nThe determinants of UA were similar in the three models, with\ngender, race, BMI z-score, and age representing independent\ndeterminants of UA level. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, BP classi-\nfication, urinary ACR, dietary factors, and poverty\u00adincome\nratio did not remain as independent determinants in the final\nmodel. It is possible that BP did not remain in the final model\nbecause of the relatively small number of adolescents with\nelevated BP in the cohort. An alternative possibility is that it\ndid not remain in the final model because of its significant but\nweak correlation with BMI z-score.\nOur study had some limitations. Although we were able to\nexamine the relationship between UA levels and other vari-\nables, the nature of the study design did not allow for exam-\nination of causality. Another limitation of the study was the\nQuartile of uric acid\nP for\ntrend\nPresented as mean \u00b1 SD.Weighted uric acid quartiles estimated by quantile regression.

Despite these limitations, our\nstudy, which used data from the largest nationally representa-\ntive sample of adolescents for the purpose of defining refer-\nence ranges for serum UA, was also the first to examine the\nrelationship between UA levels and dietary factors, poverty,\nand BP classification. It is also worth noting that the NHANES\ndatabase involves the use of the same assay to measure UA lev-\nels, thereby eliminating differences in measurement methods\nfrequently encountered in multicenter studies. It also used a\nstandardized BP classification based on the fourth report on\nthe diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of high BP in children\nand adolescents (35). Also, conducting the study in a healthy,\nyoung cohort minimized confounding by comorbidities, which\nis a major weakness of existing smaller studies.\nConclusions\nThis work defines the frequency distribution of serum UA\nlevels in a sample that is representative of the US adolescent\npopulation, and examines the relationship between UA levels\nand multiple demographic and biochemical characteristics as\nwell as known cardiovascular risk determinants such as BP and\ndiet. Sex, age, race, and BMI z-score were found to be inde-\npendent determinants of higher UA levels. Further prospective\nstudies are needed to address the relationship between UA lev-\nels and cardiovascular morbidities in pediatric patients.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nNHANES is an ongoing nationally representative cross-sectional\nsurvey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population and uses a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage probability design. The survey is per-\nformed by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for\nDiseases Control and Prevention, and the results are released in 2-y\nincrements. Survey participants underwent standardized interviews,\nphysical examinations, and laboratory testing in their homes and at a\nmobile examination center (MEC).\nSerum UA measurements were obtained for all individuals 12\ncents 12\u00ad19 y of age, valid measures for serum UA were available\nfor n = 1,912. In our study, analysis was limited to data relating to\nadolescents 13\u00ad19 y of age for whom serum UA measurements and\ncomplete data on other variables of interest were available (n = 1,725).\nBecause dietary intake information is not reported in the public-access\nand dietary intake was limited to adolescents from NHANES 2005\u00ad\nHealth Statistics Institutional Review Board. All participants 18 y of\nage provided informed consent; for those <18 y of age, parents/guard-\nians provided informed consent.\nStudy Variables\nThe demographic variables included in our study were age, gender,\nand self-reported race/ethnicity (categorized as non-Hispanic black,\nnon-Hispanic white, Mexican American, and other). Poverty\u00adincome\nratio is the ratio of a family's income to the poverty threshold as\ndefined by the US Census Bureau. In NHANES, a poverty\u00adincome\nratio 1 was defined as being below the poverty threshold.\nDetailed information on dietary intake was collected from the\ntories were used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and bev-\nerages consumed during the 24-h period before the interview and to\nestimate intake of energy, nutrients, and other food components from\nthose foods and beverages. All NHANES participants were eligible for\ntwo 24-h dietary recall interviews. The first dietary recall interview\nwas collected in person during the MEC. The second interview was\nby telephone 3\u00ad10 d after the MEC. Average dietary intake was used\nin the analysis.\nPhysical measures were obtained in the MEC in accordance with\nstandardized protocol (36). Using a mercury sphygmomanometer,\nthree measurements of systolic and diastolic BP were obtained for\neach participant. The participants were classified as having HTN if\nthis mean value was  the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height,\nand as having pre-HTN if the mean BP was  the 90th percen-\ntile but < the 95th percentile (35). The BP index (mean BP divided\nby the 95th percentile of BP for age, gender, and height) was cal-\nculated for each participant. Each participant's height and weight\nwere measured. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby height in meters squared. BMI z-scores were calculated based\non 2000 Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention growth\ncharts (37). Laboratory procedures are described in detail in the\nNHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual\n(38) Serum UA levels were measured using a colorimetric method.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using latex-\nenhanced nephelometry. Serum cholesterol levels were measured\non the Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).\nUrinary albumin levels were measured using a solid-phase fluores-\ncent immunoassay. Urinary creatinine levels were measured using\nthe Jaffe rate reaction with a CX3 analyzer (Beckman ASTRA,\nBrea, CA). The urinary ACR was calculated as urinary albumin\nvalue divided by urinary creatinine value. An ACR 30 was used\nto define albuminuria. Serum creatinine was measured by means\nof the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction. Because differences were\ncompared with a \"gold standard,\" a correction factor was applied\nto adjust for errors in measurement. Glomerular filtration rate was\nestimated using the Schwartz formula (39).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using Stata (SE 10.1; Stata, College Station,\nTX). Standard errors for all estimates were obtained using the Taylor-\nlinearized variance estimation. Four-y sample weights were used to\naccount for the complex sampling design of NHANES, including\nunequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and nonresponse. A\nP value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nMean values for continuous variables and proportions for categori-\ncal variables were estimated on the basis of weighted UA quartiles.\nStatistical significance of linear trends across patient characteristics\nwas determined by linear and logistic regression for continuous and\nTable 5.

Weighted percentiles of the distri-\nbution of UA were estimated using quantile regression, utilizing ana-\nlytical weights. Weighted linear regression models (least squares) were\nutilized to examine the associations between UA and demographic,\nsocioeconomic, and dietary risk factors.\nThe relationship between BP and UA was first examined using the\nfrequency distribution of UA levels based on BP classification. Next,\nthe relationship between BP and weighted UA quartiles and the rela-\ntionship between BP index and UA levels were examined.\nNo financial assistance was received to support this study.\nREferences\n1.
