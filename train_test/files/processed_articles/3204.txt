This paper\nrepresents the authors' personal opinions and does not necessarily reflect the position or official policy of\nthe Deutsche Bundesbank.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1 shows three important developments that took place in the US in the last part of\nthe 20th century. First, the skill premium, which was already 50% in the 1960s, increased\nby another 30 percentage points by the end of the century. Second, college enrollment\nincreased by about ten percentage points, from 52% to 63%. Last, and probably least\nwell-known, the male wage-hours correlation turned from negative to positive. Thus, in\nthe 1960s poorer households worked, on average, more than richer households. Since the\n1980s however, rich households have been working more than poor households. In this\npaper, we show why the third finding is important for better understanding the first two.\nUsing a standard life-cycle model with an education decision and endogenous labor\nsupply, we show that skill-biased technological progress leads to an increase in the skill\npremium and the supply of skilled labor which can take two forms: on the extensive\nmargin, more households find it worthwhile to go to college; on the intensive margin, the\nreward for supplying labor increases more for college-educated households. This induces\nthem to work more than low-skilled households, leading to the increase in the wage-hours\ncorrelation. We also show that ignoring the intensive margin leads to biased estimates of\nthe extensive margin.\nWhile the main contribution of our paper is quantitative in nature, we also provide\ndetailed explanations of our quantitative results by studying a simplified model analyti-\ncally and by performing several counterfactual experiments. We calibrate our quantitative\nthe wage-hours correlation in 1967. Based on these inputs and the exogenous evolution\nof skill-biased technological progress, the model is able to replicate simultaneously the\nincrease in the enrollment rate and the trend in the wage-hours correlation. Enrollment\nshow an increase from 52.0% to 63.3%. The wage-hours correlation over the same period\nWe explore the mechanism behind these results qualitatively and document the im-\nportance of the working hours decisions. Three competing effects influence education\ndecisions. First, there is the well-known skill premium effect. Skill-biased technological\nprogress increases the wage premium for educated workers and thus the incentive to get\nan education. Second, there is a relative hours effect. People who have a medium learning\nability but choose not to go to college in a setting where working hours are identical across\nskill groups may prefer to go to college when working hours can be freely chosen. The\npossibility of working more hours indeed increases lifetime earnings differentials, making\neducation more attractive. Third, there is a general equilibrium effect operating through\nan extensive and intensive margin. If the freedom to choose working hours increases ed-\nucation, the supply of skilled workers will be larger and, in addition, college graduates\nmight want to increase the number of hours they work. Both effects increase the supply\nof skilled labor, which depresses the skill premium and reduces education incentives.\nIn a simplified version of the model with exogenous factor price variations, we an-\nalytically document the relative hours effect. If the skill premium increases over time,\nhigh-skilled households will increase their working hours relative to low-skilled house-\nholds. This effect is consistent with the increase in the wage-hours correlation, empirically\nexhibited in Panel C of Figure 1.\n(a) Skill premium\nTime\n(b) College enrollment\nTime\n(c) Wage-hours correlation\nTime\nPanel A shows the increase in the skill premium, defined as the wage of college graduates\nrelative to the wage of those without a college degree. Panel B shows the variation in\nthe college enrollment rate, defined as the percentage of high-school-educated persons\nenrolling in college. Panel C shows the change in the log(wage)-log(hours) correlation.\nA quantitative analysis of counterfactual scenarios, where the hours decision is switched\noff or factor prices are exogenous, allows us to gauge the importance of the three com-\npeting effects: skill premium effect, relative hours effect and a general equilibrium effect.\nWe find that all three effects quantitatively matter and that the third effect dominates.\nIgnoring hours decisions would, for instance, lead to an overestimation of the increase in\ncollege enrollment by 3 percentage points, while ignoring general equilibrium responses\nleads to a skill premium gap of 15 to 30 percentage points.\nAs a last step, we take the model to analyse working time regulations. In particular,\nwe show that restricting the maximum time someone can work to 48 hours per week, as is\ndone by the EU Working Time Directive, hardly changes the enrollment rate. However,\nthe skill premium is around four percent higher in this case, implying that this regulation\nincreases income inequality between the high-skilled and low-skilled. The main reason\nis that college graduates reduce their hours by more than high school graduates, which\nimplies a lower relative supply of skilled labor than under laissez-faire conditions and thus\nan increased skill premium.\nIf the goal of the regulation is to support low-income households, this working time\nregulation then leads to the counterproductive outcome of higher wage inequality. A\nwelfare analysis comes to similar conclusions: all households lose out from the regulation,\nexcept the high-skilled who are old at the time of the policy introduction. Welfare losses\nfor young generations can, on the other hand, be sizable, at 0.7% of lifetime equivalent\nconsumption. On the declining part of the hump-shaped life-cycle productivity profile,\neducated older workers work fewer hours anyway and thus are not affected by the working\ntime constraint, and thus only benefit from the wage premium increase. Motivated by\nthis finding and the lower stringency of current working time regulations for high-skilled\nworkers, we also consider a working time policy restricted to low-skilled workers and\nfind partially reversed outcomes. Wage inequality now is slightly reduced since the high-\nskilled increase their labor supply while some low-skilled cannot increase theirs due to\nthe regulation. This policy also leads, on average, to lower welfare. However, the welfare\nlosses now fall mainly on the high-skilled, and the only households which enjoy welfare\ngains are old low-skilled households. Thus, restrictions on hours for low-skilled lead to\nsmaller welfare losses and to better distributional outcomes than restrictions on everyone.\nRelated Literature\nOur paper relates to different strands in the literature on growth, education and wage\ninequality. To a large extent, wage inequality is driven by skill-biased technical change,\nwhich has tilted demand and supply in the labor market in favor of high-skilled house-\nholds (see, for example, Katz and Murphy, 1992). Despite the increase in education levels,\ndemand for high-skilled labor never weakened: the race (Goldin and Katz, 2009) between\ntechnological change and education has been won by the former, leading to significant in-\ncreases in inequality.1 Our paper builds on the literature that explains the increase in the\nskill premium through skill-biased technological progress, specifically capital-skill comple-\nmentarity, as in Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante (2000), and the reduction in\nthe price of capital equipment, as in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997).\nOur paper is closely related to He (2012) and Restuccia and Vandenbroucke (2013).\nThe model by He (2012) shows that the main determinant of the increase in the skill\npremium is skill-biased technological progress. Demographics, from which we abstract,\nplays only a minor role. Restuccia and Vandenbroucke (2013), studying a longer time\nperiod, are able to replicate the increase in college education between 1940 and 1980 but\nthese models, labor supply is exogenous. Thus, they cannot investigate either wage-hours\ncorrelation variations or the influence of freely chosen hours on education.\nThree quantitative studies that include endogenous labor supply are Heathcote, Storeslet-\n(2015) estimate a structural partial equilibrium model to explain education, marriage,\ndivorce, and labor market decisions jointly. While their main focus is somewhat different,\ntheir model can speak to the link between hours and education. However, their model\npredicts a counterfactually large drop in male hours and underestimates their college en-\nrollment. Our model shows that these two results are intimately related. Heathcote,\nStoresletten, and Violante (2010) use a model with endogenous education and hours de-\ncisions to investigate the impact of wage inequality on gender, hours and consumption\ninequality, successfully accounting for the variation (but not the level) in the wage-hours\nother hand, succeed in matching both variations and levels of the wage-hours correlation\nbetween 1968 and 2006 but need fluctuations in cohort-specific heterogeneous preferences\nfor labor to obtain this result.\nMarimon and Zilibotti (2000) study the effect of working time regulation on employ-\nment and unemployment levels in a matching framework, which is something we abstract\nfrom. They find that small reductions in hours worked can lead to small increases in\nemployment, while larger reductions lead to a fall in employment due to the diminished\nincentives to post vacancies. Their analysis, however, does not consider the impact on\neducation or its influence on labor market outcomes. Yurdagul (2017) studies the ef-\nfects of working time regulation in a model with production complementarities and where\nhouseholds have to to decide between becoming workers or entrepreneurs. He finds that\nhours restriction do not lead to a fall in the number of workers but to a fall in the number\nof entrepreneurs. The model however abstracts from education decisions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3\nprovides analytical results for a simplified version of the model. Section 4 describes the\ncalibration and the quantitative results and explains the importance of endogenous labor\nsupply. Section 5 investigates the impact of workweek regulations. Section 6 concludes.\nWe build a neoclassical, deterministic overlapping-generations model with skill-biased\ntechnical change as well as endogenous hours and education decisions in general equi-\nlibrium. Following Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997) and Krusell, Ohanian,\nRios-Rull, and Violante (2000), we model skill-biased technical change as the result of\ncapital-skill complementarity and variations in the price of capital equipment.2 As in\nHeathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2010), education decisions depend on wage differ-\n2The literature sometimes calls this investment-specific technological change (ISTC).\nentials and ex-ante heterogenous learning ability.3\nPopulation We abstract from population growth so that the size of the economy is\nconstant. Households become economically active after high school when they start their\nadult life, at which point we say that they are born. At that point in time a household\ndecides whether or not to go to college. If he does not attend college, he starts to work\nas an unskilled worker immediately. If he enrolls in college, he will graduate four years\nlater and will then start to work as a skilled worker. All households work until they die,\nJ periods after birth, leaving neither debt nor bequests. As there is no bequest motive,\nall households are born with no assets.\nPreferences Lifetime utility from consumption and leisure of a household born in time\nv is given by\nJ\n, lv,v+j-1\nwhere  is the discount factor, cv,t\ndenotes consumption of the household at time t and\nlv,t\nits labor supply. We assume that the instantaneous utility function is separable and\ngiven by\nu(c, l)  ln(c) - \nwhere is the inverse of the (Frish) elasticity of labor supply. These preferences have\nthe well-known implication that income and substitution effects cancel out for permanent\nwage changes. However, we analyze the transition path of a sequence of skill-biased\ntechnology shocks which lead to a new steady-state. The relative strength of income and\nsubstitution effects changes during this transition, leading to changes in hours worked.\nEducation Households are born with different learning abilities. They draw an ability\ni  [0; 1] from a uniform distribution at birth. Education comes at a utility cost (i),\ncapturing psychological costs of learning in reduced form and at the cost of foregone\nwages during college. The education disutility cost function declines with ability,  < 0:\nhouseholds born with high ability i find education easy and are more likely to choose\ncollege education. We denote college education by si\n= c and high school education by\nsi\n= h.\nProductivity and budget constraints Wage differences arise not only from skill\ndifferences and changes in the skill premium but also from age efficiency profiles. We\nassume separate exogenous time-invariant profiles s\nj\nfor each education level s. This\nimplies the following budget constraint\nav,v+j\n+ cv,v+j-1\n) av,v+j-1\n) ws\ns\nj\n3The resulting model is similar to He (2012) except that our model does not feature demographics\nbut includes endogenous labor supply.\nwhere\n= 0 otherwise.\nThus, the indicator variable captures the fact that households that go to college forgo\nlabor income while studying. Factor prices are time-varying but, as aggregate variables,\nhave no age subscript. For simplicity we ignore the pecuniary costs of education.4 Despite\nthis, households who go to college have to borrow to finance early-life consumption since\nthey have no income.5\nHouseholds maximization problem Conditional on the education choice s, the max-\nimization problem of a household born at time v, of age j and alive in period v + j - 1\ncan be expressed as\nV s\n) = max\nu (cv,v+j-1\n, lv,v+j-1\n) + V s\nv,v+j\n(av,v+j\nand is subject to the budget constraint (3). In the first period of their life (at j = 1),\nhouseholds decide whether to go to college or whether to remain unskilled by comparing\nthe corresponding value functions. The resulting choice is given by\ns =\nc if V c\n(0) - (i)  V h\nh if V c\n(0) - (i) < V h\nLabor market and production A representative firm uses capital K, skilled labor S\nand unskilled labor U to produce a single good, paying factors their marginal product.\nSkilled and unskilled labor are imperfect substitutes because of capital-skill complemen-\ntarity.

The condition  <  implies capital-skill complementar-\nity, the elasticity of substitution between skilled labor and capital 1/ (1 - ) being smaller\nthan the elasticity of substitution between unskilled labor and the capital-skilled labor\naggregate 1/ (1 - ).\nProduction capital is derived from households' assets\nAt\n=\ns{c,h}\n(As\nt\n) \ns{c,h}\nt\nNs\nv,t\nas\nv,t\n4We also considered cases with tuition costs. Since these models had similar implications, we do not\nreport them here.

We then continue with an analysis of the role of\nhours in a simplified version of the model, which exhibits an intertemporal relative labor\nsupply effect, at the heart of our study.\n2.3 Equilibrium properties\nChange of variable We perform a permanent change of variable, borrowed from Green-\nwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997), which simplifies the analysis: ~\n/qt\n. Then\nthe production function (6) and the capital law of motion (8) are equivalent to\nYt\n= \u00b5U\nt\n+ (1 - \u00b5)  Bt\n~\nKt\n\n+ (1 - ) S\nt\n,\n~\n ~\nKt\n+ Xt\n,\nwith additional notation Bt\nand ~\n/qt\n. After the change of variable,\nthe capital law of motion has the familiar neoclassical growth expression. Assets market\nclearing ~\nKt\n= At\nthen implies goods market clearing (10), a property which simplifies the\nnumerical implementation of the model.\nOptimality conditions First order conditions, applying to all life-cycle periods of the\nhousehold, are given by:\ncs\ncs\nv,t\n) ls\nv,t\n= (1 - I,t\n)\n\nws\nt\ns\nt-\ncs\nv,t\n.\nThe first condition is the Euler equation. The only role of the term (1 - I,t\n) in the second\ncondition is convenience in notation: when households obtain education (I,t\n= 1), they\ndo not work.\nFactor prices As factors are paid their marginal products, the net interest rate and\nwage rates are equal to:\nrt\n=  (1 - \u00b5) B\nt\nHt\n Bt\n~\nKt\n\n+ (1 - ) S\nt\n~\nt\n- ~\n\nwc\nt\n Bt\n~\nKt\n\n+ (1 - ) S\nt\nt\nwh\nt\n= \u00b5Ht\nt\nwhere Ht\n= \u00b5U\nt\n+ (1 - \u00b5)  Bt\n~\nKt\n\n+ (1 - ) S\nt\n.\nSkill premium From (11), the skill premium follows:\nwc\nt\nwh\nt\n=\n\u00b5\n\nBt\n~\nKt\nSt\n\nSt\nUt\n.\nThe expression illustrates the impact of skill-biased technical change, or skilled labor\ndemand, and skilled labor supply on the skill premium. Since \u00b5,   (0, 1) and  <  < 1,\na larger supply of skilled labor St\ndepresses the skill premium, ceteris paribus. Increases\nin the demand for skilled labor follow from increases in Bt\n, which represents an\nimprovement in investment technology and leads to skill-biased technical change. When it\nhappens the skill premium increases, ceteris paribus. These impacts on the skill premium\nare familiar and expected.\nCompetitive equilibrium A competitive equilibrium over the time periods\n+ T} is a sequence\ns,t\n, cv,t\n, lv,t\n, wc\nt\n, wh\nt\n, rt\n, Ns\nv,t\n| v, t  T\nsuch that education decisions s,t\nsolve (5), consumption and leisure decisions (cv,t\n, lv,t\n)\nsolve the Bellman equations (4) subject to budget constraints (3), factor prices (wc\nt\n, wh\nt\n, rt\n)\nare paid their marginal products as summarized in conditions (11), factor markets clears\nas expressed in (7) and (9) and the good market clears as expressed in (10).\n3 Wage inequality and hours: analytical results\nWe use a simplified version of the model to analyse the impact of wage inequality on the\ndispersion of working hours, exhibiting a relative intertemporal labor supply effect.\nWe consider a partial equilibrium version of the model with a constant interest rate\nand an exogenous skill premium variation given by\nwc\nt\n) wh\nt\nfor a given path of the skill premium t\n 0. We also assume that education does not take\ntime and an identical age efficiency profile for unskilled and skilled workers (h\nt-\n= c\nt-\nfor all t  ).\nFirst we express optimality conditions for the simplified model and derive its impli-\ncations. Consider two households born at the same time but making different education\nchoices. The first order conditions for labor can be rewritten as cs\nv\n\n(ls\nt\n)\nws\nt\ns\nt-\n.\nComparing the consumption decisions of the two households,\ncc\nv\n(t)\nch\nv\n(t)\n=\n\nwc\nt\nc\nt-\n(lc\nv\n(t))\n\nwh\nt\nh\nt-\n(lh\nv\n(t))\n=\nlh\nv\n(t)\nlc\nv\n(t)\nwc\nt\nwh\nt\n=\nlh\nv\n(t)\nlc\nv\n(t)\n) .\nFrom the Euler equation it follows that consumption grows at the same speed for the\ntwo households. Hence the quantity expressed above is constant. Lemma 1 consolidates\noptimality conditions and sums up the additional derivations:\nLemma 1. (Optimality conditions): For households born at time v, optimal labor\nsupply and consumption decisions are characterized by the following:\nls\nv\n(t)=\nws\nt\ns\nt-\ncs\nv\n(t)\ncs\nv\ncs\nv\n(t)\n) \nlh\nv\n(t)\nlc\nv\n(t)\n)=\ncc\nv\n(t)\nch\nv\n(t)\n=constant.\nAssume that the skill premium  increases over time. The last relationship says that\nlabor supply lh of the low-educated will increase more slowly than labor supply lc of the\nhigh-educated, a relative intertemporal labor supply effect. Intuitively, it makes more sense\nfor high-educated households to work more than low-educated households in the future\nrather than in the present, when they earn an even higher wage. If the premium increases\nfor a long enough period, the high-educated will eventually work more, consistent with\nthe wage-hours correlation shown in Figure 1.\nWe provide formal derivations of this intuitive discussion in Lemmas 2 and 3. The first\nshows that labor supply is the same for households when the skill premium is constant\nover their lifetime. It also shows that high-educated households work less at the start of\ntheir life, and more at the end, if the skill premium never decreases and increases at least\nonce over their lifetime.\nLemma 2. (Relative hours): Compare an educated household with an uneducated\nhousehold born at the same time v. Then...\n(a) if the skill premium is constant over their lifetime ( \n = 0), households work the same\n(and consume according to their productivity):\nlc\nv\n(t) = lh\nv\n(t) cc\nv\n(t) = (1 + v\n) ch\nt\n(t) t  [v, v + J]\n(b) if the skill premium never decreases and increases once or more over their lifetime\n( \n > 0 at least once), educated households initially work less than uneducated\nhouseholds, but more before they die: there exists t1\nsuch that\nlc\nv\n(t) < lh\nv\n(t) v  t < t1\nlc\nv\n(t) > lh\nv\n t  v + J.\nFurther, lc\nv\n(t)/lh\nv\n(t) is constant over intervals where the skill premium is constant.\nProof: See Appendix A.1.\nThe converse to case (b) of the lemma also holds: if the skill premium never increases\nand decreases at least once of the lifetime of the two households, educated households\ninitially work more than uneducated households, and then less. The intuition for case (a)\nof the lemma is the following: in absence of transitory shocks to wages, substitution and\nincome effects cancel out so labor supply is identical, and lifetime income and consumption\ndifferences between educated and uneducated households equal the productivity difference\n(skill premium). The intuition for case (b) is based on the relative intertemporal labor\nsupply effect and case (a): when the premium is constant, households work an equal\nnumber of hours; when the premium increases, educated households work more when the\npremium is higher, which is towards the end of their life.\nLemma 3 makes a formal connection between relative labor supply and the wage-hours\ncorrelation.\nLemma 3. (Wage-hours correlation): Consider an economy where the skill premium\nis constant except it increases once (t\nfor t < t1\nand t\n).\nThen the wage-hours correlation coefficient is first negative and then positive (as long as\ngenerations which experienced the skill premium increase are alive):\ncorr wi\nt\n, li\nt\n- J  t < t1\n; corr wi\nt\n, li\nt\n+ J.\nProof: See Appendix A.1.\nThe intuition for the result comes from Lemma 2: when the skill premium is lower,\neducated households, who have a higher wage, work initially less than uneducated house-\nholds, making the wage-hours correlation negative; before they retire, they work more,\nchanging the sign of the correlation. The converse of the result also holds: if the skill\npremium is constant except it for a one-time decrease, the wage-hours correlation is first\npositive and then negative.\nThe proof can neither be easily extended to the correlation between hours and efficient\nwages, which are observed in practice, nor can it be extended to the case where the skill\npremium increases more than once since multiple generations are involved. Yet in reality\nthe skill premium has varied continuously. Therefore, we analyse the effect of multiple\nchanges in the skill premium in a quantitative model in Section 4. However, Lemma 3\nstill formally articulates a mechanism where increases in the skill premium contribute to\nthe increase (and change of sign) in (efficient) wage-hours correlations, as witnessed in the\nUS towards the end of the 20th century and documented by Costa (2000) and Heathcote,\n4 Quantitative results\nIn the previous section, we have shown analytically how an increase in the skill premium\ncan lead to (i) an increase in labor supply of high-skilled households and (ii) an increase\nin the wage-hours correlation. In this section, we analyse whether these outcomes also\nmatter quantitatively and whether the observed increase in the skill premium since the\nSecond World War can explain (i) the increase in college enrollment rates and (ii) the\nincrease in the wage-hours correlation. Our calibration strategy is to use data for the\nbeginning of our sample period (1967), estimates of the price of capital between 1967 and\n2000, and wage data for 2000 to match the change in the skill premium perfectly. The\nresulting changes in college enrollment rates and wage-hours correlation are equilibrium\noutcomes and used to evaluate the model's performance. We first discuss our calibration\nin Section 4.1. Then, we show our baseline results in Section 4.2 before discussing the\nrole of endogenous labor supply in Section 4.3.\nOur calibration strategy has two components. One group of parameters, shown in Panel\nA of Table 1, is based on previous research. Another group of parameters, shown in Panel\nB of Table 1, is calibrated to match crucial stylized facts.6\nSince households enter in the model only when joining the labor market or starting\neducation (age 18) and exit after they stop working (age 65), we follow He (2012) and set\nlifetime duration J to 48. Age efficiency profiles for educated c\nj\nand uneducated workers\nh\nj\nare derived from average wages in the second half of the century, as reported in Figure\n8 in He (2012). One period corresponds to one year, so we set the time discount factor\n to 0.96.7 There is a debate in the literature for the value of labor supply elasticities:\nwe follow Shimer (2009) and choose a middle value of 1. We thus set such that the\nThe price of capital equipment {qt\ntimates of the quality-adjusted prices for total investment from Cummins and Violante\n(2002).

These are the scale factor for labor supply disutility , the share factors for\nunskilled labor and the capital-skilled labor composite in the production function \u00b5 and\n in addition to  and .\nAs mentioned before, we calibrate these five parameters to match four moments in the\ntheir data counterparts and the model outcomes. Overall, the model fits the data well.\nThe initial wage-hours correlation is negative, implying that the high-skilled worked less\nhours than the low-skilled. The college enrollment rate is 52% in the model and in the\n6Further details on the calibration and the solution algorithm can be found in Appendix A.2.\n7The resulting capital-output ratio K/Y is 3.14 in the initial steady-state.\n8Following Heathcote, Perri, and Violante (2010) and He (2012), we classify workers with a college\ndegree as skilled and workers with a high school degree and no college as unskilled. This leaves those who\nTable 1: Exogenous model parameters\nParameter Value Source\nA: Exogenous parameters\nJ Lifetime duration 48 Real average working life\ns\nj\nAge efficiency profiles ...

Using estimates of the price of capital equipment between\n1967 and 2000, we generate time series for the skill premium, college enrollment decisions\nand the wage-hours correlation in the United States and compare them with empirical\nobservations. The results are shown in Figure 2, where the model predictions are shown\nattended college but did not obtain a degree. We classify half of the workers with some college but no\ncollege degree as skilled and the other half as unskilled.

Panel C shows the change in the log(wage)-log(hours) correlation.\nwith dashed lines and the data with solid lines.\nThe calibration strategy implies that the model outcomes for enrollment and wage-\nhours correlation are equal to the data in 1967 and for the skill premium in 1967 and\n2000. Enrollment and the wage-hours correlation in 2000, however, are model outcomes,\nas is the time-path between 1967 and 2000 of all variables, including the skill premium.\nPanel A in Figure 2 shows indeed that the time-path of the skill premium is close to\nthe empirical trend, except for the initial 5 years drop which the model fails to reproduce.\nBehind this trend for the skill premium is the continuous fall in the relative price of capital\nequipment which benefits high-skilled workers. Since the relative price does not show a\ndrop in the first few years, the model fails to reproduce the initial drop observed in the\nPanel B shows not only that the model generates an increase in college enrollment\nendogenously but also that the magnitude is very close to the data. The enrollment rate\n9He (2012) shows that demographics can explain this drop to a significant degree.\nwas not targeted, the model generates a very similar result. Similar to the skill premium,\nthe time-path in the model is smoother and, in particular, misses the initial drop. The\nreason for this is again that the evolution of the relative price of capital equipment is\nfairly smooth, generating smooth adjustments in the premium and enrollment.\nPanel C shows that the model is also able to reproduce the trend in the wage-hours\nin 2000. This switch in sign is the second important moment that the model replicates\nsuccessfully. Note, however that the time-path in the model is somewhat off. In the\nmodel, it takes more time until high-skilled households increase their hours sufficiently\nfor the wage-hours correlation to become positive. The main reason follows from the\ninitial gap between model and data on education, discussed previously with respect to\nPanel B. Because the model initially overestimates education decisions, the skilled labor\nforce is on average younger in the model than in the data. Given the hump-shaped\nproductivity profile, young workers provide less labor. These two features explain the\nslow initial increase in hours by high-skilled households and the resulting slow increase in\nthe wage-hours correlation.\n4.3 The role of the choice of hours\nIn this subsection we look at the role of the choice of hours for the enrollment decision and\nthe wage-hours correlation. There are three competing effects on the enrollment decision:\na skilled premium effect, a relative hours effect and a general equilibrium effect. The first\ntwo operate at the individual level and the last one is a feedback effect.\nFirst, an increase in the skill premium increases the return on costly education invest-\nments and thus strengthens education incentives. Second, suppose hours and the skill\npremium were exogenously fixed. If the marginal person whose disutility of education is\nslightly too large to go to college were able to work longer hours, he would be able to gen-\nerate a larger income and therefore might decide to go to college. Thus, for a given skill\npremium, the possibility to work more hours increases the incentive to obtain an educa-\ntion. Third, the skill premium will, however, not remain constant in general equilibrium.\nThe supply of skilled labor will increase at the intensive and extensive margin. Those\nwith a low disutility of education who would have enrolled in college anyway now choose\nto work more hours when the skill premium increases, which, in general equilibrium,\ndepresses the skill premium.\nThe interplay of these three effects is also evident in the increase in the wage-hours cor-\nrelation and shows the importance of studying the skill premium, wage-hours correlation\nand enrollment jointly.\nWe evaluate the contribution of the three effects with the following experiments, the\nresults of which are shown in Figure 3. The experiments are carried out in three steps.\nThe first step will illustrate the skill premium effect. The first and second steps will jointly\nillustrate the importance of endogenous labor supply and the relative hours effect. The\nsecond and third steps will jointly illustrate the influence of the third channel: general\nequilibrium effects.\nAs a first step, we calibrate a model version with constant hours.10 The results are\n10Details can be found in Appendix A.3.\nshown in Panels A(i)-(iii). Since we still target the skill premium in 2000, the evolution\nof the skill premium in Panel A(i) is very similar to the benchmark case. As before the\nenrollment rate is endogenous. Panel A(ii) shows that it increases to 67%, three percentage\npoints higher than in the data and the benchmark model. Panels A(i) and A(ii) illustrate\nthe skill premium effect, the increase in education incentives as the wage differential\nbetween high-skilled and low-skilled workers becomes larger over time. Since hours are\nconstant, everyone works the same number of hours and the wage-hours correlation in\nPanel A(iii) is zero.\nThe second step is shown in Panels B(i)-(iii), where we perform the following partial\nequilibrium experiment: We keep all parameters and the evolution of factor prices as in the\nmodel with constant hours but allow households to decide on their hours and education.\nThe skill premium in B(i) is thus identical to the one in A(i). Panel B(ii) shows that in this\nscenario, the enrollment rate is significantly higher than before in all periods. For example,\nthe enrollment rate with endogenous hours is three percentage points higher than under\nexogenous hours in 2000. The response at the extensive margin is strong. The experiment\nshows that the relative intertemporal labor supply effect, exhibited analytically in Section\n3, matters quantitatively: ceteris paribus (under partial equilibrium with an exogenous\nskill premium), education incentives are increased if educated households can boost the\nreturn on education by working more hours. This also implies that ignoring endogenous\nlabor supply responses can lead to a bias in college enrollment of up to three percentage\npoints. Moreover, there is a significant response at the intensive margin. Those households\nwho obtain an education work on average 12% more than those who remain unskilled\n(unreported in Figure 3). The effect at the intensive margin is behind the increase in\nthe wage-hours correlation shown in B(iii). Initially, the wage hours correlation is (too)\nnegative. But over time, as the rise in the skill premium induces high-skilled to increase\ntheir labor supply, the correlation becomes slightly positive.\nIn the third step, we continue the previous, partial equilibrium experiment but now\nimpose market clearing. In partial equilibrium, the increase in the skill premium led to\npositive effects on skilled labor supply at the intensive and at the extensive margin. One\ncan thus clearly expect that the skill premium will fall in the general equilibrium setting.\nSince a smaller increase in the skill premium implies lower incentives to go to college,\nthe supply of skilled agents will fall, as will their hours worked, which will dampen the\ngeneral equilibrium effect. The results are shown in Panels C(i)-(iii).11\nPanel C(i) shows that the general equilibrium effect on the skill premium is large.\nThe premium falls in all periods between 15 and 30 percentage points. It is for example\n55% instead of 85% in 2000. The drop in the skill premium takes place despite the fact\nthat the smaller skill premium leads to an endogenous fall in the enrollment rate of about\nthree percentage points in all periods, which can be seen in Panel C(ii). The effect on\nthe intensive margin is also important for skilled agents. The average hours worked of\nthe high-skilled increase only by about 7% instead of 12% (unreported). The correlation\nbetween wages and hours in Panel C(iii) nevertheless shows a similar pattern.\nOverall, these results demonstrate the importance of analyzing the skill premium, the\nextensive margin (enrollment) and the intensive margin (hours) of skilled labor supply\n11Models in Figure 2 and Panel C of Figure 3 are identical but differ in their calibration. The baseline\nresults appear in Figure 2 because the calibration approach in Panel C of Figure 3 serves decomposition\npurposes only.\nA: Constant hours calibration\n(i) Skill premium\nTime\n(ii) College enrollment\nTime\n(iii) Wage-hours cor.\nTime\nB: Endogenous hours but exogenous skill premium\n(i) Skill premium\nTime\n(ii) College enrollment\nTime\n(iii) Wage-hours cor.\nTime\nC: Endogenous hours and endogenous skill premium\n(i) Skill premium\nTime\n(ii) College enrollment\nTime\n(iii) Wage-hours cor.\nTime\nData\nModel\nFigure 3: Inspecting the mechanism.\nRow A shows the main results for the constant hours calibration.

The joint analysis is important not only to understand the evolution of the wage-\nhours correlation but also to understand the quantitative effects of skill-biased technologi-\ncal progress. By assuming constant hours, one ignores the incentive for the high-skilled to\nincrease their labor supply which, through a general equilibrium effect, also counteracts\nthe effects of skill-biased progress on the skill premium. This implies that, for a given\nchange in technology, the effect on wage inequality is overstated. As Panel C(i) shows,\nthis bias can be as high as 30 percentage points.\n5 Regulating hours\nIn this section, we analyse the effect of regulating the maximum number of hours someone\ncan work over a given time period. Working time regulation has been existing since the\n19th century at least and has generally capped the length of the work week. However,\neven today, there are significant differences across countries. Since 1993, the EU Working\nTime Directive has, however, introduced a degree of harmonization between countries of\nthe European Union (for details, see Marimon and Zilibotti, 2000). One element of this\nregulation is to limit the maximum hours a worker can work to 48 hours per week. The\njustification for this type of regulation is usually health and safety issues, about which our\nmodel has nothing to say. However, since our model features imperfect substitutability\nbetween different educational groups, it allows us to analyze the macroeconomic side\neffects of this regulation on education and inequality. In Section 5.1, we analyze the\neffects of imposing a maximum number of hours on every worker in the economy. We will\nsee that this regulation hurts most generations in our model economy, with particularly\nstrong negative effects on the low-skilled. Therefore in Section 5.2, we analyze the effects\nof imposing a maximum number of hours on one skill group only.\n5.1 Uniform limit on hours worked\nThe only addition we need to make to the model is the following restriction to equation\nwhere we set lmax = 0.41 to reflect the EU regulation.12 All other parameters are left at\ntheir baseline values. In Figure 4, we show the path of key variables had the US adopted\nOverall, the results of the simulations are similar to the baseline model. The en-\nrollment rate is hardly affected, while the college premium with regulated hours is, on\naverage, 1.5 percentage points higher. The reason for limited effects is that both groups,\nthe college educated and high school graduates, are affected similarly: in the baseline,\nthe maximum hours of college-educated workers is around 0.465 and the maximum for\nmultiplied by the EU regulation maximum (48.0) divided by the average workweek duration (43.4) in\n13Introducing the regulation at a later date would affect the quantitative results somewhat, but the\npattern remains the same.\nA: Skill premium\nTime\nRegulated hours\nB: College enrollment\nTime\nBaseline\nRegulated hours\nC: Ex ante welfare\nTime\nImplementation\nD: Group-specific welfare\nTime\nImplementation\nHigh school\nCollege\nFigure 4: Consequences of hours regulation for education and wages.\nPanel A shows the increase in the skill premium, which is defined as the wage of college\ngraduates relative to the wage of those without a college degree.

The reason is that the intertemporal labor supply effect, discussed in the previous\nsession, is dampened by the workweek regulation. Without the regulation, working more\nhours would allow the high-skilled to reap additional benefits from education, thereby\nincreasing education incentives. With the regulation, the educated cannot increase their\nhours as much, which lowers their education incentives.\nThis policy benefits the relatively well-off college-educated at the expense of the rela-\ntively poor high school graduates. This can also be seen in Panels C and D. Both show\nthe welfare changes expressed as the compensating variation in consumption that each\ngeneration would need to be indifferent between living in the unregulated or the regulated\neconomy. Positive numbers represent welfare gains and negative number welfare losses.\nPanel C shows that the ex ante welfare effects differ across generations, ranging from 0.1%\nHowever, the ex ante perspective in Panel C masks some bigger effects for each skill\ngroup. Panel D shows the effects after the uncertainty about educational disutility is\nrevealed for both groups, high school graduates and college graduates. All generations\nwithout a college degree lose out. For college graduates, there is an inter-generational\nwelfare reversal. Essentially, those who are old before the regulation is enacted win out\nand those who are born later lose out. The reason is the interaction of the introduction of\nthe regulation and the life-cycle of productivity of the high-skilled. Since productivity is\nhump-shaped over the life-cycle and declines for older workers, these workers never choose\nlong hours, with or without regulation. Therefore the regulation does not affect them.\nThe younger cohorts, however, would like to work more at the peak of their productivity\nbut now are restricted. This negative effect from the restriction on hours dominates the\npositive effect from the higher skill premium for all those who enter the labor market\nafter 1968. From an ex ante perspective, there are a few cohorts who benefit from the\nregulation. However, for most generations, the restriction on hours worked leads to a\nloss in welfare. The analysis thus identifies some counterproductive outcomes of policies\nsuch as the EU's Working Time Directive: if the goal is to help the uneducated and poor\nworkers by setting a limit on working hours, the goal is partially missed, as the policy\nhurts these workers more than the well-educated workers in terms of income inequality,\nbecause of general equilibrium effects.\n5.2 Limit on hours worked of low-skilled only\nIn this section, we analyse the effect of limiting the hours choice of the low-skilled only.\nThere are two reasons for doing so. One is that regulation for the high-skilled is in many\ncountries somewhat less stringent than for low-skilled agents (Messenger, 2006). The\nother is that we have seen that restricting the hours choice of the high-skilled hampers\nthe general equilibrium effect of lowering the skill premium, to the detriment of the\nlow-skilled. Therefore, we analyse a regulation limiting the hours choice of high-school\ngraduates lh, while leaving the one of college graduates lc unconstrained,\nThe results are shown in Figure 5. Panel A shows that now there is a small reduction\nin the skill premium compared to the unregulated case, opposite the impact of hours\nrestriction on all workers seen in the previous section. Enrollment is again hardly affected,\nas in the case of hours restriction on all workers. The same mechanism operates. Now, it is\nonly the unskilled who have to lower their labor supply, while the high-skilled are allowed\nto choose their labor supply freely. The resulting reduction in the supply of unskilled\nlabor leads to the decrease in the skill premium.\nThe welfare changes in Panels C and D are now significantly smaller than before. The\nmaximum fall in the consumption equivalent in Panel C of Figure 5 is about seven times\nlower than in Panel C of Figure 4. Moreover, as anticipated, the distributional effects are\nnow significantly different. Whereas before, it was all generations of high-school graduates\nwho lost out from the regulation, it is now college graduates who unambiguously lose out,\nbecause the skill premium is reduced. The fall of the skill premium also represents a\nrelative gain for some unskilled workers: those who are relatively old when the hours\nrestriction is introduced do not want to work many hours since their productivity is\nnot as high as during their prime age, and thus benefit from the regulation. However,\nthose high-school graduates who are born after 1973 also suffer welfare losses from the\nregulation, because the constraint on working hours operates and reduces their earnings\npotential.\n6 Concluding remarks\nEducation is an important investment decision for individuals: it has a larger impact on\nlifetime earnings inequality than shocks during the working life (Huggett, Ventura, and\nYaron, 2011) and provides better insurance than savings or working hours (Heathcote,\nStoresletten, and Violante, 2010). Recent decades have seen a large increase in the skill\npremium and a steady increase in college enrollment. Understanding changes in education\ndecisions and the forces behind these changes is crucial for a number of policy questions.\nFor example, more high-skilled workers imply a larger tax base for income taxes; the\nquality of the labor force affects firms' investment decisions; and the political demand for\nredistribution depends on the distribution of pre-tax income.\nThe increase in the skill premium is a key factor behind changes in education, but it\nis not the only one. We show that relative variations in working hours matter, too. A\nstandard neoclassical model with endogenous education and labor supply decisions where\ncapital-skill complementarity and changes in the prices of capital equipment generate skill\npremium variations is able to simultaneously explain the increase in US male college en-\nrollment and the change in the wage-hours correlation from negative to positive between\n1967 and 2000. Since households are forward-looking, education and labor supply deci-\nsions are taken jointly. Education incentives are supported not only by an increase in the\nwage premium, but also by the possibility for educated workers to reap additional benefits\nby working longer hours. However, the longer working hours of high-skilled households\nwill endogenously depress the skill premium. We show that the former effect is dominated\nby the latter: identical hours lead to an underestimate of the enrollment rate by about\nthree percentage points, while exogenous factor prices lead to a fall in the skill premium\nby fifteen to thirty percentage points.\nA: Skill premium\nTime\nRegulated hours\nB: College enrollment\nTime\nBaseline\nRegulated hours\nC: Ex ante welfare\nTime\nImplementation\nD: Group-specific welfare\nTime\nImplementation\nHigh school\nCollege\nFigure 5: Consequences of low-skilled hours regulation for education and wages.\nPanel A shows the increase in the skill premium, which is defined as the wage of college\ngraduates relative to the wage of those without a college degree. Panel B shows the\nincrease in college enrollment. Panels C and D show the welfare effects of the regulation\nexpressed in consumption equivalence units. Panel C shows the change in expected welfare\nfor each age cohort before agents know their utility cost of education. Panel D shows\nwelfare changes for the two education groups separately.\nThe effects of taxation and pensions on education incentives are relatively well under-\nstood. In settings with inelastic labor supply for instance, He and Liu (2008) show that\nprogressive taxation reduces education incentives and Casarico and Devillanova (2008)\nshow that redistributive pay-as-you-go pension systems have a similarly negative effect.\nInvestigating whether these results hold with endogenous labor supply is left for future\nresearch.\nWe show that another policy instrument, restrictions on working hours, leads to par-\ntially counterproductive outcomes: if the goal is to promote the welfare of the most\nvulnerable segment of the working population, imposing a general restriction on working\nhours actually benefits old educated workers, while all uneducated and young educated\nworkers lose out from the introduction of the regulation, because such a policy has very\nlittle effect on enrollment but leads to a higher skill premium. This is not the case if\nonly the working hours for the low-skilled are limited. In that case, all generations of\ncollege-educated workers lose out but the early generations of high-school graduates ac-\ntually gain. Nevertheless, from an ex ante welfare perspective, almost all generations\nlose out. We leave endogenizing the regulation within a political economy framework for\nfuture research. However, our finding that some groups sometimes gain at the expense of\nothers points to the importance of taking imperfect substitutability of labor into account\nwhen analyzing labor regulations.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D. and D.

Thus, when the skill premium t\nis\nconstant (or increases) over periods of the life of the households, the ratio lc\nt\n/lh\nt\nis constant\n(or increases).\nQED\nProof (Lemma 3): The sample correlation between two variables X and Y is negative\n(or positive) if and only if the regression line for the sample points on an XY-graph has\na negative (or positive) slope. Here, we set wages on the X axis and hours on the Y\naxis. The proof is made by induction on the number of generations which experience the\nchange in skill premium.\nFor one generation, the regression line at a given time period goes through two points\nexactly, (wc\nt\n, lc\nt\n) and wh\nt\n, lh\nt\n.

For generation i = n,\n(wc,n\nt\n, lc,n\nt\n) and wh,n\nt\n, lh,n\nt\nhave to satisfy two conditions. First, wages within education\nclasses are the same, so (wc,n\nt\n, lc,n\nt\n) lies on the same vertical line as all other generations\npoints wc,i\nt\n, lc,i\nt\nand wh,n\nt\n, lh,n\nt\nlies on the same vertical line as all other generations\npoints wh,i\nt\n, lh,i\nt\n, for i  {1, ...n-1}. Second, by lemma 2, lc,n\nt\n< lh,n\nt\n. In other words, the\nregression line for generation i = n is negatively sloped. The regression line for generations\ni  {1, ...n} is a combination of the regression line for generations i  {1, ...n - 1} and\nthe regression line for generation i = n, both of which are negatively sloped and have\ntheir mass points on the same two vertical lines. Thus the regression line for generations\ni  {1, ...n} is also negatively sloped.\nThe same induction argument is applied for time periods t  t1\n: the regression line\nfor generations i  {1, ...n} is positively sloped.\nGenerations which do not experience the skill premium increase still influence the\nwage-hours correlation over the time horizon considered. The generation-specific regres-\nsion lines for these generations are horizontal. Since their mass points (along the wage\naxis) lie on the same vertical lines, the all-generations regression line remains negative\nand positive after t1\n, as long as one or more generation which experienced the\nskill premium increase is alive.\nA.2 Computational details\nWe provide a generic algorithm for computing a steady state, in a normalized system\nwhere the change of variable from K to ~\nK has been performed (see Section 2.3). The\nextension to a transition path version is standard.\nAlgorithm: Steady-state computation with normalized system\n1. Make guesses on capital stock ~\nK and labor supply stocks S and U\n2. Derive factor prices r, wc and wh with (11)\n3. Compute value functions and household decision policy functions by solving back-\nward the maximization system (4) subject to (3)\n4. Using the fact that newborns start their life with zero assets, compute the path for\nsimulation assets av,t\n, consumption cv,t\n, education sv,v\nand labor supply lv,t\n5. Compute the resulting aggregate assets A with (7) and, from asset market clearing,\nderive simulated capital stock ~\nK = A\n6. Compute the resulting supplies of skilled labor S and unskilled labor U from (9)\n7. Compare guesses ~\nK, S, U with simulated outcomes ~\nK , S , U ; stop if they are close;\notherwise update guesses and return to step 2.\nRemarks: Further implementation details.\nTo solve the model numerically, initial and final steady states are needed. The economy\nis not in a steady state in 1967. In particular, the stock of skilled workers is not the same\nas the flow of new skilled workers entering the labor market: the college graduate rate\nin 1967 is larger than the fraction of the workforce which is college-educated (since the\ncollege graduation as increased steadily between 1950 and 1967). A similar comment holds\nfor 2000. For a correct implementation of our model, we therefore choose a counterfactual\ninitial steady state in 1900 and final steady state in 2070. With these choices, the model\nrepresentations in 1967 and in 2000 are not steady states. Parameters are chosen so that\nthe economic equilibrium in the model is close to the data in 1967. After 1967 and until\n2000, the economic equilibrium are defined by the model dynamics, without the additional\nconstraints brought about by steady states.\nFor implementation of counterfactual initial and final steady states, additional param-\neters are needed. The parameters are chosen so that they have no impact on equilibrium\nbetween 1967 and 2000. Data on the price of capital equipment, the driver of change in\nthe model, ends in 2000. We assume that this price continues to grow for 20 years after\nremains constant for one generation, namely until 2070. To avoid jumps in household\ndecisions around 1967, we also assume that the price of equipment starts to grow 25 years\nA.3 Calibration with constant hours\nWe calibrate the model with exogenous labor supply to the same moments as the baseline\nmodel except for hours worked and the wage-hours correlation, which are not defined in\na model with exogenous and constant hours. The exogenous parameters remain the same\nas for the baseline model (see Table 1) and are not reported. Thus, we set the , , and\n\u00b5 to match the college enrollment rate in 1967, the skill premium in 1967, and the skill\nTable 3: Calibrated model parameters with constant hours\nParameter Value\n Mean in dist. education disutility -0.700\n Variance in dist. education disutility 3.10\n\u00b5 Share for unskilled labor in production 0.417\n14Since we have only three targets, we leave the second parameter of the production function  at its\nbaseline value."
