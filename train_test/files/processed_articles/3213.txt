When triggered in highly\nlevered states, going-concern conversion reduces risk-taking incentives, unlike conver-\nsion at default by traditional bail-inable debt. Interestingly, contingent capital (CoCo)\nmay be less risky than bail-inable debt as its lower priority is compensated by a lower\ninduced risk. The main beneficial effect on risk incentives comes from reduced leverage\nupon conversion, while any equity dilution has the opposite effect. This is in contrast\nto traditional convertible debt, since CoCo bondholders have a short option position.\nAs a result, principal write-down CoCo debt is most desirable for risk preventive pur-\nposes, although the effect may be tempered by a higher yield. The risk reduction effect\nof CoCo debt depends critically on the informativeness of the trigger. As it should\nensure deleveraging in all states with high risk incentives, it is always inferior to pure\nequity.\n",

Contingent convertible capital (CoCos) is a debt instrument that\nconverts into equity or is partially or fully written off when bank's core tier 1 capital falls\nbelow some trigger level. A key question among regulators is whether CoCos attenuate\nincentives for risk-taking in the same way as equity. While there are specific requirements for\nCoCos to qualify as an extra buffer, banks are still free to choose the conversion mechanism:\nconversion to equity or principal write-down. Our paper studies whether CoCos reduce banks'\nwillingness to take risk and also which conversion mechanism is most effective in curbing risk-\ntaking.\nContribution\nThe paper focuses on how contractual features of CoCos affect a bank's incentives to take\ninefficient risk by choosing a speculative asset purely for risk-shifting reasons. We assume\nthat CoCos are issued to substitute a part of deposits when an increase in bank equity is\nnot an option. In the model, conversion of CoCos has a preventive function as it occurs in a\ntimely fashion when risk choices can still be influenced. We show that going-concern CoCos\nreduce risk-taking as they force deleveraging.\nResults\nA key result is that CoCos are better at reducing ex ante risk than bail-in debt. Going-\nconcern conversion in high leverage states reduces risk-shifting, while bail-in debt only re-\nallocates losses at default among debtholders. The main reason for the endogenous risk\nreduction comes from the leverage decrease upon conversion. Unlike principal write-down\nCoCos, converted-to-equity CoCos result in the dilution of current equity holders upon a\ngoing concern conversion. Such equity dilution does not reduce inefficient risk-taking but\nactually increases it. Our results suggest that principal write-down CoCos should be pre-\nferred, since they ensure no equity dilution which has a positive effect on risk incentives.\nThe effectiveness of CoCos in reducing risk-taking critically depends on the precision of the\ntrigger. Equity is equivalent to the conversion at all times and therefore induces safer choices.\nThis suggests that CoCos are not a substitute for equity, and in fact inferior in their ability\nto reduce risk.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nW\u00a8\nahrend f\u00a8\nur die Kernkapitalquote gem\u00a8\na\u00df Basel III Stammaktien erforderlich sind, k\u00a8\nonnen\nauf die zus\u00a8\natzlichen Kapitalpuffer Wandelschuldverschreibungen angerechnet werden.

In the ensuing\ncrisis, banks could not absorb losses, leading to credit market disruption and spillovers\nto the real economy. The regulatory response has focused on higher core bank equity to\nabsorb losses and protect depositors. While Basel III core capital ratios require common\nequity, additional buffers (required for instance for SIFIs, systematically important financial\ninstitutions) may include bail-inable and convertible debt. Issuance of bank convertible debt\nhas risen rapidly to over 200 billion dollar in the last five years.\nOriginally proposed by Flannery (2002) and discussed extensively by Kashyap, Rajan,\nand Stein (2008), contingent convertible capital (henceforth CoCo debt) is a debt claim that\nconverts into equity or is partially written off when bank capital falls below some trigger\nlevel. Contingent deleveraging creates a buffer that reduces financial distress and deposit\ninsurance losses (Pennacchi, 2011; Pennacchi, Vermaelen, and Wolff, 2014; Albul, Jaffee,\nand Tchistyi, 2013; McDonald, 2013). A key question is whether CoCo debt shares with\ncommon equity the effect of increasing \"skin in the game\", attenuating incentives for risk-\ntaking. The view is endorsed by many authors (Madan and Schoutens, 2011; Glasserman\nBerg and Kaserer, 2015; Chan and van Wijnbergen, 2016), though this conclusion follows\nonly as a comparative statics exercise on the sensitivity of equity value to exogenous changes\nin asset risk.1\nThe paper focuses on how contractual features of CoCo debt affect a bank's incentives\nto take inefficient risk that involves a choice for speculative assets purely for risk shifting\nreasons, as they would not be chosen by an unlevered investors. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first treatment of banks' endogenous asset risk choice in response to CoCo debt.2\nWhile equity would naturally offer the lowest risk incentives, our starting point presumes\nthat CoCos are issued because an increase in bank equity is not an option.3 We show that\ngoing-concern CoCo capital reduces risk-taking as it forces deleveraging in highly levered\nstates, when risk-shifting incentives are strongest.\nOur structural analysis reveals some surprising effects of CoCo debt's contractual fea-\ntures.4 A key result is that CoCo debt can be shown to be better at reducing ex ante risk\nthan conventional bail-inable debt. Going-concern conversion in high leverage states reduces\nrisk-shifting, while debt bail-in only reallocates losses at default among debtors. As it does\nnot affect shareholder payoffs, it does not alter their ex ante risk incentives.\nThe main contribution to endogenous risk reduction turns out to be the direct effect\nof leverage reduction upon conversion. In contrast, equity dilution caused upon a going\nconcern conversion does not reduce inefficient risk-taking but actually enhances it. This\nis in contrast with the result on risk incentives under conventional convertible debt Green\n(1984). The insight is that traditional convertible bondholders have a long option position\n1Partial exceptions are Chen, Glasserman, Nouri, and Pelger (2017), where equityholders may choose for\nstrategic default when insolvent, and Chan and van Wijnbergen (2016) who study a bank's trade-off between\nprobability of conversion and bankruptcy cost.\n2We offer an overview of the main assumptions and results in the literature in the Appendix.\n3Distinct benefits of CoCos versus equity are its lower after-tax cost and better incentives for effort under\na managerial agency conflict (Kashyap et al., 2008).\n4Consistently with a scarcity of bank equity, the trigger on CoCo debt is set so as to avoid conversion in\nstates when it does not contribute to reducing risk-taking.\nand convert only in a favorable outcome, diluting high returns from riskier choices. Instead,\nCoCo debt automatically turns into equity when asset values are revealed to be low.5 Equity\ndilution upon conversion has a counterproductive effect because it reduces the share of value\naccruing to shareholders of a safer asset choice. Thus a main conclusion is that CoCo debt\nreduces risk-taking via its debt reduction effect, not through its equity dilution. A separate\ndebt reduction effect arises because a fixed conversion ratio implies a value transfer from\nCoCo holders to equityholders, which we term CoCo dilution (Berg and Kaserer, 2015).6\nIn practice, such a value transfer to equity occurs in all existing CoCo debt issues, as it is\nimpossible to fully adjust the conversion by a contingent conversion ratio (in some states\neven an infinite dilution would be insufficient). The CoCo dilution has the effect of reducing\nequity dilution and thus also banks' risk-shifting incentives. In the extreme case of principal\nwrite down CoCo debt, the equity dilution effect is minimized to zero.\nA final consideration is that as CoCo debt has on average a lower priority than other forms\nof debt it may be expected to command a higher yield, which increases effective leverage and\nthus risk incentives. However, as CoCo bonds induce less risky choices they may be safer in\nequilibrium, in which case they would carry a lower yield.\nWe next compare the two main forms of CoCo debt conversion, namely conversion to\nequity versus principal write-down. Our results suggest that a debt write-off upon conver-\nsion should be preferred, since debt dilution has a favorable effect and equity dilution has\na negative effect on risk incentives. In general however write-down CoCo debt may have a\nhigher yield if it suffers larger loss at conversion. A higher yield worsens risk choice, an effect\nthat must be traded off against the balance of the equity and CoCo dilution effects.7 Numer-\nical calibrations suggest that although converted to equity CoCos are more expensive than\nprincipal write-down CoCos, the risk reduction effect of the latter is usually stronger. The\nintuition is that a contingent conversion reduces endogenous risk sufficiently to compensate\nfor their larger risk bearing.\nThe effectiveness of CoCo conversion on risk incentives critically depends on the precision\nof the trigger, and specifically how frequently it delivers deleveraging in states when risk-\nshifting incentives have deteriorated. Equity is equivalent to conversion in all states and\ntherefore always ensures safer choice. A final conclusion is that CoCo debt will fail to\ncontrol risk in the most levered banks, for which there is a clear role for direct regulatory\nintervention.\n1.1 Model discussion and related literature\nOur setup offers a limited welfare analysis. We take initial capital requirements and deposit\ninsurance as given. Following the literature, insured deposits are assumed to be the cheapest\nform of funding as deposit insurance is not properly priced. 8. We also do not seek to explain\n5In the model, conversion has a preventive function as it occurs in a timely fashion when risk choices can\nstill be influenced. A delayed conversion just before default would clearly not influence incentives.\n6Berg and Kaserer (2015) study how CoCo debt dilution affects equity valuation near the trigger to assess\nthe effect of any value transfer to and from CoCo debt.\n7It is easy to see that if the yield were the same for both types, a principal write-down version always\ninduces a safer choice.\n8Deposit insurance charges would ceteris paribus increase effective leverage. While the low cost of deposits\nhas a positive effect on risk incentives, we do not advocate subsidizing bank liability risk. Sundaresan and\nWang (2014) show how even fairly priced insurance will induce banks to take excess risk.\nthe amount of CoCo issued (although our calibration model may be used to optimize the\ntradeoff between a higher equity content and a higher yield). Rather than introducing\nan arbitrary rationale for the choice of CoCo debt versus equity, we implicitly presume that\nthere is a scarcity of equity investors or an unsurmountable reluctance by banks to issue more\nequity. Accordingly, in the model the trigger level is set to economize on equity content by\navoiding any CoCo conversion for banks for which it would not improve risk incentives. This\nchoice could be rationalized in a setting with an increasing cost of risk absorption capacity\nand a regulatory goal to minimize the frequency of bank default, a framework we plan to\nadopt in future work.\nIn our basic model CoCos act as a junior debt upon default at maturity rather to convert\nin equity. This feature turns out to be desirable as it reduces risk incentives by avoiding\na transfer to old shareholders in near-default states. In an extension we consider a more\nconventional CoCo conversion into equity upon default. In this case a riskier asset choice\nat the interim date increases the chance of conversion (as it is the case with other models\nwhere conversion may occur in continuous time).\nGone-concern conversion is shown to induce riskier choice for some banks that were pre-\nviously playing safe (since it increases the chance of a value transfer from CoCo debtholders),\nwhile some highly levered banks may now be safer precisely to ensure a value transfer. We\nshow that on average the proper trigger value should be set higher.\nIn line with the literature, the trigger is based on an observable value of bank assets. All\noutstanding CoCo issues are designed to be triggered by accounting value triggers, which\nimplies that they may convert only at discrete intervals, as in our model. Regulators have not\nencouraged continuous time triggers based on market prices, as they may be manipulable\nand cause multiple pricing equilibria (Sundaresan and Wang, 2015), a finding challenged\nby Pennacchi and Tchistyi (2016). In practice both market and accounting measures are\nimprecise and manipulable. Other approaches to conversion are offered in Duffie (2010) and\nMcDonald (2013), where the case of conversion in a systemic crisis is examined. Glasserman\nand Nouri (2012) study the interesting theoretical case of a continuous conversion feature.\nChan and van Wijnbergen (2014) highlight a possible systemic effect of CoCo conversion, as\nit may trigger runs when asset risk is correlated across banks.\nIn our set up (as in all outstanding CoCo debt), conversion never results in a positive\nvalue transfer to CoCo holders. Hilscher and Raviv (2014) argue that a very high equity\ndilution rate at conversion may discourage risk-taking. In practice, converting debt into\nshares at below book value faces serious legal issues, and is impossible in states when net\nequity is negative.\nOur approach has implications for pricing of contingent capital. CoCos are usually priced\nas a package of conventional bonds and a short position in a put option. This leads to\nunderpricing as it neglects their risk-reducing effect, which reduces the value of their short\noption position.\nThere is still limited empirical work on CoCo pricing and their effect on bank risk.\nAn issuance of CoCo debt should reduce the overall chance of bank default. Interestingly,\nAvdjiev, Bolton, Jiang, Kartasheva, and Bogdanova (2017) show that the market impact of\na bank issuing CoCo debt is a lower CDS spread, but has no effect on share returns. This\ncombination of results suggests that issuing CoCo not only absorbs risk but is also associated\nwith lower expected asset risk.9 The introduction of CoCo debt may also be beneficial by\n9Avdjiev et al. (2017) suggest that current CoCo prices do not properly reflect losses at conversion,\ninducing voluntary equity recapitalization to avoid costly dilution of profits or loss of control,\nSection 2 presents the basic setup, and Section 3 shows how CoCo design affects the\nbanker's risk choice. Section 4 prices different contractual forms and compares the yield\namong bail-inable debt, principal write-down CoCos and converted to equity CoCos and\ncompares their effect on risk choice under endogenous yield. Section 5 considers CoCos\nthat may convert at maturity and compares their risk reduction effect with those that act\nat maturity as a junior debt. Section 6 compares the bank risk choice under CoCo versus\nequity funding. Section 7 concludes. The Appendix contains all the proofs as well as an\noverview of the main assumptions and results in the literature.\n2 Model Setup\nAll agents are risk-neutral. There are three dates: t = 0, t = 1 (interim date) and t = 2.\nThe bank has initial assets of value 1 at t = 0, financed with 1 - D of equity that satisfies\nan exogenous capital requirements. Bank debt D may include CoCo bonds with face value\nC and insured deposits D - C.10 The interim CoCo coupon rate, the deposit rate and the\ndeposit insurance premia are normalized to zero. CoCo debtholders are competitive, so they\nbreak-even in expectation. There is one active agent in the model: the banker/bank owner,\nwho chooses the interim level of credit risk.11 The banker's payoff is the value of the original\nbank equity at t = 2. Borrowers are price-takers.\nAt t = 1, the asset value v is uniformly distributed over [1 - , 1 + ], so interim leverage\nis D\nv\n. This is initially observed only by the banker, who then chooses whether to exert risk\ncontrol effort (e = 1) or not (e = 0). Effort is costless.\nDepending on the banker's choice, asset values at t = 2 may be safe or risky. If the\nbanker exercises risk control, assets produce a safe payoff with gross return 1, and the final\nasset value is v. Alternatively, a risky credit strategy has payoff V2\n= v - z + Z, where\nZ has zero mean and variance 1. Thus, the mean of the final asset value is E(V2\n) = v - z,\nand the standard deviation is , distribution function is F(V2\n) and density function is f(V2\n).\nCritically, we assume z > 0, so the riskier strategy is a dominated asset that yields less\non average than the safer asset.12 However, when debt exceeds asset values, a risky choice\nwould enhance equity value.\nAfter the risk choice is made at t = 1, the value v is revealed with probability  to all\ninvestors. (Note that  measures the precision of public information.) We assume that no\nbank equity may be raised at this time. This signal is verifiable and may be used as a trigger\nfor conversion. CoCos are automatically converted into equity when the interim asset value\nv is revealed to have fallen below a pre-specified trigger level vT\nat t = 1. The trigger value\nis initially set lower than the initial book value 1, else there would be immediate conversion\nat t = 0. As we study going-concern conversion, we assume that at t = 1 the value of equity\nis positive upon conversion of CoCo debt, so v  D - C for any v. After conversion, the\nrepresented in our setting by the CoCo dilution effect.\n10We assume that it is mandatory for the bank to issue CoCos.\n11We assume the bank manager is the sole equityholder, to focus on risk-taking rather than on other\nagency conflicts between managers and equityholders.\n12As a result, the distribution of asset return in the safe outcome has second-order dominance relative to\nrisky outcome, though not first-order dominance.\namount of shares is 1+d, where d is the amount of shares CoCo holders get upon conversion,\nequal to the ratio of face value of CoCos over the trigger asset value minus debt: d = C\nvT -D\n.\nThis conversion ratio ensures no value transfer when asset value equals exactly vT\n, but leads\nto a transfer from CoCo holders as soon as v is strictly below vT\nwhich we refer to as CoCo\nAt t = 2, CoCos repay C(1 + y), where y is initially exogenous (we endogenize the yield\nin Section 4). To highlight the pure effect of going concern conversion, we assume that at\nt = 2 CoCos act as traditional junior debt, senior to equity.14\nThe current payoff structure is presented in the Figure 1. The trigger value vT\nis set by\nFigure 1: Payoffs in case of no conversion vs early conversion (d < 1)\na regulator whose objective is to minimize ex ante risk (i.e. the probability that the banker\nchooses the inefficient risky strategy), while avoiding unnecessary conversions.\nThe sequence of events is presented in Figure 2.\n3 Bank Debt Design and Risk-Shifting Incentives\nThe banker makes her risk decision to maximize her expected payoff upon observing v. Her\nrisk shifting incentives can be characterized in terms of the range of values for which risk\ncontrol is chosen. Under our assumption of going concern conversion v  D - C, when risk\nis controlled depositors are always repaid from bank assets, even in default. In contrast,\nif the banker chooses the risky asset, losses may fully wipe out CoCo debt and force some\nlosses on the deposit insurance fund.\n3.1 Baseline Case: Deposits\nConsider the baseline case when instead of CoCo debt of amount C bank holds deposits, and\nthus all debt D is represented only by deposits. We follow the literature in assuming that\n13Conversion at par via a contingent conversion ratio is possible only over some range, but in low states\neven a conversion in an infinite amount of shares would not be sufficient. Full equity dilution ahead of default\nwould in any case be illegal.\n14In Section 5 we consider CoCos that can convert into equity at maturity.\nFigure 2: The sequence of events\ndeposit insurance not properly priced, so that deposit funding is the cheapest form of debt.\nThe expected banker's payoff from a risky asset choice is:\n> D, v) =\n\nD\nwhich is the sum of its unconditional mean E(V2\n- D) = v - z - D (which may be negative)\nand a measure of the right tail return in solvent states:\n\nD\n= v - z - D -\nD\n-\n= v - z - D + (v, D, ) (2)\nwhere (v, D, ) is the value of the put option (commonly called Merton's put) enjoyed by\nbank equityholders under limited liability. It measures the temptation of the banker to shift\nrisk, defined as the difference in her payoff between a risky and safe strategy:\n> D, v) - (v - D) = -z + (v, D, ) (3)\nWe henceforth refer to (v) as the measure of risk-shifting incentives.\nLemma 1. If the risky asset payoff is normally or uniformly distributed, risk-shifting in-\ncentives (v) are monotonically decreasing and convex in asset value v: -1   (v) \n0,  (v)  0. Moreover, risk-shifting incentives increase with a higher volatility of risky\nasset .\nThus, for a normal distribution, risk-shifting incentives are given by:\n(v) = (v - D - z) \u00b7 \nv - D - z\n\nv - D - z\n\nWe assume that f(V2\n) is such that the risk-shifting incentive function is convex in asset\nvalue.\nAssumption 1. Risk-shifting incentives (v) are decreasing and convex function of asset\nvalue v: -1   (v)  0,  (v)  0. Also (v) are increasing with :  ()  0.\nFigure 3: Risk-shifting incentives under Gaussian risk distribution\nNow consider the risk choice of the banker when bank's debt is represented only by\ndeposits. The banker's program is:\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 max (v - D, 0)\nequity value if e = 1\n+(1 - e) \u00b7 (v - z - D + (v))\nequity value if e = 0\nAt (v) = z the net present value of the banker's choice of a risky lending strategy is\nzero. Under the Assumption 1, the banker's choice is:\ne =\n1 if v  max [-1(z), D]  v\nD\n0 otherwise\nwhere v\nD\nis the cut-off interim asset value.\nLemma 2. Under deposit funding, the banker controls risk if interim leverage is sufficiently\nlow, namely if v  v\nD\n max [-1(z), D]. If -1(z) > D, threshold v\nD\nrises and the ex ante\nprobability of risk control (defined as 1+-v\nD\n) decreases with the volatility of risky asset .\nWe now use the threshold v\nD\nas a measure of risk prevention against which different\nforms of bank debt may be compared.\n3.2 Bail-inable debt\nIn our setting CoCo debt resembles bail-inable debt at maturity date t = 2 unless it converts\nat t = 1. To establish the effect of the convertibility feature, we first derive the benchmark\ncase of pure bail-inable debt.\nConsider that instead of CoCo debt of amount C bank holds bail-inable debt, promising\na yield Cy at t = 2. As it is never converted, it is equivalent to CoCo debt when conversion\nis never triggered (such as when there is never an informative signal  = 0).\nThen the banker's program is:\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 max (v - D - Cy, 0) + (1 - e) \u00b7 (v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy))\nwhere (v - Cy) = - D+Cy\n-\n- D - Cy)f(V2\nis its risk-shifting incentive under\nbail-inable debt.\nThe optimal risk choice by the banker is to control risk if v  v\nD\n+ Cy  v\nB\n.\nProposition 1. (Yield effect) Under bail-inable debt funding, the banker controls risk less\noften than under deposits, since v  v\nB\n v\nD\n+ Cy. The frequency of risk control 1+-v\nB\ndeclines with yield y and the amount of bail-inable debt C.\nThis result simply reflects the lower effective leverage associated to deposits because of\ntheir lower yield, which is solely due to deposit insurance. The resulting higher leverage\nleads to worse risk control. This yield effect is shown in Figure 4 as the difference between\nv\nB\nand v\nD\n.\nFigure 4: Risk choice under bail-inable debt\nNote that in both cases of deposit or bail-inable debt, an interim revelation of v has no\neffect on risk choice, as this disclosure does not change leverage.15\nThis section considers the case of an amount C of CoCo debt, triggered by a public signal\nwith precision . An efficient design of CoCo debt requires that a trigger improves banker's\nrisk control decision. Intuitively, conversion should be triggered when bank's interim leverage\nis high enough. We set the trigger such that no conversion occurs for well-capitalized banks\nwhich have low risk incentives. This choice trades-off the frequency of risk control against\nan increasing marginal cost of risk absorbing capital.\nWe first consider the banker's risk control decision under a given trigger vT\n, and use the\nresult to define the proper trigger level.\nFrom Proposition 1, setting a trigger higher than v\nB\ndoes not change risk control choice\nfor low levered banks (defined as those with v  v\nB\n). Moreover, the range of trigger values\n15As depositors are insured, they would not run at t = 1 even if v is low.\nis the interval satisfying vT\n< 1 to ensure no conversion at t = 0. Upon conversion, CoCo\nholders get the amount of shares d = C\nvT -D\n, which we refer to as conversion ratio. CoCo\nconversion dilutes shareholders' payoff to 1\nshare of equity. Further we show that equity\ndilution induces riskier choices as it reduces the value the shareholders get under safe strategy.\nSuch a conversion ratio also ensures CoCo debt dilution, i.e upon conversion holders of CoCo\ndebt get less than its face value. CoCo dilution enhances safer choice since it has the opposite\neffect than equity dilution by increasing shareholders' stake.\nConsider the banker's program:\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 [max (v - D - Cy, 0) \u00b7 (I(v  vT\n) + (1 - ) \u00b7 I(v < vT\n))\nequity value if no conversion and e=1\n+\nv - D + C\n\u00b7  \u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if conversion and e=1\n] +\n(1 - e) \u00b7 [(v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy)) \u00b7 (I(v  vT\n) + (1 - ) \u00b7 I(v < vT\n))\nequity value if no conversion and e=0\n+\nv - z - D + C + (v + C)\n\u00b7  \u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if conversion and e=0\n]\nwhere I(\u00b7) is an indicator function, (v + C) = - D-C\n-\n- D + C)f(V2\nis risk-\nshifting incentive under CoCos conversion.\nThis identifies two critical interim asset values. First, v\nB\nis the value threshold at which\nthe banker chooses for risk control even if no conversion may take place, equivalent to the\nthreshold for bail-inable debt. Second, v\nC\nis the risk control threshold for CoCo debt. This\nvalue depends on whether the critical asset value v\nC\nis above the threshold D +Cy, in which\ncase bank equity is positive even without conversion:\n \u00b7\nz - [D + C(1 + y)]\nwhere v\nC\nis defined implicitly in (10):\nF =  \u00b7 z-[v+C]\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (9) holds\nG =  \u00b7 z-[v+C]\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise\nProposition 2. The introduction of CoCos improves risk control choice for banks relative to\ntraditional bail-inable debt in the range of asset values v\nC\n v  vT\n. Banks with extremely\nhigh leverage (v < v\nC\n) still choose to take risk, while high value banks (v > v\nB\n) choose to\ncontrol risk.\nBanks with v < v\nC\nhave such high leverage that they choose to gamble and not control\nrisk.16 Figure 5 shows how the risk control choice of the banker depends on the trigger, and\n16Were CoCo debt large enough (v\nC\n< 1 - ), this range does not arise, and all banks with v < vT\nhave\nincentives to contain asset risk.\nin particular how it may not be monotonic in the interim asset value.\nFigure 5: Risk choice under CoCos\nThe difference vT -v\nC\nmeasures the expected improvement in risk control induced by\nCoCos. It is easy to see that v\nC\nis in the range [v\nD\n-C, v\nB\n] and decreases with the probability\nof information revelation  (see Figure 6).\nFigure 6: Cut-off value v\nC\nLemma 3. CoCo debt improves bank's risk control more as the trigger precision  goes up.\nThe intuition is that a more informative trigger forces more frequently a recapitalization\nin states with high risk-shifting incentives.\nHaving characterized the banker's risk control choice under a given trigger, we can identify\nthe trigger level, which ensures the monotonicity of risk control choice. Setting the trigger\nvalue at vT\n= v\nB\nensures monotonicity of risk control choice and thus produces expected risk\nreduction (1+-v\nC\n)\nfor a given amount of CoCo debt C (and thus a given conversion ratio d).\nFigure 5 shows that unless the trigger vT\nis chosen properly, the risk control choice is\nnot necessarily monotonic in v. If the trigger is too high (above v\nB\n), CoCos will not affect\nrisk choice of low levered banks with v > v\nB\n. If it is too low (below v\nB\n), there will be no\nconversion for an intermediate range of highly levered banks. This is clearly inefficient, as\nit is easier to induce risk control for higher v. As a result, setting the trigger to vT\n= v\nB\nguarantees the monotonicity of risk control with respect to asset value, as shown in Figure\nLemma 4. Under the trigger vT\n= v\nB\n, CoCos induce safer choice than bail-inable debt.\nUnder the monotonic trigger, the risk control improvement under CoCos against bail-\ninable debt ranges from 0 (if v\nC\n= v\nB\n) to v\nB\n-(v\nD\n-C)\n(if v\nC\n= v\nD\n- C). Therefore, CoCos\nensure better risk control than bail-inable debt. However, CoCo debt does not generally\nimprove risk control relative to insured deposit funding whose yield is subsidized.\nFigure 7: Risk choice under CoCos with restricted trigger asset value vT\n= v\nB\nLemma 5. A higher amount of CoCo debt C or a higher yield y require that the trigger\nvalue be raised to maintain the monotonicity of risk control choice.\nAs in the case of bail-inable debt, a higher promised yield at maturity Cy increases\nleverage and thus willingness to take risk. A higher trigger value vT\n= v\nB\nhere is needed to\noffset this effect subsidized by increasing the CoCo's equity content. However, it also leads\nto more frequent conversion and more risk bearing for CoCo debtholders. The next section\nendogenizes the yield for a general characterization.\nThe trigger value should be set higher when the risky asset choice is more volatile. A\nhigher asset volatility increases the return to risk-shifting when (D) > z.\nHaving mapped the banker's risk control decision under a properly set trigger, we turn\nto decompose the effect of different CoCo debt features on bank's risk choice.\n3.4 Forms of CoCo debt\nFirst we consider the extreme case when conversion leads to a full write-down of principal.\nWhen triggered, this type of CoCo debt \"disappears\". This is equivalent to the case of a\nzero conversion ratio d = 0.\nWhen write-down CoCos convert, the bank has suddenly less leverage while shareholders\nkeep all shares. This is an extreme form of CoCo dilution. The banker's program is similar\nto (8) under d = 0. As before, there is a critical value v\nWD\nfor the interim asset value above\nwhich the introduction of write-down CoCos improves risk control (see Figure 8).\nProposition 3 (Debt reduction effect). Under write-down CoCos with conversion ratio d = 0,\nthe banker controls risk if v  v\nWD\n. This improves risk control relative to converted to equity\nCoCo debt, since the cut-off value v\nWD\nis lower than v\nC\n.\nIntuitively, when conversion lowers bank leverage, risk incentives are reduced. The risk\nreduction relative to bail-inable debt represents a pure debt reduction effect represented as\nv\nB\n-v\nin Figure 8.\nFigure 8: Risk choice under write-down CoCos. Debt reduction effect.\nNext we establish the benchmark of CoCos converted at par, and then discuss more realistic\ncase of CoCos with the fixed conversion ratio.\nConversion at par\nWe briefly consider the possibility that the CoCo conversion ratio could be set such that\nno value transfer would occur upon conversion, i.e d = C\nv-D\n. In other words, the CoCo bond\npayoff upon conversion is exactly equal to its face value C. This feature is impossible in\npractice for very low v, but it is considered here as it sets a useful benchmark.\nThe banker's program and its solution are equivalent to (8) as well as (9) and (10)\nrespectively under d = C\nv-D\n. There is a critical value v\nP\n, the interim asset value above which\nthe introduction of at par CoCos improves risk control.\nProposition 4 (Equity dilution effect). Under CoCos converted at par with conversion ratio\nd = C\nv-D\n, the banker controls risk if v  v\nP\n. Risk control is lower than for write-down CoCos,\nsince the cut-off value v\nP\nis higher than v\nWD\n.\nHigher conversion ratio d implies higher equity dilution (the banker gets v-D\nv-D+C\nthe total equity upon conversion). Since upon conversion net equity value is still positive v >\nD -C, a greater equity dilution reduces the net payoff to safe asset choice thus discouraging\nrisk control. In other words, such a conversion increases the risk control threshold and thus\nreduces bank's incentives to control risk. We call the banker's risk control reduction from\nat par CoCos relative to write-down Cocos an equity dilution effect presented as v\nP\n-v\nin\nFigure 9. Note that by construction there will be no counteracting effect from CoCo dilution\nat conversion.\nConversion with CoCo debt dilution\nConversion at par is not always possible, and it is never attempted in practice. We\nconsider now the realistic case of going concern CoCos with fixed conversion ratio d = C\nvT -D\n,\na design feature common to all outstanding CoCo bonds.\nThe banker's program and its solution are (8) as well as (9) and (10) respectively under\nd = C\nvT -D\n. The critical value is v\nC\nabove which the introduction of converted to equity CoCo\ndebt improves risk control.\nProposition 5 (CoCo dilution effect). Under CoCos with fixed conversion ratio d = C\nvT -D\n,\nthe banker controls risk if v  v\nC\n. Risk control is higher than for CoCos converted at par,\nsince the cut-off value v\nC\nis lower than v\nP\n.\nFigure 9: Risk choice under at par CoCos. Equity dilution effect.\nThis result identifies the CoCo dilution effect, driven by the value transfer from CoCo debt\nto equity upon conversion. Since the fixed conversion ratio is lower than the par conversion\nratio C\nvT -D\n< C\nv-D\n, upon conversion holders of CoCo debt get less than the promised face\nvalue. As a result, the equity dilution effect is reduced, and the safe asset payoff increases\nrelative to the risky one. Thus, we can conclude that this produces better risk control. We\ncan call the banker's risk control increase from CoCos with a fixed conversion ratio relative\nto at par CoCos a pure CoCo dilution effect presented as v\nC\n-v\nP\nFigure 10: Risk choice under CoCos with fixed conversion ratio. CoCo dilution effect.\nNote that fixed conversion ratio depends on the trigger value.\nLemma 6. The value transfer from the holders of CoCo debt to equity holders (referred to as\nCoCo dilution effect) increases with the trigger value vT\n, so CoCo debt with a higher trigger\nproduces (ceteris paribus) greater risk reduction.\nNote that because of the CoCo dilution effect, a high trigger reduces risk-shifting in-\ncentives beyond the direct effect of their higher equity content. The key reason is that\ngoing-concern conversion ensures that equity value is positive under a safe strategy. Since\nrisk control dominates the risky strategy, this improves the banker's risk choice.\nTable 1 summarizes the effects of CoCos on the banker's risk choice under different\nformulations. Thus, principal write-down CoCo debt turns out to give the highest risk\nreduction possible associated with convertible debt as it maximizes the positive effect of\ndebt reduction in the absence of equity dilution. However, it may also demand higher yield\nto compensate its holders for the loss of value upon conversion.\nEffect Bail-inable Debt Write-down Equity Convert CoCo Impact on Risk\nDebt reduction No Yes Yes Risk Reduction\nEquity dilution No No Yes Risk Enhancement\nCoCo dilution No No Yes Risk Reduction\nYield Yes Yes Yes Risk Enhancement\nTable 1: Effects of debt instruments on bank risk choice\n4 Endogenous Yield\nThis section solves for the endogenous yield across debt types by a numerical calibration of\nthe results. Assessing CoCo debt pricing in terms of its contractual features is ultimately\nnecessary for any policy conclusions. Clearly, the yield depends both on the induced endoge-\nnous risk and the relative priority of the different forms of bank debt.\nBail-inable debt\nConsider possible payoffs under bail-inable debt (as shown in the upper panels of Figure\n11). Under a safe choice debtholders are repaid C(1+y) if there is enough funds (v > D+Cy).\nIf interim leverage is low (v < D + Cy), then debtholders get what is left after deposits are\nrepaid v - (D - C). Under the risky choice, their payoff depends on the realization of V2\n.\nFigure 11: Payoff of CoCo debt converted to equity under different banker's choice\nWe showed earlier that bail-inable debt induces a safe choice when interim asset values\nv  v\nB\n= v\nD\n+Cy. Thus, debtholders expect to get safe payoff with probability 1+-v\nB\n, and\nrisky payoff otherwise. Since bail-inable debt does not repay C in all states, the promised\nyield must be positive for debtholders to break-even.\nNote that for any types of CoCos, the payoff structure of CoCo debt holders is the same\nas for the holders of bail-inable debt if no conversion is triggered. However, the distribution\nof these payoffs depends on the induced risk choice.\nWrite-down CoCos\nNext consider the case when the banker raises C of write-down CoCos and D - C in\ndeposits. If conversion is not triggered, holders of write-down CoCos get the same payoff\nas bail-inable debt holders (as shown in the upper panels of Figure 11). Holders of write-\ndown CoCo debt get nothing if conversion is triggered, independently from the strategy of the\nbanker (see Figure 8). Two differences between bail-inable debt and write-down CoCos affect\ntheir yields. First, in the states when conversion is triggered, write-down CoCos offer no\npayment even if the bank is solvent, reducing the payoff to CoCo holders. Second, write-down\nCoCos discourage risk, thus enhancing the probability of repayment when the interim value\nis not revealed. The chance of getting a certain payoff equal to min {C(1 + y), v - D + C}\nis higher in case of write-down CoCos.\nIntuitively, these depend on the trigger value vT\nand its precision . A higher trigger\nas well as a higher precision increase the yield to compensate for the CoCoholders' losses in\nconversion. At the same time, they also induce a safer banker's choice, and thus reduce the\nrequired yield.\nEquity conversion CoCo debt\nWe now consider the case of CoCos with a fixed equity conversion ratio.\nIf conversion is triggered, holders of CoCo debt receive a share of equity d\n. In the case\nof safe asset choice when v\nC\n v < v\nB\n, they get a fraction of the safe payoff d\n\u00b7(v -D+C).\nIn case of a risky choice when v < v\nC\n, their payoff depends on the asset realization at t = 2.\nIf the CoCos are not converted, holders of converted to equity CoCo debt get the same payoff\nas bail-inable debt holders under safe and risky strategies. Those payoffs are shown in Figure\n11. Recall that risk control is chosen for v  v\nC\n(as shown in Figure 10).\nThere are two critical differences between bail-inable debt and converted to equity CoCo\nbonds that affect their yields. First, unlike bail-inable debt holders, CoCo holders face a\ndebt dilution loss when converted. Second, CoCos induce better risk control, increasing the\nprobability of some repayment either in the form of equity or debt (for v\nC\n v < v\nB\n).\nComparing risk across CoCo debt types\nFinally, we compare write-down CoCo and converted to equity CoCo debt. Again, there\nare two effects. Intuitively, write-down CoCos should be more expensive, since conversion\nleads to a complete loss of value. The resulting higher yield may reduce incentives to control\nrisk (and will require a higher trigger). At the same time, write-down CoCo debt induces\nhigher risk control than converted to equity CoCos because of the absence of any equity\ndilution effect.\nThe comparison of the payoff structure together with the endogenous risk choice is shown\nin Table 217. The formulas for implicitly given yields of these three types of debt are given\nin the Appendix.\n17\"Risk\" indicates that the banker makes risky choice, \"Safe\" indicates safe choice, \"Conv wp \" means\nthat conversion takes place with probability , \"No Conv\" means that no conversion takes place.\nDebt type/ Range of v v < v\nWD\nv\nWD\n v < v\nC\nv\nC\n v < v\nB\nv  v\nB\nBail-inable debt Risk/No Conv Risk/No Conv Risk/No Conv Safe/No Conv\nWrite-down CoCo Risk/Conv wp  Safe/Conv wp  Safe/Conv wp  Safe/No Conv\nEquity convert CoCo Risk/Conv wp  Risk/Conv wp  Safe/Conv wp  Safe/No Conv\nTable 2: Payoff structure and endogenous risk of debt instruments\nNext, we perform a numerical calibration. We focus on the bank's risk control choice as\nwell as the magnitude of the yield for different forms of debt.\nThere are two key elements affecting the yield, aside from their contractual priority:\nthe induced amount of endogenous risk and the resulting amount of risk bearing by the\ndeposit insurance fund. This quantitative exercise is necessary to define the specific ranking\nof required yields for different types of debt a well as their relative effect on endogenous\nrisk-shifting for the plausible set of parameter values.\nFirst we characterize the yields for different forms of debt for the following set of param-\nyields for bail-inable debt, converted to equity CoCos and principal write-down CoCos for\nthe range of values of bank initial equity 1 - D (upper left panel), risky asset volatility \n(upper right panel) and the amount of certain type of debt C (lower panel).\nQuantitative result 1.\nThe yield for converted to equity CoCos may be higher than that of bail-inable debt if initial\nbank equity is high, and the amount of non-deposit debt C as well as risky asset volatility\n are low. In contrast, principal write-down CoCos require higher yield than converted to\nequity CoCos or bail-inable debt.\nThis result points out that the risk reduction effect of converted to equity CoCos may\nbe sufficiently high to compensate the CoCoholders for the loss they face at conversion. So\nthat converted to equity CoCo debt may become cheaper than bail-inable debt. In the case\nof write-down CoCos the CoCo dilution faced by their holders is so strong that it offsets the\nrisk reduction effect write-down CoCos obtain. As a result, the write-down CoCo holders will\nrequire a higher yield than the holders of bail-inable debt and converted to equity CoCos.\nNext we characterize the bank's risk control choice for different forms of debt. Figure 13\nillustrates risk control thresholds for bail-inable debt v\nB\n, CoCos with fixed conversion ratio\nv\nC\nand principal write-down CoCos v\nWD\nover the range of initial equity 1 - D (upper left\npanel), asset volatility  (upper right panel) and the amount of debt C (lower panel).\nQuantitative result 2.\nA bank with principal write-down CoCos controls risk for a wider range of asset values\nthan a bank with CoCos with a fixed conversion ratio, i.e v\nWD\n< v\nC\n.\nRecall that in the basic model with exogenous yield we get the same result because of\nthe absence of equity dilution effect. Here we also take into account the difference in yields\nfor these two types of CoCos. Note from Quantitative result 1 that write-down CoCos pay a\nhigher yield than converted to equity CoCos. In other words the yield effect (which reduces\nincentives to control risk) is stronger in write-down CoCos. Quantitative result 2 highlights\nhow for our plausible set of parameter values, the yield effect is dominated by the equity\ndilution effect.\nFigure 12: Yields for bail-inable debt, standard and principal write-down CoCos.\n5 Conversion at maturity\nIn the basic model we have treated CoCos at maturity as junior bail-inable debt. This\nsection considers an extension where CoCos convert at t = 2 if the asset value V2\nfalls below\nthe trigger vT\n. Thus conversion can take place both as going concern at t = 1 as before and\nas gone concern at the final date t = 2. Conversion ratio is d = C\nvT -D\n.\nWe first characterize the risk control decision for a given yield and trigger vT\n.\nFigure 13: Risk control thresholds for bail-inable debt, standard and principal write-down\nCoCos.\nConsider the banker's program (similar to (8)):\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 [max (v - D - Cy, 0) \u00b7 I(v  vT\n) +\nv - D + C\n\u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if e=1\n] +\n(1 - e) \u00b7 [\nv - z - D + C + (v + C)\n\u00b7  \u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if conversion at t = 1 and e=0\n+\n(F(vT\n) - F(D - C)) \u00b7 E\n- D + C\nD - C < V2\n< vT\nequity value if no conversion at t = 1, but conversion at t = 2 and e=0\n+\n- D - Cy|V2\n> vT\n) \u00b7 [(1 - ) \u00b7 I(v < vT\n) + I(v  vT\n)]\nequity value if no conversion at t = 1 or t = 2 and e=0\n]\nwhere (v+C) = - D-C\n-\n- D + C)f(V2\nis the risk-shifting incentive under CoCos\nconversion.\nThere are two major differences relative to (8). In the first place, gone concern conversion\nis now certain for highly levered banks with v < vT\nif they choose risk control. Second, less\nleveraged banks that take risk may now face a second chance of conversion at t = 2.\nWe next solve for the trigger that provides monotone incentives as in the basic model.\nLemma 7. For a bank with CoCos that may convert at maturity the trigger's value vT\n=\nmax[D + Cy, v\nM\n] ensures monotonicity of the risk control choice. Its value is higher than\nfor CoCos that act as a junior debt at maturity v\nB\n.\nIntuitively, for low levered banks the risky payoff becomes more attractive since its share-\nholders receive a value transfer from CoCoholders upon conversion as long as D - C  V2\n<\nvT\n. To offset this increased risk incentive, a higher trigger is necessary.\nAs it is not possible to compare analytically the risk control thresholds v\nM\nand v\nC\nunder\nan endogenous yield y, we study them under a numerical calibration.18\nFigure 14 illustrates the risk control thresholds for both types of CoCos as a function of\nthe amount of CoCos C. The following result also holds for the wide range of parameter\nvalues D and .\nFigure 14: Risk control thresholds for CoCos with and without gone concern conversion\nQuantitative result 4.\nCoCos with possible conversion at maturity improve the risk control choice relative to\nCoCos acting as junior debt, i.e v\nM\n< v\nC\n, but require a higher trigger and thus more frequent\nconversion.\nIntuitively, for highly levered banks with negative equity at t = 1 a safe choice makes\nconversion certain, gaining a value transfer from CoCo debt, while a risky choice reduces the\nchance of conversion.\n0.05, z = 0.01. See the Appendix for the derivation of the CoCos' yield.\n6 Contingent Capital versus Equity\nIn this section we compare the risk reduction effect of converted to equity CoCo debt versus\nequity. Specifically, the question we address is what amount of contingent capital is required\nto provide the same risk incentives as equity?\nSuppose the bank substitutes one unit of deposits by an extra amount of equity , or\nby an amount k of CoCos. We solve for the level of k which guarantees an equivalent\nimprovement in risk control as with equity. The banker's program with extra equity is:\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 max [v - D + , 0] + (1 - e) \u00b7 (v - D + - z + (v + ))\nAfter adding extra equity , the bank has debt D - , so the amount of equity in the interim\nperiod is v - D + . The bank chooses risk control whenever the difference in risky and safe\nasset mean return z is higher than the risk-shifting incentives (v + ), or equivalently:\ne =\nD\n-\n0 if v < v\nD\n-\nwhere v\nD\n= max[-1(z), D] is a risk control threshold in the bank funded by deposits of\nThe expected improvement in risk control compared to the case of deposit funding is\n, which reflects an increased range of asset values for which there is risk control. From\nearlier results, the improvement in risk control achieved by CoCos is v\nD\n-v\nC\n, where v\nC\nis the\nfunction of k instead of C.\nSo the condition v\nD\n-v\nC\n= guarantees that the expected risk control improvement from\nintroducing extra equity and CoCos k is the same.20\nProposition 6. The effect of CoCos on risk control is always weaker than of equity, unless\nthe trigger is perfectly informative ( = 1).\nLemma 8. The substitution ratio k between extra equity and CoCos k decreases in a convex\nway with the probability of information revelation  if promised CoCo yield is sufficiently\nlow. Conditions for decreasing k function are (9) is satisfied and sufficiently low yield from:\nyk\n[v\nD\n- (1 + ky)] \n- \u00b7 (v\nD\n- D)\n(1 - )(k + v\nD\n\u00b7 {(k + v\nD\n- D) \u00b7 k\n[v\nD\n+ (k - 1)]\n+ (z - [v\nD\nand for its convexity - no condition (9) is satisfied and sufficiently low yield from:\ny[k\n(v\nD\n(v\nD\n- D)\n(k + v\nD\n\u00b7 {k\n[v\nD\n+ (k - 1)] \u00b7 (k + v\nD\n- D)\n+ z - [v\nD\n19The banker controls risk whenever v > -1(z)- . However, if -1(z)- < D- , risk control threshold\nchanges to D - , since for negative net equity the banker never controls risk.\n20As before, we set the trigger value to insure monotonic risk control in v, vT\n= v\nB\n.\nThe equivalence ratio is very sensitive to . As  approaches zero, there is no amount\nof CoCos that can substitute equity to ensure the same risk control.\nThus a key efficiency factor for CoCos depends on the precision of the trigger to signal a\nstate where risk-shifting incentives are high, while equity is always risk bearing. When the\ntrigger is less precise, conversion takes less often when required. As a result, a larger amount\nof CoCos must be used to achieve the same risk control. However, when the required yield\nis sufficiently high, increasing the amount of CoCos becomes counterproductive as it implies\na higher leverage and ultimately higher risk-taking.\n7 Conclusions\nThis paper assesses how the design of bank contingent capital affects risk-taking incentives.\nThe issue is extensively discussed in the literature, but in existing models the asset choice\nidentifies explicitly the effect of contractual terms of contingent capital, necessary for its\noptimal design and pricing. A clear result is that CoCo debt is superior to subordinated\ndebt that may be bailed in upon default, as it actively discourages ex ante risk. This results\nhelps to clarify the importance of going concern conversion which reduces leverage while the\nbank is still solvent.\nThe main beneficial effect of conversion is to contain risk-shifting by reducing leverage in\nstates when risk incentives are high. We show that contrary to more traditional convertible\ndebt (Green, 1984), equity dilution has here a negative effect on incentives. In contrast, debt\ndilution has a positive preventive effect. As a result, CoCo debt with a principal write-down\nconversion may achieve a greater reduction in risk exposure than equity conversion CoCo\nbonds. A countervailing effect may be caused by a higher yield, which increases effective\nleverage. The overall result depends on the precise terms of CoCo debt. A numerical\ncalibration where the yield is endogenous suggests that principal write-down CoCos are\nmore efficient in reducing risk.\nThe framework enables to compare the relative effectiveness of CoCos in risk reduction\nversus common equity, as well as other bank debt. While a one for one exchange ratio of\nCoCos for equity is equivalent in terms of loss absorption upon default, this is no true for\nits preventive effect. Contingent capital is much less efficient than equity because of limited\ntrigger precision, which does not ensure recapitalization in all states of excessive leverage.\nIn future research, we plan to study how using an accounting trigger may result in\nregulatory forbearance, since bank reporting typically involves regulatory oversight. We are\nalso interested in how to design CoCo debt under a constrained amount of risk absorption\ncapacity. In general, research is needed to understand better the effect of CoCos on share\npricing, which is distorted by risk-shifting.\nPaper Main assumptions Result\nPennacchi\n1.

Asset value is only observed by bank\nshareholders, but may be revealed to the public\n3. Default can occur only at maturity\n4. Probability of conversion is independent of risk\nchoice\n5. Endogenous choice of the asset risk\n1. High conversion ratio increases risk-\ntaking incentives\n2. CoCos induce better risk control than\nsubordinated debt and worse than\nequity.\nA Appendix\nPapers studying effect of CoCos on bank risk-taking incentives\nWe consider two distributions of V2\n: normal and uniform. Denote x = V2\n- D. we consider\nx to be normally distributed with mean is v - D - z and variance 2 as well as uniformly\ndistributed with support [v-D-z-\n\n\n3]. We assume that v-D-z+\n\n0, else risky asset is never chosen. Moreover, v -D -z -\n\n3  0, else no risk-shifting takes\nplace.\nFor a normal distribution, the expected value of bank equity (as defined in (1)) is:\n\nx \u00b7\n\n\u00b7 (\nx - (v - D - z)\n\n)dx = (v - D - z) \u00b7 \nv - D - z\n\n+  \u00b7 \n(v - D - z)\n\nFor a uniform distribution (1) is:\n\nx \u00b7\n\ndx =\n(v - D - z + \n\n\nThen the risk-shifting incentive (v) (as defined in (2)) is for a normal distribution:\n(v) = (1 - F(0, v)) \u00b7 E(x|x > 0, v) - (v - D - z) =\n(v - D - z) \u00b7 \nv - D - z\n\n(v - D - z)\n\nwhereas for a uniform distribution:\n(v) = (1 - F(0, v)) \u00b7 E(x|x > 0, v) - (v - D - z) =\n(v - D - z - \n\n\nIt is easy to show that under these distributions (v)\nv\nis non-positive. For a normal\ndistribution it is:\n(v)\nv\n= \nv - D - z\n\nNote also that (v)\nv\n -1, since  v-D-z\n\n [0, 1]. For a uniform distribution:\n(v)\nv\n=\n2(v - D - z - \n\n\nNote also that (v)\nv\n -1, since 2(v - D - z + \n\nConsider 2(v)\nfor a normal distribution:\n= \n(v - D - z)\n\n\u00b7\n\nFor a uniform distribution:\n=\n\nThus, risk-shifting incentives is a convex function of v.\nNext, we look at (v)\n\nfor a normal distribution it is:\n(v)\n\n= \n(v - D - z)\n\nFor a uniform distribution:\n(v)\n\n= -\n(v - D - z - \n\n3) \u00b7 (v - D - z + \n\n\nFinally, we compute (v)\nz\nfor a normal distribution:\n(v)\nz\n= - \nv - D - z\n\nFor a uniform distribution:\n(v)\nz\n= -\n2(v - D - z - \n\n\nFirst, we show that the banker with v > v\nD\ncontrols risk. When solving the problem (5),\nthere are two cases: (1) v > D (positive equity upon safe choice); (2) v  D.\nIf v > D, e = 1 if z > (v). According to the Assumption 1, (v) is decreasing in v.\nThen (v)  z implies that e = 1 if v  -1(z), which is binding if -1(z) > D. If v  D,\nfor any v e = 0.\nThus, the solution to (5) depends on the relationship between D and -1(z). If (D) >\nz, -1(z) > D and the banker controls risk for v > -1(z). Otherwise, if (D)  z,\n-1(z)  D and the banker controls risk for v  D. Thus, e = 1 if v > max [-1(z), D] \nv\nD\n.\nNext, we show that if (D) > z (implying that -1(z) > D), the probability of risk\n) decreases with . Note that 1+--1(z)\ndecreases in -1(z). Since\n-1(z) is given by (v) = z, define H(v, z, )  (v) - z = 0. We use the implicit function\ntheorem to compute v\n\n.\nv\n\n= -\nH/\nH/v\nwhere\nH/ = \nH/v = v\nProposition 1\nFirst, we show that the banker with v > v\nD\n+ Cy controls risk. When solving the problem\n(7), consider two cases: (1) v > D + Cy (positive equity upon safe choice); (2) v  D + Cy.\nIf v > D + Cy, e = 1 if z > (v - Cy). According to the Assumption 1, e = 1 if\nv  -1(z) + Cy, which is binding if -1(z) > D. If v  D + Cy, e = 0 for any v from this\ninterval. Thus, the banker controls risk e = 1 if v > max [-1(z), D] + Cy = v\nD\n+ Cy  v\nB\n.\nNext we show that the probability of risk control for (D) > z (implying that -1(z) >\n) decreases with . The proof of the of the derivative with respect to  is\nidentical to the one from Lemma 2.\nFinally we show that 1+-v\nB\ndeclines with C and y. Note that the derivatives of 1+-v\nD\n-Cy\nwith respect to C and y are equal to - y\nand - C\naccordingly and both are negative.\nProposition 2\nWhen solving the problem (8), there are two cases: (1) v > D + Cy (positive equity upon\nsafe choice); (2) v  D + Cy.\nIf v > D + Cy, the first order condition to (8) is that e = 1 if:\nF =  \u00b7\nz - (v + C)\nNote that F(v) is increasing in v:\nF(v)\nv\n= -(1 - ) (v - Cy) - \n (v + C)\nThen (16) is binding if for v = D + Cy it does not hold, i.e if (9) is satisfied. (9) implies\nthat at v = D + Cy, there is no risk control.\nNext, consider the case when (9) is not satisfied. If v  D + Cy, the first order condition\nto (8) is that e = 1 if:\nG =  \u00b7\nz - (v + C)\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)]  0 (18)\nNote that it is not clear whether G(v) is increasing in v:\nG(v)\nv\n= -(1 - )[ (v - Cy) + 1] - \n (v + C)\nwhere the first item is negative, and second is positive. Also note that the second derivative\nof G(v) with respect to v is negative:\n= -(1 - ) (v - Cy) - \n (v + C)\nNote however, that if G(v)\nv\nis non-positive for some v  D + Cy, it is not possible that for\nv = D + Cy there is a risk control. Thus, if (9) is not satisfied, G(v) is increasing in v. The\nbanker controls risk if v is sufficiently high.\nThus, the solution to (8) depends on (9) and can be presented by v\nC\ndefined in (10). For\nv\nC\n v  vT\n, the banker controls risk.\nUsing implicit function theorem for (10), we demonstrate that higher  reduces v\nC\n, or\ndecreases equivalently risk control:\nv\nC\n\n=\n-F/\nF/v\nif (9) holds\n-G/\nG/v\notherwise\nwhere F\nv\nv\n> 0 from Lemma 2, and\nF\n\n=\nz - (v + C)\nG\n\n=\nz - (v + C)\n- [z - (v - Cy)] + (v - D - Cy)  0 (23)\nthe first item in (22) and (23) is non-negative, and the second is non-positive due to the fact\nthat (v - Cy) > (v + C) (recall that v\n(v)  0). For F(v) = 0 and G(v) = 0, it must\nbe that z - (v - Cy)  0 and z - (v + C)  0.\nThus, independent of condition (9), v\nC\n\n< 0, and trigger precision reduces v\nC\n.\nWe show that 1) v\nC\n v\nB\n(CoCos induce safer choices that bail-inable debt), and 2) it can\nbe that v\nC\n> v\nD\n(CoCos may induce riskier choice than deposit funding).\nFirst, note that v\nC\ndecreases in  from Lemma 3. Thus, v\nC\nis at maximum when  = 0,\ncorresponding to:\n= z - (v - Cy) = 0 if (9) holds\n= z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy) = 0 otherwise\nIf (9) holds, v\nC\n= -1(z) + Cy, otherwise v\nC\n D + Cy (as shown in Lemma 2). Thus, for\nboth cases, v\nC\n v\nB\n.\nSecond, since v\nB\n v\nD\nfor any positive y, for sufficiently low , v\nC\n> v\nD\n(the maximum\nv\nC\nis v\nB\n). This implies that deposit funding may provide better risk control than CoCos due\nto the presence of yield effect.\nRecall that the trigger is equal to vT\n= v\nB\n= v\nD\n+ Cy. Note that if the amount of CoCos\nincreases, the trigger must go up:\n(v\nD\n+ Cy)\nC\nThe same holds for the increase in exogenous yield y:\n(v\nD\n+ Cy)\ny\nProposition 3\nThe banker's program is:\nmax\ne\ne \u00b7 [max (v - D - Cy, 0) \u00b7 (I(v  vT\n) + (1 - ) \u00b7 I(v < vT\n))\nequity value if no conversion and e=1\n+\nv - D + C \u00b7  \u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if conversion and e=1\n] +\n(1 - e) \u00b7 [(v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy)) \u00b7 (I(v  vT\n) + (1 - ) \u00b7 I(v < vT\n))\nequity value if no conversion and e=0\n+\nv - z - D + C + (v + C) \u00b7  \u00b7 I(v < vT\n)\nequity value if conversion and e=0\n]\nThe proof is similar to the one of Lemma 2. This is just a special case when CoCos have\nconversion ratio d = 0. The critical value v\nWD\ndepends on condition (28) which describes\nwhen v\nWD\nis above D + Cy:\nv\nWD\nis defined implicitly in (29):\n[z - (v + C)] + (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (28) holds\n[z - (v + C)] + (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise\nThis allows us to disentangle the effect of CoCos on risk control when there is no conversion\nwhen trigger is breached.\nTo show this effect, we assume that introduction of CoCos only affects leverage upon con-\nversion. Using implicit function theorem for (10), we demonstrate the direct debt reduction\neffect on v\nC\n:\nv\nC\nC\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\n=\n-F/C\nF/v\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\nif (9) holds\n-G/C\nG/v\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\notherwise\nwhere\nF\nv\n= -\n\n\u00b7 v\n(v + C) - (1 - )v\nF\nC\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\n= -\n\n\u00b7 C\nG\nv\n= -\n\n\u00b7 v\n(v + C) - (1 - )[v\nG\nC\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\n= -\n\n\u00b7 C\nIndependent on (9), v\nC\nC\n|d=fixed,Cy=fixed\n 0 implying that higher C reduces leverage and\ndecreases v\nC\n. We define debt reduction effect as the risk control improvement associated\nwith the change in leverage only (but not affected by the yield or conversion ratio) compared\nto the baseline case of only deposit funding v\nD\n-v\n, where v\nWD\nfor a paid yield Cy = 0.\nProposition 4\nThe proof is similar to the one of Lemma 2. This is a special case when CoCos have conversion\nratio d = C\nv-D\n. The critical value v\nP\ndepends on the condition (36) which describes when v\nP\nis above D + Cy:\n \u00b7\n(z - [D + C(1 + y)](v - D)\nv - D + C\nv\nP\nis defined implicitly in (37):\n \u00b7 [z-(v+C)](v-D)\nv-D+C\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (36) holds\n \u00b7 [z-(v+C)](v-D)\nv-D+C\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise\nNote that both functions F(v) and G(v) are increasing in v given conversion at par:\nF\nv\n=\nF\nv\n|d=fixed\n+\nF\nd\n\u00b7\nd\nv\n=\nF\nv\n|d=fixed\n+\n(z - (v + C))\n\u00b7\nC\nG\nv\n=\nG\nv\n|d=fixed\n+\nG\nd\n\u00b7\nd\nv\n=\nG\nv\n|d=fixed\n+\n(z - (v + C))\n\u00b7\nC\nwhere F\nv\n|d=fixed\nand F\nv\n|d=fixed\nare given in (17) and (19) accordingly, and z > (v + C) for\nany v\nD\n- C  v\nC\n v\nD\n+ Cy.\nTo disentangle the effect of equity dilution, we assume that introduction of CoCos only\naffects conversion ratio with leverage and yield being fixed. Using implicit function theorem\nfor (10), we show the equity dilution effect on v\nC\n:\nv\nC\nd\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\n=\n-F/d\nF/v\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\nif (9) holds\n-G/d\nG/v\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\notherwise\nwhere F\nv\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\nand G\nv\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\nF\nd\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\n= -\n(z - (v + C))\nG\nd\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\n= -\n(z - (v + C))\nIndependent on (9), v\nC\nd\n|C=fixed,Cy=fixed\n 0 implying that the increase in d through higher\namount of CoCos increases the dilution of the banker's share and increases v\nC\n. We define\nequity dilution effect as the reduction in risk control associated with the change in conversion\nratio compared to the case of write-down CoCos with no conversion into shares v\nP\n,\nwhere v\nP\nis defined by (37) for a paid yield Cy = 0.\nSince higher conversion ratio implies higher risk control, v\nP\n> v\nWD\n.\nProposition 5\nThe proof is based on the one of Lemma 2 for d = C\nvT -D\n. The critical value v\nC\ndepends on\n(45) which describes when v\nC\nis above D + Cy:\n \u00b7\n(z - [D + C(1 + y)](vT\n- D)\nvT\n- D + C\nv\nC\nis defined implicitly in (46):\n \u00b7 [z-(v+C)](vT -D)\nvT -D+C\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (45) holds\n \u00b7 [z-(v+C)](vT -D)\nvT -D+C\n+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise\nNote that fixed conversion d = C\nvT -D\nproduces lower equity dilution to the banker than\nconversion at par with d = C\nv-D\n, since conversion occurs only for v < vT\n. Recall from\nProposition 4 that lower equity dilution results in better risk control. This implies that\nchanging conversion ratio from at par to a fixed one produces better risk control. As a\nresult, v\nC\n< v\nP\n.\nChanging conversion from at par to the fixed one increases the ex ante probability of\nbank risk control 1+-v\nC\n. We call this increase a CoCo dilution effect as the risk control\nincrease associated with the lower equity dilution and value transfer from CoCoholders to\nthe equityholders (banker). We denote it by v\nC\n- v\nP\n, where v\nC\nis defined by\nNote that fixed conversion ratio d = C\nvT -D\ndecreases with vT\n. Thus, if vT\ngoes up, conversion\nratio goes down. From Proposition 5, lower d increases risk control by diluting CoCoholders.\nAs a result, higher vT\nenhances CoCos' risk reduction effect.\nEndogenous yield\nHere we give the implicit conditions for yield from break-even conditions of holders of dif-\nferent forms of debt.\nBail-inable debt\nC =\nB\n\u00b7 C(1 + y) +\nv\nB\n D + Cy|v < v\nB\n+Prob(D - C  V2\n< D + Cy|v < v\nB\n- D + C|D - C  V2\n< D + Cy, v < v\nB\n) .\nWrite-down CoCos\nC =\nB\n\u00b7 C(1 + y) +\nv\nB\n- v\nWD\nv\nWD\n D + Cy|v < v\nWD\nProb(D - C  V2\n< D + Cy|v < v\nWD\n- D + C|D - C  V2\n< D + Cy, v < v\nWD\n) .\nEquity conversion CoCos\nC =\nB\n\u00b7 C(1 + y) +\nv\nB\n- v\nC\n\u00b7 (1 - )C(1 + y) +  \u00b7\nd\n\u00b7 (v - D + C)\nv\nC\n D + Cy|v < v\nC\nProb(D - C  V2\n< D + Cy|v < v\nC\n- D + C|D - C  V2\n< D + Cy, v < v\nC\n) +\n \u00b7 Prob(V2\n> D - C|v < v\nC\n) \u00b7\nd\n- D + C|V2\n> D - C, v < v\nC\n) .\nNext we define the yield of CoCo debt that may convert at maturity.\nCoCos that may convert at t = 2\nC =\nM\n\u00b7 C(1 + y) +\nv\nM\n\u00b7 (1 - F(vM\nT\n)) \u00b7 C(1 + y) +\n(F(vM\nT\n) - F(D - C)) \u00b7\nd\n- D + C|D - C < V2\n< vM\nT\nwhere vM\nT\nis a properly set trigger given implicitly by vT\n= max[D + Cy, v\nM\n].\nProof of Lemma 7\nThe solution to the problem (11) identifies two new critical interim asset values. First, v\nM\nis the risk control threshold for those banks with asset value above the trigger, given as a\nmaximum of D + Cy and the asset value given implicitly by:\nR\nnc\nwhere\nR\nnc\n= (1 - ) \u00b7 [(F(vT\n) - F(D - C)) \u00b7 E\n- D + C\nD - C < V2\n< vT\n+\n- D - Cy|V2\n> vT\nis the bank's payoff under no risk control and no conversion at t = 1.\nSecond, v\nM\nis the risk control threshold for banks with asset value below vT\n, given by :\nR\nnc\n+  \u00b7\nv - z - D + C + (v + C)\n-\nv - D + C\nWe observe that bank's risk control choice is not monotone in its asset value v: banks\nwith v  [vT\n, v\nB\n) still do not control risk (as without CoCos), whereas highly levered banks\nwith asset value v  [v\nM\n, vT\n) choose to exercise risk control. The introduction of CoCos with\nconversion at maturity implies that banks with v  (v\nB\n, v\nM\n] give up on risk control.\nNext we show that v\nM\n v\nB\n. Recall that v\nB\nis implicitly given by max (v - D - Cy, 0) =\nv-z-D-Cy+(v-Cy) from (7), whereas v\nM\nis implicitly given by max (v - D - Cy, 0) =\nR\nnc\nIf R\nnc\n v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy), then the risky payoff is higher for CoCos with\nconversion at t = 2, and it must be that v\nM\n v\nB\n. The difference between those payoffs\nR\nnc\n- v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy) equals to:\n(F(vT\n) - F(D + Cy)) \u00b7 E\n- D + C\nD + Cy  V2\n< vT\n-\n- D - Cy|D + Cy  V2\n< vT\n) +\n(F(D + Cy) - F(D - C)) \u00b7 E\n- D + C\nThe item in the last line is positive.The item in the first two lines is non-negative as soon as\n- D - Cy for the range D + Cy  V2\n< vT\n. It is enough to show that\n- D + C\nwhich for d = C\nvT -D\nis\n- D + C)(vT\n- D)\nvT\n- D + C\n-\n- D)(vT\n- D + C)\nvT\n- D + C\n=\nC(vT\n)\nvT\n- D + C\nwhich is non-negative for V2\n< vT\n. This implies that v\nM\n v\nB\n(equality may occur if both\nthresholds are equal to D + Cy).\nProposition 6\nTo compute the substitution ratio k, we use (10) given v\nC\n= v\nD\n- and C = k :\nF(v\nD\n- |k , d) = 0 if (9) holds\nG(v\nD\n- |k , d) = 0 otherwise\nor equivalently\n\n\u00b7 (z - [v\nD\n+ (k - 1)]) + (1 - ) \u00b7 (z - [v\nD\n\n\u00b7 (z - [v\nD\n+ (k - 1)]) + (1 - ) \u00b7 (z - [v\nD\n- (1 + ky)] - [v\nD\n- D - (1 + ky)]) = 0\nHere we prove that k  1. The proof is by contradiction. Assume that k < 1. Consider\nF(v\nD\n- |k , d) = 0. Note that [v\nD\n- ]  z, since banker with v < v\nD\ndoes not control\nrisk by definition of v\nD\n. Since the whole expression is equal to zero, and the second term is\nnon-negative, the first term should be non-positive. Hence,\n[v\nD\nThis is true only if v  v\nD\n. If k < 1, then v\nD\n+ (k - 1) < v\nD\n. This is a contradiction.\nThe same logic applies to G(v\nD\n- |k , d) = 0, where the second item is also negative, and\neven more smaller than z - [v\nD\n- ].\nThus, it always holds that k  1, and higher amount of CoCos is required to provide the\nsame effect as equity.\nNote that if  = 1, it must be the case that z - [v\nD\n+ (k - 1)] = 0, which is true only\nTo show the effect of  on k, we compute k\n\n. Rewriting (10) using d = k\nv\nD\n-D\n,\nv\nC\n= v\nD\n- and C = k and applying implicit function theorem yields:\nk\n\n=\n-F(v\nD\n- |k )/\nF(v\nD\n- |k )/k\nif (9) holds\n-G(v\nD\n- |k )/\nG(v\nD\n- |k )/k\notherwise\nF(v\nD\n- |k )\nk\nequals to\n \u00b7 (v\nD\n- D) \u00b7\n(k + v\nD\n\u00b7\n\n-(k + v\nD\n- D) \u00b7 k\n[v\nD\n+ (k - 1)]\n- (z - [v\nD\n+ (k - 1)])\n)\n\n\n+(1 - ) y k\n[v\nD\n- (1 + ky)]\nwhere the item in the first line is non-negative for infinitesimal .
