However,\nepidemiologic studies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 have had mixed\nresults and several authors have speculated that quality\ncontrol (QC), sample storage history, and other methodologic\nconcerns could play a role in this heterogeneity. This article\ndocuments the results of storage history and QC efforts for a\nstudy of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in 6,226 serum samples from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III\n(NHANES III). The study was carried out on site at\nDiagnostic Systems Laboratories in Webster, Texas, using\nadiometric assay (DSL 6600). A run-in study of assay\nperformance suggested that plates, days, and weeks signif-\nicantly affected the variance of both assays. Analysis of\nsamples with different storage histories also indicated strong\neffects of storage history. Serum samples disbursed to\nlaboratories for measurement of diverse analytes and then\nreturned for storage showed reductions in serum IGF-I level\naveraging 43% and reductions in IGFBP-3 of 25% compared\nwith samples shipped immediately to the repository for\nlong-term storage at \u00c080\u00b0C. Therefore, the main study was\ncarried out using samples that had been shipped directly to\nthe National Center for Health Statistics/NHANES collection\ncenter for storage. Laboratory analyses of NHANES III and\nQC samples were carried out over f10 months. QC was\nmonitored through repeated testing of blood samples from\nsix individuals, with two individuals tested twice on each\nplate. Assay performance was stable over the entire study\nand coefficients of variation averaged 2% to 3% within plates\nstudy. Coefficients of variation varied significantly among\nplots, f5% of the plates used for IGF-I in the main study were\nout of compliance. Finally, location on a plate had small but\nsignificant effects on IGF-I level. Together, these results\nhighlight the need for care in large studies of putative\nbiomarkers for cancer risk and illustrate some probable\nsources of heterogeneity in past epidemiologic studies of the\nIGF axis and cancer.

Two IGFs (IGF-I and IGF-II) and six specific IGF\nbinding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6) have been identified,\nbut recent epidemiologic research has focused on IGF-I and its\nmain binding protein (IGFBP-3; ref. 1). Both basic and\nepidemiologic studies of IGFs and risk of cancer have been\nmotivated by their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis\nand their place in insulin signaling (2). Results from the\nepidemiologic studies suggest that high levels of IGF-I are\nrelated to increased risk for colorectal (2-4), prostate (5), and\npremenopausal breast cancers (2, 6), although the data are not\nalways consistent (2, 6). There is also considerable interest in\nassociations between IGF levels and cancer risk factors (1),\nincluding breast density (7), alcohol consumption (8, 9), diet\nseems to be related to risk of other diseases, notably ischemic\nheart disease (13) and congestive heart failure (14). In these\nstudies, lower levels of IGF-I have been associated with\nincreased risk.\nClinical tests for IGFs show that current assays are sufficient\nfor diagnosing growth-related deficiencies (15). However,\nepidemiologic studies examine associations of IGF across the\nentire range from low to normal to high values, and therefore\nrequire a higher degree of accuracy and precision in the assay\nperformance than IGF assays used for clinical purposes. The\nsuccess of these epidemiologic studies is dependent on high-\nquality, sensitive laboratory assays that can be done on\nthousands of samples over weeks or months and proper storage\nand sample handling. Some of the variability in results of\nstudies of cancer and IGFs could be due to variability in assay\nperformance or because of differences in assays from different\nvendors (16). Indeed, concerns have been raised about the\nreliability of the current IGF and IGFBP assays (2, 4, 16-19).\nIn this article, we characterize the long-term performance of\ntwo commonly used assays, one for IGF-I and one for IGFBP-3,\nand we report a number of other quality control (QC) results\nrelevant to large studies of IGFs from stored serum samples.\nThese studies were carried out as part of a cross-sectional\nstudy of f6,000 samples from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and included\nanalysis of f700 QC samples.

Second, we report the effects of storage history and\nsample handling on IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in f100\nNHANES III samples that were handled in two different ways\nafter collection. Lastly, we examine the performance of the two\nassays over 6 months during an analysis of the 6,000 samples,\nwhich included f700 control samples obtained from six QC\nsubjects. This extensive QC data set allowed us to document\nindividual and temporal variation in assay performance. These\nresults should be of considerable interest for the design of\nfuture studies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in large cohorts and\nsurveys and should aid in the interpretation of past epidemi-\nologic studies of the IGF axis.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study characterizes the performance of the Diagnostic\nSystem Laboratories (DSL) Inc. (Webster, TX) IGF-I ELISA (DSL\n6600). The IGF-I ELISA is an enzymatically amplified ``one-\nstep'' sandwich-type immunoassay. The assay includes a\nsimple extraction step in which IGF-I is separated from its\nbinding protein in serum. The IGFBP-3 IRMA is a noncompet-\nitive assay in which the analyte to be measured is ``sandwiched''\nbetween two antibodies (20). The first antibody is immobilized\nto the inside walls of the tubes and the other antibody is\nradiolabeled for detection. The analyte present is bound by both\nof the antibodies to form a ``sandwich'' complex.\nAll assays described were done by a single technician at the\nDSL facility in Webster, Texas. For the IGF-I ELISA, a single\nbatch of reagents sufficient for the entire experiment was frozen\nat the study onset. The IGFBP-3 IRMA required fresh batches of\nradioactive tracer every 3 weeks; all other reagents were from a\nsingle lot. Throughout the study, we reanalyzed samples if the\nCV for replicate samples from a single vial was >15%. This was\nrare, as only 10 samples for IGF-I and 2 samples for IGFBP-3 had\nCVs >15% between replicates. The 63 out-of-range IGF-I\nsamples were diluted 50:50 and reanalyzed. Out-of-range\nsamples had values of IGF-I greater than the highest DSL\nlaboratory standard included on each plate.\nThe QC efforts associated with this study had three\ncomponents. First, we did a run-in study, which characterized\nassay performance using recently collected QC samples. The\nQC samples consisted of serum samples from six volunteers\nwho visited the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine\ndonor center. Three of the volunteers were men of ages 23, 38,\nSerum was frozen at \u00c080jC 1 to 3 h after collection. After 1 to\n3 weeks, the serum from each subject was thawed and\nThese samples were used in the pilot study and as QC samples\nduring the analysis of NHANES III subject samples. A factorial\ndesign was used for the run-in study. For each of the six QC\nsubjects, we analyzed duplicate samples from two different\nvials on two plates per day for 3 days in the first week and\n2 days in the following week. This resulted in 240 measure-\nments from 120 vials for IGF-I and IGFBP-3.\nFollowing the run-in study, we conducted a site visit to the\nDSL facility in Webster. A review of the assays led to two small\ntests aimed at determining whether sample dilution or\nradioactive tracer age (I-125, half life = 60.1 days) contributed\nto variance in the initial test results. Although these factors did\nnot conclusively seem to influence our results, we chose to\nreplace the radioactive tracers used for the IRMA every\n3 weeks, 1 week earlier than the recommended time limit for\nthe commercially available kit. We also tested new batches of\nradioactive tracer with our QC samples. None of these tests\nsuggested aberrant assay performance. The run-in study was\nanalyzed using a general linear model that allowed us to\nquantify variance components at the vial, plate, day, and week\nlevels.\nSecond, we tested the effects of sample preparation and\nstorage on 108 NHANES III surplus serum samples; recall that\nThese samples were stored using two different procedures.\nSurplus serum samples were frozen on collection, shipped\ndirectly to testing labs, thawed for analysis of various serum\nfactors, refrozen in \u00c080jC freezers, and made available for\nfurther study. During their time at the testing labs, the surplus\nserum samples may have been frozen and thawed one or more\ntimes for reanalysis and experienced variable periods at\nrefrigerator and room temperature. The exact treatment these\nsamples received is unknown. A second group of samples, the\nliquid nitrogen samples, were frozen on collection, shipped to\nAtlanta, defrosted on an ice table, and aliquoted into four\n0.5-mL vials. Liquid nitrogen samples were then stored in\nliquid nitrogen until released for our study.\nThird, in the main study of f6,000 subjects from the fasting\nsubsample of NHANES III, we analyzed IGF-I and IGFBP-3\nusing the liquid nitrogen samples. Both the liquid nitrogen\nstudy samples and our QC samples experienced two freeze-\nthaw cycles before this study. IGF-I was analyzed on 96-well\nplates. Samples for 36 NHANES III subjects and two samples\nfrom each of two of the QC subjects were analyzed in\nreplicates on each of the plates (72 wells of subject serum,\n8 wells of QC serum, and 16 wells of internal standards). QC\nsubjects were placed on plates at random, but replicate\nsamples from a single vial were adjacent to one another. We\nrecorded location of samples on each plate. The same pairs of\nQC samples (designated A-F for the six individuals) were used\nthroughout the study (A and B, C and D, and E and F).\nSamples were analyzed for IGFBP-3 in batches of coated\ntubes on the same days as the IGF-I samples using the same\nscheme of replication for the NHANES samples and QC subjects\n(i.e., groups of 36 samples and two samples from each of two QC\nsubjects were analyzed in replicate). One to four racks and\nbatches of IGFBP-3 were analyzed on weekdays over the course\nQC subject are not exactly equal because of uneven numbers\nof samples in batches of samples shipped to DSL for analysis\nand because of erroneous QC sample placement in a small\nnumber of batches that resulted in extra assays of certain pairs\nof QC subjects. For example, there were 114 replicates for QC\nsubjects F and E and 140 replicates for subjects A and B.\nStandardized deviates for the QC subjects were computed\nfrom individual values by subtracting the subject's overall\naverage and dividing by the subject's SD as computed across all\navailable plates. For IGF-I, the subject-specific means and SDs\nwere computed from log-transformed values. After analyzing all\nsamples, we used a modified Levy-Jennings approach to identify\noutliers (see below and ref. 22). This approach identified 15\nplates for reanalysis. For 12 of these plates, both IGF-I and\nIGFBP-3 were reanalyzed. In the remaining three plates, only\nIGF-I was reanalyzed because only one IGF-I QC sample was\naberrant (i.e., had a SD >3.0 in absolute value). Plates were\nselected for this reanalysis if the average of the two SDs for each\nQC subject was >1.96 in absolute value for IGF-I or IGFBP-3.\nA new data set was created with 188 plates after the initial\nLevy-Jennings analysis and further QC studies were done,\nincluding construction of additional Levy-Jennings plots to\nidentify plates that were potentially out of compliance. For\nthese additional Levy-Jennings plots, a plate would be classi-\nfied as noncompliant only if the SDs for a given QC subject\nwere either both below or both above some appropriately\nchosen bounds (F c), where c is chosen to give the appropriate\nexperiment-wise error rate. We wanted to ensure that the\n1018 Quality Control for Studies of Serum IGFs\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nprobability (a) of incorrectly classifying one of the 188 plates as\nnoncompliant was small. Let p denote the probability that both\nreplicates (denoted r1\n) for a QC subject fall outside the\nsame (lower or upper) bound strictly by chance:\np \u00bc Pr\u00bd\u00f0r1\n> c and r2\n> c\u00de or \u00f0r1\n< \u00c0c and r2\n< \u00c0c\u00de\n> c and r2\n> c\u00de \u00fe Pr\u00f0r1\n< \u00c0c and r2\n< \u00c0c\u00de\nThe last equality follows from the assumed symmetry of the\ndistributions of SDs, and the next-to-last equality follows from\nthe assumption that the SDs are statistically independent from\none another. The value of p in the above equation is called the\ncomparison-wise error rate because it applies only to one plate.\nBecause we made 188 comparisons per analyte, each with\nprobability p of indicating noncompliance strictly by chance, we\nused a Bonferroni-type adjustment to maintain the so-called\nexperiment-wise error rate a. To ensure a V 0.05, we set p equal\n> c) is equal to the\nthe area under the standard normal curve to the right of c is\nthe Levy-Jennings plots of Fig. 1 corresponds to the aforemen-\ntioned choice of c that holds a < 0.05, whereas the outer pair of\nbounds correspond to a choice of c = 2.56, which holds a < 0.01.\nWe illustrate the results of our QC efforts in three ways.\nFirst, we characterize overall levels of variation in the QC\nsubjects. Second, we graphically illustrate the behavior of\nQC samples using Levy-Jennings plots. Third, we report on the\neffects of position in a plate on estimated serum levels of IGF-I\nusing ANOVA.\nResults\nRun-in Study. Variance components for the run-in and main\nstudy are summarized in Table 1. Note a large between-week\nFigure 1. Modified Levy-Jennings\nplots for six QC subjects over 188\nplates/batches for IGF-I and IGFBP-3\nassays.\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 1019\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\neffect for IGFBP-3 in the run-in study. This was due to a large\ndifference in average values for IGFBP-3 between weeks 1\nand 2 of the run-in. Following a site visit and a change in\nreagent replacement schedule (in subsequent analyses, we\nreplaced the radioactive tracer used in the IGFBP-3 assay every\n3 weeks), the between-week effect was no longer present. We\nalso considered the possibility that sample dilution would\nimprove assay performance by improving antibody binding\nefficiency. We found no evidence for this in comparisons of\nanalyses with and without a 50% dilution of QC samples\n(results not shown).\nEffect of Storage Conditions. Following the site visit,\nsamples subject to two different storage conditions were\nanalyzed (Fig. 2). Paired t tests indicate significantly lower\nvalues for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in samples sent to laboratories for\nthe original NHANES III laboratory assays (surplus serum\nsamples) than those sent directly to Atlanta for storage (liquid\nnitrogen samples). The liquid nitrogen samples were frozen,\nshipped directly to National Center for Health Statistics\ncollection center, thawed, aliquoted, and then stored in liquid\nnitrogen for 10 to 16 years until the current study. The surplus\nserum samples were stored at \u00c080jC but could have experi-\nenced multiple freeze-thaw cycles and unknown amounts of\ntime at refrigerator or room temperature at the laboratories\nwhere the standard NHANES III serum analyses were done.\nThe mean difference for IGF-I was 129 ng/mL (95% confidence\nvalues in the liquid nitrogen stored specimens, these corre-\nspond to 43% and 25% reductions, respectively. Degradation\nwas not associated with age or race/ethnicity in either analyte,\nbut degradation of IGFBP-3 was somewhat (P = 0.035) higher in\nwere done entirely on the liquid nitrogen specimens.\nSamples included in the 12 plates selected for reanalysis for\nboth IGF-I and IGFBP-3 indicated that an additional freeze-\nthaw cycle did not influence levels of either analyte, confirm-\ning previous studies of these assays (19) and suggesting that\nextended time spent at room temperature may be more\nimportant for IGF degradation than an additional freeze thaw\ncycle.\nAssay Performance. Log transformation resulted in a close\nto normal distribution of SDs for IGF-I. Transformation did\nnot improve the fit of IGFBP-3 SDs. The distributions of SDs\nfor each analyte had a mean of zero and a variance of 1, and\nwere fairly symmetrical (Fig. 3). Results for the six QC subjects\nthroughout the entire 188 plates analyzed during the main\nstudy period are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in\nFig. 1. Note that these results are based on analyses of means\nof two replicates for each QC subjects. Coefficients of variance\nbetween replicate samples from a single vial were very low\nused in all subsequent analyses. Variances within subjects\ndiffered significantly (Bartlett's test) for both IGF-I (P < 0.001)\nand IGFBP-3 (P < 0.001) in this analysis and CVs ranged from\n(Table 2). Between-subject effects accounted for 82.7% and\n86.2% of variance for IGF-I and IGFBP-3, respectively\n(Table 2). We observed significant effects of day (2-4% of total\nvariance) and plate (f5% of total variance) on assay\nperformance (Table 1). Thus, samples should be analyzed on\nthe same plate and on the same day to the extent possible.\nPlate effects were somewhat larger than day effects, especially\nfor IGFBP-3.\nWe also examined the possibility of variation in IGF-I assay\nresults based on location on the ELISA plate. We found some\nevidence for a location effect. Samples in the outer rows of the\nplates had higher levels of IGF-I, adjusted for between-subject\nvariation (P = 0.0482). However, the magnitude of this effect\nwas small, as the least square mean IGF-I level in wells in the\nouter rows was 246.8 (SE, 1.7) but slightly lower in inner wells\nwith QC subject, position, and subject by position as\nindependent variables and IGF-I level as the dependent\nvariable.\nDiscussion\nThis study characterized the performance of commonly used\nassays for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in the context of a large cross-\nsectional study of serum samples.

First, the performance of the assay\ncan vary significantly by plate/batch, day, and week of the\nassay. Samples must be randomized over the time required for\nanalysis. Importantly, studies of matched samples should\nanalyze matches on the same plates. Second, sample degrada-\ntion may occur due to handling issues such as freeze-thaw\ncycles, time spent at room temperature during sample\naliquoting for other assays, or storage conditions. Careful\nefforts to quantify and minimize sample degradation are\nrequired. The present study and other recent studies of\nchildren and adults (e.g., refs. 23, 24) will provide reference\nvalues for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and preliminary measurements\ncan be used to determine whether sample degradation has\noccurred. Third, the DSL ELISA for IGF-I and IRMA for\nIGFBP-3 showed good temporal stability. This is important\nfor large-cohort or surveillance studies that require months for\ncomplete analysis.\nCVs for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were comparable to other recent\nstudies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 using DSL kits. For example,\nRinaldi et al. (16) report intrabatch and interbatch CVs of 6.3%\nELISAs, and Hankinson et al. (25) report interbatch and\nfor IGFBP-3, respectively. Variation in IGF-I in this study was a\nlittle higher than past studies but variation in IGFBP-3 was\nlower. We cannot determine whether this is due to differences\nin sample characteristics or assay performance. Somewhat\nlower CVs have been reported in some studies (26); again, it is\ndifficult to determine whether this was due to assay\nperformance, laboratory differences, or sample characteristics.\nFewer studies have used the DSL IGFBP-3 IRMA, but one\narticle reports intra-assay and interassay CVs of 3.9% and\n1.9%, respectively (27). Larger studies and those with longer\nduration seem to have higher CVs. These relatively high CVs\nand evidence for heterogeneity within individuals clearly\nsuggest that improvements in laboratory practice, careful\nsample handling procedures, and improved assays would be\nwelcome for both analytes. Finally, note that CVs between\nreplicates within a plate were very low (f2%) for both IGF-I\nand IGFBP-3.\nOverall, these assays showed moderately high CVs for both\nanalytes. Comparison with past studies is not always easy\nbecause very few details are given about QC efforts and\nanalysis in many epidemiologic studies involving IGFs or\nother serum components. A little more detail about QC and\nsample storage conditions in such studies could help improve\ncomparisons among studies and assessment of study quality.\nVariation in assay performance has been suggested as a cause\nof heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies of associations\nbetween cancer and the IGF system (2, 28), and a recent study\nsuggests that the performance of a commonly used DSL ELISA\nfor IGFBP-3 may have changed over time (16). Better methods\nof measuring biologically relevant aspects of the IGF system in\nserum and in specific tissues are needed to improve our\nunderstanding of the epidemiology of cancer and the IGF\nsystem.\nSample degradation can be a problem for studies of serum\nanalytes with long, complex storage histories. Time at room\ntemperature, storage temperature, and number of freeze-thaw\ncycles have been suggested as potential factors influencing\nin shipping before freezing samples reduced IGFBP-3 levels by\n3% (18), but IGF-I and IGFBP-3 seemed to be stable in response\nto five freeze-thaw cycles in a study (26) using IRMA from\nDSL. We are unaware of studies examining the interactive\neffects of freeze-thaw cycles, time at room temperature, and\nduration of storage. In any case, careful attention should be\npaid to storage history, and our experiences clearly indicate\nthat a subset of representative samples should be tested before\nembarking on a large study. Detailed records of sample history\nwould facilitate assessment of potential causes of sample\ndegradation. Lastly, availability of reference values from\ndiverse studies should help in the evaluation of sample\nintegrity.\nThis article highlights the need for careful consideration of\nsample storage and handling history, and it documents the\nperformance of commonly used assays for IGF-I and IGFBP-3\nin a large cross-sectional study that included subjects\nTable 2.

Assay performance was stable\nover time but CVs of f10% for both analytes will reduce study\npower. On the other hand, both analytes have substantial\nbetween-person variability, potentially allowing assessment of\nassociations between the IGF axis and the demographic,\nbehavioral, and health-related variables. These results should\nhelp guide the design and analysis of future studies of IGF-I\nand IGFBP-3, candidate biomarkers of cancer risk, and\npotential targets for chemopreventive interventions at several\nsites.\n"
