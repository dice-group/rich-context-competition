Those favoring biological approaches have been accused of a greater willingness to accept biological\nexplanations so as to rationalize or justify the status quo of inequality. Those rejecting biological approaches have been accused of\nan unwillingness to accept biological explanations so as to attribute inequalities solely to social and institutional factors, ultimately\nallowing for the possibility of social equality.

Many have argued that such character-\nistics make it impossible to disentangle the roles of culture and\nbiology in the phylogenetic story of humans and the ontoge-\nMcKinnon & Silverman, 2005a). Under this argument, it is not\nsimply that such a goal is logistically unattainable, but that such\nendeavors are meaningless: In humans, the biological is inex-\ntricably cultural and the cultural biological. In other academic\nfields, extreme forms of social constructionism have eliminated\nthe consideration of biological factors entirely (Sayer, 1997).\nObviously, complex phylogenetic and ontogenetic pro-\ncesses cannot be captured by the single dimension of nature\nversus nurture, genetic versus environment, and so on. For\nmany phenomena, such a dimension would prove nonsensical\nin its mutually exclusive, linear form. However, the debate that\ndivides the social sciences is more specific.\nWhen biologists refer to gene\u00adenvironment interactions,\nmany types of environmental factors can influence outcomes:\nintrauterine hormonal levels, salinity of interstitial fluids,\nenergy availability, and so on. However, as the debate has\nplayed out in academic journals and popular publications,\nmany of these factors (such as intrauterine hormonal levels)\nwould likely be conceptually placed on the biological side of\nthe ledger. The environmental factors that are relevant are\ntypically those relating to experiential influences--those\nderived from what an individual experiences through his or her\nsenses through time. This includes one's upbringing, schooling,\nand cultural environment. Even when limiting the discussion to\nthese factors, one's experiences and biological processes con-\ntinue to interact to define an intertwined developmental trajec-\ntory. However, the overarching spectrum of possibilities\nbecomes limited, and we can more meaningfully characterize\nthe debate in a more limited question: To what degree, do\nbiological processes constrain humans' remarkable cultural\nand behavioral responsiveness to experiential variance? And\nthe question explored here, therefore, is what explains the\nremarkable variation in academics' interpretations of data\nrelating to this question?\nFor those who still question the meaningfulness of suggest-\ning that a trait is more or less biologically constrained (i.e.,\nenvironmentally canalized) than another, perhaps a look at the\ntails would be helpful. There are a number of traits for which\nthere is less doubt that selection played a role in shaping their\nexpression and that genetically determined biologically pro-\ncesses play a role in constraining their development. These\ninclude the aversion to the smell of vomit on one's food, pre-\nferring to be exposed to room temperatures rather than arctic\ntemperatures, perceiving the act of sex to feel more pleasant\nthan being stabbed, and the consequent motivation to pursue\nsex more than being stabbed. On the other hand, there are many\ntraits for which there is little doubt that biological processes do\nnot play a large role in constraining their development such as\nthe sound used to represent the concept of \"tree,\" the aesthetic\npreference for a certain hair length on men, and the feeling of\nembarrassment when one's bare legs are seen by others. Obvi-\nously, there are some biological constraints such as the fact that\nhumans must be able to produce and hear the sound represent-\ning \"tree,\" grow hair to a certain length, and be able to inter-\nnalize norms and feel shame when they are broken. But within\nthose broad constraints, the possibility that any particular pre-\nference might emerge through a cultural process of historical\nhappenstance is indeed real.\nInferential Power (IP) of Different Study Designs\nIf there is fair agreement at the tails, this would suggest that\nthere is some degree of evidence and/or cogency of argument\nthat satisfies most parties and that the debate likely rests on\nvariance in the inferential thresholds demanded before infer-\nring biological constraints. This raises the question of how we\ninfer a biological influence (Andrews, Gangestad, & Matthews,\n2002). A preference to not be exposed to the arctic cold is\ncross-culturally universal; it appears early in development, can\nbe seen in other animals, and serves a clear adaptive purpose.\nNone of those things can be said for long hair on men. Thus,\ndespite not knowing the genetic or biological etiology of a\ncognitive motivation to seek warmth--a common critique of\nbiological explanations--most are comfortable with assigning\na biological foundation to a preference for warmth over freez-\ning. There are a number of research designs (RDs) that are used\nto examine the role of biology in the development of a partic-\nular trait. Referenced above, these include explorations of\ncross-cultural universality (Buss, 1989; Eagly & Wood,\nThompson & Newton, 2013), animal homologs/analogs (Plav-\ndesign (Gould & Lewontin, 1979; Oaten, Stevenson, & Case,\nallelic associations (Hamer, Hu, Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci,\n`, Yalcin, Willis-Owen, & Flint, 2008), hormonal\nassociations (Gettler, McDade, Feranil, & Kuzawa, 2011;\nMehta, Jones, & Josephs, 2008), and heritability (Polderman\nThere likely exists disagreement concerning the IP of these\ndifferent designs and this might explain some of the variance in\nthe degree to which researchers believe biology plays a role in\nthe development of human traits. Unfortunately, no study to my\nknowledge has explored how researchers differ in their inter-\npretations according to their outlook on biological influences.\nThis is one of the goals of this study.\nConfirmation Bias\nIn addition to epistemological differences, researchers on both\nsides of the debate have alleged that the disagreements stem\nfrom ideological biases. Those who believe biological\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\ninfluences to be unimportant often allege that the other side is\nmotivated to rationalize at best, and justify at worst, current and\nhistorical patterns of hegemony, social dominance, and\ninequality. This argument harkens back to the beginning of the\nsociobiology debates, summarized in the collective response of\nan early Harvard study group which evaluated the merits of\nsociobiology, and which included intellectual giants like\nStephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin, \"[T]hey consistently\ntend to provide a genetic justification of the status quo and of\nexisting privileges for certain groups according to class, race,\nor sex\" (Allen et al., 1975). The argument continues today and\nis evident in writings across multiple disciplines:\nMany researchers use [evolutionary approaches to the study of\ninternational relations] to justify the status quo in the guise of\nThe totality [of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology]\nis a myth of origin that is compelling precisely because it reso-\nnates strongly with Euro American presuppositions about the\nnature of the world. (McKinnon & Silverman, 2005a, p. 4)\n. . . in the social sciences (with the exception of primatology\nand psychology) sociobiology appeals most to right-wing social\nConversely, those who favor biological approaches have\nargued that those on the other side are rendered incapable of\nobjective assessment by their ideological promotion of equal-\nity. They are alleged to erroneously reject evidence of biologi-\ncal influences because such evidence suggests that social\noutcomes are partially explained by biology, and this might\ninhibit the realization of equality. Their critiques of biological\napproaches are therefore often blithely dismissed as examples\nof the moralistic/naturalistic fallacy. This line of reason is\nexemplified in the quote by biologist Jerry Coyne\nIf you can read the [major Evolutionary Psychology review\npaper] and still dismiss the entire field as worthless, or as a\nmere attempt to justify scientists' social prejudices, then I'd\nsuggest your opinions are based more on ideology than judi-\nAgain, such claims are quite common:\nFor critics, the heart of the intellectual problem remains an\nideological adherence to the increasingly implausible view that\nhuman behavior is strictly determined by socialization. . . . -\nShould [social] hierarchies result strictly from culture, then the\npossibilities for an egalitarian future were seen to be as open\nand boundless as our ever-malleable brains might imagine.\nLike the Church, a number of contemporary thinkers have\nalso grounded their moral and political views in scientific\nassumptions about . . . human nature, specifically that there isn't\nAlthough we academics like to believe that we approach\ndebates with an open mind, that we objectively weigh the\nevidential support for competing arguments, and that we are\nalways prepared to change our beliefs upon the presentation of\nsufficient evidence, a great deal of research suggests that the\ncognitive game is fixed (Nickerson, 1998; Snyder & Swann,\noften clouded by a confirmation bias--in its broad definition,\nconfirmation bias is the tendency to advantage preexisting\nbeliefs through many forms of inferential acrobatics\n(Nickerson, 1998). We actively seek confirmatory evidence\nand avoid disconfirmatory evidence (Jonas, Schulz-Hardt,\nthis confirmatory evidence more readily (Stanovich et al.,\n2013). More importantly here, we accept confirmatory evi-\ndence more readily and weight its inferential value more\nheavily, while being overly critical or dismissive of discon-\nfirmatory evidence (often referred to as a \"disconfirmation\nbias\"; Lehner, Adelman, Cheikes, & Brown, 2008; Nickerson,\nWhile it is important to engage in research and debate that\nadvances our understanding of how biological factors influence\nthe development of behavioral and psychological outcomes, it\nis also important to examine the validity of these alleged biases.\nPrevious research has shown that those who self-identify as\npolitical radicals or feminists are more likely to reject biologi-\ncal influences on human traits (Horowitz & Yaworsky, 2014;\nSanderson & Ellis, 1992), while others have found academic\nproponents of biological approaches to be no less liberal on\npolitical issues (with both groups being far more liberal than\nthe population at large; Lyle & Smith, 2012; Tybur, Miller, &\nGangestad, 2007). However, while a finding of an association\nwith political outlook might suggest the possibility of an ideo-\nlogical bias in interpretations, it does not shed light on which\nside, if either or if both, is indeed biased. To answer this ques-\ntion, we must examine the interpretations of results that differ\nsolely on the degree to which they support or fail to support the\npreexisting ideological beliefs that allegedly drive these biases.\nI attempt this here.\nHypotheses\nIt is entirely possible that confirmation bias plays no role in\ndriving this disagreement and that the overarching debate in\nacademia is driven by sincere disagreements concerning the\ninferential value of the RDs informing the debate. Although\nacademics might believe that inferential logic is universal and\nabundantly clear, biological systems are inconceivably com-\nplex, and it is unlikely that we will ever reach a consensus on\nthe meaningfulness of large bodies of research. While no pre-\ndictions can be made concerning which RDs should be per-\nceived as holding more or less IP, we can at least predict that\nthose who believe biology to play a more important role (for\nconvenience, we will dichotomize this belief and label this\ngroup \"bioists\") should report that positive results, across a\nrange of RDs, would carry more inferential weight than that\nreported by participants who believe biology to be less relevant\n(\"skeptics\"; Hypothesis 1a; Table 1). Similarly, skeptics should\nreport that null results carry more inferential weight than bio-\nists report (Hypothesis 1b). Such effects should be evident even\nwhen reviewing the IP of generic RD descriptions, without\nviewing any specific results.\nIf ideological biases are driving this debate, then it must be\nthe case that bioists and skeptics differ in their ideological\noutlook. Based on the alleged biases, we can predict that com-\npared to skeptics, bioists should report a more conservative\norientation, particularly with regard to causes of social strati-\nfication and efforts to reverse it (Hypothesis 2). That is to say,\ncompared to skeptics, bioists will report that social outcomes\nare based more on inherent differences as opposed to social\nforces and less should be done to reduce inequalities.\nIdeological confirmation biases would be suggested if the\ninferential value assigned to the results were associated with\nthe degree to which those studies supported a particular ideol-\nogy, holding all else constant. For instance, results suggesting\nthat a socially undesirable trait was associated with a biolo-\ngical antecedent that occurred more frequently in a disadvan-\ntaged population should evoke a positive ideological\nconfirmation bias in bioists and a disconfirmation bias in\nskeptics. Thus, bioists should rate studies suggesting such a\nscenario as having a higher inferential value than those that\nreport such an association but do not mention relative\nfrequencies in advantaged versus disadvantaged groups\n(Hypothesis 3a), as well as studies that mention that such\nantecedents occur in higher frequencies in advantaged groups\n(Hypothesis 4a). The opposite effects should occur among\nskeptics (Hypotheses 3b and 4b, respectively).\nRD and Methods\nA convenience sample was recruited to take part in online\nQualtrics surveys through Amazon's MTurk and through\nsocial media sites. Only those who had received a master's\ndegree or higher in the biological sciences, social sciences, or\nrelevant humanities were included. Two separate surveys\nwere conducted, an RD survey and IP (IP) survey. In both,\nthose entering through MTurk were offered US$0.10 to\nanswer a series of eligibility questions. If they were deemed\neligible, they were allowed to continue and received a\nUS$1.00 bonus for their participation. Social media\nannouncements were made via Facebook pages of relevant\ngroups (Biological Anthropology Society, Evolutionary\nAnthropology Society, and Evolutionary Psychology).\nE-mails were also sent out to eligible acquaintances with the\ninstructions to forward the e-mail to anyone they thought\nmight be eligible. This was done in part because of the lower\nnumber of biologically oriented researchers on MTurk. Social\nmedia recruits were offered to take part in a lottery in which 1\nin 50 would win a US$50 Amazon gift certificate. The RD\nsurvey was conducted in June 2015, and the IP survey was\nInclusion Criteria\nOnly participants who reported a master's or PhD in a relevant\nfield were included. These fields included the social sciences,\nbiological sciences, gender studies, and philosophy.

There-\nfore, in addition to the degree and discipline requirements, a\nnumber of additional inclusion criteria were used to ensure that\nparticipants were completing the survey appropriately.\nParticipants were asked two timed questions (30 s) regard-\ning knowledge specific to academia to ensure honesty concern-\ning reported educational level. One question focused on the\nfinal research product for a master's degree (a thesis) and the\nother on the meaning of \"curriculum vitae.\" In a previous sur-\nvey of 256 MTurk participants who were not told of any edu-\nholders answered both of these questions correctly, while only\nTable 1.

Only those who answered both questions\ncorrectly were included in the surveys used here.\nFurthermore, MTurk participants were excluded if they fin-\nished the survey in under 6 min for the RD survey and under 9\nmin for the IP survey. This was based on the fastest times (6.7\nmin for RD and 9.3 min for IP) for completion among the social\nmedia sample, which was expected to not include\n\"professional\" survey takers. An attention check question was\nincluded; however, 17% of participants who answered incor-\nrectly did not significantly differ in the amount of time spent\ntaking the survey, and it was therefore not used as an exclu-\nsionary factor. Finally, Reddit's \"HitsWorthTurkingFor\" page\nwas regularly searched to ensure that inclusion criteria were not\nbeing discussed. The IP survey was discussed on this site 4\ntimes, resulting in drastic increases in the frequency of partici-\npants. Participants who completed the survey directly after\nsuch postings were excluded.\nSurveys\nThe RD and IP surveys (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2)\nbegin with four identical sections. These include questions\ncovering participants' prior beliefs concerning the role of bio-\nlogy in influencing human behavior and psychology, political\nbeliefs, epistemological approaches, and statistical knowledge.\nSpecifically, participants were asked where they place them-\nselves on the \"general spectrum that exists in academia con-\ncerning the role of biological factors in determining\npsychological and behavioral patterns in humans.\" Provided\nwith a 4-point scale, participants were forced to choose which\nside of the spectrum they placed themselves. For all other\nquestions with ordinal responses, participants chose from a\n7-point scale for scales that had a meaningful center (e.g.,\nextremely liberal\u00adextremely conservative); otherwise, a 5-point\nscale was used.\nIn the RD survey, participants were then presented with\neight RDs and asked to rate the inferential value of significant\nresults regarding the role of biology in influencing psycholo-\ngical and behavioral traits and the influential value of null\nresults regarding the lack of a role of biology. Participants used\nIn the IP survey, participants were instead presented with\nthree mock data plots that were designed to appear, as if they\nwere scanned from a legitimate academic journal or confer-\nence poster (due to reasons described in the section below,\ndata from only one of these proved useful). Participants then\nread a brief synopsis of the findings and conclusions of the\nstudy and were asked to rate the inferential value of the study\nregarding the role of biology in influencing the outcome of the\ntrait in question. Participants used a sliding scale from 0 to\n100 as in the RD survey. Participants were also asked to rate\nthe psychological complexity of each trait and how socially\npreferred they believed the trait to be. At the end of the sur-\nvey, participants were asked whether they were suspicious\nthat the results were forged and whether they believed this\ninfluenced their responses.\nMock Results\nThe original study design included tests of both positive and\nnull results. However, the mock null results included psycho-\nlogical traits that participants found too different to be mean-\ningfully comparable and are not used here. Similarly, one\ncondition employing mock positive results included a psycho-\nlogical trait that was deemed to be significantly more complex\nthan the others and was excluded from the study. A full descrip-\ntion of these can be found in the Online Supplemental Material.\nThe remaining three conditions are described below.\nThe creation of the mock results was based on a number of\ncriteria. Psychological traits were considered based on (1) degree\nof social preference and (2) familiarity to participants while not\nbeing the subject of a large, well-known bodies of literature\nfocusing on their genetic and biological associates (e.g., general\nintelligence, schizophrenia). Based on the results from the RD\nsurvey, mock results were created using three RDs that were\ndeemed to have high IP. The designs were presented pseudoran-\ndomly (16 sequences). As described above and in the Online Sup-\nplementary Material, data from only one RD are reported on here.\nThe mock results suggesting a biological influence were\nbased on a genetic allele design, which was rated as having the\nthird highest IP out of eight. Participants were presented with a\nplot showing a substantial association (Cohen's d \u00bc .86)\nbetween a particular allele and appetitive aggression. In the\nfirst condition, the allele was described as being found in\nhigher frequency in populations with African ancestry. In the\nsecond condition, this language was absent, and in the third\ncondition, it was described as being found in higher frequency\nin populations with European ancestry. Appetitive aggression\nwas described as \"pro-active and predatory aggres-\nsion . . . associated with things such as likelihood of committing\nviolence and positive attitudes towards warfare.\" By including\nreferences to both \"violence\" and \"warfare,\" such a trait can be\nreasonably aligned with negative stereotypes or perceptions\nassociated with African American culture (Devine, 1989;\nAfter participants rated the IP of each set of results, they\nwere asked how socially preferred they believed the relevant\ntrait to be on a scale ranging from \u00c03 to 3. They were also\nasked how psychologically complex they believed it to be\nusing a 5-point scale.\nAnalysis\nSimple comparisons of bioist and skeptic measures are analyzed\nusing Wilcoxon rank tests for ordinal data and t tests for\ncontinuous ratings. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)\ntests are employed for tests involving multiple dependent ratings.\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS Version 9.3.\nResults\nOf the 327 participants who began the RD survey, 60 were\nexcluded for not having the appropriate educational level,\n124 were excluded for working in a field that was not included,\n36 were excluded for not answering the academia questions\ncorrectly, 15 were excluded for taking the survey too quickly,\nand 21 were excluded for not finishing the survey, leaving 71\nincluded. Of the 2,631 participants who began the IP survey,\nacademia questions, 231 for taking it too quickly, 610 for hav-\ning started the survey after a Reddit post, and 94 for not com-\npleting the survey, leaving 365 included. Table 2 presents the\ndescriptive results for the two data sets. The RD survey\nincluded only one condition and thus required a much smaller\nsample size. Most participants could thus be recruited from\nsocial media. The sample also has a higher proportion who\nhave doctorates, are anthropologists, and are faculty.\nWhen asked to place themselves on the broad spectrum in\nacademia regarding their opinion on the role of biology in\ninfluencing the development of behavioral and psychological\ntraits, participants appear to have segregated themselves cor-\nrectly. Across the four options, there is a linear increase in the\nreported degree to which participants believe biology com-\npared to experience to be important in the development of\nboth general traits and in sex differences (Figure 1, from IP\nsurvey). Because of the small sample sizes at the tails, the four\ngroups were collapsed into two groups for both surveys: bio-\nists and skeptics.\nExploring only the IP survey, there was no difference in the\nreported familiarity with statistical tests across four areas (gen-\neral statistical knowledge, t tests, correlations, and p values).\nBioists did, however, report a stronger quantitative/empirical\norientation as opposed to a qualitative/interpretive orientation\ncompared to skeptics (on a 5-point scale, bioists \nskeptics \nIP of RDs\nFigure 2 presents the reported IP of eight different RDs in\ndescending order of pooled average for both significant (a) and\nnull (b) results.

For seven of the eight RDs, bioists' ratings were\nhigher than those of skeptics for positive results. The effect was\nnot significant, however, using either a sum of standardized\nratings (bioists \np \u00bc .292) or an MANOVA of standardized ratings (F \u00bc\n0.91, p \u00bc .517). Similarly, for seven of the eight RDs, skeptics'\nratings were higher than those of bioists for null results. The\neffect attained one-tailed significance as a test of the summed\nstandardized ratings (bioists \neffects are in the predicted direction, Hypothesis 1a was not\nsupported and there is only tentative support for Hypothesis 1b.\nPolitical Orientation\nThe four questions referencing political orientation exhibited\nfair agreement (a \u00bc .79, n \u00bc 365). These included the impor-\ntance of reducing inequality, whether social position was deter-\nmined by inherent traits versus social forces, and where\nparticipants placed themselves on the social and the economic\npolitical spectrum. Bioists and skeptics did not differ substan-\ntially in an index consisting of the sum of these responses (bio-\np \u00bc .596). Nor do the two groups differ along any individual\nresponse (Figure 3). Thus, Hypothesis 2 is not supported.\nConfirmation Bias\nIn all three conditions, participants were shown the same\nfigure.

Political orientations.\nafter controlling for condition, adding some weight to\nHypothesis 1a (albeit post hoc weight). While such effects\nare indicative of a true disagreement in the inferential value\nof such results, it is possible that they result from ontological\nconfirmation biases, as well--that is to say, confirmation\nbiases that exist due to preexisting beliefs, irrespective of\nideology (e.g., that flossing prevents gingivitis).\nSimilar to findings reported in related studies (Lyle & Smith,\ndiffer in their political views, failing to support Hypothesis 2.\nThe remaining hypotheses (Hypotheses 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b) were\nnot supported either. Participants' perceptions of inferential\nvalue did not vary by the degree to which results supported a\nparticular ideology, suggesting that ideological confirmation\nbias is not affecting participant perceptions of inferential value.\nThere are a number of potential shortcomings that could be\naddressed in future research. The high variance in reported\ninferential values and the modest sample sizes lead to relatively\nlow power in these tests, and thus, a null effect cannot be\ndeclared with great confidence. For most tests, only modest\neffect sizes could be detected with an 80% probability.

Those who pursue a career path in aca-\ndemia might follow the literature more closely and have stron-\nger opinions on the role of biology and on equality, such that\nideological confirmation biases become more significant. In\nthe IP sample, those working in research or teaching reported\nbeing more aware of the research relevant to the debate (5-point\nscale, academics: \none of the \"extreme\" options on the 4-point scale (1 or 4)\nconcerning biological versus experiential orientation (aca-\n5.51, p \u00bc .019). A similar RD relying solely on engaged aca-\ndemics might therefore produce different results. For instance,\ne-mail mailing lists from relevant academic societies could be\nsampled. These lists tend to number in the thousands, allowing\nfor the creation of a list large enough to overcome the low\nresponse rates associated with cold requests.\nAs described in the Online Supplementary Material, the\nsurvey included assessments of mock results aimed at explor-\ning interpretations of null effects as well. However, participants\ndid not rate the complexity or the social desirability of the\nassociated psychological traits in ways that allowed for mean-\ningful comparisons. Future studies could rely on a pilot study\nwhich would include the ratings of a battery psychological\ntraits so that comparable traits could be paired. It would be\nnecessary to take into account the many factors, described\nearlier, that would make a trait more or less appropriate for a\nsuch a study--psychological complexity, social desirability,\npresence of existing literature on the topic, believability, and\nso on. Fortunately, the tests that remained meaningful, those\nfocusing on appetitive aggression, were those that provided the\ncleanest tests of ideological bias. In these, the only differences\nbetween treatments were small amounts of text that greatly\naltered the degree to which the results conformed to the alleged\nideological biases.\nThe presentation of the mock results was perhaps more\nsuccessful. Twenty-nine percent of participants were com-\npletely unaware that the results were fake, and an additional\n26% were only a little suspicious. Despite this, only 15% of\nparticipants believed that their responses were affected more\nthan a little by these suspicions. Fewer than 1% believed their\nsuspicions affected their responses \"very much.\"\nUltimately, this study did not find any evidence of confir-\nmation bias, despite the common allegations that have been\nlodged by both sides for some time. Regardless of one's posi-\ntion, it is important to remind scholars that if they believe a\ngroup of intelligent and informed academics could be so\nunknowingly blinded by ideology that they wholeheartedly\nsubscribe to an unquestionably erroneous interpretation of an\nentire body of research, then they must acknowledge they\nthemselves are equally as capable of being so misguided. And\nwhile it is likely that biases do to some degree impact research-\ners' interpretation of individual results and collective litera-\ntures, it is also very likely that the overarching debate is also\ndriven by true, lucid, well-informed disagreements about the\nnature by which complex traits develop.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The open\nTable 4.
