The\npresent study tested the in vitro efficacy of ceftazidime or imipenem combined with amikacin,\nlevofloxacin and colistin in P.aeruginosa isolates.\nMethods: P.aeruginosa strains, isolated from clinical samples, were assessed for antibiotic\nsusceptibility using the disc diffusion method. Antibiotic combination tests were performed using\nminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips and the sum of the Fractional Inhibitory\nConcentration (\u00c6FIC) index was used to assess synergy.\nstrains) were multidrug resistant. MIC50 and MIC90 values were 2 and 32 mg/ml for imipenem; 1.5\n1.5 mg/ml for colistin, respectively. Antagonism was not found in any of the antibiotic combinations\ntested. The amikacin\u00adceftazidime combination was found to have a synergistic effect in 15% of the\nstrains, but no synergistic effect was detected for other combinations.\nConclusions: In Pseudomonas infection, alternative treatment options using different antibiotic\ncombinations should be tested in vitro and findings should be confirmed by clinical studies.\n",

It is therefore important to\nensure guidelines are constantly updated\nwith information on the changing resistance\nrates.\nIn the present study, various antibiotic\ncombinations were tested in vitro for their\neffectiveness against P. aeruginosa, with the\naim of updating information on resistance\nrates for several widely used antibiotic com-\nbinations, and to provide data on the\neffectiveness of new combinations.\nGuideline-recommended combinations,6 in\naddition to novel combinations including\ncolistin (a recently introduced drug that is\nunderutilized in combination tests), were\nused in the present study.\nMaterials and methods\nIdentification of bacteria\nThis study included P. aeruginosa strains\nisolated from hospitalized patients treated at\nThe Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep\nUniversity, Sahinbey Research and\nTraining Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey,\nNo investigation was undertaken regarding\nthe origins of each pathogen and whether or\nnot the infections were nosocomial.

For antibiotics used in combination,\nthe first antibiotic was designated `A' and\nthe second `B'.

Amikacin was found to\nbe the second most-effective antibiotic, and\nmultidrug resistant.\nResistance to an antibiotic used for treat-\nment more commonly develops in P. aeru-\nginosa infections compared with other\nbacteria, and antibiotic monotherapy is fre-\nquently associated with treatment difficulties\ncompared with combination regimens.2\nThus, combined antibiotic therapy is usually\nadministered for treating P. aeruginosa\nTable 2.

In the\npresent study, the MIC test strip method\nwas chosen for ease of performance and\nevaluation, and because of ready access to\nthe test strips relating to the antibiotics\nundergoing investigation.\nIn the present study, amikacin\u00adceftazi-\ndime and amikacin\u00adimipenem combinations\nwere tested to explore the synergistic effects\nof an aminoglycoside/b-lactam combin-\nation, but such an effect was only observed\nfor amikacin\u00adceftazidime (in 15% of iso-\nlates). Synergistic interactions involving\nthese combinations have been reported in\nUse of b-lactam and fluoroquinolone in\ncombination (ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin)\nhas increased considerably, and synergistic\neffects have been reported.20 A study of\nP. aeruginosa found a synergistic effect for\nimipenem\u00adciprofloxacin in 3.1% of strains,\nno synergistic effect for imipenem\u00adlevo-\nfloxacin, a synergistic effect for merope-\nnem\u00adciprofloxacin in 6.2% of strains, and\nno synergistic effect for meropenem\u00adlevo-\nfloxacin.26 In the present study, levofloxacin\nwas chosen to represent quinolones and the\nefficacies of levofloxacin\u00adceftazidime and\nlevofloxacin\u00adimipenem combinations were\ninvestigated. No synergistic effect was found\nfor levofloxacin\u00adceftazidime in any of the\nstrains tested. Similarly, there was no syn-\nergistic effect for the levofloxacin\u00adimipenem\ncombination. These results suggest that an\nantibiotic combination involving levofloxa-\ncin may not be the most suitable first-line\ntreatment option in the hospital setting as\nused in the present study.\nColistin is regaining popularity as a\ntreatment option for multidrug-resistant\ninfections; in vitro and limited clinical stu-\ndies, as well as its use as monotherapy,\nsuggest that colistin may also be used in\ncombination with other drugs (carbape-\nnems, other b-lactams, aminoglycosides\nand quinolones).27 Several studies have\ntested colistin in combination with imi-\npenem, meropenem, ceftazidime and rifam-\npicin and reported either synergistic effects\nIn the present study, the colistin\u00ad\nimipenem and colistin\u00adceftazidime combin-\nations both showed indifferent effects in\n100% of strains tested, however no\nTable 4.

This might\nhave resulted from the fact that all of the\nstudied isolates were already susceptible to\ncolistin, which suggests that this antibiotic\nshould not be the first choice for\nmonotherapy.\nOut of 16 multidrug-resistant isolates\ntested in the present study, the amikacin\u00ad\nceftazidime combination showed a synergis-\ntic effect in one isolate (6.3%). Thus,\naminoglycoside/cephalosporin antibiotic\ncombinations may represent potential first-\nline options for treating multidrug resistant\nisolates, when limited by treatment options.\nSusceptibility testing should be properly\nanalysed during antibiotic selection and\nindividual hospitals should select the anti-\nbiotic regimen that is most suitable for the\nestablished resistance profile within the\nhospital.\nThe present study was limited by budget\nrestrictions. Disc-diffusion and MIC-strip\ntesting is costly to undertake; consequently\nonly 60 consecutive clinically isolated\nPseudomonas strains were included, and\ncombinations of colistin, amikacin and levo-\nfloxacin with ceftazidime and imipenem\nwere investigated, governed by the number\nof MIC test strips available. Ideally, the\npresent in vitro results should also be sup-\nported by in vivo studies.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that use of an\nappropriate antibiotic for treatment of\nP. aeruginosa infection is more important\nthan the discovery of a novel antibiotic, in\nrelation to managing bacterial resistance\nmechanisms. Susceptibility testing should\nbe properly analysed during antibiotic selec-\ntion and individual hospitals should select\nthe antibiotic regimen that is most suitable\nfor the established resistance profile within\nthe hospital.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
