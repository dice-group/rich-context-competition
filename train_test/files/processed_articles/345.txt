Intra-abdominal visceral fat is\nparticularly reactive to lipolytic stimuli and is believed to\naffect glucose homeostasis through its effect on circulat-\ning adiponectin levels(5). As central obesity is more\nstrongly associated with visceral fat than BMI, waist cir-\ncumference (WC) has been proposed as the more sensi-\ntive measure of relative CVD risk(6,7).\nThe metabolic syndrome has been identified in chil-\ndren and adolescents(8) as well as adults and appears to\npersist from childhood into adulthood(9). Trends of\nincreasing overweight(10) and central obesity(11) among\nchildren and adolescents are well documented. Some\nstudies indicate that central adiposity among children\nmay be increasing independent of weight(12,13).

The con-\nsumption of different amounts and types of foods may\nimpact adiposity in a variety of direct and indirect ways.\nFor example, different foods may impact satiety through\nvolumetric differences, effects on gastric emptying or\nenergy content. Other foods are theorized to affect body\nweight through their impact on such factors as energy\nmetabolism or storage, lipogenesis or insulin sensitivity.\nThe goal of the current analyses was to explore the\nrelationship of mean food group intake and anthropo-\nmetric measures of central obesity in children (aged 5\u00ad11\nyears) and adolescents (aged 12\u00ad16 years) using cross-\nsectional data from the Third National Health and Nutri-\nMethods\nStudy population\nNHANES have been conducted regularly since 1960 to\nassess the health and dietary status of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized US population aged 2 months and older.\nThe surveys randomly select subjects using a stratified,\nmultistage probability cluster design and oversample\ncertain groups including young children, non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican-Americans. Details of the design and\nsampling methods as well procedures for obtaining\ninformed consent have been described elsewhere(23). The\ncurrent secondary analyses were conducted with the\napproval of the Boston University Institutional Review\nBoard. Since dietary habits may change particularly dur-\ning late adolescence, we restricted the analyses to sub-\njects who were less than 17 years of age in order to\nreduce the likelihood that true changes in diet would\nimpact the estimates of usual intake(24).\nThe primary analyses include subjects who were 5\u00ad16\nyears of age and in one of three categories of racial or\nethnic origin: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican-Americans. A total of 4329 children aged\ncents aged 12\u00ad16 years completed interviews and an\nexamination. The number of subjects (n 99) in the other\nracial/ethnic groups was insufficient to provide stable\nestimates of association, so these subjects were excluded\nfrom the analyses as has been recommended by the\nNHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines(25). Sub-\njects with dietary data designated as missing or unreliable\n(n 317) by the study nutritionist or with extremes of\nenergy intake (the upper and lower 2 % of the distribution\nof energy intake; n 227) were excluded, as were those\nwho were pregnant or breast-feeding (n 18), taking dia-\nbetes medication (n 8), had missing data for WC cir-\ncumference (n 128) or had potential confounders of\ninterest to the study (n 47). This resulted in a final sample\naged 12\u00ad16 years. Skinfold measurement data were\nmissing for an additional 112 subjects who were therefore\nexcluded from any sub-analyses related to that outcome.\nNHANES study population of 12- to 16-year-olds, leaving\nAssessment of dietary intake\nDietary intake in both NHANES III and NHANES\nan automated, microcomputer-based interview(26). Prior\nto age 12, the recall was completed jointly by the subject\nand a proxy respondent. Dietary recalls were analysed\nfor nutrient composition using USDA nutrient files\nappropriate to the time period.\nFood Pyramid servings of the five major food groups\n(i.e. dairy, fruit, vegetables, grains and meats/other pro-\nteins) were calculated from intake of both simple foods\n(e.g. glass of milk) and mixed dishes (e.g. lasagne) as\ndefined by the USDA Dietary Guidelines(27,28). One dairy\nserving was defined as 1 cup of milk or yoghurt, 1?5 oz of\nnatural cheese or 2 oz of processed cheese. A fruit serving\nequalled 1 medium fruit (e.g. apple, banana, orange), 1/2\ncup of chopped, cooked or canned fruit, or 3/4 cup of\nfruit juice. Total fruit (whole or as juice) was also divided\ninto two subgroups: (i) citrus, melons and berries; and (ii)\nother fruits. One vegetable serving comprised 1 cup of\nraw leafy vegetables, 1/2 cup of cut-up raw or cooked\nother vegetables, or 3/4 cup of vegetable juice. There\nwere several vegetable subgroups including dark-green\nvegetables, deep-yellow vegetables, white potatoes, other\nstarchy vegetables (including legumes), tomatoes and\nother vegetables. French fries were included with pota-\ntoes but the added fat from frying was counted as ser-\nvings of discretionary fat (see below). A grain serving\n(whole and refined) was represented by 1 slice of bread,\n1 cup of dry cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta or\ncereal. Finally, the meat/protein group included all forms\nof meat, fish, poultry, eggs, soyabean products, nuts and\nseeds. For the purposes of estimating intake, servings in\nthe meat/other protein group were expressed as ounce\nequivalents and included items such as 1 oz of lean meat,\nfish or poultry, 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, an egg, or 2\ntablespoons of peanut butter(29). Discretionary fats refer-\nred to fat in food that is above the amount that would be\nexpected in a lean, low-fat or fat-free form of the food.\nAssessment of anthropometric measures of\ncentral obesity\nWC served as the main measure of central adiposity in\nthese analyses, while the sum of suprailiac and sub-\nscapular skinfold thicknesses served as a secondary\nmeasure. Waist measurements were taken on a horizontal\nline at the high point of the iliac crest. The measurement\nwas made at minimal respiration to the nearest 0?1 cm.\nSkinfold thickness measurements were taken using a\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

For NHANES\nsum of the two skinfolds was not available).\nAssessment of potential confounders\nParental education (classified as less than high school,\nhigh school and more than high school) was used as an\nindicator of socio-economic status (SES). Income was\nassessed as a secondary measure of SES in these analyses\nor more (since nearly 10 % of NHANES III subjects failed\nto provide more precise data on annual income). In the\nNHANES III sample, parental education was retained in\nthe final models as it confounded the main results. Since\nparental income was used instead. The three categories\nof race/ethnicity as defined by NHANES included non-\nHispanic blacks, Hispanic (specifically Mexican-American)\nand non-Hispanic whites.\nPubertal development was assessed during the physical\nexamination by physicians who were given standardized\ntraining in the use of Tanner stage classification(30,31). For\nthe purpose of the present analyses, the original 5-stage\nTanner scale was collapsed into three categories: (i) stage\n1 or 2; (ii) stage 3; and (iii) stage 4 or 5. Tanner stage\nTelevision watching was assessed in both surveys by\nquestioning the child (or parent, depending on age)\nabout the number of hours of television watched the\nprevious day. Weight and standing height were measured\naccording to a standardized protocol and BMI was cal-\nculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of\nheight in metres (kg/m2).\nPhysical activity was assessed among children aged 8\nyears and above by questionnaire. We examined it as a\npotential confounder in the models for adolescents but\nlater dropped it as it led to no change in the results.\nStatistical methods\nGiven the cross-sectional study design, both the anthro-\npometry measures and the dietary intakes were measured\nat the same time. In these analyses, we examined the\nadjusted mean dietary intakes associated with age- and\nsex-specific quartiles of WC (and the sum of subscapular\nand suprailiac skinfold measures). The adjusted mean\nlevel of intake in each quartile of central body fat was\nestimated using analysis of covariance modelling with\nPROC GLM in the SAS statistical software package version\n9?1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\nIn addition to the use of quartiles for categorizing the\ndistributions of central adiposity, we also examined the\nassociation between the mean intakes in each of the five\nmajor food groups and related subgroups and the pre-\nvalence of central obesity. Since there are no specific cut-\noff points for defining an abnormal waist size in children,\nwe chose to explore both the 85th and the 90th age- and\nsex-specific percentiles. Although the 90th percentile of\nwaist size has been used in some guidelines for defining\nthe metabolic syndrome in children(32), we found that the\nassociations between food intake and waist size using the\n85th yielded very similar results and greater statistical\npower and so we present only that analysis. To allow for\nsurveys with those from NHANES III, we used the same\nage- and sex-specific cut points of WC (derived from the\nNHANES III distributions) to define children with ($85th\npercentile) and without (,85th percentile) central obesity.\nThe potential confounders retained in the final models\nwere those that led to meaningful changes in the adjusted\nmean dietary intakes, including age, race/ethnicity,\nheight, number of hours of daily television viewing,\nTanner stage of pubertal development and parental\neducation or income level. For the approximately 1?5 % of\nsubjects who had missing data on parental education, we\nused a dummy variable to substitute missing education\ninformation. Analyses were conducted including and\nexcluding the dummy variable for education and the\nresults were nearly identical, leading us to conclude that\nthe inclusion of these subjects was unbiased.\nResults\nshown in Table 1. On average, the 5- to 11-year-olds were\nslightly less than 8 years of age while the adolescents\nwere about 14 years of age.

These results are consistent with a\nreport from the National Growth and Health Study which\nfound that adolescent white females following a `healthy\ndietary pattern' (i.e. higher intakes of dairy, fruits, vegetables\nand grains) had smaller increases in WC over 10 years(33). A\nlarger number of studies have examined the relationship of\nfood group intake and overall adiposity among children.\nRegarding dairy, for instance, some data indicate that higher\ndairy intakes are associated with significantly lower body fat\nlevels through childhood(34\u00ad36), although a review of the\nevidence in 2005 concluded that there was insufficient evi-\ndence at that time to draw firm conclusions regarding the\neffect of Ca or dairy intake on body fat(37).\nWhile higher fruit and vegetable consumption is thought\nto be associated with a healthy body weight in children, a\nrecent review concluded that more evidence is needed to\nsupport this conclusion(38) and it has been suggested that\nthe methods of preparation (e.g. frying) and serving (e.g.\nwith sauce) may account for the apparent inconsistent\nprotective effect. Data on the relationship of grains and\nweight in children are limited. One prospective study\ndemonstrated smaller annual weight change in relation to\neach additional serving of breads/grains(39) and another(40)\nfound that cereal consumption was related to lower BMI;\nneither of these studies distinguished between refined\nand whole grains. In the current cross-sectional study, we\nsaw that adolescents whose waist circumference was\nabove the 85th percentile reported consuming less dis-\ncretionary fat than those with less central body fat. There\nare several possible explanations for this finding. First,\nreporting bias is a possibility, with more under-reporting\nof added fat among children with more central adiposity.\nIt could be, however, that more overweight adolescents are\nin fact consuming less added fat. For example, in our own\nobservations (ML Singer and LL Moore, unpublished\nresults), we found that overweight children and adolescents\nmore often consumed low-fat dairy products than those\nwho are of normal weight. Finally, we note that discre-\ntionary fat does not necessarily reflect the total fat load of\nTable 4 Association between food intake and waist size in adolescents in NHANES III and NHANES 1999\u00ad2002\nServings per day- Servings per day-\n-\nTotal food groups\nand subgroups Mean SE Mean SE P value Mean SE Mean SE P value\nPotatoes (white) & other\nstarchy\nOther vegetables (including\ntomatoes)\nProcessed (franks,\nsausage, luncheon meats)\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; WC, waist circumference.\n-Adjusted for exact age, gender, height, race/ethnicity, hours per day watching television, Tanner stage and parental education.\n-\n-\nAdjusted for exact age, gender, height, race/ethnicity, hours per day watching television and parental income.\nyAge- and gender-specific cut-off points of WC from the NHANES III data set were used.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The correlations between discretionary fat and\nSeveral studies have examined food group intake and\ncentral obesity among adults. One such cross-sectional\nstudy of middle-aged adults found an inverse relationship\nbetween a dietary pattern characterized by frequent\nintake of raw and salad vegetables and seasonal fruits\n(and low intakes of fried foods including potatoes) and\ncentral obesity(18). One prospective study found that a\npattern characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables,\nreduced-fat dairy and whole grains and low intakes of red\nand processed meat was associated with smaller gains in\ncentral obesity(18), while another found an inverse asso-\nciation between a dietary pattern of high fruits and\nvegetables and low-fat dairy and WC among women(41).\nThe CARDIA study identified an inverse association\nbetween higher dairy intake and lower waist:hip ratio\namong young adults(42) and at least one small trial found\ndairy to be inversely related to central fat loss among\nobese subjects(43). Similar results have been found for\nwhole grain consumption and cereal fibre(44,45). In terms\nof meat intake, high intakes of both red and processed\nmeat have been shown to be positively related to the\nlikelihood of central weight gain over a 10-year period in\nA number of possible explanations exist for the find-\nings of these studies. Dairy foods have been hypothesized\nto be associated with lower levels of body fat through the\neffects of their Ca content on lipogenesis(48). Dairy is also\nan important source of protein and protein-rich diets have\nbeen shown to promote satiety(49). The dairy protein,\nwhey, is also a rich source of the essential amino acid\nleucine that is involved in the partitioning of dietary\nenergy(50). The effects of whole grains on obesity are\nbelieved to relate to their soluble fibre content, which is\nassociated with increased satiety, delayed gastric empty-\ning and enhanced insulin sensitivity(51,52). Fruits and\nvegetables are also important sources of fibre and may\nhave similar effects on satiety and satiation(53).\nThe limitations of our exploratory study must be\nacknowledged. As with any self-reported dietary record,\nthere is the real possibility of misrepresentation of dietary\nintake. Subjects for whom weight or body proportions are\nof concern may certainly tend to understate aspects of\ntheir intake. The cross-sectional design of NHANES also\nprevents any conclusions related to cause and effect.\nThe availability of a single day's dietary recall limits the\nprecision of the estimated dietary intakes of individuals.\nHowever, a single 24 h dietary recall provides accurate\nestimates of mean dietary intake within groups(54). Thus,\nthe recalls used in NHANES are appropriate for quanti-\nfying mean food intakes associated with quartiles of\ncentral body fat.\nThe NHANES data set offers important strengths as\nwell. The large, randomly selected group of children and\nadolescents provides sufficient power to explore a broad\nrange of intake levels in different food groups. The\navailability of data from each of the USDA Food Pyramid\ngroups, including information from single food sources\nand mixed dishes, is a strength of the study. Most studies\nof food effects on health outcomes have relied on intakes\nfrom FFQ, which yield less precise estimates of food\nservings from all sources. For example, it is not possible\nto extract the actual number of grain servings from all\nsources in an FFQ since many of the servings would be\nderived from composite foods such as pizza or lasagne.\nIn summary, the current cross-sectional study demon-\nstrates an association between the patterns of food intake\nduring adolescence and the prevalence of excess central\nbody fat. The intakes of dairy and grains, especially\nwhole grains, as well as total fruits and vegetables were\ninversely associated with central obesity among these\nadolescents. These associations were not fully explained\nby total body fat as measured by BMI.\nThe USDA provides food-based dietary guidelines that\nare specific to age, sex and physical activity level. Pro-\nspective studies are needed to test the effects of these\nrecommendations on the development of central obesity\nin children and adolescents. The present study is an\nimportant first step towards such future work.\n"
