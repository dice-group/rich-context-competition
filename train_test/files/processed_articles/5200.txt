    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article aims at analysing the differences between European countries in the obstacles ex-\noffenders face due to having a criminal record. First, a comparative analytical framework is\nintroduced that takes into account all the different elements that can lead to exclusion from the\nlabour market by the dissemination of criminal record information. This model brings together\nsocial norms (macro level), social actors (meso level) and individual choices (micro level) in\nthe same framework. Secondly, this model is used to compare the different impact of having a\ncriminal record in Spain and the Netherlands. This comparison highlights three important findings:\n(1) the difference between norms of transparency/privacy and inclusive/exclusive ideals, (2) the\nsignificant role of social control agents, such as probation agencies and the ex-offenders' social\nnetwork, in shaping the opportunities that they have, and (3) self-exclusion seems to be a key\nmechanism for understanding unsuccessful re-entry into the labour market.\n",

His\npunishment had been severe: 18 months' imprisonment and two more years of treatment in a\nclosed institution. This treatment was considered to have been successful: Badr learned from\nhis mistakes. There is, according to his psychiatrist, no risk of reoffending. During his work,\nBadr completed a follow-up study on social work and received the opportunity to advance his\ncareer through promotion. However, in order to get to this position, he was required to have a\n`clean' criminal record. This is not the case, even though the offences were committed when he\nwas only a minor. His employer, now aware of his having a criminal record, fired him.\nConsequently, his diploma in social work was rendered useless. Now he, his wife and two\nyoung daughters can no longer make ends meet financially.\nThe impact of having a criminal record on the labour market is not the same in all European\nwould have faced either more or fewer obstacles if he had been living in another European\ncountry. For instance, in Spain or France, Badr would not have had any problem working\nas a social worker at that age, as he was convicted as a minor and his criminal record\nwould have been expunged by now (Carr et al., 2015).1 Yet, in the UK \u00ad as in the\nNetherlands \u00ad this would create serious obstacles for some types of employment because\nsexual offences would not become spent or expunged (Maruna, 2001; Thomas, 2007).\nThis article draws a framework for an analysis and comparison of how criminal records\naffect ex-offenders' lives, in particular their re-entry into the labour market, in different\nEuropean countries. We explore the case of Spain and the Netherlands. The theoretical\nframework is illustrated with preliminary empirical findings from two separate research\nstudies carried out in the course of our PhD projects. The examples, such as the case of Badr\nmentioned above, derive from in-depth interviews with young adult ex-offenders, aged\nUp to now there has been a lack of comparative empirical research on the impact of hav-\nPrevious research focused on differences in national legislation, policies and decision-mak-\ncomparative picture, the differences in ex-offenders'real lives should be taken into account.\nAlso attention should be paid to the (changing) local and international, historical and cul-\ntural contexts that shape the use of criminal background information in a specific society.\nSpain and the Netherlands are two good candidates to start a comprehensive compari-\nson. Formally, they reveal a contrast in regulating the dissemination of knowledge con-\ncerning criminal records. In Spain, employers cannot have direct access to another\nperson's criminal record, yet they have the possibility to ask employees to submit an\nextract of their criminal record (Larrauri and Jacobs, 2013). In the Netherlands, in con-\ntrast, no one can obtain an extract of someone's criminal record for pre-employment\nscreening. A special administrative agency at the Ministry of Security and Justice issues\nCertificates of Conduct for employment purposes. This is a document in which the State\nSecretary for Security and Justice declares that the applicant has not committed any\ncriminal offences that are relevant to the performance of his or her duties. Once issued,\nthe Certificate of Conduct does not reveal any criminal record information (Boone,\n2011). So, taking into account the more protective system in the Netherlands when\nexamining obstacles to re-entry into the labour market, we expect that ex-offenders in\nthis country will face fewer obstacles than those in Spain. In the Netherlands, employers\ncannot obtain extracts from criminal records, whereas in Spain they can ask employees\nto provide such extracts.\nThe article is divided into two sections. To begin with, a comprehensive comparative\nframework is created to sort out the different elements that affect ex-offenders' daily\nlives and influence their re-entry process. This holistic approach takes into account cul-\nture, norms, institutions, agents and individuals' experiences altogether. The aim of the\nmodel is to weigh these different aspects and point out which factors are relevant for its\noutcome. The second part is a first attempt to use this model to describe the different\nimpact of having a criminal record in Spain and the Netherlands.\nA comparative model\nThe systematic comparative framework is divided into three levels (Figure 1). The macro\nlevel refers to the construction of norms \u00ad either formal by law or informal by tradition\nor customs \u00ad that govern social behaviour. Previous literature has mainly focused on this\nlevel. The meso level focuses on social institutions and agents that shape the\nSelf-exclusion\nConcealment\nProacve\ndisclosure\nLegislator\nCriminal\njusce\nsystem\nPublic admin.\ninstuons\nProbaon agencies\nEmployers\nSocial network\nTransparency / secrecy\nRisk society Exclusive / inclusive values\nCriminal\nrecord\nFigure 1. Mechanisms explaining the impact of criminal records on re-entry into the labour\nmarket.\nopportunities individuals with a criminal record have in the labour market. The micro\nlevel addresses the individual's behaviour regarding searching and finding employment.\nThese levels appeared to be helpful in carrying out qualitative comparative research on\nindividuals with a criminal conviction history in Spain and the Netherlands.\nThe model allows consideration to be given to the profound interrelations between\nseveral aspects at the same time. For instance, norms at the macro level form the basis\nfor social interaction, which guides the behaviour of the different actors at the meso and\nmicro levels and, consequentially, interferes with individuals' options in their re-entry\nprocess. The way individuals consequently deal with the `label' of having a criminal\nrecord is then analysed at the micro level.\nMacro level\nThe macro level encompasses three main dimensions. These refer to state powers and\nstructural, social and cultural forces in wider society that shape public policies regarding\ncriminal background screenings.\nfacilitated criminal background checks in the labour market. The more risk averse a\nsociety is, the more preventive measures employers take towards job applicants and\nemployees, so the screening of criminal backgrounds increases. Similarly, Larrauri\n(2014) argues that the increase in criminal record checks can be understood in light of\ntransferring the management of risk from the state to the community. Moreover, these\nrisk-averse attitudes can lead to an increase in legal responsibilities. In the Netherlands,\nthe legislator provides every employer with an (administrative law) instrument to avoid\nsuch liability, which is, increasingly, part of security policies. The role of the media also\nseems to be fundamental in a risk-oriented society (Snacken, 2010). When the media\nreport extensively on criminal cases, the culture of control increases and ex-offenders\nwill experience more obstacles to reintegrating into society (McAlinden, 2012).\nInclusive vs. exclusive values.The structure and values of societies in relation to crime and\npunishment are compared by Snacken (2010). An important finding is that, in Nordic\ncountries, more inclusive values led to soft regimes, maintaining lower prison rates,\nwhereas in the English-speaking countries, more exclusive values led to strict regimes\nand higher prison rates (Pratt and Eriksson, 2014). Previously, Young (1999) had used\nthe inclusion/exclusion division to explain temporal variations in the crime control sys-\ntem in the UK, which he concludes to be a `bulimic society' that includes and excludes\ndeviants at the same time. One of the striking examples of this systematic ambivalence\nthat he provides is the use of criminal records in the labour market. McAlinden (2012)\nand Petrunik and Deutschmann (2008) too have introduced the dimension of inclusion/\nexclusion to understand differences between countries in the use of vetting schemes for\nsexual offenders. Following this reasoning, criminal background screenings in the labour\nmarket could be clearly considered as an exclusionary measure or a proxy for an exclu-\nPrivacy vs. secrecy.Scholars agree that stigmatization processes need to be limited after\noffenders have completed their sentence, in order to achieve successful re-entry into\nsociety (LeBel, 2012; Murphy et al., 2011). In general it is assumed that more respect for\nex-offenders' privacy rights leads to less stigmatizing effects resulting from their having\na criminal record. Previous research on privacy/transparency focused on the differences\nbetween common and civil law countries. Herzog-Evans (2011) classifies countries such\nas England and Wales and Australia as regulating a `right to know', which allows for\npublic access to criminal records. On the other side, Continental European countries,\nsuch as France, Germany and Spain, are classified by Herzog-Evans as upholding a\n`right to be forgotten'. This means criminal record information is restrictively disclosed,\nfor example only to administrative authorities. Herzog-Evans (2011: 2) perceives the\nNetherlands to be an exception to this classic dichotomy: it has `one foot in common law\ncountries and one foot in continental Europe jurisdictions'.\nDespite the differences between the United States and Europe regarding the concept of\nprivacy (Whitman, 2004), some important developments from the US are also relevant in\nthe European context. Jacobs (2006) argues that regulating privacy protection in the US, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the dissemination of criminal background information, is likely to\nresult in a black market. Many officials have access to this kind of information and can\n(even be bribed to) disclose it without permission. Purchasing information from unofficial\nsources was also one of the reasons the Dutch legislature established a central agency issu-\ning Certificates of Conduct (Brok, 1999; Kralingen and Prins, 1996). Another characteris-\ntic of the US is the declining respect for privacy by the media combined with the\ncharacteristics of modern information and communication technologies, which ensure that\ndata once published on the Internet is hardly ever removed from it. In this way, criminal\nhistory information can be made accessible without limitation and can never be removed\nentirely. Such developments are \u00ad as far as we are aware \u00ad not (yet) common in Spain or\nthe Netherlands, where the government remains the main criminal records repository.\nThe protective function of the right to privacy is, however, only a legal protection\nagainst an infringement of this right. Therefore, we use the much broader concept of\nsecrecy, meaning the absence of particular knowledge. This goes beyond the legal (pri-\nvacy) structure of a society by incorporating the way it deals with values of inclusion and\nexclusion. We developed the transparency/secrecy model below in order to be able to\ncapture both of these aspects in one single framework. Cohen's (2000) work is used to\ndescribe five stages of the dissemination of knowledge along a line between total secrecy\nand total transparency:\nIn a stage of `total secrecy', at the one extreme, no information is revealed to third\nparties for purposes other than the criminal procedure. This could be similar to the status\nof the criminal records of juvenile ex-offenders concerning non-sexual crimes in Spain.\nSuch information is never included in criminal record certificates and there are no excep-\ntions to this rule.\nTotal transparency Limited Transparency \"Stain\" Secrecy Concerted Ignorance Total Secrecy\nFigure 2. Five stages of the dissemination of knowledge.\nA stage of `total transparency', at the other extreme, can be linked to the situation in\nthe US, where court files and Internet information on criminal histories are (almost)\nfreely accessible. Between these two poles, we can find three more stages.\n`Limited transparency' indicates situations in which detailed information can be\nobtained by third parties with the consent of the person involved. In this way, Spanish\nemployers can \u00ad indirectly \u00ad obtain limited knowledge of an applicant's criminal convic-\ntions since reaching adulthood.\n`Stain secrecy' refers to a situation in which information is provided only concerning\nthe fact that there has been contact with the criminal justice system. Yet, information on\nthe nature of the \u00ad alleged \u00ad criminal acts is not provided. For example, in the Netherlands\nno one will be issued with a copy of a criminal record extract outside the criminal proce-\ndure, in order to protect employees from coercion to provide such extracts to employers.\nYet, when the requested Certificate of Conduct is not issued, the employer knows of the\n`stain', `mark' or `label' that the ex-offender has, yet there is nothing more to know than\n(just) that. Although a `stain'policy is more oriented towards secrecy, it in fact allows for\nknowledge dissemination in a way that might create `mysterious' or `risky' individuals\ntizing knowledge, `secrecy can also be dangerous, because ... it can lead to misunder-\nstandings about the activities and aims of the individuals involved and to negative\nstereotyping and speculation'.\n`Concerted ignorance' refers to situations in which agents do not have an interest in\nasking what has been going on or the social environment benefits from the continuation\nof an existing situation, so no one will be inclined to ask difficult questions: `Don't ask,\ndon't tell' (Van de Bunt, 2010: 445). When information is kept secret as far as third par-\nties are concerned, they can be protected against needless `guilty knowledge' (Siegel,\n2012: 4). For example, an employer might not want to know that his noticeably good\nemployee has been convicted, otherwise he might be impelled to let this employee go or\nhe might become (legally) responsible for any misbehaviour in the workplace.\nMeso level\nThe meso level focuses on social institutions and agents that are responsible for defining\nthe legal and social norms for the disclosure of criminal background information. Six\nmain categories of social control agents are defined. In the public sector we find: the\nlegislator that creates the law; the criminal justice system that fulfils the ambivalent task\nof supervision and control on the one side and guidance and assistance on the other; and\nthe public (administrative) institutions, located outside the criminal justice system, that\nexecute the regulations on criminal records. In the private sector it is important to con-\nsider: the institutions and non-governmental and commercial organizations that carry out\nfunctions of supervision and reintegration outside the criminal justice system; employ-\ners, the agents that provide employment opportunities, internships or voluntary work\n(although employers can also be public institutions); and the social network of the indi-\nvidual, also an important source of finding jobs.\nIn order to understand the behaviour of these social institutions and actors, two kinds\nof powers are described: responsibility and discrimination.\nResponsibility. By referring to responsibility we can analyse actions on the thin line\nbetween protecting safety and advancing ex-offenders' inclusion. It is often presumed\nthat employers seek as much information as possible in their decision-making process, in\norder to guarantee a well-substantiated outcome. Jacobs (2006) argues that in the US the\nincrease in criminal background checks is related to the negligent hiring doctrine.\nAlthough the legal principle of respecting privacy, as prevalent in the Netherlands, can\nprotect ex-offenders, transparency can, at the same time, generate trust, because it can\nremove doubts and uncertainty and, thereby, create trust and inclusion (Boone et al.,\n2014). For example, in the Netherlands an employer might exclude an applicant in order\nto avoid any possible risk, based on knowing only that this person has had some prob-\nlems with the criminal justice system, but having no more detailed information than this.\nHowever, if the employer had known the characteristics of the criminal offence, which,\nfor instance, might be only petty crime not related to the job, he or she might not have\nchosen to exclude this ex-offender (Holzer et al., 2007).\nConsequently, a national system that is not designed to provide for the disclosure of\ncriminal records (`stain' secrecy) can create a context in which ex-offenders convicted\nof only minor crimes face more difficulties in finding a job. In this way, risky individu-\nals can be created and the criminal record becomes a general `mark of marginality',\napart from aspects such as the severity, nature and relevance of previous convictions.\nFor example, in the Netherlands young people are rejected for tertiary education, even\nthough their former criminal acts do not appear to constitute a serious risk. In this way,\ntheir criminal past constitutes a mark of marginality that is considered a risk of not\ncompleting education and leads to exclusion. Moreover, when employers cannot obtain\ncriminal background information as desired, they could `statistically' discriminate\nagainst social groups known to have a relatively higher proportion of convicted indi-\nResponsibility also plays a role for institutions within the criminal justice system and\npublic or private reintegration organizations. Van de Bunt (2012: 54) considers probation\nprofessionals to be `hybrid' as a result of conflicting interests, which are part of their\nsupervising tasks of controlling and preventing risk, on the one hand, and helping to\nreintegrate on the other. Officers of the Dutch probation service recognize this ambiva-\nlent task. For example, in the case of a person, convicted of sexual offences and not able\nto find a job anywhere, hired to do some voluntary work at a holiday park, the probation\nofficer struggled with the question of whether or not to inform the employer about his\ncriminal past. This contradiction also follows from an interview with a parole officer in\nSpain:\nWe tried to do it [check that the individual is working] in a cautious way ... Once, I talked with\nan employer to ask him to make a parolee come to the `Social Services of Penal Execution' [the\nname of parole offices in Spain]. When he heard the word `penal' I noticed that he became\nnervous... then I thought: `I don't know if I should have mentioned the word \"penal\".'\nDiscrimination. By referring to discrimination we can analyse the consequences of using\ncriminal background information and assess its relevance. Previous research has pointed\nout that the predictive value of criminal records diminishes over time (for example,\nBushway et al., 2011). Their relevance is furthermore determined by the seriousness of\nthe offence, recidivism and its relationship to the specific occupation (Boone, 2011; Lam\nand Harcourt, 2003; Larrauri, 2014). Some authors argue that establishing the relevance\nof previous convictions is more favourable to ex-offenders if conducted by an external\nagency because employers might have prejudices against ex-offenders beyond the actual\nrisk concerns (Apel and Sweeten, 2010). If the relevance test is carried out externally, for\nexample by a public administrative agency, as takes place in the Netherlands, it is\nassumed to be more objective and less discriminatory towards ex-offenders.\nIn countries where most employment is found through relatives and acquaintances,\nthe social network can be an important means of disseminating knowledge. Then the\nemployer might not need an official file summarizing all previous convictions because\nthere are other \u00ad informal \u00ad ways of knowing about the person's criminal background.\nInterviews in Spain reveal the impact that the social network can have on job applica-\ntions. A man wanted to work as a fishmonger because he had learned this business during\na course in prison. The prison staff made it very clear to the students that, once they were\noutside the prison system, no one could know that the course had been followed in\nprison. Yet, during a job application process, the man was recognized \u00ad through the\ngrapevine \u00ad as someone who had undertaken the course in prison. He felt embarrassed\nand ultimately did not get the job.\nHowever, most interviewees from Spain mention that trust leads to less discrimina-\ntion. This trust seems to be based on the knowledge an employer collects by assessing\ndirect signs rather than on officially registered criminal background information. Cherney\nand Fitzgerald (2014) highlight that a common social network functions as a `certifica-\ntion' of reliability and capability and evidence that the ex-offender has adopted a con-\nforming role. The following quote from an ex-prisoner in Spain shows how the social\nnetwork can redeem the individual and create job possibilities. He was asked whether he\nbelieves his acquaintances have stopped recommending him since he has been in prison:\nNo, I rather think they feel a bit sorry for me. I have lost the bar I had... I think they would\nrecommend me, because they know where I came from and that I have to struggle to find my\nown stability.\nFrom this interview it seems that the social network helps ex-prisoners to rebuild their\nsocial life by providing employment. Yet, there are also respondents in Spain who talk\nabout being discriminated against by their social network. A respondent recalled that\npeople are two-faced: `when you come out of prison, they say they are going to help you,\nbut eventually they seem unwilling to provide a good reference.'\nIn Spain, supervising professionals also carry out a relevance test before deciding\nwhether or not to communicate the supervised offender's criminal history to an employer.\nFor instance, the person responsible for the Job Notice Board for parolees in Catalonia\nmentioned that she does not disclose the specific details of a criminal background to\nemployers. However, she herself assesses the suitability of the offender for the position\nin question. In the Netherlands, reintegration professionals often try to avoid discrimina-\ntion due to official administrative background screening by negotiating directly with\nemployers who seem willing to contribute to ex-offenders' reintegration.\nMicro level\nThe micro \u00ad or individual \u00ad level focuses on the options that individuals have and\nchoose to deal with criminal records. The individual aspects that determine ex-\noffenders' position in society are multiple. Demographic characteristics as well as\nmultiple social and psychological factors (character, motivation, cognition and\nagency) can play a role here. Cultural values, previous socialization and peer groups\ncan also influence the way in which individuals deal with (possible) stigmatization.\nNext to these individual characteristics, the reintegration process can be full of \u00ad\nexternal \u00ad obstacles and encouragements. Therefore, it is important to examine the\nex-offender's experiences that either increase or decrease his or her motivation, self-\nesteem and self-efficacy during the reintegration process. Next, it should be exam-\nined to what extent disappointments and successes can be related \u00ad alongside\nindividual characteristics \u00ad to societal reactions, deriving from the context of the\nmacro and meso levels.\nConfronted with the different opportunities ex-offenders have in society, the response\nthey choose will affect their position in society (Goffman, 1990; Harding, 2003). Previous\nliterature on stigma has operationalized these choices as different strategies (Lebel,\n2008). In the US, Harding (2003) found that the way in which ex-offenders manage their\nstigma has an impact on their chances of finding employment but also on their applying\nfor it. Ex-offenders who conceal their former identity may sacrifice long-term employ-\nment and growth in earnings for short-term survival on the job market, whereas those\nwho reveal their former identity may sacrifice finding employment in the short term for\nthe sake of a long-term occupation.\nSelf-exclusion. When ex-offenders foresee that criminal records will be asked for, they\ncan withdraw from the job-seeking process. This micro-level strategy of self-exclusion\ncan explain the negative impact of having a criminal record. Forecasting a possible\nrejection, the ex-offender can decide either not to apply for a certain job or to exclude\nhim/herself from the labour market completely. In the following quote, an ex-offender\nfrom Spain recalls holding back from applying for a training course run by the National\nCareer Service, because he was afraid to show a qualification from a previous training\ncourse undertaken in prison. His quote exemplifies the frustration this withdrawal\nstrategy causes:\nI went to the INEM [the National Jobcentre] and I applied. I wanted to go on the cooking\ncourse. But, how can I go to INEM with that [the training course certificate obtained in prison]?\nI got a bit angry and I said to them to go to hell, so clear ... It was not just one thing [that he\nhad been in prison], but three [marks] ... Doing that, they [the organizers of the course] make\nme feel frustrated.\nDifferent research has highlighted the negative consequences of this mechanism.\nHowever, there is no extensive literature dealing with the notion of self-exclusion in this\nfield. Murphy et al. (2011) speak of an `upward bias' if ex-offenders exclude themselves\na priori from jobs for which (they believe) their criminal history will be checked. They\nalso call this the `social emasculation' of ex-offenders since they believe that they are\nincapable of changing their circumstances. An example from an interview in the\nNetherlands shows how the strategy of self-exclusion works:\nI had this issue with my manager about the Certificate of Conduct. He said: `If you haven't done\nanything really bad, you'll get it.' I thought: Wow, do you really mean that? Because I knew I\nhad already received a letter stating that I would not get my Certificate of Conduct... That was\nall. The way he said it to me was very offensive. ... I was very ashamed. ... I continued to work\nthere for a few weeks, then I left.\nEx-offenders can face other forms of stigma, in addition to being an `ex-con', on\nwhich they base their decisions regarding job applications (LeBel, 2008). In the\nNetherlands, for example, Moroccan youngsters feel doubly stigmatized: they perceive\nthat they are being discriminated against because of their ethnic background alongside a\ncriminal stigma. It can be said that the race stigma doubles the criminal one (LeBel,\n2012). It can therefore be expected that ex-offenders from a marginalized social back-\nground in general tend to withdraw from job entry processes because they accumulate\nstigmas.\nConcealment. Regarding avoidance or concealment strategies, research in the UK (Metcalf\npeople with criminal records, when they think they are not going to be asked about their\ncriminal record, opt for a strategy of keeping quiet. They either avoid mentioning their crim-\ninal record during a job application process or cover it up with some excuses. The following\nquote from Spain illustrates the willingness and reason to use a strategy of avoidance during\na job interview. The respondent has never actually faced these kinds of questions, so his\nanswer is based on a `perceived'instead of an `enacted'stigma (LeBel, 2012). He was asked\nwhether he would mention that he is on parole during a job interview:\nNo. If there is a lot of trust, yes, but I am not going to say this and be fired in two days... It's\nlogical. The man who hires a prisoner, he doesn't know if he will steal, if he will commit a crime,\nif he will kill. For this reason, they are not going to pick you directly.\nThis example shows that in Spain ex-offenders are likely not to mention their criminal\npast unless there is a lot of trust involved. Yet concealment strategies have been related\nto feelings of stress because ex-offenders have to deal with hiding a part of their past\n(Lebel, 2008). Not telling the whole truth to employers can make ex-offenders feel\napprehensive, which can create problems in answering questions promptly or properly\nduring an interview, subsequently leading to failing the job interview. However, covering\nstrategies are likely to be related to lesser amounts of stress during an interview if recruit-\ners cannot easily find out about criminal records because this information is considered\nto be confidential and is not easily accessible to them.\nProactive disclosure.If ex-offenders anticipate that employers will eventually find out\nabout their criminal past or if they think that this past is not relevant, they can opt for\nproactive disclosure. Research on other kinds of stigmas indicates that proactive strate-\ngies are beneficial in the lives of the stigmatized (Lebel, 2008). Trust seems to be\nfundamental in opting for this strategy. One of the Spanish respondents answered, when\nasked whether he would be open about his previous convictions: `Well, if there is trust, I\nwould mention it, but in principle, no.'The following quote shows what can also happen\nafter a Spanish interviewee explains his criminal past to an employer who asks about his\nprevious lack of work experience and the gap in his CV:\nIt is huge. If they do ask, then yes, I tell them a bit. But if they do not ask, I never tell .... If I tell\nthem, their faces change. ... they become very surprised... but I don't know the reaction... I see\nthem being surprised, but not very negative... They just stop asking questions...\nDifferences between the Netherlands and Spain\nMacro level\nAt the macro level we analysed the social, cultural and structural norms regarding\nrisk and inclusion/exclusion, and the structures for disseminating criminal record\ninformation. In the course of our PhD research we found some hints that attitudes\nconcerning risk aversion are more prevalent in the Netherlands than in Spain. A\nDutch civil servant referred to this as the `risk-rule reflex': when a particular risk (an\noffence) becomes reality, the reflex action of politicians is often to create more pre-\nventive measures, trying to meet the public claim for more control and reducing risk.\nThis was the case when a high school teacher was caught chatting about sex with a\nstudent via social media. The Dutch Minister of Justice consequently demanded\nrestrictions on the issuing of Certificates of Conduct. In this case, however, it was\nnot a problem of a certificate being issued too easily; the problem was that the school\ndid not demand a certificate at all. Therefore, tightening the rules seems to be a\nmeasure only to satisfy the demands of the media and the general public for more\nsafety measures instead of an accurate strategy to prevent such incidents reoccur-\nring. In Spain, media attention on such issues is very different. For instance, an\nemployment termination case involving a person who had been hired as a supervisor\nin a juvenile detention centre, when he had previously been convicted of abusing\nchildren under his supervision and of possessing child pornography, resulted in only\na brief mention in newspapers and on TV.\nRegarding inclusive/exclusive values there seems to be a slightly more exclusive sys-\ntem in the Netherlands. Both Spain and the Netherlands legally prescribe which types of\njobs require criminal record checks, such as the judiciary, politicians, police officers,\npublic servants, medical staff, private security guards and taxi drivers. In the Netherlands,\nteachers and caregivers of children are also legally obliged to submit a Certificate of\nConduct. In Spain, this provision has only recently been introduced.3 Expungement pro-\ncedures, however, do not greatly differ. In the Netherlands, the general `expiry' period\n\u00ad after which an offender (unless convicted of homicide or sexual offences) is eligible to\nreceive a Certificate of Conduct \u00ad is four years. In Spain, a conviction becomes spent\nafter a predetermined period, which varies from six months for minor violations to 10\nyears for serious offences. For short prison sentences \u00ad below three years \u00ad this period is\nthree years.\nRegarding the transparency/privacy dimension, the Netherlands has a more protective\nsystem towards ex-offenders than Spain. The Dutch system is designed to prevent crimi-\nnal background information being revealed to third parties. Yet, in the Netherlands, no\nexception is made for the disclosure of the criminal records of minors, in contrast to\nSpain. The administrative agency just applies a shorter expiry period for the criminal\nrecords of minors. In the Netherlands, moreover, out-of-court settlements or merely\nbeing a suspect also generally lead to the refusal of a Certificate. The situation in the\nNetherlands exemplifies a system favouring privacy towards ex-offenders, while at the\nsame time providing limited knowledge on people with a `stain', without providing any\ninformation on what that blemish or label implies, that is, what the nature of their crimi-\nnal background is. For example, it is difficult for an ex-offender to receive a Certificate\nof Conduct to work at the Port of Rotterdam or at Schiphol Airport, due to very strict\nsafety policies in these areas. Even the most minor offences can lead to a rejection, even\nwhen there is no actual risk of reoffending or reoffending would not be detrimental to the\noccupation in question. Nevertheless, the applicant can be considered to be a `risky indi-\nvidual' and not allowed to work in such a high-risk position.\nMeso level\nAt the meso level we study the responsibility of and discrimination by social institutions\nand actors. In practice, employment discrimination seems much higher in the Netherlands\nseems a lot compared with the number of people who had paid work: 8.3 million.4 The\nmajority of the interviewed Dutch ex-offenders who were actively looking for employ-\nment had experienced concrete problems due to their criminal past.Almost all ex-offend-\ners seem to worry about the potential consequences of having a criminal record. When\nasked about this, a respondent replied: `You ask me this for the sake of asking. Of course\neverybody knows having a criminal record makes finding a job more difficult.' Men\nexperience most difficulties in the field of taxi driving, security and youth work. Women\nin particular face difficulties receiving a Certificate of Conduct for cleaning work and\ncaringoccupations,forexamplewithchildrenortheelderly.IncontrasttotheNetherlands,\nin Spain most of the ex-offenders interviewed were even surprised that research was\nbeing carried out on this issue. An adult ex-offender, who had been in prison for a bur-\nglary, replied \u00ad when asked about the effect of having a criminal record \u00ad `No, this no.\n... It does not affect you because it does not appear. So, you do not have to mention it\nanywhere. Then, it is only known by you.' Out of 37 Spanish interviewees, only 2 had\nbeen asked to reveal their criminal record during a job interview.\nHowever, previous convictions do affect the real lives of the Spanish interviewees\nbecause the majority of them found work through acquaintances. Then their criminal\npast was already known to the employer. Here, as aforementioned, trust in the convicted\nperson prevents discriminatory attitudes. Additionally, this practice might explain why\nthere are not as many legal requirements to carry out criminal record checks as there are\nin the Netherlands. If informal ways of recruiting (through family and friends) are the\nmost common, requiring employers to carry out criminal background screenings might\nhinder selection processes in Spain.\nRegarding responsibility, in the Netherlands the law \u00ad out of respect for privacy rights\n\u00ad strictly prescribes in what ways criminal background information is allowed to be dis-\nseminated. The Spanish system, in contrast, leaves actors at the meso level, such as\nemployers, considerable leeway for a case-by-case assessment of an applicant's criminal\npast. This, however, seems to lead to more inclusive attitudes on several occasions. For\nexample, parole and probation officers perform \u00ad covert \u00ad employment screenings them-\nselves, so that employers do not have to make these decisions \u00ad which is deemed to\ninfluence ex-offenders' chances in the labour market negatively. The exclusive attitudes\nin the Netherlands can be related to possible negligent hiring issues, since administrative\nscreening \u00ad resulting in either the issuance or the refusal of a Certificate of Conduct \u00ad is\nwidely acknowledged and promoted. Yet, according to the literature, negligent hiring\ncases seem to be uncommon in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, since Dutch law provides\nfor the option to have all employees screened, such claims have the potential to be suc-\ncessful at any rate. In Spain, we found only one case in recent years that could be related\nto negligent hiring.5\nMicro level\nAt the micro level we deal with the choices of individuals with a criminal conviction\nhistory when dealing with stigma in the labour market. In Spain, concealment is the most\nprevalent strategy, probably owing to the fact that, although criminal record extracts can\nbe straightforwardly requested, this does not often happen in practice. When the job is\nfound through the ex-offender's social network and there is a relationship of trust with\nthe potential employer, ex-offenders opt for the (proactive) disclosure of their former\nindiscretions, although without providing the most negative details. Still, withdrawal\nstrategies are used in both countries \u00ad in Spain if ex-offenders foresee that their potential\nemployer will get to know about their criminal past through others, in the Netherlands if\nex-offenders expect that they will have to provide a Certificate of Conduct. As requests\nfor the Certificate have increased five-fold in the past decade and keep rising every year,\nself-exclusion, based on an expected negative outcome, is likely to increase as well. The\nchoice to withdraw from the labour market can even be reinforced by risk-averse atti-\ntudes emerging from the public, the media and politics at the macro level. Such exclusive\nattitudes seem to be more prevalent in the Netherlands and can reinforce both formal and\ninformal obstacles for ex-offenders in the labour market.\nConclusion\nThe title of this article refers to criminal records as `hidden' obstacles. Previous com-\nparative research on their impact in ex-offenders' lives mainly focused on differences in\nlegal and administrative terms. Yet, when the law is studied not only in books but also in\npractice, a totally different picture emerges. In this article, a comparative model is put\nforward to take comprehensively into account all the different elements that operate\nwithin the social context (such as politics, public opinion, the media and actions by social\ncontrol agents), which can \u00ad eventually \u00ad lead to discrimination and (self-)exclusion\nfrom the labour market. Basically, this model brings together within the same framework\nsocial norms at the macro level, social actors at the meso level and individual strategies\nand choices at the micro level.\nTo study the impact of having a criminal record, the perceptions of individuals should\nbe taken into account, but their attitudes are \u00ad at the same time \u00ad shaped by the messages\nthey receive from their social context. Choices made at the macro and meso levels thus\ninfluence the strategies that ex-offenders follow to find employment, and are therefore\nfundamental to understanding the failure or success of their re-entry into the labour mar-\nket. Further research on the role, attitudes and choices of employers in particular could\nbe of much added value. Moreover, all factors at the three different levels and their rela-\ntive effects need to be `weighted'. In addition, methodological issues need to be consid-\nered in a future article, allowing us to compare the results of our qualitative research\nstudies in a methodologically rigorous way. We hope the current article contributes to\ncreating public policies adapted to specific national contexts, which avoid unforeseen\nand counterproductive collateral consequences of criminal records in the labour market.\nThe comparison between the Netherlands and Spain has `uncovered' three important\nelements that operate at these different levels. At a macro level, our first results seem to\nindicate that attitudes in a society towards risk and exclusiveness/inclusiveness are much\nmore significant than the more `visible' and mere legal ones of transparency/privacy.\nPrevious research frequently emphasized privacy dimensions; however, comparing\nSpain with the Netherlands helps to illustrate that these dimensions operate in another\nway and have a different impact. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the number of appli-\ncations for a Certificate of Conduct in the Netherlands is much higher than the number\nof requests for criminal record extracts in Spain, even though the Netherlands seems to\nuphold higher privacy standards that limit direct access to criminal conviction informa-\ntion. At a meso level, the impact of the stigma of having a criminal record depends not\nonly on the provisions established by law but also on choices regarding responsibility,\nrelevance and discrimination by agents who are fundamental in the process of re-entry,\nsuch as the social network and probation/reintegration agencies. At the micro level, self-\nexclusion seems to be a crucial yet mostly under-recognized mechanism that is important\nto explain unsuccessful re-entry into the labour market. All these elements are funda-\nmental for our understanding of the differences between countries in the obstacles that\nex-offenders face due to their having a criminal record.\n"
