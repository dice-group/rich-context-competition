For example, the semantic content of an image can alter its perceived duration, as\ncan physical properties like motion, numerosity, luminance, and size. This has been studied\nextensively with emotional images (see Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007 for review), and it has been\nfound that images associated with fear are judged as lasting for longer than neutral images\npresented for the same duration (Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012). For example, an image of an\nangry face is judged to have been present for longer than an image of a neutral face (Droit-\nVolet, Brunot, & Niedenthal, 2004). Positively valenced affective images can also distort\nperceived duration. Typically, high-arousal positive images are associated with relatively\nshorter duration estimates, whereas low-arousal images are associated with relatively\nlonger duration estimates (Angrilli, Cherubini, Pavese, & Mantredini, 1997; Smith,\nMcIver, Di Nella, & Crease, 2011). These valence-arousal effects can be understood within\nthe framework of scalar expectancy theory (SET; Gibbon, Church, & Meck, 1984).\nSET (Figure 1) proposes that humans use an internal pacemaker-accumulator clock to\njudge the duration of events. The pacemaker emits pulses at regular intervals. At the start of a\nto-be-timed event, the switch between the pacemaker and the accumulator closes, and ticks\nare transferred from the pacemaker to the accumulator. When the event ends, the switch\nopens and accumulation ceases. The number of ticks accumulated forms the subjective\nrepresentation of duration, so that more ticks equals more time. The number of\naccumulated ticks can then be compared with other duration representations stored in\nmemory to enable timed behaviour.\nLike many cognitive models, SET is somewhat metaphorical, particularly as it is unclear\nhow a pacemaker-accumulator clock would be implemented neurally. Furthermore, there is\nno consensus about whether there is a single pacemaker in the brain, or whether there are\nmany such internal clocks (Johnston, Arnold, & Nishida, 2006; Van Rijn & Taatgen, 2008).\nDespite uncertainty about neural implementation, the SET framework has been very\ninfluential, and it can explain many findings from human psychophysics, animal timing,\nand pharmacological studies (reviewed in Buhusi & Meck, 2005 or Coull, Cheng, & Meck,\n2011). Importantly, alterations of subjective duration can be divided into effects on\npacemaker speed and effects on the switch between the pacemaker and accumulator.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of scalar expectancy theory (SET: Gibbon, Church, & Meck, 1984).\nWhen participants verbally estimate the duration of stimuli, subjective duration increases\nwith actual duration. We can measure the slope and intercept of this relationship with linear\nregression. Changes in pacemaker speed typically alter the slope (e.g., Penton-Voak,\nEdwards, Percival, & Wearden, 1996; Wearden, Edwards, Fakhri, & Percival, 1998). That\nis, the difference between subjectively shorter and longer conditions is multiplicative and\ngrows with actual stimulus duration. Pacemaker speed is thought to be arousal sensitive\n(although arousal is not always defined or recorded independently). For example,\npacemaker speed can be increased by dopaminergic agonists such as amphetamine or\ndecreased with antagonists like haloperidol (Meck, 1983). Fearful stimuli (Fayolle, Gil, &\nlow-arousal positive images therefore lengthen duration estimates because of the arousal they\nproduce and the associated increase in pacemaker speed. Although pacemaker effects are\ntypically multiplicative, recent evidence suggests that emotional arousal effects on timing may\nextinguish at longer durations (greater than 1 second; Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012), meaning that\nslope effects are not ubiquitous with pacemaker output change.\nThe operation of the switch is governed by attention (Zakay & Block, 1997). Anything\nthat reduces attention to time stops or reduces the transfer of ticks from the pacemaker to the\naccumulator, and fewer ticks are ultimately accumulated, resulting in a shortening of\nsubjective duration. This is typically thought to manifest as an intercept effect. Reduced\nattention to time can explain why high-arousal positively valenced images and high-\narousal negative images produce opposite effects on time perception (Angrilli et al., 1997).\nThe high-arousal positive valenced images used in Angrilli et al. (1997) depicted naked people\nand erotic scenes, and the appetitive nature of these images, although arousing, detracts\nattention from ongoing tasks (Most, Smith, Cooter, Levy, & Zald, 2007). In the case of\ntiming, this distraction reduces the accumulation of ticks leading to a shortening of duration.\nWhile attention and arousal, as defined by SET, are able to explain the various effects of\nemotion on time perception, it should be noted that these explanations are somewhat\nunfalsifiable. For example, high-arousal negative valence images from the international\naffective picture system are both arousing and attention grabbing and could therefore\ntheoretically lead to both over and underestimations of duration. Indeed, the absence of\nobjective measures of attention and arousal during emotion-timing studies means that\nexplanations can be applied post hoc based on the semantic content of the stimulus.\nDiffering semantic content is not the only variable which complicates the understanding of\ndistortions to time. It is also unclear to what extent the nonsemantic physical image\nproperties are influencing perceived duration (e.g., complexity, size, and luminance). Image\ncomplexity, for example, as defined by algorithms that extract edges and symmetries, has\nbeen shown to influence duration estimates when explicit semantic content is present\n(Cardaci, Di Gesu\nSchoofs, 2014) but not when it is absent (Palumbo, Ogden, Makin, & Bertamini, 2014).\nIndeed, even in the absence of explicit semantic content, the number of discrete items in a\nstimulus (Xuan, Zhang, He, & Chen, 2007), stimulus luminance (Goldstone & Goldfarb,\nChattopadhyay, Sengupta, & Tripathi, 2004) have all been shown to influence perceived\nduration. Many of these purportedly affect timing because they increase arousal.\nTherefore, in studies in which images are used (e.g., the international affective picture\nsystem), but these factors are not explicitly controlled across conditions, it is unclear\nwhether nonaffective physical properties of the images contribute to the effects observed.\nThese concerns are somewhat allayed by the use of facial images expressing different\nemotional expressions as stimuli (Droit-Volet et al., 2004). However, the use of pink ovals\nOgden et al. 3\nas control stimuli (rather than neutral expressions), coupled with the distinct neural circuitry\nused in the processing of emotional faces (Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997), means\nthat further investigation is warranted to establish whether stimulus valence can influence\nperceived duration in the absence of these potential confounds.\nVisual symmetry provides an opportunity to study distortions to subjective duration while\ncontrolling for semantic content, differences in complexity, numerosity, colour, size, and\nluminance. Abstract visual symmetry is rated positively by most participants (Eisenman,\nis known that reflectional symmetry is associated with positive valence words in implicit\nassociation tests (Bertamini, Makin, & Rampone, 2013). This is unlikely to be a cultural\nwhim; many species have a preference for symmetrical mates (M\u00f8ller & Thornhill, 1998) and\nsymmetrical foods (Wignall, Heiling, Cheng, & Herberstein, 2006). It could be that\nphenotypic symmetry is a truthful indicator of health and genetic quality (Grammer, Fink,\nM\u00f8ller, & Thornhill, 2003), and there is some evidence that humans are sexually attracted to\nsymmetrical faces (Rhodes, Proffitt, Grady, & Sumich, 1998) and symmetrical bodies\n(Bertamini, Byrne, & Bennett, 2013). However, the ``good genes'' theory of symmetry\npreference has been questioned because the size of fluctuating asymmetries is often below\nperceptual discrimination thresholds (Swaddle, 1999), and there is not necessarily a reliable\neffect of symmetry on facial attractiveness once correcting for publication bias (van Dongen,\n2011). Alternatively, it may be that symmetry is liked simply because symmetry is quickly\nand fluently processed (Reber, 2012), producing maximal visual responses (Enquist &\nPalumbo, Ogden, Makin, and Bertamini (2015) recently demonstrated that symmetrical\nimages are judged to have been presented for longer than random images of the same\nobjective duration, even though the same patterns were evaluated positively by the\nparticipants. While this finding is consistent with the subjective lengthening reported for\nlow-arousal positive stimuli with explicit semantic content (Angrilli et al., 1997; Droit-\nVolet et al., 2004), the finding was not the focus of Palumbo et al. (2015). Here, we\nfollowed up the preliminary findings of Palumbo et al. (2015) in two new experiments. In\nExperiment 1, we measured verbal duration estimates for regular and random patterns that\nprotocol, the paired-comparison task, in which participants indicate which of two stimuli\n(A and B) lasted for longer. This method does not require participants to apply numerical\nlabels (e.g., 1000 ms) to the stimulus, thus confirming that the finding is not an artefact of\nverbal estimation itself.\nIn Experiment 1, we also explored two kinds of symmetry, reflection and rotation\n(Figure 2). Reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry are equally regular in the\nmathematical sense, but reflection is more salient for human observers (Mach, 1886/1959;\nthat temporal distortions are specific to the more obvious reflectional symmetry.\nAlternatively, it could be that any kind of visual regularity increases subjective duration.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nParticipants. Twenty-two participants (M age \u00bc 22.16 years, SD \u00bc 1.36) took part in\nExperiment 1. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants\nreceived \u00bb5 for participation. The experiment lasted 25 minutes. Participants provided\nwritten consent before taking part. Both experiments reported in this article were\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the Liverpool John Moores University and were\nconducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008).\nStimulus and apparatus. Example stimuli are shown in Figure 2. They were designed to be\nsimilar to those used in our previous work (Palumbo et al., 2015) and by Royer (1981).\nNovel patterns were generated afresh on every trial using the same algorithm,\nimplemented in Python using open source Psychopy software (Peirce, 2007). Stimuli\npatterns had two axis of symmetry: horizontal and vertical. The rotation patterns were 90\nrotations. This design meant that the information in a single quadrant was identical in\nreflection, rotation, and random trials. Regularity was determined by the spatial\nrelationship of elements across the quadrants. Importantly, the luminance, density, and\nsize of these patterns were all equal, so changes in perceived duration can only be\nattributed to regularity as such, or to differences in other low-level visual properties such\nas luminance.\nProcedure\nWe employed a 3 \u00c2 5 within-subjects design with image type (reflectional symmetry,\n1500 ms) as independent variables. The dependent variable was the estimated duration.\nThere were 12 repeats of each condition, giving 180 experimental trials in total.\nThere were an additional 30 filler trials (10 reflections, 10 rotations, and 10 random) where\nthe duration was selected at random from a uniform distribution ranging from 250 to\n1750 ms. The filler trials prevent participants from overlearning the five durations in the\nexperimental design. All 210 trials were presented in a random order. The experiment was\ndivided into 10 blocks of 21 trials, so participants could have take breaks between blocks.\nParticipants were seated approximately 60 cm from the computer screen. They were\ninstructed that they would be presented with images, and that their task was to estimate,\nin milliseconds, how long each image was displayed. Participants were informed that their\nestimates should be between 250 and 1750 ms. At the start of a trial, a fixation cross was\nFigure 2. Illustration of the image types used in the experiments. Left panel: reflectional symmetry. Middle\npanel: random. Right panel: rotational symmetry. Every trial used a different example without any repetition.\nOgden et al. 5\npresented in the centre of a grey background for 1000 ms, and a 500 Hz beep was also\npresented 200 ms to warn participants that the trial was about to start. The reflection,\nrotation, or random pattern then appeared on the screen. Following image presentation,\nparticipants were prompted to type their duration estimate in a dialogue box. No\nperformance feedback was given.\nAnalysis\nMean duration estimates were obtained in each condition for each participant. These data\npoints were then analysed with a 3 \u00c2 5-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA;\nms]). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor was applied when the assumption of\nsphericity was violated. We report partial Z2 values following significant effects.\nResults\nFigure 3 shows mean verbal estimates plotted against presentation duration for the three\nconditions (reflection, rotation, and random). Longer estimates were given for reflection\nimages, than rotation or random images, but only at shorter durations. There was no\ndifference in perceived duration at longer durations.\nA 3 \u00c2 5 repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of duration,\np\np\nFigure 3. Mean verbal estimates (ms) plotted against the standard duration (ms). Error bars show standard\nerror.\nThe interaction between pattern type and duration was also significant, F(8, 168) \u00bc 2.10,\np\n\u00bc .09. Post hoc tests (Bonferroni corrected) confirmed that significantly longer\nestimates were given for reflection than random or rotation (p < .001). There was no\nsignificant difference between estimates for random and rotation images (p \u00bc .99).\nFurther post hoc tests (Bonferroni corrected) showed significantly longer estimates for\nreflection than random for the 500 ms, and 1000 ms presentations (p < .05), there was also a\ntrend for the 750 ms (p \u00bc .055); however, there was no significant difference in estimates for\nwas no significant difference in estimations given for random and rotation at any duration\n(p > .05). Reflectional symmetry lengthened verbal estimates but only when the stimuli were\ndisplayed for less than 1 second.\nTo further analyse the difference across conditions, individual linear regressions were\nconducted on the mean verbal estimates produced by each participant for each condition.\nThis allowed us to examine the slope and the intercept of the functions. As shown in Figure 3,\nthe slope and intercept of the rotation and random conditions are comparable. Reflection has\na higher intercept but a shallower slope. A repeated measures ANOVA found a significant\np\nBonferroni corrected post hoc tests showed that intercepts were significantly greater in the\nreflection condition than the random or rotation conditions (p < .01), there was no difference\nbetween random and rotation (p \u00bc .53). The same analysis conducted on the slope of the\ngradients showed no significant difference in the slope for the random (M \u00bc .65, SD \u00bc .23),\np\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that reflectional symmetry was perceived as lasting for longer\nthan rotational symmetry or random. This therefore replicates the findings of Palumbo et al.\n(2015). It also confirms that temporal distortions to the perceived duration of visual stimuli\ncan occur in the absence of explicit semantic content and changes in the size, luminance, and\ncolour of the stimuli. Interestingly, reflectional symmetry only lengthened perceived duration\nwhen the stimuli were presented for less than 1 second. This is consistent with the sub-second\narousal effects found by Gil and Droit-Volet (2012).\nThe absence of temporal distortion for rotational symmetry is noteworthy. Rotation is\nequally regular in terms of rigid transformation (Mach, 1886/1959). However, we presume\nthat rotation was less perceptually obvious than reflection for our participants. Ideally, we\nwould have tested this assumption by running a secondary regularity discrimination\nexperiment using the same stimuli and same participants. However, this was probably not\nnecessary. We are confident that the perceptual advantage for reflection over rotation is near-\nuniversal for human observers. The salience of reflection is immediately apparent when\ndifference between reflection and rotation has been confirmed in numerous psychophysical\nstudies (for early e.g., see Palmer & Hemenway, 1978; Royer, 1981 and other reviewed in\nWagemans, 1995). Furthermore, it has been found that reflection produces a larger response\nthan rotation in the extrastriate symmetry sensitive network (Makin, Rampone, Pecchinenda,\n& Bertamini, 2013; Makin, Wilton, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012). Formal models of\nOgden et al. 7\n``perceptual goodness'' also assign lower scores to rotation than reflection (van der Helm &\nLeeuwenberg, 1996), and these models have been empirically validated (e.g., Nucci &\nWagemans, 2007). It may thus be that rotation does not have the same effect on subjective\nduration as reflection because it was less perceptually obvious.\nTo explore whether the results of Experiment 1 were an artefact of the verbal estimation\nprocedure, an Experiment 2 was conducted employing a paired-comparison methodology.\nOne potentially problematic feature of verbal estimation tasks like the one used in\nExperiment 1 is that participants tend to quantize their responses--that is, they are far\nmore likely to enter an estimate which ends in ``00.'' This behaviour has systematic\nconsequences on the variability of verbal estimates (which may otherwise remain a fixed\nproportion of the mean, see Wearden, 2015). Although quantization may not distort mean\nduration estimates (Wearden, 2015), it is prudent to replicate the results Experiment 1 with a\ndifferent procedure.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 tested whether the effect of reflection symmetry on perceived duration could be\nreplicated using a different paradigm. Of particular interest was whether reflectional\nsymmetry would be perceived as lasting for longer than nonsymmetrical stimuli when\npresented for short (<1 second) but not long (>1 second) durations. A modified version of\nthe paired-comparison task used in Wearden and Ferrara (1993) was used. Participants were\npresented with two images (one with a symmetrical configuration and the other with a\nrandom configuration), and they indicated which one lasted for longer, the first or the\nsecond. In some trials, the first and second images were of differing durations (difference\ntrials: 1 < 2, 2 > 1); in other trials, both images were presented for the same amount of time\n(same trials: 1 \u00bc 2). The responses on same trials were most interesting, as this show\ndifferences in the perceived duration of reflection and random images. Based on the\nfindings of Experiment 1, we anticipated that there would be a greater proportion of\nreflection than random stimuli chosen when the stimuli were presented for short (<1\nsecond) durations.\nMethod\nParticipants, stimulus, and apparatus. Twenty-four participants (M age \u00bc 18.96 years, 15 females,\nSD \u00bc 1.30) took part in Experiment 2. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision. Participants received \u00bb5 for participation. The stimuli and apparatus were the same as\nin Experiment 1, however only reflection and random images were used.\nProcedure\nParticipants were seated approximately 60 cm from the computer screen. They were\ninstructed that they would be presented with pairs of images, and that their task was to\nindicate which image was presented for longer, the first or the second image. Participants first\ncompleted a practice session consisting of 24 trials. Participants then completed a further six\nblocks of 48 experimental trials.\nAt the start of each trial, a fixation cross appeared in the centre of a grey screen\nfor 1000 ms. Following this, Image 1 was presented, followed by a delay of 500 ms,\nthen Image 2 was presented. On 50% of trials, Image 1 depicted reflectional symmetry,\nand on the other 50%, it was a random pattern. Participants were then instructed to\nindicate which image lasted for longer (by pressing 1 for Image 1 and 2 for Image 2). No\nperformance feedback was given. All trials were presented in a random order.\nThere were 144 short trials and 144 long trials. On 50% of the trials, the images in each\npair differed in duration (different trials). One image in each pair was labelled as the standard\nand the other the comparison. In short trials, the standard was presented for 400, 500, or\nthe comparison was calculated by multiplying the standard duration by .70, .80, .90, 1.10,\n1.20, and 1.30. Whether the standard or the comparison was presented first was\ncounterbalanced across the other independent variables in the experiment. On 50% of\nthe trials, both images were the same duration (same trials). The interesting metric is the\nproportion of reflection and random patterns judged to have been presented for longer when\nthey were presented for the same duration. Given the results of Experiment 1, we\nhypothesised that ``p longer'' would be significantly greater for reflection images than\nrandom images but only in the short duration range.\nResults\nFirst, data from ``same'' trials were analysed. Figure 4 shows the mean proportion of times\nthat reflection and random images were judged to be longer for the short and long trials. For\nthe short duration range, a binomial test showed that the proportion ``reflection long''\nFor the long duration range, a binomial test showed that the proportion ``reflection long''\nresponses (0.51) was not significantly different to the expected proportion (0.50), p \u00bc .24.\nHowever, we note that there was not a significant difference in the proportion of long\nresponses for reflection between the long and short conditions, t(23) \u00bc 1.14, p \u00bc .17.\nFigure 4. Mean proportion of long responses for reflection and random in the short (400\u00ad600 ms) and long\nOgden et al. 9\nFigure 5 shows the proportion of times that the comparison was selected as longer for\nrandom and reflection images for different trials. The upper panel shows data from the short\nduration range, and the lower panel shows data from the long duration range. Data from\neach duration range were analysed separately. For the short duration range, a repeated\nmeasures ANOVA with within-subject factors of image type (random vs. reflection) and\np\np\n\u00bc .05, the interaction between\nimage type and comparison standard ratio was also not significant, F(5, 110) \u00bc 2.08,\np\n\u00bc .08. The same analysis conducted on the long duration range similarly showed\np\np\n\u00bc .14, the interaction\nbetween image type and comparison standard ratio was also not significant, F(5, 110) \u00bc .85,\np\nDiscussion\nExperiment 2 confirmed that reflectional symmetry was perceived as lasting for longer than\nrandom, replicating the lengthening effect observed in Palumbo et al. (2015) and Experiment\n1. For ``same trials'' at short durations (<1 second), reflection was judged to last for longer\nthan random. When the images were displayed for long durations (>1 second), there was no\ndifference in the perceived durations. This also confirms the findings of Experiment 1:\nsymmetry affects duration judgements at short (<1 second) but not long durations (>1\nsecond), which is consistent with the work of Gil and Droit-Volet (2012). These effects\nshould be treated with some caution because the difference between long and short\nconditions was not itself statistically significant (see Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, &\nWagenmakers, 2011, for discussion of the dangers of over interpreting this scenario).\nWhen the images were of different durations, however, there was no effect of image type\non responding.\nGeneral Discussion\nExperiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that the perceived duration of a visual stimulus can be\ndistorted by the presence of symmetry. In Experiment 1, images depicting reflectional\nsymmetry were estimated as lasting for longer than rotation and random patterns. In\nExperiment 2, reflectional symmetry was perceived as lasting for longer than random\npatterns when the actual presentation duration was identical. In both experiments, this\nlengthening effect is only occurred when the stimuli were presented for less than 1 second.\nThe effect is not therefore an artefact of either experimental paradigm. Symmetry, therefore,\nlengthens the subjective presentation duration of short, but not long, images. Critically, these\ndistortions existed in the absence of changes in the stimulus luminance, size, and colour, and\nin the absence of explicit semantic content within the image being judged. These experiments\ntherefore demonstrate that affective modulation of timing is not dependent on changes in\nlower level image properties, or explicit semantic content.\nThe subjective lengthening of the duration of reflectional symmetry is consistent with other\nreports of longer perceived duration for low-arousal positively valenced images (Angrilli\nother forms of low-arousal positively valenced stimuli, reflection may have lengthened\nsubjective estimates of duration because it increased arousal. According to SET, the rate\nthat the pacemaker emits output is arousal sensitive, so arousing stimuli are judged as lasting\nlonger. Reflectional symmetry is aesthetically pleasing and is preferred by humans (Cardenas\nand animals (Wignall et al., 2006) . In humans, this preference has been demonstrated\nFigure 5. Mean proportion of ``comparison long'' responses plotted against the comparison or standard.\nUpper panel shows data from the short duration range and lower panel shows data from the long duration\nrange.\nexplicitly and implicitly (Makin et al., 2012). The increased arousal elicited by reflectional\nsymmetry, as opposed to rotational symmetry or random, may have led to an increase in\npacemaker output rate and a longer perceived duration.\nThe effect of arousal on pacemaker rate is typically thought of as multiplicative (i.e., the\nincreased rate has a larger effect at longer durations) which manifest as condition-based\ndifferences in the slope of the estimation gradient. In the current study, however,\nsymmetry only consistently lengthened duration estimates when the stimuli were presented\nfor less than 1 second, no lengthening effect was observed for stimuli presented for longer\nthan 1 second. Consequently, the difference in the slope of gradients was not significant.\nThere was however a significant difference in the intercepts of the gradients. This is not the\nfirst instance in which intercept differences have been observed in the absence of slope\ndifferences when comparing purportedly arousing and neutral stimuli (Jones & Ogden,\nIndeed some studies demonstrating lengthening of the perceived duration of arousing\nstimuli show no difference in the slope and intercept of the verbal estimation gradients\n(Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012), whereas others show significant differences in both the slope\nand the intercepts of the gradients (Ogden et al., 2015). The absence of consistent slope\nand intercept differences, despite evidence of subjective lengthening, supports Matthews\n(2011) caution against the use of slope and intercept information alone as indicators of\ninternal clock effects.\nThe time-limited effects observed in this and other studies using visual stimuli (e.g., Gil &\nDroit-Volet, 2012) contrast markedly with the effects of increased arousal on the perceived\nduration of arousing auditory and somatosensory stimuli (Fayolle et al., 2015; Ogden et al.,\n2015) where greater effects are clearly observable at durations beyond 1 second. This cross-\nmodal comparison may suggest that arousal effects for visual stimuli decay more quickly than\nfor stimuli of other modalities. However, we caution that the term ``arousal'' has several\nmeanings in neuroscience. It is unlikely that mere presentation of visual reflectional symmetry\nproduced adrenaline release and activation of sympathetic nervous system. Reflection might\nproduce cortical arousal, perhaps via reduction in alpha oscillations (e.g., Klimesch, Sauseng,\n& Hanslmayr, 2007). Of course, we did not record any form of arousal independently here, so\nthe claim that reflection increased subjective duration via arousal is circular. We also note\nthat different cognitive mechanisms may be required for timing sub- and supra-second\nstimuli. There is a debate about whether there is a central, supramodal clock in the brain,\nas SET implies, or whether multiple timing systems are recruited in difference modalities and\ndimensions (Johnston et al., 2006, Van Rijn & Taatgen, 2008). Coull, Cheng, and Meck\n(2011) reviewed recent literature and concluded that the results are consistent with a\nsupramodal clock in the dorsal striatum of the basal ganglia and presupplementary motor\narea, but that distributed timing mechanisms may dominate in the sub-second range. This all\nremains controversial. However, it is interesting that these results tentatively support a\ndissociation between effects sub- and supra-second intervals.\nThe fact that subjective lengthening was only found for reflection, and not rotation is\ninteresting. We speculate that this is because reflectional symmetry is biologically relevant,\nand more likely to produce an emotional response. However, we also note that reflectional\nsymmetry is more obvious to human observers than rotation, even when the number of\nmagnitude of temporal distortion is proportional to the salience of the regularity. This\naccount predicts that any manipulation that varies perceptual goodness of the patterns\nshould alter perceived duration in a systematic way. For example, reflection with more\naxes should be perceived as lasting longer (cf. van der Helm & Leeuwenberg, 1996). This\ncould be tested in future work. The results of Experiment 1 suggest that reflection was\nresponsible for lengthening subjective duration (rather than random shortening subjective\nduration). With the rotation condition, it would be impossible to discriminate between\nthese accounts. Further work will be required to isolate the specific property of reflection\nresponsible for this effect.\nConclusions\nImages displaying reflectional symmetry are perceived as lasting for longer than images\ndisplaying rotational symmetry or random configurations. This lengthening effect only\nconsistently occurs however for images presented for less than 1 second. The presence\nof symmetry has little effect on images presented for longer than 1 second. This suggests\nthat arousal effects of visual stimuli may decay more quickly than for other\nmodalities. Distortions to the perceived duration of an image can occur in the absence\nof explicit semantic content and in the absence of physical changes in image, luminance,\nand size.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This research project is supported by the Economic and Social Research\nCouncil (ESRC, Ref.
