We aimed to verify whether exposure to violent video games is linked to problems\nof aggression in a sample of Italian children. Four questionnaires were administered to 346 children between 7 and 14 years\nof age, attending primary and secondary schools in Northern Italy. Variables measured were externalization, quality of\ninterpersonal relationships, aggression, quality of coping strategies, and parental stress. Participants who preferred violent\ngames showed higher scores for externalization and aggression. The use of violent video games and age were linked to higher\nlevels of aggression, coping strategies, and the habitual video game weekly consumption of participants. Our data confirm the\nrole of violent video games as risk factors for problems of aggressive behavior and of externalization in childhood and early\nadolescence.\n",

More than two thirds\nto 19-year-old Europeans regularly use them (Interactive\nSoftware Federation of Europe, 2010). VG contents are often\nviolent, requiring the player to overtly injure or kill \"ene-\nmies\" to progress in the game. These contents are often dis-\nplayed with a very high degree of realism, due to the fast and\nconstant technological evolution of consoles and personal\ncomputers.\nAs Gentile and Gentile (2008) point out, VGs are \"exem-\nplary teachers\" and are among the most effective learning\ntools available to youth. Thus, the possibility of realistically\nmimicking aggressive behaviors could lead the player to\nlearn and practice violent scripts. Regarding the outcomes of\nthis \"training,\" short- and long-term effects of interaction\nwith violent VGs were studied in the literature as early as the\nhighlighted that exposure to violent VGs could encourage\naggressive cognitions and behaviors in young players (cf.\nFrom the 2000s, this field of study flourished, including\nexperimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal research as\nwell as meta-analyses. A substantial body of research of vari-\nous types--cross-sectional (Anderson & Dill, 2000;Anderson,\nGentile, & Buckley, 2007; Funk, Baldacci, Pasold, &\nHuesmann, Korchmaros, & Reisner, 2014)--show a very\nlikely causal relationship between the habitual use of violent\nVGs and the presence of aggressive thoughts and behaviors in\nchildren and adolescents. Violent VG playing is correlated not\nonly with those measures of aggression usually implemented\nin experimental studies (e.g., administering loud noises to\nother participants) but also with more serious forms of aggres-\nsion such as antisocial and delinquent behavior (cf. DeLisi,\nVaughn, Gentile, Anderson, & Shook, 2013).

Finally, meta-analyses confirm these findings:\nN = 130,534) and verified that exposure to violence in VGs is,\non the whole, positively associated with aggressive behavior,\naggressive cognitions, and physiological arousal, and nega-\ntively associated with empathy and prosocial behavior. A\nrecent meta-analysis by Greitemeyer and M\u00fcgge (2014) con-\nfirmed these results, and showed that violent VGs increase\naggression and decrease prosocial behaviors, while prosocial\nVGs promote prosocial outcomes.\nThe interplay between use of violent media--and spe-\ncifically violent VGs--and the consequences on children\nand adults was analyzed according to a number of theories\nsuch as Cognitive Association Theory, Social Learning\nTheory, and Script Theory (for a review, see Anderson &\nBushman, 2002). More recently, the General Aggression\nModel (GAM; Anderson & Bushman, 2002; Anderson &\nAnderson, 2011) has been established as one of the most\ninfluential models in explaining the effects of exposure to\nviolent media on human aggressiveness. The model dis-\ncriminates between distal factors (which influence behav-\nior in the long term) and proximal factors (which influence\nbehavior in the short term: Violent VG use is an example of\na proximal factor). The model stresses an individual's dis-\npositional variables (e.g., personality), biological/physio-\nlogical variables, and environmental variables. These\nvariables are taken to assume the role of a \"background\" on\nwhich proximal processes occur, both influencing the actual\nbehavior and engaging as feedback on the distal processes.\nIn the long term, these factors affect the personality, the\nphysiological processes, and the environment of the person.\nAccording to GAM, the reiteration of aggressive conduct\nwill influence future social behavior, modifying both the\nindividual and his or her context. On the whole, GAM is\nconsidered an empirically validated model that integrates\nthe effects of violent VGs on aggression into a comprehen-\nsive theoretical framework.\nA Risk and Resilience Framework for VG Use\nResearch has recently proposed a risk-resilience framework\nwith regard to the effects of violent VG on aggression. As\nGentile and Bushman (2012) point out, using violent media\ncould be seen as just one among various risk factors for sub-\nsequent aggressive behavior, such as hostile attribution bias,\nprior involvement in a physical fight, gender, and prior phys-\nical victimization. Thus, being exposed to violent VGs is not\nthe only factor that potentially predicts aggression. This\nexposure--to exert detectable effects on the user--must link\nwith other risk factors with a reciprocal exacerbating down-\nspiral effect (cf. Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003).\nIn this view, the fact that most children never commit an act\nof overt aggression despite having possibly consumed a lot\nof media and VG violence is explained by the existence of\nprotective factors, such as parental involvement in the use of\nmedia and VGs (Gentile, Reimer, Nathanson, Walsh, &\nThe degree of violence of VGs is not the only variable\ntaken into account as a risk factor. Also, the amount of VG\nplaying seems to be correlated with measures of aggression\nin childhood and adolescence. As Kuntsche (2004) and\nWallenius, Punam\u00e4ki, and Rimpel\u00e4 (2007) point out, more\nhours per week of VG playing were correlated with measures\nof aggression. Usually, children who prefer violent VGs are\nlikely to play with VGs for more hours than children who\nplay non-violent VGs (cf. Olson et al., 2007).\nWith reference to the interplay between age and use of\nviolent VGs, von Salisch, Vogelgesang, Kristen, and Oppl\n(2011) point out that there seem to be some differences\nbetween primary school children and early teenagers. In pri-\nmary school, the preference for VGs rises from 42% of first\ngraders to 86% of sixth graders (cf. Feierabend & Rathgeb,\n2009), signaling an emerging interest in VGs, including vio-\nlent ones. Not surprisingly, von Salisch et al. found that in\nthis age group, it seems that the selection hypothesis (e.g.,\nmore aggressive children tend to choose more violent VGs)\nprevails over the socialization hypothesis (e.g., using more\nviolent VG puts children at risk of developing aggression\nproblems). This is due to a progression of preference forma-\ntion: Children first experiment with different types of VGs,\nthen they differentiate and refine their preference for specific\ntypes of electronic games. Literature has not yet completely\naddressed other potential risk and protective factors in the\nassociation between use of violent VGs and increase in vio-\nlent behaviors. At the moment, at least three dimensions that\nare highly relevant from a developmental point of view have\nbeen overlooked in the literature: quality of interpersonal\nrelations, emotional and cognitive coping strategies, and\nparent\u00adchild relationship. To date, the literature has not yet\nassessed the possible correlation between violent VG use and\ninterpersonal relations (cf. Homer, Hayward, Frye, & Plass,\nLikewise, the relation between coping strategies and\ninteraction with violent VGs has received little attention in\nthe literature. A notable exception is the work from Reinecke\n(2009), which highlights that using VGs for recovering from\nstress and pain is linked with emotion-focused coping strate-\ngies. On a broader perspective, video gaming seems to pres-\nent some cognitive and emotional overlapping with those\ncoping strategies considered less adaptive, such as avoidance\nand distraction. However, to our knowledge to date, no\nresearch has specifically addressed video gaming as a coping\nstrategy. Olson (2010) pointed out that children often report\nusing VGs as a means to regulate their feelings, but the pre-\ncise nature of coping strategy could not be determined\nbecause results were derived from a survey and not from a\nstandardized coping measure.\nMilani et al. 3\nFinally, with regard to the third point of interest, we could\nhypothesize an interaction between the use of violent VGs and\ndifficulties in the parent\u00adchild relationship. We could think\nthat a parent who has to deal with an aggressive child could\nfeel stuck and immobilized into a stressful relationship with\nhis or her son/daughter. The opposite could also hold true: A\nchild whose parent is lacking responsivity due to a high level\nof stress could use violent VGs--which are often the most\nthrilling and immersive--as a means to momentarily escape\nfrom this difficult relationship. To date, to our knowledge, no\nresearch has addressed this issue, nor tested this hypothesis.\nAims of the Research\nThe research has the general aim of verifying in an Italian\nsample whether the preference for violent VGs is linked to\nproblems of aggressive behavior, of externalization, of inter-\npersonal relations, to worse coping strategies, and to parental\nstress. More specifically, it is hypothesized that,\nHypothesis 1: Participants who prefer to use VGs with\nviolent content present more problems of aggressiveness\nand externalization than participants who do not use vio-\nlent VGs.\nHypothesis 2: Participants who prefer to use VGs with\nviolent content present more interpersonal problems than\nparticipants who do not use violent VGs.\nHypothesis 3: Participants who use VGs with violent con-\ntent show a preference for those coping strategies consid-\nered less adaptive in developmental terms (i.e., distraction\ncoping and avoidance coping; cf. Fields & Prinz, 1997).\nHypothesis 4: Participants who use VGs with violent\ncontent show a more stressful relation with parents than\nparticipants who do not use violent VGs.\nMethod\nParticipants\nQuestionnaire packets were delivered to 471 children attend-\ning primary and secondary schools in Northern Italy. Of these,\none or more of the questionnaires were not completely\nanswered. The 346 remaining participants were between 7 and\nevenly divided by gender, with 170 male participants (49.1%;\nthe middle class (data assumed via a demographic question-\nnaire). All participants were of Caucasian ethnicity.\nProcedure\nHeads of the schools approved the school's participation in\nthe research project, agreed to the collection of data, and\ninformed the parents about the research. Researchers then\nexplained the research to the students and gave them an\nenvelope to be handed over to their parents. The envelope\nincluded a document that described in detail the methodol-\nogy, aims of the research, and the contact information of the\nexperimenter in charge of the research; a consent form to be\nsigned by both parents prior to the administration of the\ninstruments; and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and\nParenting Stress Index (PSI) questionnaires (cf. below) to be\ncompiled together by both parents if they agreed to partici-\npate in the research. The following day, experimenters pre-\nsented the research to the classrooms involved in the data\ncollection, collected the signed consent forms and the com-\npiled questionnaires, and collectively administered the ques-\ntionnaires to the children whose parents granted consent.\nParticipants were made aware that they could withdraw from\nthe research at any moment.\nMeasures Administered to Children\nInterpersonal relations. TRI (Test delle relazioni interperson-\nali [Test of Interpersonal Relations]; Bracken, 1993; Italian\nLikert-type scale and measures the quality of interpersonal\nrelationships (example of an item: \"I am treated fairly by my\nmother\"). The scale assesses the overall quality of relation-\nships and the quality of relations in specific domains: with\nparents, with peers, and with teachers. Only the overall score\nof interpersonal relations was considered for this study.\nCronbach's alpha was .96 for the overall score.\nCoping strategies.CCSC-R1 (Children's Coping Strategies\nChecklist\u00adRevised 1; Ayers & Sandler, 2009; Italian version:\nCamisasca, Caravita, Milani, & Di Blasio, 2012). The instru-\nment measures the preferential cognitive strategies used by\nchildren and adolescents to cope with situations perceived as\nproblematic or stressful. It consists of 54 items on a 1 to 4\nLikert-type scale (example of an item: \"When I have a prob-\nlem, I listen to music\"). The instrument provides four scales\nfor the following coping strategies: Active, Support Seeking,\nAvoidance, and Distraction. The highest score of the four\nscales indicates the subject's preferred coping strategy. Cron-\nbach's alphas were .81 for the Active scale, .79 for the Sup-\nport Seeking scale, .77 for the Avoidance scale, and .79 for\nthe Distraction scale.\nAggression.AFV (Indicatori della capacit\u00e0 di adattamento\nsociale in et\u00e0 evolutiva\u00adAggressivit\u00e0 Fisica e Verbale [Indi-\ncators of Physical and Verbal Aggression]; Caprara, Pas-\ntorelli, Barbaranelli, & Vallone, 1992). The instrument\nmeasures the tendency to commit aggressive physical and\nverbal acts by means of 15 items on a 1 to 3 Likert-type scale\n(example of an item: \"I happen to have the impulse to hit\nsomeone\").1 It provides a single overall score of aggressive\nbehavior. Cronbach's alpha was .84.\n4 SAGE Open\nAd hoc questionnaire for VG habits. Instrument comprised of\nert-type scale. The questionnaire was developed to investi-\ngate habits in the use of VGs, including the level of violence\nof the preferred VGs and the amount of VG use. For this\nresearch, two factors were taken into consideration: the pref-\nerential use of violent VGs and the frequency of use of VGs\nper week (independently of their content). Participants were\nrequested to specify their three preferred VG titles in the last\nyear. Subsequently, VG titles were categorized as \"violent\"\nor \"non-violent\" by two independent double-blind raters,\nwho are expert2 in VGs (Cohen's k = .830). Participants who\nmentioned at least two violent VGs were categorized as vio-\nlent VG users. The rating of VGs was coherent with the Pan\nEuropean Game Information (PEGI) rating for all VGs (cf.\nMilani, Camisasca, Caravita, & Di Blasio, 2012). Moreover,\nthe degree of violence in the VGs used by each participant\nwas computed by multiplying the violent content and the\nweekly time spent on VGs (similarly to Gentile et al., 2014).\nMeasures Administered to Parents\nExternalization.CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist; Achen-\nmeasures adjustment problems in children and adolescents\nand is comprised of 112 items on a 1 to 3 Likert-type scale,\nrequiring parents to rate how often each applies for his or her\nchild (example of an item: \"Can't concentrate, can't pay\nattention for long\"). It consists of eight syndromic scales and\ntwo general scales of Internalization and Externalization.\nThis article is concerned with scores more relevant to behav-\nioral problems: Externalization, Aggressive behavior, and\nDelinquent behavior. Cronbach's alphas were as follows: for\nExternalization .87, for Aggressive behavior .82, and for\nDelinquent behavior .84.\nParenting stress. PSI (Parenting Stress Index; Abidin, 1995;\nItalian version: Guarino, Di Blasio, D'Alessio, Camisasca, &\nSerantoni, 2008). The instrument measures the degree of\nstress experienced by a parent while exercising his or her\nparental role. The measure consists of 36 items on a 1 to 5\nLikert-type scale and provides a general score of parental\nstress (example of an item: \"I feel trapped by my responsi-\nbilities as a parent\"). Cronbach's alpha was .81.\nResults\nData Analysis Strategy\nData were analyzed following a three-step strategy. First,\ndescriptive analyses were performed on the sample. Second,\ntwo sets of student's t tests and chi square tests were performed\nto assess gender differences and differences between users and\nnon-users of violent VGs. Third, two sets of three-step hierar-\nchical regressions were performed to verify the association of\nviolent VG use with externalization (CBCL) and aggression\n(AFV). Hierarchical regressions were performed to highlight\nthe contribution of each single potential predictor of external-\nization and aggression. In particular, we decided to adopt a\nthree-step approach to single out the relative contribution to\nvariance of the following subsets of variables: (a) the habitual\nuse of violent VGs; (b) demographic variables such as age and\ngender; and (c) other potential predictors of problems of\naggression such as coping strategies (CCSC-R1), parental\nstress (PSI), and quality of relationships (TRI).\nDescriptive Statistics\nspecific VG machine; that is, personal computer and/or\nVG console) for an average of 6.84 hr per week (SD =\n(N = 116) habitually used violent VGs, and the degree of\nviolence in the VGs used by the participants ranged from 0\nthe general population (cf. Caprara et al., 1992).The CBCL\nof participants were in the non-clinical range. These distri-\nbutions also are in line with those of the general population\n(cf. Frigerio, 2001). The prevalent coping strategy was\nthis score is in line with that of the general population (cf.\nGender Differences\nBoys obtained higher aggression scores than girls in the AFV\n.001). Boys also used more frequently violent games than\ncoherent with the literature (Caprara et al., 1992; Olson et al.,\n2007). No gender differences emerged concerning the qual-\nity of relationships (TRI), coping strategies (CCSC-R1), and\nparenting stress (PSI).\nDifferences Between Users and Non-Users of\nViolent VGs\nAs shown in Table 1, the participants in our sample who\nuse violent VGs showed higher scores on externalization\n(CBCL), aggression (AFV scale), and on avoidance coping\n(CCSC-R1). They also used VGs for more hours per week,\nand are older. No significant differences were found\nregarding the quality of interpersonal relations (TRI), the\nMilani et al. 5\nthree remaining coping strategies (CCSC-R1), or the dis-\ntribution of frequency for the coping strategy preferen-\nRegression Analyses\nTo further test the four hypotheses, two sets of three-step\nhierarchical regressions were performed. In the first regres-\nsion model, the aggression score (AFV) was inserted as cri-\nterion variable, and the following variables were inserted as\npredictors: preferential use of violent VGs [Step 1], age and\ngender [Step 2], coping strategies (four CCSC-R1 scores),\nquality of relationships (TRI), and parental stress (PSI) [Step\n3]. In the second regression model, the externalization score\n(CBCL) was inserted as criterion variable, and the following\nvariables were inserted as predictors: preferential use of vio-\nlent VGs [Step 1], age and gender [Step 2], coping strategies\n(four CCSC-R1 scores), quality of relationships (TRI), and\nparental stress (PSI) [Step 3]. As can be seen in Table 2, pref-\nerential use of violent VGs remains a significant predictor of\nproblems of aggression in all three steps. Even when other\npotential risk factors for aggression such as parental stress,\ndysfunctional coping strategies, and interpersonal relations\nare inserted in the model, the preferential use of violent VGs\nremains the more relevant predictor of aggressive problems.\nMoreover, the increase in R2 is non-significant from Step 2 to\nStep 3: Inserting the other potential risk factors do not\nthe contrary, as shown in Table 3, with regard to externaliza-\ntion, the preferential use of violent VGs is a significant\npredictor in Steps 1 and 2 but not in Step 3. In Step 3, the\npredictive weight of parental stress and interpersonal rela-\ntionships overshadows the use of violent VGs. Moreover, the\nincrease in R2 from Step 2 to Step 3 is very significant,\nTable 1.

They also tend to use VGs for more hours per\nweek compared with participants who do not use violent\nVGs. Also, users of violent VGs are older than users of non-\nviolent VGs. This result seems to support von Salisch et al.'s\n(2011) \"progression\" in the development of a preference for\nviolent VGs: Younger children tend to experiment with dif-\nferent types of VGs, and the more aggressive of them choose\nviolent VGs over non-violent ones in keeping with the\n\"selection hypothesis.\"\nOn the whole, the results allow us to draw some conclu-\nsions. First, there is an association between the preferential\nuse of VGs with violent content and problems of aggression.\nOur data show that the users of violent games obtained\nhigher scores on all the scales related to problems of aggres-\nsiveness, namely, AFV and CBCL externalization. This\nresult seems to be solid, as it has not only been found by\ncontrasting via t tests the two populations of users and non-\nusers of violent VGs but also been confirmed in the two\nmodels of regression analysis.\nHowever, with regard, more specifically, to problems of\nexternalization, the habitual use of violent VGs seems to be\nless relevant as a predictor than other--more significant--risk\nfactors such as parental stress and interpersonal relations.\nUsing violent VGs seems to put minors at risk of developing\nexternalizing problems only in the presence of other more sig-\nnificant risk factors. This result seems to be quite in line with\nthe literature, as shown by Gentile and Bushman (2012):\nViolent media exposure is not the most important risk factor\nfor developmental problems, when other more contextual risk\nfactors are taken into account. Moreover, the construct of\nexternalization itself is an overarching developmental out-\ncome that encompasses different problems and not just those\nof aggression (i.e., attention problems, defiant and rule-break-\ning behavior). Thus, it seems understandable that the associa-\ntion of a rather proximal and limited risk factor such as violent\nVG exposure with externalization ceases to be detectable\nwhen more contextual factors enter into play. Nonetheless, our\ndata seem to confirm the role of violent VGs as a potential risk\nfactor for problems of aggressive behavior and of externaliza-\ntion. Again, as the literature points out, it is unlikely that using\nviolent VGs alone could be a necessary or sufficient cause for\nan increase in aggression or externalizing behavior. Rather, it\nis the combination of multiple risk factors that increases the\nrisk of aggression or externalizing behavior (cf. Gentile &\nThe outcomes of our research, of course, can hardly be\nconsidered definitive as we could not control the effect of\nother potential mediating variables such as the general atti-\ntude toward aggressiveness witnessed by the child in his or\nher family and proximal environment, the degree of involve-\nment of parents in children's play with VGs, the level of cog-\nnitive development of the child or preadolescent, or--more\ngenerally--the child's temperament and personality traits.\nHowever, as longitudinal research on the topic points out, the\neffects of violent VGs upon aggressive behavior and cogni-\ntions seem to be more relevant than the effects of violent\nbehavior and cognitions upon the choice of VGs. In other\nwords, the socialization hypothesis is more relevant than the\nselection hypothesis (cf. M\u00f6ller & Krah\u00e9, 2009), at least for\nolder children and early teenagers. Moreover, as the \"down-\nward spiral\" effect suggests (cf. Slater et al., 2003; von\nSalisch et al., 2011), the more a child chooses violent VGs,\nthe more he or she will be reinforced in aggressive thoughts\nand representations, which in turn will lead him or her to opt\nfor violent VGs. Moving from these assumptions, it is likely\nthat also in our sample, the correlation between the use of\nviolent VGs can be ascribed to the socialization hypothesis:\nChildren who spend more time playing more violent VGs are\nat risk of developing problems of aggression.\nWith regard to coping strategies, a significant difference\nemerged between users and non-users of violent VGs.\nParticipants who use violent VGs have higher scores in the\nAvoidance Coping as measured by the CCSC-R1. From a cog-\nnitive point of view, this result suggests that there could be an\noverlap between the decision of playing a violent VG and the\nefforts to avoid disturbing thoughts. Given the fact that violent\nvideo games are often the most enthralling from a perceptive\nTable 3. Second Hierarchical Regression Model.\nPredictor R2  t\nNote.

The work from\nReinecke (2009) seems to support this hypothesis.\nUnfortunately, with regard to coping strategies, at the\nmoment, our data do not allow us to assess whether playing\nVGs puts youth at risk of being more aggressive or whether\nit is used as a means to canalize troubling thoughts and\nimpulses. Both explications could hold true at the same time:\nA child who habitually chooses to play violent VGs becomes\nslightly more prone to aggressive thoughts and cognitions. In\nturn, when troubled by something, this child could resort\nmore easily to violent VGs as a means to cope with the situ-\nation, possibly due to more violent game-related cognitions\nand also to the availability of more violent game titles in his\nor her gaming library. Indeed, sometimes children use VGs\nalso as a mean to regulate feelings (cf. Olson, 2010). What\nremains still unclear is whether children specifically choose\nviolent VGs over non-violent VGs as a coping strategy, par-\nticularly when they need to deal with aggressive thoughts.\nSome results from Olson et al. (2007) seem to support this\nview, but more research is needed about this issue.\nContrary to our expectations, neither parenting stress nor\nthe quality of interpersonal relations added a significant con-\ntribution to the model. With regard to the first, it could be\nargued that parenting stress is quite a distal factor in the\ninterplay between familial relational and emotional climate\nand children's management of free-time activities. Of course,\nparental stress has a great impact upon the overall family\nclimate, but it is difficult to single out a clear significant\neffect of parenting stress upon the children's media choice.\nFerguson, San Miguel, and Hartley (2009), in fact, showed\nthat although the family climate--in terms of negative rela-\ntions with adults and family conflict--was a potential pre-\ndictor of aggression, it was not specifically correlated with\nthe use of violent VGs. More research is needed on this topic\nto clarify the impact of family climate--and particularly of\nparental stress--upon the media choice of children.\nWith regard to interpersonal relations, Goldstein (1999)\nargues that--at least for boys--violent VGs (and violent\nmedia in general) could actually be a means for bonding\nrelationships with peers. Jansz (2005), in fact, remarks that\nmale adolescents in particular could decide for a violent\nVG over a non-violent VG also due to their potential for\nsocializing with peers' negative emotions such as anger,\nfear, and disgust, and for sharing insecurities related with\nthe acquisition of a more adult identity. Olson, Kutner, and\nWarner (2008) found similar results in a series of focus\ngroups with young video gamers. Olson et al. (2007) found\nthat the use of violent or M-rated VGs in childhood and\npreadolescence is linked with social play with friends,\nrather than with solitary activities. Olson et al. (2009),\nfinally, speculate that the use of M-rated VGs could be seen\nas normative, at least for boys, in preadolescence. Thus, we\ncould conclude that, from this point of view, the use of vio-\nlent VGs could be expected and even be highly regarded by\npeers, especially by male teenagers.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe research presents some limitations. First, the question-\nnaires administered--although being appropriate for the\nmeasurement of variables of interest--are self-report. While\nour study included multiple informants (children and par-\nents), it would be appropriate to include measures from more\nsources (e.g., teachers).\nSecond, the instrument on Coping was not specifically\ndesigned to assess the use of VGs as a specific coping strat-\negy. Thus, data about coping strategies need to be considered\nconservatively as participants were not specifically asked if\nthey used VGs as a means to deal with stress or difficulties.\nThird, the most evident limitation of the research is its\ncorrelational methodology. The presence of simple relations\nof co-presence between the use of violent VGs and problems\nof aggressiveness does not allow us to draw any conclusion\nin terms of causality. Future longitudinal studies will allow\nthe amending of these limitations and consolidate these pre-\nliminary results.\nTo conclude, this research seems to confirm the general\nresults of the international literature also in the Italian set-\nting. The connection between the use of violent VGs and\nproblems of aggressiveness in children and preadolescents\nseems to be quite solid.\n"
