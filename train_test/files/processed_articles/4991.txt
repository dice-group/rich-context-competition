Septic shock is a\nsubset of sepsis in which there is circulatory,\ncellular and metabolic dysfunction, and is\nassociated with a higher risk of mortality.2\nUnderstanding the pathophysiology of\nsepsis is an important first step in improving\noutcomes. Despite prioritization of sepsis\nresearch over the past two decades, the\nprecise inflammatory dynamics of sepsis\nare still not completely understood, and\ninnovations in the management of sepsis\nhave been slow to appear. Consequently,\nthere is an urgent need to further investigate\nthe underlying pathophysiology of sepsis,\nand to develop new treatment strategies.\nThe receptor for advanced glycation end\nproducts (RAGE) is a member of the\nimmunoglobulin superfamily. This super-\nfamily engages numerous ligands and exhi-\nbits expression on many cells types.3\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that\nRAGE is a critical component of the dele-\nterious effects of acute inflammatory dis-\norders, including sepsis. Binding of ligands\nto RAGE can trigger several intracellular\nsignaling cascades, leading to translocation\nof NF-kB. In turn, NF-kB induces RAGE\nexpression in a positive feedback loop. This\nleads to amplification of pro-inflammatory\nsignaling, sustained cellular inflammation,\ncellular dysfunction and tissue damage.4\nConsequently, RAGE might be a promising\ntarget for sepsis control strategies.\nInhibition of RAGE expression or activ-\nity has been found to reduce inflammatory\nresponses in several animal models, includ-\ning models of diabetic atherosclerosis,\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity and collagen-\ninduced arthritis.5 However, it has not yet\nbeen determined whether RAGE inhibition\nis beneficial in sepsis, as previous studies\nhave yielded conflicting results. Several\nstudies have suggested that RAGE inhib-\nition attenuates the systematic inflammatory\nresponse and ensuing organ damage.3,4\nOther studies have showed that RAGE\ninhibition causes an enhanced outgrowth\nof bacterial flora at the primary site of\ninfection, together with increased spread to\ndistant body compartments.5,6 To address\nthese discrepancies, we performed a system-\natic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the\nimpact of RAGE inhibition on the outcome\nof sepsis in animal models.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature search\nThe literature included in our analysis was\nselected from PubMed, ISI Web of Science\nand Elsevier-Scopus databases in April 2017.\nThe search terms ``receptor for advanced\nglycation end product'' or ``RAGE'' were\nused in combination with words related to\nsepsis, namely ``sepsis'', ``septic'', ``bacterial\ninfection'' or ``bacteremia''. We also manu-\nally extended our search to include the\nbibliographic reference lists of the research\narticles included in our study and relevant\nreview articles.\nEligible studies and data extraction\nEligible studies had to meet all the following\ncriteria: (1) in vivo controlled studies using\nan animal model with a sepsis challenge; (2)\nthe intervention group was homozygous\nRAGE knockouts (RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0), RAGE het-\nerozygotes (RAGE\u00fe/\u00c0) or wild-type (WT)\nanimals treated with anti-RAGE antibodies;\n(3) sepsis was induced by bacterial infection;\nand (4) the article was published in English.\nThe major reasons for exclusion of studies\nwere: (1) other methods of RAGE inhibition\nwere used, such as administration of soluble\nRAGE (sRAGE), that not only block the\nRAGE pathway, but also other pathways\n12 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\nrelated to sepsis, such as toll-like receptor\npathways; (2) the data were overlapping;\nand (3) full texts of the publications were not\navailable.\nTwo authors (Zhao X and Liao YN)\nindependently extracted the data from all\neligible studies, including the first author,\npublication year, country, RAGE inhibition\nmethod, method of sepsis induction,\ninfection type, antibiotics applied and\nbasic experimental animal information.\nDiscrepancies between the two authors in\nterms of study inclusion and data extraction\nwere resolved by discussion among all\nauthors.\nQuality assessments of included studies\nA checklist modified from the Collaborative\nApproach to Meta-Analysis and Review of\nAnimal Data from Experimental Studies\n(CAMARADES) was used to assess the\nmethodological quality of the included stu-\ndies.7 One point was tallied for written\nevidence of each of the following criteria:\npeer-reviewed publication, randomization\nof subjects into treatment groups, blind\nassessment of outcomes, monitoring of\nphysiological parameters such as blood\npressure, calculation of the sample size\nnecessary to achieve sufficient power, state-\nment of compliance with animal welfare\nregulations, avoidance of anesthetic agents\nrelated to outcome of sepsis, statement of\npotential conflicts of interest, and use of a\nsuitable animal model.\nStatistical methods\nIf appropriate comparisons between the\nRAGE inhibition group and control group\nwere available for a selected study, a meta-\nanalysis was conducted. Otherwise, a\ndescriptive review of the identified evidence\nwas carried out. For the survival rate, a\nhazard ratio (HR) is recommended as the\nmost appropriate statistic because it allows\nfor differences in sample size and time to an\nevent. However, no study reported HR\ndirectly, so an alternative method for\nextracting summary statistics from survival\ncurves was used for the meta-analysis of\ntime-to-event outcomes.8 We also con-\nducted a subgroup analysis for three differ-\nent microbial infection types: polymicrobial\ninfection, Gram positive (G\u00fe) or Gram\nnegative (G\u00c0). A P-value less than 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nStatistical analysis was performed using the\nReview Manager (RevMan5.3) package\nprovided by the Cochrane Library.\nResults\nDescriptions of the included studies\nThe comprehensive search strategy on the\nimpact of RAGE inhibition on sepsis in\nanimal models resulted in 852 records. After\nduplicates were removed, 376 studies\nremained. After title and abstract screening,\n32 full-text studies were screened.\nUltimately, 11 studies were included in\nour systematic review and meta-analysis\nthe effects of RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0, RAGE\u00fe/\u00c0, and\nanti-RAGE antibody administration on\nsepsis separately; these experiments were\ntreated as three separate studies.\nRamsgaard et al.13 and Achouiti et al.18\nalso used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce\nsepsis to examine RAGE inhibition. These\nresults were also included in this analysis.\nThe characteristics of all included studies\nare summarized in Table 1. These charac-\nteristics varied considerably between the\nstudies, particularly the method used to\ninduce sepsis. Three studies used\nEscherichia coli, two studies used cecal liga-\ntion and puncture (CLP), two studies used\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, two studies used\nStaphylococcus aureus, two studies used LPS\nin additional experiments, one study used\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, and the remaining\nstudy used Acinetobacter baumannii.\nMethodological quality of included studies\nOverall, the quality score for the eleven\nincluded studies was moderate (mean 5.3),\nwith scores ranging from 5 to 7. No study\ndescribed the randomization of animals into\ntreatment groups, nor the sample size\ncalculation to achieve sufficient power.\nOnly one study reported monitoring of\nphysiological parameters, and only\ntwo studies stated that the outcome meas-\nures were assessed by experimenters\nwho were blind to the treatment condition\n(Table 2).\nOverall analysis of survival rate\nSix of the studies presented Kaplan-Meier\nsurvival curves comparing the RAGE inhib-\nition group and the control group following\nthe survival curves is summarized in Table 3.\nMeta-analysis of these studies revealed that\nthe RAGE inhibition group had a signifi-\ncantly higher survival rate than the control\nFigure 2).\nSubgroup analysis of survival rate\nWe conducted a subgroup analysis per\ninfectious type. For polymicrobial infection,\nmeta-analysis of two studies (including five\nexperiments)9,10 revealed that RAGE inhib-\nition had a significant survival benefit over\nFor G\u00fe bacterial infection, meta-analysis of\ntwo studies11,15 also demonstrated a signifi-\ncant survival benefit for RAGE inhibition\nheterogeneity was found for this outcome\nrevealed that RAGE inhibition had a\nhigher survival rate than the control,\nalthough the difference was not statistically\nP \u00bc 0.60; Figure 2).

However, Noto et al. found\nthat RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 mice had significantly\nreduced bacterial burdens in comparison\nInflammatory cell influx\nNine studies investigated the impact of\nRAGE inhibition on inflammatory cell\ninflux during sepsis. For polymicrobial\ninfection, Liliensiek et al. found reduced\nnumbers of inflammatory cells adherent to\nthe peritoneum of the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group\ncompared with that of the WT group.9 For\nG\u00fe bacterial infection, van Zoelen et al.11\nand one study from Achouiti et al. found a\ndecreased influx of inflammatory cells in the\nRAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group compared with the WT\ngroup.

For polymicrobial infection,\nLiliensiek et al. found that the plasma\ncytokine levels did not differ significantly\nbetween the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group and the WT\ngroup.9 For G\u00fe bacterial infection, van\nZoelen et al.11 found that interleukin (IL)-6\nwas reduced in the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group, while\nAchouiti et al. found that tumor necrosis\nfactor (TNF)-a and IL-6 were both reduced\nin the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group.15 For G\u00c0 bacterial\ninfection, van Zoelen et al.12, Achouiti et al.\nand Noto et al. all found that the anti-\ninflammatory cytokine IL-10 was elevated in\nFigure 2. Meta-analysis of survival rates.\nPulmonary injury\nFive studies reported the impact of RAGE\ninhibition on pulmonary injury during\nsepsis. For G\u00fe bacterial infection, both van\nZoelen et al.11 and Achouiti et al. found\nreduced pulmonary injury in the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0\ngroup compared with the WT group.16 For\nG\u00c0 bacterial infection, although Ramsgaard\net al. showed that the RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 group had\nreduced pulmonary injury, both van Zoelen\net al.12 and Achouiti et al. found no signifi-\ncant differences between the comparison\nDiscussion\nRAGE functions as a sensor of danger\nsignals, triggering a certain degree of inflam-\nmatory reactions. This process can act as a\ndouble-edged sword during sepsis, on the\none hand protecting the host against invad-\ning pathogens; however, destroying cells and\ntissues.20 In this comprehensive systematic\nreview and meta-analysis, we analyzed and\ndescribed the effects of RAGE inhibition on\nthe sepsis survival rate in animal models.\nThe overall meta-analysis showed that\nRAGE inhibition was associated with a\nsignificantly higher survival rate than the\nP \u00bc 0.001). However, this therapeutic effect\nvaried greatly during subgroup analysis of\nthe type of infection. The effect was most\npronounced in polymicrobial infection (HR\nOne possible explanation for the intriguing\nobservation that RAGE inhibition during\ndifferent types of infections had differential\neffects on survival is that RAGE-mediated\nbacterial clearance might be pathogen\ndependent. To test this hypothesis, systemat-\nically reviewed the impact of RAGE\ninhibition on bacterial outgrowth and\ndissemination. As expected, RAGE inhibition\nreduced bacterial outgrowth and dissemin-\nation to distant organs during G\u00fe bacterial\ninfection, and to a lesser extent during G\u00c0\nbacterial infection. Previous in vitro studies\nsupport these findings. Peritoneal macro-\nphages harvested from RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 mice have\nan increased capacity to kill S. pneumoniae\n(a G\u00fe bacterium), whereas RAGE\u00c0/\u00c0 neu-\ntrophils have a reduced ability to phagocyt-\nose K. pneumoniae (a G\u00c0 bacterium).11,18\nTaken together, these data suggest that the\nimpact of RAGE inhibition on survival rate\nand bacterial clearance is likely to be at least\nin part determined by the specific micro-\norganism involved.\nFor polymicrobial infection, the detected\nsurvival benefit was not associated with\nreduced bacterial outgrowth and dissemin-\nation.12 This may be partly explained by\nprevious findings showing that the host\ndefense against CLP depends on the extent\nof intestinal necrosis and formation of a\nlocal abscess.21 Consequently, the impact of\nRAGE inhibition on bacterial clearance\nmight not be easily determined using this\nsepsis model.\nMortality from sepsis is thought to be a\nconsequence of excessive inflammatory cell\ninflux into the infection site, combined with\nan over-production of pro-inflammatory and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. All\nthese inflammatory alterations contribute to\ntissue damage, multiple organ dysfunction\nsyndrome (MODS), and secondary oppor-\ntunistic infections.22 Thus, we also conducted\na systematic review of inflammatory cell\ninflux, plasma cytokine levels and pulmonary\ninjury between the RAGE inhibition and\ncontrol groups. We found that RAGE inhib-\nition was associated with reduced inflamma-\ntory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels and\npulmonary injury during G\u00fe bacterial infec-\ntion, and these parameters correlated with\nenhanced survival.\nIt is still unclear whether RAGE interact\nwith ligands from pathogens and whether\n18 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\nthe RAGE-induced effects in first-line\ndefense mechanisms are pathogen depend-\nent. If so, then these mechanisms might\nexplain the opposite effects of RAGE inhib-\nition on survival, bacterial clearance and\ninflammatory reactions observed with dif-\nferent methods of sepsis induction.\nHowever, such mechanisms remain specula-\ntive and require further investigation to\nconfirm their existence.23\nLutterloh et al. found that an anti-RAGE\nantibody protected mice from mortality in\nCLP induction of sepsis, and the survival\nbenefit was comparable to that of a RAGE\ngene knockout. Furthermore, the anti-\nRAGE antibody enhanced survival even\nwhen administration started up to 24 h\nafter CLP.10 Studies investigating the effects\nof sRAGE, which acts as a decoy receptor,\nin murine CLP-induced sepsis found that\nsRAGE administration improved the 7-day\nsurvival rate compared with controls.9,24 We\ndid not include studies involving sRAGE in\nour analysis due to its interaction with\nreceptors other than RAGE itself.\nHowever, these studies combined suggest\nthat anti-RAGE antibodies and sRAGE\nmight be attractive therapeutic agents for\ntreating sepsis in clinical settings.\nSome limitations of our systematic review\nand meta-analysis are worth noting. First,\nthere is more bias in systematic reviews of\nanimal models than in clinical trials.\nAccording to the CAMARADES checklist,\nthe overall quality of the studies included in\nthis analysis was not particularly good.\nSecond, the number of studies that met our\ninclusion criteria was small, and the limited\ndata available was insufficient for certain\ncomparisons, such as subgroup analysis.\nThird, the literature was unclear as to\nwhich experimental approach was most\nappropriate for evaluating the effects of\nRAGE inhibition on sepsis in animal\nmodels. Various methods were used for\ninducing sepsis in these studies, and includ-\ning all types of experimental sepsis together\nin this analysis could overestimate or under-\nestimate the role of RAGE inhibition.\nFourth, we also found various RAGE\ninhibition methods, including RAGE gene\nknockout, or administration of anti-RAGE\nantibody or sRAGE. Because of its inter-\nactions with multiple receptors, sRAGE-\nrelated studies were excluded. However, this\ninevitably excluded some valuable informa-\ntion. Fifth, the different methods of collect-\ning samples, time points, and outcome\nmeasurement criteria in the included studies\nwould have contributed substantially to the\nhigh heterogeneity. Sixth, the authors did not\nreport any information about the stage of\nsepsis and whether septic shock was present\nin the animals studied. The state of sepsis\ncould be an important consideration when\nevaluating the therapeutic value of RAGE\ninhibition. Seventh, many of the studies were\ncarried out by groups that were led by the\nsame senior investigator, which might limit\nthe generalizability of the results.\nConclusions\nBased on the results of our analysis, RAGE\ninhibition enhances survival in animal\nmodels and may protect against sepsis.\nTherefore, RAGE may be a promising\ntherapeutic target for treating sepsis clinic-\nally. However, the observation that RAGE\ninhibition is beneficial in sepsis that is\ninduced by one method and ineffective in\nanother suggests that RAGE-mediated\npathogen defenses may rely on distinct\nmechanisms. Further investigations are\nneeded to define the role of RAGE inhib-\nition in different infectious conditions.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nEthical approval\nThe authors did not directly carry out any\nresearch involving human participants or animals\nin this study.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by National Natural\nScientific Foundation of China (Grant number:\nReferences\n1.
