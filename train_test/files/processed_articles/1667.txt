Adults aged 65 and older are dis-\nproportionately affected by these factors, and although they\nmake up only 12% of the total United States (U.S.) popula-\ntion, they incur 62% of national health care expenses for heart\nconditions (2,3). CVD risk reduction strategies among older\nadults can lead to a decline in premature CVD morbidity and\nmortality (4\u00ad7).

Knowledge\nof the current magnitude of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and\ndiabetes in this population is important for health care resource\nallocation, disease management, and education (13,14).\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a nationally representative survey of nonin-\nstitutionalized adults providing data on a wide variety of\nhealth conditions through in-person interviews at home, fol-\nlowed by clinical examinations and laboratory tests in a mo-\nbile examination center (15).\nThis study presents national-level data from the NHANES\nlogic treatment, and control of hypertension, dyslipidemia,\nand diabetes among adults 65 years of age and older.

Adults aged 65 and older are disproportionately affected by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes,\nwhich are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although risk reduction strategies among older adults,\nincluding control of CVD risk factors, can lead to a decline in premature CVD morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of\nthese risk factors has generally increased in the past decade among elders and risk factor control rates have been suboptimal.\nWe assess prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control rates among U.S. adults aged 65 and older with respect to hyperten-\nsion, dyslipidemia, and diabetes and describe predictors associated with awareness and management of these factors.\nMethods. Analysis of nationally representative data collected from adults aged 65 and older (n = 3,810) participating\nResults. Women have a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension than men (76.6% vs 63.0%) and a significantly\nlower rate of control when treated pharmacologically (42.9% vs 57.9%). Dyslipidemia prevalence is 60.3% overall, and\nwomen are significantly more likely to be aware of their condition than men (71.1% vs 59.1%). Diabetes affects 21.2%\nof older adults, and 50.9% of prevalent cases are treated pharmacologically. Goal attainment among those treated is\nproblematic for all three conditions--hypertension (48.8%), dyslipidemia (64.9%), and diabetes (50.4%). Having two or\nmore doctor visits annually is associated with goal attainment for dyslipidemia.\nConclusions. Knowledge of cardiovascular health in older adults and understanding gender gaps in awareness can\nhelp physicians and policymakers improve disease management and patient education programs.\nKey Words: Hypertension--High cholestrol--Diabetes--Prevalance--Older adults.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nWe analyzed the sample of older adults (65 years of age\na continuing statistical survey of the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian U.S. population, sponsored by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. All study participants have blood pres-\nsure measurements taken, whereas those in the NHANES\nmorning subset (n = 1,556) also have measurements taken\nof fasting plasma glucose and lipids.\nStudy Definitions\nIn accordance withAmerican DiabetesAssociation criteria\nfor epidemiological studies (20), study participants were con-\nsidered to have diabetes if they met one or more of the fol-\nlowing conditions: their fasting plasma glucose level was\n126 mg/dL, or they reported being told by a physician that\nthey had diabetes, or they were taking glucose-lowering med-\nications.Apersonwasconsidered\"aware\"ifhe/sheresponded\npositively to the question, \"Have you ever been told by a doc-\ntor that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?\" Study partici-\npants who reported taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic\nagents were classified as \"treated.\" A treated person was\nconsidered \"controlled\" if HbA1c was less than 7%.\nHypertension was defined in accordance with the Sev-\nenth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,\nDetection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-\nsure (JNC 7) (7). A person was deemed to have hyperten-\nsion if the NHANES examination indicated that, based on\nthe average of three measurements, the systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP) was 140 mm Hg, or the diastolic blood pres-\nsure (DBP) was 90 mm Hg, or if he/she reported current\nuse of antihypertensive medication. Consequently, a person\nwho may have been informed that he/she had hypertension,\nbut who was not on medication and who tested normoten-\nsive on the day of the examination was not classified as a\nprevalent case of hypertension. A person with hypertension\naccording to the JNC 7 definition was considered \"aware\" if\nhe/she gave a positive response to the question, \"Have you\never been told by a doctor or other health professional that\nyou had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?\" A\nperson with hypertension was classified as \"treated\" if he/\nshe reported taking antihypertensive medication at the time\nof the survey. A treated person was considered \"controlled\"\nif his/her average SBP was <140 mm Hg and average DBP\nStudy participants were classified as having dyslipidemia\nif their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol exceeded\nthe appropriate risk-based threshold established by the Na-\ntional Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) Adult Treat-\nment Panel III (ATP III) (4) or if they reported taking an\nantihyperlipidemic drug at the time of the examination.\nSimilar to hypertension, this definition excludes persons\nwho report having previously been told that they had high\ncholesterol but who test negative in NHANES and are not\non medication. A person with dyslipidemia according to the\nATP III definition was considered \"aware\" if he/she gave a\npositive response to the question, \"Have you ever been told\nby a doctor or other health professional that your blood cho-\nlesterol level was high?\" Those who reported taking pre-\nscribed medicine to lower their blood cholesterol were\nconsidered \"treated.\" A treated person was classified as\n\"controlled\" if his/her LDL was lower than the appropriate\nData Analysis\ndata to derive population estimates of the prevalence of dia-\nbetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as aware-\nness, treatment, and control rates of these conditions\namong persons aged 65 or older.

The awareness rate for diabetes (71.4%) is driven\nby a significantly higher awareness among women than\ntes cases are treated pharmacologically, and only half of all\ntreated cases reach HbA1c goal attainment of <7%.\nPredictors of Awareness, Treatment, and Control\nTables 3, 4, and 5 present the results of estimating sepa-\nrate logistic regression models for the rates of awareness,\npharmacologictreatment,andcontrolofthethreeconditions,\nadjusting for the effects of age, sex, education, number of\ndoctor visits, living arrangement, having a usual health care\nprovider and annual household income.\nFor elders with hypertension, higher age is associated\nwith lower rates of awareness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71 [age\nthose with dyslipidemia, the oldest (age 85) have signifi-\ncantly lower rates of awareness and treatment (OR = 0.29\nsignificant differences between the sexes in awareness or\ntreatment for hypertension, women on treatment are only\nhalf as likely as men to have their blood pressure controlled\n(OR = 0.51).

The number of doctor\nvisits in the past year is positively and strongly associated\nwith awareness and treatment of all three conditions.

Our results are consistent with previous studies of\nprevalence of these three cardiovascular risk factors in older\ning awareness, treatment, and control rates; and identify\ngender disparities among the rates.\nWe found that older women are more likely than older\nmen to have hypertension, equally likely to be aware and\ntreated, but less likely to have their blood pressure con-\ntrolled on pharmacotherapy. Older women have a higher\nprevalence than men of isolated systolic hypertension. Ap-\nproximately half of all older adults treated for hypertension\nachieve blood pressure control. This finding is consistent\nwith recent studies showing a positive trend of increasing\nblood pressure control among older adults (age 60) in the\nNHANES study population (18,21). The improvement in\ncontrol may be due, in part, to physician education and\nchanging practice patterns based on the JNC 7 guidelines\n(7). Notwithstanding this success, in the present study,\nwomen are only half as likely as men (after adjusting for\ncovariates) to attain blood pressure goal. A similar finding\nfor women (age 20) was reported in a previous NHANES\nadjusting for race (22), suggesting that additional blood\npressure control programs specifically targeted toward\nwomen are warranted. The paradigm shift of the JNC em-\nphasizing the importance of diagnosing and treating systolic\nhypertension among older adults (23,24) further merits the\nneed for such gender-specific programs.\nWe found the prevalence of dyslipidemia to be similar by\ngender, with women more likely to be aware and treated.\nAlthough overall treatment is only 43%, there has been a\nsuggestive upward trend of pharmacological treatment for\nTable 5.

This trend may be at-\ntributed to some degree, to increasing adoption of the NCEP\nguidelines (4). Control rates for dyslipidemia in this study\nare similar by gender and by age groups.\nOur study found that women with diabetes are more\nlikely than men to be aware of their condition and that only\n50% of patients on pharmacotherapy are controlled\n(HbA1c <7%). Other studies in various clinical settings\nhave documented poor diabetes control among the elderly\nadults (25,26). This study provides newer evidence that\nconfirms the need for improved quality of care.\nIn our study, treatment and goal attainment rates for all\nthree conditions are suboptimal. Continued physician ef-\nforts to improve treatment rates and successfully treat pa-\ntients to goal are needed. Although our study shows that\nincreasing numbers of doctor visits are associated with\nawareness and treatment for all three conditions, and with\ngoal attainment for dyslipidemia, the interpretation of this\nfinding is ambiguous. It may be that more frequent visits\nprovide added opportunity for physicians to detect and treat\nundiagnosed disease, or the causality may be reversed, and\nthose who already are aware and/or treated make more vis-\nits for the purpose of refilling prescriptions or monitoring\ntreatment effectiveness. The reasons for the visits cannot be\ndetermined using the NHANES data.\nAn important national public health effort to reduce CVD\nrisk factor burden through the Healthy People 2010 has had\nongoing successes (16,27), and knowledge of our study's\nfindings on gender differences in awareness and control\nmay be useful to clinicians in the effort to improve out-\ncomes.\nThe strengths of this study include its population-based\nsampling frame and the availability of clinical measurements\nto determine undiagnosed and diagnosed disease prevalence\nand to determine goal attainment.Additionally, using 6 years\nof NHANES data provides a large sample and precise esti-\nmates of conditions affecting older adults. To our knowl-\nreport on the prevalence and management of CVD risk fac-\ntors among adults 65 years and older. Such information may\nbe helpful to health care decision makers. A limitation in our\nstudy is that physician-specific variables, such as practitioner\nage, group practice size and setting (eg, university medical\ncenter), and practice patterns are not available in NHANES.\nIt is also likely that we overestimated blood pressure control\nrates. We used a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg for\nadults with hypertension with and without diabetes, a method\nthat has been applied in other studies (8,9). The current blood\npressure goal for adults with hypertension and with diabetes\nwith hypertension and with diabetes would result in a lower\nestimate of blood pressure control (7,9).\nOur study provides insight into a number of controllable\nrisk factors affecting the U.S. population of adults 65 years\nand older. This population has a high prevalence of hyper-\ntension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Women with hyperten-\nsion are disproportionately affected by higher prevalence\nand lower control rates than men. Women with dyslipidemia\nor diabetes are more likely than men to be aware of their\ncondition. Understanding gaps in awareness can lead to im-\nproved treatment rates. For all three conditions, improve-\nments in treatment and control rates are needed. In light of\nthe expected growth in this population, patient education\nand targeted efforts to improve disease management are\nclearly indicated.\n"
