Homicide mortality risks are between 20% and 50% higher for residents of areas that have\neconomic inequality of 0.50 or greater based on the coefficient of variation, or where 4% or more of the\nresidents are Mexican American, 10% or more of the residents are non-Hispanic black, or 20% or more of\nthe households are headed by single parents (p(.05). But residents of areas where 10% or more of their\nneighbours are foreign born have 35% lower mortality risks than people living in areas with fewer foreign\nborn people (p(0.05). These differences persist even after controlling for individual level risk factors.\nConclusions: The findings support economic deprivation, social disorganisation, and acculturation\ntheories, and suggest that both neighbourhood and individual risk factors affect race/ethnic differences in\nhomicide mortality. Public health policies must focus on both individual and neighbourhood factors to\nreduce homicide risks in vulnerable populations.\nHomicide was the 15th leading cause of death and the\n4th leading preventable cause of death in the US in\n2000, and Hispanic and non-Hispanic black men aged\n18 to 50 comprised a disproportionate share of those\ndeaths.1 2 Although much research focuses on black/white\ndifferences in homicide mortality,3\u00ad8 little work examines\nhomicide mortality among Hispanics or Hispanic subgroups.9\u00ad13\nMexicanAmericansarethelargestHispanicsubpopulationand\nthemostnumerousforeignbornpopulationintheUS.13 14 Over\n10% of the US population is foreign born, of which nearly one\nthird hails from Mexico.15 Thus, we examine whether\nneighbourhood characteristics affect Mexican American,\nnon-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white differences in\nhomicide mortality, net of individual factors.\nThree theoretical perspectives suggest that neighbourhood\nfactors might be associated with homicide mortality. Firstly,\neconomic deprivation theories posit that concentrated pov-\nerty and economic inequality may provide people with scant\nresources to achieve culturally valued goals including high\nlevels of education; safe, secure, and comfortable housing;\nand well lit, maintained, and patrolled neighbourhoods.5 6\nResidence in areas marked by economic deprivation may\nhinder the ability of people to obtain loans, gain access to\nhigh quality jobs, and receive high quality education.16\u00ad18\nCommunities that lack sufficient economic resources to\nimprove material and social conditions for their residents\nmay confer higher risks of homicide mortality.7\nSecondly, social disorganisation theories posit that con-\ncentrations of single parent households or racial and ethnic\nsegregation may be associated with lower levels of social\ncontrol. Social control allows communities to mitigate violent\ncrime by regulating activities within their neighbourhoods\nthrough participation in formal and informal organisations.19\nSingle parent households may have fewer resources to invest\nin community participation or volunteer organisations, and\nprovide fewer adults who can monitor neighbourhood\nactivities, intervene in local disturbances, question strangers,\nand potentially thwart criminal activities.20 21 High levels of\nrace/ethnic segregation partially derive from past discrimina-\ntion by the real estate industry, federal housing policy,\nbanking institutions, and neighbourhood organisations that\nrestricted minorities to undesirable residential areas.17 22\u00ad25\nHighly segregated areas often have poorer schools, higher\ntaxes, more dilapidated buildings, less political power, and\nare targeted by alcohol advertisers and display higher rates of\ndrinking than their levels of poverty would suggest--factors\nAreas marked by racial and ethnic segregation and high\nconcentrations of single parent families may provide few\nresources for achieving social control and political power,\nassets that could reduce homicide.\nThirdly, acculturation theories suggest that neighbour-\nhoods with high concentrations of foreign born people may\nprotect against homicide mortality. Mexican culture pro-\nmotes norms and values that regulate activities and promote\nhealth, by limiting excessive alcohol and illegal drug use--\nbehaviours that are often associated with homicide.31\u00ad34\nStrong social relationships within foreign born communities\nmay emerge from shared experiences and language to help\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: NHIS, National Health Interview Survey; NDI, National\nDeath Index; VSA, very small area\nwww.jech.com\nfacilitate positive economic mobilisation and discourage risky\nand illegal enterprises. Furthermore, although acculturation\nmay result in higher levels of income and education and\naccess to better jobs, as immigrants integrate into US society\nthey adopt the less healthy norms and values of native non-\nHispanic white Americans.31 32 Acculturation may also lend\ninsight into the epidemiological paradox: Mexican Americans\noften exhibit low mortality levels that parallel those of non-\nHispanic white Americans, although their low levels of\nincome and education would predict higher mortality, as\nfound among non-Hispanic black Americans.35 36 This para-\ndox has resulted in speculation that neighbourhood factors,\nsuch as foreign born communities, may buffer Mexican\nAmericans against mortality risks associated with low socio-\nWe investigate three limitations of prior research that\nexamines race/ethnic differences in homicide.

Secondly, most nationally representative\nstudies of homicide mortality combine multiple Hispanic\nsubpopulations, include Hispanics with non-Hispanic black\nBecause some work suggests important variation in violent\ndeath among different Hispanic groups,9 we examine\nMexican American and non-Hispanic black and white\ndisparities in homicide mortality. Finally, some research\nfinds that areas with high concentrations of immigrants\nconfer lower risks of overall mortality40; but no work\nexamines whether that protective effect extends to homicide\nmortality. Thus, we examine the effect of the percentage of\nforeign born people living in an area on homicide mortality.\nMETHODS\nWe use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the\nannual cross sectional sample of the non-institutionalised\ncivilian population, with a very high response rate: well over\n95% of contacted people complete interviews. The NDI is a\nnational database of deaths for adults aged 18 and older. The\nlinked NHIS-NDI data are prospective and better allow causal\ninference than cross sectional data. We limit our sample to\nadults aged 18 to 50 because homicide mortality is very\nconcentrated at those ages.\nIndividual and neighbourhood variables\nThe individual level variables in our analyses include self\nreported race/ethnicity, sex, a race/ethnicity by sex interac-\ntion, age in single years, nativity, marital status, employment\nstatus, income to needs ratio, and education. Race/ethnicity\nincludes non-Hispanic white Americans, non-Hispanic black\nAmericans, and Mexican Americans; we exclude other\ngroups because of small numbers of deaths. The interaction\nbetween race/ethnicity and sex accounts for the high\nhomicide mortality risks among Mexican American and\nnon-Hispanic black men.3 4 The foreign born variable includes\na dummy variable for missing data because NHIS only asked\nthis question in 1989 and later. We calculate the income to\nneeds ratio by estimating an income value for the open ended\nincome category in the NHIS; imputing missing income\nvalues with demographic factors; standardising income to\n1995 values; and dividing the midpoint of each income\ncategory by family size. We detail the method used to impute\nincome elsewhere.45 Separate analyses (not shown) find that\nthose with imputed income values have identical mortality\nrisks as those without missing data. We exclude less than\n0.8% of the cases because of missing data for key variables.\nWells and Horm of the National Center for Health Statistics\ndeveloped the methodology we use to create the ``neighbour-\nhood'' variables, using the design features of the NHIS.46 The\non census blocks and block groups. But Wells and Horm use\nthe term ``very small areas'' (VSAs) to denote these\ngeographical areas, because the NHIS occasionally interviews\npeople from adjoining blocks or block groups.46 47\nNevertheless, VSAs are marked by stable political or\ngeographical boundaries, including major roads, rivers, or\ncounty lines, and are smaller and more homogenous than\ncensus tracts or health service areas.47 48 Furthermore, the\nNHIS interviews people in all 50 states and the District of\nColumbia, and is designed to be geographically representa-\nThe VSAs have unique identifiers that do not vary during\nthe study period, allowing us to match the areas across\nmultiple years of survey data. We estimate the VSA\ncharacteristics from the aggregated individual level charac-\nteristics of those persons living in a given geographical area,\nby collapsing weighted individual data within each VSA.46 We\ncreate all of the VSA level variables, except for the percentage\nof immigrants living in an area (for reasons noted below), by\ncombining the VSA characteristics for the year of interview as\nwell as the two earlier and later years, where available.43 46 47\nFor example, we estimate the VSA data for people in 1992 by\nthrough 1988 data. This approach allows most VSA char-\nacteristics to change over time, an advantage that census data\ndo not provide; ensures that the estimated VSA values come\nfrom adequate numbers of people; and links the contextual\ndata to the respondents' area of residence for the years\nsurrounding the time of interview.46 Wells and Horm\nproduced stable estimates of the ecological variables with\nonly three years of data and suggest that combining data\nacross multiple waves of NHIS data provides a sampling\nfraction of over 60% of the population of the block or block\ngroup over time.46 Our VSA data come from an average of 141\nand a range of 1 to 418 people. Separate analyses (not\nshown) excluded the less than 0.8% of people from VSAs that\ncontained fewer than 20 respondents, to test for bias because\nof poorly estimated neighbourhood data, and found results\nidentical to those presented here.\nThe VSA level variables include the level of economic\ninequality based on the coefficient of variation; the percen-\ntage of people living in poverty; segregation measured as the\npercentage of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic black\nAmericans4 41; the percentage of single parent households;\nand the percentage of foreign born people, as shown in\ntable 1. The coefficient of variation is calculated as the\nstandard deviation of household income within the VSA\nKey points\nN Both neighbourhood and individual risk factors shape\nMexican American, non-Hispanic white, and non-\nHispanic black homicide mortality.\nN Neighbourhood level risk factors for homicide mortality\ninclude economic deprivation and social disorganisa-\ntion, although areas with high concentrations of\nforeign born people protect against homicide mortal-\nity.\n224 Krueger, Huie, Rogers, et al\nwww.jech.com\ndivided by the mean household income (mean = $38 695;\nmeasure provides estimates that are similar to other inequal-\nity measures, including the Gini coefficient (results not\nshown). Because of missing data prior to 1989, we estimate\nthe percentage foreign born in a VSA using data from 1989\nand later, rather than allowing the level to vary across the\nyear of interview as with the other VSA variables. Separate\nanalyses (results not shown) included the median age in the\nVSA, but we dropped it from our final models because it was\nneither significant nor theoretically important. We code the\nVSA variables dichotomously to ensure adequate numbers of\ndeaths in each category, minimise their skewed distributions,\nand limit multicollinearity. Correlations among the neigh-\nbourhood variables were 0.47 or below, lower than those\nreported in other studies.11 42 We tested various logical cut off\npoints for the variables to ensure than each category contains\nadequate numbers of people and that those within each\ncategory face statistically similar homicide mortality risks.\nThe dependent variable for this analysis is risk of death\nfrom homicide. We code homicide according to the E-codes\nin the Ninth Revision of International Classification of\nand may more accurately assess homicide mortality than the\nUniform Crime Reports, another major database that records\nUS homicide deaths.50 We drop 2.8% of the NHIS respondents\nthat are termed ``ineligible'' because they lack key informa-\ntion that could link them to future death records; otherwise\nthey would appear immortal. Among eligible people, women\nand Hispanics are less likely to be matched to future\nmortality than men and non-Hispanics, because of name\nchanges from marriage, or misspelling of Hispanic names and\nlower reporting of social security numbers, respectively.44\nThese differences in the likelihood of being matched to\nprospective homicide mortality may slightly inflate sex\ndifferentials and deflate race/ethnic differentials.\nStatistical analyses\nTo estimate hazards of death attributable to homicide over\nthe follow up period, we create a duration variable that\nmeasures the time between the month of interview and the\nmonth of death. Those surviving the entire follow up\nduration are right censored, and those who die from causes\nother than homicide are censored at the time of death. We\nestimate the risk of death for up to 144 follow up months\nusing Cox proportional hazards models and report all\ncoefficients as hazards ratios. Tests indicate that our models\nmeet the proportionality assumption.

The G statistic tests for\nimprovements in fit between models, calculated as 22((log\nlikelihood of model 1)2(log likelihood of model 2)), where\nthe distribution is x2 and the degrees of freedom equal the\nnumber of variables included between models.53 To interpret\nthe interaction terms, we calculate hazard ratios for each\nrace/ ethnic group, by sex. For example, the hazard ratio (HR)\nfor non-Hispanic black men relative to white men, is: HRblack\nmale\n= (HRblack\n)6(HRblack*male\n). We also calculate the percent\ndecrease (PD) in hazard ratios between models as:\nPD = (HRModel 1\n)/(HRModel 1\nRESULTS\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics for the covariates by race/\nethnicity. At the individual level, Mexican Americans and\nnon-Hispanic black Americans are younger, less often married,\nand less economically advantaged than non-Hispanic white\nAmericans. For example, only 35% of non-Hispanic black\nAmericans and 21% of Mexican Americans have any college\neducation, compared with nearly 50% of non-Hispanic\nwhite Americans. The VSA variables also show race/ethnic\ndifferences. Compared with non-Hispanic white Americans,\nnon-Hispanic black Americans and Mexican Americans\nmore often live in areas where economic inequality is\ngreater than or equal to 0.50 based on the coefficient of\nvariation, 15% or more of their neighbours live in poverty,\nand 20% or more of the households are headed by single\nparents. Moreover, compared with non-Hispanic white and\nblack Americans, Mexican Americans more often live in\nareas where 4% or more of the residents are Mexican\nAmerican and 10% or more of the residents are foreign\nborn. Finally, 92% of non-Hispanic black Americans live in\nareas where 10% or more of their neighbours are non-\nHispanic black, although only 18% of Mexican Americans\nand 12% of white Americans live in similar areas.\nWe also present crude cohort specific homicide mortality\nrates by race/ethnicity, calculated as the number of homicide\ndeaths over the follow up period per 1000 people interviewed.\nThese death rates are not fully comparable to national data\nbecause we exclude Hispanics from the black and white\nsubpopulations; focus on Mexican Americans rather than all\nHispanics; and calculate cohort rather than period specific\nhomicide mortality rates. None the less, our rates mirror\nnational trends: non-Hispanic black Americans and Mexican\nAmericans exhibit much higher homicide mortality rates\nthan non-Hispanic white Americans.1 2 Although these rates\nallude to important race/ethnic disparities in homicide\nmortality, we now turn to the multivariate results to control\nfor age and other risk factors.\nTable 2 presents hazard ratios for the risks of homicide\nmortality. Model 1 shows that, at baseline, non-Hispanic\nblack Americans, Mexican Americans, and men have higher\nrisks of homicide mortality over the follow up period than\nnon-Hispanic white Americans and women, respectively.\nBecause the interaction between Mexican American and\nmale is significant, we include the interactions in all models\n(table 3 provides a detailed interpretation of the interaction\nterms). Model 2 finds that individual risk factors affect\nhomicide mortality. Those who are previously or never\nmarried, unemployed or not in the labour force, less affluent,\nor who have less education experience higher risks of\nhomicide mortality over the follow up period than their\ncurrently married, employed, more affluent, or more edu-\ncated counterparts. Furthermore, model 2 fits significantly\ndoes not control for neighbourhood risk factors.\nModel 3 finds that neighbourhood factors are also\nassociated with homicide mortality.

At the\ncommunity level, policies could promote neighbour-\nhood watch programmes, improvements in local\nschools, and less risky behaviours by more closely\nregulating alcohol use among minors and drug use\namong young adults.\nN Public health initiatives that focus solely on individual\nbehaviours may be poorly equipped to lower homicide\nmortality rates, unless they also target the fundamental\nsocioeconomic and race/ethnic inequities that foster\nviolence.\nNeighbourhoods and homicide risks 227\nwww.jech.com\nthose living in areas where 15% or more of their neighbours\nlive in poverty have 21% higher homicide mortality risks over\nthe follow up period. Furthermore, relative to those in\nneighbourhoods with little segregation and few single parent\nhouseholds, those living in areas where 4% or more of the\nresidents are Mexican American have 37% higher, those\nliving in areas where 10% or more of the residents are non-\nHispanic black have 49% higher, and those living in areas\nwhere 20% or more of the households are headed by single\nparents have 36% higher homicide mortality risks, over the\nfollow up period. Finally, immigrant neighbourhoods are\nprotective: compared with those living in areas with fewer\nforeign born residents, residents of areas where 10% or more\nof their neighbours are foreign born experience 33% lower\nrisks of homicide mortality over the follow up period.\nAlthough model 3 fits significantly better than model 1\nrisk factors.\nModel 4 includes both individual and contextual factors\nand finds that both are associated with race/ethnic differ-\nences in homicide mortality.

But the variable\nfor neighbourhood poverty drops from significance after\ncontrolling for individual factors. Nevertheless, model 4 fits\nTable 3 calculates hazard ratios for race/ethnic differences,\nby sex, based on the estimates from table 2. Each model in\ntable 3 controls for, but does not show, the variables from the\nrespective model in table 2. Model 1 finds that compared\nwith non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic black men have\n8.3 times and Mexican American men have 8.8 times the\nhomicide mortality risk over the follow up period.\nFurthermore, compared with non-Hispanic white women,\nnon-Hispanic black women have 5.6 times and Mexican\nAmerican women have 3.1 times the homicide mortality risk\nover the follow up period. Compared with model 1, models 2\nand 3 show somewhat smaller race/ethnic disparities in\nhomicide mortality risks, suggesting that those disparities\nresult, in part, from differences in individual and neighbour-\nhood level factors.\nModel 4 shows that individual and VSA level character-\nistics, in combination, partially account for race/ethnic\ndifferences in homicide mortality. Compared with non-\nHispanic white men, non-Hispanic black men have 3.7 times\nand Mexican American men have 5.0 times the homicide\nmortality risk over the follow up period. Indeed, among men,\nneighbourhood and individual factors account for a 63%\ndecrease in non-Hispanic black and a 48% decrease in\nMexican American homicide mortality risks, compared with\nmodel 1. Concomitantly, compared with non-Hispanic white\nwomen, non-Hispanic black women have 2.3 times and\nMexican American women have 1.7 times the homicide\nmortality risk--an approximately 70% decrease for both non-\nHispanic black Americans and Mexican Americans, com-\npared with model 1.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings contribute to the literature on race/ethnic\ndifferences in homicide mortality in four ways. Firstly, we\nfind support for economic disadvantage theory.\nNeighbourhood income inequality predicts increased risks\nof homicide mortality, net of neighbourhood poverty and\nindividual factors. Others also find that neighbourhood\ninequality associates with homicide mortality,5\u00ad7 probably\nbecause inequitable areas limit residents' abilities to meet\nvalued goals including finding safe, comfortable, and afford-\nable housing; maintaining and patrolling neighbourhoods; or\nreducing levels of illicit drug or excessive alcohol use.6 7 16\u00ad19\nBut previous work finds that areas where 10% or more of the\nresidents live in poverty confer increased homicide mortality\nthose studies examine larger geographical areas, do not\ncontrol for same neighbourhood risk factors that we use here,\nand seldom control for individual factors.\nSecondly, our findings also support social disorganisation\ntheory. Residents in segregated areas experience higher\nhomicide mortality, presumably because those areas are\nassociated with discrimination, inadequate schools, numer-\nous alcohol outlets and abandoned buildings, and ultimately,\nmany obstacles to economic, social, and political advance-\nwhere 10% or more of the residents are black confer higher\nrisks of overall and homicide specific mortality, although\nunlike prior work, we find increased homicide mortality risks\nin areas where 4% or more of the residents are Mexican\nAmerican, possibly because those studies combine all\nHispanics.4 11 Furthermore, areas where 20% or more of the\nhouseholds are headed by single parents also confer\nincreased homicide mortality risks, probably because they\nprovide limited numbers of people who can participate in\nformal and informal organisations.19\u00ad21 Socially disorganised\nareas provide a dangerous mix: large numbers of potential\noffenders who have few opportunities other than crime,\nmany potential victims, and few social organisations or indi-\nviduals who are capable of protecting others from violence.53\nThirdly, areas with high concentrations of immigrants\nprotect against homicide mortality. Previous work finds that\nareas where 10% or more of the residents are foreign born\nprotect residents against overall mortality40; we find that this\nprotection extends to homicide mortality. Immigrant com-\nmunities foster norms and values that discourage risky\nactivities including drug and alcohol misuse.31\u00ad34\nNeighbourhood factors might also partially explain the\nepidemiological paradox.35\u00ad39 Mexican Americans often live\nin areas where 10% or more of the residents are foreign born\n(table 1), which predicts lower risks of homicide mortality\nnet of individual economic resources.\nFinally, both individual and neighbourhood risk factors\npartially account for race/ethnic differences in homicide\nmortality. Models that include either individual or ecological\nvariables alone less capably predict homicide mortality than\nmodels that include both sets of risk factors simultaneously.\nWe build on findings from the single study that used data\nfrom multiple levels to predict homicide mortality,11 by using\na longer follow up period and specifically examining Mexican\nAmericans and immigrant neighbourhoods.\nStrengths and limitations\nWe contribute to the literature by using VSAs to capture\nneighbourhood characteristics. Although the NHIS contains\nconfidential links to census data, estimated VSA data have\nseveral advantages. Firstly, VSAs are an important resource\nthat allow researchers to examine both individual and\necological risk factors with nationally representative and\npublicly accessible data, without the expenses associated\nwith accessing the confidentially linked census data.46\nSecondly, VSAs provide data on smaller, more homogenous\nareas than census tracts, which customarily have been linked\nto the NHIS data.11 41 42 Finally, VSA data allow us to capture\nchanges in area characteristics over time more accurately\n228 Krueger, Huie, Rogers, et al\nwww.jech.com\nthan census data.46 But VSAs are not perfect: although the\nNHIS systematically samples households in VSAs to max-\nimise the variation within an area,47 and we estimate VSA\ndata from a large percentage of residents,46 biases may arise if\nthe sampled residents inaccurately represent an area. Future\nwork could test whether our findings persist in alternate data\nsources.\nWe use VSA variables that are averaged across multiple\nyears, and then link both individual and VSA factors to\nprospective mortality. But both individual and area char-\nacteristics may have changed between the point of interview\nand the time of death. Although neighbourhood character-\nistics are comparatively stable over time, both in our data and\nin other sources,54 and other studies use a prospective design\nthat is similar to ours,11 40\u00ad42 future work with panel data\ncould examine how changes in residence or individual risk\nfactors affect homicide mortality risks over time.\nFurthermore, we have data on the area of residence, rather\nthan the location of death. Although most homicide deaths\noccur close to home,25 future work could explore whether\nmultiple locations, including the places of work, residence,\nrecreation, and death affect homicide mortality.\nKaufman and colleagues note the importance of residual\nconfounding when examining race/ethnic differences in\nmortality.55 56 They suggest that social and economic indica-\ntors may have different meanings for minorities, who may\nhave suffered from discrimination in housing markets, job\nopportunities, or educational access, relative to white people.\nWe partially account for their concerns by controlling for the\nlower levels of personal income and education among\nminorities, relative to white people, living in areas marked\nby similar levels of inequality, segregation, single parent\nhouseholds, and foreign born people.30 Nevertheless, future\nresearch with more extensive data could examine more\nprecise measures of race/ethnic discrimination.18 24\nPolicy implications\nPublic health policies must seek to improve both neighbour-\nhood and individual conditions. Initiatives that focus solely\non individual factors may be ineffective if they overlook the\nsubstantial neighbourhood barriers--such as discrimination,\neconomic inequality, or norms for excessive drinking or drug\nsocial organisation may be enhanced by expanding resources\nfor teacher and school development in poor or segregated\nareas, and increasing participation in formal and informal\norganisations such as neighbourhood watch programmes, block\ngroups, civic organisations, or churches and temples.19 57\u00ad59\nEconomic deprivation could be ameliorated by integrating\nsubsidised housing into neighbourhoods and developing\npartnerships between businesses and schools to improve tran-\nsitions to work.60 61 Finally, tighter regulation of illicit drug\nsale and use, and alcohol use among minors, may confer some\nof the advantages provided by immigrant communities.31\u00ad33\nPolicy makers must also recognise that local and national\nagendas shape neighbourhoods. For example, strict sentences\nfor drug offences may unintentionally lead to high incarcera-\ntions rates among black men, thereby increasing family and\neconomic disruption because of the shrinking pool of\nthat target the fundamental social and economic disparities\namong racial and ethnic minorities might lower homicide\nmortality more effectively than initiatives that aim solely to\nchange individual behaviours such as drug use or abusive\n"
