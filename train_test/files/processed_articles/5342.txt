A\ntotal of 120 (62 women and 58 men) community-residing older adults completed self-report measures of sources of meaning\nin life, physical health, life satisfaction, depression, personality, existential regrets, attitudes toward aging, and attitudes toward\nlife. Cluster analysis of sources of meaning revealed four distinct meaning orientations: self-transcendent (n = 32), collectivistic\n(n = 24), individualistic (n = 34), and self-preoccupied (n = 30). MANCOVA analysis of the four groups, controlling for age,\nmarital status, education, and financial satisfaction, revealed a strong multivariate main effect for meaning orientation. No\nstatistically significant gender and Gender \u00d7 Meaning orientation interaction effects were found. Older adults, who derive\nmeaning from self-transcendent sources, are more extraverted, open to experience, agreeable, and conscientious; perceive\ngreater purpose and coherence in life; feel more in control in directing their lives; express a stronger desire to get more\nout of life; and are less depressed compared with those who derive meaning through pursuing self-serving interests without\nany real commitment to personal, interpersonal, or societal development. The implications of the findings for positive aging\nare discussed.\n",

Woo1\n Keywords\npersonal meaning orientation, psychosocial adaptation, older adults\nIn recent years, there has been increasing research activity in\nthe study of personal meaning across the life span (e.g., Reker\nis defined as the cognizance of order, coherence, and purpose\nin one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile\ngoals, and the accompanying sense of fulfillment (Reker &\nWong, 1988). A person high on personal meaning has a clear\nlife purpose and a sense of direction, strives for goals consis-\ntent with life purpose, feels satisfied with past achievements,\nand is determined to make the future meaningful. A relatively\nlarge number of empirical studies have clearly demonstrated\nthat meaning in life is an important variable in the buffering\nof stress and the enhancement of physical, psychological,\nVickberg, Bovbjerg, DuHamel, Currie, & Redd, 2000; Zika &\nThe main focus of prior studies has been on personal mean-\ning as a \"global\" construct, defined as the existential belief\nthat life has purpose and coherence. Reker and Wong (1988)\npostulate that a full understanding of personal meaning requires\nboth a top-down (holistic) and a bottom-up (elemental) view\nof life. It is not meaningful to talk about life as a whole as\nhaving meaning; life only contains meanings that are actualized\nthrough specific activities, quests, and goals. However, to achi\neve an enduring type of personal meaning, specific sources\nneed to be integrated into a larger and higher purpose.\nSeveral researchers have observed that individuals extract\nmeaning from a variety of sources, including leisure activi-\nties, meeting basic needs, creative activities, personal rela-\ntionships, personal achievements, personal growth, religious\nactivities, social and political causes, altruism, enduring val-\nues and ideals, traditions and culture, and leaving a legacy\nO'Connor & Chamberlain, 1996; Prager, Savaya, & Bar-Tur,\ningfulness of these sources can be assessed by the Sources of\nMeaning Profile (SOMP) developed by Reker (1991). Stud-\nies using the SOMP measure have shown that the sources\nfrom which individuals derive a sense of meaning varies with\nage group, gender, and ethnic identity (Bar-Tur, Savaya, &\n1Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nGary T. Reker, 1600 West Bank Drive, Peterborough,\nEmail: greker@trentu.ca\n2 SAGE Open\nEven within a specified group, there are many different path-\nways to experience life as meaningful. Several of these indi-\nvidual sources of meaning are associated with global meaning\nand with psychological and physical well-being (Reker, 1988,\nwork of meaningful sources (high breadth vs. low breadth)\nculminated in a heightened sense of meaning fulfillment and\ngreater subjective well-being in older adults. These findings\nsuggest that individuals develop personal meaning orienta-\ntions that individually and collectively contribute to positive\npsychosocial functioning. Relatively little is known about\nthe content and the function of sources of meaning and the\nmeaning system that older individuals create for themselves.\nFurthermore, the literature has not addressed the differential\nimpact that meaning orientations may have on both positive\nand negative indicators of psychosocial adaptation.\nConceptual Framework\nfor the Current Study\nBased on Frankl's (1959) conviction that the full meaning of\nlife can only be achieved by transcending self-interests and\non Rokeach's (1973) hierarchy of values in which certain\nvalues hold greater significance than others, Reker and Wong\n(1988) proposed a model of sources of personal meaning\nconsisting of four levels: self-preoccupation with hedonistic\npleasure and comfort (self-preoccupation), devotion of time\nand energy to the realization of personal potential (individu-\nalism), service to others and commitment to a larger societal\nor political cause (collectivism), and entertaining values that\ntranscend individuals and encompass cosmic meaning and\nultimate purpose (self-transcendence). The levels describe\nqualitatively different personal meaning orientations that\nare postulated to differ in terms of depth of meaning that is\nobtained. Individuals who find meaning through self-interests\nare at the shallow end, whereas those who find meaning through\nhelping others, preserving values and ideals, and spirituality\nare at the deep end. The implication of such a hierarchical\nstructure is that individuals will be able to integrate the con-\ntradictions, conflicts, and absurdities of life by rising above\nthem and viewing them in the context of more comprehensive\nhorizons.\nThe ability of aging individuals to transcend life experi-\nences is postulated to impact positively on psychosocial out-\ncomes. Psychosocial adaptation is defined as the process of\nputting oneself in harmony with the changing circumstances\nof life so as to enhance one's sense of well-being and long-\nterm survivorship. Psychosocial adaptation is achieved through\nthe processes of assimilation (incorporating new information\ninto existing structures) and accommodation (changing\nexisting structures to accommodate new information), invo\nlving the psychological (e.g., changes in perception, attitude,\nbehavior, and motivation) and social (e.g., change in one's\nsocial environment) domains. Outcome indicators of effective\npsychosocial adaptation include, but are not limited to, the\nmaintenance of good physical health, life satisfaction, good\nmental health, positive life-and-death attitudes, high meaning\nand purpose in life, and a stable personality.\nUnderrepresented in prior research with older adults are\npsychosocial variables that focus on existential needs and\n\"ultimate concerns\" with the givens of existence such as one's\nmortality, feelings of isolation, and meaninglessness. Unmet\nneeds can lead to \"existential distress.\" Existential distress\nrefers to negative thoughts and feelings of \"angst\" or anxiety\nthat arise from facing uncertain experiences such as fear of\naging, fear of death, and regrets in life. To the author's knowl-\nedge, no study has been conducted that examines the relation-\nship between personal meaning orientations and existential\ndistress.\nThe conceptual framework for the current study is pre-\nmised on the conviction that, from a psychological perspec-\ntive, the aging process is marked by continuous growth and\ndevelopment. The aging individual plays an active, vital role\nin this process by taking advantage of personal resources to\nactualize the human potential. Moreover, the positive psycho\nlogy movement in psychology (Seligman, Steen, Park, &\nSaleebey, 1992) in gerontological social work emphasizes,\nrecognizes, respects, and appreciates the client's voice, exp\neriences, and personal knowledge about their own situations.\nBy focusing on the skills, knowledge, and residual strengths\nof older persons, much can be learned about how individuals\nsuccessfully cope with adversity and the ever-changing cir-\ncumstances in their lives.\nThe Current Study\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the personal mean-\ning orientations of older adults and to assess the association\nof meaning orientations to measures of life attitudes, physi-\ncal health, subjective well-being, personality, and existential\ntheoretical position that self-transcendence is the key to the\ndiscovery of deeper meaning and increased life satisfaction,\nthe following general hypotheses were formulated:\nHypothesis 1: The personal meaning system of older\nadults will be characterized by four distinct patterns\nthat primarily reflect the transcendent, collectivistic,\nindividualistic, and self-preoccupied orientations.\nThis hypothesis is based on the theoretical specu-\nlation proposed by Reker and Wong (1988) and\nsubsequently supported by empirical investiga-\ntions of sources of meaning in life among young,\nmiddle-aged, and older Canadian elderly (Reker,\n1991), the Dutch elderly (Van Ranst & Marcoen,\nadolescents living in Slovakia (Halama, 2000),\nand middle-aged adults living in New Zealand\nHypothesis 2: Older individuals, who derive meaning\nfrom sources that transcend the self, will show sig-\nnificantly better psychosocial adaptation in terms of\ngreater physical health, increased life satisfaction,\nhigher meaning and purpose in life, lower depression,\ngreater perception of choice and control in directing\none's life, a stronger desire to get more out of life,\nand higher scores on the global personality traits of\nextraversion, openness to experience, agreeable-\nness, and conscientiousness compared with older\nindividuals who find meaning through self-serving\nideals and values. This hypothesis is predicated on\na number of research findings showing that a belief\nsystem based on transcendent meaning is positively\ncorrelated with greater purpose in life (Bolt, 1975;\ndepression (Reker, 1991), the use of constructive\ncoping strategies (Halama, 2000), and better adap-\ntive coping with the problems of aging (Van Ranst\n& Marcoen, 2000). In addition, based on the theo-\nretical formulations of Erikson (1963), Maslow\nto expect that self-transcendent older adults will be\ncharacterized by positive, stable, and adaptive per-\nsonality characteristics.\nHypothesis 3: Older individuals, who derive meaning\nfrom sources that transcend the self, will show sig-\nnificantly reduced existential distress in terms of\nless fear of aging, fewer existential regrets, lower\nexistential vacuum, and less fear of death (i.e.,\ngreater death acceptance) compared with those who\nare preoccupied with the maintenance and achieve-\nment of self-serving values. This hypothesis is\npredicated on the assumption that self-transcendent\nolder adults are better able to put negative thoughts\nand feelings about existential issues into perspec-\ntive more easily and therefore, will not be as distressed\nby them.\nIn sum, prior research on the link between personal meaning\norientations and psychosocial adaptation has been limited to\na fairly narrow range of outcome variables. The evidence to\ndate suggests that individuals of all ages who derive meaning\nfrom sources that go beyond meeting self-serving and indi\nvidual needs also experience more meaningful lives, hold\nmore positive attitudes, are more satisfied, and use more\nadaptive coping strategies.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants in this study were 120 community-residing older\nyears). The majority of the participants were married (62%),\n26% were widowed, 10% were divorced or separated, and\n2% were never married. In terms of educational level, 5%\nhad achieved only the eighth grade, 62% had high school and\ncommunity-college education, 27% achieved a university-\nlevel education, and 6% had postuniversity education. Reg\narding satisfaction with financial status, 33% reported being\nvery to extremely satisfied, 58% were satisfied, and only 9%\nwere dissatisfied.\nThe participants were recruited through various civic and\nsocial organizations, word of mouth, churches, retirement\nresidences, and agencies serving older adults in central Ontario.\nPackets containing a consent form and a counterbalanced set\nof questionnaires were distributed to the participants who\ncompleted them at home and returned them in prepaid enve-\nlopes (for a small number of participants, a research assistant\nretrieved the completed forms). Average time for completion\noffered as an incentive to take part in the study. Of the 136\nrate); incomplete questionnaires for two cases res\nulted in\nusable data from 120 adults. Approximately 10 months follow-\ning data collection, participants, who had requested feedback\non the study, were mailed a summary report of the findings.\nMeasures\nPersonal meaning orientations were assessed using the\nof meaning include meeting basic needs, participating in lei-\nsure activities, taking part in creative activities, engaging in\npersonal relationships with family and/or friends, being ack\nnowledged for personal achievements, experiencing personal\ngrowth, taking part in religious activities, interest in social\ncauses, being of service to others, preserving human values\nand ideals, preservation of culture and tradition, leaving a\nlegacy for the next generation, feeling financially secure,\ninterest in human rights, participation in hedonistic activities,\nacquiring material possessions, and relationship with nature.\nRespondents rate how meaningful each source is at the pres-\nent time in their life on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all mean-\ningful, 7 = extremely meaningful). The alpha coefficients\nreported in several studies conducted in Canada, Australia,\nalpha coefficient for the current sample of older adults was\nPhysical health status was measured by a single-item\n5-point scale with ratings of 1 (poor), 2 (fair), 3 (good), 4 (very\ngood), or 5 (excellent).\nLife satisfaction was measured by the 13-item Life Satis-\nfaction Index\u00adZ (LSI-Z), a modified version of the original\nLSI developed by Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin (1961).\nRatings are on a 3-point scale (agree, disagree, ?). Scores can\nrange from 13 to 39. High scorers take pleasure from activity\nin everyday life, feel satisfied with life, have a positive\nself-image, and maintain happy and optimistic moods and\n4 SAGE Open\nattitudes. For the current sample of older adults, the alpha\ncoefficient was found to be .69.\nDepression was assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depres-\nmeasure of somatic, psychological, psychomotor, and mood\nareas. Ratings are on a 4-point scale (1 = none or little of the\ntime, 4 = most or all of the time). Scores can range from\n20 to 80; a high score reveals greater depression. Alpha coef-\nficients of .77 and .81 have been reported for community and\ninstitutionalized elderly, respectively (Reker, 1997). For the\ncurrent sample, the alpha coefficient was found to be .75. In\nterms of validity, the Zung SDS correlates well with other\nmeasures of depression.\nPersonality was assessed by the extraversion, neuroticism,\nopenness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness\ndimensions of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI)\ndeveloped by Costa and McCrae (1985). Respondents rate\neach of the 60 items on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly\ndisagree, 5 = strongly agree). A high score on each dimen-\nsion reflects greater neuroticism, extraversion, openness to\nexperience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Costa and\nMcCrae (1989) report internal consistency reliability ranging\nfrom .68 (agreeableness) to .86 (neuroticism). The NEO-FFI\npossesses satisfactory psychometric properties and cor\nres\nponds well with the full 181-item scale (Costa & McCrae,\nExistential regret in life was measured by the 20-item Exis-\ntential Regret Scale (ERS) developed by Reker and Parker\n(1999). Existential regret is defined as an inner experience of\ndiscomfort, a brooding over lost opportunities, of not having\nfulfilled one's potential, of having \"unfinished business,\"\nand of not having respected the natural and global environ-\nment. The inner urgings reflect the need to take responsibility\nto actualize one's potential and therefore demands attention.\nExistential regret primarily taps into regret over having failed\nto act (omission) rather than having committed an act (com-\nmission) over which one feels guilty. An example item is,\n\"Missedopportunitieshavehauntedmeallmylife,\"responded\nto on a 7-point Likert-type scale (strongly agree, strongly\ndisagree). Scores can range from 20 to 140. Higher scores\nreflect greater intensity of existential regrets in life. The\nalpha coefficient was found to be .92 for a sample of univer-\nsity students. For the current sample of older adults, the alpha\ncoefficient was .89. In a study of 110 young and middle-aged\nadults, existential regret correlated positively with existen-\ntial frustration (r = .65) and negatively with Ryff's (1989)\nmeasure of integrity (r = \u00ad.70) and the conscientiousness\nFear of aging was measured by the 16-item 7-point Likert-\ntype scale of General Attitudes Toward Aging (GATA) deve\nloped by the primary author. GATA measures fear of aging in\nterms of mobility restrictions, declining future, fear of being\nignored, fear of isolation, financial constraints, and a general\nfear of the aging process itself. Example items are, \"I feel\nthat I have less to look forward to in the future than I did in\nthe past\" and \"As I grow older, I have a fear that I may be\nalone and shut in from the world.\" Scores can range from 16\nto 112. Higher scores reflect a greater fear of aging. For the\ncurrent sample of older adults, the alpha coefficient was found\nto be .87. In a study of 66 older adults, fear of aging was\npositively correlated with depression (r = .45) and regret\n(r = .35) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction\nAttitudes toward life was measured by the Life Attitude\nLikert-type scale consisting of six factorially derived dimen-\nsions: purpose, coherence, choice/responsibleness, death\naccep\ntance, existential vacuum, and goal seeking. Purpose\nrefers to having life goals and a sense of direction from the\npast, in the present, and toward the future. Coherence refers\nto having a sense of order, a reason for existence, and a clear\nsense of personal identity. Choice/responsibleness refers\nto the degree to which a person perceives to have personal\nagency in directing his or her life. Death acceptance refers to\nthe absence of fear and anxiety about death and the accep-\ntance of death as a natural aspect of life. Existential vacuum\nrefers to an absence of meaning in life, boredom, apathy, or\nfeelings of indifference. Goal seeking concerns the desire to\nget away from the routine of life and to search for new expe-\nriences and challenges and an eagerness to get more out of\nlife. Scores on each dimension can range from 8 to 56; a high\ntotal score reflects a high degree of the attribute being mea-\nsured. Indices of internal consistency are generally satisfac-\ntory, ranging from an alpha of .77 to an alpha of .87. Short-term\ntest\u00adretest reliability at a 4- to 6-week interval ranges from\n.77 to .87. Validation studies involving a number of instru-\nments measuring identical and related constructs show good\nconvergence for all LAP-R dimensions (Reker, 1992).\nData Analyses\nFor 14 participants, some questionnaire items contained missing\ndata. In these instances, the mean value of the item was substi-\ntuted. Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine the data\nfor violations of univariate and multivariate homo\ngeneity of\nvariance assumptions. The assumptions were met for all psycho-\nsocial variables except for the personality trait of neuroticism.\nThe data were analyzed using a 2 (sex) \u00d7 4 (meaning ori-\nentation) between-participants MANCOVA. The demographic\nvariables of age, education level, marital status (married vs.\nnot married), and financial satisfaction served as the covari-\nates in the analysis as these showed significant associations\nwith some of the major psychosocial variables (see Table 1).\nThe four levels of meaning orientations were determined by\nK-means cluster analysis performed on the SOMP-R measure,\nusing the cluster analysis module of the Statistica software\nprogram (StatSoft, 1995). All significant univariate main\nand interaction effects of sex and meaning orientation were\nfurther assessed using the Least Significant Difference\n(LSD) post hoc testing procedures.\nResults\nCluster Analysis\nAs a test of Hypothesis 1, cluster analysis performed on the\nSOMP-R Scale revealed four distinct groups. Results are\ngraphically presented in Figure 1. Cluster 1 (self-transcendent\nmeaning orientation) consisted of 32 individuals oriented\ntoward transcendent sources of meaning, such as engaging in\nreligious activities, preserving human values and ideals,\nleaving a legacy for the next generation, interest in humanis-\ntic concerns, and relationship with nature. Cluster 2 (collec-\ntivistic meaning orientation) comprised 24 individuals who\nfound meaning in personal relationships, service to others, and\ncommitment toward larger societal/political causes. Cluster 3\n(individualistic meaning orientation) consisted of 34 indi-\nviduals who found meaning through devotion of time and\nenergy to realize their personal potential such as taking part\nin creative activities, experiencing personal growth, and tak-\ning part in religious activities. Cluster 4 (self-preoccupied\nmeaning orientation) identified 30 individuals who were pri-\nmarily oriented toward finding meaning through pursuing\nself-serving interests, such as engaging in hedonistic activities\nand obtaining material possessions, without any real commit-\nment to personal development, interpersonal relationships,\nor social causes. These meaning-orientation clusters formed\nthe four levels of the independent variable.\nBivariate Correlation Analyses\nThe results of the bivariate correlation analyses are shown in\nTable 1. As can be seen, the demographic variables are sig-\nnificantly, but moderately, related to some of the major psy-\nchosocial variables. Consequently, the demographic variables\nare treated as covariates to control for their association with\nthe psychosocial variables. The correlational analyses indicate\nthat the psychosocial variables constitute a set of relatively\nindependent measures and support the contention that multi-\ncollinearity in the data is not a concern.\nTable 1. Correlation Matrix of Demographic and Psychosocial Variables\n6 SAGE Open\nMultivariate Analysis of Covariance\nHypotheses 2 and 3 were tested using the MANCOVA mod-\nule of the Statistica software program (StatSoft, 1995). With\nthe use of Wilks's criterion, the combined psychosocial vari-\nables were significantly related to the combined covariates,\nanalyses of each psychosocial variable with the covariates as\nmultiple predictors showed that age provided a significant\nadjustment for goal seeking (p < .05), marital status provided\na significant adjustment for purpose and goal seeking (p <\n.05), education level provided a significant adjustment for\nopenness to experiences (p < .001), and financial satisfaction\nprovided a significant adjustment for life satisfaction (p < .001),\nphysical health (p < .01), fear of aging (p < .05), existential\nregret (p < .001), existential vacuum (p < .01), and goal seek-\nThe covariate adjusted means of the psychosocial vari-\nables are presented in Table 2. MANCOVA analysis revealed\na significant multivariate main effect for meaning orienta-\ntions, Wilks's l = 0.33, p < .001. No statistically significant\nmultivariate main effect was found for gender, Wilks's l =\n0.78, p = .073, or the Gender \u00d7 Meaning orientation interac-\ntion, Wilks's l = .54, p = .081. A test of univariate effects of\nmeaning orientations found statistically significant differences\n2.67, p < .05. No statistically significant univariate effects\nwere found for life satisfaction, existential regret, fear of aging,\ndeath acceptance, existential vacuum, and neuroticism.\nSubsequent post hoc comparisons of the significant uni-\nvariate effects (see Table 2) showed that individuals with a\ntranscendent meaning orientation were significantly less dep\nressed, experienced greater purpose, experienced a greater\nsense of coherence, perceived greater choice and a sense of\nresponsibleness, were more active in goal pursuits, and exhi\nbited positive personality traits such as being more outgoing,\nmore open to experience, more agreeable, and more consci-\nentious compared with individuals who found meaning in\nsources reflecting self-serving interests. No significant dif-\nference between the transcendent (M = 3.6) and the self-\npreoccupied (M = 3.5) meaning orientations was found for\nself-rated physical health. When compared with the collec-\ntivistic and the individualistic orientations, transcenders also\nenjoyed better physical health, experienced greater purpose in\nlife, perceived greater choice and a sense of responsibleness,\nwere more active in goal pursuits, more outgoing, and more\nopen to experience. In turn, individuals with a collectivistic\norientation enjoyed better physical health, experienced greater\npurpose and coherence in life, and were more conscientious\ncompared with those with a self-preoccupied orientation\nMean Meaningfulness Rating\nLeisure\nActivities\nBasic\nNeeds\nCreative\nActivities\nPersonal\nRelationships\nPersonal\nGrowth\nReligious\nActivities\nSocial\nCauses\nService\nto Others\nPersonal\nAchievement\nValues &\nIdeals\nCulture &\nTradition\nLeaving\nLegacy\nFinancial\nSecurity\nHuman\nRights\nHedonistic\nActivities\nMaterial\nPossessions\nNature\nTranscendence\nCollectivistic\nIndividualistic\nSelf-Preoccupied\nFigure 1. Plot of means of sources of meaning for each cluster\n(2 vs. 4). Individuals with an individualistic orientation exp\nerienced greater purpose and coherence in life, were more\noutgoing, and were more agreeable compared with those with\na self-preoccupied orientation (3 vs. 4). Finally, the adjusted\nmean scores on the psychosocial variables for the collectivis-\ntic and the individualistic meaning orientations fell between\nthe transcendent and the self-preoccupied orientations, but\nonly choice/responsibleness significantly differentiated the\ncollectivistic from the individualistic individuals, with the for-\nmer perceiving greater choice in their lives and an increased\nsense of responsibleness. In general, when all significant psy\nchosocial variables are considered together, individuals with\na transcendent personal meaning orientation showed the best\nadjustment in physical, psychological, social, and emotional\nwell-being domains whereas those with a self-preoccupied\norientation anchored the opposite end of the adjustment\ncontinuum.\nDiscussion\nThe overall purpose of this study was to address two general\nquestions: \"Are there different pathways to experience one's\nlife and aging as meaningful?\" and \"How do these pathways\nrelate to psychosocial adaptation?\" In exploring the ways, we\nfocused on the identification of patterns of sources of per-\nsonal meaning in older adults and attempted to extend earlier\nresearch on young and middle-aged adults in whom four dis-\ntinct meaning orientations were found. We then examined\nthe impact of these meaning orientations on both positive and\nnegative indicators of psychosocial adaptation.\nOur results fully support Hypothesis 1. Cluster analysis of\nsources of meaning identified four distinct groups of older\nmen and women who are distributed fairly equally across the\nclusters: transcendent (27%), collectivism (20%), individu-\nalism (28%), and self-preoccupied (25%). Consistent with\nwhat one might expect in an individualistic North American\nsociety, the individualism meaning orientation was found to\nbe most salient in this sample of older adults. However, per-\ncentage differences across meaning orientations were very\nsmall. Thus, there is little evidence that one meaning orienta-\ntion predominates over another. The personal meaning system\nof older adults appears to be characterized by heterogeneity,\na finding also observed in the physical and cognitive domains\nof human functioning. There are, indeed, a variety of different\npathways through which to experience one's life and aging\nas meaningful.\nHypothesis 2 stated that transcenders would show better\nadjustment on a number of positive psychosocial variables\ncompared with the self-preoccupied. The hypothesis was\nsupported for some but not all psychosocial variables. Tran-\nscenders showed better adjustment in terms of lower depres-\nsion, higher meaning and purpose in life, greater sense of\nchoice and control in directing one's life, and higher scores\non the global personality dimensions of extraversion, openness\nto experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Trans\ncenders could not be differentiated from the self-preoccupied\nTable 2. Covariate Adjusted Means (Standard Deviations) of Psychosocial Variables as a Function of Personal Meaning Orientations\nPsychosocial variables\nPersonal meaning orientation\nPlanned comparisons\nTranscendent\nCollectivistic\nIndividualistic\nSelf-preoccupied\nPhysical health\nMental health\nLife attitudes\nPersonality\n8 SAGE Open\non self-rated physical health, life satisfaction, and neuroti-\ncism. Our results regarding life satisfaction and neuroticism\n(i.e., anxiety facet) support the findings based on community-\nresiding older adults reported by Van Ranst and Marcoen\n(2000). The finding that transcenders could not be differenti-\nated from the self-preoccupied on life satisfaction in the Van\nRanst and Marcoen study as well as the current study raises\ndoubts regarding Tornstam's (1997) postulate that gerotran-\nscendence leads to increased life satisfaction. However, it is\npossible that our measure of personal meaning orientations\nreflect life goals and values that have been adopted and pur-\nsued but not yet achieved by the respondents. According to\nFrankl (1959), one way of finding meaning in life is through\ncommitting oneself to something, be it nature, culture, or by\nloving another human being. Therefore, a deeper sense of\ncommitment to values and the attainment of life goals may\nbe required before life satisfaction can ensue. Future longitu-\ndinal studies that distinguish between sources of meaning\nthat have actually been achieved versus sources that have\nonly been endorsed might help to clarify this issue. Nonethe-\nless, our findings suggest that adopting values that go beyond\nself-interests is associated with a number of positive indices\nof psychosocial adaptation.\nHypothesis 3, which focused on psychosocial variables\nreflecting existential distress, was not supported. Transcend-\ners could not be significantly differentiated from the self-\npreoccupied in terms of fear of aging, existential regret,\nexis\ntential vacuum, and fear of death (i.e., low death accep-\ntance). In fact, none of the personal meaning orientations could\nbe differentiated from each other on the distress variables.\nTwo factors may have contributed to this finding. First, the\nsample as a whole did not experience high levels of existen-\ntial distress on any of the individual indicators as evidenced by\nthe absolute mean values relative to the maximum/minimum\nscores possible. Second, although the differences were in the\npredicted direction (existential regret being the exception),\ngreater variability on some psychosocial variables was noted\nfor some meaning orientations. Consequently, it is possible\nthat the combination of a higher functioning sample and dif-\nferential variability precluded finding significant differences\namong meaning orientations on the distress measures. Thus,\nbefore drawing any firm conclusions regarding the influence\nof personal meaning orientations on existential distress, addi-\ntional studies will need to be conducted on samples of older\nadults who are confronted with more distressing life experi-\nences such as chronic illnesses, life-threatening health prob-\nlems, and/or end-of-life decision making regarding treatment.\nLimitations of the Study\nBefore considering the implications of our findings, a num-\nber of limitations should be addressed. First, our initial goal\nwas to demonstrate that different meaning orientations could\nbe reliably identified in a sample of older adults and differ-\nentiated on a number of psychosocial variables. Although it\nis tempting to speculate as to the direction of influence, the\ncross-sectional design of this study does not permit us to deter\nmine the causal relationships among the variables assessed.\nA strong association between personal meaning orientations\nand a number of positive psychosocial variables has been\ndemonstrated; however, it is not known whether having a\nparticular meaning orientation leads to better psychoso-\ncial adaptation or whether good psychosocial adaptation\nleads to the adoption of values that go beyond self-serving\nneeds. Second, the present study used a volunteer sample of\ncommunity-residing older adults characterized by above-\naverage functioning. Such individuals are expected to have a\ncoherent life structure and high goal achievement. Thus, it is\nnot clear whether our present findings would generalize to\nthe general population of community-residing elderly or to\nthose living in institutional environments. Finally, the present\nresults were achieved with a relatively small sample size and\nare in need of replication and cross-validation.\nIn spite of these limitations, our findings have implications\nfor positive psychology and what is possible to achieve in the\n2005). Given the psychosocial variables investigated in this\nstudy, it would appear that older men and women who \"see\nthe bigger picture\" by discovering and creating meaning\nfrom sources that go beyond self-serving interests are char-\nacterized by stable personalities and higher levels of psycho-\nlogical, social, and emotional well-being. The experience of\nmeaning at higher plateaus and broader horizons facilitates\ntransformation, the process of converting a given reality into\na new potentiality. Transformative processes can lead to a suc\ncession of adaptations and the unlimited capacity to deal with\na variety of personal and situational circumstances. Through\ntransformation, the older individual is able to resolve the con-\ntradictions, conflicts, and absurdities of life and create new\nways of being-in-the-world.\nIn conclusion, our focus on an older person's existential\nbelief system (i.e., personal meaning orientation) offers\nan explanation as to why many older adults do not show a\ndecline in life satisfaction and purpose for living in the face\nof difficult life situations. Although our society has done a\ngood job in providing for the physical, health, and mobility\nneeds of older adults, we have been slow to address their\nexistential needs through existentially based interventions,\nsuch as meaning-making and spirituality, that offer a more\nholistic and multifaceted approach. We hope that our\nfindings will lead to the implementation of programs for\ncommunity-residing as well as institutionalized older adults\nthat provide the structural supports and opportunities nec-\nessary for engagement in self-transcendent behaviors with\nthe goal of strengthening the inner resilience of our aging\npopulation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBar-Tur, L., Savaya, R., & Prager, E.
