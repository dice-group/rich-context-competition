The goals\nincluded estimating heritability of Alzheimer's disease and identifying risk and protective factors in twin\npairs discordant for the disease. The data, including not only diagnoses and age of onset but also extensive\ninformation about potential environmental risk factors, are now archived as Study ICPSR 25963 at National\nArchive for Computerized Data on Aging, Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, at\nthe University of Michigan, and available for researchers to use. Up to the time of archiving, 215 cases of\ndementia have been identified from a base sample of 2,394 individuals.\nKeywords: twins, heritability, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, epidemiology\nThe   (sometimes re-\nferred to as `SALZA') was launched in 1984 to identify all\ncases of dementia within the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study\nof Aging (SATSA). SATSA has been described in prior com-\npilations of twin registers in this journal (Pedersen et al.,\nitself a selected subset of the Swedish Twin Register (STR);\nspecifically, SATSA is comprised of all STR twins who were\nseparated and reared apart and a matched sample that were\nreared together. Because we superimposed a dementia study\non an ongoing registry-based study of normal aging, the\nsample is population-based and is not limited to insti-\ntutionalized cases or to those who have sought medical\ntreatment.\nIn this article, we describe the SALZA study and available\ndatabase archived at the National Archive for Computerized\nData on Aging, Inter-university Consortium for Political\nand Social Research, at the University of Michigan, in order\nto encourage use by other researchers.\nSample\nThe SATSA population was comprehensively identified\nfrom the STR to include all reared apart pairs and a matched\nviduals). However, not all twins responded to initial mailed\nSATSA questionnaires. For the dementia study, in addition\nto screening SATSA responders, we attempted to contact\nall of those non-responders who were born 1935 or earlier\nin order to have a comprehensive ascertainment of cases\nwithin this defined population. Individuals were included\nif they were alive in 1987 and if they were in the SATSA\npopulation as originally drawn, whether or not they had\never responded to any SATSA data collection effort, and\nwhether or not their twin sibling was alive. The resulting\nbase sample for SALZA consisted of 2,394 individuals.\nCognitive Screening Protocol\nWe employed telephone cognitive screening with non-\nresponders. The interview protocol is referred to as TELE\n(Gatz et al., 1995). The TELE for twins includes a brief\nmental status test and questions about health and daily\nfunctioning. If twins did poorly on the cognitive screening\nor if we could not reach the twin, we sought to interview an\ninformant. The informant version of TELE asks about the\ntwin's memory and cognitive problems.\nFor twins participating in SATSA in-person testing, in-\nstead of telephone screening, we used their score on the\nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al.,\n1975) that was administered as part of SATSA in-person\ntesting. Any twin who met cutoffs on either the TELE or\nMMSE was invited to a complete clinical workup, as were\ntheir co-twins.\nADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Margaret Gatz, Department of\nPsychology, University of Southern California, 3620\nE-mail: gatz@usc.edu\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Pedersen\nScreening began during the second wave of SATSA\ndata collection and was repeated after each successive\nwave of SATSA in order to identify incident cases of\ndementia.\nClinical Assessment and Diagnosis\nA physician and a psychologist visited each twin at home\nand completed a full clinical evaluation for dementia, in-\ncluding cognitive tests, physical exam, medical history, and\naninformant'sdescriptionofthecourseofcognitivedecline.\nWhere possible, the twins were also referred for diagnostic\nneuroimaging, involving a CT at a local hospital. Individual\nimages of the entire head were typically taken parallel to the\norbitomeatal line, with CT performed without contrast un-\nless contrast was necessary for clinical reasons. A consensus\nconference including members of the assessment teams and\nan independent clinician considered all of the information\nand arrived at a clinical diagnosis, including whether there\nwas dementia present, age of onset, and type of dementia.\nInitially, diagnostic decisions were guided by DSM-III-R\ncriteria for dementia (American Psychiatric Association,\n1987), NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable and possible\nAlzheimer's disease (McKhann et al., 1984), and other cri-\nteria for other subtypes. As they became available, NINDS-\nAIREN criteria were used for vascular dementia (Roman\net al., 1993), and DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Associa-\ntion, 2000) was used in addition to DSM-III-R.\nBoth members of twin pairs were followed longitudi-\nnally. Pairs where both were non-demented continued to\nbe followed by SATSA. The same diagnostic procedures\nwere used when incident cases were found from longi-\ntudinal evaluations of twins who had been diagnosed as\nnot demented at first assessment or in later waves of\nBecause SATSA has continued to collect data at approx-\nimately three-year intervals, we have added new cases of\ndementia identified at subsequent waves of SATSA. The\narchived database currently continues through the sixth\nwave of in-person testing, with dementia diagnoses through\na differential diagnosis for dementia.\nDNA Collection\nBlood collected during the clinical evaluation has been used\nfor clinical chemistries, DNA extraction, and confirmation\nof zygosity using microsatellite markers (Lichtenstein et al.,\n2002) whenever not available from the STR or SATSA.\nQuestionnaires\nAt the time of the clinical workup, the twin and an in-\nformant were extensively interviewed with respect to family\nhistory, medical risk factors, and environmental risk or pro-\ntective factors. Twins were asked to provide a comparative\nrating whether oneself or ones twin had greater exposure to\na variety of putative risks (Reynolds et al., 2005). Question-\nnaire forms as well as the resulting data are included with\nthe archived database. Additionally, all SATSA twins were\nasked similar questions about risk and protective factors in\nthe third wave of in-person testing and in the fourth wave\nof mailed questionnaires, comprising prospective informa-\ntion for incident cases, and also included with the archived\ndatabase.\nThe public-use data cover background information; ages\nat each data collection point; cognitive screening; clini-\ncal dementia diagnoses; cognitive test results; medical his-\ntory and medical risk factors; residential, occupational, and\nleisure activities history; family history of dementia; and\nAPOE genotype (see Table 1 for N of participants with\neach data element).\nPreviously Collected Data\nBecause SALZA twins were from the STR, data collected\ninformation about midlife risk or protective factors, e.g.,\nparticipation in leisure activities. For those SALZA twins\nwho participated in SATSA prior to being identified for\nSALZA, there are cognitive test results from the time prior\nto dementia onset and prospective risk or protective factors\nfrom both questionnaires, e.g., personality, and biomarkers,\ne.g., cholesterol levels. Further, because the STR is regularly\nlinked with the Swedish Patient Registry, information is\navailable about hospitalization for diseases such as heart\ndisease or diabetes prior to dementia onset.\nResearch Approach\nAnalyses using SALZA data include estimating heritabil-\nity of Alzheimer's disease (Gatz et al., 1997; Pedersen\ndant twin pair design to identify risk and protective factors\nwhere results from matched pairs are compared to case-\nCombined SATSA and SALZA data are analyzed with lon-\ngitudinal growth and survival methods. Genetic analyses\nuse combined data from multiple Swedish twin studies of\naging.\nArchiving the data makes it possible for other investiga-\ntors not only to use the data for new analyses but also to\npool with other dementia studies.\nSubsequent Work\nAs described in prior special issues of this journal on twin\nbeginning in 1998, all twins in the Swedish Twin Reg-\nistry born before 1958 were screened by telephone for the\nmost common complex diseases in the effort known as\nScreening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study.
