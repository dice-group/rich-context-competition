For example, .50\nmillion Americans (.30% of the population) have hypertension,\nAmericans lose their life to heart disease every year (4); and 24\nmillion children and adults have diabetes (7.8% of the pop-\nulation), with 57 million Americans having prediabetes or im-\npaired fasting glucose (5). Given the enormous public health\ncosts of these diseases through untimely deaths, disability, or\nlost worker productivity, improving the dietary habits of the\nAmerican population is urgently warranted (6, 7).\nThe primary national mechanism used to communicate the\nimportance of good dietary habits is through the Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans, which is published jointly every 5 y\nby the US Departments of Health and Human Services and\nAgriculture (8). In addition, the United States has mandated\nnutritional labeling on most food packages through the Nutrition\nLabeling and Education Act of 1990 (9). These labels were\ninstituted to assist the population in making healthier dietary\nchoices that would ultimately have a positive effect on public\nhealth (10). However, despite the detailed nutrition information\nprinted on most food packages, many Americans ignore these\nlabels and continue to make bad dietary choices (11). Even with\nincreasing usage of food labels, many Americans still have dif-\nficulty understanding and applying the information in their lives\ndue to deficits in literacy and numeracy and other issues (12).\nSeveral studies have investigated the relation between the use\nof nutrition label information, health status, and related behaviors\nwith varying results (13\u00ad15). For example, in one study, the use\nof nutrition labels was inversely related to a person's intake of\ntotal fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol (15). Another study\nshowed that reading labels was associated with nutrition\nknowledge, perceived importance of a healthy diet, and an un-\nderstanding that eating too much fat is related to being un-\nhealthy (15). Furthermore, a study in patients receiving care\nfrom medical clinics reported that those individuals reading\nnutrition labels in the prior year ate less fat and more fruit and\nvegetables than did subjects who did not use labels (16). An-\nother study showed that '80% of the participants read labels\nand that label use was related to eating less fat (14). Finally,\na population-based assessment of African Americans showed\nthat the use of nutrition labels was related to obesity, healthy\neating self-efficacy (ie, self-confidence in one's ability to eat\n1 From the Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences (JEL) and\nEpidemiologyr and Public Health (KLA, WGL, LEF, DJL, EPD, AJC-M,\nNAD, KEM, FCB, and JDC), the University of Miami Miller School of\nMedicine, Miami, FL.\n2 Supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Occupational\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nmore fruit and vegetables and less fat), a belief in a diet-cancer\nrelation, and trying to lose weight (17).\nAlthough these aforementioned studies have attempted to\nexplain some of the diverse sociodemographic, psychosocial, and\nattitudinal factors related to using nutritional labels, it is virtually\nunknown how often nutrition labels are used by people who\nalready have been diagnosed with a chronic disease or condition\n(eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, over-\nweight, or diabetes). In addition to the use of labels, the\nawareness of basic nutrition information, such as the US dietary\nguidelines, the Food Guide Pyramid, or the 5-A-Day program,\namong persons with chronic disease is also uncertain. Thus, the\nobjective of this study was to assess nutrition label and in-\nformation use among persons with major chronic diseases and to\ncorrelate such behaviors with reported dietary habits by using\na nationally representative sample of the US population.\nData source\nSurvey (NHANES), as part of the ongoing, stratified, multistage\nprobability sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized\npopulation, asked participants 17 questions regarding their\nawareness of federal nutrition information programs and their\nuse of food labels and asked them to provide two 24-h dietary\nrecalls by interviews conducted on nonconsecutive days, which\nwere used to derive values for total energy and protein, car-\nbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, and fiber in grams (18). Household\ninterviews were conducted in persons aged 17 y to determine\nresponses to all of these label use and dietary behavior items.\nlow were used to construct the chronic disease categories,\nwhich included 1) hypertension, 2) hypercholesterolemia, 3)\ndiabetes/at risk of diabetes, 4) overweight, and 5) chronic heart\ndisease. A total of 5603 respondents were used for analysis in\nthis study, representing '222 million people (calculated by\nusing the Current Population Surveys for persons aged 17 y\nas recommended in the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention NHANES tutorial ``Age Standardization and Pop-\nulation Counts'' at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/Nhanes/\nNHANESAnalyses/AgeStandardization/age_standardization_\nintro.htm). This study was approved by the University of Miami\nInstitutional Review Board for Human Subjects.\nChronic disease items\nFor our analysis, we selected chronic diseases inherently re-\nlated to poor or inadequate nutrition, including hypertension,\nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes/at risk of diabetes, overweight,\nand heart disease. These conditions are self-reported within\nNHANES and are defined by a ``yes'' response to any of the\nfollowing questions: 1) Has your doctor ever said you had hy-\npertension or high blood pressure? (hypertension); 2) Has your\ndoctor ever said that your cholesterol was too high? (hyper-\ncholesterolemia); 3a) Has your doctor ever said that you had\ndiabetes or sugar diabetes? 3b) Has doctor ever said that you had\nprediabetes, borderline diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose?\n3c) Has your doctor ever said that you had a health risk of di-\nabetes? (diabetes/at risk of diabetes); 4) Has your doctor ever\nsaid that you were overweight? (overweight); and 5a) Has your\ndoctor ever said that you had heart failure? 5b) Has your doctor\never said that you had coronary heart disease? 5c) Has your\ndoctor ever said that you had angina/angina pectoris? 5d) Has\nyour doctor ever said that you had a heart attack? 5e) Has your\ndoctor ever said that you had a stroke? (heart disease).\nLabel use behavior items\nThe NHANES asked detailed questions about behaviors re-\nlated to using food labels and being aware of nutritional in-\nformation. Each participant was queried about the following: 1)\nHave you heard of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans? 2)\nHave you heard of the Food Guide Pyramid? 3) Have you heard\nof the 5-A-Day program? 4) How often do you use the nutrition\nfacts panel? 5) How often do you use the list of ingredients? 6)\nHow often do you use the size of serving? 7) How often do you\nuse the health claim? 8) How often do you use information about\ncalories? 9) How often do you use the information about calories\nfrom fat? 10) How often do you use information about total fat?\n11) How often do you use information about trans fat? 12) How\noften do you use information about saturated fat? 13) How often\ndo you use information about cholesterol? 14) How often do you\nuse information about sodium? 15) How often do you use in-\nformation about carbohydrates? 16) How often do you use in-\nformation about fiber? 17) How often do you use information\nabout sugars?\nReported dietary behavior\nParticipants were interviewed on nonconsecutive days to recall\ndietary data from two 24-h periods. This recall was analyzed to\nprovide total energy and protein, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat,\nand fiber in grams. To analyze how participants in each chronic\ndisease group were actually eating compared with national\nrecommendations for protein, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, and\nfiber, the 2-d average for each of these variables was used. The\n2-d average of total energy (calories) was used as the denominator\nin these calculations. Because protein, carbohydrate, fat, and\nsaturated fat variables are reported in grams, protein (g) and\ncarbohydrate (g) were multiplied by 4 to get protein and car-\nbohydrate in energy (in calories), and fat (g) and saturated fat (g)\nwere multiplied by 9 to get fat and saturated fat in energy (in\ncalories). Each of these 4 categories was divided by the total\nenergy to get the percentage daily intake for each nutrient. To fall\nwithin the recommended guidelines of the Institute of Medicine\n(19), the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human\nServices (20), the American College of Sports Medicine, and the\nAmerican Dietetic Association (21), we used the following\nranges for participants for each macronutrient: 1) protein 10\u00ad\ntotal fat 30% of daily energy, 4) saturated fat 10% of daily\nenergy, and 5) 25 g fiber/d. On the basis of their score, par-\nticipants were then dichotomized as being either ``adherent'' or\n``nonadherent'' to the guidelines for each of these macronutrients.\nStatistical analysis\nFrequency and descriptive statistics were calculated on all\nlabel use behavior items by age, body mass index (BMI), marital\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nDemographic and clinical variables by chronic disease among participants of the 2005\u00ad2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)1\nHypertension Hypercholesterolemia\nDiabetes/at risk\nof diabetes Overweight\nHeart\ndisease\nNo Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes\nMarried (%)\nRace-ethnicity (%)\nSex (%)\nEducation (%)\nInsurance (%)\nSaw health care\nprofessional in\nlast year (%)\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nstatus, ethnicity-race, sex, and education for each of the 5 disease\ncategories. We used a principal components factor analysis with\nan oblique rotation to form scales from the 17 label use behavior\nquestions. A polychoric correlation matrix was used as the basis\nof this analysis because the items were mostly 5-point Likert\nscales, except for the 3 binary ``awareness'' items. To determine\nwhich items were associated with each factor, we chose items\nfrom the reference structure matrix that had a semipartial cor-\nrelation coefficient of 0.50. Cronbach's coefficient a was cal-\nculated for each scale to determine internal consistency. Linear\nregression was then used to calculate the means and standard\nerrors for the label use behavior scales adjusted for the de-\nmographic variables. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS)\n9.21 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used for data manage-\nment and all analyses. SAS survey procedures were used to\nperform weighted analyses that adjusted for the design effects of\nthe complex sampling used for NHANES. The percentages and\nstandard errors shown in Table 1 were computed by PROC\nSURVEYFREQ, and the means and standard errors were pro-\nduced by PROC SURVEYMEANS. The factor analysis results\nin Table 2 were unweighted because the polychoric correlation\nroutine that computes the correlation matrix used in the factor\nanalysis does not accommodate weights. The means and stan-\ndard errors in Tables 3 and 4 were computed by the ESTIMATE\nstatement in PROC SURVEYREG and were adjusted for the\ncovariates in Table 1 (ie, age, BMI, marital status, race-ethnicity,\nsex, education, insurance status, and doctor's visit).\nRESULTS\nThe numbers of eligible respondents who did or did not have\nthe self-reported chronic disease and demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics, including age, sex, race-ethnicity, education,\nBMI, marital status, health insurance coverage, and at least one\nmedical visit in the prior year are shown in Table 1. These data\nvaried considerably with chronic disease status but were not\ncompared statistically because they are reported only for de-\nscriptive purposes.\nFactor analysis\nWe computed 3 scales from the factor analysis of the 17 label\nuse behavior items. The 3 factors accounted for 79% of the\ntotal variance. The reference structure matrix and a-coefficients\nfor the 3 computed scales shown in Table 2, are as follows: 1)\nchecking for specific micro- or macronutrients on the label\nfor total, saturated, and trans fat and total calories and calories\nfrom fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, sodium, fiber, and sugar\n(``Check''); 2) using general information on the packaging, such\nas the ingredient list on the label, health claims on packages,\nserving size information, and nutrition facts panel (``Use''); and\n3) being aware of national recommendations and guidelines of\nthe Food Guide Pyramid, the 5-A-Day program, and the US\ndietary guidelines (``Aware''). After the scales were formed,\nthey were scored by summing the item responses. ``Check'' is\nthe sum of 10 items with responses of 1\u00ad5; ``Use'' is the sum of\n4 items that range from 1 to 5; and ``Aware'' is the sum of 3\nitems with responses of 0 or 1.\nLinear regression\nThe multivariate-adjusted means and standard errors for the\n``Check,'' ``Use,'' and ``Aware'' scales for each of the 5 chronic\ndisease categories, comparing those who did and those who did\nnot have a disorder, are shown in Table 3.

Participants\nwith hypercholesterolemia showed more behaviors related to\nchecking for nutrient information on labels (P \u00bc 0.014) and\nused more label and package information (P \u00bc 0.005) than those\nwith normal cholesterol. Subjects with diabetes or who were at\nrisk of diabetes and/or who were overweight displayed greater\nawareness of national dietary recommendations, used more label\nand package information, and checked for nutrient information\non labels when measured against those without diabetes or who\nwere not at risk of diabetes or of normal weight, respectively (all\nP values ,0.01). Participants who did not have heart disease\nused more label and package information than did their coun-\nterparts with heart disease (P \u00bc 0.043). Thus, in general, persons\nwith a history of chronic disease reported that they checked and\nused label and package information and were more aware of\nguidelines than those who did not have chronic disease.\nAnalysis of covariance between label use scales reported\ndietary behavior scores\nThe means and standard errors (adjusted by age, BMI, marital\nstatus, race-ethnicity, sex, education, insurance status, and\ndoctor's visit in prior year), calculated by using the label use\nscales as dependent variables and the reported dietary behavior\nscores as independent variables for participants who had 1 of\nthe 5 chronic diseases, divided by adherent or nonadherent to\nthe dietary guidelines for each macronutrient according to the\nmethodology described above, are shown in Table 4. Significant\ndifferences were observed for the following: 1) carbohydrate\nand protein and ``Aware,'' fiber and saturated fat and ``Use,''\nand saturated fat and ``Check'' for hypertension; 2) fiber and\n``Aware,'' protein and total and saturated fat and ``Check,'' and\nfiber, protein, and saturated fat and ``Use'' for hypercholester-\nolemia; 3) carbohydrate and fiber and ``Aware,'' protein and\nsaturated fat and ``Check,'' and fiber, protein, and saturated fat\nand ``Use'' for diabetes/at risk of diabetes; 4) fiber and protein\nand ``Use'' and protein and ``Check'' for overweight; and 5)\nfiber and total and saturated fat and ``Use'' and fiber and total\nand saturated fat and ``Check'' for heart disease. In summary,\nthe label use scales (``Aware,'' ``Use,'' and ``Check'') were re-\nlated to nonadherence to dietary recommendations for carbo-\nhydrate and protein consumption, whereas the scales were\nrelated to adherence to dietary recommendations for fiber and\ntotal and saturated fat, particularly for heart disease. All other\ndifferences between groups were nonsignificant.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this population-based study of Americans with different\nchronic diseases known to have at least a partial dietary etiologic\ncomponent (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes/at risk\nof diabetes, overweight, and heart disease), we examined nu-\ntrition label use by checking behaviors and awareness of national\nnutrition information campaigns and by comparing such be-\nhaviors with reported dietary intake. After reducing the 17 in-\ndividual label use behavior items to 3 well-defined scales (ie,\n``Check,'' ``Use,'' and ``Aware''), we found that persons with\nchronic diseases checked and used nutritional label information\nand were more aware of national nutrition recommendations than\nthose participants who did not report having such diseases. In\nparticular, those with diabetes/at risk of diabetes and/or who were\noverweight reported significantly more checking, using, and\nawareness behaviors than did their nondiabetic and normal\nweight counterparts, respectively. The results of our study are\nstrengthened by usinging the NHANES, which provides a data set\nthat is generalizable to the US population.\nThe results of our study provide useful information for policy\nmakers who are planning future national nutrition information\ncampaigns. Although using labels and being aware of nutritional\ninformation before being diagnosed with chronic disease would\nbe preferable, reversal of disease symptoms is possible with\nlifestyle changes, such as adopting healthier eating habits (22,\n23). Thus, providing information about using nutrition labels\nand about the key national campaigns may prove beneficial for\npeople attending primary care or specialty medical clinics in\nencouraging the adoption of healthier dietary behaviors. In ad-\ndition, people who use labels and are aware of important nu-\ntritional information may have certain dietary concerns and want\nto limit their consumption of fat and/or total calories, obtain\nadequate amounts of key nutrients, and/or increase fiber con-\nsumption. Another study showed that label users believed that\nnutrition information is important in making food choices\ncompared with those who did not use labels (24).\nIn this study, we also compared label use behaviors with\nreported dietary behavior scores that were derived from the\nreported intake of protein, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat,\nand fiber. Participants were dichotomized into whether or not\nthey adhered to daily recommendations for each of these nu-\ntrients and then the scores on the check, use, and aware factors\nwere compared for adherent and nonadherent subgroups for\neach chronic disease group. Our analysis reveals a relation be-\ntween those participants with hypertension, hypercholesterol-\nemia, overweight, or diabetes/at risk of diabetes and those who\nwere nonadherent for dietary recommendations for carbohydrate\nor protein; these participants also scored higher on awareness of\nnational dietary guidelines or using or checking dietary labels.\nIn contrast, participants representing all 5 chronic diseases,\nparticularly heart disease, who adhered to dietary recommen-\ndations for fiber and total and saturated fat scored higher on the\naware, use, and check factors. Thus, we would surmise that the\nuse of information on nutrition labels and being more aware of\nnutritional recommendations is related to meeting the daily\nrecommendations for fiber and total and saturated fat. However,\ngreater use of labels and awareness of recommendations may\nnot necessarily preclude other healthier behaviors. The use and\nawareness of dietary information has been positively correlated\nwith increased nutrition knowledge and more favorable attitudes\nabout labels in a study of college students (25), which suggests\nthat nutrition knowledge is an important factor in food label use.\nLimitations of this study include not being able to determine\nwhether participants are using and checking labels only for\ncertain foods and/or whether or not labels are being compared for\ndifferent foods. Participants might be using certain foods as\nbenchmarks--whether they are healthy or not--to make com-\nparisons between amount of fat, number of calories, or amount of\nsodium, for example, to make a purchasing decision without any\nunderstanding of what is considered a healthy amount of these\nnutrients to consume daily. If the participant is uninformed about\nhow much of what nutrients to consume, especially someone who\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nhas already been diagnosed with one of these chronic diseases,\nthen the use of nutrition labels may be less than effective. We also\ndo not know if a participant is checking the label only the first\ntime that a product is bought and thus may not feel the need to\nlook at the label for successive purchases.\nAnother limitation is the inability to ascertain causality, given\nthe cross-sectional nature of the study. Although it is more\nplausible that the presence of chronic disease preceded the ini-\ntiation of food label use and awareness of nutrition information, it\nis possible that a person was making use of food labels and was\naware of nutrition information before receiving a diagnosis of\na chronic disease. Thus, food label use and nutrition awareness\nprior to diagnosis with a chronic disease implies that somehow\nthe nutrition information gained from reading labels and attained\nfrom other sources is not as effective as it is believed to be, that it\nis not being used properly, or that it is confusing the individual in\nways that prevent positive health outcomes. Furthermore, we do\nnot know whether the diagnosed participants are making use of\nnutrition labels and are more aware of dietary recommendations\nin response to being told about their medical condition. We also\ndo not know where these participants are receiving their advice to\nuse nutrition information and recommendations, but one likely\nsource would be the physician's office.\nThe results of our study suggest that those people who have\nbeen diagnosed with a chronic disease may be open to increasing\nhealthy dietary behaviors, given their greater use of nutrition\nlabels and awareness of national nutrition recommendations.\nHowever, just because people know about and use labels does not\nnecessarily translate into healthy dietary behavior. Thus, within\nthe spectrum of these chronic diseases, opportunities may exist to\nfurther increase the use of food labels and the awareness of\nnutritional recommendations in the context of improving healthy\ndietary behaviors by using tailored, disease-specific messages.\nGiven that higher intakes of certain nutrients (eg, fat, trans fat,\nand saturated fat) are linked to a greater risk of heart disease and\nother chronic conditions (26, 27), individuals without disease\nwho do not use label information compared with those already\ndiagnosed with a disease would benefit from label information\nand perhaps reduce their risk of developing these diseases.\nNonetheless, continued efforts at increasing the use of food la-\nbels and promoting awareness of nutritional information and\nrecommendations are critically important in attempting to cur-\ntail the various epidemics of chronic disease that the United\nStates currently faces.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--JEL, KLA, WGL, LEF,\nDJL, NAD, KEM, JDC, EPD, AJC-M, and FCB: contributed to the design\nof the study; JEL, KLA, LEF, DJL, NAD, KEM, EPD, and AJC-M: contrib-\nuted to the writing of the article; and WGL, KLA, JEL, LEF, DJL, and AJC-M:\ncontributed to the analysis of the data.
