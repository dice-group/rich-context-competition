Nine percent of the participants experienced\nphysical violence in the 12 months preceding the study. The majority of perpetrators were relatives of patients. Chi-square\ntests suggested significant relationships between type of hospital and workplace physical violence, and between intention\nto quit the nursing profession and workplace physical violence. Workplace violence had several negative effects on nurses\nincluding having disturbing memories about the incident and being \"super alert\" and vigilant. Strategies to curb workplace\nviolence could include awareness creation among health care workers and the general public. Policies and legislations must\nalso be put in place to address this social problem.\n",

It undermines the safety,\ndignity, well-being, and happiness of workers (Bowie,\nMagnavita & Heponiemi, 2011). Besides, it can also affect\norganizations adversely through the payment of compensa-\ntions, absenteeism, low productivity, dissatisfaction, and\nhigh employee turnover rates among others (Bowie et al.,\nleading cause of workplace deaths in the United States, par-\nticularly for women. Severe injuries or death resulting from\nworkplace physical violence may seem remote in many\ncountries but its other impacts cannot be underestimated\n(Kerr, 2010). The aim of this study was to document the inci-\ndence, sources, and effects of workplace physical violence\nagainst Ghanaian nurses.\nWorkplace violence has become an endemic problem in\nticularly at a higher risk of abuse (AbuAlRub & Al-Asmar,\na quarter of the world's workplace violence occurs in that\nsector (Azodo, Ezeja, & Ehikhamenor, 2011). Numerous\nstudies conducted across different countries such asAustralia\nGacki-Smith et al., 2009; Hanson, Perrin, Moss, Laharnar, &\nGlass, 2015), United Kingdom (Lepping, Lanka, Turner,\nSwitzerland (Hahn et al., 2010), Egypt (Samir, Mohamed,\nMoustafa, & Abou Saif, 2012), Jordan (AbuAlRub &\n(Khalil, 2009) suggest that workplace violence is a problem\nfor health care workers in both developed and developing\ncountries.\nWorkplace physical violence against nurses may vary\nacross departments/units with emergency, psychiatric, and\nintensive care units reputed to have the highest rates of physi-\ncal assaults (Darawad, Al-Hussami, Saleh, Mustafa, & Odeh,\nPark, Cho, & Hong, 2015). This has been attributed largely to\nthenatureofcasesthattheseunitsusuallyattendto.Depending\non the unit where nurses work, they may experience more\nphysical violence than other nurses within the same hospital\n1University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana\n2Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nIsaac Mensah Boafo, Department of Sociology, University of Ghana,\nLegon, Accra, Ghana.\nEmail: imboafo@gmail.com\nWorkplace Violence Against Nurses:\nA Cross-Sectional Descriptive Study of\nGhanaian Nurses\nIsaac Mensah Boafo1 and Peter Hancock2\n Keywords\nGhana, nurses, workplace violence, physical violence, effects, hospital\n2 SAGE Open\nWorkplace violence may adversely affect the personal\nand professional well-being of nurses. Victims of workplace\nviolence may suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder,\nimpaired work performance, and insomnia (AbuAlRub &\n& Malik, 2014). Workplace violence has also been found to\ninfluence nurses' turnover and turnover intentions (Boafo,\nHancock, & Gringart, 2016; Dithisawatwet, Sawaengdee,\nTangcharoensathien, Teerawit, & Thinkamrop, 2014).\nIn spite of the fact that workplace violence against health\ncare professionals have become a topical issue in the last\ncouple of decades (Gabe & Elston, 2008), there is a paucity\nof research on the problem in Ghana. Until 2016, when we\n(Boafo et al., 2016) published the incidence of verbal abuse\nand sexual harassment against Ghanaian nurses, no literature\nexisted on workplace violence against nurses in the country.\nTo date, no study has been conducted on the prevalence of\nphysical violence against nurses in Ghana. However, media\nreports on speeches by prominent people in the health care\nsector point to the fact that violence against health care pro-\nfessionals indeed happens in many Ghanaian health care\nfacilities. These reports suggest that workplace violence is\nnot concentrated in psychiatric hospitals but is becoming a\ngeneral problem for health care professionals in public hos-\nan electronic media organization reported that the Akatsi\nDistrict chairperson of the Ghana Registered Nurses\nAssociation (GRNA) stated during the nurses' week celebra-\ntion that Ghanaian nurses leave the country to seek greener\npastures in other countries \"because we face some risk of\nviolence coupled with poor salaries and wages\" (\"Only\nthe prevalence and importance of violence as a variable to\nthe retention of the already inadequate number of nurses in the\ncountry (Ghana Health Service, 2010). Furthermore, in a\nsymposium organized as part of the health service week cel-\nebrations in 2010 by the Health Services Workers'Union, the\nparliament of Ghana was implored to consider enacting laws\non violence against health care workers to ensure that health\ncare personnel worked in an atmosphere of peace. It was\nnoted that violent attacks on health care workers were appall-\ning, and there was the need for legislation on the issue to\nensure maximum health care delivery (\"Health Personnel\nWant Legislation,\" 2010). There has indeed been a situation\nwhere the health workers of a hospital have gone on strike to\nprotest against assault on some of their colleagues by sec-\ntions of the public (\"Doctors at LEKMA Stay Away From\nincidence of nonphysical violence among the sample\nreported in this article.\nThese reports give a cause to worry considering the fact\nthat workplace violence is associated with intentions to\nleave the nursing profession (Boafo et al., 2016;\nDithisawatwet et al., 2014). In Ghana, the nurse\u00adpatient\nratio is low, and it is still worsening, a situation that is\ndescribed in the 2012 annual progress report on the imple-\nmentation of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development\nAgenda (\"Ghana's Doctor-to-Patient Ratio Worsens,\"\n2014). The report showed that the nurse\u00adpopulation ratio\nfor the country worsened from one nurse to 1,240 people in\ndrop that the set target for the year 2012 was one nurse to\nwhich suffer a critical shortage of health care professionals\nincluding nurses. Moreover, added to these problems is that\na significant number of nurses are lost through emigration\n(Buchan & Dovlo, 2004). It therefore becomes imperative\nto address the issue of violence against nurses so that it\ndoes not exacerbate the situation of there being an insuffi-\ncient number of nurses in the country.\nAny policy or legislation seeking to address the problem\nof workplace physical violence in the health care sector\nmust, however, be based on evidence regarding the sources\nand magnitude of the problem. It has been suggested that\ngovernments' failure to collect data on violence against\nnurses accounts for the inability to make effective policies to\naddress the problem (Boafo et al., 2016; International\nCouncil of Nurses [ICN], 2000). Although numerous studies\nhave been conducted on the phenomenon in different coun-\ntries, it is only possible to apply their results to Ghana to a\nlimited extent. The reasons for this, among others, may be\nfound in the differing organizational structures of health\ncare, and in differing training and qualification of health care\nstaff, as well as varying sociocultural context. The risk of\nviolence, for instance, may be understood differently by peo-\nple depending on their cultural backgrounds and position\nwithin the health care institution. It is in relation to these that\nthe current article documents the incidence and distribution\nof physical violence against nurses in Ghana. Three main\nresearch questions are addressed:\nResearch Question 1: What is the incidence rate of\nworkplace physical violence against nurses in Ghana?\nResearch Question 2: What are the effects of workplace\nphysical violence against nurses in Ghana?\nResearch Question 3: Is there a relationship between\nworkplace physical violence and intention to quit the\nnursing profession?\nDefinition of Workplace Violence\nThe study upon which this article is based adopts the interna-\ntionally recognized definition by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) for workplace violence. It defined\nworkplace violence as \"incidents where staff are abused,\nthreatened, or assaulted in circumstances related to their\nwork . . . involving an explicit or implicit challenge to their\nsafety, well-being or health\" (Wang, Hayes, & O'Brien-\nPallas, 2008, p. 31). This definition incorporates all the forms\nBoafo and Hancock 3\nof workplace violence such as physical violence, verbal vio-\nlence, sexual abuse, and so on.\nThe definition further provides descriptions of actions\nthat constitute each of the various types of violence. The sub-\nject of this article, physical violence, includes \"beating, slap-\nping, shooting, pinching, scratching, and biting that cause\nphysical, sexual or psychological harm to the worker\" (Di\nMethod\nSampling and Procedures\nA multistage sampling technique was used in the current\nstudy. Data were collected between September 2013 and\nhospitals were involved in the study.\nThe first stage of the sampling procedures involved pur-\nposively selecting two teaching hospitals. Korle Bu and\nTamale Teaching Hospitals were selected to ensure that there\nwas a southern\u00adnorthern balance. Five regional hospitals\nwere selected from five randomly selected regions of Ghana.\nThe final stage of hospital selection involved randomly\nselecting one district hospital from each of the chosen\nregions. To ensure that nurses working on all shifts were cov-\nered, the data collection took place between 12:00 p.m. and\n9:00 p.m. Data were collected by the corresponding author\nand four trained research assistants.\nIn each hospital, nurses were selected from the various\nunits/departments through simple random sampling. The\ninclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (a) a partici-\npant should be a qualified nurse, and (b) a participant should\nhave at least 1 year nursing experience. A total of 1,021\nnurses were requested to get involved in the study, and 685\naccepted to be part by completing a questionnaire. However,\n89 of the questionnaires were not properly completed, and\nwere not included in the analyses. Four participants were\nfound to be deputy directors of nursing services and were\nalso removed from the analyses because they were too few in\nnumber for any significant statistical analysis. At the end, the\ndata presented here are that received from 592 participants.\nMeasures\nThe International Labour Organization, ICN, the WHO, and\nthe Public Services International's (ILO/ICN/WHO/PSI,\n2003) Health Sector Workplace Violence Questionnaire was\nadapted for the current article. Sections in the questionnaire\nsuch as bullying and racial harassment and other items which\nfell outside the purview of the study were removed. The\nadjusted questionnaire was reviewed by five professional\nnurses for face validity, clarity, and sensitivity of items.\nPhysical violence was recorded using a single-item scale.\nParticipants were asked \"In the last 12 months, have you\nbeen physically attacked in your workplace?\" (yes/no). In\nview of this, it was not possible to determine its reliability by\nCronbach's alpha. However, before the start of the study, the\ninstrument was tested on 20 nurses who were not part of the\nstudy on two occasions with a 2-week interval. The test\u00ad\nretest correlation coefficient (Nagy, 2002) for physical vio-\nThis questionnaire was adopted because it has been used\nin several studies across different countries such as Iran\n(Esmaeilpour, Salsali, & Ahmadi, 2011), Jordan (AbuAlRub\n& Al-Asmar, 2011), Brazil, Lebanon, Portugal, Bulgaria, and\nThailand (Di Martino, 2002). In Africa, it has been used in\nSouth Africa (Steinman, 2003) and Mozambique (Adam,\nCaldas, Aly, & Capece, 2003). The current study is, there-\nfore, comparable with other studies within and outside\nAfrica.\nThe research instrument was also used to collect data on\nnurses' intentions to quit the nursing profession. It adopted\nthe approach of Kankaanranta and Rissanen (2008) by using\nsingle-item categorical (dichotomous) variable to measure\nintention to quit. Participants were asked, \"Do you have the\nintention of quitting your job as a nurse in the near future?\"\nThe structure of this item is also the same as the one which\nwas used to measure Ghanaian nurses' emigration intentions\n(Anarfi, Quartey, & Agyei, 2010). The test\u00adretest correlation\ncoefficient for the intention to quit variable was .9. Details of\nthe methods used for the study have been published else-\nEthical Issues\nEthical clearances were given by the Edith Cowan\nUniversity Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)\nand the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee.\nPermissions were also given by the medical superintendent\nor hospital administrator (where appropriate) and the head\nof nursing services of each hospital prior to the commence-\nment of data collection. The aim of the study was explained\nto all participants, and they were assured of confidentiality.\nParticipants were not allowed to write their names or any\nother information that could be used to trace them on the\nquestionnaire. They were asked to retain the questionnaires\nuntil the researcher or research assistants came around to\ncollect them. Participation in the study was voluntary, and\nparticipants were at liberty to pull out of the study without\nany consequences.\nData Analyses\nThe data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 20.\nFrequencies, means, and standard deviations (SDs) were\nused to describe the sociodemographic and workplace char-\nacteristics of participants and to establish the incidence and\nsources of workplace violence. Chi-square test was used to\ntest the association between workplace physical violence and\nsociodemographic characteristics. It was also used in testing\n4 SAGE Open\nthe association between workplace physical violence and\nintention to quit the nursing profession.\nResults\nDemographic and Workplace Characteristics\nThe demographic and workplace characteristics of the\nresearch participants are presented in Table 1.

One third (32.9%) of the participants worked\nin teaching hospitals, 38.7% worked in regional hospitals,\nand a further 28.4% were nurses in district hospitals.\nIn terms of gender, 79.2% of the sample were females and\nwere not married. The mean age of the sample was 31.76\nyears (SD = 9.53); the minimum and maximum ages were 21\nand 60 years, respectively. In all, 61.3% of participants had a\ndiploma qualification, and 52.0% were staff nurses. On the\naverage, participants had worked in nursing for 7.38 years\ntient department (OPD), and more than a quarter (35.3%)\nwere employed in the medical and surgical units.\nIn relation to established protocol for reporting workplace\nviolence against nurses, 72.1% reported that such protocols\nexisted, and 80.1% of these reported they know how follow\nthrough these procedures. The mean score for nurses' con-\ncern over workplace violence suggested that nurses were\nmoderately concerned about workplace violence; however,\nthe mode revealed a contrary view. A relative majority of the\nsample were extremely concerned about workplace violence\n5). The demographic and workplace characteristics of the\nstudy sample have also been published elsewhere (Boafo\nIncidence and Sources of Physical Workplace\nViolence\nThe results as presented in Table 2 showed that, of the 592\nnurses included in the study, 53 (9.0%) had experienced\nphysical violence in the 12 months prior to the study. Of\nChi-square analysis showed that this difference was statisti-\ncally not significant. In terms of regional distribution of the\nincidence of workplace physical violence against nurses,\n32.1% of victims were nurses in the Greater Accra region,\nand 22.6% in the Eastern and Ashanti regions. Regional dif-\nferences in exposure to physical violence were also not sta-\ntistically significant.\nWorkplace physical violence against nurses was perpe-\ntrated by patients and their relatives, other nurses, and doc-\ntors. The results showed that relatives of patients were the\nmost frequent perpetrators of physical violence against\nnurses. They were responsible for more than half (58.5%) of\nphysical violence perpetrated against nurses. The analyses\nfurther showed that 20.8% of those who were physically\nTable 1.

There was, however, a statistically significant asso-\nciation between physical workplace abuse and the type of\nhospital, with nurses in the regional hospitals being more\nlikely to be abused physically in the workplace, 2(N = 592,\nEffects and Reactions to Workplace Physical\nViolence\nAs shown in Table 3, reactions to physical violence ranged\nfromtakingnoactiontopursuingprosecution.Encouragingly,\nthe most frequent (35.8%) response to physical violence was\nreporting to a senior staff member/unit in charge. This was\nfollowed by telling a colleague about the incident (32.1%)\nand then taking no action (18.8%). Thirty-one percent of the\nrespondents who have been abused indicated that action was\ntaken to investigate the causes of the incident. All investiga-\ntions were initiated by the nursing administration/unit in\ncharge.\nOnly 9.8% of cases were reported to the police. A relative\nmajority (43.9%) of attackers were given verbal warning.\nThose who did not report the incident provided various rea-\nsons for doing so; more than one third (36%) believed it was\nnot important to report, and 32% thought no action will be\ntaken if reported. Indeed, if no action will be taken if reported,\nthen it is not important to report. Being extremely \"super\nalert\" or watchful and on guard was the most frequently\nreported effect of workplace physical violence. Data on the\nreactions to workplace physical violence and its effects are\npresented in Table 4.\nOne fifth (19.9%) of participants in the entire sample indi-\ncated they had intentions of quitting the nursing profession\n(not shown in table).

Although the incidence of physical workplace\nviolence found among Ghanaian nurses (9.0%) was lower\nthan what has been reported by many other studies on the\nsuffered physical violence reported that they became\nextremely \"super alert\" and on guard. This finding, which is\nconsistent with studies such as AbuAlRub and Al-Asmar\na significant proportion of participants in their studies who\nwere exposed to physical violence became extremely super\nalert), is disturbing and necessitates the formulation of poli-\ncies to address the problem. This is because quality care\npartly depends on the quality of the relationship between\nnurses and clients. Obviously, nurses cannot deliver high\nquality service if they are overly alert as a result of the expe-\nrience of violence. It has been confirmed by research that\nworkplace physical violence negatively affects the services\nThe article also showed that workplace physical violence\nhas implications for the retention of the already insufficient\nnumber of nurses in Ghana. A statistically significant asso-\nciation was found between physical violence and intention to\nquit the nursing profession. This finding corroborates the\nresults of several studies (e.g., Dithisawatwet et al., 2014;\nhave linked workplace violence to nurses leaving the\nprofession.\nUnlike what has been reported in several studies, there was\nno statistically significant association between physical vio-\nlence and the unit where one worked. This suggests that phys-\nical violence is a generalized phenomenon in general hospitals\nin Ghana, and not concentrated in any particular unit or\ndepartment. However, there was a statistically significant\nassociation between hospital type and the incidence of vio-\nlence with regional hospitals recording the highest incidence.\nThis situation may be due to the inadequate security coupled\nTable 4.

In a Jordanian study, Darawad et al. (2015) reported over-\ncrowding and workload to be the most common cause of vio-\nlence against nurses.\nAbout a tenth (9.0%) of the participants reported to have\nexperienced physical violence. Most of the violent incidents\nwhich occurred in the workplace were perpetrated by patients\nand their relatives, and a significant number of such inci-\ndents were not reported. The two most frequent reasons\ngiven for not reporting physical violence was \"it was not\nimportant,\" and \"I thought no action will be taken if\nreported.\" Certainly, it is not important to report an incident\nif one thinks that nothing will be done after a report is made.\nIt is therefore important that clear measures are put in place\nto address the problem. Necessary action must be taken\nagainst perpetrators of violence, and nurses who report vio-\nlence against them should be informed of what action has\nbeen taken against the offender.\nLimitations\nThis study excludes nurses working in clinics and health\nposts located in rural and or remote areas of the country.\nNurses working in private hospitals were also not included in\nthe study. The findings of the current study may thus not be\ngeneralizable to these sections of Ghanaian nurses. As an\ninherent weakness of cross-sectional surveys, no cause and\neffect relationships can be established from the current study.\nRecommendations for Future Research and\nPractice\nFuture studies could explore whether there are differences in\nviolence exposure among nurses in the private and public\nhealth sectors. It will also be useful to have longitudinal stud-\nies conducted to ascertain whether intention to quit leads to\nactual quitting behavior among Ghanaian nurses, consider-\ning the fact that unemployment rates are high in the country.\nOn how to curb the phenomenon of workplace physical\nviolence against Ghanaian nurses, the current article recom-\nmends the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Educational campaigns could be carried out to consci-\nentize the public on the matter. Legislations and \"zero\ntolerance\" of violence policies must be formulated to\ncombat the problem.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Clear reporting procedures must be established by\nhospitals, and nurses encouraged to report violence\nagainst them.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Reports of violence must be acted upon in a timely\nmanner, and affected nurses given necessary support.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Finally, it is important that security is boosted at the\nvarious government hospitals, especially the regional\nhospitals.\nConclusion\nThe findings in this article are consistent with several studies\nwhich have found workplace violence to be a major problem\nfor nurses. The most frequent perpetrators of physical vio-\nlence were patients' relations. It is recommended that educa-\ntional programs are designed to foster awareness on the\nphenomena and their impacts on nurses and the health care\ndelivery. It is also recommended that clear policies are insti-\ntuted to address the problem.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbuAlRub, R.
