Redelings,* Frank Sorvillo,*\nand Laurene Mascola*\nReported mortality rates from Clostridium difficile dis-\nease in the United States increased from 5.7 per million\nrates may be due to emergence of a highly virulent strain\nof C. difficile. Rates were higher for whites than for other\nracial/ethnic groups.\nClostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram-positive ba-\ncillus that can cause considerable disease, including\ndiarrhea, colitis, and septicemia, resulting in death (1). C.\ndifficile\u00adassociated disease (CDAD) primarily affects per-\nsons >65 years. Risk factors include residence in hospitals\nand long-term care facilities and the use of antimicrobial\nmedications (1\u00ad3). Incidence of CDAD has been increas-\ning, and severe cases are becoming more common (4,5).\nThese changes in the incidence and severity of CDAD may\nbe associated with the emergence of a more virulent strain\nof C. difficile bacteria (5,6). Death rates associated with C.\nWales (7,8). However, no trend analysis was conducted to\nevaluate the rate of increase. We incorporated mortality\ndata for the United States through the year 2004 to con-\nduct trend analyses of CDAD-related deaths and to exam-\nine demographic characteristics and coexisting conditions\nreported in deaths from C. difficile infection.\nThe Study\nCDAD-related deaths were identified by using mul-\ntiple cause-of-death data from national mortality records\ndeaths for which the underlying cause of death or any of\nthe contributing causes of death included the International\nClassification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code\nA04.7 (enterocolitis due to C. difficile). Information about\nthe size and demographic breakdown of the US population\nand intercensal year estimates with bridged race data (9,10).\nAge-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by using the\nage distribution of the 2000 US population as a standard\n(11). The US population was divided into 5 racial/ethnic\ncategories: white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, black,\nand American Indian/Alaska Native.\ndeath for 20,642 persons. CDAD was reported as the un-\nof 3,256 deaths were reported related to all other intestinal\nexcluding A047) over the same period. The median age of\ndeath for CDAD patients was 82 years. Age-adjusted mor-\ntality rates from CDAD were slightly higher for men than\nfor women (Table) and were higher for whites than for any\nother racial/ethnic group. Most CDAD-related deaths oc-\nhome.\nCommon coexisting conditions for CDAD-related\nHIV was reported for 81 CDAD-related deaths (<1%).\nyears of age, HIV was reported for 72 (10%).\nThe overall rate of C. difficile\u00adrelated deaths during\nthe study period was 12.2 deaths per million population.\nMortality rates related to CDAD increased during the study\nperiod (Figure), rising from 5.7 deaths per million popula-\nPoisson regression estimates showed mortality rates in-\ncreased by 35% per year (coefficient = 0.30, standard error\nstudy period.\nConclusions\nDue to the inclusion of CDAD-related deaths when\nCDAD was not reported as the underlying cause of death,\nreported death rates in this study were higher than those\npublished in an earlier analysis of CDAD-related deaths in\nthe United States (7). C. difficile is a cause of a substantial\nand increasing proportion of deaths in the United States\nand may be underrecognized as a cause of death. Little at-\ntention has been paid to C. difficile prevention; media and\npublic health awareness efforts have focused largely on\nthe prevention of disease from other intestinal pathogens\nsuch as Escherichia coli or Salmonella spp. However, the\nincidence of deaths from C. difficile is greater than the ex-\ntent of deaths from all other intestinal infectious diseases\ncombined. C. difficile\u00adrelated mortality rates were higher\n*Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, USA; and University of California Los Angeles\u00adSchool\nof Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA\nDISPATCHES\nfor whites than for other racial/ethnic groups. Racial/eth-\nnic differences in insurance status and access to care (12)\nmay render elderly whites more likely to receive treatment\nwith antimicrobial drugs that put them at risk for C. dif-\nficile infection. However, genetic or other factors may also\nbe involved, and further research is needed to determine\nthe causes of racial/ethnic differences in C. difficile\u00adrelated\ndeaths.\nPrevious research showed increases in CDAD-related\nanalysis estimates the rate of increase at 35% per year, and\nshows that mortality rates continued to increase at least\nuntil 2004. Increases in incidence and deaths from CDAD\nmay be associated with the emergence of a new and more\nvirulent strain of C. difficile (5). The emergence of virulent\nstrains of C. difficile makes continued assessment of mor-\ntality statistics important.\nInfection with C. difficile is associated with recent use\nof antimicrobial medications and with residence in hos-\npitals. Most CDAD cases are acquired in healthcare set-\ntings (1), and as many as 90% of cases may be associated\nwith antimicrobial drug use (2,3). High C. difficile death\nrates call attention to the importance of proper infection\ncontrol practices in hospitals and long-term care facilities\nand the judicious use of antimicrobial medications. Further\nresearch is needed to explore current questions concern-\ning which antimicrobial medications, if any, will lead to\nInfections such as septicemia, pneumonia, and urinary\ntract infections were commonly reported in conjunction\nwith C. difficile\u00adrelated deaths. For some of these patients,\nthe administration of antimicrobial medications to treat in-\nfections from other pathogens may have paved the way for\ninfection with C. difficile. However, other risk factors are\nknown, so that in many cases the careful use of antimicro-\nbial agents may not be enough to prevent C. difficile infec-\ntion. HIV infection was only reported in a small fraction of\nCDAD\u00adrelated deaths. However, immunosuppression and\nthe use of prophylactic antimicrobial drugs in persons with\nAIDS may increase the risk for CDAD (15), and the effects\nof HIV should not be overlooked. In persons 25\u00ad54 years\nTable.

Thus, HIV can considerably increase C.\ndifficile death rates for demographic groups in which HIV\nprevalence is high.\nDeath certificate data may underrepresent the extent of\nCDAD-related deaths. This analysis was limited to deaths\nin which ICD-10 code A047 (enterocolitis due to C. diffi-\ncile) was mentioned and may have failed to capture CDAD-\nrelated deaths in which colitis was not present. In addition,\ndeath certificate data may be affected by reporting error.\nSupplemental information such as decedents' medical his-\ntories was unavailable. No data were available regarding\nwhich strains of C. difficile were responsible for reported\nCDAD\u00adrelated deaths.\nC. difficile is an underrecognized cause of severe ill-\nness and death. This analysis underscores the importance\nof CDAD as a public health problem and the increasing\nincidence of CDAD-related deaths in the United States.\nMr Redelings is an epidemiology analyst with the Los An-\ngeles County Department of Public Health.

His current research interests\ninclude the epidemiology of gastrointestinal infections and the\nprevention of disease in refugee situations.\nReferences\n1. Kelly CP, Pothoulakis C, LaMont TJ.
