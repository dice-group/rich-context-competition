Severe acute respiratory syndrome\u00adassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was introduced to the United\nStates through air travel. Although the risk of SARS-CoV transmission within aircraft cabins has been addressed by\nseveral studies, the magnitude of the risk remains unclear.\nMethods. We attempted to contact all persons with working US telephone numbers aboard seven US-bound flights\ncarrying SARS patients. Consenting participants responded to a questionnaire, and a serum sample was collected\nat least 38 days after the flight and tested for SARS-CoV-associated antibodies. Participants reporting an illness\ncompatible with SARS, with onset during the 2- to 10-day incubation period, were considered suspect cases; positive\nserology was required for confirmed cases.\ntionnaires, and blood was collected from 127 (37%). Serology was negative for all 127 participants, including three of\nfour who met the clinical case criteria for SARS, and the fourth had a mild illness that lasted only 5 days.\nConclusions. Transmission of SARS-associated CoV was not observed, suggesting that the risk of transmission is not\namplified aboard aircraft.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a\nnew disease caused by a novel SARS coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV).1,2 It is characterized by fever and re-\nspiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of\nbreath3 and is fatal in about 10% of cases.4 The virus\nis thought to be transmitted from person to person,\nprimarily through large respiratory droplets.5\nThefirstSARScasesappearedinSouthernChina\nbreak was considered over, 8,096 probable cases,\ncountries.4 In the United States, 72 probable cases\nwere identified, only 8 of which were laboratory\nconfirmed as SARS-CoV infections.6\nPublic concern that the environment in aircraft\ncabinscouldenhanceSARS-CoVtransmissionmay\nhave contributed to decreased air travel during the\noutbreak.7 Although several reports have been pub-\nlished on possible SARS-CoV transmission aboard\naircraft,8\u00ad11 theriskoftransmissionremainsunclear.\nTo assess the risk of in-flight SARS-CoV transmis-\nsion, we conducted an investigation of passengers\nand crew aboard US-bound aircraft carrying pas-\nsengers with SARS-CoV infection who were ill\nwithin 1 week of the flight.\nMethods\nThe five index patients included in this evaluation\nbecame ill in February or March 2003 after travel-\ning to a SARS-affected region (Table1).

One patient (patient B) became ill 2 days\nafter the flight.12 The onset date for the final patient\n(patient E) is unclear, as mild symptoms appeared 3\ndays before the flight, resolved 1 day after they\nappeared, and then reappeared 1 week after the\nflight. For two of the patients (patients B and E),\nthere was evidence of secondary transmission.12\nEach of seven flights carried one index patient.\nTwoflightsweredomestic,threeoriginatedinHong\nKong, one in Taipei, and one in Tokyo (Table 1).\nHong Kong and Taiwan began experiencing SARS\noutbreaks in February and March 2003, respec-\ntively.6,13 Flight durations were more than 12 hours\nand less than 2 hours for international and domestic\nflights, respectively.\nAll passengers listed on the flight manifests and\ncrew members who were aboard the selected flights\nwere eligible to participate in the study. Addition-\nally, participants were required to have working US\ntelephone numbers and to speak English or a lan-\nguage spoken by one of our translators (Mandarin,\nCantonese, Korean, and Spanish). Flight manifests,\nwhich included passenger names and seat assign-\nments, were requested from the airlines. Reserva-\ntions records, frequent flyer data, and crew\nemployment records, all of which included limited\ncontact information, were also requested from the\nairlines. For international flights, customs declara-\ntions were obtained from US Customs and Border\nProtection, Department of Homeland Security.\nCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(CDC)\nstaff attempted to locate US telephone numbers for\npassengers and crew when this information was not\nprovided or was incorrect.\nThis investigation was conducted as part of the\npublic health response to the SARS outbreak. In-\nformed consent was obtained from participants be-\nfore epidemiologic and clinical information, and\nblood specimens were collected. Staff from either\nCDCorstateorlocalhealthdepartmentscontacted\npassengers and crew by telephone and asked them\nto complete a standardized, interviewer-adminis-\ntered questionnaire, inquiring about demograph-\nics, potential SARS-CoV exposures, and SARS-\ncompatible symptoms experienced within 10 days\nof the flight. If participants consented to have blood\ndrawn for SARS-CoV testing, arrangements were\nmade for a home visit to occur \u00b338 days after the\nflight (28 days after the maximum 10-day incuba-\ntion period).14 Sera were sent to CDC and tested for\nSARS-CoV antibodies by enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent\nantibody test.2\nOur case definition was based on the SARS case\ndefinition established by CDC.14 Participants with\nan illness that met the clinical criteria [fever >38\u00b0C\nplus cough or shortness of breath 2 to 10 days after\nthe flight (the SARS incubation period)] and who\nwere laboratory confirmed to have detectable\nSARS-CoVantibody\u00b338daysaftertheflightwould\nbe considered confirmed cases of SARS. If clinical\ncriteria were met but serologic status was unknown\nor inconclusive, the participant would be consid-\nered a suspect case patient. All participants without\ndetectable SARS-CoV antibodies would be consid-\nered noncases, regardless of symptoms.\nResults\nFlight manifests demonstrated that a total of 1,766\npassengers and crew members were aboard the\nseven flights; working US telephone numbers en-\nthosecontacted,aninterviewwascompletedfor312\nrologictesting.Interviewswereconductedamedian\nbloodwasdrawnamedianof124daysaftertheflight\naboard international flights who completed a cus-\ntoms declaration form, 552 (51%) were not US resi-\ndents and were, therefore, not likely to have US\ntelephone numbers. Of the 208 passengers who\nwere seated within three rows (to the front and rear)\nof the index patient, 39 were interviewed partici-\npants and 12 were serologically tested. Fifteen par-\nticipants were seated within three rows of an index\npatient who was coughing during the flight. Four of\nthe 12 interviewed crew members reported working\nin the same section as the ill patient.\nthe 312 participants and tested for SARS-CoV anti-\nbodies; all the samples were negative (Table 2). One\nor more potential SARS symptoms were reported\nples for testing and had no detectable SARS-CoV\nantibodies. Four of these participants reported a\ncombination of symptoms that met the clinical cri-\nteria for SARS. However, three were tested and had\nno detectable SARS-CoV antibodies. The fourth\nwas an adolescent whose parents did not consent to\nhaving a blood sample drawn. Other than being\nRisk of SARS-Associated Coronavirus Transmission Aboard Aircraft\nseated three rows in front of the index patient on a\ndomestic flight, she had no known exposures to\nSARS patients and had never traveled to any SARS-\naffected regions. Her illness was mild and resolved\nafter 5 days.\nTo assess the randomness of participant distri-\nbution throughout the aircraft cabins, a nearest\nneighbor analysis15 was performed. Results did not\ndemonstrate significant geographic clustering of\nparticipants (p > 0.05) in any of the flights. In addi-\ntion, analyses were performed to address concerns\nthat this investigation had insufficient power to\ndetect SARS-CoV transmission aboard aircraft.\nUsing the Poisson distribution, we calculated a\nhypothetical attack rate, given our sample size of\n127 (the total number of participants with serologic\nresults), an alpha of 0.05, and a beta of 0.2. We de-\ntermined that the probability of observing zero\ncases was consistent with an attack rate of less than\n3%.Ifthetruerateoftransmissionaboardaircraftis\ngreater than 3%, then there would have been a 95%\nprobability of finding at least one case of aircraft\nexposure-related SARS among the 127 persons\ntested for SARS-CoV antibodies.\nDiscussion\nNo infection resulting from transmission of SARS-\nCoV was documented aboard seven commercial\nflights that carried persons with SARS. Among the\nwhose serum samples were tested, 4 met the clinical\ncase criteria but 3 were found to be negative for\nSARS-CoV antibodies and did not meet the SARS\nclinical case definition. Because the fourth suspect\ncase patient did not consent to provide a blood sam-\nple, laboratory evaluation was not possible.\nOther investigations that examined the risk of\nSARS-CoV transmission aboard aircraft have re-\ncently been published.8\u00ad11 However, we questioned\nwhether all reported cases truly represented in-\nflight transmission because not all index patients in-\ncluded in these studies had laboratory-confirmed\nSARS-CoV infection. Moreover, most cases of pre-\nsumed secondary transmission occurred among per-\nsons who had visited SARS-affected regions within\nthe incubation period, leaving open the possibility\nthat transmission could have occurred before board-\ning the flight. For example, Olsen10 and colleagues re-\npotentiallyinfectedduringaflightfromHongKongto\nBeijing.Althoughtransmissionseemslikelytohaveoc-\ncurred,theindexpatientwasnotlaboratoryconfirmed\nand the flight originated in a SARS-affected area.\nOur finding that no confirmed cases of in-flight\ntransmission were identified aboard any of the seven\naircraft included in the investigation suggests that\nthe risk of SARS-CoV transmission is not high\naboardaircraft.However,otherexplanationsforthis\nfinding are possible. For example, the five index pa-\ntients, all of whom were well enough to travel, may\nnot have been infectious during the flight, despite\nthepresenceofsymptoms.Onlyoneflightcarriedan\nindex patient (patient A) who flew approximately 1\nweekaftersymptomonsetwhenviralloadsarepeak-\ning and risk of transmission is likely increased.16\u00ad18\nEven though most of the passengers and crew we\nwere able to contact were willing to participate, the\nmajor weakness of our investigation was its limited\nsamplesize.Thelargeproportionofpassengersand\ncrew living outside the United States restricted the\nnumber of eligible participants. Contact informa-\ntion from the airlines was of variable quality and\nincomplete since airlines typically purge reserva-\ntions data 48 hours after landing.19 Customs decla-\nrations, available only for international flights, are\nhandwritten, difficult to read, and often do not in-\nclude adequate contact information. The process\nTable 2 Description of participant symptoms and SARS-CoV antibody serologic status, 2003*\nTotal number of participants\nSARS-CoV status\nNumber tested (% of total) Numberpositive\n*SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV antibody = antibody to SARS coronavirus.\nDenominators vary because of missing values.\nRefers to the period 2 to 10 days after flight.\nVogt et al.\nof locating airline passengers for public health\npurposes could be significantly improved if data\nsuch as telephone numbers and addresses were\nprovided from the airlines to public health agencies\nrapidly and in an electronic format. Another poten-\ntial weakness involves the possibility that SARS\nsymptoms might have been inaccurately recalled by\nparticipants, especially if interviews took place well\nafter the flight occurred. However, because SARS\nsymptoms are generally quite severe, we feel that\ninaccurate recall is unlikely to have caused us to miss\na case.\nSARS-CoVcouldpotentiallybetransmittedany-\nwherepeoplearegathered,includingaircraftcabins.\nHowever, the relevant question is whether the air-\ncraft cabin environment leads to a higher risk of\ntransmission. Although our sample size was limited,\nour findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV trans-\nmission is not high aboard aircraft, even among pas-\nsengers seated near the index patient on long flights.\nThe probability of transmission is more likely to be\ndetermined by the infectiousness of the index pa-\ntient rather than the physical setting (eg, aircraft,\nclassroom, or hospital). Thus, prevention efforts for\nair travel should continue to focus on reducing in-\nfectiousparticlesonaircraftbydiscouragingpersons\nwho are acutely ill from traveling and reminding\npassengers to wash their hands frequently and cover\ntheir noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing.\n"
