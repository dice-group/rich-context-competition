This study described the epidemiology\nof soccer injuries presenting to emergency departments (EDs) and compared injuries presenting to EDs to injuries\npresenting to collegiate and high school athletic trainers (ATs).\nMethods: Soccer-related injuries (product code 1267) in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) that\nwere sustained by individuals at least two years of age in 2004\u00ad2013 were included. High School Reporting Information\nfor those aged 18\u00ad22 years in 2009\u00ad2013. All datasets included weights to calculate national estimates.

Common diagnoses included sprains/strains (34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions\n(17.7%). Compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, sprains/strains comprised a larger proportion of injuries in HS\nConclusions: ATs more commonly reported injuries that are easily diagnosed and treated (e.g., sprains/strains); EDs more\ncommonly reported injuries with longer recovery times and rehabilitation (e.g., fractures). Although ED surveillance data can\nidentify the most severe sports-related injuries, high school and college sports surveillance may better describe the breadth\nof sports-related injuries.

With such large numbers of\nparticipants, the injury risk associated with playing soc-\ncer poses a public health concern. Previously published\nworks by US researchers evaluating population-based\ndata on soccer-related injuries have been mostly limited\nto youth populations or are over a decade old (Adams &\nexamination of the epidemiology of soccer injuries\nacross the lifespan using more recent data from varied\nclinical settings should help drive the development of\nage-appropriate interventions to reduce the incidence\nand severity of injury.\nOne intervention that may assist in mitigating the se-\nverity of injury is presence of a sports medicine clinician\nsuch as a physician or athletic trainer (AT). Although\nthe presence of an onsite sports medicine professional\nhas long been advocated, coverage at soccer activities\nvaries by level of play (American Medical Association\nSports Medicine Handbook advocates for all member in-\nstitutions to provide appropriate AT coverage across all\nsports and divisions (National Collegiate Athletic Asso-\nciation 2014). ATs are not required at the high school\nlevel and data suggest that even though 70% of high\nschools have access to some form of AT coverage, only\n55% of student-athletes have access to a full-time AT\n(Pryor et al. 2015). Having ATs available onsite: allows\nparticipants to have injuries immediately diagnosed,\ntreated, and managed; mitigates resulting injury sever-\nity; and reduces the need to present to emergency\ndepartments (EDs) or other healthcare facilities with\nThus, it should be expected that soccer injuries pre-\nsenting for treatment to ATs in the collegiate or high\nschool setting will differ from injuries presenting for\ntreatment in the ED setting.\nTo our knowledge, to date there have been no exami-\nnations of soccer-related injuries presenting to different\nclinical settings across the high school and collegiate age\nspan. One study compared the epidemiology of\nbasketball-related injuries presenting to EDs to those\nreported by ATs in a high school setting (Fletcher et al.\n2014), finding that EDs reported larger proportions of\nsevere injuries such as fractures than high schools. How-\never, the study did not consider additional levels of com-\npetition. This study builds on the findings of prior\nstudies by examining the epidemiology of soccer-related\ninjuries across the lifespan. First, we examined soccer-\nidentify epidemiologic trends and to develop targeted\nrecommendations to reduce risk of injury. Second, the\nED injury surveillance data from high school- and\ncollege-aged individuals was respectively compared to\ninjury surveillance data originating from the National\nHigh School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO)\nand the National Collegiate Athletic Association\n(NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program (ISP). The two ob-\njectives of this study were to 1) describe the epidemi-\nology of soccer injuries across the age span presenting to\nEDs and 2) compare the epidemiology of soccer injuries\npresenting to the ED to soccer injuries presenting to\ncollegiate and high school ATs.\nMethods\nData sources\nIn this study, soccer injury data from three large national\nsurveillance systems were evaluated. This study is ex-\nempt from human subjects review as it uses previously\ncollected data that were de-identified.\nNational electronic injury surveillance system\nED data were obtained from the US Consumer Product\nSafety Commission's (CPSC) National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System (NEISS), which has been previously\ndescribed in detail (US Consumer Product Safety\nCommission 2017). The NEISS data originates from a\nstratified probability sample of approximately 100 US\nhospitals with at least six beds and a 24-h ED. ED re-\ncords that were completed by various ED staff members\nwere reviewed daily with demographic, injury, and treat-\nment information logged into the NEISS database by a\ndesignated NEISS coordinator (a trained individual\ndesignated by the hospital that was either an ED staff\nmember or contracted by CPSC). Statistical weights pro-\nvided by CPSC enable generation of national estimates\nof the number of injuries treated in all EDs.\nThe sample includes data from soccer-related injuries\n(product code 1267) sustained by individuals at least\nof age as we believed that it would not be feasible for an\nindividual at that age to participate in soccer. Further,\nnarratives reviews were conducted for individuals aged\n2\u00ad4 years of age or over 50 years of age to exclude those\nclearly unassociated with playing soccer (e.g., being held\nby parent who was playing soccer; spectator hit by\nsoccer ball at grandchild's practice) resulted in 30 exclu-\nHS RIO, which has been previously described, is an\nInternet-based sport-related injury surveillance system\nthat has captured injury and exposure data from a sam-\nple of 100 nationally representative high schools since\nschools had one or more ATs with a valid email address.\nATs from participating high schools reported injury inci-\ndence and athlete exposure information weekly through-\nout each academic year using a secure website. For each\ninjury, ATs completed a detailed injury report on the in-\njured athlete (age, height, weight, etc.), the injury (site,\ndiagnosis, severity, etc.), and the injury event (activity,\nmechanism, etc.). ATs were able to view and update pre-\nviously submitted reports as needed with new informa-\ntion (e.g., time loss).\nA reportable injury in HS RIO was defined as an injury\nthat: (1) occurred as a result of participation in an orga-\nnized practice or competition; (2) required medical at-\ntention by an AT or physician; and (3) resulted in\nrestriction of the student-athlete's participation from\nsoccer for one or more days beyond the day of injury. In\nclude any concussion, fracture, or dental injury occur-\nring in an organized practice or game, regardless of\ntime loss. Only the principal injury was captured. Na-\ntional injury estimates are calculated from HS RIO\ninjury count data using a weighting algorithm based\non the inverse probability of participant schools' se-\nlection into the study (based on geographic location\nand school size).\nThe NCAA-ISP, which has been previously described in\ndetail, is an Internet-based surveillance system that de-\npends on a convenience sample of NCAA institutions\nwith ATs voluntarily reporting injury and exposure data\n(Kerr et al. 2014b). Participation in the NCAA-ISP, while\nvoluntary, is available to all NCAA institutions. For each\ninjury event, ATs completed a detailed event report on\nthe injury or condition (e.g., site, diagnosis) and the cir-\ncumstances [e.g., activity, mechanism, event type (i.e.,\ncompetition or practice)]. ATs were able to view and up-\ndate previously submitted information as needed during\nthe course of a season. In addition, ATs also provided\nthe number of student-athletes participating in each\npractice and competition. The data were stripped of any\nidentifiers and personally identifiable information (PII)\nretaining only relevant variables.\nDatalys Center introduced new components to the web--\nbased surveillance system to improve process flow; a\ncommon data element (CDE) standard was implemented\n(Kerr et al. 2014b). The CDE standard allows data to be\ngathered from various EMR/injury documentation appli-\ncations. The CDE export standard allowed ATs to docu-\nment injuries as they normally would as part of their\ndaily clinical practice, as opposed to asking them to re-\nport injuries solely for purposes of participation in an in-\njury surveillance program. Then, the de-identified and\nHIPAA-compliant data were sent to the Datalys Center\nwhere it was examined by data quality control staff and\na verification engine (VE) (Kerr et al. 2014b).\nA reportable injury in the NCAA-ISP was defined as\nan injury that: (1) occurred as a result of participation in\nan organized practice or competition; and (2) required\nmedical attention by a certified athletic trainer (AT) or\nphysician. The NCAA-ISP included all injuries regard-\nless of time loss, and multiple injuries that occurred\nfrom one injury event. To calculate national estimates of\nthe number of injuries, post-stratification sample\nweights, based upon sport, division, and academic year,\nwere applied to each reported injury and athlete-\nexposure. Post-stratification sample weights were calcu-\nlated using the formula:\nweightijk\n\u00bc\nNumber of ISS Schoolsijk\nNumber of Sponsoring Schoolsijk\nwhere weightijk is the weight for the ith sport of the jth\ndivision in the kth year. Weights were further adjusted to\ncorrect for underreporting, according to findings from\nKucera et al. (Kucera et al. 2011), which estimated that\nthe ISP captured 88.3% of all time-loss medical-care\ninjury events. Weighted counts were scaled up by a\nStudy variables\nVariables were coded so that all three surveillance sys-\ntems presented injury data in similar manners. Body\nparts injured were categorized as: Head/face, Neck,\nShoulder, Arm/elbow, Hand/wrist, Trunk, Thigh/upper\nleg, Knee, Lower leg, Ankle, Foot, and Other. Diagnoses\nwere categorized as: Concussion, Contusion, Dislocation,\nFracture, Laceration, Sprain/strain, and Other. The\nNEISS data was also categorized by disposition:\nReleased, Hospitalized, Fatality, and Other (including\ntransferred, left without being seen, not recorded, etc.).\nAge groups (in years) for NEISS data were categorized\nStatistical analyses\nData were analyzed with SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute,\nCary, NC). For NEISS data, we computed injury rates\noverall and by age and sex. Denominator data originated\nfrom intercensal population estimates provided by the\nUS Census Bureau (US Census Bureau. Population and\nHousing Unit Estimates 2017). Injury rates were pre-\nsented per 1000 US Census intercensal population esti-\nmate. Injury rates ratios (IRRs) compared rates by sex\nand age group. Trends for injury rates over time were\nanalyzed using linear regression. Injury proportion ratios\n(IPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-\nlated to compare injury proportions between age groups.\nThe following is an example of an IPR comparing the\nproportion of ankle injuries reported in females versus\nmales within the NEISS data.\nX\nankle injuries reported in females in NEISS data\nX\ntotal injuries reported in females in NEISS data\n!\nX\nankle injuries reported in males in NEISS data\nX\ntotal injuries reported in males in NEISS data\n!\nTo compare NEISS data to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP\ndata, we restricted NEISS injury data to those cases aged\ndistributions of body parts injured and diagnoses\nbetween the 14 and 17 year old NEISS cases and the HS\nRIO cases, and between the 18 and 22 year old NEISS\ncases and the NCAA-ISP cases.

Additionally, the national estimates\nfor injuries for high school student-athletes was larger\nthan that for NCAA student-athletes.\nFig. 1 Rates of soccer-related injuries treated in US emergency departments from 2004 to 2013 by sex and yeara. aNational estimates were calculated\nby applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to actual case\nDistributions of body parts injured and diagnoses\ndiffered between those presenting to EDs vs. school ATs\nyears old vs. NCAA-ISP; Table 3).

We found that the patterns of\nsoccer injuries not only differed across the age span, but\nFig. 2 Rates of soccer-related injuries treated in US emergency departments from 2004 to 2013 by age group and yeara. a National estimates were\ncalculated by applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to\nalso differed by clinical setting. Thus, our findings con-\ntribute important information that could be used to\ndrive the development of targeted, setting-specific injury\nprevention efforts.\nEpidemiology of soccer injuries across the Age span\npresenting to EDs\nOur findings paralleled those seen in previous research\n1998). A large proportion of soccer injuries presenting\nto EDs were to the lower extremity, although numerous\nwrist/hand injuries also presented. Common diagnoses\nincluded sprains/strains, fractures, and contusions. Rates\nand patterns of injury differed by age and sex, with\nmales having a higher rate of injury than females overall\nand the 14\u00ad17 year old age group having the highest\nrates of injuries compared to all other age groups. The\n14\u00ad17 year old age group also had the largest absolute\ninjury rate increase during the study period. This age\ngroup may have the highest rates of injury because par-\nacademic year alone (National Federation of High\nSchools 2013), continued increases in participation\nacross time (National Federation of High Schools 2013),\nand levels of play, quality of coaching, and safety of play-\ning facilities vary widely across high school, recreational,\ntravel, etc. leagues. However, we acknowledge the limita-\ntions of utilizing a rate denominator based on intercen-\nsal estimates (US Census Bureau. Population and\nHousing Unit Estimates 2017), as these undoubtedly in-\nclude individuals that do not participate in soccer activ-\nities. Availability of annual age- and sex-specific sports\nparticipation data are limited. Improving the quality and\navailability of such participation data would greatly\nbenefit future studies of population injury risk. Thus,\nTable 2 National estimates of soccer-related injuries treated in US emergency departments from 2004 to 2013 by age groupa\nAge, y\nVariable % % % % % % % % %\nBody Part\nDiagnosis\naNational estimates were calculated by applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System to actual case counts\nbIncludes internal injuries, injuries not recorded, etc\ncIncludes burns, ingesting foreign objects, unrecorded diagnoses, etc\nyouth sports governing bodies should be encouraged to\ntrack and make publicly available accurate participation\ndata. Such data are also important given the recent ban\non heading in youth players 10 years old by the United\nStates Soccer Federation (US Soccer 2015).\nSex differences\nPrevious literature utilizing HS RIO and NCAA-ISP data\nsuggest that in the school sports setting in many gender-\ncomparable sports, females consistently had higher in-\njury rates than males, overall and within certain injury\ntypes (e.g., concussions, ACL tears) (Hootman et al.\nuated in this study showed males consistently had higher\ninjury rates than females, overall and by age group. This\ncould reflect differences in the respective populations\npresenting to different clinical settings in regards to true\ninjury incidence or reporting. For example, males out-\nside of the high school setting may sustain soccer-\nrelated injuries at a higher rate than females. Or, males\nmay sustain more severe injuries than females and there-\nfore may more frequently present to emergency depart-\nments (Fletcher et al. 2014). However, research has also\nnoted that cultural differences may be associated with\ninjury reporting (Gessel et al. 2007). Females may be\nmore willing to disclose injuries and thus get immediate\ntreatment; males on the other hand may only report in-\njuries when they are more severe and require ED inter-\nvention. Our findings emphasize the need to continue\nexamining the biomechanical and behavioral effects that\nmay be associated with injury incidence and reporting\nacross all ages. Nonetheless, our findings may also be as-\nsociated with variations existing among data collection.\nFor example, HS RIO and NCAA-ISP only look at injury\nrates among actual participants in school-sanctioned\npractices and competitions, whereas our rates with\nNEISS data consider injury rates per population. Actual\nparticipation in soccer may vary by sex, which may have\nbiased NEISS-based injury rates.\nComparing the epidemiology of injuries presenting to the\nED to injuries presenting to collegiate and high school ATs\nUtilizing an ED data source such as NEISS provides\nopportunities to understand patterns of the most severe\ninjuries sustained by individuals participating in sports.\nHowever, many sports-related injuries present to and are\ntreated by sports medicine physicians and ATs when\nthey are present at sports practices and competitions\nthus reducing the number of individuals presenting to\nEDs. New opportunities now exist to understand the en-\ntire spectrum of sports-related injuries, rather than just\nthe most severe injuries that present to traditionally\nclinical settings, because the presence of sports injury\nsurveillance systems has increased, with focused efforts\nseen in numerous settings, including youth leagues\n(Dompier et al. 2015a), high school athletics (Centers for\nDompier et al. 2015b), college athletics (Kerr et al.\n(Loringer et al. 2008). However, the ED may provide the\neasiest access to injury data in settings lacking the pres-\nence of an AT or team sports physician. Although\nFig. 3 National estimate of soccer-related injury incidence for National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), High School Reporting\nInformation Online (HS RIO), and National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP), by month, 2004\u00ad2013a. NOTE:\nY-Axis for both scales differ. Data collection for HS RIO and NCAA-ISP occurred only during the school-sanctioned soccer seasons, so the lines are\nnot continuous. a National estimates were calculated by applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Products Safety Commisions's National\nElectronic Injury Surveillance System to actual case counts\nmethods of injury reporting vary, ranging from onsite ATs\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006; Rechel\nthe participants themselves (Swedler et al. 2015; Loringer\net al. 2008), a comprehensive evaluation of data from such\nsurveillance systems has the potential to better describe\nthe epidemiology of sports-related injury.\nIn this study, we used surveillance system data gath-\nered from EDs (NEISS) and ATs employed at high\nschools (HS RIO) and colleges (NCAA-ISP) to more\nfully examine patterns of soccer-related injuries. As seen\nin previous research with basketball (Fletcher et al.\n2014), injuries that were more likely to be easily diag-\nnosed and treated such as sprains/strains comprised a\nlarger proportion of injuries reported by ATs in the high\nschool and college settings. Meanwhile, injuries with\nmore complex diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation\nschedules, such as fractures, comprised a larger propor-\ntion of injuries presenting to EDs. However, sprains/\nstrains comprised the largest proportion of injuries in all\nthree settings. Findings slightly differed when NEISS\ndata were compared to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP; this\nmay be due to varying injury definitions used by both\nsurveillance systems. Because the NCAA-ISP also\nincluded injuries resulting in <24 h of time loss, it is pos-\nsible that a larger proportion of injuries that were less se-\nvere were in the dataset. This would explain the larger\nproportion of contusions and the smaller proportion of\nfractures in the NCAA-ISP dataset. Thus, as injury sur-\nveillance data are used, it is important to understand how\nthe inclusion/exclusion of certain injuries, based upon the\ndefinition used, may affect injury distributions.\nAs noted by Fletcher et al. (2014), EDs may be tasked\nwith dealing with non-urgent injuries, particularly when\nno sports medicine clinician is available (e.g., those high\nschools without AT coverage) (Pitts et al. 2008) and/or\nwhen those in attendance (e.g., coaches, referees, par-\nents) have little/no experience in injury management/\nTable 3 Proportions of body sites and diagnoses of soccer-related injuries treated in US emergency departments from 2004 to 2013\n(NEISS) and seen by athletic trainers in high school (HS RIO) and collegiate (NCAA-ISP) settingsa\nVariable n (%) n (%) IPR (95%CI)b n (%) n (%) IPR (95%CI)c\nBody Part\nDiagnosis\naNational estimates were calculated by applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System to actual case counts\nbCompares HS RIO to NEISS; * indicates 95%CI does not contain 1.00\ncCompares NCAA-ISP to NEISS; * indicates 95%CI does not contain 1.00\ndIncludes internal injuries, injuries not recorded, etc\neIncludes burns, ingesting foreign objects, unrecorded diagnoses, etc\ntreatment. Overcrowding may burden hospital resources\n(Trzeciak & Rivers 2003) and can be associated with\nhigher patient mortality (Richardson 2006). Because they\ntriage injuries and care for more minor injuries not re-\nquiring ED care, the presence of ATs mitigates the need\nfor some ED services among student-athletes within\nhigh school and college settings. However, it is estimated\nthat 30% of high schools lack access to ATs (Pryor et al.\n2015), and as a result, patterns of reported injuries may\ndiffer between schools with and without ATs meaning\nmany sports-related injuries that could be managed by\nschool ATs likely still present to EDs across the US. Fur-\nthermore, although it is advocated at the NCAA level\nthat all member institutions provide appropriate AT\ncoverage across all sports and divisions (National\nCollegiate Athletic Association 2014), variations have\nbeen found in the provision of aspects of sports injury\nmanagement, such as concussion baseline testing proto-\ncols (Kerr et al. 2015). It is possible that such variations\nbased upon sport and division extend beyond this and\nwould thus affect the care provided to athletes by\nmedical staff. Previous findings have suggested the bene-\nfits of having sports medicine professionals onsite\n2010) and are coupled with support from organizations\nsuch as the American Medical Association (1998). Our\nfindings may provide further support for school-based\nsports medicine professionals. However, because our study\ndid not examine additional metrics such as financial costs,\nmedical outcomes, etc., future research is warranted to de-\ntermine the potential benefits of on-site sports medicine\nprofessionals comprehensively.\nConcussions\nFemales presented to EDs with a larger proportion of\nconcussions than males. This finding follows previous\nresearch which has found higher rates and proportions\nof concussions among female soccer players than male\nSimilarly in previous HS RIO and NCAA-ISP research,\nthe reported concussion rate in female soccer players\nwas significantly higher than that of male soccer players\nfor the sex differences have been discussed in the litera-\nture, ranging from different styles of play (Gessel et al.\nMansell et al. 2005), particularly that compared to males,\nfemales may have smaller head-to-ball ratios, weaker\nnecks, or less total mass in their heads and necks. Previ-\nously (Collins et al. 2014), a study with high school\nstudents found that increased neck strength was associ-\nated with a decreased odds of concussion. Mechanisms\nof injury may also differ by sex, as high school data\nsuggests that compared to boys, concussions among girls\nwere more likely to occur due to contact with the play-\ning surface or ball while boys are more commonly in-\njured due to contact with another player (Marar et al.\n2012). Continued examination of these risk factors\nshould help drive efforts to reduce the concussion dis-\nparity between sexes while reducing overall incidence.\nConcussions comprised a smaller proportion of injuries\nin NEISS compared to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP. It is pos-\nsible that the larger proportions of concussions in the high\nschool and collegiate settings observed here represent in-\ncreased awareness via coaching and player education.\nBecause ATs are on-site, they may be able to provide im-\nmediate management and provide concussed athletes with\nresources and referrals to assist in proper return-to-play\n(and return-to-learning). This may reduce the presence of\nconcussions presenting to EDs. However, future research\nis warranted to further demonstrate the benefits of ATs,\nparticularly with concussion management.\nIn recent years, concussion rates have increased,\nsuggesting that the proportion of concussions being re-\nported is increasing as well (Rosenthal et al. 2014). Al-\nthough concussions go unreported at the high school\nand college settings (Kerr et al. 2014c), we are unaware\nof the proportion of concussions outside of these set-\ntings that go unreported. The difference in proportions\nof injuries that are concussions may be associated\nwith various settings for immediate concussion man-\nagement. Further, this difference may underscore the\nimportance of having sports medicine clinicians\npresent at practices and competitions, particularly to\nhelp identify symptomatology and remove suspected\nconcussed athletes from participation.\nLimitations\nAccurate national soccer participation data encompassing\nall levels of play is difficult to obtain. Furthermore, data\nthat does exist rarely includes participation in unorganized\nevents such as pick-up games. As a result, we utilized\nintercensal population estimates from the census which\nmay have resulted in either an underestimate or overesti-\nmate of the true rates of soccer-related injuries. The\ngeneralizability of our findings may be limited. Whereas\nNEISS captures all soccer-related injuries from all levels of\nplay, HS RIO and NCAA-ISP only capture events occur-\nring during school-sanctioned practices and competitions.\nVariations in medical presence at the high school and col-\nlege sport settings may have led to underreporting,\nalthough the NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook advo-\ncates AT coverage for all sports at its member institutions\n(National Collegiate Athletic Association 2014), and ap-\nproximately 70% of US high school athletic programs re-\nceive some level of AT coverage (Pryor et al. 2015).\nNEISS data included only those injuries that presented\nto EDs and may have excluded those that were or per-\nceived to be less severe in nature. The likelihood of pre-\nsenting to an ED may also be dependent on various\ndemographic- and injury-related factors. The NEISS cases\nwere selected on the basis of case narratives, some of\nwhich are not detailed and thus we may have included\nsome cases that did not actually occur during active soccer\nparticipation; case-by-case examinations were only per-\nformed at the extreme age ranges. The NEISS cases also\nlacked follow-up detail provided in HS RIO or NCAA-ISP,\nsuch as injury mechanism, symptomology, and severity.\nAdditionally, it is unknown if NEISS cases received treat-\nment from an AT prior to presenting to the ED. Although\nall three surveillance systems relied upon the expertise of\nmedical staff, all of whom were trained for data collection,\nit is still possible that there were variations in the report-\ning and diagnosis of injuries.\nLast, it is important to highlight that our analyses com-\nputed effect estimates that have been discussed by sports\ninjury epidemiologists in the context of their practicality\nFields 2010). The IRR and the IPR provide different types\nof comparisons. Whereas the IRR answers which of the\ntwo groups being compared had a higher incidence of in-\njury per unit of exposure, the IPR answers in which of the\ntwo groups being compared does a specific injury com-\nprise a greater percentage of all injuries (Comstock &\nFields 2010). As previously noted, the use of intercensal\npopulation estimates may have resulted in either an\nunderestimate or overestimate of the true rates of soccer-\nrelated injuries and may create invalid comparisons to HS\nRIO and NCAA-ISP data. Thus, when comparing NEISS\ndata to those of HS RIO and NCAA-ISP, we opted to use\nthe IPR. This metric has an important role in sports injury\nepidemiology and these comparisons still contribute to\nthe body of literature examining soccer-related injuries.\nHowever, it is important to understand the difference be-\ntween IRRs and IPRs, and as with any statistical analysis,\nbe cautious with interpretation.\nConclusions\nPatterns of soccer-related injuries presenting to EDs\nvaried by age and sex, with males and 14\u00ad17 year olds\nhaving the highest injury rates. In addition, patterns of\nsoccer-related injuries presenting to EDs and ATs in high\nschool and collegiate settings varied. Our findings may\nhighlight the importance of having an AT present at high\nschool and collegiate soccer competitions and practices.\nTheir presence can help capture injuries that otherwise\nmight have gone undiagnosed (i.e., concussions), and pro-\nvide treatment in the school setting, therefore preventing\nunnecessary and costly visits to the ED. However, further\nresearch is needed to comprehensively examine the\npotential economic- and health-related benefits of having\non-site sports medicine professionals.\nAbbreviations\nAT: Athletic trainer; CDE: Common data element; CI: Confidence interval;\nED: Emergency department; HS RIO: High School Reporting Information\nOnline; IPR: Injury proportion ratio; IRR: Injury rate ratio; NCAA: National\nCollegiate Athletic Association; NCAA-ISP: National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation Injury Surveillance Program; NEISS: National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System; NFHS: National Federation of State High School\nAssociations; US: United States\n"
