Defined as a per-\nson's involvement in life situations, participation is one of the three\nmain components in the World Health Organization's International\nClassification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (3). Up to\n52% of adults aged above 50 years have restrictions in participa-\ntion and this number increases with age (4). Importantly, participa-\ntion restrictions represent the broad impact of health on people's\nlives; a concept more meaningful to individuals than problems in\nperforming basic physical tasks and activities (5)--areas that have\ntraditionally been emphasized in both geriatric care and gerontologi-\ncal research.\nWithin the ICF framework, participation is described as result-\ning from the complex interaction between a health condition or\ndisease, body functions, and structures (anatomic and physiologic\nfunctioning of organs and body systems), activities (execution of\nactions by an individual), and personal and environmental factors\n(3). Examples of participation include involvement in home or com-\nmunity life such as taking care of the home or taking part in active\nrecreation, while the activity domain includes discrete physical tasks\nsuch as walking and getting up from a chair. The ICF thus provides\na useful framework for studying critical health outcomes and their\ndeterminants. Despite its recognized importance, gaps in evidence\non the determinants of participation hinder efforts for disability\nprevention among older adults. While medical, demographic, and\nsocioeconomic factors as well as some aspects of physical function\nhave been shown to be associated with participation in prior work\n(6\u00ad11), less attention has been paid to the physical impairments\nat the body functions and structures level that may influence par-\nticipation. This is important for informing evidence-based exercise\ninterventions targeting the impairments most critical for participa-\ntion in life roles among older adults. Although it is well established\nthat exercise-based interventions improve activity limitations, evi-\ndence that exercise can improve participation is mixed (12,13). In\npart, this may be due to the lack of understanding of the specific\nimpairments that underlie participation and can be targeted as part\nof interventions. To date, most exercise studies of older adults have\nemphasized leg strength and aerobic capacity (14,15); it is possible\nthat interventions targeting other physical impairments would have\ngreater effects.\nThe Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly\n(Boston RISE) is a prospective cohort study of older primary care\npatients with the specific aim of identifying the physical impairments\namenable to rehabilitation that are most relevant for activities and\nparticipation (16). The primary aim of this analysis of Boston RISE\nis to investigate the most important leg and trunk impairments that\npredict an older adult's subsequent level of participation at 2 years.\nThis information is critical for informing evidence-based exercise\ninterventions to enhance participation in life roles among older\nadults. In addition, although the ICF is widely accepted as a frame-\nwork for describing factors that influence the disablement process,\nlittle empirical evidence exists confirming the pathways between\nimpairments, activities, and participation. Prior work has shown\nthat both impairments and activities affect participation; however,\nthe limited work evaluating the interplay among these constructs\nsuggests that the main influence of impairments is through an inter-\nmediary effect on activities which in turn, has a direct impact on\nparticipation (8,17). Therefore, our secondary aim is to determine\nwhether changes in activities mediate the impact of leg and trunk\nimpairments on participation over 2 years. Our structural model\nof disability tested the following hypotheses: (i) baseline leg and\ntrunk impairments will be identified that predict participation at\nyear 2, both directly and indirectly through changes in activities and\n(ii) there is a direct relationship between changes in activities over\n2 years and participation at year 2. A conceptual model illustrating\nthese relationships is provided in Figure 1.\nMethods\nDesign and Participants\nWe analyzed 2 years of follow-up data from Boston RISE, a cohort\nstudy of 430 older adults. The study was approved by the relevant\nInstitutional Review Boards and all participants provided written\ninformed consent. Details of the methods have been described previ-\nously (16). Briefly, primary care patients in the Greater Boston Area\nwho met the following criteria were recruited: age 65 years, abil-\nity to communicate in English, self-reported difficulty or task modi-\nfication walking \u00bd mile and/or climbing stairs, no planned major\nsurgery, and expectation of remaining in the area. Exclusion crite-\nria comprised: significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hyper-\ntension, lower-extremity amputation, use of supplemental oxygen,\nmyocardial infarction or major surgery in the previous 6 months,\nMini-Mental State Exam score <18 and Short Physical Performance\nBattery (SPPB) score <4. Baseline assessments were conducted dur-\ning an initial screening visit and a subsequent visit within 2 weeks.\nFollow-up assessments were conducted at 12 and 24 months.\nMeasures\nPhysical Impairments\nFive categories of physical impairments were evaluated in Boston\nRISE: strength, speed of movement, range of motion (ROM), asym-\nmetry, and trunk stability. This analysis focused on the following\nFigure 1. Conceptual model for the hypothesized relationships between physical impairments, activities, and participation.The solid arrow represents the direct\neffect of the impairment on participation and the dotted arrow represents the indirect effect mediated by activities.\nleg and trunk impairments selected from each category based on\ntheir association with mobility activities shown previously (18): leg\nstrength, leg speed, knee flexion ROM, ankle ROM, leg strength\nasymmetry, kyphosis, and trunk extensor endurance.\nParticipants underwent physical impairment testing during the\nsecond baseline visit; all measures were collected by a trained assessor\nusing a standardized protocol.Assessment sessions lasted 2 hours and\nparticipants were permitted to rest as needed. Leg strength was the\nmaximum value obtained from either leg using a 1-repetition maxi-\nmum test on a Keiser A420 pneumatic leg press machine. Leg speed\nwas calculated by dividing peak leg press power by the concurrently\nrecorded force obtained from a single leg press repetition pushing\nout as quickly as possible (18). Knee and ankle ROM were measured\nwith a goniometer. Ankle ROM was defined as intact or impaired\nbased on dorsiflexion less than 90\u00b0 or plantarflexion less than 20\u00b0.\nStrength asymmetry was calculated by dividing the higher leg strength\nvalue from the two sides by the lower strength value. Trunk extensor\nendurance was assessed by recording the time a participant was able\nto maintain a neutral trunk position with their lower body supported\non a specialized plinth leaning forward at a 45\u00b0 angle (19). Kyphosis\nwas measured using a validated flexible ruler technique (20).\nActivities\nActivities were assessed using the advanced lower-extremity scale\nof the Late-Life Function Instrument (LLFI) (21). The LLFI assesses\na broad range of activity limitations, consistent with the ICF model.\nParticipants are asked to report their current degree of difficulty in\nperforming 32 physical activities on a typical day without the help of\nsomeone else and without the use of assistive devices. Response options\ninclude: none, a little, some, quite a lot, and cannot do. The advanced\nlower-extremity function scale includes activities involving a significant\ndegree of physical ability and endurance such as walking several blocks\nand climbing a flight of stairs without a handrail.The scale is calibrated\nfunction. Evidence supports the validity, reliability, and responsiveness\nof the LLFI in community-dwelling older adults (21\u00ad23).\nThe SPPB (24) was used as a secondary measure of activity in\norder to identify any additional physical impairments that might\naffect participation through a performance-based test of basic lower-\nextremity mobility.\nParticipation\nParticipation was assessed with the Late-Life Disability Instrument\n(LLDI) that measures both frequency of participation in 16 major\nlife tasks and limitations in capability to perform each task consistent\nwith the ICF model (25). Frequency dimension questions ask, \"How\noften do you\" do a specific task while limitation dimension ques-\ntions ask \"To what extent do you feel limited\" in doing the task.\nQuestionnaire items encompass a wide variety of participation tasks\nincluding: personal care; mobility and travel; exchange of informa-\ntion; social, community, and civic activities; home life; paid or vol-\nunteer work; and involvement in economic activities. Raw scores for\neach dimension are transformed to scaled scores from 0 to 100 with\nhigher scores indicating a greater level of participation. The LLDI has\nstrong construct validity and reliability, and is predictive of poor self-\nrated health, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits (23,25,26).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used structural equation modeling based on latent growth curve\nanalysis to determine the baseline leg and trunk impairments that\npredicted participation directly at year 2, and indirectly through\ntheir effect on changes in activities (Figure 1). Two-step procedures\nwere used to build the models. First, we used the unconditional latent\ngrowth model to describe the change in activity across the three time-\npoints (baseline, year 1, and year 2). Second, we used a series of media-\ntion models to examine whether change in activities would mediate\nthe impact of the physical impairment on participation. To facilitate\ninterpretation, the impairments were dichotomized using the median\nas the cut-point; this approach also yielded the best model fit. Results\nare presented in terms of performance on the physical impairment\ntest above the median (ie, less impairment). For each physical impair-\nment, the mediation effect was calculated as the product of the impact\nof that impairment on change in activities and the impact of change\nin activities on the participation outcome. Based on 5,000 bootstrap\nsamples, the bias-corrected confidence interval was used to determine\nthe statistical significance of the mediation effect. A mediation (indi-\nrect) effect was established if the 95% confidence interval did not\ninclude 0, indicating that change in activity mediates the impact of the\nimpairment on participation. Models were adjusted for age, gender,\nand baseline level of participation. An effect size (ES) estimate for the\nimpairments that predicted participation was calculated as ES = /SD;\nwhere  is the direct/indirect coefficient for the impairment and SD is\nthe standard deviation of the participation score at year 2. As a sensi-\ntivity analysis to examine the effect of missing data for the entire sam-\nple (n = 430), we applied two-stage maximum likelihood estimation\n(27): in the first stage, we estimated the saturated mean and covariance\nmatrix of the observed variables based on the expectation\u00admaximiza-\ntion algorithm. In the second stage, the mediation model parameters\nwere estimated based on the saturated mean and covariance matrix\ngenerated from the first stage; the bias-corrected bootstrap method\nwas used to create the confidence intervals (CIs) (28).\nOverall model fit was examined using the chi-square test (non-\nsignificant p value indicates good model fit), comparative fit index\n(CFI) and Tucker Lewis index (TLI) (values >0.95 indicate accept-\nable fit), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA;\nvalues <0.05 indicate good model fit). Maximum likelihood estima-\ntion implemented in MPlus was used in the analysis.\nResults\nParticipants' baseline characteristics and values for the leg and trunk\nimpairments are provided in Table 1. Demographics were consistent\nwith census data for older adults living in the recruitment area. At\nbaseline, 430 Boston RISE participants had a mean age of 76.6 years,\nremained in the study; 15 were deceased, 17 withdrew due to medical\nreasons and 32 withdrew due to non-health reasons or were lost to\nfollow-up. Over 2 years, the mean change in activities measured by the\n\u00b1\n10.26 points; the mean change in SPPB score was\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nThe direct and indirect effect coefficients and 95% CI for the leg\nand trunk impairments that predicted frequency of and limitations\nin participation are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Positive\ncoefficients indicate a positive relationship between the physical\nimpairment and subsequent participation; that is, better scores on\nthe physical impairment tests predict higher participation in life\nroles. Specifically, the interpretation of  is the expected change in\nparticipation score associated with baseline performance above the\nmedian on the physical impairment test when holding all other model\nparameters constant. Both the participation frequency and limitation\nmodels met criteria for good model fit. For participation frequency\nParticipation Frequency Model\nChange in activities measured with the LLFI had a significant\ndirect effect on frequency of participation in life roles (standardized\n = 2.19). Leg speed was the only physical impairment that had a\ndirect effect on frequency of participation at year 2 (direct = 1.39,\nand trunk extensor endurance (indirect = 1.01, ES = 0.16) had indi-\nrect effects on frequency of participation acting though changes in\nactivities.\nParticipation Limitation Model\nChange in activities measured with the LLFI had a significant direct\neffect on limitations in participation in life roles (standardized\n(direct 4.70, ES = 0.34) both had a direct effect on limitations in\nand trunk extensor endurance (indirect = 4.18, ES = 0.30) had indi-\nrect effects on limitations in participation acting though changes in\nactivities.\nModels Using SPPB\nIn the models in which the LLFI was replaced with the SPPB for the\nactivity measure, trunk extensor endurance had a significant indirect\nin participation mediated by changes in the SPPB. No other physical\nimpairments contributed to participation acting through the SPPB.\nChange in the SPPB had a direct effect on limitations in participa-\nfrequency.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn the models using maximum likelihood estimation for missing\ndata, the same physical impairments predicted participation fre-\nquency and limitations, with the exception of ankle ROM, which\ndid not predict either dimension of participation.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the specific leg\nand trunk impairments amenable to treatment that are most predic-\ntive of an older person's participation in major life roles. Our results\nidentified leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk extensor endurance as\nkey physical impairments predicting participation levels both directly\nand indirectly through changes in activities over 2 years of follow-\nup. In addition, these results validate a clinically relevant model of\ndisablement with implications for late-life disability prevention.\nFurther understanding of the factors underlying the disablement\nprocess has been highlighted as a key research priority in geriatric\nrehabilitation (29). Despite widespread acceptance of the ICF as a\nframework for studying health and disability, there is scarce empiri-\ncal evidence confirming the associations between impairments,\nTable 1.

Our results support the hypotheses\nproposed in our conceptual model (Figure 1) and demonstrate that\nleg and trunk impairments have both a direct and indirect influence\non subsequent participation in life roles acting through changes in\nactivities. These data add to previous work on the disablement pro-\ncess (8,17) and provide a framework through which interventions to\nenhance participation can be identified. This is particularly impor-\ntant given the limited evidence demonstrating that exercise has a\nbeneficial impact on participation in life roles (12,13,30).\nA recent statement from the Australian and New Zealand Society\nfor Geriatric Medicine (31) emphasized the need for research to\ndetermine the most effective types of exercise to optimize outcomes\nin older adults. There are two major trials to date showing that\nexercise in older adults can prevent or delay the onset of limitations\nin activities of daily living (15) and walking ability (14), respec-\ntively: the Fitness Arthritis and Seniors Trial (15) and the Lifestyle\nInterventions and Independence for Elders Study (14). Common\nto both studies is exercise focusing primarily on improving aero-\nbic capacity and muscle strength. The current analysis from Boston\nRISE makes two important contributions that have the potential to\ninform future exercise trials: (i) we consider a comprehensive set of\nleg and trunk impairments linked to mobility status and (ii) we iden-\ntify their impact on participation in life roles- a broader disability\noutcome of significance to individuals (5). Our results suggest that if\nthe goal is to have an impact on participation, leg speed, ankle ROM,\nand trunk endurance are specific physical impairments that could be\ntargeted to maximize the benefits of exercise for older adults.\nIt is interesting to note that leg speed had a direct effect on both\nfrequency of participation in life roles and perceived limitations in\nparticipation. There is increasing literature documenting the impor-\ntance of leg speed as a predictor of walking ability and other activity\noutcomes (32\u00ad35); however, ours is the first study to demonstrate its\nprospective association with participation, a global disability out-\ncome. Given that leg speed was directly associated with participa-\ntion, exercises aimed at increasing the speed generating capacity of\nthe muscle (eg, repeated chair-stands where the patient is asked to\nstand up as quickly as possible) might have a positive impact on\nparticipation in life roles. While there is preliminary evidence dem-\nonstrating the potential of task-specific training emphasizing speed\nof movement for improving activity limitations (36), there is a need\nto evaluate exercise directly targeting this attribute as part of inter-\nventions designed to enhance participation in older adults.\nTrunk extensor endurance had a consistent indirect effect on\nsubsequent participation in life roles acting through changes in\nself-reported activities. It was also the only neuromuscular attrib-\nute to have an effect on participation acting through changes in a\nperformance-based measure of activity (the SPPB). A hypothesized\nmechanism through which trunk endurance may influence participa-\ntion is through its association with balance (34)--a complex skill\nrequired for daily living to avoid falls. Trunk endurance is likely\ncritical for supporting activities requiring a higher degree of balance\ncontrol which in turn, may have a significant impact on participation\nin life roles. This theory is supported by a recent meta-analysis which\nfound that exercise interventions designed to reduce falls--many of\nwhich included balance exercises challenging trunk stability--had a\nsmall effect on participation in life roles (12). Regardless of the spe-\ncific mechanism, our results suggest that activity-specific functional\ntraining with an emphasis on tasks that require trunk endurance\nmight have a positive impact on participation.\nAlthough the direct effect of ankle ROM on participation was\npositive, its indirect effect mediated by changes in activity was nega-\ntive. This is a reflection of the negative association between baseline\nankle ROM and change in activities; those with impaired ankle ROM\nat baseline showed greater improvement in activities over 2 years\nthan those with intact ROM. These patients may have had more\nroom to improve and possibly underwent rehabilitation. Further\nresearch is necessary to confirm this theory; however, the positive\ndirect effect on participation limitation nevertheless highlights ankle\nROM as another understudied target for geriatric research.\nA unique strength of our analysis is that we evaluated two key\ndimensions of participation: frequency of and limitations in partici-\npation in major life roles. Although leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk\nendurance had modest effects on both participation dimensions, the\nmagnitude of their effect was greatest on limitations in participa-\ntion. Of note, changes in advanced lower-extremity activities had\nan almost fourfold greater influence on limitations in participation\nthan on frequency of participation. In addition, the SPPB, reflecting\na more basic measure of activity, had no effect on participation fre-\nquency. These results extend prior work which showed differences\nin the responsiveness and predictive value of the LLDI limitation\nand frequency dimensions in older adults (26), and point to the need\nfor further understanding of the myriad of other potential factors\nthat might underlie the different dimensions of participation (11).\nThis is particularly important for frequency of participation given\nits association with adverse outcomes such as hospitalizations and\nemergency room visits (26) and its tendency to show less improve-\nment following interventions (23).\nA limitation of this study is that our findings may not be gen-\neralizable to primary care patients living outside the Boston area.\nHowever, the participation scores in Boston RISE are similar to\nthose of the LLDI development study (25), which included a more\ngeneral sample of community-dwelling older adults. A small propor-\ntion of participants were unable to complete all the baseline impair-\nment tests and, although loss to follow-up was low (16%), there\nTable 3.

Our sen-\nsitivity analysis using two-stage maximum likelihood estimation to\naccount for both missing data and attrition suggested this had little\nimpact on our findings, with the exception of ankle ROM, which\nwas not retained as a predictor of participation. This finding along\nwith our observation of a negative indirect effect of ankle ROM on\nparticipation warrant further investigation. Although patients with\nsevere cognitive impairment were excluded from Boston RISE, it\nis unclear the extent to which error may have been introduced in\nthe self-report measures by those with milder cognitive impairment.\nFinally, the Boston RISE study did not include a direct measure of\naerobic capacity or a comprehensive evaluation of upper extremity\nimpairments; further research is required to evaluate their impact\non participation.\nIn summary, our results demonstrating the relationships between\ntrunk and lower-extremity physical impairments, activities, and par-\nticipation validate a conceptual model of disability in older adults\nthat highlights opportunities for geriatric research and practice. In\nparticular, we have shown that leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk\nextensor endurance have direct and indirect effects on participa-\ntion--a key component of health. Investigation of interventions\nfor enhancing participation in life roles among older adults should\ninclude task-specific exercise emphasizing trunk stability and train-\ning directly targeting leg speed and ankle ROM.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (R01\nM.K.B.); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health\nthe National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research\nReferences\n1.
