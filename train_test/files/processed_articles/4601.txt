    "abstract": "Abstract\nTen years ago, Buss and Shackelford demonstrated that high mate value (i.e., physically attractive) women held more discerning\nmate preferences relative to lower mate value women. Since then, researchers have begun to consider the equally important role\nof men's sexual selectivity in human mate choice. Yet, little research has focused on whether high mate value men are similarly\nchoosy in their mate preferences. In a sample of 139 undergraduate men, relationships between self-perceived mate value as well\nas female-rated facial attractiveness were examined in relation to men's expressed mate preferences. Results showed that self-\nperceived mate value was unrelated to men's facial attractiveness as rated by women. Men who believed they were of high mate\nvalue were more likely than lower mate value men to prefer to marry at a younger age; to have a spouse who was younger than\nthem; and to have a partner who was sociable, ambitious, high in social status, with good financial prospects, a desire for children,\nhealth, good looks, and mutual attraction. Objective male facial attractiveness was generally unrelated to heightened mate\npreferences, with the exception of heightened preference for similar religious background and good physical health. Findings\nsuggest that men who perceive themselves as high in overall mate value are selective in their mate choice in a manner similar to\nhigh mate value women.\n",

Individuals' mate value, or the extent to which\nthey exhibit the qualities desired in a mate by the opposite sex,\nmay be one such factor relevant to individuals' mating deci-\nsions. Indeed, some researchers have argued that psychological\nmechanisms, such as the tendency to make social comparisons\n(i.e., to compare oneself to [often same sex] others on impor-\ntant characteristics) and self-esteem (ostensibly a gauge of\nwhere one stands on important mate value characteristics;\nBrase & Guy, 2004), may have been selected for in part\nbecause they allow for the assessment of one's own relative\nmate value. In turn, one's relative mate value would then guide\nthe use of specific mating strategies or tactics in a variety of\nways. For example, women who perceive themselves to be of\nlower mate value (e.g., less physically attractive) relative to\nintrasexual rivals have been found to hold more positive\nattitudes toward enhancing their own physical appearance,\neven if it entails health risk (Arnocky, Perilloux, Cloud, Bird,\nromantic jealousy, and to engage in more aggression toward\nboth other women and romantic partners (Arnocky, Sunderani,\nBuss and Shackelford (2008) suggested that mate value is\none important individual difference factor that should also\nguide women's mate preferences.

However, Buss and Shackelford (2008) rea-\nsoned that due to assortative mating (10's tendency to mate\nwith 10's and 5's tendency to mate with 5's), some particularly\nhigh mate value women ought to be able to attract men who\nexhibit both good-gene and good investment/parenting charac-\nteristics. Women's physical attractiveness, derived from face\nand body ratings made by interviewers, is an important com-\nponent of female mate value (Li, Kenrick, Bailey, & Linsen-\nmeier, 2002). In the Buss and Shackelford study, attractiveness\nwas positively correlated with heightened mate preferences\nacross multiple domains, including good-gene indicators such\nas preferring a more masculinized, sexy, and physically fit\nman; investment ability indicators including having good earn-\ning potential, having a college education, and being older; and\ngood parenting indicators such as desire for home and children,\nfondness for children, and emotional stability. Attractiveness\nwas also related to the good partner indicator of being loving.\nSimilarly, Wincenciak and colleagues (2015) showed that\nwomen with healthier looking faces showed stronger concor-\ndance between their preference for men's healthy-looking\nfaces and their actual romantic partner's rated facial health; a\npattern that was not observed among men. This finding sug-\ngests that high mate value women (but perhaps not men) might\nnot only hold more discerning mate preferences (i.e., such as\nfor healthy male faces) but might also be better able to express\nthose mate preferences in their actual mating relations (i.e.,\nactually having a mate with a healthier looking face) relative\nto lower mate value women.\nImportantly, the role of one's own mate value in guiding\nmating-relevant behavior is not limited to women. Bird, Carr\u00b4\ne,\nKnack, and Arnocky (2016) primed men with either low or high\nself-perceived mate value using a bogus online-dating task that\npurported to analyze facial attractiveness in conjunction with\nself-reported mate value traits (e.g., income, education, person-\nality, and social status). In two studies, men primed with low\nmate value were subsequently more willing to aggressively\nguard their partner from an attractive mate poacher (Study 1)\nand to engage in more in vivo aggression against a same-sex\nrival (Study 2). In another priming study, Yong and Li (2012)\nexposed males and females to either large quantities of either\nmoney or paper, and subsequently examined their mate prefer-\nences. Results showed that men, but not women, exhibited more\ndiscerning preferences for a date when handling a large sum of\nmoney. To the extent that monetary resource availability may\nserve as one index of a male's mate value, it is hypothesized that\nmen's mate value should also influence their mate preferences.\nShould We Expect Men to Be Choosy?\nMammalian mate choice is widely considered to revolve\naround female selectivity coupled with male competition for\nthose choosy females. However, recent theoretical reformula-\ntions have highlighted the important roles of both male selec-\ntivity and of female intrasexual competition for mates. This is\nparticularly relevant to human mate choice, which is somewhat\nunique among sexually reproducing species in that humans\nnormally mate with some degree of monogamy and males often\nprovide substantial parental investment of resources and care\ntoward offspring at a cost of total reproductive effort directed\ntoward accessing additional mates. Such \"long-term\" mating\nstrategies compel males to be more selective in their mate\nchoice and females to compete intrasexually for access to the\nmost desirable males (see Arnocky & Vaillancourt, 2017, for\nreview). Unsurprisingly then, research has demonstrated that\nmen's mate preferences differ when considering a long-term\nversus short-term partner. For example, Regan, Levin, Spre-\ncher, Christopher, and Gate (2000) found that whereas both\nmen and women focused on sexual desirability (e.g., attractive-\nness, health, sex drive, and athleticism) when evaluating a\nshort-term sexual partner (see also Confer, Perilloux, & Buss,\n2010), both sexes were more likely to emphasize characteris-\ntics such as similarity and socially appealing personality when\nconsidering long-term mate preferences. Nevertheless, to date,\nlittle research has examined whether men's own mate value\nmight correlate positively with their long-term mate prefer-\nences in a manner similar to what has been observed in women.\nAre High Mate Value Men Choosy?\nThere is some evidence that men who perceive themselves to\nbe high in mate value (or traits associated with mate value) are\nmore selective with respect to desired traits in their long-term\npartners relative to men who view themselves as lower in mate\npants rate the importance of 10 attributes (across the categories\nof wealth and status, family commitment, physical appearance,\nand sexual fidelity) in a long-term partner. The participants also\nrated themselves on those same attributes. The authors found\nevidence of homophily between self-ratings and partner pre-\nferences across the categories, such that both women and men\nwho rated themselves higher across these traits were more\nlikely to prefer a partner who was also high on those same\ntraits.\nSimilarly, Edlund and Sagarin (2010) found that in an\nunbudgeted mate-preference task, high self-perceived mate\nvalue corresponded with more discriminating mate preferences\nin a sample of men and women. However, this effect was\nobserved only when using a single-item measure of mate value.\nUsing a more comprehensive measure (a five-factor mate value\ninventory tapping various dimensions of mate value) revealed\nthat only one of the five factors (status) related meaningfully to\nholding more discerning mate preferences averaged across 13\ntraits such as creativity, kindness, intelligence, physical attrac-\ntiveness, humor, and income. Moreover, imposition of a mating\n\"budget\" largely eliminated these links. However, the rele-\nvance of such an artificial budget in and of itself appears con-\ntradictory to the hypothesis being tested, given that (1) in real-\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nworld mating scenarios not everyone is subject to the same\nmating \"budget,\" in that (2) one's own mate value would pre-\nsumably affect the type of mate one can \"afford,\" such that high\nmate value individuals can likely obtain a mate with more\noverall desirable characteristics. More importantly, the Edlund\nand Sagarin (2010) study also involved a relatively small sam-\nple of 59 men, with another 20 participants being dropped from\nthe analyses for various reasons (the number of those who were\nmen was not reported). Whereas Buss and Shackelford (2008)\nexamined a potentially more objective (other-rated) index of\nmate value, both the Buston and Emlin (2003) and Edlund and\nSagarin (2010) studies relied solely on self-perceived own mate\nvalue.\nThe Present Study\nThe goal of the present study was to build upon these earlier\nfindings by examining whether men's objective (other-rated)\nfacial attractiveness (following Buss & Shackelford, 2008, and\nWincenciak et al., 2015) or their self-perceived total mate value\n(following Edlund & Sagarin, 2010) correspond with heigh-\ntened unbudgeted mate preferences in a sample of young men.\nFacial attractiveness ratings were used as an index of men's\nphysical attractiveness because this variable (along with body\nand total attractiveness ratings) reliably predicted women's\nmate preferences in the Buss and Shackelford (2008) study.\nAlthough research has shown that women are willing to\ntrade-off men's attractiveness for resources in the context of\nlong-term mating, women are not averse to forming long-term\nrelationships with attractive men (Waynforth, 2000) and will\nprefer to mate with attractive men if they are themselves of\nhigh mate value (Buss & Shackelford, 2008).\nPrevious work has shown concordance between men's facial\nattractiveness and other physical markers of mate value, such\nas vocal attractiveness as judged by female adults and adoles-\ncents, but not by female children (Saxton, Carlyle, & Roberts,\nresults suggest that men's facial attractiveness is a mate value\ntrait detectable by, and particularly relevant to, reproductive-\naged women. Moreover, Jokela (2009) has demonstrated that\nmen's facial attractiveness (from yearbook photos) related to\nreproductive success such that men with low facial attractive-\nness were less likely to be married and had fewer children than\nmore attractive men. Similarly, Prokop and Fedor (2011) found\nthat in a sample of Slovakian men, facial attractiveness pre-\ndicted likelihood of being married (i.e., being selected for long-\nterm mating) and in turn, married men had higher reproductive\nsuccess. Even when controlling for marriage status, facially\nattractive men had higher reproductive success. Rhodes, Sim-\nmons, and Peters (2005) found that men's facial attractiveness\nalso predicted having more short-term sex partners than men\nwith less attractive faces, suggesting that men's facial attrac-\ntiveness may be one important biological indicator of men's\nmate value that impacts female mate choice. Following Buston\nassessed self-perceived mate value across multiple dimensions\nto address the possibility that self-perceived mate value may be\nmore important than one singular physical indicator of actual\nmate value in driving our mate preferences. Both female-rated\nfacial attractiveness and self-perceived mate value were exam-\nined in relation to 21 mate preferences derived from Buss\n(1989) which have been shown cross-culturally to serve as\nuniversal dimensions of long-term mate preference across cate-\ngories of love versus status/resources, dependable/stable versus\ngood looks/health, education/intelligence versus desire for\nhome/children, and sociability versus similar religion (Shack-\nelford, Schmitt, & Buss, 2005). It was hypothesized that both\nself-perceived mate value (Hypothesis 1) and female-rated\nfacial attractiveness (Hypothesis 2) would each correlate posi-\ntively with increased mate preferences across desirable partner\ncharacteristics, examined both individually and as an average\nmate-preference score. The potential influence of current rela-\ntionship status upon these relationships was also examined.\nMethod\nParticipants\nAs part of a larger study on male and female mating psychol-\nogy (see Davis, Dufort, Desrochers, Vaillancourt, & Arnocky,\nSD \u00bc 2.37) were recruited from a university and college in\nNorthern Ontario using the campus online research participa-\ntion system and recruitment stations in common areas. Partici-\npants were primarily Caucasian (93.5%), followed by Black\n(2%), Asian (1.5%), Arab, South Asian, Native/Aboriginal, and\nLatin American (<1% each). Men currently in romantic rela-\ntionships constituted 49% of the sample.\nMaterials and Procedure\nParticipants were led to a private and quiet testing room where\nthey completed a counterbalanced survey package (paper and\npencil) as part of a larger study on mating behavior. Following\ncompletion of the study, participants were debriefed and were\nremunerated with partial course credit or CAN$5.\nSelf-perceived mate value. Self-perceived mate value was\nassessed using the Components of Mate Value Survey (CMVS;\nFisher, Cox, Bennett, & Gavric, 2008). The measure consists of\n22 items with response options ranging along a 7-point Likert-\ntype scale. The CMVS incorporates items from a diverse set of\nmate value dimensions including sociality (e.g., \"I run into\nfriends wherever I go\"), how the respondent is viewed by\nmembers of the opposite sex (e.g., \"Members of the opposite\nsex are attracted to me\"), parenting (e.g., \"I would make a good\nparent\"), wealth (e.g., \"I want people to think that I am\nwealthy\"), physical attractiveness (e.g., \"I would like members\nof the opposite sex to consider me sexy\"), relationship history\n(e.g., \"After I date someone they often want to date me again\"),\nand fear of romantic failure (\"I often worry about not having a\ndate\"). In the present study, the measure showed good internal\nconsistency (a \u00bc .85).\nFacial attractiveness. Facial photographs were taken using a 16\nmegapixel Nikon Cool Pix L830 digital camera using standar-\ndized distance and lighting and against a neutral backdrop. The\nphotos were then rated on physical attractiveness using a 10-\npoint Likert-type scale (1 \u00bc very unattractive, 10 \u00bc very\nattractive) by five undergraduate women who were naive to\nthe goal of the study. The five raters demonstrated acceptable\nagreement in their ratings (a \u00bc .73).\nMate preferences. Participants completed the measure of factors\ninvolved in choosing a mate (Buss, 1989). Specifically, parti-\ncipants completed 3 items in which they indicated \"At what age\nwould you prefer to marry?\" \"What age difference would you\nprefer between you and your spouse?\" and \"Whom would you\nprefer to be older (self or spouse).\" For the first 2 items, the age\nresponse was treated as a continuous variable, and the age\npreference item (self or spouse) was coded as follows: 1 \u00bc\npreferring self to be older than spouse and 2 \u00bc preferring\nspouse to be older than self. Participants then rated 18 partner\ntraits on a 4-point Likert-type scale coded as follows: 0 \u00bc\nirrelevant or unimportant; 1 \u00bc desirable, but not very impor-\ntant; 2 \u00bc important, but not indispensable; and 3 \u00bc indispen-\nsable, give it. Each item was treated and examined\nindependently as a unique trait or characteristic found in a\nmate. The 18 mate-preference traits were also averaged to cre-\nate a total mate-preference score which demonstrated accepta-\nble reliability in their ratings (a \u00bc .68).\nResults\nFirst, the potential influence of relationship status upon study\nvariables was examined using a series of independent-samples t\ntests. Results showed that men currently in relationships pre-\nferred to marry approximately 2 years younger (M \u00bc 27.7,\nSD \u00bc 7.19) than men who were not in relationships (M \u00bc\nferred less of an age difference between them and their partner\n.027, d \u00bc .40. Men in relationships also preferred partners with\nrelative to men who were not in relationships (M \u00bc 1.77, SD \u00bc\ndesired chastity in a partner (M \u00bc 0.64, SD \u00bc 0.84) relative to\nhad less desire for a partner high in social status (M \u00bc 1.06,\nGiven that current relationship status related to some of the\nmate preferences described above, the relationship between\nmate value indices (self-report and rated facial attractiveness)\nwere examined both with and without controlling for relation-\nship status. Controlling for relationship status did not yield any\nmeaningful differences in the findings; therefore, following\nBuss and Shackelford (2008), only the bivariate relationships\nare presented. This yielded a comparison of 21 mate prefer-\nences in relation to two indices of men's mate value (i.e., 42\nplanned comparisons). Accordingly, multiple comparisons\nwere corrected for using the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)\nprocedure with the critical value for a false discovery rate set at\n0.15. This procedure did not alter the interpretation of conven-\ntional p values of less than .05 being interpreted as statistically\nsignificant. Thus, for ease of interpretation the uncorrected p\nvalues are reported herein.\nResults showed that objective (female-rated) facial attrac-\ntiveness was unrelated to men's overall perception of their total\nself-perceived mate value, r \u00bc \u00c0.03, p \u00bc .76, nor did it relate to\nCMVS subscales of men's own ratings of how good-looking\nthey were, r \u00bc .04, p \u00bc .63, or how attractive they were to the\nopposite sex, r \u00bc \u00c0.05, p \u00bc .57, suggesting that the female\nfacial ratings provided unique information about the partici-\npants' attractiveness that was potentially distinct from men's\nown self-perceptions. Table 1 provides bivariate correlations\nbetween the measures of mate value and men's mate\npreferences.\nFemale-rated facial attractiveness was largely unrelated to\nmate preferences, with the exception of similar religious back-\nground and good health--both of which were preferred more\nstrongly by men with attractive versus less attractive faces.\nFacial attractiveness also correlated modestly (p < .10) with\npreferring a more ambitious and industrious partner. Men with\nhigh facial attractiveness also exhibited a modestly greater\npreference for partners who are high in ambition and indus-\ntriousness. However, men with higher overall self-perceived\nmate value held stronger preferences for marrying younger,\npreferred a younger partner, as well as sociable partners with\ngood financial prospects, desire for home and children, social\nstatus, good looks, ambition, and mutual attraction and love\nrelative to men with lower self-perceived mate value. High\nself-perceived mate value among men also correlated modestly\nwith an overall larger age difference between partners and with\na preference for having a partner in good health. Both facial\nattractiveness and self-perceived mate value were then entered\ninto a regression equation with total mate-preference score\nentered as the dependent variable. Results showed that self-\nperceived mate value (b \u00bc .37, p \u00bc .001) but not facial attrac-\ntiveness (b \u00bc .11, p \u00bc .20) predicted higher overall mate-\npreference score, R2\nadj\nDiscussion\nThe present study built upon established links between\nwomen's mate value and heightened mate preferences across\nbroad dimensions (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) by extending\npreliminary findings linking men's mate value to their mate\npreferences (Buston & Emlin, 2003; Edlund & Sagarin,\n2010). Specifically, both other-rated facial attractiveness (Buss\n& Shackelford, 2008) and self-reported mate value (Fisher\net al., 2008) were examined in relation to 21 mate preferences\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nResults showed a clear pattern of relations between self-\nperceived mate value and expressed mate preferences. First,\nmen who believed themselves as higher in mate value reported\nstronger preferences for a partner who desired home and chil-\ndren and for marrying at an earlier age. Buss and Shackelford\n(2008) suggested that men who married younger would have\nhistorically been among the most reproductively successful\n(Symons, 1979). Following this logic, high mate value men\nwould be most able to express this preference. To the author's\nknowledge, this is the first study to link perceived mate value to\na desire to marry at a younger age, and thus this potentially\nimportant finding bears replication attempt in future research.\nIt is also unsurprising that perceivably high mate value men\nalso desired a larger age difference between them and their\npartner, and more specifically to marry a partner younger than\nthem, given that youth is a marker of fertility in women. Pre-\nvious research on the Hadza (Tanzanian hunter\u00adgatherers) has\nshown that men who prefer youth in a partner also prefer good\nlooks in a partner (Marlowe, 2004). In this study, high mate\nvalue men also preferred both mutual attraction/love and a\npartner who was good-looking, given that physical appearance\ncan also serve as a marker of health and/or fertility (see\nArnocky et al., 2014, for review). Mutual attraction/love may\nalso serve to indicate likelihood or propensity of sexual access,\npositive treatment within the relationship, or perhaps likelihood\nof partner infidelity or defection.\nHigh mate value men also desired a partner who was more\nsociable and had good social status. Some recent research on\nthe Agta and the BaYaka demonstrated that women's indirect\nsocial centrality (i.e., second- and third-degree ties) correlated\nwith them producing significantly more living offspring (Page\net al., 2017). High mate value men were also more likely to\nprefer partners who were ambitious with good financial pros-\npects relative to lower mate value men. Although past research\nhas demonstrated that women on the whole prefer these traits in\nmen, it may not be surprising that men who can afford to also\nexpress preference for these traits would do so, especially in\ncontemporary Western society. In Canada, the number of dual-\nincome families with children has doubled since 1976 (Statis-\ntics Canada, 2016). This trend was reported to be due in part by\nchanges in cultural attitudes coupled with growth in women's\nattained education, but also necessitated by general labor mar-\nket conditions (Statistics Canada, 2016). Other research on\nrural Caribbean villagers has shown that individuals with more\nresources (i.e., land) generally had better reproductive success\n(Flinn, 1986), and some past research has linked wealth to\nwhereas other studies have not (Kanazawa, 2003). Neverthe-\nless, it is unclear to what extent family (as opposed to individ-\nual) income might factor in to contemporary indices of\nreproductive success. Some quasi-experimental research has\nshown that increases in total household income can lead to\nostensible indices of offspring quality, such as higher levels\nof education and lower criminality (Akee, Copeland, Keeler,\nAngold, & Costello, 2010). Future researchers may thus seek to\nidentify the factors or motivations underlying men's prefer-\nences for a partner with good earning capacity.\nTable 1. Correlation Coefficients Between Facial Attractiveness and\nMate Value in Relation to Men's Mate Preferences.\nFacial\nAttractiveness\nSelf-Perceived Mate\nValue\nPreference for younger\npartner\nGood cook and\nhousekeeper\nEmotional stability and\nmaturity\nDesire for home and\nchildren\nSimilar religious\nbackground\nAmbition and\nindustriousness\nSimilar political\nbackground\nNote. Bivariate correlations were all two-tailed.\nFigure 1. Scatterplot depicting the bivariate relationship between\nmean self-perceived mate value scores and mean mate-preference\nscores.\nFinally, self-perceived mate value showed a modest correla-\ntion with preference for a healthy mate. Given the importance\nof partner's (and particularly female) health in pathogen avoid-\nance, providing disease resistance to offspring, and in the\ncapacity to survive in order to rear offspring to reproductive\nage (see Arnocky, Pearson, & Vaillancourt, 2015; Tybur &\nGangestad, 2011 for review), it is sensible that high mate value\nmen would also express this preference more strongly than\nlower mate value men. Together, it appears that men's per-\nceived mate value aligns with their mate preferences in a\ndomain-general manner.\nConversely, female-rated physical attractiveness correlated\nonly with preferring a similar religious background and a part-\nner in good health, and modestly with ambition. Why would\nfacial attractiveness, which has previously been established as\na reliable mate value characteristic in men, nevertheless be\nrelatively uncorrelated with men's mate preferences, especially\ngiven previously reported links between this variable and\nwomen's mate preferences? One possibility is that men's facial\nattractiveness is a much more restricted and potentially less\nimportant indicator of mate value relative to both women's\nfacial attractiveness (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) and the\ndiverse range of traits measured by self-report. For instance,\nrecent evidence has demonstrated that the relationship between\nattractiveness and desirability as a mate likely relies on addi-\ntional factors affecting an individual's mate value, such as\naltruism and prosociality (Ehlebracht, Stavrova, Fetchenhauer,\n& Farrelly, 2017). Because attractiveness, on the whole, may\nbe less important for men relative to women being chosen as a\nmate (i.e., objective mate value; Todd, Penke, Fasolo, & Len-\nton, 2007), the fact that men's facial attractiveness related to\nfewer mate-preference traits may not be surprising.\nOne other possibility is that men's facial attractiveness is in\nand of itself a complex of diverse indicators such as facial\nsymmetry, averageness, masculinity, or perhaps even feminin-\nity (see Arnocky et al., 2014; Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink,\n& Grammer, 2001). Although attractiveness ratings were con-\nsistent across raters in the present study, it is possible that\nexamination of the individual markers comprising male facial\nattractiveness might elucidate more specific links to mate\npreferences.\nAn additional explanation may be that individuals vary con-\nsiderably in their ability to accurately judge their own mate\nvalue. For example, in a speed-dating paradigm, Back, Penke,\nSchmukle, and Asendorpf (2011) asked participants to record\nwho they would choose as mates and who they believed would\nchoose them as mates. The authors found that sociosexually\nunrestricted men, who require less emotional intimacy and love\nprior to entering into a sexual relationship, showed greater own\nmate value assessment accuracy compared to more sociosexu-\nally restricted men. Other research has also identified variabil-\nity in the ability to judge specific components of own mate\nvalue, such as one's own physical attractiveness, and sex dif-\nferences (females may be more accurate than males; Rand &\nHall, 1983) and contextual cues (such as making social\ncomparisons to attractive others; Cash, Cash, & Butlers,\n1983) can influence such self-assessments.\nIn the present study, there was no link between objective\n(female-rated) facial attractiveness and either total self-\nperceived mate value or self-perceived mate value subscales\nrelating to own attractiveness or desirability to the opposite sex.\nThis suggests that men's self-rated desirability may vary from\ntheir actual desirability (at least in terms of physical attractive-\nness) to females. This is consistent with some previous research\non females which has demonstrated that self-perceptions of\nattractiveness do not always align with objective and other-\nperceived evaluations (e.g., Nestor, Stillman, & Frisina,\n2010). Past research has shown that ratings of attractiveness\namong members of the opposite sex are somewhat flexible, and\ncan vary according to the raters' own relationship status,\nwhereby single-relative to pair-bonded raters evaluate mem-\nbers of the opposite sex as more attractive (Simpson, Gang-\nestad, & Lerma, 1990), and whether the individual being rated\nis known to the rater, whereby raters in leadership roles eval-\nuate in-group subordinates as more attractive relative to other\nout-group leaders (Kniffin, Wansink, Griskevicius, & Wilson,\n2014). Future research might benefit from considering how\nsuch individual differences and contextual variabilities in oth-\ners' ratings of attractiveness might influence concordance with\nown ratings of attractiveness and overall mate value.\nImportantly, it appears that self-perception matters more\nthan objective reality in terms of the mate preferences men\nhold. This finding aligns with previous studies on the impor-\ntance of self-perceived mate value in guiding both men's and\nwomen's mating-relevant behavior, such as intra- and intersex-\nual aggression (Arnocky et al., 2012; Bird, Carr\u00b4\ne, Knack, &\nArnocky, 2016). Women's self-rated attractiveness has also\nbeen linked to more discerning mate preferences, such as\nincreased preference for masculinized male voices (Vukovic\net al., 2008). Accordingly, we would expect both objective\nindices and other-perceptions of important mate value charac-\nteristics to potentially exert weaker influences upon mate value\ncontingent psychological and behavioral processes relative to\nself-perceptions of those same characteristics. Future research\nexamining the predictive value of self-versus other-ratings is\nwarranted.\nOne additional limitation is that the present study focused\nonly on self-rated mate preferences, rather than on overt mating\ndecisions (i.e., the levels of mate value characteristics in indi-\nviduals' actual partners). It would be worthwhile to examine\nwhether self- versus other-rated measures of mate value corre-\nspond more strongly to these actual mating outcomes surround-\ning partner quality.\nConclusion\nThe present study demonstrated that, similar to women, men\nwith higher self-perceived mate value exhibit more selective\nmate preferences across diverse characteristics in their female\npartners. Conversely, one other-rated indicator of men's mate\nvalue, facial attractiveness, showed fewer links to mate\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\npreferences, although it is noteworthy that of the few emergent\nrelationships, all were in the direction of higher value men\nexpressing more selective preferences.
