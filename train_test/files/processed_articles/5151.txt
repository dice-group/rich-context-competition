The theory is based on Lambert's\n(1760) account of surface scattering, implying that the luminance at the eye depends on the inclination\nof the local surface with respect to the global direction of illumination. Shape From Shading (SFS)\nalgorithms of machine vision are based upon this concept (Horn & Brooks, 1989).\nA sampling of artistic techniques suggests that visual awareness might not derive from such algo-\nrithms. Here, we demonstrate that the conventional probe does not imply SFS at all. We address the\nphenomenology involving the shape of the region of interest (ROI) of the \"conventional stimulus\" of\nSFS research.\nThe effective stimuli for SFS are spatial luminance gradient variations. The conventional stimulus\nis a uniform luminance gradient, localized in an ROI, arguably the simplest possible instance. A cir-\ncular ROI minimizes form cues. In use for decades, the conventional stimulus became widely known\nROI shape is important (Sun & Schofield, 2012; Wagemans, van Doorn, & Koenderink, 2010). A\nsquare leads to a cylindrical, a triangular to a conical form (Figure 1), suggesting that the luminance\ngradient is not the only cue of relevance. The \"shape cue\" (due to the outline) and the \"shading cue\"\nsomehow combine. The removal of the outline destroys the impression of form (Erens, Kappers, &\nWe suggest a novel interpretation: the uniform gradient is irrelevant. What matters is the change\nof the luminance discontinuity along the contour. This is not \"cue combination,\" but the effect of a\nsingle cue of different kind. We offer a \"visual proof.\"\nIndeed, the uniform gradient inside the disk is irrelevant. Consider the two images at the top\nof Figure 2. The left image is the conventional stimulus and the right disk is uniform (no gradi-\nent!), whereas the background is given a uniform gradient. Observers are aware of a spherical cap\nin both cases (Shapley & Gordon, 1985). An even more extreme case is the image at the bottom\nleft of Figure 2, where both the disk and the background are uniform. Only the circular contour is\nmodulated. Again, observers report a spherical cap. The \"sphericity\" is judged about as good as that\nelicited by the conventional stimulus. On initial exposure the cap looks perhaps slightly flatter than\nin the case of the conventional stimulus, but this tends to change after a while. SFS algorithms do\nnot even apply here.\nSFS? Not likely!\n300 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nThe visual proof perhaps reminds one of the illusions related to lateral inhibition and Mach bands,\nillustrated in Figure 3. You can \"color\" a disk without spending paint on its interior, you merely modu-\nlate its outline (Cornsweet, 1970). Such effects are extensively used by visual artists (Ratliff, 1965). It\nis how you paint the full moon using black ink.\nThe \"watercolor illusion\" reported by Pinna (1987) also fills in large areas. It does not lead to\neffects reminiscent of SFS though.\nDoes this imply human vision fails to use SFS at all? No, but it implies that the conventional\nstimulus is too poor to reveal this. It offers no gradient variations, except at the contour. These\nFigure 1. At left the \"conventional stimulus\" of SFS. At center and right, the ROI has been changed from circular\nto square or triangular. Observers are aware of (from left to right) a sphere, a cylinder, and a cone. (Perhaps\nslightly \"flattened in depth,\" sometimes inverted in depth.) The nominal \"SFS stimulus\" is the same in all cases.\nFigure 2. Main \"visual proof.\" At top left the conventional stimulus. At top right the background, not the disk,\ngets the gradient. At bottom left both the background and the disk are uniform, except for a narrow strip about\nthe circular outline. (Proof at bottom right, the black strip occludes the immediate neighborhood of the circular\ncircumference.) This works as well as the conventional stimulus. Apparently the gradient in the disk is largely\nirrelevant. In all cases (except bottom right, of course) one has an awareness of \"light coming in from above.\"\nvariations involve gradients of much greater magnitude than the uniform gradient in the interior.\nThus, the contour gradient variation dominates the appearance. The effect reveals an additional cue\n(\"contour-shading gradient cue\"?), whereas it has little impact on the study of SFS per se.\nIs the method used in bottom left of Figure 2 also used in the visual arts? Yes, all the time. The\nmethod is common in early twentieth-century painting. It allows one to \"shade\" for form, without\nbeing forced to take recourse to \"tonal\" painting. This is crucial when artists care to preserve the\npicture plane as an object, instead of suggesting a ghostly \"window\" into another world. Because\nthe shading is local, it requires more effort to integrate mutually distant parts of a single outline. It\ninvolves highly non-trivial Gestalt formation. This leads to novel sources of ambiguity that the artist\nmight exploit. It was heavily used in cubism (Picasso, 1910), and extensively applied in works as that\n"
