Ludwig, MD;\nEllis J. Neufeld, MD, PhD; Jane W. Newburger, MD, MPH; Nader Rifai, PhD\nBackground--Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined by the Third Report of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) using\ncriteria easily applied by clinicians and researchers. There is no standard pediatric definition.\nMethods and Results--We defined pediatric MetS using criteria analogous to ATP III as 3 of the following: (1) fasting\ncircumference 75th percentile for age and gender; and (5) systolic blood pressure 90th percentile for gender, age,\nand height. MetS prevalence in US adolescents was estimated with the Third National Health and Nutritional Survey\nabnormality, and nearly 1 in 10 had MetS. The racial/ethnic distribution was similar to adults: Mexican-Americans,\nfollowed by non-Hispanic whites, had a greater prevalence of MetS compared with non-Hispanic blacks (12.9%, [95%\nConclusions--Our definition of pediatric MetS, designed to be closely analogous to ATP III, found MetS is common in\nadolescents and has a similar racial/ethnic distribution to adults in this representative national sample. Because\nchildhood MetS likely tracks into adulthood, early identification may help target interventions to improve future\nKey Words: metabolic syndrome  pediatrics  risk factors\nThe metabolic syndrome (MetS), also called insulin resis-\ntance syndrome, has been described in many ways, in\npart owing to the lack of a \"gold standard\" diagnostic test.\nThe Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)1 defines adult MetS\nas 3 or more of the following abnormalities: hypertriglycer-\nidemia, low HDL, high fasting glucose, excessive waist\ncircumference, and hypertension, on the basis of associations\nwith adverse cardiovascular outcomes derived from large\nresearch trials.1 Adults with MetS are at greater risk for\ncardiovascular disease2 and diabetes mellitus.3 Ford et al,4\nusing the Third National Health and Nutritional Survey\n(NHANES III), estimated the syndrome affected 25% of US\nadults.\nThe MetS has not been well characterized in children and\nadolescents in terms of criteria, prevalence, or clinical impli-\ncations, although studies have examined MetS abnormali-\nties.5,6 We propose a definition of MetS in adolescents based\nclosely on the ATP III1 and, using NHANES III data,\ndescribe its prevalence in US children aged 12 to 19 years.\nMethods\nATP III defines adult MetS as 3 or more of the criteria described in the\nTable. To generate a definition appropriate for children aged 12 to 19\nyears, we extrapolated from adult criteria. Triglyceride (TG) and HDL\ncutpoints were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles.7 We defined\nhyperglycemia using the ATP III cutpoint. ATP III uses waist circum-\nference as a measure of central obesity, and percentiles for age and\ngender have been most associated with central obesity in children across\ngenders and races8; therefore, we used percentiles comparable to the\nadult male cutpoint of the 70th percentile.9 Because normal pediatric\nblood pressure varies significantly, we used the National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute's recommended cutpoint of 90th percentile for\nage, gender, and height.10\nNHANES III is a national data set collected between 1988 and\n1994, weighted to represent the population of noninstitutionalized\nUS civilians not living on Indian reservations and aged 2 years and\nFrom the Departments of Cardiology (S.D.d.F., K.G., J.W.N.); Medicine, Divisions of Endocrinology (D.S.L.) and Hematology (E.J.N.); and\nLaboratory Medicine and Pathology (N.R.), Children's Hospital, Boston, Mass.\nConsulting Editor for this article was Burton E.

It uses a multistage, stratified sampling design and has been\nwell described.11 The present sample was drawn from children aged\n12 to 19 years who underwent physical examinations and fasted\nbefore blood testing.\nStatistical Methods\nexamination of the NHANES III survey and fasted for at least 8\nhours, the prevalence of MetS was calculated overall and by gender,\nage group, and race or ethnicity. Because of the survey's complex\nsampling design, estimates and standard errors were calculated in\nStata12 with the sampling weights provided, to be representative of\nthe civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Sample weights are\nadjusted for nonresponse. For estimates of prevalence, subjects with\nmissing information on MetS criteria were assumed not to have met\nthat criterion. A second set of estimates was calculated solely for\nsubjects with nonmissing data for all 5 criteria. MetS prevalence was\nalso estimated in the subgroup of adolescents with body mass index\n85th percentile for age and gender.\nResults\nLow HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and central obesity were\ncommon among the present sample, whereas hyperglycemia\nand hypertension were infrequent (Figure 1). As in adults,\nhypertriglyceridemia and low HDL were most common\namong non-Hispanic whites and least common among non-\nHispanic blacks, whereas Mexican-Americans had the great-\nest prevalence of high waist circumference (data not shown).\nadolescents had at least 1 metabolic abnormality, and 9.2%\nPrevalence was comparable for boys and girls and for older\nrespectively). Four or more abnormalities were found in 35\nchildren (1.6%); no child had all 5 criteria. Mexican-\nAmericans, followed by non-Hispanic whites, had a greater\nprevalence of MetS compared with non-Hispanic blacks\nFigure 2 shows the prevalence of MetS by gender and\nrace/ethnicity. Information was not available on every crite-\nrion for all participants. When the 1707 adolescents with\ncomplete data were analyzed, the prevalence of 3 or more\nto 11.7%] versus 9.2%) and the CI was slightly wider. Among\nchildren with BMI 85th percentile for age and gender, the\nDiscussion\nUsing a pediatric definition based closely on ATP III, we\nfound the prevalence of MetS in US children aged 12 to 19\nyears was approximately 1 in 10. In overweight/obese chil-\ndren, a notable 1 in 3 had MetS. Moreover, two thirds of all\nadolescents had at least 1 metabolic abnormality. Our find-\nings are consistent with research in young adults, in whom the\n10-year incidence of MetS was 8% to 12% in the nonobese\nand 34% to 41% in the obese, although this definition used\nmore extreme lipid cutoffs and body mass index instead of\nwaist circumference.13 Our results are not surprising in view\nof the high and rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes\nmellitus in US children.\nPediatric researchers have investigated individual metabol-\nic abnormalities that increase cardiovascular risk5 and found\nthey track from childhood to adulthood, leading one to\nsuspect MetS might also track into adulthood.14 In fact,\nAdult and Proposed Pediatric Definitions of MetS\nAdult Definition* Percentiles Proposed Pediatric Definition\nHigh fasting glucose 6.1 mmol/L NA 6.1 mmol/L\nCentral obesity (waist circumference) 102 cm (men);\n75th percentile for age and gender\nNA 90th percentile for age, gender, and height\nFigure 1.

The Quebec family cohort study14 used\nskinfold measurements and mean blood pressure, criteria\nmore cumbersome for the primary pediatrician and less\nclosely based on ATP III than the present definition. The\nTaipei Children Heart Study18 used its own population\ndistribution for cutpoints. A Hungarian study defined MetS\nby more extreme lipid cutpoints, body fat measurements\ninstead of waist circumference, and 24-hour blood pressure\nmonitoring. In a high-risk US population of obese children,\n39% had MetS when defined by body mass index instead of\nwaist circumference, lipid levels 95th percentile (or 5th\npercentile for HDL), and oral glucose tolerance testing.19 The\nMetS definition given by Cook et al,6 based on 1992 National\nCholesterol Education Program guidelines and devised before\nATP III and wide recognition of MetS, uses more restrictive\nlipid and abdominal circumference cutpoints, which leads to\nlower prevalence estimates in adolescents of 4%. Translat-\ning their definition to pediatric percentiles, an HDL level of\npercentile. The higher triglyceride cutpoint of 110 mg/dL\nrepresents the 85th to 95th pediatric percentile, also higher\nthan the adult 75th to 85th percentile. The abdominal circum-\nference cutpoint of the 90th percentile is higher than the 75th\npercentile used in the present study. In contrast to other\ncriteria, our pediatric definition was based closely on the\nmore inclusive ATP III adult criteria, considering the effects\nof age, gender, and puberty, and therefore captures a larger\npopulation of adolescents.\nOur study should be interpreted in light of its limitations.\nThe primary limitation is that study outcomes depend on our\ndefinition of MetS, a problem inherent to any extrapolation of\nthe adult definition to a pediatric population. We used\nstandard cholesterol cutpoints that form the basis for ATP III,\nand National Cholesterol Education Program/American\nAcademy of Pediatrics, guidelines. Cholesterol levels, partic-\nularly HDL levels in males, are affected by puberty,20 yet\npediatric norms from Lipid Research Clinic data are available\nby age, not by Tanner stage. Because these normative data\nwere published in 1979 and may not reflect contemporary\nearlier puberty rates, we may have overestimated the number\nof boys with abnormally low HDL. However, decreases in the\nage of puberty have primarily affected girls, not boys, which\nminimizes this effect. We used waist circumference as a\nconvenient surrogate for visceral obesity, which is associated\nwith insulin resistance, the likely pathophysiological under-\npinning of MetS. Waist circumference is a less accurate but\nmore practical and lower-risk indicator of visceral obesity\nthan abdominal CT or MRI, is the method used by ATP III,\nand is available in NHANES III. Fat distribution is affected\ndifferentially by puberty in girls and boys; we attempted to\ncontrol for this using age- and gender-based waist circumfer-\nence percentiles. The present study is also limited by the\ndatabase. Although NHANES is highly representative of\nmost of the United States, American Indian reservations are\nnot included in the survey. The rate of obesity and type 2\ndiabetes mellitus is particularly high in some American\nIndian populations21; one would expect higher MetS rates in\nthese groups.\nThe impact of these data may be far-reaching. In adults,\nMetS correlates with increased rates of type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and cardiovascular disease.2,3 Practitioners should be\naware of the clustering of metabolic abnormalities in chil-\ndren, and affected children should receive risk-reducing\ninterventions. Understanding the prevalence of pediatric\nMetS may foster interventions and research; further investi-\ngation could better illuminate its pathophysiology and rela-\ntionship to cardiovascular disease.\n"
