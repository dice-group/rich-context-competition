Introduction\nThe consumption of e-cigarettes expanded rapidly after 2010 in many countries, most notably\nin the United Kingdom and the United States. In the UK nearly 3 million people regularly use the\nproducts, and since 2013 they have been the most commonly used aid for smoking cessation [1].\nIncreasing prevalence of e-cigarette use in England has been positively associated with higher rates of\nsuccessful quit attempts [2].\nIn the US, there is growing evidence from several nationally representative surveys that e-cigarette\nuse is a frequently-used quit-smoking aid and enhances cessation rates. Analysis of the 2014\u00ad2015\nCurrent Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement (CPS-TUS) revealed that smokers who used\ne-cigarettes were more likely than non-users to try to quit smoking and to succeed [3,4], and both\noutcomes were significantly associated with increasing frequency of e-cigarette use [4]. Another study\nusing National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from the same years found that the prevalence\nof former smoking was significantly higher among daily e-cigarette users than among those who\nhad never used them (52% vs. 28%), although some-day users were less likely to have quit (12%) [5].\ncompletely to e-cigarettes; in that survey one year later 3.8% of former smokers had switched [6].\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 20% of current smokers in\nthe 2014 NHIS who had made a quit attempt had tried e-cigarettes [7]. Other investigators from the\nCDC used data from the Knowledge Panel Survey to report that current smokers more frequently\nused e-cigarettes than FDA-approved medications for quit attempts from 2014 to 2016 [8]. However,\nno specific information is available in these surveys about e-cigarette use before, during or after quit\nattempts by current and former smokers. In this report we extend the CDC's observations by analyzing\ndata from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study.\nThe PATH Study is a combined project of the US Food and Drug Administration and the National\nInstitutes of Health that enrolled two cohorts of adult and youth respondents in 2014. The objective\nof the PATH survey is to collect information on tobacco use patterns, risk perceptions and attitudes,\nand history of tobacco dependence and cessation for various tobacco products [9]. An overview of\ntobacco use among participants in the baseline PATH Wave 1 was recently published [10]. The purpose\nof this report is to describe the quit methods used in the past 12 months by current and former smokers\nin the baseline PATH survey.\n2. Materials and Methods\nWe used the Wave 1 Adult Public Use File from the PATH survey [11], which involved\ninterviews with 32,320 civilian and non-institutionalized adults (ages 18 and older) from all 50\nUnited States and the District of Columbia. Subject screening and enrollment from September\n2013 to December 2014 used computer-assisted personal interviewing; interviews were completed\nwith audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. PATH oversampled young adults (ages 18\u00ad24),\nblacks, and tobacco users. Information about the conceptual framework, methods [12] and sampling\nprocedures [11] of the PATH survey are available.\nWe used standard definitions for e-cigarette users and smokers. Respondents who had ever used\ne-cigarettes regularly and currently used them every day or some days were classified as current\nusers. Current smokers had consumed at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and were smoking every\nday or some days at the time of the survey. Former smokers had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in\ntheir lifetime but were not smoking at the time of the survey. Both current and former smokers may\ncurrently use other tobacco products. Our analysis was restricted to current smokers who had tried to\nquit completely at least one time in the past 12 months and to past-year former smokers, because these\nwere the only subgroups who were questioned about quit methods.\nPast year quit methods were assessed by the following questions: \"Thinking back to [the time you\ntried to quit (current smokers who tried one time) | the last time you tried to quit (current smokers\nwho tried two or more times) | when you quit (former smokers)] cigarettes in the past 12 months,\"\na \"did you rely on the support of friends and family to help you?\"\nb \"did you use any of the following to help you: counseling, a telephone help line or quit line, books,\npamphlets, videos, a quit tobacco clinic, class, or support group, or an internet or web-based program?\"\nc \"did you use any different tobacco product (e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars,\npipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, smokeless tobacco, like dip, chew, or snuff, and dissolvable\ntobacco) to help you quit? Choose all that apply\"\nd \"did you use a nicotine patch, gum, inhaler, nasal spray, lozenge or pill?\" (hereafter nicotine\nreplacement therapy, or NRT)\ne \"did you use Chantix, varenicline, Wellbutrin, Zyban, or bupropion?\" (hereafter a prescription drug)\nData were analyzed by Stata, version 13 (College Station, TX, USA) using descriptive statistics\nwith results for respondents reporting a single quit method and two or more methods. Population\nestimates were generated using PATH survey weights to reflect the U.S. adult population. In addition,\nwe employed logistic regression to estimate the association, expressed as odds ratios (ORs), between\npast-year former smokers and single quit methods and other characteristics. We also estimated the odds\nof each method separately, coded as 1 if a respondent used it and 0 otherwise. These included: (1) did not\nuse any quit method; (2) relied on support of friends and family; (3) used other methods (i.e., counseling,\ntelephone help line or quit line, books, pamphlets, videos, quit tobacco clinic, class, or support group,\ninternet or web-based program); (4) used e-cigarettes; (5) used other tobacco products (i.e., traditional\ncigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, smokeless tobacco like dip, chew,\nor snuff); (6) used nicotine replacement products (i.e., patch, gum, inhaler, nasal spray, lozenge or pill);\nand (7) used a prescription drug (i.e., Chantix, varenicline; Wellbutrin, Zyban or bupropion).\nIndividual characteristics (i.e., number of quit attempts, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,\nhousehold income, and region) were included as covariates in the regression analyses. We excluded\nparticipants with missing quit methods and individual characteristics.\n3. Results\nthe derivation of the final numbers of current smokers who tried to quit smoking (n = 4541) and of\nformer smokers who quit smoking (n = 839) in the past 12 months. Seventy-one percent of current\nsmokers had tried to quit more than once, compared with 43% of former smokers. Thirty-four percent\nof current smokers had not used any method, 34% had used one method, 21% had used 2 methods and\n8% had used 4 methods. The distribution according to number of methods used by former smokers\nwas very similar.\nTable 1.

However, the latter estimates are not\nmutually exclusive.\n4. Discussion\nOur analysis of the PATH survey shows that help from friends and family was the most common\nwas the second most frequently used method, followed by NRT and a prescription drug. In addition,\nuse of e-cigarettes was the only quit method producing significantly higher odds of being a past-year\nformer smoker than using no method. E-cigarettes were also popular among smokers using two or\nmore methods, although the results are not mutually exclusive in that group.\nComparison of population estimates for e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, NRT and prescription\ndrugs are informative, because the first two are smoke-free tobacco products that are considered\nunacceptable as cigarette substitutes by government agencies and most American health\nauthorities [13], while the latter two are universally promoted as safe and effective by the same.\nIn this study e-cigarettes were frequently used as a single quit method and were the only method\nwith higher odds of former smoking than unassisted quitting. These results are consistent with\nstudies from other national surveys including CPS-TUS [3,4], NHIS [5] and NATS [6]. Furthermore,\nthese cohort studies suggest that e-cigarettes enhance smoking cessation at the population level in\nthe absence of medical intervention, so the growing evidence complements positive results from\nclinical trials [14,15]. This study also meets some of the criteria recently proposed for studies related to\ne-cigarettes and smoking cessation, including a specific outcome (cessation), specific quit methods,\nand some information on extended use of those methods [16].\nAmong former smokers who had used e-cigarettes as a single quit method, 54% were still using\nthem at the time of the survey. This is similar to the proportion of former smokers who had used\nsmokeless tobacco to quit (46%), based on information in the 2000 NHIS [17], although the context\nand time frame in the latter survey were different. Almost half of former smokers who had quit\nwith e-cigarettes had also discontinued vaping (46%, n = 59/128). Current use of NRT (29%) and\nprescription medications (35%) were also seen among former smokers, although the numbers of\nobservations were small. These results may also be related to the time frame of the study, that is, in the\npast 12 months with no restriction for recency. Among current e-cigarette users, regardless of current\nor former smoking status, more than 90% were using products containing nicotine.\nE-cigarette use has changed substantially in the 3\u00ad4 years since the PATH baseline survey was\nconducted. There were 8.9 million current vapers in 2014 the first year NHIS collected data on\nAlthough there were fewer current vapers in 2016 than in 2014, a higher proportion of them were\nformer smokers in the latter year, which suggests that e-cigarette use remained a popular quit method.\nThis study confirms previous observations that quitting without any assistance is attempted by\nthe largest number of smokers. Some tobacco control advocates believe that \"an overly medicalised\nview of smoking cessation . . . sees unassisted cessation as both inefficient and inhumane\" [19].\nWe view e-cigarettes as both a counter to the over-medicalisation of smoking cessation and as\na necessary supplement for the persistent inadequacy of unassisted cessation. For these reasons we\nbelieve that smokers deserve full access to e-cigarettes and any other aids to become smoke-free,\nwith or without nicotine/tobacco abstinence.\nThere are some limitations with this study. This was an observational study using cross-sectional\ndata. Smoking and quitting behaviors were self-reported and subject to recall error. There may be\nsome instability in permanent cessation among former smokers who quit in the past 12 months.\nHowever, the PATH survey is designed to provide follow-up in subsequent waves over a longer\nperiod, which will inform tobacco researchers about patterns of cessation and regression. This study\nwas not restricted to exclusive current and former smokers, but one of the quit methods asked by the\nPATH survey included switching to other tobacco products. Finally, there are some inconsistencies in\nreporting e-cigarette use; a small number of current smokers (4/459) reported that they have not seen\nor heard of e-cigarettes, but said that they used e-cigarettes to help them quit.\n5. Conclusions\nE-cigarettes were used by American adult smokers as quit-smoking aids in 2013\u00ad2014 more\nfrequently than NRT products or prescription drugs. In addition, they were the only single quit\nmethod with a significantly higher proportion of former smokers than unaided quitting.\n"
