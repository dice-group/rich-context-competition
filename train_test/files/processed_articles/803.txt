    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper provides information about the nationwide prevalence\nof selected employer health insurance purchasing strategies. These strategies\ninclude raising the share of medical costs borne by employees; the use of\nquality information in choosing which plans to offer; and direct contracting with\nprovider systems. The data are primarily from the 1997 Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nObservers of the employment-based health insurance\nscene during the 1990s have remarked on the rapid transi-\ntion of the employer's role from passive payer to active pur-\nchaser. They cite innovative strategies adopted by leading employ-\ners to contain costs while maintaining or enhancing quality of care.\nThese practices have been labeled as \"managed competition,\" \"active\npurchasing,\" \"responsible purchasing,\" and \"value purchasing.\"1\nStrategies in the purchaser's tool kit include (1) offering a choice\nof plans, with an emphasis on managed care; (2) sharing costs and\nresponsibility with employees, by benchmarking employer contri-\nbutions to the lowest-cost plan and through increased cost-sharing\namounts or reduced benefits; (3) measuring plans' quality of care\nand using this information in decision making; (4) forming and\nparticipating in purchasing coalitions; and (5) bypassing insurers\nand health plans by contracting directly with provider systems.\nPrimarily using case-study methods, researchers have selected\nand interviewed private corporations, purchasing coalitions, and\nstate governments representing the cutting edge of the field. This\nwork provides rich context and institutional detail; it also generates\nhypotheses. However, the study cases may not represent the practices\nof typical employer purchasers.

In previous work we examined managed competition and\npooled purchasing.2 Here we focus on three remaining topics: (1)\nincreasing employees' share of costs by reducing the scope or\nbreadth of benefits; (2) using quality information in choosing which\nplans to offer; and (3) direct contracting with provider systems.\nBefore turning to our findings, we briefly summarize the previous\nliterature on each of these topics.\nn Cost sharing. Citing numerous sources, Robert Kuttner con-\ncluded that employers shifted health care cost increases to their\nworkers by incorporating financial inducements to choose em-\nployee-only as opposed to family coverage, increasing employee con-\ntributions to premiums, capping coverage for special benefits, and\nincreasing deductibles or copayments.3\nn Quality measures. Several recent studies have explored rates\nof employers' use of quality measures in making purchasing\ndecisions, with quite different results. Judith Hibbard and others\nfound that about half of very large employers in four selected markets\nuse National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accredita-\ntion, Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) meas-\nures, and consumer satisfaction surveys in their purchasing\ndecisions.4 They found that employers whose workforce was spread\nacross more states were less likely than were those with more geo-\ngraphic concentration to use HEDIS and satisfaction surveys.\nJon Gabel and colleagues, however, found that only 5\u00ad11 percent\nof large employers used quality information in their purchasing\ndecisions.5 Anthony Lo Sasso and others found that only a minority\nof employers considered quality measures to be very important in\ntheir purchasing decisions.6 They were considered more important\nby large employers and members of purchasing alliances, but\ncounter to hypothesis, not by the self-insured.\nn Direct contracting. Firms' directly contracting with provider\nnetworks is viewed as a relatively rare practice, nationwide.7 How-\never, a recent survey of business coalitions found that about one-\nthird negotiated directly with providers for their members, suggest-\ning that direct contracting may be more common among businesses\nparticipating in pooled purchasing arrangements.8 The best-\ndocumented example of direct contracting is the Buyers Health Care\nAction Group in Minnesota. Tom Bodenheimer and Kip Sullivan\nsuggest that companies are most likely to contract directly alone if\nthey are located in markets with low managed care penetration.\nFurther, a firm is more likely to contract directly if its employees are\ngeographically concentrated in one or a few health care markets.9\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Our data are primarily from the 1997 Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation (RWJF) Employer Health Insurance Survey,\nwhich collected information from a national sample of 21,545 private\nbusiness establishments. The sample was drawn from the Dun's\nMarket Identifiers national census of employment establishments.\nEstablishments in the sixty communities followed by the RWJF's\nCenter for Studying Health System Change (HSC) Community\nTracking Study and in twelve states with significant small-group\ninsurance reforms were oversampled.10 Within geographic areas, the\nsamples were allocated to strata defined by the number of workers\nat the establishment. We used sample weights to make estimates for\nseveral different units of observation: all private employment estab-\nlishments in the continental United States that had at least one\nemployee and that offered health insurance, all employees of such\nestablishments, and all enrollees in their employer plans.\nData were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews\nconducted with the person or persons most knowledgeable about\nhealth benefits and firm and worker characteristics. The response\nrate to the survey was 60 percent.\nFor our analysis of increasing employees' share of costs, we meas-\ncompare data from the 1997 RWJF survey to those from the Na-\ntional Employer Health Insurance Survey (NEHIS). The NEHIS is a\nnational survey of 34,604 private employers, which collected infor-\nmation about health insurance offerings in 1993. Our methods for\ncomparing these survey data are described elsewhere.11 (All differ-\nences that we cite in the text are statistically significant at p = .05.)\nn Concepts and definitions. We used a number of specialized\nconcepts and definitions. We report the actuarial value of plan\nbenefits, measured as the expected plan benefit payments relative to\nthe expected total health expenditures for a standardized popula-\ntion. Also, we examine actuarial values for two subpopulations:\nhealth service users whose spending was below the median for all\nusers and those whose spending was above the median.\nOur measures of patient cost sharing are the deductible and a\ncoinsurance rate. Deductible amounts for 1993 have been inflated to\n1997 dollars for comparison with the RWJF data using the medical\ncare services component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all\nurban consumers (U.S. city average). Health plans use either dollar\ncopayment amounts or percentage coinsurance rates. Our survey\ncollected whichever approach was used for physician office visits.\nTo convert to a standard percentage scale, we divided the copay-\nments by a standard office visit price of $50.\nSTRATEGIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 4\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The NEHIS and RWJF surveys collected information\nabout employer and employee contributions for each plan offered.\nSome employers offered coverage for special services, such as dental\ncare or prescription drugs, in plans that were separate from the\ngeneral medical plan. We constructed employee contributions for\nthe package of benefits held by enrollees by adding together the\ncontributions that were paid both for the general medical plan and\nfor any plans covering special services.\nWe explore whether employers considered quality information\nwhen choosing which plans to offer to their employees. The 1997\nsurvey collected these data only for establishments with 500 or more\nemployees. Respondents were asked if their organization consid-\nered the following: (1) plan accreditation by a national board or\ncommission, (2) the results of patient satisfaction surveys, and (3)\nscores on a report card of selected outcomes, such as HEDIS meas-\nures. For this analysis we classify an employer as using quality infor-\nmation if it used one or more of these measures.\nFor employers offering a self-insured plan, respondents were\nasked, \"Does your company or its administrative representative con-\ntract directly with particular physician groups or hospitals to pro-\nvide health care to employees?\" We used these data to classify em-\nployers as engaging in direct contracting.\nAlthough the sample and analysis unit is the establishment--a\nphysical location of business--for some analyses we categorized\nestablishments according to the size of the firm, which includes\nemployees at all locations nationwide. Insurance decisions typically\nare made at a regional or national level for firms with several estab-\nlishments. As a measure of the degree of a firm's operation in a single\nhealth insurance market, we used the number of the firm's employ-\nees working in the same state as the sampled establishment, divided\nby the number of the firm's employees nationwide.12\nWe classified employers as self-insured if they offered at least one\nself-insured plan, based on the respondent's self-assessment.13 Sev-\neral other classifications were based on self-assessment, including\nparticipation in a pooled purchasing arrangement and whether a\nplan is a health maintenance organization (HMO), a preferred\nprovider organization (PPO), a point-of-service (POS) plan, or a\nconventional indemnity plan.14\nHMO penetration, measured for the sixty Community Tracking\nStudy sites, is based on tabulations from the employer survey data of\nthe share of employees enrolled in their employer's plan who were in\nan HMO. It is defined as \"low\" if the community is in the bottom\nquartile, \"high\" if in the top quartile, and \"medium\" otherwise.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One action an\nemployer could take to raise employees' costs is to tighten rules\ngoverning which of them are eligible for coverage or how long they\nmust wait for benefits. But most discussions of employer strategies\nto decrease their own costs focus on moves to create better incen-\ntives for enrollees to engage in cost-conscious behavior. One strat-\negy is to reduce the value of plans, either by increasing patient\ncost-sharing amounts or by reducing the number or breadth of cov-\nered benefits. An alternative is to increase the employees' share of\npremiums. While this might be done across the board, the managed\ncompetition approach calls for raising employee contributions most\nfor higher-cost plans to induce enrollment in lower-cost plans.\nIn contrast to Kuttner's conclusion, we find little evidence that\nriod (Exhibit 1). Eligibility rules were quite stable, whether we con-\nsider the minimum hours of work per week required for eligibility or\nwaiting periods from the date of employment.\nOverall, the value of plans rose slightly. The expected share of\naggregate spending that would be covered for health plan enrollees\nrose from 85 percent to 88 percent. However, this increase primarily\nresults from more generous coverage for large medical expenditures\nin recent years. The expected reimbursement share of total spending\nfor persons with health care spending above the median rose from\n86 percent to 89 percent as a consequence of lower out-of-pocket\nmaximums in PPO and indemnity plans (not shown).\nExpected insurance payments for spending by health care users\nwhose expenditures were below the median, in contrast, remained\nunchanged. This stability masks underlying changes in several di-\nrections, however. As we have documented elsewhere, enrollees\nshifted from indemnity plans to HMOs.15 The latter have lower cost\nsharing and more generous expected benefits for small health ex-\npenditures than other types of plans have. At the same time, cost\nsharing for small expenditures in HMOs and PPOs increased over\nthe period, as seen by higher coinsurance rates in HMOs and by the\nfall in the expected insurance reimbursement share for HMO and\nPPO enrollees with low health care spending. For low-spending\nHMO enrollees, the reimbursement share fell from 82 percent of\nspending to 75 percent; for PPO enrollees, from 68 percent to 65\npercent. Expected insurance payments for low-spending indemnity\nplan enrollees, on the other hand, increased. With the vast shift\naway from indemnity coverage that occurred, this perhaps indicates\nthat only the more generous indemnity plans continued to be chosen.\nBenefit breadth also changed. For example, the percentage of en-\nSTRATEGIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 4\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Moreover,\nthe slight increase observed in Exhibit 1 does not appear to be the\nresult of a rush to adopt the managed competition\u00adstyle incentives\nof raising employee contributions for higher-cost plans. That is be-\ncause few employers practiced managed competition, and others\nwere not moving in large numbers to adopt it.17\nn Use of quality information. Nearly 60 percent of large em-\nployers said that they used information on quality of care when\nchoosing which health plans to offer their employees; the figure rises\nto nearly 70 percent of those offering HMOs or POS plans, the types\nfor which quality information is most widely available (Exhibit 2).\nThese estimates are considerably higher than those from most pre-\nvious studies. The comparison between studies is never exact, how-\never. Other researchers have used slightly different measures of\nquality information; some have asked only about situations where it\nwas deemed \"very important\" to decisions; or they have looked at\nemployers in a different size range. In an effort to limit our data to\nPercentage Of Large Employers Using Information On Quality Of Care When Choosing\nWhich Health Plans To Offer, By Employer Characteristics, 1997\nFirm size\nResponsibility for risk\nAny self-insured plan\nFully insured only\nPooled purchasing\nParticipates\nDoes not participate\nShare of business operation in state\nLess than 10 percent\nOffers choice of plans\nYes\nNo\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTES: Establishment-weighted results. Employers are considered to use quality information if they use one or more of the\nfollowing: plan accreditation by a national board or commission, results of patient satisfaction surveys, or scores on report cards\nsuch as Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures.

Our\ndata show a positive relationship between firm size and the use of\nquality information, consistent with previous studies (Exhibit 2).\nThey also show some support for the self-insurance hypothesis, at\nleast among employers offering an HMO or POS option. However,\nthey show a strong inverse relationship between using quality infor-\nmation and participating in pooled purchasing. We do not find\nsupport for the hypothesis advanced by Hibbard and others con-\ncerning multistate location. Essentially the same share of employers\nwith half or more of their workers in-state reported using quality\ninformation as did those with less than 10 percent of operations\nin-state. Finally, we hypothesized that employers that shifted more\ndecision-making responsibility about insurance to their employees\nwould be less likely to use quality information than were employers\nwho assume a greater agency role. This is not borne out by the\nrelationship between offering a choice of plans and the use of quality\ninformation. Employers offering a choice were more likely to take\nquality information into account in selecting the menu of plans than\nwere employers offering only a single insurance plan.\nn Direct contracting and carve-outs. Although only 5 percent\nof establishments engaged in direct contracting, they accounted for\n19 percent of employees; 15 percent of health plan enrollees were in a\ndirect-contract plan (Exhibit 3). This is because the likelihood of\ndirect contracting rises sharply at larger firms: One-fifth of estab-\nlishments of firms with 500 or more employees reported that they\nuse direct contracting to arrange for at least one health plan.\nThe literature suggests several hypotheses about the types of em-\nployers that are more likely to engage in direct contracting--specifi-\ncally, those in markets with little managed care, those participating\nin purchasing pools, and those whose employees are geographically\nconcentrated. We found that large employers in markets with low\nHMO penetration were about 1.5 times as likely to contract directly\nas those in markets with high HMO penetration (Exhibit 3). The\ndata do not support the other two hypotheses, however.\nWe estimate that direct contracting is far more prevalent than is\ncommonly believed. Our respondents might have had other pur-\nchasing arrangements in mind when they reported engaging in di-\nrect contracting. They may have been referring to carve-out arrange-\nments for specialized benefits (for example, prescription drugs or\nmental health care), rather than direct contracting for the full bene-\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Here we find that increasing employees' share of medical\ncosts was not widely practiced, at least not during the mid-1990s. A\nmajority of large employers reported using quality information in\nchoosing which health plans to offer, considerably more than has\nbeen reported previously. Finally, our respondents reported that\nthey engaged in direct contracting for health benefits far more often\nthan observers had guessed.\nWe have some cautionary notes about projecting these findings\nto the future. The mid-1990s was a period of low health cost infla-\ntion, and employers were moving rapidly toward managed care\nplans as their main cost-control effort. Because most covered em-\nployees are now enrolled in managed care plans and because premi-\nums now seem to be increasing more rapidly, employers might move\nto raise employees' share of costs in the near future. However, a\nrecent survey suggests that as of 2000, employers had shielded em-\nployees from premium increases.18 Our measure of using quality in-\nformation comprises many types of quality measures and many lev-\nels of intensity of use. Although we think that it shows more interest\nin quality information than earlier studies have done, it does not say\nhow important this information was in the final health plan selec-\ntion. Finally, our effort to measure direct contracting was, to our\nknowledge, the first in an employer survey. Direct contracting is a\nrelatively recent practice and, therefore, subject to more ambiguity\nof definition and name recognition.19\nThe health system trends we have identified deserve\ncontinued monitoring. In the case of direct contracting, we\nalso encourage further efforts to define and measure the con-\ncept. This is especially important in a dynamic health care system\nwhere new arrangements among purchasers, insurers, third-party\nadministrators, and providers are constantly being developed.\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).
