    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Excess mortality due to seasonal influenza is thought to be substantial. However,\ninfluenza may often not be recognized as cause of death. Imputation methods are therefore\nrequired to assess the public health impact of influenza. The purpose of this study was to obtain\nestimates of monthly excess mortality due to influenza that are based on an epidemiologically\nmeaningful model.\nMethods and Results: U.S. monthly all-cause mortality, 1995 through 2005, was hierarchically\nmodeled as Poisson variable with a mean that linearly depends both on seasonal covariates and on\ninfluenza-certified mortality. It also allowed for overdispersion to account for extra variation that\nis not captured by the Poisson error. The coefficient associated with influenza-certified mortality\nwas interpreted as ratio of total influenza mortality to influenza-certified mortality. Separate\nestimation was performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. For the eleven year study\nConclusion: Annual estimates for influenza mortality were highly variable from year to year, but\nthey were systematically lower than previously published estimates. The excellent fit of our model\nwith the data suggest validity of our estimates.\nBackground\nInfluenza viruses, due to their genotypic plasticity [1],\ncause yearly epidemics that generally coincide with peaks\nin all-cause mortality (Figure 1). Incidence of these infec-\ntions is difficult to quantify because of their clinical simi-\nlarity with other upper respiratory infections and because\nlaboratory confirmation is rarely done. Mortality due to\nseasonal influenza, which may result from exacerbation of\nunderlying pulmonary, cardiac or other systemic condi-\ntions is, nevertheless, thought to be substantial [2-17].\nRecent U.S. estimates of average annual excess mortality\nTo estimate excess mortality due to influenza, two funda-\nmental approaches have previously been used. The most\npopular one is based on Serfling's seasonal regression\nmethod [18] and has resulted in numerous estimates of\nperiodical regression approach is based on parametric\nestimation of a sinusoidal \"baseline\" function that repre-\nThis article is available from: http://www.ete-online.com/content/5/1/26\n\u00a9 2008 Foppa and Hossain; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsents mortality in absence of influenza. The difference\nbetween the baseline function and the observed numbers\nof deaths is then interpreted as the number of excess\ndeaths due to influenza. Typically, the baseline mortality\nfunction is fitted to weekly or monthly mortality rates or\nnumbers during non-influenza months, using two or\nmore Fourier terms [18]. This approach is intuitively\nappealing as it captures the strong seasonal periodicity of\nmortality. However, the particular choice of a parametric\nbaseline function lacks epidemiological justification: Why\nshould the baseline function be sinusoidal rather than of\nany other periodic form? Depending on the shape of the\n\"true\" baseline function, under- or overestimation of\nexcess mortality due to influenza might result. If, for\nexample, the true baseline function is \"higher\" (i.e. the\ndefinite integral of the true function is larger) than the\nassumed sinusoidal function, then overestimation would\nresult and vice versa. Another, potentially more important\nshortcoming of the periodical regression approach lies in\nthe fact that seasonally correlated causes of mortality,\nincluding influenza, are not controlled for, which might\nlead to confounded estimates of excess mortality.\nTo avoid this difficulty, one could gauge all-cause mortal-\nity with some independent measure of influenza trans-\nmission (or mortality). Following this rationale,\nThompson et al. [11] estimated excess mortality due to\nboth influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). They\nused a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson\ndistribution and a logarithmic link function to model the\nweekly number of deaths. They also used two Fourier\nterms in their model, but, in addition, used indicators of\ninfluenza and RSV transmission. These indicator variables\nwere defined by the proportions of specimens testing pos-\nitive for influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), influ-\nenza B and RSV. Several potential shortcomings of this\nmethods are, however, apparent. First, this model also\nmakes a priori assumptions about the baseline mortality\nfunction\u00adin this case an exponentiated sinusoidal func-\ntion. Although this might conceivably be true, there is lit-\nAll-Cause and Influenza Mortality, U.S., 1995\u00ad2005.

Monthly data points are connected by straight lines for better visu-\nalization.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntle empirical evidence to support this assumption.\nSecond, the multiplicative form of the model implies that\nexcess mortality, given a certain amount of influenza\nactivity, depends on the current level of all-cause mortal-\nity. Again, this does not appear to be a well-founded\nassumption. Finally, the proportion of test positive speci-\nmens is likely to be a poor measure of excess mortality.\nWhile a high proportion of test positive specimens is com-\npatible with high levels of influenza transmission (and\nexcess mortality), this is not necessarily true. The model,\nhowever, implies that five hundred influenza positives,\nobtained from a thousand tests, are associated with less\nexcess mortality than two influenza positives, obtained\nfrom three tests. This appears to be an unrealistic assump-\ntion. The seasonally changing frequency of influenza test-\ning [20] is, at least partly, due to the seasonally changing\nincidence of other agents causing influenza-like illness\n(ILL).\nAlternatively, one could postulate that mortality directly\nattributed to influenza (influenza-certified mortality) rep-\nresents a certain proportion of all mortality attributable to\ninfluenza. This assumption implies that the coefficient\nassociated with influenza-certified mortality represents\nthe ratio of total influenza mortality to influenza certified\nmortality [17,21]. Here we use a method for the estima-\ntion of influenza excess mortality which is similar to the\none recently presented by Schanzer and colleagues [17]:\nwe adopt the proportionality assumption and avoid spe-\ncific parametric assumptions about the baseline function.\nIn addition, and deviating from the Schanzer model, we\nallow for random variability of influenza-certified mortal-\nity by adopting a hierarchical modeling approach. We\npresent the resulting estimates of U.S. excess mortality due\nto estimates obtained from a Thompson-like model [11],\nas well as to previously published estimates of influenza-\nassociated excess mortality.\nMethods\nData\nWe used Multiple Cause-of-Death Data for the years 1995\n2005, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville,\nMaryland). This dataset is in the public domain and can\nbe electronically downloaded from the web site of the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nhttp:www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-mortalitdatmulti\nple-cause-of-death.html. We defined deaths as influenza-\ncertified if influenza was given as underlying cause of\ndeath. The corresponding diagnostic code for ICD-9\nonwards) the code range was J10\u00adJ12. Influenza years\nwere defined as lasting from July 1 of one year to June 30\nof the following year. We defined four age categories: < 18,\n= 4,490) were not included in this analysis.\nStatistical model\nThe epidemiological model on which our analyses are\nbased implies that monthly all-cause mortality is the sum\nof \"baseline mortality\", i.e. mortality that is independent\nof influenza, and mortality that is a direct or indirect result\nof influenza. Based on the pronounced seasonal periodic-\nity of all-cause mortality we assume that baseline mortal-\nity is a function of calender month. In addition, we allow\nfor a linear and/or non-linear trend in all-cause mortality\nthat takes into account demographic or other population\nlevel changes resulting in linear/non-linear changes in\nbaseline mortality over time. Finally, we accommodate\nextra variability of baseline mortality that is not accounted\nfor by calender month and trend. This epidemiological\nmodel corresponds to the following statistical model,\nhence referred to as \"current model\":\nYi\n|\ni\n~ Poisson(\ni\n\ni\n~ Normal(\ni\nXi\n|\ni\n~ Poisson(\ni\nwhere Yi\nis the observed all-cause mortality count during\nindex months i = 1, ..., 132.

The Poisson\nmean parameter \ni\nhas an identity link and is distributed\nas Normal with mean \ni\nand variance . This parametriza-\ntion for the Poisson mean \ni\nallows for overdispersion. In\nthe implementation, \ni\nis restricted to positive values to\nensure the positivity of the generated samples. The model\nfor \ni\nhas two parts. The first part concerns mortality due\nto non-influenza related causes (baseline mortality)\nwhich includes a random intercept for calendar\nmonth mi\n(mi\n= 1, ..., 12) that models the seasonal back-\nground mortality, and also includes linear, quadratic and\ncubic effects for temporal changes due to health, demo-\ngraphic or socioeconomic factors.

Uninforma-\ntive prior distributions were used (additional file 1). To\nensure positivity of all \ni\n, the normal priors of this param-\neter were truncated at non-positive values (additional file\n1). The empirical posterior distributions of the parameters\nwere obtained from MCMC samples of 30,000, resulting\nintervals (CIs) were calculated for all parameters of inter-\nest after ensuring convergence of all model parameters.\nThe parameters of the TL model could easily be estimated\nusing a GLM procedure in any standard statistical software\npackage. However, to allow for direct comparison of the\nmodel fit we used the same estimation procedure as for\nthe current model. The fit of the two age-specific models\nwas compared using the deviance information criterion\n(DIC) [23]. DIC penalizes the model goodness-of-fit for\nadditional complexity. The complexity is measured by the\neffective number of parameters.\nIn order to quantify the variance explained by the fitted\nmodels, we used a Bayesian version of the classical R-\nwhere E(\u00b7) and V(\u00b7) are the operators for the posterior\nmean and empirical variance, respectively and ei\n= Yi\n- \ni\n.\nThe empirical variance of e is computed for each iteration.\nSeparate analyses were performed for the four age catego-\nries, because of substantial differences in seasonality of\nall-cause mortality: While seasonal periodicity is quite\nobvious in the oldest category, it distinctly decreases with\nage and becomes inapparent in the youngest category\n(Figure 2).\nResults\nyears were included in this analysis.

Accordingly, the variance explained by the TL\nmodel was also lower than for our model (BRSQ for age\nand 0.83, respectively). Yet, the pattern of predicted total\ninfluenza deaths was virtually identical to the one pre-\ndicted by the current model (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nOur estimates of excess mortality due to influenza are sub-\ndominated. The lowest estimates were obtained for the\nand B viruses predominated. Nevertheless, our estimates\nare markedly lower than previous estimates. For the year\nto influenza. For the same period, Simonsen et al. [14]\nestimated that 25,071 deaths were attributable to influ-\nenza in ages 65+ alone. Thompson et al. [11] estimated\nthe number of excess deaths during that influenza year at\n36,280\u00admore than three times our estimate. The obvious\nquestion arises, which of these estimates are closest to the\ntrue excess mortality? As pointed out above, the method\nof Simonsen et al. [14] is problematic for two reasons.\nFirst, it does not account for temporal correlation between\nbaseline mortality and influenza excess mortality. The\nresulting estimates of influenza excess mortality may\ntherefore be confounded. Second, their model makes a\npriori assumptions about the parametric shape of the base-\nline function; these assumptions may or may not be true.\nThey should, in any event, be validated. The Thompson\nmodel [11], which superficially resembles a hybrid\nbetween the Simonsen model and the model proposed by\nSchanzer et al. [17] (or the current model), addresses the\nissue of temporal confounding by controlling for the pro-\nportion of influenza test positives. As pointed out in the\nBackground section, the use of that specific variable to\ncontrol for influenza mortality may not be appropriate.\nWe compared estimates from the TL model with estimates\nfrom the current model. The TL model is based on the\nThompson model, but influenza-certified mortality is\nsubstituted for proportion positives. Although the result-\ning estimates were about a sixth higher than our estimates,\nthe seasonal pattern was highly consistent with the pat-\ntern seen with the current model. This consistency implies\nrelative robustness of excess deaths estimates to the choice\nof a specific baseline function. The vast difference between\nour and Thompson's estimates [11] can therefore not be\nexplained by differences in model structure, nor in the\nway the baseline function is modeled. They may rather be\ndue to the use of proportion of specimens testing positive\nto control for influenza mortality.\nSchanzer et al. [17], like us, used a Poisson model with\nlinear (rather than logarithmic) link function, to analyze\nweekly mortality data from Canada. Modeling weekly\nmortality has the advantage of giving higher temporal res-\nolution to the analysis. On the other hand, deaths associ-\nated with, but not attributed to influenza may occur with\nsome delay and may thus be partially decoupled from\ninfluenza-certified mortality. However, Schanzer and col-\nleagues did not find an obvious lag between weekly influ-\nenza-certified mortality and mortality due to other causes.\nFuture studies will be needed to determine what level of\ntemporal aggregation results in the best estimates.\nTo take into account random variability in influenza-cer-\ntified mortality, we used a hierarchical model. While the\npoint estimates for  (corresponding to \nobtained from a GLM are very similar to the ones\nrespectively, for 65+), the confidence limits are much\nTable 1: Age category-specific estimates for the detection ratio\n.\nAge Category Posterior Mean (95% CI)\nTable 2: Estimated Numbers of Deaths Attributable to\nmodel.\ninfluenza Year Posterior Mean (95% CI)\nTable 3: Comparison of the age-specific fit (DIC) of the current\nwith the TL model.\nAge Category Current Model TL Model\n(page number not for citation purposes)\neven be more pronounced for weekly data, where num-\nbers of influenza-certified deaths are often quite small. To\nthe extent that our hierarchical model takes into account\nrandom variability of influenza-certified deaths and thus\nleads to wider confidence limits around the resulting\nexcess mortality estimates, it is more conservative than\nnon-hierarchical GLM models.\nThe potentially most serious shortcoming of our\napproach to influenza excess mortality estimation relates\nto the possibility that influenza-certified mortality is a\npoor indicator of total influenza mortality. Although a\ndeath certificate diagnosis of influenza will likely only be\ngiven under strong suspicion of that cause, the diagnosis\nwill rarely have been laboratory-confirmed and therefore\nis likely of low specificity. As this indicator explains mor-\ntality in excess of the seasonal baseline very well one could\nspeculate that a better indicator of influenza mortality\nwould lead to even lower estimates of influenza excess\nmortality. A preliminary comparison of the number of\ninfluenza A(H3N2) isolates with influenza-certified death\nrevealed a remarkably close correspondence of the two\nindicators (Figure 5). Could it be that the number of influ-\nenza isolates informs the death certificate diagnosis? The\ncross-validation of various indicators for influenza mor-\ntality will be an important target of future research. The\nvery high proportion of all-cause mortality explained by\nour model makes it appear quite unlikely that a substan-\ntially better model of all-cause mortality can be con-\nstructed. We therefore believe that our estimates of excess\nmortality are better than previous estimates, which are\ninvariably larger than ours. Future studies of excess mor-\ntality due to influenza should also consider the possibility\nPredicted Influenza Mortality according to the Current and the TL Model, U.S., 1995\u00ad2005\nPredicted Influenza Mortality according to the Current and the TL Model, U.S., 1995\u00ad2005.

The predicted values are\nbased on the combined means from 30,000 MCMC simulations for each age category.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthat the relationship between the chosen influenza indica-\ntor and total influenza excess mortality might change\nfrom season to season or even over the season. Studies\nexamining the public health impact of influenza should\naddress some additional issues. First, mortality may not\nbe a good measure of the burden a disease inflicts upon a\npopulation. It may be that most deaths that are triggered\nby an influenza infection occur in people on the verge of\ndying from other causes, so that the time of death is\nadvanced only by a short period of time. Clearly, the bur-\nden of disease would be much lighter in that case than if\nmost people were to die from influenza prematurely by\nmany years. A more adequate measure of disease burden\ntherefore may be disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n[25]. By estimating a more refined age distribution of\nthose who died from influenza, calculations of DALYs, or\nat least of potential years of life lost (PYLL), should be rel-\natively straightforward. As persons with underlying ill-\nnesses are particularly vulnerable to fatal influenza\ninfection, and also might have reduced life expectancy at\nthe time of death, resulting PYLL estimates might be\ninflated. Second, by modeling monthly mortality inde-\npendent of mortality during previous periods we ignore,\nlike others, the demographic process that may lead to\nreduced mortality after epidemic mortality: Not only will\nlower mortality result from the depletion of the popula-\ntion at risk (smaller denominator), but influenza is also\nlikely to disproportionately affect the frailest individuals,\nthus leaving the remaining population less frail and thus\nless susceptible. The first part of this problem could be\nNumber of influenza H3N2 isolates and influenza-certified deaths, U.S., 2002 to 2004. Upper panel: Number of\nmonthly H3N2 (and proportional unsubtyped) isolates (blue, left y-axis) and influenza-certified deaths (pink, right y-axis) during\nenza-certified deaths (pink, right y-axis).\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nremedied by modeling the mortality rates rather than\nnumbers of deaths. The second one could be addressed by\nmaking specific assumptions on the frailty distribution in\nthe population and on the association between that frailty\ncharacteristic and relative mortality risk.\nConclusion\nPrevious estimates of excess mortality due to influenza\nmay be biased and inflated. We propose a two-level hier-\narchical Poisson model where the baseline mortality var-\nies with time. The goodness-of-fit statistic indicates that\nthis model fits the data very well, explaining well above\n90% of the observed variation of all-cause mortality dur-\ning the eleven years study period. The resulting estimates\nare therefore likely of high validity. Future attempts to\nquantify the public health burden of influenza should\nalso explore demographic approaches that take into\naccount life expectancy.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nIMF conceived the paper, conducted analyses and wrote\nthe manuscript.
