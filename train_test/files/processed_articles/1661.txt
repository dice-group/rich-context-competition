Our data have established two empirical findings. The first is a\nprotective main effect in the DAT1 gene against risky behaviors. The second finding is that the protective effect varies over\nage, with the effect prominent at ages when a behavior is illegal and the effect largely vanished at ages when the behavior\nbecomes legal or more socially tolerated. Both the protective main effect and the gene-lifecourse interaction effect are\nreplicated across a spectrum of most common risky behaviors: delinquency, variety of sexual partners, binge drinking,\ndrinking quantity, smoking quantity, smoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use, and seatbelt\nnon-wearing. We also compared individuals with the protective genotype and individuals without it in terms of age,\nphysical maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, received popularity, sent popularity, church attendance, two biological parents, and\nparental education. These comparisons indicate that the protective effect of DAT1*9R/9R cannot be explained away by\nthese background characteristics.

Our first objective is\nto test if the 9R/9R genotype in the VNTR of the dopamine\ntransporter gene (DAT1) has a protective effect against a spectrum\nAlthough previous work has examined the links between the DAT1\ngene and tobacco and alcohol consumption [1,2], no work has\nexamined the link with a large number of health behaviors\nsimultaneously in one single study sample: delinquency (a\ncollection of criminal behaviors), number of sexual partners, binge\ndrinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity, smoking frequency,\nmarijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use (LSD, PCP,\necstasy, mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin, or pills), and seatbelt non-\nwearing. Our second objective examines whether the strength of\nthe protection effect interacts with the lifecourse in adolescence\nand adulthood in such a way that can be explained by the age-\nspecific legal status of a behavior.\nThe Dopamine Transporter Gene (DAT1, locus symbol:\nSLC6A3) or the soluble carrier family 6 dopamine transporter\nmember three gene, codes for a dopamine transporter protein\n(DAT), which limits the level and duration of dopamine receptor\nactivation [3]. Decades of research have accumulated evidence for\nthe integral role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the\nregulation of additive and rewarding behaviors [4] and in memory\nand learning [5]. A number of animal studies have demonstrated\nthat natural rewarding stimuli such as food, drink, and sex increase\nthe in-vivo release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens [6].\nVanderbergh et al. [7] identified a polymorphic 40-bp variable\nnumber of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the DAT1 gene, which is\nmost commonly observed repeat 9 (DAT1*9R) or 10 times\n(DAT1*10R). Although the VNTR is located in a section encoding\nthe 39 untranslated region and does not change the protein's\namino acid sequence, it has been shown to have functional effects\non gene expression. Please refer to Haddley et al. [8] for an\nexcellent review on the dopamine transporter gene and addictive\nbehaviors.\nFunctional and association studies involving the dopamine\ntransporter gene is often characterized by inconsistency. For\nexample, One in-vivo study [9] reported lower levels of DAT1\nexpression in the striatal putamen for individuals with a\nDAT1*9R/10R genotype when compared to those homozygous\nopposite findings showing that higher levels of striatal DAT1\navailability in individuals with one or two 9R alleles. Three\nadditional in-vivo studies found no effect of the VNTR\npolymorphism on DAT1 density [13], protein availability [14] or\nQuite a number of studies have attempted to link the DAT1\nVNTR with addictive or risky behaviors. A 9R allele has been\nlinked with a lowered risk of smoking addiction [15,16,17]. Studies\non DAT1 and alcoholism mostly failed to demonstrate a link\nbetween the two [18,19]. Many studies of the DAT1 VNTR have\nexamined ADHD and the findings are inconsistent. Several family\ntransmission studies showed a higher prevalence in ADHD among\nstudy demonstrated an association of the 9R/10R genotype with\nmore severe symptoms of ADHD in comparison to the 10R/10R\ngenotype [26]. Still other family-based [27,28] and population-\nbased studies found no association between the VNTR and\nADHD [27,29]. Conflicting evidence may have arisen from a large\nnumber of factors such as the type of association studies (e.g.,\nfamilial versus population studies), sample size, ethnic variation,\nformulation of statistical tests, sample representation, behavior\nmeasurement and statistical controls included.\nThe issue of consistency is essentially an issue of credibility. The\nrecent stringent criteria of p-values and replications set for\ngenome-wide association studies represent a major effort to\nestablish credibility in genetic association studies. In this article,\nwe address the issue of credibility by testing the effect of a DAT1\ngenotype across a spectrum of risky behaviors in a single study\nsample. The analysis has, therefore, neutralized the potential\nimpacts produced by differences in type of studies, sample size,\nethnicity, statistical procedures, sample representation and other\nfactors and provided robust and consistent findings often lacking in\ngenetic association studies.\nThis study tests a specific hypothesis: The 9R/9R genotype in\nthe VNTR of the dopamine transporter gene exerts a general\nprotective effect against a spectrum of risky behaviors in\nof the specific hypothesis is not only the literature on the DAT1\ngene reviewed briefly in this article, but also previously published\nwork that shows specifically that individuals with the 9R/9R\ngenotype had a lower level of delinquency [30] and a smaller\nnumber of sexual partners [31] than individuals with the other two\ngenotypes. The study is designed to test if the protective of effect of\nthe DAT1 gene can be generalized to other risky behaviors.\nThe central concern for multiple testing is addressed by three\nfeatures of the study. First, the Add Health genetic dataset contains\nonly a total of five polymorphisms one in each of the five genes,\neffectively limiting the number of tests that can be performed.\nSecond, the study targets specifically at the protective effect of the\n9R/9R genotype in the dopamine transporter gene; this particular\nhypothesis was generated by previous investigation of delinquency\n[30] and number of sexual partners [31] in the same Add Health\ndataset. Three, we obtained evidence for the same genetic effect\non a spectrum of most commonly examined risky behaviors.\nTo test whether the protective effect of the DAT1*9R/9R\ngenotype can be accounted for by background characteristics, we\nalso compare individuals carrying the 9R/9R genotype with\nindividuals carrying the Any10R genotype in terms of age,\nphysical maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, popularity among peers,\nchurch attendance, family structure, and parental education.\nResults\nGenetic Main Effects\nTable 1 reports behavior and background differences between\nTwo sets of results are reported for each behavior trait and each\nbackground characteristic: one set from the sample mean\ncomparison (2nd and 3rd columns in Table 1) and the second set\nfrom regression analysis (4th column). The sample size for each\ngenotype is provided in the mean comparison. Table 1 reports the\noriginal form of the regression coefficient for the 9R/9R genotype\nwhen the regression is linear. To facilitate interpretation, we report\nthe exponentiated regression coefficient (which is odds ratio or\ncount ratio) when the regression is Poisson, logistic, or ordered\nlogistic. A verbal interpretation of these main effects is also\nprovided in Table 1.\nThe mean-comparison analysis provides initial support for the\nhypothesis that individuals with the DAT1*9R/9R genotype are\nbehaviorally more conservative than individuals with the DA-\nT1*Any10R genotype. For every risky behavior we examined, the\nmean level of risky behavior among individuals with the 9R/9R\ngenotype is lower than the level among those with the Any10R\ngenotype. We illustrate the findings with a number of examples\nbelow. The level of delinquency among the 9R/9R genotype\nIndividuals with the 9R/9R genotype have had an average of 1.49\nbinge drinking episodes versus 1.88 such episodes for individuals\nwith the Any10R genotype over the past 12 months. Similarly, the\n9R/9R individuals on average used marijuana 1.12 times over the\nindividuals. Also in agreement is the finding for seatbelt-wearing.\nThe 9R/9R adolescents reported greater seatbelt use (3.22) than\nParticipants with the 9R/9R genotype, on average, reported\ngenotypes. These numbers are averaged over the three Waves at\nwhich the measure was reported. The reported number of sexual\npartners is much smaller at Wave I when the study participants\nwere aged 12\u00ad18 than at Wave III when the study participants\nsexual partners as compared with 5.66 for the Any10R genotype.\nThe GEE regression analysis confirms the findings from the\nmean-comparison analysis. The GEE regression analysis consists\nof the main-effect analysis (fourth column in Table 1) and the\ngene-lifecourse interaction analysis. All regression models estimate\nthe effect of 9R/9R and use Any10R as the reference category.\nThe direction of the 9R/9R effect in all ten main-effect models\n(Table 1) is consistent with our hypothesis. Six out of the ten\nestimated main effects are statistically significant at the level of\n0.05 or lower. Three out of ten are significant at 0.10 and one has\na P-value of 0.14. The lower half of Table 1 presents the estimated\ndifferences between the 9R/9R genotype and the Any10R\ngenotype in background characteristics. Out of the ten character-\nistics, only the verbal IQ differs significantly between the two\ngenotype groups. The difference is small: on average, the 9R/9R\ngenotype scores about 2% higher than the Any10R genotype.\nFigure 1 plots the main effect of the Any10R genotype relative\nto the 9R/9R genotype for the ten risky behaviors. The results for\ndelinquency and seatbelt usage are based on linear regression. For\nDAT1 Gene, Behaviors & the Law\nthese two behaviors, the estimated level of behavior is plotted for\nthe two genotypes. For example, the levels of delinquency are 1.02\ngenotypes. The difference between 1.02 and 1.60 is statistically\nsignificant with a P-value of 0.03. For the other eight behaviors,\ncount ratios are plotted. For instance, Figure 1 plots the ratio of\nthe count for the Any10R genotype to the count of the 9R/9R\ngenotype with the count of the 9R/9R genotype set as one. For\nexample, individuals with the Any10R genotype reported about\ngenotype, and the associated P-value is 0.0015. The results\nconcerning the background characteristics are graphed in Figure 2.\nGene-Lifecourse Interaction Effects\nTable 2 presents the coefficients and their t statistics of the gene-\nlifecourse interaction models for nine risky behaviors. The\ninteraction model was not estimated for number of sexual partners\nbecause unlike the other behavior measures, number of partners\nmeasures the lifetime cumulative number of partners at each Add\nHealth Wave and is thus inappropriate for gene-lifecourse analysis.\nThe main-effect analysis forces the protective effect to be constant\nover adolescence and young adulthood, estimating an average\neffect over the age range of 13\u00ad25. If the protective effect is only\npresent in a portion of the age range and not in another, averaging\nover the effects in both portions may yield an effect which is\nweaker, less statistically significant, or statistically non-significant.\nThus, a non-significant main effect does not necessarily indicate an\nabsence of a protective effect. A gene-lifecourse interaction model\ntests if a protective effect is only present in a portion of the age\nTwo discoveries from the interaction analysis (Table 2) are\nparticularly noticeable and relevant. First, almost all of the main\neffects as well as the interaction effects are statistically significant\ndespite the fact that the interaction analysis costs one additional\nparameter. More parameters tend to decrease the level of\nsignificance, but in this case, the additional parameter increases\nthe overall significance of the model. Second, the four interaction\nmodels involving binge drinking, smoking quantity, smoking\nfrequency, and seatbelt wearing are highly significant, which\ncontrasts conspicuously with the four main-effect models involving\nthe same four outcomes in Table 1. In the main-effect models, the\neffect of 9R/9R is either marginally significant (binge drinking,\nsmoking frequency, and seatbelt wearing) or non-significant\n(smoking quantity). The two discoveries suggest presence of a\ngene-lifecourse interaction for the protective effect or that the\nstrength of the protection may indeed depend on age over\nadolescence and young adulthood.\nTo interpret the findings of the interaction analysis, we graph\nthe protective effect of the DAT1*9R/9R genotype relative to the\nDAT1*Any10R genotype as a function of age over adolescence and\nTable 1.

The lines stand for the predicted values from regression\nanalysis in Table 2. The lines in Parts 1 and 9, based on linear\nregression, represent the predicted levels of delinquency and\nseatbelt wearing, respectively. Parts 2 through 8, based on Passion\nregression, present the predicted count of a particular behavior.\nFor example, Parts 6\u00ad8 plot the number of times that study\nparticipants used an illicit drug over the previous 30 days. The\nprevalence is reflected by both the level of the lines and the unit on\nthe vertical axis. For instance, the prevalence rate of marijuana use\nis about 10 times as high as cocaine use.\nThe nine graphs display a small number of patterns of the gene-\nlifecourse interaction. For binge drinking, drinking quantity,\nsmoking quantity, and smoking frequency, the protective effect\nof 9R/9R diminishes in young adulthood. In contrast, the\nprotective effect remains large in both adolescence and young\nadulthood for marijuana use and other illegal drugs and increases\nsharply for cocaine use. For seatbelt wearing, the protective effect\nbecomes prominent only after the ages of 17\u00ad18. In the next\nsection, we show that all of these gene-lifecourse interaction\npatterns can be explained by a single societal factor.\nDiscussion\nOne intriguing insight from this analysis is that all of the\npatterns of gene-lifecourse interactions exhibited in Figure 3 can\nbe explained by one single factor: the age-specific legal status of\nthe behaviors or the age-specific social tolerance for the behaviors.\nTable 2.

The protective effect of the DAT1*9R/9R genotype relative to the DAT1*Any10R genotype depends on age in adolescence\nand young adulthood: Parts 1\u00ad9.\nDAT1 Gene, Behaviors & the Law\nThe common pattern of lifecourse-gene interaction for binge\ndrinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity, and smoking\nfrequency can be explained by the legal age for alcohol and\nsmoking. In all of these cases, the protective effect is more\nprominent during adolescence when drinking and smoking are\nillegal than during young adulthood when drinking and smoking\nare becoming legal and more accepted.\nThe National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 required\nthat all states to raise the legal age for purchase and public\npossession of alcohol to 21 and tied this to the highway funds [32].\nAll 50 states in the U.S. attempt to limit youth access to cigarettes\nby banning sales to individuals younger than 18 or 19 years old\n[33,34]. In spite of these alcohol and tobacco laws, under-age\ndrinking and smoking are common in the U.S. [35]. Our empirical\nevidence shows that underage drinking and smoking do not\nhappen randomly. Individuals with the 9R/9R genotype are less\nlikely to engage in drinking and smoking; however, this protective\neffect tends to diminish and disappear when drinking and smoking\nare tolerated as these individuals grow from adolescence into\nyoung adulthood. In young adulthood, more legally and socially\ntolerated drinking and smoking are not considered as risky as in\nadolescence.\nThe pattern of gene-lifecourse interaction for illicit drug use\n(Parts 6\u00ad8) can also be explained by the same legal/social factor.\nIllegal drugs in this study are measured by three variables:\nmarijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs. These illicit drugs differ from\nalcohol and tobacco in at least two important aspects [36]. First,\ncompared with the age-specific legal restrictions for the possession\nand sale of alcohol and tobacco, these drugs are decidedly illegal\nand illegal for all ages. Second, the prevalence rates of these drugs\nare much lower than alcohol and tobacco. Marijuana is by far the\nmost commonly used illicit drug in the United States and\nworldwide; still, the possession and sale of any quantity of\nmarijuana is prohibited by federal law in all but twelve states. In\ncontrast to drinking and smoking, where the protective effect of\n9R/9R quickly diminishes beyond adolescence because of legal\nand social acceptance of drinking and smoking in young\nadulthood, the protective effect of 9R/9R for illicit drug use\ncontinues beyond adolescence because illicit drug use in young\nadulthood is no more socially and legally tolerated than in\nadolescence.\nSeatbelt wearing represents a third pattern of gene-lifecourse\ninteraction. The much larger protective effect of 9R/9R after the\nages of 15\u00ad16 is not accidental; it can be explained by the legal\ndriving age of 16 in the United States. The legal driving age is\nmuch more observed than the legal age for alcohol and/or\ntobacco probably because the access to a car is much harder than\nalcohol/tobacco and because the perceived consequences of\ndriving a car below the legal age are more severe than using\nalcohol and tobacco below the legal age. Before the legal driving\nage, an adolescent is not driving, and his or her friends are likely\nnot driving. An adolescent under the legal driving age is much\nmore likely to be under a supervision of an adult than when he or\nshe is over 16 when he or she would have much greater freedom to\ndecide whether to wear a seatbelt, hence the increased protective\neffect after age 16.\nDelinquency represents a distinct case. The protective effect of\n9R/9R against delinquency is most pronounced during the early\nand mid adolescence; it declines thereafter (Part 1 in Figure 3).\nThe delinquency scale is designed to capture a wide range of\nserious illegal behaviors that could result in state sanction of arrest,\nconviction, and incarceration. That delinquency is illegal at all\nages suggests a constant protective effect across ages. However,\nunlike alcohol use, tobacco use, and illicit drug use, which peak in\nyoung adulthood, delinquency reaches the highest level in\nadolescence. The sharp decline of delinquency from adolescence\nto young adulthood has been observed and documented\nuniversally in different cultures and across historical time [37].\nPart 1 in Figure 3 shows that the level of delinquency declines\nsharply for both the Any10R genotype and the 9R/9R genotype,\nmore so for the former than the latter. Our interpretation of the\ngene-lifecourse interaction is: The universal and dramatic\nreduction in delinquency beyond adolescence is itself an immense\nprotective factor. The age protection is so large that it renders the\nprotection of 9R/9R less noteworthy.\nIn summary, our data have revealed two empirical findings: (1)\nA protective effect related to the DAT1 gene against risky\nbehaviors is consistently found for delinquency, variety of sexual\npartners, binge drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity,\nsmoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug\nuse, and seatbelt non-wearing; and (2) the strength of the\nprotective effect varies over ages in adolescence and young\nadulthood, being strong at the ages when the particular behavior is\nillegal and weakening at the ages when the particular behavior\nbecomes legal or more socially tolerated.\nThe protective effects exhibit stronger statistical significance in\nthe gene-lifecourse interaction models than in the main effect\nmodels because the interaction model allows the protective effect\nto be more important at some ages than others. The main effect\nmodel forces the protective effect to be constant across all ages in\nadolescence and young adulthood. We also examined the question\nof whether the individuals in the two genotype groups (9R/9R and\nAny10R) systematically differ in age, level of physical maturity,\nverbal IQ, grade point average, received popularity, sent\npopularity, church attendance, presence of two biological parents\nin household, and level of parental education. The two genotype\ngroups differ only in one of these background traits: The 9R/9R\nindividuals score about 2% higher on a verbal IQ than the\nAny10R ones. The lack of differences in background traits\nbetween the two genotype groups suggests that the protective\neffect of 9R/9R cannot be explained away by non-genetic\ninfluences at the individual and familial levels.\nThese two pieces of empirical evidence suggest the protective\neffect as a general effect concerning risk aversion or behavior\nconservatism. The evidence does not support the argument that\nDAT1 is a gene specifically for craving alcohol or tobacco, an\nappetite for sexual partner variety, or a propensity for violence for\nthree reasons. First, quite different biochemical mechanisms may\nbe at work for alcohol craving, tobacco addiction, sexual\npreference, or violent inclination. A single genetic variant in\nDAT1 is unlikely to be responsible for all the biochemical processes\nthat underlie such a variety of behaviors. Second, the large\nmajority of white males (94%) belong to the ``higher risk'' group of\nthe Any10R genotype. Although this group scored higher on all of\nthe ten risky behavior measures investigated in this study, it is\nmore appropriate to view this large majority as representative of\nthe population average. It is the 6% possessing the 9R/9R\ngenotype that stand out as behavioral conservatives or straight\narrows. Third, the idea of a general protective effect of the 9R/9R\ngenotype is further strengthened by the findings from the gene-age\ninteractions. The findings show that the protection of the genotype\nis sensitive to a general level of legal tolerance. These findings\ngenerate a further hypothesis that can be tested in future work: It is\nbeyond adolescence when drinking and smoking become legal that\nbehaviors such as drinking and smoking be governed more and\nmore by genes related to specific drug addiction processes.\nDick and colleagues [38] investigated the role of the GABRA2\ngene in alcohol and illicit drug dependence across developmental\nDAT1 Gene, Behaviors & the Law\nstages using a COGA-based sample. Our findings appear in\nagreement with theirs. In their sample, the gene is associated with\nalcohol dependence at ages of 15\u00ad20; but this association\ndiminishes in early 20s. GABRA2 also affects illicit drug\ndependence in their sample in both adolescence and later life\nstages.\nTwo goals of genetic association studies are (1) to find credible\nevidence linking genetic variations to human traits and (2) to\nunderstand the contexts of such a link. Major headway has been\nmade recently for the first target via genome-wide association\nstudies (GWAS). A recent succession of GWAS identified genetic\nvariants associated with a number of human diseases [e.g.,\ngenetic variants--effects that are averaged over a large number of\nindividuals. Understanding the context in which a genetic effect\noperates is not a primary target in GWAS.\nOur analysis has made significant headway towards both targets\nof providing credible evidence and understanding the context of\nsuch an effect for genetic association studies. The credibility of\nevidence is established by demonstrating a similar protective effect\nacross a spectrum of ten risky behavior traits measured on the\nsame set of individuals. Our work has demonstrated how\ninformation such as lifecourse of risky behaviors could be used\nto help illuminate the legal, social, and cultural contexts in which a\ngenetic effect operates.\nA number of limitations should be noted. We were able to\nexamine only one VNTR in the DAT1 gene. Other variants within\nDAT1 or elsewhere that are in LD with the VNTR may be the\ncausal behavior-influencing variants. The likelihood is high that\nsome other genetic variants that are not in LD with DAT1 traits\nalso affect the set of risky health behaviors we have examined. We\nare not able to examine CNV and epigenetic variations in this\nstudy. Finally, although we have replicated our basic results across\na large number of risky behaviors, these findings need to be\nreplicated in other independent datasets.\nMethods\nData Source\nThe data source for our analysis is the DNA sub-sample of\n2,500 siblings in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health), which initiated as a nationally representative\nsample is stratified by region of the country, ethnic mix, size,\nurbanicity (urban/suburban/rural), and school type (public/\nprivate/parochial). Add Health is longitudinal; initial interviews\nwith respondents were followed by two additional in-home\nanalysis uses the sibling sub-sample of Add Health because DNA\nthis subset of the respondents. The subset consists of about\n2,500 MZ twins, DZ twins, full biological siblings, and singletons.\nThe present study is based on about 822 Non-Hispanic white\nmales in Add Health. The sample size varies moderately across\nbehavior traits and Add Health Waves, depending on the extent of\nmissing values. This study focuses on males because males and\nfemales often exhibit large differences in the investigated\nbehaviors. For example, female delinquent and criminal partici-\npation has been shown to be universally and dramatically lower\nthan that of males [45]. Mice transgenic or knockout studies of\naggressive behavior show that genetic influences are often sex-\nspecific [46]. The present study focuses on Caucasians and\nexcludes other ethnicities to reduce the potential impact of\npopulation admixture. The role of a gene can differ sharply across\nethnic/racial groups. In Add Health, other ethnic groups\nincluding Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and Native\nAmericans jointly account for about 35% of the cohort.\nDNA Preparation and Genotyping\nAt Wave III in 2002, in collaboration with the Institute for\nBehavioral Genetics in Boulder, Colorado, Add Health collected,\nextracted, and quantified DNA samples from the sibling sub-\nsample. Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells using a\nmodification of published methods [47,48,49]. The additional\ndetails on DNA collection and genotyping are provided at the Add\nHealth website (Smolen and Hewitt, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/\nprojects/addhealth/).\nA 40-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymor-\nphism in the 39 untranslated region of the DAT1 gene has been\ngenotyped with the modified method used by Vandenbergh et al\nbeing the two most common alleles [50]. In the Add Health sibling\nalleles, respectively. Our analysis used only individuals with\ngenotypes of one 10R, two 10Rs, and two 9Rs. The individuals\nwith other genotypes (about 2%) are excluded from the analysis.\nRisky Behaviors\nThis study examines a spectrum of ten risky behaviors (see\nIntroduction for a list). The measures of risky behaviors are\nintended to capture behavioral patterns rather than accidental,\nincidental, or isolated events. For example, for alcohol or tobacco\nuse, we are interested in the quantity that is used consistently\nrather than the timing of the first trial, which can be an isolated\nevent.\nSimilar to almost all large-scale human studies, Add Health\nrelies on self-reports to measure behaviors. To protect confiden-\ntiality, reduce non-responses, and increase reporting accuracy, the\ninterview sections focusing on risky behaviors in Add Health are\nself-administered by audio-CASI (Computer Assisted Self Inter-\nview). A sensitive question is read to respondents from an\nelectronic voice and respondents then confidentially enter their\nresponse into a laptop computer. This technique has been shown\nto increase response rates and reduce biases when sensitive\nfundamental method of behavior measuring and seem capable\nof yielding reliable and valid data [54].\nMost of the behaviors we investigate are measured repeatedly\non the same study participants across all three Add Health Waves.\nThe study analyzes all the repeated measures and makes\ncorresponding statistical adjustments. Table 3 describes each of\nthe behavior and background variables used in the analysis. The\ndescription provides the variable definition; information on how\nthe variable is constructed; the sample mean/proportion and its\nsample size at each of the three Add Health Waves; and the\nsample mean/proportion, standard deviation, and sample size of\nthe overall Add Health sample that contains all the repeated\nmeasures at Waves I\u00adIII. Thus, the sample size of the overall\nsample (the last column) should be equal to the sum of the three\nsamples from Waves I\u00adIII.\nDelinquency measures delinquent behaviors including violent\nbehaviors among adolescents and young adults. The construct is\nbased on 12 questions asked of all the Add Health respondents at\nWaves I\u00adIII. The questions and scaling weights used to create the\nscale can be found in Guo et al. [55].

Our final analysis\nfile consists of 2,407 person-measures of delinquency. The\ndelinquency scale is a variation of a widely-used type of scales in\ncontemporary research on delinquency and criminal behavior\nNumber of Sexual Partners is based on the answer to the question of\n``With how many partners have you ever had vaginal intercourse,\neven if only once?'' The question was repeated at Waves I\u00adIII.\nTwo alcohol-related measures are investigated in this analysis:\nbinge drinking and drinking quantity. Both are measured three times in\nAdd Health. Binge drinking is constructed from the question ``Over\nthe past 12 months, on how many days did you drink five or more\ndrinks in a row?'' Drinking quantity measures the typical number of\ndrinks a respondent consumes each time he or she drinks.\nSmoking quantity is a measure of number of cigarettes a\nrespondent smokes on the days he or she smokes. Smoking frequency\nrecords the number of days a respondent smoked cigarettes over\nthe past 30 days. The three variables of illegal drug use (marijuana,\ncocaine, and other illegal drugs) measure the number of times a\nrespondent has used the drug(s) over the past 30 days. Other illegal\ndrugs refer to LSD, PCP, ecstasy, mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin,\nand/or pills. The two smoking measures and the three measures of\nillegal drug use are all collected at Add Health Waves I\u00adIII. Seatbelt\nwearing is included in the analysis because not wearing a seatbelt\nrepresents a risky behavior. The variable is based on the question\nof how often a respondent wears a seatbelt when riding in or\ndriving a motor vehicle. The question was asked at Add Health\nWaves I\u00adII.\nBackground Characteristics\nTo provide further evidence that the differences in the ten\nbehaviors are a result of the variations in the DAT1 VNTR\nrather than the differences in other individual and socioeco-\nnomic characteristics, we examined the differences in an array of\nbackground characteristics between those with the 9R/9R\ngenotype and those with the Any10R genotype. The following\nsection briefly describes the construction of these background\nvariables. Age is calculated from interview year and month as\nwell as year and month of birth. To protect participants'\nconfidentiality, Add Health does not disclose interview day and\nbirth day of a participant. Physical maturity is from the self-\nassessment of physical development compared to other boys of\nsame age.\nVerbal IQ or the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) is a\nslightly shortened version of the standard Peabody Picture\nVocabulary Test [56,57], which is usually considered a verbal\nIQ test. GPA, grade point average, is an average of self-reported\ngrades in English and mathematics. One of the main innovations\nof the Add Health study is in the area of social network data\ncollection. In the in-school study at Wave I, a brief interview was\nadministered to all students in a school, in which Add Health\nparticipants were asked to nominate up to 5 same-sex and 5\nopposite-sex friends starting from the best friend. Popularity received,\nor the social prestige of an adolescent, is measured by the number\nof times the respondent was nominated by other students in\nschool. Popularity sent is measured by the number of friends the\nrespondent nominated.\nChurch attendance is created from the self-reported frequency at\nwhich a study participant attended religious services in the past 12\nmonths. Presence of two biological parents in the household at the time\nof interview is constructed from information on family structure at\neach Add Health Wave. Parental education records the higher level of\neducation of father and mother.\nStatistical Methods\nOur analytical method consists of two steps: a mean or\nproportion comparison and a regression analysis. The mean-\ncomparison analysis compares the levels of risky behaviors\nbetween the 9R/9R genotype and the Any10R genotype. No\nstatistical test is carried out in the mean comparison analysis\nbecause standard tests are not valid due to the correlations among\nthe observations from sibling clustering and repeated measures of\nthe same individuals at Add Health Waves.\nWave I Wave II Wave III Waves I\u00adIII\nDefinition Variable Construction Mean(N) Mean(N) Mean(N) Mean(SD)(N)\nChurch attendance In the past 12 months, how often\ndid you attend religious services?\n0 = never;\n1,once a month\n2 = .once a month\n3 = .once a week\nTreated as an ordered\nvariable\nTwo biological\nParents\nConstructed from information family\nstructure\nParental education How far in school did your biological\nfather go? How far in school did your\nbiological mother go?\n1,high school\n2 = high school\n3,less than college\n4 = .college\nCoded as an ordered\nvariable (the higher of\nthe two)\nTable 3. Cont.\nDAT1 Gene, Behaviors & the Law\nThe regression analysis uses generalized estimating equation\n(GEE) models to estimate the association between the DAT1\nVNTR and risky behaviors [58]. The GEE analysis can be viewed\nas a statistically appropriate mean comparison. It addresses the\ncorrelations among the siblings in the dataset, adjusts for age, and\ncarries out the comparison. GEE models have long been\nestablished in the statistical literature as a standard approach for\naddressing correlated data. Our outcome variables for regression\nanalysis have different statistical distributions. For example, age\nand PVT are approximately normal; number of sexual partners is\nPoisson; church attendance is an ordered categorical variable, and\npresence of two biological parents is binary. All of these outcome\nvariables can be accommodated readily in the GEE modeling\nframework.\nThe following equation describes the general form of the GEE\nmodel in our analysis:\ng(mijt\nagejit\nji\nWhere i, j, and t index individual, sibling cluster, and Add\nHealth Wave, respectively; mijt\n~E(yijt\n); yijt is an observed risky\nbehavior or background characteristic; g(mijt\n)~mijt\nwhen yijt is a\ncontinuous outcome; g(mijt\n)~ log (mijt\n) when yijt is a count\nvariable; and g(mijt\n)~ log (mijt\n) when yijt is a binary\noutcome variable. The correlation structure in the sample is\naddressed by a three-level GEE model with level 1 for Add Health\nWave or repeated measures of the same individual, level 2 for\nindividuals, and level 3 for sibling clusters.\nTo test whether the protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype\ninteracts with lifecourse, we include a gene-age interaction term in\nthe model\ng(mijt\nlog (age)jit\nji\n\u00bdlog (age)jit\n,\nwhere age is modeled on a logarithm scale for two reasons. Log(age)\ncan capture a non-linear effect and with one parameter, Log(age) is\nmore parsimonious than the more usual alternative age and age2.\nThe gene-lifecourse interaction patterns will be illustrated by\ngraphing.\nOur analysis sample includes only white males, thus eliminating\nthe concern for population admixture at the level of race/\nethnicity. The white males were drawn from 134 schools across the\nUS and are representative of all white males in the country.\nMissing data were addressed by case-wise deletion rather than\nimputation. For example, the number of observations across the\nthree Add Health waves is not the same (Table 3), that is, not all\nindividuals were interviewed at all three waves. Our analysis\nemployed all available observations at all waves without imputing\nthe missing observations.\nInstitutional Review Board and Consent of Respondents\nThe Add Health study was reviewed and approved by the IRB\nat the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill before each wave\nof data collection. In addition, Add Health obtained written\nconsent at all waves from either the respondent or the parent if the\nrespondent was under age 18. Regarding the consent for\ngenotyping, Wave III respondents were informed that ``Your\nDNA will be used to learn how closely you are related to your\nbrother or sister and to study the influence of your genetic makeup\non your mind, body, and behavior. Specimens will be stored for as\nlong as they are usable and used only for these research purposes.''\n"
