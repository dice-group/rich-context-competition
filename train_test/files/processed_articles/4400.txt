CBPR also strives to use transparent and equitable\ndecision-making structures, open writing and publishing processes, maximum\nattention to the marginalization that communities face, maximum respect for com-\nmunity knowledge, and a full commitment to community engagement and action\nStoeker (2012) notes that CBPR is offering communities access to the\n`knowledge-power' loop, thereby positioning them as creators of knowledge rather\nthan passive recipients of so-called `expert' knowledge, which can be inaccurate and\noppressive. Yet, as CBPR gains credibility, new questions are emerging about the\ninherent challenges in operationalizing its principles (Stoeker, 2012; Travers et al.,\n2008). For example, while CBPR appears to address ethical considerations and\nquestions, such as whether communities are consenting to, benefiting from, or\nbeing harmed by research (Guta et al., 2010), questions remain about who is\nreally in control of the agenda in CBPR. For example, Jacobs (2010) speaks to the\nneed to `truly empower' community members by being open to them as `co-thinkers'\nand `co-organizers' at all stages of a research project, in order to be really successful.\nCritical questions about real and meaningful community participation in CBPR\nhave been raised through Stoeker's (2012) analysis of funding protocols to a\nUS-based funder of action-oriented research. Community-based organizations or\ncommunity members were rarely involved in helping to define research questions or\nstudy methods, and few studies explicitly linked research goals to action-oriented\noutcomes. Indeed, the greatest involvement of community members was likely to\noccur during data collection, raising significant doubts about any meaningful\npower sharing between community and academic partners (Stoeker, 2012).\nTravers et al. (2008) found a similar set of challenges facing Ontario's HIV/\nAIDS sector, despite its reputation as being an international leader in CBPR.\nCommunity members tended to be more involved in knowledge dissemination\nstages of research, while academic researchers were in greatest control during\nstudy formulation and data collection stages (Travers et al., 2008).\n`The right amount of community participation'?\nFor some time now, academics have attempted to theorize models of citizen par-\nticipation that would move lay people from tokenistic roles in partnerships with\nacademics into roles characterized by greater decision-making and power-sharing.\nArticulating a typology of citizen participation, Arnstein (1969) differentiates the\namount and depth of citizen participation according to gradations of non-\nparticipation, tokenism, and citizen power. Pretty, Guijt, Thompson, and\nScoones (1995) offer another model with `no participation' on one end of the\nspectrum of involvement and `self-mobilization' of community on the other. Ray\n(2007) distinguishes between `traditional' (community members provide informa-\ntion), `consumerist' (community members are there for researchers to achieve their\nend goals) and `democratic' (a model of community involvement in research part-\nnerships, where the latter attempts to redistribute power. Common to all CBPR\nmodels are the democratic and empowering characteristics of community engage-\nment, and a genuine desire to challenge dominant power arrangements (Jacobs,\n2010). However, at one end of the CBPR spectrum are more `traditional' forms of\nresearch processes that value community input while academic researchers retain\ncontrol, ownership and management. At the other end, are newer forms of CBPR\nthat position community members as `owners' (instead of `partners') of projects.\nThe `Community Owned and Managed Research Model' (Heaney, Wilson, &\nWilson, 2007) is just one example of such an approach in which communities\nretain control, ownership and management, while choosing academic partners\nand `valuing' their input through collaborative memoranda of understanding.\nWhile `community-owned' research is gaining in popularity as a new frontier in\nCBPR, reflections on some of its successes and challenges will be helpful in enhan-\ncing the work of future CBPR teams.\nMethod\nThis article describes the strategy and approach used by an Ontario, Canada,\nCBPR collaborative \u00ad Trans PULSE \u00ad to develop and implement a project that\nwas firmly committed to prioritizing community needs and concerns, valuing lived\nexperience, and attending to action outcomes. On the CBPR spectrum, Trans\nPULSE has committed to (and operationalized) community control, while retain-\ning funding and management within academic settings in order to work within\nestablished bureaucratic frameworks. In presenting this strategy, we attempt to\nprovide a concrete example of one way of conceptualizing and operationalizing a\nCBPR project \u00ad one in which discourse was, from the beginning, less about `com-\nmunity engagement' and much more about `community control'. We describe the\nhistory of the project, as well as the development of its innovative community\nengagement and capacity-building strategies. Through a process of retrospective\nreflection, we offer some of the important lessons learned along the way about this\napproach, and some questions for other CBPR teams to consider in their own\nwork. The authorship of this paper is made up of a mixture of academic research-\ners, community investigators and students from Trans PULSE.\nOur individual and collective reflections, which incorporate learnings from con-\nversations throughout the project are represented throughout. Given that we rep-\nresent a subset of Trans PULSE, and that we as authors experienced the project as\nindividuals within a larger group dynamic, it is important to note that differing\ninterpretations of a similar issue or phenomenon may exist but we were able to\narrive at consensus in this article. As such, we are reticent to make bold conclusions\nsuch as `x caused y', and instead, we draw upon the wisdom provided by others in\nthe literature to frame our understanding of phenomena that are actually, at times,\nquite complex.\nKey aspects of community ownership in the Trans\nPULSE project\nTrans PULSE is an innovative, mixed-methods, CBPR project that responds to\nproblems and concerns identified within Ontario trans1 communities regarding\nhealth and access to health and mental health services. The project is particularly\ncentered around understanding the ways in which social exclusion, cisnormativity\n(the belief that trans identities or bodies are less authentic or `normal'), and trans-\nphobia shape the health of, and provision of services for, trans people in Ontario.\nSome of Trans PULSE's focus areas include: employment and income, housing,\nhealth care, transition-related care, relationships and family, sexual health, HIV\nvulnerability, mental health, community connectedness, and access to social ser-\nvices. The team has a successful history of funding from foundations and provincial\nand federal granting bodies,2 and of production of research results for multiple\naudiences.3 Prior studies with trans people in other regions have found that trans\npeople's health is profoundly affected by disproportionately high rates of violence\nand harassment (Lombardi, Wilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2001), employment dis-\ncrimination and job loss (Minter & Daley, 2003), and discrimination in the provi-\nsion of health and social services (Namaste, 2000). From the inception of Trans\nPULSE, a commitment was made to undertake research that respects this lived\nexperience, the resilience and capacity of trans communities, and community\nknowledge and needs.\nThe Trans PULSE community engagement strategy includes both research and\naction stages, and builds on the theoretical model proposed by Paez-Victor (2002).\nThe stages of this model include input (activities related to study initiation and\ndesign), process (activities related to data collection, analysis and interpretation)\nand outcome (activities related to dissemination and social action). In developing\nthe model, particular attention was paid to the roles of community members in each\nstage of the research process, as well as issues related to community control, power-\nsharing, and social action; indeed, the project's tag line is `Trans PULSE: Building\nOur Communities Through Research'. Three central principles have informed the\ncommunity engagement strategy for Trans PULSE: 1) community initiation; 2)\ncontinual building of capacity; and 3) community control (versus community\nengagement) over each project stage. The third central principle, community own-\nership, forms the core of the project and this article. It is evidenced in part by com-\nmunity initiation, and informs the need for community capacity-building. However,\nthe impacts of community ownership go far beyond these principles.\nCommunity initiation of the research project\nUnlike most CBPR initiatives, Trans PULSE was driven by community members\nsince its nascent stages. Trans PULSE was initiated by a group of trans community\nmembers and a cisgender4 ally, and was supported by a municipally funded LGBT\ncommunity centre and a provincially funded community health centre with a man-\ndate to provide primary health care to LGBT communities in Toronto. As a first\nstep, the initial group sought additional community team members through an\napplication process, and then following that added academic partners.\nCommunity members interviewed and selected research partners from academic\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations based upon five distinct criteria:\n1) their ability to be allies; 2) their ability to bring resources to the project; 3) their\nhistory of progressive forms of LGBT research; 4) their potential to let trans people\nbe experts in their own issues; and 5) their ability to provide research-related\nexpertise and skills for building a sound and rigorous study design for future\nphases of Trans PULSE. While not all of the initial Trans PULSE members saw\nthemselves as investigators, the shift in thinking happened quickly as CBPR-\nfriendly funders (who welcomed non-academic, community co-investigators)\nwere identified, and successfully applied to. Over eight years, this community\u00ad\nacademic partnership was built, and when some community investigators left\nothers were recruited to replace them. Based on community feedback we received,\npriority was placed on recruiting new investigators who were trans members from\nracialized communities.\nBuilding knowledge upon lived experience\nTrans community members were instrumental in defining the research project's\noverall goals and objectives, as well as its theoretical framework. Most centrally,\ncommunity priorities directed us to move beyond individualistic explanations for,\nand accounts of, health; instead, we prioritized a `social determinants of health'\n(Raphael, 2009) lens in our research. Two community investigators were hired as\npart-time research coordinators to manage the workload during this stage of the\nproject; through this experience, these coordinators developed the skills and cap-\nacity required to undertake and organize complex CBPR projects. Through dis-\ncussions among the Investigators' Committee (IC), we created research goals,\nobjectives, and questions, and selected appropriate and sensitive methodologies\nfor subsequent stages of the research. Taking direction from community soundings\n(focus groups) that we held in select Ontario cities, the IC felt strongly that research\nmethods be used that allowed for the voices and concerns of trans people to be\nheard, in addition to dispelling the myth that trans people exist in negligible num-\nbers. Consequently, a mixed methods approach was chosen for Trans PULSE. The\nIC collectively felt that the use of the most rigorous methods possible was import-\nant for ensuring that we could produce results that would be less likely to be\ndismissed. An approach was chosen which combined respondent-driven sampling\n(Heckathorn, 2002) with subsequent qualitative interviews. Once these decisions\nwere made, a collaborative funding proposal was developed and submitted. It was\nsuccessful and the survey phase of Trans PULSE commenced.\nSurvey design: Prioritizing `community knowledge'\nThe process of developing the Trans PULSE survey tool offered further opportun-\nity for community input, capacity development, and community control. Building\nupon the items that were identified as important research priorities during the\ncommunity soundings, IC members spent a number of sessions together as a\nteam in order to identify further priorities for research. Drawing upon their lived\nexperiences, community IC members offered many directions for the content of the\nsurvey tool, and participated in bringing the survey to fruition. The resulting tool\nwas comprehensive in its scope, and community IC members were able to see\nfirsthand how `lived experience' and other forms of community knowledge can\nbe drawn upon to shape the content and design of a research tool.\nSteering committee membership and decision-making\nThe Trans PULSE IC has had majority trans community representation and\ncontrol from its beginning. Each IC member has been assigned an equal voice,\nirrespective of their academic or organizational affiliation, and each has been\ndesignated as an investigator on at least one project funding application. The\nfact that early stages were driven by non-academic trans community members\nhas been pivotal in shaping a culture of community control that has continued\ninto subsequent phases of Trans PULSE. In its earliest stages, the Trans\nPULSE team agreed to a Terms of Reference (TOR), a contract that guides the\nwork of the project. Stressing community integration, community control and\ncapacity-building in all project phases, the TOR functions as a memorandum of\nunderstanding, stating guiding principles, decision-making processes, team member\nroles and responsibilities, and policies for accessing data. An element of note is that\nthe TOR mandates that trans community investigators will always constitute a\nmajority of the Investigators' Committee, and must be present in majority numbers\n(50% plus one) for major project decisions. This helps to ensure that we prioritize\ncommunity ownership in Trans PULSE in ways that go beyond typical CBPR\ninitiatives.\nBroadening community input\nDespite the fact that the majority of the Trans PULSE IC comprised trans com-\nmunity members, we recognized that the IC did not represent the diversity of trans\npeople or `trans experience' in a province as large and populous as Ontario.\nWanting to ensure a representation of community experience beyond our IC, the\nteam held `community soundings' to hear priority issues and concerns from\n85 trans people and four allies in three Ontario cities (Ottawa, Guelph and\nToronto). Trans members of the IC also contributed their lived experience to the\ndevelopment of an online sounding for service providers, by determining the key\ntopic areas to be covered. Professionals and providers who worked with trans\ncommunity members were consulted through this survey to help us identify their\nknowledge and training needs in relation to working with trans clients.\nTo ensure even broader community input into Trans PULSE, a Community\nEngagement Team (CET) was established, to provide many things, including: guid-\nance into the development of the project's survey tools and interview guides, access\nto relevant geographically dispersed trans networks, strategic advice on project\noutreach and promotion, and direction and guidance on a `knowledge to action'\nstrategy for social change. The CET was comprised of 16 well-connected trans\npeople, who were selected through a province-wide application process. They\nreflected (as best as possible) Ontario's geographic, ethno-racial, newcomer\nstatus, and age diversity, as well as a diversity of trans identities. The CET\nserved as an alternative set of eyes and voices from the community, and functioned\nas `seeds' (that is, as the first people to complete the survey) in the respondent-\ndriven sampling data collection strategy. Overall, having the CET as the public face\nand voice of the project during the data collection part of the survey stage, helped\nto communicate the importance of community involvement and control in Trans\nPULSE to the broader trans community. The CET was a crucial component of\nTrans PULSE. It balanced our intention to engage a diverse array of trans com-\nmunities in Ontario with the pragmatic limitations of doing research. Bringing\npeople from across a province as large as Ontario together for regular meetings\nand ongoing time-consuming work was difficult and expensive; the limited com-\nmitment expected of CET members allowed for important contributions from\npeople who may not be able to make the commitment to the more intensive\ninvolvement required of IC membership.\nSurvey promotion\nThe project's Community Development Coordinator, as well as trans IC and CET\nmembers, led the promotion of the survey. Given that respondent-driven sampling\n(RDS) had not been previously used in trans communities, IC members developed\nrecruitment strategies both prior to initiation of the survey, and during recruitment\nwhen strategy adaptation appeared to be necessary. In fact, the creation of the CET\nitself was a strategy to attempt to engender greater trust and community `buy-in' so\nthat participants would both complete the lengthy survey and feel motivated to\nrecruit other participants, as was necessary given the methodology we selected.\nCET members independently held information sessions in their communities, and\ndeveloped a promotional video (available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv\u00bcbqbVw4Vzpi4). A Facebook group further aided project promotion and recruit-\nment. In-person and teleconference meetings were held with community leaders\nfrom communities throughout Ontario. A toll-free phone line allowed any commu-\nnity member to reach us with questions or comments. The success of our survey\nrecruitment strategy \u00ad especially given the length of the survey \u00ad was due to con-\ntinued contact with community members, and promotion by community members.\nKnowledge transfer and community accountability\nTrans PULSE team members see ourselves, first and foremost, as being accountable\nto trans people in Ontario. We regard ourselves as `stewards of lived experience',\nwho have an ethical obligation to return research findings to trans community and to\ndecision-makers who are able to implement change. As such, we have presented at\nnumerous conferences, released a number of e-bulletins and targeted reports high-\nlighting key data (e.g. statistics on suicide and violence rates, key demographics, and\nrates of employment and discrimination), used data in numerous workshop presen-\ntations, and published papers in peer-reviewed journals.\nData collection using the Trans PULSE survey tool took place between May\naddressing the most comprehensive list of health, mental health, and quality of life\nissues measured with trans people to date in Canada. Analysis and knowledge\ntranslation and exchange are underway, and will continue for several years. We\nconsider these remarkable accomplishments that can be directly attributed to the\nprinciples we have implemented and upheld since the project's inception.\nBuilding community capacity\nCommunity capacity-building has been prioritized in Trans PULSE as a means to\nmake positive change for trans communities. Capacity-building was prioritized\nbased on two factors: a desire for community members to have the opportunity\nto learn to use more formal forms of knowledge production in their social action\nresearch, and to ensure that when the project ended, tangible skills would be left\nbehind in the community to be put toward further research and social change.\nCapacity-building has been integrated through ongoing activities designed to\nenhance the capacities of the trans community to undertake research, including\nqualitative data analysis training, survey development, and group writing. Team\nmembers are also committed to more informal means of capacity-building on an\nongoing basis. Using the project's `knowledge to action' framework, formal\ncapacity-building initiatives have included an early research-to-policy think-tank,\nand in 2012, a trans health advocacy summit. Both were designed to bring together\ntrans community leaders from throughout Ontario to develop our project in a policy-\nrelevant way, and to strategize around use of project results to maximize impact.\nWhile our initial shared goal was to increase trans community capacity to under-\ntake research, and use research results to impact policy change, the project has also\nresulted in capacity-building for the academic researchers involved, both with regard\nto research methods and ability to work with trans communities. Moreover, to date,\nmore than a dozen Masters and PhD students from a number of disciplines have\ncontributed to Trans PULSE as part of formal graduate education requirements,\nincluding three trans community members undertaking graduate studies. Additional\nstudents, including trans graduate and undergraduate students, have contributed as\ninvestigators, staff, and/or Community Engagement Team members. Through these\nstudent mentorships, Trans PULSE has contributed to the development of a new\ngeneration of health and social science researchers who have skills and experience in\nCBPR, in addition to being knowledgeable about trans issues.\nReflections on Trans PULSE: Lessons learned\nAs a CBPR project, Trans PULSE is highly unique and innovative. Despite the\nconsiderable success Trans PULSE has had in implementing these guiding prin-\nciples to date, in building capacities, and in creating a project that prioritizes `com-\nmunity control', several challenges have emerged throughout the project. We\nbelieve that these are important to share, in terms of advancing CBPR theory\nand knowledge. These challenges and questions were first drafted by two of the\nproject's investigators (one trans and one cisgender) and were refined and revised\nby the other authors on this article (who constitute a trans majority). We present\nthese challenges first as issues and then as `questions' for other CBPR stakeholders\nin the field to reflect upon in their own research projects.\nChallenge 1: Power differences in academic/community partnerships\nKnowledge and power are intertwined, and research projects are inextricably\nlinked to the power relationships outside their immediate context (e.g. academic\nknowledge, in general, is held in higher regard than community knowledge).\nDespite safeguards for ensuring equity, sharing power in CBPR projects presents\nunique challenges, requiring significant anticipation and planning. Despite the fact\nthat trans community members interviewed and chose their own academic partners\nfor the study, inevitable challenges have emerged with two cisgender academics\nserving as `co-principal investigators' at the helm of Trans PULSE. The power of\nacademics is enshrined in systems set up to support research, such as positions on\ngrants, administration of funds, the complexities of research ethics boards, and the\nneed to publish in academic journals. All of these require or promote academic\nleadership of projects and establish academics as experts in areas that are not\ntypically their own lived experience. Thus, even if a project defines its power struc-\nture differently, on paper and in processes, academics must often be the formal\nproject leaders. Though community members do have power in the research pro-\ncess (for example, the power to affect community support and give a project legit-\nimacy), this power remains outside established systems. Moreover, funding bodies\nforce inherent power imbalances in CBPR by forcing research teams to choose\nwhether community members will be staff members or investigators: staff members\nare financially compensated for their time but tend to lack influence over project\ndirection, while investigators have greater decision-making power, but are typically\nnot financially compensated. Only two of our seven community investigators have\npaid work time allocated to the project by their employers. Consequently, they\nhave had more time available while others have had to forgo potential paid time on\nother activities to contribute to the project.\nOur attempt to mediate these power imbalances has been through our Terms of\nReference, through trans people forming the majority of the investigators, and also\nthrough capacity-building, where numerous opportunities have been available to\nwrite and present, to receive training about technical research skills, to be able to\nengage in conversations about research, to design survey tools, to conduct focus\ngroups, analyze results, and communicate those results effectively.\nNotwithstanding the Terms of Reference contract, and despite the fact that trans\ncommunity investigators have had a high level of trust for the project's two aca-\ndemic researchers, there were no processes put in place for acknowledging and\naddressing the considerable power differences, were this to become a problem.\nInstead, power-related discussions sometimes emerged in forums where it was\nrushed, or where it was off topic (and would have usurped more immediate\nagenda items). We have tried to acknowledge differentials in paid allocated employ-\nment time to the grant with a small ($125/month) honorarium for investigators\nwho do not have research included as part of their paid job descriptions, but this\ndoes not fully compensate for the work undertaken.\nQuestion 1: How do we better attend to, identify, and address issues of power in\nacademic-community partnerships?\nChallenge 2: Unintentional disempowerment during technical stages\nof research\nIssues of power imbalance become particularly challenging during research stages\nthat are necessarily driven by academic expertise (e.g. proposal development, ethics\nreview, data analysis). These phases sometimes take longer than expected, and\nduring these periods of time, other community researchers may not feel that\ntheir contributions are as valuable (and especially if they are not able or willing\nto voice these concerns). As CBPR continues to advance in popularity and impact,\nit is important for teams to ensure that the development and implementation of\n`technical' stages of a research project are meaningful for all team members. The\nRDS method used in this project required a high level of technical expertise at\ntimes, and during those times there was a noticeable withdrawal of some commu-\nnity investigators who found it hard to contribute to those discussions and hard to\nconceive of their roles. The vast majority of Trans PULSE community investiga-\ntors were drawn to the project's social action model and came with backgrounds as\nactivists and service providers. When team members did have research experience,\nit was often qualitative, rather than quantitative, and did not prepare them to\nunderstand the complex RDS method used in this project. During our lengthy\nsurvey development phase, project discourse shifted significantly in nature from\n`social justice and community action and development' to `question development,\nreliability, validity, standardized scales, and variables'. Unfortunately, as the work\nof the team became more `scientifically sophisticated', some community investiga-\ntors began to quietly question their roles and their ability to make meaningful\ncontributions to this phase. The team, however, was facing considerable time pres-\nsures and did not always pick up on these cues. In our experience, the gap between\nexisting community knowledge versus the technical needs of the research, can\nlessen the ability of community members to exercise control over the research\nprocess.\nQuestion 2: How can we design community roles where all people on a team can really\ncontribute their strengths? How can we ensure community members have the expertise\nthey need to lead?\nChallenge 3: Unintentional disempowerment of community members\nAnother challenge experienced by Trans PULSE was the positioning of a trans\ncommunity leader in a paid employment position where he did not have the equiva-\nlent voting power of investigators. On the one hand, a reasonable argument can be\nmade about the necessity of avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may occur\nif a paid staff person has equal voice (and voting power) as an investigator. On the\nother hand, when a community member's ability to vote is not granted, the team\nand project may be unwisely (and unwittingly) suppressing `voice' and wisdom.\nTraditional employment arrangements can put community members in positions\nwhere they are there to `take orders and to execute them', diminishing the scope of\nskills and breadth of knowledge they can fully bring to the project. Ironically,\nCBPR teams often expect the investment of community members to be\nlarger than their (usually) part-time roles. This standard way of viewing an\nemployer\u00ademployee relationship may serve to maintain the status quo by creating\nhierarchical arrangements in a CBPR project, where those who should have power\naccording to CBPR principles (in this case, trans people), in reality have little.\nAnother issue related to unintentional disempowerment had to do with our\nCommunity Engagement Team. Despite our best intentions of pulling together a\ndiverse Trans PULSE Community Engagement Team, like all CBPR teams, we were\nfaced with significant budgetary limitations. This resulted in our CET meeting in\nperson only once per year, for a total of two times, over the course of the initial three-\nyear project (they also engaged in some teleconference activities with our\nCommunity Development Coordinator). Our intention in having a CET was to\nshow the broader trans communities that we were `serious' about community-\nengagement and input. Their ability to work effectively, however, was severely lim-\nited by infrequent meetings, making it difficult for the CET to have truly meaningful\ninput into the project. Moreover, the CET largely comprised volunteers, receiving a\nsmall monthly honorarium, which led to some uncertainty about how much impact\nthey could really have. We have found a potential contradiction in our expectation\nthat the CET `guides' the project from these under-resourced positions. Despite\nthese good intentions, and despite the CET's success in shaping the survey, designing\nand producing a promotional video, and conducting workshops in their commu-\nnities, this dynamic was quite disempowering for many of the CET members who felt\nthat the real power in Trans PULSE resided in the project's Investigators Team.\nAnother issue emerged in relation to some community members feeling excluded\nfrom participating in the survey. The parameters of respondent-driven sampling\nmeant that trans people had to wait to be invited by another trans person to fill out\nthe survey (after a long period of advertising and promotion, accompanied by\nincreasing community excitement and enthusiasm about the survey). This seems\nto have touched a sore spot for some people around `popularity' or `belonging' in\nthe community. Some asked `do I have to be part of the in-crowd to complete the\nsurvey'?\nQuestion 3: How do we find alternative ways of conceptualizing power and ensuring\nthat community members who end up in staff roles in CBPR projects have power?\nHow can we design, fund, and empower steering committees that are not symbolic but\nare able to truly steer? What are our responsibilities when it comes to the uninten-\ntional impacts of a CBPR project?\nChallenge 4: Community trauma and team dynamics\n`Horizontal hostility' can be a major factor within marginalized communities,\nwhere people who have been very damaged by trauma and exclusion enact similar\npatterns on one another. Some have described this tendency for power to be turned\ninwards in community organizations as `eating our own' (Cain, 2002). There have\nbeen occasions in Trans PULSE where conflict has occurred between team\nmembers, and where there has been disagreement about the cause or source of the\nconflict. Some team members have regarded the conflict as `between individuals'\n(i.e. as interpersonal) whereas others have explained it vis-a\n` -vis the framework of\nhorizontal hostility. While our Terms of Reference addressed strategies and guide-\nlines for making decisions, it did not originally state explicitly how we would deal\nwith conflict, though it now identifies a series of steps to address this. Moreover,\neffective means of communicating about these conflicts were not always imple-\nmented, and instances where conflict was addressed were not always successful.\nWhen conflicts are left unmanaged, however, a team fails to address how they\nmight be impacting the work of the team and the project in general. As such,\nunaddressed conflict has the potential to create rifts among and between team\nmembers, to demoralize them, and to even cause some people to leave a project.\nOur team came to realize that our deep and shared sense of the importance of the\nproject was, in fact, part of what was causing us to be conflict-avoidant in order to\navoid disrupting the project. We had to reconceptualize addressing conflict as some-\nthing that was about ensuring the survival of the project, rather than threatening it.\nQuestion 4: What can CBPR teams put in place to minimize horizontal hostility\namong team members from marginalized communities? What can we put in place\nto address potential conflicts before they occur, or as soon as possible after?\nChallenge 5: The reproduction of systemic inequities on CBPR teams\nOne of the key issues that Trans PULSE has struggled with is how to adequately\naddress the range of experiences facing diverse groups within trans communities.\nAt one point in the project, we started to get feedback from the trans community\nabout the lack of representation of racialized trans people on this project; this\nfeedback was entirely well-founded. Like other marginalized communities, those\ntrans people who have access to forms of privilege derived from race, class, etc.,\noften have increased access to leadership positions as `community representatives'.\nWhen a number of investigators who were members of racialized communities left\nthe team, overtime most of us accepted the individual reasons they provided for\nleaving, without asking ourselves `is there a systemic problem here that is related to\nanti-racism'? At the prompting of community members, our team responded to\nthese concerns by organizing an anti-racism training for project investigators and\nanother later on in conjunction with the Community Engagement Team, adding\nanti-racism as a `standing item' on each meeting agenda, creating three new co-\ninvestigator positions geared specifically towards trans members of racialized com-\nmunities, and eventually developing an anti-oppression/anti-racism statement for\nthe project. Despite taking these positive steps in action to community concerns, we\nfailed to proactively plan a broad and systematic anti-racism strategy for Trans\nPULSE. Such a strategy might have included ongoing training, a well-articulated\nplan for addressing race and diversity issues in our promotion, in our survey and\nknowledge translation phases, and implications for the composition of our team\n(for example, a policy stating that a certain percentage of investigators would be\ndesignated to trans members of racialized communities). What made this issue\nparticularly challenging were the differing levels of awareness among investigators\nand Community Engagement Team members about the issues of oppression\nbeyond transphobia.\nQuestion 5: What do we mean when we call our CBPR projects `anti-racist'? How do\nwe operationalize anti-racism?\nDiscussion\nThe imperative of values, voice and process\nTrans PULSE strives to undertake high-quality research that fosters greater under-\nstanding about the health of trans people, and to make a real difference in trans\nOntarians' quality of life. Moreover, to help to redress power inequities, and build\nthe kind of trust between trans community members and researchers that would\nresult in a truly community-driven research agenda, we undertook a model of\nresearch that centered community control and ownership. Stoeker (2012) maintains\nthat we do not `walk our talk' in CBPR and that `we may not have an effective talk\nthat can guide the walk of participatory and action-oriented research practice'\n(p. 386). We believe, that in Trans PULSE, we did our best to `walk the talk' of\nCBPR by engaging in strategies to ensure that community were in control of all\nproject phases. Moreover, in utilizing a Terms of Reference contract and regarding\nit as a living/breathing document, and by shifting the discourse from community\nengagement to control, we may actually have Arieli, Friedman, and Agbaria (2009)\nmoved one step closer to developing what Stoeker (2012) calls for, `talk that can\nguide the walk of CBPR'.\nIn light of our considerable successes, we struggled with issues related to power\nsharing between community and academic partners, unintentional disempower-\nment, horizontal hostility and differing ideas about how to approach anti-racism\nwork. A significant challenge emerged at many points in the process that had to do\nwith unintentional disempowerment of community members, including community\ninvestigators, community engagement team members and staff. It was particularly\nvisible during the more technical stages of our research project, when some com-\nmunity voices were more noticeably absent in discussions. This flux in participation\nwas never discussed openly by the full team. Gaventa and Cornwall (2001, p. 184)\nprovide one explanation by arguing that the professional and technical nature of\nsome conversations are fused with power relations, and `. . . may serve to silence the\nvoices or ways of speaking of some groups while enabling those of others'.\nZakus and Lysack (1998) maintain that `community participation is a complex\nand fragile process [and] there are many factors that operate to diminish its success'\n(p. 6). Building upon this, Arieli et al. (2009) assert the need to `test the\nassumptions' held by academic researchers, that community are willing and able to\nparticipate as partners in all stages of a research project. Despite our best intentions\nto create a model of community ownership, some community members may have\npreferred the planning and action-oriented stages of research over those more\ntechnical and academic in nature. Despite mutual respect between community\nand academic team members, the research team did not have open conversations\nabout issues of power and voice on a regular basis. Ospina et al. (2004) maintains\n`that a mutual inquiry space requires a very honest conversation about roles, tasks,\nboundaries, authority, and power in the context of each particular project and as\nrelationships is being built' (p. 66). We are reminded that it is one thing to be aware\nof privilege and still quite another to proactively work toward minimizing its dele-\nterious effects. As Minkler (2005) states `. . . even outsiders who pride ourselves on\nbeing trusted community friends and allies often fail to appreciate the extent of the\npower that is embedded in our own, often multiple sources of privilege, and how it\ncan affect both process and outcomes in such research' (p. ii9).\nCBPR has the potential to `transform the culture of silence among oppressed\ngroups' (Chavez, Duran, Baker, Avila, & Wallerstein, 2008, p. 97), however, that\npotential is easily compromised when we fail to adequately examine disparities in\npower and how they impact genuine participation. Over 40 years ago, Arnstein\n(1969) made a compelling point when she argued `. . . that participation without\nredistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless'\n(p. 216). Maiter, Simich, Jacobson, and Wise (2008) speak to the importance of\nreciprocity in research \u00ad creating room for dialogue, openness and trust building,\nand the need to be explicit up front about the diverse needs of partners in a research\nproject. Similarly, Nelson, Pancer, Hayward, and Kelly (2004) maintain that the\nvalues underlying partnerships are often neglected. They emphasize the importance\nof developing a shared vision and identifying the strengths of group members in the\ninitial stages of partnership development. Trans PULSE has tried to address this by\ngetting members to know each other and to declare their stakes and interests in the\nbeginning and `putting them on the table', so to speak. What we have not done as\neffectively is to create space for ongoing learning and reflection about the CBPR\nprinciples that guide our work, how well (or not) we are adhering to them, and how\nto resolve or unify the conflicts and contradictions that emerge in trying to reach\nour multiple goals.\nStraddling two worlds: Research `versus' community development\nDespite operating under a model of `community control' and being guided by a clear\nTerms of Reference contract, team members frequently experience a feeling of `push-\npull' on the ultimate goal of the project: data collection/knowledge production or\nsocial justice work? As such, we may approach how we do our work according to\nwhat we personally believe to be right based on a complicated mix of factors, includ-\ning our training, our taken-for-granted assumptions about the world, our `privilege',\nour cumulative `lived experience', and our position in the world. Sometimes we have\ndifferent stakes in a project, are held up to quite different standards, and are account-\nable to different bodies. Community members are accountable to their communities\n(and in some cases employers); they must be trustworthy, humble, attentive to com-\nmunity needs, and reflective of the diversity in that community. Academic research-\ners are held to academic standards of excellence, must publish quickly, must present\nin academic contexts if seeking tenure, and must be first author on academic papers\nin some cases. These different standards are inextricably linked to what Minkler\n(2005) labeled as `differential reward structures for partners in CBPR' (p. ii9) pro-\njects, where academic researchers often stand to gain the most from such projects,\neven if the major goal is to benefit the community at hand.\nAs a CBPR project, the goal of Trans PULSE is to produce the highest quality\ndata possible to inform longer-term health, mental health, systemic, and other\ncommunity-level changes. As a community development initiative, its goal is\nrooted in social justice: Trans PULSE will mobilize knowledge and resources\nand will empower people to make changes in their lives. A community development\nframework and a research framework can potentially be viewed as competing\nlenses for approaching the goals and work of Trans PULSE. In some instances,\nthey will complement one another, whereas in others, they may actively compete.\nJacobs (2010) maintains that at times like this `academic quality' may supersede the\nneed or desire to pay strict attention to moral or ethical concerns in research and in\nCBPR. One very interesting dilemma that illustrates these two potentially contrast-\ning lenses focused on the needs of `isolated' trans people. Some of these individuals\ncontacted us during the survey administration phase indicating that they did not\nknow any other trans people and therefore would not be asked to complete our\nsurvey. This resulted directly from our usage of the RDS method whereby indi-\nviduals who complete the survey are given a set number of codes used to invite\nother trans people to complete the survey. Thus, one has to 1) wait to be invited to\ncomplete the survey, but 2) must know other trans people in order to be invited to\nparticipate. While our team recognized in advance that this would be a socially\nawkward methodology, we had engaged in extensive discussion and concluded that\nthe advantages in terms of validity of information gained \u00ad and consequently both\nthe increased protection of trans community from mis-information produced\nthrough biased research and the increased potential for policy impact \u00ad outweighed\nthe awkwardness. However, in implementation, not only did the process involve\nawkward messaging and social dynamics, but some trans people felt excluded from\nthe study. While we were able to ask some of those who contacted us to complete a\nsurvey and start a new chain of recruits, there is no way of knowing who else was\nmissed as a result of the structure of this methodology.\nJacobs (2010) makes mention of such conundrums where anxieties about `aca-\ndemic quality' in research studies can risk potentially usurping moral and ethical\nconcerns. Our discussions as a team, however, focused on upholding the integrity\nand rigor of the RDS method, while at the same time trying to figure out how to\ninclude isolated individuals as participants. Many of us did not see our role,\nhowever, as one where the survey could be used as a means of community develop-\nment or to connect people to others, as the method demanded that people recruit\nthrough existing connections. Thus, through a research lens, their dilemma (isola-\ntion) was usurped by concerns with the study methodology. Through a social justice\nlens, however, it could be seen as unacceptable to potentially contribute to the fur-\nther isolation of those individuals \u00ad a reversion of sorts where isolated people are\nregarded as `subjects' without an `absolute right' to participate in research about\n`their' communities. We thought that we might be excluding people from a study\nabout `social exclusion' and raised this as an ethical question \u00ad `are we unintention-\nally hurting people here vis-a\n` -vis our chosen method'? Could the production of what\nmay be more `ethical' knowledge (less biased, with greater potential impact) ever\njustify potential harm to community members through exclusion, or should the\nmethods be compromised to preserve the aims of community development?\nConclusion\nHistorically, significant harm has been done by researchers who have pathologized\ntrans communities, positioning themselves as `experts' about transgender people,\nprioritizing their own career motives, and offering very little in return (Bauer et al.,\n2009; Namaste, 2000). In line with CBPR's aim to avoid errors made by more trad-\nitional approaches to research, Trans PULSE has been successful in implementing a\nmodel of `community control' over time, though problems and challenges have\noccurred. We have learned as a team that there is a need to continually balance\npriorities and address privilege and inequities. In future phases, we are learning to\nset processes in place for conflict resolution in advance, and to set out roles for com-\nmunity members that are well conceived and actually engage their strengths. We will\nbuild in time for reflection and learning on an ongoing basis and will continue to\nevaluate how we live up to the CBPR principles we have chosen to guide our work.\n"
