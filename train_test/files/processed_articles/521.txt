Smaller practice size was significantly associated\nwith lower infrastructure scores. Medical home programs need\neffective approaches to support practices with limited resources.\nabstract\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of medical home infrastruc-\nture among primary care practices for children and identify practice\ncharacteristics associated with medical home infrastructure.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of restricted data files from 2007\nand 2008 of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We mapped\nsurvey items to the 2011 National Committee on Quality Assurance's\nPatient-Centered Medical home standards. Points were awarded for\neach \"passed\" element based on National Committee for Quality\nAssurance scoring, and we then calculated the percentage of the total\npossible points met for each practice. We used multivariate linear\nregression to assess associations between practice characteristics\nand the percentage of medical home infrastructure points attained.\nRESULTS: On average, pediatric practices attained 38% (95% confi-\ndence interval 34%\u00ad41%) of medical home infrastructure points,\nand family/general practices attained 36% (95% confidence interval\n33%\u00ad38%). Practices scored higher on medical home elements\nrelated to direct patient care (eg, providing comprehensive health\nassessments) and lower in areas highly dependent on health\ninformation technology (eg, computerized prescriptions, test ordering,\nlaboratory result viewing, or quality of care measurement and\nreporting). In multivariate analyses, smaller practice size was\nsignificantly associated with lower infrastructure scores. Practice\nownership, urban versus rural location, and proportion of visits\ncovered by public insurers were not consistently associated with a\npractice's infrastructure score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Medical home programs need effective approaches to\nsupport practice transformation in the small practices that provide the\nvast majority of the primary care for children in the United States.\nAUTHORS: Joseph S.

Studies in adult primary\ncare suggest that smaller and in-\ndependent practices are less likely to\nhave the infrastructure needed for\nmary care practices that serve chil-\ndren may be at an added disadvantage\nfor medical home certification because\nof the high proportion of children en-\nrolled in Medicaid,17 which pays sig-\nnificantly less than other insurers,\npotentially limiting practices' resour-\nces to implement the services and in-\nfrastructure needed for medical home\ncertification.18 Little is known about the\nreadiness formedical homecertification\nin primary care practices serving chil-\ndren, however.\nThis study was designed to address\nthe following questions: (1) to what\ndegree do primary care practices for\nchildren have the infrastructure re-\nquired for medical home certification;\nand (2) are practice characteristics\nassociated with a practice's medical\nhome infrastructure. Based on the\nthat smaller and physician-owned pri-\nmary care practices would be less\nready for medical home certification\ncompared with larger and health-\nsystem\u00adowned practices. We also hy-\npothesized that primary care practices\nwith a higher proportion of patient\nvisits from publicly insured children\nwould be less ready for medical home\ncertification.\nMETHODS\nSample\nWe used restricted data files from the\nMedical Care Survey (NAMCS), an an-\nnual multistage probability sample of\noutpatient visits to randomly selected,\nnon\u00adfederally employed, office-based\nphysicians in the United States.19 Be-\ncause physicians are one of the sam-\npling stages for the survey, results can\nbe used to produce national estimates\nof physician-reported practice charac-\nteristics using published methods.20\nFor this study, we were interested in\nprimary care practices for children.\nTherefore, we included physicians with\nreported specialties of pediatrics,\nfamily practice, and general practice.\nWe excluded physicians from pediatric\nsubspecialties and sports medicine.\nThere was insufficient sample size to\nincludeadolescentmedicineorinternal\nmedicine/pediatrics. We restricted the\nanalyses to physicians with at least 5%\nof their visits involving individuals ,19\nyears old.\nData Collection\nDuring the physician sampling stage of\nNAMCS, an induction interview was\nperformed with the physicians that\nincluded questions about a variety of\nphysician and practice characteristics.\nFor confidentiality reasons, many of\nthese physician and practice charac-\nteristics are not included in the NAMCS\npublic data files, but they are available\nin restricted data files available from\nthe Research Data Center of the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics.21\nMeasuring Medical Home\nInfrastructure\nAs in a previous study,16 we measured\nmedical home infrastructure by map-\nping practice characteristics reported\nby physicians in NAMCS to the NCQA\nPCMH certification standards. For this\nstandards.5 NCQA assigns a point value\nto each of the elements in the PCMH\nstandards for a total possible score of\n100. We were able to map items from\nNAMCS to each of the 6 NCQA PCMH\nstandards and represent 56 of the\nNCQA points, including (1) enhance\naccess and continuity (12 points); (2)\nidentify and manage patient pop-\nulations (16 points); (3) plan and\nmanage care (3 points); (4) provide\nself-care support and community\nresources (6 points); (5) track and co-\nordinate care (6 points); and (6) mea-\nsure and improve performance (13\npoints) (Table 1).\nTo generate the medical home in-\nfrastructure score, we first determined\nthe presence of practice character-\nistics mapped to the NCQA standards\nand assigned points to the practice\nbased on the NCQA scoring system.5 We\nthen generated a cumulative point total\nfor the practice by summing the points\nacross all practice characteristics that\nwere present. For practices with com-\nplete data, the maximum point total\nwas 56, and for practices with missing\nTABLE 1 Mapping of NAMCS Questions (2007 and 2008) to the 2011 NCQA PCMH Standards and Proportions of Pediatric and Family/General Practices\nThat Meet Standards\nNCQA Standard Element NCQA\nPoints\nNAMCS Question Points Possible\nPediatrics, %\nFP/GP, %\n1: Enhance Access\nand Continuity\nA.

The medical\nhome infrastructure score for each\npractice was then calculated by di-\nviding the total points for the practice\nby the maximum possible points. The\nmedical home infrastructure score\nrepresents the percentage of measur-\nable NCQA medical home elements\npresent in the practice. It is important\nto note that the NCQA standards in-\nclude 6 \"must-pass\" elements that are\nrequired for certification, regardless\nof overall score (Table 1). We were able\nto map NAMCS items to only 3 of the 6\nmust-pass elements and chose to\nscore them in the same manner as\nother elements.\nPractice Characteristics\nSeveralpracticecharacteristicsthatwe\nhypothesized to be associated with\nmedical home infrastructure were\nidentifiable in NAMCS, including prac-\ntice size, practice ownership, urban\nversus rural location, and the pro-\nportion of visits covered by public\npayers (Medicaid and the State Child-\nren's Health Insurance Program\n[SCHIP]). Practice size was categorized\nbased on the number of physicians in\nthe practice: solo/2 physicians, small\ncategorized as physician or physician\ngroup, community health center, or\nhealth system. Health systems included\nhealth maintenance organizations, ac-\nademic medical centers, hospitals, and\nother health care corporations. Urban\nversus rural location was categorized\nin NAMCS based on the zip code of the\npractice. The proportion of visits cov-\nered by public payers was determined\nby the percentage of visits for individ-\nuals ,19 years old with expected\npayment from Medicaid or SCHIP dur-\ning the NAMCS sampling period for that\nphysician.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe generated nationally representative\npractice-level estimates by deriving\na medical practice estimator by using\nmethodology suggested by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics.20 This ap-\nproach allowed us to make practices,\nrather than physicians, our unit of\nanalysis. We corrected the SEs of our\nestimates to account for the complex\nsurvey design, including the use of\nsurvey weights and stratification. We\nthen assessed bivariate and multivar-\niate associations between practice\ncharacteristics and the medical home\ninfrastructure score by using linear\nregression.\nWe used Stata 11.0 (Stata Corp, College\nStation, TX) for all statistical analyses\nwith appropriate adjustments for the\ncomplex survey design. The University of\nMichiganHealthSciencesandBehavioral\nSciences Institutional Review Board\ndetermined that this study was exempt\nfrom oversight.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of Primary Care\nPractices for Children in the United\nStates\nThe final sample included 222 primary\ncare pediatric practices, representing\nfamily and general practices, repre-\n(Table 2). Most visits for children oc-\ncurred in pediatric practices (78%\n82%]) versus family and general prac-\ntices. In pediatric practices, nearly all\nvisits in pediatric practices were for\nted for a much smaller percentage of\nvisits in family/general practices (15%\nMostpracticesweresoloor2partnerin\nsize and were owned by a physician or\nphysician group (Table 2). Most pedi-\natric practices were in large metro-\npolitan areas, whereas most family and\ngeneral practices were outside large\nmetropolitan areas. Pediatric practices\nhad higher proportions of visits for\nchildren that were expected to be paid\nfor by Medicaid or SCHIP compared\nwith family and general practices, but\nTABLE 1 Continued\nNCQA Standard Element NCQA\nPoints\nNAMCS Question Points Possible\nPediatrics, %\nFP/GP, %\nE: Report Performance 3 Are performance measures on your\npractice available to the public?\nF.

In most pediatric\npractices, patients could be seen\nduring the evening or on weekends;\nthese services were available in only\na minority of family/general practi-\nces. Very few practices offered advice\nthroughelectronic communication, such\nas e-mail. In the standard for providing\nself-care support, nearly all practices\nreported providing health education to\npatients at visits.\nIn contrast, fewer than half of primary\ncare practices met NAMCS items in the\nNCQA standards for planning and\nmanaging care, tracking and co-\nordinating care, and measuring and\nimproving performance (Table 1). Low\nscores in these standards were largely\na result of few practices reporting\ncomputerized systems that facilitated\npatient management tasks, such as\nwriting prescriptions, test ordering,\nviewing laboratory results, or mea-\nsuring and reporting quality of care.\nResults in the NCQA standard for iden-\ntifying and managing patient pop-\nulations were more mixed (Table 1). A\nsignificant majority of practices\nreported a computerized system with\npatient demographic information, but\nfewer than half of practices had sys-\ntems that included problem lists or\nprompts for guideline-based screening\nor interventions. In this standard,\nresults were also mixed for services\nthat could be considered part of a com-\nprehensive health assessment, such as\nscreening and education about nu-\ntrition, development, or tobacco use/\nexposure.\nMedical Home Infrastructure Score\nOn average, pediatric practices met\nmedical home infrastructure points,\nand family and general practices met\npoints. In bivariate analyses, medical\nhome infrastructure score was signif-\nicantly associated with practice size for\nboth pediatric and family/general\npractices, with smaller practices hav-\ning lower scores (Table 3). The medical\nhome infrastructure score was not\nassociated with practice ownership,\nurban versus rural location, or pro-\nportion of visits covered by Medicaid/\nSCHIP for either type of primary care\npractices for children.\nIn multivariate analyses, practice size\nwas independently associated with the\nTABLE 2 Characteristics of Primary Care Practices for Children in the United States, NAMCS, 2007 and 2008\nPediatrics Family and General Practicea\nWeighted n (Unweighted n) Weighted % (95% CI) Weighted n (Unweighted n) Weighted % (95% CI)\nPractice size\nWho owns the practice\nUrban versus rural location\nProportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIPb\na Practices with $5% of patient visits for individuals ,19 y.\nb Practices grouped based on proportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIP for individuals ,19 y: pediatrics (0%, 1%\u00ad23%, 24%\u00ad52%, 53%\u00ad100%) and family practice/general medicine (0%,\nc Because it is based on ,30 records, the National Center for Health Statistics considers this estimate to be unreliable.\npractice's medical home infrastructure\nscore (Table 4). Compared with solo/2-\npartner pediatric practices, medium\nand large pediatric practices had sig-\nnificantly higher medical home in-\nhigher on the 100-point scale, re-\nspectively). The association between\npractice size and the medical home\ninfrastructure score was similar for\nfamily and general practices. Location\nin a nonmetropolitan (rural) area was\nassociated with lower medical home\ninfrastructure scores for pediatric\npractices but not for family and gen-\neral practices (Table 4). There was no\nsignificant difference in the medical\nhome infrastructure score between\npractices with a high proportion of\nvisits covered by Medicaid/SCHIP and\npractices with no visits covered by\nMedicaid/SCHIP (Table 4). Practices\nwith a medium proportion of visits\ncovered by Medicaid and SCHIP had\nsignificantly higher medical home in-\nfrastructure scores compared with\npractices with no visits covered by\nMedicaid/SCHIP. There were no signifi-\ncant associations between practice\nownership and the medical home in-\nfrastructure score.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative study\nof primary care practices for children,\npractices generally score low on an\noverall measure of medical home in-\nfrastructure, averaging ,40% of in-\ncluded medical home elements. With\na minimum threshold of 35 for medical\nhome certification in the NCQA pro-\ngram,5 a significant proportion of\npractices would not qualify for the\nlowest level of certification. We found\nthat smaller primary care practices\nwere at a distinct disadvantage for\noverall medical home infrastructure.\nOur results are similar to those for\nto our knowledge, this is the first study\nTABLE 3 Mean Medical Home Infrastructure Scores by Practice Characteristics\nMean Medical Home Infrastructure Score (95% CI)a\nPediatrics Family and General Practiceb\nPractice size\nWho owns the practice\nUrban versus rural location\nProportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIPc\nb Practices with $5% of patient visits for individuals ,19 y.\nc Practices grouped based on proportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIP for individuals ,19 y: pediatrics (0%, 1%\u00ad23%,\nd P , .05 for F-test from bivariate linear regression.\nTABLE 4 Multivariate Associations Between Characteristics of Primary Care Practices for\nChildren and Medical Home Infrastructure Score\nAdjusted b Coefficient for Medical Home\nInfrastructure Scorea,b\nPediatrics Family and General Practicec\nPractice size\nSolo/partner (1\u00ad2) (reference) -- --\nWho owns the practice\nPhysician or physician group (reference) -- --\nUrban versus rural location\nLarge central metro (reference) -- --\nProportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIPd\nNo Medicaid/SCHIP visits -- --\na Linear regression adjusted for each practice characteristic.\nb Coefficients represent change in score on 100-point scale compared with reference category.\nc Practices with $5% of patient visits for individuals ,19 y.\nd Practices grouped based on proportion of visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIP for individuals ,19 y: pediatrics (0%, 1%\u00ad23%,\nARTICLE\nto assess the medical home in-\nfrastructure in a nationally represen-\ntative sample of primary care practices\nserving children.\nThese findings add to a growing body of\nliteraturethatsuggestthatpracticesize\nis a key factor in practices having the\ninfrastructure required for medical\na significant challenge for medical\nhome implementation in primary care\npractices for children, because our\nresults suggest that at least two-thirds\nof these practices are solo or 2-partner\nmodels. Implementation of medical\nhome processes is time and resource\nintensive for primary care practices,11,23\nand it has been postulated that\npractices with higher levels of organi-\nzational reserve, or \"slack,\" are more\nlikely to be successful at medical home\nimplementation.24 Larger practices\nmay be more likely to be able to real-\nlocate physicians and staff time away\nfrom direct patient care to implement\nnew systems of care. Larger practices\nmay also be more likely to have the\nfinancial resources to invest in health\na core aspect of medical home certi-\nfication, particularly in the NCQA\nNCQA points we assessed were de-\npendent on health information tech-\nnology, and this may be a rate-limiting\nfactor for many small, independent\npractices.\nThe resources needed for medical\nhome certification raises questions\nabout the degree to which individual\nprimarycarepracticescanbeexpected\nto implement these services and in-\nfrastructure on their own. Fortunately,\nthis issue has been increasingly rec-\nognized by policy makers involved in\nprimary care transformation. The\nHealth Information and Technology for\nEconomic and Clinical Health portion\nof the American Recovery and Rein-\nof dollars in incentives for providers to\nadopt electronic health records and\nfunded regional extension centers to\nsupport clinical practices in adopt-\ning these systems.26 In addition to\nsupporting electronic health record\nadoption, it has been proposed that\nthese extension centers could be lev-\neraged to provide primary care prac-\ntices with support for adopting other\nIn response to the drive toward more\nintegrated care through accountable\ncare organizations, larger health sys-\ntems are again aggressively buying\nout primary care practices, and these\nlarge health systems may provide\nsmall primary care practices with the\ninfrastructure needed for medical\nhome implementation.29 In parallel,\nmany state and private payers have\ndeveloped initiatives to encourage\nand support small practices in shar-\ning the resources necessary for\nmedical home implementation while\nmaintaining their organizational in-\nOur findings also suggest that pediatric\npracticesinthemostruralsettingsmay\nalso be at a disadvantage in medical\nhome certification, regardless of size.\nAlthough they are a small group, these\npractices could represent another im-\nportant target for policies supporting\nprimary care transformation. Inte-\nrestingly, family and general practices\nin rural settings scored equal to their\nurban counterparts. It is possible that\nfamily practices in rural settings may\nhave relatively more financial resour-\nces compared with rural pediatric\npractices because of higher reim-\nbursement through Medicare for adult\npatients compared with Medicaid for\npediatric patients.18\nConcernshavebeenraisedthatpractices\nthat serve low-income populations may\nbe at a disadvantage for medical home\ncertification, although the only study\nspecifically examining this issue found\nthat safety-net practices may be at a rel-\native advantage.31 In our results, it was\nencouraging to find that a higher pro-\nportion of practice visits covered by\nMedicaid/SCHIP was not associated with\nlower medical home infrastructure\nscores and was actually associated\nwith higher infrastructure scores for\npediatric practices with moderate lev-\nels of Medicaid/SCHIP visits.\nThe overall low scores are concerning\nfor many practices'ability to effectively\nand efficiently care for children and\nyouth with special health care needs.\nFew practices reported computerized\nsystems that facilitate the prospective\ncare, such as reminders for routine\ntests and preventive care, or tracking\nand follow-up of test results and im-\naging that are particularly important\nfor high-needs populations. Although it\nis possible to have such systems and\nqualify for NCQA certification without\nan electronic health record, health in-\nformation technology can help stan-\ndardize and automate these processes\nof care that are critical for children and\nyouth with special health care needs\nand facilitate medical home certifica-\ntion for practices.\nThe results of our study should be\nviewed in the context of several limi-\ntations. First, the medical home in-\nfrastructure score we used is based on\nthe NCQA PCMH certification program,\nwhile there are now a wide variety of\nother certification programs spon-\nsoredbynot-for-profitorganizations,6\u00ad8\nAdditionally, the NCQA PCMH standards\nhave been criticized for relying too\nheavily on process measures, particu-\nlarly health information technology,\nwhile relatively neglecting other as-\npects of the medical home model, such\nas interpersonal communication and\npatient experience, and patient out-\nhome certification process is currently\nthe most widely used standard in\nmedical home programs, and it largely\nresembles other medical home certi-\nfication standards.4,34 Second, we were\nable to assess only approximately half\nof the points in the NCQA PCMH stand-\nmust-pass elements. However, a sensi-\ntivity analysis in a previous study using\nthe same methodology suggested that\nthe trends found would be consistent\neven with the inclusion of the other\nNCQA PCMH elements.16 Third, the\nmapping of NAMCS items to NCQA\nPCMH elements was indirect for sev-\neral items. In the previous study using\nthis methodology, exclusion of in-\ndirectly mapped items did not sub-\nstantially change results,16 and in the\nabsence of other nationally represen-\ntative data sets directly measuring\nmedical home infrastructure in pri-\nmary care practices for children,\nNAMCS represents the best available\noption. Fourth, the variable available to\ncategorize practice ownership did not\nallow us to differentiate between small\npractices that were owned by large\nphysician groups versus small in-\ndependent practices. Last, these data\nwhether the various policies and pro-\ngrams promoting the medical home in\nthe past 5 years are likely to increase\nor close the gaps in medical home in-\nfrastructure between primary care\npractices.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrimary care practices for children are\ngenerally ready for the lowest levels of\nmedical home certification, but very few\nhad higher levels of medical home in-\nfrastructure. Small primary care prac-\nticesthatservechildrenaresignificantly\nless likely to be prepared for medical\nhome certification. If the goal is to\ntransformallprimarycarepracticesinto\nmedicalhomes,medicalhomeprograms\nwill need to move beyond the vanguard\npractices that have been part of initial\nefforts and find effective approaches to\nsupport practice transformation in the\nsmall practices that compose the vast\nmajority of the primary care system for\nchildren in the United States.\nREFERENCES\n1.

He told me that he had been\ncoaching the team for more than 25 years, but had no plans to retire or change\npositions. This seemed such a remarkable difference from the coaching carousel\nthat occurs in Division I schools, particularly in football programs. While high\nschool sports and Division I football are entirely different entities, in either\nprogram deciding when to replace a coach (and at what cost) is not easy.\nHowever, in Division I football, universities quite frequently replace coaches at\na fantastic cost. As reported in The New York Times (Sports: November 28, 2012),\nover the past decade approximately 10% of major college football programs\nreplaced their coaches each year for performance-related reasons. Sometimes\nthe cost associated with firing coaches seems unbelievable. One university must\npay the fired coaching staff 11 million dollars and another almost 9 million\ndollars over the next several years. For one of the coaches, that amounts to more\nthan $200,000 a month for three years to sit in the stands rather than coach from\nthe sidelines. Surprisingly, little data exists to support such practices. A recently\npublished study examined the performance of major college football teams in the\nfive years following a coaching change and compared it to the performance of\nteams with similar records at the onset who had not changed coaches. Overall,\nfor teams with losing records, changing or retaining coaches had little impact;\nfor teams that had won about half their games, teams that changed coaches had\nworse outcomes. Why the results are not better is unknown, but it could be that\nteams need time to adjust to new systems and develop new recruiting networks.\nAs for universities, football is often a window to their school, and individual\nexamples of success do abound, so they are willing to invest heavily in college\ncoaches who can potentially bring immediate success and recognition to the\nschool. With the average salary of a head coach at a major college program now\nat approximately $1.6 million dollars a year, the investment is quite large indeed.\nPersonally, I am not a huge fan of the increasingly higher salaries being paid now\nto college, let along professional coaches and managers, and relish the idea that\nthe CVU high school coach will return for his 26th year because he is invested in\nhis players and the game of soccer.\nNoted by WVR, MD"
