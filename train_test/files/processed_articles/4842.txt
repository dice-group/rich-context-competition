    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn his later writings, Bronfenbrenner revised his ecological theory, resulting in the bioecological model that gave prominence\nto proximal processes and the relationship between the context and individual characteristics. Drawing on the bioecological\nmodel, we hypothesized that (a) contextual influences will be mediated by proximal processes, (b) proximal processes\nwill have a more powerful impact on children's development than contextual factors, and (c) the effect of contextual and\nproximal processes will vary as a function of child characteristic and developmental outcome. Data used were from a sample\nof 28,064 six- to eleven-year-olds in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. A multigroup structural equation model\nthat employed a process-person-context research design was used to analyze the data. In general, support was found for the\nmeditational hypothesis and the hypothesis that the impact of contextual factors and proximal processes varies as a function\nof person and the developmental outcome. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that proximal processes exert a\nmore powerful effect on development than contextual factors.\n",

One reason for our investigation is that, two relatively\nrecent essays have drawn attention to the misunderstandings\nand (mis)application of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological the-\nory (Darling, 2007; Tudge, Mokrova, Hatfield, & Karnik,\nBronfenbrenner's ecological theory concluded that only four\nof those tested the more recent forms of the theory. They\nconcluded that to avoid misleading readers, investigators\nshould clearly specify (a) whether they are using\nBronfenbrenner's \"older ecological theory\" or the \"newer\nbioecological model,\" and (b) which portions of the older or\nnewer model are used in an investigation.\nAnother reason for this examination is that not all aspects\ninvestigated. For example, Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn\n(2000) argued that there is limited research examining meso-\nsystems; specifically, the association between neighborhoods\nand family/parenting--two microsystems that contain the\ndeveloping child and are salient to children's development.\nConsequently, we examine how aspects of the microsys-\ntem--neighborhoods, parenting, and family factors are asso-\nciated. We also examine Bronfenbrenner's arguments\nBronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000) that proximal processes\nexert a more powerful influence on developmental outcomes\nthan contextual factors, and that the influence of proximal\nprocesses vary as a function of the person, context, and\ndevelopmental outcome.\nWe were also motivated for this undertaking by\nBronfenbrenner's (1995a) suggestion that he hoped his work\n\"would impel others to seek closure and yield scientific\naspects of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory bearing in\nmind that all the varied aspects of his theory cannot be exam-\nined in a single investigation (Bronfenbrenner, 1999).\nBefore proceeding with our investigation, we first outline\nthe main elements of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory,\n1Gulf University for Science & Technology, West Mishref, Kuwait\n2California State University, Hayward, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGodwin S.

We then\nlay out our hypotheses for this investigation based on propo-\nsitions outlined in Bronfenbrenner's theory. After that, we\nexamine research that links the contextual aspects of\nBronfenbrenner's theory to proximal processes, and ulti-\nmately, children's socioemotional development.\nIn its earliest inception, Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological\nplace to the environment and divided an individual's envi-\nronment into nested and interrelated systems: the microsys-\ntem, mesosystem, macrosystem, and exosystem. The\nmicrosystem is the immediate environment in which the\nchild lives. Microsystems include any immediate relation-\nships or organizations the child interacts with, such as, the\nfamily, peer group, or school setting. The mesosystem\ndescribes interrelationships between different microsystems.\nFor example, parental involvement in children's schooling\ncan have a positive influence on children's academic compe-\ntence through children's valuing of academics. The exosys-\ntem level has indirect effect on an individual's developmental\noutcome and is the setting in which the individual does not\nactively participate. Examples of the exosystem include the\nparents' workplace. Events happening at the workplace can\naffect children through how parents interact with their chil-\ndren. Bronfenbrenner's final level is the macrosystem. It\ninvolves the society, and includes cultural values and\ndescribes the economic conditions under which families live\n(Bronfenbrenner, 1976), along with material resources, and\nopportunity structures (Bronfenbrenner, 1994). The interre-\nlations among these nested environments allow for examina-\ntion of how patterns of interactions within these systems\ninfluence each other and affect individuals' developmental\nBronfenbrenner refined and revised his theory to what\nwould come to be known as his bioecological model. During\nthis time, more concern was given to differentiating between\nthe concepts of environment, the person, proximal process,\nand the concept of time as they relate to human development\n2000). Specifically, Bronfenbrenner placed greater emphasis\non proximal processes and called them \"the engines of devel-\nIn two interrelated propositions he outlined the centrality of\nproximal processes. First, Bronfenbrenner (1995a) argued that\n. . . human development takes place through the processes of\nprogressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an\nactive, evolving biopsychological human organism and the\npersons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external\nenvironment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a\nfairly regular basis over extended periods of time. Such enduring\nforms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred\nto as proximal processes. (p. 620)\nIn the developing child, an example of such enduring pat-\nterns of proximal processes would be parent\u00adchild interac-\ntions. Bronfenbrenner and Ceci (1994) suggested that\nproximal processes (a) are the mechanisms through which\ndevelopmental potentials are actualized and (b) exert a more\npowerful influence on developmental outcomes than contex-\ntual factors.\nIn his second proposition, Bronfenbrenner (1995a) and\nBronfenbrenner and Evans (2000) posited that\nthe form, power, content, and direction of the proximal processes\naffecting development vary systematically as a joint function of\nthe biopsychological characteristics of the developing person; of\nthe environment, both immediate and more remote, in which the\nprocesses are taking place; and the nature of the developmental\noutcomes under consideration. (p. 621)\nProposition 2 suggests that to understand the impact of prox-\nimal processes on developmental outcomes, we have to focus\nattention on the person, the context, and developmental out-\ncome under consideration.\nBronfenbrenner (1999) outlined the properties of proxi-\nmal processes as follows:\n(a) the individual must engage in an activity, (b) to be effective,\nthe activity must take place on a fairly regular basis over an\nextended period of time, and become increasingly complex, and\n(c) proximal processes are not limited to interpersonal\ninteractions; they can also involve interaction with objects and\nWhat is evident from Bronfenbrenner's discussion is that\nproximal processes can take on different shapes and form--\npersons, objects, or activities--proximal processes have to\nhave regularity, and be free from interruptions to become\nincreasingly complex.\nBronfenbrenner (1995a) and Bronfenbrenner and Evans\n(2000) argued that an adequate test of the bioecological\nmodel requires a new form of research design that draws on\nthe two propositions relating to (a) the nature of proximal\nprocesses and (b) how proximal processes interact with per-\nson and context to influence particular developmental out-\ncomes. Such a research design Bronfenbrenner and Evans\n(2000) termed the \"process-person-context-time (PPCT)\nWe acknowledge at the outset that given that our study\nrelies on secondary analyses of cross-sectional data, it placed\nsome constraints on our ability to implement all elements of\nBronfenbrenner's theory. Specifically, we were unable to\nassess the time dimension of the theory. Consequently, we\nemployed what may be termed a limited version of the PPCT\nresearch design. Specifically, we use a process-person-con-\ntext (PPC) design to examine in a multigroup structural\nequation model (SEM) the associations among predictors of\nchildren's positive and negative social behaviors.\nAshiabi and O'Neal 3\nIn using the PPC model (Figure 1), we examined whether\nthe associations among socioeconomic status (SES; macro-\nsystem construct), neighborhood social capital, family and\nparenting stress (microsystem factors), parent\u00adchild interac-\ntions (proximal processes), and children's positive and nega-\ntive social behaviors (developmental outcomes) differed\nbetween male and female children (child characteristic).\nDrawing on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory, we\nhypothesize that (a) contextual influences (SES, a macrosys-\ntem construct, and neighborhood and parenting factors,\nmicrosystem constructs) will be mediated by proximal pro-\ncesses (parent\u00adchild interactions), (b) proximal processes\nwill have a more powerful impact on children's developmen-\ntal outcomes than contextual factors, and (c) the effect of\ncontextual and proximal processes will vary as a function of\nchild characteristic (child gender). Our choice of childhood\nas a test of Bronfenbrenner's theory is driven by the fact that\nyounger children are heavily dependent on their parents,\nthus, contextual and family factors are more likely to have a\ngreater influence on their developmental outcomes.\nWe now turn our attention to the examination of research\nlinking contextual factors and proximal processes to chil-\ndren's developmental outcomes. We start by examining the\nassociation among SES, family and parenting factors, and\nchild outcomes. We then assess the links between neighbor-\nhood factors and child developmental outcomes. In examin-\ning the influence of contextual factors, we also discuss the\nmediating role of proximal processes.\nContextual Influences and Child\nDevelopment\nSES and Child Outcomes\nThere is a great body of evidence linking SES (a macrosys-\ntem construct) to children's socioemotional competence,\nalthough the association is not as strong (Barajas, Philipsen,\n& Brooks-Gunn, 2008) and consistent as the link with cogni-\ntive development (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). Studies of\nchildren have found associations between SES and psycho-\nlogical well-being (Costello, Compton, Keeler, & Angold,\n2003). Children in families with limited financial resources\ncompared with their more affluent peers are more likely to\nexperience a variety of socioemotional difficulties, such as\nbehavioral problems (Anthony, Anthony, Morrel, & Acosta,\n2005), internalizing and externalizing symptoms (Duncan,\nBrooks-Gunn, & Klebanov, 1994), problematic peer rela-\ntions, and disruptive classroom behaviors (Patterson,\nSES and Family and Parenting Effects\nParents, a microsystem for their children, are also impacted\nby socioeconomic circumstances. Parents from lower SES\nbackgrounds often experience higher levels of parenting\nstress, psychological distress, and depression (Klebanov,\nBrooks-Gunn, Chase-Landsdale, & Gordon, 1997; Leventhal\nNeighborhood\nSocial Capital\nFamily and\nParenng\nStress\nPosive Social\nBehavior\nSocioeconomic\nStatus\nNeighborhood and context of parenng\nParent-Child\nInteracons\nProximal processes Child Outcomes\nNegave\nSocial\nBehavior\nFigure 1. Hypothesized model of neighborhood, context of parenting, proximal processes, and child outcomes.\n4 SAGE Open\n& Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, &\nMullan, 1981) than their higher SES counterparts. Pinquart\nand Srensen (2000) identified four ways in which SES may\naffect adult psychological well-being via (a) positive\nappraisal of one's life; (b) improved quality of life; (c) low\nmaterial resources that contribute to economic strain and,\nthus, psychological distress; and (d) the prevention of stress-\nors and increased coping abilities through the availability of\nmaterial and other resources.\nNeighborhoods and Child Outcomes\nNeighborhoods, a microsystem construct, are also linked\nwith children's developmental outcomes. The associations\nbetween neighborhoods and children's behavioral and emo-\ntional problems are less consistent than those reported for\ncognitive and school outcomes (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn,\n2000). However, the relationship remains even after control-\nling for family socioeconomic circumstances and parental\ncharacteristics (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Sampson,\nChildren raised in poor neighborhoods are at an\nincreased risk for a number of negative outcomes includ-\ning internalizing and externalizing behavior problems\n(Beyers, Bates, Pettit, & Dodge, 2003; Chase-Lansdale &\nGordon, 1996; Chase-Lansdale, Gordon, Brooks-Gunn, &\nKlebanov, 1997), delinquency, mental health issues (Evans,\net al., 2002), conduct disorders (Aneshensel & Sucoff,\n1996), and delays in their cognitive and social develop-\nment (Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998).\nAlthough the level of neighborhood social capital, that is,\nthe resources inherent within community networks may\nameliorate some of these negative outcomes, the poorest\nneighborhoods often have the fewest readily available\nresources (Murray, Berkel, Gaylord-Hardon, Copeland-\nNeighborhoods and Parenting\nSeveral studies (Chung & Steinberg, 2006; Dorsey &\nPerkins, Pastore, & Santinello, 2010) have reported associa-\ntions between aspects of neighborhood and parenting behav-\niors. For example, Chung and Steinberg (2006) in a study of\nhow neighborhood structural and social characteristics, par-\nenting, and peers impacted adolescents'delinquency reported\nthat weak neighborhood social organization had on indirect\neffect on delinquency via parenting behaviors and peers.\nSimilarly, Dorsey and Forehand (2003) in a study of how\nsocial capital, neighborhood dangerousness, and positive\nparenting relate to child psychosocial adjustment difficulties\nreported that social capital related to child psychosocial\nadjustment difficulties through positive parenting and neigh-\nborhood dangerousness.\nProcesses and Child Development\nWhat is clear from the research on SES, neighborhoods,\nand child developmental outcomes is that, both SES and\nneighborhood characteristics exert their effects on child\ndevelopment via parenting and proximal processes, such\nas, parent\u00adchild interactions and positive parenting behav-\niors. These views are in line with the family stress model\nSimons, 1994; McLoyd, Jayaratne, Ceballo, & Borquez,\n1994). The family stress model suggests that SES impacts\nchildren's outcomes via parental mental health and family\nprocesses, and subsequently, adversely impacting parent-\ning behaviors (Evans, 2004; Knerr, Gardner, & Cluver,\n2013), which in turn, have deleterious impacts on chil-\ndren's well-being (Grant et al., 2003; Repetti, Taylor, &\nSome research on neighborhood effects on child develop-\nment have found a meditational path via parental psycho-\nlogical distress, family processes, and parent\u00adchild\nrelationship constructs (Kohen, Leventhal, Dahinten, &\net al. (2008) reported that lower neighborhood cohesion was\nassociated with maternal distress and family dysfunction,\nwhich, in turn, were correlated to poor quality parenting\nbehaviors, and ultimately, poorer child outcomes.\nThe literature reviewed shows that macro- and microsys-\ntem factors may affect children's development via proximal\nprocesses. Specifically, both SES and neighborhood effects\noperate by affecting parenting and family processes, parent-\ning practices, interactions between parents and their chil-\ndren, and ultimately child outcomes. Furthermore, the review\nshows that the constructs selected to test Bronfenbrenner's\ntheory and the associations among the constructs are well\ngrounded in the literature.\nMethod\nData Survey and Design\nThe data used were from the National Survey of Children's\nHealth (NSCH), 2007, a national cross-sectional telephone sur-\nvey sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the\nHealth Resources and Services Administration (Child and\nAdolescent Health Measurement Initiative [CAHMI], 2007).\nThe NSCH was intended to examine the physical and emotional\nhealth of children aged 0 to 17 years, and the factors that may\nrelate children's well-being (Blumberg et al., 2007). The NSCH\nused the sampling frame on the National Immunization Survey\n(NIS), a large-scale random-digit-dialed (RDD) telephone\nAshiabi and O'Neal 5\nsurvey designed to collect immunization history for children.\nFor a detailed description of NSCH's data survey and design see\nData Collection and Sample\nComputer-assisted telephone interviewing that started in\nlevel interviews. A letter was mailed prior to telephone calls.\nPotential responders used this number to alert interviewers\nthat there were no children in their household, to ask ques-\ntions about the study, or to complete an interview (Blumberg\net al., 2007). Consent for participation was obtained when it\nwas determined that a household contained an age-eligible\nchild. The respondent was the adult in the household who\nwas most knowledgeable about the sampled child's health\nand health care. In a majority of households, the respondent\nwas the child's mother, father, or male/female guardian. For\nwere used (Table 1).\nMeasures\nPerson characteristics\nGender of child. We used the gender of children to indicate\nperson characteristics because Bronfenbrenner (2005; Bron-\nfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) argued that biological charac-\nteristics of individuals can influence proximal processes and\ndetermine their developmental outcomes.\nMacrosystem. We conceptualized family SES as a macrosys-\ntem construct because it (a) affects how the microsystemic\nfactors function (Bronfenbrenner, 1977a), and (b) describes\nthe economic conditions under which families live (Bronfen-\nbrenner, 1976), and includes among other variables, material\nresources and opportunity structures (Bronfenbrenner, 1994).\nSocioeconomic status.It was measured with three items:\nanyone in the household employed at least 50 weeks (0 =\nno, 1 = yes), income-poverty partitioned into eight levels\nbased on US Department of Health and Human Services\n(USDHSS) guidelines (0 = at or below 100% of poverty to\n8 = above 400% poverty level), and maternal education cat-\negorized into 3 levels (0 = less than high school to 3 = more\nthan high school).\nMicro- and mesosystem links. We used two constructs (neigh-\nborhood social capital and family and parenting stress) to\nassess the effects of the microsystem, the most immediate\nsetting in which a child is situated (Bronfenbrenner, 1979,\n1995a). Also, mesosystem effects--the relations between\ndepicted by the association between neighborhood social\ncapital and family and parenting stress.\nNeighborhood social capital.Four items were used as\nindicators of this construct. The questions asked respon-\ndents to indicate their level of agreement with the follow-\ning statements (people help each other out, we watch out\nfor each other's children, people I can count on, and adults\nnearby I can trust) on a 4-point scale (1 = definitely agree\nto 4 = definitely disagree). The items were reverse-coded\nsuch that a higher score represents increased neighborhood\nsocial capital\nFamily and parenting stress.This construct was assessed\nwith four observed indicators. Of these indicators, coping\nwith the demands was measured on a 4-point scale (1 = very\nwell to 4 = not very well at all); the other three indicators--\nchild much harder to care for, child does things that really\nbother you, and how often felt angry with child--were mea-\nsured on a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = always). Higher\nscores on these indicators indicated higher levels of family\nand parenting stress.\nProximal processes. Bronfenbrenner conceptualized proximal\nprocesses as the driving forces of development (Bronfen-\nbrenner & Morris, 2006). Examples of proximal processes\ninclude playing with a child or reading activities, and the\nrelations between people and objects and symbols they come\ninto contact with (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). In prior\nresearch, proximal processes have been assessed by using\nparents' disciplinary practices (Riggins-Caspers, Cadoret,\nKnutson, & Langbehn, 2003) and educational interventions\nand family functioning (Campbell, Pungello, & Miller-John-\nson, 2002). We conceptualized proximal processes using a\nproxy measure of parent\u00adchild interactions that assessed sen-\nsitivity to the child's interest and affect, development of reci-\nprocity and regular routines, and active participation on the\npart of parent (Rosenberg, Robinson, & Beck, 1986).\nParent\u00adchild interaction.Three items were loaded on this\nfactor: How well can you and your child share ideas or talk\nabout things that really matter (reverse-coded: 1 = not very\nwell at all to 4 = very well); in the past week, how many days\ndid all members of the family eat together (0-7); and, during\nthe past 12 months, how often did you attend events your\nchild participated in (1 = never to 4 = always). A higher score\nindicates higher level of parent\u00adchild interaction.\nDevelopmental outcomes\nPositive social behaviors. This factor was made up of four\nitems that asked parents to report on a 5-point scale (1 = never\nto 5 = always) the frequency with which children engaged in\nthe following behaviors: gets along with other children; tries\nto understand other people's feelings; tries resolve conflicts\nwith classmates, family, or friends; and shows respect for\nteachers and neighbors.\n6 SAGE Open\nNegative social behaviors. This construct was made up of\nfour items that asked parents to report on a 5-point scale\n(1 = never to 5 = always) the frequency with which chil-\ndren engaged in the following behaviors: argues too much,\nbullies or is cruel or mean to others, disobedient, and stub-\nborn, sullen, or irritable. A higher score indicates that the\nchild engages in negative social behaviors with a higher\nfrequency.\nData Analytic Approach\nA multigroup SEM was conducted using AMOS 6.0 program\n(Arbuckle, 2005) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation\nprocedures. The model incorporated the macrosystem (SES),\nmicrosystem (neighborhood social capital and family and par-\nenting stress), and proximal process (parent\u00adchild interactions)\nconstructs to examine gender differences in the associations\nTable 1.

The indicators of parent\u00adchild interactions\nwere mostly positively correlated with the indicators of posi-\ntive social behaviors, but negatively associated with the indi-\nces of negative social behaviors. Finally, the indicators of\npositive social behaviors were negatively correlated with\nindices of negative social behaviors.\nThe Full Model\nThe goodness-of-fit for the unconstrained model, showed\n.001; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .95, Root Mean Square\nError of Approximation (RMSEA) = .03, Test of close fit\n(PCLOSE) = 1.00. This implies that the hypothesized casual\nmodel of the associations among the constructs is tenable.\nThe unconstrained model (Figure 2) explained 74% and 54%\nof the variation in positive social behavior for boys and girls,\nrespectively, and 73% and 70% of the variation in negative\nsocial behavior for boys and girls, respectively.\nTo test for differences in slope between boys and girls, a\nsecond model with equality constraints placed on all param-\neters was estimated. A chi-square test of difference between\nthe unconstrained and equality-constrained models, 2(30 df)\nmoderated by gender. To make interpretation of the results\neasier to follow and consistent with the questions investi-\ngated, we discuss the findings pertaining to each construct\nsequentially. In reporting the findings, we use unstandard-\nized coefficients, because using standardized coefficients\ncould mask any significant differences that may exist\nbetween the path coefficients boys and girls (Kline, 1998)\nSES effects. The results showed that for boys and girls, living\nin a higher SES family was positively correlated with neigh-\nborhood social capital (boys = .49, girls = .48), and negatively\nwith family and parenting stress (boys = -.13, girls = -.12).\nFurthermore, although children living in higher SES families\nexperienced increased parent\u00adchild interactions (boys = .13,\ngirls = .05), there was a significant difference in such interac-\ntions (z = 3.66, p < .001); boys were more likely to benefit than\ngirls. In addition, there appears to be an attenuation effect in\nthe association between SES and both positive and negative\nchild behaviors. Specifically, for both genders, the observed\nrelation between SES and positive child behaviors in the\nunconstrained model was negative (boys = -.16, girls = -.04),\na reversal of coefficients signs from the expected. Further\nexploration (data available from the authors) revealed that\nwhen only SES and neighborhood social capital are included\nin a submodel, the association between SES and positive\nsocial behaviors was in the expected direction (boys = .04,\nFinally, in terms of negative child behaviors, its correla-\ntion with SES was reduced to nonsignificance in the uncon-\nstrained model (boys = -.03, girls = -.02). As before, a\nsubmodel using only SES and neighborhood social capital as\npredictors of negative social behaviors revealed a significant\nassociation between SES and negative social behaviors for\nboth genders (boys = -.24, girls = -.17). These patterns of\nfindings suggest that family and parenting stress and parent\u00ad\nchild interaction factors may attenuate and mediate the\neffects of SES on child outcomes.\nNeighborhood social capital effects. Neighborhood social capi-\ntal was negatively associated with family and parenting\nstress (boys = -.15, girls = -.14), and positively with parent\u00ad\nchild interactions (boys = .08, girls = .06), with the associa-\ntion being much stronger for boys than for girls (z = 2.29,\np = .01). As with the attenuation effects observed with SES,\nthere appears to be an attenuation effect regarding the asso-\nciation between neighborhood social capital and both posi-\ntive and negative child behaviors. Specifically, for both\ngenders, the correlation observed between neighborhood\nsocial capital and child positive behaviors in the uncon-\nstrained model was negative (boys = -.05, girls = -.01), a\nfinding inconsistent with expectations because of the rever-\nsal of the regression coefficient signs. A submodel analysis\nusing only SES and neighborhood social capital as predictors\nof child outcome showed the association between neighbor-\nhood social capital and positive social behaviors to be posi-\ntive (boys = .06, girls = .05). Also, neighborhood social\ncapital was positively associated with negative social behav-\niors for both genders (boys = .07, girls = .06), a finding\ninconsistent with expectations. A submodel analysis as pre-\nviously reported revealed a negative association between\nneighborhood social capital and negative social behaviors\nFamily and parenting stress effects.Family and parenting\nstress was negatively correlated with positive social behav-\niors (boys = -.05, girls = -.09) and parent\u00adchild interactions\nTable 2.

The observed negative associa-\ntion with parent\u00adchild interaction was much stronger for\nboys than for girls (z = -2.83, p = .002). Finally, family and\nparenting stress was positively associated with negative\nsocial behaviors (boys = .93, girls = .85), with the effect\nbeing much stronger for boys than for girls (z = 1.96, p < 05).\nEffects of parent\u00adchild interactions.Parent\u00adchild interactions\nwas positively linked with positive social behaviors (boys =\n1.19, girls = .70) and negatively with negative social behav-\niors (boys = -.44, girls = -.53). The association with positive\nsocial behaviors was much stronger for boys than for girls (z\n= 4.81, p < 001), whereas the correlation with negative social\nbehaviors was much stronger for girls than for boys\nThe power of proximal processes. We examined the standard-\nized total effects to investigate our hypothesis that proximal\nprocesses will have a more powerful effect on child positive\nand negative social behaviors than contextual factors. For\nnegative social behaviors, we found family and parenting\nstress (b = .85 for boys, b = .83 for girls) to have the most\npowerful effect, with proximal processes (parent\u00adchild rela-\ntions) being the second most powerful (b = -.18 for boys,\nb = -.20 for girls). Conversely, in terms of positive social\nbehaviors, parent\u00adchild interactions had the most powerful\neffect (b = .86 for boys, b = .62 for girls), whereas family and\nparenting stress had the second most powerful effect\n(b = -.63 for boys, b = -.55 for girls).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe current study investigated a number of propositions\nbasedonBronfenbrenner'sbioecologicaltheory.Specifically,\nwe hypothesized that (a) contextual influences--SES, neigh-\nborhood, and parenting factors--will be mediated by proxi-\nmal processes--parent\u00adchild interactions, (b) proximal\nprocesses will have a more powerful impact on children's\nNeighborhood\nSocial Capital\nMale R\nFemale R\nFamily and\nParenng Stress\nMale R\nFemale R\nPosive Social\nBehavior\nMale R\nFemale R\nSocioeconomic\nStatus\nParent-Child\nInteracons\nMale R\nFemale R\nNegave Social\nBehavior\nMale R\nFemale R\na\na\na\na\na\na\nModel 7: Full Model Goodness-of-Fit\n\nFigure 2.

In accordance with our hypothesis,\nwe found that the effects of SES (a macrosystem construct) on\nchild positive and negative social behaviors was mediated\nthrough its association with neighborhood social capital and\nfamily and parenting stress (microsystem factors), and parent\u00ad\nchild interactions (proximal processes). The meditational\nhypothesis is also consistent with the family stress model's\nview that SES is associated with children's outcomes via paren-\ntal mental health and family processes, and subsequently,\nadversely impacting parenting behaviors (Evans, 2004; Knerr\net al., 2013), and ultimately, children's outcomes. The fact that\npart of the effect of SES on children's developmental outcomes\nwas mediated by its association with neighborhood social capi-\ntal suggests that among parents, their experiences with social\nrelationships within neighborhoods can buffer economic con-\nditions by reducing parental stress and distress and improving\nparenting (Cook, Shagle, & Degirmencioglu, 1997).\nAlso, consistent with Bronfenbrenner's views\nthat child characteristics may interact with contextual fac-\ntors, we found that the association between SES (a macro-\nsystem construct) and parent\u00adchild relations (proximal\nprocesses) was stronger for boys than for girls. The observed\ndifferential relations may suggest that given that male chil-\ndren are at an increased risk of engaging in negative social\nbehaviors (Griffin, Botvin, Scheier, Diaz, & Miller, 2000),\nparents may intentionally increase their interactions with\ntheir male children while they are younger to create bonds\nthat build bridges as children get older. With such bonds\nbetween parents and their male children, the influence of\npeers on negative social behaviors may be minimized.\nThe findings also revealed that the association between\nSES and positive social behaviors may be attenuated;\nwhereas, the effects of SES on negative social behaviors was\nfound to be nonsignificant. Taken together, these results are\nconsistent with the view that although SES may be associ-\nated with children's socioemotional competence, the associ-\nation may not be as strong (Barajas et al., 2008; Bradley &\nCorwyn, 2002). Specifically, it suggests that other factors\nmay partially or wholly explain the association between fam-\nily socioeconomic circumstances and child developmental\noutcomes. It also highlights Bronfenbrenner's arguments\nthat contexts and processes that are closer to children, and in\nwhich children actively participate have a more salient influ-\nence on their developmental outcomes (Bronfenbrenner &\nFurthermore, consistent with our hypothesis, the associa-\ntions between neighborhood social capital and child positive\nand negative behaviors appeared to be attenuated by family\nand parenting stress and parent\u00adchild relations. The attenua-\ntion effect may explain the view that the associations between\nneighborhoods and children's behavioral and emotional\nproblems are less consistent than those reported for cognitive\nand school outcomes (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).\nSpecifically, the associations between neighborhood social\ncapital and child positive and negative behavior were medi-\nated by its links with both family and parenting stress and\nparent\u00adchild interactions. The observed meditation is conso-\nnant with reports that the effects of neighborhoods on child\nsocioemotional development are mediated by parental psy-\nchological distress, family processes, and parenting behav-\nThe observed stronger association between neighborhood\nsocial capital and parent\u00adchild relations (proximal processes)\nfor boys compared with girls may reflect differential parent-\ning behaviors toward boys and girls (Chaplin, Cole, & Zahn-\nWaxler, 2005), and may buttress the aforementioned point\nthat parents increase their interactions with their male chil-\ndren while they are younger to create bonds that build bridges\nas they get older.\nIn line with our hypothesis and Bronfenbrenner's argu-\nment (Bronfenbrenner, 1995a; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci,\ncesses (parent\u00adchild interactions) will mediate the effect of\nmicrosystem factors (family and parenting stress), we found\nthat the effect of family and parenting stress on positive and\nnegative child behavior was mediated by parent\u00adchild inter-\nactions. Specifically, consistent with findings in the family\nand parenting stress diminishes parent\u00adchild interactions,\nwhich, in turn, affected child positive and negative social\nbehaviors.\nFurthermore, consistent with Bronfenbrenner's (Bronfen\n& Evans, 2000) argument that the context interacts with\nchild characteristics to influence developmental outcomes,\nwe found that higher levels of family and parenting stress\nwas more deleterious to boys' positive social behaviors than\nit is for girls. That is to say, when family and parenting stress\nincreases, it has more of a negative effect on boys' positive\nsocial behaviors than it does for girls. Simply put, increased\nfamily and parenting stress put boys at risk for diminished\npositive social behaviors. Furthermore, increased levels of\nfamily and parenting stress had a greater impact on boys'\nengagement in negative social behaviors than it did for girls.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that family and par-\nenting stress may be more detrimental for boys by adversely\naffecting the quality of their interactions with parents, which,\nin turn, increases their engagement in negative social behav-\niors. This finding may lend some credence to an earlier argu-\nment that the reason why SES and neighborhood social\nAshiabi and O'Neal 11\ncapital may be associated with a significant increase in inter-\nactions between parents and their male children compared\nwith their female children may be the realization by parents\nthat decreasing interaction with sons increases the risk of\nengagement in negative social behaviors and decreases the\nprobability of engaging in positive social behaviors.\nIn support of Bronfenbrenner's view (Bronfenbrenner,\nproximal processes is a function of the person and develop-\nmental outcome, the findings showed that association\nbetween parent\u00adchild interactions (proximal process) and\nchild positive and negative social behaviors varied as a func-\ntion of child characteristics (gender). Specifically, we found\nthat increased levels of parent\u00adchild interactions promoted\nboys' positive social behaviors to a greater extent than girls'.\nIn addition, increased levels of parent\u00adchild interactions\nwere more beneficial to reducing girls' negative social\nbehaviors than that of boys. These findings are also conso-\nnant with Bronfenbrenner's views (Bronfenbrenner, 1995a)\nthat the specific impact of proximal processes on develop-\nmental outcomes may differ depending on the developmen-\nIn using the standardized total effects of each factor as\nindicator of strength, we found partial support for our hypoth-\nesis that proximal processes will have a stronger effect on\nchild outcomes than contextual factors. Specifically, we\nfound that depending on the developmental outcome, con-\ntextual factors\u00adin this instance family and parenting stress--\nwere stronger in predicting negative social behaviors.\nAlternatively, in terms of positive social behaviors, parent\u00ad\nchild interactions (proximal processes) was a stronger pre-\ndictor. These findings could mean that (a) our measure of\nparent\u00adchild interactions was not sensitive enough or (b)\ndepending on developmental outcome, contextual factors\nmay be more salient.\nLimitations of the Study\nAlthough the present study adds to the existing literature,\nthere are some limitations worth mentioning. First, given\nthat this was a secondary analysis of survey data, it has the\nlimitations encountered when using pre-existing data. For\nexample, the measure of parent\u00adchild interactions utilized in\nthe study may not capture many dimensions of the construct\nof interest because of its restricted range. Second, the study\nwas cross-sectional, thus it cannot address the pathways\nthrough which neighborhood and contextual factors affect\nchild positive and negative social behaviors. As such, the\nfourth component of Bronfenbrenner's PPCT model, time,\ncannot be addressed. Furthermore, although the hypothe-\nsized model tested was supported, it is not exhaustive; equiv-\nalent models with different paths and constructs than those\nincluded in this study also could account for the variation\nobserved. Another limitation was that the data used represent\ndifferent age groups, thus limiting the generalizability of the\nfindings. Given these limitations, it would be useful to exam-\nine the model using a more diversified sample in a longitudi-\nnal analysis study to Bronfenbrenner's hypotheses.\nConclusion\nAs Bronfenbrenner and Evans (2000) noted, the bioecologi-\ncal model is not a theory about how human beings develop,\nbut rather, it aims to improve our understanding about the\nconditions and processes that influence human development.\nIn that regard, we believe that this present enterprise has fur-\nthered our knowledge about the contextual conditions and\nprocesses that influence children's positive and negative\nsocial development. An outline of the main conclusions of\nour study is as follows: First, the effects of contextual fac-\ntors--macro- and microsystem variables (SES, neighbor-\nhood social capital, and family and parenting stress)--on\nchild social development were partially mediated by proxi-\nmal processes (parent\u00adchild interactions). Second, as was\ntheorized by Bronfenbrenner, some of the effects of contex-\ntual factors on child social development were modified\n(moderated) by child gender. As well, the effects of proximal\nprocesses on child positive and negative social behaviors dif-\nfered significantly by child gender. Finally, we found partial\nsupport for the hypothesis that proximal processes will have\na more powerful effect on development than the context in\nwhich it occurs.\nWe conclude with the observation by Bronfenbrenner\n(1995a) that he hoped his work \"would impel others to seek\nclosure and yield scientific insights\" (pp. 619-620). We also\nhope that our undertaking will engage others to explore dif-\nferent domains and questions utilizing Bronfenbrenner's bio-\necological theory.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAneshensel, C.
