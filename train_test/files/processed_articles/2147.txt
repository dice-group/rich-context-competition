In these analyses, treatment with high-\ndose ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduced mortality and CHF\nreadmissions more than the medium- and low-dose treat-\nments combined (Figure).\nComment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to\nestimate the effect of different doses of ACE inhibitors\nand ARBs on all-cause mortality and CHF readmission\nin patients 65 years or older with a first CHF admission.\nUnlike clinical trials, our study included a representa-\ntive sample of unselected patients with CHF and re-\nflects real-world clinical practice. We demonstrated that,\nof over 43 000 patients with CHF, approximately one-\nthird were prescribed low doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.\nLow-dose users had significantly greater all-cause mor-\ntality and CHF readmissions. Both ACE inhibitors and\nARBs decreased mortality and the composite end point\nin a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose users hav-\ning the best outcome. However, ACE inhibitors were more\neffective than ARBs at reducing the composite end point.\nOur results demonstrate that target doses of ACE inhibi-\ntors or ARBs are reached in only one-third of patients with\nCHF. Physicians should strive, whenever possible, to treat\npatients with CHF with high doses of ACE inhibitors or\nARBs to improve outcomes.\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of Internal Medicine, McGill\nUniversity Health Centre, Montreal General Hospital (Mr\nEgiziano and Drs Pilote and Daskalopoulou), and Divi-\nsion of Clinical Epidemiology, McGill University Health\nCentre, Royal Victoria Hospital (Drs Pilote and Behlouli),\nMontreal, Quebec, Canada.\nCorrespondence: Dr Daskalopoulou, Division of Gen-\neral Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, McGill\nUniversity Health Centre, Montreal General Hospital,\nCanada (stella.daskalopoulou@mcgill.ca).\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Daskalo-\npoulou.

Estimating causal effects from large data sets using propensity scores.\nFrequency of Prescription Pain Reliever\nThe public health consequences associated with the\nnonmedical use of prescription pain relievers such\nasoxycodone,hydrocodone,andmethadonehave\npeople died of overdoses involving these drugs--a 109%\nincrease since 2002.2 Prior studies examining prescrip-\ntion pain reliever overdose deaths found that nonmedical\nuse was common among decedents before death.3,4 Na-\ntional estimates of past-year nonmedical use of these drugs,\nmatesincludethespectrumofnonmedicalusersfromthose\nwho used pain relievers once or twice to those who were\nmore frequent or chronic nonmedical users. This Re-\nsearch Letter attempts to determine if the subset of chronic\nnonmedical users of pain relievers--those using 200 days\nor more in the past year--has increased since 2002, in par-\nallel with fatal overdoses of these drugs. Understanding\ntrends in the frequency of nonmedical use can help iden-\ntify populations at greatest risk for overdoses.\nMethods. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health\n(NSDUH), an annual survey of the noninstitutionalized,\ncivilian population 12 years and older, provides national\nestimates of substance use in the United States.

These es-\ntimates were then converted to rates of PYNMU per 1000\npeople 12 years and older. Two-tailed t tests were used\nto test significant differences between the periods in the\nannual average rates of frequency of PYNMU overall, by\nsex, and by age group. Statistical significance was deter-\nmined at the P.05 level.\nResults. There was a significant increase in PYNMU of\ncrease during the period. The total number of person-\ndays of PYNMU increased significantly among male re-\nfemale respondents, any PYNMU did not change; a sig-\nnificant decrease in 1 to 29 days of PYNMU was seen dur-\ning the 2 periods.\nAmong age groups, any PYNMU among people aged\nto 34 years and 50 years and older age groups had in-\nincreased significantly among those aged 18 to 25 years,\ndays among people 50 years and older more than doubled\nbut did not reach statistical significance (P = .08).\nof chronic nonmedical use--PYNMU of 200 days or\nmore--increased significantly (74.6%), while overall\nPYNMU did not change. This finding is important be-\ncause it parallels increases in overdose deaths, treat-\nment admissions, and other negative effects associated\nwith opioid pain relievers in recent years.1,7\nVariation in annual average rates of PYNMU among\nage groups and sex were also found.

This study evaluates trends in\nprostate cancer incidence following the release of the 2008\nUSPSTF recommendation. If the revised recommenda-\ntion led to a decline in prostate cancer screening rates,\nthere should be a corresponding decline in the inci-\ndence of early-stage tumors among men 75 and older rela-\ntive to trends in the incidence of late-stage tumors and\nearly-stage tumors in younger men.\nMethods.
