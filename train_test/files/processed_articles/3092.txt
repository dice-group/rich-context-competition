Whether workplace and home smoking restrictions play a role in\nsuch prevention is unknown.\nObjective To assess the association between workplace and home smoking restric-\ntions and adolescent smoking.\nDesign, Setting, and Subjects Data were analyzed from 2 large national population-\nMain Outcome Measures Smoking status of the adolescents surveyed, com-\npared by presence of home and workplace smoking restrictions.\nResults After adjusting for demographics and other smokers in the household, ado-\nlescents who lived in smoke-free households were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI],\n62%-88%) as likely to be smokers as adolescents who lived in households with no\nsmoking restrictions. Similarly, adolescents who worked in smoke-free workplaces\na workplace with no smoking restrictions. Adolescent smokers were 1.80 (95% CI,\n1.23-2.65) times more likely to be former smokers if they lived in smoke-free homes.\nThe most marked relationship of home smoking restrictions to current adolescent\nsmoking occurred in households where all other members were never-smokers. Cur-\nrent smoking prevalence among adolescents in homes without smoking restrictions\napproached that among adolescents in homes with a current smoker but with smoking\nrestrictions.\nConclusions Parents with minor children should be encouraged to adopt smoke-\nfree homes. Smoke-free workplaces can also augment smoking prevention. These find-\nings emphasize the importance of tobacco control strategies aimed at the entire popu-\nlation rather than at youth alone.\nwork. Although few young adoles-\ncents are employed, by midadoles-\ncence many have part-time jobs. While\nthere is evidence of an association be-\ntween home smoking restrictions and\nlittle information about their poten-\ntial impact on adolescents. Assuming\nsuch an association, public policy that\nencourages parents to voluntarily adopt\nhome smoking restrictions might prove\nuseful for prevention of adolescent\nsmoking. Two studies showed less\nsmoking experimentation among\nelementary school students living in\nhouseholds that restricted smok-\nined middle school students and found\na similar effect. Only 1 study has ex-\namined home smoking restrictions in\nrelationship to smoking among high\nschool students; it also included middle\nschool students and analyzed current\nregular smoking instead of experimen-\ntation, but no significant relationship\nThe objective of this study was to ex-\namine whether household and work-\nplace smoking restrictions are associ-\nated with lower rates of adolescent\nsmoking. We used data from popula-\ntion-based surveys conducted in the\nyears of age. Thus, we explore the re-\nlationship of smoking restrictions to\ncurrent or former smoking at the time\nof the interview.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nWe combined data from 6 monthly Cur-\nrent Population Surveys (CPSs) con-\ncontainedaspecialTobaccoUseSupple-\nment.33 The CPSs are conducted con-\ntinuously by the US Census Bureau for\nlaborforcemonitoring;theycovertheci-\nvilian, noninstitutionalized population\nprobability sample based on a stratified\nsampling scheme of clusters of house-\nhouseholds containing approximately\nforce interviews are conducted with an\nadult household member who re-\nsponds for all eligible household mem-\nbers.Incontrast,thespecialTobaccoUse\nSupplement was individually adminis-\nteredtoeachhouseholdmemberaged15\nyearsorolder.ResponseratesfortheCPS\nLabor Force Core Questionnaire were\nover 93% for the 6 monthly surveys,\nwhile the self-response rates for the To-\nbacco Use Supplement were over 84%.\nAbout a quarter of the interviews were\nconducted in person with the remain-\nder conducted by telephone. We re-\nteenaged self-respondents who were 15\nto 17 years of age when surveyed.\nMeasures\nSmoking Status. Tobacco Use Supple-\nment respondents were asked, \"Have\nyou smoked at least 100 cigarettes\nin your entire life?\" Those responding\n\"no\" were classified as never-smokers,\nwhile those responding \"yes\" were clas-\nsified as smokers. Smokers were asked,\n\"Doyounowsmokecigaretteseveryday,\nsome days, or not at all?\" Respondents\nwho answered \"every day\" or \"some\ndays\" were classified as current smok-\nerswhilethosewhoanswered\"notatall\"\nwere considered former smokers.\nHousehold Smokers. Adolescent re-\nspondents were divided into 3 groups,\ndepending on the presence of current,\nformer, and never-smokers aged 15\nyears or older in the household. For this\npurpose, the smoking status of the other\nhousehold members was used even if\nobtained by proxy report. Adolescents\nin the first group lived with never-\nsmokers only; adolescents in the sec-\nond group lived with at least 1 former\nsmoker but no current smokers; and\nadolescents in the third group lived with\nat least 1 current smoker.\nHome Smoking Restrictions. To de-\ntermine the level of household smok-\ningrestrictions,respondentswereasked,\n\"Which statement best describes the\nrulesaboutsmokinginyourhome?\"Re-\nsponse choices were: (1) no one is al-\nlowed to smoke anywhere, (2) smok-\ning is allowed in some places or at some\ntimes, or (3) smoking is permitted any-\nwhere. These responses were desig-\nnated as smoke-free, partial ban, and no\nsmoking restrictions, respectively.\nWorkplace Smoking Restrictions.\nEmployment status and workplace\nsmoking restrictions were used to as-\nsign each adolescent respondent to one\nof 5 categories. The workplace policy\nquestions were asked only of adoles-\ncents who worked in either the public\norprivatesectorsandworkedindoorsbut\nnot in someone's home. Indoor work-\ners were asked, \"Which of these best de-\nscribes your place of work's smoking\npolicy for indoor public or common ar-\neassuchaslobbies,restrooms,andlunch\nrooms?\" and \"Which of these best de-\nscribes your place of work's smoking\npolicyforworkareas?\"Responsechoices\nfor both questions were: (1) not al-\nlowed in any (public/work) areas, (2) al-\nlowed in some (public/work) areas, and\n(3) allowed in all (public/work) areas.\nThose who answered that smoking was\n\"not allowed in any public areas\" and\n\"not allowed in any work areas\" were\nclassifiedasworkinginsmoke-freework-\nplaces. Those who only answered that\nsmoking was \"not allowed in any work\nareas\" were classified as working under\na work-area ban. The remaining indoor\nworkers were classified as working un-\nder a partial work-area ban. Depending\non employment status, the remaining\nadolescentswereclassifiedaseitherother\nworkers (mostly outdoor workers or\nworkers in someone's home) or non-\nworkers.\nSchool Enrollment and Hours\nWorked. School enrollment was ascer-\ntainedbyproxyorself-responseforper-\nthe survey asked, \"Last week was ( . . . )\nattending or enrolled in a high school,\ncollege or university?\" and for those 15\nyears or older employed in the previous\nweek,\"Howmanyhoursdid( . . . )work\nquestions changed slightly: \"Last week,\nwas( . . . )enrolledinahighschool,col-\nlege or university?\" and \"How many\nhours per week did ( . . . ) usually work\natthemainjob?\"and\"Howmanyhours\nperweekdid( . . . )usuallyworkatother\n(job/jobs)?\"\nStatistical Methods\nThe public-use data files for the 6 sur-\nveys included a weighting variable for\nself-respondents that ensures esti-\nmates from the combined sample for\nlation by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and\nregion. Besides adjusting for demo-\ngraphic differences in nonresponse, the\nweights also take into account the sam-\npling design.\n2 Procedures were used to assess dif-\nferences among percentages (Yates-\nadjusted for 22 tables, and Mantel-\nHaenszel when a graded response was\nexpected).

Par-\ntial smoking restrictions were not sig-\nnificantly associated with cessation. Un-\nlike ever-smoking, cessation was not\nsignificantly related to workplace smok-\ning restrictions.\nHousehold Composition,\nHome Smoking Restrictions, and\nAdolescent Smoking Prevalence\nAdolescents living with a current\nsmoker had the highest smoking preva-\nlence (FIGURE 3). Prevalence was about\nthe same for adolescents living with a\ncurrent smoker under either a partial\nsmoking ban or in a smoke-free home,\nbut was lower compared with those\nwith no household smoking restric-\ntions (P=.02). In households with a\nformer smoker (but no current smok-\ners), there was no significant relation-\nship between smoking restrictions and\nprevalence (P=.09). When adoles-\ncents lived only with never-smokers,\nhowever, the level of home smoking re-\nstriction was highly associated with\nprevalence (P.001). Note that preva-\nlence for the group with no home smok-\ning restrictions was only slightly higher\nthan prevalence in households with at\nleast 1 former smoker, and it ap-\nproached the level for adolescents liv-\ning with a current smoker in house-\nholds with only a partial restriction.\nCOMMENT\nThe results from these national sur-\nveys strongly suggest that smoke-free\nworkplaces and homes are associated\nwith significantly lower rates of ado-\nlescent smoking. Further, even after ad-\njustment for the presence of smokers\nin the household and school enroll-\nment, smoke-free homes have a greater\nassociation with lower rates of smok-\ning prevalence than smoke-free work-\nplaces. In addition, smoke-free homes\nwere associated with an increased like-\nlihood of smoking cessation in adoles-\ncent smokers. Complete rather than\npartial bans on smoking in the home\nand in the workplace produced the\nmost significant associations.\nBecause only about 25% of adoles-\ncents are employed, smoke-free homes\nshould affect adolescent smoking more\nFigure 1.

Al-\nthough a smoke-free workplace was as-\nsociated with a significantly reduced\nlikelihood of an adolescent becoming\na smoker, it may not completely counter\nthe influence of the increased income\na job provides. Adolescents with more\nspending money, either from employ-\nment or other sources, are more likely\nto smoke, and smoke more on average\nthan adolescents with less discretion-\nary spending money.35\nIt is well-known that adolescents of\nparentswhosmokearemorelikelytobe-\njusted for the smoking status of other\nhousehold members, generally the par-\nents. We previously showed that ado-\nlescents whose parents had quit smok-\ning were only about two thirds as likely\ntobesmokersasthosewithaparentwho\nstillsmoked.40 Further,adolescentsmok-\ners whose parents had quit were twice\nas likely to be former smokers when sur-\nveyed than those with a parent who still\nsmoked. Finally, the earlier in the ado-\nlescent's life that parents quit, the lower\nthe risk of their adolescent smoking.\nAdult smokers (18 years or older) who\nlived or worked under smoke-free con-\nditions were more likely to be actively\ntrying to quit and were more likely to be\nin cessation for at least 6 months when\nsurveyed than were those reporting no\nhome or workplace smoking restric-\ntions.28 Thus, smoke-free homes and\nworkplaces may also have an indirect ef-\nfect on adolescent smoking by encour-\naging parental cessation.\nAdoptionofasmoke-freehomepolicy\nsends a message to family members that\nsmoking is not condoned, while the lack\nof such a policy may send the opposite\nmessage. Adolescents who lived in\nhouseholds without a complete ban\nwhere all of the other members were\nnever-smokers were nearly as likely to\nbe current smokers as adolescents who\nlived in households with a current\nsmoker and at least partial household\nsmoking restrictions. Public health\npolicy should continue to educate the\npopulation concerning the dangers of\nsecondhand smoke and stress that\nadopting smoke-free homes is some-\nthing concrete that parents can do to in-\nfluence their children not to smoke.\nTobacco control efforts should also\ncontinue to encourage smoke-free\nworkplace ordinances throughout the\nUnited States. Besides protecting non-\nsmokers from secondhand smoke and\nencouraging smoking cessation among\nadults, smoke-free workplaces may be\nan important strategy for reducing the\npercentage of adolescents who be-\ncome smokers. Adolescents who ex-\nperiment with smoking and spend a sig-\nnificant amount of their time at work\nwhere smoking is prohibited may not\nbe as likely to progress to established\nsmoking. However, longitudinal stud-\nies are needed to establish this link.\nTherearesomelimitationstothepre-\nsent study. It is not longitudinal. Thus,\nthe results, while suggestive of impor-\ntant associations, are not definitive.\nSmoking status is by self-report, and it\nis not validated by biochemical assay;\nhowever, studies of adolescents have\nshown that there is stability of self-\nreported substance use and that ques-\ntionnaires provide reliable data.41 Sec-\nFigure 3.

Adoles-\ncentswhohavesmokedafairamountare\nprobably less inclined to try to hide it\nfrom parents (they likely already know)\nor to be embarrassed about it with the\ninterviewer. Finally, there is the issue of\nreporting discrepancy regarding home\nsmokingrestrictionsbyadolescentscom-\npared with household adults. House-\nholdadultsalsowereaskedabouthouse-\nhold smoking restrictions, and the\nagreement among parents and adoles-\ncents was high (81%). When there was\na household consensus, about the same\npercentage of adults reported more\nrestrictive smoking policies (9%) as less\nrestrictive policies (10%) when com-\npared with the adolescent. Perceived\npolicy is probably more important than\nactual policy set by household adults; if\nadolescents think there are smoking\nrestrictions, it is likely that they will act\naccordingly.\nIn summary, our findings suggest an\nimportant role for smoke-free homes\nand workplaces in reducing adoles-\ncent smoking. More importantly, they\nstress the importance of targeting to-\nbacco control interventions to the en-\ntire population for primary preven-\ntion rather than emphasizing special\nprograms aimed only at adolescents. As\nthe prevalence trends in the mid-\nadolescents indicate, it is likely that an-\nother downturn in adolescent smok-\ning would follow a significant further\ndecline in adult smoking.\nFunding/Support: Preparation of this article was sup-\nResearchUnitfromtheNationalInstitutesofHealthand\nland, Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program.\nREFERENCES\n1.
