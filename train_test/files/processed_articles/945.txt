Although screening for Chla-\nmydia trachomatis is widely recommended among young adult women, little infor-\nmation is available regarding the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections\nin the general young adult population.\nObjective To determine the prevalence of chlamydial and gonoccoccal infections in\na nationally representative sample of young adults living in the United States.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of a prospective co-\nyears.

Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are present in the prevalence of\nboth chlamydial and gonococcal infections.\ntions.2,6 Consequently, many major\nmedical organizations recommend\nscreening of adolescent and young adult\nwomen who are asymptomatic for chla-\nmydial infection.7-13 The identifica-\ntion of annual chlamydia screening\namong sexually experienced young\nwomen as a Health Plan Employer Data\nand Information Set measure14 for qual-\nity of care provided by managed care\norganizations highlights the recog-\nnized importance of screening. In con-\ntrast, chlamydia screening for men has\nbeen endorsed less consistently.9\nScreening for gonorrhea is recom-\nmended for high-risk women.8\nCurrent screening recommenda-\ntions are based primarily on reported\ncases and clinic-based prevalence esti-\nmates. These estimates are suboptimal\nfor informing policies because cases are\nunderreported and clinic populations\nhavelimitedgeneralizability.Population-\nbasedstudiesprovidemoreaccurateand\nrepresentative prevalence estimates.\nHowever, to our knowledge, the only\nprevious national prevalence estimate of\nchlamydialinfectionintheUnitedStates\nwaslimitedtoyoungmenandhadarela-\ntively small sample size.15 Other preva-\nlence estimates have been limited to\nsingle urban areas.16,17 Wave III of The\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Ado-\nlescentHealth(AddHealth)providesthe\nfirst opportunity to determine the na-\ntional prevalence of chlamydial and\ngonococcal infection in young adult\nwomen and men in the United States.\nUsing Wave III Add Health data, we as-\nsessed the general population esti-\nmates of the prevalence of chlamydial\nand gonococcal infection among young\nadults from different racial and ethnic\ngroups. Additionally, we provided esti-\nmates of overlap of gonorrhea and chla-\nmydial infections.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Sample\nAdd Health is a prospective cohort\nadolescents into adulthood.18 We de-\nscribe cross-sectional analyses based on\noriginal Wave I participants currently\nliving in the continental United States,\nHawaii, and Alaska. The University of\nNorth Carolina institutional review\nboard approved all study procedures.\nThe sampling design for Add Health\nhas been described in detail else-\nfor the original Add Health sample in-\ncluded all high schools in the United\nStates with an 11th grade and at least 30\nenrollees in the school. From this sam-\nplingframe,asystematicrandomsample\nintheUnitedStateswaschosenwithun-\nequal probability of selection. The sam-\npling of schools was stratified to en-\nsurethattheschoolswererepresentative\nof US schools with respect to region, ur-\nbanicity,schooltype,percentageofwhite\nstudents, and school size. For each high\nschoolselected,thelargestfeederschool,\nusually a middle school, was also re-\ncruited.\nThe original study participants were\nidentified from rosters of students in\ngrades 7 through 12 enrolled in the se-\nschool year. The random sample of stu-\ndents was stratified by grade and sex.\nBlack youth in families with relatively\nhigher socioeconomic status and cer-\ntain Latino groups were oversampled\nto increase the precision of estimates for\nthese ethnic groups. For Wave III, post-\nstratification sampling weights were cal-\nculated to account for persons who\ncould not be located or refused to par-\nticipate. With these sampling weights,\naccounting for the school as the pri-\nmary sampling unit and using region\nof the country as a stratification vari-\nable, the Add Health cohort provided\na representative sample of young adults\naged 18 to 26 years in the United States.\nInterviews and\nSpecimen Collection\nAll original Wave I Add Health respon-\ndents who could be contacted were\nasked to identify a time and place for\nthe Wave III interview. An inter-\nviewer traveled to their home or an-\nother suitable location identified by the\npotential participant. After obtaining\nwritten consent for the interviews, in-\nterviewers conducted the approxi-\nmately 90-minute sessions in as pri-\nvate an area as possible. Interviewers\nentered questionnaire responses di-\nrectlyintoacomputer.Participantsused\ncomputer-assisted self-interview to an-\nswer potentially sensitive questions (eg,\nquestions about sexual behavior).\nConsent for testing for chlamydial\nand gonoccocal infections was ob-\ntained after interview completion. Par-\nticipants received $10 for providing a\nurine specimen. Participants who pro-\nvided a urine specimen received infor-\nmation regarding chlamydial, gonococ-\ncal, and other sexually transmitted\ninfections and were encouraged to call\na toll-free telephone number for test re-\nsults. Participants were also informed\nthat they were not being tested for all\nsexually transmitted infections and\nshould not view their participation in\nthe Add Health study as a substitute for\nhealth care. Results of assays for chla-\nmydial and gonococcal infections were\nnot reported to local public health de-\npartments, based on the terms of a Cer-\ntificate of Confidentiality obtained from\nthe US Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services. A more detailed descrip-\ntion of Add Health sexually transmit-\nted infection testing is available\nUrine specimens were collected in a\nThe target volume for testing was 15 to\n20 mL of first-void urine. Interviewers\ninstructed participants in the appro-\npriate collection techniques. Urine\nsamples were placed in coolers after col-\nlection. Specimens were maintained at\napproximately 4\u00b0C until they were\npackaged with fresh ice packs and\nshipped by overnight express to arrive\nat the laboratory by 10 AM the follow-\ning morning. Samples were received in\nthe laboratory within 4 days of collec-\ntion. Upon arrival, urine specimens\nwere inspected for adherence to appro-\npriate shipping conditions, including\nthe presence of the appropriate bar code\nlabel, date and time of collection, tem-\nperature on arrival, and volume of\nurine. All urine samples were pro-\ncessed on the day of arrival by trained\nlaboratory technologists.\nCtrachomatisandNgonorrhoeaewere\nidentified in urine specimens by using\nligase chain reaction (LCR) assays (Ab-\nbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill). Li-\ngase chain reaction assays were per-\nformed according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions, except that specimens ex-\nceeding the recommended volume of\n20 mL were tested. The testing labora-\ntory performed sample processing in a\ndedicatedpreamplificationareathatwas\nmonitored routinely for contamina-\ntion by wipe testing. An open vial was\nmaintained on the bench top and then\ncarried through sample processing to\nmonitor contamination. A laboratory-\nprepared positive control was also pro-\ncessed with each run as an external\nmonitor of sample processing and de-\ntection. The postamplification area, in-\ncluding instrumentation, was moni-\ntored by wipe testing in a similar fashion\nto the preamplification area. Routine in-\nstrumentation monitoring and preven-\ntive maintenance was performed per the\nmanufacturer's recommendations. The\nLCR results were reviewed for accept-\nability by the responsible technologist\nas well as a second individual. Ligase\nchain reaction results were expressed\nas a signal to cutoff ratio determined by\nrelating the sample rate for each speci-\nmen to the cutoff value of assay cali-\nbrator duplicates. The Abbott ana-\nlyzer automatically performed these\ncalculations. All chlamydial and gono-\ncoccal samples with a signal to cutoff\nratio of at least 0.80 were retested to\nminimize the potential for false-\npositive test results.20 Retested samples\nwith a signal to cutoff ratio of at least\n1.00 were considered positive. All test\nresults were entered into a database by\nan individual technologist who used a\nbar code scanner to ensure accurate re-\nsult-sample identification. Two addi-\ntional reviewers verified the computer\nentry.\nAfter completion of data collection,\nAbbott Laboratories issued a recall for\ncertain lots of N gonorrhoeae LCR as-\nsays. Results from these assays (n=859,\n6.0%), whether positive or negative,\nwere excluded from the gonorrhea\nprevalence estimates.\nOutcome Measures\nIn addition to measuring the preva-\nlence of chlamydial and gonococcal in-\nfections, our analyses included 3 demo-\ngraphic variables: age based on reported\nbirth date, race/ethnicity (self-reported\nas white, black, Native American, Asian\nAmerican,orLatino),andgeographicre-\ngion of current residence (northeast,\nsouth, midwest, or west). In some cases,\nparticipant self-identified more than 1\nracial/ethnic group. In that circum-\nstance, we used a follow-up question\nidentifying the group with which a par-\nticipant primarily identified. We also in-\ncluded 3 measures assessing symp-\ntoms of infection in the 24-hour period\npreceding the interview: painful urina-\ntion(dysuria),urethraldischarge(men),\nand vaginal discharge (women).\nStatistical Analyses\nTo ensure the national representation\nof our prevalence estimates for chla-\nmydial and gonococcal infections, we\nused Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corp, Col-\nlege Station, Tex) to account for the\ncomplex survey design of Add Health,\nincorporating the school as the pri-\nmary sampling unit, region as a strati-\nfication variable, and appropriate post-\nstratification weights. We calculated\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) using\na logit transformation. Prevalence ra-\ntios with 95% CIs were calculated us-\ning Poisson regression for survey data.21\nAssessment of Test Performance\nand Nonresponse Biases\nGiven the relatively high prevalence of\nchlamydial infection and the potential\nimpact of our observations on chla-\nmydia screening policies, we con-\nducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the\neffects of 2 potential sources of bias, test\nperformance and nonresponse, on the\nprevalence estimates for chlamydial in-\nfection. We used plausible estimates of\nassess the potential impact of test im-\nperfection on the prevalence esti-\nvery low estimate (sensitivity=0.80\nand specificity=0.98) and a realistic es-\ntimate (sensitivity=0.90 and specific-\nperformed in conjunction with the as-\nsessment of the effects of nonresponse.\nIn Wave III of Add Health, 6% of the\noriginal Wave I study population re-\nfused participation and an additional\n19% could not be located or were un-\nabletoparticipateforotherreasons.Nine\npercent of the original study popula-\ntion did not have a urine specimen avail-\nable for chlamydial testing; 14% did not\nhave a specimen or result for gonococ-\ncal testing. This nonresponse can po-\ntentially bias the prevalence estimates\nunder 2 conditions: if the response rate\nvaries by an observed attribute, such as\nrace or sex, which is associated with\nprevalence; or if the nonrespondents\nhave a different pattern of prevalence\nfrom respondents with similar ob-\nserved attributes. In the latter case, an\nunobservedattributemayinfluenceboth\nsurvey participation and level of risk.\nTo address the first source of poten-\ntial nonresponse bias, we used post-\nstratification weights developed by the\nAdd Health research team to ensure that\nthe observed sample has the proper race\nand sex distribution.\nWe addressed the second potential\nsource of nonresponse bias through sen-\nsitivity analysis using the method de-\nscribedbyBrookmeyerandGail.24 Given\ntheproportionofmissingassays\nmiss\n,the\nprevalence in the observed assays +\nobs\n,\nand the prevalence ratio of infection for\nthemissingassayscomparedwiththeob-\nserved assays , the population preva-\nlence + can be estimated under differ-\nent assumptions about the prevalence\nratiofrom{[\nmiss\n+\nobs\nmiss\n)\n+\nobs\n]}.

Unlike chlamydial in-\nfection, gonorrhea is frequently symp-\ntomatic, especially in men, and com-\nmonly necessitates medical care.6\nFurthermore, the duration of gonococ-\ncal infections is believed to be shorter,27\nwhich will result in a relative reduc-\ntion in prevalence, compared with chla-\nmydial infection. However, the very low\nprevalence of gonorrhea in these na-\ntional estimates contrasts with a sub-\nstantially higher prevalence observed in\na population-based study in Balti-\nmore, Md, in which the estimated\nprevalence was 5.3% among adults aged\ntently had high reported incidence of\ngonorrhea,28 and undoubtedly, the ob-\nserved differences in prevalence re-\nlates to the highly clustered, geographi-\ncallyvarieddistributionofgonorrhea.1,28\nPrevious population-based studies of\nthe prevalence of chlamydial infection\nhave been limited in scope.15 Among\nyoung men, the prevalence of chla-\n26-year-olds, but the sample size was\nconsiderably smaller than the Add\nHealth study sample, prevalence was\nnot reported by race/ethnicity, and 95%\nCIs were not reported.15 Other popu-\nlation-based studies in Baltimore and\nSan Francisco, Calif, were limited geo-\nConsistent with these more limited\npopulation-based prevalence stud-\nies,15-17 our results confirm that preva-\nlence estimates obtained from clinic-\nbased data sources do not accurately\nreflect the true prevalence of chla-\nmydial infection among young adults.\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nused clinic-based test reports to esti-\nmate incidence rates for chlamydial in-\nyears.1 Converting the incidence rates of\nthe CDC to prevalence and assuming a\nmean duration of infection of 6 months\nlation prevalence of chlamydial infec-\nWe found that the prevalence of chla-\nmydial infection among young US men\nand women is much higher.

Young adults are\nmuch less likely to have health insur-\nance than any other age group and\nmany do not have a regular physician\nor receive routine health care.34,35 Young\nadults are often unaware of routine\nscreening recommendations for chla-\nmydial infection and do not know that\nof these factors are likely to lead to fewer\nopportunities to screen young adults for\nchlamydial infection in clinic settings.\nOur study, like all studies assessing\nthe prevalence of sexually transmitted\ninfections, is limited by the adequacy of\nthe study sample and the characteris-\ntics of the diagnostic test used. The ad-\nequacy of our study sample depends on\nthe representativeness of the original\nschool-basedsample,nonresponsetothe\nfollow-up survey for Wave III, and re-\nfusal or other problems that led to a\nmissing specimen among participants in\nWave III. Although the original sample\nincluded only students on school reg-\nisters, assessment of the impact of ex-\nclusion of adolescent school dropouts\nhas suggested that this bias in Add\nparticipants in Wave I could not be lo-\ncated for Wave III, this element of non-\nresponse has been accounted for in the\npoststratificationadjustmentofthesam-\npling weights for Wave III.

The high\nprevalence of chlamydial infection in\nboth men and women suggests that cur-\nrent screening approaches that focus\nprimarily on clinic-based testing of\nyoung women are inadequate.
