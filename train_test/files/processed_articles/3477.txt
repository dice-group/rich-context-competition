It can be easily\nattained from a CT scan and has obvious\nsuperiority to subjective parameters such as\na large fragment, significant segment,\nincompetent posterior wall, and hip stabil-\nity. The AFI is useful for preoperative and\nintraoperative evaluation when open reduc-\ntion or internal fixation is needed and for\npredicting the prognosis of a posterior wall\nacetabular fracture.12\nSeveral studies have been performed to\nevaluate the relationship between the AFI or\nfragment size and the stability of the\nrole of the AFI in the postoperative func-\ntional outcome in patients with posterior\nwall acetabular fracture. The aim of this\nretrospective case study was to determine\nthe inter-relationship of the AFI and other\nfactors with the functional outcome of\nacetabular fractures involving the posterior\nwall, including an isolated posterior wall\nfracture, a posterior column fracture with an\nassociated posterior wall fracture, and a\ntransverse fracture with an associated pos-\nterior wall fracture.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nA retrospective study was conducted on\n52 patients presenting with an acetabular\nfracture involving the posterior wall. All\npatients underwent surgical treatment by the\ncorresponding author at the Traumatic\nOrthopaedics Department of Xiangya\nFour patients were excluded: one because of\ntotal hip arthroplasty and three because of\nunavailable CT images. Ultimately, 48\npatients were included in the study.\nClinical data\nand 7 were females (14.6%), with a mean age\nTwenty fractures were on the right side\nwas bilateral (2.0%). The fracture etiologies\nincluded traffic accidents (35 patients,\n72.9%), falls from a height (7 patients,\nlower limb fracture (35.4%), 5 had brain\ninjury (10.4%), and 1 had iatrogenic sciatic\nnerve injury (2.1%). The mean duration\nfrom fracture to surgery was 9 days (range,\n3\u00ad30 days). The average surgical duration\nand the mean blood loss was 725 ml (range,\nmonths). Follow-up evaluations were per-\n36 months after surgery. Physical therapy,\nsuch as lower extremity muscle activity\nand continuous passive motion, was\nencouraged in all patients. Some patients\ncame from rural areas and had no access to\na physical therapy center for physical\ntherapy. All patients were traced for\nfollow-up functional assessment. The qual-\nity of fracture reduction was evaluated\naccording to the Matta radiological scoring\nOn the CT image of the fractured side, we\nselected the section that demonstrated the\nlargest amount of fractured posterior acet-\nabulum (i.e., the smallest intact remaining\nposterior acetabulum). In our patients, the\nselected section was sometimes at the level of\nthe central acetabular fossa. A contralateral\nsection was selected and matched by com-\nparing the sizes of the femoral heads and the\nconfiguration of the femoral fovea, acetab-\nular fossa, and pelvis. These sections were\nused for measurements.\nAFI measurement\nThe AFI was defined as the percentage of\nremaining intact posterior acetabular arc\n(A).12 It is described by the following\nrelationship:\nA \u00bc 2pR \u00c2 a b\nFurthermore,\nAFI \u00bc A a\n\u00f0 \u00de=A b\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\na\nb\nwhere A is the acetabular arc, R is the\nradius, a is the angle formed by the arc line\nto the remaining intact posterior acetabular\nmargin on the fractured side, and b is the\nangle formed by the arc line to the posterior\nacetabular margin on the contralateral\nnormal side (Figure 1).\nTwo methods were used to measure a and\nb: (1) For most patients whose CT scans\nSiemens, Munich, Germany) were per-\nformed in our hospital, we made direct\nmeasurements with a CT picture archiving\nand communication system (PACS) (DHC\nSoftware Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).

All measurements were repeated\nthree times by the same radiologic professor\nand orthopedic professor to minimize\nerrors. The mean AFI for all patients was\nGrouping\nThe 48 patients were classified into the\nfollowing groups according to the\npatients).

Measurement data\nare presented as mean \u00c6 standard deviation,\nmedian, semi-interquartile range, lower\n(25th) quartile, and upper (75th) quartile.\nEnumeration data are presented as percent-\nages or proportions. Two-sample t-tests\nand rank-sum tests were used for compari-\nsons among the groups. Single-factor\nanalysis was performed using two indepen-\ndent-sample nonparametric tests or multiple\nindependent-sample nonparametric tests.\nBecause a variety of factors had\nmutual interference and it was difficult to\nassess the influence of each factor on the\nfunctional outcome using single-factor\nanalysis, multiple-factor analyses were\nalso used. Multiple-factor analysis was\nperformed using ordinal regression. All\ndata were analyzed at a significance level\nof P < 0.05. Complete statistical ana-\nlysis was performed by a biostatistician\nconsultant.\nResults\nAll patients underwent follow-up evalu-\nations at every time point. No serious peri-\noperative complications were observed.\nOnly one patient had an iatrogenic sciatic\nnerve injury. This patient was treated with\nneurotrophic drugs for 3 months, and the\nmuscle strength and sensation were finally\ncompletely restored to normal at the 1-year\nfollow-up visit. All fractures were com-\npletely united at the 4-month follow-up\nvisit, which was confirmed by radiologic\nexamination.\nFigure 2. Straight lines created by the margins of the remaining intact posterior acetabulum on the\nfractured and normal sides were used to calculate the acetabular fracture index by the cosine theorem.\nTwenty-nine (60.4%) patients achieved\ngood reduction, and 4 (8.3%) achieved poor\nreduction.

Lower limb\ncorrelated with a lower functional score.\nDiscussion\nSeveral methods can be used to measure the\nsize of posterior wall acetabular fracture\nfragments. Keith et al.19 used CT scans to\nmeasure the size of the remaining acetabular\ndepths at the level of the transverse slice\ncompared with the normal contralateral side\nthrough the fovea of the femoral head in\nadult cadavers. Moed et al.14 and Reagan\nand Moed15 used the level of the transverse\nslice through the greatest percentage of\nposterior wall fracture involvement on CT\nscans. Calkins et al.12 selected the section\ncontaining the largest amount of fractured\nposterior acetabulum on the CT scan using a\nplastic template to mark the center of the\nacetabular arc and a goniometer to measure\nthe acetabular arc angle. The straight line of\nthe posterior acetabulum was measured to\ncalculate the approximate AFI, which clo-\nsely approximates the real AFI. In the\npresent study, this measurement was similar\nto that described by Calkins et al.12 Several\nmodifications were performed to collect\nhigher-quality data. First, we used CT\nPACS software to confirm the center of the\nacetabular arc, draw the acetabular arc, and\nmeasure the acetabular arc angle, which was\nmore convenient and precise than using a\nplastic template and goniometer. Second, we\nused the cosine theorem to calculate the\nacetabular arc angle and the real AFI\ninstead of the approximate AFI.\nWith respect to the influence of the size of\nthe posterior wall acetabular fracture frag-\nment, some studies have focused on the\nstability, articular contact area, and contact\nstress of the hip, but few have disclosed the\nrelationship between the fragment size and\nTable 2.

Hips were\neither stable or unstable between these\nvalues. In the present study, we found that\nthe size of the posterior wall acetabular\nfracture fragment could affect the hip joint\nfunctional outcome. The functional out-\ncome score was better with a greater AFI.\nMany factors other than the fracture frag-\nment size of the posterior wall affect the hip\njoint functional outcome, including hip dis-\nlocation, sciatic nerve injury, femoral head\ninjury or necrosis, reduction quality, trau-\nmatic arthritis, heterotopic ossification,\nphysical therapy, and others. Reduction\nquality is considered to be an important\nanatomic reduction of most displaced acet-\nabular fractures affords an optimal progno-\nsis, especially in younger patients. In the\npresent study, we also found that the reduc-\ntion quality significantly influenced the func-\ntional outcome. Our study also showed that\nthe functional outcome was better with\na physical therapy duration of >12 than\n<12 months. This result may be attributed\nto the different medical conditions among\nthe 48 patients studied. Some patients came\nfrom rural areas without any medical insur-\nance or access to a nearby physical therapy\ncenter. The patient's economic capability is\nanother factor affecting systemic or long-\nterm postoperative physical therapy. Thus,\npoor physical therapy conditions may result\nin a poor functional outcome. Heterotopic\nossification is a very common postoperative\ncomplication of acetabular fractures.24\nA significant amount of ectopic bone could\nresult in a !20% loss of hip motion. The\niliofemoral surgical approach was found to\nbe highly correlated with ectopic bone for-\nmation.25 Whether prophylactic indometh-\nacin prevents heterotopic ossification is still\ndebated.26\u00ad28 In the present study, prophy-\nlactic indomethacin was not used for all\npatients. The incidence of heterotopic\nossification was 27.1% without severe het-\nerotopic ossification that impaired hip\nfunction.\nThe present study has some limitations.\nThe first is the relatively small sample size of\neach group. The study included only one\npatient with avascular necrosis of the fem-\noral head and two with traumatic arthritis;\ntherefore, valuable statistical results were\ndifficult to obtain. We plan to enlarge the\nsample size in future research. Second, little\nconsideration was given to the effects of the\nnumber, configuration, displacement, and\ndistribution of fracture fragments; multi-\nfragmentary fracture pattern; marginal\nimpaction; intra-articular fragments; and\nextension of the fracture into the weight-\nbearing dome, all of which may affect the\nstability of the weight-bearing area and the\nclinical outcome.\nIn conclusion, a higher AFI is associated\nwith a better functional outcome score.\nOther factors, including reduction quality,\nphysical therapy duration, association with\na lower limb fracture, and avascular necrosis\nof the femoral head, are also likely to affect\nhip functional recovery.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the China\nand Precision Instruments of Central South\nProvincial Innovation Foundation for\nReferences\n1.
