The\nobserved stability in the overall gender earnings gap between 1988 and 1995 is shown to\nresult from a complex set of evolutions across enterprises, earnings distributions, and\ntime. Our results highlight the interplay of opposing forces, with economic reforms con-\ntributing to changes in managers'behaviors in different dimensions. On the one hand, by\nbringing more competition, liberalization favored a reduction in discriminating behaviors\nin both urban collectives and foreign-invested enterprises; on the other hand, by relaxing\ninstitutional rules, it led to a loosening of the government's egalitarian wage-setting\npolicies, leaving more space for discrimination in state-owned enterprises.\nKeywords: Gender earnings differentials; Discrimination; Enterprise ownership;\nUrban China\nThe Chinese urban labor market has experienced tremendous structural changes\nsince 1978, which have been widely documented over the last 10 years. The\nexpected impact of these changes on the male/female earnings gap, however,\nremains ambiguous. Indeed, from a theoretical point of view, as stressed by Liu,\nMeng, and Zhang (2000), opposing forces may be at work. On the one side, the\nMaoist egalitarian ideology aimed at reducing any type of discrimination: relaxing\nthe power of the State on wage-setting mechanisms may thus have brought back to the\nsurface some patriarchal Confucian forces, leading to an increase in the male/female\nwage gap. On the other hand, increased competition induced by the reforms may\nThe authors are grateful to Li Shi for providing access to the household income survey data used in the\npaper, as well as to two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

As a source of inefficiency, discrimination\nmechanisms may thus have decreased.\nFrom an empirical point of view, evidence of the impact of labor market reforms\non the male/female wage gap in urban China is also unclear. Relatively few studies\nhave addressed the issue and findings are very different.1 Liu, Meng, and Zhang\n(2000) find larger gender wage differentials in the private sector than in both the state\nand the collective sectors in two coastal cities (Jinan and Shanghai) in 1995. How-\never, they show that the relative share of discrimination in the overall gender wage\ngap substantially reduces across ownership from the State to the private sector. Their\ninterpretation is that market competition has actually lessened the importance of\ndiscrimination in total wage differentials. Using 1991 data collected in 26 cities and\n12 provinces, Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002) also find that the size of the\nmale/female wage gap tends to increase with the degree of market liberalization.\nHowever, when taking into account differences in the wage structure, they show that\nmuch of the larger gender wage gaps in the most liberalized sectors (joint venture\nand collective) can be explained by a greater degree of wage dispersion. They con-\nclude that their analysis provides \"no empirical support to the hypothesis of reform-\ninduced increases in labor market discrimination against women\" (p. 728).2 Using\ndata on Beijing and Guangdong in 1993, Qian (1996) finds different patterns, the\ngender wage gap being the largest in the collective sector (14%) and the smallest in\nthe foreign sector (1%). Although not decomposing by ownership, Qian finds that\nlabor-market discrimination is responsible for more than half of the observed overall\ngender wage gap in both Beijing and Guangdong. On the same data set as the one\nused in this paper, Gustafsson and Li (2000) show that, although the male/female\nwage gap still remains at a low level in urban China as compared to international\nstandards, it has been slightly increasing over the 1988\u00ad95 period. Like Maurer-Fazio\nand Hughes (2002), they show that this modest increase in earnings differential is\ndriven by increased income inequality in urban China rather than by a deterioration\nof the relative position of women in the earnings distribution. Using the same data\nset, Bishop, Luo, and Wang (2005) employ quantile regressions to examine returns\nto human capital characteristics at various quantiles in the earnings distribution.\nThey find that while the earnings gap has increased, the unexplained fraction of the\ngap has declined over time, especially at the bottom of the income distribution.\n1 We restrict it here to analyses on urban gender wage gaps only, although a large amount of literature\nalso deals with gender wage differentials in rural China. See Dong et al. (2004), Ho et al. (2002),\n2 Using the same database, Hughes and Maurer-Fazio (2002) explore gender wage gaps for both\nmarried and unmarried workers. They highlight less discrimination against single women in the\nmost liberalized sector (joint ventures), but the reverse for married women, for whom the\nunexplained wage differential is the highest.\ndiscrimination in urban china 99\n \nslight increase in gender wage gaps over time, explained by the conjunction of\nincreasing rewards for observed and unobserved skills (inducing increased discrim-\nination) and converging skill levels between men and women. Using the same\nagainst women in urban China is higher in the most liberalized part of China (the\ncoastal region) and that this pattern becomes more pronounced over time.\nPrevious studies have followed two types of approach to address the gender wage\ngap issue in urban China. The first approach consists of comparing different owner-\nship enterprises characterized by different levels of exposure to market forces (Qian\nMaurer-Fazio 2002). The second approach consists of the comparison of discrimi-\nnation levels observed at two or more points in time (Gustafsson and Li 2000; Liu,\nbeing complementary, our paper tries to address jointly the question of the differ-\nences in the male/female earnings gap across ownership sectors and over time. On\nthe same data set, Gustafsson and Li (2000) have provided the baseline for the analysis\nof the effects of economic reforms on the relative economic status of women. Our\npaper adds to their analysis by including a subdivision of the sample by ownership,\nwhich allows for further analyses of the impact of labor market liberalization on the\ngender earnings gap. Moreover, our decompositions run from microsimulation at the\nindividual level, allowing us to analyze the discrimination issue along the income\ndistribution and to highlight nonuniform patterns in the evolution of discrimination.\nChina's transition towards a market economy has gradually promoted the develop-\nment of the non-state sector, composed of collective enterprises, private or individual\nenterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs). The different ownership\ncorresponds to different degrees of openness to market forces, leading to a strongly\nD\u00e9murger, and Fournier 2005). Comparing discrimination levels between enter-\nprises of different ownership and their evolution thus provides valuable information\non the specific impact of reforms increasing market competition.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the methodology. Section\nIII presents the data and provides descriptive statistics on gender wage differentials\nby ownership and over time. Section IV discusses earnings functions estimations\nand Section V presents decomposition results for the male/female earnings gap\nacross ownership sectors and over time. Section VI offers concluding remarks.\nIn order to analyze male/female earnings gaps for different ownership enter-\n \nthree dimensions: gender, enterprise ownership, and time. These decompositions\nprovide evaluations of the magnitude and the evolution of discrimination\nphenomena.\nA. Modeling Total Earnings\nLet represent earnings for individual i belonging to gender s observed at date t.\ndepends on two sets of arguments: individual characteristics ( ) and a set of\nparameters corresponding to the earnings model linking individual characteristics\nwith observed earnings ( ). The wage-generating process can thus be expressed as\na function, W, of these two sets of arguments:\nB. Dynamic Decomposition\nUsing this general specification, decompositions can be applied in different\ndimensions. For the sake of simplicity, the gender earnings gap is represented here\nas the difference between average male earnings and average female earnings.3 First,\nthe observed evolution of the gender earnings gap between two dates (t and T) can\nbe decomposed as follows:4\nand\n3 In the application that follows, male/female earnings gaps are measured as the difference between\naverage male earnings and average female earnings as a percentage of average female earnings.\n4 The following procedure is very much in the line of extensions of Oaxaca\u00adBlinder decompositions\nto the time dimension initiated by Blau and Beller (1988), Smith and Welch (1989), and Wellington\n(1993). We chose this approach over the one initiated by Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) because\nour empirical findings show significant differences between men's and women's models concerning\nreturns to observed characteristics, which violates the core (implicit) assumption underlying the\nprocedure proposed by Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) (see Datta Gupta, Oaxaca, and Smith\n5 W(ix; ) refers here to the average of W(ix; ) over all relevant individuals, i.\ni\ns\nt\nw\ni\ns\nt\nw i\ns\nt\nx\n\ns\nt\ni\ns\nt i\ns\nt\ns\nt\nw W x\n( ; ).\n= \n\n \nt\nT T t\nm\nT\nf\nT\nm\nt\nf\nt\nt\nT\nt\nT\nD E,\n= -\n= -\n[ ]- -\n[ ]\n= +\nw w w w\n\nt\nT i\nm\nT\nm\nT i\nf\nT\nf\nT\nObserved wage gap in T\ni\nm\nT\nm\nt i\nf\nT\nf\nt\nSimulated wage gap\nfor population observed in T\nwith remunerations observed in t\nD x x x x\n[ ( ; ) ( ; )] [ ( ; ) ( ; )]\n= - - -\n   \n,\ndiscrimination in urban china 101\n \nThe procedure proposed in equations (3) and (4) allows for a decomposition of\nthe observed change in the earnings gap into:\n1. A pure effect of changes in discrimination, keeping population structures fixed\n(that of date T in equation 3).\n2. A pure effect of changes in characteristics, keeping remuneration structures fixed\n(that of date t in equation 4).\nC. Static Decompositions by Gender\nThe same type of decomposition procedure can be applied to the gender earnings\ngap for any given year, t, as follows:\nwhere\nand\nIn the same line as for dynamic decomposition, this decomposition corresponds\nto the evaluation of what would be the observed male/female earnings gap for year t\nunder the following conditions:\n1. If men and women were sharing the same socio-demographic characteristics\n(that of men in equation 6) D: pure discrimination effect.\n2. If men and women were facing the same remuneration structure (that of women\nin equation 7) E: pure difference-in-characteristics effect.\nD. Implementation Issues\nThe practical implementation of the method consists of two phases. Earnings\nequations are estimated by year, sex, and ownership. Estimated coefficients are then\nused to run micro-simulations and evaluate average values for each of the effects\npresented in subsections B and C.\nA general issue concerning decompositions of the Oaxaca\u00adBlinder type concerns path\ndependency (Fournier 2005). Indeed, evaluated effects a priori depend on the bench-\nmark population structure or coefficient vector chosen to run micro-simulations.

Doing so brings in\nan additional dimension when comparing the results obtained for the total to the\nresults derived for different ownership: differences in the distribution of males\nand females across different ownership enterprises. Analyzing thoroughly this\nissue would require formal modeling and simulation of enterprise-type choices by\nsex.7 This, however, goes far beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on\nearnings discrimination within enterprise types. We chose here to stick to simple\nre-weighting procedures to provide a preliminary assessment of the magnitude of\nthese phenomena.\nA. Data Sources\nThe data used in this paper come from two comparable urban household income\nGustafsson and Li (2000), who include owners and employees of private and indi-\nvidual enterprises, we chose to restrict our analysis to wageworkers aged between\n16 and 60 years, who declared working at least part of the year. Due to the lack\nof reliable information on wages for private or individual enterprises, we further\nrestricted our sample to four categories of enterprise ownership: state-owned\nenterprises at central or provincial level (CSOEs), local public-owned enterprises\n(LSOEs), urban collective enterprises (UCEs), and FIEs.10 Enterprise ownership\n6 For static decompositions, each effect can be evaluated in four different ways depending on the\nchoice of reference populations and coefficient vectors. For dynamic decompositions, two different\nevaluations can be derived depending on the choice of reference years for population and coefficient\nvectors.\n7 This issue has been addressed by Meng and Miller (1995) for rural China.\n9 Sichuan province has been added in the 1995 survey. All other provinces are the same in both years:\nBeijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu,Anhui, Henan, Guangdong,Yunnan, Gansu, and Hubei. For data\ncomparability, we restrict our analysis to the 10 provinces surveyed in the two years (see Gustafsson\n10 Foreign-invested enterprises include both Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-owned enterprises.\ndiscrimination in urban china 103\n \ncan be used as a proxy for the advancement of market liberalization, state-owned\nenterprises being the less-liberalized and FIEs the most liberalized, whatever the\nyear. Following Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002, p. 719), we can also \"speculate\nthat the collective firms are intermediate cases since their budget constraints are\nclearly firmer than those in the state sector.\"\nThe total annual earnings variable is defined as the sum of the basic wage,\nbonuses, allowances (except those received for \"waiting for a job,\" xiagang), sub-\nsidies (including housing, health care, child care, and regional subsidies), other wages,\nother income from the work unit, as well as income in kind.11 Moreover, to account\nfor regional price variations, earnings are adjusted for provincial purchasing power\ndifferences, by using Brandt and Holz's (2006) urban provincial-level spatial price\ndeflators (the reference being nationwide prices in 1995).\nB. Gender Differences in Earnings\nTable 1 presents preliminary statistics on average salaries by ownership and by\nsex, which provides an evaluation of the evolution of the gender earnings gap\nmore than women, the gap slightly narrowing over time from 18.7% in 1988 to\nextent for CSOEs and for UCEs, and it has remained stable for LSOEs (from 15.2%\nto 15.3%). These nonuniform changes across ownership lead to quite different\nthe gap is by far the largest in FIEs, yet it is the smallest in 1995. In 1995, the highest\ndifferential is observed in UCEs, followed by LSOEs and CSOEs. Hence, the overall\nmodest change in the male/female earnings gap between 1988 and 1995 results from\nthe combination of sizable contrasting evolutions within different ownership struc-\nthese results differ strongly from both Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) and Maurer-\nFazio and Hughes (2002), who highlight larger gender wage gaps in the most liber-\nalized sectors. One explanation can be found in the different samples used in these\nstudies. Indeed, Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) only consider two cities. Moreover,\nour finding of a large decrease in the gender earnings gap for FIEs between 1988 and\n1995 stresses the fact that various years can exhibit quite different pictures. Hence,\nMaurer-Fazio and Hughes' (2002) findings for 1991 can be seen as consistent with\n11 As some people declare working only for part of the year, wages are adjusted to \"full-year working\nequivalent.\"\n12 This result differs from Gustafsson and Li (2000), who found a modest increase in the gender wage\ngap (from 18.5% to 21.2%). Two main reasons can explain this difference: first, our sample is\nrestricted to wage workers only and excludes private and individual enterprises, and second, we have\nadjusted earnings for unemployed days.\n \nAll Workers CSOEs LSOEs UCEs FIEs\nWomen Men Women Men Women Men Women Men Women Men\nSource: Authors' calculation based on the 1988 and the 1995 China Household Income Project survey data.\nThe sample includes individuals aged 16\u00ad60 years who declared working at least a part of the year and earning (positive) wages. Owners\nand employees of private or individual enterprises are excluded.\nThe earnings variable is defined as being the sum of the basic wage, bonuses, allowances and subsidies, other wages, other income from the\nwork unit, and income in kind.\n\u00a7The gender earnings gap is computed as the difference between men's earnings and women's earnings, as a percentage of women's earnings.\nCSOEs = state-owned enterprises at central or provincial level; LSOEs = local public-owned enterprises; UCEs = urban collective\nenterprises; FIEs = foreign-invested enterprises.\ndiscrimination in urban china 105\n \nour results, with a male/female wage differential for FIEs of 25.4%,13 which lies\nFurthermore, Table 1 shows that the overall differential across the range of enter-\nprises in 1995 is noticeably higher than differentials by ownership taken separately\n(except for UCEs), which suggests that an important aspect of discrimination\nagainst women arises from their being over-represented in enterprises paying lower\nwages (UCEs), whereas men are proportionately more numerous in higher-paying\nenterprises.14 This observation is consistent with Maurer-Fazio, Rawski, and\nZhang's (1999) findings at the aggregate level, indicating that a \"large portion of the\ngender wage differences in China's urban labor market arises because of the over-\nrepresentation of women in low-wage industries\" (p. 81). This issue can be further\nanalyzed through reweighting procedures, as shown in Table 2. The use of a\ncommon distribution by ownership (either that observed for men or that observed for\nwomen) enables the monitoring of the impact of differences in distributions by owner-\nship between the two sexes. Our findings show that the proportion of the observed\nearnings gap that can be directly attributed to differences in the distribution of men\nand women across enterprises amounts to 3\u00ad4 percentage points. This indirect dis-\ncrimination arises from the fact that women are over-represented in low-wage\nUCEs, whereas men are over-represented in higher-paying CSOEs.\nThe bottom part of Table 2 provides additional and complementary information\non the impact of differences in the male and female distributions across enterprises\non the gender earnings gap. Reweighting by the distribution observed for the other\nyear shows that half of the 0.9 percentage point decrease in the gender earnings gap\nbetween 1988 and 1995 that is observed can be attributed to changes in the relative\nemployment between enterprises, which have been in favor of LSOEs for both men\nworkers and 56.2% of male workers, while the shares in 1988 were respectively\n38.6% and 42.2%. This concentration in LSOEs tends to homogenize the distribu-\ntion of men and women across enterprises, which in turn reduces the importance of\nownership segregation in the gender earnings differential.\nAnother important aspect concerns the earnings distribution by sex within owner-\nship. Gini coefficients provided in Table 1 show some interesting features. First, in\n1988, earnings inequality for both men and women was notably higher in FIEs,\nbetween the average male wage and the average female wage as a percentage of the average female\nwage.\n14 The over-representation of women in low-paying collective enterprises is a well-documented\nphenomenon of the Chinese labor market. As emphasized by Qian (1996, p. 79), it is \"partially a\nresult of the Chinese government effort to mobilize women to participate in the labor market.\"\nHowever, since the collective sector offers \"lower wages, less benefits, and limited career\ndevelopment, people consider it a less desirable sector.\"\n \nwhere salaries were also by far the highest. Thus, earnings dispersion was the\nhighest in the most liberalized sector in 1988, which is consistent with Maurer-Fazio\nand Hughes'(2002) findings for 1991. On the opposite side, earnings inequality was\nthe lowest in LSOEs, where Gini coefficients were only 18.4% for women and 19.5%\noverall earnings inequality for both men (from 21.1% to 26.2%) and women (from\n21.5% to 27.5%). Moreover, this increase has been especially sharp in both LSOEs\nand UCEs. In terms of changes in earnings inequality over time, FIEs exhibit levels\nof inequality quite similar to UCEs and LSOEs in 1995, since Gini coefficients only\nslightly increased in FIEs. Hence, further liberalization of the economy between\n1988 and 1995 led to higher earnings inequality within domestic enterprises and a\ncatching-up process, as compared to FIEs.\nTo further analyze the distribution issue, Figure 1 presents male/female observed\nearnings differentials by earnings percentile of each gender income distribution for\neach ownership type. Each curve should be read in terms of difference: for the\nmedian, the curve represents the difference between male median and female\nDifferences in the Gender Distribution by Ownership and Gender Earnings Gaps\nVariable\nWomen Men Women Men\nObserved evolution of earnings differential (percentage points) -0.9\nReweighting by the opposite sex distribution\nCounterfactual men/women earnings gap\nFemale distribution by ownership applied to men (%) 16.1 14.1\nMale distribution by ownership applied to women (%) 15.8 15.4\nDifference between observed and counterfactual gaps in percentage points\nFemale distribution by ownership applied to men 2.7 3.8\nMale distribution by ownership applied to women 2.9 2.5\nReweighting by the distribution observed for the other year\nCounterfactual evolution of earnings differential in percentage points\nSource: Authors' calculation based on the 1988 and the 1995 China Household Income\nProject survey data.\nThe gender earnings gap is computed as the difference between men's earnings and women's\nearnings, as a percentage of women's earnings.\ndiscrimination in urban china 107\n \nmedian earnings as a percentage of the female median earnings. The overall distri-\nbution shows sizable changes between 1988 and 1995. Indeed, the rather flat curve\nin 1988 turns into a down-sloping curve in 1995, stressing a higher gender differen-\ntial at the bottom of the earnings scale. Hence, the overall gender earnings gap has\nincreased for low-wage earners, while it has decreased for high-wage earners.\nMoreover, this relative deterioration of the earnings gap at the lower part of the\ndistribution can be found within each enterprise type, except for LSOEs, where the\nevolution is less clear-cut.\nEarnings regressions by enterprise ownership and by sex are reported in Table 3\nexpected remuneration are closely linked, estimating earnings functions for\nenterprises of different ownership would require controlling for potential selection\nbiases.

On the one hand,\nthe choice of explanatory variables for the earnings equation may raise a concern for\nthe concept of wage discrimination, which commonly refers to the part of the un-\nexplained earnings gap between men and women. Because income variations across\nregions or industries are potential important sources of gender earnings differentials,\nmore disaggregated levels for geographic and industrial attributes may be required.\nSimilarly, the potentially different distribution of men and women across positions\nand occupations in the same enterprise may also account for the identified \"gender\ndiscrimination.\" However, some of these explanatory variables, including industry\nand occupation, are clearly endogenous, with no variable in our data to credibly\ninstrument those endogenous variables. Hence, given data limitation, we chose to\nlimit the potential for endogeneity bias by estimating a reduced form of the earnings\nequation, which does not include all the theoretically required explanatory variables.\nWe thus acknowledge that one should keep the potential omitted variable bias in\nmind when interpreting the results. However, alternate specifications, including\nextended specifications as well as a minimal specification including only human\ncapital variables (education and experience) have been estimated and all led to similar\ndecomposition results.21\n17 In particular, until 1995, graduate students from universities in China were assigned to a particular\njob according to central planning\u00adrelated labor allocation mechanisms.\n18 Chen, D\u00e9murger, and Fournier (2005) mention the relative employment shares in different enterprise\ntypes at the city level as potential instruments. Information on cities is unfortunately not fully\n19 Reference categories for the regional location and economic sector are the non-coastal region and\nsecondary sector (industry and construction), respectively.\n20 More detailed specifications for male and female earnings functions can be found in Gustafsson and\nLi (2000), who, however, do not provide any distinction by ownership type.\n21 All results presented in the rest of the paper are based on an intermediate specification. Robustness\ntests using alternative (reduced or extended) specifications are available from the authors.\ndiscrimination in urban china 111\n \nAnother concern about the accuracy of our estimates can arise from the very small\nnumber of observations for the foreign sector. Since it was still in its emerging phase\nin 1995, the foreign sector was indeed accounting for a very small share of employ-\nment in China. Being aware of this strong weakness of the data, we nevertheless\nchose to keep this category in our analysis as a reference category for the most\nEarnings equation regressions reported in Table 3 and Table 4 show22 returns to\nand ranging from 2.9% to 9.9% in 1995.

The estimation of separate earnings functions\nby ownership shows that the remuneration of experience is not uniform across own-\nership and gender. Women tend to have steeper but more concave returns to experi-\nence than men, thus reaching their wage peak earlier. For women, experience is\nsignificantly better rewarded in CSOEs than in LSOEs in 1988, and women's wage\npremium for job experience in CSOEs is significantly higher than for men. For men,\nexperience is more uniformly remunerated across ownership. Lastly, the absence of\nsignificant returns to experience in FIEs certainly comes from the fact that workers\nin FIEs are much younger and have less experience. It also highlights a specificity\nof this newly developed form of ownership, in which experience accumulated in\nformer state-owned enterprise positions may not be associated with efficiency gains.\nEarnings differentials by geographical location in domestic enterprises show that\nworkers in coastal provinces earn on average 2\u00ad14% more than workers in inland\nwage premium for being along the coast in 1988 was significantly lower in LSOEs\nthan in both CSOEs and UCEs for men and women. But, the strong increase in the\npremium for LSOEs in 1995 led to a reversal of the relative position of LSOEs com-\npared to CSOEs, which became the lowest coastal wage premium-paying enterprise.\n22 Comparisons of estimated coefficients across equations given in the following comments are made\nonly for differences that are statistically significant at the 10% level.\n23 Experience is measured here as potential work experience calculated from age and the number of\nyears of schooling.\n \nTable 5 provides evaluations of the impact of changes in both discrimination and\nownership. First, as discussed in Section III, it shows that the income gap between\nmen and women has decreased as a whole and for all ownerships, except for LSOEs,\nover the 1988\u00ad95 period. However, the decomposition of the modest observed\ndecrease in the earnings gap reveals two opposite forces. First, the overall change in\nendowments has led to a relative improvement for women as compared to men. If\nalone, this change would have led to a much larger decrease in the overall gender\nwage gap (5.1\u00ad5.5 percentage points instead of the observed 0.9 percentage point).\nHowever, this equalizing force has been offset by a concomitant increase in dis-\ncrimination, which would have led to a 4.1\u00ad4.6 percentage points' increase in the\noverall gender earnings gap, had endowments remained unchanged.\nFigure 2 presents decomposition results on the earnings percentiles scale. It\nshows that changes in endowments have had a rather uniform impact along the\nFig. 2.

This implies that the relative widening of the gender earnings gap\nfor low-wage earners as compared to high-wage earners mainly comes from a\nstronger increase in discrimination for low-wage workers. This result is consistent\nwith Gustafsson and Li's (2000) findings that the earnings situation of young women\nand women with limited education (thus, at the lower end of the female earnings\ndistribution) has especially deteriorated compared to men with similar characteristics.\nIt is also consistent with Bishop, Luo, and Wang's (2005) findings using quantile\nregressions\u00adbased decomposition procedures.24\nTurning to differences by ownership, Table 5 reveals quite different patterns\nacross enterprises, especially in terms of discrimination. Indeed, it shows an increase\nin discrimination for both central and local state-owned enterprises (especially high\nin LSOEs) and a decrease for UCEs.25 For CSOEs, the convergence in income\nbetween men and women thus entirely comes from a catching-up in terms of endow-\nments, which may have been partly compensated by an increase in discrimination.\nIn the case of LSOEs, the catching-up in terms of endowments is fully compen-\nsated by a strong rise in discrimination (between 5.5 and 5.7 percentage points),\nwhich more strongly affected both the bottom and the top of the distribution\n(Figure 2). An opposite feature characterizes UCEs since they experienced a\ndecrease in discrimination associated with diverging endowments. As shown in\nFigure 2, the overall decrease in discrimination only affected the upper part of the\ndistribution, while among the poorest, discrimination seems to have increased.\nThese results reveal an interesting evolution in domestic enterprises' behaviors\nthroughout the reform period. Indeed, enterprises that experienced the greatest\nincrease in discrimination against women are state-owned enterprises, not UCEs,\nwhere discrimination substantially decreased. As for the comparison of discrimina-\ntory behaviors between state-owned enterprises and others, Meng and Miller (1995)\nargue that where employment and wages are decided by the government, the gov-\nernment makes efforts to improve the position of women in order to counterbalance\ntraditional segregation against women inherited from Confucian thoughts. Our\nresults suggest that throughout the reform process, the government, and especially\nlocal governments, have tended to pay less attention to this issue and have progres-\nsively decreased their pressure on gender equality. Conversely, our results for UCEs\nsuggest that within these enterprises, market reforms and increased competition\n24 Although Bishop et al. focus their comments on the decreasing share of the \"unexplained\"\ncomponent in the total gap, their results show a clear increase in the level of this component over\n25 For FIEs, the impact is less straightforward, as suggested by the negative and positive signs of the\nminimum and maximum interval.

For instance, the rising discrimination found in the State sector may also\nreflect the fact that earnings in state-owned enterprises are becoming more related to the unobserved\nskills of individual workers and less to their observable attributes, such as education attainment or\nseniority over time. Similarly, the declining weight of the residual wage gap observed in the UCEs\ncould also be attributed to more individualistic initial wage structures.\nStatic Decomposition of Gender Earnings Differentials by Ownership, 1988\nOwnership\nCategory\nObserved\nAverage\nEarnings Differential\nDecomposition of the Observed\nEarnings Differential\nEndowments Discrimination\nMen Women Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum\nNote: Decompositions based on regressions results are presented in Table 3.\nCSOEs = state-owned enterprises at central or provincial level; LSOEs = local public-owned\nenterprises; UCEs = urban collective enterprises; FIEs = foreign-invested enterprises.\n \ndiscrimination. Thus, the shares of both components remained approximately\nconstant over time, discrimination against women explaining around two-thirds of\nthe total observed gender earnings differentials in urban China. This implies that\nin the absence of discrimination, the gender earnings differential would have been\nAs for ownership categories, Tables 6 and 7 also show substantial differences in\nthe proportion of observed differentials arising from direct discrimination against\nwomen. Indeed, in 1988, discrimination was particularly high in CSOEs and in\nUCEs, where it explained most of the observed gender wage gap, while in LSOEs,\ndiscrimination phenomena explained between 55 and 63% of the observed gap.\nHowever, throughout the period, the most substantial change arose within LSOEs,\nwhere discrimination sharply increased and explains most of the observed gender\nwage differentials in 1995. These results confirm that market liberalization has had\na very different impact on discrimination against women across the different types\nof domestic enterprises.\nTurning to FIEs, our decompositions results highlight quite different features.\nSince the number of observations is much smaller for these enterprises, especially\nin 1988, we will limit interpretations to the year 1995 only. For this particular year,\nour decompositions do not support the hypothesis of discrimination against women\nStatic Decomposition of Gender Earnings Differentials by Ownership, 1995\nOwnership\nCategory\nObserved\nAverage\nEarnings Differential\nDecomposition of the Observed\nEarnings Differential\nEndowments Discrimination\nMen Women Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum\nNote: Decompositions based on regressions results are presented in Table 4.\nCSOEs = state-owned enterprises at central or provincial level; LSOEs = local public-owned\nenterprises; UCEs = urban collective enterprises; FIEs = foreign-invested enterprises.\ndiscrimination in urban china 117\n \nin FIEs and even suggest some possible discrimination against men.27 Hence, in\n1995, the most market-oriented enterprises were also those in which discrimination\nagainst women was the lowest. As discussed for UCEs, this suggests that market\nforces have helped reduce the gap between men and women by improving incentives\nfor enterprises to adopt rational behaviors. Our results for 1995 thus show a clear\nopposition between domestic enterprises and FIEs. In the former, we find a marked\ndiscrimination against women, which, combined with differences in average charac-\nteristics, causes a large overall pay differential between men and women. In the\nlatter, the gender earnings differential is mainly due to differences in characteristics\nand discrimination phenomena play no significant role. A higher level of discrimi-\nnation in domestic enterprises than in FIEs supports the hypothesis that the search\nfor efficiency in FIES, which are more subject to market mechanisms, tends to\nencourage flexibility and lower discrimination.\nEconomic reforms and market liberalization in urban China from the mid-1980s\nonwards have greatly affected gender wage differentials and discrimination against\nwomen. As emphasized in this paper, the resulting changes are made up of a com-\nplex set of evolutions across enterprises, earnings distributions, and time, which call\nfor a careful analysis. Our approach combines the time dimension to the ownership\ndimension, adding new, valuable information to the understanding of the role played\nby the reforms in gender wage gaps changes.\nFirst, we find that the overall gender wage gap has been slightly narrowing over\nfrom contrasting evolutions across different ownership structures, with a decreasing\ndifferential observed for FIEs, CSOEs, and UCEs, and an increasing differential for\nLSOEs. Second, wage dispersion is found to be the highest in the most liberalized\nto a rise in wage inequality within domestic enterprises, resulting in a catching-up\nof FIEs. Third, we find that while the overall gender earnings gap has remained\ngrossly stable, it has increased for the lower deciles of the wage distribution and\ndecreased for high-wage earners.\nAs for discrimination against women, we first show that part of the observed wage\ndifferential arises from women being over-represented in enterprises paying lower\nwages, whereas men are proportionately more numerous in high-paying enterprises.\nThe segmentation of the labor market and differences in the distribution of men and\n27 Similar results have been found by Maurer-Fazio and Hughes (2002), who show that in\ncompetitively obtained jobs, gender wage gaps are much reduced and discrimination against women\nis negligible.\n \nwomen across enterprises lead to a first form of discrimination against women: the\nproportion of the observed earnings gap that may be directly attributed to these\ndifferences amounts to 3\u00ad4 percentage points. Moreover, in dynamic terms, half\nof the 0.9 percentage point decrease observed in the gender earnings gap between\nacross enterprises.\nDecomposing gender earnings differentials into endowment differences and dis-\ncrimination phenomena allows for further exploration of the discrimination issue.\nFirst, our results indicate that in 1988, discrimination was quite strong in domestic\nenterprises and mainly affected the top deciles of the female earnings distribution.\nHence, at the beginning of the industrial reforms, discrimination against women was\nmost prominent in qualified occupations, whereas it was much lower for low-paying\njobs. This implies that at the end of the 1980s, the government's control over wage-\nsetting aiming at gender equality was better enforced for lower wages than for the\nhighest-paying jobs. Second, economic reforms brought about some significant\nchanges to discriminatory behaviors, which have affected differently the various\nsegments of the urban labor market. Our results highlight a rise in discrimination in\nstate-owned enterprises, concentrated at the bottom of the earnings distribution.\nThese changes can be considered as reflecting a \"catching-up\" of discrimination\nalong the female earnings distribution since the discrimination pattern in 1995 is\nquite flat across income deciles. Conversely, UCEs experienced decreasing discri-\nmination, affecting the top of the distribution and leading to an equalization of\ndiscrimination on the income scale. Lastly, our results do not support the hypothesis\nof discrimination against women for FIEs in 1995 and even seem to suggest the\npossibility of discrimination against men. In distributive terms, they indicate that\ndiscriminatory behaviors are restricted to low-wage female earners.\nMarket liberalization thus appears to have affected quite differently enterprises of\ndifferent ownership. On the one hand, our results suggest that the Chinese State has\npaid less attention to the gender equality issue over time, while on the other hand,\nmarket competition seems to have helped reduce discriminatory behaviors. More-\nover, our findings stress quite unequal changes across the range of earnings distribu-\nhigher deciles of the earnings distribution, the trend has been either annulated or\nreversed by 1995. The richest women have thus seen their relative position improv-\ning while the poorest have seen their relative position deteriorating.28\nConsistent with Liu, Meng, and Zhang (2000) and Maurer-Fazio and Hughes\n(2002), our results highlight the interplay of opposing forces, economic reforms\ncontributing to changes in entrepreneurs' (or managers') behaviors in various\n28 Relative improvement or deterioration here are to be understood in terms of a difference in\ndifferences: women's earnings relative to men's earnings at different positions on the income scale.\ndiscrimination in urban china 119\n \ndimensions. First, the decentralization process led to a growing importance of\ndecentralized choices in wage-setting decisions, leaving space for managers' pre-\nferences and potentially unequal treatment of women. Thus, moving from the com-\nmunist egalitarian ideology to a decentralized system of wage determination seems\nto have led to an increase in discrimination in LSOEs, and to a lesser extent, in\nCSOEs. Our results also suggest that discriminatory behaviors against women have\nincreased the most at the bottom of the earnings distribution, which was still most\nprotected in 1988, thus leading to a more equal distribution of discrimination along\nthe wage scale. Second, economic reforms not only brought about decentralization\nbut also market competition, which is expected to favor more efficient behaviors in\nterms of wage-setting. Discrimination being a source of inefficiency, further liber-\nalization may tend to reduce discriminatory behaviors, which is what our results\nsuggest for UCEs over time and, to some extent, in 1995 for the comparison of FIEs\nand domestic enterprises.\nDifferent forces are thus at work to explain changes in gender discrimination,\nwhich are related to differences in the institutional structure of the various types of\nenterprises. On the one hand, by relaxing institutional rules, market liberalization\nweakened both the central and local governments' equalizing role on wage-setting\nrules, leaving space for discrimination to arise in state-owned enterprises. Our\nresults suggest that this is especially true for LSOEs, which have experienced a large\nincrease in discrimination. Being of a smaller size and farther from the direct control\nof the central government, these enterprises enjoyed a greater discretion in wage\ndetermination although still protected from competition and benefiting from soft\nbudget constraints. On the other hand, increased competition induced by the\ndevelopment of market mechanisms actually favored the reduction of discriminating\nbehaviors in enterprises outside the State planning structure, as highlighted here for\nboth UCEs and FIEs. These concomitant and opposite evolutions can explain why,\nat the aggregate level, changes are so modest. They also confirm results from Liu,\nof assessing the role of economic reforms on the relative position of women in urban\nChina.\nREFERENCES\nBishop, John A.; Feijun Luo; and Fang Wang. 2005. \"Economic Transition, Gender Bias, and\nthe Distribution of Earnings in China.\" Economics of Transition 13, no. 2: 239\u00ad59.\nBlau, Francine D., and Andrea H.
