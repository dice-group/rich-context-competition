Garabrant, University of Michigan\nSchool of Public Health, 109 S. Observatory Street, Ann Arbor, MI\nAllergic reactions to natural rubber latex are a concern in\nthe health care industry. Among health care workers, the\nprevalence of latex sensitization has been estimated at 3\u00ad22\npercent (1\u00ad12), depending on the population studied, the\ndefinition of sensitization used, and the selection criteria for\ninclusion of subjects in the study. Among the general popu-\nlation, the prevalence has been estimated at 6\u00ad12 percent\n(13\u00ad16). However, in spite of the numerous studies that\nhave examined either the seroprevalence of latex-specific\nimmunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies or skin prick reactivity\nto extracts from latex gloves, direct comparisons between\nhealth care workers and comparable general populations\nhave not been made. Thus, it is not established that the\nprevalence of latex sensitization is higher in health care\nworkers than in the general population. It is desirable that\nthe prevalence of latex sensitization be measured accurately\nin exposed and comparable referent groups in to identify the\nlatex products and circumstances of use that are associated\nwith sensitization.\nLatex sensitization refers to the presence of latex-specific\nIgE antibody. It is postulated that both dermal contact and\ninhalation of airborne glove powder in health care settings\nmay sensitize nonallergic individuals (17\u00ad19), which has led\nto recommendations for changes in glove use (20). Among\nsensitized individuals, reexposure to latex antigens may\nresult in IgE-mediated clinical allergies (21, 22), which\ninclude anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and\nallergic rhinitis (23).\nOur investigation examined the data collected by the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) regarding the seroprevalence of latex-\nspecific IgE antibodies in the US general population. The\npurpose of this study was to examine whether work in health\ncare jobs is associated with increased risk of latex sensitiza-\ntion and to determine whether other factors (such as glove\nuse, atopy, age, sex, and race) affect this association.\nWe used data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey, phase I, which was con-\nducted by the National Center for Health Statistics between\nobtained on a public-use CD-ROM provided by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (26). The NHANES III data,\nwhen used with sampling weights to correct for different\nsampling probabilities, noncoverage, and nonresponse, pro-\nvide estimates of the health status of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population of the United States aged 2 months\nand older (24). A 15 percent random sample of participants\naged 17\u00ad60 years was tested by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) for latex-specific IgE anti-\nbodies. Subjects were chosen for laboratory analyses with-\nout knowledge of their occupation, symptoms, latex sensiti-\nzation status, or other factors associated with latex\nsensitization.\nQuestionnaire data regarding health conditions, allergies,\nand demographic factors were obtained from the same indi-\nviduals. The variables we considered as potential explana-\ntory factors were occupation (current occupation, ever wear\nprotective equipment, ever wear protective gloves, how long\nworked at job, longest-held occupation), demographics (sex,\nrace, ethnicity, age, urban/rural residence), family history of\nallergic conditions (parental asthma or hay fever), smoking\n(ever smoked cigarettes, smoke cigarettes now, anyone in\nthe home smoke cigarettes, quit smoking because of health\nproblems), allergic conditions (ever asthma, ever bronchitis,\never hay fever, age at diagnosis of asthma, age at diagnosis\nof bronchitis, age at diagnosis of hay fever, current asthma,\ncurrent bronchitis, current hay fever), respiratory and aller-\ngic conditions (wheezing or whistling in the chest; stuffy\nnose; watery, itchy eyes; symptoms brought on by exercise;\nsymptoms brought on by animals; symptoms brought on by\nwork environment; symptoms brought on by pollen), and\nfrequency of visiting a dentist.\nThe CDC used the AlaSTAT test (Diagnostics Products\nCorporation, Los Angeles, California) to test for latex sensi-\ntivity (27). In the AlaSTAT test, 50 \u00b5l of serum is mixed with\n100 \u00b5l of latex allergen reagent. After an hour of incubation,\nan antiligand reagent is added to capture latex-specific IgE\nbound to the latex reagent. After washing, an enzyme-\nanti-IgE reagent is added to react with IgE that has bound the\nlatex allergen. After another wash, substrate is added, and\ncolor development is stopped after precisely 15 minutes by\nthe addition of sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 492 nm of\neach latex allergen test is compared with a reference curve,\nand values of latex-specific IgE are interpolated. For the\npurposes of these analyses, values below 0.35 IU/ml were\nclassified as positive, and those at and above 1.50 IU/ml\nwere classified as strongly positive. These cutpoints and\nranges are commonly regarded as differentiating between\nnegative, positive, and strongly positive, latex-specific IgE\nNHANES III contained information on the current occu-\npation, including questions about whether gloves were ever\nworn in the subject's current job. Subjects were grouped by\noccupation according to the following definitions:\n\u00b7 Health care workers were defined as subjects who\nreported their current occupation as one of the health\ndiagnosing, assessment, and treatment occupations or\nas one of the health service occupations. A total of 109\nhealth care workers reported using gloves, and 65\nreported that they did not use gloves at work.\n\u00b7 Other jobs with glove use were defined as those\ninvolving subjects who worked in occupations other\nthan health care in which latex glove use is common\nand who reported using gloves at work. These were\nfood handlers and cooks (28, 29), private household\nworkers (29), protective service workers (law enforce-\nment, ambulance attendants, and firefighters) (29),\ncleaning occupations, and nursery farmers (30).\n\u00b7 Nonhealth-care workers, nonglove users were defined\nas subjects who reported any other current occupation.\nNHANES III also contained information about the\nlongest-held occupation of each subject. This information\nwas of interest in this study because of the possibility that\nlatex-sensitized subjects might have left exposed jobs pref-\nerentially compared with nonsensitized subjects. If this were\ntrue, the longest-held occupation might be less subject to\nany differential selection bias out of health care occupations.\nSubjects were grouped according to the longest-held occu-\npation using the definitions above, except that information\non glove use was not collected in the NHANES III survey.\nBecause the NHANES III data were derived from a strati-\nfied sample of the US population, the weight assigned to each\nsubject was also used in the analyses. Of the 5,524 subjects\ntested for IgE, 12 subjects were excluded because they had\nbeen examined in their homes rather than in mobile examina-\ntion centers, leaving 5,512 subjects available for the analyses.\nInformation on glove use was missing for three subjects, leav-\ning 5,509 in the analyses by current occupation. Information\non longest-held occupation was missing for 290 subjects,\nleaving 5,222 subject in the analyses by longest occupation.\nTo assess the possibility of selection bias, we examined\nwhether the study results were influenced by different serum\nselection probabilities with respect to work in health care,\nother factors associated with latex sensitization, and demo-\ngraphic factors (age, sex, ethnicity). The prevalence of latex\nsensitization was compared between occupation groups by\nusing a contingency table. Prevalence odds ratios and 95\npercent confidence intervals were calculated by using\nweighted ordinal logistic regression in which the outcome\nvariable was latex sensitization classified as a three-level\nIU/ml), and strongly positive (1.50 IU/ml). Demographic\nvariables, allergic conditions, history of atopy, and other\nfactors were added sequentially to identify the best model\n(judged by the \u00ad2 log-likelihood ratio test). Effect modifica-\ntion was examined by the addition of interaction terms, and\nwhen odds ratio heterogeneity was detected, the strata were\nkept separate in further analyses.\nAssessing the role of atopy was an important issue, inso-\nfar as atopic conditions (e.g., asthma and hay fever) are both\nrecognized risk factors for latex sensitization and may also\nbe consequences of latex sensitization. To differentiate\nwhether atopy was antecedent to health care work or may\nhave been a consequence of health care work, we examined\nthe association between latex sensitization and health care\nwork separately for subjects who reported childhood asthma\nand hay fever (onset before age 18 years) and those who did\nnot and for those who reported the onset of asthma or hay\nfever prior to starting their current job and those who did not.\nA final model, which included occupation group, age,\nsex, race, and physician-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, was\nchosen to represent the association between each measure of\nlatex sensitization and each occupation group. This model\nwas compared with a reduced model, which excluded physi-\ncian-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, to examine whether a\nhistory of atopy altered the associations between latex sen-\nsitization and occupation. All analyses were performed\nusing SAS version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina)\n(32), which allows estimation of complex sample variances\nin the presence of stratified and clustered survey data (33).\nRESULTS\nThere were no appreciable differences (and no statisti-\ncally significant differences) between subjects whose latex-\nspecific IgE was measured and those who were excluded\nfrom the IgE analysis, in terms of sex, race/ethnicity, age,\nthe proportion who worked in health care, the proportion\nwith physician-diagnosed asthma or hay fever, or the pro-\nportion of smokers. Thus, there was no evidence of selection\nbias in the testing of subjects for latex-specific IgE.\nThe best model for each combination of latex sensitization\nand occupation group contained the same set of explanatory\nvariables (age, race, sex, and physician-diagnosed asthma or\nhay fever), and the regression coefficients for these variables\nwere relatively stable across these models. For example (table\n1), the model indicates that after controlling for all other fac-\ntors, subjects who reported that their longest job was in health\ncare were at 1.49 times higher odds of latex sensitization\n(both a positive and strongly positive IgE response vs. a neg-\native response) than were nonhealth-care workers (95 percent\nconfidence interval (CI): 0.92, 2.40). Females were at signif-\nicantly lower odds than were males (odds ratio (OR) = 0.58,\ncompared with White non-Hispanics, and older ages were at\nsignificantly reduced odds (for subjects aged 50\u00ad60 years\nasthma or hay fever were at significantly increased odds\nwithout these conditions.\nTable 2 presents the results for the occupations in two dif-\nferent models: a model containing occupation group and\ndemographic variables (sex, race, age) and a final model\ncontaining the same set of predictor variables with atopy\n(asthma or hay fever) added. Comparison of these models\nallows an assessment of whether there is any appreciable\nconfounding by atopy after controlling for sex, race, and\nage. The final model indicates that there was a weak associ-\nation between latex sensitization and the longest-held job in\nassociation between latex sensitization and work in other\njobs in which glove use is common (OR = 1.07, 95 percent\nmodel and the reduced model indicated that adjustment for\natopy did not appreciably alter any of the associations\nbetween occupations and latex sensitization.\nFor current occupations (table 2), there was no associa-\ntion between latex sensitization and health care work with\nhealth care workers who denied using gloves, there was a\nmoderate association with latex sensitization (OR = 2.53, 95\nerogeneity when these results were stratified on childhood\nTABLE 1.

There was no clear evidence of odds ratio\nheterogeneity for any of the other current or longest-held job\ngroups. Other current jobs in which latex glove use is com-\nmon were not associated with latex sensitization (OR =\nIt is possible that the lack of association between current\nhealth care work with gloves and latex sensitization is due\nin part to movement of sensitized workers out of jobs in\nwhich they would be exposed to gloves. To evaluate this\npossibility, we analyzed information on whether subjects\nhad ever changed jobs because of health problems. Current\nhealth care workers who did not use gloves were not appre-\nciably different from nonhealth-care workers with respect to\n0.96). These findings suggest that subjects had not moved to\nhealth care jobs in which gloves were not used because of\nallergies or other health problems.\nThe prevalence of latex sensitization was calculated for\neach of 39 different longest-held occupational groups (figure\n1). Figure 1 shows that health care workers were not unusual\nwith respect to other occupations when ranked by the preva-\nlence of sensitization at 0.35 to less than 1.50 IU/ml, when\nranked by the prevalence of sensitization at 1.50 IU/ml or\nmore, or when both categories were summed. Other occupa-\ntions in which latex gloves are used frequently, such as mis-\ncellaneous food workers, cooks, private household workers,\nprotective service workers (law enforcement, ambulance\nattendants, and firefighters), cleaning occupations, and nurs-\nery farmers, tended to be in the upper half of the distribution\nbut were not at clearly higher risk than other occupations.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results in table 2 suggest that there may be an associ-\nation between long-term work in health care and latex sen-\nsitization. Insofar as the information about the longest-held\njobs does not contain information about glove use, it cannot\nbe determined whether these associations are explained by\nglove use or by other factors. However, the findings for cur-\nrent jobs suggest that glove use may not be associated with\nincreased risk of sensitization either among health care\nworkers or in other jobs in which latex glove use is com-\nmon. They also indicate that work in health care jobs in\nwhich gloves are not used is moderately associated with\nlatex sensitization. The associations between occupations\nand latex sensitization were not appreciably altered by\nadjustments for asthma and hay fever. This suggests that\nthese conditions were not consequences of sensitization, but\nrather were predictors of sensitization that are independent\nof occupation (and latex exposure). However, a history of\nchildhood atopy was a strong effect modifier in current\nhealth care workers who denied glove use. Although this\nobservation suggests that people with childhood atopy may\nbe at high risk of latex sensitization, the data in our study are\ntoo small to draw any firm conclusions on this point. This\neffect was not seen in the other current or longest-held job\ngroups.\nIn the aggregate, these results provide little support for\nthe conclusion that glove use is associated with latex sensi-\ntization either in health care workers or in other jobs in\nTABLE 2.

However,\nsince the majority of subjects who are sensitized to latex are\nasymptomatic and are unaware of their antibody status (34),\nsuch persons would have little reason to change jobs more\nfrequently than those who are not sensitized. In addition,\nworkers who develop clinical allergies to latex gloves typi-\ncally switch to nonlatex gloves rather than changing jobs,\nfor which there would be an attendant loss of seniority and\njob skills. In support of this view, we found no evidence that\nhealth care workers who used gloves or those who did not\nchanged jobs because of health problems more frequently\nthan did nonhealth-care workers. It is possible, however,\nthat subjects who are sensitized and who continue to suffer\nfrom latex-related allergies in spite of attempts to reduce\ntheir exposure would preferentially move to nonexposed\njobs.\nOur findings are consistent with other published studies.\nAtopy is a strong and consistent risk factor for latex sensiti-\nbeen observed to be a risk factor for latex sensitization in a\nlarge study of nurses (5), among surgery patients (13), and\namong blood donors in the general population (15). Male\nsex is also a recognized risk factor in some (13, 15), but not\nall (14), studies. Consistent with our findings, previous stud-\nies of health care workers have not demonstrated any con-\nsistent pattern of dose response between sensitization and\nincreasing exposure to latex in gloves. Numerous studies\nhave sought, but failed to find, associations between the risk\nof latex sensitization and the following exposure metrics\n1) the duration of exposure to latex gloves or the duration of\nwork in health care (2, 12, 38); 2) the duration of latex glove\nuse (2); 3) the frequency of glove use (9); 4) the number of\nhours worked in health care jobs (2); and 5) work in operat-\ning rooms and settings with frequent glove use versus work\nin areas with infrequent glove use (5). One study found an\nassociation between the prevalence of latex sensitivity and\nthe number of surgical gloves used, but did not find any\nsuch association with the number of examination gloves\nused (4). Examination gloves commonly contain higher lev-\nels of protein allergens and generate higher exposures to\naeroallergens (23). In contrast, another study found no dif-\nference in skin prick test conversion rates between users of\npowdered (high-protein) gloves and users of powder-free\n(low-protein) gloves followed prospectively for a year (21).\nYet another study showed no relation between powdered\nglove use and latex-specific IgE antibodies (3). Other stud-\nies have failed to find evidence that latex glove use is asso-\nciated with latex sensitization. In a prospective study of\nlatex glove users, the incidence of latex sensitization (deter-\nmined by skin prick test) was 1 percent per year among\nusers of high-protein, powdered latex gloves and was 1 per-\ncent per year among users of low-protein, powder-free latex\ngloves (21). Similar findings were obtained in a recent\ncross-sectional study in which neither current nor past use of\nlatex gloves was associated with latex sensitization in hos-\npital-based health care workers (34).\nPostulated explanations for this lack of evidence of dose\nresponse include selection of sensitized workers out of\nlatex-exposed jobs and avoidance of latex gloves by sub-\njects after they have become sensitized. While both of these\ntendencies may exist, the absence of evidence of dose\nresponse remains an important argument against a conclu-\nsion that latex glove use is a cause of allergic sensitization.\nOther occupations in which there is an appreciable risk of\nIgE-mediated allergic sensitization (such as in workers\nexposed to laboratory animals, platinum salts, and grain\ndust) show unequivocal evidence of increasing risk with\nincreasing duration, intensity, and frequency of exposure\n(39\u00ad47). Removal of sensitized workers and avoidance of\nexposure in these settings does not obscure the evidence that\nworkers with heavier, longer, and more frequent exposure\nare at higher risk of sensitization (48).\nLatex sensitization among patients is believed to be a\nresult of intimate contact with latex-containing products\nduring medical procedures, such as among patients with\ncele (51), congenital genitourinary anomalies (36), and mul-\ntiple surgeries (52), whereas the studies of latex glove use\nsuggest that the relative risk of sensitization is low when\nthere is only skin contact. Our findings are consistent with\nthis interpretation. It is possible that immediate hypersensi-\ntivity reactions that are diagnosed after latex exposure in\nhealth care workers may reflect increased clinical surveil-\nlance rather than increased rates of sensitization.\nThe limitations of the NHANES III data include a lack of\ninformation about the specific job duties, specific types of\ngloves used, or subjects' handling of or exposure to other\nlatex devices at work. As a result, the explanation for the\nassociation we observed between latex sensitization and\ncurrent jobs in health care in which gloves were not used\nremains unclear and should be the subject of additional\nstudy. A further limitation of the NHANES III data is the\nlack of information on glove use in the longest-held occu-\npations, which precluded any analyses of whether the risk of\nsensitization in longest-held jobs in health care work was\nrelated to glove use. It is possible that other sources of expo-\nsure to latex rubber in the general environment may be\nimportant determinants of sensitization. For example, expo-\nsure to latex antigens is common at low levels from sources\nsuch as vehicle tire dust and dusts deposited around free-\nways (53). It is possible that persons who held some specific\noccupations in our referent category (such as vehicle\nmechanics who repair tires, professional drivers, and rubber\nworkers) were exposed to latex and that this may have\nincreased the prevalence of sensitization in our referent\ngroup. However, it is likely that such an effect would be\nsmall because such persons made up a small proportion of\nthe referent group. Moreover, this would not explain why\nhealth care workers who did not use gloves would be at sub-\nstantially increased odds, while those who used gloves\nwould not.\nThe estimates of latex antibody seroprevalence in this\nstudy are somewhat higher than those in other studies that\nsons for this are not clear. The laboratory personnel who\nconducted the AlaSTAT assays at the CDC were blinded to\nthe subjects' identities (27), making differential observation\nbias unlikely. Any systematic error in the AlaSTAT assays\nwould likely have affected all of the NHANES III subjects\nand would be unlikely to account for the findings in any par-\nticular occupational group. Moreover, the pattern of associ-\nations with age, sex, and race found in this study agrees\nclosely with findings from other studies that used the same\nmethods, indicating that there was not random error ade-\nquate to obscure these associations.\n"
