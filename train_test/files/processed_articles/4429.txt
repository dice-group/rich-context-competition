Such performance evaluation uncertainties will, in\nturn, provoke perceived tensions as performative teachers want to be (perceived as) performers\nbut become uncertain as to when and why they did (not) perform well.

A first one suggests that performative technologies will\nbe met by resistance and refusal when `touching ground' in educational settings (e.g. Ball, 2015).\nThe premise is that the neo-liberal underpinnings of many performative technologies tend to `clash'\nwith traditional teacher values (Lasky, 2005; Tang, 2011) \u00ad a clash that is variously referred to as\nthe collision of `a collegial humanistic system' and a `managerialist' one (Lasky, 2005), `service\nethics' and `external accountability' (Mausethagen, 2013), `professional responsibility' and\n`accountability' (Solbrekke and Englund, 2011), and `old professionalism' and `new professional-\nism' (Helg\u00f8y and Homme, 2007). And, to the extent that such collisions threaten to de-profession-\nargued that performative technologies will encounter scepticism and resistance in educational\nsettings.\nA second line of reasoning de-emphasises the `clash perspective' and suggests that, despite\npotential collisions, performative technologies will prevail over time. In fact, when the neo-liberal\nmachinery is allowed to grind on for some time, it will not only change what teachers do, but also\nwho they are \u00ad i.e. their identities (Ball, 2003). Teachers will, it is suggested, become performers\nas they are gradually colonized by the new regimes of performativity (Anderson and Cohen, 2015;\nArguably, a common point of departure in both these lines of reasoning is that performative\ntechnologies, due to their (neo-liberal) underpinnings, constitute a form of antithesis to more tradi-\ntional teacher values. And again, based on this, a large and growing literature has directed its atten-\ntion towards how such technologies are (negatively) received in educational settings and/or the\nnew kind of teacher identity that they (may) bring about. Importantly though, considerably less\nattention has been devoted to what happens when teachers have already developed performative\nidentities and go `all in' in their attempts to secure a sense of self as performers. That is, when a\n`performative culture' (cf. Jeffrey, 2002; Troman et al., 2007)2 has already been established and\nteachers strive towards performing the practices that the performative technologies invoke.\neasy to assume that such a situation would reduce the subjective aspects as well as the uncertainties\nand complexities of being a teacher. That is, an increased reliance upon, and acceptance of, per-\nformative technologies would engineer the professional milieu towards uncertainty reduction\nwhere work in general and output in particular are monitored and evaluated according to standards\nthat are, allegedly, accurate and able to capture teacher performances, like a lighthouse that teach-\ners can orient themselves against. However, based on the findings from a qualitative field study of\na number of teachers working in a highly performative culture in a Swedish school \u00ad a culture\nwhere teachers stressed the continuous need (and also desire) to perform, regardless of whether\nthey talked about the school as such, the pupils, or themselves as individuals \u00ad we argue that this\nis not necessarily the case. Rather, as we started to interview teachers in this performative school\nculture the emerging empirical evidence strongly suggested that, even when teachers submit to the\nunderlying logic of performative technologies, the ongoing reproduction of a performative identity\nmay involve substantial cognitive struggles. Based on these emergent findings, the purpose of the\ncurrent paper is twofold. First, to elaborate on the notion of teachers as struggling performers, i.e.\nteachers who attempt to secure their identities through performing the practices that the performa-\ntive technologies invoke, but where such identity work becomes a struggle because of the uncer-\ntainties revolving around such idealized practices. Second, to identify and theorize on the type of\nuncertainties that seems to bring about such a teacher identity.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, we deal with rel-\nevant parts of the literature that focus on how and why performative technologies mediate contem-\nporary teacher identities. This is followed by a section on research strategy and methods. We then\npresent a brief background and context to our empirical findings which, in turn, are presented in\nthree different sub-sections; the performative technologies in use in the particular school under\nstudy, the notion of teachers as struggling performers, and the type of performative technology\nuncertainties that seems to give rise to the struggling performer identity. In two final sections, we\ndiscuss how our findings contribute to existing literature and provide concluding thoughts.\nPerformative technologies and teacher identities\nTeacher identity has become a `hot topic' in recent educational literature (see e.g. Beauchamp and\nThomas, 2009). As suggested above we direct our attention to one part of this literature, namely the\none focusing on how teacher identities are shaped by their broader social and political settings (see\nLeonard and Roberts, 2014). In particular, we concentrate on the idea that an increased reliance on\nperformative technologies in schools tends to produce a particular form of teacher identity; the\nPerformative teacher identities\nGenerally speaking, teacher identity concerns an individual's attempts to understand who one is\nand what it means to be a teacher.3 It is about making sense of, or conceptualizing, the `self' in an\neducational context (Beijaard et al., 2004; Izadinia, 2013). Such introspective sense-making pro-\ncesses are typically ongoing and influenced by a range of contextual aspects (Beauchamp and\nThomas, 2009). We direct our attention to one such aspect, namely performative technologies. The\nreason is that a number of authors have argued that a new form of teacher identity will develop in\nresponse to an increased reliance on performative technologies in educational settings, namely the\nA common theme in this literature seems to be the notion that teachers to an increasing extent\nhave to orient themselves toward those externally defined criteria for success that the performative\ntechnologies offer. That is, in order to secure a sense of self in an increasingly performative educa-\ntional landscape teachers have to develop a number of qualities which allow them to perform,\nwhere performing means `not the pursuit of educational ideals, like personal autonomy, or eman-\ncipation but, instead, the subsumption of education under the demands of efficiency for the total\nsocial system' (Marshall, 1999: 310). Table 1 summarizes the identity qualities that have been\nidentified in extant literature.\nOne such quality relates to an overall focus on (improved) outcomes (cf. Lyotard, 1984).\nRegardless of whether such outcomes refer to the number of pupils passing a particular course or\nthe ranking one receives in a pupil survey, a performative teacher is one who is able to prove\nherself as a continuously `delivering individual'. That is, as one who is able to provide results and\nA second quality often referred to in the literature relates to the entrepreneurial self. A qual-\nity which stresses the need to be, for example, enterprising, striving, and risk-taking \u00ad traits\nwhich will not only allow the teacher to perform as an individual but also to validate herself in\ncomparison with competing others (cf. Anderson and Cohen, 2015; Collinson, 2003; Stoten,\n2013). Third, and related, a performer also has to nurture her individualistic qualities. The\npremise is that the neo-liberal performative discourse individualizes. It endows the individual\nwith increased forms of freedom, of autonomy, and of possibilities of individual choice.\nHowever, performative discourses also restrict as much as they liberalize, through providing\nperformative ideals. Ideals which the individual, despite their often-unattainable characteris-\ntics, is assumed to rely on through being, for example, enterprising and risk-taking. Put differ-\nently, in a performative society there is no one else to blame but yourself (cf. Knights and\nClarke, 2014). A final, and related, quality concerns the individual's overall adaptive ability.\nThat is, in order to be(come) an entrepreneurial and delivering individual, the performer has to\nconceive of herself as a workable object; as something that is malleable and formable; as some-\nthing that is adaptable to the performative demands. Even to the extent that one is prepared to\nshow important others what they want to see (Jeffrey, 2002), through `fabricating' and display-\ning a particular version of self (Ball, 2003).\nPerformative technologies as mediators of teacher identities\nWhat then is it about the performative technologies that make teachers develop and nurture such\nqualities? A general answer in the literature is that in a performative society respect is earned,\nsocial acceptance is secured, and self-esteem is achieved when people are able to prove themselves\nin and through the language provided by such technologies. Put differently, it is suggested that\nwhen being exposed to performative technologies people have a tendency to, over time, come to\nrecognize, talk about, and evaluate themselves and others in and through such a language. But then\nagain, why are individual teachers willing to conform to such ideas? We suggest the literature pro-\nvides two main answers to this question, reflecting two mechanisms that enhance the willingness\nto conform.\nThe first answer is well-rehearsed in the critical educational literature and refers to the kind of\n(potential) visibility that performative technologies engender. In particular, a number of scholars\nhave drawn upon Foucault and his discussion of Bentham's architectural design of a prison in\nterms of a `panopticon' to suggest that performative technologies may indeed create a form of\n`complete visibility'. The premise is that in Bentham's prison the cells were arranged in such a way\nthat the total interior of every single cell was observable from a single watch tower. Under such an\narchitectural figure, Foucault (1977) suggests, visibility becomes a trap; the observed is seen but\nTable 1. Qualities of performative teacher identities.\nIdentity quality in existing literature Underlying logic\nOutcome orientation You are not who you are but what you perform\nEntrepreneurial You have to be energetic and enterprising in order to perform\nIndividualistic You are individually accountable for your own performances\nWorkable object You can always do more in order to improve your\nperformances\ncannot himself see; he becomes the object of information but not a part of communication.\nSurveillance becomes permanent in its effects even though it may be discontinuous in its action\n(Foucault, 1977: 201). Under such arrangements, the observed will, it is argued, become reflective\nand disciplined.\nTransferred to the educational arena it has been suggested that the use of classroom observa-\ntions, open learning spaces, pupil surveys, etc. help to bring about such a mesmerizing gaze,\nwhereby the daily work of teachers becomes increasingly visible and available for public scrutiny\n(Helg\u00f8y and Homme, 2007). A development that tends to make teachers more aware of who they\nare and increasingly attentive to the particular format and values cherished by such technologies\nThis brings us to the latter strand of arguments, namely that performative technologies have an\nability to elicit our `entrepreneurial self'. This strand adds to the former through highlighting the\nparticular format by which performative technologies construct the world. The premise is that\nperformative technologies not only render visible particular people and their activities, but do so\nin a particular format; a format that de-contextualizes, reduces, and simplifies (e.g. M\u00f8ller, 2009).\nIn the words of Jeffrey (2002), it formalizes and categorizes in `little boxes'. It focuses on pre-\ndetermined targets according to the logic of `one size fits all'; it narrows the goals of education\nand the assessment instrument by which such goals are evaluated; it visualizes and translates the\ncomplexities of professional work `into a generic form' (Helg\u00f8y and Homme, 2007: 234; see also\nAn important reason for doing so is that such a format \u00ad especially when educational settings\nare turned into numbers \u00ad eliminate all those contextual specificities that make comparisons dif-\nficult. Performative technologies make work achievements commensurate with each other.\nRegardless of whether, for example, a pupil survey concerns a course in mathematics or psychol-\nogy, a first year or a final year course, its results may always be compared to those received in\nother contexts. They may be aggregated, differentiated, standardized, and normalized. Such fur-\nther transformations of the results, in turn, constitute an important part of the performative logic\nsince they not only allow for different times and spaces to be linked to each other (cf. Latour,\n1999), but also for competition to emerge. Competition presumes something to compete on, and\nonce aware `that we can become more than we were and be better than others' (Ball, 2003: 218\u00ad\n219) that condition is fulfilled. A condition that through the work of performative technologies\nencourages us to be(come) self-managing, striving, enterprising, results-oriented, so that in the\nend, we may all become competitive.\nThe story would probably end here if we could ascertain that the introduction of performance\ntechnologies would (perhaps after some initial clashes with traditional conceptions of what consti-\ntutes a teacher) bring about a reflective, disciplined, results-oriented, and enterprising professional\nteacher. Whether this is the case is, of course, an empirical question. But furthermore, and perhaps\nmore importantly, even if performers are `created' through performance technologies, one may\nalso argue that even though we can point to the general identity features of performers, it is not\nnecessarily the case that the qualities of the performer (see Table 1) are enough to finally define\nhis or her identity as a working professional. That is, since human beings, in this case performers,\nmust reconsider themselves in relation to the ideals that they strive to attain, the final result and\ncomponents of their identity construction must not necessarily imply that the technologies give\nfinal guidance that implies a clear and fixed identity construction. It is human beings (i.e. the per-\nformers themselves, but not the systems or technologies) that construct their identity (Katsuno,\n2016). Even if they accept the relevance and legitimacy of the technologies as a foundational ideal\nof their professional work, the final answer to who they are (the identity issue) has not been given.\nFor this reason, the question of how and why performing teachers construct their identity remains\nan open question that should be answered empirically, and not just assumed based on the supposed\nqualities of the performing teachers or the performative technologies (cf. Leonard and Roberts,\n2014). The paper now turns to this empirical task.\nResearch methods\nResearch context and design\nThe field work reported here is part of a larger research programme that aims to further our under-\nstanding of how the teaching profession is reconstructed against a background of increased indi-\nvidual and collective evaluation and assessment of teachers' work. In the project, a large number\nof Swedish primary and upper secondary schools are studied primarily by means of interviews and\narchival data, but also via a questionnaire. In this particular paper, we explore parts of the collected\nmaterial, namely that which originates from one of the independent upper secondary schools (here\nreferred to as Fungor).\nConsidering our overall purpose to explore how teacher identities become constituted in and\nthrough performative technologies, we became particularly interested in Fungor after having con-\nducted an initial interview with the principal in September 2014. In Fungor, the use of performa-\ntive technologies seemed both extensive and thorough. In fact, the principal vividly and\nenthusiastically told us about all the means by which she could manage the teachers, ranging from\nindividual meetings for planning and evaluation to classroom observations and pupil surveys. She\nalso testified to a general need for teachers to `put themselves on display'; `you have to dare to\nlook at yourself, to scrutinize yourself' and if you are not ready to do that, `perhaps you shouldn't\nwork here'.\nBased on this, we asked and were permitted to interview a number of teachers on how they\nperceived that they were affected by the fact that their teacher performances seemed so extensively\nvisualized and evaluated.\nData collection\nDuring 2015, all in all ten people that were either working at the school or had recently worked\nthere were interviewed, including the principal and the assistant principal. Although the number of\ninterviewed staff is limited, one should bear in mind that the total number of people working at the\nschool does not amount to more than around 25 (see below). Two researchers were present during\nall interviews and each interview lasted approximately one hour. They were all recorded and\ntranscribed.\nApart from interviews we also had access to a large number of documents and archival data. Of\nparticular importance were all those documents that materialized the performative technologies\nper se. For example, we had access to the pay policy and related performance-related pay criteria,\nvarious course evaluations and pupil surveys, templates for classroom observations, and also, to\nmore general school documents such as job descriptions and quality reports.\nData analysis\nThe analysis of interviews and documents was ongoing all through the duration of the case study\n(cf. Troman, 2008). On the one hand, this allowed us to bring an initial literature-based understand-\ning to the field, whereby we could define a particular interest, and based on this, focus our inter-\nviews on themes related to teacher identity and performative technologies. However, on the other\nhand, an ongoing analysis also allowed us to gradually reflect upon, and even redefine the field as\nwe came to experience it, especially when empirical insights did not seem to match our pre-under-\nstandings. For example, it was through such an ongoing reflection that we became interested in the\nnotion of performance evaluation uncertainties. The premise was that while our pre-understand-\nings built upon the idea that performative technologies mainly reduce uncertainty through trans-\nforming a complex world into a de-contextualized and simplified format, they seemed to add other\nforms of uncertainty to our interviewees.\nWhen this emergent empirical insight was made during one of the early interviews we went\nback and re-read the few interviews already conducted. And, as the re-reading gave us reason to\nfurther explore this emerging theme, we also made sure to more thoroughly penetrate it during the\nremaining interviews.\nAfter having collected all data we conducted a more systematic analysis of the material related\nto the focal theme of this paper. Basically, this analysis could be seen as a two-step procedure. First,\nthe empirical material was analysed to establish empirically the existence of performers. As noted\npreviously, the mere use of performance technologies does not necessarily imply that people in\norganizations become performers. The result could be clashes, resistance or mere disinterest. The\nempirical material confirmed, however, self-descriptions in line with the four performative identity\nqualities identified in the literature (see Table 1). For each of these four qualities, an underlying\nlogic was identified and substantiated with interview material (see Table 2). Second, using the\nsame four identity qualities as analytical nodes and given that the teachers could be identified as\nperformers, four different performance evaluation uncertainties were identified together with four\ncorresponding identity-related struggles found in the empirical material (see Table 3). This second\nlevel analysis made it clear that the teachers articulated a number of uncertainties and cognitive\ntensions associated with these uncertainties. These tensions warrant us to draw conclusions about\nthe problematic identity construction of the professional teachers, who were finally defined and\nunderstood as struggling performers.\nBackground and context to the empirical findings\nThe growing performance orientation of the Swedish school system\nIn the last decades, the school system of Sweden has undergone substantial reform and change.\nMost notably, a number of reforms in the 1990s changed the traditionally centralized and regu-\nlated systems (see Stenl\u00e5s, 2009; or Lundahl et al., 2010 for a thorough account of these reforms).\nThe state was replaced by municipalities as the principal organizer of public education, implying\nstrong decentralization of the school system. Since the early 1990s, teachers in the public-school\nsystem have been employed by local municipalities rather than the state. Free school choice was\nintroduced in the 1990s, and a new voucher system made it possible for private school organizers\nto establish themselves as alternatives to the public education organizers. From a governance\nperspective, management by objectives was introduced as a central principle replacing the old\nrule-based system. Along with these general reforms, other reforms have been launched that have\nchanged the field, for example new systems for marking, ongoing changes in the teacher educa-\ntion curriculum, and the recent teacher certification reform, implying that (with some exceptions)\nonly certified teachers are allowed to perform central tasks of the profession (Solbrekke and\nOne aspect of particular interest in this study is how the reforms tend towards marketization of\nthe school system (Holm and Lundstr\u00f6m, 2011; Lundahl et al., 2013). Following free school choice\nand the establishment of a high number of new schools and principal education organizers, a\nmarket for school choice has emerged (Erixon Arreman and Holm, 2011; Lundahl et al., 2013).\nOne important reason for this has been the voucher system, implying that schools \u00ad whether public\nor independent (encompassing both profit and non-profit driven private schools) \u00ad are paid for\neach pupil they attract, in principle without any attention being paid to school quality or school\nperformance with regard to, for example, pupil achievements. For this reason, scholars tend to talk\nabout a school market in Sweden (Erixon Arreman and Holm, 2011; Holm and Lundstr\u00f6m, 2011;\nwhere pupils are socialized into a behaviour of consumerism.\nGeneral interpretations of how the school system has changed emphasize the logic of account-\nability as central to schools and teachers in the wake of the reform era (Solbrekke and Englund,\n2014). Being held accountable for what one can offer pupils becomes a reality for teachers. This\ngoes hand in hand with extended demands on the teachers' professional engagement in, for exam-\nple, the marketing activities of the school, which is one example of how non-traditional tasks, not\nrelated to teaching, are challenging the traditional autonomy of the teaching profession (Stenl\u00e5s,\n2009; Wermke, 2013). Another aspect of the threat to autonomy, related to the control and\nappraisal of teachers' work, is the rising importance of quality measurement and student voice.\nSuch tools and technologies become an increasingly important aspect for schools, not least for\ncompetitive purposes (cf. Page, 2015). Making schools attractive to present and potential pupils\n(and their parents and others) implies not only `offers' (laptops, free Wednesdays, etc., see, for\nexample, Erixon Arreman and Holm, 2011), but also making the teachers accountable for the\nperceived quality of their teaching and the results of it. Evaluation of teachers and pupils becomes\ninstrumental in attracting others.\nAnother, perhaps unforeseen, consequence of the development of the school market is the rise\nof a small number of large private educational organizers owned by private equity companies that\nhave established themselves as major players in the field. These commercially driven companies\ncontrol a substantial share of the school market as a consequence of consolidation in the last dec-\nades. The focal school in this study belongs to one of these private education organizers. It is an\nexample of an originally small and independent school group (consisting of some 15 schools) that\nwas overtaken by and incorporated into a large profit driven educational organizer. Our focal unit\nwithin this group \u00ad Fungor \u00ad is an upper secondary school that is situated in one of Sweden's\nlarger cities. Again, the staff list includes some 25 people and the number of pupils is just under\n300 (of which 75% are girls). A majority of the pupils follow a vocational programme such as\nthe `child recreation programme', `business and administration programme' or the `handicraft\nprogramme'. The latter one is the largest by far and includes specializations in hairdressing,\nhair-styling, and makeup.\nFindings\nPerformance management in Fungor\nPerformance management in Fungor covered a wide range of technologies and practices. Largely\nin line with the taxonomy provided by Page (2015), teacher work was visualized and evaluated by\nvarious means, including classroom observations, learning walks by the principal, open learning\nspaces, and pupil voice.\nFor reasons of space, we will focus on one of these technologies, namely pupil voice. In particu-\nlar, we will direct our attention to the ways in which pupils were allowed to make their voice heard\nthrough formal course and customer satisfaction surveys. The reason for this is twofold. First, such\nsurveys stood out as important technologies in all teacher interviews. Second, the outcomes from\npupil surveys constituted one of the criteria for setting performance-related salary rates, which\nclearly made them a constitutive part of the performative climate in Fungor. We will start out with\nthis latter aspect of the pupil surveys, namely that they fed into the process whereby salaries were\nrelated to teacher performances.\nA central tenet of Fungor's salary policy was that there should be no differences in salary due to\nsex, age, skin colour, sexual orientation, disabilities, nationality, or social/ethical background.\nRather, salaries should be based on `development, competence, and experience. It is achieved\nresults that should be encouraged in [Fungor]'. Such results were specified in and through nine\ncriteria, divided into two main areas; `My role in Fungor' (which included seven criteria) and\n`Development of the school and our operations'(two criteria). For each criterion, teachers could be\nclassified as `good', `great', or `excellent' (see Figure 1).\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, evaluations (of different kinds) constituted one of the criteria based\non which salaries were set. In Fungor, examples of such evaluations were course evaluations con-\nducted by teachers on individual courses and a yearly survey among pupils in the form of a\nCustomer Satisfaction Index (CSI). Whereas course evaluations were conducted by the individual\nteacher and focused largely on providing the teacher with formative feedback for course improve-\nment, the CSI was conducted electronically by an external agency and had more of a summative\ncharacter. The external agency also compiled and distributed the results to the principal and teach-\ners individually. And as summarized by one of the teachers, such results fed into the performance\nreview: `We use these as a basis to review our results at the end of the school year. I go through\nthem and she [the principal] goes through them and then we meet and discuss'. In the two follow-\ning sections, we will discuss: (a) how the existence, and rather intense mobilization of such perfor-\nmance evaluations contributed towards a performative teacher identity in Fungor, and (b) how\nuncertainties revolving around the design and use of such evaluations made performances some-\nwhat of a struggle among teachers.\nPerformative teacher identities in Fungor\nWe find plenty of evidence of a performative mind-set among the teachers in Fungor. Table 2 pro-\nvides an overview of the key findings related to the notion of teachers as performers. As suggested in\nFigure 1. Examples of criteria for performance related pay in Fungor (internal document).\nTable 2, teachers reproduced a number of qualities typically associated with a performative identity\nin the existing literature; qualities implying, for instance, that `you are not who you are but what you\nperform' and that `you need to rely on yourself and your enterprising qualities in order to perform'.\nOne particular part of the teachers' performative mind-set that became abundantly clear during\nthe interviews was their distinct outcome orientation (cf. the first identity quality in Table 2). That\nis, regardless of whether they talked about the school, the pupils or themselves, it was evident that\nthey had a clear focus on (improved) outcomes (cf. Lyotard, 1984). A focus that typically revolved\naround an assumed reciprocal relationship between their own performances and those of their\npupils, according to the logic `if I perform well my pupils will too, and when they perform well it\nwill be to my (and my school's) benefit'.\nFor example, related to the pupil surveys referred to above, one teacher suggested that `sure,\nit's a lot of evaluations, but I really like the pupil survey because there you get the final result;\nare they happy or not?', while another one said that `I think it's good that we have these evalua-\ntions. They ensure that everyone looks for progress since you know that there will be an evalua-\ntion in the end'.\nLinked to such an outcome-orientation, the interviews with teachers also suggested that other\nqualities associated with a performative identity were being reproduced (cf. Table 2). That is, it was\nclear that teachers in Fungor were not just passively awaiting the outcomes of such pupil surveys\n\u00ad hoping for `the best'. Rather, almost all teachers testified to a general `performance culture' in\nwhich the individual teacher had to be energetic and enterprising in order to make a good teacher\nTable 2. Performative teacher identities.\nIdentity quality in\nexisting literature\nUnderlying logic Quotations from interviews\nOutcome\norientation\nYou are not who\nyou are but what\nyou perform\n`At the end of the day it's about results'\n`If the results [from the pupil surveys] are good it doesn't\nreally matter what it is that is evaluated'\nEntrepreneurial You have to be\nenergetic and\nenterprising in\norder to perform\n`From the pupil's perspective [Fungor] ought to be a really\nattractive school.

It makes us think\nabout pedagogical issues even at home. You're constantly\nthinking about how to reach your pupils even better'\n`You can't just stop and stand still. That just doesn't work in\ntoday's world'\nin Fungor. Or, as phrased by one of the teachers: `I don't think that Fungor has ever recruited a\nteacher that wasn't a highly competitive person'.\nThe principal, and also the formal job descriptions, corroborated this assertion. In fact, it seemed\nto be an important strategy to recruit teachers who were not only focused on results, but also pre-\npared to develop themselves and their entrepreneurial traits. Part of this strategy seemed to be to\nrecruit `young and hungry' people who had a background in sports (on elite level), for two main\nreasons. First, and as suggested by the principal, teachers in Fungor had to be prepared to put them-\nselves on display. The `former athletes' were used to this type of scrutinizing from their sports\ncareers, and hence, were used to finding ways to make it to the team. Second, and related, this was\nalso a category of people that would \u00ad allegedly \u00ad be best placed to adapt to the requirements from\nboth pupils and school management.\nBeing an independent individual was considered another important quality in order to\nobtain results in Fungor (see Table 2). That is, and as suggested above, individual teachers\nclearly felt a pressure to compete in relation to their colleagues in order to not `be worse than\nanybody else'. Hence, and as suggested by the principal's indication that `the school isn't\nstronger than its weakest link', the individual had to put her own house in order if she wanted\nto be promoted or receive a pay rise; that is to say, if she wanted to secure a sense of self as a\nperformer. The existing performance management practices also encouraged such an individ-\nual orientation. Hence, it was clear that the performer not only had to nurture her energetic and\ninnovative qualities but also to put herself as an individual in the first place. And, linked to\nthis, the performer also had to conceive of herself as a person who is willing to constantly\nimprove; as one who is willing to be progressively `efficient' (cf. Ball, 2003; Collinson, 2003;\nTo summarize and conclude thus far, we find plenty of evidence of a performative identity\namong teachers in Fungor. The use of performative technologies had arguably become a normal-\nized aspect of their daily work, and they clearly reproduced the language and logics underlying\nthese technologies.\nPerformance evaluation uncertainties and teacher identities in Fungor\nWhile teachers in Fungor clearly had a performative mind-set, we also find that the reproduction\nof performative identities in Fungor was associated with a number of cognitive struggles that\nteachers had to deal with as they aspired to perform. Generally speaking, such cognitive struggles\nseemed based on the following (empirical) premises. First, when you are a performer, and hence,\nderive a sense of self largely from how (others perceive that) you perform, it becomes highly\nimportant how your performances are represented and recognized by performative technologies.\nSecond, any uncertainties related to such representations and recognitions will typically provoke\ncognitive tensions as you want to perform but become genuinely uncertain how to do so, when you\ndid (or did not) perform, and/or why you did (or did not) perform well. Third, such cognitive ten-\nsions may fuel a number of identity-related questions such as what it really means to be, for exam-\nple, `outcome-oriented' or `individually accountable'. That is, rather than foster the emergence or\nreproduction of performative identity qualities per se, the experienced tensions may give rise to a\nnumber of introspective questions related to such qualities, thereby turning the realization of a\nperforming identity into a cognitive struggle. In this paper, we depict such struggles of what it\nmeans to be a performer in a performative culture as a particular type of performative identity; the\nstruggling performer.\nTable 3 summarizes these findings. As suggested by the left-hand side of the table, the per-\nformative technologies may produce uncertainties related to each performative quality of a\nperformative identity, thereby giving rise to (at least) four different tensions. And as suggested by\nthe right-hand side of Table 3, these tensions may propel a number of identity-related questions.\nImportantly though, before going into details it should be noted that the different performance\nevaluation uncertainties are not necessarily independent of each other. Rather, they reflect different\naspects of one and the same phenomenon, namely teacher performances, and hence may be related\nand to some extent even overlapping. For analytical reasons though, we present and discuss them\nseparately below.\nIf we start out with their outcome-orientation, this quality suggests that teachers will value vis-\nible and tangible outcomes. Related to this, we identify a first type of perceived uncertainty among\nteachers; an uncertainty that is rooted in the ways in which performative technologies reflect and\nrecognize such outcomes based on qualitative judgements made by others, where such judgements\nare largely beyond the control of the individual teacher. For example, when it came to the pupil\nsurveys referred to above, it was largely up to the pupils and their `whims and wills' to establish\nand evaluate the performances of teachers. In a similar manner, the criteria used for classroom\nobservations and wage discussions had to be construed by someone, typically the principal, thereby\nleaving room for rather open ended and qualitative evaluations of outcomes.\nThis judgement-related dimension of performance representation and evaluation made the pro-\ncess highly unpredictable to the teachers, since they felt that there were many different aspects that\ncould affect the discretionary judgements of the pupils and the principal; aspects that were not\nnecessarily related to the individual teacher's performances per se. As suggested by one of the\nteachers, `you never know what you will get [in the pupil surveys]. They can come up with just\nabout anything at all'. Or, as suggested by another teacher when talking about what affects the pupils\nwhen evaluating teachers, `I mean they are controlled by their emotions like any human being. The\ndifference though is that you and I can control our emotions because we're adults and we can control\nour thoughts in a different way than the pupils can'. And importantly, based on the performer's\ngenuine interest in the actual outcomes, this type of unpredictability clearly gave rise to perceived\ntensions which, in turn, resulted in reflections related to what it meant to be a performer. To illus-\ntrate, consider the following reflection from a teacher, when talking about the pupil survey.\nTable 3. Perceived tensions and teachers as struggling performers.\nPerceived tensions Identity-related cognitive struggle\nTension between teachers' outcome orientation\nand the ways in which performative technologies\nreflect and evaluate such outcomes based on the\nqualitative judgements of others\nWhat does it mean to be a performer\nwhen my outcomes are dependent on\nthe qualitative judgements of others?\nTension between teachers' entrepreneurial\norientation and the ways in which performative\ntechnologies do not always reflect and recognize\ntheir entrepreneurial efforts\nWhat does it mean to be a performer\nwhen my entrepreneurial efforts are\nnot reflected and recognized?\nTension between teachers' individualistic\norientation and they ways in which performative\ntechnologies reflect and recognize the effects\nof collective educational processes as if they\nrepresented individual performances\nWhat does it mean to be a performer\nwhen individual outcomes are\ndependent on the performances of\nothers?\nTension between teachers as workable objects\nand the ways in which performative technologies\nreflect and recognize educational performances\nin a relativistic way\nWhat does it mean to be a performer\nwhen the value of my performances is\nalways relative?\nIt was really pressuring as these [i.e. the pupil surveys] were used as a basis for our salaries.And I mean, based\non these, they also picked out three teachers per school who were nominated to the pedagogical award [of the\ngroup]. And if you were nominated this would also affect your salary. But if you're working with a vocational\nprogramme, where the pupils want to become stylists or hair-stylists or if they're taking the handicraft\nprogramme, it will probably be a lot easier to teach things like make-up, hair dyeing or hair cutting. At least a\nthird of the pupils haven't passed the X course from secondary school. So, as a X teacher, I won't have the\nsame chance to reach these pupils in class. It will be a lot harder for me to get their approval. And still, they\nwere the ones who would answer questions like `does your teacher have the ability to involve you in class?',\n`does your teacher inspire you?'and `is your teacher competent in the subject that s/he teaches?'\nAnd, when asked about how that made you feel as an individual teacher, she continued:\nWell, it's not very motivating. When you're competitive as a person it's like fighting with one hand on your\nback. [...] When you feel that you're doing the job as well as anyone else or even better, but your colleagues\nare paid more because it's easier for them to reach the pupils, then it gets really frustrating. [...] You have\nto care about the outcomes because otherwise you'll fall behind salary-wise, but you really start wondering\nwhether these are the aspects that should be allowed to affect our salaries.\nAsecond, and related, type of perceived performance evaluation uncertainty that (through the ten-\nsions it produced) seemed to give rise to cognitive struggles could be referred to the entrepreneurial\nidentity quality. Unlike the first type of uncertainty which emphasizes the many aspects that seem to\naffect those that make the qualitative judgements of outcomes, this type of uncertainty is premised on\nthe ways in which the performative technologies under study are sometimes perceived not to reflect\nthe individual teacher's efforts underlying such outcomes. In fact, despite that the performative tech-\nnologies (such as the performance-related pay criteria) explicitly encouraged teachers to be enterpris-\ning and inventive, teachers experienced that the performance evaluation practices failed to account\nfor such activities.As suggested by one of the teachers: `every year I reflect upon all the things I have\ndone as a teacher. I write almost like a novel that I hand over to the principal.And she says that all my\nefforts should affect the salary, but it is hard to tell. I mean I can't see what my colleagues get and I\ncan't see how she converts these [efforts] into my salary'.\nAn important reason for this uncertainty was that teachers perceived that the performative tech-\nnologies did not have the ability to `sort out' the efforts of individual teachers from all the other\nparticularities, eventualities, and contingencies that led up to a particular outcome, at least not in a\nfair way. To illustrate, consider the following quotation from a teacher who reflects upon the prob-\nlem that no matter what you did as a teacher, it was hard to see whether the efforts `paid off'or not.\nWe have this overall demand that all pupils must pass, and that's something that I value as a teacher; I\nreally want my pupils to do well. So I reflect a lot upon how my teaching can contribute towards this. I\nalways try to find new ways of teaching and new examples in order to facilitate their learning. But it is not\nalways that the outcomes reflect this [i.e. all the things that I do], and that can be frustrating. You want to\nachieve so much but then you feel, well, why isn't it working [i.e. why don't my efforts pay off]? And\nwhen you feel stressed and you cannot devote any more time than you're already doing, then it becomes\nreally tough. [...] You know that you're working hard, but still you wonder whether you're doing enough.\nFor example, I'm currently mentoring a pupil with some social issues, and s/he texts me every night to tell\nme whether s/he will show up next day or not.And I'm really struggling with this feeling; could and should\nI do more for this particular pupil? I feel that I can't answer every night, at least not when the messages\ncome rather late. And yet, I feel this inner conflict.\nHence, although teachers were both allowed and encouraged to find innovative ways of `reach-\ning their pupils' (including various efforts to secure that they looked good in the surveys), teachers\nproblematized the extent to which contextual aspects allowed each and every one to convert such\ninnovativeness to actual outcomes, and also, the extent to which performance management prac-\ntices really valued such innovative activities. Taken together, these prerequisites seemed to give\nrise to frustration and feelings of injustice; feelings which, in turn, turned efforts to secure a sense\nof self as a performer into a struggle. For example, this was evident when one of the teachers\nreflected upon how the judgement-related issue (i.e. the first performance evaluation uncertainty in\nTable 3) also meant that it became unclear how her actual efforts were reflected and recognized in\nthe outcomes.\nSome had tougher subjects than others. That really affected the evaluations. I can give you an example. In\n2011 I met a pupil that had a real phobia for my subject; for real. I mean I meet pupils all the time that don't\nlike my subject, but this time it was a real phobia. She broke out in cold sweat and felt sick. She was ill as\nsoon as she entered the classroom; as soon as she saw me. I mean, she didn't know me but she knew that\nI was a X teacher. It was all part of her history; she had had some really bad experiences. And she was\ngoing to evaluate me! I had to spend hours just talking to her. I had to `prepare' her; make her realize that\nI was there for her; that I wanted her to succeed. She thought I was her enemy, and she was going to\nevaluate me. Just because I was a X teacher I was going to get a bad evaluation. That's not really fair. There\nwere lots of situations like that; you're an ambitious person who just wanted the best for the pupils but you\njust could not reach them. You represented a subject that the pupils experienced as tough and just because\nof that you would have a bad evaluation. It makes you sad really. You could get really tough comments;\nones that weren't really linked to teaching but to you as a person. `Don't wear those ugly trousers'.\nCompletely meaningless comments, or that `you need a better haircut'. Obviously, that kind of comments\ndo not reflect the teaching as such.\nA third and related type of perceived uncertainty could be linked to the individualistic identity\nquality, and emphasizes how the (lack of) efforts from others may affect the outcomes of a particu-\nlar teacher. In contrast to the second type of uncertainty then, the problem here relates not so much\nto whether or not the performative technologies actually reflect the efforts of an accountable\nteacher, but rather to how they portray outcomes as if they were the result of individual endeavours\nwhen, in fact, they are the result of collective performances. Arguably, under such circumstances,\nteachers may typically be left with feelings of uncontrollability since the boundaries of a particular\noutcome go well beyond the individual teacher. And importantly, when you consider yourself (and\nalso want to be perceived as) a performer, such feelings of uncontrollability will typically give rise\nto tensions which, in turn, provoke cognitive struggles.\nTo illustrate, consider the following quotes from two teachers. In the first quote, one of the\nteachers reflects upon how her deep and extensive engagement with pupils was pushing the limit\nof what she was capable of, and still, she felt dependent on others to reach the sought-after out-\ncomes. In the second one, another teacher reflects upon how her performances are dependent on\nthe will of the pupils to be `part of the game'. Clearly, in both cases, such tensions leave the teach-\ners with essentially irreconcilable thoughts, and hence, turn the reproduction of a performative\nidentity into a struggle.\nWhat can I [as an individual teacher] do to make these pupils [who do less well in their studies] more\nengaged? I think we need to reorganize; we need better cooperation [between different actors within the\norganization]. The school counsellor needs to be involved too. Not that I can't establish good relations\nwith the pupils; that's one of my strengths I would say. I care about the individual. I see the whole\nindividual, but that's part of the problem. It really affects me personally. I feel for them [i.e. the pupils who\ndo less well in their studies] and I really want the best for them, but still, I want to carry out my teaching\nalso for those who don't have problems. Make sure that they are motivated, push them, give them\nchallenges, make sure that they receive feedback. But time doesn't really allow me to do that when these\nsocial aspects take most of my time.\nAs long as I have the pupils in my classroom I know that I can help them reach their grades. But if they're\nnot in the classroom [...], well, then I can't really help them in the same way. Sure, I could try to call them,\nbut that's not really part of my job I would say; to track them down if they're out doing other stuff in the\ncity-centre. But as long as I have them in my classroom then of course I can help them.\nSuch uncertainties then, are typically grounded in the ways in which the performative technolo-\ngies in use individualized performances regardless of the extent to which the individual teacher\ncould indeed `control' such performances. A condition which seemed to produce a form of `inner\nstress' by those teachers who felt that they were not `competing on equal terms'.\nA fourth and final type of perceived uncertainty relates to the ways in which performative tech-\nnologies contribute to reflect teacher performances in a relative rather than absolute way. This is\npremised on the ways in which performative technologies de-contextualize, reduce, and transform\nwhat goes on in educational settings into a format that allows for comparisons to be made (e.g.\nMiller and Power, 2013). Comparisons that allow teacher (and other) performances to be related to\nthe past, present, and future, thereby making individuals aware that they are `better or worse than\nthey used to be', that they are `performing better or worse than a competitor', and above all, that\nthey `can always do more'. That is, performative technologies not only allow for single perfor-\nmances to be related in time (i.e. to past and future performances) and space (i.e. to the perfor-\nmances of others), but also to the ideal. An ideal that in many cases is unattainable or at least\nimpossible to sustain over time.\nFrom a performance management perspective, such comparisons (not least to the ideal) are\npivotal as they materialize the possibilities; the potential; the unfulfilled. They display to the per-\nformer that there is always room `to improve, to be better, to be excellent' (Ball, 2003: 220). In\nshort, they construct the performer as a workable object; as something that can and should be\nworked upon. Importantly however, as such relativizations of teacher performances materialize the\ntension between `actual' and `potential' (or wished for) performances, they may also give rise to\ncognitive struggles. That is, they may leave largely outcome-oriented teachers with feelings that no\nmatter how well they perform it is never enough.\nThis dual character of comparisons was manifested in different ways by teachers in Fungor. One\ntelling example may be taken from a one-day workshop organized to define the mental boundaries\nof `good enough'. That is, at the time of our study, the members of staff had just had a workshop\nwhere they discussed what could (not) be expected from them. The reason was that it had become\nan organizational fact (among teachers) that `good enough' was no longer good enough; a fact that\nhad resulted in a number of sick leaves and arguably also contributed to the high staff turnover. As\nexplained by one of the teachers: `We've just had a whole day where we tried to reach an agree-\nment on what is \"good enough\". What we actually need to do and what is just a bonus if we do.\nWe've had a really hard time finding a balance there. I think it's very much related to the individu-\nals working here, the core teachers, the ones that new teachers adapt to. But it's really important\nthat our ambitions do not escalate in absurdum. At the end of the day we need to keep our health\".\nSuch mixed emotions regarding how far the teachers were able and/or willing to push themselves\nwere also displayed in other ways. As suggested by another teacher: `Sometimes you feel this inner\nstress that you constantly need to improve even though you're already doing alright. Sure, you can\nalways get better, but perhaps it would be better if you could stick with the things you do for a\nwhile instead of looking for improvements all the time'.\nArguably, this points to another aspect of the uncertainty surrounding the performative tech-\nnologies, namely how performative technologies relativize particular performances through relat-\ning them to other performances in time and space and also to the ideal. Arguably, such relativizing\nfuels the inexorable pressure to perform, and hence, to conceive of the self as an object that needs\nto be worked upon; to be developed; to be improved. Importantly, however, due to the uncertainties\nrevolving around such `continuous improvements', they also give rise to questions regarding what\nit means to be a performer, as suggested by one of the teachers; `all these demands, they make\npeople ponder over how much they are prepared to do'.\nTaken together, these findings largely corroborate a widespread idea in the extant literature,\nnamely that performative technologies tend to turn individual teachers into performers (Garland\nfindings through providing insights into some of the complexities involved in actually upholding a\nperformative identity. In fact, our findings strongly suggest that the reproduction of a performative\nidentity is no straightforward task, but rather may involve substantial cognitive struggles, even to\nthe extent that we may talk about a particular type of performative identity; the struggling per-\nformer. A teacher identity which on the one hand gets its shape from the identity qualities of a\nperformer, and on the other hand from all the cognitive struggles it takes for a performer to handle\nessentially irreconcilable thoughts in the ongoing pursuit of a sense of self.\nDiscussion\nThis paper engages with and elaborates on the idea in the extant literature that an increased reliance\non performative technologies in schools not only affects what teachers do but also who they are \u00ad\ni.e. their identities. In accordance with large parts of this literature (e.g. Ball, 2003; Jeffrey, 2002;\nTroman, 2008) we find that performative technologies may clearly turn teachers into performers.\nArguably though, we also add to this stream of research through elaborating on how perfor-\nmance evaluation uncertainties are involved in producing a particular type of performative teacher\nidentity; the struggling performer. In short, the findings presented above suggest the following.\nFirst of all, we identify four different performance evaluation uncertainties revolving around how\nperformative technologies often (but not always) reflect and recognize teacher performances; (a)\nbased on qualitative judgements, (b) in a way that fails to take into account their entrepreneurial\nendeavours, (c) in a way that depicts essentially collective effects as individual performances, and\n(d) in a relativizing way. Secondly, we conclude that when performative teachers \u00ad i.e. teachers\nwho want to be (perceived as) high performers \u00ad are subject to such uncertainties they typically\nexperience cognitive tensions. Such tensions then, are the result of the fact that teachers with a\nperformative identity value being perceived as performers but, because of the performance evalu-\nation uncertainties, experience that they do not (know how to) achieve that or struggle to under-\nstand why they did (not) achieve that. Third, and finally, our findings suggest that ongoing\nexperiences of such tensions will trigger various identity-related questions revolving around what\nit means to be a performer, thereby turning the reproduction of a performative identity into a cogni-\ntive struggle.\nArguably, these overall findings suggest three main contributions to the literature on performa-\ntive technologies and teacher identity. A first contribution relates to the identification of four dif-\nferent uncertainties associated with the performative technologies as such. The premise is that\nthese uncertainties provide further insights into the ways in which performative technologies relo-\ncate issues of subjectivity and complexity. Again, a common belief in the extant literature is that\nperformative technologies decontextualize educational settings (M\u00f8ller, 2009) and re-present them\nin rather narrow, generic, unidimensional, and superficial ways \u00ad often in the form of numbers\noften emphasized that such numbers are evaluated by means of comparisons with pre-determined\ntargets, so that the success of individual schools and teachers may be judged in terms of how well\nthey conform to previously determined criteria (Jeffrey, 2002; Perryman, 2006). This is a process\nthat, at least when looked at from a distance, appears to accord objectivity, neutrality, and rational-\nity to things that would otherwise appear to be highly subjective (cf. Ball, 2003; Clarke, 2013).\nA closer look at how such re-presentations of teacher performances are produced and repro-\nduced though suggests that neither are issues of subjectivity resolved by seemingly objective per-\nformative technologies, nor are issues of complexity dissolved by seemingly simplifying\ntechnologies; they are merely relocated. That is, they are relocated from the professional teacher(s)\nto the ones bringing the performative technologies to life. Arguably, our findings put the finger on\ntwo such relocations. First, they show how, regardless of teachers'own perceptions of what consti-\ntutes `good teaching' or `teaching quality', such elusive concepts are typically pinned down in and\nthrough a number of performative technologies (such as the pupil surveys focused in this paper).\nThat is, what is seen as `good teaching' is to a large extent stabilized and materialized in the forms\nconstructed by others (e.g. the principal or school management), and filled out by yet others (e.g.\npupils and parents). Importantly however, while such forms may revolve around a number of\ndecontextualized and pre-determined questions/criteria, issues of subjectivity and complexity do\nnot simply disappear in performative cultures. Rather, they are absorbed and transformed by the\nones feeding the performative technologies with information, regardless of whether they affirm\nsuch subjectivity and complexity or not. Second, they are also absorbed and transformed by the\nones who mobilize the result of such processes, i.e. the performance information per se. That is,\neven though performance information may be seen as decontextualized in the sense that many\naspects of reality are lost when actual teaching activities are translated into e.g. a number, new\ncontext and new forms of subjectivity are typically added as different actors try to render such\ninformation meaningful and act upon it.\nTaken together then, the identification of four different uncertainties related to the performative\ntechnologies as such problematize the view of performative technologies as producing `generic'\ninformation whose content is `pre-determined' and determines the success of individual teachers\nand schools. The reason is, we argue, that it is not the performative technologies per se that make\ncertain things stand out and count, while others are obscured. Rather, what comes to count is typi-\ncally constituted in and through the complex and ongoing social processes whereby elusive phe-\nnomena such as teaching quality are transformed from matter to form (e.g. by representing actual\nteaching activities in and through a number of survey questions) and back again (e.g. through being\nrewarded with a salary increase due to such survey results). Processes that are largely in the hands\nof other actors than the teachers themselves, but still, have to be (cognitively) dealt with by the\nindividual teachers if they want to, for example, be promoted or receive a pay rise. Arguably, such\npredicaments may also help explain why teachers (such as those at Fungor) perceive that performa-\ntive technologies add to rather than reduce issues of subjectivity and complexity despite their\nseemingly objective and neutral character.\nA second contribution relates to how and why performative technologies tend to bring about\ncertain types of teacher identities. Again, in the extant literature much has been written about how\neducational reforms underpinned by neo-liberal values tend to bring about a new type of teacher\nidentity; the performative teacher. A teacher that is valued not because of her beliefs, principles, or\nmoral compass, but because of her performances and the outputs she can produce (Ball, 2003: 223;\nsee also Woods and Jeffrey, 2002). A teacher that derives a sense of self less from what she does\nand more from the results that she achieves (cf. Gendron, 2008). But also, a teacher that struggles\nwith feelings of inauthenticity and meaninglessness (Ball, 2003; Wilkins, 2011). According to\nprevious writings, such feelings are typically premised on the `clash'that teachers are said to expe-\nrience when squeezed between the neo-liberal values underpinning performative technologies and\nthe values traditionally associated with the teacher profession (whether professional autonomy and\njudgement or more progressively inspired values such as holism, person-centeredness, caring\nrelationships, etc.). Or more precisely, when teachers experience such a clash, and feel that they are\nunable to resist the `ideological assault'that performative technologies exert on the very nature and\nprimary intent of school education (Tang, 2011), it is suggested that they will start to question their\nown practices (Ball and Olmedo, 2013) and the existential meaning of what they do (cf. Knights\nIndeed, our findings also illustrate how performative technologies may invoke feelings of anxi-\nety and insecurity. Interestingly though, in our case, the mechanism of these feelings was not to be\nfound in a clash between neo-liberal and professional values, but rather in the tensions produced\nby performance evaluation uncertainties. Or more precisely, in the tensions that arose when teach-\ners wanted to perform well, and hence, be perceived as performers, but became genuinely uncer-\ntain as to how, when, and/or why they did (not) do so because of the uncertainties surrounding the\nperformative technologies per se. Again, it was not the case that teachers at Fungor opposed the\nextensive use of classroom observations, pupil surveys or individual pay per se. Neither did they\nseem to oppose the ideological underpinnings of such technologies; they rather cherished them.\nWhat did invoke feelings of anxiety and insecurity though, was the different types of uncertainties\nsurrounding them, as such uncertainties made them struggle as to what it really meant to perform.\nIn contrast to previous literature then, this finding suggests that existential struggles and the indi-\nvidual's `care of the self', do not have to be grounded in cognitive conflicts and perceived contra-\ndictions between traditional teacher values and performative technologies (cf. Ball and Olmedo,\n2013; Liew, 2012). Rather, they may just as well be grounded in the tensions produced when\nindividual teachers on the one hand value something, and hence, want to experience and/or achieve\nthat (e.g. to be perceived as performers), and on the other hand, experience that the extent to which\nthey achieve that is reflected and recognized by performative technologies in highly uncertain\nways.\nA third and final contribution relates to the notion of teachers as struggling performers. Again,\nthe existing identity-oriented literature has provided many valuable insights into the type of teacher\nidentity that an increased reliance on performative technologies in the educational sector may be\nexpected to bring about. For example, Ball (2003) and others (see e.g. Jeffrey, 2002, Jeffrey and\ndiscourse produces a new kind of teacher: `a teacher who can maximize performance, who can set\naside irrelevant principles, or outmoded social commitments, for whom excellence and improve-\nImportantly though, as suggested above, this new kind of teacher identity has been identified\nand studied largely in contrast to alternative teacher identities. For example, Jeffrey (2002: 532)\ncontrasted the performative teacher discourse with one emphasizing `a set of values centred around\nholism, person-centeredness, and warm and caring relationships' (see also Woods and Jeffrey,\n`set aside personal beliefs and commitments and live an existence of calculation'. In a similar man-\nner, Troman (2008) showed how values of holism, humanism, and vocationalism have been chal-\nlenged by a new teacher identity; an identity which is more managerial as the responsibilities and\naccountabilities of individual teachers are transformed. From such a perspective, focus has been on\nidentifying and contrasting particular identity qualities (cf. Table 1), and also, on discussing how\nthe new `assigned' performative identity may (and should) be met by coping strategies, resistance,\nYet, what is less clear in the existing literature is what happens when teachers have already\ndeveloped performative identities and go `all in' in their attempts to secure a sense of self as per-\nformers. That is, when they actually identify with notions of aspiration and improvement; when\nthey see themselves as workable objects that need to be continuously improved. As a first step\ntowards remedying this, this study develops the notion of a struggling performer. A notion that\nfocuses not so much on the development of a new identity in contrast to a more traditional teacher\nidentity, but on the ongoing and intentional reproduction of a performative identity in the presence\nof thoroughgoing performance evaluation uncertainties. A notion that acknowledges that uncer-\ntainties associated with performative technologies as such may not only bring about a resistant self\n(Collinson, 2003) or a `cynical compliant' (Ball, 2003), but also someone who embraces the per-\nformative technologies and their ideological underpinnings, but struggles as to what it means to\nconform. And, not least, a notion that may help remedy some of the concerns raised by Mockler\nreforms tend to bring us further and further away `from an appreciation and understanding of com-\nplexity and uncertainty' in the educational sector. Indeed, while the notion of a struggling per-\nformer is also an example of `what works is what counts', it provides important insights into some\nof the complexities and uncertainties that teachers have to deal with in order to actually `make it\nwork', even in a performative school culture.\nConclusions\nA key conclusion of this study is that although teachers may be largely colonized by the regimes of\nperformativity, such a colonization does not necessarily lead to a clear-cut and secure performative\nidentity. Rather, despite a deep desire to perform, teachers may come to struggle over what it really\nmeans to perform; a struggle that our analysis suggests is traceable to the tensions produced by\ndifferent types of performance evaluation uncertainties. Such tensions, in turn, tend to induce, and/\nor enforce, individuals' reflections on what it means to perform (i.e. what is important?), how to\nachieve a particular performance level (i.e. how should I go about in order to reach what is impor-\ntant?), and what an acceptable performance level is (i.e. what is `good enough'?).\nIndeed, we certainly acknowledge that our findings are limited to a school strongly character-\nized by a performance culture, which is possibly a prerequisite of the struggling performers that we\nidentify. However, as performance technologies and commensurate cultures tend to be diffused\nacross school systems at a local and global level, our findings should be relevant also for under-\nstanding what it means to be a professional more generally in a contemporary expanding context\nof individual performance evaluation.\nBased on this, we suggest that future research should more than is typically the case today take\nan interest in the performative technologies as such, and acknowledge the complexities and uncer-\ntainties that arguably characterize them. In particular, we suggest that future research needs to\n`unpack' the rather monolithic concepts of neo-liberal reforms and performative technologies, so\nthat the characteristics and (identity) effects of individual technologies, instruments, and ideas may\nbe further scrutinized. Arguably, the identified performance evaluation uncertainties and the notion\nof a struggling performer may constitute a useful basis for such further scholarly efforts.\n"
