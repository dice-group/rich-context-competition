Up-to-date reference intervals on\nbiomarkers and dietary intake inform the scientific and public health policy communities on current status\nand trends over time.\nThe main purpose of dietary assessment methods such as the food-frequency questionnaire, food record\n(or diary), and 24-hr dietary recall is to estimate intake of nutrients and, together with supplement usage\ninformation, describe total intake of various foods or nutrients. As with all self-reporting methods, these tools\nare challenging to use and interpret. Yet, they are needed to establish dietary reference intake recommenda-\ntions and to evaluate what proportion of the population meets these recommendations. While biomarkers are\ngenerally expensive and, to some degree, invasive, there is no question as to their ability to assess nutrition\nstatus. In some cases biomarkers can also be used to assess intake or function, although rarely can one\nbiomarker fulfill all these purposes. For example, serum folate is a good indicator of folate intake, red blood\ncell (RBC) folate is a good status indicator, and plasma total homocysteine is a good functional indicator\nof one-carbon metabolism.\nUsing folate and vitamin D \u00c1 two vitamins that are currently hotly debated in the public health arena \u00c1 as\ntwo case studies, we discuss the complexities of using biomarkers and total intake information to assess\nnutrition status. These two examples also show how biomarkers and intake provide different information and\nhow both are needed to evaluate and set public health policy. We also provide guidance on general\nrequirements for using nutrition biomarkers and food and supplement intake information in longitudinal,\npopulation-based surveys.\n",

NHANES is unique in that it combines\nhome interviews with health tests performed in a Mobile\nExamination Center (MEC), where biologic specimens\nare also collected for biochemical analyses.\nMeasuring biomarkers and assessing food and supple-\nment intake are the two main tools used to assess\nthe vitamin status of a population. Because each tool\nhas advantages and disadvantages, frequently they are\nperformed together for better interpretation. Aside from\nevaluating inadequate or excess vitamin intake levels and\nthe relation between vitamin status and health outcomes,\nthis information can potentially assist in the following\npublic health activities:\n1. Establishing and improving existing population\nreference intervals that physicians, clinicians, nutri-\ntionists, scientists, and public health officials can use\nto determine whether a person or a group of people\nhas an unusually high or low level of a biochemical\nindicator or intake.\n2. Determining whether the nutrition status of special\npopulation groups such as minorities, children,\nwomen of childbearing age, or the elderly is different\nfrom that of other groups or whether it needs\nimprovement.\n3. Tracking trends in the nutrition status of the\npopulation.\n4. Assessing the effectiveness of public health efforts to\nimprove the nutrition status of the population.\nThis article discusses the complexities of using bio-\nmarkers and total intake information to assess nutrition\nstatus and set and evaluate public health policy by using\nfolate and vitamin D as two case studies.\nMethods and materials\nBiochemical assessment to evaluate vitamin status in\nNHANES\nThe main purpose of biochemical measurements is to\nassess nutrition status generally as a sum of food in-\ntake, supplement use, bioavailability, metabolism, and\nexcretion. While field tests are available for some clinical\nparameters such as hemoglobin or glucose, nutrition\nbiomarkers generally must be analyzed in the laboratory\nusing more complex biochemical assays based on analy-\ntical principles such as chromatography, immunoassay,\nor colorimetry. Because biomarkers are not self-reported,\nthey typically correctly reflect what we believe to be\nthe nutrition status. Although biomarkers can also be\nused to directly assess intake or function, rarely can\none biomarker fulfill all of these purposes. Panels of\nbiomarkers are sometimes used for enhanced interpreta-\ntion. Limitations of biomarkers include expensive proce-\ndures and equipment and usually invasive sampling.\nTo obtain reliable results, laboratory methods must\nundergo thorough validation and their quality must be\ncontinuously assessed. One less-discussed concern is that\nbiochemical methods to assess nutrition status have\ngenerally not been standardized, which leads to problems\nwith poorly comparable data among different assays and\nlaboratories.\nIn NHANES, blood is drawn and urine is collected\nin the MEC; aliquots of these specimens are processed\nin a controlled environment following standardized\nprotocols. Specimens are stored at \u00c1208C at the MEC\nuntil the end of the week when they are shipped on dry\nice to the testing laboratories. Early attempts to use\nmultiple laboratories per test for the nutrition biomarkers\nfor fast sample turn-around resulted in problems of\nnon-comparability of data. A central laboratory using\nreference analytical methods was therefore established\nallowed for consistent, coordinated, and high-quality\nbiomarker measurements. The concept of a central\nlaboratory \u00c1 at least for medium and high complexity\ntesting \u00c1 is still in place today.\nThe `National Report on Biochemical Indicators of\nthe most comprehensive and current source of reference\ninterval tables for 27 nutrition biomarkers in the US\npopulation (3). The CDC's National Center for Environ-\nmental Health (NCEH), plans to release periodic updates\nof this report. The next report, scheduled to be released\nDietary assessment to evaluate vitamin status in large\npopulation surveys\nThe purpose of dietary assessment methods is to evaluate\nintake of foods or nutrients and, combined with supple-\nment usage information, describe total intake of various\nnutrients. The main assessment methods are food fre-\nquency questionnaire (FFQ), 24-hr dietary recall and\nthe food record (or diary). All methods have strengths\nand weaknesses; the method selected should be depen-\ndent on the research question. These methods are\nrelatively easy and inexpensive (with the possible excep-\ntion of the 24-hr recall) to conduct, and they have the\nadvantage of being non-invasive. Technologic advances\nin tools (interviewer, computer, Internet, cell phone) as\nwell as data processing (manual, computer, specialized\nChristine M. Pfeiffer et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nsoftware, personal digital assistants) have facilitated and\nstandardized the administration of these methods (4).\nThree main FFQs are used \u00c1 Block, Willett, and the\nNational Cancer Institute (NCI) \u00c1 and a comparative\nvalidation has been conducted (5). The two commonly\nused 24-hr recall interviewing systems are the University\nof Minnesota's Nutrition Data System for Research (6)\nand the USDA's Automated Multi-Pass Method (7). The\nNCI is developing a computer-based, 24-hr recall inter-\nviewing system that does not require specially trained\ninterviewers. However, as with all self-reporting methods,\nthese tools are challenging to use and interpret. The\nprocess of recording intake influences diet and introduces\nbias. Under-reporting is common, particularly for obese\npersons (8) and can alter relationships with both bio-\nmarkers and health outcomes. Typically, correlation\ncoefficients between nutrient intake and the biomarker\nvalue are B0.5 (9, 10). Yet, even with these shortcomings,\ninformation gained from dietary assessment methods\nis vital in establishing guidelines for dietary reference\nintakes and evaluating what proportion of the popula-\ntion meets these recommendations and who the potential\ngroups of concern are.\nfor every participant using the USDA's Automated\nMulti-Pass Method. The first 24-hr recall is conducted\nat the MEC; the second is conducted by telephone 3\u00c110\ndays later. Also since 2002, NHANES uses either small,\ntargeted FFQs or an NCI-developed FFQ (11). The\nNHANES FFQ, formerly called Food Propensity Ques-\ntionnaire, is mailed to all participants aged 2 and older\nwho completed at least one 24-hr recall. It collects much\nof the same information as the Block or Willet FFQ\nbut does not ask about portion size, thereby minimizing\nrespondent burden. As suggested in the NHANES Diet-\nary Tutorial (12), the FFQ data were not intended to\nbe used directly for nutrient intake estimation, but rather\nas covariates when estimating usual dietary intakes from\nthe 24-hr recalls. Generally, day-to-day variation in in-\ntake for an individual is greater than person-to-person\nvariation within a population. To avoid this excessive\nintra-individual variation, which can lead to serious\nproblems in data interpretation, NCI has developed a\nstatistical modeling method to estimate usual dietary\nintakes representing a more accurate average daily intake\nof a nutrient or food and thereby being more reflective\nof long-term exposure (13). It requires the availability of\ndata from one or more non-consecutive, 24-hr recalls or\nfood records for a representative sample of persons from\nthe population of interest.\n`What We Eat in America' (WWEIA) is a report\ncontaining data from the dietary intake interview com-\nponent of NHANES (14). It is an integration of two\nnationwide surveys, the US Department of Agricul-\nture's (USDA) Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by\nIndividuals (CSFII) and NCHS's NHANES. The two\nsurveys were integrated in 2002. NCHS is responsible for\nsample design and data collection; USDA is responsible\nfor dietary data-collection methods, maintenance of the\ndatabases used to code and process the data, and data\nreview and processing. The USDA Food and Nutrient\nDatabases for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) is a resource\nthat is used to code dietary intakes and to calculate\nnutrients for WWEIA (15). The FNDDS is based on\nnutrient values in the USDA National Nutrient Database\nfor Standard Reference, the most recent release of which\ncycle, WWEIA generates two dietary intake data files.\nThe individual foods file contains one record per food\nfor each survey participant for each 24-hr dietary recall.\nIt provides information on the estimated nutrient con-\nsumption, when and where the food was eaten, and\nthe amount of food eaten. The total nutrient intakes file\ncontains one record per day for each survey participant\nfor each 24-hr dietary recall. It provides information on\ndaily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily\nintake of water, and whether the intake was typical for\nthe participant.\nTo assess supplement usage in NHANES, the inter-\nviewer completes a household dietary supplement ques-\ntionnaire with information provided by the participant.\nThis questionnaire captures dietary supplement use over\nthe past 30 days, listing the name and type of the\nsupplement, frequency of use, duration of use, and amount\ntaken. Since 2007, during the MEC visit, the participant\nhas been asked about supplement use on the previous\nday; this information can be matched with the 24-hr\ndietary recall. An average daily intake of dietary supple-\nments can be calculated from the information collected\nat the home of the participant.\nResults and discussion\nCase study one \u00c1 assessment of folate status in NHANES\nIn 1996, the FDA mandated that enriched grain products\nthe risk of neural-tube defects (NTD) in newborns (17).\nThis regulation became effective January 1998. Folic acid\nfortification provides an excellent account of the various\npieces of information that were needed to implement\nsuch a public health policy (18). To establish the need\nfor folic acid fortification, a determination had to be\nmade that: (1) the total folate intake (foods and supple-\nments) was low, (2) the prevalence of folate deficiency as\nassessed through biomarkers was high, (3) a significant\nnumber of folate-preventable NTDs were present, and\n(4) alternative strategies to increase folate intake were\nnot promising. Benefits and risks of fortification had\nto be weighed. The folic acid fortification amount had to\nbe determined through modeling by identifying target\nBiomarkers and dietary intake to assess vitamin status\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nfoods for fortification, assessing the frequency and\namounts of the target foods consumed by various\npopulation groups, and using dose-response information\nfrom intervention trials to estimate the expected increase\nin biologic response.\nNHANES has monitored folate status through bio-\nchemical measurements and dietary intake assessment\nboth pre- and post-fortification and has therefore been\nan excellent tool to assess the impact of the US folic\nacid fortification program.\nBiochemical assessment of folate status\nSerum folate, red blood cell (RBC) folate, and plasma\ntotal homocysteine (tHcy) are the three most commonly\nused biochemical indicators to assess folate status (19).\nSerum folate is indicative of recent folate intake and\nshort-term status, while RBC folate better indicates folate\nstores and long-term status. Plasma tHcy is responsive to\nchanges in folate intake, but it is mainly considered a\ngood functional indicator of B-vitamin status; plasma\ntHcy is elevated as a result of low folate, vitamin B2, B6,\nMeasurements of serum and RBC folate levels among\na full set of participants were part of NHANES III\nintroduction of the continuous NHANES survey in 1999\n(20). The same BioRad Quanta Phase II radioassay was\nversion of the assay, the Quanta Phase I radioassay,\nadjusted for the method differences between the two\nassays prior to release (21).\nMeasurements of plasma tHcy levels by the Abbott\nfluorescence polarization immunoassay among a full\n(22). Because optimally prepared EDTA plasma was not\navailable during NHANES III, tHcy levels were analyzed\nby HPLC in surplus serum from phase II of NHANES\nassess the change in matrix and methods were conducted\nBefore implementing folate fortification, FDA intake\nmodeling estimated that consumers with low folate intake\nwould increase their folate intake by 80\u00c1100 mg per day\n(25). Short-term folic acid supplementation trials showed\nthat serum folate levels increased by approximately\nacid intake (26). No information was available on the\nmagnitude of changes in serum folate levels as a result\nof continuous daily exposure to folic acid from fortified\nfood products. By applying the same laboratory method\n(BioRad radioassay) \u00c1 held to strict quality assurance\nrequirements to ensure comparability of data over time \u00c1\nto post-fortification blood samples as had been used\nwith pre-fortification samples, we showed that folate\nstatus has greatly improved in the entire US population\nas well as in the target group of women of childbearing\nfrom pre- to post-fortification was however, much larger\nthan expected from short-term folic acid supplementation\ntrials \u00c1 they nearly tripled. This demonstrates the value\nof biomonitoring; it reflects the net effect of many\nuncertainties surrounding public health decisions such\nas fortification (i.e. under-reporting of foods consumed,\nincreased consumer selection of folate-rich foods because\nof health claims, and increasing availability of the\nnumbers and types of folate-fortified, non-standardized\nfoods).\nShort-term folic acid supplementation trials showed\nthat RBC folate levels increased by \u00c210% in response\nto a 100 mg per day increase in folic acid intake (28). In\npre- to post-fortification NHANES, RBC folate levels\nincreased much more than expected from short-term folic\nacid supplementation trials \u00c1 they nearly doubled\n(27). The prevalence of low RBC folate levels in women\nof childbearing age decreased from \u00c240% pre-fortifica-\ntion to \u00c25% post-fortification and stabilized between\nAs would be expected from the inverse relationship\nbetween folate and tHcy, elevated tHcy levels have\ndecreased from pre- to post-fortification in older men\nIn 2007, the manufacturer discontinued the BioRad\nfolate radioassay. Because continued monitoring of folate\nstatus through NHANES was still necessary, the tradi-\ntional microbiologic growth assay (MA) using Lactoba-\ncillus casei \u00c1 used by some countries in their national\nnutrition surveys for population monitoring \u00c1 was\nselected to measure folate levels in serum and RBCs in\nthe US population for 2007 and thereafter. More recently,\nafter input from a 2010 roundtable of folate experts,\nCDC decided that liquid chromatography coupled to\nMedian serum folate (nmol/L)\nYear\nPersons 4 years of age and older\nFig. 1.

Pfeiffer et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\ntandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) should be used\nto continue monitoring serum folate for NHANES 2011\nand thereafter. This assay measures individual folate\nforms, in particular, unmetabolized folic acid, which is\nunder investigation for potential health effects because it\nis not a physiological form of folate.\nTotal intake assessment of folate status\nThe various sources of folate intake are foods (which\ncontain mainly reduced folate forms), fortified foods\nsuch as enriched grain products and ready-to-eat cereals\n(which contain added folic acid in addition to natural\nreduced folate forms), and dietary supplements (which\ncontain folic acid only). Due to the increased bioavail-\nability of folic acid compared with food folate, one\ndietary folate equivalent (DFE) has been defined as\nequivalent to 1 mg of food folate, 0.6 mg of folic acid\nfrom fortified food, 0.6 mg of folic acid from a supplement\ntaken with food, or 0.5 mg of folic acid on an empty\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of DFEs\nfor adult men and women is 400 mg per day, while the\nestimated average requirement (EAR) of DFEs is 320 mg\nper day (18). The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for\nadults is set at 1,000 mg per day of folate from fortified\nfood or as a supplement (i.e. folic acid), exclusive of\nfood folate (19). To reduce the risk of NTDs among\nnewborns, the Public Health Service recommends that\nwomen capable of becoming pregnant take 400 mg of folic\nacid daily from fortified foods, supplements, or both, in\naddition to consuming food folate from a varied diet (29).\nA study was conducted (30) to assess changes in folate\nfortification, the category `bread, rolls, and crackers'\nbecame the single largest contributor of total folate to\nthe American diet (15.6% of total intake), surpassing\nvegetables, which were the number one folate food source\nbefore fortification. The population's mean total folate\nHowever, at the time, the dietary folate data in the\nNHANES nutrient database were reported as total folate\nintake (food folate'folic acid from fortification) in\nmicrograms per day not as DFE and intake was, there-\nfore, underestimated.\n2002) total folic acid intake in women of childbearing age.\nThe study found that no race/ethnic group consumed the\n400 mg of folic acid daily from fortified food, supple-\nments, or both as recommended by the Public Health\nService for women capable of becoming pregnant (29).\nThe average estimated daily total folic acid intake was\n221 mg; however, this represents an underestimation of\n\u00c210% because a second 24-hr dietary recall was not\nintakes.\nA study was conducted (32) to assess post-fortification\npopulation in a data set where two 24-hr dietary recalls\nwere available and usual intakes were calculated. While\nthe average total folate intakes (diet'supplements) for\nvarious age groups of adults 19 years and older were\nhad a folate intake below the EAR. A large portion of\nthe total folate intake was provided by diet only (includ-\n653 DFE for men. The average total folic acid intakes\nof men exceeded the UL for adults.\nA recent report (33) assessed the post-fortification\ntion of the entire population that exceeded the UL.\nThe study found that 2.7% of the total US popula-\ntion exceeded the UL for folic acid. Some participants\nexceeded the UL, but only if the source of folic acid\nwas supplements in addition to enriched grain products\nand ready-to-eat cereals (5.5 and 9.4%, respectively). Of\nthe supplement users, \u00c21% exceeded the UL if the\nexceeded the UL if the amount of supplement was !400\nmg per day.\nSummary of biochemical and dietary assessment of folate\nstatus\nThe NHANES blood-biomarker levels have responded\nas expected \u00c1 serum and RBC folate have increased and\nplasma tHcy has decreased \u00c1 but the magnitude of change\nwas larger than anticipated from small-scale intervention\nstudies.

However, folate\nintake is still below the EAR for a small portion of\nPercent\nYear\nTotal Non-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black Mexican American\nFig. 2.

Only a small fraction of adults who\nconsume supplements exceed the UL of folic acid. One\nissue in examining the relationship between biomarker\ndata and dietary assessment data is that they sometimes\nreflect differential time periods. For example, we adjust\nthe nutrient intakes reported in the 24-hr recall to reflect\nlong-term exposure and, therefore, they may be more\ncomparable to status assessed by RBC folate than by\nserum folate. The folate case study also shows how\neach data source, biomarkers, and questionnaires, pro-\nvides valuable information on its own. Public health\nofficials need both types of information \u00c1 in addition\nto knowing how NTD rates have changed over time \u00c1\nto judge whether fortification has achieved the desired\nimpact in the group of interest without exposing other\npopulation groups to excessive amounts of folic acid.\nBiomarker levels of folate status are associated with\na number of health outcomes beyond NTDs \u00c1 from\nanemia to various chronic disease conditions \u00c1 that are\ncurrently under investigation. The ability to integrate\nintake information with biomarker information in a\nlarge population survey such as NHANES opens the\ndoor to exploratory research and hypothesis generation\nfor future targeted nutrition and health studies.\nCase study two \u00c1 assessment of vitamin D status in\nNHANES\nVitamin D is one of the most talked about nutrients\ntoday in the United States as well as worldwide. In recent\nyears, low vitamin D blood levels have been associated\nwith increased risk for numerous health outcomes beyond\nrisk for rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.\nSome of these health outcomes include various cancers,\ncardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions (such as\nmultiple sclerosis), dementia, diabetes, and glucose intol-\nerance (34). At the same time, excessive amounts of\nvitamin D in blood can become toxic and produce a\nvariety of health problems (35). Therefore, both excessive\nand deficient levels of vitamin D are important. While\nthere is no unanimity with respect to vitamin D and\nvarious health outcomes, we have an obvious need to\nknow the vitamin D status of the US population and\nwhether it has changed over time. It is also important to\nknow how much of the population's diet is contributing\nto vitamin D status, what foods provide the most vitamin\nD to the population, and whether dietary supplements\nprovide a significant amount of vitamin D to the\npopulation taking them. Finally, the scientific and public\npolicy community need to know how much vitamin D\nwe need and how much is too much. NHANES has\nbeen providing answers to some of these questions since\nNHANES III, although much needed improvements in\nthe USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard\nReference of foods containing vitamin D (36) were only\nrecently made available with SR22. NHANES does\nnot provide direct information about participants' sun\nexposure, which catalyzes cutaneous synthesis of vitamin\nD. As endogenously synthesized vitamin D3 is a sig-\nnificant source for most persons, this unusual informa-\ntion gap makes biomarker measurements even more\nimportant to assess the vitamin D status of the US\npopulation.\nBiochemical assessment of vitamin D status\nSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are\ngenerally considered the best indicator of vitamin D\nstatus (35). The DiaSorin radioassay was used to assess\ncontinuous NHANES starting in 2000 through the\nintroduced an assay reformulation in the late 1990s that\nrequired us to bridge the gap between data obtained\nby using two versions of the assay to allow the interpreta-\ntion of trends over time (37). Specifically, the change\nfrom the original to the reformulated assay produced\nThe observed age-standardized 25(OH)D means were\n10\u00c118 nmol/L higher in NHANES III (black bars), in\nMen Women\nMen Women\nnmol/L\nA\nnmol/L\nB\nFig. 3.

Pfeiffer et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nwhich the original DiaSorin assay was used, than in\nmulated assay was used (Fig. 3, Panel A). When the\nNHANES III values were adjusted for the change in assay,\nthe difference in age-standardized means between surveys\n(Fig. 3, Panel B). This means that a large portion of\nthe previous difference between these two surveys was\nattributable to changes from the original to the reformu-\nlated assay and not to the real difference in population\nlevels of 25(OH)D. A smaller portion of the previous\ndifference between these two surveys was attributable to\naltered behavior, specifically an increase in body mass\nindex, decrease in sun exposure, or decrease in milk\nconsumption (data not shown) (38).\nDue to some shortcomings of the immunoassay\nmethodology for measuring 25(OH)D, after input from\na roundtable of vitamin D experts, CDC decided that LC-\nMS/MS should be used for NHANES 2007 and there-\nafter (37). This assay measures the individual 25(OH)D\nforms and has been standardized to the higher-order\nreference methodology developed by the National In-\nstitute of Standards and Technology.\nA second important issue with vitamin D is that\nthe experts disagree on the most appropriate 25(OH)D\nof B27.5 nmol/L has been used in the United States to\ndefine deficiency status for vitamin D (35). This cutpoint\nwas associated with increased risk of rickets and osteo-\nmalacia. In recent years, other cutpoints (i.e. 50 nmol/L\nand 80 nmol/L) have been proposed by members of the\nresearch community as more appropriate for `inadequate'\nor `at risk' levels, especially for other public health\nuated the evidence for cutpoints and concluded that\nduals at risk for deficiency and inadequacy, respectively.\nThe prevalence of deficiency at the cutpoint of 27.5\nnmol/L, a value that is close to 30 nmol/L, is B6% for all\n(39). The cutpoint of 50 nmol/L produces combined\nprevalences of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy of\n\u00c230% for the various population age groups. Differences\namong race/ethnic groups in the prevalence of low levels\nof serum 25(OH)D have also been found, but the\nmeaning of these differences is unclear (39). African\nAmericans have reduced rates of fracture and osteoporo-\nsis compared with Whites despite reduced cutaneous\nsynthesis of vitamin D and lower 25(OH)D levels\nthroughout life (40).\nTotal intake assessment of vitamin D status\nWith respect to vitamin D intake from foods and dietary\nsupplements, the primary questions are: `Is intake\nadequate?' and `What are the groups of concern?' Based\nD is 600 international units (IU) for those between 1 and\nThe EAR for vitamin D is 400 IU per day for persons\n1 year and older and adequate intake (AI) is 400 IU\nper day for infants.

This is especially the\ncase for men !50 years (Fig. 5). In those age groups,\nonly 24\u00c136% meet the old AI recommendations and\ndietary supplements are a significant source of vitamin D\nyears and nearly all of the intake in those older than\n70 years. For females, with the exception of 14- to\n18-year-old women, the pattern for total intake is similar\nFig. 4.

Fewer than\nadequate intakes based on the older guidelines. For\nwomen aged ]14 years, dietary supplements contribute\nsignificantly to total vitamin D intake.

However,\nwhen setting these recommendations, the IOM pointed\nout that reported intakes are expected to be under-\nestimations of actual intakes (40).\nSummary of biochemical and total intake assessment of\nvitamin D status\nNHANES is a valuable source of information on vitamin\nD. Based on the previous IOM criteria, about 50%\nof adults, but fewer than one-third of older people,\nmeet the recommended AI for vitamin D based on total\nintake. A new analysis is needed to assess what propor-\ntion of the population meets the currently recommended\nIOM intake criteria. Less than 10% of the US population\nhave 25(OH)D levels that are generally considered\ndeficient. The IOM evaluated the correlation of serum\nlevels with inadequacy and the congruence of the data\nsupport 25(OH)D levels below 30 nmol/L with undesir-\nable bone health outcomes (39); however, methodologic\nissues contribute uncertainty to this cutoff. The two\nways to assess vitamin D status in the US population\nthrough intake and blood levels are not leading to the\nsame conclusion. This is partially expected because sun\nexposure can be a significant contributor to vitamin\nD status and circulating 25(OH)D levels in addition\nto intake. These challenges in interpretation show how\nimportant it is to have access to both intake and\nbiomarker data. Furthermore, the vitamin D case study\nshows the impact of methodologic issues, i.e. reformula-\ntions in laboratory methods, on the interpretation of\ntrends in status over time.\nConclusions\nThe following is guidance on general requirements for\nmonitoring nutrition status in large population studies\nand is derived from decades of NHANES experience.\n1. The imprecision of the intake assessment method\nor biomarker assay should be low enough to enable\ndetection of small trends. Due to the relatively\nlarge sample size of NHANES, small changes in\npopulation means can be easily detected. Fluctua-\ntions in the mean as a result of an imprecise assay\ncan be mistaken for changes in population values.\n2. The robustness of the intake assessment method\nor biomarker assay should be high enough to\nensure comparability of data over time. As noted\npreviously, fluctuations of the assay can be mistaken\nfor changes in population values.\n3. Development of a comprehensive and accurate\nfood-composition database is key to assessment of\ndietary intake in the US population in NHANES.\nLack of a complete and reliable database hindered\ndietary intake studies, including those needed to set\ndietary reference intakes.\n4. Improvements in web-based software are needed\nto enable automated and self-administered 24-hr\ndietary recalls to be cost-effectively employed multi-\nple times.\n5. Use of one laboratory per test and preferably a\ncentral laboratory for the medium and high com-\nplexity testing helps to ensure consistent quality and\ncomparability of data over time.\n6. Use of kit biomarker assays for longitudinal studies\nmay be problematic. To provide valid results, kit\nassays must be performed exactly as prescribed by the\nmanufacturer, which rules out alteration of condi-\ntions to troubleshoot problems or improve the assay.\nFurthermore, re-calibration or refinement of the\nassay by the manufacturer cannot be ruled out and\nmakes interpretation of long-term trends difficult.\n7. Laboratory-developed biomarker tests are preferred,\nparticularly when the measurement of the analyte\nhas not yet been standardized, to allow in-house\ncontrol over assay calibration and troubleshooting.\n8. Whenever possible, using the same intake assess-\nment method or biomarker assay is desirable to\nfacilitate the comparability of data over time.\n9. Often, changing procedures, either by choice (technol-\nogy advances) or external stipulation (manufacturer\nphases out or reformulates assay) is unavoidable. A\nwell-designed cross-over study is needed to enable data\ncomparison over time.\n10. Internal quality control, regular assay verifications,\nand external quality assurance are essential to ensure\nand document technical proficiency of the labora-\ntory and the performance of the biomarker assay\nover time.\n11. Reference materials should be used regularly, when\navailable, to assess the bias of the biomarker assay\nand document consistent performance over time.\n12. The traceability of the biomarker assay to a higher-\norder reference method is desirable because it is an\nimportant step to assay standardization and making\nlaboratory data comparable.\nChristine M. Pfeiffer et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nTo effectively formulate and later evaluate nutrition\npolicy, many data pieces are needed. The following list\nis by no means all inclusive:\n1. Nutrition biomarker data \u00c1 when possible, multiple\nbiomarkers should be assessed to facilitate inter-\npretation of the data.\n2. Dietary intake data \u00c1 data available should allow\nestimation of usual intakes to minimize intra-\nindividual variation.\n3. Supplement usage information \u00c1 to allow a separate\nassessment of nutrient sources.\n4. Demographic characteristics \u00c1 to describe the nutri-\ntional status of the population by relevant subpo-\npulations.\n5. Behavioral factors \u00c1 to explain differences seen in\nnutritional status.\n6. Health indicators \u00c1 to study associations between\nnutritional status and health.\n7. Sample various population groups \u00c1 to assess\nwhether special groups of interest may have addi-\ntional nutritional needs.\n8. Monitoring over multiple years \u00c1 to allow analysis\nof time trends.\nMethods to assess nutrition status continually evolve;\nassays to measure biomarkers as well as dietary assess-\nment methods are subject to constant change and\nimprovement. As a result, a comprehensive quality-\nassessment system should be implemented at the onset\nof the survey to ensure meaningful data interpretation\nlater. Utilization of combinations of biomarkers and\ndietary questionnaire information helps to better under-\nstand nutrition effects in relation to disease occurrence.\nConflict of interest and funding\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those\nof the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nofficial views or positions of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention/Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry, the National Institutes of Health, or\nthe Department of Health and Human Services.
