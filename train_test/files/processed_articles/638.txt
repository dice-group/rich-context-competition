For both\nmen and women, participation rates tend to drop\nfaster among blacks than among whites as workers\nIt seems plausible that health limitations on men's\nand women's capacities for work are important for\nunderstanding these patterns. Black men and women\nare substantially more likely to identify themselves as\nphysically unable to work; in absolute terms, the\nTraction of all men and women reporting themselves\nunable to work rises with age, and the gap between\nwhites and blacks increases dramatically with age.\nThe differences in the proportion of older, working-\n1 Helpful comments were provided by Neal Krause and the participants at\nthe Minority Perspectives on the Health and Retirement Survey workshop.\nCindy Clovinsky and Mary Claire Toomey provided editorial assistance.\nThis research was supported in part by a grant funded by the National\nInstitute on Aging, with supplementary funding provided by the Social\nSecurity Administration and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evalua-\ntion at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Similar calculations for women suggest\nthat, were black women in their 40s and 50s to experi-\nence work limitation rates similar to those of white\nwomen in these age ranges, they would continue to\nshow a greater attachment to the work force.\nThe fact that more blacks than whites report that\nthey are limited in their ability to work, or are unable\nto work at all, presumably reflects differences in\nhealth to a considerable extent. We know that the\nhealth of middle-aged blacks is worse than that of\nmiddle-aged whites and that this difference widens\nthrough middle age (Geronimus, 1992; House et al.,\nlikely as whites to report suffering from diabetes,\nhypertension, and arthritis (Manton, Patrick, & John-\nclinical evidence suggests that, relative to whites,\nblacks have higher rates of undiagnosed diabetes\nand roughly the same rate of undiagnosed hyperten-\nsion (Andersen, Mullner, & Cornelius, 1987). In addi-\ntion, death rates are higher for blacks at most ages\nand for nearly all causes.\nAt the same time, since disabilities reflect a gap\nbetween an individual's capacity and the demands of\nan activity (Pope &Tarlov, 1991), the difference in the\nfractions of blacks and whites identifying themselves\nas limited in their capacity to work could be due, in\npart, to differences in the nature of the jobs typically\nheld by older black and white adults, respectively.\nFor instance, we know that blacks tend to be dispro-\nportionately concentrated in physically strenuous\njobs (Park, Wagener, Winn, & Pierce, 1993). It seems\nplausible that a given health problem is more likely to\nbe disabling for workers in such jobs.\nBecause much, although not all, of the evidence\nthat black/white differences in disability rates can\naccount for differences in labor force participation\nrates relies on self-reports of disability status, we\ncannot rule out the possibility that this association\nstems from factors that affect the propensity of\nblacks versus whites to report themselves as dis-\nabled. Economists have noted that the pecuniary\nrewards for continued work are smaller for blacks\nthan for whites while employment opportunities are\nworse. These economic factors may provide incen-\ntives for able-bodied blacks to report themselves as\ndisabled (Parsons, 1980) or for blacks with disabilities\nto adjust their labor force behavior to accommodate\nthose disabilities at earlier ages than they might if the\nrewards of continued labor force participation were\ngreater (Bound & Waidmann, 1992). From a different\nperspective, social psychologists have observed that\namong those outside the labor force, blacks are\nmore likely to report themselves as disabled while\nwhites are more likely to report themselves as re-\ntired. They argue that reporting differences may be\nconditioned by differences in role identification or in\nthe extent to which work is seen as central to the\nidentities of whites versus blacks (Gibson, 1988,\nThis study uses the first wave (beta release) of the\nHealth and Retirement Survey (HRS; Juster & Suz-\nman, 1995) to examine patterns of labor force partici-\npation among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic\nwhite adults in their 50s, with particular emphasis on\nblack/white differences in health. The extensive and\nvaried health measures available in the HRS allow us\nto resolve some of the ambiguities regarding the\ninterpretation of self-reported work disability. Until\nrecently, nationally representative survey data were\nnot available that contained both the detailed health\ninformation and detailed labor force and economic\ninformation necessary to disentangle the various in-\nfluences on work disability. Rather than relying on a\nsingle measure of the complex concept of work dis-\nability, we are able to use more specific measures of\nhealth (chronic condition prevalence and activity\nlimitation).\nSpecifically, we examine the extent to which black/\nwhite differences in labor force status are associated\nwith black/white differences in health and socioeco-\nnomic characteristics. For men, we hypothesize that\na significant part of observed race differences in\nlabor force behavior between blacks and whites can\nbe accounted for by actual health differences be-\ntween these two populations. For women, we hy-\npothesize that black women's labor force participa-\ntion rates would be above those of white women in\nthe absence of real health differences between these\ngroups. Finally, given the different social and eco-\nnomic circumstances faced by middle-aged black\nand white men and women, we hypothesize that\nblacks and whites differ not just in their levels of\nhealth status, but also in the way health affects labor\nmarket participation.\nMethods\nData\nThe HRS covers a national sample of people born\nmarily covers individuals aged 51-61 (although some\nrespondents are aged 50 or 62). The HRS contains\ninformation on many of the forces thought to influ-\nence labor market behavior, including extensive\nmeasures of health status and functional ability (at\nleast for a labor force survey), income, assets, pen-\nsion coverage, demographic characteristics, and\nfamily structure. The HRS oversamples blacks, His-\npanics and residents of the State of Florida, and all\nanalyses are weighted accordingly.\nThe HRS includes the spouses/partners of the sur-\nvey population even if they themselves are out of the\nage range of the sample frame. Because respondents\nout of the sample frame do not constitute a repre-\nsentative sample, they are excluded here (although\ninformation from their records was used to identify\nhousehold characteristics where appropriate). The\ndata set is thus restricted to respondents initially in\nthe sample frame, as well as those spouses/partners\ndata have been further restricted to non-Hispanic\nwhite and non-Hispanic black respondents. In addi-\ntion, basic demographic characteristics (e.g., gen-\nder, age, or race/ethnicity) were unavailable for sev-\neral respondents, and these records were also\nexcluded. Based on these restrictions, the pool of\neligible respondents is 8,655. However, several.re-\nspondents did not respond to summary questions\nabout their health and/or disability status and were\nexcluded. The reduced data set contains 8,637 re-\nple, 37% of black and white women are out of the\nlabor force, while 29% of black men and 16% of white\nmen are out of the labor force.\nWe note that this analysis derives from economic\nmodels of retirement, in which decisions about con-\ntinued labor force participation at older ages and in\ndeteriorated states of health depend, in part, on the\nfinancial and other economic alternatives faced by\nindividuals. The Health and Retirement Survey in-\ncludes data important for modeling these alterna-\ntives, including earnings histories from Social Secu-\nrity records and details regarding the nature and\navailability of pension and health insurance cover-\nage. With only one wave of data, it is nearly impos-\nsible to model the income available to individuals\nunder several alternative scenarios (e.g., work, re-\ntirement, disability). As a result, we do not attempt to\ninclude these variables in our analysis.\nBecause there is a strong correlation between eco-\nnomic and health variables (individuals facing lower\nrewards to continued work are typically also in worse\nhealth), the fact that we cannot adequately model the\neconomic incentives facing workers has important\nimplications for the interpretation we give our esti-\nmates. In particular, our estimates should not be\nthought of as causal. Instead, they are probably best\ninterpreted as an accounting exercise: We are trying\nto gauge the extent to which measurable differences\nin capacity to work between blacks and whites can\naccount for observed differences in labor force sta-\ntus. In this framework, residual race differences in\nparticipation that remain after controlling for differ-\nences in health and demographic characteristics re-\nflect differences in economic and social constraints\non resources.\nMeasures\nLabor Force Participation. -- Consistent with the\nrest of the literature, we define labor force participa-\ntion as either working, unemployed but looking for\nwork, or temporarily laid off or on sick leave. The\nHRS also contains extensive information on a variety\nof factors that may influence labor force behavior.\nBecause participation in federal income mainte-\nnance programs targeted at the disabled often pre-\ncludes substantial labor force activity, our model of\nlabor force behavior includes measures of applica-\ntion for and participation in such programs. The\ndisability section of the HRS contains such informa-\ntion on the two largest of these programs, Social\nSecurity Disability Insurance (Dl) and Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI). Individuals who report that\nthey have a health problem that limits their capacity\nfor work are asked whether they have ever applied\nfor benefits from the Dl or SSI programs. Those who\nhave applied are asked whether or not they were\nawarded benefits.\nDemographic. --All analyses were conducted sep-\narately by sex. The multivariate models outlined here\ninclude controls for several demographic and other\nindividual characteristics, including age in years; ed-\nucational attainment, given by four categories (less\nthan a high school diploma, high school graduate,\nsome college, college graduate); whether the HRS\ninterview was conducted by a proxy respondent; and\nwhether the respondent is currently married with\nspouse present or living with a partner (a single\ndummy variable).\nHealth. --The HRS includes an extensive range of\nmeasures of self-reported health, including general\nhealth status; prevalence of 39 specific conditions;\nmeasures of physical limitation in performing 21\ndaily activities; 11 measures of mood and depression\nbased on the CES-D depression index (Radloff, 1977),\nand 3 measures of vitality. The survey also contains\nquestions necessary to construct the CAGE alcohol-\nism index (Mayfield, McLeod, & Hall, 1974). Inclu-\nsion of this index had no discernible effect on our\nresults, but high item non-response would have re-\nquired dropping several observations. Conse-\nquently, this index was not included in the results\nreported here. Because spouses were asked the\nsame health questions, it is also possible to include\nmeasures of the spouse's health, although our analy-\nsis found that this has no significant impact on labor\nforce activity after we controlled for the respon-\ndent's own health.\nWe note that there are good reasons to believe that\nsocial forces influence individuals' responses to\nhealth questionnaires (Waidmann, Bound, & Schoen-\nbaum, 1995). In particular, there is a legitimate con-\ncern that blacks and whites may respond differently\nto the kinds of questions asked in the HRS. For exam-\nple, there is some evidence that for a given level of\nactual morbidity, blacks may be less likely than whites\nto report suffering from specific chronic conditions\n(Andersen et al., 1987). In addition, although some\nstudies have found that blacks are no more likely than\nwhites to suffer from serious mental illness (Kessler et\nfinding may be influenced by the nature of the diag-\nnostic instruments used (Adebimpe, 1981; Neigh-\nbors, Jackson, Campbell, & Williams, 1989; Williams\n& Fenton, 1994). Systematic differences in reporting\nwill influence any results based on self-reported mea-\nsures of health status. To some extent, however, our\nstatistical methods may mitigate this influence.\nModeling Health\nFor our empirical models, we seek appropriate\nmeasures of health status. There are a number of\npossible alternatives for such measures. Because we\nare interested in how health affects labor market\nbehavior, the most direct method might be to use\ninformation on self-reported work limitations. How-\never, black/white differences in the prevalence of\nself-reported work limitations may reflect a number\nof different factors than health per se. Another possi-\nbility is to use individuals' reports on their overall\nhealth. However, this seems unnecessarily impre-\ncise, both because it ignores the many detailed\nhealth measures available in the HRS and because\nthe range of variation in self-rated health is limited by\nconstruction. In addition, different individuals may\nimplicitly be responding on different scales, making\nresponses difficult to compare across individuals.\nThis heterogeneity is likely to threaten inferences\nAnother alternative is to include the numerous\ndetailed health measures directly. This makes maxi-\nmal use of the available information on health status.\nIn addition, survey questions that are more specific\nand concrete should be less subjective and therefore\nless susceptible to the kinds of problems raised ear-\nlier. However, doing so presents difficulties in inter-\npretation. First, there is no obvious way to quantify\nthe marginal effect of changes in health per se on the\noutcomes of interest, and thus there is no way to\ncompare the effects of marginal changes in health for\nblacks and whites, respectively. In a sense, there are\nas many black/white differences as there are health\ncovariates. In addition, the various detailed mea-\nsures are presumably collinear to some degree (e.g.,\ndue to comorbidity), and such collinearity would\nalso complicate interpreting the estimated coeffi-\ncients on particular health measures.\nGiven these considerations, another possibility is\nto summarize the detailed health measures. The\nhealth science literature includes numerous meth-\nods for doing so, in particular for summarizing infor-\nmation on functional ability into a single measure\n(e.g., Suurmeijer et al., 1994). Other researchers\nhave summarized measures of morbidity (e.g.,\nHouse et al., 1990). The CES-D depression scale is\nincluded directly in the HRS. In general, each sum-\nmary measure represents a weighted average of a\nnumber of components, where the weighting\nscheme is derived theoretically.\nAs an alternative to these methods, we use a latent\nvariable model to construct an index of health. Spe-\ncifically, we imagine the following model:\nwhere h* represents health, a latent variable, and X is\na vector of demographic characteristics. The vector Z\nis a vector of detailed health measures (e.g., chronic\nconditions, physical limitations, CES-D, and vitality).\nAlthough we do not observe h*, we observe general\nhealth status, h, a categorical variable with five levels\n(excellent-poor). Assuming h is a monotonically in-\ncreasing step function of h* (i.e., h takes the value\n\"excellent\" when h* is less than some threshold\nvalue, n-!, \"very good\" when |x, < h* < JJL2\n, etc.) and\nassuming that the error term v is distributed nor-\nmally, Equation (1) defines an ordered probit model.\nTo create a summary measure of health, we first\nestimate Equation (1) to obtain estimates of B4\n(as well as the |xs). We then use the estimated coeffi-\ncients from the model to construct\nfi* = fcX, + fi'Z, (2)\nfor each individual as a proxy for health status in our\nlabor force models. The model is ordered so that\nlarger (more positive) values of fi* represent worse\nhealth. As in the rest of this analysis, models are\nestimated separately by sex. However, in order to\nuse this measure to compare blacks and whites, we\npool black and white respondents and calculate a\nsingle measure that applies to both. (In fact, when we\nestimated Equation [1] separately by race, the coeffi-\ncients on the explanatory variables tended to be of\nvery similar magnitudes and jointly were not statisti-\ncally significantly different from one another.)\nIt is worth mentioning an important respect in\nwhich fi* differs from other indices in the literature.\nThe fact that ft* is a function not only of Z (the\ndetailed health measures) but also of X (demo-\ngraphic characteristics) means that /?* has been ad-\njusted for the extent to which, for all the reasons\nmentioned earlier, the detailed health measures\navailable in the HRS only partially measure race dif-\nferences in health. As a result, even if the Z vector\ndoes not adequately account for health differences\nbetween blacks and whites, fi* will. The one situation\nin which using fi* to measure health differences will\ntend to under (or over) estimate differences between\nblacks and whites is if blacks are optimistic (or pessi-\nmistic) relative to whites when answering the general\nModeling Labor Force Participation\nMuch of the literature on race differences in labor\nforce behavior focuses primarily on whether or not\nrespondents are participating in the labor force.\nHowever, we know that blacks and whites differ both\nin the rewards for continued work (e.g., blacks earn\nsubstantially lower wages on average) and in the\neconomic resources available to them should they\nleave the labor force (e.g., blacks have substantially\nlower assets [Smith, 1993] and are less likely than\nwhites to be covered by private pensions [Hersch &\nWhite-Means, 1993]). Black women in our sample are\nalso less likely than white women to be married --\n48% of black women and 76% of white women are\nmarried or living with a partner. Furthermore, tabula-\ntions using the HRS indicate that black women and\nmen who are out of the labor force are more likely to\nreceive income from the Dl or SSI programs and on\naverage receive a higher fraction of total income\nfrom these sources (results are available from the\nauthors). These findings suggest that the use of pub-\nlic insurance programs such as Dl and SSI differen-\ntially affects the labor force decisions of blacks and\nwhites, and in particular that black women and men\nare less likely to have the resources to retire early\nunless they can qualify for federal money. In addi-\ntion, because of program restrictions on income\nreceived from other sources, the receipt of DI/SSI\nbenefits effectively precludes individuals from being\nin the labor force. Together, these factors suggest\nthat modeling labor force participation without ac-\ncounting for black/white differences in DI/SSI appli-\ncation and participation may obscure black/white\ndifferences in labor force behavior.\nIn this context, we describe current labor force\nstatus as follows. In addition to asking about current\nlabor force status, the HRS asks respondents\nwhether they have applied for benefits from either\nDl or SSI and whether they have received benefits\nfrom either program. We define three indicator vari-\nables, Lif\nAlf\nand R, that equal 1 if the individual is in\nthe labor force, has applied for DI/SSI benefits, and\nhas received DI/SSI benefits, respectively. Then the\nprobability that a respondent is out of the labor force\nis given by\nPra,=0) = Pra;\nwhere the notation Pr(x | y) means \"the probability of\nx, given y.\" The first term in Equation (3) represents\nthe probability that a respondent applies for bene-\nfits, is accepted, and is out of the labor force. The\nsecond term represents the joint probability that the\nrespondent either doesn't apply for benefits but is\nout of the labor force or that the respondent applies,\nis rejected, and is out of the labor force.\nFollowing from Equation (3), we therefore estimate\nthree models: the probability that a respondent has\napplied for disability benefits (Equation 4), the prob-\nability that respondents who have applied have re-\nceived benefits (Equation 5), and the probability of\nbeing out of the labor force among respondents who\nare not receiving benefits (Equation 6).\nIn each model, X, is a vector of demographic vari-\nables, h* represents health, a latent variable, and F(\u00ab)\nrepresents the logistic distribution. Empirical estima-\ntion of Equations (4)-(6) will maintain the identity in\nEquation (3), because logit models have the useful\nproperty that the average of predicted probabilities\nwill equal the actual probability of any outcome.\nBecause substantial work activity is taken as evi-\ndence that an individual is capable of work and leads\nto disqualification from receiving disability benefits,\nvery few recipients of DI/SSI work. For ease of analy-\nsis, we will assume that none work. This assumption\nhas the effect of inflating predicted rates of nonpar-\nticipation by a trivial amount (less than half of a\npercentage point in this sample).\nAnalysis Method\nWe now turn to the central question posed by this\nresearch: what the labor force participation rate of\nblack men and women would be if their health status\nwere the same as that of their white counterparts. We\nestimate all models separately by race and sex. Fol-\nlowing Equations (4)-(6), we estimate P = F[$'W\nX\n+ bw\nh*] for the white sample and P = f[$'b\nX + Sb\nh*]\nfor the black sample. In this notation, P represents\nthe respective outcome variables from Equations (4)-\n(6), X and h* are defined as in the previous section,\nand the vectors pw\nand the terms 8W\nrepresent the race-specific coefficients to be esti-\nmated.\nWe seek to estimate what the levels of DI/SSI appli-\ncation, DI/SSI receipt, and labor force participation\nwould be among black respondents if blacks had the\nsame distribution of the explanatory variables -- de-\nmographic and health characteristics -- as white re-\nspondents in the sample. The nature of the nonlinear\nestimation used here precludes directly comparing\ncoefficients across the various models to assess the\nrelationship between the various health and function\nvariables on the one hand and the black/white gap in\nlabor force participation on the other. Instead, we use\nthe estimated coefficients from our models to simu-\nlate the effects of such standardization.\nUsing the preceding notation, we let Pt\n= F[j^,X,\n+ &w\nh*] represent the predicted prevalence/level for\nthe /th white in the sample, where Sw\nand pw\nrepre-\nsent estimated coefficients. Similarly, P, = Ftj^X,\n+ $>b\nh*] represents the predicted prevalence/level for\nthe/th black respondent. For the simulation, we then\ncalculate P, = FIJ^X,-*-\u00a7,,/),*] for each white sample\nmember and then average across the white sample.\nThe resulting number represents the predicted prev-\nalence for blacks were they to have the same distri-\nbution of characteristics as white respondents in the\nsample.\nAlthough we could also use white coefficients and\nblack characteristics, the thought experiment would\nbe different. Part of the empirical difference be-\ntween blacks and whites is caused by differences in\nthe social environment. These simulations assume\nthat we do not change that environment for blacks,\nbut rather change only education levels, marital sta-\ntus, and health. Obviously, our choice of simulation\ntechniques will affect our results substahtively only\nwhen the logit coefficients differ between blacks and\nwhites. ,\nThus, it is important to address the issue of the\nmagnitude of the difference between black and\nwhite coefficients. Not only are blacks more likely to\nbe in poor health than whites, but differences be-\ntween the groups in terms of labor market experi-\nences and in terms of skills imply that health may\nvery well have a larger effect on the labor market\nactivity of black men and women relative to whites.\nOne way to examine the differential response to\nhealth status is to simulate equal improvements in\nhealth status for otherwise identical black and white\nrespondents using race-specific coefficients. For\nthese simulations, we calculate the average values\n(by sex) of health (/?*), first for respondents who\nreport their health as \"very good\" or \"excellent\" and\nthen for respondents who report their health to be\n\"fair\" or \"poor.\" Then, for a 55-year-old respondent\nwith a high school education, we simulate each of\nthe outcomes for the average individual in good\nhealth and the average individual in poor health.\nThese simulations demonstrate the differential effect\nof health on the labor force participation of blacks\nand whites as well as the differential effects for mar-\nried and unmarried individuals.\nResults\nBlack/White Differences in Health\nBlack women and men in our sample are signifi-\ncantly more likely than whites to report their overall\nhealth as fair or poor: 36% of black women report\nbeing in fair/poor health, compared to 17% of white\nwomen, while 33% of black men and 17% of white\nmen report fair/poor health. Black women and men\nin the HRS sample frame are also significantly more\nlikely to report having most specific conditions as-\nsessed in the survey, and have universally greater\ndifficulty performing each activity of daily living and\ninstrumental activity of daily living than their white\ncounterparts (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1995).\nTo put these differences in the context of our\nhealth index, Table 1 presents estimates of the coeffi-\ncient on the race dummy from several alternative\nspecifications of Equation (1). Given the discrete\nnature of the dependent variable, the units of h* are\narbitrary. Standard practice (and most computer pro-\ngrams) normalize estimates so that var(v) = 1. How-\never, as we move across specifications, the interpre-\nTable 1. Race Differences in Overall Health\nControlling for: Women Men\nTable 2.

To maintain comparability, we\nhave chosen to normalize h* such that var(/?*) = 1\n(Winship & Mare, 1984). As a result, coefficients can\nbe interpreted as partially standardized, that is, as\nthe effect of a unit change in the independent vari-\nable in terms of standard deviations on health.\nAs we expect, being black is associated with\npoorer health. Thus, the health of an average black\nwoman is .588 standard deviations worse than that of\nthe average white woman in our sample, while the\nhealth of the average black man is .398 standard\ndeviations worse than that of the average white man!\nAs other demographic control variables are added\n(Model 2), the coefficient decreases in magnitude:\nControlling for marital status, proxy status, and edu-\nhealth difference among women and 44% among\nmen. Controlling for age and the full set of detailed\nhealth measures eliminates 56% of the health gap for\nwomen and 41% of the gap for men. When the\ndemographic and detailed health characteristics are\nentered together (Model 3), the coefficient is further\nreduced but not eliminated, with around 40% of the\nblack/white gap remaining. The fact that including\neducation and marital status in the health equations\nlowers the magnitude of the coefficients on race\nimplies that race differences in education and marital\nstatus can statistically account for part, but not all, of\nthe large health difference between middle-aged\nwhites and blacks (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1995).\nThe substantial residual race differences that we\ncontinue to find in the last row of Table 1 presumably\nreflect primarily differences in \"actual\" health that are\nnot captured by the detailed health measures avail-\nable in the HRS. Although the extensive health mea-\nsures available in the HRS should avoid some of the\nproblems associated with measures based on the\noverall global measure, even the measures in the HRS\nonly partly describe individual health status. They do\nnot cover all aspects of health; they are subject to\nmeasurement error (Edwards et al., 1994; Mathiowetz\n& Lair, 1994); and with respect to specific conditions,\nthey cover prevalence but provide little information\nregarding severity. In addition, to the extent that\nblacks do respond to the specific health questions in\nthe HRS differently than do whites, the coefficient on\nrace in Equation (1) will also pick this up.\nWomen\nBlack (actual rate)\nStandardized on\nAge, education\nAge, education and\nmarital status\nAge, education, marital\nstatus and health\nWhite (actual rate)\nMen\nBlack (actual rate)\nStandardized on\nAge, education\nAge, education and\nmarital status\nAge, education, marital\nstatus and health\nWhite (actual rate)\nEquation (4):\n% Applied\nEquation (6):\n%OLF |\nnot on DI/SSI\nDerived:\nNotes: OLF = Out of the labor force.

The dependent vari-\nables are the respective labor force outcomes, as\ndiscussed previously. The left side of each panel lists\ndifferent model specifications (the demographic\nvariables are defined in Table 1a, while the health\nmeasures are described here). Because the overall\nfocus of Table 2 is on black/white differences in labor\nforce outcomes and not on the effects of the covari-\nates on labor force status per se, information on the\nregression coefficients is not presented here. In-\nstead, we present actual and predicted rates for re-\nspective outcomes.\nThe first two columns in Table 2 present estimates\nbased on Equation (4), the probability that respon-\ndents applied for DI/SSI, and Equation (6), the proba-\nbility that respondents who are not on DI/SSI are out\nof the labor force. Although we estimated Equation\n(5), the probability of receiving DI/SSI among re-\nspondents who applied, we do not present results\nfrom this model because none of the independent\nvariables has much explanatory power. As a result,\nthe predicted proportion of Dl applicants who re-\nceive benefits is nearly constant, regardless of the\nspecification used.\nThe final column in Table 2 presents the overall\nprobability that respondents are out of the labor\nforce. These probabilities are not estimated directly,\nbut rather are derived from Equation (3). Specifically,\nwe used the estimated results from Equations (4)-(6),\ntogether with the assumption that all respondents\nwho receive DI/SSI are out of the labor force, to solve\nfor the left side of Equation (3), the probability of\nbeing out of the labor force.\nApplication for DI/SSI. --The first column in Table\n2 indicates that black women and men are much\nmore likely to apply for DI/SSI. Because blacks and\nwhites have essentially identical age distributions in\nour sample (results available from the authors), age\nalone plays no role in black/white differences in\nlabor force outcomes in our sample, but controlling\nfor age and education (Model 1) accounts for approx-\nimately a third of the gap for both women and men.\nAdding marital status to this model (Model 2) ac-\ncounts for a total of more than 60% of the gap among\nwomen and about half the gap for men. The differ-\nence in predicted rates between Models 1 and 2 gives\nthe marginal effect of differences in marital status,\nwhich indicate that differences in marital status alone\naccount for 29% of the gap among women and 15%\namong men. Adding controls for health accounts for\n116% (Model 3) of the difference in application rates\nbetween black and white women, and 97% of the\ndifference among men.\nOut of Labor Force/Not on DI/SSI. -- The next\ncolumn in Table 2 indicates that, among respondents\nwho are not on DI/SSI, black women are substantially\nless likely than white women and black men are\nsubstantially more likely than white men to be out of\nthe labor force. Model 1 indicates that if black\nwomen who are not on DI/SSI had the educational\nattainment of white women, an even lower fraction\nof them would be out of the labor force. Model 2\nindicates that differences in marital status have equal\nand opposite effects as education differences. Fi-\nnally, Model 3 indicates that if black women who are\nnot on DI/SSI had the health status of white women\nin this group, their labor force participation would be\nsubstantially higher than it currently is.\nAmong men who are not on DI/SSI, controlling for\neducation differences widens the gap between\nblacks and whites, the opposite of the effect ob-\nserved for women. This apparently anomalous find-\ning, however, seems to be a result of the imprecise\nestimate of the effect of educational attainment in\nthe underlying logit. The marginal effect of control-\nling for differences in marital status is to narrow the\ngap between black and white men, lowering the\nfraction of blacks who are out of the labor force.\nSimilarly, controlling for differences in health status\nnarrows the black/white difference, raising the pre-\ndicted labor force participation of black men.\nOut of Labor Force. -- The final column in Table 2\nexamines overall black/white differences in labor\nforce participation. As noted earlier, equal fractions\nof black and white women are out of the labor force,\nwhile a much higher fraction of black men is cur-\nrently out of the labor force. For women, Model 1\nindicates that, controlling for differences in educa-\ntional attainment, black women would have higher\nparticipation rates than white women. After control-\nling for education, differences in marital status do\nnot account for any of the difference in participation\nrates; this finding is consistent with the previous\nfindings, which indicate that higher rates of marriage\nlower the predicted application rate of black women\nbut raise the predicted likelihood that black women\nnot on DI/SSI would be out of the labor force. Finally,\nModel 3 suggests that, in the absence of health\ndifferences between black and white women, a\nmuch lower percentage of black than white women\nwould be out of the labor force.\nIn terms of Equation (3), these results imply that\nmore than a third of the black women currently out\nof the labor force would be in the labor force if their\ndemographic and health characteristics were the\nsame as those of white women. Our findings imply\nthat more than 70% of this increase is due to de-\ncreases in the fraction receiving disability benefits.\nThe rest is made up of increases in the participation\nrate of black women who do not receive benefits, as\nseen in the middle set of simulations. We find that\npoor health is strongly implicated in reducing the\nparticipation of black women who do not receive\nbenefits. Relatively low levels of educational at-\ntainment also suppress participation, whereas rela-\ntively lower rates of marriage serve to inflate\nparticipation rates.\nAmong men, black/white differences in education,\nmarital status, and health account for substantial frac-\ntions of the black/white differences in labor force\nparticipation. Education differences alone account\nfor 12% of the gap, while differences in marital status\naccount for a further 17%. Finally, after controlling for\ndemographic differences, differences in health status\n(Model 3) account for an additional 54% of the gap.\nIn terms of Equation (3), more than one-third of\nblack men who are out of the labor force would be\nworking if they had the demographic and health\ncharacteristics of white men. Our results imply that\nmost of this increase (about 80%) can be accounted\nfor by decreases in the fraction receiving disability\nbenefits. The participation rate for the non-DI popu-\nlation would increase with improvements in health,\nbut not nearly as much as they would for women who\ndo not receive benefits. The only anomalous finding\nin this table is that for those not on Dl, black men\nwith higher levels of education work less than those\nwith lower levels of education.\nAccounting for Labor Force Differences:\nRace Differences in the Effects of Health\nApplication for DI/SSI. -- Table 3(A) presents\nresults for the probability of applying for DI/SSI. Poor\nhealth is a very strong predictor of application and is\nstronger for blacks than for whites. This result is\nparticularly true when comparing white and black\nmen. Although application rates for men in good\nhealth are similarly small for blacks and whites, black\nmen in poor health are much more likely to apply for\nbenefits. This may reflect differences in skills and\nexperiences between blacks and whites, which may\nlead blacks to have greater difficulty adapting to the\nonset of poor health; or to the fact that the ratio of\nTable 3.

In addition, for every race, sex, and health\ncategory, unmarried women and men are signifi-\ncantly more likely to apply for DI/SSI. Unmarried\nwomen may be more likely to have sufficient em-\nployment history to be eligible to apply for Dl and\nsufficiently low household income to qualify for SSI,\nwhile married men generally have stronger labor\nforce attachment than unmarried men.\nOut of Labor Force/Not on DI/SSI. -- Table 3(B)\npresents results for the probability of being out of\nthe labor force among respondents who are not on\nDI/SSI. Poor health is a strong predictor of being out\nof the labor force, although the odds ratios are much\nsmaller than in the previous panel, and the effect of\npoor health is stronger for blacks than for whites.\nAlthough participation rates for men in good health\nare similar for blacks and whites, black men in poor\nhealth are much more likely to be out of the labor\nforce than their white counterparts. Several explana-\ntions for this dramatic difference seem possible.\nFirst, differences in job histories and employer will-\ningness to accommodate workers in poor health may\nwork in favor of white men staying in the labor force.\nIt is also reasonable to believe that the relative re-\nwards for continued work (wages) favor white men.\nThis explanation, however, leaves unanswered the\nquestion of what these men do for income. One\npossibility for married men might be reliance on\nspousal income.\nAmong women, married black and white women\nin poor health are significantly more likely to be out\nof the labor force than any other group of women.\nBlack married women in good health are much less\nlikely than white women to be out of the labor force,\nas are married black women in poor health, although\nthis difference is somewhat smaller. Although un-\nmarried black women in good health are about as\nlikely to be out of the labor force as their white\ncounterparts, black women in poor health are more\nlikely to be out of the labor force than their white\ncounterparts. These findings for women suggest, as\nothers have found, that in good health, black women\nrely more on their own resources than white women.\nOut of Labor Force. -- Table 3(C) presents results\nfor the overall probability of being out of the labor\nforce; as in Table 2, the results are derived from the\nprevious models rather than estimated directly. As\nexpected, we find that for overall labor force partici-\npation, health is relatively more important for blacks\nthan for whites, particularly in the labor force partici-\npation of black men.\nDiscussion\nOur findings from the Health and Retirement Sur-\nvey indicate that the relatively poor health of black\nmen and women, when compared to their white\ncounterparts, accounts for much of the apparent\ndifference in the timing of labor force exit. Health\ndifferences would appear to account for virtually all\nof the two-to-one difference between the fraction of\nblack and the fraction of white middle-aged men out\nof the work force. Among women, our results sug-\ngest that older black women would have higher labor\nforce participation than white women, as they do at\nyounger ages, if black women had health status simi-\nlar to whites in our sample.\nOur findings also seem to indicate that although\nhealth is important for both blacks and whites in\naccounting for early exits from the labor force, it\nseems to play a more central role for blacks than for\nwhites. We have found consistent evidence suggest-\ning that blacks in poor health are more likely to leave\nthe workforce than whites in poor health. It seems\nplausible that this difference in responsiveness re-\nflects the very different social and economic envi-\nronments faced by the two populations. On the one\nhand, blacks in good health are less likely to have\naccess to the financial resources to permit them to\nretire early. They are less able to count on a spouse's\nearnings, have less in the way of financial assets, and\nblack men, in particular, are less likely to be in jobs\nthat include pension benefits. On the other hand,\nboth black men and women are more likely to be in\nphysically demanding jobs, jobs for which good\nhealth is important, and those with impairments\nmay have particular trouble finding alternative\nemployment.\nAlthough our results are suggestive of the factors\nthat explain why blacks seem more responsive than\nwhites to poor health, the Health and Retirement\nSurvey contains much information that might shed\nmore light on these factors. Future work, especially\nthat which utilizes the longitudinal nature of the\nstudy, should not only investigate the source of the\nresidual differences, but also examine the conse-\nquences of these differences for the economic well-\nbeing of older black and white adults.\nReferences\nAdebimpe, V.
