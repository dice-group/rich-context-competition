    "abstract": "Abstract\nVisual methods are a popular way of engaging children and young people in research. Their\ngrowth comes out of a desire to make research practice more appropriate and meaningful to\nthem. The auteur approach emphasises the need to explore with young participants why they\nproduce the images they do, so that adult researchers do not impose their own readings. This\narticle, while recognising the value of such visual techniques, argues that their benefit is not that\nthey are more age appropriate, or that they are more authentic. Instead it lies in their capacity\nto display the social influences on how participants, of any age, represent themselves. The article\ndoes so through discussion of an Economic and Social Research Council research project, which\nmade use of visual and other creative methods, undertaken in the UK with disabled young\npeople. The research involved narrative and photo elicitation interviews, the production of photo\njournals, and creative practice workshops aimed at making representational artefacts. Through\nanalysing the photography, the journals and interviews the article examines what it was research\nparticipants sought to capture and also what influenced the types of photographs they gathered\nand the type of person they wanted to represent. We argue that they aimed to counter negative\nrepresentations of disability by presenting themselves as happy, active and independent, in doing\nso they drew from broader visual iconography that values certain kinds of disabled subject, while\ndisvaluing others.\n",

The growth in these tech-\nniques has been spurred on by calls for research approaches to be more appropriate to\nhow young people engage with the world. One particularly favoured technique is the use\nof visual methods, whether this be drawing, photography or filmmaking. Work with disa-\nbled young people has also followed this path, with various researchers arguing that\ncreative methods help disabled young people express their ideas away from mainstream\nmodes of interaction and communication that leave the adult and often non-disabled\nresearcher in charge. The growth of such approaches is welcome, it has enabled the\ninclusion of a broader range of tools for working with children and young people (and\nothers). However, it is important to consider how, as with other methods, the insights\nthey generate may be moderated by the presence of the social world in their gathering.\nSome advocates of creative visual approaches argue that they generate greater authentic-\nity in the accounts produced when working with children and young people. We are not\nconvinced this is the reason to include them; instead their value lies in how they can be\nused to highlight how children and young people's location within social relations influ-\nences their visual accounts of who they are and the lives they lead. In particular, the\narticle will examine the influence of stigma in the stories they produce through visual\ntechniques. Therefore, the value of using such techniques with children and young peo-\nple, comes in the particular insight they bring on how social relations and positions influ-\nence how they articulate and present their identity, rather than being more appropriate to\nthem due to their age and development.\nThinking about how social dynamics influence participants' engagement with visual\nmethods is particularly important to do when using them in disability research. This is\nbecause of the important role visual iconographies around disability have long played in\npositioning disabled people as outside `normal' society. A range of visual tropes have\nemerged over time, for example the visual cataloguing of eugenics that associated par-\nticular types of body shape and feature (and colour) with lesser forms of human being;\nthe Victorian freak show that fed voyeuristic curiosity in the `exotic'; and the charity\nimage of the passive and tragic child in a wheelchair or callipers (Osten, 2010; Stiker,\n2000; Craton, 2009). Some of these images are now recognised as problematic, for\nexample the charity collection boxes of a child in callipers, usually clutching a teddy\nbear, have now disappeared from outside shop fronts. In their place have developed alter-\nnative images of disability, some of which signify a more inclusive and celebratory set of\nmeanings - the Paralympic hero \u00ad while others offer challenge and resistance \u00ad the dis-\nability activist blocking traffic, the disabled dancer. At the same time traces of the prob-\nlematic iconography of the past remain updated to contemporary contexts, for example\nthe dysmorphic child displayed in medical journals has uneasy associations with the\neugenics of the Victorian period (Shaw, 2003), while the reality show fascination with\ndisability, for example Channel 4's The Undateables or Seven Dwarfs, for some offers\ninsight into disabled people's lives, for others risks echoing the public spectacle of the\nfreak show (Backstrom, 2012). In using visual methods in disability research, it\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 3\nis important to consider how the existence of public images of disability \u00ad that either\nstigmatise or celebrate \u00ad may influence disabled participants', including children and\nyoung people's, engagement with visual representation.\nThe article begins by exploring the debates around the benefits of using creative and\nvisual methods when working with disabled and non-disabled children and young people.\nIt makes the case that their value primarily lies in providing distinctive testimony on the\nrole of existing visual tropes that offer value and rejection in influencing how people rep-\nresent themselves in their social worlds and within research. After a summary of how our\nproject with disabled young people developed, we move on to discuss the findings. We\ndetail what participants sought to represent in their rich and carefully curated photographic\nwork, while also considering the social influences on what they produced. In particular,\nwe argue that what the participants aimed to display was an active independent disabled\nsubject, someone who could be recognised by others, and that this focus on being active\nand independent was influenced by contemporary privileging of such subjects.\nVisual methodologies and valuing young people's voices\nThe growth of visual and other creative methods in research involving children and\nyoung people is closely associated with the call for young people to have a more active\npresence in research about their lives (James, 2007). It is proposed that visual techniques\nprovide a creative way to escape the adult power dynamics of interviewing (Capello,\n2005; Einarsdottir, 2005). That they can make research participation more interesting for\nchildren and young people (Bagnoli, 2011; Darbyshire et al., 2005) and that they are a\nrich way to explore issues of identity (Gibson et al., 2013) and illuminate `childhood\nlandscapes' (Faulstich Orellana, 1999: 73). Few advocate that such techniques should or\ncould replace existing approaches such as interviewing and observation, but they are\nnow important to consider when designing work with children and young people.\nThis spread of visual methods has also increased within research with disabled chil-\ndren and young people \u00ad although it is acknowledged that they are not appropriate for\nall, particularly those with sight impairments (although other creative methods such as\nstorytelling can be). Disabled childhoods researchers argue that established social sci-\nence research techniques - in particular the dominance of the interview - can be prob-\nlematic for disabled children and young people who may face limitations in traditional\nor mainstream forms of cognition and communication (Sutherland and Young, 2014).\nIn contrast, creative and visual approaches can reach beyond to enable disabled chil-\ndren and young people to express perspectives that could not be captured otherwise.\nOne important development within the pursuit of visual methods with young people is\nthe call for techniques that enable them to be `auteurs,' fully shaping the account of their\nlives. To do so, researchers argue it is not enough to ask participants to take photographs,\nwhat is also required is that the researcher explores the intent of the photographer in pro-\nducing the images they have. Drew and Guillemin detail practical steps that can ensure\n`interpretive engagement between the researcher, the image, the participant and the antici-\npated (and unanticipated) audience/s' (2014: 55). In particular, they advocate the use of\nPhoto-Elicitation (Belin, 2005) or Photovoice (Darbyshire et al., 2005) techniques that can\nprovide a platform within which the photographer's actual aims and vision are central to\nanalyses. Through discussing with the photographer why they took particular photographs,\nthe aim is to avoid an adult mis-interpretation of what the young person is aiming to repre-\nsent (Luttrell, 2010). Mannay (2010) uses this approach, spending time with young research\nparticipants to explore what they are trying to display about their lives via their photo-\ngraphs (an approach she refers to as `participant-directed visual data production' (2010:\n107)). She argues that `Auteur theory is required on a practical level because the interpreta-\ntion of the audience is not necessarily the same as the narrative the image-maker wanted to\nresearchers privilege children and young people's voices, rather than their own.\nThe shift to visual and other creative approaches has generated some criticism, par-\nticularly around the idea that they: (a) produce a more authentic account of the `child'\nperspective, and, (b) are better suited than other qualitative methods such as interviews\nfor working with children and young people. In relation to the first critique, there is a\nconcern that the legitimate political desire to advocate for children and young people as\nexperts in their own lives, risks stripping them from the contexts that inform their under-\nstandings of their lives (Gallagher, 2009). Gallacher and Gallagher (2008) have argued\nthat the critique of developmental approaches, which framed children and young people\nas actors in a process of becoming subjects sometime in their abstract adult future, has\nled to an over fixation on claiming they are beings already fully formed. Instead, children\nand young people's agency, like that of adults, is situated and contingent within social\npower relations and recognised values and norms. If research concentrates on advocating\nthat children and young people can produce, with the right tools, an authentic and indi-\nvidually formed account of their lives, it may miss engaging also with the social condi-\ntions, or what Komulainen (2007) refers to as `socialness', of their participation and how\ntheir social agency is situated and constrained (Spyrou, 2011).\nThe second critique proposes that advocating for particular `child centred techniques'\nruns counter to the sociology of childhood argument that the boundaries between child-\nhood, adolescence and adulthood are socially produced and varied (Hunleth, 2011,\nCorsaro, 2005). If children and young people are not essentially distinct to adults, why\nshould they automatically and universally be more interested in creative approaches? It\nis better instead, argues Punch (2002), to suggest that such techniques offer value to a\nrange of research participant and research issue. This is what we want to argue, that vis-\nual techniques, such as those associated with `auteur theory', offer a particular insight,\nrather than one that is more authentic for working with children and young people.\nWhat visual approaches provide is an opportunity to produce a rich and vivid account\nof how broader social imagery influences people's social position and identity. It is\nimportant to retain an appreciation of the `socialness' of anyone's ability to visually cap-\nture their interpretation of their life. Such individual acts are located within the broader\nvisual and social imaginaries already present in the world. Therefore, what images a\nparticipant produces is not linked to their actual age (child/adolescent/adult) in terms of\nwhat this implies for their cognitive development, but to how their age may influence the\ntypes of social lives they lead. How we take and look at pictures is shaped by the images\nthat already exist around us, images already associated with social meanings and values.\nMetz's (1977) still influential idea of scopic regimes is a helpful way of understanding\nhow existing iconography for representing particular social subjects influence how new\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 5\nimages are produced and read, shaping how we take photographs to fit particular conven-\ntions and then how we read images against such conventions. The regime is more than a\nquestion of format and style on three levels. First, scopic regimes influence meaning, for\nexample how particular images are read as symbols of beauty/ugliness, power/weakness,\nnormativity/deviance, good/evil and so on. Second, those meanings do not just influence\nhow images are read, but also how people are compared against such existing imagery as\nthey are socially judged and located. Third, photographic norms are informed by and\ninform broader social values, replicating, but also encouraging the privileging of some\nways of being and living over others. This means that while we can explore someone's\nintent, rather than simply interpret it for ourselves, that intent will itself be a product of\nthe photographer's ongoing location within a broader set of photographic and societal\nnorms, styles, meanings and values that will influence what they aim to capture and why.\nAs we mentioned at the beginning, disabilities, particularly forms of mind-body differ-\nence that are visually apparent, have been marked, both in the past and the present, by\nvisual tropes that produce otherness. One way in which that has been explored in sociology\nis via the notion of stigma (an area we have explored in more detail in other publications\n(McLaughlin, 2017; McLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain, 2014)). The concept of stigma is\nused to explore how disability, when identified by others as a problematic social presence,\nleads those labelled as disabled to mediate their behaviour and embodied performances to\nappear more `normal' (Goffman, 1968; Davis, 1961). Contemporary work in sociology,\ncultural studies and critical disability studies takes these ideas forward by focusing in on\nthe interaction between existing visual narratives around disability as monstrous or exotic,\nand dynamics of everyday social relations (Scully, 2010; Shildrick, 2012). In particular\nGarland-Thomson's (2006) work on `ways of staring' is very valuable here. Her argument\nis that non-disabled people feel a freedom to stare at those outside the norm; in the process\nlegitimating and securing the social separation between the `normate' and `non-normate'\nand positioning the person stared at as `not one of us'. Therefore, some forms of disability\nthat mark the body \u00ad either in appearance or interaction with the world \u00ad as visually differ-\nent, are associated with visual tropes that define such difference as problematic.\nNevertheless, as we also highlighted earlier, the range of images now visible in the\npublic realm imply a more open and expansive scopic regime, where alternatives exist to\nvisualise the disabled subject as active, valued and `one of us'. It is therefore interesting\nto explore how disabled young people choose to represent themselves and to examine\nwith them the relationship between their selected images and broader available represen-\ntations of disability. For example, as they move through adolescence, what are the images\naround them, and how do they influence how they represent their identity and position in\nthe world? A study we undertook with some disabled young people exploring embodi-\nment provides an opportunity to engage with this question.\nThe study\nOur study1 involved working with disabled young people on the theme of the disabled\nbody. Recruitment to the study was from a cohort of young people (aged 14 to 20) with\na diagnosis of cerebral palsy and who were resident in the North East of England, some\nof whom had been part of the qualitative phase of an earlier study on childhood cerebral\npalsy and pain2 (recruitment from the cohort gave us access to qualitative data derived\nfrom interviews carried out with them five years previously). Thirteen young people\nwere recruited from this group, with another four recruited from a local school for disa-\nbled children and young people to enhance recruitment. Seven young women and ten\nyoung men were involved. The diagnosis of cerebral palsy that each had affected them in\nvaried ways relating to speech, mobility, dexterity, body shape and other issues such as\nepilepsy and learning disabilities. The primary access route to recruitment was via a\nNHS held patient database, this meant that ethics approval for the project was sought and\ngranted via the NHS.\nWe wanted to work with the disabled young people through a variety of routes that\ncould provide both choice in what they wanted to engage with and opportunities for them\nto reflect on their lives (Bagnoli, 2011). The specifics of what we did was also influenced\nby the input of a research panel of disabled young people. The work began with an open-\nended interview to introduce the project's themes, including what disability meant to\nparticipants, and how their body was changing as they were aging. This interview also\nincluded discussion of the childhood interviews that had been undertaken. They were\nthen invited to create a photo journal that captured their identities as disabled young\npeople. This was done using the young people's existing photographic practices, includ-\ning letting them use cameras they already owned (often their phones) and allowing them\nto source old images of themselves or images found elsewhere (like stock-images found\non the internet). They were given a paper journal to display the photographs and invited\nto put any thoughts they had about the photos and why they had chosen alongside.\nCameras and printers were provided for those who did not have them.\nThe images and journals were then discussed with the participants in a second interview\nso that we did not jump to our interpretation without exploring what they sought to capture\nvia the images they took. Once the journals were completed they were digitally scanned\nand returned to each participant to keep. Finally, two creative workshops were held in the\nfinal stages of the fieldwork, during which jewellery making was used as an alternative\nway of eliciting stories and generating representative artefacts. Seventeen took part in the\nfirst interviews; eight engaged in visual work, six of whom participated in the second inter-\nview; and three of those took part in the workshops.After the journals and photographs had\nbeen discussed, the research team selected the images we intended to use in public dissemi-\nnation (for example, conferences and articles such as this one). Images of, or including,\nother people or places that were easily identifiable were excluded. Each participant was\nsent copies of the pictures we hoped to use, with the likely contexts they would be used in\nalso set out in an attached letter. We asked each participant to select and give consent for\neach picture they were happy for us to use. The majority of images we selected were given\napproval by their creators, some did not get back to us and those images are not used and\nwe received a small number of requests not to use particular images.\nUsing images of research participants generates a variety of issues, in particular the\npotential reduction in anonymity and issues of being unable to control how others may\n`mis-read' images via their existing cultural values (Moreno Figueroa, 2008). While\nacknowledging these issues, after reflection we decided to include images we had par-\nticipant consent to use in public domains such as this. Our decision was based on a wish\nto recognise the choices the young people made in producing the photographs, sharing\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 7\nthem with us and agreeing for their dissemination. At the point when participants were\nasked about each image we wished to use, they had been working with us for close to 2\nyears. The working relationship that had developed over that time through regular con-\ntact, we hope, gave them the space within which they could say no to anything they did\nnot feel comfortable with \u00ad and indeed some did say no to particular images at this stage.\nGiven we recognise that agency is possible for young people, to refute their choices\naround sharing the images seems problematic. At the same time we do appreciate that\nsharing such images is not without issue and that giving young people choice does not\nabsolve us of our responsibility as researchers to both provide an expansive space for\nthem to make their decisions, but also for us to reflect on the broader political landscape\nof both research production and its consumption by others (Wiles et al., 2012).\nVisualising the disabled subject\nOne aspect of the participants' lives they did want to capture in words, images and dis-\ncussions with us was how others did not treat them as `one of us'. Stories of bullying,\nabuse, being stared at and isolation from childhood into the present day were shared:\n\n`Cos I fall over and these lads laughed at me and said something horrible and I will\nnot repeat it, about my disability and one of my mates heard what they said, and\nmy mate went `What did you just say to my mate' and I had to grab hold of my\nmate and go `No you don't' and pull them in the opposite direction. (Hannah, 18,\nInterview 1)\nP:\n....you don't get all the people staring at you as much [referring to the able bod-\nied interviewer]. It's kind of really irritating, I find if I just walk sometimes\npeople will just stare and really irritates us sometimes.\n---\nI: So they stare when you walk, why would they do that?\nP:\nI don't know it's just with, `cos like when I go for me dinner [at college] I'll go\ninto [the] town centre and people that don't know you, haven't seen you before\nand they just have a little glare at you. I just think it's kind of rude, just irritates\nme sometimes.\n---\nI: So do you use the wheelchair less for that reason?\nP: Yeah.\n----\nI: So do you take your stick to college?\nP:\nWell I don't, I just don't think, [pause] in a way I would like to take it with us.\n`Cos like a lot of people there are more likely just to stare cos I've got a stick.\nJust think it'll be easier to just go without a stick. (Paul, 16, Interview 1)\nThe participants' visual cataloguing of these everyday experiences imply both their\nawareness of how recognition of visible difference within social space leads to dynamics\nof stigma and othering and also, their desire to capture and represent the problems this\njournals, in the images the participants curated in them and the subsequent discussions of\nthem in the photo elicitation interview, the representations of them as outsiders were of\na significantly smaller number than positive images about their lives and living with dis-\nability. While in the first interviews the majority acknowledged past and present social\nFigure 1. Sean, 14, Photo Journal. Text reads: `One of the main challenges I face, is that of\nmaking friends my own age and socialising with young people'.\nFigure 2. Sean, 14, powerpoint slides he produced as one version of the photo journals he\nmade.\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 9\ndifficulties created by stigma, the photo journals were not a space where that was their\nfocus. Instead, one of the strongest commonalities across the photography work was that\nwhat they took and selected were pictures that captured their active and relational pres-\nence in the world. There was very much an emphasis in their images of them doing\nFigure 3. Kate's legs before and after surgery, included in her photo journal.\nFigure 4. Kate on her 16th birthday, included in her photo journal.\nthings, often with others: participating in sport, in social activities, on holiday, in school,\namongst friends and family.\nIn our discussions with them about why these photos were chosen it was clear they\nwanted to represent aspects of themselves, their embodiment and their relationships with\ntheir social and intimate worlds that were evidence of their active and valued subjectivity.\nHere were ways they were involved in the world, making plans for the future that would\nenable them to be in work, to have relationships, to be independent and to be happy. In\nFigure 5. Mark during a wheelchair rugby match, photograph shared with us.\nFigure 6. Mark preparing for a match with his teammates, photograph shared with us.\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 11\naddition, their shared aim was to challenge a prevalent representation of disability: that of\nthe passive, dependent figure. Within their visual accounts of the active subject, their nar-\nratives varied, indicating there are different ways to frame and enact what being such a\nsubject involves. What we want to do here is discuss two different active subjects that\nemerged in the accounts of Kate (15) and Mark (17): 1) the attractive female teenager, 2)\nthe aggressive disabled sportsman. In doing so what we want to do, as well as capture their\nvivid accounts of their active and valued lives, is to explore the importance of existing\nvisual representations and associated social values in how they did so.\nKate's photo journal explored the emergence of a young attractive, happy teenager\nlooking forward to university, a career in medicine and raising a family. It detailed how\nshe looked after herself, the various medical interventions - in particular recent surgery\non her legs - that had reshaped her body, and her relationships with important friends and\nFigure 7. Kate, photo journal. Text reads: `It's about movement and being spirited to do\nthings and not to give up and not be bothered. I don't think that your disability is an excuse and\nthe Paralympics is a prime example of not letting anything stop you do sport'.\nfamily. Her interview around the photographs brought out aspects the photographs did\nnot immediately convey to others \u00ad the hurt when her boyfriend stopped seeing her dur-\ning the long recovery from the recent surgery, the significant pain that surgery had led to,\nbut also the friendships she made in hospital, which had sustained her during that time\nand are ongoing. For her it was less important that the images conveyed those experi-\nences to others, rather, what she had enjoyed about the process was the memories they\ngenerated for her. For example, when discussing the picture below of her legs before and\nafter surgery she noted:\nlike this is a picture of my knees, I thought well it reminded me of all the people that I met and\nwhat kind of experience it was . . . So it wasn't just the literal meaning of what was in the\npicture, it obviously evoked other memories from that. (Kate Interview 2)\nWhat Kate discussed about the picture was how she had grown as a person during that\ntime, how she had reshaped her body to be ready for the adulthood that lay ahead and\nhow now she was on the cusp of the future she was actively making.\nI really do think that it was a defining moment in my life, like it was definitely [sighs], I don't\nknow if it's changed who I am, but it definitely made me think about things, and about what\nI've got and about how much more I've got now than I had then. And obviously, it's helped me\nto decide what I want to do as a career, and it's just made such an impact on my life I think that\nI couldn't really ignore it. (Kate, Interview 2)\nSeveral of her photographs were of her standing, looking to camera, smiling and confi-\ndent, while leaning on something. The image below, taken at her sixteenth birthday is an\nindicative example:\nSeveral aspects of the picture conform to the gendered iconography of what a young\nattractive teenage girl looks like: the pink dress, the red nail varnish and the shaping of\nher hair. What is interesting is her disability (which meant at this stage prior to surgery\nshe could not stand unaided) is not immediately obvious to the viewer. This is because\nleaning on the sink (and other ways she held herself up in other pictures) could be read\nas a way of holding the body common to portraiture. In discussion around this picture\nKate was conscious that a possible act of concealment was taking place:\nWell I mean obviously I'm leaning on the sink because I can't stand. Well I can now [after\nsurgery] but I don't think, at that point I was just kind of leaning. I don't think that necessarily\nlooks like I'm disabled because you could just lean against something and that people generally\nlean against stuff all the time on photos. But not that that would be a problem if it did look like\nI was disabled, because that's me you know. (Kate Interview 2)\nThe photographs and Kate's account of them indicate that she is a knowing photographic\nsubject. She replicates particular poses and visual styles to display a visual subject others\nwould recognise \u00ad through its echoing of symbols of attractive femininity \u00ad and in the\nprocess disguises disability by ensuring the lean is something that is not immediately\nread as something to do with it.\nMark's pictures similarly draw from gendered visual templates to present himself as\na positive figure, this time drawing on masculine images of aggression that did not\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 13\nrequire the erasure of disability to be readable to others. His pictures, taken for him by\nhis father (which he sent directly to us rather than including them in a photo journal), are\nprimarily of him playing wheelchair rugby. As with others, in his first interview he talked\nin detail about the frustration he felt when people treated him differently, in particular\nwhen he felt he was being treated with charity:\nlike in sport I think people are a bit `Whoa . . . like give him a chance to play', if we're in a race\nthey slow down and then make him think it's him that's still in the race if that makes sense,\nrather than sprinting full pelt and getting there and looking back and watching him finish the\nrace . . . like take a penalty, this has happened to me quite a lot . . . obviously you know I\nwouldn't be able to hit the ball like a hundred mile an hour, but take the shot and it's an easy\nsave and people like dive over the ball and let it go in. It's like a bit of cringing sort of thing.\nJust save the ball, man; stop, stop taking the mick. (Mark Interview 1)\nIn contrast when Mark spoke of what attracted him to wheelchair rugby in the second\ninterview exploring his photographs, it was evident this was related to the opportunity it\nprovided for a very different visual presence of the disabled body and the wheelchair.\nThis was a body and technology that displayed \u00ad for him \u00ad strong masculinity, physical-\nity, aggression and significant ability.\nMark's discussion of the photograph produced a very different figure to the disabled\nfigure to be charitable towards:\nFor me it would be the big hits, you know it's pretty much illegal anywhere else to bray someone\nout their wheelchair . . . I really do like rugby I think it's just, basketball [meaning wheelchair\nbasketball] does not hit people and you know I really just do like rugby a lot more better than\nbasketball . . . it sounds stupid but you don't really get anywhere else to hit people out of their\nwheelchair, you don't as well, the team and I think it's the ethic, the team ethic we all like talk\ntogether, which I know that happens in every sport but. I like the big hits and the way team go\non together and just cos we're disabled we still have the fire in our bellies to get the big hits in\nto win. (Mark Interview 2)\nMark's intent is to present himself as active, in control, a member of a successful team,\nto do so he makes use of gendered associations of masculinity with aggression to pro-\nduce a figure that others should be able to recognise. He works with existing scopic\nregimes and social norms around youthful masculinity to associate himself \u00ad and his\nteammates - with value. In doing so he produces a challenge to stereotypical stigmatising\nrepresentations of disability, both those that construct disability as passive, but also - as\nimportantly - those that associate a positive disabled subject as one who overcomes their\ndisability. Mark's images aim to present the active self through disability and through\nwhat other disability representations frame as assistive technology \u00ad the wheelchair. In\nhis interviews \u00ad mirroring Paul earlier \u00ad he spoke about avoiding using his wheelchair or\nstick, particularly when out with his non-disabled mates and in social locations such as\nthe pub. In contrast in his images of wheelchair rugby, the wheelchair is central to visu-\nally producing the valued subject. In doing so the technology and the disabled body are\nvisibly positioned in a very specific way. The reading Mark aims to produce of himself\nis supported by the wider presence disability sport now has in the public sphere. Events\nsuch as the Paralympics (the London 2012 Paralympics took place during our fieldwork)\noffers him the promise that others will get what he is trying to do.\nThe photographic work of Katie and Mark capture the kinds of agency associated\nwith auteur theory; they make use of existing cultural imaginaries associated with ado-\nlescence \u00ad aggressive masculinity and attractive femininity \u00ad to tell the story they want\nto tell, one which aims to position themselves as valuable subjects. An intent is there and\nis visible to others; however, fully engaging with what their pictures and accounts pro-\nduce needs to also reflect on what influences the way in which they develop their pho-\ntography. This is important to do in order to bear testimony to the limitations or conditions\nto individual agency they may also display.\nFraming the active subject\nWhile the stories Kate and Mark wish to tell appear to break the scopic regime that posi-\ntions disability as a barrier to positive recognition, there are a couple of important rea-\nsons to still retain concern with the restrictions that remain on the stories they can tell,\nwhich speak to the capacity for any of us to be the sole authors of the visual or textual\nstories we produce. First, the success of their visual and oral counter-narratives requires\nthat others see the figure they are aiming to represent. The available visual markers for\ndisability in the social realm need to have expanded enough that others can see the sub-\nject they are creating. Mark, when reflecting on why he had prioritised photographs of\nhis participation in sport, acknowledged that he wanted to be recognised as accom-\nplished. However, he thought that people could look at his images and see someone else,\nin particular the stigmatised disabled figure to feel charitable towards:\nit depends on who is looking . . . if you got someone off the street . . . they'd say `That's good\nthat they've got into a sport'and `Bless their cotton socks'rather than `We beat them, maybe be\nknocked out the chair, put twenty goals on them and all the play offs. That's quite strong to do\nthat, how does he continue to do what he does with less functions?' If you're seeing Mo Farah\nwin gold, everybody's `Yeah get in there', that's represented in the sport. In images [of disabled\nsport] obviously this is [the same] for me. (Mark Interview 2)\nWhilst Mark pursues a different visual frame to be seen within, what he cannot guarantee\nis that it will displace the visual framing he wants to escape. As Lomax et al. argue chil-\ndren and young people (or we would argue anyone) cannot `control the ways in which\nlogo in her photo journal, alongside text (see later in this section) about the positive image\nof disability it produced. However, when we discussed the image in her second interview\nshe acknowledged she now felt `na\u00efve' that it had really changed how people felt:\nif I'm honest it was kind of na\u00efve to think everybody's mind had been changed, because on\nthe TV coverage people been sending me messages to say how great it was and how much of\na boost it is for disabled sport and that kind of thing. And now recently there's been a few\ncases when I've thought well it hasn't actually really changed people's minds. (Kate,\nInterview 2)\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 15\nThe Paralympics offers a vision of active, heroic disability, but it sits alongside other\nimages of disability, past and present, that still emphasise a reading that positions the\ndisabled person as a charity figure, who can be admired, but only in a way that erases\ntheir agency and keeps them within the category of other. Mark and Kate's recognition\nthat they cannot completely control how others will read them, points to the way in\nwhich their intent remains dependent on the presence of other images and narratives to\nsupport their imaginary. While the charitable vision of the dependent disabled figure\nremains in public circulation their intent can be undermined.\nBoth Kate and Mark's concern that others may not see who they are trying to portray\nis a result of their sense that stigma and pity remain what people associate with disability.\nIn a way the valued subjects they are aiming to portray is an attempt to manage stigma,\nvia the presentation of a different self. To do so they draw on broader public iconography\nto produce the valued subject, highlighting the contingent nature of the individual agency\non display both in the images and the choices they make. The counter Kate and Mark\ncreate draws from norms of acceptable adolescence. What using visual methods with\nthem helps identify is their need to replicate hierarchies of value, in order to position\nthemselves as valuable.\nWe have already highlighted how their images conform to gendered norms of femi-\nnine beauty and masculine aggression, but here we want to concentrate on the impor-\ntance they give to the display of actively reshaping the body to enable success and\nindependence. When Kate and Mark spoke of their pictures and how they wanted to be\nseen they both returned at various points to the need to be seen as independent and get-\nting on with life. Kate spoke of liking her pictures of her legs before and after surgery,\nbecause this was a turning point in her working towards her adult future. Mark privileged\nwheelchair rugby because here was when he felt others most easily recognised his capac-\nity for independence. Such displays echo much of the contemporary ideal of individual\nself-hood as a core goal of valued young people working towards their transition to\nadulthood. Independent adulthood has become something, in an era of a shrinking wel-\nfare state, which is increasingly becoming the responsibility of the individual to pursue\nthat contemporary young people are working through a context that requires practices of\n`self-realisation' in order that they can find a secure position in society. Such practices\ninclude an emphasis on self-care and self-discipline of the body to minimise the need for\nhelp from others, particularly the state (Gill et al., 2005;Anderson, 2009). Kate and Mark\ndraw from this account of the good emerging adult citizen through their gendered empha-\nsis on working on a body that can be displayed as acceptable to others. They display their\nefforts to produce an independent body capable of enabling the futures that are working\ntowards. Kate captured some of this in the explanation she gave in her photo journal of\nwhy she included the London 2012 Paralympics logo:\nThe point in highlighting the similarity between Kate and Mark's visual and oral\nnarrative and that found in contemporary approaches to youth transitions, is not to\ncriticise them, or present them as dupes to this broader imaginary. Instead it is to\nacknowledge that because they draw from wider circulating narratives of what kinds\nof body can be valued, they remain, as we all do, within disciplinary dynamics. Kate\nand Mark display what Gill et al. call the contemporary `grammar of individualism'\n(emphasis in original, Gill, 2005: 57) young people must respond to. This is under-\nstandable, it opens up the possibility that their hard work will be recognised by others,\nthat they will be seen as good citizens. As such the way they choose to display their\nbodies says as much about the remaining restrictions within our imaginaries for what\nbodies can be and still be celebrated, as it points to their individual capacity as young\npeople to purposively speak to their lives. The visual and textual scripts we all work\nwith to present ourselves to others, in society and in a research project, work with\nexisting narratives of intelligibility. Exploring how such narratives influence what\npeople say of themselves and others, is an important rationale for drawing creative\nvisual approaches in to the research toolkit.\nConcluding remarks\nEven if the visual narratives the participants created can be thought of as compromised\nby being embedded in contemporary celebrations of individual independence, there is\nstill a political expansion in the imaginaries they opened up. Disability was present in\ntheir displays and how they wanted to be seen (Kate did not mind if people saw past lean-\ning as a photographic pose to instead recognise her as disabled: `because that's me you\nknow'). They looked to the future and thought a life of successful participation in society\nwas possible as a disabled person. The young people's visual testimony of their lives asks\nfor recognition. In doing so they are able to draw from narratives of disability that are\npresent in the social realm, which offer possibilities of recognition without having to\neither overcome disability or place it in the background. That such narratives exist\nimplies some expansion of the scopic regimes associated with both disability and a nor-\nmal/valued life.\nThe young people are knowledgeable subjects, aware that various aspects of their\nsubject position and broader dynamics of what and how people see, mean that what they\nrequest is not something they can control. The regimes of seeing they are embedded\nwithin remain significant barriers to the counter narratives they produce for others to\nrecognise them through. They also do not fully escape dominant visual regimes that\nproduce hierarchies of acceptable and unacceptable bodies in the echoes of such regimes\nfound in their narratives. They are not full `auteurs' capable of constructing a vision of\nthemselves that through discussion with them we can appreciate they are the authors of.\nHowever, this is OK, it does not reflect a questioning of their capacities as disabled\nyoung people. Instead it reflects an appreciation of the social dynamics embedded in any\narticulation of the self and its broader social location. A social reality of image produc-\ntion and consumption disabled and other young people are all too aware of.\nCreative methods such as photography therefore have a place in the approaches peo-\nple use to work with children and young people. This is not because they are `child\nfriendly', or because they produce more authentic accounts. It is because they can tap\ninto how visual representations are part of social dynamics of valuing, pitying, othering,\ncelebrating and stigmatising. They both open up such dynamics to consideration, as well\nas replicating them in the materials they produce. The relationship to age such methods\nhave, is not a developmental one. Instead it is about how they can provide testimony to\nthe particular visual imagery children and young pople, whether labelled disabled or not,\nMcLaughlin and Coleman-Fountain 17\nlive within at different stages in their transition from childhood, into adolescence and\nthrough to adulthood.\nFunding\nThis research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
