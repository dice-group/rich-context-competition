Contradictory results have been pub-\nlished, even when the data from a single study were\nanalysed by different investigators. For example, in\ntheir analysis of the second National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), some\nauthors reported a significant and positive associ-\nation between blood lead and blood pressure.1\u00ad3\nOthers, however, have questioned the selection cri-\nteria and statistical methods applied in these calcu-\nlations and found that there was no consistent\nrelation between blood lead and blood pressure.4\nIn a recent meta-analysis (23 studies involving\n33141 subjects), we reported that at low to moderate\nlevels of lead exposure, a doubling of the blood lead\nconcentration was associated with significant but\nmodest increases in blood pressure, ie 1.0 mm Hg (P\nAnother meta-analysis of 15 studies (total number\nCorrespondence: E Den Hond, PhD, Studiecoo\n\u00a8rdinatiecentrum,\nLaboratorium Hypertensie, Campus Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49,\nE-mail: elly.denhondmed.kuleuven.ac.be\nrespectively.

The NHANES III database was\nobtained on CD-ROM from the National Centre for\nHealth Statistics. The sampling procedures, examin-\nation procedures, laboratory performance and qual-\nity control measures have been described.9\nBlood pressure was measured at the MEC by\ntrained physicians according to American Heart\nBlood pressure and blood lead\nE Den Hond et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\nAssociation guidelines10 and was the mean of three\nreadings in the sitting position. Dietary calcium,\nsodium and potassium intake (mg/day) were esti-\nmated by a 24-h recall questionnaire. Diabetes was\ncoded if either disease code (ICD-9) 250 was spe-\ncified or if the subject self-reported to have diabetes.\nDiuretics, calcium channel blockers, carbonic anhy-\ndrase inhibitors, beta-blockers, alpha-agonists and\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nwere defined as antihypertensive drugs. The poverty\nindex, ie a standardised income variable, was used\nas measure for socio-economic status. Since the pov-\non a total sample of 15431), all analyses were done\nwith and without inclusion of the poverty index.\nLead in blood (nmol/L) was measured by atomic\nabsorption spectrometry as described by Miller et\nal.11 Serum total protein (g/L), serum total calcium\n(mmol/L) and haematocrit (L/L) were measured by\nstandard procedures.9\nData management and statistical analysis was\ndone with the SAS software, version 6.12. Subjects\nbelow 20 years and of races other than black or\nwhite were excluded from the analysis. This left us\n15431 had at least one valid blood pressure reading.\nSeparate analyses were done for white males, white\nfemales, black males and black females. The weight-\ning factors available in the dataset were used to\ncorrect for non-responder bias and over- or under-\nselection of certain age, gender or race-ethnicity\ngroups. Data that were not normally distributed, as\ntested by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, were log-\ntransformed and described by the median and inter-\nquartile range. In a first step of the analysis, we com-\nputed unadjusted regression coefficients between\nblood pressure and blood lead using single\nregression analysis. Effect sizes with 95% confi-\ndence intervals were calculated from the regression\ncoefficients for a doubling of the blood lead concen-\ntration. As the association between blood pressure\nand blood lead may by confounded by other vari-\nables, in a second step of the analysis, significant\ncovariables of blood pressure were identified by a\nstepwise regression analysis for the four race-gender\ngroups separately. We made an a priori decision to\ninclude known confounders in the model regardless\nof significance, ie age, age2, body-mass index,\nhaematocrit, smoking, alcohol consumption and use\nof antihypertensive drugs. The other variables\n(coffee consumption, dietary calcium, dietary\nsodium/potassium ratio, serum total protein, serum\ntotal calcium, presence of diabetes and poverty\nindex) required a 0.05 significance level to enter and\nto stay in the stepwise model. Finally, allowing for\nsignificant covariates, the relation between blood\npressure and blood lead was determined by multiple\nregression analysis and effect sizes, with 95% con-\nfidence intervals, were calculated for a doubling of\nthe blood lead concentration from the regression\ncoefficients for blood lead in the multiple\nregression analysis.\nResults\nMean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and\nblood lead levels were significantly higher in blacks\nas compared with whites and in males as compared\nwith females (Table 1). Because blood pressure and\nmost other characteristics differed according to race\nand gender (Table 1), single and multiple regression\nanalyses were performed in four race-gender groups\nseparately. A correlation matrix between systolic\nblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, the blood\nlead concentration and all other variables is given\nin Table 2.\nWithout adjustment for confounders, systolic\nblood pressures was positively associated with\nblood lead concentration (Figure 1), while diastolic\nblood pressure showed a weakly positive associ-\nation or no relation with the blood lead concen-\ntration (Figure 2). In single regression analysis, a\ndoubling of the blood lead concentration was asso-\nciated with increases in systolic blood pressure of\nfemales.

A sig-\nnificant and positive relationship was found\nbetween systolic blood pressure and blood lead, but\nonly in blacks. The relation between diastolic blood\npressure and blood lead was inconsistent for the dif-\nferent race-gender groups.\nSeveral authors1,2,4 studied the relationship\nbetween blood pressure and blood lead in NHANES\nII and reported for a doubling of blood lead a change\nin blood pressure ranging from non-significant to a\ncontradictory results probably are due to variation\nin criteria for including participants in the analysis\n(age groups, gender, race), weighting factors, covari-\nates selected as confounders and statistical methods.\nSimilarly, in the British Regional Heart Study\n(BRHS) inconsistent findings depending on statisti-\ncal methods and use of covariables were\nreported.12,13 The researcher concluded that for a\nTable 3 Covariates of systolic blood pressure in multiple\nregression analysis by race and sex\nWhite White Black Black\nmales females males females\nIndependent\nvariables\nconsumption\ndrugs\nCoffee consumption \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nsodium/potassium\nratio*\nSerum total calcium 9.99c \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nPresence of diabetes \u00ad 3.17c \u00ad \u00ad\nBlood lead, age, age2, body-mass index, haematocrit, smoking,\nalcohol consumption and intake of antihypertensive drugs were\nforced in the regression model.

In addition, the blood lead (or zinc\nprotoporphyrin) concentration at baseline did not\npredict the development of hypertension in the fol-\nlow-up period.16 These conclusions are in agree-\nment with the current findings in NHANES III, ie\nthere is no significant relationship between blood\nlead levels and blood pressure in white males or\nfemales. Also, in a population with high industrial\nexposure levels (mean blood lead levels:\nwas found between blood pressure and blood lead\nafter adjustment for confounders.17\nUnlike in white subjects, a significant and positive\nassociation was found between blood pressure and\nblood lead in black subjects. This is in agreement\nwith a prospective study performed in San Franci-\nsco bus drivers. Systolic and diastolic blood press-\nure increased significantly with rising blood lead\nlevels in blacks, but not in whites.18 Also in\nJournal of Human Hypertension\nNHANES II, race was an important covariable in the\nanalysis of blood lead and blood pressure.19\nBlood lead levels are usually higher in blacks than\nin whites. This is often attributed to socio-economic\nfactors, eg to a higher degree of urbanisation, higher\noccupational exposure or housing in older buildings\nwith lead-containing paint. In NHANES II, however,\nblack/white differences could not be explained by\ndemographic or socio-economic factors, since race\ndifferences were found in all age groups, in rural\nresidents and urban dwellers, and in families with\nlow, moderate and high incomes.20\nIt is well documented that blood pressure and\nmortality from hypertensive disease are higher in\nblacks than in whites.21,22 The reasons for these\nracial differences remain to be determined. Differ-\nences in food consumption patterns (higher sodium,\nlower potassium and calcium intake), higher preva-\nlence of obesity, lower socio-economic status\n(resulting for example in less access to antihyperten-\nsive treatment) may contribute to the higher blood\npressure in blacks.23,24 Genetic differences also may\nbe the cause of a higher inborn susceptibility to\nhypertension in blacks. Candidate susceptibility\ngenes remain the source of speculation, but differ-\nences in sodium sensitivity, cation transport, vascu-\nlar injury, insulin resistance or adrenergic activity\nhave been postulated as being important.23,25 In the\npresent analysis, blood pressure was corrected for\nbody-mass index, dietary calcium, dietary sodium,\ndietary potassium, poverty index and the use of anti-\nhypertensive drugs, but the relation between blood\npressure and blood lead remained significant in\nblacks. Though blood lead levels were lower in\nwhites, the overlap in blood lead levels between\nblacks and whites was large, so that it seems\nunlikely that there is a threshold value for an effect\nof lead on blood pressure that was exceeded in\nblacks but not in whites. Most likely, there is still\nunidentified confounding in blacks that is not taken\ninto account in our calculations.\nIn conclusion, there is no consistent relationship\nbetween blood pressure and blood lead in\n"
