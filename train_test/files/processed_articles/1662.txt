    "abstract": "Abstract\nTroubled sleep is a commonly cited consequence of adolescent drug use, but it has rarely been studied as a cause. Nor have\nthere been any studies of the extent to which sleep behavior can spread in social networks from person to person to\nperson. Here we map the social networks of 8,349 adolescents in order to study how sleep behavior spreads, how drug use\nbehavior spreads, and how a friend's sleep behavior influences one's own drug use. We find clusters of poor sleep behavior\nand drug use that extend up to four degrees of separation (to one's friends' friends' friends' friends) in the social network.\nProspective regression models show that being central in the network negatively influences future sleep outcomes, but not\nvice versa. Moreover, if a friend sleeps #7 hours, it increases the likelihood a person sleeps #7 hours by 11%. If a friend uses\nmarijuana, it increases the likelihood of marijuana use by 110%. Finally, the likelihood that an individual uses drugs increases\nby 19% when a friend sleeps #7 hours, and a mediation analysis shows that 20% of this effect results from the spread of\nsleep behavior from one person to another. This is the first study to suggest that the spread of one behavior in social\nnetworks influences the spread of another. The results indicate that interventions should focus on healthy sleep to prevent\ndrug use and targeting specific individuals may improve outcomes across the entire social network.\nCitation: Mednick SC, Christakis NA, Fowler JH (2010) The Spread of Sleep Loss Influences Drug Use in Adolescent Social Networks.

Fowler3\n1 Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America, 2 Department of Medicine, Harvard University, Boston,\nMassachusetts, United States of America, 3 Department of Political Science, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America\n Introduction\ntried marijuana at least once, and about 18% of 12th-graders were\ncurrent users in the United States [1]. Inability to sleep and\nexcessive sleepiness are often cited as primary warning signs and\nsymptoms of such teenage drug abuse [2]. The implication is that\ndrug abuse causes sleep problems. Indeed, in previous studies of\nadolescent use of opioids [3], alcohol [4], and marijuana [5,6,7,8],\nresearchers have generally assumed that the causal direction is\nfrom substance abuse to sleep problems.\nYet, one of the biggest adjustments affecting late adolescence is\nthe significant change in chronotype with the delay of the intrinsic\nsleep phase [9]. Coping with delayed sleep phase becomes\nproblematic for teens who need to wake up early for morning\nclasses, resulting in average weeknight sleep durations around\nneeded at this phase of their lives [11].\nSuch poor sleep might lead to drug use. According to one of the\nfew longitudinal studies, young teenagers with poor preschool\nsleep habits were more than twice as likely to use drugs, tobacco,\nor alcohol ten years later, even after controlling for issues such as\ndepression, aggression, attention problems and parental alcohol-\nism [12]. A more recent experimental study had teen subjects sleep\nfor two weeks in a long sleep condition (10 hr/night) and two\nweeks in a short-sleep condition (6.5 hr/night). Parents and teens\nboth reported that participants in the short sleep condition had\nmany more behavioral, cognitive, and emotional problems [13]. In\nturn, conduct problems are cited as one of a number of factors that\nprecede and correlate with substance use in teens [14].\nAlso relevant to adolescent drug use, however, are social\nfactors such as family and school functioning [15] and peer\npressure [16]. Adolescents are embedded in complex social\nnetworks and are especially vulnerable to peer effects, possibly\nnot only with respect to drugs but also with respect to sleep. An\nunexplored aspect of the connection between adolescent sleep\nand drug abuse is therefore the impact of social networks. Many\nbehaviors and affective states, including smoking [17], drinking\nhappiness [22], have recently been shown to spread through\nsocial networks among adults followed for many years. It seems\nlikely that both sleep habits and drug use could also spread\namong adolescents. If so, the two behaviors, as evinced among\nmembers of peer groups, might in turn influence each other\u00ad\nbetween individuals and not just within them.\nHere, we use nationally representative data to show that both\nsleep behavior and marijuana use spread through social networks\nand mediation analyses suggest that an adolescent's sleep behavior\ninfluences a friend's marijuana usage via the impact on the friend's\nsleep behavior. This set of relationships suggests that the causal\narrow points from sleep to drug use rather than the other way\naround.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe Add Health Data\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth) is a nationally-representative sample of students in grades\n7\u00ad12.[23] At the beginning of Wave I, researchers identified an\nstudents filled out questionnaires and named up to 5 male and 5\nfemale friends who were later identified from school-wide rosters\nto generate information about each school's complete social\nnetwork. A subset of this group was then chosen for in-depth\nadministered a longer questionnaire about their networks and\nhealth behavior from which we draw our information about sleep\nand drug use. The average age at inception of the group was 15.8\n(SD 1.6), and 51% were female; students averaged 7.8 hours of\nsleep per night (SD 1.4) and used marijuana an average of 1 time\n(SD 4.5) in the past month (see Text S1). We analyzed only Wave I\nand II data here, as, by Wave III, the subjects were no longer in\nschool.\nWe treat each friendship nomination as a ``directed tie'' from\nthe namer to the named friend. We call individuals who are the\nobjects of analysis ``egos'' and the people to whom they are\nconnected ``alters.'' Sleep was assessed by self-report at both waves\n(``How many hours of sleep do you usually get?''). Although the\nvalidity of self-report of sleep habits is controversial [24], one study\nof adolescents comparing self-report to actigraphy reported good\ncorrelation [25]. For most analyses, we dichotomize the sleep\nvariable by dividing the sample into those who get more than\n7 hours (62% of the sample at Wave I and 56% at Wave II) and\nthose who get 7 or less (38% and 44%, respectively).\nMarijuana use was also assessed by self-report at both waves\n(``During the past 30 days, how many times did you use\nmarijuana?''). Studies comparing self-report to biochemical\nassessments have shown high accuracy of self-report in tobacco-\nsmoking adults [26] and marijuana-using adolescents [27]. For\nmost analyses, we dichotomize the marijuana variable by dividing\nthe sample into those who used at least once (13% of the sample at\nWave I and 15% at Wave II) and those who did not use at all (87%\nand 85%, respectively). For analyses of the number of times used,\nwe truncate the maximum value to 30 (representing average usage\nof once a day).\nStatistical Analyses\nAn association in the behaviors of connected individuals can be\nattributed to at least three processes: 1) influence, whereby a\nbehavior in one person causes the behavior of others; 2) homophily,\nwhereby individuals with the same behaviors preferentially choose\none another as friends [23]; or 3) confounding, whereby connected\nindividuals jointly experience contemporaneous exposures (such as\na noisy neighbourhood or a local drug dealer). To distinguish\namong these effects requires repeated measures of sleep and drug\nuse [27], longitudinal information about network ties, and\ninformation about the nature or direction of the ties (e.g., who\nnominated whom as a friend).\nFor some analyses, we considered the prospective effect of social\nnetwork variables (such as network centrality\u00adwhich measures how\ncentral a person is in a network (see Text S1)) and friends' overall\nbehavior on ego's future sleep behavior and drug use. For other\nanalyses, we conducted regressions of ego sleep behavior or drug\nuse in Wave II as a function of ego's age, gender, race, ethnicity,\nhousehold income, parental education, and sleep or drug behavior\nin Wave I, and of the sleep or drug behavior of an alter in both\nWave II and Wave I. Inclusion of ego's behavior at Wave I helps\nto control for ego's genetic endowment and any intrinsic, stable\npredilection to engage in drug use or to sleep. Including alter's\nbehavior at Wave I helps control for homophily [23]. The key\ncoefficient in these models that measures the effect of influence is\nthe variable for alter's Wave II behavior [23].\nWe estimated both logit models (where we consider a\ndichotomous version of the outcome variable) and normal\nspecifications (where we consider a continuous version of the\nvariable [hours of sleep, number of uses of marijuana]). We use\ngeneralized estimating equation (GEE) procedures to account for\nmultiple observations of the same ego across ego-alter pairings\n[28] and we assume an independent working correlation structure\nfor the clusters [28]. Huber-White sandwich estimates with\nclustering on the egos yielded very similar results.\nThe GEE regression models in the tables provide parameter\nestimates in the form of beta coefficients, whereas the results\nreported in the text and figures are in the form of risk ratios. Mean\neffect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by\nsimulating the first difference in alter's Wave II behavior (changing\nfrom getting .7 hours of sleep to #7 hours of sleep, or from no\ndrug use to some drug use) using 1,000 randomly drawn sets of\nestimates from the coefficient covariance matrix and assuming all\nother variables are held at their means [28].\nWe evaluated the possibility of omitted variables or contempo-\nraneous events explaining the associations by examining how the\ntype or direction of the social relationship between ego and alter\naffects the association. If unobserved factors drive the association\nbetween ego and alter, then direction of friendship should not be\nrelevant. We also considered the possibility that school contextual\neffects may drive our results, and analyses (available in Text S1)\nshow that our results remain significant and effect sizes are similar\nin models that restrict observations to a single school. Finally, we\nperformed a mediation analysis in which we test the hypothesis\nthat alter's sleep influences ego's sleep which in turn has an effect\non ego's drug use (see Text S1 for more details) [29,30].\nResults\nSleep and Drug Behavior Associations Extend Up to Four\nDegrees of Separation\nFigure 1 shows the largest connected network component in the\nlargest school in Wave I, based on ties among friends (sibling ties\nare excluded to simplify the image). The clusters of poor sleep\n(#7 hrs) subjects seen in the network are significantly larger than\nexpected due to chance. Figure 2 shows that the association\nbetween ego and alter sleep is significant up to four degrees of\nseparation in both Wave I and Wave II. For example, in Wave I a\n#7 hours if a directly connected alter (distance 1) sleeps #7 hours.\nThe relationship for distance 2 alters (the friend of a friend, i.e. two\nFigure 2 also shows the results using the same procedure for drug\nuse marijuana if a directly connected alter (distance 1) uses\nmarijuana. The relationship for distance 2 alters is 88% (80% to\nNetwork Centrality and Future Sleep and Drug Use\nFigure 1 also suggests a relationship between network centrality,\nsleep, and drug use: subjects at the core of the networks appear to\nsleep less and to be more likely to use marijuana. We tested these\nSleep, Drugs, Social Networks\nrelationships more rigorously by computing network centrality for\neach subject (see Text S1). We found that centrality is significantly\nassociated with less sleep in the future: a two-standard-deviation\nincrease in centrality at Wave I increases the probability of\np = 0.03). This relationship between centrality and sleep is net of\ncontrols for age, race, ethnicity, household income, and mother's\neducation.\nIn contrast, we find no significant relationship between\ncentrality and drug use (see Text S1). We also considered the\npossibility of effects in the reverse direction, examining the impact\nof sleep and drug use in Wave I on network centrality in Wave II.\nWe find that neither sleep nor marijuana use has an effect on\nfuture network centrality. Thus, it appears that, in the case of\nsleep, it is the network structure that influences the behavioral\noutcome and not vice versa.\nSpread of a Single Behavior Across Time: Relationship\nBetween Alter Sleep and Drug Use and Ego Behaviors\nEgo sleep behavior in Wave II is associated with alter sleep\nbehavior in Wave I, as shown in Table 1. Notably, each additional\ncontact who sleeps #7 hours in Wave I increases the likelihood\nthe ego will sleep #7 hours in Wave II by 5% (95% CI: 1% to\n10%, p = 0.02). In a continuous model with hours of sleep as the\ndependent variable, the effect is also significant (p = 0.03). In\ncontrast to the spread of poor sleep behavior, the number of\ncontacts who sleep .7 hours has a weak but not-quite significant\n(p = 0.08) positive effect on an individual's sleep behavior.\nSimilarly, ego drug use in Wave II is associated with the number\nof contacts in Wave I who use drugs, as shown in Table 2. Each\nadditional drug-using friend increases the likelihood of use by 42%\ndrug-using friend increases the number of uses in the previous 30\naverage number of uses of 1.06. Non-drug-using friends also have\na negative effect on use, but the effect is smaller. Each non-using\nfriend decreases the likelihood of use by 10% (4% to 15%) and also\n0.17). In both models, the magnitude of the coefficient on the\nnumber of non-users is significantly smaller than the magnitude of\nthe coefficient on the number of users (p,0.001). Thus, like sleep\nbehavior, the spread of drug-using behavior exhibits an asymmetry\nFigure 1. Network graph. Figure 1 is a network graph of the largest component of friends in Wave I of the Add Health study (year 1995), from a\nsingle school. Each node represents a subject (there are 800 shown) and its shape denotes gender (circles are female, squares are male). Lines\nbetween nodes indicate relationships (arrows point from the naming friend to the named friend). Node colour denotes nightly sleep duration (red for\n6 hours or less, orange for 7 hours, white for 8 hours or more) and node size indicates frequency of marijuana use (the smallest nodes do not use\nmarijuana, the largest report using at least daily). The network suggests clustering of both sleep and drug use behavior, and as we show in the\nstatistical analysis, some of the overlap in clustering may result from a causal effect of sleep on drug use. Node placement is based on the Kamada-\nKawai algorithm (see Text S1) [50].\nSleep, Drugs, Social Networks\nthat suggests the negative health behavior is more contagious than\nthe positive health behavior.\nWe next examined how the actual behavior in ego's alters was\nassociated with ego's sleep behavior and drug use. Unlike the\nprospective models which evaluated the impact of the overall\ncount or number of a person's friends who behaved a particular\nway, these models look at ego-alter pairs and examine how a\nchange in behavior in each alter is associated with a change in\nbehavior in the ego. The models adjust for sex, age, race, ethnicity,\nhousehold income, parental education, and the ego's prior\nbehavior. Including alter's prior behavior helps control for the\nprocess of selecting friends based on their behaviors. However, our\nmain interest here is the impact of one person's behavior on the\nbehavior of others, which we estimate using the coefficient on\nFigure 2. Spread of sleep and drug use. Figure 2 shows that the association between ego and alter sleep is significant up to four degrees of\nseparation in both Wave I and Wave II. The left panel shows the percentage increase in the likelihood a person sleeps #7 hours if a friend at a certain\nsocial distance sleeps #7 hours. The right panel shows the percentage increase in the likelihood a person uses marijuana if a friend at a certain social\ndistance uses marijuana. The relationship is strongest between individuals who are directly connected, but it remains significantly greater than zero\nat social distances up to 4 degrees of separation in both Wave I and Wave II. Thus, a person's sleep and drug use behavior is associated with the same\nbehavior of other people up to 4 degrees removed from them in the network. Error bars are derived by comparing the conditional probability of the\nbehavior in the observed network with an identical network in which topology and incidence of the behavior is preserved but the assignment of the\nbehavior is randomly distributed [19,55 2008]. Alter social distance (degrees of separation) refers to closest social distance between the alter and ego\n(friend = distance 1, friend's friend = distance 2, etc.). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals.\nTable 1.

The finding that the results are\nrobust within a single school helps to mitigate this concern, but an\nadditional technique is to take advantage of the directionality of\nfriendships. Each person was asked to name their friends, but not\nall of these nominations were reciprocated. Therefore, we can\ndistinguish three possibilities: ego-perceived friends (denoted\n``friends''), ``alter-perceived friends'' (the alter named ego as a\nfriend, but not vice versa), and ``mutual friends'' (ego and alter\nnominated each other). If the association between ego and alter is\ndriven by a shared exposure (such as a local drug dealer), we would\nexpect the effects to be equally strong in each of these types of\nrelations. But if the association is due to influence, then we would\nexpect ego-perceived friends to be more influential then alter-\nperceived friends, since, in the latter case, the ego may not even\nknow a person who has named them as a friend. Moreover, we\nexpect mutual friends to be the most influential.\nIn Figure 3, we show that the effect of alter-perceived friends on\nsleep is not significant (p = 0.35) and on drug use is marginally\nTable 2.

The\nresults suggest that both drug use and non-use may spread, but the spread of use is significantly stronger.\nFigure 3. Influence of friends and siblings. Figure 3 shows that friends and siblings significantly influence drug use and sleep behavior.

Moreover, mutual friends exhibit\nthe strongest associations. A mutual friend who sleeps #7 hours\nincreases the likelihood the ego sleeps #7 hours by 20% (4% to\n37%) and a mutual friend who starts using marijuana more than\ntriples the risk that the ego uses marijuana (218% increase,117% to\n345%). These results suggest that at least part of the association\nbetween ego and alter behavior is due to influence.\nFinally, a sibling who sleeps #7 hours increases the likelihood\nwho starts using marijuana increases the likelihood the ego uses by\nfriends, sibling relationships are all mutual, so we cannot use\ndirectionality to test whether these associations result from\ninfluence, shared genes, or a shared home environment. We\npresent results for siblings primarily for comparison to the friend\neffects.\nMediation Effects Between Sleep and Drug Use\nIn Table 3, we present the results of a mediation analysis in\nwhich the hypothesized causal pathway is that a friend's sleep\nbehavior can spread to the ego, and the resulting change in ego's\nsleep behavior can also affect ego's drug-using behavior, net of any\npredilection to form friendships based on sleep, drug use, or other\nfactors. The results show that when a friend sleeps #7 hours it\nincreases the likelihood that the ego will use marijuana by 19%\nbaseline analyses described above, alter's sleep behavior is\nsignificantly associated with ego's sleep behavior (p = 0.001), and\nego's marijuana use is significantly associated with ego's sleep\nbehavior, controlling for alter's sleep behavior (p = 0.001). When\nwe estimate the size of the mediated effect, we find that when a\nfriend sleeps #7 hours, it increases the likelihood that the ego will\nuse marijuana by 4% (1% to 7%) via its impact on ego's sleep\nbehavior. This represents approximately 20% of the total effect of\nalter sleep on ego drug use. It is important to note that this effect is\nadditive; each additional friend who sleeps poorly also significantly\nincreases drug use by the same amount.\nFinally, we also tested the hypothesis that the relationship\nbetween alter sleep and ego drug use is mediated by the spread of\ndrug use, rather than sleep. While the coefficients are all at least\nmarginally significant in the individual models (see Text S1), the\nmediated effect is not. We also reversed the direction of the\nhypothesis and studied whether alter's drug use influences ego's\nsleep behavior, via either the spread of drug use or the spread of\nsleep behavior. In neither case did we find a significant direct\nassociation (see Text S1), suggesting the causal pathway is from\nsleep to drugs and not the other way around.\nDiscussion\nFigure 4 summarizes the main findings. The evidence suggests\nthat poor sleep leads to drug use in adolescents, and that both sleep\nand drug use spread through social networks. We show (for the\nfirst time, to our knowledge) a mediation effect in which the spread\nof one health behavior affects the spread of another. Specifically, a\nperson's risk of drug use increases if his friends sleep poorly, and\nthis effect is mediated in part by the spread of poor sleep behavior\nfrom one person to another.\nTable 3. Ego sleep mediates relationship between alter sleep and ego drug use.\nDependent Variable:\nEgo Currently\nUses Marijuana\nEgo Currently\nSleeps #7 Hours\nEgo Currently\nUses Marijuana\nCoef SE p Coef SE p Coef SE p\nTable 3 shows mediation effect of sleep on drug use. First three columns show logistic regression model of ego's marijuana use behavior (the outcome variable) on\nalter's sleep behavior (the explanatory variable). Second three columns show logistic regression model of ego's sleep behavior (the mediator variable) on alter's sleep\nbehavior (the explanatory variable). Last three columns show logistic regression model of ego's marijuana use behavior (the outcome variable) on ego's sleep behavior\n(the mediator variable) controlling for alter's sleep behavior (the explanatory variable). Models were estimated using a general estimating equation with clustering on\nthe ego and an independent working covariance structure. Models with an exchangeable correlation structure yielded poorer fit. Fit statistics show sum of squared\ndeviance between predicted and observed values for the model and a null model with no covariates. A bootstrap procedure that takes into account uncertainty of both\nthe effect of the independent variable on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome variable shows that when an alter starts sleeping #7 hours, it increases the\nlikelihood of ego drug use by 4% (95% C.I. 1% to 7%) via its effect on the mediator (ego sleep), which represents approximately 20% of the total effect of alter sleep on\nego drug use.\nSleep, Drugs, Social Networks\nIt is well known that both sleep and drug use can be\ninfluenced by social pressure [31], [32]. But behaviors do not\nexist in isolation: one behavior can influence another both\nwithin and between individuals. Hence, beyond social influence,\nthe present study is the first to consider the coevolution of two\nspreading processes on a fully observed network. By tracking\nsubjects over time, our data show not only the pattern of growth\nof two independent health behaviors, but go further to reveal a\nmechanism by which one may encourage another. One possible\nexplanation for our results may be the effect of poor sleep on\ndecision-making and behavior regulation. Poor sleep in\nadolescents has been shown to decrease behavior regulation,\nincluding impulse control, emotion regulation, and behavioral\nflexibility [13], as well as health-risk behaviours, such as\nsuicidality and substance use [33], and poor school performance\nThe present study was limited to survey questions gathered\nabout marijuana use. It is common, however, for marijuana to act\nas a `gateway' increasing risk for youth to progress to other, more\nserious drugs [35,36]. The National Center on Addiction and\nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University recently reported that\nnearly half of full-time students binge drink and/or abuse\nprescription opioids, or pain killers, increased 343%; abuse of\nprescription tranquilizers such as Xanax and Valium rose 450%;\nand abuse of prescription stimulants such as Adderall was up\n93.3%. The present study was unable to account for the effect of\nother substance use on an individual's sleep patterns, or the\nprogression of friends' substance use on the network. Examination\nof the spread of other substances, such as amphetamines that are\nknown to disrupt sleep, would be a natural extension of the present\nfindings.\nWe also show a number of novel network effects. In contrast\nto prior studies that showed associations in behaviors and\naffective states extending up to three degrees of separation\ndegrees for both sleep and drug use. We also show that people with\nhigh network centrality are at greater risk of poor sleep, which in\nturn affects drug use. This is consistent with the finding that\nnegative outcomes for both sleep and drug use spread more\nreliably than positive ones; more centrally located individuals are\nin a structural location that makes them more susceptible to\nbehavioral contagions, since they sit at a sort of ``crossroads'' in the\nnetwork.\nThese results pave the way for further analysis of other negative\nhealth outcomes that may be mediated by sleep, such as alcohol\nuse. It is likely that the negative effects of poor sleep that lead an\nadolescent to try marijuana would influence decisions to try\nalcohol in similar ways. We also hypothesize that behaviors that\nhave already been shown to spread through social networks, such\nas obesity [19], drinking [18], and smoking [17], may be good\ncandidates for such a mediation analysis. And, apart from sleep,\nthese data suggest a way forward in identifying the causal processes\nthat underlie important behavioral contagions. For example, we\ncould use the same methodology to study whether the spread of\neating certain types of food (like junk food) mediates the spread of\nOur findings suggest a number of directions that might help\npolicy-makers and researchers to improve anti-drug campaigns.\nFirst, efforts to increase sleep in adolescents may help to reduce\nsubstance use in this population. Although the present findings\nshow that poor sleep behavior has a stronger influence on the\nnetwork compared to good sleep behavior, lessening the influence\nof poor sleep behavior may be an effective mechanism for\ndecreasing substance use. One possible intervention would be a\nnapping program during or after school. Napping has been shown\nin young adults [45]. Helping adolescents to get more nocturnal\nsleep may be challenging. Although the present analysis did not\nexamine morning rise time (the information was not available),\nfuture studies should investigate whether the majority of\nadolescents who are vulnerable to the negative consequences of\nsleep loss for drug use also have the greatest level of delayed sleep\nphase. Perhaps, for these individuals, a systematic daytime sleep\nregimen would be advisable, and the results reported here suggest\nthat benefits of such an intervention could spread to influence\nfriends.\nOur results also show that adolescents who are most centrally\nlocated in the social network are not only more influential but\nalso the most vulnerable to poor health outcomes. This suggests\nthat anti-drug interventions targeting central individuals may be\nmore effective for reducing drug use across the whole network.\nIn the same vein, sleep interventions may benefit from targeting\nindividuals who are more central to the network, and such\ninterventions could spill over and help reduce drug use in many\nother individuals. Studies of vaccinations have shown a linear\neffect between success of vaccination and number of connec-\ntions [46]. Furthermore, costs of interventions can be reduced\nsubstantially when more central individuals are treated [47].\nTargeted sleep interventions might be similarly effective,\nhelping to immunize a whole population against drug use.\nPeople are connected, and so their health behaviors are\nconnected.\nSupporting Information\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: SCM JF.
