We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical\nstructure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved `district' and `com-\nmunity' characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth\nregistration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences\nshare a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of\nbirth registration in India. At individual child level, mother's socio-economic status such as\nher ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly\nraise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the\nmaternal autonomy indicators: mother's ability to move around freely and her control over\nresources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institu-\ntional birth, mother's antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth\nand parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.\n1.

[4\u00ad7]. . .. . . to Counting Births and Deaths\n[3, 8\u00ad10] that established the CRVS system as a necessary component of SDG.\nGlobally 230 million children under the age of five have never been recorded. More than\nhalf (59%) live in Asia, and an estimated 71 million\u00adone in three, live in India. Many barriers\nprevent people from registering births and deaths. There are countries that do not have the\nnecessary system in place to make births and deaths registration mandatory whereas in other\ncountries only urban people have access to registration services. India has started its own\nCRVS improvement initiatives and introduced the requisite legislative and administrative\nreforms to improve civil registration. As a result, birth registration coverage increased from\ndecades, there has been significant emphasis on promoting access to Maternal and Child\nHealth (MCH) services in India while similar emphasis on completing birth registration has\nbeen lacking. In the SDG era, where the goal is to promote access and equitable health for all\nthrough Universal Health Coverage (UHC), universal birth registration needs to be prioritised.\nFagernas and Odame (2013) [11] note that birth registration systems would be useful in track-\ning progress towards health-related goals.\nThere is little empirical research so far to identify at individual birth and death registration\nlevel--what exactly hinders the registration process in India. This paper is an important first\nstep that examines the individual, household, community and district level determinants of\nbirth registration using a multilevel hierarchical mixed model. In India, the process of birth\nregistration is based on informant reporting structure, where the primary responsibility lies on\nindividual informants who report birth. It can be the head of the household in case of home\nevents and institutional heads in case of institutional deliveries. Under such circumstances,\nwhere only 13% (84%) of pregnant women in the poorest (the richest) population quintile\ndelivered in health facilities in 2005 [12, 13], it is important to focus on the relative significance\nof individual, household, community and district level enabling factors in determining the reg-\nistration of a birth.\nThis paper analyses `if independent and informed mothers are more likely to register their\nchildren in India'. Many mothers lack the knowledge on how to register a child's birth [2] and\nconsequently are unaware of what it entails and delivers to their child. The status of birth regis-\ntration would significantly improve across the world if women were educated, well informed\nand independent given their role as primary caregivers for children. However, women con-\ntinue to have little household decision-making authority in many developing countries includ-\ning India. Improvements in maternal socio-economic status have been strongly linked in the\nliterature to better educational and demographic outcomes, improved child welfare and alloca-\nmothers with some schooling are more likely to know how to register a child than their unedu-\ncated peers. In India, birth registration levels increase with mothers' education.\n2. Methods\n2.1 Study design and data source\nWe used the latest round of the India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011\u00ad12 for\nour analysis. IHDS-II is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey of 42,152 households in\n1,503 villages and 971 urban neighbourhoods across India. The survey collects a wide range of\ninformation on household health, education, employment, economic status, marriage, fertility,\ngender relations, social capital, village infrastructure, wage levels, and panchayat composition.\nIHDS-II is the most up-to-date household survey available on India. Also, it contains a com-\nprehensive set of information on gender relations and women status in the household such as\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nFunding: The authors received no specific funding\nfor this work.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\ntheir autonomy, ability, freedom, exposure to information and bargaining power that allows\nus the unique opportunity to study the relationship between these variables and child birth\nregistration in India.\ndistricts and 2189 villages/neighborhoods. India is a large country with 31 states and 5 union\nterritories. Those are subdivided into 686 districts and districts into a few more layers of\nadministrative units. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care is implemented through the\nDepartment of Family Welfare (DFW) mostly at the district and sub-district levels through dif-\nferent levels of health care delivery systems e.g. Subcentres (SCs), Primary Health Centres\n(PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals. Previous studies have\nfound significant disparities in MCH service coverage and efficiency differences in service\ndelivery across districts in India [19, 20]. Therefore, along with individual and household level\ncharacteristics, we have considered villages/neighborhoods and districts as the other two\nhigher levels of analysis in a mixed effects hierarchical model as policies and service provisions\nat these levels might influence birth registration. We have included state level covariates at the\nindividual level analysis.\nWe use multilevel models to take account of the hierarchical or clustered structure of the data.\nFor example, children who live in the same household are more likely to have similar outcomes\nfor birth registration than children randomly chosen from the population at large. Households\nare further nested within communities with children living in the same communities facing\nthe same set of cultural and institutional barriers and enabling factors for birth registration\nthan those living in other communities. Communities are also nested within higher adminis-\ntrative units such as districts with children living in the same districts likely to share similar\npolicy and health care infrastructure than those living in other districts. However, our analysis\ndoes not consider multiple children from the same household because the birth registration\ninformation in the data pertains to the mother's last birth only [21\u00ad24].\nOur dependent variable in the study is a binary response variable with a value 1 `if the child\nhas a birth certificate' and 0 otherwise. It is based on the survey response to the question `if the\nmother possesses a birth certificate for her last birth that occurred in the last 5 years (i.e. since\nOur explanatory variables are grouped into three levels to reflect the hierarchical nature of\nthe data. Level 1 variables correspond to child/household/maternal characteristics with com-\nmunity and state level contextual covariates. Level 2 variables correspond to community as a\nrandom effect and community/village level characteristics as random slopes and Level 3 corre-\nsponds to district as a random effect and some of child level maternal characteristics as ran-\ndom slopes. We run a three level mixed effects random slope logit model.\nWe started our estimation by running two mixed effects logit null models with no covari-\nates [24]. The first null model introduces a random intercept component at Level 3 (district\nlevel) while the second introduces an additional random intercept term at Level 2 (community\nlevel). Then, we introduce state, community, maternal, household and child level covariates\nwith one slope coefficient at Level 2 and two slope coefficients at Level 3 in a step wise manner\nfollowing forward selection in a three level mixed effects random slope logit model. The aim\nhere is to study any variations in the null models that were due to each of the confounding\nfactors.\nThe corresponding equations for the two null and full mixed effect models are presented\nbelow [24]. The first null model, a mixed effects binary response logit model with a random\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nintercept component at the Level 3 (district level) can be represented as\nlogit\u00f0y\nik\nv\nk\nThe latent variable formulation is\ny\u00c3\nik\n\u00bc b\n\u00fe e\nik\nWhere, yik\nis the outcome variable for whether the ith child in the kth district has a birth certifi-\nthe overall sample mean, v0k\nthe district level random intercept\u00adit is the effect of being\nin district k on the log-odds that y = 1, 2 the district level (residual) variance, or the between-\ndistrict variance on the log-odds that y = 1, and eik\nthe individual level residuals.

The factors associated with the utilisation of MCH\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nrelated services (such as prenatal, delivery and postnatal services) are unlikely to be different\nfrom those that influence birth registration decision in the period following the birth of a\nchild. The literature identifies a number of factors that are associated with the utilisation of\nsuch services including: lack of education (i.e., mother's and husband's education level); lack\nof decision-making authority (i.e., women's authority and autonomy); socio-economic barri-\ners (i.e., low household living standards, low household income, no insurance coverage); social\nclass structure and religion (i.e., religion and caste of the household); limited access to health-\ncare facilities (i.e., transportation); geographical location (i.e., distance to health care facilities);\nand lack or shortage of trained and skilled health care professionals (i.e., capacity and knowl-\nedge of skilled health care professionals) [25].\nSome recent studies on determinants of birth registration have highlighted the association\nbetween child, household and community level sociodemographic and economic factors and\nbirth registration. Amo-Adjei and Annim (2015) [26] find that mother's education, household\nwealth and urban residence are positively associated with the likelihood that a child is regis-\ntered in Ghana. Religion is also found to be a significant determinant of birth registration with\nchildren whose parents practice a traditional religion at a significant risk of not being regis-\ntered. There is also evidence of significant regional effect with children from eastern region of\nGhana less likely to be registered [26]. Okunlola et al. (2017) [27] similarly find that birth regis-\ntration increases with household wealth index and educational attainment of the mother in\nNigeria. It is also noted that lack of access to registration services and indirect costs associated\nwith registration contribute to low birth registration. According to Chereni (2016) [28], social\nand cultural factors are equally important in influencing birth registration as economic factors\nin Zimbabwe. And birth registration is viewed as an outcome that results from the interaction\nbetween economic, non-economic, personal and structural factors. Isare and Atimati (2015)\n[29] advocate for a community based approach where birth registration centers are established\nwithin communities to increase accessibility and awareness about the benefits of birth registra-\ntion. Our study controls for a comprehensive list of variables associated with birth registration\nin the wider literature and in India (in particular) [25].\nAs noted above, our explanatory variables are grouped into three levels. The variables at\nLevel 1 correspond to child/household/maternal characteristics with village/community level\nand state level contextual covariates. The child level attributes include--child's age as a contin-\nuous variable and dummy variables representing institutional/non-institutional place of birth\nand gender of the child. Parental level attributes included are--mother's age and educational\nlevel of both parents as continuous variables, and categorical variables representing mother's\nself-assessed health status. Mother's migrant status representing mother's childhood place of\nresidence (i.e. if the mother's natal family resides in the same village/town or another) and\nmother's Ante Natal Care (ANC) seeking behavior, in particular, if the mother had four or\nmore ANC visits during her last pregnancy are also included. We have also included a variable\nrepresenting the proportion of children who have died out of the total children ever born to\nthe mother at the time of the survey.\nMore importantly, we have included a wide range of variables representing gender relations\nand mother's social and economic status in the household such as mother's role in household\ndecision making, her control over household resources, her ability to independently visit\nplaces of need, her freedom of movement and bargaining capacity in the household. Under-\nstanding how women's autonomy, ability and freedom at the household level are associated\nwith birth registration and how factors at the community or higher sociopolitical level (such as\ndistricts) moderate this relationship is an important contribution of this research. Previous\nstudies have highlighted the positive influence of maternal autonomy on feeding practice,\nbirth weight and infant growth in India [30 \u00ad32]. It is also noted in the literature that maternal\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nautonomy could increase self-motivation and bring about behavioral change that would\nimprove the welfare of the mother and her family. A systematic review by Upadhyay et al.\n(2014) [33] finds a positive association between women's empowerment and lower fertility,\nlonger birth intervals, and lower rates of unintended pregnancy.\nMethodologically, Upadhyay et al. (2014) [33] highlighted the importance of choosing\nappropriate measures that better approximate women's empowerment. It was further noted\nthat studies that used multiple and multidimensional measures of empowerment were more\nlikely to find consistent results. Shroff et al. (2011) [31] conducted a confirmatory factor\nanalysis to develop multiple dimensions of maternal autonomy. They find that individual\ndimensions of autonomy could operate differently to influence child growth and wellbeing.\nAccordingly, we identified 20 variables in our dataset that described mother's autonomy, abil-\nity, freedom, exposure to information/other resources and bargaining power in the household\n[32, 34, 35] and conducted factor analysis to summarize and identify any common underlying\ntheme. Our analysis clearly identified four different underlying constructs or factors in these\nvariables and depending on the nature and category of the variables clubbing under each of\nthese factors we have named Factor 1 as `Mother's Autonomy', Factor 2 as `Mother's Ability',\nFactor 3 as `Mother's Freedom in Movement' and Factor 4 as Mother's Bargaining Capacity.\nHowever, three variables that we identify as mother's exposure to outside world did not group\ninto any of these four factors and we have decided to include them independently in the\nmodel. The set of variables grouped under each factor, their rotated factor loadings (pattern\nmatrix), unique variances and the three independent mother's exposure variables are listed in\nTable 1 below.\nThe household level variables that we control for include urban-rural residence, household\nwealth status captured using wealth quintiles, caste and religious affiliation of the household.\nWe also control for state level contextual covariates in our regression:--health expenditure as a\npercentage of Net State Domestic Product (NSDP), per capita public expenditure on health, lit-\neracy rate, gross enrolment rate, infant mortality rate and a dummy variable identifying the\nlow-income states in India. The state level variables were all extracted from the Economic Sur-\nAt Level 2, we have controlled for the community/village level random effects and a random\nslope for proportion of institutional births in the village. Additionally, village/community\nlevel variables are included as Level 1 contextual covariates in the model. These include village/\ncommunity level mean years of schooling, proportion of institutional births and quintiles of\nmedian per capita household consumption expenditures. Given that IHDS-II used cluster\nsampling, all community level variables were created by aggregating relevant individual survey\nresponses at the clusters.\nAt Level 3, we have controlled for the district level random effects and random slopes for\ntwo maternal socio-economic status summary variables representing Mother's Autonomy and\nAbility. Previous studies have highlighted the need to account for the influence of communities\nand broader socio-political environment on women's empowerment. It is documented that an\nindividual woman's empowerment process is simultaneously shaped by individual, social, cul-\ntural and political forces [34]. This calls for multilevel modelling to analyse the complex interac-\ntions between women empowerment measures at individual and at higher than the individual\nlevel [33, 38]. All continuous variables in our model are centered at their mean values.\n2.4 Descriptive statistics\nA summary statistics of the variables is presented in Table 2. Table 2 shows that over 62 per\ncent of children in our sample have birth certificates. The average age of children is 2.19 years\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nand 55 percent are male. Also, over 71 percent of children in the sample were born in an\ninstitution.\nMothers' characteristics reveal that the average mother is 28 years of age and had received\naround 6 years of schooling. Moreover, over 80 percent of mothers self-assess their health sta-\ntus as good or very good. Only 45 percent of mothers have received the recommended 4 and\nabove ANC check-ups during their last pregnancy. The summary statistics of the mother's\nsocio-economic status related factor variables\u00adnamely, mother's autonomy, mother's ability,\nmother's freedom of movement and mother's bargaining capacity are presented in the table.\nIn addition, the variables representing mother's exposure to the outside world reveal 29 per\ncent of mothers in the sample have been to a metropolitan city, another state or abroad in the\npast five years. In contrast, a larger proportion--about 62 percent--state that they have gone\nout on family outings while 57 percent maintain that they often engage in discussions with\ntheir husbands on various topics including work, community and politics.\nTable 1.

Discussion of results\nWe have estimated a couple of null models in the beginning. The first null model is estimated\nwith only district-level random effects and the second null model with both district-level\nand village/community level random effects. The results from these models are presented in\nTable 3. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in model 1 indicates that 46.7 percent of\nTable 2.

Null models: With District Effects (Model 1) and District and Community Effects (Model 2).\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nthe total variation in birth registration in India lies between districts while the remaining 53.3\npercent lies within-districts. Fig 1 below shows a caterpillar plot of the residuals for all 367 dis-\ntricts in the sample from model 1 together with 95% confidence intervals. For a substantial\nnumber of districts, the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with the horizontal line at\nzero, indicating that birth registration coverage in these districts is significantly above average\n(above the zero line) or below average (below the zero line) [Also see 24].\nAs within-district differences account for most of the variation in birth registration, we\nlooked at the effect of village/community level differences within districts on birth registration\nin model 2. The ICC from model 2 indicates that 44 percent of the variation in birth registra-\ntion is explained by between district differences while between community differences account\nfor 11 percent and within community differences for 45 percent of the variation.\nAs noted above, within-community differences [i.e. differences at the household and indi-\nvidual level] account for most of the variation in birth registration within-districts. We, there-\nfore, estimate a comprehensive model which controls for household and individual child level\ncovariates at level 1 including mother's social and economic status, state and community level\ncontextual characteristics. We also allow for two random slopes at the district level for moth-\ner's social and economic status indicators\u00adnamely, mother's autonomy and mother's ability. A\nrandom slope at the community level is also included for `proportion of institutional delivery\nat the village level'. The results from estimation of this model are shown in Table 4.\nOur primary focus of analysis in this paper is the variables representing mother's social and\neconomic status and bargaining power in the household. The summary variable (estimated\nusing factor analysis) representing `mother's ability' is significantly associated with birth regis-\ntration. Mothers that are able to visit health centres, friends/relatives, a local shop or travel\nshort distance by train/bus on their own are more likely to have their children registered. This\nvariable reflects the mother's capacity to leave the house unaccompanied and move around\nFig 1.

Higher maternal mobility is related to greater decision-making\nability within the household [39]. As primary caregivers for children, mothers' ability to move\naround is crucial for a number of activities that enhance the welfare of children such as immu-\nnisation, health check-ups, and possibly birth registration [40]. A mother who is capable of\nmoving around on her own can also register the birth of her children without depending on\nthe husband. We can also see that the random slope coefficient for `mother's ability' [included\nat the district level] is statistically significant. This shows that the marginal effect of `mother's\nability' on birth registration is not constant but varies across Indian districts. Moreover, the\nnegative covariance estimate between the intercept and mother's ability variable indicates that\ndistricts with above average birth registration tend to have a flatter than average slope or below\naverage effects of maternal ability.\nWe also find that two other variables which represent mother's exposure to outside world\u00ad\nnamely, whether the mother had been to a metro/another state/abroad in the last 5 years; and\nwhether she had gone out on family outings- are significant determinants of birth registration.\nIn particular, having a mother who had been to a metro/another state/abroad increases the\nodds of birth registration by a factor of 1.18. A mother travelling to another state or abroad sig-\nnifies [that she enjoys] more autonomy in the household [39]. And undertaking such travels\npresent the opportunity to interact with various people and come across different ideas that\ncould enhance the wellbeing of children. Similarly, having a mother that had gone out on\nfamily outings to cinemas or restaurants increases the odds of birth registration by a factor of\n1.14, which is probably reflecting an already empowered mother with a relatively higher bar-\ngaining power in the household or ability to positively influence decisions concerning children\n[including that of birth registration].\nAdditionally, we had included a random slope coefficient for `mother's autonomy' at the\ndistrict level. The `mother's autonomy' variable shows mother's decision-making power on\nissues such as purchase of property/land, wedding expenses, what to do if a child falls sick and\nwhom the child should marry. A mother that enjoys a greater degree of `autonomy' would\nhave greater access and control over economic resources in the household. It is documented in\nthe literature that autonomous mothers would allocate more resources towards their children\n[41, 42]. Thus, mothers with control over resources would be more likely to register their chil-\ndren by bearing the direct and indirect costs that might be involved in the birth registration\nprocess. The random slope coefficient for this maternal autonomy variable at district level has\ncome out as statistically significant indicating that the marginal effect of this variable signifi-\ncantly varies across districts. It may be reflecting the extent of regional diversity in gender rela-\ntions in India. Previous studies have shown significant spatial and socio-cultural differences in\nvarious dimensions of women's empowerment across regions in India [43]. For example, it\nhas been argued that women in South India have more voice in family life, more freedom of\nmovement and exposure to the outside world than their counterparts in North India [44].\nGutpa and Yesudian (2006) [43], on the other hand, found that states situated in central part\nof India (such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa) had low\nempowerment of women. Given the spatial (and socio-cultural) differences in India, our find-\nings highlight that policy initiatives to increase birth registration (or even women's autonomy\nfor that matter) should be designed by taking district (regional) idiosyncrasies into account.\nAmong the child specific factors included in the regression, place of birth of child is statisti-\ncally significant. The odds of birth registration increase by a factor of 4.6 for a child who has\nhad an institutional birth. We can also see that institutional delivery has one of the largest\nimpacts on the likelihood of birth registration in our model. The high likelihood of registration\nfor institutionally delivered children can be attributed to the fact that the reporting of such\nbirths to the `Registrar of Births and Deaths' is the responsibility of the medical officer in\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\ncharge. More importantly, medical officers who attend the birth of a child are obligated to\nreport the incidence to the Registrar [45]. Brito et.al (2013) [46] also find high probability of\nregistration for institutionally delivered children in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our\nresults do not show any significant difference in the odds of birth registration between boys\nand girls. A multivariate analysis by UNICEF (2005) [47] identifying the determinants of birth\nregistration across 63 countries also concluded that gender is insignificant. Age of child is\nanother significant determinant with the odds of registration increasing with age. Turning to\nthe household and other mother level factors in our model, we see that parental education is\npositively associated with the likelihood of birth registration. An increase in the mother's\n(father's) years of schooling by one year raises the odds that a child will get registered by a fac-\ntor of 1.05 (1.03). The positive association between maternal education and birth registration\ngate the transmission channels through which maternal education affects child outcomes, in\nparticular their academic achievement. One channel explored is social capital with educated\nmothers more likely to be part of a social network of other educated people who possess the\nknowledge, skills and resources beneficial for children. Thus, educated mothers can be\nexpected to receive valuable information and advice on various aspects of a child's life [includ-\ning the benefits of birth registration]. The positive effect of father's education may also be a\nresult of similar benefits from father's social capital.\nMother's number of antenatal visits at last pregnancy is another significant variable posi-\ntively associated with birth registration. The odds of birth registration for mothers who have\nhad four or more antenatal check-ups is 2.18 times that of mothers who have had no check-up.\nAntenatal care provides pregnant women with education, counselling, screening and treat-\nment to ensure mother and foetus remain in good health [49]. Moreover, antenatal visits\nwould increase the mother's awareness of what to expect after the birth of a child by providing\ninformation on postpartum care, including breastfeeding, immunisation, and (quite possibly)\nthe importance of birth registration [50].\nOur results also indicate that household wealth is significantly associated with birth regis-\ntration. The odds of birth registration for households in the top wealth quintile is 1.49 times\nthat of households in the bottom quintile. Other cross-country studies have also established\nthe positive impact of wealth status on birth registration [2, 47]. This might be capturing the\npossibility that households in lower wealth quintiles are put off birth registration by the late fee\nthat applies for children not registered within 21 days of birth. Office of the Registrar General\n(2010) [45] also notes that births not registered after 30 days but within a year can be registered\non production of an affidavit and permission from the prescribed authority on top of the pre-\nscribed late fee. Amo-Adjei and Annim (2015) [26] had demonstrated that late fee was a bar-\nrier for registration in Ghana. There might also be indirect costs such as cost of transportation\nor income lost due to time away from work which might hinder poorer households from hav-\ning their children registered [2]. Also, it might simply be the fact that poor households fail to\nrealise the long term benefits of registering their child birth.\nMoreover, the dummy variable for religious background shows that the odds of birth regis-\ntration for a child born in a Muslim family is 0.80 times that of a child born in a Hindu family.\nThe public health literature in India which has examined the Hindu-Muslim differences in fer-\ntility planning may shed some light into this result. There are studies that indicate higher level\nof unmet need for family planning among Muslims [51]. Singh et. al (2012) [52] also find that\nutilisation of safe delivery care was significantly lower among Muslim women than women\nfrom other religions in India. It has also been pointed out that mistrust of government family\nplanning programs and clinics may prevent Muslims from availing themselves of family plan-\nning services [51]. In another context, Hussain et. al (2014) [53] attribute the significant\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nHindu-Muslim disparity in the incidence of Polio to Muslim mistrust of the Polio eradication\nprogram in India, which in his view may be rooted in the socio-political and historical context\nof the country. Similar factors may be at play here making Muslims less likely to register their\nchildren than Hindus.\nWe also find that a child belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) or\nother castes has a lower probability of registration compared to the Forward/General castes.\nSince India's independence in 1947 the social caste structure has been identified as a significant\nhindrance for the socioeconomic development of minority groups. Despite government effort\nto empower lower caste groups and minorities, significant disparities across all indicators of\ndevelopment continue to exist. Studies indicate that social caste structure in India is a signifi-\ncant predictor for safe delivery and post-natal care utilization with women from Scheduled\nCastes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) less likely to access such services [52]. Thus, it is not\nsurprising that we also find women from these minority groups are less likely to register their\nchildren given their less inclination to access post-natal and other services. Nevertheless, fur-\nther research needs to establish whether this is due to some cultural practice or lack of proper\nknowledge or awareness in these communities. There is similar evidence from Ghana that\nmembers of minority ethnic or religious groups are less likely to register compared to majori-\nAmong the community level factors included in our model, mean years of schooling and\nproportion of institutional delivery come out as significant. An increase in mean years of\nschooling by one year is associated with 1.1-fold increase in the odds of birth registration.\nThus, education is important not only at the household level but also at the community level.\nLiving in a community with a higher proportion of institutional births also raises the probabil-\nity of birth registration. These results point out that there are advantages that spill over to the\nindividual/household from living in a community with high mean years of schooling and insti-\ntutional delivery. We have included a random slope coefficient for proportion of institutional\ndelivery at community level to allow for the effect of this variable (on birth registration) to vary\nacross communities in India but this didn't come out as significant.\nLiving in non-low income states has the largest positive effect on birth registration in our\nregression. The odds of birth registration for a child living in a non-low income state is 9.2\ntimes that of a child living in low income state. This might be reflecting the poor state of health\nand other infrastructure leading to poor service delivery in low income states in India. Chotia\nand Rao (2015) [54] note that `. . ..low income (BIMARU) states. . .. . .still lack basic health\ninfrastructure in many of their villages and towns leading to low positions in health index\nrankings'. The gross enrolment ratio at the state level is also significant and is associated with a\nhigher birth registration. However, health expenditure as percentage of state GDP negatively\naffects birth registration. This result might be capturing the possibility that national birth cer-\ntificate campaigns to raise birth registration in India may have largely targeted those states\nwhere health expenditure as a percentage of GDP is lower.\n4. Conclusion\nThis paper examines the determinants of birth registration in India using a multilevel hierar-\nchical mixed model. In particular, we looked at mother's autonomy, ability and bargaining\npower within the household and its significance for child birth registration. The rationale\nbehind using a multilevel mixed effects model is the hierarchical nature of the data in that\nchild and households are nested within communities, which in turn are nested within districts.\nThe estimation results provide us with useful policy implications to increase birth registration\nin India. Our results show that 45 percent of the variation in birth registration in India lies\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nbetween individual level differences and 44 percent lies between district level differences and\nremaining 11 percent lies between community level differences. This brings the policy focus\non individuals and districts for targeting birth registration. At individual level the results indi-\ncate that the summary variable representing mother's ability increases the probability of birth\nregistration. Ability to move around independently is an important trait for the mothers\nbecause such mothers do not have to wait for their husbands to take their children for immu-\nnisation, health check-ups, birth registration. . .etc. Two variables representing mother's expo-\nsure to outside world [i.e. whether the mother had been to a metro/another state/abroad in the\nlast 5 years; and whether she had gone out on family outings] are also significant. So, mothers\nthat have better bargaining power in the household and are exposed to liberating and progres-\nsive ideas from their surrounding that they could use to advance children's welfare are more\nlikely to register the birth of their children. Again, random slopes at the district level for two\nindicators of mother's bargaining power- namely, mother's ability and mother's autonomy-\ncame out as significant confirming that while these variables significantly influence birth\nregistration, the level of their influence varies across districts in India. So, policies targeting\nto empower mothers to improve maternal and child health outcomes and birth registration\nshould have a district level focus.\nOur estimates further showed that institutional delivery is a highly significant determinant\nwhich increases the probability of birth registration. This is consistent with a priori expectation\nas medical officers presiding over delivery are duty bound to report the birth. The number of\nmother's antenatal visits also came out as significant, which is not surprising given that moth-\ners will also get advice on postpartum care when they access antenatal services. Finlayson and\nDowne (2013) [55] note that costs of visiting antenatal facilities (even when antenatal services\nare provided for free) are the major reason behind low access to antenatal care in India (as in\nother low and middle income countries). The Janani Suraksha Yojana cash transfer program\nin India, where pregnant women are given a small sum of money to attend antenatal care and\ndeliver in a recognised health care facility has had a significant success in increasing antenatal\nattendance [55]. Such cash transfer programs with a view to encouraging women's attendance\nof antenatal care should be continued and extended to include birth registration given the suc-\ncess of the Janani Suraksha Yojana program.\nRobertson (2013) [56] notes that cash transfer programmes are an increasingly popular\napproach to meet health and development needs of vulnerable children. For example, the con-\nditional cash transfer program rolled out in Mexico under PROGRESA led to increased pre-\nventative care, including prenatal care and child nutrition monitoring, and higher school\nenrolment [57]. In the African context, a social cash transfer program in Malawi reduced child\nmorbidity and increased school enrolment. Similar benefits had also been observed in Kenya\nand South Africa. More importantly, Robertson et al (2013) [56] found that conditional cash\ntransfers led to increase in the proportion of children with birth certificates in Zimbabwe. Bar-\nuah et al (2013) [58] similarly established the positive impact of conditional cash transfer on\nthe birth registration of female children in Assam India. Under the conditional cash transfer\nscheme, known as Majoni scheme, girls born after February 1, 2009 get 5000 rupees deposited\nin a bank account given institutional delivery of the female child and compulsory registration\namong other things. The scheme resulted in an increase in the formal request to have female\nOur study also established that probability of birth registration increases by wealth quintile.\nThe direct and indirect costs associated with the process of registration may discourage house-\nholds in lower wealth quintiles from having children registered. We also find disadvantaged\ngroups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) or other castes have a lower\nprobability of birth registration compared to the Brahmin and Forward/General castes.\nMaternal autonomy and birth registration in India\nChildren in low income states are also less likely to be registered. This suggests that policy\nshould give special attention to raising birth registration rates of these disadvantaged groups\nand states.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Itismita Mohanty.\nFormal analysis: Itismita Mohanty.\nInvestigation: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nMethodology: Itismita Mohanty.\nProject administration: Itismita Mohanty.\nResources: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nValidation: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nVisualization: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nWriting \u00ad original draft: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nWriting \u00ad review & editing: Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin.\nReferences\n1.
