    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn a paradigm facilitating smile misattribution, facial responses and ratings to contempt and joy were investigated in individuals\nwith or without gelotophobia (fear of being laughed at). Participants from two independent samples (N\nthe intensity of eight emotions in 16 photos depicting joy, contempt, and different smiles. Facial responses were coded by\nthe Facial Action Coding System in the second study. Compared with non-fearful individuals, gelotophobes rated joy smiles\nas less joyful and more contemptuous. Moreover, gelotophobes showed less facial joy and more contempt markers. The\ncontempt ratings were comparable between the two groups. Looking at the photos of smiles lifted the positive mood of non-\ngelotophobes, whereas gelotophobes did not experience an increase. We hypothesize that the interpretation bias of \"joyful\nfaces hiding evil minds\" (i.e., being also contemptuous) and exhibiting less joy facially may complicate social interactions for\ngelotophobes and serve as a maintaining factor of gelotophobia.\n",

Within the extraversion\u00adneuroticism quadrant,\none stable inter-individual differences variable is known to\naccount for biases in the processing of joy, humor, and laugh-\nter: gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at; Ruch &\nIndividuals with gelotophobia describe themselves pri-\nmarily as introvert-neurotics (Ruch & Proyer, 2009). They\nexpress less smiling and laughter (Platt, Hofmann, Ruch, &\nencing less joy in a variety of situations (see Ruch, Hofmann,\nPlatt, & Proyer, 2014 for a review), and others' positive\nlaughter is experienced as malicious (Ruch, Altfreder, &\nProyer, 2009). Also, they respond with a marked heart rate\ndeceleration toward hearing laughter (indicating a \"freezing-\nlike\" response; Papousek et al., 2014). Gelotophobes inter-\npret laughter as a weapon utilized for putting them down and\nfalsely attribute it to mockery directed toward them (Ruch &\nProyer, 2008b). Consequently, they respond fearfully to\nbenevolent laughter (Ruch & Proyer, 2009), implying a pos-\nsible bias in interpreting joy and emotions potentially going\nalong with laughter/ridicule (i.e., contempt).\nThus, while extraversion and neuroticism partially predict\nresponses toward joy and contempt, gelotophobia is a specific\ntrait that biases joy responses and their interpretation (see Ruch\net al., 2014). As gelotophobia goes beyond global personality\ndimensions and is also sufficiently different from lower order\nconcepts such as shame-proneness, timidity, and social anxiety\n(Ruch et al., 2014), it is necessary to investigate its relation to\nresponses and interpretation of joy and contempt smiles.\nTherefore, the present research investigated how individuals\nwith or without gelotophobia respond toward facially expressed\ntypes of smiles (with a special focus on smiles of joy and con-\ntempt). This is important, as a bias in perceiving smiles and\nlaughs might lead to important consequences in social interac-\ntions (see Fredrickson, 1998; Johnston, Miles, & Macrae,\nhave a specific bias in interpreting facially expressed smiling\n1University of Zurich, Switzerland\nCorresponding Author:\nJennifer Hofmann, Department of Psychology, Personality and\nSwitzerland.\nEmail: j.hofmann@psychologie.uzh.ch\nIndividual Differences in Gelotophobia\nPredict Responses to Joy and Contempt\nJennifer Hofmann1, Tracey Platt1, Willibald Ruch1,\nand Ren\u00e9 T. Proyer1\n Keywords\nFACS, gelotophobia, joy, laughter, smiling\n2 SAGE Open\nand laughter, as those displays are linked to being laughed at\n(or misattributed ridicule).\nThe perception of being laughed at may go along with at\nleast two kinds of laughs and feeling states. First, amused\nlaughter (equivalent to joyful laughter in its expression; see\nRuch & Ekman, 2001) occurs, when mirthful people are\namused about something or someone, while the \"target\" is\nexcluded from the joke, that is, because he or she does not\nget the punch line or does not have the in-group knowledge\nto understand the joke. This could consequently be misper-\nceived as ridicule, though this is not directly laughing at, but\nthe others are not laughing with the person. In line with this,\nRuch et al. (2009) demonstrated that auditory-presented\nlaughs of a positive quality were misperceived by geloto-\nphobes. Joyful laughs where perceived as more malicious by\ngelotophobes than individuals with no fear, and listening to\nthe laughter did not lift the cheerful mood from pre to post\nthe task. Thus, we expect that gelotophobes misinterpret joy-\nful laughter as contemptuous, as those displays of joy are\nmisinterpreted as laughing at, while individuals with no fear\ndistinguish between joy smiles and contempt displays.\nSecond, contemptuous laughter occurs when people are\nlaughing at somebody else maliciously (as a form of aggres-\nsion; Poyatos, 1993). Typically, this would elicit negative\nemotions in the person being laughed at (e.g., shame or\nanger; Papousek et al., 2014). We expect that expressions of\ncontemptuous laughter are perceived as such by individuals\nwith no fear of being laughed at and gelotophobes (i.e., con-\ntaining contempt), but we also expect that gelotophobes\nassign those displays more joy, as they infer that people\nenjoy laughing at them (see Ruch & Proyer, 2008a).\nAims of the Present Study\nFor an empirical test of the hypotheses on joy and contempt\nsmiles, photos of facially expressed joy and contempt smiles,\nas well as expressions of emotions, ambiguous expressions,\nand other kinds of smiles were studied (based on the works\nther smiles and emotion expressions beyond joyful and con-\ntemptuous smiles,2 it could be tested whether the\ngelotophobes' bias in the perception is specific to joy and\ncontempt and not a general inability to judging smiles and\nemotion expressions. The basic emotion and ambiguous\nexpressions were included to conceal the main aim of the\nstudy. Two studies were conducted to investigate responses\n(verbal ratings of emotions and facial responses) toward\nfacially expressed smiles and laughs in individuals with and\nwithout gelotophobia.\nIn Study 1, ratings of nine emotions toward photos of joy\nand contempt smiles, and other smile types were investi-\ngated. The hypotheses stated that gelotophobes misperceive\nthe joy smile and rate the perceived joy lower than the no\nfear group, while individuals with no fear of being laughed at\nwould assign joy (and only joy) to photos of joy smiles\n(H1a). Also, it was assumed that gelotophobes perceive joy\nsmiles as more contemptuous (due to their anticipation of\nridicule; H1b). For contempt displays, it was expected that\ngelotophobes would rate contempt high, like individuals\nwith no fear (H2a). Moreover, gelotophobes would differ\nfrom individuals without gelotophobia by rating joy higher,\nas they attribute others to gain enjoyment from ridicule\n(H2b). For the rating of other expressions (basic emotions,\nsmiles, ambiguous expressions), it was expected that indi-\nviduals with no fear and gelotophobes would not differ in the\nemotion assignment, as gelotophobes do not generally lack\nthe ability to rate facial expressions of others (see also\nPapousek et al., 2009), but have a specific bias in joy and\ncontempt.\nStudy 2 included the rating of photos of joy and contempt\nin a laboratory setting where also the participants' facial\nresponses were filmed and coded by the Facial Action\nCoding System (FACS; Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002),\ngiving insight into the facial responses toward joy and con-\ntempt. Studies have shown that facial mimicry of smiling\nincreases the correct interpretation of smiles (e.g., Maringer,\nKrumhuber, Fischer, & Niedenthal, 2011). As gelotophobes\nhave been shown to express joy less frequently and less\nintensely (Platt et al., 2013), it was assumed that they show\nless frequent joy responses toward photos of joy smiles (H3).\nAlso, it was expected that they show more contempt\nresponses toward joy smile photos, as they misattribute joy\nsmiles to being contemptuous and respond accordingly (H4).\nAlso, gelotophobes were expected to show more contempt\nresponses toward contempt expressions (compared with\nindividuals without gelotophobia), as they are more sensitive\nto perceiving this emotion (H5). Beyond the methods uti-\nlized in Study 1, Study 2 further accounted for trait positive\naffect (PA) and negative affect (NA) to control for any habit-\nual tendency to rate positive emotions lower in low-trait PA\nor to rate negative emotions higher in high-trait NA. This\nwas important because gelotophobia has been shown to go\nalong with lower levels of joy on a state and trait level (Ruch\net al., 2014). Participants' mood scores before and after the\nexperimental task were evaluated. It was expected that by\nengaging with social stimuli entailing smiling and laughter,\nthe mood of non-fearful individuals would lift, while geloto-\nphobes would not experience the same increase (H6).\nMethod\nParticipants. The sample consisted of 83 adult volunteers (68\n11.72). The fear group consisted of 15 participants exceeding\nthe empirically derived cut-off point for gelotophobia at 2.50\nHofmann et al. 3\nextremely fearful of being laughed at. The no fear group's\nindividuals with borderline gelotophobia n = 32; valued\nfemales). The gelotophobia mean of the no fear group was\na 15-item standard measure for the subjective assessment of\ngelotophobia (\"when others laugh in my presence I get suspi-\ncious\"). All items are positively keyed and utilize a 4-point\nanswer scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree).\nInternal consistency was high ( = .86) in the present sample.\nRuch and Proyer (2008b) derived empirical cut-off points for\nThe smiling face may hide an evil mind paradigm.This para-\ndigm was developed to assess individuals'perceptions of joy\nand contempt smiles. First, participants were given the cover\nstory that lay actors were asked to pose certain facial expres-\nsions while being in different states of mind. In detail, the\nparticipants were told that the presenters had undergone the\ntask of getting into one of three predefined frames of mind\n(mean-spirited, neutral, benevolent) and then displaying cer-\ntain facial configurations of emotions (e.g., joy, fear, sur-\nprise) that they had practiced before. The participants were\nmade aware that the emotional state a presenter displays may\n(but also may not) match the frame of mind the presenter was\nin. The instruction, thus, facilitated gelotophobia by activat-\ning the notion that the actor might be concealing their true\nemotional state when displaying facial expressions. Second,\na selection of 16 photos was then rated for their emotion\ncontent.\nThe 16 photos contained expressions of joy smiles, con-\ntempt smiles, other smile types (phony smiles, \"Chaplin,\"\nmasking smiles) based on the work of B\u00e4nninger-Huber\nprise, a happy\u00adsurprise blend, a photo of \"beginning of fear,\"\n\"concentration,\" and two photos with no facial action unit\n[AU; Ekman et al., 2002] present). The latter ambiguous\nemotion expressions were considered \"noisy\" stimuli and\nserved as distractor stimuli. They facilitated the interpreta-\ntion of the frame of mind of the presenter diverging from the\nemotion displayed, as the face contained ambiguous infor-\nmation. Those photos of ambiguous emotion displays needed\nto be included to make the cover story plausible by implying\nthat the presenters might \"leak\" their true frame of mind and\nto distract from the stimuli of interest, the joy and contempt\nsmiles (and counteracting any hypotheses building by the\nparticipant). The photos included five presenters of both gen-\nders and were shown individually on a 21-inch computer\nscreen, head and shoulder close-up view. The participants\nrated the perceived intensity of eight emotions to the photo\n(anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, shame, surprise)\non a 6-point scale (1 = not at all, 6 = a lot).\nProcedure\nGeneration of the photos.Five FACS-trained presenters\n(two males) posed the 16 different smiles, basic emotions,\nand ambiguous expressions that were finally selected for the\nexperiment. The pool of photos was coded with the FACS\n(Ekman et al., 2002) by two trained FACS coders to ensure\nthe convergence between the intended and expressed display.\nThree photos were joy smiles in different intensities (Duch-\n+ 263; open mouth implied laughing), three contempt smiles\nsmile\" (AU13) each. The distractor stimuli consisted of one\nphoto for surprise (AU1 + 2), happy surprise (AU1 + 2 + 6\nconcentration (AU7), and two neutral photos with no AUs\npresent.\nStudy procedure.Participants were recruited through a\nnewspaper article, which contained a link to the study web-\nsite, announcing for a study in personality psychology. On\nthe study website, participants were first asked to fill in the\nGELOPH<15>, and then asked to complete a \"rating task on\njudging faces\" (Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind Para-\ndigm). To end the session, participants were debriefed and\nthanked for their participation. All participants participated\nvoluntarily, and individual feedback on selected personality\nvariables was offered as incentive.\nData analysis strategy.In this quasi-experimental study,\nthe level of gelotophobia group (gelotophobia vs. no fear)\nwas the independent variable and the emotion ratings were\nthe dependent variables. Aggregated scores for emotion rat-\nings of photos with the same content (e.g., all joy smiles)\nwere computed, leading to one composite score for each\nemotion rating for the three DDs, one for the three con-\ntempt displays, and one score for the two masking smiles.\nThe other smiles were analyzed individually. Photos of basic\nemotions and ambiguous expressions were used as distrac-\ntor items.4 The following analysis strategies were applied for\nhypotheses testing: First, for displays with a target emotion\n(i.e., joy and contempt), it was of interest whether the tar-\nget emotion (i.e., the emotion displayed, for example, joy\nfor DDs) would be highest for the respective stimuli. For\nthis, contrasts of the target emotion against the other relevant\nemotions (if any) were computed. An empirical cut-off point\nfor \"relevant emotions\" was established. Only emotions with\nan overall mean rating indicating at least \"slight presence of\nthe emotion\" were considered (i.e., overall mean of at least\n2.00). Those are reported in each respective section of the\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

No fear = low gelotophobia scores, <2.0 on the GELOPH<15>\n(Ruch & Proyer, 2008b). Gelotophobia = gelotophobia scores > 2.5 on\nanalysis. The consideration of emotions that were at least\nslightly present allowed for targeted testing of group differ-\nences in relevant ratings (and not comparing the groups on\nratings which were not chosen to be relevant). Second, group\ndifferences (no fear vs. gelotophobia) were investigated for\nthe target emotion. Third, it was of interest whether other\nemotions were assigned in the rating (with a special focus\non group differences). Differences were investigated with\nrepeated-measures ANOVAs (gelotophobia group as inde-\npendent, intensity of emotion as dependent, and the emotions\nabove the cut-off as repeated-measures factors; in the fol-\nlowing only referred to as repeated-measures ANOVA). The\nmain focus lay in the analysis of joy, contempt, and variants\nof smiles.\nResults\nJoy smiles.The aggregated ratings of the three joy smiles\nwere evaluated for the intensity of the target emotion joy.\nMeans and standard deviations are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1 shows that joy had the highest mean rating across\nall eight emotions, and only the contempt rating exceeded\nthe cut-off in the group of gelotophobes. As expected, a con-\ntrast comparing joy against contempt showed that joy was\nrated more intense than contempt in both groups, F(1, 79) =\n2 = .72. In line with the expectations, the\ninteraction between the type of emotion and gelotophobia\n= .06, showed that geloto-\nphobes rated joy lower than the no fear group; F(1, 80) =\n2 = .05, confirming H1a.

Nevertheless, the results failed to reach statistical\nsignificance, disconfirming H2a and H2b.\nPhony, masking, and Chaplin smiles.In the phony smile, joy\nand contempt exceeded the cut-off.

While individuals\nwith no fear of being laughed at related only joy to the photos\nof joy smiles, gelotophobes responded to these joy smiles by\nassigning less joy and more contempt compared with indi-\nviduals with no fear (H1a, H1b). This was in line with the\nexpectation that gelotophobes misperceive the genuine\nexpression of joy by assuming that the person is ridiculing\nrelated contempt to laughter and ridicule, and Darwin (1872)\nclaimed,\n. . . in the case of derision, a real or pretended smile or laugh is\noften blended with the expression proper to contempt, and this\nmay pass into angry contempt or scorn. In such cases the\nmeaning of the laugh or smile is to show the offending person\nthat he or she excites only amusement. (p. 224)\nThe expectations that contempt smiles are perceived as\nmore joyful, as well as containing more contempt for gelo-\ntophobes compared with individuals with no fear failed to\nreach statistical significance (H2a and H2b were discon-\nfirmed). Thus, the current result replicated the finding of\nRuch et al. (2009), who found that gelotophobes and indi-\nviduals with no fear did not differ in judging negative audi-\ntory laughter. To conclude, the bias of gelotophobes to\nassign more contempt to smiles was specific to genuine\nenjoyment displays, as no differences were found for other\nsmiles. This is the first study to reveal contempt as a rele-\nvant emotion in gelotophobia, and a further assessment of\nemotion displays needs to verify the findings in an indepen-\ndent sample (by also controlling for trait PA and NA, and\nmood).\nStudy 2 included the decoding of the 16 photos in the\n\"Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind Paradigm\" in a labo-\nratory setting. A sample of independently collected partici-\npants rated the same photos, and their facial responses were\nfilmed and coded by the FACS, giving further insight into the\nresponses toward joy and contempt. Also, trait PA and NA\nand mood changes pre and post the task were assessed.\nMethod\nParticipants.

Then,\nparticipants were left to read the instructions and to complete\nthe task on the computer.All participants completed the eight\nemotion ratings to an example photo. If the task was unclear,\nthey had the opportunity to ask the experimenter for explana-\ntions. The cover story and presentation of the 16 photos, as\nwell as the ratings, were the same as in Study 1.

The facial responses toward pho-\ntos were assessed using the FACS. Two FACS-certified\nresearchers followed a designated procedure to scoring the\nAUs relevant for joy smiles (DDs; Ekman, Davidson, &\nFriesen, 1990), contempt, and masking smiles. The inter-\nrater reliability (Cohen's kappa) for the two coders was K\n= .88. Facial variables were formed for responses to each\nphoto separately.

First, the no\nfear group's frequency of mimicked DD responses toward\njoy photos was higher than that in the gelotophobia group,\ntoward photos entailing contempt, the assumption of having\nat least five cases in each cell was violated. Second, the gelo-\ntophobes differed from the no fear group in the frequency of\nshowing contempt in response to the joy smile photos, with\ngelotophobes showing higher numbers of contempt smiles,\ncontempt smiles toward contempt photos, the gelotophobes\ndid not differ from the no fear group in the frequency of\nConvergence of subjective and objective data.The conver-\ngence between verbal emotion ratings and facial responses\nwas examined by Spearman's rank-order correlations.\nHigher ratings of joy toward joy photos went along with\nmore intense DDs (r = .54, p< .01). Also, higher joy ratings\ntoward joy photos went along with less expressed contempt\n(r = -.44, p< .01). Contempt ratings toward joy photos went\nalong with less intense responses of DDs (r = -.37, p< .01)\nand more expressed contempt (r = .19, p = .19), showing\nmoderate convergence of objective and subjective data.\nParticipants' mood. Means and standard deviations of PA and\nNA are reported in Table 2. The descriptive statistics of the\nstate scales indicated high skewness values for NA (i.e., gen-\nerally low levels of NA were reported). To analyze the mood\nchanges in the two groups, a repeated-measures ANOVA for\nPA was computed, as well as a Friedman two-way ANOVA\nfor NA, to account for the violated normality assumptions.\nFor PA, the two groups (gelotophobia vs. no fear) differed,\n2 = .17, with the gelotophobes\nbeing lower in PA than the no fear group. The interaction\nshowed that the no fear group increased in PA, while the\n2 = .12. The Friedman ANOVA with the Wilcoxon\nrank-order comparisons for NA showed a significant overall\ntion occurred. As expected, looking at the photos did not lift\nPA of the gelotophobes, but lifted PA in no fear individuals\n(confirming H6). NA was higher in the gelotophobes to start\nwith, but decreased from pre to post the rating task.\nTo test whether the increase in PA was mediated by the\namountoffaciallyexpressedjoy,arepeated-measuresANCOVA\nwas computed for PA (with the frequency of expressed DDs as\ncovariate). Results indicated that the frequency of expressed\njoy, indeed, mediated PA, as the significant results disap-\npeared for the interaction of Gelotophobia group \u00d7\nDiscussion\nAs in Study 1, gelotophobes rated joy displays more con-\ntemptuous compared to the no fear group (in line with H1b).\nBoth groups rated the contempt photos as contemptuous.\nAlso, the contempt photos contained tendentially more per-\nceived joy for the gelotophobes than the no fear group (in\nline with H2b); though this finding needs to be treated with\ncaution (i.e., failed to reach statistical significance in Study 1).\nOverall, the results for the emotion ratings were replicated in\nStudy 2, but the findings were also extended to the effect of\nthe rating task on the mood, as well as the spontaneous facial\nresponses to the photos. Although the gelotophobes were\nhabitually lower in PA and higher in NA compared to indi-\nviduals with no fear (supporting the earlier findings of gelo-\ntophobes being habitually lower in joy), these scores did not\ninfluence the ratings.\nIn line with the expectations, the gelotophobes expressed\nless joy smiles toward joy photos, compared to the no fear\ngroup (H3). This might be due to the elicitation of shame\nthrough (attributed) ridicule or contempt. According to\nTomkins (1969), one of the facial response pattern in shame\nis the\n. . . frozen face, in which the entire facial musculature is kept\nunder sufficient tight control, so that shame, along with all other\naffects is interfered with at the site of expressivity. This may be\na chronic of a transient defense against shame and other affects.\nThe generally lower levels of facial responses are sup-\nportive of Tomkins's (1969) claim that individuals with an\ninclination to shame may display a \"frozen face.\" Perhaps\nthe reduced facial expressivity of joy generalizes for geloto-\nphobes over situations, in line with the findings of Papousek\nand colleagues (2009) who reported that gelotophobia pre-\ndicted the control over the expression of emotions.\nFurthermore, the gelotophobes showed more contempt\ntoward joy photos, compared to the no fear group (H4). This\nimplies that they attribute negative emotions to facially dis-\nplayed joy.\nAs laughter and smiling are known to be contagious (e.g.,\nBourgeois & Hess, 2008), it was expected that looking at the\nphotos would induce state PA in participants with no fear.\nIndeed, the engagement with the smiling and laughter photos\nlifted the PA of participants with no fear, but did not lift the PA\nof the gelotophobes, confirming H6 and replicating the find-\nings of former studies (Ruch et al., 2009). The present study\nsuggests that this effect is mediated through the expressed\nHofmann et al. 9\nenjoyment, as the mood changes differed when they were\ncontrolled for the frequency of expressed DDs. Likewise, a\nstudy by Papousek and colleagues (2009) showed that when\ngelotophobes are exposed to the affective states of others,\nthey show less emotional contagion to cheerful stimuli but a\nhigh degree of contagion to negative stimuli, in line with the\nPA not increasing in the gelotophobia group. Moreover, dif-\nferences also occurred for NA: The gelotophobes' NA was\nhigher pre and post the rating task compared to individuals\nwith no fear.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe aim of the present research was to investigate how gelo-\ntophobia biases the perception of and responses to facially\ndisplayed joy and contempt. Gelotophobes perceive joy dis-\nplays to contain more contempt compared with individuals\nwith no fear (next to joy) and show more frequent contempt\ndisplays toward such displays than individuals with no fear\nof being laughed at. Also, gelotophobes express less joy\ntoward joy displays and rate the joy lower compared with\nindividuals with no fear. Next, we discuss the potential\nimpact of those findings in the broader contexts of (a) the\nemotional experience of gelotophobes, (b) the potential\nimpact of the bias on social interactions, (c) supporting evi-\ndence for the bias from broad personality traits (extraversion\nand neuroticism), and (d) possible implications on well-\nbeing and social support of the tendency of gelotophobes to\nexpress less joy compared with individuals with no fear.\nFirst, the present findings lead to more insight into the\nemotional life of gelotophobes. While shame, fear, and (low)\njoy seem to be the emotions forming the core of the experi-\nence of fearful individuals (see Ruch et al., 2014), contempt\nseems to be the emotion assigned to the \"offenders\" (i.e., the\npersons smiling and laughing). This is in line with the\ndescriptions of emotion clusters, which bring contempt, ridi-\ncule, and shame together. The contemptuous person ridicules\nthe person who is disliked, and the ridicule goes along with\nthe laughter of the contemptuous person, which, in turn, elic-\nits shame in the victim (e.g., Tomkins, 1969; \"the laugh\nbecomes a vehicle of contempt,\" p. 367). Interestingly,\nTomkins (1969) stated in his work on shame that this emotion\nmight be accompanied by different expressive behaviors: \" . .\n. another specific anti-shame posture is the use of the con-\ntempt response, either as a transient or chronic posture with\nwhich to combat one's own readiness to feel ashamed\" (p.\n365). This \"anti-shame expression\" in the form of contempt\nmight explain the frequent occurrence of contempt expressed\nby gelotophobes and they might show contempt smiles to\ncounteract the emergence and expression of shame (which\nthey are very sensitive too). This is of particular importance,\nas the induction of shame might be due to a misinterpretation,\nas gelotophobes have been shown to misinterpret laughter-\nrelated situations, auditory laughter, as well as ridicule and\nteasing situations (Ruch et al., 2014). Therefore, it might be\nthat shame is induced in gelotophobes by making them feel\nridiculed although no ridicule was intended. While different\nauthors have stated that \"mutual laughter\" can release feel-\nings of shame by putting the shameful situation in perspec-\ntive and find some irony in it (e.g., Retzinger, 1987), it is\nhypothesized from the current results that gelotophobes\ncould not interpret these signals of mutual smiling and laugh-\nter as benevolent, as the effect of misjudgment is already\napparent in context-free photos. Therefore, mutual laughter\nwould not be perceived as relieving, as the underlying\nmisperception is not solved (laughter is seen as a social rejec-\ntion cue; see also Papousek et al., 2014). In this case, it would\nbe necessary to train gelotophobes to re-evaluate laughter, its\nelicitors, and the underlying feeling state of the laughing per-\nson first.\nSecond, the findings help generate new hypotheses on the\ndifficulties gelotophobes experience in social interactions.\nMisperceiving joy as contemptuous and responding with\nmore contempt, in general, might lead to a feedback loop of\nmisunderstanding, as not only the gelotophobe will misper-\nceive the \"offender\" but also the \"offender\" will be signaled\ncontempt on the behalf of the gelotophobe. This might leave\nboth parties with perceived contempt of the other. Still, this\nmight depend on relationship closeness too. Kashdan and\nRoberts (2006) showed that for highly socially anxious indi-\nviduals, small talk interactions lead to greater NA compared\nwith low socially anxious, whereas no difference was found\nfor interactions in intimate relationships. This suggests that\nalso for gelotophobes, intimacy might foster the mutual\nunderstanding of the partners and might help overcoming\nunusual responses.\nThird, the present results lead to the hypothesis that gelo-\ntophobes apply specific expressions when dealing with joy\nand contempt, by generally showing more contempt and less\njoy. This is also interesting in the context of the findings of\nFok et al. (2008), as they reported that extraverts lessen the\ncontrol over expressing happiness, but increase the control\nover disgust, surprise, and contempt. They argued that in dis-\ntant relationship, the display of emotions that communicate\ndiscomfort or disapproval with the current situation may be\nperceived as impolite. Also, extraverts think that it is more\nappropriate to express contempt and disgust in close rela-\ntionships, because they are more competent in their ability to\nrepair and maintain relationships (e.g., Watson, Clark,\nMcIntyre, & Hamaker, 1992). Gelotophobes generally report\nbeing (neurotic) introverts; therefore, the findings for intro-\nversion might also apply to gelotophobic individuals.\nGelotophobes may lack competences to repair and maintain\nrelationships, but at the same time express contempt more\noften toward joy and contempt than individuals without gel-\notophobia. This is likely to lead to misunderstandings in\nsocial interactions.\nFor introverts, Fok and colleagues (2008) stated that they are\nless socially responsive and less likely to modulate their emotion\nexpression (even when uncomfortable with the public attention).\nThis may partially explain the higher number of expressed con-\ntempt in gelotophobes compared with individuals with no\nfear. Still, in the present studies, participants were unob-\nserved and the results cannot solely be explained by these\nfindings (unless the participants imagined a relationship with\nthe individuals shown in the photos). Furthermore, geloto-\nphobes also report higher scores in neuroticism than indi-\nviduals with no fear (see Ruch et al., 2014, for a review).\nKashdan (2002) showed that individuals high in neuroticism\nare more socially anxious and hypothesized that they would\nexpress their emotions less often to avoid unwelcome atten-\ntion of others. For gelotophobes, this may be specific to\navoiding the laughter of others.\nFourth, it has been postulated that genuine displays of\npositive emotions and mimicry elicit positive responses in\nother people, thus encouraging social affiliation, improving\nthe quality of interactions, and making social resources avail-\nable for coping with adversity (Fredrickson, 1998; Johnston\nexpressions are used on an everyday basis, for example,\nwhen individuals respond with polite smiles to social part-\nners, leading to advantages in cooperation and communica-\ntion. If gelotophobes fail to mimic those expressions and\nempathize with their meaning, they will be likely to lose out\non social reinforcement and cooperation, leading to less\nsocial affiliation and less social resources (as well as provid-\ning less of those resources to others). Consequently, the lack\nof social support might be a factor that makes gelotophobes\neven more vulnerable to misinterpreting people's behavior\nand situations, as they get less help in re-evaluating situa-\ntions, talking about experiences, and thereby less getting\nexternal validation on their (mis-)perceptions. Furthermore,\nDDs influence well-being by fostering self-regulation and\nhelping reduce the physiological and emotional conse-\nquences of NA (Fredrickson, 1998). This intrapersonal func-\ntion of smiling will also receive less importance in\ngelotophobes as they generally display less joy facially.\nThe current study has several limitations. First and fore-\nmost, the stimuli utilized for the current investigation only\nincluded a small (and uneven) number of joy and contempt dis-\nplays, as well as other smiles and posed expressions. The\nchoice of displays was based on theoretical notions and their\ndescribed putative facial expressions. Thus, the chosen dis-\nplays were a good starting point to investigate individual differ-\nences in the perception of smiling and laughter, but further\nempirical validation of the smiles is needed.At best, an empiri-\ncally validated classification of smiles and laughs would be used\nfor such an investigation, but to date, no such classification is\navailable. Also, the stimuli were not gender balanced. Thus, it\nwas impossible to investigate effects of gender of the posing per-\nson and other variables (such as attractiveness of the poser) on\nthe perception of the displays. Although we assume that geloto-\nphobia biases the smiling and laughter perception independent of\nthe gender and attractiveness of the poser, future studies might\ninvestigate possible influential poser features. Furthermore, the\nsmall number of stimuli did not allow for a complete random-\nization of the stimuli. This might be relevant, as it has been\nshown that gelotophobes show overreactions to fear-inducing\nstimuli (see Ruch et al., 2014), and it is possible that seeing a\njoyful face at the beginning of the series induced NA, which\nwas carried over to the subsequent photos. Thus, a replication\nof the results with more stimuli and a complete randomization\nwould be necessary.\nSecond, the \"Smiling Face May Hide an Evil Mind\nParadigm\" needs to be more closely evaluated, as the emotion\nratings do not allow for a judgment of the underlying feeling\nstate of the presenter, as participants were explicitly asked to\nrate the facial displays. At best, the paradigm would be uti-\nlized with additional questions. Third, it is still unanswered\nwhether gelotophobes misperceive joyful and contemptuous\nfaces because of certain features of the displays. Therefore,\nfeatures making smiles and laughs malicious need to be\ninvestigated by specifically asking participants what made\nthe display contemptuous. Fourth, while the study by Ruch et\nal. (2009) focused on auditory presentation, this study has\nfocused on visual presentation. Future studies should com-\nbine the two modes and investigate the differential effects of\nboth, as well as their combination. Furthermore, physiologi-\ncal measures, that is, of tension could give further indications\non the gelotophobes' responses to these displays. This might\nhelp shed light on the question why gelotophobes are prone to\nbelieving that \"a joyful face may hide an evil mind.\"\nTo conclude, this is the first study investigating geloto-\nphobia and emotions assigned to potential \"offenders\" dis-\nplaying smiling and laughter. Although these results need\nfurther specification and replication, they might give an\ninsight into why gelotophobes find dealing with smiling and\nlaughter aversive (as they see them as rather contemptuous\nand less joyful compared with individuals with no fear). It is\nimportant to investigate and understand such mechanisms, as\nthe expression of smiling and laughter serves important\nsocial functions beyond the communication of positive emo-\ntions. Also, the expression of contempt has an important pre-\ndiction value in relationship processes (see Gottman,\nLevenson, & Woodin, 2001). If gelotophobes misperceive\ndisplays of joy and contempt, they may experience difficul-\nties in social interactions and it needs to be assessed how this\nmisperception can be addressed in training programs, maybe\nby applying cognitive reattribution strategies.\n"
