Psychologists emphasize\nindividual cognitive ability and the effects of\nstereotypes on performance (1). Culturalists\npoint to values, beliefs, norms, and behavioral\npatterns unique and intrinsic to ethnicity (2).\nStructuralists focus on socioeconomic status\nwithin and beyond the family, including a\ngroup's position in a society's status hierarchy\n(3, 4). Data limitations and quantitative mod-\neling constraints, combined with contentious\nethnic politics, have rendered social scientists\nat an intellectual stalemate. This standstill has\nconsequences: The lack of a strong social sci-\nence voice in the debate has lead pundits to\nliberally evoke culture to explain poor or ex-\nceptional group outcomes (5, 6); the simplis-\ntic framing of group culture has fanned fury,\npitted groups against each other, and led Civil\nRights activists to advocate for group interests\nto promote a political agenda. Meanwhile, the\ngeneral public has remained deprived of\nknowledge generated from rigorous scientific\nresearch. However, Amy Hsin and Yu Xie\npropel the debate forward with their refresh-\ning analyses and insight in their PNAS report,\n\"Explaining Asian Americans' academic ad-\nvantage over whites\" (7).\nThe Asian-White Achievement Gap\nBased on nationally representative cohort\nlongitudinal surveys, Hsin and Xie (7) use\nsophisticated statistical techniques to develop\nmultilayer decomposition models that si-\nmultaneously test three competing hypothe-\nses: psychological (individual cognitive ability),\ncultural (belief in academic effort), and struc-\ntural (family socioeconomic background).\nThe authors use Asian\u00adwhite gaps in edu-\ncational outcomes (rather than outcomes\nper se) as their dependent variable, and\ncontrol for factors that differ across schools.\nHsin and Xie find a persistent Asian\u00adwhite\ngap in educational outcomes. They also\nfind that the difference in academic effort,\nrather than in cognitive ability or socio-\ndemographic characteristics, explains the\nAsian\u00adwhite gap.\nHsin and Xie then press forward to ad-\ndress why Asian American students put more\neffort into their schoolwork than their white\npeers, pointing to the significance of the\ncultural belief that Asian immigrant\nparents hold about the positive relationship\nbetween effort and outcomes. The authors\nalso estimate the costs of Asian American\nstudents' academic achievement and effort\nand find a host of negative consequences:\nAsian Americans are significantly less likely\nthan comparable whites to have positive\nfeelings toward themselves, they spend less\ntime socializing with friends, and they expe-\nrience more conflict with both parents.\nAnalyses disaggregating Asians into four main\nethnic groups--East Asian, South Asian, Fil-\nipino, and Southeast Asian--and controlling\nfor sex do not change the general patterns.\nHsin and Xie's (7) analyses have yielded\npowerful and conclusive evidence to confirm\nthat culture--as measured by increased ef-\nfort--accounts for Asian Americans' academic\nadvantage. Hsin and Xie have put culture back\non the map by proactively engaging in the\ndebate about its role in explaining the Asian\u00ad\nwhite achievement gap. The authors define\nculture as a shared belief in the positive cor-\nrelation between effort and outcomes, mea-\nsure culture in terms of academic effort, and\ntest competing hypotheses in a single empir-\nical analysis. They clearly and convincingly\nfind a cultural effect, which advances a classic\nsociological idea that cultural beliefs are as-\nsociated with particular behaviors that con-\nstrain or enable particular outcomes (8\u00ad10).\nUnanswered Questions about Asian\nAmericans' Academic Advantage\nAlthough they empirically show that Asian\nAmericans have an academic advantage over\nwhites, Hsin and Xie (7) are limited by the\navailable data and are unable to investigate\nhow Asian immigrant parents pass on the\ncultural belief about effort in a way that\naffects their children's behaviors and out-\ncomes. Moreover, Hsin and Xie can only use\na proximate measure of academic effort: that\nis, teachers' subjective ratings of students'\nattentiveness, task persistence, and eagerness\nto learn. Teachers may be biased in their\nratings of students, but even if we assume\nthat there is no bias on the part of teachers,\ntwo questions still remain. First, how and why\ndo Asian immigrant parents pass onto their\nchildren the cultural belief that increased ef-\nfort leads to more positive outcomes? Second,\ngiven the high costs associated with effort and\nhigh achievement, how have Asian Ameri-\ncans managed to academically excel despite\nthe overwhelming pressure they experience,\nespecially in a racially stratified society?\nHere is where our qualitative study can\nhelp answer these lingering questions. Based\non face-to-face, in-depth interviews with\nadult children of Chinese and Vietnamese\nimmigrants randomly drawn from the survey\nof Immigration and Intergenerational Mo-\nbility in Metropolitan Los Angeles, we fo-\ncused on their lived experiences from their\nperspectives, what we call a \"subject-centered\napproach\" (11, 12). We examined the ways in\nwhich immigrant parents and their children\nframed success, as well as the resources they\nused to support and reinforce the frame. We\nfound that the differences in the cultural\nframe and the resources used to support it\nhelp to explain why the children of some Asian\nimmigrant groups get ahead, despite their\nsocioeconomic disadvantage.\nThe Success Frame\nThree main findings from our study are\nparticularly relevant and effectively comple-\nment Hsin and Xie's (7) research. First, the\nadult children of Chinese immigrants and\nVietnamese refugees articulate a strict \"suc-\ncess frame,\" which entails getting straight As\nin high school, attaining a degree in a presti-\ngious university, and securing a well-paying\njob in one of the four coveted professions:\nscience, engineering, medicine, and law.\nAuthor contributions: M.Z. and J.L. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail:\nZhouMin@ntu.edu.sg.\n \nThis narrow success frame contrasts with\nbroader success frames adopted by adult\nchildren of Mexican immigrants, as well as\nnative-born blacks and whites. However, we\ncaution that the success frame is not innate to\nAsian culture or being Asian, but rather is\na product of being a child of Asian immi-\ngrants in the United States.\nBelieving that upward social mobility is\npossible in the United States, but fearing that\ntheir children will face racial discrimination\nbecause of their non-white status, Asian\nimmigrant parents shepherd their children\ninto the path that will best predict a suc-\ncessful professional outcome. Fields such as\nscience, engineering, medicine, and law re-\nquire exceptional educational achievement,\ncredentials, and \"hard skills\" that may obvi-\nate or lessen potential discrimination from\nemployers, coworkers, and clients. This re-\nquirement explains why Asian immigrant\nparents actively work to support the success\nframe and pass it onto their children. For\nexample, even when they encourage music\nlessons for their children, Asian immi-\ngrant parents do so because they wish their\nchildren to be more well-rounded and,\ntherefore, more competitive applicants to elite\nuniversities, rather than because they want to\nnurture their children's musical talent, per se.\nSecond, Asian immigrant parents have\naccess to tangible and intangible resources\ngenerated in the ethnic community that not\nonly reinforce the success frame, but also\nhelp them access institutional resources in\npublic schools. These ethnic resources are\ndifficult to capture in quantitative data. For\nexample, in our study we find that the Chi-\nnese and Vietnamese immigrant communi-\nties have developed an elaborate system of\nsupplementary education--private after-\nschool services, such as tutoring, examination\ncram and drill classes, college prep courses,\nand enrichment programs, with a wide range\nof price tags--which the children of Chinese\nand Vietnamese immigrants of different so-\ncioeconomic backgrounds can afford. The\nKorean community has similarly developed\nan elaborate ethnic system of supplementary\neducation in the United States (13, 14).\nMost of our respondents reported that\nthey had participated in these ethnic after-\nschool or summer school programs. Tapping\ninto tangible ethnic resources means that\nAsian American students put extra effort in\ntheir schoolwork outside of school, and this\nextra effort may affect students' behavior in\nschool and may also affect teachers' ratings of\nthem. In addition, participation in after-school\nprograms exposes students to an ethnic envi-\nronment in which they have access to other\nintangible ethnic resources, such as positive\nrole models to show that the success frame\nis realistic and attainable. This approach ex-\nplains how Asian immigrant parents pass on\nthe belief of the importance of effort despite\nintense parent\u00adchild conflicts.\nThe Hyper-Selectivity of Asian\nImmigration\nHowever, tangible and intangible educational\nresources are not equally available in immi-\ngrant or ethnic communities, and immigrant\nselectivity and hyperselectivity are critical\nhere. Immigrant selectivity refers to the\nphenomenon in which those who immigrate\nto the United States are more highly educated\nthan their counterparts who stay behind.\nWhereas most immigrant groups are highly\nselected in this regard, there is substantial\nvariation in the degree of educational selec-\ntivity depending on the country of origin and\nthe timing of migration from a particular\ncountry (15). Asian immigrants to the United\nStates are highly selected from their countries\nof origin, which is not happenstance; US\nimmigration policies afford an edge to appli-\ncants with high skills.\nIn addition, Asian immigrants are more\nhighly educated than average Americans, de-\nspite the tremendous heterogeneity in their\ncountries of origin. We refer to this dual se-\nlectivity as \"hyperselectivity\": a unique set of\ngroup characteristics that helps immigrants\nselectively import cultural practices (such as\nthe success frame and after-school academ-\nics) from their countries of origin, fine-tune\nthem, and then recreate those that are most\nuseful for social mobility in their host society.\nThe importing of specific cultural practices\nand institutions underscores our point that\nculture is not essential or fixed but, rather,\na dynamic resource that is shaped by immi-\ngrant selectivity and hyperselectivity.\nFurthermore, our research helps to shed\nlight on Hsin and Xie's (7) finding about the\nlower subjective well-being of Asian American\nstudents. The cultural frame comes at a cost,\nand is a double-edged sword for the children\nof Asian immigrants. Because Chinese and\nVietnamese Americans use high-achieving\ncoethnics (rather than native-born whites or\nthe average coethnic) as their reference group,\nthose who do not meet its strict tenets feel like\nethnic outliers or failures and, as a result, they\ndistance themselves from coethnics and from\ntheir ethnic identities (11). This finding has\nbroader implications for theories of assimila-\ntion; today's non-white second generation do\nnot turn to native-born whites as their refer-\nence group or their model for success.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn closing, we would like to call attention to\nthe unique ways in which qualitative data\nand mixed methods can help to inform the\ndebate about culture and group outcomes.\nAlthough there is a well-established body of\nresearch driven by \"hard\" data, including\nCensus and survey data, data that capture the\ndiverse lived experiences of younger-gen-\neration Asian Americans are relatively\nscant. However, simply increasing the amount\nof data will not necessarily improve data\nquality, and simply combining quantitative\nand qualitative methodologies will not guar-\nantee accurate representation (16). Further-\nmore, even the most sophisticated theoretical\nparadigms and ingenious empirical models\nwill do little to advance knowledge if we fail\nto a priori critically assess our underlying\nassumptions about the ways in which culture\nmay affect group outcomes. There is growing\ndiversity among the Asian American pop-\nulation and their educational outcomes, sig-\nnaling that the subfield will be ripe for new\nand informed research for years to come (17).\n1 Inzlicht M, Schmader T (2012) Stereotype Threat: Theory, Process,\nand Application (Oxford Univ Press, New York).\n2 Ogbu JU, Simons HD (1998) Voluntary and involuntary minorities:\nA cultural-ecological theory of school performance with some\n3 Portes A, Hao L (2004) The schooling of children of immigrants:\nContextual effects on the educational attainment of the second\n4 Sue S, Okazaki S (1990) Asian American educational achievement:\nA phenomenon in search of an explanation.
