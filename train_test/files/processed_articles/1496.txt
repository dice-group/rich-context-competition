Although substantial mortal-\nity from the long-term sequelae of hypertension can be pre-\nvented through existing antihypertensive drug therapy and\nblood pressure (BP) control, almost 22% of US adults are still\nunaware of their hypertension, and 32% of the hypertensive\npopulation are not on treatment.1 As mortality from hyper-\ntension has increased over the past 10 years, and >70 million\nAmericans are living with hypertension currently,2 it is of great\ninterest to examine the relationship between hypertension\ntreatment and control with cardiovascular outcomes and total\nmortality in the general hypertensive population.\nA number of effective antihypertensive drugs, including\ndiuretics, -blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor\nblockers are currently available for hypertension therapy.3\nMeta-analyses of the multiple randomized clinical trials have\nshown that lowering BP by any drugs compared with placebo\nreduces CVD morbidity and mortality; all classes of drugs\nreduce total and CVD mortality equally; and different classes\nof drugs provide differing degrees of protection from CVD\nmorbidities.4\u00ad7 However morbidity and mortality trials have\nbeen the target of growing dissatisfaction and criticism in the\npast few years.8,9 Because most trials have been carried out on\nselected groups of high-risk hypertensive patients with obvi-\nous differences in their cardiovascular risk profile as opposed\nto the general hypertensive population, the documented effects\nof hypertension treatment and control in a particular clinical\ntrial may have less general validity than what is often assumed.\nThus, population-based observational studies offer an alterna-\ntive approach to evaluate outcomes in hypertension treatment\nand control.\nIn the present study, we use the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and mortality\nfollow-up through 2006 to examine the association of hyper-\ntension treatment and control status with health outcomes in\n1Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, National Center for Health\nStatistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.\nCorrespondence: Qiuping Gu (qag3@cdc.gov)\n\u00a9 2010 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nAssociation of Hypertension Treatment and Control\nWith All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality\nAmong US Adults With Hypertension\nQiuping Gu1, Charles F.

Gillum1\nBackground\nClinical trials have provided convincing evidence that blood pressure\n(BP) lowering treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) and total mortality.The objective of this study was to examine\nthe association of hypertension treatment, control, and BP indexes\nwith all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among US adults with\nhypertension.\nMethods\nPersons aged 18 years from theThird National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) were identified as hypertensives\nbased on a BP 140/90mmHg or current treatment for hypertension.\nVital status in 2006 was ascertained by passive follow-up using the\nNational Death Index. Cox regression models were used to assess\ncorrelates of survival.\nResults\nAt baseline, 52% of hypertensive adults reported currently taking\nprescription medicine for high BP and 38% of treated persons had BP\ncontrolled. Compared to treated controlled hypertensives, treated\nuncontrolled hypertensives had a 1.57-fold (95% confidence interval\ncardiovascular mortality; untreated hypertensives had a 1.34-fold\nand cardiovascular mortality, respectively.The association persisted\nafter further excluding persons with pre-existing hypertension\ncomorbidities. Mortality risk was linearly increased with systolic BP\n(SBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MBP), whereas\ndiastolic BP (DBP) was not a significant predictor of cardiovascular\nmortality overall. No significant associations were observed between\ndrug classes and mortality risk.\nConclusions\nThis study indicates that uncontrolled and untreated hypertension\nwas associated with increased risk of total and cardiovascular\nmortality among the general hypertensive population.\nKeywords:antihypertensiveagent,bloodpressure,cardiovascular\ndisease,hypertension,mortality,NHANES\noriginal contributions\nHypertension and Mortality Risk\nterms of all-cause and CVD mortality among US adults with\nhypertension. We also evaluate the relationship of systolic BP\n(SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial\npressure (MBP), and specific antihypertensive treatment regi-\nmens with the risk of total and CVD mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design and subjects. The NHANES III was a nation-\nally representative health survey conducted between1988 and\n1994. The survey used a multistage, stratified probability clus-\nter design to select a representative sample of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized US population. Detailed descriptions of the\nsurvey plan, sampling, operation, response, and analytic guide-\nlines have been specified elsewhere.10 The NHANES III proto-\ncol was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics\ninstitutional review board and written informed consent for\ndata collection was obtained from all survey participants.\nThe personal interviews and physical examination of\nNHANES III participants provided baseline data for this study.\nThe NHANES III\u00adlinked mortality file through 2006 was\ncreated to permit longitudinal study of NHANES III partici-\npants. Mortality status was based on the result of a probabil-\nistic matching between NHANES III participants and the US\nNational Death Index. Details about the probabilistic match-\ning methodology are available elsewhere.11\nThe overall NHANES III response rate for the interview\nsons were identified on the basis of a mean SBP 140mmHg,\nor a mean DBP 90mmHg, or self-reported current use of a\nprescribed medicine for high BP. After further exclusion of\npregnant women, and those missing data on prescription med-\nication, loss to follow-up, or lack of information on cause of\ndeath, a total of 5,086 hypertensive subjects remained available\nto form the final analytical sample.\nMeasurements. BP was measured with participants aged 5 years\nin the sitting position after 5 min of rest by a trained health inter-\nviewer at home and by a physician at the mobile examination\ncenter. Appropriate cuff sizes were used for participants based on\nmanufacturer's recommendations. A mean SBP and a mean DBP\nfor each individual from up to six measurements (three on each\noccasion) were used to define hypertension and classify BP cat-\negories. PP was calculated as the difference between a mean SBP\nand a mean DBP. MAP was calculated as a mean DBP plus one-\nthird of PP value. BP indexes were expressed as each 10mmHg\nincrement in SBP, PP, and MAP, or each 5mmHg increment in\nDBP. Based on BP questionnaire and BP examination data, we\nfurther defined three hypertension categories. Treated control-\nled hypertensives were subjects who reported currently taking\nprescribed medicine for hypertension and had SBP <140mmHg\ndiabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) coexisted3). Treated\nuncontrolled hypertensives were subjects who reported cur-\nrently taking prescribed medicine for hypertension and had SBP\n80mmHg if diabetes or CKD coexisted). The remaining hyper-\ntensive persons were classified as untreated hypertensives.\nDetailed prescription medication use information was col-\nlected through the household interview. Antihypertensive\nagents reported by survey participants were identified and\ngrouped into five drug classes including diuretics, -blockers,\ncalcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors, and other antihypertensive agents (\n-blockers,\ncentral \nagonists, direct vasodilators, and other centrally\nacting drugs).3 Angiotensin receptor blockers were not avail-\nable before the 1995. Persons taking an antihypertensive\nmedication with only one active ingredient were considered\nas receiving monotherapy. Those taking more than one active\ningredient (either in one combination pill or in more than one\ndifferent single pills) were classified as receiving polytherapy.\nThe interview questionnaires also provided data on age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, leisure time physi-\ncal activities, a history of medically diagnosed hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, or heart failure.\nHeight and weight were measured with a standard protocol\nand used to compute body mass index (kg/m2). Persons with\na body mass index 30 were classified as obese. Serum choles-\nterol, creatinine and urine albumin, and creatinine were meas-\nured according to standard methods.12 Hypercholesterolemia\nwas defined as serum total cholesterol 240 mg/dl or a self-\nreport of currently taking a prescription drug for lowering\ncholesterol. Serum creatinine values were corrected according\nto the recommended guideline.12 Glomerular filtration rate\nwas estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease\nequation, 175 \u00d7 standardized Scr\nblack) \u00d7 0.742 (if female).13 CKD was defined as either an esti-\nWe merged NHANES III baseline data with the NHANES\nUnderlying causes of death were classified according to the\nInternational Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, and\nPersons who survived were administratively censored at 31\nDecember 2006.

Follow-up time for each person was calculated as the\ndifference between the NHANES III examination date and the\nlast known date alive or censored from the NHANES III mor-\ntality study.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using\nSAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (RTI, Research\nTriangle Park, NC).15 Sample weights were used to account\nfor differential probabilities of selection and the complex\nsample design and to obtain estimates representative of the\nnoninstitutionalized US hypertensive population. Variance\nestimates were computed using the Taylor series linearization\napproximation approach.16 Statistical differences between\nhypertension treatment and control status for baseline charac-\nteristics of the study cohort were tested univariately at the 0.05\noriginal contributions Hypertension and Mortality Risk\nlevel using a t statistic with a Bonferroni adjustment for three\ncomparisons ( = 0.05/3). Cox proportional hazard models\nwere used to assess the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality\nassociated with hypertension treatment and control status\nusing treated controlled hypertensives as the reference group\nbecause a previous study indicated that the relative risk of CVD\nmortality for treated controlled hypertensives (1.15, 95% con-\nfidence interval (CI) 0.73\u00ad1.82) was not different from those\nwithout hypertension in the US general population.17 Validity\nof the proportional hazard assumption for each variable was\nassessed by adding to the model a time-dependent corre-\nsponding variable.18 As the proportional hazard assumption\nwas violated across age and gender, we fit models separately\nfor age and gender in addition to the hypertensive samples.\nExamining the interaction of covariates with hypertension\ntreatment and control categories in predicting all-cause and\nCVD death did not indicate any significant modifiers beside\nage and diabetes. To eliminate potential bias due to pre-exist-\ning illness, we further fit model by exclusion of hypertensive\nindividuals with diabetes, CKD, heart attack, heart failure, or\nstroke at baseline.\nResults\nAt baseline, 52% of hypertensive persons reported taking\nprescribed medicine for hypertension, 38% of treated hyper-\ntensives achieved the therapeutic goals, and 77% of untreated\nhypertensives were undiagnosed or unaware of their hyperten-\nsion (data not shown). Table 1 shows distributions of demo-\ngraphic characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and BP\nlevels by hypertension treatment and control status. Compared\nwith treated controlled hypertensives, treated uncontrolled\nhypertensives were older, had higher BP values and higher\nprevalence of comorbidities; untreated hypertensives were\nmore likely to be men and Mexican American, had higher\nTable 1| Baseline characteristics of the study cohort by hypertension treatment and control status, US hypertensive adults aged\nHypertension categories\nTreated controlled Treated uncontrolled Untreated\nWeighted means (95% confidence intervals)\nWeighted percents (95% confidence intervals)\nUnweighted numbers\naComorbidities are diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart attack, heart failure or stroke at study baseline.\n*Significantly different from treated uncontrolled group at P < 0.05, with Bonferroni adjustment ( = 0.017).

In the fully adjusted model, relative to treated\ncontrolled hypertension, treated uncontrolled hypertension\nwas associated with a 57 and 74% increased risk of all-cause\nand CVD mortality, and untreated hypertension was associ-\nated with a 34 and 37% increased risk of all-cause and CVD\nmortality, respectively.

Both all-cause and\nCVD-related mortality risk progressively increased with each\n10mmHg increment in SBP, PP, or MAP, in the overall analy-\nsis and in most subgroup analyses. These associations per-\nsisted even after the exclusion of pre-existing comorbidities.\nHowever, PP was not a significant predictor for the younger\nhypertensive population (fully adjusted model), and MAP\nwas not a significant predictor of all-cause death among men.\nTable 2| All-cause and cardiovascular disease related mortality by hypertension treatment and control status, US hypertensive\nHazard ratios (95% confidence intervals)\nSubjects All-cause mortality Cardiovascular disease mortality\nHypertension category Model 1a Model 2b Model 1a Model 2b\nAll hypertensive persons\nMen\nWomen\nWithout comorbiditiesd\naPartially adjusted model: adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, except for the total and age specific analyses, which are also adjusted for gender. bFully adjusted model: adjusted for\nage, race/ethnicity, smoking status, sedentary lifestyle, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, heart attack, and stroke, except for the total and\nage specific analyses, which are also adjusted for gender.

Specifically, relative to treated\ncontrolled hypertensives, treated uncontrolled hypertensives\nhad a 57 and 74% greater risk of all-cause and CVD mortality\nand untreated hypertensives had a 34 and 37% greater risk of\nall-cause and CVD mortality, respectively. The association per-\nsisted and was significant after excluding subjects with hyper-\ntension comorbidities at baseline.\nLarge randomized clinical trials have provided strong evi-\ndence that BP-lowering treatment reduces the risk of over-\nall mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure,\nand CKD.3\u00ad7 However, some population-based studies have\nshown an increased risk of CVD mortality among treated\nhypertensive persons compared with untreated hypertensive\npersons.19,20 It would be more appropriate to use treated con-\ntrolled hypertensive persons as the reference group to evaluate\nthe risk of health outcomes associated with hypertension treat-\nment and control status. Our findings emphasize the important\nrole of BP control with antihypertensive treatment in reducing\nthe risk of total and CVD mortality. Compared to clinical tri-\nals, the treated controlled rate was substantially lower in the\nUS hypertensive population. Only 38% of treated persons had\nBP levels at therapeutic goals defined as SBP <140mmHg and\nThe current BP control rates remain poor in the US hyper-\ntensive population especially in the older persons and those\nwith coexisting medical conditions.21,22 Untreated hyper-\ntension presents another Public Health challenge as it affects\na large proportion of the general hypertensive population.\nIn our study, >75% of untreated hypertensive persons did not\nhave pre-existing diabetes, CKD, heart attack, heart failure, or\nstroke. However, they are still at greater risk of all-cause and\nCVD mortality, mainly due to higher BP values compared with\ntheir treated controlled counterparts.\nThe relationship between BP and cardiovascular risk has\nlong been recognized from large randomized clinical tri-\nals and epidemiological studies. However, there has been an\nongoing debate regarding the relative importance of various\ncomponents of BP in predicting CVD.23,24 Our findings sup-\nport the prevailing belief that SBP is the most consistent and\nsignificant predictor of CVD death.25,26 The importance of\nother BP parameters in predicting CVD mortality may depend\non the study population. For example, the Framingham heart\nstudy showed that PP was superior to SBP or DBP in predict-\ning coronary heart disease risk in normotensive and untreated\nhypertensive middle-aged and elderly adults.27 However, PP\nand MAP are not routinely used in clinical practice. Taking\ninto account both SBP and DBP levels, hypertensive persons\nrisk of CVD death compare to those with SBP <120mmHg\nThe relative impact of different drug treatment regimens\non cardiovascular events and mortality is another controver-\nsial issue.28\u00ad30 Results from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\nLowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial indicated that\ndiuretics were equal or superior to other antihypertensive agents\ntwo meta-analyses of multiple randomized controlled trials\nboth came to the conclusion that all classes of \nantihypertensive\nTable 4| Hazard ratio of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by antihypertensive drug classes, US hypertensive adults aged 18+\nSubjects\nHazard ratios (95% confidence intervals)\nAll-cause mortality Cardiovascular disease mortality\nDrug classes Model 1a Model 2b Model 1a Model 2b\nMonotherapy users\nPolytherapy users\n Diuretic and -blockerc\nACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; CCB, calcium channel blocker.\naPartially adjusted model: adjusted for age, gender and race/ethnicity. bFully adjusted model: adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, sedentary lifestyle,\nhypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and systolic blood pressure. cReference group for comparison.\n*Significantly different from reference group at P < 0.05.\noriginal contributions Hypertension and Mortality Risk\nagents reduced all-cause and CVD-related mortality equally.4,5\nThe largest meta-analysis of randomized trials published in\n2009 further confirms the benefit of cardiovascular protection\nwith the five major classes of BP-lowering drugs.33 In contrast,\nthe Women's Health Initiative Observation Study found that\nwomen receiving monotherapy with calcium channel blockers,\ncompared to those receiving monotherapy with diuretics, were\nmore likely to experience CVD mortality.34 Tardif et al. reported\nan angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\u00adbased treatment\nstrategy associated with reduced mortality from all-cause, CVD,\nand coronary heart disease compared with a calcium channel\nblocker\u00adbased strategy among hypertensives.35 The differences\nbetween observational studies and clinical trials of mortality in\nrelation to antihypertensive drug classes might be partially due\nto different risk profiles of hypertensive persons at baseline. In\naddition, the difference might be due to the fact that in observa-\ntional studies, current antihypertensive medication use is often\nthe result of past successes or failures with other drug treatment\nregimens. The findings of our US hypertensive population data\nare comparable with the results of previously reported clinical\ntrials and support the notion that control BP is more important\nthan the type of drug selection.\nThe major strength of this study is the use of the NHANES\ndata to provide population-based estimates of the associa-\ntion of hypertension treatment, control, and BP parameters\nwith CVD mortality and premature death. The method of\nBP measurement in our study is fully consistent with the\nnational standards. An average of six BP readings obtained on\ntwo separate occasions were used to define hypertension and\nclassify BP categories. However, several limitations should be\ntaken into consideration when interpreting our findings. First,\nthe cross-sectional design of our observational study and the\npassive mortality data linkage approach limited our ability to\nupdate exposure and covariate status. BP readings here are just\nbeing taken as one point in time (the baseline), and may not\nbe entirely representative of BP ranges that prevailed over the\nhypertensive person's lifetime. Also, the total length of duration\nof hypertension could not be controlled. Assuming it is likely\nthat untreated, or uncontrolled hypertensive persons may\nbecome treated, or controlled during the follow-up period, the\nhazard ratio for mortality for untreated or uncontrolled hyper-\ntension is probably underestimated in the present study, and in\ngeneral our hazard ratio estimates are biased toward the null.\nSecond, possible bias arising from missing data in multivari-\nable adjusted analyses can not be ruled out. Excluded hyper-\ntensive subjects were more likely to be non-Hispanic blacks,\nless likely to be former smokers, had a higher proportion of\nsedentary lifestyles, and a lower proportion of diabetes than\nthose included in the fully adjusted model. However, these\ndifferences should have little impact on hazard ratio estimates\nconsidering the fact that excluded data are equally distributed\nin terms of age, gender, hypertension treatment and control\nstatus, BP levels, drug classes, monotherapy or polytherapy,\nall-cause mortality, and CVD deaths.\nAlthough it is well established that hypertension is a strong,\nindependent risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease,\nthe impact of hypertension treatment, control, and of specific\nBP indexes on the total and CVD mortality are less completely\naddressed in the general hypertensive population. Using the\nNHANES III and mortality follow-up data, our study found\nthat compared to the treated controlled hypertensive popula-\ntion, both the treated uncontrolled and untreated hypertensive\npopulations had an increased risk of both all-cause and CVD\nmortality, especially among those without comorbidities. SBP\nwas the best independent predictor of all-cause and CVD mor-\ntality. This highlights the importance of achieving the SBP treat-\nment goals as recommended by current national guidelines.\nWe believe that our findings may have significant implications\nfor both Public Health and clinical intervention programs to\nreduce excess mortality risk through hypertensive treatment\nand control among the high-risk hypertensive population.\nDisclosure:The authors declared no conflict of interest.\n1.
