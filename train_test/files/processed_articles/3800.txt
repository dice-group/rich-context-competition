    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe literature on sexual selection and the social brain hypothesis suggest that human cognition and communication evolved, in\npart, for the purpose of displaying desirable cognitive abilities to potential mates. An evolutionary approach to social cognition\nimplies that proximate mating motives may lead people to display desirable mental traits. In signaling such traits, one can increase\nthe likelihood of attracting a potential mate. Two experiments demonstrated that exposure to mating cues--highly attractive\nopposite-sex faces--led people to display enhancements in declarative memory--a process underlying a variety of abilities such as\nresource acquisition, intelligence, and creativity. Experiment 1 showed that men (but not women) displayed enhanced memory\nfor details of a story that was presented during exposure to highly attractive opposite-sex faces. Experiment 2 demonstrated that\nheightened displays of declarative memory reflect an enhancement in retrieval rather than in encoding. Findings contribute to the\nliteratures on human mating and cognitive performance and provide novel insight into links between social processes and basic\ncognition.\n",

Maner3\n Keywords\nevolutionary psychology, mating, social cognition, adaptive memory, costly signaling\nThe fact that highly attractive members of the opposite sex can\nmake people lose all their mental faculties is nearly a comedic\nclich\u00b4\ne. Imagine a young, male college student walking to class,\nwhen a beautiful woman approaches him to ask for directions.\nMany people could likely relate if this young man, when faced\nwith the attractive woman, was to suddenly forget the way to\nthe cafeteria. Indeed, Karremans, Verwijmeren, Pronk, and\nReitsma (2009) demonstrated that interacting with attractive\nmembers of the opposite sex can distract and impair cognitive\nperformance. Their work fits the image of a bumbling young\nman trying to explain directions to a beautiful stranger.\nYet, demonstrating desirable mental traits, such as a robust\nmemory, would be helpful for attracting a mate. Consequently,\nan evolutionary approach might predict that mating cues would\nmotivate individuals to signal their desirability as a mate by\ndisplaying strong mental traits. The current work tests the\nhypothesis that exposure to attractive members of the opposite\nsex will lead people to display enhancements in memory.\nTheories of sexual selection suggest that people seek quali-\nties in mates that signal reproductively beneficial traits. For\ninstance, people place a premium on physical traits such as\nsymmetry (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1994) and facial masculi-\nnity in men (Fink & Penton-Voak, 2002) because those traits\ncan signal high genetic quality. In addition to physical traits,\npeople seek desirable mental traits such as intelligence, crea-\ntivity, and sense of humor (Buss, 1989; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, &\nCoss, Scheib, & Blozis, 2009). That women place a higher\nvalue on traits such as being ``educated, cultured, and intelli-\ngent'' during times of high conception risk lends further cre-\ndence to the notion that preference for these traits is, at least to\nsome extent, driven by mating-related goals (Beaulieu &\nHavens, 2015).

Consequently,\nwhen people are interested in acquiring a mate, they are often\nmotivated to display desirable mental traits. For example, Gris-\nkevicius, Cialdini, and Kenrick (2006) found that the activation\nof mating goals increased displays of creativity.\nThese social displays are often taxing, mentally or physi-\ncally, to the party attempting to attract a mate. The theory of\ncostly signaling states that (1) a reliable signal must be expen-\nsive and burdensome for the sender to indicate the honesty of\nthe signal to the receiver and (2) that there must be a rational\nconnection between the signal and the message for the receiver\nto easily decipher (Connelly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2011;\nZahavi & Zahavi, 1997). Indeed, it has been suggested that the\nhuman desire to assess levels of key mental fitness indicators\nsuch as intelligence, creativity, language, and humor in poten-\ntial mates has led to the development of signals to be used in\nmating contexts that display these advanced abilities\nUnlike creativity and a good sense of humor, memory does\nnot often spring immediately to mind when considering traits to\nlook for in a mate. However, consider the popularity of trivia\ngame shows and local trivia quizzes. Those games depend on\ncontestants' ability to display memory of a wide variety of facts\nand successful displays of memory confer prizes and social\nstatus. Traits such as general intelligence and ability to obtain\nvaluable resources are known to be important (particularly\nwhen selecting a long-term mate) and are directly related to\nmemory. Indeed, there is empirical support for the notion that\nindividual differences in intelligence and resource acquisition\nare dependent on memory. For example, a meta-analysis of the\ncognitive abilities that influence general intelligence scores\nrevealed that memory is a significant predictor (Grubb &\nMcDaniel, 2000). Furthermore, success at obtaining resources\nin the wild and achieving educational goals relevant to career\nsuccess depends on memory (Fagan, Holland, & Wheeler,\ndoes memory directly aid in one's survival but displays of\none's memory would also be useful for signaling an array of\nreproductively beneficial abilities to potential mates.\nDeclarative memory, dealing primarily with facts and\nevents of the physical world, involves the ability to declare\nor discuss information with other people (Tulving & Marko-\nwitsch, 1998). By comparison, other types of memory (e.g.,\nimplicit memory) involve an individual's private experience.\nThe social nature of declarative memory makes it valuable for\ntesting the proposed model of memory displays as a signaling\nmechanism. Furthermore, since declarative memory involves\nstatements of fact that can be independently verified by third\nparties, it can function as an honest, or at least, costly signal\n(Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997). In the current investigation, we pre-\ndicted that exposure to mating cues would lead participants to\ndisplay increases in declarative memory.\nIn addition to this hypothesis, we considered the possibility\nthat there might be relatively greater effects among men than\nwomen. First, mental qualities are especially important to\npeople who are seeking long-term partners (Buss, 1989; Miller,\n2000) and women are relatively more inclined than men to seek\nlong-term relationships (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Second, rela-\ntive to men, women tend to place greater priority on desirable\nmental (as opposed to physical) traits when seeking partners\n(e.g., Li et al., 2002). Thus, signaling desirable mental traits\nmight be especially useful for men seeking female partners,\nalthough we do not rule out the possibility that women may\nalso show enhancements in the display of mental traits as a way\nof attracting men.\nTo test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments in\nwhich participants were exposed to mating primes and listened\nto information they were later asked to recall. We predicted that\nmating primes would lead to displays of enhanced memory,\nperhaps especially among men.\nMethod\nFifty-eight psychology students (30 women) participated for\ncourse credit (age ranged from 18 to 28 years). Participants\nwere randomly assigned to view 10 opposite-sex faces that\nwere prerated (7-point scale) as either highly attractive\n(M \u00bc 6.16) or average in attractiveness (M \u00bc 2.55). Previous\nstudies demonstrate that highly attractive faces can prime mat-\nWhile viewing the faces, participants listened via headphones\nto a male voice reciting a spoken account of two people who\nspend a day completing errands and engaging in social inter-\nactions. Participants were instructed to pay attention to both the\nstory and the faces and were told that they might be asked to\nremember either later on. This instruction was provided in\norder to prevent participants from closing their eyes in order\nto focus solely on the details of the story, which would have\nprevented exposure to the facial stimuli. Ten faces were pre-\nsented for 7 s each, spanning the 70 s duration of the audio\npresentation of the story. Finally, participants answered six\nquestions designed to test their memory for the details of the\nstory (e.g., ``Where did the characters go before they went to\nthe hardware store?''). Correct answers were summed with\nhigher scores indicating better memory performance.\nResults and Discussion\nDescriptive statistics are provided in Table 1 and an interaction\nplot is provided in Figure 1. A 2 (attractive vs. average faces) \u00c2\n2 (participant sex) analysis of variance revealed a significant\nTable 1. Study 1: Mean (and Standard Deviation) Memory Perfor-\nmance by Priming Condition and Sex.\nPriming Condition Males (n \u00bc 28) Females (n \u00bc 30)\nNote. Higher numbers indicate better memory performance.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\n.08. In order to probe this interaction, the responses of men and\nwomen in the two facial attractiveness conditions were ana-\nlyzed separately using post hoc t-tests. A Levene's test for\nEquality of Variances suggested that equal variances should\nnot be assumed for female participants in the two conditions\n(F \u00bc 8.70, p < .01); therefore, the more conservative version of\nthis test is reported. This was not the case for male participants.\nAlthough memory performance of female participants did not\nan effect of the facial stimuli among men, such that men who\nviewed attractive female faces while listening to the story\nremembered more details than men who viewed average faces,\nFindings from Study 1 are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat mating cues enhanced memory performance, and this\neffect was observed in men but not women. However, the\nrelatively low mean for men in the control condition of Study\n1 creates some interpretational ambiguity such that it is unclear\nwhether the observed main effect was driven by the enhance-\nment of memory among men who viewed the attractive faces or\nan impairment of memory among men who viewed the\naverage-looking faces. Moreover, the results leave open the\npossibility that effects were driven merely by increases in arou-\nsal, as opposed to mating motives. Thus, Study 2 provided a\nreplication experiment and directly assessed the potential role\nof arousal.\nFinally, because the story was presented at the same time as\nthe stimuli, the design of Study 1 leaves open the possibility\nthat mating cues increased encoding, in addition to or instead of\nretrieval. Indeed, it is reasonable to assert that encoding\nenhancement might convey similar benefits to retrieval\nenhancement, given that successful retrieval is, to some extent,\ndependent upon successful encoding. However, we argue that\nalthough encoding and retrieval are not completely indepen-\ndent, neither are they homologous, as one can fail to retrieve\ninformation that was successfully encoded. Another important\ndistinction between encoding and retrieval that is relevant to\nthe current signaling hypothesis is the different functional\nvalue of these processes. Retrieval is a process through which\npeople can directly communicate to others their knowledge and\nintelligence, thus serving as an honest signal of mental traits\nthat would be desired by a potential mate. Encoding, on the\nother hand, is an early stage mechanism that can signal mental\nprowess only via more downstream processes (i.e., those that\ncommunicate the information that was encoded). In other\nwords, encoding success is private and can only function as a\nsignal via retrieval. Thus, compared with retrieval, one might\nexpect that encoding would not be as readily affected by expo-\nsure to mating cues. Furthermore, consider that if information\nis successfully encoded, then this stored information may or\nmay not contribute to mating-related signaling at an unknown\nlater time, whereas retrieval immediately following exposure to\nmating primes would be much more likely to function as a\ndisplay of desirable traits. We therefore argue that retrieval,\ndue to its greater degree of functional value and relevance to\nself-presentation, is likely to have been subject to greater selec-\ntion pressure than encoding. Study 2 addresses the uncertainty\nof whether mating cues affect encoding, retrieval, or both pro-\ncesses by varying the time at which exposure to mating cues\noccurred.\nMethod\nTwo hundred and twenty-eight psychology students (123\nwomen) participated for course credit (age ranged from 18 to\n39 years). Participants viewed the same opposite-sex faces and\nlistened to the same story as in Study 1. However, the order of\npresentation was altered to isolate retrieval as the stage of\nprocessing affected by mating cues. Participants were exposed\nto stimuli in one of three orders. In the ``encoding enhance-\nment'' condition, participants viewed attractive faces immedi-\nately followed by an audio presentation of the story, then\nviewed average-looking faces, and finally completed a test of\ntheir memory for the details of the story. Thus, in the encoding\nenhancement condition, the mating cues (attractive faces) were\nperceived immediately prior to encoding, which was intended\nto activate mating motives during the encoding stage. In the\n``retrieval enhancement'' condition, participants viewed\naverage-looking faces, listened to the story, then viewed attrac-\ntive faces, and finally completed a test of their memory for the\nstory. Thus, in the retrieval enhancement condition, the mating\ncues were perceived immediately prior to retrieval so that mat-\ning motives would be active during retrieval. Participants in a\n``no enhancement'' condition viewed average-looking faces\nprior to both the story and the memory test. Although\nFigure 1. Study 1: Interaction between participant sex and prime\ncondition.\nBaker et al. 3\naverage-looking, opposite sex individuals might be viewed as\npotential mates, exposure to average faces does not prime mat-\ning motives as strongly as exposure to images of highly attrac-\ntive faces (Baker & Maner, 2008). The audio presentation of\nthe story in Study 1 occurred simultaneously with the presenta-\ntion of the facial stimuli, thus dividing participants' attention\nbetween visual and auditory stimuli. Since the facial stimuli in\nStudy 2 were presented prior to and following the story, parti-\ncipants were asked to view seven emotionally neutral images\nchosen from the International Affective Picture System (Lang,\nBradley, & Cuthbert, 1997) while they listened to the story. In\norder to keep the task as similar as possible between Study 1\nand Study 2, participants were instructed to pay attention to\nboth the pictures and the story. Memory performance was again\nmeasured by summing accurate responses to six questions\nabout the story. Participants also completed the Brief Mood\nIntrospection Scale (BMIS, Mayer & Gaschke, 1988), a widely\nused 16-item scale that provides measures of arousal (e.g.,\n``lively'') and positive mood valence (e.g., ``content'') that\nhave been shown to have factor validity and Cronbach's a\nreliabilities ranging from .76 to .83. The BMIS was presented\nimmediately following the presentation of the attractive faces\nin the encoding enhancement and retrieval enhancement con-\nditions and following the second presentation of average-\nlooking faces in the no enhancement condition.\nResults and Discussion\nDescriptive statistics are provided in Table 2. Nineteen parti-\ncipants indicated during debriefing that they had participated in\nStudy 1; their data were excluded from analysis.

The current studies found that memory displays\nwere enhanced by exposure to mating cues and these effects\nwere not due to mood or arousal. These findings are consistent\nwith the hypothesis that mating primes would motivate people\nto display desirable mental abilities. Study 2 demonstrated that\nthis enhancement was specific to retrieval, rather than encod-\ning, fitting with the idea that enhancements in declarative\nmemory serve a social signaling function.\nWe observed some evidence that effects of mating cues on\nmemory displays were relatively stronger in men than women,\nalthough the strength of this evidence was inconsistent across\nstudies. A sex difference would fit with previous work demon-\nstrating that, compared with men, women tend to place rela-\ntively greater weight on the mental traits of prospective\npartners (Buss & Schmitt, 1993); thus, men may reap particular\nbenefits from signaling desirable mental attributes like good\nmemory.\nOne possible explanation for inconsistent evidence for sex\ndifference might lie in the way the primes were presented.\nGriskevicius et al. (2006) found that men's creativity was\nenhanced when primed with either a short-term or a long-\nterm mating goal, whereas women's creativity was enhanced\nonly when primed with a long-term goal. The attractive faces\nwe used are likely to have primed a short-term mating goal, as\nphysical attractiveness is a trait sought primarily in short-term\npartners (Li & Kenrick, 2006). Nevertheless, attractive long-\nterm partners are also preferred over unattractive ones, and,\nthus, the primes in the current experiments may also have\nprimed long-term mating goals. Because the primes did not\nclearly differentiate between cues relevant to short-term versus\nlong-term mating, this may have weakened our ability to detect\nsex differences.\nNevertheless, findings from both studies provide novel evi-\ndence that exposure to mating cues can lead to displays of\nenhanced memory. If we had found that images of attractive\nopposite-sex targets had hindered successful memory displays,\nsome might have dismissed this finding as intuitively obvious.\nAfter all, several studies show that attractive members of the\nopposite sex powerfully capture attention and thus should be\nTable 2.

Higher numbers indicate better memory performance. That average\nperformance was worse across participants and conditions in Study 1 com-\npared to Study 2 is likely due to the fact that the mating-related stimuli and the\nstory were presented simultaneously in Study 1, thus dividing participants'\nattention.\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nhighly distracting (Maner et al., 2003; Maner, Gailliot, Rouby,\nThe distracting nature of potential mates is consistent with\nKarremans et al. (2009) who reported that the presence of an\nattractive opposite sex experimenter caused men to perform\nmore slowly on a test of cognitive performance. The dependent\nvariable used by Karremans and colleagues reflected a measure\nof response time. It is possible that their findings partially\nreflected greater effort by participants. A desire to display\nmental acuity, for example, could have slowed performance;\nsuch speed-accuracy trade-offs are well documented in the\nliterature (Dutilh, Wagenmakers, Visser, & van der Maas,\n2011). Thus, one possibility is that mating cues may have\nmotivated participants to display desirable mental traits by\nprioritizing accuracy over speed.\nAnother important contrast is that, unlike the Karremans\net al. (2009) studies, the current studies did not require a\nface-to-face interaction. Such an interaction would require a\ngreater degree of impression management, which can deplete\ncognitive resources (Vohs, Baumeister, & Ciarocco, 2005).\nIndeed, Karremans and colleagues found cognitive perfor-\nmance was negatively correlated with participants' self-\nreported levels of self-presentation during an interaction with\na member of the opposite sex. A strength of the current work is\nthat by exposing participants to mating cues via images rather\nthan an interaction, we were presumably able to avoid tapping\ninto impression management and more directly test the effect\nof mating cues on cognitive displays.\nNonetheless, impression management is likely an important\ncomponent in a real-world mating context. The increased cog-\nnitive burden of impression management (like that present in\nKarremans and colleagues' experimental paradigm) would\nmake cognitive displays, such as memory displays, all that\nmuch more difficult to fake in an interaction. This fits with the\nidea that displays of mental traits are honest signals that can\ndemonstrate to potential mates that one possesses reproduc-\ntively beneficial traits. Given this, the findings of Karremans\net al. (2009) study may complement the current work by sup-\nporting the premise that successful displays of mental traits are\nan honest, costly signal of reproductively beneficial traits.\nThus, the current studies extend the literature on human mating\nby providing a more nuanced understanding of how exposure to\nmating cues impacts displays of cognitive performance. This\nresearch also supplements the literature on cognitive perfor-\nmance by identifying a key social variable with the capacity\nto upregulate people's memory displays.\nAdditional avenues for future studies are suggested by lim-\nitations of our research. For example, because the current work\nrelied upon samples of undergraduate students, who may be\nespecially active in their pursuit of mating interests, it may\nhave provided particularly optimal conditions for testing our\nhypothesis. Future research would benefit from examining\nmating-related cognition in more demographically varied\nsamples.\nIn addition, the current studies operationalized declarative\nmemory as retrieval of details from a spoken story and one that\nincluded only male actors. Future studies would benefit from\nassessing whether these findings generalize to other stimuli and\nother measures of declarative memory. Moreover, in light of\nwork suggesting disjunctions between different cognitive pro-\ncesses (e.g., strongly remembering someone despite a lack of\nattention; Becker et al., 2010), future investigations would ben-\nefit from understanding whether similar disjunctions character-\nize the effects of mating cues on cognitive performance. One\npossibility is that while mating cues enhance declarative mem-\nory, they might initially narrow people's attention, as the pres-\nence of a potential mate might distract attention from\nperipheral aspects of the situation (Maner et al., 2007).\nAn additional factor that could be included in research that\nseeks to extend the findings of the current work is the role of\nhormonal fluctuations in memory displays (and memory per-\nformance more broadly). Although the current work did not\nevaluate where female participants were in their menstrual\ncycles, it has been established that these fluctuations can influ-\nence memory performance (e.g., attention and memory have\nbeen shown to be worse at ovulation compared to the luteal\nphase; Hartley, Lyons, & Dunne, 1987; Soli\n\u00b4s-Ortiz & Corsi-\nCabrera, 2008). Future studies may track ovulation in an\nattempt to determine whether hormonal fluctuations have any\neffect on declarative memory.\nFinally, it is unclear whether the current research primed\nshort- or long-term mating mind-sets. Although there is con-\nsiderable overlap between the traits desired in these two con-\ntexts, there are also important differences (Buss, 1989; Li et al.,\n2002). This should have implications for the specific charac-\nteristics people signal in these contexts. Future research should\nexamine potential differences between the effects of long- and\nshort-term mating cues on the display of desirable traits.\nAlthough intuition might suggest that exposure to highly\nattractive people would be distracting and would impair cog-\nnitive performance, a functionalist perspective suggests that\nmating goals might lead people to display desirable mental\ntraits. Because memory is a foundational cognitive process that\nis linked to important survival skills (such as resource acquisi-\ntion) as well as desired mental attributes including intelligence,\ndisplaying a robust memory would signal a variety of repro-\nductively beneficial characteristics. It is also possible that the\nmemory enhancement following exposure to mating primes\nthat was demonstrated in the current study functions in the\nservice of more downstream processes such as use of humor\nand generation of creative displays, which play a more direct\nrole in mate attraction. This work provides new insight into\nfundamental links between social processes and human cogni-\ntive performance.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nBaker et al. 5\nReferences\nBaker, M.
