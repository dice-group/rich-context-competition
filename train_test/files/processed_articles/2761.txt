Thirty-nine public and private\nhealth facilities were sampled representing three levels of health care, and data\nwere collected on drugs, supplies, material, personnel time and out-of-pocket\nexpenses. In addition, direct non-medical costs in the form of overhead and\ncapital costs were also measured. Our results show that the average annual PAC\ncost per client, across five types of abortion complications, was $131. The total\ncost of PAC nationally, including direct non-medical costs, was estimated to be\n$13.9 million per year. Satisfying all demand for PAC would raise the national\ncost to $20.8 million per year. This shows that PAC consumes a substantial\nportion of the total expenditure in reproductive health in Uganda. Investing\nmore resources in family planning programmes to prevent unwanted and\nmistimed pregnancies would help reduce health systems costs.\nKeywords abortion, cost, post-abortion care, Uganda\n Post-abortion care consumes significant health resources in Uganda.\n Investing more in family planning programmes to prevent unwanted pregnancies would bring net financial benefits.\nIntroduction\nIn Uganda, deaths of women from complications of pregnancy\nor childbirth are unacceptably high and the maternal mortality\nbirths (WHO 2012). As legal abortion in Uganda remains highly\nrestricted and unmet need for contraception is high, many\nwomen seek abortions in unsafe conditions, often from\nunskilled providers. This has made unsafe abortion one of the\nleading causes of maternal mortality in Uganda. A 2003 study\nof abortion incidence in Uganda showed that abortion rates\nwere among the highest in the developing world, and unsafe\nabortion was a major reproductive health issue (Singh et al.\n2005). Although the health consequences of unsafe abortions\nare fairly well known, there is scant knowledge of the costs to\nthe Ugandan health system and to the women and their\nhouseholds. By showing how much the country will save if\nrecourse to unsafe abortion is prevented, the study provides\nimportant evidence supporting need for policy and programme\nchange to lower the high incidence of unsafe abortion.\nCaring for women with complications of unsafe abortion\noften requires expensive treatment in terms of skilled person-\nnel, surgical procedures, expensive drugs and supplies and\nprolonged hospital stays (Johnston et al. 2007; Henshaw et al.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-\ncommercial reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\nabortion continues to be a major contributor to the case load of\nmaternal and gynaecological services of the Ugandan health\nsystem. However, studies on the costs of unsafe abortion to\nhealth systems at the national level are limited, and attempts to\nmeasure costs at the regional level have been made only\nreveals that little research has been conducted on the direct\neconomic costs to women and households, or to national health\nsystems in sub-Saharan Africa (Woog et al. 2007).\nWith regard to Uganda, three studies have looked at the cost\nof unsafe abortion. Johnston et al. (2007) estimated the cost of\npost-abortion care (PAC) using data from a 1994 application of\nthe Mother-Baby Package costing spreadsheet to one district of\nUganda (Mbarara). Looking only at direct medical inputs the\nstudy estimated an overall cost of $44.87. A second study (Levin\net al. 2003) collected cost data at two facilities in Masaka\ndistrict in 1998 on direct medical inputs and some overhead\ncosts. They estimated that $37.70 in direct medical inputs were\nspent per PAC case and $8.82 in direct non-medical inputs.1\nThese two studies are based on data from the 1990s, indicating\na need for evidence on the current situation, as well as\nestimates that include direct non-medical costs and that are\nmore broadly representative of the situation in the country as\na whole. A third and recent study, Babigumira et al. (2011),\nused a decision-analysis model, applied to data from Mbarara\nreferral hospital inter alia, to estimate both societal costs and\nhealth-system costs of induced abortion in Uganda. It found\nthat each induced abortion incurs a total cost of $177, of which\n$85 is the direct medical and non-medical cost to the health\nsystem and $92 is the indirect cost due to lost productivity. Our\nstudy uses a health-system perspective and so does not attempt\nto estimate indirect, societal costs.2 This study expands on the\nstudy by Babigumira et al. by providing detailed cost estimates\nbased on an extensive set of current primary data collected\nthrough a nationwide survey.\nData and methods\nThis study is based on data collected from a sample of 39 health\nfacilities in August\u00adNovember 2010. This sample was purpos-\nively selected and was designed to include facilities providing\ndifferent levels of care and facilities with different ownership\nstructures (public, faith-based and private). The sample was\ndrawn from across the country and included both rural and\nurban areas. This increased the likelihood of obtaining data that\ncovered the full spectrum of PAC experiences. At the tertiary\nlevel of health care, 11 regional referral hospitals and 1 national\nreferral hospital were selected. At the secondary level, 17\nhospitals were canvassed: seven district hospitals, two private\nhospitals and eight faith-based hospitals. Ten primary-level\nfacilities were also selected: three Health Center IIIs and seven\nHealth Center IVs. Three health centres were private, operated\nby nurse-midwives and seven were public facilities.\nAll major regions of Uganda were covered with the exception\nof the north-east part of the country (Karamoja), which was\navoided for security reasons. Otherwise, the physical accessi-\nbility of facilities was not a consideration in selecting the\nsample. The facilities are located in 29 of the 80 districts of\nUganda.3 The survey respondents were experts who were\nknowledgeable about PAC in their facilities because of their\nmany years of on-the-job experience. The respondents were\nrequested to provide responses on the detailed inputs4 into PAC\ninterventions that, in the aggregate, are needed to treat specific\npost-abortion complications. As the interviews were lengthy,\ninterviewers were advised to split interviews into two or more\nsessions to minimize respondent fatigue.\nA 2007 study by the Guttmacher Institute developed protocols\nfor estimating the costs of unsafe abortion to the health system\nand to women and their households (Guttmacher Institute,\nunpublished data). The study instruments, consisting of two\ntypes of questionnaires, were tested in three countries, Ethiopia,\nPakistan and Mexico. The health-system-cost component, now\nreferred to as the `Post-Abortion Care Costing Methodology'\n(PACCM), is a variant of the `ingredients approach' (Johns et al.\ninformants. The method was first used in an exploratory\nstudy in Nigeria, which examined the cost of PAC (Bankole\net al. 2007). It was also used in a costing study undertaken in\nthese previous efforts by applying the method to a study that\nincludes facilities of all types, national coverage and estimates\nof both direct medical and non-medical costs of providing PAC.\nThe questionnaires administered to healthcare providers and\nfacility managers collected detailed data on inputs needed for\nestimating the cost of PAC. These included information on\npersonnel inputs of time, personnel wages, hospitalization\ncosts, overhead costs and capital costs associated with the\nprovision of PAC. Detailed data on the quantities of all drugs,\nsupplies and materials used in specific post-abortion treatments\nwere also collected. The averages of the estimates provided by\nthe respondents are assumed to yield a good approximation of\nthe true values of the various rates and amounts of specific\ninputs. Direct-cost data were gathered for each of five types of\nabortion complications--incomplete abortion, sepsis, shock,\ncervical/vaginal laceration and uterine laceration/perforation.5\nThis categorization was taken from the World Health\nOrganization's classification concerning PAC (WHO 1999).\nRespondents were queried on the time required to treat each\ntype of abortion complication as well as time spent in\nnon-treatment activities and the length of the work year, for\neach category of health worker involved. In gathering wage data,\nquestions were asked on salary ranges, professional allowances,\nhousing allowances, transportation allowances and duty fees.\nSome other benefits, such as medical workers' health insurance\nand communication allowance, were not estimated. Thus, per-\nsonnel cost estimates in this study are likely to somewhat\nunderestimate the true cost of labour. Data on labour costs were\ncollected for 11 categories of health workers, for the five\ncomplication types and for the three levels of facilities. Costs of\nhospitalization per bed per day were also collected.6 Finally, in a\nsection of the questionnaire on capital and overhead expenses, the\nrespondents were asked to estimate the life of the equipment,\ncapital costs for constructing new facilities, overhead costs and\nreferral rates between facilities.\nQuestions on the drugs, supplies and materials used in the\nprovision of treatments for specific post-abortion complications\nwere directed at care providers with specific experience in this\narea. The list of drugs and supplies was based on evidence from\nprevious studies in other countries, and the inputs listed in the\nWorld Health Organization's `Mother-Baby Package' (WHO\nBecause the exact presentations, chemical strengths and\npackaging for all of the drugs and supplies used in PAC were\nnot found in any centralized price list in Uganda, we used a\nmixture of local prices and, when local data were lacking, prices\ncollected from a variety of international sources. We consulted\nnecessary, prices were extrapolated to 2010 by using World\nBank Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators (World Bank\n2010). The catalogue from the Joint Medical Store of Uganda\nprovided local prices for more than half of the inputs (JMS\n2012) and JMS prices were used, when available, in preference\nto international prices.7 Several factors that might influence the\nfinal price, in either direction, were not measured because of\nthe time and cost of doing so. For example, spoilage, stocking\ncosts and transportation costs, which would typically inflate\nfinal prices, were not included in the calculations. At the same\ntime, discounts available through the centralized procurement\nof drugs and supplies, which would tend to decrease costs, were\nalso excluded from the model.8\nThe annual capital cost9 for PAC for each type of facility was\ncalculated as follows:\nPacCost \u00bc AmortAnnualCapitalCost/PacShare\nwhere PacCost is the annual capital cost attributable to treating\na single PAC case; AmortAnnualCapitalCost is the amortized cost\nper year of useful life10 and PacShare is the proportion of all\ncases treated by the facility that are related to post-abortion\ncomplications.\nData on quantities of inputs were collected according to what\nwas typically needed for treating specific complications thus\nyielding estimates of `costs per treatment'. As some patients\nmay have more than one complication treated simultaneously,\nfurther calculations were performed to produce estimates of\n`costs per case'. These unit costs are disaggregated by healthcare\nlevel, type of input, cost categories and type of complication.\nThe same analysis is done to estimate total costs at the national\nlevel, which yields an estimate of the national health care bill\ndue to unsafe abortion.\nA sensitivity analysis is undertaken to gauge the degree to\nwhich errors in measuring different factors affect cost esti-\nmates. It also provides an interval estimate of costs. A subset of\nvariables from the survey data was selected by inspection and\ncost estimates were calculated serially for maximum and\nminimum values of each variable.11\nEstimating the number of PAC cases\nTable 1 (top panel) shows inter alia estimates of how PAC cases\nwere distributed across the levels of health facilities in the\nUganda healthcare system based on facility records, and\nestimates made by respondents. Regional hospitals handled\n10 times more PAC cases annually than did general (district)\nhospitals, which in turn treated twice the number of cases as\ndid primary level facilities. The estimates provided by survey\nrespondents tended to be higher, indicating either that they\nsuspected some under-reporting in the facility statistics, or that\nthe number of PAC cases had increased since the statistics were\nlast recorded. We use the caseload estimates from key inform-\nants in calculations of total national costs.\nOnly PAC cases associated with induced abortion were\nconsidered in this study--PAC cases from spontaneous abor-\ntions were not included. Two-thirds of PAC patients were\ntreated for incomplete abortion, 22% for sepsis and 9% for\nshock. In general, serious complications, such as lacerations\nand perforations were more common at higher level facilities\nthan lower level ones. Across all 39 facilities, each PAC patient\nwas treated, on average, for 1.08 complications.\nTable 1 also shows the numbers of cases of rare, but very serious\ncomplications. These include morbidities, such as peritonitis,\nrenal failure, etc. The cost of treating these rare conditions is not\nestimated in this study, so the overall costs to be presented below\nare slightly under-estimated on that account.\nThe reported prevalence of PAC cases in the health system\n(e.g. PAC cases as a percent of all facility admissions) is also\nshown in Table 1. Two sources of information were available:\nthe estimates of survey respondents and estimates available\nfrom the statistical records of the facilities. Table 1 shows\naverages, by facility type, from these two sources.12 Overall, we\nestimated that a little under 5% of all patients presenting at\nhealth facilities in Uganda in 2010 were admitted for PAC.13\nA study of contraceptive needs in Uganda estimated that\naround 2.2 million pregnancies occurred in 2008 (Vlassoff et al.\nresulted in induced abortions in 2008.14 Assuming that increases\nin the annual number of abortions were proportional to popu-\nlation growth, the number of induced abortions in 2010 would be\ncare at health facilities for complications are shown in the bottom\npanel of Table 1.

Computed over all complications and all\nfacilities, only around 20% of PAC patients were outpatients,\nwhereas 80% (not shown in Table 1) were inpatients.17 While\nhospitals treated only a small percentage of cases of incomplete\nabortion as outpatients, health centres reported substantial\nnumbers of outpatients for cases of incomplete abortion, sepsis\nand lacerations. In many of these cases, minimal treatment\nwas given, such as dispensing analgesics, and the patients were\nthen referred to a higher-level facility.\nLimitations of the study\nThe sample of facilities was purposive rather than random. This\nimpeded the use of statistical probability analysis. However, we\npreferred to purposely select facilities where it was known that\nPAC caseloads would be substantial and where there would be\nrespondents well versed in the details of post-abortion treat-\nments. We reasoned that the variability in treatment standards\nand inputs used would not be large among facilities of the\nsame type. For scaling estimates up to the national level we\nrelied on data from the 2003 abortion incidence survey, which\nwas based on random sampling. Thus, we assume that the\nconditions of abortion provision have remained the same over\nthe intervening period.\nThe PACCM approach relies on expert opinion and estimates.\nThe methodology is a low-cost one meant to generate reliable cost\nestimates where a certain amount of precision is traded off against\nthe cost of collecting data. The validity of the data rests on the\nlong experience in providing PAC of the professionals interviewed.\nCertain inputs were also difficult or impossible to measure\nwith high precision. The future rate of inflation, for instance,\ncannot be known: we followed the usual practice of assuming a\nconstant rate of 3% per year. Drugs come in a sometimes\nbewildering variety of presentations. We adopted an averaging\napproach when confronted with a variety of options in\npresentation, packaging, bundling, strength, etc. Determining\nthe price of labour is similarly imprecise at the margin:\nalthough we accounted for the main components of wages,\nseveral particular benefits and compensations were not taken\ninto account due to their complexity, implying that labour costs\nare thus slightly underestimated.\nResults\nDirect medical costs\nCosts of drugs and supplies\nCosts per case of drugs and supplies increased with the level of\ncare, from $22 in health centres to $41 in regional hospitals\n(Table 2).18 This relationship was expected since more severe\ncomplications tend to be treated in higher level facilities.\nLower-level facilities, lacking the required personnel, supplies\nand infrastructure, are more likely to refer critical patients to\nhigher level facilities.19 The costs of drugs and supplies for\noutpatients were also found to be dramatically lower than for\ninpatient costs (not shown in table). This is consistent with the\npractice in Uganda of treating all but the least severe compli-\ncations as inpatients. The costs of drugs, supplies and other\nmaterials used in treating cases of shock, sepsis, incomplete\nabortion and lacerations were remarkably similar, varying\nbetween $23 and $28 per intervention across all patients\n(Table 2, bottom panel). For treatment of uterine perforations,\nTable 1 Average number of PAC cases per year and distribution of abortion complications\nRegional\nhospitals\nDistrict\nhospitals\nHealth\ncentresa\nAll sampled\nfacilities\nAverage number of PAC cases per year per facility\nPercent of PAC cases with specific complications\nNumber of PAC cases with rare complicationsb\nPercent of all admissions that are PAC casesc\nPercent of all admissions that are for MNH care\nEstimated number of PAC cases annually (2010)\na`Health centres' include private midwives.\nbRare complications include peritonitis, renal failure, organ failure, septicaemia, poisoning, heart failure, etc.\nc`All admissions' means all patients that present at health facilities, both male and female.\nthe average per-intervention cost of drugs and supplies was far\nThe main drivers of costs in the category of drugs and\nsupplies, which included laboratory tests, varied according to\ntype of treatment. In treating incomplete abortion, for instance,\nthe principal drivers were procedures, such as ultrasound and\nblood tests, sterilized gloves and some expensive drugs, such as\nceftriaxon and metronidazole. In treating uterine perforations,\non the other hand, operating room supplies, such as surgical\ndrapes, gloves, anaesthetic drugs and special needle holders\nwere the major cost drivers.\nMedicines and supplies were the costliest direct inputs used in\ntreatment, accounting overall for 58% of direct treatment costs\n(Table 2, middle panel). In health centres drugs, supplies and\nother materials amounted to 62% of all direct medical costs.\nCosts of personnel\nThe proportions of cases seen by health workers and the time\nspent treating patients are two of the main factors in\ndetermining personnel costs. The proportion of patients seen\nby health personnel varied considerably by type of facility and\nby cadre (not shown in Table 2). For example, in regional\nhospitals only 18% of patients suffering from incomplete\nabortion were attended to by anaesthetists, but 97% of these\npatients saw midwives and 92% saw drug dispensers in the\nfacilities. On the other hand, all the patients receiving\ntreatment for perforations were attended to by anaesthetists,\nbut only 33% by nursing assistants. The average number of\nminutes that health workers spent attending patients also\nvaried considerably by category of worker and by type of\ncomplication. For instance, at district hospitals general practi-\ntioners and gynaecologists spent 53\u00ad71 min with patients\nsuffering from hypovolaemic shock, whereas nurses and mid-\nThe average cost of labour per case was $15 at district hospitals\nand regional hospitals, and $10 at health centres (Table 2, top\npanel). This difference reflected the greater severity of the cases\ntreated at hospitals and the more costly make up of the care\ngivers. Nonetheless, the proportion of direct medical costs spent\nin labour inputs varied little by facility type, from 25% for\nregional hospitals to 28% for health centres.\nThe cost of labour per PAC intervention varied by complication\n(Table 2, bottom panel). Treating lacerations and incomplete\nabortions had the lowest average cost of labour ($12\u00ad$13). The\ncost of labour for treating sepsis and shock ranged from $15 to\n$16 and the labour cost for repairing a perforated uterus was the\nmost expensive in terms of labour input, amounting to $26.\nOther direct medical costs\nData were also collected on two other direct costs: hospitaliza-\ntion costs and outpatient special fees. As seen in Table 2,\nhospitalization (accommodation and meals only) was an\nimportant component of cost, comprising 7\u00ad19% of total\ndirect medical costs.

The estimated\nwere not found to be an important driver of PAC costs.\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that, while special outpatient\nfees comprised only 1% of the total cost per case, they\namounted to around 3% of the total for health centres where\nmost outpatient care is concentrated.\nDirect non-medical costs\nVery few costing studies of PAC have attempted to compute\ndirect non-medical costs (Vlassoff et al. 2008). These costs are,\nhowever, an important component of total costs. In the United\nNations, global estimates of reproductive health costs, for\ninstance, direct non-medical costs23 are estimated at roughly\ntwice the magnitude of direct medical costs in sub-Saharan\nAfrica (United Nations 2009). In other studies, one quarter to\none-third of total PAC costs have been estimated to be\nnon-medical (Vlassoff et al. 2008). This study is the first\nthoroughgoing attempt to measure the direct non-medical costs\nto the health system with regard to PAC.\nTable 3 shows results for both overhead and capital costs. The\nsurvey collected overhead costs in two broad categories: the cost\nof ancillary workers in the health system; and maintenance and\nother operational costs. The details of what comprised these\ntwo categories are given in notes to Table 3. In 2010, the total\nannual wage bill for ancillary workers per facility was $41 000\nacross all health facilities sampled, ranging from $64 000 for\nlarge hospitals to around $11 000 for health centres. On\naverage, our study showed that regional referral hospitals\nemployed 43 workers, district hospitals 28 workers and health\ncentres 9 workers for ancillary, non-care tasks. The average\nannual maintenance and operating cost per facility was $53 000\noverhead cost per sample facility amounted to $94 000 per\nannum and the portion of that total attributable to the care of\nhealth centres. Interestingly, however, the average overhead\ncost `per PAC case' varied relatively little due to the distribution\nof PAC cases by level of care. Thus, on average $20 of overhead\nexpense went into the treatment of one PAC case at regional\nhospitals and health centres, whereas $16 was spent at district\nhospitals. At every level, overhead costs were a significant\ncomponent of the total cost of PAC to the health system.\nCapital cost estimates are shown in the lower panel of\nTable 3. Overall estimates of capital costs for the infrastructure\nand equipment of the facilities were obtained from the key\ninformants. Estimates of actual facility lifetimes (total years of\nuse) were also asked for in the survey. Regional hospitals were\nestimated to cost $43 million on average to construct and equip,\nwhile health centres cost $1.3 million. At the same time,\nrespondents reported that facilities were used for several\ndecades before being replaced by new infrastructure, ranging\nfrom 68 years for regional hospitals to 33 years for health\ncentres.\nUsing the case of health centres as an example, the propor-\ntion of the annual amortized cost attributable to PAC was\nThe cost of capital was greatest for regional hospitals at $158\nper PAC case compared with $98 at district hospitals.\nTable 3 Overhead and capital components of PAC cost per case by facility type (USD 2010)\nRegional\nhospitals\nDistrict\nhospitals\nHealth\ncentres\nAll sampled\nfacilities\nOverhead costs\nCapital costs\nConstruction and equipment costs per facility\nUseful lifetime\nAmortized annual construction and equipment costs to supply PACc\naData collected on the following non-medical personnel: guard, cleaner, receptionist, record keeper, supply clerk, maintenance worker, driver, food preparer,\nhealth inspector, assistant health inspector, health educator and assistant health educator.\nbData were collected on the following items: building maintenance, utilities, vehicle maintenance, travel expenses, audio/visual materials, education/reference\nmaterials and printed materials.\ncThe future annual rate of inflation is assumed to be 3%.\nDiscussion\nTotal costs per case\nThe total direct costs of all inputs per PAC case, both medical\nand non-medical, by facility type across all types of complica-\ntions are shown in Table 4. The overall cost per PAC case was\nestimated to be $131. Treatment of post-abortion cases at\nregional hospitals cost $239 on average, while $111 was spent\non average at health centres. The direct medical cost per case--\n$41 overall--was closely related to the level of care. Regional\nhospitals expended $62 on direct inputs to treatment, district\nOverall, 68% of the total direct cost of PAC was non-\nmedical--expenditures in capital and overhead that were not\ndirectly tied to the provision of care but which were necessary\nfor the health system to be able to provide care services at all.\nThe non-medical component of costs at regional hospitals was\n74% of the total, but 67\u00ad68% of total costs were non-medical at\ndistrict hospitals and health centres. More than three quarters\nof direct non-medical costs were capital costs ($71), while the\nremainder ($19) was overhead costs expended on general\nmaintenance and infrastructure operations.\nNational cost of PAC\nUsing estimates of costs per case and cost per treatment,\nnational total annual costs for treating post-abortion complica-\ntions in Uganda were calculated for 2010. These are shown in\nTable 5, which breaks down total costs by care level, by\nabortion complication (where applicable) and by cost compo-\nnent. The total cost to the Uganda health system for treating\nPAC in 2010, including direct medical and non-medical\ncosts, was estimated to be $13.9 million (bottom panel).25\nTwo-thirds of this amount, or $9.5 million, went to non-medical\ncosts (overhead and infrastructure) and the remaining\nthird ($4.4 million) was spent on direct medical inputs\n(drugs, supplies, labour, hospitalization and outpatient fees).\nHospitalization accounted for 3.4% of total expenditure, drugs\nand supplies for 18.9% and the wage bill for 8.6%.\nAs can be seen in the three upper panels of Table 5,\nincomplete abortion was by far the costliest PAC complication,\ncomprising more than three-fifths of total direct medical costs.\nSepsis accounted for one-fifth of such expenditure, while\nlacerations and perforations each consumed only around\n3\u00ad6% of direct medical inputs. In terms of level of care, most\nPAC expenditure was concentrated in health centres ($8.4 mil-\nlion or 61%), followed by district hospitals ($4.0 million or 29%)\nand then by regional hospitals ($1.5 million or 11%).\nSensitivity analysis\nSince the data collected in this study were largely based on best\nestimates of key experts, we undertook a sensitivity analysis.\nGiven that data on several hundred inputs were collected in the\nstudy, an inspection of the data set was made to narrow down\nconsideration to a subset of variables likely to have the largest\neffect on the overall cost-per-case estimate. Twenty-three such\nvariables were selected spanning all major components of PAC\ncosts.\nThe central estimate of the national cost for PAC treatment in\nwhich this estimate was the most sensitive was the capital cost\nof infrastructure and equipment of health facilities: the total\ncost ranged from $12.0 to $15.8 million when this variable was\nset at its minimum or its maximum value. However, total cost\nwas insensitive to most of the selected variables. For example,\nthe estimated time doctors spent in treating cases of incomplete\nabortion, when set at the minimum and maximum values,\nabove or below the mean value.\nWhen all 23 variables were set to their minimum values, the\noverall national cost decreased to $9.9 million, while when all\nassumed their maximum values it increased to $22.2 million.26\nWhile it is extremely improbable that the true values of all the\nvariables would lie in the same direction (i.e. all either below\ntheir means or all above them), this range may be thought of as\na confidence interval within which the true overall cost most\nThe relative sensitivity of the 23 selected variables is displayed\nin Table 6. The first column shows the ratio of the overall cost,\ncalculated at the minimum value of a particular variable, to the\ncost calculated using the variable's mean value. The second\ncolumn shows similar ratios using maximum values. The third\ncolumn shows the arithmetic difference between these two sets\nof ratios. For example, the eighth variable, the cost of hos-\npitalization per night, yielded an total cost 0.9% less or 0.9%\nmore than the central estimate when minimum or maximum\nvalues were substituted for the mean value, and the spread\nwas, thus, 1.7 percentage points. The variables in Table 6 are\nlisted in order of the relative sensitivity of cost estimates to\nchanges in their value. Thus, the proportion of all patients who\nare PAC cases was the most sensitive variable, followed by the\nestimated cost of a facility's infrastructure and equipment, the\npresumed future rate of inflation, the estimated useful lifetime\nof infrastructure and non-wage overhead costs. This highlights\nthe importance of giving non-medical cost data greater prom-\ninence in the design of future studies of PAC costs. Fourteen of\nthe other variables examined had a spread of one percentage\npoint or less. Moreover, the estimate of total cost was virtually\ninsensitive to changes in the last 10 variables listed in the table.\nTable 4 Cost per case for PAC by facility type (USD 2010)\nComponents of cost Facility level\nRegional\nhospitals\nDistrict\nhospitals\nHealth\ncentres\nAll\nsampled\nfacilities\nDirect non-medical costsb\nPercentage distribution\naFrom Table 2.\nbFrom Table 3.\nConclusion and implications\nWe estimate that the cost of treating post-abortion complica-\nthe data from the survey are largely based on key informants,\nwe subjected the data to a sensitivity analysis, which showed\nthat the total cost of unsafe abortion to the Ugandan health\nsystem most likely lies in the range of $9.9\u00ad$22.2 million.\nTotal expenditure on health in Uganda in 2010 is reported to be\n$1.56 billion and, of that, the amount spent by the government of\nspent in Uganda on maternal and newborn health--in both\npublic and private sectors--was estimated at around $350 million\n(Vlassoff et al. 2009a). Thus, our estimates indicate that the cost of\ntreating post-abortion complications from unsafe abortion pro-\ncedures may be around 4.0% of total spending on maternal and\nnewborn health and equivalent to 4.1% of total government\nspending on health. The cost of unsafe abortion to the health\nsystem is, therefore, a substantial one.\nAlthough evidence is very limited, surveys of key informants\nshow that a large proportion of women suffering abortion\ncomplications never access services through the formal health\nsystem (Singh et al. 2005). Globally, it has been estimated that\nthe number of such women is around 50% of the number\nwho do reach health facilities (Singh et al. 2009). This implies\nthat the total cost of PAC in 2010 would have amounted to\n$20.8 million if all women with complications had been able\nand willing to access facility-based care. We must bear in mind,\nhowever, that this estimate is based on expert opinion, not\npopulation-based data, and also that women not attending\nhealth facilities may have less severe symptoms on average\nthan those who do. Despite this uncertainty, there is no doubt\nthat treating all women who have an unmet demand for PAC\nwould pose a significant additional cost on the health system\nin Uganda. Improvement of the health system is, therefore,\na priority if Uganda is to meet the post-abortion needs of its\nwomen.\nTable 5 Estimates of total costs at the national level of PAC by facility level and type of complication (USD 2010)\nCost components Regional\nhospitals\nDistrict\nhospitals\nHealth\ncentres\nAll\nfacilities\nPercentages\nacross\ncomponents\nNational cost of labour for PAC\nNational cost of drugs, supplies and materials for PAC\nNational cost of hospitalization for PAC\nNational cost of outpatient `special fees' for PAC\nAmortized annual construction and equipment costs to supply PAC\nNational overhead costs for PAC\nIt needs to be emphasized that this study looks at only one\nelement of the cost of unsafe abortions--the immediate cost to\nthe health system of treating post-abortion complications. There\nare many other substantial costs involved (Vlassoff et al. 2008)\nincluding the treatment of longer-term morbidities that result\nfrom unsafe abortion--especially the high cost of infertility\ntreatment--as well as the economic cost to Ugandan house-\nholds and society of productive time lost through abortion-\nrelated morbidity and mortality.\nUltimately, better health policy should be aimed at preventing\nthe root cause of unsafe abortion in Uganda--namely the large\nnumber of unintended pregnancies. About 1.2 million unin-\ntended pregnancies occur every year in Uganda, largely due\nto unmet need for contraception (Vlassoff et al. 2009a).\nA cost\u00adbenefit analysis in Nigeria showed that extra spending\non family planning would lead to large net benefits (savings)\nfrom reduced expenditure in PAC services (Bankole et al. 2007).\nA similar argument can be made here. The cost of supplying the\nmethods of contraception most widely used in Uganda for\n1 year has been estimated at around $22 per user (Vlassoff et al.\n2009a). If we compare this to the overall cost-per-case for\ntreating post-abortion complications ($131) we can see that\nthere is a large cost\u00adbenefit advantage to preventing unwanted\npregnancies in Uganda. The benefit\u00adcost ratio of adopting such\na strategy would be almost 6:1; i.e. every dollar spent in family\nplanning would save more than five dollars in PAC services\naverted.\nIn Uganda, legal abortion remains highly restricted and\nunmet demand for contraception is high. To promote policy\ndiscussion in this area, there is a clear need for the research\ninto the economic effects resulting from illegal, unsafe abortion.\nThe findings from this study should be interesting for scholars,\npolicy makers and advocates who are striving to reduce the\nhealth and economic costs of unsafe abortion. The cost\nestimates from this study are useful to guide discussions on\nhow to prevent and treat post-abortion complications in a\ncountry where abortion is restricted.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary data are available at HEAPOL online.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Swedish International\nDevelopment Agency; the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs; and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.\nConflict of interest statement.

Aspirin tablets,\nsyringes, sterile gloves, minutes spent by health workers and\nsonograms are all examples of inputs.\n5 The category `uterine perforation' also includes cases of other lower\nabdominal perforations and hysterectomies.\n6 To avoid double counting, only the `hotel' components of the cost of\nhospitalization are used in the analysis. These components include\naccommodation and meals.\n7 In practice, the two sets of prices were quite comparable: of 51\noverlapping inputs, 26 JMS prices were lower than international\nones and 25 were higher.\n8 Foreign donors may sometimes procure drugs and supplies free of\ncharge to developing countries. We do not take such contingencies\ninto account since we are concerned in this paper with how much\nPAC costs, not with who pays for it.\n9 Capital costs comprised the cost of construction of the facility and the\ncomplete equipping of it, including furniture, vehicles and\nspecialized machines and equipment, such as X-ray machines,\nlaboratory equipment, etc. Facilities often had records of construc-\ntion costs that could be consulted.\n10 Amortization was calculated as follows. If a constant rate of inflation\nis assumed, then the annual write off or depreciation of capital\nshould take this into account. The annual depreciation amount\nshould be adjusted upwards so that the present value of all such\namounts is equal the amount of the original investment. Here, we\nassume an annual rate of inflation of 3%. `Useful' lifetime means\nthe number of years a facility is actually in use for the purpose for\nwhich it was intended until it needs to be replaced.\n11 For most variables, the minimum was 75% of the variable's central\nestimate and the maximum was 125% of the central estimate.\n12 The Ministry of Health, Uganda (MOH) estimates were higher than\nthose of the experts. A further data source available for estimating\nthe share of PAC cases in the system's total caseload is MOH\nstatistics on the distribution of maternal-health cases, including\nPAC cases, for the period 2005\u00ad8. Combining these MOH statistics\nwith estimates of the proportion of all cases that are maternal and\nnewborn cases, which we obtained from our study, we get an\nestimate of the share of PAC in the system's total caseload\nconsiderably higher than the estimates noted earlier. In our\nanalysis we chose to use the more conservative estimates shown\nin Table 1.\n13 These percentages are used to estimate the proportions of overhead\nand capital costs to assign to PAC.\n14 This number is an extrapolation from the original 2003 estimate of\ninduced abortions. See Singh et al. (2005).\nUganda was 3.23% (UN Population Division, online data, accessed\n16 Although our survey collected data on the number of PAC cases, we\ndecided to use estimates from the 2003 survey as our survey was\nnot a probabilistic one. The 2003 facility-based treatment rate per\n1000 women of reproductive age was applied to women of\nreproductive age in 2010, assuming that the rate remained the\nsame over this period of time.\n17 However, being a PAC inpatient in Uganda does not necessarily imply\nstaying in the facility overnight: many inpatients are discharged\nthe same day as they are treated after spending several hours\nrecuperating in the facility.\n18 All costs in this study are given in 2010 US dollars (USD).\n19 Other effects may also be influencing this relationship: higher level\nfacilities may have better access to a wider range of drugs,\ntechnology and equipment and may therefore expend more inputs\nthan lower level facilities.\n20 The reported per-day fee of hospitalization is the factor that elevated\nthe cost at district hospitals compared with other facilities. The\naverage fee charged at district hospitals was almost three times the\nfee at regional hospitals. The fee at health centres was almost twice\nthat of regional hospitals. A possible explanation for this seemingly\ncounter-intuitive finding is that the informal charging of user fees\n(see below) may be more prevalent in rural settings than in urban\nones.\n21 User fees were abolished at primary care public facilities in 2001\n(Xu et al. 2005). In practice, however, the collection of user fees has\ncontinued informally in several facilities.\n22 Special fees include unofficial fees for service and any special fees\nsuch as a fee for use of the operating theatre. They do not include\nthe costs of drugs or supplies which the patients may have to buy\nseparately.\n23 Indirect costs are also called `programme and system costs' and\ncomprise overhead costs for programme management, supervision,\nhealth education, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy, human\nresources training, information systems, commodity supply sys-\ntems and capital costs for maintaining and expanding the physical\ncapacity of health facilities (United Nations 2009).\n24 As an example of how inflation assumptions affect this estimate,\nwith inflation at 0%, the cost per PAC case at health centres would fall\nto $34; with inflation at 4%, the annual cost would rise to $642.\n25 In comparison, using African regional estimates of PAC costs from\nVlassoff et al. (2009b) and the Ugandan share of the population of\nAfrica, we would calculate a PAC cost per case of $16.8 million\n(2010 USD), including both direct and indirect costs.\n26 The size of this range of estimates is largely accounted for by the\nsensitivity of cost estimates to a few of the indirect cost variables\nas shown in Table 6. The range of estimates for direct costs is\nmuch narrower, between $3.9 and $5.1 million.\n27 All the other variables left out of the sensitivity analysis would\ncontribute very little to the variation of the cost estimate even if\nthey were included.\nReferences\nBabigumira JB, Stergachis A, Veenstra DL et al. 2011.
