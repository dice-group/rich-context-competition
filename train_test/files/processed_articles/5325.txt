This variability causes confu-\nsion, making it difficult to compare results\nacross multiple studies. The Risk, Injury,\nFailure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease\n(RIFLE)13 and Acute Kidney Injury\nNetwork (AKIN)14 criteria are most com-\nmonly used in the study of AKI syndrome.\nUnfortunately, the existing criteria, while\nuseful and widely validated, are still lim-\nited. Hence, in 2012, the Kidney Disease\nImproving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)15\nClinical Practice Guidelines for AKI were\ndesigned, to compile information system-\natically on this topic by experts in the field.\nDefinition and staging of AKI are based\non the RIFLE and AKIN criteria. In\nshort, AKI is defined as an increase in\nserum creatinine (SCr) by !0.3 mg/dl\nwithin 48 h or an increase in SCr to !1.5\ntimes the baseline score within the first 7\ndays. The effect of pre-existing renal dys-\nfunction on AKI and mortality with AMI\nremains controversial.16\u00ad20 There is very\nlittle information about the role of\nimpaired estimated glomerular filtration\nrate (eGFR) at the time of hospital admis-\nsion on the mortality in patients with\nAMI-associated AKI (as defined by\nThe present investigation sought to\nevaluate the prevalence of AKI in associ-\nation with AMI, and to investigate the\nassociation between a decreased admission\neGFR and short-term outcome inpatients\ndeveloping AKI, as defined by the KDIGO\ncriteria, in the AMI setting.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study enrolled consecu-\ntive patients admitted to the Department of\nCardiology, The Affiliated Longyan First\nHospital of Fujian Medical University,\nLongyan, Fujian Province, China, between\ndischarge diagnosis was AMI (ST-elevation\nmyocardial infarction [STEMI] or non-ST\nsegment elevation myocardial infarction\n[NSTEMI]).21 Study exclusion criteria\nincluded: lack of at least two SCr measure-\nments at hospitalization; presence of\nobstructive AKI. The institutional review\nboard of Longyan First Hospital of Fujian\nMedical University approved the study and\nall study participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nData collection\nData collection was performed using a\nstandardized paper case-report form.\nCollected data included: patient character-\nistics, past medical history, final discharge\ndiagnosis, electrocardiogram findings,\nlaboratory investigations, echocardiography\nchanges, medical therapies, use of cardiac\nprocedures and interventions, in-hospital\noutcomes and overall mortality.\nAfter an overnight fast, venous blood\nsamples (10 ml) were collected into haemo-\ngram tubes containing di-potassium ethyle-\nnediaminetetra-acetic acid (1.5\u00ad2.2 mg/ml)\nand biochemistry tubes. Samples were main-\ntained at room temperature and tested within\n1 h of collection. White blood cell (WBC)\ncounts and haemoglobin levels were deter-\nmined using an automated blood cell counter\n(XE-5000TM; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCreatine phosphokinase myocardial bundle\n(CKMB) and SCr were quantiEed using a\nTokyo, Japan). Systolic and diastolic blood\npressures were measured by trained person-\nnel using a mercury sphygmomanometer.\nEjection fraction (EF) was measured\nand calculated using ultrasound equipment\n(HD7 Ultrasound System; Philips,\nEindhoven, The Netherlands).\nDiagnostic criteria for AKI\nThe SCr at hospital admission and daily\nduring the coronary care unit stay was\navailable for all analysed patients. eGFR\nwas calculated using the abbreviated\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease study\nequation.22 Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nwas defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/\nincrease in SCr by !0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or\nan increase in SCr to !1.5 times baseline\nwithin the first 7 days of hospitalization\n(based on the KDIGO criteria). AKI stage\nwas defined as follows, using SCr: stage 1,\ntimes baseline or an increase to !4.0 mg/dl or\ninitiation of renal replacement therapy.\nNon-AKI was defined as a change in creatin-\nine level of <0.3 mg/dl.

Some investigations\nused their own criteria to diagnose, while\nothers used SCr at any timepoint or at 7\ndays. For future studies, it is very important\nthat standardized AKI criteria are\nused, such as the KDIGO criteria,25 to\nallow comparison of results between differ-\nent studies.\nThe RIFLE and AKIN criteria also have\nlimitations. First, despite efforts to stand-\nardize the definition and classification of\nAKI, there are still inconsistencies in their\napplication. Secondly, some AKI cases may\nbe missed. Joannidis et al.26 directly com-\npared the RIFLE and AKIN criteria and\nfound that the original RIFLE criteria failed\nTable 5.

However, the AKIN\ncriteria missed 26.9% of cases detected by\nRIFLE.26 Thirdly, the stages within the\nRIFLE criteria, containing three severity\ngrades and two outcome criteria, are\nambiguous. In addition, in the KDIGO\ncriteria, stage 3 requires patients to reach\nSCr > 4.0 mg/dl, rather than an acute\nincrease of !0.5 mg/dl (AKIN criteria).\nThis change brings the definition and sta-\nging criteria to greater parity, and simplifies\nthe criteria.\nIn this present study, AKI development\nwas common in patients with AMI and was\nassociated with an increased risk of mortal-\nity. Furthermore, AKI development was\nassociated with increased in-hospital mor-\ntality in AMI patients. Similarly, a retro-\nspective evaluation of the incidence of AKI,\nbased on the AKIN definition, in patients\nwith acute coronary syndromes (ACS; 53%\nwith STEMI, 41% with NSTEMI, and 6%\nwith unstable angina pectoris) found that\nmortality was greater in patients with AKI\nthan in those without AKI (21% versus 1%;\nbetween these two studies. First, studies\nused different criteria (KDIGO versus\nAKIN) and different patient types (AMI\nversus ACS). This current study examined a\nmore high-risk population, with 51.8% of\npatients being treated conservatively, 10.1%\nof patients having had a prior stroke and\n16.2% having AMI complicated by cardio-\ngenic shock. As expected, the in-hospital\nmortality rate in this cohort was similar as\nthat usually reported for AMI patients,\nA limited number of studies have assessed\nthe role of admission eGFR on the outcome\nof AMI-associated AKI, especially in terms\nof short-term outcomes. For example, a\nstudy evaluating AMI patients showed that\nAKI, defined as a !25% decrease in eGFR\nat any timepoint during hospitalization, was\nassociated with a higher 1-year mortality\nrate.29 The conclusion was that AKI was a\nrisk factor for 1-year mortality, independent\nreported that an admission eGFR of\ncantly associated with a 30-day to 1-year\nmortality hazard (adjusted hazard ratio\ncriteria (AKI was defined as a SCr increase\nof !50% from the time of admission in the\nfirst 7 days of hospitalization). Most studies\nhave focused on the long-term mortality but\nfew on the short-term outcomes.11,23 This\ncurrent study looked at short-term out-\ncomes and for the first time found that an\nwith AKI was significantly associated with\nin-hospital mortality. This means that\npatients with either chronic or acute renal\ndysfunction are at a very high risk for in-\nhospital mortality, which might reflect the\nunderlying mechanisms that adversely affect\nboth cardiac and renal function.\nAssociations between AKI and these\nshort-term risks after AMI have several\npossible explanations. First, patients who\ndevelop AKI have a higher prevalence of\ncomorbidities such as diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, and CKD, each of which\nmay increase the risk of kidney failure and\ndeath.2 Secondly, significant differences\nwere observed in the type of AMI treat-\nment received by the two groups in this\nstudy. For example, patients in the AKI\ngroup were significantly less likely to\nreceive some pharmacological therapies or\nto undergo interventional procedures.\nThirdly, AKI will directly contribute to\ndistant organ dysfunction through the\nmechanisms of oxidative stress and inflam-\nmation. This means that AKI severity,\nusing the KDIGO criteria, represents not\nonly kidney damage but also an imbalance\nbetween the kidney and other organ\nsystems. Therefore, AKI defined by the\nKDIGO criteria, has a greater effect on\nmortality.\nThere are several points to be considered.\nFirst, the prevalence of AKI in the AMI\nsetting is high and clinicians need to be\naware of this important complication.\nSecondly, uniform standards for diagnosing\nand classifying AKI should be adopted,\nwhich need validation before using in\nfuture studies. Thirdly, AKI is associated\nwith the early in-hospital outcomes of AMI\nin patients with either nonimpaired or\nimpaired admission eGFR. Thus, it is crit-\nical to consider measures to prevent AKI as\nthey may represent a viable method for\nreducing mortality in the AMI setting.\nThis present study had a number of\nlimitations. It was a single-centre, observa-\ntional, retrospective cohort study and it used\nthe KDIGO criteria to define AKI, but\ninformation on urinary output was not\navailable in the study sample.\nIn conclusion, AKI occurred in 12.1%\nThis common complication was strongly\nassociated with mortality. The presence of\na low eGFR level on admission in patients\nwith AMI-associated AKI was related to a\npoor short-term survival prognosis. Patients\nwith an impaired eGFR level upon admis-\nsion, who develop AKI, require extensive\nclinical monitoring. These results strongly\nsuggest that recognition of these risks and\nthe adoption of appropriate strategies to\navoid AKI may improve outcomes after\nAMI, especially for patients with CKD.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the\nAffiliated Longyan First Hospital of Fujian\nReferences\n1.
