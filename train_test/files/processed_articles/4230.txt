In the\nmid-1990s the successful trials of tissue\nplasminogen activator (tPA), a clot-busting\ndrug, established tPA as the first acute\ntreatment for ischaemic stroke which offered\nsignificant improvements in outcomes and\ncomplete cure for some patients.2 However,\nits use is dependent on an appropriate\ndiagnosis being made within 3 h of the\nonset of stroke and subsequent trials have\nconfirmed that time to treatment is the key\nto good outcomes.3 These new paradigms of\ntreatment have generated new clinical and\nservice models for the treatment of stroke\nworldwide. Here I draw on documents and\ninterviews with clinicians and managers to\nanalyse the development of an acute stroke\nservice in Newcastle Upon Tyne in the\nNorth East of England and the introduction\nof tPA into practice. I show how new\npathways for stroke patients were created\nthrough protocols for paramedics and emer-\ngency room staff and suggest the findings\nhave implications for our understanding of\nthe translation of new knowledge into prac-\ntices and its transfer across clinical\ncommunities.\nMethods\nThe evidence employed here arises from an\nongoing broader historical study, which is\nexploring how and why the understanding,\nresearch, diagnosis, treatment and experi-\nence of stroke has changed over the past 60\nyears. It uses documentary sources such as\nhealth policy documents, published papers\nand correspondence on stroke together with\n17 interviews with stroke physicians, neur-\nologists, managers and patient activists in\nthe UK and the US. Oral history was used as\na tool to reconstruct participants' responses\nto the new understandings of stroke, partly\nbecause it is the most sensitive method of\nexploring experiences of work4,5 and is\nespecially suited to revealing how local net-\nworks, relationships, and communication\npathways underpin medical practice at\nlocal level.6 Manchester Local Research\nEthics Committee decided that formal\nNHS approval was not required.\nPermission was sought to audio-record and\nfully transcribe the interviews.\nResults\nThe evidence shows that the challenges of\nimplementing the new paradigms of practice\nwhich are contingent on conceptualising\nstroke as an emergency condition have\nstemmed from organisational and profes-\nsional barriers rather than scientific or\ntechnological difficulties. The difficulties\nexperienced by clinicians attempting to\nestablish an acute stroke service at the\nFreeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne\noriginated from multiple sources: stroke's\nhistorical status as a non-treatable illness\nwhich was primarily suffered by older\npatients; local configurations of emergency\nservices; and inter-professional disputes\nabout the ownership of patients. The multi-\ndisciplinary stroke team built new pathways\nfor stroke patients across the city by design-\ning protocols for paramedics and emergency\nroom staff to improve the diagnostic accur-\nacy of stroke in the various settings and the\nrapid triaging of patients to the acute stroke\nservice. The Newcastle Upon Tyne experi-\nence is not unique but is illustrative of the\nbarriers stroke clinicians have encountered\nworldwide when setting up acute thromb-\nolysis services. It is not surprising then that\nthe Newcastle Upon Tyne stroke protocols\nwhich were developed as a local solution to a\nlocal problem were adopted nationally and\ndisseminated further afield. My analysis\nexplores first the way in which stroke was\nemergency condition then moves to the\nestablishment of stroke services, the creation\nof the protocols, and the dynamics of the\nNewcastle Upon Tyne setting, which shaped\ntheir final form. The protocols, I suggest,\nbridged knowledge and practices between\nthe different clinical communities prompting\nactors to channel acute stroke patients on to\nnew pathways. Finally I argue that the\nadoption of protocols for acute stroke in\nmany parts of the world says much about the\nbroader characteristics of contemporary\nmedicine as well playing a highly significant\nrole in reconceptualising stroke as an emer-\ngency condition.\nNew paradigms for stroke\nIn high and middle income countries stroke\nis the second leading cause of death and the\nWorld Health Organisation predicts that\nheart disease and stroke will remain the\nsingle leading causes of death globally for\nseveral decades to come.7 The onset of a\nstroke can be rapid, with symptoms occur-\nring without warning; clinically it is defined\nas `acute neurological dysfunction usually\ndue to a pathological process in blood\nvessels'.8 The commonest cause of stroke \u00ad\naround 90% of cases \u00ad is through ischaemia,\nwhere a clot prevents blood reaching a\ncerebral vessel and causes cell death. For\nthe first half of the 20th-century physicians\ntreated stroke patients by practising `mas-\nterly inactivity' or `skilful neglect'.9 Stroke\nwas understood to be a terminal although\nprotracted disease process.10 But in the\n1950s in parallel with the growing use of\nanticoagulants, enzymes such as fibrinoly-\nsin, and hypotensive drugs, specialist stroke\nunits were developed from within depart-\nments of geriatric medicine. These were\ngenerally non-acute services and offered a\nrange of rehabilitative therapies including\nphysiotherapy and speech and language\ntherapy.11 A few studies suggested organis-\ning stroke services in these configurations\ncould help stroke patients achieve the max-\nimum return to functionality.11 In the US,\nsome intensive care units for stroke patients\nwere set up but these seemed to have little\nsignificant impact on mortality and\nmorbidity and this type of unit dwindled\nmodels of care emerged which focused on\nrehabilitating patients from the earliest\ndays, sometimes in designated stroke units\nand sometimes through mobile stroke\nFund Forum on stroke drew attention to\nthe poor quality of services in relation to\nboth the organisation and therapeutic\ntreatments.\nThe services that are provided in hospital,\nprimary care, and the community seem\nhaphazard, fragmented, and poorly tai-\nlored to patients' needs, and there is a\nstriking lack of convincing data on the\neffectiveness of widely used medical, psy-\nchological, and specific rehabilitative\nStroke was not therefore considered to be\nan acute condition requiring emergency\ntreatment, nor indeed did it necessarily\nresult in hospital admission.\nBut during the early 1990s, the National\nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and\nStroke (NINDS) in the US carried out\ntrials of the use of tPA in eight university\nmedical centres and around 40 hospitals\ncountrywide. NINDS researchers were\ncalled in to all stroke patients to treat them\nas acute emergencies using tPA and a\nplacebo. Laboratory work had confirmed\nthat tPA could restore blood flow and limit\ncell loss but there was a significant risk of\ncerebral haemorrhage which had been a\nmajor and frequent complication of earlier\ntrials with thrombolytic therapies. The idea\nof using drugs to dissolve the clot came from\ncardiology. Thrombolytic agents had been\nused to treat acute myocardial infarction\nthe primary treatment option.14 Treating\nacute stroke in an equivalent fashion `made\nsense; it's working in the heart, it should\nwork on the brain', said Patricia Grady who\nwas Deputy and Acting Director of NINDS\nin the early 1990s. But the context of the\nbrain was very different to that of the heart\nand made the implementation of thromb-\nolysis `really tricky and very exciting'.\nWhereas the heart had one terminal artery\nthe brain had four vessels and although in\nmost drug trials `if you're giving a drug you\ncan withdraw the drug, this one . . . you\ncan't take it back', noted Grady.a John\nMarler, the neurologist who designed the\nNINDS trials, commented that the most\ndifficult clinical aspect of tPA was its\npotency to do `harm in a time measured in\nminutes' and so the challenge had been to\nbuild a trial that enabled tPA to demon-\nstrate its full potential whilst limiting its\nrisks.b The trials were therefore set up for\ntPA to be administered in very tight time-\nstroke to reduce the risk of haemorrhage, as\nwell as maximise the potential for recovery.2\n`Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute\nIschaemic Stroke' was published in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine in December\n1995 accompanied by a major press confer-\nence and, for the first time in the history of\nstroke, provided evidence of the effective-\nness of an emergency treatment during its\nacute stage. When those involved in the\ntrials gathered to see the results of the\nstatistical analysis, it was, said Mike Welch\nwho had been in charge of the study's\nCoordinating Centre in Detroit, `a remark-\nable moment, the first time ever that any-\nthing had ever proven to be effective for\nacute stroke'.15 `You just know you're in a\nmoment that's a paradigm change', noted\nPatrick Lyden, the principal investigator in\nVirginia.15 The approval of tPA was a\n`wake-up call' to the established patterns of\n`therapeutic nihilism' that dominated the\ntreatment of stroke patients, wrote Louis R\nCaplan, Professor of Neurology at Harvard\nintroduction of tPA into practice has proved\ncontroversial as suggested by current statis-\ntics: only 2\u00ad5% of acute stroke patients are\ntreated with the new treatments; less than\ncentres within the timeframe.17 Many of\nthe difficulties as we shall see through the\nNewcastle Upon Tyne exemplar have arisen\nfrom organisational and professional bar-\nriers rather than scientific or technological\nproblems.\ntPA was a simple treatment. The dose,\nbased on a patient's body weight, was\nadministered by injection and intravenous\ndrip. The clinical diagnosis was determined\nthrough patient history, observation and\nexamination and used established technol-\nogy \u00ad computerised tomography (CT) scan-\nning. Scanning provided visual images of the\nbrain's soft tissue that could definitively\ndiagnose whether the stroke was ischaemic\nor haemorrhagic. tPA, of course, was\nlicensed only for use in ischaemic strokes\nbecause of the risks of it exacerbating\nbleeding. The treatment could produce dra-\nmatic results within hours of its administra-\ntion and the NINDS trials had shown how\nlong-term outcomes were improved by its\nuse. But tPA was only licensed for use within\n3 h of the onset of stroke which meant that\nthere was a very tight timeframe in which to\nachieve clinical diagnosis of ischaemic\nstroke confirmed by scanning. Diagnosis\nwas not an easy clinical task, even for\nthose with experience:\n`stroke has protean manifestations and\ndifferentiation of stroke mimics in the\nhyperacute setting can be challenging\neven for experienced vascular neurologists\nand stroke physicians'.18\nthat stroke patients could present to a stroke\ncentre and be diagnosed and treated within a\na\nb\nfew hours of the onset of stroke provoked\ndisbelief amongst clinicians worldwide.\nAccustomed to thinking of stroke patients\nas non-acute cases, clinicians struggled to\nreconstruct stroke within the parameters of\ntime-driven urgency and the high tech inter-\nventions usually associated with dramatic\nmedical emergencies such as heart attacks or\nroad traffic accidents. The idea of treating\nstroke within 60 min of the onset of symp-\ntoms was deemed `crazy' by most neurolo-\ngists, recalled Marler (see footnote b). The\ndifficulties have their roots in the long-held\nconcepts of stroke as a terminal although\nprotracted illness from which there is no\nrespite and stroke's associations with geri-\natric medicine which has always had low\nmedical status. They were also driven by the\nculture of neurology which was not prac-\ntised as an acute specialty. Rafael Llinas,\nAssociate Professor of Neurology, Johns\nHopkins University School of Medicine\nwas a resident in neurology at Brigham\nand Women's Hospital, Boston, MA in the\nMost of the great neurologists of that time\n[pre-tPA] were diagnosticians; this is where\nthe lesion is, this is the aphasia . . . people\ncome in with a stroke and they would see\nthem three or four days later and they\nwould pour over them for an hour and\nvery, very quickly it became from that to -\nyou have to come, you have to come right\nnow, you have to come in 15 minutes . . . in\nthe middle of the night . . . you have to\nmake a decision and . . . it's an entirely\ndifferent culture [post-tPA].c\nThe way in which tPA was set to funda-\nmentally change neurological practice was\naugured during the trials. Marler recalled\nbeing thanked by a nurse who worked in one\nof the tPA trial emergency centres: `Well,'\nshe said, `you've made our job so much more\nfun. First of all we see the neurologists in the\nemergency room when we've never seen\nthem before, and second we see them move\nso quickly' (see footnote b). And over recent\nyears some clinicians have begun to refer to\nstroke as `brain attack' in order to encour-\nage the same cultural responses that are\nembedded in medical and social structures\nfor heart attacks. In essence the challenge\npresented by tPA was not one of technical or\nscientific complexity, but in getting the right\npatient to the right place for treatment\nwithin the timeframe.\nIn the UK, Professor Gary Ford, stroke\nphysician in Newcastle Upon Tyne, remem-\nbered reading the NINDS trials results\nshowing tPA was effective and thinking:\n`this is of no relevance to the NHS, we can't\nimplement it'.d However, as we shall see\nnow, Ford did indeed become an early\nadopter of thrombolysis, developing an\nacute stroke service and creating new stand-\nards for practice.\nStroke services in Newcastle Upon Tyne\nGary Ford had trained in geriatrics and\nclinical pharmacology and when he became\na senior lecturer in Newcastle Upon Tyne in\n1992, with a clinical position at the Freeman\nHospital, he set up a stroke service encom-\npassing research as well as clinical practice.\nAt the time there were no models of acute\nstroke services but he surmised that in view\nof the new neuroprotective drugs then being\ndeveloped for stroke, acute stroke units may\nwell become the models for the future. The\nservice began in a very low-key way: `we just\ndecided we'd put all the acute strokes on one\nward' (see footnote d). Over the next few\nyears Ford acquired an offsite ward and\nallocated half the beds to stroke rehabilita-\ntion patients. Stroke patients were all\nreferred by their general practitioners\nc\nd\n(GPs) as the Freeman Hospital had no\nAccident and Emergency (A&E) depart-\nment. Local A&E services were situated at\nthe Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI), a few\nmiles away from the Freeman. At this point\n\u00ad pre-announcement of the tPA trial results\n\u00ad acute stroke patients were defined as those\nwho had suffered a stroke in the last seven\ndays.11 In specialist units like the one set up\nby Ford, CT scanning was one of the\nassessment tools but Ford had found it\ndifficult to establish scanning as part of the\nroutine treatment: `we could barely get scans\non everybody and . . . [nobody] had a scan,\nyou know, within an hour'.19 It was the\ndifficulties experienced by Ford in setting up\nhis stroke service which informed his imme-\ndiate reaction to the announcement of tPA\nthat it would be impossible to implement a\nnew treatment which required such a tight\ntimeframe for its administration. Indeed,\nFord may well not have pursued the poten-\ntial of tPA without the intervention of Jo\nHarbison, Ford's registrar of the time who\nhad a keen interest in stroke.e Harbison\nsuggested: `you should get the ambulances\njust to bring the stroke patients to . . . the\nFreeman Hospital directly'. This, said Ford,\n`was a simple thing to say but actually not\nthat easy to do'. Ford discussed the matter\nwith the Chief Executive of the Ambulance\nService for North East Northumbria and in\nprotocol enabling paramedics to take poten-\ntial stroke patients directly to the Freeman\nHospital's acute assessment area where there\nwas an on-call stroke nurse, rather than to\nthe A&E department of the RVI.20\nHowever, this provoked much local\nresistance.\nthere was a lot of opposition to that. . . . my\nphysician colleagues . . . in the Freeman\nHospital thought this was a really bad\nthing because they thought the paramedics\nwould bring all sorts of stroke patients,\nold ladies falling over . . . so they were anti\nit. . . . colleagues at the other hos-\npitals . . . didn't have a stroke unit or\nstroke service . . . they were opposed to\nit . . . they thought they were not going to\nget patients, and the neighbouring trust in\nNorth Tyneside immediately wrote a let-\nter . . . stating under no circumstances\nshould any patient in North Tyneside be\ndirected to the Freeman Hospital. So there\nwas a lot of opposition . . . which is a gen-\neral feature of innovation in the NHS\nactually (see footnote d).\nIt is perhaps useful to add here that these\npressures were in part driven by the new\narrangements for the NHS which had\ninvolved the separation of purchasers and\nproviders of care. Hospitals became inde-\npendent Trusts and were not guaranteed\nfunding but had to compete with other\nproviders, including non-local Trusts and\nprivate hospitals for contracts.21 Thus\nalthough the opposition to Ford's plan was\ndriven by persistence of historical attitudes\nto stroke patients and their treatment, it was\nalso exacerbated by the wider tensions in\nhealth service organisation.\nInitially only two or three stroke patients\na month were brought to Ford's service but\nnumbers increased after Ford wrote directly\nto paramedics and reassured them that there\nwas no problem if they brought a patient\nwho turned out not to have a stroke (see\nfootnote d). After the first 15 months a\nreview showed that 84% of patients\nadmitted via the rapid ambulance protocol\nhad a confirmed diagnosis of acute stroke or\ntransient ischaemic attack (TIA).20 As\nHarbison et al. pointed out in their report\nto the Lancet, the protocol had been estab-\nlished without additional training for\ne\nJo Harbison, now Lead Consultant Stroke Physician\nand Senior Geriatrician, St James's Hospital, Dublin;\nNational Clinical Lead in Stroke Medicine; Senior\nLecturer, Department of Medical Gerontology, Trinity\nCollege Dublin.\nparamedics (i.e. little additional costs had\nbeen required) and yet had proved remark-\nably effective. During this period, Newcastle\nUpon Tyne was one of only two centres in\nthe UK using the new therapies. In many\nother centres, the fact that tPA had not yet\nbeen licensed in Europe created too many\nuncertainties for physicians to implement it.f\nFace, arm, speech test\nFord's direct engagement with the\nEmergency Services caused him to think\nmore deeply about the critical role served\nby paramedics in the case of stroke\npatients: `they could potentially in the\nlong run be giving drugs in the ambulance'\n(see footnote d). A pharmaceutical com-\npany, Janssen Cilag, interested in market-\ning thrombolytic drugs, agreed to fund the\ndevelopment of a diagnostic stroke instru-\nment for paramedics and a promotional\ntogether a small group of stroke and\nA&E physicians and ambulance personnel\nand together they undertook:\n`a quick review of what was out there and\nwe came across the Los Angeles paramedic\nstroke scale and the Cincinnati . . . stroke\nrecognition instrument. We basically did a\nminor modification to the Cincinnati\ninstrument . . . adding in a GCS (Glasgow\nComa Scale)' (see footnote d).\nThe purpose of the Newcastle Face Arm\nSpeech Test (FAST) was to allow the rapid\ndiagnosis of potential stroke patients by\nparamedics. The group designed FAST to\nintegrate easily into existing assessment\nprocedures used by emergency services\nsuch as the Glasgow Coma Scale. It con-\ntained three key elements: facial weakness,\narm weakness and speech disturbance and\nthese were incorporated into the ambulance\nreport form used universally.22 To promote\nFAST, the group also produced a training\npackage for paramedics which was distrib-\nuted to ambulance staff in Newcastle Upon\nTyne and incorporated into the training\nA prospective study of the acute stroke\nproduced evidence that paramedics using\nFAST had achieved high levels of detection\nand diagnostic accuracy of stroke. FAST\ndid not require paramedics to acquire new\nknowledge but rather to focus their existing\nknowledge on the key elements of stroke in\norder to differentiate their response to stroke\npatients from other emergency patients.\nFAST was notable for showing how\nwithin the structures of the NHS, para-\nmedics could effectively redirect patients to\nstroke centres. It also illustrated the way in\nwhich local configurations of A&E services\naround Newcastle Upon Tyne drove much\nof Ford and his team's work: `In other\nplaces it was never so critical because the\npatients would be coming anyway' (see\nfootnote d). FAST was developed to address\nthe specific problems in Newcastle Upon\nTyne yet it was later taken up as a diagnostic\ntool by many stroke guideline producers\nincluding the European Stroke Association\nand the American Stroke Association.19 The\nlocal context of Newcastle Upon Tyne was\nto trigger the development of a further\nprotocol for use in the emergency room in\nRecognition of stroke in the emergency\nroom\nconfirming the effectiveness of FAST for\nparamedics, revealed that referrals to the\nacute stroke service from other health pro-\nfessionals, specifically GPs and A&E doc-\ntors, had around a 30% misdiagnosis rate.\nTo address this issue Ford and his team\nf\ndecided to develop a specific stroke recog-\nnition tool for use by staff in the Emergency\nRoom (ER) with the aim of improving the\naccuracy of stroke diagnosis. Thus ROSIER\noriginated as a solution to a particular local\nproblem. The development process under-\ntaken by Ford et al. illustrates not just how\ntightly medical practice has become inter-\ntwined with scientific evidence over the\nrecent past but also the continuing priority\naccorded to clinical observations and what\nmay be termed as `tacit' knowledge.\nWork began by collecting data over a\n12-month period on patient referrals to the\nacute stroke service from the ER. On\narrival at the acute stroke unit patients\nwere clinically assessed by a research neur-\nologist who was qualified in the use of the\nUS National Institutes of Health Stroke\nScale (NIHSS), or by the on call registrar\nor consultant. At the time of the clinical\nexamination, no access was given to ima-\nging results or stroke team diagnoses. This\nfirst phase focused on creating data on\nstroke and non-stroke patients' character-\nistics and evaluating these against the\nliterature so as to produce a set of\nstandardised signs and symptoms which\ntogether formed a diagnostic profile for\nstroke patients. A combination of variables\nfrom this diagnostic profile was then\nchosen for the one-page proforma with a\nscoring system for each symptom or sign.\nProspective stroke patients were to be\nscored on seven items consisting of clinical\nhistory (loss of consciousness, convulsive\nfits) and neurological signs (face, arm or\nleg weakness, speech disturbance, visual\nfield defect). Scoring was simple and `Yes'\nor `No' were the only responses available\nthus allowing only quantifiable information\nto be recorded. The proforma also\nincluded basic demographic details, blood\npressure and blood glucose concentrations\n\u00ad the latter to ensure early identification of\nhypoglycaemia, a potential stroke mimic.\nHere then, the process of standardisation\nmeshed clinical observations and scientific\nevidence to produce a form which gave a\nnumerical score. That numerical score\nrepresented the clinical diagnosis.\nYet although the form's design ensured\nthat it collected only quantitative data and\nnumerical scores, the process of its design\nincorporated softer elements such as taking\naccount of the implicit routines and prac-\ntices of the ER. In other words the setting in\nwhich the scale was to be used was instru-\nmental in shaping its design. For example,\nknowing that the ER was a very busy and\ncrowded environment meant that Ford and\nhis team consciously avoided:\n`selecting items that are difficult to\nassess . . . such as confusion and gait\nor limb ataxia. Due attention to the\ninstrument's clinical use by ER staff was\none of our primary concerns'.18\nThe implementation of ROSIER into ER\npractice was supported by special teaching\nsessions for ER staff during which Ford and\nhis team obtained feedback on the use of the\nscale in practice and refined it accordingly.\nAssessment of eye movement abnormalities\nfor example, was not included because\njunior ER staff had raised concerns about\nthe `ease of eliciting these signs' although\nlater analysis suggested that including this\nsign would have detected a further two of\nThe scale had limitations and the pro-\nforma warned that a score of 0 in some\npatients did not mean that a diagnosis of\nstroke could be dismissed completely.\nPatients suffering cerebellar strokes for\nexample displayed no motor weakness, one\nof the key measures on the scale, and were\ntherefore particularly unlikely to be recog-\nnised.23 This illustrates the difficulties in\nbureaucratising medical practice to the\nextreme. Nevertheless, implementing\nROSIER at the Freeman Hospital suc-\nceeded in improving diagnostic rates of ER\nstaff to more than 90% of possible stroke\npatients. ROSIER was welcomed widely by\nthe stroke community.\nThe ROSIER scale is an important step\nforward . . . Nor and colleagues deserve\npraise for developing a well-designed,\nrobust instrument . . . ROSIER represents\na further step along the road to optimum\nstroke care \u00ad with only 1\u00ad2% patients in\nour leading centres receiving thrombolytic\ntreatment, there is still a long way to go.24\nROSIER's legitimacy in the UK was\nsealed when it was implemented nationally\nincluded in the National Institute for\nClinical Excellence guideline on acute\nstroke and TIA.25 It has since become one\nof the best-known screening tools for diag-\nnosing stroke in the ER and clinical guide-\nlines on the management of acute stroke in\nmany parts of the world including some of\nEurope, the US, Australia and China rec-\nDiscussion\nIn summary, the paradigmatic shift to\ntreating stroke acutely, established by the\n1995 NINDS trials, created new conceptions\nof stroke as an emergency condition. The\ndifficulties of implementing tPA say much\nabout the inherent tensions engendered by\nthe global application of new knowledge in\nearly 21st-century medicine. These are gen-\nerated as much by the size and complexity of\nhealth service organisations and the multi-\nplicity of clinical specialties and practi-\ntioners as by the nature of the knowledge\nitself. There is no `easy strategy' for equili-\nbrating the `generalised truth' generated\nthrough laboratory science and randomised\ncontrol trials into medical settings and\ncommunities shaped through the specifici-\nties of time and place.27 That Ford and his\nteam chose to establish new pathways for\nacute stroke patients in Newcastle Upon\nTyne through the development of protocols\nreflects one of contemporary medicine's\nstrongest characteristics: the standardisa-\ntion of medical routines and practices\nthrough the production of evidence-based\nprotocols/guidelines which has been part of\nmedicine since the 1970s and is now `ubi-\nquitous'.21 The rise and spread of these\ninstruments has been one of the strategies\nemployed to tackle some of the most thorny\nissues in recent decades: economic savings in\nthe face of soaring health costs; the preser-\nvation of professional autonomy; and the\nassertion of order and coherence over an\nexpanding and increasingly diverse medical\nThe purpose of the Newcastle Upon Tyne\nprotocols was to translate the new evidence-\nbased therapy of tPA into practice. As\ndiscussed earlier, the barriers to establishing\nstroke as an acute emergency condition were\nmultiple and some were contingent on the\nlocal arrangements for emergency services in\nNewcastle Upon Tyne. The protocols\nproved to be a powerful bridging mechanism\nfor transferring specialist knowledge and\npractices from the specialist stroke team to\nother communities within emergency care\nservices. Ford and his team standardised the\nstroke diagnostic process by combining\nobjective and subjective sources of know-\nledge and taking the implicit routines, prac-\ntices and sensibilities of paramedics and ER\nstaff into account. Specialist knowledge was\ndistilled into the protocols in a meaningful\nform for the actors involved and promoted\nnew responses. Notably the protocols did\nnot require actors to develop new know-\nledge, but rather led them to use their\nexisting knowledge in a new way and to\nrespond differently if a positive diagnosis of\nstroke occurred by sending the patient to the\nacute stroke service as rapidly as possible.\nStroke services in Newcastle Upon Tyne\nmay well have developed differently if\nthe Freeman Hospital had had its own\nemergency department, or if Ford had not\nsucceeded in building strong working\nrelationships with the paramedics. The\nprotocols were a local solution to a local\nproblem. Nevertheless, the swift take-up of\nFAST and ROSIER as new standards in\nstroke strategies in many parts of the world\nsuggest they offered a universal solution to\ndiagnostic and organisational dilemmas\naround stroke.\nThe adoption of protocols to manage\nacute stroke can be explained in part\nthrough the striking way in which the\nmeanings embedded in the protocols chal-\nlenged historical attitudes and responses to\nstroke. Persistent conceptions of stroke as a\nnon-urgent, non-treatable condition\nmediated strongly against the introduction\nof rapid triage systems for acute stroke\npatients, not just in Newcastle Upon Tyne\nbut worldwide. We have seen how the\ndifficulties were exacerbated by inter-profes-\nsional disputes and the culture of neurology.\nBut manifest in the protocols was a new\nidentity for acute stroke patients. For the\nfirst time in the history of the specialty they\nwere cast as medical priorities within health\ncare services. No longer on the margins of\nmedicine, stroke was a condition that\ncharged the clinical community with swift\nand decisive action. The protocols served as\na simple mechanistic device for re-routing a\nparticular group of patients through health\nsystems and were a highly effective means of\nbridging knowledge across clinical commu-\nnities. Most importantly, however, they\nwere a widespread declaration of the para-\ndigm shift in stroke medicine that had\nresulted from the NINDS trials.\n"
