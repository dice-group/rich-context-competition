Multinomial logistic regressions and\npropensity score matching were used to analyze the re-\nlationships of IPV with symptoms of ADHD domains (hy-\nperactive/impulsive and inattentive) and symptoms of CD\nas well as with ADHD and CD dichotomized on the ba-\nsis of symptom criteria.\nMain Outcome Measures: Respondents' answers to\nthe 2 questions in the wave III survey reflecting perpe-\ntration of physical violence toward a partner were used\nto define IPV perpetration. Intimate partner violence per-\npetration resulting in injury or not was assessed with a\nfollow-up question.\nResults: Conduct disorder significantly predicted IPV\nperpetration both with and without injury. Controlling\nfor CD and hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention inde-\npendently predicted young adult IPV perpetration with-\nout injury. Controlling for inattention and CD, no sig-\nnificant relationship between hyperactivity/impulsivity\nand IPV perpetration without injury was found. Results\nwere different regarding IPV perpetration resulting in\ninjury. Hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not inattention,\nindependently predicted IPV perpetration resulting in\ninjury. In categorical analyses, CD predicted both types\nof IPV, and ADHD significantly predicted IPV perpetra-\ntion resulting in injury but did not significantly predict\nIPV perpetration without injury.\nConclusions: Conduct disorder is consistently associ-\nated with violence in intimate relationships. Control-\nling for CD, there is also an association between ADHD\nand IPV. Results suggest the need for services and treat-\nment strategies that specifically address the risks for vio-\nlence and promote healthy intimate relationships for\nyouths with CD and ADHD.\nis a serious public health prob-\nlem affecting millions of people\neach year in the United States. It\ncan be defined as physical, sexual,\nor psychological harm by a current or\nformer partner or spouse.1 It results in ap-\nproximately 2 million injuries requiring\nally.2,3 Other potential consequences of IPV\ninclude posttraumatic stress disorder, de-\npression, reproductive health problems, ir-\nritable bowel syndrome, and chronic\npain.4-6 The costs of IPV against women\nalone exceed an estimated $8.3 billion\nAs recognition of IPV as a serious prob-\nlem increases, research has identified vari-\nous risk factors for IPV perpetration, in-\ncluding history of being maltreated or\nwitnessing IPV during childhood, youth\nconduct problems or antisocial behav-\niors, family poverty, parental education,\nlow social capital, and traditional sex role\nnorms.2,9-12 However, one potential fac-\ntor that has received little research atten-\ntion is the presence of childhood attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nsymptoms.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-\nder is the most commonly diagnosed neu-\nrobehavioral disorder in childhood, pres-\nent in 3% to 10% of children in the United\nStates.13 Children and adolescents with\nADHD experience impairment in many\nfunctional areas and studies document that\nimpairments often persist through ado-\nlescence and young adulthood, resulting\nin adverse outcomes such as impaired aca-\ndemic functioning, low self-esteem, poor\nsocial functioning, tobacco, drug, and al-\ncohol abuse, delinquency, and conduct\nAuthor Affiliations: National\nCenter for Injury Prevention\nand Control (Drs Fang,\nMassetti, and Mercy) and\nNational Center on Birth\nDefects and Developmental\nDisabilities (Drs Ouyang and\nGrosse), Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention,\nAtlanta, Georgia.\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Given the risk of later interpersonal\nviolence in youths with elevated levels of ADHD symp-\ntoms, these may also increase the risk for IPV.\nOnly a small number of studies have examined the as-\nsociation of ADHD symptoms with the risk for IPV. In a\nsample of 65 males in a court-mandated domestic vio-\nlence treatment program, Mandell17 found that 94% had\nADHD scores above a clinical cutoff. In a college sample\nof 157 students, Theriault and Holmberg18 found that the\npresence of ADHD symptoms was a small but signifi-\ncant predictor of physical relationship aggression. While\nboth studies suggest a connection between childhood\nADHD and physical IPV, there are a number of limita-\ntions to the conclusions that can be drawn. First, both\nstudies were based on small, selected samples rather than\npopulation samples. Findings thus have limited gener-\nalizability, and results should be replicated with larger,\nrepresentative samples. Second, neither study distin-\nguished between inattention (IA) and hyperactivity/\nimpulsivity (HI) in the relationship between ADHD symp-\ntoms and partner aggression. Previous studies have shown\nthat the relationship between ADHD and other health out-\ncomes such as smoking and substance abuse are domain-\nspecific associations, with relationships related to IA or\nHI specifically.19-22 Likewise, a previous study using the\nsame data set as the present study showed a much stron-\nger association of child neglect and abuse with IA symp-\ntoms than with hyperactivity.23\nThis article investigates whether links between child-\nhood ADHD and young adult physical IPV perpetration\nmay be attributable to IA or to HI. Furthermore, given\nthe comorbidity between conduct disorder (CD) and\nplore whether ADHD is associated with young adult IPV\nwhen the co-occurrence with CD is taken into account\nor whether the ADHD-IPV relationship is fully ac-\ncounted for by CD symptoms. Studies examining the re-\nlationships between ADHD and outcomes associated with\nviolence, such as substance use and abuse, have re-\nported inconsistent findings with respect to the role of\nCD. For example, while some studies have reported that\nthe relationship between ADHD and outcomes disap-\npears when the presence of CD and other externalizing\nproblems is taken into account, others have found that\nADHD is an independent longitudinal predictor even af-\nter controlling for CD. In addition, studies have found\nthat ADHD and CD in combination may constitute a\nhigher risk for negative outcomes than either disorder\nalone.26 As CD is a consistent predictor of IPV perpetra-\ntion,27,28 the issue of the predictive relationship between\nADHD independent of and comorbid with CD is an im-\nportant one to explore.\nThis study used a US longitudinal and nationally rep-\nresentative sample to examine the relationships be-\ntween different types of childhood ADHD symptoms and\nyoung adult physical IPV perpetration (resulting in in-\njury or without injury). This study further examined\nwhether childhood ADHD symptoms predict IPV when\ncomorbidity with CD is considered.\nMETHODS\nWe used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-\nlescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal study following a\nnationally representative probability sample of adolescents in\n3 waves of Add Health data available, collected from April to\nyears, respectively.\nOf the 18 835 adolescents who participated in wave I and\nwere eligible for wave III interview, 2167 individuals could not\nbe located for wave III and 1228 individuals were located but\ndid not participate (eg, were unavailable after repeated at-\ntempts; had language barriers; were institutionalized or incar-\ncerated). In addition, 1109 individuals refused to participate,\nand data could not be used for another 9 individuals because\nof the original sample) at wave III.30 Analyses of nonresponse\nindicate that the wave III sample adequately represents the same\npopulation as the wave I sample when final sampling weights\nare used to compute population estimates.30\nOur study was based on 14 322 participants interviewed dur-\ning wave I and wave III. Participants were asked in wave III to\nreport an inventory of all sexual or romantic relationships dur-\ning the past 6 years (since wave I). Participants answered de-\ntailed questions (including the IPV questions used in the pres-\nent analyses) for sexual relationships and for those relationships\nparticipants identified as the 2 most important (detailed infor-\nmation about relationship selection is available on the Add Health\nstudy Web site, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).\nTo investigate the relationship between ADHD and young\nadult IPV perpetration, 2584 participants were excluded be-\ncause they reported no relationships during the preceding 6\nyears. This reduced the sample for analyses to 11 738 partici-\npants. An additional 500 respondents were excluded because\nthey were missing information on outcome variables or covar-\niates, resulting in a final analysis sample of 11 238 partici-\npants. For data analysis, data describing participants' sociode-\nmographic characteristics and CD symptom self-reports from\nwave I of the Add Health study were combined with wave III\nself-reported IPV perpetration and retrospective reports of child-\nhood ADHD symptoms.\nMEASURES\nPhysical IPV Perpetration\nIn wave III, in a computer-assisted self-interview, respondents\nanswered 2 questions reflecting physical IPV perpetration for\neach sexual or important intimate relationship during the past\n6 years: \"How often (if the romantic or sexual relationship lasted\nfor more than a year, add `in the past year') have you threat-\nened your partner with violence, pushed or shoved him or her,\nor thrown something at him or her that could hurt?\" and \"How\noften (if the romantic or sexual relationship lasted for more than\na year, add `in the past year') have you slapped, hit, or kicked\nyour partner?\" The following scale was used for questions re-\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Responses for each question were re-\ncoded into 2 categories (yes for scores of 1-7; no for scores of\n0) for regression analysis. Perpetration of IPV was defined as\nthe respondent answering yes to either of the 2 questions. Per-\npetration of IPV resulting in injury was assessed with a fol-\nlow-up question: \"How often has your partner had an injury\nsuch as a sprain, bruise, or cut because of a fight with you?\"\nFor those respondents who reported IPV perpetration at least\nonce during the preceding 6 years, this information was used\nto code whether the respondent had perpetrated any IPV re-\nsulting in injury (yes for 1 time; no for never).\nThe severity of IPV has been found to be associated with a va-\nriety of mental, physical, and social consequences.31 One crude\nindicator of IPV severity is whether a physical injury occurs. Ac-\ncording to a national survey, approximately 30% of women who\nwere injured as a result of IPV received health care for their in-\njuries.2 Physical injuries are associated with both the duration of\nabuse and dangerousness of the tactics used to inflict abuse (eg,\nslap vs kick vs use of a weapon).31 Therefore, IPV with injury was\nincludedasanoutcomecategoryinthisstudytodeterminewhether\nADHD was associated with more severe IPV. We classified the\nrespondents into 3 mutually exclusive categories: (1) no IPV per-\npetration history (no reported history of IPV perpetration within\nany relationship during the preceding 6 years); (2) IPV perpe-\ntration without injury (respondent reported IPV toward a part-\nner at least once during the preceding 6 years and did not report\nviolence resulting in injury); and (3) IPV perpetration resulting\nin injury (respondent reported IPV toward a partner at least once\nduring the preceding 6 years and reported violence resulting in\ninjury at least once).\nADHD and CD Symptoms\nIn wave III, participants retrospectively reported ADHD symp-\ntoms experienced between ages 5 and 12 years using a symptom\nchecklist. Participants reported the frequency of each DSM-IV\nsymptomofADHDona4-pointLikertscale:neverorrarely;some-\ntimes; often; or very often. One item (spiteful or vindictive) is not\nactually an ADHD symptom and was therefore excluded from\nanalyses, while 1 DSM-IV impulsivity symptom (often inter-\nrupts or intrudes on others) was mistakenly excluded from the\nsurvey. Analyses thus included 9 IA and 8 HI symptoms. Con-\nsistent with prior studies using symptom checklists,21,32 a symp-\ntom was considered present if it was experienced often or very\noften. The total number of symptoms reported (0-9 for IA; 0-8\nforHI)wasusedtoexaminetherelationshipbetweenADHDsymp-\ntoms and IPV. For categorical analyses, ADHD diagnostic cat-\negories were created by categorizing participants who reported\n6 or more symptoms of IA, HI, or both (consistent with DSM-IV\nADHD diagnostic criteria).\nThe measure of CD was also a symptom checklist, which\nincluded responses to the 13 DSM-IV CD symptoms collected\nat wave I. Participants were divided into CD diagnostic catego-\nries if they reported 3 or more symptoms of CD (consistent with\nDSM-IV criteria).\nSociodemographic Factors\nSeveral sociodemographic factors that have documented asso-\nciations in the literature with IPV perpetration33,34 from the wave\nI assessment were included to control for potential confound-\ners. These sociodemographic factors included race/ethnicity,\nfamily structure, primary caregiver education, biological fa-\nther's history of incarceration, family size\u00adadjusted income rela-\ntive to federal poverty level, sex, and birth year dummies (to\ncapture cohort effects). Response categories for each of these\nvariables are provided in Table 1. Missing data for the father\nincarceration variable were treated as a separate category be-\ncause 6% of the data were missing. Also, missing data for fam-\nily income were imputed as a continuous variable on the basis\nof an equation predicting income based on race/ethnicity, re-\ngion, urban or rural status, family structure, receipt of public\nassistance, and whether the residence was well kept.\nMultinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze the re-\nlationships among childhood ADHD (IA or HI symptoms), CD\nsymptoms, and young adult IPV perpetration, controlling for\nsociodemographic factors. The outcome variable was whether\nthe respondents reported no IPV perpetration, perpetrated IPV\nwithout injury, or perpetrated IPV resulting in injury. Because\nthe distributions of IA, HI, and CD symptoms were highly\nskewed with most participants reporting no symptoms, we log-\ntransformed the symptom counts to reduce skewness and then\nTable 1.

Fi-\nnally, to test the robustness of the multinomial logistic regres-\nsion results, we ran analyses with diagnostic categories using\npropensity score 1-to-1 matched samples. Propensity score\nmatching is a method used to approximate a randomized con-\ntrolled setting where cases (subjects with ADHD or CD) and\ncontrols (subjects without ADHD or CD) were compared on\nIPV perpetration (without injury or resulting in injury). Suc-\ncessful matching can reduce bias introduced by systematic dif-\nferences between subjects with ADHD (or CD) and those with-\nout ADHD (or CD) with respect to confounding covariates. A\nuser-supplied routine in Stata software, PSMATCH2, was used\nto perform nearest-neighbor propensity score matching.35 The\npropensity score method does not incorporate the survey de-\nsign (sample weights or cluster effect) because propensity score\nmatching uses only a matched subset of the full sample.\nTo assess sex differences in the associations among ADHD,\nCD, and IPV perpetration, sexsymptom dimension (or\nsexdiagnostic category) terms were added to each multino-\nmial logistic regression model. No significant interactions were\nfound between sex and each of the ADHD and CD symptom di-\nmensions or diagnostic categories in any model tested. Results\nindicated that the associations among ADHD, CD, and IPV per-\npetration were similar for males and females. Therefore, only re-\nsults of regression models including main effects are presented.\nAnalyses were conducted with Stata SE version 9 statistical\nsoftware (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The Stata soft-\nware allows for control of survey design effects of individuals\nclustered in sampling units of school and stratification of geo-\ngraphic region. Poststratification weights were applied to gen-\nerate nationally representative estimates, except for the pro-\npensity score\u00admatched estimates.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents weighted prevalence estimates and 95%\nconfidence intervals (or standard deviations) of self-\nreported ADHD symptoms, CD symptoms, IPV perpe-\ntration, and other sample characteristics. The weighted\npercentages of respondents reporting ADHD symptoms\nand CD symptoms above DSM-IV cutoffs were 8.4% and\n12.4% respectively, which were similar to previously re-\nported prevalence rates.21,36,37 Similarly, the reported rate\nof IPV perpetration (27.1%, including IPV perpetration\nboth without injury and resulting in injury) appears com-\nparable to prevalence data of IPV victimization from other\nTable 2 presents the unadjusted bivariate relation-\nships between ADHD and CD diagnostic categories and\nIPV perpetration.

However, IA symptoms\nsignificantly predicted IPV perpetration without injury\neven when HI and CD symptoms were controlled, with\na 1-SD increase in the logarithm of IA symptoms increas-\ning the odds of IPV perpetration without injury by 9%.\nTable 2.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nwas not significantly associated with IPV perpetration\nwithout injury, while CD significantly increased the odds\nof IPV perpetration without injury by 95% when con-\ntrolling for ADHD. In analyses predicting IPV perpetra-\ntion resulting in injury, ADHD significantly predicted IPV\nperpetration resulting in injury (OR=1.71) and re-\nmained a significant predictor when controlling for CD\n(OR=1.53). Conduct disorder tripled the odds of IPV per-\npetration resulting in injury (OR=3.20) when control-\nling for ADHD.\nTo further examine the unique effect of ADHD on IPV\nperpetration, we classified the respondents into 4 mu-\ntually exclusive categories based on ADHD and CD symp-\ntoms: (1) no ADHD or CD (no symptom counts above\nDSM-IV criteria for either ADHD or CD; 81.2% of the\nsample); (2) ADHD only (symptom counts above DSM-IV\ncriteria for ADHD but not CD; 6.4% of the sample); (3)\nCD only (symptom counts above DSM-IV criteria for CD\nbut not ADHD; 10.5% of the sample); or (4) ADHD and\nCD (symptom counts above DSM-IV criteria for both\nADHD and CD; 1.9% of the sample). The lower half of\nTable 4 shows the results of multinomial logistic regres-\nsions on the ADHD and CD categories in predicting IPV\nperpetration, controlling for sociodemographic factors.\nThe ADHD only category was not a significant predictor\nof IPV perpetration without injury, whereas both the CD\nonly category and the ADHD and CD category signifi-\ncantly predicted IPV perpetration without injury. The\nADHD only category significantly and uniquely pre-\ndicted IPV perpetration resulting in injury (OR=1.81).\nThe results were consistent with those from analyses ex-\namining ADHD and CD diagnostic categories sepa-\nrately, suggesting that ADHD by itself is not a signifi-\ncant predictor of IPV perpetration without injury.\nHowever, the ADHD only category significantly pre-\ndicted IPV perpetration resulting in injury, as did the CD\nonly category and the ADHD and CD category.\nAfter applying 1-to-1 propensity score matching, no dif-\nferences on matching variables between the subjects with\nTable 3.

The magnitudes and signifi-\ncance of the ORs obtained from the propensity score\nmatching (Table 5) are similar to those obtained from\nthe full-sample multinomial logistic regressions, sug-\ngesting that the results are robust.\nCOMMENT\nThis study examined the relationships among child-\nhood ADHD, CD, and IPV perpetration in young adult-\nhoodusingapopulation-basedUSsample.Consistentwith\nprior studies,28 CD was associated with IPV with and with-\noutinjury.Furthermore,retrospectivelyreportedIAsymp-\ntoms appeared to uniquely contribute to IPV perpetra-\ntion without injury after controlling for HI and CD\nsymptoms. The significant partial relationship between\nHI symptoms and IPV perpetration without injury dis-\nappeared when IA and CD symptoms were controlled.\nThe associations with IPV perpetration resulting in in-\njury were in the opposite direction; HI symptoms sig-\nnificantly and uniquely predicted IPV perpetration re-\nsulting in injury, whereas the relationship between IA\nsymptoms and IPV perpetration resulting in injury was\nnot significant when HI and CD symptoms were con-\ntrolled. There were no significant sex interactions in these\nrelationships, suggesting similar relationships among\nADHD, CD, and IPV perpetration for males and fe-\nmales. Our findings suggest that IA and HI are differen-\ntially predictive of IPV without injury and IPV resulting\nin injury, controlling for CD. Results indicate that diffi-\nculties with IA are associated with IPV without injury but\nnot with IPV resulting in injury. Further research is needed\nto understand the connection between IA and IPV with-\nout injury and why this association is not found for more\nsevere forms of violence. While HI was not significantly\nassociated with IPV perpetration without injury control-\nling for CD and IA, the difference in ORs between HI and\nIntimatepartnerviolenceresultingininjurywasuniquely\nassociated with HI but not IA. These findings indicate that\nimpulse control problems constitute a higher risk for per-\npetrationofseriousviolence.Impulsecontrolproblemshave\nbeenlinkedtoimpulsiveaggressionandproblemswithemo-\ntion regulation and frustration tolerance.39 As a limitation\ntoourfindingsregardingimpulsivity,thereareonly3symp-\ntoms of impulsivity in the DSM-IV, compared with 9 symp-\ntoms of IA and 6 of hyperactivity. Additionally, due to er-\nror, the survey included only 2 of the 3 impulsivity\nsymptoms. As a result, the measurement of impulsivity in\nour data was limited. In fact, the association between im-\npulsecontrolproblemsandIPVmaybehigher.Futurestud-\nies are needed to examine the specific phenomena (verbal\nimpulsivity,relationshipconflict,impulsiveaggression)un-\nderlying the associations between IA, HI, and IPV of dif-\nfering severity. Research is also needed to examine such\nassociations in diagnosed samples.\nThe analyses using categorical classification of ADHD\nin predicting IPV perpetration indicated that the rela-\ntionship between ADHD and IPV perpetration without\ninjury is not significant. However, ADHD alone (ie, ADHD\nwithout CD) was a significant predictor of IPV perpe-\ntration resulting in injury. The association between prob-\nable ADHD and IPV perpetration resulting in injury may\nfurther reflect the contribution of impulsive aggression\nand emotion dysregulation.\nOur study makes an important contribution to the lit-\nerature in understanding the role of ADHD symptoms\nin the development of IPV. As predicted, CD symptoms\nwere a strong and consistent risk factor for violence;\nADHD symptoms and particularly ADHD without the\npresence of CD also constituted a significant risk for IPV.\nAs intervention and violence prevention efforts often fo-\ncus on conduct problems, youths with ADHD symp-\ntoms alone may not receive important services to ad-\ndress the development of healthy, nonviolent\nrelationships. These findings are consistent with those\nof longitudinal prospective studies showing that chil-\ndren with ADHD but not CD are still at increased risk\nTable 5.

In-\ntimate partner violence was assessed using only self-\nreports and thus are subject to all possible biases and limi-\ntations inherent to this form of measurement, such as\nrecall bias, social desirability, and reporting bias.43 As an-\nother concern, this study is limited in the number of ques-\ntions available to define IPV. The 3 questions in the Add\nHealth study do not capture all forms of partner vio-\nlence assessed by validated scales for IPV, and no infor-\nmation was collected about the causes or function of vio-\nlence.43 Future work is needed to replicate our findings\nwith data using validated scales and to examine causes\nand contextual influences of IPV.\nAnother limitation is that IPV was primarily mea-\nsured on a subset of relationships. It is unclear whether\nthe study findings would be the same with a more di-\nverse sample of relationships. However, the rate of IPV\nperpetration based on the sexual or important relation-\nships is consistent with prevalence data of IPV victim-\nization from other national surveys.38 An additional limi-\ntation is the potential for selection bias in that the study\nfocuses on young adults who reported intimate relation-\nships in the preceding 6 years. However, the study ex-\namined the distribution of ADHD and CD between those\nwho reported intimate relationships and those who did\nnot and found that the percentage of those reporting\nADHD and CD were approximately equal (not statisti-\ncally significant). Moreover, participants who remained\nin the sample did not differ from those who were ex-\nspectively), sex (50% vs 53% female, respectively), and\nrace/ethnicity (69% vs 61% white, respectively).\nFinally, imputation methods were used for handling the\nmore than 20% of missing values of reported family in-\ncome. To check the robustness of results, we performed\nthe statistical analysis with complete data only (ie, limited\ntothosewhoreportedfamilyincome).Themagnitudesand\nsignificance of the ORs obtained from the complete case\nanalysis are similar to those obtained from analysis using\nimputation, providing some assurance that imputation had\nlittle effect on study conclusions.\nOur findings have important implications for inter-\nvention and prevention. Evidence-based treatment for\nADHD includes stimulant medication, behavioral par-\nent training, and school-based behavioral treatment.44\nWhile these approaches are effective in reducing the im-\npairment of children with ADHD, there are very few evi-\ndence-basedtreatmentapproachesforadolescents.44-46 Our\nfindings suggest that youths with ADHD are at signifi-\ncant risk for experiencing partner conflict and perpetrat-\ning IPV, yet involvement in romatic relationships typi-\ncally begins in adolescence, when youths with ADHD are\nleast likely to receive treatment. These findings provide\nsupport for the need to continue evidence-based ser-\nvices for adolescents with ADHD and to address healthy\nrelationship skills. The same is true for CD as services\noften do not extend into adolescence and typically fo-\ncus on delinquency prevention but have less explicit em-\nphasis on development of healthy, nonviolent dating re-\nlationships. Couples in whom 1 partner experiences\nclinically significant levels of IA, HI, and/or conduct prob-\nlems may be at elevated risk for IPV. Traditional ap-\nproaches to prevent IPV may not be sufficient for those\ncouples if they do not address the specific issues related\nto ADHD and CD.\nSubmitted for Publication: December 2, 2009; final re-\nCorrespondence: Xiangming Fang, PhD, National Cen-\nter for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Dis-\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Fang had full access to all of\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nFinancial Disclosure: None reported.\nDisclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this report\nare those of the authors and do not necessarily repre-\nsent the official position of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention.\nAdditional Information: This research uses data from Add\nHealth, a program project designed by J.
