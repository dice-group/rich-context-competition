They typically appear among close kin, as\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\npredicted and explained by inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton 1964), according to which\nthe costs of altruistic helping can be outweighed by increased reproductive success.\nHowever, close social bonds including considerable altruistic helping are also found\nbetween non-related individuals across a wide range of social species (Massen, Streck, and\nde Vos 2010; Seyfarth and Cheney, 2012), raising the question of which ultimate and\nproximate mechanisms can promote such cooperation and exchange.\nReciprocal altruism is the standard ultimate explanation for how friendships can\narise between non-kin (Laursen and Hartup, 2002; Trivers, 1971). In abstract models,\nreciprocal altruism follows a tit-for-tat strategy where you help those who help you.\nProsocial emotions (e.g., guilt, gratitude, and sympathy) may function as proximate\nmechanisms driving behavioral reciprocity between close, non-related associates (Trivers,\n1971). Pro-social emotions may also help individuals to monitor and track exchanges both\nin specific situations (Clark and Ayers, 1993; Tooby and Cosmides, 1996) and over time,\nserving as emotional shortcuts for whom to trust and to help (Clark and Ayers, 1993;\nAlthough the body of research comparing friends to kin has grown in recent years\n(e.g., Ackerman, Kenrick, and Schaller, 2007; Apicella, Marlowe, Fowler, and Christakis,\nare few studies of relations between peers (for a recent review, see McHale, Updegraff, and\nWhiteman, 2012). Here, we study the proximate mechanisms of peer bonds in human\nadults by comparing how gratitude and reciprocity are manifested between siblings and\nfriends.\nGratitude is a moral affect that motivates and reinforces future prosocial behavior\n(McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, and Larson, 2001; McCullough, Kimeldorf, and\nCohen, 2008). It can be elicited by acts that have a value to the recipient and incur a cost to\nthe benefactor (Algoe, Haidt, and Gable, 2008), suggesting that gratitude may fuel\nreciprocal altruism. Empirical research has found that inducing feelings of gratitude\nincreases altruism (DeSteno, Bartlett, Baumann, Williams, and Dickens, 2010; Tsang,\n2006) and that gratitude plays an important role when new friendships are being formed\n(Algoe et al., 2008). However, it is not known what function gratitude plays between\nfriends after the initial bond has been formed.\nIn humans, the importance of how and when to reciprocate a favor varies with\nsocial distance. It typically matters less when dealing with kin than when dealing with\nfriends (e.g., Osinksy, 2009; Rachlin and Jones, 2008), and most when dealing with\nare not exclusively based on reciprocal altruism and often lack exact bookkeeping of help\ngiven and received (Clark, Mills and Powell, 1986; Roberts, 2005; Tooby and Cosmides,\n1996; for a summary, see Hruschka, 2010). Kin interactions are also characterized by more\ninstrumental and high-cost support, whereas friends typically provide each other with more\nemotional and less costly support (Park and Ackerman, 2011), in the absence of which\nfriendships deteriorate more rapidly than do kin relations (Roberts and Dunbar, 2011).\nThere is, thus, an overlap between kin and friend relations regarding prosocial\nemotions such as gratitude. Close friends may be likened to or even treated \"like a\nbrother/sister\" (Voorpostel and van der Lippe, 2007), suggesting that very close friendships\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nmay activate cognitive mechanisms that originally evolved among primate kin (Kummer,\ntreated more \"like friends,\" since they are typically of the same age cohort as friends.\nFurther, it is possible that sibling competition for parental investment (Lawson and Mace,\n2009; Trivers, 1974) increases the need for reciprocity and exchange monitoring among\nsiblings compared to other kin.\nThere is some evidence that people feel more grateful towards help given by non-\nrelatives than relatives (Bar-Tal, Bar-Zohar, Greenberg, and Hermon, 1977). However,\ngratitude among close social relations has been largely ignored in the empirical literature. If\ngratitude serves to promote and monitor reciprocal altruism, we would expect that people\nfeel more grateful towards friends than towards their siblings. Further, we would expect\nthat a lack of gratitude from the beneficiary would bother the benefactor more with friends\nthan with siblings.\nEmotional closeness serves to maintain both kin and reciprocal altruism\n(Korchmaros and Kenny, 2001; Kruger, 2003). Psychological mechanisms that initially\nevolved to promote kin altruism, but were later extended to unrelated individuals, may be\nbased on propinquity, similarity, and frequency of interaction (Korchmaros and Kenny,\n2006). We are more likely to help people to whom we feel emotionally close. However,\nthere is also evidence for a so-called kinship premium: Even when controlling for\nemotional closeness, kin may receive more altruistic help than friends (Curry, Roberts, and\nHere, we compare relations to same-sex friends and siblings only. This is because\nfriends are usually of the same sex and age, and also because we wanted to compare\npossible sex differences in social styles. Several friendship studies have found no or minor\nsex differences (Brewer, Abell, and Lyons, 2013; Roberts and Dunbar, 2011; Stewart-\nWilliams, 2007), whereas some meta-analytical reviews detected consistent sex differences\nin children's close friendship (Rose and Rudolph, 2006). Many of these sex differences\nappear to increase during adolescence, but data on adult friendships are scarce (Hall, 2010).\nIt has also been claimed that women are more prone to extend a \"kinship module\"\n(Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007) to their friends than men are (Ackerman et al.,\nFollowing the theories of kin altruism and of reciprocal altruism origins of\nfriendship, we expect the importance of gratitude and reciprocity, as well as emotional\ncloseness, to be more pronounced among friends than among siblings (Hypothesis 1).\nSecond, we expect relationship closeness to moderate the importance of gratitude and\nreciprocity, so that the associations will vary depending on felt closeness but remain more\nimportant in friendships, irrespective of relationship closeness (Hypothesis 2). We also\nexplore possible sex differences in these associations.\nMaterials and Methods\nin an online survey on \"relationships between friends and siblings.\" The survey was\nadvertised to students at three universities in the UK and one university in Finland through\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nthe researchers' social media networks, student email lists, and through research\nparticipation websites. The survey was in English and open for individuals who self-\nidentified as having a same-sex sibling. Participants were from 31 countries, but the great\nmajority were from three countries: the UK (36%), Finland (36%), and the US (21%).\nParticipants with adopted siblings and half siblings were removed from the analysis,\nWe asked participants to think about a certain same-sex sibling or same-sex friend.\nIf they had several such siblings or friends, they were instructed to think about the one they\nfelt closest to. We created three short vignettes describing two scenarios, designed to elicit\nfeelings of gratitude for emotional or financial help (here referred to as \"emotional\ngratitude\" and \"financial gratitude\"): one scenario eliciting annoyance due to lack of\ngratitude for emotional support (\"emotional reciprocity\"), and one scenario for the\nimportance of paying back a debt (\"financial reciprocity\") (see Appendix). The vignettes\nwere rated on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = \"not grateful / bothered / important at all,\" 9 =\n\"very grateful / bothered / important\"). For the regression analysis the raw scores were\nconverted into standardized t score coefficients, which are based on z-scores but with a\nstandard deviation of 10 units and centered on 50. These scores were used because they\npermit comparisons of regressions results.\nPrior to the study, we conducted a pilot survey testing the emotions that the\nscenarios evoke on 32 participants, who gave a free response to the question \"How would\nyou feel in this situation?\" The majority indicated feelings of gratitude in the scenarios\nwhere they were the recipients of help, and anger and disappointment in the scenarios\nwhere they did not receive gratitude when they had provided help.\nRelationship closeness was assessed by asking the participants how close they feel\ntowards the target, how much they like the target, and how similar they feel to the target, all\nrated on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = \"not at all,\" 9 = \"very much\"). These were averaged to\ncreate an index for felt closeness ( = .62 for friends,  = .83 for siblings). Additional\ncovariates included participant age and the degree of relatedness to sibling (half, full, or\nadopted sibling); all but full siblings were removed from the data.\nOn entering the survey, participants were first directed to a participant information\npage with brief details and relevant ethics information. After that, participants filled in\ndemographic information, rated the questions relating to perceived closeness and similarity,\nand were given the following instructions:\nPlease think about a good SAME SEX friend (if you have several friends, think\nabout the one you feel closest to). If you are a woman, think about a good female\nfriend. If you are a man, think about a good male friend.\nAfter rating the vignettes relating to friends, participants were given the same\ninstructions, and they were asked to rate the same vignettes thinking about a same-sex\nsibling. The order of the friend and sibling conditions was counter-balanced for different\nparticipants. In a series of Mixed ANOVAs (independent variable = order of the condition,\ndependent variable = rating of friends/sibling vignettes), we found that the order of the\ncondition did not affect the ratings. After the rating task, participants were thanked for their\ntime and provided with contact details of the researchers.\nAssociations of sex, relationship type (friend or kin), and relationship closeness\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nwith the outcomes (gratitude and reciprocity) were assessed using random-intercept\nmultilevel regression in which ratings for kin and friend were treated as repeated nested\nmeasurements within individuals. The analyses were carried out with descriptive statistics\nand the xtreg procedure of STATA 12.\nResults\nHypothesis 1. We first studied whether the rated importance of gratitude and\nreciprocity was more pronounced amongst friends than siblings. This was the case for all\nfour vignettes, and also for reported emotional closeness (see Table 1). The differences\nbetween friends and siblings were all significant (Bonferroni adjusted t-tests, all ps < .001)\nexcept for emotional reciprocity in male participants (p = .09). Women gave significantly\nhigher ratings than men for all relationship types and scenarios. Sex differences by\nrelationship type were significant (p < .01), except for the importance of financial\nreciprocity between siblings (p = .23).\nTable 1.

All\ngroup differences were statistically significant, except those marked by a. n = 583 women, 189 men.\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nTable 2.

Values are coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) of multilevel regression models.  0 = Women,\n1 = Men,  0 = Sibling, 1 = Friend, * p < .05. All models are adjusted for participant's age.\nThe effect size for these differences ranged from small to moderate (Cohen's ds: .18\nto .47 in the four scenarios) and was largest of all measures in relationship closeness,\nespecially in men. Hypothesis 1 was also tested with multilevel regression models (see\nTable 2, Model 1), which include interaction effects between sex and relationship type.\nThe negative values on the first line in Model 1 indicate that for each of the four\nvignettes, men gave significantly lower ratings compared to women, who constitute the\nreference group. The positive values on the second line in Model 1 indicate that friends are\nconsistently and significantly given higher ratings in all four vignettes compared to\nsiblings, which constitute the reference group. The last line in this model illustrates the\ninteraction between sex and relationship type. A significant interaction effect was not\nobserved for the three scenarios concerning gratitude, but was observed for the scenario\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nconcerning financial reciprocity, indicating that it was more important for women that their\nfriend returned a loan compared to their sister, than it was for men that their friend returned\na loan compared to their brother.\nHypothesis 2. Next, we examined whether relationship closeness moderated the\nabove associations (see Table 2, Model 2). The moderating effect of closeness was\nstatistically significant in all four scenarios, being positive for emotional and financial\ngratitude and negative for emotional and financial reciprocity. Being close to a friend or\nsibling tends to increase gratefulness and dampen expectations of reciprocity towards these\npersons. Sex differences persisted in all scenarios even after controlling for closeness, as\nindicated by the negative values in the first line in Model 2. These differences were\nstatistically significant except in the case of financial reciprocity.\nFriends also received higher scores compared to siblings when taking emotional\ncloseness into account. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which displays the regression-based\npredicted probabilities for each scenario and relationship type when holding closeness\nconstant.\nFigure 1. Predicted means for scenarios of gratitude and reciprocity by sex and relationship\ntype after controlling for relationship closeness and age\nNote. Bars indicate raw scores converted into standardized t score regression\ncoefficients (SD = 10 and centered on 50); error bars are 95% confidence intervals.\nThere was no longer any interaction between sex and relationship type after\ncontrolling for relationship closeness (see Table 2, Model 2). The significant interaction\nbetween sex and financial reciprocity in Model 1 lost statistical significance in Model 2.\nThe three last lines of Model 2 (see Table 2) display interaction effects. We see that\nthe effect of closeness significantly interacted with relationship type in emotional gratitude,\nbeing stronger among siblings. Closeness also significantly interacted with sex concerning\nthe importance of emotional and financial reciprocity, its impact being lower among men\ncompared to women. For emotional reciprocity, the interaction between closeness and both\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nsex and relationship type was significant. The strengths of these associations with closeness\nare illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2.

Bars indicate standardized regression coefficients (SD = 1); error bars\nare 95% confidence intervals.\nCloseness was positively associated with feelings of emotional and financial\ngratitude (see Figure 2, top panel), with the exception of financial gratitude among male\nfriends. Conversely, feeling close to the target was generally negatively associated with the\nimportance of emotional and financial reciprocity (see Figure 2, bottom panel). The\ninteresting exception is that closeness is associated with stronger rather than weaker\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nimportance of showing emotional reciprocity among friends, although the association is\nstatistically significant only among male friends as compared to brothers (see Table 2,\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study investigating the role of gratitude in kin versus non-kin\nrelations. As predicted in the first hypothesis, participants rated their expected feelings of\nemotional and financial gratitude higher, and assigned higher importance to emotional and\nfinancial reciprocity, when dealing with same-sex friends as opposed to same-sex siblings.\nOur results support the view of gratitude as a prosocial emotion that serves to trigger and\nmaintain reciprocal interactions in friendships (Algoe et al., 2008; Trivers, 1971). Although\nthe effect sizes for gratitude by relationship type were not large, this is in line with previous\nstudies that have found relatively small but persistent differences between friends and kin\nPerceived closeness to the target affected expected feelings of gratitude and the\nimportance of reciprocity. People appear to be more grateful to those they are close to, and\nto be both closer and more grateful to their friends compared to their siblings. The\ndifferences between kin and siblings persisted when controlling for closeness, in line with\nour second hypothesis. Even after taking into account the boosting effect of closeness on\ngratitude, people are more grateful towards their friends than their siblings. This is in line\nwith other studies suggesting a \"kin premium\" that is not dependent on relationship quality\n(Curry et al., 2012; Rachlin and Jones, 2008). We appear to take kin support as self-evident,\nwhich is why felt and expected gratitude is weaker between siblings compared to friends.\nWomen rated the importance of gratitude and reciprocity higher than men did, but\nthere were no sex differences in the differential treatment of siblings versus friends. Only in\nthe question measuring the importance of paying back a financial debt did women treat\nfriends less like siblings compared to men, suggesting that women may be more attuned to\nhighly monitoring friends than men are (Geary, Byrd-Craven, Hoard, Vigil, and Numtee,\n2003; Geary and Flinn, 2002). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for\nrelationship closeness. This result is in line with previous studies finding no interaction\nwith target or recipient sex in gratitude related to helping and harm-doing (Bar-Tal et al.,\n1977), altruistic punishment (O'Gorman et al., 2005, or altruistic helping (Curry et al.,\na general tendency among women to treat close friends more like kin than men do. Of\ncourse, an extended \"kinship module\" characteristic of female friendships may still\nfunction in specific situations such as high-cost help, or with regards to specific emotions\nRelationship closeness tended to make participants both more grateful and more\nlikely to forgive failed reciprocity. However, closeness had partly different effects on\nsibling and friend relations. Expected feelings of gratitude and the importance of showing\ngratitude were more strongly associated with closeness among siblings than among friends.\nThis is somewhat surprising, giving the lower importance of closeness predicted by\nevolutionary theory among kin compared to friends. Another study also found a similar\nGratitude for help among adult friends and siblings\nresult: The effect of contact frequency on the provision and reception of emotional support\nwas stronger among siblings compared to friends (Voorpostel and van der Lippe, 2007).\nThis pattern may stem from a selection effect. In contemporary, developed, low-\nfertility societies, people have a larger pool of potential close friends than of potential close\nsame-sex siblings. Sibling competition and rivalry also affect ties between siblings more\nthan they do between friends. Several open commentaries to our survey stressed the\nintensity of sibling competition: \"My answers don't give a fair representation of how much\nI hate my sister\" (20 year-old UK woman); \"I would never confide in her for anything and\ndo not respect her as an adult on any level\" (38-year old US woman); \"My friends are\nbetter than my sister, generally speaking. Almost everybody is better than my sister, even\nmy brother-in-law, and I can't stand him. I cannot imagine her helping me under any\ncircumstances\" (47-year old Spanish woman). A few men refused to fill in the survey\nbecause they found it impossible to imagine any situation in which their brother would help\nthem in any way. In line with this interpretation, Stewart-Williams (2007) found altruistic\nhelp among siblings to match that among friends. He suggested that this may stem from kin\naltruism being stronger in cross-generational relations such as the parent-child bond, where\nhelp flows to the younger, than in intragenerational relations between kin who are of\nsimilar need and reproductive value (see also Niezink, 2008). Between siblings in\nparticular, altruism and companionship coexist with conflict and competition (McHale et\nA major benefit of our study is that it compared friends with peer kin, in this case\nsiblings. Other evolutionary studies have collapsed close friends and kin (Bar-Tal et al.,\n1977) or not differentiated between different types of kin (Ackerman et al., 2007; Niezink,\n2008). Among the limitations of our study is the absence of scenarios including other peers\nsuch as cousins, as well as acquaintances and strangers, which would both have further\nilluminated the relative similarities and differences between kin and friends. We also tested\nfor imagined emotional responses rather than actual reactions. Men were underrepresented\nas respondents, although this is typical for these kinds of surveys. Further, we did not\ngather data on the age of friends, so we could not compare age differences between siblings\nand friends. Neither did we include opposite-sex friends or siblings.\nWe conclude that gratitude follows the logic of reciprocal altruism in close\nfriendships, and to a higher degree among friends than with siblings. Although a very close\nsibling may elicit as much emotional gratitude as a close friend does, even a very close\nfriend is not exempt from the logic of reciprocity in the same way that a sibling is. There is\nno evidence that women treat friends more like siblings compared to men in expressions of\ngratitude. The complex interactions between emotional closeness and sociality highlight the\nneed for further studies on how both altruism and competition shape peer relations.\n"
