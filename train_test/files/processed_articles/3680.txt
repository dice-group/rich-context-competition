In the case of vision, it is the representation of occluded parts of\nobjects we see: When we see a cat behind a picket fence, our perceptual system represents\nthose parts of the cat that are occluded by the picket fence.\nWe also get amodal completion in nonvisual sense modalities. In tactile perception, it is\nthe completion of those parts of the objects we touch that are not in direct contact with our\nhand, for example. We complete those parts amodally.\nIn the case of audition, when we hear a loud bang while listening to a tune, the auditory\nsystem continues to represent the tune even in that brief moment when the bang is the only\nauditory stimulation. What we have here is a form of temporal occlusion, where the bang\noccludes part of the tune. A popular demonstration of auditory amodal completion is\nthe American late night show host Jimmy Kimmel's segment ``A week in unnecessary\nCorresponding author:\nBence Nanay, University of Antwerp, Prinsstraat 14, Antwerp 2000, Belgium.\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/\nopen-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\ncensorship,'' where he beeps out completely harmless words from famous politicians, making\nthem sound like expletives.\nIn the history of psychology, people often made a distinction between modal and amodal\ncompletion. Given that this distinction was made differently by different psychologists, this\nneeds a bit of discussion (see Singh, 2004 for a good overview of some of the differences\nbetween modal and amodal completion).\nThe standard way of drawing this distinction is as follows (see, e.g., Tse, 1999, pp. 37\u00ad38).\nIn the case of the amodal perception, we represent objects behind an occluder, whereas in the\ncase of modal completion, we represent an object in front of inducers, as in the case of the\nKanizsa triangle.\nAlbert Michotte, who introduced the term, however, drew the distinction in terms of\nphenomenology (Michotte & Burke, 1951). In the original Michotte account, the difference\nis that while in the case of modal completion we experience the illusory contour as a contour\nbetween two different colors, amodally completed contours are experienced without a\nperceived color difference. Unfortunately, often a much less sophisticated\nphenomenological difference is posited between modal and amodal completion, along the\nlines that while we consciously experience the modally completed contours, we do not\nconsciously experience amodally completed contours (it should be added that Michotte\nhimself was not always crystal clear about the nature of this phenomenological difference,\nsee, e.g., Michotte, Thine\n\u00b4 s, & Crabbe\n\u00b4 , 1964). The Kanizsa triangle would count as modal\ncompletion on this approach as well but for a different reason: The completed contours are\nvisually experienced as a contour between two different colors.\nNeither of these ways of keeping apart modal and amodal completion is very convincing.\nThe standard version is especially confusing as many instances of subjective contours fail\nto correspond either to something behind an occluder or something in front of inducers.\nTake the horse illusion, for example:\nThis is an illusion because many people visually represent a long horse where the black\nrectangle is. In that row, they see not five but four horses, one of which is a sausage horse. But\nwould this count as amodal or modal completion according to the standard account? The\nhorse is neither behind the rectangle nor in front of it. In fact, it could be seen as either--we\ncould even intentionally switch these two possible visual interpretations if we want to. And\nmany illusory contours work in the same way: They can be seen both as being occluded or\nbeing induced. In other words, the occluded or induced distinction is unlikely to be a very\nuseful one when it comes to keeping apart modal and amodal completion (see also Michotte\nBut how about the phenomenology-based distinction? I am skeptical of attributing too\nmuch importance to phenomenology in general and to a phenomenological way of drawing\nthe modal versus amodal completion distinction in particular. One reason for skepticism is\nthe significant interpersonal variations in amodal completion (see Sekuler & Palmer, 1992)\nand, more generally, in the vividness of nonretinal visual phenomena (Bergmann, Genc,\nDijkstra, Bosch, & van Gerven, 2017). I frequently give talks where I show the horse\nillusion to the audience, and each time the audience is divided whether they ``see'' a long\nhorse. According to at least some versions of the phenomenology-based distinction, this\nwould mean that some people in the audience complete modally, some others amodally.\nBut this would make the distinction somewhat arbitrary.\nThe aim of this discussion is not to dismiss any distinction between modal and amodal\nI raised these points because of the lack of clarity about just what counts as amodal\ncompletion. The deeper point here is that the neural mechanisms responsible for modal\nand amodal completion are the same. In both cases, we have shape completion already\nin the primary visual cortex (see Bakin, Nakayama, & Gilbert, 2000; Ban et al., 2013;\nJongsma, Koning, & van Lier, 2014; Hedge', Fang, Murray, & Kersten, 2008; Komatsu,\nWit, & Van Lier, 2009).1 In other words, from a neuroscience point of view, modal and\namodal completion are very similar, if not equivalent (Davis & Driver, 1994; Driver, Davis,\nKellman & Shipley, 1991) . From this perspective, the difference between whether the\nsubjective contour is conscious and unconscious and the difference between whether it is\noccluded or induced are superficial differences. As a result, I will treat them as superficial\ndifferences in what follows.\nAmodal completion is not a perceptual curiosity: It is part of our ordinary perception. It\nhappens very rarely in real-life situations that we can perceive an object without exercising\namodal completion: In natural scenes, we always get occlusion because objects tend not to be\nfully transparent. Every time we see an object occluded by another object (which means every\ntime we see anything in real life, barring odd cases of fully translucent visual scenes or very\nsimple visual displays), we use amodal completion of the occluded parts of perceived objects\n(Bakin et al., 2000). And the same goes for the backside of any solid object--sometimes\nreferred to as self-occlusion. Again, we do not receive any sensory stimulation that would\ncorrespond to the backside of solid three-dimensional objects, but there is nonetheless\nperceptual processing of this missing information--in a way reminiscent of amodal\nWhat Kind of Mental State Is Amodal Perception?\nWhen we see a cat behind the picket fence, we represent those parts of the cat that are\noccluded by the picket fence. The question is this: How do we do so? What kind of\nrepresentations are the ones that we use in amodal completion?\nThere seem to be three straightforward answers (see also Kanizsa and Gerbino 1982):\n(i) Amodal completion represents perceptually. Amodal completion is really perception as\nmuch as sensory stimulation-driven perception is.\n(ii) Amodal completion represents by means of beliefs or some other postperceptual mental\nstates.\n(iii) Amodal completion represents by means of mental imagery.\nI argue that empirical findings support (iii). (i) and (ii) are not empirically plausible ways\nof thinking about amodal completion (this is a different argument from the one I provide in\nI do not take (i) to be a serious contender as we have no (local) sensory stimulation in\namodal completion and we also lack any causal link with the represented feature--two\nextremely widely shared necessary conditions on perceiving.2 First, it has been very widely\nagreed on that perceiving implies having sensory stimulation. In the case of amodal\ncompletion, of course there is sensory stimulation--the perceptual system completes the\nfigure amodally on the basis of this retinal stimulation. But there is no local retinal\nstimulation that would correspond to the amodally completed feature.\nIt should be emphasized that this claim is much weaker than saying that perception is\nobject-involving or that it presupposes that the perceived object is in front of us and we are in\nperceptual contact with it. Even if there are no objects in front of us or the light that hits our\nretina fails to come from them, we can still have sensory stimulation--we can still have light\n(coming from somewhere) hitting our retina. It is this latter much weaker condition that I take\nto be necessary for perception.\nCan one insist that perception does not require (local) sensory stimulation? Yes. J. J. Gibson,\nfor example, did just that: He argued that amodal completion is genuinely perceptual. As he\nsays, ``the perception of occlusion, it seems to me, entails the perception of something which is\noccluded'' (Gibson 1972, p. 229). Gibson's way of thinking about perception is very much\nagainst the mainstream in psychology. But there are some other, more interesting,\ndissenters. One interesting view in this context is Roy Sorensen's. Sorensen argues explicitly\nthat sensory stimulation is not necessary for perception (Sorensen, 1999, 2007): Hearing\nsilence, for example, is still hearing and it is different from being deaf. But even if we accept\nSorensen's view, it would still not make amodal completion perceptual. He writes: ``To see an\nobject, the object must be causally responsible for the visual information'' (Sorensen, 1999, p.\n45). The cat's occluded tail is not causally responsible for any visual information; thus, we\ncannot represent it perceptually. So even if we deny that sensory stimulation is necessary for\nperception, unless we also deny some kind of causal link as necessary for perception, we can\nsafely conclude that amodal completion does not represent perceptually.\nBut how does amodal completion represent then? The second option was that it represents\nby means of beliefs or some other postperceptual mental states. Here is a serious empirical\nproblem with this proposal: We have plenty of evidence that amodal completion happens\nvery early in perceptual processing. It is well-documented that there is early cortical\nprocessing in amodal completion and even processing already in the primary visual cortex\nThis should be a decisive objection to account (ii): If amodal completion happens in the\nprimary visual cortex, it is not happening on the level of beliefs or nonperceptual\nrepresentations--it happens much earlier. But the proponents of account (ii) have a\nsomewhat desperate way of responding: They could say that the early cortical activation is\nnot amodal completion--It is a consequence of the amodal completion that is done by\nbeliefs. So the view proponents of account (ii) could argue, as a last resort, that amodally\ncompleted properties are represented by beliefs and this, in turn, activates the primary visual\ncortex by means of some kind of top-down influence.\nThere are two problems with this response: one conceptual and one empirical. First, the\nconceptual: This response would amount to saying that the retinotopic perception of the\nvisible parts of the object gives rise to a nonretinotopic belief (the actual amodal completion),\nwhich then triggers, in a top-down manner, the retinotopic representation of the occluded\nparts of the object. So by representing the occluded part by means of a belief, we lose\nretinotopy, which then somehow gets put back in for the well-demonstrated retinotopic\nactivation of the primary visual cortex. Not a very plausible picture.\nSecond, and perhaps more decisively, there is plenty of empirical evidence that this picture\ncannot be correct given what we know about the timing of amodal completion. Amodal\ncompletion in the early cortices happens within 100 to 200 milliseconds of retinal stimulation\n(Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2001; Sekuler & Palmer, 1992--this is true even of complex visual\nstimuli, like faces, see Chen, Liu, Chen, & Fang 2009, see also Lerner, Harel, & Malach, 2004;\nRauschenberger, Liu, Slotnick, & Yantis, 2006; Yun, Hazenberg, & van Lier, 2018; for\ndetailed studies that track the (very quick) temporal unfolding of amodal completion in\ndifferent parts of the visual cortex). And this is much much shorter than the time that\nwould be needed for perceptual processing to reach all the way up to beliefs or\nnonperceptual representations and then trickle all the way down again to the primary\nvisual cortex (see Lamme & Roelfsema, 2000; Thorpe, Fize, & Marlot, 1996; for the\ntemporal unfolding of visual processing in nonamodal cases). To sum up, account (ii) is\nnot consistent with neuroimaging data about early cortical processing in amodal completion.\nWhat other options do we have? My claim is that amodal completion is a form of mental\nimagery. Depending on one's concept of mental imagery, this claim may come across as\npretty farfetched. So it is important to emphasize that what I mean by mental imagery is\nwhat psychologists and neuroscientists mean by mental imagery (which is often different from\nthe way philosophers think of this concept). Here is a famous characterization of mental\nimagery by Kosslyn, Behrmann, and Jeannerod (1995):\nVisual mental imagery is ``seeing'' in the absence of the appropriate immediate sensory input,\nauditory mental imagery is ``hearing'' in the absence of the immediate sensory input, and so on.\nImagery is distinct from perception, which is the registration of physically present stimuli. (p. 1335)\nAnd here is a more recent definition from a review article on mental imagery: ``We use the\nterm `mental imagery' to refer to representations [ . . . ] of sensory information without a\ndirect external stimulus'' (Pearson, Naselaris, Holmes, & Kosslyn, 2015, p. 590). If we do a\nbit of touching up of these ways of characterizing mental imagery, we get the following\ndefinition: Mental imagery is perceptual processing that is not triggered by corresponding\nPerceptual processing means early cortical processing. In the visual case, this definitely\nincludes processing in V1, V2, V4/V8, MT. The earlier the processing is the more reason we\nhave to consider it to be perceptual processing (and not postperceptual processing). This\nperceptual processing can be triggered by corresponding sensory stimulation. This happens in\nordinary vision. But perceptual processing can also be triggered in a way that is not triggered\nby corresponding sensory stimulation. Perceptual processing of this kind is mental imagery.\nWhether the sensory stimulation and the early cortical processing really correspond could be\neasily determined given the retinotopy of the visual early cortical areas (Grill-Spector &\nBut things are more complicated when it comes to other aspects of perception, for\nexample, color perception. We cannot just read off the correspondence or lack thereof off\nthe relationship between the retina and V4. Colorblind people never have the kind of\ncorrespondence between the retina and V4 that we would expect--yet, they, presumably,\nshould not be described as always entertaining mental imagery.\nIn order to bypass these worries, here is a more neutral way of characterizing\ncorrespondence. A certain sensory stimulation reliably triggers an early perceptual\nprocessing of a certain kind. If this early perceptual processing happens without sensory\nstimulation that would reliably trigger it, this means that there is no correspondence--we\nhave mental imagery. It is important that this reliability is understood restricted to the subject\nin question. In a colorblind person, for example, a certain sensory stimulus would reliably\ntrigger certain early perceptual processing in a way that would not be reliably triggered in\nother, not colorblind subjects.\nNote that I do not use the terms ``perception'' and ``perceptual processing''\ninterchangeably. Perception is perceptual processing triggered by corresponding sensory\nstimulation in the relevant sense modality. But perceptual processing does not have to be\ntriggered by corresponding sensory stimulation in the relevant sense modality--in the case of\nmental imagery, it is not.\nMental imagery in this sense does not have to be voluntary (and indeed many instances of\nmental imagery are not voluntary--think of involuntary flashbacks or earworms). And it\ndoes not have to be conscious either. Just as sensory stimulation-driven perceptual processing\ncan be conscious or unconscious, the same is true of perceptual processing that is not\ntriggered by corresponding sensory stimulation. Note that neither definitions I quoted\nabove talk about consciousness or voluntariness. These are features of some subcases of\nmental imagery (ones philosophers tend to focus on), but not of all.\nAmodal completion counts as mental imagery in this sense. It is early perceptual\nprocessing of a contour (as we have seen, processing already in V1) that is not triggered\nby corresponding sensory stimulation. When you amodally complete the cat behind the\npicket fence, in V1 there is activation of direction-sensitive neurons that would correspond\nto where the cat's outlines would be, but there is nothing on the retina that would correspond\nto these contours. So amodal completion is perceptual processing that is not triggered by\ncorresponding sensory stimulation. It is mental imagery.\nAmodal completion is, of course, in some sense, driven by the retinal image. What\ndetermines how the occluded parts of the cat are represented is the retinal stimulation of\nthe nonoccluded parts. But the representation of the amodally completed features is not\ndriven by the corresponding sensory stimulation (i.e., sensory stimulation that would\ncorrespond to the amodally completed features) for the simple reason that there is no\ncorresponding sensory stimulation (i.e., there is not sensory stimulation that would\ncorrespond to the amodally completed features).\nNot everyone uses the concept of mental imagery the way I outlined (and what I take to be\nthe consensual view in psychology and neuroscience--but not in philosophy). Here is a\npuzzling remark by Vebjorn Ekroll et al. (2016) that may seem to suggest that not\neveryone is on board with the idea that amodal completion is a form of mental imagery:\nOur experience of the hidden backsides of objects is sometimes based on genuine perceptual\nrepresentations rather than mere cognitive guesswork or imagery, despite the lack of any\ndirect sensory stimulation reaching the eye from the hidden backsides themselves. (p. 3)\nThis quote seems to present a choice between perceptual representation on one hand and\ncognitive guesswork and imagery on the other. In my account, imagery is a form of\nperceptual processing, so it is definitely on the perceptual side of this divide and has very\nlittle to do with cognitive guesswork. Ekroll seems to rely on a very odd way of\nunderstanding mental imagery, probably as active imagination. If we understood mental\nimagery this way then amodal completion is clearly not imagery. If we understood mental\nimagery as perceptual processing not triggered by corresponding sensory stimulation in the\nrelevant sense modality, then amodal completion is clearly mental imagery.\nUnderstanding amodal completion as a subspecies of mental imagery can also help us to\nunderstand the function of mental imagery better. Most uses of mental imagery are remarkably\nuseless, so much so that one may wonder how this ability may have evolved. But amodal\ncompletion is very useful indeed: Spotting the lion's tail sticking out of the bush and amodally\ncompleting the rest of the lion is as important for survival as perceiving the lion.\nVarieties of Amodal Completion\nAmodal completion comes in many varieties. First, it may be, but it does not have to be,\nsensitive to top-down influences (Hazenberg et al., 2014, Hazenberg & Van Lier, 2016; Lee &\nfully bottom-up driven, like the completion of shapes purely on the basis of Gestalt forms\n(that can go against our best judgments). But some other times, amodal completion is driven\nin a top-down manner as in the case of seeing the cat behind the picket fence. Depending on\nwhat cats I have encountered before, the way I complete this figure would be very different.\nThe same goes for the amodal completion of letters and words. Higher order knowledge and\nexpectations play an important role here.\nHere is an evocative example, taken from the 1980s classic comedy Top Secret. One of the\nmany visual jokes of the film has the main character crawl in the mud, shown in close up and\nsuddenly he faces two Nazi boots, framed in a way that we can only see the boots. He looks\nscared and the camera zooms out, revealing that it is only two boots standing in the mud,\nthere is no Nazi officer in them. Again, we use amodal completion to represent what is\noutside the frame (a theme I will come back in the last section), and we use a lot of high-\nlevel information to complete what is outside the frame, for example, knowledge that Nazi\nboots usually continue upwards in Nazi officiers.3\nSecond, amodal completion may be conscious or unconscious. Given the sheer amount of\namodal completion the visual system needs to do at any given moment, amodal completion is\nnormally unconscious. When I see 50 cats behind the picket fence, I do not form conscious\nmental imagery of all occluded parts of all the fifty cats. But amodal completion can be\nconscious if, for example, we are really interested in some of the occluded features. If for\nsome reason I need to attend to the left eye of one of these 50 cats and it is occluded by the\nfence, I am likely to represent this left eye consciously.\nThis takes us to a third, related, but different distinction: Amodal completion can be\nattended or unattended. I can shift my attention from one perceived objects to another\nand I can do the same when it comes to amodally completed parts of perceived objects.\nWe can attend to some properties of amodally represented parts of perceived objects, but\nnormally we ignore most of these properties (see also De Weerd, Smith, & Greenberg, 2006\nfor empirical support of this).\nFurther, most of the time you attribute very determinable properties to amodally\nrepresented parts of perceived objects (this point is not independent from the previous\none: see Yeshurun & Carrasco 1998; Nanay, 2010b on the relation between attention and\nthe attribution of determinate properties). But if you are really interested in them for some\nreason, you can attribute very determinate properties (determined at least partly in a top-\ndown manner). If I see you with your hands in your pocket, I am unlikely to have a\ndeterminate representation of how you move your fingers in your pocket. But if I attend\nto this very thing, I may attribute more determinate properties to the whereabouts of each of\nyour fingers (which would be determined [at least partly] in a top-down manner).\nAmodal Completion and Perceptual Justification\nThe picture we ended up with is one where what we take to be perception is really a mixture\nof two things: sensory stimulation-driven perception and amodal completion. And as amodal\ncompletion is a form of mental imagery, this means that everyday perception is a mixture\nbetween sensory stimulation-driven perception and mental imagery.\nThis conclusion is a version of the old and influential idea that imagination is ``a necessary\ningredient of perception itself'' (Strawson, 1974, p. 54--the metaphor and the quote are\noriginally from Kant (Critique of Pure Reason, A120, fn. a, see also Sellars, 1978), but it\nhas become a widespread slogan. Euge\n` ne Delacroix, for example, wrote: ``Even when we look\nat nature, our imagination constructs the picture.''4 Mental imagery is different from\nimagination and I am not sure that imagination is in fact a necessary ingredient of\nperception, but as long as amodal completion counts as mental imagery, we can conclude\nthat mental imagery is a necessary ingredient of perception itself.\nIn some very rare examples of simple two-dimensional visual displays, there is no amodal\ncompletion (there may still be some other forms of mental imagery, e.g., multimodal mental\nimagery, involved; see Nanay, 2018). In these cases, there is only sensory stimulation-driven\nperception. But these cases are extremely rare in everyday perception. In the vast majority of\neveryday perceptual scenarios, amodal completion is present and it gets combined with the\nsensory stimulus-driven perceptual processing.\nThis has serious consequences for epistemology (see also Chudnoff, 2018a, 2018b). Again,\nin the vast majority of everyday perceptual scenarios, what we take ourselves to perceive we\nat least partly represent by means of amodal completion. But as at least some of these\nepisodes of amodal completion are subject to top-down influences, perception per se can\nalso be subject to top-down influences. This argument for top-down influences on perceptual\nprocessing is different from the standard philosophical ones (Macpherson, 2012; Siegel, 2011;\nStokes, 2012) and it is not susceptible to some of the criticism they face (see, e.g., Firestone &\nIf perception is sensitive to top-down influences because of the top-down sensitivity of\namodal completion, then it is not an unbiased way of learning about the world, as our\npreexisting thoughts, beliefs and expectations could influence how and what we perceive\n(see Siegel, 2011 on a version of this worry). So we get a form of vicious circularity:\nOur beliefs, thoughts and expectations are supposed to be based on and justified by our\nperceptual states, but these perceptual states themselves are influenced by our beliefs,\nthoughts and expectations (because of the top-down influences on perception via amodal\ncompletion).\nBut I want to argue that the role amodal completion plays in everyday perception poses an\neven more significant worry for epistemology, regardless of whether it is influenced in a top-\ndown manner.\nKnowledge is supposed to be a good thing because it tracks truth. And perception is\nsupposed to be a good way of acquiring knowledge because perception tracks truth.\nSensory stimulation-driven perception does indeed track what it is of. Light from the\nperceived object hits our retina and that is the sensory stimulation that gets processed. But\namodal completion is by definition not sensory stimulation driven. So it is cut off from the\nobject it is about. One link in the causal chain is missing.\nWhen we see a cat behind a picket fence, what is supposed to do epistemic work is not the\nperception of the unoccluded slices of the cat but rather the perception of the entire cat. But\nthe perception of the entire cat is the result of both stimulus-driven perception (of the\nunoccluded slices of the cat) and mental imagery (of everything else). So whatever is\nsupposed to do the epistemic heavy-lifting is partly constituted by mental\nimagery--something not particularly well-suited at all for any epistemic role as it fails to\ntrack the way the world is. If it is true that the vast majority of perceptual states are mixed\nperception/mental imagery cases, then almost all instances of perception are mixtures of\na state that is supposed to track the truth (perception) and a state that, on the face of it, is not\n(mental imagery).\nI said that amodal completion is, by definition, a step removed from the truth it is\nsupposed to track. Of course it can track truth albeit in a fallible manner. It can be\nfooled, but in the vast majority of cases it is not. Nonetheless, whether perception can\njustify beliefs depends on empirical facts about the reliability of the mechanisms of amodal\ncompletion involved in perception.\nWe can make the default assumption that our perceptual system built pretty good\nmechanisms for amodal completion on the basis of local and global contextual\ninformation that does co-vary with the scene in front of us. But this is enough to resist\ndogmatism about perceptual justification.\nDogmatism is the philosophical view that ``whenever you have an experience as of p, you\nthereby have immediate prima facie justification for believing p'' (Pryor, 2000, p. 536).\nSimilarly, ``when it seems as if P and there is no evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable\nto believe P'' (Huemer, 2001, p. 103--Huemer calls the view ``conservativism''). The second\nquote continues with the assertion that this ``is a necessary truth, not a contingent one''\n(Huemer, 2001). Although according to dogmatism, it is true in all possible worlds that\n``when it seems as if P and there is no evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to believe\nP,'' if my argument is correct, then it is false even in the actual world. It should also be noted\nthat dogmatism is especially problematic in the light of recent findings that we treat amodally\ncompleted features as more reliable then features that are not amodally completed (Ehinger,\nA lot more work needs to be done in order to show that we are justified to move from\n(amodal completion-tinted) perception to belief. Again, this is not to say that we cannot\neventually do so, we surely can. But any such move is very far away from a ``prima facie'' or\n``immediate'' justification the dogmatists want.5 It would need to involve a close empirical\nexamination of the reliability of the processes that give rise to amodal completion.\nThe conclusion is that the question of perceptual justification is at least in part an\nempirical question--it requires the examination of the reliability of the kinds of amodal\ncompletion that play a constitutive part of perception per se.\nAmodal Completion in the Visual Arts\nIn closing, I want to examine a less obvious role amodal completion plays in our life and it is\nour engagement with visual artworks.\nOne (somewhat obvious) way in which amodal completion plays a role in our engagement\nwith visual arts follows from the simple fact that most pictorial art does not encompass the\nentire visual field. So those parts of the depicted scene that fall outside the frame could be,\nand very often are, represented by means of amodal completion.\nSome artists very explicitly try to evoke our amodal completion of aesthetically relevant\nproperties outside the frame. One famous example would be Degas, who likes to place the\nprotagonists of her paintings in a way that only parts of them are inside the frame. The rest\nwe need to complete by means of amodal completion. In some extreme cases (e.g., Dancers\nclimbing the stairs, 1886\u00ad1890, Musee D'Orsay), we only see someone's arm or the top of\ntheir head and we need to complete those parts of her body that are outside the frame\namodally.\nJean-Luc Godard uses this way of composing images in an even more radical manner--in\nthe films he made in the mid-1960s, many of the compositions are almost completely empty,\nwith the face of the protagonist at the edge of the screen. Buster Keaton also uses the\noff-screen space but normally for comical effects. One example is the first shot of his short\nfilm Cops (1922), where we see the protagonist in close up behind bars and looking\ndepressed--prompting the viewer to amodally complete the space outside the frame as a\nprison cell. But the second shot reveals that he is behind an iron garden gate taking to a\ngirl who does not love him back. But off-screen space plays an aesthetically relevant role\nin many other films--for example, films by Jean Renoir, Ozu, Antonioni, and Bresson\nAmodal completion can play an important role within the frame as well. One classic\nexample is Bunuel's Belle de Jour, where the Chinese businessman shows a little box to the\nCathrine Denevue character, who is clearly fascinated by what is inside. She sees it, he sees it,\nbut we, the viewers do not. There is a humming voice coming from the box, but we never see\nwhat is inside. We have a very indeterminate amodal completion of what could possibly be in\nthe box. And it is aesthetically relevant that the property that we thereby represent by means\nof amodal completion is indeterminate. It is not that we are not smart enough to find out\nwhat it is--whatever is in the box is left intentionally indeterminate.\nRobert Bresson often uses amodal completion this indeterminate way, so much so that he\neven takes this use of amodal completion to be the mark of a ``good'' director (or, as he\nwould put it, of a cinematographer, not merely of a director): ``Don't show all sides of the\nOne relatively simple use of amodal completion inside the frame comes from the\nabundance of occlusion in most everyday perceptual scenes (and, as a result, in most\ndepicted scenes). Hiding aesthetically relevant properties in occluded parts of depicted\nobjects has a long history, Rogier Van der Weyden plays with this in his Seven Sacraments\n(Antwerp), where he depicts one of the characters in a way that only the tip of his nose and\nchin are visible. Antonioni's L'Eclisse (1962) uses occlusion in a way that is clearly\naesthetically relevant--for example, when we first see the two protagonists in the same\nframe both half occluded by the same giant column. And Godard's Vivre sa Vie (1962)\nstarts with a long (7 minute) scene where the two main protagonists are filmed from\nbehind--we hear their conversation, but we do not see their face. We need to use amodal\ncompletion to represent very important aesthetically relevant properties.\nSome less high-brow examples: Monty Python's How not to be seen sketch relies entirely\non the comic effects of amodal completion we use to represent occluded people. Also, in the\nsitcom Seinfeld, one of the recurring characters, Mr. Steinbrenner is only ever shown\noccluded. We sometimes see his head from behind, but his face is occluded. When we first\nsee him, we only see his hand when he shakes hand with George, but the rest of his body is\noccluded behind a wall. And we sometimes see the shadow of his profile, but the only way we\ncan represent his face is by means of amodal completion.\nIn the Seinfeld example (and in the Godard example as well), the use of occlusion is really\na game or a running (visual) gag. But it can also be used in a more disconcerting manner,\nwhere the occluded parts of the scene are represented as something that is potentially\ndangerous or uncertain. Marguarite Duras's India Song (1975) is a clear example, where\nthe vast majority of the shots hide a large occluded space, typically another room, in the\nbackground, where something potentially important could be happening, but we never see\nwhat that is. Rene Margritte's paintings and Andres Serrano's photographs almost always\nhide some aesthetically relevant features behind an occluder in a way that we can only form\nvery indeterminate mental imagery of what is occluded. And Apichatpong Weerasethakul's\nfilms use this effect as the general emotional background that creates a sense of anxiety\nbecause we have no idea what is hidden behind, say, the jungle foliage in Tropical malady\nAgain, this, unlike the Seinfeld example, saddles us with deliberately indeterminate amodal\ncompletion. There is, presumably, a fact of the matter about how Mr. Steinbrenner looks\n(and the same goes for how Nana looks in Godard's Vivre sa Vie). But there is no fact of the\nmatter about what is in the box in Belle de Jour or in the next room in India Song or in the\njungle in Apichatpong Weerasethakul's films. And this is what makes these aesthetically\nrelevant properties that are represented by means of indeterminate mental imagery\ndisconcerting. As Proust says, ``It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of\nthings in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine'' (Proust, 1913/\n"
