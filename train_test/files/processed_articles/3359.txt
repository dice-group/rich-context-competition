As a chronic condition,\nESRD has an extended time period during\nwhich patients must learn to cope with life\nchanges; this makes health education and\nself-management behaviours key factors in\nassessing the effectiveness of therapeutic\ninterventions.7 Thus, achieving adequate\nhaemodialysis, \u00ad and providing subjective\nand initiative activities for patients that\nenhance their self-management abilities \u00ad\nare key to reducing the occurrence of\ncomplications, and for maintaining a satis-\nfactory health-related quality-of-life in those\nundergoing MHD.7\nThe present study hypothesized that\napplication of the knowledge-attitude-beha-\nviour model would positively affect health\nbeliefs, facilitate changes in bad habits,\nenhance healthy behavior, and improve\nself-management behaviour and outcome\nin patients on MHD.7\nTo date, no studies have investigated the\nrelationship between knowledge, attitude\nand behaviour changes for MHD patients.\nTherefore, the objectives of the present\nstudy were to explore the effects of\na knowledge-attitude-behaviour health\neducation model on the acquisition of\ndisease-related knowledge, then to assess\nsubsequent self-management behaviour in\nMHD patients.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients prescribed MHD between October\nHospital of Harbin Medical University were\nrandomly selected for this study.1 These\npatients fulfilled the criteria for chronic\nkidney disease classification standard stage\n5 (renal failure) established by the United\nStates Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney\nDisease and Dialysis in Clinical Practice\nGuidelines Expert Group.8 In addition,\npatients met the following study inclusion\ncriteria: indicated for MHD; !18 years of\nage; MHD duration >3 months; MHD\nregularly scheduled (two or three times\nweekly); stable clinical condition; patient\ncould read and understand the question-\nnaire supplied.\nStable MHD patients were defined as\nthose with sufficient solute clearance by\nhaemodialysis, a low water load (<3%),\ngood control of blood glucose and blood\ndiac events and no recent infections.\nExclusion criteria included severe cognitive\ndysfunction, patients who could not take\ncare of themselves after renal transplant-\nation and patients with serious cardiovascu-\nlar and cerebrovascular disease.\nRandomization\nPatients were randomly divided into one of\ntwo main study groups, using computer-\ngenerated random numbers that were\nassigned according to enrollment order.\nPatients receiving odd numbers were\nassigned to the control group; patients\nreceiving even numbers were assigned to\nthe intervention group. A nurse (J.W.) with\nextensive clinical skills, professional know-\nledge and experience in mental health nur-\nsing was used to record patient data.\nControl group\nRoutine health education information cover-\ning diet, medication, exercise, monitoring,\nprevention and treatment of complications,\nas well as other measures, was given to each\nparticipant in this group. Blood pressure,\nbody weight, urine output, ultrafiltration,\nfluid intake amount and any complications\nwere recorded for each patient. Standard oral\neducation and health education materials were\nused. Patient follow-up was by oral commu-\nnication, scheduled once every 2 weeks.\nIntervention group\nThe knowledge-attitude-behaviour health\neducation model was applied to the inter-\nvention group. Initially, a questionnaire9\u00ad11\nwas completed by each patient.\nFollowing completion of the question-\nnaire, patients received definitive informa-\ntion and education, including written\nmaterials, lectures and time to talk with the\nnursing staff (discussed below). This disease-\nrelated information included the purpose of\nhaemodialysis, principles of haemodialysis,\nimportant aspects of haemodialysis, protec-\ntion of internal fistulae, prevention of com-\nplications and emergency treatment.\nAccording to the three stages of Kelman's\nchange of attitude theory,12 discussions were\nconducted every 2 weeks.\nPatients in the intervention group were\nsubdivided into five groups, each of approxi-\nmately the same size, to enhance changes in\ntheir marginal beliefs and to achieve more\nfocused and consistent health beliefs.\nData analyses\nThe following analyses were undertaken\nonly in the intervention group.\nSynchronized analysis and data sorting\nwere conducted according to each patient's\nlevel of education, and health education\nunderstanding. The three nursing models\nof knowledge-attitude-behaviour were then\nused to conduct disease-related knowledge\neducation, training of health beliefs and\nsupportive health behaviour.13\nSurvey results were analysed by a spe-\ncialist (L.L.) to understand the physical and\nmental aspects of each patient and the\npatient's family social status, so that areas\nfor improvement and the support structure\ninvolved could be identified.\nCommunication with patients and\ntheir families\nEffective communication with patients in the\nintervention group and their family mem-\nbers included in-depth interviews (telephone\nand face-to-face interviews), to develop a\ntrusting relationship. This relationship was\nintended to provide patients and their family\nmembers with support for problems.\nTelephone hotlines (manned by healthcare\nprofessionals) were also opened, to encour-\nage interactive education between patients.\nActive management of health behaviours\nA stage-by-stage system (Figure 1) was used\nto train patients in the intervention group to\nactively manage their own disease and adopt\ncorrect health behaviours. Educational\nmaterials on dialysis were distributed to\npatients. In addition, lectures on MHD\nwere held, and patients received individua-\nlized information and support if necessary.\nAn advisory panel of experienced phys-\nicians and experts in haemodialysis was\nestablished to conduct self-management\ntraining and facilitate discussions among\nparticipants. The following topics were\naddressed, using health education methods\nsuitable for the cultural and learning cap-\nacity of the patients involved.\nDisease-related knowledge education. The\nobjective and principle were presented and\nissues that need attention, such as protection\nof internal fistulae and prevention and\nemergency treatment of common complica-\ntions were conveyed.\nDietary knowledge. This included discussion\non the need to limit salt intake to <3 g of salt\nper day, to reduce thirst. Foods and flavour-\nings that were high in salt were specified,\nincluding pickled products, chicken powder\nand monosodium glutamate. The need to\nrestrict the volume of water and sodium\ningested was covered, as was the need to\ncontrol weight gain. Adhering to a strict diet\nand liquid intake regimen represents a key\nchallenge for haemodialysis patients.14\nPsychological and social behaviours. These\nbehaviours were supported by patients\nbeing advised to talk frequently with coun-\nsellors, to eliminate or reduce negative\nmoods. In addition, patients were encour-\naged to seek the psychological support that\nwas available, in order for them to establish\nand sustain the confidence needed to\nmanage their chronic disease.\nSelf inspection index. Patients and their\nfamilies were encouraged to purchase hae-\nmatomanometers and were then taught to\nobtain correct blood pressure measure-\nments. Family members were also advised\nto maintain daily health diaries for the\npatient. These diaries included the following\nparameters: body weight; heart rate; blood\nFigure 1. Flow diagram showing knowledge-attitude-behaviour interventions.\npressure; respiratory pattern; urinary\nvolume; retention levels of sodium and\nwater. Family members also learned to\nobserve the patient for signs of oedema,\nwith obvious short-term weight gain indicat-\ning excessive water load. In addition to\nmeasurements of body weight, oedema in\nthe leg, foot, hand, upper limb and lumbo-\nsacral portion were to be noted.\nPhysical activity and behaviour\nintervention. These were encouraged.\nModerate-intensity aerobic exercise was\nconducted regularly, using step-by-step and\nperseverance principles. Types of exercise\nadvocated included Qigong, Taijiquan, jog-\nging, cycling, swimming and/or walking\nthree to five times each week, with each\nArteriovenous fistula care. It was important to\nensure that this vascular access was used\nproperly and maintained carefully to extend\nits use as long as possible. Patients and their\nfamilies were shown proper fistula nursing\nmethods, including preparing the arm before\ndialysis, not using the fistula side limb to lift\nheavy items, nor for drawing blood, blood\npressure measurement, injections or infusions.\nPatients were taught to self detect the anasto-\nmotic murmur of the fistula and the associated\n`trill' sound each day. Fistula smoothness was\nalso recorded using touch or a stethoscope.\nIf the vascular trill disappeared and a throb\nwas not found at the anastomosis site, patients\nwere advised that their internal fistula was\nblocked and were told to attend the hospital\nfor diagnosis and treatment.\nMedication use. Patients received close\ninstruction in how to take their prescribed\nmedications at the times indicated. Drugs\nassociated with renal injury, such as genta-\nmicin and certain Chinese traditional medi-\ncines, were prohibited. Drug effects and\nadverse reactions were monitored; routine\nblood tests and blood biochemistry were\nassayed regularly using standard methods.\nTest results were monitored to assure an\nadequate level of dialysis.\nPatient follow-up was conducted once\nevery 2 weeks to assess intervention effects\n(using structured questionnaires).9\u00ad11\nMedical behaviours that were not in com-\npliance with the directions of each patient's\ndoctor were analysed and intervention\nschemes were adjusted accordingly.\nEvaluation of intervention methods\nIntervention methods were evaluated in\nboth study groups initially by assessing the\npatient's grasp of disease knowledge using a\nquestionnaire9 that included seven aspects\nand 20 items. This questionnaire was scored\nusing a range between 0 and 3 points\n(0, absence of understanding; 1 partial\nunderstanding; 2 having a majority of cor-\nrect answers; 3 complete understanding).\nSelf-management behaviour was evaluated\nwith parameters of chronic disease self\nment, psychological and social behaviours,\noral drug compliance, disease condition\nmonitoring, physical activity, arteriovenous\nfistula care and body quality control.15\nTwenty items that addressed these aspects\nwere evaluated and analysed.\nThe results obtained had good reliability,\nCronbach's a coefficient was 0.89 and the\nretest reliability value was 0.83. Results were\nranked using Likert class 4 scoring (1, never\ndone; 2, occasionally done; 3, basically\ndone; 4, completely done).\nSince there were different numbers of\nitems for each aspect of the self-management\nmodels, data were transformed into 10 fen\nmodels of scoring so that each aspect was\ncomparable with others. An overall self-\nmanagement behaviour score was obtained\nby averaging the scores of all the different\naspects. The higher the score, the better the\nself-management behaviour exhibited by the\npatient.\nQuestionnaires were completed by\nparticipants in the intervention group\nprior to intervention and at 6 months\npostintervention.\nEthical considerations\nApproval for this study was obtained from\nthe institutional review committee of Harbin\nMedical University, Harbin, China. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from\nall patients according to the Declaration of\nHelsinki, prior to their assignation to a\ngroup.\nSample size\nSince no similar studies have investigated\nthe relationship between knowledge-atti-\ntude-behaviour changes in MHD patients,\nthe sample size was roughly estimated based\non the following parameters prior to the\nThe value of n for the present study was 30.\nA 20% rate of incomplete or invalid data\nwas also considered, based on previous\nexperience. Therefore, a sample size of\nn > 36 per group was considered appropriate\nto achieve the study objectives.\nStatistical analyses\nData were reported as mean\u00c6 SD. Statistical\nsignificance between the means was deter-\nmined and analysed using one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA), V2-test, Student's t-test\nor paired t-test as appropriate, using SPSS\u00d5\nversion 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\nA P-value< 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant, and a P-value< 0.01 was con-\nsidered highly significant.\nResults\nIn total, 91 patients were prescribed MHD\nSecond Affiliated Hospital of Harbin\nMedical University. Eighty six of these\npatients were eligible for participation in\nthis study in this study (n \u00bc 43 per group).\nFigure 2 provides an overview of the study\nconduct.\nDisease-related knowledge pre- and\npostintervention\nThere were no statistical differences between\npatients' ages, sex, degree of education,\nbody weight, duration of dialysis or cause\nof dialysis for those in the control group\nversus those in the intervention group\n(Table 1). In addition, there was no obvious\ndifference in the extent of disease-related\nknowledge for each group prior to interven-\ntion. However, at 6 months postinterven-\ntion, disease-related knowledge scores were\nsignificantly higher for patients in the inter-\nvention group, compared with their baseline\nlevels, and also compared with scores\nobserved in the control group (P < 0.05 in\neach case; Table 2).\nSelf-management behaviours pre- and\npostintervention\nSelf-management behaviour scores for the\ncontrol and intervention groups did not\nshow a significant difference prior to\nintervention (P > 0.05). However, self-\nmanagement behaviour scores for both\ngroups were significantly higher after, com-\npared with before, intervention (P < 0.05).\nFurthermore, postintervention scoring for\nthe intervention group was higher than that\nfor the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nPeople requiring MHD face psychological\nand physical pressures that impact substan-\ntially on health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL). In addition, once patients begin\nMHD, they rely on such treatment for their\nsurvival.\nThe objective of the self-management\nmodel applied in this study was to provide\nMHD patients with the ability to cope with,\nand hopefully resolve, common problems\nassociated with control of ESRD symptoms,\ncompliance with a treatment programme\nand somatic discomfort. Health education\nis an important external factor that\ninfluences self-management behaviour,15\nalthough a further study16 found that self-\nmanagement education that simply pro-\nvided information only produced a slight\nimprovement in self-management behaviour\nin patients. The present study showed that,\ndespite receiving health education, behav-\niours associated with poor self management\ncontinued to be observed in patients.\nA strong motivation to maintain good\nhealth was key to patients realizing the\nbenefits and necessity of treatment, thereby\nimproving overall self-management.\nThe knowledge-attitude-behaviour\nmodel considers that knowledge is essential\nfor effecting changes in behaviour, and that\nindividuals can obtain knowledge and skills\nthrough learning. Accordingly, patients and\ntheir families need to actively receive know-\nledge, which can lead to a gradual develop-\nment of healthy beliefs and attitudes that are\nreinforced with the adoption of healthy\nbehaviours. Ren, et al.13 and Zhao, et al.17\ndemonstrated that application of the knowl-\nedge-attitude-behaviour model effectively\nestablished a healthy belief in patients and\nFigure 2. Flow diagram showing randomization and outcomes of maintenance haemodialysis patients\nreceiving either standard health education or knowledge-attitude-behaviour intervention.\nled to the conversion of bad living habits to\nhealthy behaviours. In the present study,\nknowledge was provided to the intervention\ngroup at health lectures and through the\ndistribution of educational materials. The\naccessibility of this knowledge was intended\nto improve the recognition of health-related\nbehaviours. Both the examiner and the\npatient analysed the patient's condition\nand self-evaluation in order to establish\nhealthcare and rehabilitation objectives.\nBad habits associated with self care were\nhighlighted so that they could be eliminated;\npatients were encouraged to adopt a regular\nmedication regimen that effectively con-\ntrolled ESRD progression and promoted\nan improvement in self-management behav-\niour. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency of the\npatients we studied was found to be\nenhanced when patient cases were analysed\nand discussed, and when mutual help groups\nwere established. Ideally, the goal for each\npatient should be to maximize their self-\nconfidence, thereby encouraging them to\nparticipate in decisions regarding their\nhealth and self-management.\nThere was no significant difference in the\nextent of disease-related knowledge between\nthe intervention group and the control\ngroup prior to intervention, indicating that\npatients in these groups were comparable.\nPatients could acquire disease-related know-\nledge from each intervention programme;\nhowever, a greater level of disease-related\nknowledge was obtained by the intervention\ngroup than the control group (P < 0.05).\nThese results suggest that patients can\nacquire effective self-management know-\nledge and skills following systematic guid-\nance and training according to education\nlevels. Moreover, a higher level of disease\neducation can be gained by both patients\nand their families with effective application\nof a knowledge-attitude-behaviour initia-\ntive. Family members were encouraged to\nparticipate in study activities including\nattending informative lectures on haemodi-\nalysis, answering relative knowledge inqui-\nries, studying dialysis educational materials\nand discussing effective communication with\npatients. In the present study, this led to a\ncorrection of lifestyle habits, enhanced\nTable 1.

In this way,\nbehaviour changes are enhanced, which is\nkey to attaining and sustaining management\nobjectives for patients.18\nPatients on MHD experience the pres-\nsures of the disease and its treatment, but\nalso may exhibit psychosocial traits, and\nhave poor compliance with recommended\ndiets, liquid intake restrictions and medica-\ntion regimens.19 Unfortunately, when self-\nmanagement behaviour compliance is com-\npromised, there are severe consequences,\nincluding a decrease in HRQoL and an\nincreased potential for MHD to become\nless effective. Patients who monitor their\nphysical state using effective self-manage-\nment methods and skills can eventually\nattain a satisfactory HRQoL.16\nWhile receiving MHD, patients need to\nmaintain adequate self-management behav-\niours.20 Self-management behaviour was\npreviously defined as the acquisition of\nMHD knowledge, such that health object-\nives are actively achieved and HRQoL\nimproves.21 Health knowledge is available\nfrom lectures, consultants, individualized\nTable 2.

In comparison, traditional health\neducation includes a process of disease\nrecognition and requires subsequent\nchanges in behaviour to improve clinical\noutcome.22 Patients' perception of their\nhealth, self-management attitude and ways\nof coping with disease are important factors\nthat affect patient compliance and self-\nmanagement behaviour. Therefore, it is\nhypothesized that effective health education\nwill increase compliance, thereby controlling\ndisease recurrence and HRQoL.\nKnowledge-attitude-behaviour theory is\nan extension of cognitive theory applica-\ntion in health education. Knowledge-\nattitude-behaviour theory proposes that\nhealth knowledge and information are the\nfoundation for establishing active and cor-\nrect beliefs and attitudes towards disease;\nsuch attitudes are the driving forces for\nmodifying patient behaviour.18 Research\nhas demonstrated that important correl-\nations exist between the occurrence, devel-\nopment and prognosis of diseases.22\nPsychological, dietary, exercise and lifestyle\ninterventions can positively or negatively\ncontribute to disease recurrence.\nImprovements in health knowledge and the\ndevelopment of good health skills are\nimportant for enhancing patient health.23\nSelf management needs to emphasize the\npatient's recognition of their own prob-\nlems.24 Ideally, both the health care\nTable 3.

With\nthis recognition, relevant issues can be\naddressed using self-management skills.\nOverall, the objective of the self-manage-\nment model is not to cure diseases, but\nrather to ensure that the patient's state of\nhealth and function are satisfactorily\nmaintained so that they can achieve an\nindependent and healthy lifestyle. When\nself-management models have been applied\nto the prevention and control of chronic\ndiseases, significant and positive effects on\nthe patient's HRQoL, disease management\nand treatment compliance have been\nobserved.25 In combination, these measures\nresulted in improvements in patient\nIn the present study, self-management\nbehaviour scores for the intervention group\nwere significantly higher than those rec-\norded prior to intervention and than those\nof the control group (Table 3). These data\nindicate that self-management knowledge\nwas instilled into patients, and that behav-\niour guidance was achieved following an\nunderstanding of the dynamic changes that\noccur with application of the knowledge-\nattitude-behaviour model of nursing inter-\nvention. Moreover, this approach increased\npatients' health awareness, and led to cor-\nrections in unhealthy lifestyles and behav-\niours. These patients also followed their\ndoctor's advice better, sustained a reason-\nable diet and strictly controlled both water\nand salt intake, compared with those in the\ncontrol group. Such changes led to a\ndecrease in the complications reported, an\nimprovement in self-management behav-\niour, and a reduction in the obstacles\nto self-management encountered by the\npatient. Thus, disease control and allevi-\nation of disease was achieved. Furthermore,\nthese positive effects support the wide-\nspread application of the knowledge-\nattitude-behaviour model.\nTo conclude, application of the knowl-\nedge-attitude-behaviour model in health\neducation has the potential to facilitate\nchanges in bad habits, to enhance healthy\nbehaviour and to improve self-management\nbehaviour in patients undergoing MHD.\nOur preliminary findings need to be con-\nfirmed in larger studies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency either public or commercial.\nNote\n1.
