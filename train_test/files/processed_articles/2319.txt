There is a need to un-\nderstand better the sociodemographic\ntrends in psychotropic use among very\nyoung children. For example, 2 studies\nhave noted higher rates of psychotropic\nschoolers enrolled in Medicaid com-\npared with non-Medicaid groups,\nsociodemographic predictors may in-\nclude gender and race/ethnicity. Pre-\nvious studies in the late 1990s and early\ntropic prescription rates in preschool\nboys compared with girls,4,12 and in very\nyoung white compared with black chil-\ndren,4,17 but these samples were de-\nmographic groupspecific (Medicaid-only\nor region-specific HMO populations). The\nextent of differences in psychotropic\nprescription based on health insurance\ntype, gender, and race have not been\ndetermined in updated, more socio-\ndemographically diverse samples of very\nyoung children.\nThe current study examined trends in\nand sociodemographic predictors of\npsychotropic medication use among 2-\nto 5-year-old children in a US nationally\nrepresentativesampleofvisitstooffice-\nbased practices and hospital-based\noutpatient clinics over a 16-year pe-\ntrends in mental health diagnoses to\ndetermine which diagnoses were as-\nsociated with the highest medication\nrates, and the relationship between\nchanging rates of behavioral diagnoses\nand the likelihood of psychotropic\nmedication receipt over time.\nMETHODS\nData Source and Design\nWe used data from the National Am-\nbulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)\nand the National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS), which\ncollectdataonpatientvisitstocommunity,\nnon\u00adfederally funded, office-based physi-\ncian practices and hospital-based out-\npatient clinics throughout the United\nStates.18 We did not include hospital-\nbased emergency department data to\nmaintain a focus on medication pre-\nscriptionsatnonemergentvisits.Thus,we\nanalyzeddatafromoffice-basedphysician\npractice and hospital-based outpatient\nThesurveysuseamultistateprobability\ndesign as described previously.19 The\nNAMCS has a 3-stage sampling design,\nwith sampling based on geographic lo-\ncation, physician practices within a geo-\ngraphic location (stratified by physician\nspecialty), and visits within individual\nphysician practices. The NHAMCS has a\n4-stage sampling design, with sampling\nbased on geographic area, hospitals\nwithin a geographic area, clinics within\nhospitals, and patient visits within clin-\nics. Each visit is weighted to allow cal-\nculation of national estimates by using\nselection probability, adjustment for\nnonresponse, ratio adjustment to fixed\ntotals, and weight smoothing.\nVisit-Level Data\nFor each visit, participating physicians\nor their staff members provided pa-\ntient sociodemographic and clinical\ninformation, including visit diagnoses\nVisit Diagnoses\nVisit diagnoses were recorded on the\nbasis of International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifi-\ncation, codes. Up to 3 diagnoses were\nrecorded for each visit. Mental health\ndiagnoses were grouped into 8 catego-\nries: (1) attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD)/hyperkinesis, (2) dis-\nruptive behavior disorders, (3) perva-\nsive developmental disorders, (4) sleep\nproblems,(5)anxietydisorders,(6)mood\ndisorders, (7) adjustment disorders, and\n(8) psychosis (see Appendix 1).\nMedications\nMedications prescribed, supplied, ad-\nministered,orcontinuedatthevisitwere\ndocumented. Up to 5 medications were\nmedications per visit were recorded in\nmum number of recorded medications\nper visit was increased to 8.

Ap-\npendix 2 lists medications within each\nclass. We did not count antihistamines\n(eg, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine)\nas psychotropic medications because\nthey are used for a variety of non-\npsychotropicpurposes.Benzodiazepines,\nbarbiturates, and mood stabilizers with\nindications for seizure treatment were\ncounted as psychotropic medications\nonly if the patient did not have a seizure\ndiagnosis. Antiadrenergic agents were\ncounted as psychotropic medications\nonly if the patient did not have a hyper-\ntension diagnosis.\nPrimary Sources of Visit Payment\nVisit payment primary source was des-\nignated in NAMCS/NHAMCS as private\nhealth insurance, Medicaid/SCHIP (State\nChildren's Health Insurance Program),\nself-pay, no charge/charity, or \"other.\"\nBecause of low numbers of children re-\nceiving psychotropic medications in the\nself-pay, no charge/charity, or \"other\"\ngroups (n = 70 for entire study period),\nthese groups were combined with the\nMedicaid/SCHIP group into a single\n\"other type\" category for analysis.\nRace\nChild race was designated in NAMCS/\nNHAMCS as white, black/African Ameri-\ncan,Asian,nativeHawaiianorAlaskan,or\n\"more than one race reported.\" Because\nof low numbers of children receiving\npsychotropic medications in the Asian,\nnative Hawaiian or Alaskan, and \"more\nthan one race reported\" groups (n = 38\nfor the entire study period), these\ngroups were combined with black/\nAfrican American patients into a single\n\"nonwhite\" category for analysis.\nData Analysis\nTo account for the complex survey de-\nsign, sample weights and design varia-\nbles were applied according to NAMCS/\nNHAMCS guidelines for all analyses.21\u00ad25\nAnalyses were performed by using SAS\nstatistical software, version 9.3 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC).\nDescriptive statistics on the rate of visits\nwith at least 1 recorded psychotropic\nmedication were calculated for the\nsample overall by year.

This\nfinding is consistent with previous\nstudies documenting higher rates of\npsychotropicuseinoldercomparedwith\nyounger,4,12 male compared with fe-\nrican American preschool children.4,17\nOur finding that children lacking private\ninsurance were more likely than those\nwith private insurance to take psycho-\ntropic medications confirmed results of\na US nationally representative 1996 sur-\nvey of 0 to 18 year olds,7 but contrasted\nsample.17 Additional study is needed to\ndetermine why certain groups of very\nyoung children are more likely to receive\npsychotropic medications and to de-\ntermine the appropriateness of these\nprescriptions. Possible reasons for\nsociodemographicdisparitiesinusemay\ninclude factors such as certain groups\nhaving higher rates of behavioral dis-\norders (due to increased exposure39,40 or\nsusceptibility41 to mental health risk\nfactors), a bias toward higher rates of\ndisorder identification,42 more favor-\nable attitudes toward psychotropic\nmedication use,43 or diminished ac-\ncess to or acceptability of behavioral\nOur study has several limitations. The\nrelatively small number of 2- to 5-year-\nold children receiving psychotropic\nmedications makes it difficult to provide\nreliable yearly usage estimates and\nprohibitsthereliableestimationofrates\nforeach medication class separately for\nthe 4-year time intervals, with the ex-\nception of the psychostimulants. Spe-\ncifically, changes in antidepressant,\natypical antipsychotic, antiadrenergic,\nandmood stabilizer usage over timeare\nof substantial interest, but we cannot\nmake definitive comments on them. Due\nto the low numbers of preschool chil-\ndren using .1 psychotropic class, we\nalso cannot draw firmconclusions about\ntrends in psychotropic polypharmacy in\nthis age group over time. In addition,\nNAMCS and NHAMCS medication data\nwere recorded by physicians or their\noffice staff. We were unable to cross-\ncheck data with pharmacy records or\npatient/family reports of use, so it is not\nknown if psychotropic prescriptions\nwere actually filled and administered.\nData are also limited in the number of\nmedications (5\u00ad8) and diagnoses (3)\nrecorded foreach visit, so if children had\npsychotropic medications and behav-\nioral diagnoses that were listed more\ndistally in their records, they would not\nhave been recorded. In addition, data on\ndiagnoses reflect physicians' coding\npractices, but children did not have\nstandardized diagnostic assessments to\ndeterminethe validity oftheirdiagnoses.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite public concern about an in-\nexorable increase in pediatric psycho-\ntropicmedicationuse,wefoundthatthe\nlikelihood of psychotropic medication\nAmong 2- to 5-year-old US children with $1 behavioral diagnosis, rate (per 100 outpatient medical\nvisits) and AOR of psychotropic medication use by study interval.\nprescription in nationally representa-\ntive office medical visits for 2- to 5-year-\nlikelihood did not differ from that of the\nStabilization of psychotropic pre-\nscriptions cannot be explained by a\ndiminished emphasis on mental health\nissues during preschool medical visits,\nbecause the likelihood of receiving\na behavioral diagnosis increased over\ntime. In fact, among those with behav-\nioral diagnoses, psychotropic usage\ndecreased over time from 43% in\nstudy is needed to determine why boys,\nwhite children, and those lacking pri-\nvate insurance had an increased like-\nlihood of psychotropic use, and to\ndesign interventions to ensure that\ndifferences in use are congruent with\nwell-informed family goals and pref-\nerences. In addition, our findings un-\nderscore the need to ensure that\ndoctors of very young children who are\ndiagnosing ADHD, the most common\ndiagnosis, and prescribing stimulants,\nthe most common psychotropic medi-\ncations, are using the most up-to-date\nand stringent diagnostic criteria and\nclinical practice guidelines.45 Further-\nmore, given the continued use of psy-\nchotropic medications in very young\nchildren and concerns regarding their\neffects on the developing brain, future\nstudies on the long-term effects of\npsychotropic medication use in this\nage group are essential.46\n"
