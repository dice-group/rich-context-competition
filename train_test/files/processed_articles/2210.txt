Cobey2, Leander van der Meij1\n1 Department of Social and Organizational Psychology, VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2 Department of Social Psychology, University of\nGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands\n Introduction\nHumans are among a relatively restricted group of mammals,\n5% or less, that display male paternal care [1,2]. It is not\nuncommon for fathers to provide direct care to dependent\noffspring well into the second decade of their life, often even\ncaring for multiple overlapping offspring at the same time (e.g.,\n[3,4]). As a consequence of paternal investment human males must\nregulate the time and energy they allocate between mating and\nparental effort [2,3].\nWingfield, Hegner, Duffy, and Ball's `challenge hypothesis',\nbased on research from bird species, suggests that testosterone (T)\nhelps to regulate the trade-off between mating and parenting [5].\nSpecifically, it explains the function of varied T levels in seasonally\nbreeding birds, wherein T levels rise in the mating season and then\nsubsequently drop during the period of brooding and parental\ncare. The challenge hypothesis, reviewed in [6], has since been\nadapted to also account for changes in mating and parenting effort\nin humans (review in [7], example: [8]). Of course, in humans,\nbreeding does not follow a seasonal pattern, instead human males\nexperience high chronic T levels and can pursue mating\nopportunities throughout their lifespan [9]. Nonetheless, research\non the life history of human males appears to support the idea that\nT is intricately involved in regulating mating and pair bonding/\nparenting behavior (for review: [10]). Low male T levels have been\nshown to promote features relevant to parenting or investment [7].\nFor example, married men are known to have lower T levels than\nsamples of matched men who are unmarried (e.g., [11\u00ad14]).\nLikewise, men who are in committed relationships have been\nshown to have lower levels of T than uncommitted single men\n(e.g., [14\u00ad16]). A complementary line of research has shown that\nthe transition to fatherhood is also associated with a decrease in T\nlevels (e.g., [13,17\u00ad20]). The role of low T in facilitating parenting\nseems to be robust: in non-Western populations fathers have also\nbeen found to have lower T levels than non-fathers [17,19\u00ad21].\nThe adjustment of T levels upon the transition to fatherhood has\nbeen proposed to facilitate better fathering through priming men\nto provide care [22]. Yet, T levels have been found to be\nnegatively related to paternal investment in three studies from\nnon-Western cultures [17,21,23]. The notion of low levels of T\nbeing associated with nurturing responses is, however, consistent\nwith recent laboratory based work by van Anders and colleagues\n[24] who showed that providing a nurturing response to a crying\ndoll decreases male T levels. However, it should be noted that this\nsample consisted mostly of non-fathers. In line with van Anders\net al. findings [24], men who express a greater need to comfort a\ncrying baby experience an even larger decrease in their T levels\nthan men who do not express such a need [22]. However, a\ndifferent study showed an increase in T levels among fathers in\nresponse to crying by infants [25]. Moreover, to date, there is no\nconclusive evidence that T levels in males are negatively related to\ninteraction with children. One study using data on Jamaican\nfathers [26] and one study on Filipino fathers [27] did not find any\nsignificant relationship between T levels and interaction with\nchildren. A study by Storey and colleagues found a negative\nrelationship between amount of time spent interacting with\ntoddlers and percent change in T levels in a sample of Canadian\nIn contrast to findings suggesting that low T levels are related\nto nurturing behaviors, high T levels are known to promote\nmating behaviors. For example, T levels are known to increase\nwhen men view sexually explicit videos [29] and after they have\nhad sex [30]. Likewise, male T levels increase after a brief non-\nphysical social interactions with women [8,31]. Men with\nelevated T levels also show more affiliative behaviors towards\nwomen [32]. Finally, high T levels are positively associated with\nthe number of sex partners a man reports [33\u00ad35], and, more\nbroadly, have been argued to be positively related to male\nreproductive effort in humans [9].\nThere is also evidence that T levels regulate the tradeoff\nbetween mating and parental effort in women. For example, it has\nbeen shown that single women have higher levels of T than\npartnered women [36], married women have lower T levels than\nsingle women [37], and mothers have lower T levels than non-\nmothers [37,38]. However, the evidence linking T levels to mating\nand parental effort is far scarcer for females than it is for males,\nespecially when compared across species.\nHere, we present data that allowed us to explore the\nrelationship between being a parent, number of children and T\nlevels in a sample of elderly men and women. To our knowledge,\nno study in humans has yet examined the relationship between T\nlevels and breeding success in men and women with at least one\nchild in a large sample. We predicted, in line with the\naforementioned literature, that fatherhood and motherhood would\nbe negatively associated with T levels. In addition, we predicted\nthat, among fathers, breeding success would be higher among men\nwith relatively higher levels of T as these men may be more\ninclined to focus on mating effort. Among mothers we also\nexplored this latter relationship, but we did not expect a higher\nbreeding success for women with high T levels, as it seems unlikely\nthat women would increase their number of children via mating\neffort in the same way men do.\nMethods\n1. Ethics Statement\nThis paper makes use of secondary data analysis of a previously\ncollected data source, which is available to researchers via a data\narchive (ICPSR, www.icpsr.org). Ethical review was waived for the\ncurrent research project by the Ethics Review Board (VCWE,\nFaculty of Psychology and Pedagogics, VU University Amster-\ndam). The ethics approval of the original data collection can be\nfound in the NSHAP codebook (see: http://www.norc.org/\nResearch/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-\nproject.aspx).\n2. Dataset\nOur predictions were tested using an archival dataset of older\nAmericans aged 57\u00ad85 from the National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project (NSHAP) (N = 3,005; [39]). Relative to the American\npopulation the dataset oversampled men, African-Americans,\nLatinos, and the eldest age groups. Trained interviewers from\nthe National Opinion Research Centre (NORC) conducted the\nParticipant response rate was 75.5% (for the full description of\nthe data collection see [39] or [40]). At the time of the\ninterview participants also provided several in-home biomea-\nsures (e.g. Testosterone, Cotinine) and were given a leave-\nbehind questionnaire. We limited the sample to White\nof the female working sample n = 669), as exploring the\nrelationship in other ethnicities left us with too few cases\n(Males: Hispanics: n = 111; African Americans: n = 129; Other\nOther n = 18). While these numbers are much higher than some\npublished samples for T and paternal behavior (e.g., [22]), given\nthe high level of noise in these data and the small effects we\nexpect at the end of participants' reproductive lifespan, samples\nof around 150 are likely not sufficient. In addition, there are\nsuggestions that ethnicities differ both in their T levels (e.g.,\n[41]) as well as in their reproductive behavior (e.g., [42\u00ad44]). In\nESM S1 we present the results for the full sample with all\nethnicities. These results are quite similar to those reported\nbelow. However, given that the reported effects are predomi-\nnantly driven by White participants (.70% of working sample)\nand the reasons outlined above, we have chosen to report the\nresults for White participants rather than those of the pooled\nsample.\n3. Testosterone\nNinety percent of the overall sample complied in providing\nsaliva samples (N = 3,005). Participants who failed to have a\nsaliva samples taken successfully were excluded (4.5% of overall\nsample failed to provide a sample or provided a sample which\nwas not valid due to equipment failure (N = 135)). Saliva\nsamples were transported from interviews using cold packs and\ndry ice and were shipped to Salimetrics for analysis in duplicate\n(75.3% of the saliva samples provided actual T values, see [39]\nfor further details). The procedure and assay are described in\n[35] and [45]. We excluded outliers of two standard deviations\nfemales). As the key independent variable we used the mean\nscores of the T values from both hormone assays, which we\nsubsequently logarithmically transformed as values did not\nfollow a normal distribution.\n4. Childlessness and Number of Living Children\nNumber of children and childlessness were used as the\ndependent variable. This was captured by the items: ``How many\nliving daughters do you have'' and ``How many living sons do you have''\n([39]: p. 32-ff.). When participants asked if they should include or\nexclude step-sons/daughters they were told that they could include\nthem. It is thus possible that responses to these items include non-\nbiological children. However, we believe that the error as a result\nfrom asking about and reporting non-biological children can be\nconsidered as random noise, which is unrelated to T levels.\nTherefore, it seems unlikely that this noise would influence the\nstatistical conclusions of our results.\n5. Control Variables\nWhile some findings suggest that in older men the circadian\nrhythm in T is blunted or even lost (see [46]), we included the time\nof sampling as a control variable (coded as am/pm). Further, since\nmale T levels are known to decrease with age [47], participant age\nT and Male Childlessness and Offspring Count\nwas also used as a control variable. Educational attainment (four\ncategories) and Body Mass Index (BMI; measured by a trained\ninterviewer) were included as these may be factors which influence\ncirculating T and perhaps its relation to childlessness or offspring\ncount. Similarly, since previous research has shown that men with\nhigher T levels are more likely to divorce [12] and that T\ninfluences the likelihood of remarriage [35] we controlled for\nmarital status. Furthermore, it is possible that any relationship\nbetween childlessness and T is an artifact of these males being in a\ncommitted relationship. Thus, marital status is a necessary control\nvariable to distinguish whether or not the effect is driven by\ndifferences in T or differences in marital status. We also explored if\nthe number of opposite sex partners a participant reported\ninfluenced our main findings, because males with higher T have\nbeen shown to report more female sex partners (e.g., [33\u00ad35]).\nThese findings are described in the ESM S2. The descriptive\nstatistics of the aforementioned control variables can be found in\n6. Statistical Analyses\nWe used Generalized linear models with Maximum Likeli-\nhood estimation to analyze the data. We use negative binomial\nregression to analyze childlessness (GZLM; with NBR, [48]).\nThis method was preferred over logistic regression as it deals\nwith overdispersion better. For individuals with at least one\nchild, offspring count was analyzed via adjusted Poisson models,\ngiven that we are dealing with skewed count data. The number\nof children can be conceived as count data following a Poisson\ndistribution (number of events in an unknown sequence). Indeed\na Poisson model proved a much better fit to the data than a\nlinear model (all models DAIC.50 (Poisson vs. linear), although\nthe conclusions drawn from our results were the same for both\nmodels. The standard errors for the models we present were\nadjusted for model deviance, and thus take into account the\nunder- or overdispersion in any given model [48,49].\nWe reported model fit (AIC, BIC) and parameter statistics for\nour models. Our modeling strategy was as follows: (1) we first\nexamined a baseline model with no control variables; (2) we then\nsequentially added control variables, and only maintained these\nvariables when they improved model fit (Akaike Information\nCriterion (AIC); smaller-is-better; [50]). As a rule of thumb, two\nunits indicates an indistinguishable difference between models,\nwhereas ten units indicates a large difference between models and\nmore support for model A over model B [51]. This procedure is an\ninformation theoretic approach which leads to the best fitting\nmodel from our given set of variables [52,53]. Additionally, we\nreported also the Bayesian information criterion for each model\n(BIC, [54]) which tends to be more conservative. We presented the\nresults separately for males and females, as the distributions for T\nand offspring count are expected to differ significantly between the\nsexes. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS version 16.0.\nValues are mean 6 standard error means (SE) unless otherwise\nspecified. For illustrative purposes, we used raw T scores or Z\nscores, rather than log (T) scores within the (online) figures.\nResults\n1. Males: Childlessness\nTestosterone levels were associated with male childlessness (see\nFig. 1 and Table 1). Men who reported no living children had\nBinomial Regression Model showed indeed that log (T) was\npositively associated with childlessness. This effect remained after\ncontrolling for marital status (see model 2 in Table 1). However,\ninclusion of Marital Status, suggesting that the relationship\nbetween log(T) and childlessness is mediated by not being married.\nModel 2, with marital status and log(T) as predictors, could not be\nimproved by adding the other control variables (DAIC,1).\n2. Males: Offspring Count among Men with Living\nChildren\nWhen examining only men with at least one child, male T levels\nwere significantly and positively associated with the number of\nliving children (see Figure 1 and Table 2). At baseline, the model\npredicts that an increase of one standard deviation from the mean\nin raw T levels amounts to an increase of.12 children (see ESM\nS4). The significant association between T and offspring count\nremained after controlling for age and educational attainment (see\nmodel 2 and 3 in Table 2). Older and lower educated men tended\nto have more children than younger and higher educated men\nrespectively. Model 2 and Model 3 were virtually indistinguishable\nin terms of model fit (DAIC,2). Using a Bayesian approach, one\nwould select model 2 over model 3 (DBIC.11). Model 3 could not\nbe improved by adding other control variables, such as marital\nstatus (DAIC,1). As described in the endnote controlling for the\nnumber of reported opposite sex partners or remarriage does not\nalter this finding.\n3. Females: Childlessness and Offspring Count\nFor women there was no association between log (T) and\nchildlessness (Negative Binomial Regression Model; B = .572+/\nbetween log (T) and offspring count among women who reported\nDiscussion\nThree main findings emerge from this research. Firstly, we\nreplicated the finding that fathers have lower T levels than non-\nthe first time that this has been demonstrated in a large sample of\nelderly men. The decrease in T levels upon the transition to\nfatherhood is thought to facilitate the allocation of energy to\nactivities related to parenting. Yet, there are several studies\nindicating that T levels can be negatively related to paternal\ninvestment in males [17,21,23]. In contrast, the notion that T is\npositively related to fathering is supported, for example, by the\nfinding that men who experience a greater need to comfort a\ncrying baby experience a larger decrease in their T levels [22]. It is\nalso consistent with findings that providing a nurturing response to\ncrying baby actually decreases male T levels [24], though the\nmajority of this sample consisted of non-fathers. However, it is still\nunclear whether T levels and interacting with offspring are\nconsistently related in males (see [26\u00ad28]). Our results add to the\ncurrent literature by showing that in old age there still is a marked\nsignificant difference between (self-reported) fathers and non-\nfathers in T levels, though from this cross-sectional study it is\nunclear what the mechanism driving this decrease among fathers\nis. One potential mechanism could be close interaction with young\ngrandchildren, rather than fatherhood status per se. However, the\nfinding that (putative) fatherhood is associated with low T levels in\nold age, seems at odds with recent findings by Gettler and\ncolleagues who showed that while T levels decreased when Filipino\nmen became fathers, T levels returned to similar levels before\nfatherhood as their children aged [17]. These findings suggest that\nT and Male Childlessness and Offspring Count\nlonger-term effects of fatherhood on T levels are perhaps not\nuniversal and that they may differ between Western and non-\nWestern societies.\nSecondly, we showed that among elderly men who reported\nbeing fathers, those with higher T levels reported more (living)\nchildren than those with lower T levels. To our knowledge, our\nstudy is the first to demonstrate in a large sample of putative\nfathers that T levels are related to the reported number of children\ntowards the end of man's reproductive lifespan. While in theory,\nmen in our sample may still have more offspring, they are likely to\nbe close to the end of their reproductive lifespan as they were on\naverage 69 years old. That fathers with higher T levels would have\nmore children is consistent with the predictions of the Challenge\nHypothesis [7] and with T being involved in mating effort in\nhumans [9]. According to both these perspectives, in contexts\nwhere mating effort is required, e.g. to acquire sex partners, T\nlevels are (chronically) higher. Consequently, those fathers with\nhigher T levels may engage more frequently in attracting\n(additional) partners for sex, thereby increasing their likelihood\nto father additional children. This may be accomplished either\nthrough increased promiscuity, extramarital affairs or new\nmarriages. Indeed, in this same dataset we have previously shown\nthat men with higher T levels report more sex partners [35].\nSimilarly, previous research has shown that men with higher T\nlevels are more likely to get divorced [12]. Taken together, these\nbehaviors may result in the fathering of more children during their\nlifespan than fathers who did not engage in the acquisition of more\nsex partners. However, our results did not show that fathers with\nhigh T levels had more children because they remarried or\nbecause they had more sex partners. It may be that this effect was\nobscured because of social desirability in responses, which could\nespecially cause men with a family (i.e., fathers) to underreport\nextramarital affairs.\nApart from the acquisition of more sex partners by men with\nhigh T levels, additional mechanisms are plausible. It could be that\nthose fathers with high T levels were more fertile than those with\nFigure 1. Number of living children and mean testosterone level for Caucasian men (n = 754). Error bars represent 95% Confidence\nIntervals (10+ is only used for graphical representation analyses used the full range).\nTable 1.

In line with this reasoning, it is well established that\nT is crucial for male reproductive effort, fertility and the\nmaintenance of spermatogenesis ([9,10,55] for mechanisms see\n[56,57]) and, not surprising, low T levels are associated with male\ninfertility [58]. However, when considering fertile men, a recent\nstudy found no relationship between semen quality and T levels\n[59]. This latter finding suggests that increased fertility is not a\nlikely explanation for our finding. It could be that, although a\ncertain level of T is mandatory for fertility, higher T levels do not\nlead to increased fertility among men who are already fertile.\nFurthermore, rather than a direct effect of T on fertility, there\ncould also be a number of indirect effects of T on the number of\nchildren a man has. For example, lower T levels are positively\nassociated with obesity, stress and exposure to industrial pollutants\n(reviewed in [60]). It could thus be that those men with high T\nlevels have more children since they are more physically motivated\nand capable, and thus experience more opportunities for mating\nthan men with lower T levels. However, this relationship does not\nseem that likely since we controlled for BMI, which is an\nimportant health indicator.\nFinally, we found that T levels were not associated with either\nmotherhood or number of living children in our female sample.\nThis finding is in contrast to the results of Kuzawa and colleagues\n[38]. However, it is possible that among women there are no\nmeasurable associations between T and childlessness or offspring\ncount at an older age, while these do exist at other periods\nthroughout a female's life span, as the findings by Kuzawa and\ncolleagues on women in their reproductive window suggest. In this\nrespect, it is important to note that androgen levels of postmen-\nopausal women are substantially different from those of women of\nreproductive age (e.g, [61]). Moreover, the population and context\nof the Philippines, is very different from that of the United States,\nwhich likely makes the populations hard to compare (see [62,63]).\nTherefore these findings are not necessarily at odds with those of\nKuzawa and colleagues [38].\nThere are several notable limitations to this study. Firstly, our\nconclusions are based on self-reports. It could be that men with\nhigher T levels are more prone to boast their number of children,\nor alternatively, be more likely to include stepchildren as their own\nchildren. However, this seems unlikely since the effect of T on the\nnumber of self-reported children was not mediated via remarriage.\nSecondly, this study could not disentangle the mechanism through\nwhich fathers with higher T levels had more children: it could be\nthat they had more sex partners (although they did not report\nthem), that they were more fertile, that they had sex with their\npartner more frequently, or that they preferred sex partner(s) who\nwanted relatively more children. Similarly, men with high T levels\nmight have actually paired with more fertile women. Thirdly, the\nfathers in our study were not yet at the end of their theoretical\nreproductive life span and could therefore conceive additional\nchildren. The survey items also specifically asked participants to\nreport on the number of living children. One implication of our this\nfinding is that fathers with high T could invest less time towards\nparenting effort, which could potentially reduce the quality, health\nor even survival of their offspring. If it is true that survivorship of\nchildren was affected by high T fathers, findings reported herein\nmay be somewhat underestimated. Finally, our interpretation of\nthe relationship between number of offspring and T levels assumes\nthat individual differences in T levels demonstrate some stability\nover time. Indeed, there is some evidence that this so, since it has\nbeen shown in a longitudinal study covering 30 years that male\nfree T is at least moderately correlated (r = 0.5, [64]). The results\nfrom this study contribute to the growing literature that shows that\npair bonding and paternal care are associated with low T levels,\nwhile searching for and acquiring sex partners is associated with\nhigh T levels. An interesting avenue to pursue in future research\ncould be to look more closely at how age of children or contact\nwith children might interact with the effects reported herein.\nFuture research on T and reproductive success should take into\naccount that while fatherhood may decrease T levels in both the\nshort and long term, once a father, higher T levels are positively\nassociated with number of children.\nSupporting Information\nESM S1 Additional analyses on the full sample.\nESM S2 Additional analyses on sample of [35].\nESM S3 Descriptive statistics for the male working sample\nESM S4 Predicted number of children in Poisson Model by Z\nscores of (raw) testosterone for childed men (n = 704).\nTable 2.
