The small and\nnarrow surgical field makes visualization of\nthe lower pole of the tonsil difficult, how-\never. In addition, only the surgeon can view\nthe surgical process, thereby excluding the\nassistant. Attempts to perform tonsillec-\ntomy using an endoscope have been\nreported, but the endoscopic surgical field\nis not three-dimensional.10\nWe have performed coblation tonsillec-\ntomy using a surgical microscope. On the\nbasis of our experience, we hypothesized that\nthe surgical microscope allows for minimally\ninvasive tonsillectomy with less damage and\nintraoperative blood loss, and a more radical\nresection than conventional tonsillectomy.\nThe present retrospective study compared\nthe surgical duration, intraoperative blood\nloss, incidence of haemorrhage, postopera-\ntive pain, and length of hospital stay after\nsurgery in patients undergoing coblation\ntonsillectomy with or without microscopic\nguidance. The use of a microscope during\nsurgery does not simply enlarge the field of\nvision, it offers an innovative change to the\nsurgical approach. Therefore, this article also\nsummarizes the key technical aspects of this\nsurgical approach.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study retrieved the\nmedical records of adult patients (>18\nyears old) who underwent tonsillectomy at\nthe Department of Otolaryngology, The\nFifth People's Hospital of Shanghai,\nFudan University, Shanghai, China,\nDiagnosis of and treatment for tonsillar\nhypertrophy and chronic tonsillitis were\nperformed by a single surgeon with a\ndecade of experience in various types of\ntonsil surgeries (Y.P.). Exclusion criteria\nwere: history of acute tonsil infection\nwithin the previous 2 weeks; peritonsillitis;\nsystemic diseases such as heart disease and\ncoagulopathies. Patients undergoing tonsil-\nlar biopsy, unilateral tonsillectomy, tonsil-\nlectomy for known carcinoma, and\ntonsillectomy in conjunction with palatal\nsurgery were also excluded.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of the Fifth People's Hospital of\nShanghai, Fudan University, and all\npatients provided written informed consent.\nSurgical technique\nMicroscope-assisted ablation tonsillectomy\nwas introduced in our institution in 2011.\nPatients were not randomized because surgi-\ncal approach was determined by admission\ndate. All tonsillectomies were performed by\na single attending surgeon (Y.P.) with assist-\nance from one of two residents (J.H. or S.H.),\nusing a COBLATOR\u00d5 II (ArthroCare\u00d5,\nSmith & Nephew, London, UK). For sur-\ngeries performed under a microscope\n(OPMI\u00d5 PRO magis; Carl Zeiss Microscopy\nGmbH, Munich, Germany), images were\nmagnified 3\u00ad8 times (Figure 1).\nThe surgical approach when using a\nmicroscope differs from that without\na microscope in several ways. When using\na microscope, an incision is made at the\njunction of the palatoglossal arch and the\ntonsils using a coblation plasma wand\n(EVAC\u00d5 70 XTRA HP; Smith & Nephew).\nThe upper poles of the tonsils are gradually\npulled to allow separation from the incision\nto the tonsillar capsule. Compared with\nconventional surgery, the incision is closer\nto the tonsils to avoid damage to the\npalatoglossal arch mucosa around the\nuvula as far as possible and prevent post-\noperative uvular oedema. During the\ngradual separation of the tonsil, the\nmicroscopic angle can be adjusted to accom-\nmodate the surgical site. Use of the micro-\nscope thus allows better visualization of the\nsurgical field, particularly for treatment of\nthe lower poles of the tonsils, as there is no\nresidual lower pole tissue.\nIntraoperative ablation with a plasma\nwand is performed only for the loose\ntissue between the capsule and pharyngeal\nmuscles during microscope-assisted surgery,\nthereby avoiding direct damage to\nthe parapharyngeal muscles. In contrast\nto coblation tonsillectomy without micro-\nscopic guidance, the white envelope of the\ntonsils can be completely distinguished,\nblood vessels around the tonsils. Only the\nnourishing blood vessels penetrating the\ntonsils and entering the envelopes are\noccluded during surgery. Damage to tonsil-\nlar arteries and paratonsillar veins is effect-\nively avoided by the use of the microscope.\nIn our experience, damage to the paraton-\nsillar vein (external palatine vein) is a major\ncause of blood loss during treatment of the\nupper pole using conventional surgery. Use\nof a microscope allows this vein to be\neffectively distinguished, and occlusion\nof only the vein network exported from the\ncapsule of the tonsil is easily avoided, limit-\ning blood loss. All surgeries were performed\nunder general anaesthesia with sterilized\ndrapes. A Boyle\u00adDavis gag was used to\nexpose the surgical field.\nOutcomes\nPatient data included those recorded during\nsurgery, intraoperative blood loss and dur-\nation of postoperative hospital stay.\nIntraoperative blood loss was calculated by\na nurse as the volume of fluid drained via\nsuction minus the volume of saline flush\n(minimum quantifiable volume 5 ml).\nPostoperative haemorrhage was defined as\ncontinuous bleeding that patient had to spit\nout or swallow and was considered to have\noccurred if the wound actively bled and\nrequired management by the responsible\nclinician (including local oppression, haemo-\nstasis, haemostyptic or surgical rebleeding),\nor bled again after improvement. Primary\nhaemorrhage occurred within the first 24h\npostoperatively, and secondary haemorrhage\noccurred after 24h postoperatively.\nFigure 1.

In addition, at our hospital,\nspecial staff members perform postoperative\ntelephone follow-up, during which doctors\nguide the patients to take oral analgesics\nregularly and answer the patients' questions\nto establish good communication and\nensure compliance. All patients routinely\nreceived oral nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs (300 mg ibuprofen, twice daily)\nfor analgesia during the first 5 postoperative\ndays, with instructions to use medications\nas needed for the next 6 \u00ad 10 days.\nPostoperative pain was graded on a scale\nof 0 to 10 using a Visual Analogue Scale\n(VAS), where 0 indicates no pain, 1\u00ad3\nrepresents mild pain, 4\u00ad7 represents moder-\nate pain, and 10 indicates extreme pain. A\nscore of 3 was set as the cut-off value as it\nwas considered to indicate a level of pain\nthat did not affect the patient's quality-of-\nlife or sleep. A nurse recorded pain scores at\nrest and on swallowing daily at the same\ntime for the first 10 postoperative days by\nface-to-face or telephone inquiry. The\nnumber of days until a patient reported a\npain score of 3 was recorded.\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD.\nDuration of surgery, intraoperative blood\nloss, and duration of postoperative stay\nwere analysed using Student's independent\ntwo-sample t-test. Postoperative haemor-\nrhage was analysed using 2-test. Multiple\nlinear regression analysis was used for\nbetween-group comparison of postoperative\npain scores, using postoperative day and\nsurgery type as independent variables and\npain score as dependent variable. Between-\ngroup differences in the number of days\nrequired for a patient to report a score of 3\nwere compared using Student's t-test.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nStata\u00d5 version 12 (StataCorp LP, College\nStation, TX, USA). A P-value of < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study retrospectively reviewed the med-\nical records of 411 patients. After exclusions,\nthe final analysis included 168 patients\nyears; age range 18 \u00ad 53 years). Patients were\nstratified according to the use of a surgical\nmicroscope: direct vision group (n \u00bc 76;\nyears; age range 19 \u00ad 46 years) and micro-\nyears). Similar proportions of patients in\neach group were prescribed analgesia in the\nfirst 5 days after surgery (direct vision group,\npatients in the direct vision group and\ncontinued to take analgesic medication.\nClinical data are shown in Table 1. There\nwas no significant between-group difference\nin duration of surgery, intraoperative blood\nloss, or the incidence of primary haemor-\nrhage. The incidence of secondary haemor-\nrhage and duration of hospital stay were\nsignificantly lower in the microscope group\nthan the direct vision group (P < 0.05 and\nMultivariate linear regression analysis\nfound that postoperative day and surgery\ntype were significantly associated with post-\noperative pain scores both at rest and on\nswallowing (P < 0.05 for each comparison).\nPain scores were significantly lower in the\nmicroscope group than the direct vision\nand while swallowing reached 3\nsignificantly faster in the microscope group\nthan the direct vision group (P < 0.001 for\neach comparison; Table 1).\nDiscussion\nTonsillectomy has been traditionally\nregarded as a minor surgery, and otolaryn-\ngologists have therefore not always con-\nsidered the need for further optimization\nand innovation in this field. Coblation ton-\nsillectomy has the primary advantage of\nlimited thermal damage compared with\nalternative forms of surgery. Derived from\n``controlled ablation,'' the name refers to the\nnon-heat driven process of surgically dis-\nsociating soft tissue using bipolar radio-\nfrequency energy to excite electrolytes in a\nconductive medium (such as saline solution)\nto create a precisely focused plasma field\nCoblation tonsillectomy is an improvement\nover electrosurgery using monopolar blades\nor bipolar suction, with respect to damage\nThe primary advantage of surgery using a\nmicroscope over direct vision is the ability to\nobserve the detailed anatomy of the extra-\ncapsular loose tissues of the tonsil. In\naddition, surgical assistants and students\ncan directly observe the surgical process\nthrough a secondary mirror or external\nmonitor. Even with the application of new\ntechniques, the majority of tonsillectomies\nare performed under direct vision. Surgeons\ncommonly perform this procedure using a\n2.5\u00ad5 \u00c2 surgical loupe and a headlamp,\nalthough the magnification, lighting and\nimage field are inferior to those achieved\nwith a microscope. In contrast to loupes and\nheadlamps, the magnification of a micro-\nscope can be adjusted at any time during\nsurgery; it can be set to 3\u00c2 at the beginning\nof surgery and increased to 6\u00ad8\u00c2 when\nrequired for the precise separation of sur-\nrounding blood vessels. Moreover, surgical\nmicroscopes have a mechanical arm bracket\nfor positioning that prevents the field of view\nfrom moving and is very flexible. The visual\nand light axes are almost parallel, allowing\ndeep illumination and visualization of the\nsurgical site. These features improve visual-\nization of the tonsillar surgical cavity.\nMicroscopes result in better representation\nof the colour, brightness and clarity of light\nthan loupes and headlamps, and can be\nconnected to an image display system to\nfacilitate teaching.\nTable 1. Clinical parameters in adult patients undergoing coblation tonsillectomy via direct vision or with\nmicroscope guidance.\nParameter Direct vision group n \u00bc 76 Microscope group n \u00bc 92\nIntraoperative blood loss, ml <5 <5\nTime to VAS pain score 3, days\nData presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n of patients (%; 95% confidence intervals [CI]).\na< 24 h postoperatively.\nb> 24 h postoperatively.\nThe use of a microscope for tonsillec-\ntomy results in the procedure being minim-\nally invasive. In our experience, minimally\ninvasive tonsil surgery results in a decrease\nin primary and secondary haemorrhage\nrates and less tissue damage. Wide ablation\nis unnecessary and thermal damage to\ntissues is limited. The severity of post-\noperative pain and the average time to\nachieve the cut-off pain score of 3 were\nsignificantly lower in the microscope group\nthan the direct vision group in the present\nstudy. This is likely to be related to\ndecreased intraoperative damage to sur-\nrounding tissues, confirming the results of\naspects may be influenced by the use of oral\nmedication, however, and although each\npatient received ibuprofen, variations in\ncompliance can cause bias.\nCoblation tonsillectomy has been shown\nto result in less intraoperative blood loss\nthan conventional tonsil dissection with\ncooling instruments.24\u00ad32 The majority of\ntonsil dissections involve a blood loss of\n<40 ml and, although this volume is not\nharmful to patients, reduced blood loss\nallows a clearer surgical field and facilitates\nsimplified surgery. Haemostasis was\nachieved at the end surgery in the present\nstudy, and the incidence of primary haem-\norrhage was significantly lower than that\nreported after conventional tonsil dissection\nwith cooling instruments (7.4%).33 It has\nbeen found that the incidence of secondary\nhaemorrhage after coblation tonsillectomy\nwas higher than that after surgery with\ncooling instruments.34\u00ad36 The denatured col-\nlagen formed by thermal damage can result\nin a thin protective layer covering the\nsurface of the tonsillar fossa.36 This post-\noperative protective layer in the surgical\ncavity is thicker than that formed after\nconventional tonsillectomy, slowing the\ninfiltration of inflammatory cells and for-\nmation of fibrous tissue, and resulting in an\nincrease in the incidence of delayed\npostoperative haemorrhage.37 There was\nno significant between-group difference in\nthe incidence of primary, short-term haem-\norrhage in the present study, but there were\nsignificantly fewer cases of secondary haem-\norrhage in the microscope group than the\ndirect vision group. We believe that the\ntechnical precision provided by surgical\nmicroscopy decreased the degree of thermal\ndamage in the surgical cavity compared with\nconventional surgery. In addition, the use of\na microscope decreased the damage to the\nextracapsular vessels, particularly the para-\ntonsillar vein.\nThis study has several limitations. First,\npostoperative bleeding after tonsillectomy is\nuncommon, therefore the sample size for\nthis event was small. A further limitation\nwas the retrospective design and small over-\nall sample size. Although all suitable\npatients were included, the sample size was\ndetermined by the number of patients that\nfulfilled the inclusion criteria within the\nstudy period. In addition, because it was\nnot possible to determine the precise daily\nmedication use of patients there was an\ninevitable bias with regard to the use of\nanalgesia. There were no obvious between-\ngroup differences in prescription of\nanalgesics, however. Additional prospective\nstudies with a larger sample size are required\nto confirm the findings of this study.\nIn conclusion, the use of a surgical\nmicroscope during coblation tonsillectomy\ndecreases the duration of hospital stay and\nthe incidence of postoperative secondary\nhaemorrhage, and results in an early\nimprovement in postoperative pain scores.\nThis technique is also useful for medical\nteaching.\n"
