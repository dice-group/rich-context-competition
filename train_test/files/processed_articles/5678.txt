With the provision of\nappropriate health care, the population of a country could have better health, thus strengthening the nation's human capital,\nwhich could contribute to economic growth through improved productivity. How much should countries spend on health\ncare? This study aims to estimate the optimal health care expenditure in a growing economy. Applying the experiences of\ncountries from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) over the period 1990 to 2009, this\nresearch introduces the method of system generalized method of moments (GMM) to derive the design of the estimators\nof the focal variables. Empirical evidence indicates that when the ratio of health spending to gross domestic product (GDP)\nis less than the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health spending effectively lead to better economic performance. Above\nthis, more spending does not equate to better care. The real level of health spending in OECD countries is 5.48% of GDP,\nwith a 1.87% economic growth rate. The question which is posed by this study is a pertinent one, especially in the current\ncontext of financially constrained health systems around the world. The analytical results of this work will allow policymakers\nto better allocate scarce resources to achieve their macroeconomic goals.\n",

Empirical\nEvidence From OECD Countries\nFuhmei Wang, PhD1\n Keywords\nhealth expenditure, economic performance, generalized method of moments, Organization for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nThe global financial crisis has led many countries to reduce\nspending dramatically, with health care being a common target\nof such reductions. However, the provision of health care is\nimportant for improving a population's health, which in turn can\nlead to more productivity, better economic performance, and\nthen more fiscal resources. However, could better economic\nperformance be achieved through more health spending? The\nfindings of the current literature with regard to the influences of\nhealth expenditure on economic growth are ambiguous.1,2 How\nmuch should countries spend on health care?3 Previous research\nhas not suggested the optimal level of health expenditure using\nempirical evidence. The current study thus aims to investigate\nwhether raising health expenditure can effectively improve eco-\nnomic performance, and so it also aims to find the optimal level\nof health expenditure to maximize economic growth.\nMethods and Specifications\nExisting studies have examined various aspects of the\nhealth expenditure\u00adeconomic growth nexus. However, the\nhistorical and institutional backgrounds of each country\nare unique, and thus the question is a rather complex one.\nAn empirical methodology that controls for cross-country\nvariations in certain political and economic institutional\ncharacteristics, and successfully deals with differences\nacross countries, would be able to offer a better framework\nfor statistical inferences. The use of simple ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) estimation could lead to biased and incon-\nsistent parameter estimates, due to regressor endogeneity.\nThis article overcomes these issues by introducing the gen-\neralized method of moments (GMM) technique to derive\nthe design of the estimators of interest.4,5\n1National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nFuhmei Wang, Department of Economics, Department of Public Health,\nand Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy, National Cheng\nKung University, No. 1 University Road, Tainan, 701 Taiwan.\nEmail: fmwang@mail.ncku.edu.tw\nSubjects\nHealth expenditure in developed countries has risen faster\nthan gross domestic product (GDP). Organization for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) coun-\ntries are all developed nations. The well-established social\nsecurity systems in these counties have contributed to\nimprovements in the health of their populations, although\nthis has also caused a fast rise in health expenditure. This\nresearch provides rigorous scientific examinations to exam-\nine the following issues: (1) how health expenditure affects\nan economy's GDP growth, (2) whether there is an optimal\nratio of health expenditure relative to GDP, and (3) whether\nand how the other factors influence economic performance.\nThe results could be used to derive the appropriate health\nexpenditure level to obtain better economic performance and\nsocial well-being.\nAnalytical Framework\nThe Grossman model has yielded considerable insights into\nthe determinants of health, as well as into the allocation of\ntime and money into health production.6 The working hours\nand productivities of workers in poor health both decline,\nand this is one economic side effect of a health care policy.7,8\nA key premise of the literature is that good health enhances\nworker productivity and improves economic outputs.9,10\nHuman capital can only be productive if it is healthy.\nHealth expenditures thus influence economic growth by\nimproving and enhancing productivity. The production func-\ntion of per capita GDP(y) could be a function of health\nexpenditure (h) and a vector (X) of public services and socio-\neconomic variables that affect real per capita GDP:\ny f h\n= ( , ).\nEmpirical Tests\nEconomic growth rates depend on the combined influences\nof several factors, rather than just one or two key elements.\nProvision of health services requires the use of public\nresources. At the macroeconomic level, there is a potential\ntrade-off between health and other public expenditures that\nmay affect economic performance. An increase in the ratio of\nhealth expenditure to GDP affects economic performance\nthrough two channels. The first is due to the crowding out\neffect, whereby an increase in health expenditure reduces\nexpenditure on other public spending, which might also be\nable to improve productivity. This channel tends to reduce\neconomic growth. The second channel is related to the effects\nof improvements in public health, whereby an increase in\nhealth spending tends to improve the productivity of work-\ners. This channel leads to better economic performance. The\nnet effect of a rise in health expenditure on economic growth\ndepends on the relative strength of these two channels.\nObviously, a rise in the share of health expenditure favors\n(deters) the economic growth rate if it improves (deterio-\nrates) workers' health. The relationship between health\nexpenditure and economic growth may be non-linear, and\nthis issue needs to be examined. This research then tries to\nfind the optimal level of health expenditure. The model used\nhere is typical of economic growth determinant models, and\nlog log\ny y h\nh t i\nit it it\nit it it\n= + +\n+ +\n-\n \n  \n...,N,\nwhere log yit\nrepresents per capita real GDP in logarithmic\nform, hit\nrepresents the ratio of health expenditure relative to\nGDP, hit\n2 represents the square of the ratio of health expendi-\nture relative to GDP, it\nrepresents an idiosyncratic error\nterm, and i and t represent country and time period, respec-\ntively. The vectors of Xit\nare composed of socio-economic\nand demographic explanatory variables. Our primary interest\nis how health expenditure affects economic growth, and\nwhether other factors influence this relationship.\nEconometric Method\nGMM has been widely applied by researchers, to examine\nsubjects as diverse as financial and economic issues to public\nhealth studies on the effects of AIDS deaths on households\nsince the 1990s.5 This econometric technique is specifically\ndesigned to extract causal lessons from data or observations\n(whether countries, hospitals, or patients), each of which is\nobserved only annually over 5 or 10 years, as well as to resolve\nthe issue of multicollinearity between explanatory variables.\nData Description\nApplying the experiences of OECD countries, the panel\ndatasets of the dependent and explanatory variables are\nthe global financial crisis that arose after this. The following\nsocio-economic and demographic explanatory variables are\nexamined: the ratio of health expenditure relative to GDP;\nthe square of the ratio of health expenditure relative to GDP;\nthe ratios of military expenditure, education expenditure, and\ngovernment consumption expenditure to GDP; the tax rate;\nthe growth rate of the college enrollment rate; the inflation\nrate; the openness and the corruption indexes; the develop-\nment index; the aggregate birth rate; the population; the ratio\nof young people in the population; the ratio of elderly people\nin the population; and the per capita GDP growth rate for the\nlast period in logarithmic form. The survey data are collected\nfrom World Development Indicator for the period from 1990\nto 2009. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics and\nFigure 1 presents a scatter plot showing the relationship\nbetween government health expenditure and the economic\nAfter identifying the factors that might affect the per cap-\nita GDP growth rate in log form and by applying the GMM\nestimators in STATA 10.0 to the survey data, this research\nfurther estimates the significance of the coefficients corre-\nsponding to each of the above-mentioned explanatory\nvariables.\nResults\nThe GMM estimated results for per capita GDP growth rates\nin log form, as well as for the other variables, are presented\nin Table 2. The results for AR(1), AR(2), and the Sargan test\nselection of variables is valid, the estimation equation is cor-\nrectly specified, and the estimation results are robust.\nBased on Table 2, the growth rate of the college enroll-\nment rate, the corruption index, the development index, the\naggregate birth rate, and per capita GDP growth rate in log\nform of the last period all statistically and significantly influ-\nence per capita GDP growth rate. Multiplying the coeffi-\ncients of these socio-economic explanatory variables by the\nrespective mean values from the summary statistics in Table\n1 and adding them up to the constant term yields the specifi-\ncations of Equation (3), and this can then be used to explore\nthe exact relationship between health expenditure and eco-\nnomic performance. The main concern of this study is to\nexplore how health expenditure affects economic perfor-\nmance. The impact of health expenditure on economic per-\nformance is estimated as follows:\nPercapitaGDPgrowthrateinlog\n. . . ,\n=\n+ -\nh h\nwhere h presents the ratio of health expenditure to GDP.\nFigure 2 presents the estimated graph, and shows the rela-\ntionship between health spending and economic growth is\nnon-linear. When the ratio of health spending to GDP is less\n(more) than the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health\nspending are associated with faster (slower) economic\ngrowth. The maximum economic growth is 3%. The real\nlevel of health spending is 5.48% of GDP in OECD coun-\ntries, and the economic growth rate is 1.87% over the period\nDiscussion\nIn general, people with better health are capable of produc-\ning more goods and services than those in poor health,\nTable 1.

Nevertheless, an increase\nin health expenditure, which could improve the health of the\nworkforce, might crowd out other expenditure, such as\nspending on infrastructure inputs, that could also stimulate\neconomic growth. The impact of increases in health expendi-\nture on economic growth is thus ambiguous.\nOver the coming decades both developing and industrial-\nized countries will face sharp rises in health expenditure, as\nwell as other long-term health care challenges, because of\ntheir aging populations. Our findings indicate that it is worth-\nwhile for governments to increase investment in health until it\nreaches an optimal level to achieve greater economic develop-\nment. The Dartmouth Atlas project and researchers agree that\nmore spending on health does not necessarily equate to better\ncare.12-14 The current study challenges the assumption that\nincreased spending in health care is inevitable and unavoid-\nable, and tries to find the effective level of health spending for\nstimulating economic growth, while also improving the popu-\nlation's well-being. Based on empirical evidence from OECD\ncountries, when the ratio of health spending to GDP is less\nthan the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health spending\neffectively lead to better economic performance. Otherwise,\nsuch spending does not cause improvements in care. With the\nprovision of appropriate health care, the population could have\nbetter health, and thus a nation's human capital would be\nstronger and better able to contribute to economic growth\nthrough improved productivity.15\nRecent economic downturns tend to have the greatest\neffects on working age adults.TheWorld Health Organization\nhas raised concern over the financial crisis' impact on global\nhealth, in particular among the poor and vulnerable.7,8\nFurthermore, this article finds that increases in the ratio of\nthe elderly people in the population do not affect economic\ngrowth significantly. Our findings reflect that appropriate\nspending on health care supports economic development.\nThe overarching empirical question that is posed by this\nresearch is a pertinent one, especially in the context of the\nfinancially constrained health systems that now operate\naround the world, which are being squeezed by multiple\ndevelopments, including (1) a financial squeeze due to the\nglobal economic downturn, (2) rapidly expanding and\nincreasingly costly treatment regimes, and (3) rapidly aging\npopulations. It is thus more crucial than ever to carry out an\nappropriate policy analysis at the macroeconomic level,\nwhich will allow policymakers to better allocate scarce\nresources in the public sector. In future work, we shall inves-\ntigate the impact of preventative health care on a nation's\nhealth and economic performance, through its effects on\nimproved health and productivity, as well as reduced future\ndemand for health care and possible reductions in health\nexpenditure. This issue is important, as the knowledge gained\nfrom such research could help reduce the deficits in public\nbudgets caused by expensive health systems.\nAuthor's Note\nThe funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis,\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nTable 2.
