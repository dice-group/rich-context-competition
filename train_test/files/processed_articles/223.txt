    "reduced_content": "If those who can afford to buy health insurance choose not to, what are the\nimplications for our voluntary system of coverage?\n \n \nLack of insurance is not solely an\nissue for the poor. In both California\nand the nation, approximately 40 per-\ncent of the uninsured have family incomes of\nat least twice the federal poverty level, and\none-quarter have family incomes of at least\n300 percent of poverty.1 Examining the issue\nfrom this perspective does not detract from\nthe importance of ensuring that those with\nthe least means in our society obtain health\ninsurance and better access to care. However,\nit does evoke questions about the point at\nwhich health insurance is the responsibility of\nthe individual rather than of society.\nNationally, the vast majority (80 percent)\nof the nonpoor (persons with incomes above\n200 percent of poverty) obtain health insur-\nance through employment, but a significant\nminority are self-employed, work for a firm\nthat does not offer coverage, or turn down\nemployer-offered coverage.2 For these persons\n(and their dependents), the main options are\nto purchase individual health insurance or to\nremain uninsured. About 7 percent purchase\nindividual insurance (35 percent of those not\ncovered through employment); the remainder\ngo without coverage. Interestingly, and some-\nof poverty are just as likely to purchase indi-\nvidual health insurance as are those with in-\nThe nonpoor are not strong candidates for\npublic insurance programs or significant pre-\nmium subsidies. Only five states have ex-\npanded health insurance premium subsidies\nto adults with incomes greater than 200 per-\ncent of the federal poverty level, and there is\nno serious discussion of doing so at the na-\ntional level.4 As a society, we assume that per-\nsons at this income level will voluntarily pur-\nchase health insurance, and many of them do.\nWhy don't all of them do so? Are they worried\nabout being uninsured? How do they get ac-\ncess to the medical care system, and at what\ncost? Would they consider purchasing cover-\nage? Answers to these questions will help to\ninform the discussion about the potential for\nexpanding coverage within the current volun-\ntary system.\nCharacteristics Of The Nonpoor\nUninsured\nIn fall 1998 the Field Research Corporation\nundertook a random-digit-dial screening to\nidentify California adults meeting two crite-\nria: uninsured and with household incomes of\nat least 200 percent of the federal poverty\nlevel (approximately 9 percent of California's\npopulation).5 Telephone interviews were con-\nducted in English and Spanish with 1,009 re-\nspondents, to collect information on atti-\ntudes, utilization and charges, perception of\n\u00a92000Project HOPE\u00adThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nJill Yegian is a senior program officer, David Pockell is a senior adviser, and Mark Smith is president and\nchief executive officer of the California HealthCare Foundation in Oakland.

Of\nthose who obtained any medical services or\nprescriptions, the median out-of-pocket\nThe difference between the two values indi-\ncates that although most of the uninsured are\nobtaining relatively few services at a relatively\nlow cost, a small proportion are high users\nwith a heavy associated financial burden.\nAmong the 54 percent reporting one or\nmore medical visits, 84 percent were charged\nfor at least some of those services. Of those\ncharged, 81 percent reported paying the entire\nbill, and only 6 percent said that they paid\nnothing. Almost half (46 percent) of those\nwith outstanding charges were continuing to\npay in installments.\nAttitudes Toward Insurance\nTo assess attitudes toward health insurance,\nrespondents were read a series of statements\nand asked whether they agreed or disagreed,\nstrongly or somewhat (Exhibit 3). Four state-\nments explored each respondent's degree of\nworry--for themselves, for their families, re-\nlated to health (obtaining proper medical\ncare), and related to finances (being wiped\nout financially). Consistently, 60 percent\nagreed that they worried a lot about each of\nthese issues; those with higher incomes were\nless likely to be concerned, as were those with\nbetter health status. About 20 percent dis-\nagreed strongly with these statements (that\nis, they do not worry at all).\nDespite this fairly high degree of worry, the\nmajority (57 percent) of respondents dis-\nagreed with the statement, \"Health insurance\nranks very high on my list of priorities for\nwhere to spend my money.\" One explanation\nmay lie in respondents' perceived value of\nhealth insurance: 43 percent agreed with the\nstatement, \"Health insurance is not a very\ngood value for the money.\"\nThe complexity of the delivery system does\nnot appear to be a barrier to purchasing cover-\nage. Only 10 percent of respondents agreed\nstrongly that \"getting health care through a\nhealth insurance plan is too complicated for\nme,\" while 46 percent disagreed strongly.\nCost And Willingness To Pay\nThe survey included questions about respon-\ndents' perception of the cost of \"a basic health\ninsurance plan\" and willingness to pay for\ncoverage.11 Overall, respondents believed that\nhealth insurance cost about twice as much as\nHealth Care Use And Charges Over The Past Twelve Months, Mean And Median\nAny visit\nPhysician visit\nLab\nHospital outpatient\nChiropractor/acupuncturist\nCommunity clinic\nOther medical\nEmergency room\nHospital (overnight)\n\u00ada\nSOURCE: California HealthCare Foundation/Field Research Corporation Survey of California's Non-Poor Uninsured, 1998.\na Bases for hospital charges are very small.

Per-\nceived cost increased with age, accurately re-\nflecting the fact that age is a standard rating\nfactor in California's individual market (a me-\ndian of $80 for those ages nineteen to twenty-\nnine, compared with a median of $200 for\nthose ages fifty to sixty-four).\nTo compare perceived cost and willing-\nness-to-pay responses with the actual cost of\nhealth insurance, responses to both questions\nwere indexed to premiums of various individ-\nual (nongroup) insurance products actually\noffered by California health plans in 1998.\nSince the cost of health insurance varies con-\nsiderably by age and geography, the cost cited\nby each respondent was indexed to what that\nperson would have had to pay for a particular\ntype of plan based on age and county of resi-\ndence. Costs were calculated for three types\nof individual insurance products available in\nthe California market: a $10 copayment for\nphysician visits, a $40 copayment for physi-\ncian visits, and a $2,000 deductible. Actual\ncosts that each respondent would have had to\npay for each product were calculated by aver-\naging 1998 published rates for each type of\nproduct across the three major health plans in\nCalifornia's individual market (only two of\nthe three offer high-copayment and high-\ndeductible products). Note that each respon-\ndent gave a single answer to each of the two\nquestions (perceived cost and willingness to\npay); that response was indexed to premiums\nfor all three health insurance products.12\nRespondents' perceptions of cost often ex-\nceeded the actual cost, especially for the\nlower-premium plans (Exhibit 4). One-third\nof the respondents perceived the cost of a \"ba-\nsic health insurance plan for yourself\" as 20\npercent or more over what they would actu-\nally have had to pay in premiums for insur-\nance with a $10 copayment for physician of-\nAttitudes Toward Health Insurance Among Nonpoor Uninsured Californians, 1998\nI worry a lot about not having health insurance for myself\nI worry a lot about not having health insurance for others\nin my familya\nI worry a lot about not getting proper medical care and\nattention if I get sick\nI worry a lot about being wiped out financially because\nI don't have health insurance\nPeople who don't have health insurance have a difficult\ntime getting proper medical care and treatment\nMost of the people I know have health insurance\nI don't get the medical care I need because I can't\nafford to pay for it\nHealth insurance ranks very high on my list of priorities\nfor where to spend my money\nI pretty much live from paycheck to paycheck\nHealth insurance is not a very good value for the money\nI rely a lot on the kind of care that health insurance\ndoesn't cover\nGoing to public or free clinics for my medical needs is\njust fine with me\nGetting health care through a health insurance plan\nSOURCE: California HealthCare Foundation/Field Research Corporation Survey of California's Non-Poor Uninsured, 1998.\na Based on respondent households with more than one member, excluding those where respondent's parent is chief wage\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Slightly more than half re-\nported the same willingness to pay for the $40\ncopayment plan. Indexing the willingness-to-\npay responses to the high-deductible product\nproduces results virtually identical to those\nfor the $40 copayment product because the\ntwo sets of premiums are very similar.\nThe survey then briefly described each of\nthe insurance options and asked respondents\nwhether they would purchase the three types\nof health insurance products at their actual\n(age- and county-specific) premiums. Only\nhighly simplified descriptions could be given\nfor products whose benefit features vary\ngreatly, but responses give a general sense of\nthe level of interest. A majority (53 percent)\nreported that they would buy at least one of\nthe three options. Of the 53 percent, about\nhalf preferred the $40 copayment plan; the\n$2,000 deductible product was the least pre-\nferred. There was little difference in responses\nacross income categories.\nA limitation of this analysis is that premi-\nums may vary with health status in Califor-\nnia's individual health insurance market; per-\nsons responding to the questions about cost\nand willingness to pay may actually be\ncharged a premium that is different from the\nstandard rates used here. However, two fac-\ntors ameliorate this limitation. First, age,\nwhich reflects health status to some extent,\nwas incorporated into this analysis since it is\na standard factor used by the health plans in\nsetting rates. Second, 60 percent of the sample\nreported being in excellent or very good\nhealth. Restricting the analysis to this portion\nof the sample--those most likely to be ac-\ncepted by health plans under their standard\nrates--produces results virtually identical to\nthose described above and shown in Exhibit 4.\nPolicy Implications\nMisperceptions about the cost of health in-\nsurance or lack of awareness of the full range\nof options that exist in the individual market\nmay be a significant factor in the lack of health\ninsurance for some nonpoor Californians. To\nthe extent that such persons perceive the cost\nof health insurance to be out of reach, they are\nunlikely to pursue its purchase.

Although willingness-to-pay responses\nare known to overstate actual purchasing be-\nhavior, it is encouraging to note that more than\nhalf of respondents said that they would buy\nat least one of three types of health insurance\nat premiums adjusted for age and geography.\nn Plan preferences. Respondents\nstrongly preferred the $40 copayment plan\nwhen presented with the premiums for all three\noptions. This is consistent with anecdotal evi-\ndence from industry leaders that consumers\nprefer high-copayment plans to high-deduct-\nible plans. From the consumer's perspective,\npremiums paid for the high-deductible cover-\nage appear to be wasted when (as is usually\nthe case) the deductible is not reached. It is\nalso consistent with the spending patterns of\nthis sample: Only a few respondents reported\nsignificant health care use, which would ren-\nder the low-copayment (high-premium) plan\nless attractive.\nn Cost versus value. The good news is\nthat health plans that actively educate the\nnonpoor uninsured about the array of prod-\nucts and prices available in the individual\nmarket may persuade some of them to buy.\nLess encouraging is that premiums in Califor-\nnia's individual market have risen by approxi-\nmately 20 percent since the survey was con-\nducted.13 Persons will purchase insurance\nwhen they perceive that it has value commen-\nsurate with its cost. More than 40 percent of\nrespondents to this survey felt that health in-\nsurance is not a good value; this proportion\ncan only go up as prices increase. Careful at-\ntention should be paid to regulatory meas-\nures, such as benefit mandates, that may add\nsignificant cost but little value for many po-\ntential enrollees.14 The question is not\nwhether more benefits are better, but rather\nhow many people will be priced out of the\nmarket.\nn Voluntarism versus universalism.\nEven if every respondent who said that they\nwould purchase one of the products did so,\nalmost half of the sample would remain unin-\nsured. A closer look at this half reveals two\ndistinct groups. One group is quite concerned\nabout lacking coverage but is close to the in-\ncome floor of 200 percent of poverty; this\ngroup might be expected to respond to indi-\nvidually based tax incentives to lower the price\nof purchasing insurance that are currently un-\nder discussion.15 However, the majority have\nhigher incomes but are unworried and thus\nunlikely to enter the market voluntarily.16\nIf those whom society has implicitly\ndeemed financially able to participate in the\nhealth insurance market choose not to, what\nare the implications for our voluntary system\nof coverage? There has been little mention of\ncompulsory participation in our health insur-\nance system since 1994, when all flavors of\nmandates and taxes were considered in pur-\nsuit of universal coverage.17 In the reemerging\ndiscussion, attention has focused on individ-\nual rather than employer mandates to provide\nworkers with coverage.18 An individual ap-\nproach fits logically with a tax-incentive ap-\nproach and is aligned with increasing move-\nment toward individual choice and defined\ncontribution. But while the locus has shifted\nto the individual, the underlying theme from\n1994 recurs: the inherent contradiction be-\ntween voluntarism and universalism. This pa-\nper confirms that while some nonpoor unin-\nsured persons may be persuaded to purchase\ninsurance through more-effective education\nand marketing, any system that relies on indi-\nviduals to purchase insurance voluntarily will\nfall far short of universal coverage.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Cali-\nfornia HealthCare Foundation.
