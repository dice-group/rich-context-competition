Low education was defined as 6 years or less of schooling. Case-control analyses with preva-\nlent cases showed low education to be a risk for Alzheimer's disease but not dementia in general. Low education\ndid not significantly predict incident cases. In the matched-pairs analysis, which controls for genetic and other fa-\nmilial influences, differences in education between demented twins and twin partners were not statistically signif-\nicant. However, for Alzheimer's disease, odds ratios resulting from matched pairs and case-control analyses were\nsimilar. Twins' comparative reports about intellectual involvement earlier in their lives suggest a long-standing\ndifference on this dimension, with less involvement by the twin who became demented.\nHE discovery that Alzheimer's disease occurs more\nfrequently among those with low educational attain-\nment opened new questions about disease mechanisms.\nLow education is now generally included on lists of estab-\nlished risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Cummings,\nVinters, Cole, & Khachaturian, 1998). The first indications\nthat rates of dementia differed with level of education came\nfrom population studies. Prevalence of dementia was\ngreater among those with low or no education, and preva-\nlence of dementia was less among those with higher educa-\ntion. For example, in the Shanghai study (Zhang et al.,\n1990), illiteracy predicted higher rates of dementia. In the\nCanadian Study of Health and Aging (1994), those with 6 or\nfewer years of education had higher rates of Alzheimer's\ndisease than did those with 10 or more years. Other popula-\ntion studies of prevalent cases have confirmed this relation-\nship (Dartigues et al., 1991; Kokmen, Beard, O'Brien, &\nand various case-control series have replicated the observa-\ntion that low education is a significant risk factor (e.g., Mor-\nMore recently, there have been follow-ups of several\nlarge population-based samples to identify incident demen-\ntia cases, and education has again been examined as a risk\nfactor. For example, in a longitudinal follow up in East Bos-\nton, Massachusetts, Evans and colleagues (1997) reported\nthat low education was a significant predictor of incident\nAlzheimer's disease, and Nielsen, Lolk, Andersen, Ander-\nsen, and Kragh-Sorensen (1999) found low education pre-\ndicted incident Alzheimer's disease in the Odense study. In\nthe pooled EURODEM analyses of incident cases, lower\neducation was a significant risk factor, especially in women\n(Launer et al., 1999). Several authors of incidence studies\nhave reported similar findings (Ott, Van Rossum, Van Har-\nskamp, Van de Mheen, Hofman, & Breteler, 1999; Stern,\nGurland, Tatemichi, Tang, Wilder, & Mayeux, 1994; Zhang,\nOther findings imply a more complex relationship be-\ntween education and dementia. Some studies--both of prev-\nalent cases and of incident cases--have found education to\nbe a risk factor for some dementias but not all dementias. In\nthe Kungsholmen study in Sweden, Fratiglioni et al. (1991)\nfound low education to be a significant risk factor only for\nall dementias combined, but not for Alzheimer's disease\nalone. In the Framingham study, Cobb, Wolf, Au, White,\nand D'Agostino (1995) found that education was a signifi-\ncant risk factor for incidence only of dementias other than\nAlzheimer's disease, largely vascular dementia. The authors\nspeculated that the critical mechanism revolved around bad\nhealth habits associated with lower education, such as smok-\ning and poor diet, because these bad health habits would be\nrisk factors for stroke and for vascular dementias.\nSome reports have suggested that the education effect de-\npends on which levels of education are compared. For ex-\nample, in an Italian study, DeRonchi, Fratiglioni, Rucci, Pa-\nternico, Graziani, and Dalmonte (1998) found that having\nno formal education was a significant risk, but there was no\nsignificant difference in dementia or Alzheimer's disease\nprevalence when comparing those with up to 3 years of edu-\ncation with those with 3 or more years.\nOther studies--largely incidence studies or prevalence\nstudies in developing areas of the world--have found no re-\nlationship between dementia and education. In the Roches-\nter Epidemiology Project, which was based on incident\ncases identified from medical records, there was no signifi-\nT\ncant association between dementia and education when\ncomparing those with less than 9 years of education to those\nwith 9 years or more (Kokmen, Beard, O'Brien, & Kurland,\n1996). In the Indo-US study (Chandra, Ganguli, Pandav,\nJohnston, Belle, & DeKosky, 1998), there was no associa-\ntion between prevalence of dementia and illiteracy, nor did\ndementia prevalence relate to education in the Assiut-Upper\nEgypt study (Farrag, Farwiz, Khedr, Mahfouz, & Omran,\nThe conclusion across these projects is that low education\nis most relevant to predicting dementia in studies of preva-\nlent cases in populations that include people with quite low\nor no education, especially if low education is compared\nwith high education. The education effect is reduced if age\nis controlled for, is less in incidence studies than in preva-\nlence studies, and is generally less for Alzheimer's disease\nalone than for all dementias.\nThere are four views about the reason that education might\nbe related to dementia: cognitive reserve, \"use it or lose it,\"\neducation as a proxy for other exposures, and diagnostic bias.\nCognitive Reserve\nThe construct of cognitive reserve (see, e.g., Mortimer,\ncussing the education\u00addementia relationship. In this view,\ndementia is observed clinically after cognitive reserve is de-\npleted to some threshold. Less initial cognitive reserve\nwould imply that smaller changes would be required to\nbring the individual to the threshold at which impairment\nwould be evident, whereas greater cognitive reserve would\npresumably afford greater protection against dementia. In\nthis theory, cognitive reserve could reflect either innate dif-\nferences in cognitive capacities or better early brain matura-\ntion (for example, in relation to maternal and infant nutri-\ntion). In either event, educational attainment would be an\nindicator of greater cognitive reserve.\nBidzan and Ussorowska (1995) looked at unfavorable en-\nvironmental factors during childhood, such as low family\nincome, that they posited to indicate negative influences on\nearly brain development and found that these factors were\nmore prominent among groups with dementia than among\ncontrol groups. Mortimer and colleagues (Mortimer, Fort-\nier, Rajaram, & Gauvreau, 1998) found that, among adults\nwho had siblings with dementia, those who grew up in so-\ncioeconomically disadvantaged circumstances had a higher\nrisk of Alzheimer's disease themselves. More recently,\nMoceri, Kukull, Emanuel, van Belle, and Larson (2000) re-\nported that various indicators of early-life socioeconomic\nlevel (greater number of siblings, area of residence as a\nchild) were related to greater risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe cognitive-reserve line of thinking is also supported by\nfindings from the Nun study (Snowdon, Kemper, Mortimer,\nGreiner, Wekstein, & Markesbery, 1996), in which the\ncomplexity of thought in essays written in their early 20s\npredicted which nuns later developed Alzheimer's disease.\nOther research results have also supported the idea that in-\ntelligence might function as cognitive reserve (Stern, Alex-\nander, Prohovnik, & Mayeux, 1992). These authors showed\nthat, after they controlled for dementia severity, higher edu-\ncation and estimated premorbid intellectual ability were\nassociated with greater impairment on tests of cerebral me-\ntabolism. Although at first this finding might appear counter-\nintuitive, the authors' interpretation is that intelligence mod-\nerates clinical manifestation of cerebral pathology.\nA further prediction based on the cognitive reserve model\nis that the education\u00addementia relationship should be weaker\nin cultures or cohorts for whom level of education is less di-\nrectly reflective of intellectual capacities or, hence, of cogni-\ntive reserve. For example, Hall et al. (1998) found that low\neducation was a risk factor in Indianapolis, Indiana, but not in\nNigeria, and Harwood and colleagues (1999) found that low\neducation was a risk factor for Whites but not for Hispanics.\nUse It or Lose It\nSome writers have discussed the possibility that mental\nactivity throughout adulthood can increase synaptic density,\nwhether through formal educational activities or through\ncognitively challenging occupations or cognitively stimulat-\ning leisure activities (e.g., Katzman, 1993). The idea that\nhigh education might be a protective factor has also re-\nceived support from animal studies associating mental stim-\nulation with dendritic complexity (Lucassen, Van Someren,\n& Swaab, 1998) and from proposals of plausible neurobio-\nlogical mechanisms by which neuronal activation might\nslow amyloid deposition (Friedland, 1993). In a finding\nconsistent with this line of reasoning, Fabrigoule, Leten-\nneur, Dartigues, Zarrouk, Commenges, and Barberger-Gateau\n(1995) found incidence of dementia was lower among those\nwho had participated in leisure activities such as traveling\nor gardening. It is, of course, appealing to think that older\nindividuals might be able to prevent or to postpone onset of\ndementia through remaining mentally active (see Orrell &\nEducation as a Proxy\nThere has also been an interest in the possibility that edu-\ncation might be indicative of other risk factors such as occu-\npational exposures or bad health habits, for example, alco-\nhol use (Fratiglioni et al., 1991). However, DeRonchi et al.\n(1998) found a residual education effect after controlling for\nage, occupation, and smoking. Similarly, Evans and col-\nleagues (1997) found independent contributions from edu-\ncation and from low occupational prestige and low income.\nThus, whereas these other risk factors may increase odds of\ndeveloping dementia, they do not entirely explain the edu-\ncation effect.\nDiagnostic Bias\nFinally, education might serve to teach the individual the\nsorts of reasoning skills that are required by neuropsycho-\nlogical tests used in dementia assessments (Gilleard, 1997).\nHere, education is sometimes regarded as a confounding\nfactor, requiring that norms on tests be adjusted for educa-\ntion for the test to be a valid measure across different groups\nof people (Stockton, Cohen-Mansfield, & Billig, 1998).\nThis explanation of the education\u00addementia relationship re-\nceives support from the observation that those with lower\neducation tend to have lower scores on neuropsychological\ntests used in dementia assessment but not greater functional\nTwin Methods\nTwin studies provide a vehicle for helping to sort out the\nalternative mechanisms that might be involved in the asso-\nciation between education and dementia. A matched-pair\nanalysis takes twin pairs who are discordant for a disease\nand evaluates whether the twin who was exposed to a given\nrisk factor is more often the twin with the disease. This de-\nsign has the advantage of controlling for genetics, insofar as\nidentical twins share 100% of their genes and fraternal\ntwins share 50% of their segregating genes. In addition,\ncases and controls are the same with respect to age and gen-\nder (for like-sexed pairs), and they are similar with respect\nto their environmental history. We know that twins are very\nsimilar with respect to intellectual abilities, with up to 80% of\nthe variance in intellectual abilities explained by genetic effects\n(Pedersen, Plomin, Nesselroade, & McClearn, 1992). Thus,\ntwins should be similar in their baseline cognitive reserve.\nIn one twin study that has examined education and\ndementia, R\u00e4ih\u00e4, Kaprio, Koskenvuo, Rajala, & Sourander\n(1998) used twin pairs who were discordant for Alzheimer's\ndisease, determined by matching the Finnish Twin Registry\nwith a registry of diagnoses. Across 25 identical and 25 fra-\nternal pairs, higher education was related to reduced risk of\nAlzheimer's disease.\nThe key question of interest in the present study was to\ncontrast a classical case-control analysis with a matched-\npair analysis. A classical case-control approach recruits\ncases with dementia and controls without dementia from a\nsimilar population. The analysis tests relative proportions of\ncases compared with controls who experience a particular\nrisk factor, for example, low education. We hypothesized\nthat low education would be a significant risk factor in a\nclassical case-control analysis, replicating previous find-\nings, whereas in the matched-pair analysis, by controlling\nfor familial influences on intellectual ability, we would not\nfind low education to be a significant risk factor. If this hy-\npothesis is supported, it is consistent with a cognitive-reserve\ninterpretation of the education\u00addementia relationship.\nA third, more exploratory set of analyses was conducted\nto provide suggestions with respect to possible meanings of\nthe education variable. Here we drew on twins' self-reported\ncomparisons of who got better grades in school, who read\nmore books, and who found learning to be easier. If these\nvariables differed between cases and their partners, it would\nprovide evidence for early differences in intellectual in-\nvolvement. Such a pattern would be consistent with an envi-\nronmentally mediated cognitive-reserve interpretation, but\nalso with use it or lose it.\nIn these analyses, we did not directly test whether educa-\ntion relates to adult environmental exposures, and the role\nof diagnostic bias is minimized insofar as diagnoses are not\nbased directly on test results but on functional deficits as well.\nMETHODS\nSample\nParticipants in the present study include members of the\nStudy of Dementia in   (Gatz et al., 1997) and\nmembers of the OCTO-Twin study (McClearn et al., 1997).\nBoth studies represent defined subsamples of the popula-\ntion-based Swedish Twin Registry. The Study of Dementia\nin   identified dementia cases from the Swed-\nish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et\nal., 1991). SATSA includes all pairs from the twin registry\nwho indicated having been reared apart and a matched sam-\nple who were reared together. Members of SATSA have\nbeen surveyed by mail-out questionnaires every 3 years\nticipated in in-person cognitive and health assessments on a\n3-year rolling schedule. For purposes of the dementia study,\nall twins identified for the SATSA sample born in 1935 or\npreviously were included, if one or both members of the\npair were alive in 1987, whether or not they had responded\nto SATSA data collection efforts (N  1,978). Baseline\ncompleted by 1991, and incident cases were identified at\neach additional data collection.\nThe OCTO-Twin study enrolled all twin pairs 80 years\nold and older if both members of the pair were alive during\nFour subsequent waves of in-person assessment were sched-\nuled at 2-year intervals. Cases of dementia were identified\nat the first three waves.\nThe present study included all cases, both those identified\ninitially (prevalent cases) and new cases of dementia identi-\nfied longitudinally (incident cases).\nProcedures.--Case ascertainment from the SATSA sam-\nple used a two-stage process (see Gatz et al., 1997). Partici-\npants were screened for dementia using either the Mini-\nMental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, &\nMcHugh, 1975) during an in-person visit or a telephone\nscreening protocol (Gatz, Reynolds, Nikolic, Lowe, Karel,\n& Pedersen, 1995) for those not seen in person. Those scor-\ning below established cutoffs were identified as suspected\ncases of dementia and referred for evaluation by an assess-\nment team employing a nurse, a psychologist, and a physi-\ncian. The protocol parallels Consortium to Establish a Reg-\nistry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) procedures for\nphysical and neurological evaluations, laboratory tests, neu-\nropsychological testing, and neuroimaging (Morris et al.,\n1989). Findings were presented at a consensus diagnosis\nconference, attended by the clinicians and chaired by a psy-\nchologist who had not met the twin. Diagnoses were as-\nsigned following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, 3rd ed., rev. (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 1987) criteria for dementia, NINCDS/ADRDA\ncriteria for probable and possible Alzheimer's disease\n(McKhann et al., 1984), and--once available--NINDS\u00ad\nAIREN criteria for vascular dementia (Roman et al., 1993).\nTwin partners of participants were given an identical clinical\nwork-up. If the partners were deceased, their diagnostic as-\nsessment included informant interviews and review of med-\nical records, including death certificates. Cases and partners\nwere followed longitudinally every 18 months, with post-\nmortem neuropathological examination for any who died.\nAutopsy confirmation of diagnosis was available for 24 cases.\nCase ascertainment from the OCTO-Twin sample en-\ntailed a review of MMSE scores and cognitive performance\ninformation collected from all twins, whether or not de-\nmented. The battery paralleled that used with the suspected\ndementia cases from SATSA. For those suspected of de-\nmentia, informant interviews were conducted using the\nsame protocol as for the SATSA twins, medical records\nwere reviewed, and a consensus diagnosis assigned by a\nphysician and a psychologist (Boo Johansson). Boo Johans-\nson also chaired the diagnostic conferences for both samples.\nDifferences in case ascertainment between the two sam-\nples include the following: (a) SATSA twins include pairs\nreared apart as well as pairs reared together, whereas OCTO\ntwins were reared together; (b) in OCTO-Twin, both mem-\nbers of the pair had to be alive at age 80, whereas SATSA\ntwins were included if dementia status could be established\nfor both members of the pair; (c) nonresponders to OCTO-\ntwin cognitive testing were lost to dementia study, whereas\nnonresponders to SATSA data collection were telephoned\nfor dementia screening; and (d) a SATSA twin whose in-\nperson MMSE was below cutoff could refuse further work-\nup, whereas an OCTO twin whose cognitive testing was im-\npaired could be presented for consensus diagnosis. These\ndifferences could result in disparate, competing, but un-\nknown diagnostic biases across twin pairs, although few dif-\nferences that should be differential within twin pairs.\nLongitudinal follow up of both the SATSA and OCTO-\nTwin samples provided additional waves of screening and\na means to identify incident cases. One individual who\nscreened negative was found to be demented at a later wave\nand was deemed a false negative because age of onset was\nearlier than the baseline screening. This pair is not in the\nmatched-pairs analysis.\nSample for Matched-Pairs Analysis\nThe prevalent matched-pair analyses included pairs dis-\ncordant for dementia at first assessment, excluding pairs\nwhose co-twin died before the participant's age of onset.\nFor incident matched-pairs analysis, we identified a base-\nline sample of pairs in which both members of the pair were\ncognitively intact at the first data collection, either the\nscreening of the SATSA sample for dementia or the first\nwave of OCTO-Twin. Incident cases are those new cases of\ndementia from within these pairs. Pairs were defined as dis-\ncordant if one member of the pair developed dementia while\nthe other member of the pair remained intact through the\nsame duration of follow up, or longer. To assure that inci-\ndent cases were truly incident and were not false negatives\nat baseline screening, we obtained age at onset of incident\ncases without knowledge of prior screening date or out-\ncome. These ages were checked to ensure that onset oc-\ncurred subsequent to baseline screening.\nUsing these procedures, we found 143 pairs discordant\nfor dementia--77 prevalent and 66 incident. Forty-eight\npairs (62%) were discordant for prevalent Alzheimer's dis-\nease (the participant had had definite, probable, or possible\nAlzheimer's disease, whereas the partner was cognitively\nintact). The other cases were diagnosed with vascular de-\nmentia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular pathology (29%),\nsecondary dementia (4%), or dementia of uncertain etiology\n(5%). Zygosity was originally determined by a question-\nnaire and then confirmed serologically. All pairs were of the\nsame sex. Zygosity, gender, and age of onset for prevalent\nand incident cases are shown in Table 1.\nSample for Classical Case-Control Analysis\nThe classical case-control analysis compared dementia\ncases with unrelated controls. If both members of a pair\nwere demented, one was randomly included. The pool from\nwhich controls were drawn was obtained by selecting one\nmember of each twin pair in SATSA or OCTO-Twin for\nwhich both members of the pair were cognitively intact.\nTwo unrelated controls were selected for each case, match-\ning for gender and age, within 5-year agebands. Age was\nbased on age of onset for cases and age at visit for controls.\nFor these purposes, there were a total of 131 prevalent cases\nof dementia who were compared with a control sample of\n262; 77 of these cases constituted the Alzheimer's disease\nsample. We compared a total of 90 incident cases of de-\nmentia with a control sample of 180; 54 of these cases con-\nstituted the Alzheimer's disease sample. Throughout this\nprocess, all dependencies were removed from the data. Zy-\ngosity, gender, and age of onset for prevalent and incident\ncases are shown in Table 1.\nMeasures\nEducation.--Education was collected as a five-category\nvariable: (1) elementary school, meaning 6 years, (2) sec-\nondary school, (3) vocational school or adult high school,\n(4) \"gymnasium,\" and (5) university. For all of our analy-\nses, we collapsed education into two categories: elementary\nor less schooling compared with greater than elementary\nschooling. In Sweden in the early 20th century, 6 years of\neducation was mandatory, so virtually no one had less than\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of Cases\nZygosity (% MZ) Gender (% women) Diagnoses (% Alzheimer's disease)\nAge of onset\nM SD Range\nMatched pairs sample\nCase control sample\nNote: MZ  monozygotic.\n6 years of education, and the vast majority of the population\nstopped school at this point. Information about education\nwas collected for the SATSA panel from the 1984 question-\nnaire or, for those who did not answer the questionnaire,\nfrom the individual or a proxy at the time of the clinical\nworkup. For OCTO-Twin, information about education came\nfrom the 1992 interview. We also were able to fill in miss-\ning data and cross-check against information in the Swedish\ndiscordant pairs, information about education was available\nfor both members of 129 pairs.\nComparative risk.--We obtained answers to five ques-\ntions about grades in school and reading for pleasure from\nthe twins in the SATSA sample only, using a comparative\nreport format in which twins were asked, \"Before age 20,\nwho read more books or read more frequently?\" \"As an\nadult, who read more books or read more frequently?\"\n\"Who had better grades in school?\" \"Who found learning in\nschool to be easier?\" and \"Whose ability to find their way in\nunfamiliar surroundings was better?\" Response options in-\ncluded \"me,\" \"my twin,\" \"equally as much,\" and \"don't\nknow.\" This strategy, devised by Mack (Hamilton & Mack,\n2000), avoids some of the pitfalls of recall measures, as it is\neasier for siblings to remember who did something more\nthan it is to remember absolute numbers. Data were either\ncollected at the time of the dementia assessment, only from\nthe cognitively intact member of the pair, or in 1992 from\nall members of the SATSA sample, including those who\nmight later be included in the Study of Dementia in Swedish\nTwins. Information was available from 17 cases and 37\npartners. Twin pairs who were reared apart tended not to an-\nswer this questionnaire. For 12 of the cases, information\ncame from both case and partner. There were no instances\nin which the twins disagreed, for example, both saying\n\"me\" or both saying \"my twin.\" Information from cases and\npartners was therefore combined and scored for whether\ncase or control had greater exposure. In other words, if ei-\nther twin answered, the data were used. If both twins an-\nswered, the consensus answer was used. For these purposes,\nanswers of \"equally as much\" or \"don't know\" were treated\nthe same as missing data.\nAnalyses\nFor the classical case-control analysis, we estimated the\nassociation between education and disease through the odds\nratio, comparing proportion with low education in cases and\nin controls. In addition, a logistic regression model was\nused to adjust for ageband and gender. For the matched-pair\nanalysis, odds ratio estimates of relative risk were calcu-\nlated using McNemar's test, with 95% confidence intervals.\nThe odds ratio indexes the magnitude by which low educa-\ntion magnifies risk. An odds ratio near 1.0 would indicate\nthat education was not a significant risk factor.\nFor the analyses using comparative reports, the result\ntook the form of percentage of cases and percentage of part-\nners experiencing an exposure, and 95% confidence inter-\nvals were constructed around the percentage of cases. A\nfinding that significantly less than 50% of cases experi-\nenced the exposure would be evidence of a protective effect\nassociated with the activity.\nRESULTS\nClassical Case-Control Analysis\nResults are summarized in Table 2 for the odds ratios. In\nprevalent cases, low education is a significant risk for Alz-\nheimer's disease but not for all dementias. Logistic regression\nresults (in the far right column of Table 2) show that includ-\ning ageband, gender, and education in the model indicated\nno age or gender effect, but the significant effect remained for\nlow education as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease alone.\nFor incident cases, however, neither the odds ratio for all\ndementias nor for Alzheimer's disease alone was significant.\nMatched-Pair Analyses\nResults, summarized in Table 3, show that no odds ratio\nwas statistically significant. The conclusion here is that\nthere is not a significantly greater chance for the less edu-\ncated partner to have either dementia in general or to have\nAlzheimer's disease. If there is a trend in the data, it is a\ngreater effect for low education with respect to Alzheimer's\ndisease than to the combined dementia category.\nResults did not differ when examined separately by gen-\nder, rearing status, or zygosity (not included in Table 3).\nThe only suggestive difference with respect to zygosity was\nthat in the analysis of incident Alzheimer's disease, three of\nthe four pairs for whom the case had lower education were\nmonozygotic, and there were no monozygotic pairs for\nwhom the partner had lower education. Thus, it appears that\nthat inclusion of dizygotic pairs was not the explanation for\nthe larger than expected odds ratios for Alzheimer's disease.\nTable 2.

If the confidence interval does not include 1.0, then the risk factor is significant.\nTwins' Comparative Reports of Intellectual Involvement\nThe comparative risk results provided in Table 4 showed\na pattern suggesting that the twin who later became de-\nmented had less intellectual involvement earlier in life.\nThere were statistically significant differences with respect\nto reading fewer books as an adult and finding one's way in\nunfamiliar surroundings less well. There were no significant\ndifferences with respect to grades or ease of learning.\nDISCUSSION\nAnalyses were conducted to test the prediction that low\neducation would be a significant risk factor for dementia us-\ning a classical case-control design, whereas a matched-pairs\nanalysis would not find low education to be a significant\nrisk factor. The basis for such a prediction is the assumption\nthat educational attainment largely reflects cognitive re-\nserve, in particular, genetic influences on cognitive abilities.\nThis prediction, however, received equivocal support. Our\nability to resolve alternative explanations of the meaning of\nlow education was, in turn, limited by restricted power that\nessentially reflected twin similarity in cognitive reserve.\nThe findings from the prevalent, or cross-sectional, case-\ncontrol analyses comport with the conclusion from many\nprevious studies that low education is a risk factor for de-\nmentia, whereas higher education is associated with protec-\ntion. Some previous reports have suggested that the educa-\ntion effect is more pronounced for all dementias or for\ndementias other than Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Cobb et al.,\n1995). This was not found in our material, in which results\nwere significant only for Alzheimer's disease considered\nalone and not for all dementias. Consistent with Kokmen\nnot with Launer and colleagues (1999), low education was\nnot a significant risk factor when incident cases of Alz-\nheimer's disease or all dementias were considered. How-\never, we observed similar odds ratios for prevalent and inci-\ndent Alzheimer's disease, and differences in confidence\nintervals in part reflect sample size.\nIn our material, the 2.22 odds ratio for prevalent Alz-\nheimer's disease was statistically significant but smaller\nthan has been observed in other studies. For example, an\nodds ratio of 4.00 was reported for a Canadian sample (Ca-\nnadian Study of Health and Aging, 1994), an odds ratio of\n3.49 for a sample from Indianapolis, Indiana (Hall et al.,\n(DeRonchi et al., 1998). Of these, only the Canadian sample\nhad a larger number of cases than the Swedish sample. The\ndifference may reflect rather small amount of variability in\neducation among Swedish adults born before 1925. Also,\nthe country was at that time very poor economically, and\nthese social circumstances meant that few were allowed to\nobtain an education that might correspond with their intel-\nlectual abilities. Although speculative, this outcome is com-\npatible with the cognitive reserve model, which would predict\na weaker education\u00addementia relationship in a population\nor cohort in which education was less directly reflective of\nintellectual capacities.\nThe comparison built into this study is between these\ncase-control results and the matched-pairs analyses. Matched-\npairs analyses control for genetic and other familial influ-\nences. As predicted, we found that education was not signif-\nicantly different in cases compared with their twin partners.\nFor all dementias, the odds ratio for both prevalent and inci-\nTable 3.

If the confidence interval does not include 1.0, then the risk factor is significant.\nTable 4.

For prevalent cases of Alzhei-\nmer's disease, however, the proportion of cases with low\neducation was greater than the proportion of partners with\nlow education, with about the same point estimate for the\nodds ratio as was found for the case-control design. The\nodds ratio was not significant because of a lack of statistical\npower. In other words, in the few pairs in which there was a\ndifference in attained education, the matched-pairs results\nsuggest an effect of education that is not explained by ge-\nnetic or shared environmental influences.\nFrom our previous work with the Swedish twin samples,\nwe know that twins are highly similar on a composite of\ncognitive abilities, and that this similarity reflects a large\nproportion of genetic influences (Pedersen et al., 1992). We\nhave previously reported in a larger sample of nondemented\ntwins that the correlation between education and MMSE\nscores can be best explained by common genetic factors\nshared with cognitive abilities, and that, in turn, these ge-\nnetic factors also explain the correlation between cognitive\nabilities and education and MMSE scores (Pedersen, Rey-\nnolds, & Gatz, 1996). However, for women, there was\ngreater environmental than genetic mediation of the MMSE\u00ad\neducation correlation. This observation and the results from\nthe present study point to nongenetic as well as genetic con-\ntributors to cognitive reserve.\nThere has been one prior report of education as a risk fac-\ntor for Alzheimer's disease in a twin sample. Results from\nthe present study appear comparable to those previously re-\nported by R\u00e4ih\u00e4 and colleagues (1998) from the Finnish\nTwin Registry. In the Finnish study, there are unknown se-\nlection effects, as information about education was obtained\nfrom only two-thirds of the discordant pairs and cases were\nascertained only by record linkage, which is likely to miss\nup to half of cases (Gatz & Pedersen, 1996). There were\nmore pairs in the Swedish sample, but less discordance for\neducation.\nThe comparative-risk findings in the present study lead to\nthe interpretation that differences in intellectual involve-\nment already present earlier in life are important for demen-\ntia. These findings are consistent with the Nun study\n(Snowdon et al., 1996), in which differences in linguistic\ncomplexity were obvious earlier in life between those who\nlater became demented and those who did not. Our results\ncannot rule out the idea that lifelong intellectual engage-\nment--use it or lose it--can make a difference. We would,\nhowever, hazard that those individuals already higher in\ncognitive reserve may also be more likely to engage intel-\nlectually. Thus, if there are two processes, they may work in\ntandem, and cognitive reserve might be viewed as a joint\nand probably interacting function of both genetic and envi-\nronmental influences.\nKey limitations to this study are the small number of\npairs discordant for education and the limited amount of\nvariability on education. It has previously been reported that\ntwin pairs in SATSA tend to be similar for education (Lich-\ntenstein, Pedersen, & McClearn, 1992). In the sample in the\npresent study, pairs were highly alike for education (tetra-\nchoric correlation  .71). Those pairs who were dissimilar\nfor education did not differ from other pairs with respect to\nwhether they were reared together or apart. In addition, 74%\nhad low education, making it quite probable that any two in-\ndividuals would be comparable for education. The matched-\npairs analyses were based on the pairs discordant for both\neducation and disease. Thus, the great similarity for educa-\ntion reduced the number of pairs available for comparison.\nAlthough the odds ratio was not affected, confidence inter-\nvals became large.\nIn addition, these matched pairs could be regarded as\n\"overmatched,\" as twin pairs are similar on many other\nvariables, for example, choice of occupation. Thus, the\nmatched-pair design may be overcontrolling for other vari-\nables for which education is a proxy.\nAdditionally, the discordant pairs included both monozy-\ngotic and dizygotic pairs; thus, genetic effects were imper-\nfectly controlled for. There were not a sufficient number of\nmonozygotic pairs for an analysis based on them alone. For\nthe matched-pair design, there must be twin pairs discordant\nfor both the disease and the exposure of interest. In the prev-\nalent sample, for example, there was only one monozygotic\npair discordant for both Alzheimer's disease and education.\nFor this reason, it should be emphasized that the matched-\npair design controls for familial effects, including some ge-\nnetic and some shared rearing influences.\nThe comparative-risk analyses have the same sample size\nconsiderations as the matched-pairs analyses. In addition,\nthere could be concern about retrospective bias, in which\ntwins would tend to avoid attributing an unfavorable quality\nto themselves, or in which cognitively intact twins would\ntend to attribute negative intellectual qualities to the mem-\nber of the pair who became demented. We were able to de-\ntermine within this sample that, if both members of the pair\ndid reply to the questionnaire, they did not disagree on these\nitems. The data included some questionnaires that were\ncompleted before onset of dementia in either twin; unfortu-\nnately, not all of the data were prospective. Moreover, the\nitems that did significantly discriminate were, if anything,\nless loaded with social desirability than the items that did\nnot discriminate.\nIn conclusion, in applying a case-control design with un-\nrelated controls, the results provided a replication of low ed-\nucation as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but not for\nall dementias. A matched pairs design that controls for fa-\nmilial effects, including genetically mediated characteris-\ntics, showed similar estimates of risk, but these were non-\nsignificant because of lack of power. The lack of power\nstemmed from high heritability of cognitive abilities and\nhigh similarity of educational attainment in twin pairs, with\nsimilarity of educational attainment to a great extent reflect-\ning similarity in cognitive abilities. In the few pairs discor-\ndant for education, there was a nonsignificant tendency for\ntwins with Alzheimer's disease to have less education than\ntheir cognitively intact partners. The comparative twin find-\nings also suggest that intellectual involvement contributes\nto cognitive reserve. Taken together, these findings support\nthreshold theories that emphasize the relevance of cognitive\nreserve as protecting from dementia.\n"
