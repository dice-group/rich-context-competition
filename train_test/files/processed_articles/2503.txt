Medi-\ncation use was defined as the use of a prescription or non-\nprescription medication or dietary supplement at least\ndaily or weekly. Micromedex was used to determine drug\ninteractions with alcohol and their corresponding severity.\nRESULTS: One thousand one hundred six (41%) of the\nparticipants consumed alcohol regularly, and 567 (20%)\nwere at-risk for a drug\u00adalcohol interaction because they\nwere regular drinkers and concurrently using alcohol-inter-\nacting medications. More than 90% of these interactions\nwere of moderate or major severity. Antidepressants and\nanalgesics were the most commonly used alcohol-interact-\ning medications in regular drinkers. Older adult men with\nmultiple chronic conditions had the highest prevalence of\npotential drug\u00adalcohol interactions.\nCONCLUSION: The potential for drug\u00adalcohol interac-\ntions in the older U.S. adult population may have impor-\ntant clinical implications. Efforts to better understand and\nprevent the use of alcohol-interacting medications by regu-\nlar drinkers, particularly heavy drinkers, are warranted in\nKey words: aging; prescription drug abuse and misuse\nThe vast majority of older adults in the United States\nuse prescription and nonprescription medications,1\nand more than 50% drink alcohol regularly.2 Older adults\nare also more likely than younger adults to suffer from\nchronic conditions and to experience the adverse effects of\nmedications3 and alcohol use.4 Many medications that\nolder adults commonly use, such as analgesics, sedatives,\nand antidepressants, interact with alcohol and further\nincrease the risk of adverse drug events, including falls,\nautomobile crashes, and death.5,6 Older adults who drink\nalcohol regularly are more likely than those who do not to\nbe admitted for an adverse drug event,4 with more than\n25% of emergency department admissions associated with\na drug\u00adalcohol interactions.7 Despite this, nationally repre-\nsentative information on the prevalence of drug\u00adalcohol\ninteractions in the U.S. older adult population is limited.\nPrevious studies examining drug\u00adalcohol interactions in\nthe United States have not focused on older adults and have\nbeen limited to prescription medications.8,9 A study con-\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\nreports that approximately 13.5% of adults aged 20 and\nolder were using an alcohol-interacting prescription medica-\ntion, of whom 6% were at high risk of an alcohol-related\nadverse event.8 a study derived from pharmacy claims and\nsurvey data in low-income beneficiaries of the Pennsylvania\nPharmaceutical Assistance Program reported that 20% of\nadults aged 65 and older were at risk of drug\u00adalcohol inter-\nactions,9 but that study was not nationally representative\nand excluded information on nonprescription medications.\nThe current study used data from the National, Social\nlife, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-\nbased survey of community-dwelling older U.S. adults. The\nprimary objective was to examine the prevalence of drug\u00ad\nalcohol interactions in older adults in the United States\noverall and according to therapeutic class of prescription\nand nonprescription medications and to identify older\nadult individuals most at risk of such use.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nThe NSHAP is a nationally representative probability sam-\nple of community-dwelling persons aged 57 to 84 (at the\nFrom the *Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes, and Policy,\nCollege of Pharmacy; and Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics,\nSchool of Public Health, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois.\nAddress correspondence to Dima Mazen Qato, University of Illinois--\nPharmacy Systems, Outcomes, and Policy, 833 South Wood Street,\nChicago, IL 60612.

Blacks, Hispanics, men, and the oldest persons\n(75\u00ad84 at the time of screening) were oversampled. Of\nyielding an unweighted response rate of 74.8% and a\nweighted response rate of 75.5%. Professional interviewers\nconducted in-home interviews and compiled medication\nlogs in English and Spanish between July 2005 and March\n2006. The National Institutes of Health sponsors NSHAP,\nand the study protocol has been previously described.1 The\nUniversity of Chicago and National Opinion Research\nCenter institutional review boards approved the NSHAP\nprotocol, and all respondents provided written informed\nconsent.\nData\nData on medication use were collected during the house-\nhold interview by direct observation of medication bottles\nusing a computer-based log. Participants were asked to\nprovide the interviewer with all medications used \"on a\nregular schedule, like every day or every week\" and were\ninstructed to include \"prescription and nonprescription\nmedications, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and\nherbal and alternative medicines.\" All identifiable drug\nnames for prescription and over-the-counter medications\nand dietary supplements were coded. Additional details on\nthe method of drug coding have been previously\nA drug information database (Thomson Micromedex;\nTruven Health Analytics, Denver, CO) was used to iden-\ntify alcohol-interacting medications and to provide a mea-\nsure of the severity of the interaction (contraindicated--the\ndrugs are contraindicated for use; major--the interaction\nmay be life threatening or require medical intervention to\nminimize or prevent serious adverse events; moderate--the\ninteraction may result in the exacerbation of the individ-\nual's condition or require an alternative therapy; minor--\nthe interaction has limited clinical effects).\nDrinking characteristics were defined based on\nresponses to a series of questions: \"Do you ever drink any\nalcohol beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor?\" \"In the\npast three months, on average, how many days per week\nhave you had any alcohol to drink (for example, beer,\nwine, or liquor)?\" and \"How many drinks do you have on\nthe days that you drink?\" Nonregular drinkers were\nrespondents who did not drink alcohol or drank less than\n1 day per week. Regular drinkers were respondents who\ndrank at least 1 day per week. Regular drinkers were fur-\nther characterized into three categories based on the fre-\nquency of drinking on drinking days: light drinkers\n(1 drink/d), heavy drinkers (2\u00ad3 drinks/d), and binge drin-\nkers (4 drinks/d). These definitions have been previously\nused to define drinking behavior in older adults.2,4 respon-\ndents with the potential for a drug\u00adalcohol interaction\nwere defined as those who were regular drinkers and using\nat least one alcohol-interacting medication with any level\nof interaction severity.\nold at the time of interview had turned 85.) Race and eth-\nnicity were defined as white, black, Hispanic non-black,\nand other. Level of education was defined as less than high\nschool education, high school graduate or GED comple-\ntion, some college or vocational education (associate\ndegree included), and a bachelor's degree or higher. Lastly,\nincome was divided into four categories by asking,\n\"Approximately what was the income of your household\nlast year [this year minus one] before taxes or deductions\nHealthcare and health-related factors were also impor-\ntant considerations. Information about insurance status\nwas ascertained by asking, \"Are you currently covered by\nany of the following health insurance programs (Medicare,\nMedicaid, private insurance, Veterans Administration, or\nother)?\" Participants who did not report being covered by\nany of these programs (including other) were considered to\nhave no insurance.\nA measure of self-reported health was included\nwhereby respondents had to qualify their physical health\ninto a standard 5-point scale (poor, fair, good, very good,\nexcellent). A measure of comorbidity was included because\nconcurrent health conditions can affect drug\u00adalcohol inter-\nactions. A comorbidity index was calculated based on a\npreviously validated algorithm used in questionnaire and\nsurvey research11 in response to whether they had had a\nmyocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular\ndisease, peptic ulcer disease or stomach ulcers, arthritis,\nemphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\nstroke, diabetes mellitus, dementia or Alzheimer's disease,\ncirrhosis, leukemia, lymphoma, poor kidney function, or\ncancer.\nAnalysis\nWeights included in the National, Social life, Health and\nAging Project (NSHAP) data set were used for each analy-\nsis to adjust for oversampling, differential probability of\nselection, and differential nonresponse.12 Descriptive statis-\ntics were used to estimate the prevalence of drug\u00adalcohol\ninteractions (overall and according to drinking frequency)\nin the entire sample and stratified according to age and\nsex. The chi-square statistic was used to test statistical sig-\nnificance at the .05 level. Logistic regression was used to\nassess which variables were significantly (P < .05) associ-\nated with a potential drug\u00adalcohol interaction. All analyses\nwere performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.,\nCary, NC).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents older adult sociodemographic and health\ncharacteristics overall and according to drinking status. In\nof alcohol (1 drinks/wk). The prevalence of regular drink-\ning was more common in older adult men, participants\naged 57 to 64, and white participants and those with\nhigher income, more education, and excellent self-reported\nhealth. Older adults who were regular drinkers were sig-\nnificantly (P < .001) less likely to use alcohol-interacting\nmedications. Seventeen percent of older adults were light\ndrinkers (1 drinks/d), 20% were moderate drinkers (2\u00ad\n3 drinks/d), and less than 5% were heavy or binge drin-\nkers (4 drinks/d). Women of all ages were significantly\n(P < .001) less likely to drink alcohol regularly than men,\nand of those who drank, women of all ages were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be light drinkers (Appendix S1).\nRespondents in the sample used 76 of the 165 alco-\nhol-interacting medications identified in Micromedex.\nWhereas 57.7% of older U.S. adults use at least one alco-\nhol-interacting medication, approximately 21% (95% con-\ninteraction (regular drinkers who concurrently use at least\none alcohol-interacting medication). The prevalence of\npotential drug\u00adalcohol interactions increased with age for\nmen, but not women, and was highest in in the oldest men\n(75\u00ad84). The prevalence of any drug\u00adalcohol interaction\nwas higher in men than women of all age groups.\nFigure 1 depicts the prevalence of multiple (2) drug\u00ad\nalcohol interactions according to age and sex. Approxi-\nmately 8.3% of respondents reported the concurrent use of\ntwo or more alcohol-interacting medications with regular\nTable 1.

Potential\ndrug\u00adalcohol interactions were significantly more likely in\nmen (P < .001), non-Hispanic white respondents (P = .01),\nwealthier respondents (P < .001), and those with greater\nformal education P < .001). Individuals with greater comor-\nbidity were also significantly more likely to experience a\npotential drug\u00adalcohol interaction.\nOverall, drug\u00adalcohol interactions were most common\nin older adults reporting a diagnosis of liver disease; 35%\nwere regular drinkers concurrently using at least one alco-\nhol-interacting medication. Aspirin and aspirin-containing\nanalgesics were the most commonly used alcohol-interact-\ning medication in all health conditions, with the exception\nof metformin, which was more common in older adults\nwith diabetes mellitus. Men of all age groups with diabetes\nor hypertension were significantly (P < .001) more likely\nthan women to experience a drug\u00adalcohol interaction\n(Appendix S2).\nFour percent of older adults were potentially at risk of\na drug\u00adalcohol interaction of major severity, 19% of mod-\nerate severity, and 3% of minor severity, and fewer than\n1% of individuals were using contraindicated alcohol-\ninteracting medications concurrently with regular drinking\n(Table 3). More than half of potential drug\u00adalcohol inter-\nactions involved the use of alcohol-interacting analgesics\nwith major (2.7%) or moderate (11%) severity such as\naspirin, acetaminophen, and narcotics concurrently with\nalcohol. In addition, 7% of older adults are regular\ndrinkers and concurrently using alcohol-interacting\npsychotropic medications such as antidepressants, anxi-\nolytics, and sedatives.\nThere were significant sex differences in the types of\nalcohol-interacting medications used among older adults.\nPrevalence of a major drug\u00adalcohol interaction with antidi-\nabetic agents and analgesics was significantly greater in\nmen than women aged 57 to 64. Although potential drug\u00ad\nalcohol interactions with psychotropic medications were\nmore common in women than men aged 57\u00ad64, the use of\nanxiolytics and sedatives was equally common in men and\nwomen of all age groups. With the exception of men aged\n65 to 74, women more frequently used antidepressants in\ncombination with regular alcohol consumption.\nAs expected, the types of medications most commonly\ncombined with regular drinking varied between age groups\nfor men and women. For example, men in the oldest age\ngroup (75\u00ad84) were significantly more likely to drink regu-\nlarly and concurrently use analgesics and psychotropic\nmedications than men aged 57 to 64, who were more\nlikely to use antidiabetic agents in combination with alco-\nhol. Women aged 57 to 64 were more likely to use psy-\nchotropic medications, whereas women in the oldest age\ngroup were more likely to use aspirin in combination with\nalcohol.\nTable 4 presents the weighted prevalence of drug\u00ad\nalcohol interactions according to drinking status and\nfrequency. Regular drinkers were significantly (P < .05)\nless likely to use alcohol-interacting narcotic analgesics\nmellitus medications (8.4% vs 18.0%), and psychotropic\n(4 drinks/d) were significantly less likely to use alcohol-\ninteracting psychotropic medications (13.0%) than light\npersisted in multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex,\nrace and ethnicity, and education.\nDISCUSSION\nTo the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to\nuse a nationally representative, population-based sample of\nolder U.S. adults to examine the concurrent use of medica-\ntions and alcohol. The analyses indicate that one in five\nolder U.S. adults are potentially at risk for a drug\u00adalcohol\ninteraction, particularly men aged 75 to 85, and more than\nhalf of these interactions involved nonprescription medica-\ntions, specifically aspirin. Nearly one in 10 older adults\nwere using multiple alcohol-interacting medications and\nwere regularly drinking alcohol. Thus, efforts to avoid the\npotential for drug\u00adalcohol interactions in older adults are\nwarranted, especially considering evidence that older\nadults who drink alcohol regularly are more likely to be\nadmitted for an adverse drug event4 and that more than\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLight Drinking Moderate Drinking Heavy Drinking\nA\nB\nFigure 1.

This is not surprising, considering that the prior\nstudy excluded nonprescription medications and that the\nuse of prescription and nonprescription medications,\nincluding alcohol-interacting medications, increases with\nage.1 The higher prevalence of drug\u00adalcohol interactions\nmay also be related to the increasing prevalence of\nunhealthy drinking in older U.S. adults.2 Although the\nfindings are similar to those reported previously,8\ndifferences in data source and definitions of alcohol-inter-\nacting medications limit comparability.\nThe current findings suggest that efforts to improve\nthe safe use of medications in older adults should focus on\nincreasing awareness of the health risks associated with\nthe use of specific medications concurrently with alcohol,\nparticularly in regular, heavy (or binge) drinkers. Although\ndrinking is common in older adults, increasing awareness\nto facilitate more-informed decisions about drinking\nbehavior and medication use is especially important con-\nsidering the increasingly unhealthy drinking patterns iden-\ntified in older U.S. adults.13\nThe use of alcohol-interacting nonprescription medica-\ntions is particularly noteworthy.

For example,\n11% of older adults in the United States were regularly\nusing aspirin concurrently with alcohol, 3% were using\nvitamins, and 2% were using acetaminophen. These medi-\ncations are available without a prescription, and physicians\noften do not ask patients about their use of over-the-coun-\nter medications and dietary supplements.14 Therefore, peo-\nple may not be aware of the potential harmful interaction\neffects with alcohol.\nThese findings indicate that the risk of drug\u00adalcohol\ninteractions increases with age, particularly for men, and is\nhighest in men aged 75 to 85. Older adults with multiple\nchronic conditions, particularly those with liver disease,\nhypertension, diabetes mellitus, and depression, have the\nhighest prevalence of drug\u00adalcohol interactions. To avoid\npotentially harmful drug\u00adalcohol interactions in these\nat-risk chronically ill subpopulations, providers should reg-\nularly ask patients about their drinking behavior and medi-\ncation use.\nSeveral medications commonly used in the older adult\npopulation were also found to be major contributors to\ndrug\u00adalcohol interactions, for example, analgesics such as\nacetaminophen and hydrocodone, antihistamines (e.g.,\ndiphenhydramine) for sleep and allergies, aspirin for car-\ndiovascular prevention, glyburide and metformin for dia-\nbetes mellitus, and benzodiazepines as sedatives. Providers\nmay consider substituting non-alcohol-interacting medica-\ntions with similar therapeutic indications for alcohol-inter-\nacting medications in at-risk individuals. Although this\nmay be possible for some medications (e.g., antihista-\nmines), it may not be feasible for others (e.g., metformin).\nProviders may also consider reducing prescriptions for\nalcohol-interacting medications in individuals most at risk,\nsuch as those with liver and kidney disease.\nAlthough the current findings focused on the preva-\nlence and patterns of drug\u00adalcohol interactions in older\nU.S. adults, the use of alcohol-interacting medications, par-\nticularly analgesics and diabetes mellitus and psychotropic\nmedications, was significantly lower in regular drinkers.\nRegular drinkers who report heavy or binge drinking are\nless likely to use a series of alcohol-interacting medica-\ntions, compared to other regular drinkers. These findings\nsuggest that physicians may be asking their patients about\ntheir drinking behavior and customizing their prescribing\npractices accordingly. This is reassuring considering prior\nevidence that physicians often do not counsel patients on\nmedication interactions with alcohol.5,15\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. The potential for drug\u00ad\nalcohol interactions and not actual interactions were exam-\nined. Also, many factors influence adverse drug effects of\nalcohol consumption (e.g., liver function, dose, type of\ninteraction, timing of dose). Micromedex drug-interaction\nsoftware was used to identify potential interactions. Multi-\nple data sources are used in clinical settings to identify drug\ninteractions with varying definitions. For example, several\ndata sources include statins and ibuprofen as alcohol-inter-\nacting medications, whereas Micromedex does not. In addi-\ntion, Micromedex identifies some medications as alcohol\nTable 4.

Therefore, the\ncurrent findings may over- or underestimate the preva-\nlence of specific types of drug\u00adalcohol interactions. The\nfindings may also overestimate the potential for harm\nfrom drug\u00adalcohol interactions because this estimate was\nderived based on regular drinkers (1 drinks/wk), and the\ntiming of medication use was not incorporated. To better\nestimate the magnitude of this problem, estimates of\ndrug\u00adalcohol interactions based on drinking frequency are\nalso provided (see Appendix S3).\nCONCLUSION\nThe concurrent use of medications with alcohol in older\nU.S. adults is an important yet underrecognized public\nhealth problem. The potential for drug\u00adalcohol interac-\ntions in older U.S. adults is significant and has important\nclinical implications, particularly for the oldest adults and\nchronically ill individuals. Strategies to better monitor and\nprevent the use of alcohol-interacting medications in regu-\nlar drinkers are warranted in this population.\n"
