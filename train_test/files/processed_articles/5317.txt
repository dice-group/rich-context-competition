    "abstract": "Abstract. Saccadic eye-movements to a visual target are less accurate if there are distracters close\nto its location (local distracters). The addition of more distracters, remote from the target location\n(remote distracters), invokes an involuntary increase in the response latency of the saccade and\nattenuates the effect of local distracters on accuracy. This may be due to the target and distracters\ndirectly competing (direct route) or to the remote distracters acting to impair the ability to disengage\nfrom fixation (indirect route). To distinguish between these, we examined the development of saccade\ncompetition by recording saccade latency and accuracy responses made to a target and local\ndistracter compared with those made with an addition of a remote distracter. The direct route would\npredict that the remote distracter impacts on the developing competition between target and local\ndistracter, while the indirect route would predict no change as the accuracy benefit here derives from\naccessing the same competitive process but at a later stage. We found that the presence of the\nremote distracter did not change the pattern of accuracy improvement. This suggests that the remote\ndistracter was acting along an indirect route that inhibits disengagement from fixation, slows saccade\ninitiation, and enables more accurate saccades to be made.\n",

The selection of the next target for our saccadic eye movements is the\noutcome of a competition between different potential visual targets (Allport 1993; Desimone\nThompson 1999). The development of this competition can be shown through a modulation\nof saccade response time and landing position when other, distracting, stimuli must be\ninhibited: changes in when and where the eyes are directed reveals the state of the underlying\nneural competition at the time of saccade initiation (Findlay 1982; Findlay and Walker\nSaccades with shorter latencies are less accurate than those with longer latencies. This can\nbe seen within the natural variations in latencies over the course of an experiment (Chou et\nCo\u00ebff\u00e9 and O'Regan 1987; Ottes et al 1985) or when latencies are lengthened involuntarily by\nthe presence of a remote distracter (McSorley and Findlay 2003).\nIn the latter case, Cruickshank and McSorley (2009) (also McSorley and Findlay 2003)\nshowed that presence of a distracter close to the target (here called a local distracter), which\nwould normally adversely affect saccade accuracy, has less of an influence on saccades to\ntarget in the presence of a distracter farther from the target (here called a remote distracter).\nWe suggested that the remote distracter increases activity at fixation, thereby inhibiting\nthe initiation of the saccade (known as the remote distracter effect) (Walker et al 1995,\n74 E McSorley, A G Cruickshank\n1997). This followed the findings of Walker et al (1997) who showed that the extent of saccade\nlatency increase depended upon the relative distance of the remote distracter and target from\nfixation, and not the direct distance of remote distracter from the target. An improvement in\nsaccade accuracy could be explained as a consequence of the increase in latency allowing\nthe competition that dictates the saccade landing position to be more fully developed (called\nhere an `indirect' route). An alternative hypothesis is that the remote distracter acts through\nsome more `direct' route, eg by impacting directly on activation within the competitive\nprocess by which the saccade target is selected thus leading to an improvement in accuracy.\nCertainly, it has been shown that a remote distracter reduces activity in SC at the target site\nthrough direct inhibitory interactions between the target and remote distracter locations,\nleading to an increase in saccade latency (Dorris et al 2007; Olivier et al 1999).\nThese different (indirect and direct) explanations for the effect of remote distracter on\nsaccade accuracy predict differences in the temporal development of the underlying saccade\ncompetition when a remote distracter is added to a display containing a target and local\ndistracter. For the indirect route the temporal development of the competition between\nthe target and local distracter should be the same regardless of the presence of the remote\ndistracter. Remote distracter presence would increase activity at fixation but not influence\nthe slope of the developing competition. For the direct route, activity at the target and local\ndistracter site will be affected by the presence of the remote distracter. This would predict an\nimpact on accuracy of the saccade and on its temporal development.\nHere we examine these different predictions by taking advantage of a fixation gap\nparadigm (Ross and Ross 1980; Saslow 1967) which involuntarily induces changes in\nthe latency of saccades (speeds or slows eye movement responses) and is known to be\nallows us to examine the change in accuracy of target driven saccades in the presence of\neither a single local distracter or both a local and a remote distracter over a wide range of\nsaccade latencies.\nEight naive observers participated in the experiment. Observers ranged in age from 19 to 21\nyears. All observers had normal, or corrected to normal, vision. Local ethical approval was\nobtained for this study, which was conducted in accordance with the standards described\nin the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their informed consent prior to\ninclusion.\n2.2 Apparatus and materials\nStimuli were vertically oriented Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of two (target) or\nfour (distracter) cycles per degree (cpd), with a standard deviation of 0.3 deg and a mean\nluminance of 23 cd/m2. All stimuli were presented on a grey background also with a mean\nluminance of 23 cd/m2. Eye movements were recorded using a head-mounted, video-based,\neye-tracker with a sampling rate of 500 Hz (Eyelink II, SR Research), recording monocularly\nfrom observers' right eyes. Stimuli were presented in greyscale on a 21\" colour monitor\nwith a refresh rate of 75 Hz (DiamondPro, Sony). The stimulus presentation was handled by\nin-house software developed from example code provided by SR Research. Head movements\nwere constrained with a chin-rest, which held the participant so that their eyes were in line\nwith the horizontal meridian of the screen, at a viewing distance of 1 m. The eye-tracker\nwas calibrated using a standard 9 point grid, carried out at the beginning of the experiment\nand after any breaks where the observer removed their head from the rest or removed the\neye-tracker. Calibration was accepted only once there was an overall difference of less than\nInhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 75\n0.5 deg between the initial calibration and a validation retest; in the event of a failure to\nvalidate, calibration was repeated.\nStimuli were presented 8 deg of visual angle from fixation at an angular offset of 10 deg (see\nfigure 1 for an example with targets shown to the right of fixation). A target and distracter\nwere always present in one of two possible locations: 10 deg above horizontal or 10 deg\nbelow (eg if the target appeared above then the distracter was in the down position and vice\nversa). In the opposite hemifield a single remote distracter was present on half of the trials.\nThis appeared on the horizontal meridian, 4 deg from fixation. Distracters and target stimuli\nappeared simultaneously. For half of the observers (four) the target appeared only on the\nleft while the remaining half saw targets only on the right. The fixation spot was removed\nfrom the display either before (gap, denoted by negative numbers) or after (overlap) target\nonset. For each SOA there were 4 conditions: 2 possible target/distracter positions (10 deg\nabove or below the horizontal meridian) and 2 possible remote distracter states (absent or\npresent). Observers completed 2 blocks of 80 trials, producing a total of 160 trials (10 trials\nper condition) each.\nFigure 1. Targets were restricted to appear on the right or left hand side of the screen for two separate\ngroups of four observers. In the example display shown, the target appears on the right, 10 deg of\nvisual angle from fixation, at an angular offset of 10 deg above or below the horizontal meridian. A\ndistracter, local to the target, also appears on the right in the mirror-opposite place to the target across\nthe horizontal meridian. In 50% of trials a further, remote, distracter will appear to the left of fixation,\non the horizontal meridian 10 deg of visual angle from fixation.\nObservers were familiarised with the target and distracter stimuli. Following this an introduc-\ntory block of up to 20 trials was presented to introduce observers to the timing and spatial\nconfiguration of the experimental trials. Observers were instructed to move their eyes `as\nquickly and accurately as possible' to the target Gabor patch, ignoring distracters. Trials\nbegan with a central fixation cross (+) subtending 0.5 deg of visual angle, presented for a\nvarying duration of between 800 and 1300 ms. Gap trials included a blank screen, shown for\neither 150 ms or 75 ms, after offset of the fixation cross; overlap trials had no blank screen.\nThis was followed by the onset of the stimuli which were displayed for 1 s. In gap trials no\nfixation cross was present with the stimuli; in overlap trials the first 75 ms or 150 ms of stimuli\nalso included the fixation cross, thereafter none. Finally, a blank screen was shown for 500\n76 E McSorley, A G Cruickshank\nms, followed by the reappearance of the fixation cross. Once the observers eyes were fixated\n(within \u00b10.5 deg of visual angle from fixation) the next trial commenced.\nA parser integral to the eye-tracking software was used to identify saccade start and endpoints\nusing a 22 deg s-1 velocity and 8000 deg s-2 acceleration criteria (SR Research Ltd). Further\nanalysis was undertaken using in-house software developed in Matlab (Mathworks Inc.).\nSaccade amplitude, latency, and overall direction were derived from the eye movement\nrecords for the first saccade in each trial. Amplitude was defined as the horizontal component\nof the distance between eye start and end point (in degrees of visual angle). Saccade latency\nis the interval between the onset of the target and the initiation of the saccade (in ms).\nDirection was defined as the angular deviation of saccade direction taken from the initial\nfixation location to final endpoint in polar coordinates. Saccade accuracy was defined as the\nangular deviation between the target and saccade landing position eg a value of zero shows a\nsaccade landing at the centre of the target, while 10 deg shows a saccade landing toward the\ndistracter position. Saccades were excluded from further analysis if their amplitudes were\nless than two degrees (1.5%), latencies were less than 50 ms or greater then 500 ms (classed\nas not being a reaction to the appearance of the stimuli, 0.01%), or a blink occurred during\nFigure 2 shows mean saccade latency for each SOA, collapsed across subjects, dependent\nupon contralateral distracter presence. A two-factor ANOVA (SOA by distracter) showed a\nmonotonic increase in saccade latency as SOA turns from a gap to an overlap between fixation\nand stimuli onset [main effect of SOA: F3,21 = 34.4,p<0.01]. While maintaining this pattern\nFigure 2. Saccade latency (ms) is shown as a function of fixation marker stimulus onset asynchrony\n(SOA) (ms). Saccade latency was found to increase as the SOA of the fixation marker changed from a\ngap (-150 and -75) to overlap (75 and 150). This gap effect pattern was the same regardless of remote\ndistracter presence. Remote distracter presence induced an overall slowing of saccade latency showing\na similar remote distracter effect regardless of SOA. Repeated measures error bars are shown (Loftus\nInhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 77\n(ie no interaction: F<1), saccade latency increased further when the contralateral distracter\nwas present compared with its absence [main effect of distracter: F1,7 = 14.1,p<0.01].\nFigure 3. Saccade accuracy (in terms of angular deviation from the centre of the target stimulus)\nis shown as a function saccade latency depending on remote distracter presence. Mean accuracy\nwas determined for successive 20% portions of the saccade latency distribution from shortest to\nlongest. These are plotted across the means of those latency bins. Accuracy was found to improve as\nlatency increased whether a remote distracter was present or not. The fits shown are linear and show\nno significant changes in slope or intercept when the remote distracter was present. The accuracy\nimprovements found in the presence of the remote distracter reflect a similar temporal development\nof saccade competition as found when only the local distracter was present. Repeated measures error\nbars are shown (Loftus and Masson 1994).\nTo examine the effect of saccade latency on saccade accuracy (the angular error of the\nsaccade landing position relative to the target position), the latency distribution was quintiled\nfor each contralateral distracter condition, separately for each subject. The mean saccade\naccuracy deviation and its corresponding mean latency were determined for successive\n20% portions of the saccade latency distribution (data were not separated by fixation gap\nintervals). These were averaged across subjects and are shown in figure 3. It is clear that, as\nthe latency of the saccade increases, its corresponding accuracy improves. To explore this\nrelationship further the best linear fits were determined for each contralateral distracter\ncondition separately for each subject. All data were well captured by these fits except for one\nobserver in the NO remote distracter condition [r2 = 0.1; mean r2 otherwise: absent = 0.41\nthat slopes from all subjects in both contralateral distracter conditions significantly differ\nfrom zero [absent: t(7) = -4.5; present: t(7) = -5.5, p<0.01] indicating that accuracy improves\nas saccade latency increases. A paired t-test shows no difference between the slopes for\neach distracter condition [t(7) = 1.3, ns] suggesting that the contralateral distracter improves\nsaccade accuracy by increasing the latency of the saccade in the similar manner to that\nwhich occurs when the distracter is absent. The overall linear fits to each remote distracter\ncondition are plotted on figure 3.\n78 E McSorley, A G Cruickshank\n4 Discussion\nWhen making saccades to targets which have distracting stimuli close by, we find an accuracy\nbenefit gained from the presence of a visual distracter remote from their location (see also\nCruickshank and McSorley 2009; McSorley and Findlay 2003). Remote distracter effects on\naccuracy have been ascribed to a lengthening of the saccadic response time made in its\npresence. We find that manipulation of saccade latency showed an improvement in saccade\naccuracy as latency increased. The addition of the remote distracter did not change the\npattern of improvement; rather, presence of remote distracter appears to increase latency\nand access the competition between the target and local distracter at a later time, thus\nproducing more accurate saccades. This suggests action of the remote distracter is indirect\n(Walker et al 1997): the temporal development of saccade competition does not change as\nthe remote distracter does not directly influence it. We suggest that remote distracters act\nalong an indirect route which impairs disengagement from fixation, perhaps via long range\ninhibitory interactions (Gandhi and Keller 1995) which serve to increase activity around\nfixation, and inhibit the initiation of the saccade. This allows competition between the local\ndistracter and the target to be more developed prior to its reaching a critical threshold for\nmovement initiation allowing more accurate saccades to be made. A direct route, in which\nthe remote distracter interacts more directly with target and local distracter and therefore\nimpacts on the competition taking place between them, would have predicted the temporal\ndevelopment of saccade competition would be modified in some way by remote distracter\npresence. Our data do not fit with this explanation (see also the findings of Cruickshank and\nIt is interesting to note that accuracy improves until saccade latency is around 200 ms at\nwhich point there is some suggestion in figure 3 that it worsens again (that is, landing position\nstarts to deviate away from the target in the opposite direction to the local distracter). This is\nvery similar to the pattern of deviations found in the trajectories of target driven saccades\nWalker et al 2006). Saccade trajectories are found to deviate toward the distracter location\nwhen they have a short latency but deviate away as latencies increase. The saccade latency at\nwhich the direction of trajectory deviation changes from toward to away from the distracter\n(ie when the trajectory is straight) is also around 200 ms. The few data reported in this\npaper which support this similarity are suggestive, but further work exploring longer saccade\nlatencies would be necessary to establish the temporal development of the inhibition of the\nlocal distracter on saccade landing position.\nOur results fit well with recent models of saccade programming. In these models the\ncompetition which determines where and when saccades are directed is determined on\nmotor maps which are organised topographically throughout the visual/motor system\n2001) like those identified in superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, and lateral intraparietal\narea. Visual areas of interest, such as different potential targets, are represented across these\nas neural peaks of activation with overlapping receptive fields (eg Bruce and Goldberg 1985;\nGoldberg et al 2006; Lee et al 1988), with excitatory connections to nearby receptive fields\nand inhibitory connections to those further away (Hikosaka 1989; Hikosaka et al 2000; Munoz\nbetween possible saccade targets takes place within these motor maps until a single area\nof activation exceeds threshold and the saccade is initiated to that point (Hanes and Schall\n1996; Ratcliff et al 2007). The landing position of a saccade is a consequence of distributed\npopulation coding over large overlapping receptive or movement fields in the superior\nInhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 79\nvisual targets are close together (within \u00b1 20 deg), they activate overlapping movement fields,\nresulting in a single large peak of activity. In these cases saccades tend to land between\nthe stimuli, at the peak of activation (this is known as the global effect or centre of gravity\neffect). The extent of the deviation in landing position reflects the relative neural activation\nvan Opstal and van Gisbergen 1989; Walker et al 1997). Landing position deviations from\nthe target arise when sites representing multiple stimuli are active and the saccade will land\nbetween them. A shorter latency saccade is generated when activation produced by the onset\nof the stimuli quickly exceeds threshold, resulting in inhibition of fixation activity. Owing\nto the overlapping receptive field properties of the saccadic system the landing position is\nlikely to be influenced by activation produced by each stimulus close to the target location.\nSaccades will become progressively more accurate as the activation at the target location\nincreases and that of the other stimuli diminishes through competitive processes which\ntakes time, thus longer latency saccades are more accurate saccades.\nStimuli which are farther apart affect when the saccade is initiated but do not affect where\nthe saccade lands (this is known as the remote distracter effect; Born and Kerzel 2008; Honda\nwhen observers know which side of fixation the target will appear on, suggesting that it is\nWalker et al (1997) found that the magnitude of the remote distracter effect diminishes with\nrelative distance of the target and distracter from fixation, as opposed to distance of the\ndistracter from the target. This led them to suggest that that the remote distracter acts via\nlong range inhibitory interactions (as reported by Gandhi and Keller 1995) on cells in the\nrostral pole of the superior colliculus (Munoz and Wurtz 1995a, 1995b) by maintaining tonic\nactivation and thus inhibiting when a saccade can be initiated (Munoz and Wurtz 1993).\nContrary to Walker et al (1997), others have reported that increasing distracter distance from\nthe target (rather than fixation) induces the remote distracter effect (Dorris et al 2007; Olivier\net al 1999). They show that neuronal activity in superior colliculus at the target location is\ninhibited when distracters are shown at remote distances from the target. However, given the\nrestricted set of distracter distances from target (two: near and far) and the timing differences\nbetween distracter and target onset (distracter was onset 200 ms prior to the target) employed\nby Dorris et al (2007), it is not clear which of these two explanations underlie the remote\ndistracter effect. It is notable that our results fit better with the former explanation for an\nimpact of the remote distracter on fixational disengagement. A further test of our findings\nwould be to manipulate the position of the remote distracter (temporally and spatially) in the\nmanner reported by Walker et al (1997). Our prediction is that the accuracy of the saccade\nshould be dependent wholly on the latency of the saccade regardless of remote distracter\nplacement.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that the involuntary increase in saccade latency induced by a\nremote distracter inhibits the onset of the saccade by increasing fixation related activation. As\nthe competition between stimuli progresses the point of highest activation shifts towards the\ntarget. Thus, the involuntary increase in saccade initiation latency induced by the presence\nof a remote distracter improves target localisation by accessing the underlying competition\nwhich determines its identity at a later, and more finely resolved, stage of processing.\n"
