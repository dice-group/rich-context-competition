It is anticipated that geo-locating\na rural African farmer working in his farm with the help\nof an app installed in his cellphone, identifying the soil\ntype and needs of the field, and offering advice regarding\nappropriate seeds, where they can be purchased, and\nhow they can be planted and harvested is not far in\nthe future (Patel, 2013). As another example, a retro-\nspective analysis of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti\nshowed that mining data from Twitter and online news\nreports could have given the country's health officials an\naccurate indication of the disease's spread with a lead\ntime of two weeks (Chunara et al., 2012).\nPerhaps the greatest advantage offered by BD in the\ncontext of development is that it helps us gain a better\nunderstanding of the extent and nature of poverty and\ndevise appropriate policy measures. For instance,\nmobile data can make it possible to better understand\nthe dynamics of slum residents. The call detail record\n(CDR) and other information can provide insights into\nthe slum population, which would help forecast the\nneeds for toilets, clean drinking water, and infra-\nstructures (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). To take an\nexample, in Kenya's Nairobi, geo-coded cellphone\ntransaction data is used by the Engineering Social\nSystems (ESS) project to model slums' growth, which\ncould help the government to optimize resource allo-\ncation for infrastructural development and other\nresources (Bays, 2014). Alternative data collection and\nanalysis techniques such as surveys have a very low\ndegree of usefulness for such purposes, which may\ntake months and even years for getting results and\nare often out of date.\nAn encouraging trend is that the tools and expertise\nthat are employed to make decisions and take actions\nThe University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA\nCorresponding author:\nNir Kshetri, Bryan School of Business and Economics, The University of\nNorth Carolina at Greensboro, Bryan Building, Room: 368, P.

For instance, data generated by social\nmedia such as Twitter is being analyzed in order to\ndetect early signs that can lead to a spike in the price\nof staple foods, increase in unemployment, and out-\nbreak of diseases such as malaria. Robert Kirkpatrick\nof the UN Global Pulse team referred to such signs as\n``digital smoke signals of distress'' and noted that they\ncan be detected months before official statistics (Lohr,\n2013). The importance of this technique is even more\npronounced if we consider the fact that there are no\nreliable statistics in many developing countries.\nPrior research indicates that information infrastruc-\nture has social, political, and economic dimensions\n(Bowker, 1996). This argument can be extended in\nobvious ways to include BD infrastructures. We argue\nthat different social, political and economic situations\nand the current state of digital divide may give rise to\nsigniEcantly different rates of diffusion in industrialized\nand developing countries. Unsurprisingly, there is an\nenormous gap between the developing and developed\nworlds in the utilization of BD.\nOne way to better understand this phenomenon is to\nconsider how the nature of the current digital divide is\nassociated with and facilitated by the pattern of BD\ndiffusion and its effective use. Hilbert (2014) notes\nthat the current inequality of technological capacity\nrepresents a more mature and also more persistent\nstage of the digital divide. Boyd and Crawford (2012)\nargue that limited access to BD has created new forms\nof digital divides. They note that the lack of money to\nafford data is among many factors that may contribute\nto the digital divide.\nThe international digital divide may account for the\ndifferential rates of BD diffusion and its effective use in\nindustrialized and developing countries. In order to\nbetter understand the diffusion and effective use of\nBD in developing countries, it is thus first important\nto consider the current stage of the digital divide.\nHilbert (2014) has identified three complementary\nstages associated with the digital divide: access to a\ntechnology, its effective usage, and social integration\nand impact of the technology. The rapidly narrowing\naccess gap between industrialized and developing coun-\ntries makes the last two stages more relevant. Prior\nresearchers have suggested that factors such as avail-\nability of skills and capabilities, social and cultural\nattitudes towards a technology, the institutional\nenvironment, and social reorganization are tightly\nlinked to the ability to use the technology effectively\nand appropriately (Buente and Robbin, 2008;\ncan be considered as key components of a social\nsystem, which is tightly linked to the diffusion of an\nWhile there are some encouraging trends in the util-\nization of BD in addressing a number of social and\neconomic problems, developing economies are far\nfrom achieving the full transformative potential of\nBD. It is thus important for researchers and policy-\nmakers to have a deeper understanding of social, pol-\nitical, and economic contexts that facilitate and inhibit\nBD's diffusion and effective utilization in key develop-\nment areas. This issue also needs to be considered in\nrelation to the broader issue of the digital divide.\nIn light of the above observations, our goal in this\npaper is modest and is simply aimed at deepening our\nunderstanding of facilitators and inhibitors of diffusion\nand effective utilization of BD in developing countries.\nA related goal of this paper is to explore this issue in\nrelation to the current nature of the international digi-\ntal divide. In order to achieve these goals, we present a\nreview of academic literature, policy documents from\ngovernment organizations and international agencies,\nand reports from industries and popular media on the\ntrends in BD utilization in key development issues and\nits worthwhileness, usefulness, and relevance.\nBefore getting to the details of this study, it is worth-\nwhile to first clarify some of the key concepts. By\ndeveloping countries, we mean low-, lower middle-,\nand lower middle-income countries in the World Bank\ncategorization (The World Bank Group, 2014). In order\nto define BD for the purpose of this paper, we start with\nthe technology research company Gartner's definition of\nBD, which are ``high-volume, high-velocity and high-\nvariety information assets that demand cost-effective,\ninnovative forms of information processing for\nenhanced insight and decision making'' (gartner.com,\n2013). With regard to volume, Boyd and Crawford\nthat BD ``is less about data that is big than it is about\na capacity to search, aggregate, and cross-reference large\ndata sets''. In this paper's context, we define BD as data\nsets that can provide insights into human well-being,\nwhich satisfy at least one of the following characteristics\ncompared to data sets that have been traditionally used\nin developmental issues: (a) are of higher volume, (b) are\nof wider variety, and (c) enable users to make decisions\nand act faster. The paper is structured as follows.\nWe proceed by first discussing the methodology. The\nsection following that provides a theoretical framework\nfor assessing the diffusion and effects of BD in develop-\ning countries. Next, we analyze the characteristics of BD\nin the context of development. This is followed by a\nsection on the emerging trends associated with BD util-\nization in development with a discussion of some present\nand potential future applications. Then, we investigate\nthe opportunities and challenges of using BD for\n2 Big Data & Society\ndevelopment with the help of the case of agriculture and\nfarming activities. It is followed by a section on dis-\ncussion and implications. The final section provides\nconcluding comments.\nMethodology\nThe approach employed in this paper can be described\nas a positivistic epistemology. Given the minute amount\nof existing research on BD's use, particularly in develop-\ning countries, much initial research in this area needs to\nbe qualitative, concept-, and theory-building in charac-\nter. This paper thus takes such an approach.\nFollowing the approach often used in positivist\nresearch, this paper seeks to identify details associated\nwith BD use in developing countries. We have\nemployed three main sources for the reasoning in the\ntheory-development process: theoretical explanations\nfor ``whys'' and ``hows'' of BD diffusion; past empirical\nfindings; and practice or experience (Webster and\nWatson, 2002). Among these, the logical reasoning is\nthe most important component of our explanations,\nwhich provides ``the theoretical glue'' (Whetten, 1989:\n491). We have also included empirical research related\nto BD uses and from other related areas such as diffu-\nsion of cellphones and other innovations. Next, BD-\nrelated experiences of organizations (e.g. Land\nO'Lakes, DuPont, AgriLife), nations (e.g. Kenya,\nUganda), regions (e.g. Latin America and the\nCaribbean (LAC) economies, Africa), and development\nagencies (e.g. UN Global Pulse team). In addition to\nacademic literature, we reviewed policy documents\nfrom government organizations and international agen-\ncies and reports from industries and popular media.\nMaterials reviewed also include reports of consultants\nand suppliers of BD-related solutions (e.g. Monsanto,\nGartner, Cisco and McKinsey). In order to locate art-\nicles, reports, and policy documents related to BD uses\nin developing countries, we searched using various\ncombinations of keywords such as ``data'', ``Big\nData'', ``development'', ``developing countries'',\n``Africa'', ``Latin America'', ``China'', ``India'',\n``Nigeria'', ``Brazil'', ``Argentina'', etc. We limited our\nsearch to materials published in the English language.\nA theoretical framework for assessing\nthe diffusion and effects of BD in\ndeveloping countries\nCharacteristics of the technology and environment\naffecting BD diffusion\nTheoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the\ndiffusion of an innovation is influenced by the environ-\nment, and characteristics of the innovation (O'Neil\nfied various characteristics of a technology affecting its\ndiffusion pattern. Table 1 presents how BD performs in\nterms of the various characteristics of an innovation\nproposed by Rogers: relative advantage, compatibility,\ncomplexity, observability, and trialability.\nRegarding the environment, prior researchers have\nnoted that an innovation (e.g. BD) is embedded in a\nsocial system, which plays an important role in its dif-\nfusion. A social system is ``a set of interrelated units\nthat are engaged in joint problem solving to accomplish\nforms--formal as well as informal.\nBowker (1996) provides further specification and\nelaboration of the conditions under which new innov-\nframework. He argues that, in addition to the economic\ndimension, information infrastructures also have\nsocial (informal) and political (formal) dimensions.\nSocial systems also exist at different levels (individual,\norganization, network, or national). For instance, the\nsocial structure and communication structure affect\ninformation flow and other factors that are critical\nfor the adoption of the innovation by the adopting\nunits. Various societal norms also affect the behavioral\npatterns of the members of a social system.\nFinally, the characteristics of the social system are\ntightly linked to the real and/or perceived attributes of\nan innovation (Rogers, 1995). For instance, due to\nBD's potential role in promoting transparency, decision\nmakers in a social system characterized by secrecy and\ndistrust may view BD's attributes negatively.\nInternational heterogeneity in the diffusion rates of\ninnovations\nWe start this section with a brief description of the\ninternational heterogeneity in the diffusion rates of\ninnovations and the key sources of the heterogeneity.\nPrior research indicates that organizations in a country\nwith a low degree of inter-relatedness with other com-\nplementary technologies often find it difficult to obtain\nthe information and skills needed for a new technology\n(Allen, 1998). Thus, countries with a small base of high\ntechnology and innovative capital goods are likely to\nexperience lower rates of diffusion for emerging new\ntechnologies (Antonelli, 1986). To put things in con-\ntext, wider and deeper adoptions of personal computers\n(PCs), mobile devices, and other information and com-\nmunications technology (ICT) applications are likely to\nlead to faster diffusion of BD.\nAnother source of international variation in BD dif-\nfusion lies in the market and infrastructure factors con-\ntrolling the availability of the technology to potential\nadopters (Brown et al., 1976). Prior research has\nsuggested that manufacturers of new technological\nproducts are more likely to focus their efforts on large\ndistributors often located in developed countries\n(Gatignon and Robertson, 1985). The environments\nin developing countries are associated with adverse con-\nditions in terms of markets and infrastructures, which\nare likely to slow down the diffusion of new techno-\nlogical innovations such as BD. For instance, a large\nproportion of firms in developing countries may lack\nreadiness to adopt BD. Likewise, under-developed\ninfrastructures such as those related to weather fore-\ncasting and satellite-imaging technologies hinder the\nuse of BD in agricultural activities in these countries.\nIn order to provide insights into the above issues, it\nis important to discuss the changing nature of the inter-\nnational digital divide. On the basis of a review of aca-\ndemic and practitioner-oriented writings on the digital\ndivide, Hilbert (2014) identifies three complementary\nstages associated with it: access to a technology, its\neffective usage, and social integration and impact of\nthe technology. The fact that over 90% of the popula-\ntion in developing economies owned cellphones in 2013\nmeans that the access-related digital divide has signifi-\ncantly narrowed.\nNonetheless, developing economies face a number of\nchallenges that may limit their capability to utilize BD\neffectively. A low degree of digitization is among the\nbiggest barriers. One way to measure digitization is to\nconsider Booz & Company's Digitization Index\n(BCDI), which is based on 23 indicators such as\naccess, affordability, reliability, speed and usability of\ndigital services/applications, and users' skills. For\ninstance, the average BCDI score of emerging econo-\nmies was 27 compared to developed economies' 54.\nBooz & Company has described most emerging econo-\nmies in the constrained or emerging stages of digitiza-\ntion, whereas developed economies are in the\ntransitional or advanced stage (Strategy, 2012). In\nthese countries, there are limited hardware, software,\nand other technology applications to generate and dis-\ntribute relevant data and knowledge (UN Development\nProgram (UNDP), 2011). Moreover, the lower quality\nof hardware, software, and infrastructure may lead to a\nlower amount of information flow in developing coun-\ntries. For instance, many businesses design websites\nwith features such as ``low-graphics'' and ``text-only''\nto accommodate the needs of users in developing\ncountries.\nIt is also reported that most African countries use\naccounting methods more than five decade old to gen-\nerate vital statistics such as those related to gross\ndomestic product (GDP) (Bhushan, 2012). The World\nBank's study indicated that many countries in the LAC\nregion lack a strategic vision required for the overall\nmanagement of the statistical system (The World Bank,\nTable 1. Characteristics of a technology influencing its diffusion: the case of BD.\nDimension Explanation Situation in developing countries\nRelative advantage  Perceived benefits of a technology over previous\ntechnologies and the extent to which it is better\nthan the idea it supersedes.\n Compared to traditional surveys (e.g. household,\nlabor market, living standard) Big Data involves rela-\ntively shorter time to collect and analyze.\n BD initiatives are likely to reduce the costs signifi-\ncantly compared to traditional surveys.\n SM (e.g. Twitter's API) is more appropriate to detect\ncrisis than traditional techniques such as interviews\nCompatibility  The degree to which a technology and the tasks it\nperforms are perceived as being consistent with the\nexisting values, beliefs, past experiences, and needs of\npotential adopters.\n The initiatives such as Kenya's ODP are likely to be\nincompatible with institutions filled with secrecy and\ncorruption.\nComplexity  The level of difficulty of installing and using a technol-\nogy (variety and uncertainty increase complexity).\n There is a shortage of skills for data-related man-\npower.

Factors\nsuch as availability of skills and capabilities, social\nand cultural attitudes towards a technology, the insti-\ntutional environment, and social reorganization are\ntightly linked to the ability to use the technology effect-\nively and appropriately (Buente and Robbin, 2008;\n2009). Factors such as the availability of skills and\nthe availability of social support have also been recog-\nnized by DiMaggio and Hargittai (2001) as the key\ndimensions of the digital divide. They have especially\nemphasized the role of ``Internet competence'', which is\nrelated to the know-how, technical skills and capacity\nto exploit the Internet's potential by strategically\nresponding to challenges and opportunities\nFinally, equality in usage does not necessarily trans-\nlate to social equality. Some groups of society are in a\nposition to benefit more from ICTs than others. This\nimplies the possibility of dominance by some social\ngroups and may therefore lead to ``an increasing\nsocial divide'' (Hilbert, 2014). For instance, one com-\nmentator noted that about 90% of the discussion at the\n2013 Internet Governance Forum (IGF) referred to BD\nas a surveillance tool. At the same time, the debate\nfocusing on developing countries treated BD as a\nmeans to ``observe'' people to fight poverty. The argu-\nment provided by IGF participants was that data can\nhelp provide access to clean drinking water, healthcare,\nand other necessities (linnettaylor, 2013).\nSome forces to overcome the adverse impacts of\nmarkets and infrastructures\nWhile manufacturers of new technological products\noften find developed countries less attractive, prior\nresearchers have suggested that multinationals exploit\ntechnological capabilities internationally by means of\nactivities such as export, movement of production\nactivities abroad, and licensing, which have driven the\nglobalization of technologies (Archibugi and Michie,\nbeen shown to influence the diffusion of Internet and e-\ncommerce related technologies, especially in developing\nAs noted earlier, transnational corporations (TNCs)\nsuch as Monsanto and Syngenta are likely to drive\nthe international technology transfer of BD in the agri-\ncultural sector.\nPrior research has suggested that international insti-\ntutions influence the global diffusion of ICTs in several\nways (Kshetri, 2001). For instance, they introduced the\nInternet for the first time in many developing countries.\nThe UNDP introduced the Internet in more than 15\ncountries by connecting them to the global network\nand deployed the Internet protocol (IP) network in\nthe UNDP also trained over 25,000 organizations and\ncreated more than 40,000 websites for governments and\ncivil society stakeholders and 3000 national and regio-\nnal thematic networks (UNDP, 2001). As noted earlier,\nvarious BD initiatives have been undertaken by the UN\nin developing countries.\nAnother encouraging trend is that there has been an\nabundance of BD-related entrepreneurship in the\ndeveloping countries. This is important because, as\nnoted above, Western firms often find developing\ncountries to be less attractive markets. Firms in these\ncountries are rapidly emerging as providers of products,\nservices, software, and solutions related to BD (Kshetri,\n2011). For instance, a technology developed by the\nBrazilian company Cignifi can recognize patterns in\nconsumers' phone-calls, text messages, and data\nusage, which are used to predict lifestyle and credit\nrisk profile (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). A study con-\nducted by India's National Association of Software\nand Services Companies (NASSCOM) and CRISIL\nGlobal Research & Analytics estimated that the\nwhich is expected to increase to US$ 1 billion in 2015\n(Srikanth, 2013). Likewise, the AgriLife platform was\ndeveloped by Kenya-based IT company MobiPay and\nwas launched in late 2012. Mercy Corps supported the\nexpansion of AgriLife to Uganda and helped build rela-\ntionships with other service providers and integrate\nthem into the platform, so they can reach rural clients\nmore effectively.\nCharacteristics of BD in the context\nof development\nMassive amounts of data generated by social media,\ncellphones, and other digital communication tools,\nwhich are being increasingly used in developing coun-\ntries, are a true form of BD. While such data has not\nbeen traditionally used in developmental issues, it is\nlikely to be a useful indicator of human well-being\nand is thus a relevant BD source for development\nIt is first important to explain what BD is and how\none can say that a data set used for a specific, develop-\nment-related purpose is BD. As noted earlier, Gartner\nhas defined BD in terms of three Vs: volume, velocity,\nand variety. The software company, SAS, has added\ntwo additional dimensions: variability and complexity\n(sas.com, 2013). The following discussion will examine\nhow the various characteristics or dimensions of BD\nidentified by Gartner and SAS are relevant in the con-\ntext of developmental data (Table 2).\nVolume\nThere has been a colossal increase in the digitization\nrate of developing countries. Of particular importance\nto the present discussion is the rapid diffusion of cell-\nphones, which are probably the most important source\nof data in the context of development. Whereas only a\nlittle over a quarter of the population in developing\ncountries owns a PC, close to 90% owned cellphones\nin 2013. One estimate suggested that the mobile data\ntraffic generated by subscribers in emerging markets\nPeople with high disposable income in developing\neconomies tend to spend a significant portion on top-\nping up their mobile airtime credit. The monthly air-\ntime expenses can provide background of the\nhousehold income. This information provides guidance\non how to best target appropriate services through\nadvertising. It can be done anonymously. Monitoring\nairtime expenses for trends and sudden changes pro-\nvides a measure of the early impact of an economic\ncrisis and the impact of programs designed to improve\nMobile phone-related data often provide high qual-\nity, valuable information because a mobile phone is\noften the only interactive technology for most low-\nincome individuals. Moreover, it is easy to link\nmobile-generated data to individuals, which can help\nunderstand their needs and behaviors (World\nEconomic Forum (WEF), 2012). The frequency with\nwhich calls are made and received with contacts outside\nof one's immediate community provides an in-depth\nunderstanding of the socio-economic class (UN\nProbably the most useful category of data is the\nCDR, which is automatically generated by mobile net-\nwork operators for all mobile transactions. Each record\ncontains attributes of the transaction such as the start\ntime and duration of a call. In addition, the operator\nrecords cell towers with which the phones of the caller\nand recipient are connected. This information makes it\npossible to use CDRs to know the location of both\nparties (UN Global Pulse, 2013a). CDRs have a\nnumber of potential uses. The information about cell\ntowers provides insight into the community's move-\nment patterns such as how people move from home,\nwork, school, markets or clinics. More importantly,\nsuch information provides a basis for assessing the\npotential spread of a disease into the area and the\nmovements of a disaster-affected population (UN\nGlobal Pulse, 2013b). This information provides key\ninsight for relief efforts.\nCellphone transactions have been recognized as a\nmajor source of data for developmental issues. For\nTable 2. Relevance of Big Data dimensions in developmental issues.\nCharacteristic Explanation Some examples in the context of development\nVolume Huge amount of data is created from a wide range of\nsources such as transactions, unstructured streaming\nfrom text, images, audio, voice, VoIP, video, TV and\nother media, sensor, and machine-to-data.\nRapid diffusion of cellphones, social media, and other\ntechnologies has led to the creation of huge amount\nof data.\nVelocity (fast data) Some data is time-sensitive and needs to be collected,\nstored, processed, analyzed, and acted on quickly. In\nsome cases, speed is more important than volume.\nMost decisions are based on data that are near-real-time\n(e.g. AgriLife).\nVariety Data comes in multiple formats such as structured,\nnumeric data in traditional database, and unstruc-\ntured text documents; email, video, audio, and\nfinancial transactions.\nStructured and unstructured data are being used in a\nnumber of developmental projects (e.g. Malaria\nSurveillance & Mapping project in Botswana and\n``Water Watchers'' in South Africa).\nVariability Data flows can vary greatly with periodic peaks and\ntroughs. These are related to social media trends,\ndaily, seasonal and event-triggered peak data loads,\nand other factors.\nVariation of data flow is related to certain develop-\nmental indicators (e.g. the correlation of the volume\nof Tweets about staple foods and increase in the\ncost).\nComplexity Data come from multiple sources which require linking,\nmatching, cleansing, and transforming across systems.\nBy matching and linking data from diverse sources such\nas CDRs, open portals, social media, government,\nNGOs, and corporations (e.g. prediction of food\nshortages by combining data related to drought,\nweather conditions, migration patterns, market\nprices of staples, seasonal variation in prices and past\nproductions), key insights can be gained regarding a\ndevelopmental issue.\n6 Big Data & Society\ninstance, the characteristics of data related to microfi-\nnance transactions such as the number and character-\nistics of clients, loan amounts and types, and default\nrate arguably fall between traditional development data\nand BD (Global Pulse, 2012). With a more widespread\nuse of mobile and online platforms for microloan trans-\nactions, a large amount of microfinance data can be\ndigitized and analyzed in real time.\nActivity data generated by social media also consti-\ntutes a major data source for developmental issues. For\ninstance, most of Facebook's growth in recent years is\ncoming from emerging markets. Among the 10 coun-\ntries with the most Facebook users in 2012, six were\nemerging markets. Five of them, India, Brazil,\nIndonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines, accounted for\ngrowth can be partly attributed to initiatives such as\nFacebook Zero. Thanks to Facebook's collaboration\nwith mobile operators from a number of emerging\neconomies, users can access 0.facebook.com\n(Facebook Zero) completely free. Facebook Zero con-\ntains the key features of Facebook. A majority of users\nin developing countries use mobile devices to access\nFacebook. Most of these phones are feature phones\nthat operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than\nsmart phones with app capabilities. Every Phone app,\nwhich runs on around 3000 feature phone models\nworldwide, has made it possible for these users to\npeople used this app. Some telecom carriers in countries\nsuch as India, the Philippines, and Indonesia offer free\nor discounted data for Facebook Zero users (Byford,\nVelocity\nVelocity is considered as a ``competitive differentiator''\nfor businesses using BD (Laney, 2001: 2). In this paper's\ncontext, BD provides the possibility for real-time feed-\nback, which can lead to important developmental out-\ncomes. For instance, by monitoring a population in real\ntime, it is possible to understand the areas where devel-\nopmental policies and programs are failing and make\nrequired adjustments (Letouze\nA number of initiatives that have been launched to\npromote a BD ecosystem have focused on velocity of\ndata. In sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies, the use\nof farm credits is reported to decline due to poor access\nto financial services, high borrowing costs, and high\nrisks associated with such credits (Oluoch-Kosura,\n2010). The creation of high-velocity data has helped\naddress some of these problems. For instance, as of\nSeptember 2013, the information created by AgriLife,\na cloud-mobile platform in Kenya which provides\nfinancial institutions and suppliers ``near-real-time\ninformation'' on farmers' ability to pay for services\n(capacity.org, 2013), facilitated over US$ 2 million in\nAs another example, the World Bank's ``Listening to\nLAC'' (L2L) initiative in Latin America deployed\nmobile technologies to conduct real-time self-adminis-\ntered surveys. The surveys collect life events data on a\nnear real-time basis and generate panel data. The data\nis expected to inform policymakers on current indica-\ntors and help them to respond more quickly and effect-\nively to key trends (The World Bank, 2010). The data\ncollection instrument is also expected to help policy-\nmakers assess the impact of their programs in real\ntime and observe coping mechanisms in situations\nsuch as migration, school attendance, employment\npatterns, and nutrition (The World Bank, 2010).\nIt is especially important to explain the benefits of\nBD in the context of the lack of availability of data on\nkey developmental indicators. Most traditional devel-\nopment data come from surveys (e.g. household, labor\nmarket, living standard) and official statistics. In add-\nition to high costs, key problems of survey data include\na relatively longer time to collect and analyze.\nPainfully, developing nations need to wait for a\ndecade or more to adjust the GDP or estimate poverty\nindicators (Fengler, 2013). Data that is collected more\nfrequently, which is better organized, can help assess\nthe social and economic conditions faster.\nVariety\nIt is important to first define structured and unstruc-\ntured data. Structured data can be organized in an\nassigned format that can be used by a database man-\nagement system such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL.\nSome examples include histories of mobile payment\ntransaction and the date of a Twitter account creation.\nSuch data can be arranged in a list, compared with\nother data, used to generate new data, and retrieved\nfor decision making. Unstructured data, on the other\nhand, is unformatted and lacks a predefined standard\nstructure (e.g. cannot be organized in terms of rows and\ncolumns). Some examples include email messages,\nsocial media posts, pictures, and video. It is also\nworth noting that some sources involving interactions\nbetween people and machines such as web applications\nor social networks may provide multi-structured data.\nFor instance, web log data includes unstructured data\nsuch as text and visual images and structured data such\nas transactional information (Arthur, 2013).\nStructured and unstructured data are being increas-\ningly combined in developmental projects. For\ninstance, the Malaria Surveillance & Mapping project\nin Botswana was a pilot program launched in 2011,\nwhich aims to move away from paper reports towards\nmobile clouds. Health care workers are equipped with\nmobile phones to gather and upload malaria-related\ndata to the cloud. The data can also be tagged with\nstructured data such as GPS coordinates and unstruc-\ntured data such as pictures, video, and audio. If there\nare signals of an outbreak of malaria, Ministry of\nHealth officials and other health workers in the area\nreceive a real-time notification via text message\nAnother remarkable example of the utilization of\nstructured and unstructured data is ``Water\nWatchers'', a mobile application developed to report\nwater-related issues in May 2013 by IBM and South\nAfrica's City of Tshwane. One estimate suggested that\n60% of water worldwide is lost due to leaky pipes\n(Carew, 2013). The app's users take a picture which\nshows a water-related problem and answers three ques-\ntions about the problem. This data is then uploaded in\nreal time on a cloud server. The information generated\ncan be expected to identify a water ``leak hot spot'' map\n(Carew, 2013). BD may hold a great promise for find-\ning appropriate steps to prevent or minimize this\nwastage.\nVariability\nThe approaches in BD assume that correlations can be\nconsidered as pragmatic indications of relations among\nvariables (Mayer-Scho\nthis regard, one technique which has been of great\ninterest in developing countries is anomaly (or outlier)\ndetection based on the variability over time in the\namount of data flow related to a given developmental\nindicator. Note that anomaly detection involves iden-\ntifying items or events that fail to conform to an\nexpected pattern. The idea here is that items or events\nthat exhibit an anomalous behavior (e.g. unusually high\nrate flow of data of certain categories) may be asso-\nciated with some kind of problem. To take an example,\nthe data formats used in Twitter's API are such that\nthey provide the dynamic anomaly detection features\n(Madsen, 2013). The idea here is that the key metadata\nused in segmenting Twitter data such as hashtags (#)\nand replies (@) are user-generated and thus are logical\ntargets to follow in order to understand problems and\ncrises that users face. In sum, observing patterns of\nanomalies inside the data flowing from the Twitter\nAPI, one can detect signals of a crisis (Madsen, 2013).\nOne example to illustrate this point comes from a\nresearch project undertaken by the UN Global Pulse,\nwhich indicated that analysis of Twitter data can pro-\nvide information on an increase in food prices. An ana-\nlysis of a data set containing thousands of Tweets from\nIndonesia discussing the price of rice indicated that the\nvolume of Tweets about staple foods had a positive\ncorrelation with increase in the cost (UN Global\nComplexity\nIt would be helpful to first note that the really big dif-\nference between variety and complexity concerns mul-\ntiple data types (variety) versus multiple sources of data\n(complexity). Matching and linking data from multiple\nsources such as CDRs, open portals, social media, gov-\nernment sources, non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs), and corporations can provide a whole picture\nof the economic and social conditions of the rural\npopulation and thus valuable and relevant new insights\n(bigdata-startups.com, 2013). To take an example, a\nstudy of the ESS department of Harvard University\n(hsph.harvard.edu, 2014) indicated that BD can be\nemployed to predict food shortages by combining vari-\nables from a number of sources such as drought, wea-\nther conditions, migration patterns, market prices of\nstaples, seasonal variation in prices, and past produc-\ntions (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). As another exam-\nple, time-series analyses of CDRs can be combined\nwith random surveys to provide better insights about\nthe dynamics of rural economies and help devise appro-\npriate government responses (bigdata-startups.com,\nBD in development: Some present uses\nand potential future applications\nThese are noteworthy and encouraging trends in BD's\nutilization in developing economies. BD is playing an\nincreasingly important role in several key development\nareas such as healthcare, agriculture, biotechnology,\neducation, and environment monitoring.\nBD has been effectively used to evaluate and measure\nthe impacts of humanitarian aid and similar interven-\ntions. One example is the UN's analysis of social media\nposts to find out whether its Every Woman Every Child\n(EWEC) initiative accomplished the goal of effectively\ndelivering the message to the target audience.\nThe UN trained a team to monitor and recognize\nrelevant Tweets. The EWEC team used the analytical\ntool Forsight developed by the social media analysis\nconsulting firm Crimson Hexagon to analyze public\ndeveloped a taxonomy of relevant keywords such as\n``maternal health'', ``breastfeeding'', and ``vaccination\nof children'' to identify messages that are relevant to\nwomen's and children's health and searched these key-\nlions of social media posts in a two-year period\nregarding the extent and frequency with which relevant\n8 Big Data & Society\nkeywords were used indicated a significant shift\ntowards an increased awareness of parental health\nIn the pre-BD era, the principal way to measure the\nimpacts of humanitarian aid programs such as the\nEWEC would be to conduct household surveys. It is\nthus important to compare the performance of BD with\nsuch surveys. In this regard, Table 3 illustrates how\ndifferent BD dimensions can be applied in the context\nof EWEC's analysis of social media posts. Regarding\nthe volume, despite problems such as the relative lack\nof randomness compared to household surveys, it is\npossible to inexpensively extract a huge amount of\ndata from social media posts. Sometimes the final\nresults may take years since key processes in household\nsurveys such as visiting households for data collection\nand entering data into a computer system are extremely\ntime consuming and expensive. Finally, such surveys\nare not effective in collecting and analyzing unstruc-\ntured data.\nA similar use of BD has been in providing real-time\ninformation on important social and economic indica-\ntors. For instance, sentiment analysis can provide\ninsights into a community's attitude toward certain\nkey issues. To take an example, the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) (2013) showed that by\nanalyzing parents' social media posts, it is possible to\ntrack attitudes towards immunization.\nAnother notable use of BD has been in the design of\nan effective method and system for efficient distribution\nand management of life-saving medicines that have lim-\nited supplies. One example is the World Health\nOrganization's (WHO) pilot program called SMS for\nLife (http://www.rbm.who.int/psm/smsWhatIsIt.html),\nwhich aims to improve the distribution of malaria\ndrugs in Tanzania's rural areas at the health facility\nlevel. Demand for antimalarial drugs is highly unpre-\ndictable. Such drugs cost as much as US$ 10 per course,\nwhich is prohibitively expensive for most Tanzanians\nA creative feature of the process is that front-line\nworkers from every clinic send an SMS with their\nstock count every week. Based on the figures sent by\nthe clinics, senior coordinating staff can determine an\nappropriate target restocking level at a given clinic to\nmake sure that no stock-out occurs. The WHO\nreported highly encouraging results. The proportion\nof clinics with no stock of at least one antimalarial\nmedicine decreased from 78% to 26%. In one of the\nthree districts, stock-outs were completely eliminated\nby week 8 of the pilot (Newton, 2012). It is worth\nnoting that the data used in SMS for Life is not as\nbig as that of the EWEC initiative. Nonetheless, by\naggregating and cross-referencing data sets collected\nfrom a number of clinics and other sources, the pro-\ngram has been able to improve the distribution of mal-\naria drugs. According to Boyd and Crawford's (2012)\ndefinition, the data used in SMS for Life can be con-\nsidered as BD for development.\nPotential impacts of BD in enhancing transparency\nThe above discussion indicates BD's potential socioe-\nconomic impacts in a number of domains and sectors.\nAmong the major impacts we may point out the BD-led\npromotion of transparency and accountability. Note\nthat transparency involves making information about\nan entity's operations, structures, and other attributes\navailable to the public (Finel and Kristin, 1999; Heald,\n2006). Transparency has gained wide support among\nstate decision-making bodies, international organiza-\ntions, and private companies (Finel and Kristin, 1999).\nGovernments can increase transparency by making\ninformation available to the public. For instance, the\nUS government's launch of the website Data.gov in\n2009, which makes statistical information collected by\nTable 3. Relevance of BD dimensions in EWEC's analysis of social media posts.\nCharacteristic Explanation in the EWEC context\nVolume The EWEC team analyzed about 14 million Tweets.\nVelocity Utilization of user-generated digital content and Crimson Hexagon's analytical tool led to faster analysis and\ndecision-making.\nVariety The analysis involved structured data such as the dates of Twitter posts and unstructured data such as Twitter texts\nfor the relevant keywords.\nVariability There was a sharp increase in Tweets containing the keywords identified by the EWEC team during key events such\nas World Aids Day, Mothers Day, International Women's Day and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nsummits.\nComplexity Combining the Tweet data with data from other sources (e.g. Facebook posts) might offer further insights and\nunderstanding of the EWEC initiatives and validate the results.\nover 50 federal agencies available to the public, is con-\nsidered as an important transparency measure (Etzioni,\n2010). Among developing economies, Kenya is prob-\nably the most spectacular example in making data\navailable to the public and facilitating the use of BD.\nIn 2011, Kenya launched an Open Data Portal (ODP)\nwith the help of the World Bank. The project received\nsupport at the highest levels of the government. The\ndata in the ODP includes a full digital edition of the\nhousehold income surveys, and data about the location\nof schools and health facilities.\nA popular version of the theory of transparency is\nthat, thanks to their purchasing power, consumers play\na key role in controlling the economy by choosing the\nbusinesses that are likely to succeed or fail (Sirgy and\nSu, 2002). In order to exercise their power, consumers\nlike to have information about the attributes of the\ngoods they purchase. Manufacturers thus provide\ninformation such as caloric value, types, and levels of\nvitamins in the labels of food items in a product.\nAccording to the transparency theory, this disclosure\nenables consumers to make informed choices and\nreward the businesses that provide the preferred prod-\nucts. This practice puts business disregarding con-\nsumers' preferences at a disadvantage (Sirgy and Su,\n2002). In this paper's context, developed country-\nbased firms are in a strong position to exercise their\npower over farmers from developing countries. The\nuse of BD forces farmers to use less pesticide, which\nis likely to help them enhance the quality of their prod-\nucts and stay competitive. As noted earlier, the avail-\nability of digital records of farming activities plays a\nmajor role in documenting quality standards of agricul-\ntural products.\nApart from the obvious direct economic effects, the\nuse of BD is also associated with a number of non-\neconomic benefits. Strengthening transparency by\nmaking information public would help monitor and\ndiscipline office-holders and fight corruption (O'Neill,\nstrictly we are watched, the better we behave''.\nInitiatives such as Kenya's ODP can thus be seen as a\nkey factor in strengthening the performance of govern-\nment and public administration in developing\ncountries.\nPrior research indicates that transparency is likely to\nbe more useful when the level of information costs is\nlower (Etzioni, 2010). In this regard, the rapidly falling\ncosts of collecting, processing, storing, and transmitting\ndata and information are likely to play major roles in\npromoting transparency and accountability in the\npublic and the private sectors. This benefit is especially\nstronger for small- and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) engaged in exporting products.\nOpportunities and challenges of using\nBD: The case of agriculture and farming\nactivities\nOne of the most important benefits of BD can be in\nimproving agricultural productivity. This effect is likely\nto have tremendous developmental benefits as the agri-\ncultural sector employs over 60% of the active labor\nforce in SSA economies (Oluoch-Kosura, 2010).\nAccording to the UNCTAD's World Investment\nwere undernourished, and 65 countries faced ``serious''\nor ``alarming'' danger of food shortages and famine.\nStudies have suggested that ineffective farm operations\nsuch as late planting/weeding, the lack of proper land\npreparation and harvesting techniques, and poor hous-\ning and feeding for livestock can reduce smallholder\nfarmers' productivity by up to 40% (Oluoch-Kosura,\n2010). BD has a potential to improve this condition.\nAccording to Monsanto, the world's biggest seed com-\npany, tailoring information and advice to farmers could\nincrease annual world-wide crop production by about\nSome argue that BD is the source of the next revo-\nlution in farming (Bunge, 2014). An overview of the\ndeployment of BD in industrialized countries would\nbe helpful for how the condition can be improved in\ndeveloping countries. On this front, precision agricul-\nture or precision farming has been a key trend in indus-\ntrialized countries. Data collected on soil conditions,\nseeding rates, crop yields, and other variables from\nfarmers' tractors, combines, and drones is combined\nwith detailed records on historic weather patterns, top-\nography, and crop performance collected by the pro-\nviders of prescriptive-planting technology (Bunge,\nto perform tasks involving decision problems and pro-\ncesses for which no algorithm exists or the algorithm\nhas not yet been developed. In some cases, due to\nunknowns no algorithm can solve all instances of the\nproblem. In agriculture, some examples of situations\ninclude tasks involving unknown soil types, and\nextreme weather conditions, which often need to be\nperformed by humans rather than algorithms. The\ndata is thus crunched by algorithms and human experts\nand turned into customized useful advice and is sent\ndirectly to farmers and their machines, instructing\nthem as to the optimum amount of pesticides, herbi-\ncides, fertilizer, and other applications.\nMany tractors and combines are guided by global\npositioning system satellites. An article published in\nusatoday.com explained that a corn and soybean\nthe yield in his 900 acre farm is affected by changes in\ntopography and other factors (Doering, 2014). This\n10 Big Data & Society\nexample is illustrative of a widespread adoption and\ndiffusion of BD in the agriculture sector in industria-\nlized countries. Many farmers who have implemented\ndata-driven prescriptive planting based on the analysis\nof nutrients in soil and other factors have reported a\nsignificant increase in productivity (Bunge, 2014). The\npoint is that even small alterations in planting depth or\nthe distance between rows of crops can lead to a sig-\nnificant increase in agricultural productivity.\nThe diffusion of BD is associated with and facilitated\nby measures taken by the providers of prescriptive-\nplanting technology to strengthen their resources\nand capabilities. In 2013, Monsanto acquired the\nweather-data-mining firm Climate Corp. Likewise, the\nagricultural cooperative Land O'Lakes bought satellite-\nimaging specialist Geosys. In the same vein, in order to\nprovide real-time climate and market information to its\ndata service users, DuPont announced collaboration\nwith the weather-and-market analysis firm DTN/The\nProgressive Farmer. In 2013, Deere agreed to send\ndata from its tractors, combines, and other machinery\nto the computer servers of DuPont and Dow (Bunge,\nDeveloping world-based small farmers face several\nkey challenges. Studies conducted in Sri Lanka and\nother countries have indicated that farmers are not\nable to sell harvests due to oversupply or not getting\nthe planned harvest, and the lack of necessary informa-\ntion (Walisadeer et al., 2013). BD can help address this\nproblem.\nNutrient management is another area where BD may\nbe relevant. In Africa, outdated knowledge is pervasive\nand ubiquitous in recommendations for nutrient man-\nagement. This often leads to too much fertilizer in rela-\ntion to potential crop demand and on a uniform basis\nirrespective of the type of land (Giller et al., 2011). A\nmodel-based and data-driven approach is thus likely to\nreduce the costs of fertilizer and increase productivity.\nA further area in which BD might have potential to\nfacilitate agricultural and farming activities in develop-\ning countries relates to the availability of near-real-time\ndata and information regarding farmers' needs and cap-\nabilities, which can be used by value chain partners to\neffectively serve the farmers. One example, as noted ear-\nlier, is the cloud-based platform AgriLife, which is\naccessible via mobile phone. It is used for collecting\ndata and analyzing farmers' production capability and\nhistory. In order to ensure fast, easy and efficient avail-\nability of resources and services to distant, rural farmers,\nthe platform also acts as an integration point for finan-\ncial institutions, mobile network operators, produce\nbuyers, and their agents (Yeoman, 2013). The data ana-\nlysis provides a better understanding of small farmers'\nneeds and production capability. Service providers can\ntailor their offerings such as crop insurance, input\npayments, and savings accounts based on the data\n(Yeoman, 2013). Uganda's Farmers Centre (FACE)\nwas an early adopter of AgriLife. FACE started upload-\ning information on its 10,000 farmer clients, who travel\nlong distances to purchase inputs and aggregate their\nproduce at FACE warehouses for processing/sale.\nBefore using AgriLife, FACE collected information by\npaper-based questionnaires. Small farmers' transaction\ndata would help them build a credit history, which is\nused by value-chain actors to provide credit and other\nresources such as seeds, fertilizers, and pest-control\nAs mentioned earlier, as of September 2013,\nAgriLife facilitated over US$ 2 million in revolving\nand Uganda. The AgriLife platform is also being used\nin Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Senegal (G-Analytix, 2013).\nPrior researchers have recognized that developing\nworld-based farmers face difficulties in meeting the\nquality and safety standards set by the developed\nworld (Oluoch-Kosura, 2010). In this regard, the avail-\nability of easily accessible data that include digital rec-\nords of farming activities such as the amounts of seeds\nand pesticides will obviously play a major role in docu-\nmenting quality standards of agricultural products. It\nwould be interesting to assess the above examples\nrelated to the use of data in farming activities in\ndeveloping countries in terms of BD dimensions.\nObviously, higher volume of data on farming activities\nis available than in the past. For instance, data such as\nfarmers' credit history and the amounts of seeds and\npesticides used was not available in the pre BD-envir-\nonment. As to the data speed, near-real-time data and\ninformation on farmers' needs and capabilities are\navailable. This means that financial institutions, pro-\nduce buyers, and other relevant actors can fulfill farm-\ners' needs more quickly than in the past. Regarding the\nvariety, most data currently used in farming-related\nactivities is structured data. Such data can be combined\nwith unstructured data. For instance, farmers can\nupload pictures and videos related to a problem they\nare facing, which can be analyzed by experts to offer\ncustomized advice.\nIn one way, TNCs are likely to be a driving force\nbehind the diffusion of BD in the agricultural sector of\ndeveloping countries. Large food and biotechnology\nTNCs such as Monsanto and Syngenta already have\na notable presence in developing countries, which is a\npositive factor from the standpoint of BD-led product-\nshare of agriculture in foreign direct investment (FDI)\n(UNCTAD, 2009). Monsanto reportedly has control\nof over 95% of the Indian cotton seed market (Vidal,\n2011). TNCs, which are often producers, processors, or\ntraders of agricultural products or sellers of inputs or\nmachinery, engage in a contracting system in which\nthey assume a variety of responsibilities including pro-\nviding technical assistance and marketing to developing\nsuch as Monsanto and Syngenta, which have become a\ndriving force behind the utilization of BD in the indus-\ntrialized world, are thus likely to act as a key channel in\nthe international technology transfer of BD.\nA related point is that international technology\ntransfer in BD is likely to have differential effects\nacross different categories of crops. For instance, for-\neign companies are more active in newly emerging\nexport crops, which are integrated into the inter-\nnational supply chain. Traditional cash crops such as\ncoffee, cotton, tea, and tobacco are thus more likely to\nrealize the need to adopt various aspects of BD\nOther potential mechanisms and determinants of BD\ndiffusion among farmers also exist. For instance,\nOluoch-Kosura (2010) reported that NGOs, farmers'\norganizations, and the private sector in Africa are play-\ning important roles in facilitating farmers' education,\naccess to agricultural information, and training.\nInternational supply chain structures often tend to\nexclude smallholder farmers. In Mozambique, farmers,\nwho are engaged in contract farming, pool resources to\nget technical advice and other services. More than\nland each are reported to benefit from such arrange-\nCritical challenges and issues\nAgainst the backdrop of rapid diffusion of BD among\nbig farmers in industrialized countries, a comparison of\ntheir BD ecosystems with those of developing countries\nwould be helpful to understand critical challenges and\nproblems in the effective utilization of BD for develop-\nmental issues. First, and perhaps most important, agri-\nculture firms in the industrialized world have a long\nhistory of data production and consumption. For\ninstance, DuPont has been making use of farm-level\nis increasingly common for farmers to monitor the pro-\ngress of their agricultural activities on iPads and tab-\nlets. In industrialized countries, firms in diverse\nindustries such as satellite-imaging, weather-data-\nmining, and weather-and-market analysis have enabled\na rich ecosystem of BD.\nWhile large growers can afford specialized machi-\nneries, small farmers are not in a position to do so\n(Glover, 1987). The conditions that stimulated the\ngrowth of BD in the US farming industry such as the\nwidespread adoption of mechanized tractors,\ngenetically modified seeds, computers, and tablets for\nfarming activities are less prevalent in developing coun-\ntries. Most smallholders in developing countries are not\nin a position to do so. Smallholder farmers often have\nno means to access the data and cannot interpret it. A\nmain concern is that BD collection efforts will only\nbenefit big and well-educated farmers (Palmer, 2012).\nAccurate and actionable data require considerable\ntechnical skills to handle data mining and analysis\nmethod and system. The lack of human resources and\nexpertise represents another major barrier to the imple-\nmentation of BD projects. Even industrialized countries\nsuch as those in European Union (EU) economies have\nreported a huge skills shortage for data-related man-\npower (Kroes, 2013). Data scientists are both in short\nsupply and expensive to employ in SSA economies\n(WEF, 2012). Most of the top BD companies are\nfrom the industrialized world and developing competi-\ntive indigenous companies in the BD area is not an easy\ntask for developing countries. The EU competition\ncommissioner Neelie Kroes noted that of the top 20\nglobal BD companies, 17 are from the US and two\nfrom Europe (Kroes, 2013). Another study suggested\nthat of the 15 most powerful BD companies, 14 were\nUS-based and one was Europe-based (Korolov, 2013).\nIt is argued that the highest performance computers are\nunaffordable even to a member of the EU (Kroes,\nAs an upshot of the above discussion, there is a lack\nof appropriate database systems for agribusiness devel-\nopment, agriculture management, and produce distri-\nbution. A BD attempt is greatly hampered by the lack\nof reliable infrastructure to collect information.\nConsider, for instance, climate-related historical data.\nAfrican countries have limited capacity to develop, gen-\nerate, disseminate, and effectively use climate data and\ninformation (Twomlow et al., 2008). National institu-\ntions, leadership, and the civil society are inherently\nweak and cannot determine the types of climate data\nand information needed for agriculture and other eco-\nnomic activities. Among the problems faced by policy-\nmakers and practitioners to work more effectively to\nrespond to climate changes and other climate related\neffects concern extremely low number of meteorological\nstations for climate data collection and the lack of digit-\nization of the data (United Nations Framework\nAs another example, the lack of information has\nbeen a main barrier to an effective implementation of\nhealthcare systems. For instance, while there is a rising\nprevalence of diabetes in Indonesia, there is no data\navailable to measure the effects beyond intermediate\noutcomes such as the number of people trained; per-\ncentage of health centers providing education; or devel-\nopment of training material and guidelines (e.g.\n12 Big Data & Society\ntraining's impact on detection rate and outcomes and\nscreening's impact on complications) (Soewondo et al.,\nFarmers are concerned about the potential misuse of\ninformation at the firm level related to their farming\nactivities and at the industry level. For instance, the\ntrade group American Farm Bureau Federation\n(AFBF) warned its members that seed companies' pre-\nscriptive planting programs have vested interests in\nhigher crop yields associated with BD's use (Bunge,\n2014). Big agricultural firms such as Monsanto might\ninfluence farmers to buy specific seeds, sprays, and\nequipment and are likely to profit from the costs of\ntheir services and higher seed sales (Seppala, 2014).\nThe gathering of data from sensors on tractors, com-\nbines, and other farm equipment by large seed compa-\nnies is receiving the same level of attention as\nimmigration reform and water regulations (fox-\nnews.com, 2014). Another key concern that farmers\nhave expressed is that their data and information\ncould be used by competitors. For example, other farm-\ners' access to the crop-yield information may create\ndirect and unwanted competition to rent farmland,\nwhich may cause a new spike in land values and seed\nprices (Bunge, 2014). The issue regarding who owns\nfarmers' crop data is also of equal concern (Seppala,\nAnother fear is that Wall Street traders could use the\ndata to make bets that could hurt the farmers. For\ninstance, if conditions early in the growing season\nlead to lower futures contract prices, it may reduce\nthe profits farmers could have made from crops by\nlocking into sell the futures (Bunge, 2014). Likewise,\nfarmers are concerned that hedge funds or big compa-\nnies might use real-time data at harvest time from a\nlarge number of combines to speculate in commodity\nmarkets long before official crop-production estimates\nare available (foxnews.com, 2014). This fear has some\nfoundation as the developments in BD technologies\nmake it possible to do so. For instance, a group at\nthe MIT Media Lab used location data from mobile\nphones to estimate the number of people in Macy's\nparking lots on Black Friday. The estimate made it\npossible to estimate the retailer's sales on that day\neven before Macy's had recorded those sales. Insights\nlike this are expected to provide competitive advantage\nto Wall Street analysts and managers (McAfee and\nIn the developing world's context, an even bigger\nquestion than that of whether agricultural productivity\ncan be improved using BD is who is likely to benefit\nfrom the BD-led growth in productivity. One possibility\nis that agricultural productivity associated with BD\nutilization in developing countries may provide benefits\nprimarily to foreign companies. This is because while a\nnumber of positive outcomes of agricultural TNCs'\noperation in developing countries have been recorded,\nthere are also possible negative effects such as the\npotential abuse of their market power and dominant\nposition. One estimate suggested that foreign investors\nacquired (or sought) about 15\u00ad20 million hectares of\n(UNCTAD, 2009). The increasing globalization of\nagriculture and the food chain means that industria-\nlized world-based agricultural giants may expand such\nactivities globally.\nSecurity and privacy issues associated with BD have\nattained at least some degree of institutionalization in\nindustrialized countries, which is a small comfort for\nthe farmers (Kshetri, forthcoming). Most industrialized\ncountries have more well-developed regulations related\nto data privacy and security. They also have industry\nstandards, company-specific guidelines, and perform-\nance measures. For instance, US-based food and agri-\ncultural companies such as Monsanto, DuPont, and\nother corporations claim that they do not use data\nfor purposes other than providing services requested\nby farmers, keep the data secure and do not sell it\n(foxnews.com, 2014). Some companies get consent\nfrom customers before sharing their data. The AFBF\nhas put together a ``privacy expectation guide'' to edu-\ncate its members. In addition, it has drafted a policy\nwhich has emphasized that data should remain the\nfarmer's property (foxnews.com, 2014). Some US farm-\ners are reportedly contemplating a new initiative to\naggregate data on their own so that they can decide\nthe type of information to sell and at an appropriate\nprice. Other farmers are teaming up with smaller tech-\nnology companies in order to challenge the domination\nof big agricultural giants in the prescriptive-planting\nbusiness (Bunge, 2014). Many developing countries\ncurrently have no regulatory safeguard in place to pro-\ntect farmers and citizens from possible data misuse.\nThis means that BD-related issues are being considered\nin a setting of nascent institutionalization. Farmers in\ndeveloping countries are even more prone to exploit-\nation by big businesses.\nDiscussion and implications\nEach generation has access to more information and\nexperiences more information overload compared to\nthe preceding generation (Blair, 2003). However, a\nkey feature of the recent information revolution is\nthat developing economies are experiencing a rapid\nexplosion of data and information due primarily to a\nwidespread diffusion of cellphones and social media in\nthese economies. If history is any guide, this explosion\nis likely to change the ways individuals and organiza-\ntions act and interact. In an analysis of the effects of\ninformation overload from the 16th to the 18th century,\nBlair (2003) found that the availability of more infor-\nmation led to the diffusion and development of various\nlearning aids and tools and also affected the way scho-\nlars worked. It is thus reasonable to expect that BD is\nlikely to have a profound impact on development-\nrelated activities such as agriculture and healthcare\nand related decision-making processes.\nBD may have different meaning and significance for\nthe purpose of development. For instance, BD applica-\ntions in developing countries may not necessarily\ninvolve petabytes of data as used by TNCs such as\neBay and Walmart. They may also be characterized\nby relatively lesser variety of data. Likewise, as to the\nvelocity dimension, a data-processing time of several\nmonths may be considered fast enough.\nBD is being used to understand and respond to\nimportant development issues such as water supply,\nfood security, human health, conservation of natural\nresources, and protection against natural hazards. The\nabove discussion makes it clear that while social media\nactivities have important social aspects and conse-\nquences, SM data also has at least some economic\nimportance. There have recently been some encoura-\nging developments in the utilization of BD in improving\nfarmers' livelihood and access to services. The cases of\nAgriLife and other initiatives indicate that BD has pro-\nmoted better functioning of the market.\nExperts have emphasized the importance of assess-\ning organizations' ``information supply chain to iden-\ntify and prioritize data management issue'' (Laney,\n2001: 2). This is also relevant to development-related\ndata. Data in different contexts may come from differ-\nent combinations of sources. The composition and\nstructure of the data may differ across economies.\nAmong developing countries, Indonesia has the most\nTwitter users (Richter, 2013). More Tweets come from\nJakarta than from New York, Tokyo, London, or Sa\n~ o\nPaulo (Florida, 2012). In Kenya, the mobile money\ntransfer is extremely popular and could serve as an\nimportant data source (Kaplan, 2013; UN Global\nPulse, 2013b). Sixty-eight percent of Kenyan cellphone\nusers regularly use their phones to make or receive pay-\nThere is likely to be a wide variation across eco-\nnomic activities and industries in the level of the diffu-\nsion of BD. Even within an industry, differences in the\ndiffusion of BD are likely to be significant. For\ninstance, in the agricultural industry, cash crops that\nare integrated in the modern supply chain are likely\nto see the impacts of BD sooner.\nSeveral important lessons can be drawn from the\nsuccessful examples. Initiatives in industrialized coun-\ntries to develop a BD ecosystem should be instructive\nfor gaining an understanding of BD's impact on\ndevelopment. The US Department of Agriculture, for\ninstance, announced the launch of a portal on the\nData.gov website, which links to 348 agriculture data\nPrior researchers have suggested that social and\nother forms of supports from more experienced users\nare likely to promote technical competence of new users\n(DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001). In this regard, multi-\nnational companies and international agencies may act\nas key forces in providing such supports to facilitate\nBD diffusion in developing economies.\nPolitical as well as economic factors are of crucial\nimportance in determining the distribution of benefits\nFarmers who are able to mobilize and organize them-\nselves (e.g. in cooperatives or other forms of groups)\nmay increase their bargaining power vis-a-vis TNCs\nbased in industrialized countries.\nThe conditions in developing countries provide\nlimited incentives to encourage the public and private\nsectors to invest in the creation of relevant database.\nIt is important to develop means to make usable and\nrelevant knowledge available to smallholder farmers in\na timely manner. Data accessibility is more challenging\nin developing countries. In light of the usefulness of\nclimate-related data as noted above, for instance,\nmore investment into climate observation networks is\nneeded. Historical and projected data on climatic con-\nditions would be of great help to farmers. While the\ncreation of a database that is completely customized\nto meet the need of every field and every farm may\nnot be feasible in the short run, making information\navailable regarding a basis for even a broad categoriza-\ntion (e.g. soil type) can be of great help. For instance,\nin Kenya and Zimbabwe, while a wide heterogeneity\nexists among farms, they can be arguably reduced\ninto three categories in relation to a response to fertil-\nizers: (1) fertile fields unresponsive to fertilizers, which\nrequire only maintenance fertilization; (2) intermediate\nfields highly-responsive to fertilizers, which require\nmanaging fertilizers efficiently; and (3) infertile fields\nunresponsive to fertilizers, which may require complete\nrestoration and rehabilitation (Giller et al., 2011).\nProviding advice and guidance to farmers based on\nthe responsiveness to fertilizers of their farms is\nlikely to lead to a more appropriate management of\nfertilizer use.\nRegarding the observation that high-performance\ncomputers may be unaffordable to utilize BD effect-\nively, it is important to note an encouraging trend:\nthe diffusion of cloud computing in developing econo-\nmies. These economies are experiencing dramatic and\nsignificant cloud-led socio-economic transformations\nentered in developing markets and some high-profile\n14 Big Data & Society\nentrepreneurial firms are emerging in the cloud's supply\nside in these economies. This means that individuals\nand businesses in developing countries can effectively\nutilize BD by renting storage and computing power\nfrom the clouds.\nDespite the optimistic promises that some consult-\nants and development experts have made regarding the\ndevelopmental and practical applications of BD\nshould not be viewed as a panacea and the answer to\nall the many and varied problems facing the developing\nworld. There is a need to fully assess availability,\nappropriateness, and effectiveness of BD in addressing\ndevelopment challenges. There are only limited types of\ndata that can be found for most developing economies\n(e.g. related to Tweets in Indonesia and mobile money\ntransfer data in Kenya). Data unavailability thus\nremains a major challenge, which, according to Boyd\nand Crawford (2012) has led to a new form of digital\ndivide. While appropriate analysis of BD may provide\nvaluable insights and information for key policy areas,\ngreat care must be taken to ensure that data quality\nstandards are satisfied and appropriate methodological\nsteps have been taken. For instance, the use of Twitter\nAPI data has been criticized on the grounds that it\nsuffers from questionable quality and serious methodo-\nlogical challenges such as samples of unknown repre-\nsentativeness, a lack of one-to-one correspondence\nbetween accounts and users and proliferation of\nTweets created by bots (Boyd and Crawford, 2012;\nIt is important to discuss the above problems in the\ncontext of transparency. Whereas transparency is\nessential to ensure reliability and validity, BD created\nthrough the use of social media is often produced by\ncommercial organizations' closed structures (Driscoll\npointing out the fact that Twitter engages in censorship,\nhas argued that users have displayed a ``misplaced\nfaith'' in Twitter Trends, and has urged them to stop\n``worshiping algorithms''.\nThere are also important privacy and ethical issues\ninvolved around BD. Acquisti and Gross (2009)\nshowed that combination of public databases can lead\nto serious privacy violations such as revelation of indi-\nviduals' social security number and other sensitive\ninformation. What is particularly relevant in the con-\ntext of this paper, as noted earlier, is that some analysts\nhave a tendency to criticize some uses of BD in indus-\ntrialized countries on the ground that it is a surveillance\ntool. On the other hand, these analysts' view is that\npeople in developing countries do not need privacy.\nSome have challenged this view and pointed out that\npoor people have no less reason than rich people\nto be worried about surveillance (linnettaylor, 2013).\nMoreover, in countries characterized by conflict,\ncrisis, and weak law enforcement, the privacy challenge\nmay be a security risk (Letouze\nmalicious actor reportedly can sell a database contain-\ning a specific type of information, for instance, phone\nnumbers, for more than US$ 1500 on the black market.\nThe illegal companies, in turn, charge their clients\nas private investigation, illegal debt collection, asset\ninvestigation, and even kidnapping (Yan, 2012).\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations of this paper must be recognized.\nFirst, some of the main arguments presented here rely\non the reports of companies which are consultants or\nleading suppliers of BD-related solutions (e.g.\nMonsanto, Gartner, Cisco, and McKinsey) and devel-\nopmental agencies promoting BD (e.g. Global Pulse).\nThese companies may have vested interests in promot-\ning the diffusion of BD and thus may overemphasize\nthe positive aspects of BD. An additional limitation of\nthis research is that it covered only materials published\nin the English language.\nPolicy implications\nThe above discussion suggests some important policy\nimplications which stress the need to emphasize the\nenrichment of the BD ecosystem and to ensure that\nappropriate regulations aimed at encouraging organiza-\ntions' BD adoption in activities with positive social and\neconomic contributions and outcomes are in place. Due\nto the public goods nature of data, organizations that\ninvest in data collection cannot necessarily reap all the\nbenefits. While some statistics are gathered several\ntimes in different ways, others are rarely or never col-\nlected (adb.org, 2013). Appropriate incentives are\nneeded to collect relevant data and overcome the frag-\nmentation among the governments and organizations\ncollecting development-related data.\nThe government is a key actor that can drive the BD\necosystem. Civic organizations, mobile app developers,\nand media groups are using the data available at\nKenya's ODP to improve understanding of population\npatterns and transparency of public services (WEF,\n2012). Governments and international agencies need\nto support the expansion of initiatives such as\nKenya's ODP in areas such as agriculture.\nIt is especially necessary to introduce policies, pro-\ncedures, and interventions to ensure the privacy and\nconfidentiality of sensitive data. To return to the\nKenya example above, the ODP was put in place\nwithout appropriate legal frameworks in key areas\nsuch as protections for data reuse (WEF, 2012).\nWhile Kenya's constitution guarantees openness, trans-\nparency, and participation, which facilitated the ODP's\nestablishment, many authoritarian regimes lack such an\nenvironment.\nData consumption and exchange are no less import-\nant than data production and analysis. Some argue that\nthe consumption of free data such as time spent on\nsocial media and on cellphones may provide a ``con-\nsumer surplus'' not captured in official statistics\n(Letouze\n\u00b4 , 2013). The utilization of BD in key develop-\nment areas hinges critically upon the availability of\nmanpower with BD competency. It is thus important\nfor national governments and international agencies to\ndirect more efforts towards developing BD manpower.\nGuidelines, interventions, supports, and incentives\nare needed to encourage sharing existing data. In this\nregard, much of the valuable data that is relevant for\nthe development context is often with the private\nsector. For instance, networks of mobile phone oper-\nators have data related to text messages, digital-cash\ntransactions, and location data. In some cases, the gov-\nernment owns these companies. One way to enrich the\nBD ecosystem would be to persuade these organiza-\ntions to make the relevant data available (Lohr,\n2013). Universities and research centers also constitute\na key source of data and knowledge. It is argued that\nscientists working in these institutes are against making\nrelevant data accessible due to security, privacy, and\nother concerns. They often use reasoning against data\nsharing, such as: ``I don't want to share it'', ``it's mine''\nor ``It's government property'' (Patel, 2013). Analysts\nhave stressed the importance of providing incentives to\nindividuals to share information such as pricing/offers\nand improved services. It is also important to develop\nprivacy standards and ``opt out'' ability (WEF, 2012).\nFinally, for national governments and international\nagencies such as the UN or the World Bank, it is critical\nto engage in new and more comprehensive collabor-\nation with the private sector in order to facilitate the\ndiffusion and effective uses of BD in developing coun-\ntries. Here we introduce the concept of ``Data\nPhilanthropy'', which is likely to play a key role in\nthe diffusion of BD in developing countries (Pawelke\nand Tatevossian, 2013). This idea emerged at the WEF\nin Davos in 2011. The basic idea behind Data\nPhilanthropy is simple: it involves a partnership in\nwhich businesses share data for public benefit. Data\nPhilanthropy is described as the ``next movement in\ncharitable giving and corporate citizenship'' (Coren,\n2011). Data donated by corporations and governments\ncan be used to track diseases, avoid economic crises,\nand aid development. While a huge amount of data is\nheld by businesses, they are reluctant to distribute it\neven anonymously, due primarily to privacy concerns\n(Coren, 2011). It is thus important for national\ngovernments and international agencies to work closely\nwith businesses such as Twitter and Facebook, which\nhave large amounts of data, and encourage them to\nengage in Data Philanthropy.\nConcluding comments\nThe data being used in a number of developmental pur-\nposes can be considered as BD. Preliminary evidence\nindicates that BD is likely to help better utilize the\nscarce resources and can help deal with the various\nsources of inefficiency that have been frequently cited\nby critics as among the key obstacles for development\nin developing countries. For instance, BD can help to\nreduce the waste of inputs such as fertilizer and increase\nagricultural productivity and control the epidemics of\nvarious diseases.\nUses of BD that lead to positive social and economic\noutcomes and those that benefit socially and econom-\nically disadvantaged groups need to be promoted.\nResponsible uses of BD also require protecting people's\ndignity and legitimate expectations of privacy and eco-\nnomic interests. For instance, among the key lessons\nfrom the overview of risks to farmers over possible\nmisuse of data and information in industrialized coun-\ntries, these concerns are even more pronounced due to\nthe lack of data protection regulations in developing\ncountries. Moreover, most farmers in developing coun-\ntries lack the degree of self-awareness and organization\nthat can be observed among some industrialized world-\nbased farmers. For instance, while farming groups in\nindustrialized countries are taking measures to protect\nagainst misuse and exploitation of their data, such\nmeasures are lacking in developing countries.\nBD obviously offers a number of potential benefits\nand vast possibilities in developed economies.\nNevertheless, developing economies are at a nascent\nstage and far from a full utilization of the great poten-\ntial of BD. Benefiting from BD requires a drastically\ndifferent approach. In order to overcome barriers\nrelated to BD adoption, policymakers should ensure\nvarious enabling conditions for the creation, availabil-\nity, and use of data. The lack of BD-related skills and\ncompetency underscores the importance of moving the\nfocus beyond the numbers of technological devices to\nthe strengthening of national technological capacity to\nuse BD.\nBD has not yet been a priority of policy issue for\nmost of the donor agencies nor has this issue been\nclosely tied to national development strategies. While\nmany organizations and data collection process in\nindustrialized countries constitute a rich ecosystem\nand serve a wide variety of functions needed to achieve\nvarious goals, most developing countries lack such\necosystems. It would be critical for the developing\n16 Big Data & Society\nworld's governments to get support from key stake-\nholders such as researchers, international agencies, soft-\nware makers, data intensive sectors, and venture\ncapitalists to create and utilize relevant, development-\nrelated data and information. Collaboration and\ncooperation among these stakeholders are essential to\nfoster a data ecosystem for development. Creation of\nappropriate databases may stand out as particularly\nappealing and promising to some entrepreneurial\nfirms. Governments, businesses, and individuals are\nwilling to pay for data when they perceive the value\nof such data in helping them make better decisions.\nIn the meantime, policymakers, academics, and other\nstakeholders should make the most of what is available.\n"
