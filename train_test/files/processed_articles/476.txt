In the European\nPRATIK study, those with higher vs. lower CVD risk were less\nlikely to be controlled for HTN as compared to those with\nHTN only.7 In addition, Fagard et al. have shown treatment\nmore likely in higher vs. lower risk subjects with HTN.8,9 More\nrecently, we showed among US adults with HTN those with vs.\nwithout CVD were more likely to be treated, but less likely to\nbe controlled for BP.10 Framingham risk scores (FRS)11 have\nbeen widely used to quantitative risk for CVD, but how global\nrisk varies in persons with HTN has not been described.\nThe updated FRS for total CVD11 provides an opportunity\nto (i) evaluate the distribution of global CVD risk in subjects\nwith HTN using a strategy that places emphasis on a subject's\nage, (ii) compare FRS algorithms with the European Society\nof Hypertension (ESH) risk stratification guidelines,12 which\nassess risk largely independent of age, and (iii) demonstrate\nwhere gaps may exist on the extent of treatment and control of\nHTN among different risk groups.\nMethods\nStudy sample.

BP was meas-\nured by standardized methodology using a mercury sphyg-\nmomanometer by a single NHANES medical examination\ncenter physician certified by a BP certification program taking\nthe average of up to four readings (all but the first are aver-\naged) while the subject was sitting. Detailed specimen and data\ncollection are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical\nTechnologists Procedures Manual (NHANES \nLaboratory Technologists Manual).13 Treatment was defined\nby self-report and from medication containers subjects brought\nin providing the name and class of any antihypertensive medi-\ncations. Nonpharmacologic treatment, including a low-fat\nand low-sodium diet and moderate/vigorous physical activity\nin the past 30 days was also recorded in NHANES, but is not\nincluded within the definition of \"treatment\" to be consistent\nwith other NHANES publications.5,10\nLow-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was calculated using\nthe Friedwald equation (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol =\ntotal cholesterol--high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-\nC) \u00ad (1/5) triglycerides) if triglycerides were under 400mg/dl.\nMetabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined by the presence of\n3 of the following: (i) waist circumference >102cm for men\nand >88cm for women, (ii) triglycerides 150mg/dl if fasting,\n(iii) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol <40mg/dl if male or\ntensive medications, and (v) fasting glucose level 100mg/\ndl and <126mg/dl (while glucose levels above this point are\nnormally included in the definition of MetS, we are includ-\ning these individuals within the DM group as noted below).14\nDM was defined as having a fasting glucose level 126mg/dl\nor nonfasting level of 200mg/dl, taking oral hypoglycemic\nmedication or insulin, or with self-reported DM. CKD was\ndefined as having a creatinine clearance of <60ml/min (stage\n3 or greater) using the MDRD formula: 186 \u00d7 (serum creati-\nblack).15 Besides CKD, pre-existing CVD included stroke,\nheart failure, coronary heart disease, or myocardial infarc-\ntion based on whether the participant was told by their doc-\ntor they had these conditions. No information on peripheral\narterial disease was available. Control of BP was defined as an\n<80mm Hg, respectively in persons with DM or CKD).\nThe 10-year risk of total CVD (including myocardial infarc-\ntion, angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, congestive\nheart failure, and peripheral arterial disease) was determined\nin those without known CVD according to FRS algorithms11\nincluding age, total and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol,\nSBP, treatment for HTN, DM, and cigarette smoking. Persons\nwere classified as <10% (low risk), 10\u00ad20% (intermediate risk),\nand >20% (high risk); those with pre-existing CVD or CKD\n(as defined above) were classified separately.\nWe also classified persons according to the ESH guidelines12\nwhich defines low risk (<10%) as having no other risk factors\n(risk factors defined as the following: Low-density lipoprotein-\ncholesterol 130mg/dl, current smoking, or low high-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, or impaired\nfasting glucose as defined above) other than grade 1 HTN (SBP\nadditional risk factors with grade 1 HTN or grade 2 HTN (SBP\ntors, high risk as having 3 risk factors other than HTN, MetS,\nor DM along with grade 1 or 2 HTN, or grade 3 HTN with no\nother risk factors, and very high risk for those with established\nCVD or CKD, or grade 3 HTN with at least one risk factor,\nMetS, or DM.\nData analysis. We compared the distribution of risk groups\nof treatment and lifestyle modifications by age (<45, 45\u00ad64,\nand 65 years), gender, and ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics). Among those with HTN\nusing the 2 test of proportions (and the Fisher's exact test in\ntables where cell sizes <5 existed). Among those on treatment,\nwe also examined across risk groups the proportion on differ-\nent medication classes and on single or multiple medications,\nas well as the proportion at overall, SBP and DBP goal. Finally,\nwe examined correlates of BP control using multiple logistic\nregression in a fixed model, including age, gender, ethnic-\nity, CVD comorbidities, other CVD risk factors and number\nof medications taken. First order interaction terms with age\nand gender were also tested. We additionally examined the\nconcordance/discordance between FRS and ESH-based risk\nclassification.\nSAS statistical software version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC) and SUDAAN software version 9.0.1 were used for anal-\nysis and computation of weighted estimates for projection to\nthe population of the United States.16,17 The  probability level\nset for statistical analyses was 0.05 (two-tailed). All estimates\npresented reflect the age, gender, and ethnicity population-\nweighted estimates.\nResults\n(weighted proportion) had prevalent CVD, of which 125\nhad CKD as defined above.

The poor control in high risk persons\nwas due principally to SBP not at goal; DBP was at goal 80%\nof the time in all subgroups.\nTable 4 shows the prevalence of use of specific medications as\nwell as number of medications according to risk group.

Also, HTN treatment was only modestly related\nto global risk. Finally, treatment rates were lowest among lower\nrisk men and Hispanics and highest in those with pre-existing\nCVD; however, control rates were actually best among lower\nrisk individuals but worst among higher risk persons. While\nthe FRS is influenced primarily by age; many younger persons\nat a calculated low or intermediate risk actually have cardio\nmetabolic risk factors (identified by the ESH approach) that\nwould place them at higher longer-term risk.\nOur reported 55% of HTN subjects at high risk based on FRS\n(66% by ESH criteria) is compares to an Italian study where\nabout 60% were at high or very high risk based on European\npatients with HTN found 43% to be a high or very high risk.\nAlso, among persons with isolated systolic HTN and diastolic\nthe latter to be at high or very high risk.8 With a greater extent\nof obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors among our\nHTN subjects, it is not surprising there may be more high risk\nindividuals in the United States.\nClinical strategies in initiating treatment for HTN\nOur treatment rates of 58\u00ad66% among lower to higher risk\npatients (75% in those with CVD) suggest global risk did not\ndramatically influence treatment rates; all included subjects\nwould have had indications for treatment by US guidelines.\nSuboptimal treatment rates may be attributed to many persons\nnot seeing their doctor recently, not taking medications as\nrecommended, or being just above the threshold where some\nphysicians may not want to prescribe medication until patients\nhave tried an adequate course of lifestyle. However, we found\nlifestyle modification efforts not to differ by treatment status\nexcept for a low-sodium diet being actually more common\namong treated persons. Moreover, among those with DM or\nCKD, treatment rates were similar regardless of BP category\n63% in those with stage 1 HTN), suggesting actual BP levels\nwere not a strong indicator of treatment.\nWe feel use of shorter-term FRS algorithms to classify risk\nundervalues lifetime risk and the ESH guidelines undervalue\nshorter-term risk in older adults, and that combining both\nstrategies may best identify those needing treatment. Of note,\nMarma et al.20 have previously shown among US adults free of\nrisk, two-thirds of these individuals are at high lifetime pre-\ndicted risk, thus supporting the concept that short-term risk\nTable 5| Logistic regression predicting likelihood of BP at goal\nBP, blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.\nvariables are included in a single model.\nTable6|Cross-classificationofEuropeanSocietyofHypertension(ESH)vs.FraminghamRiskScoring(FRS)assignmentofriskcategory\nof US adults with hypertension (n = 1,501)\n(), column %; [], row %; CVD, cardiovascular disease, including chronic kidney disease.\nPercentages in parenthesis are based on population-weighted data.\noriginal contributions Global Cardiovascular Risk in Hypertension\nalgorithms may dramatically underestimate long-term or life-\ntime risks. However, it is possible the use of both risk assess-\nment approaches could still result in overtreatment, thus the\ncost-effectiveness using both vs. either risk algorithm still\nneeds to be demonstrated; those at high risk identified by\ncombining FRS and ESH risk assessment approaches would\nhopefully motivate more aggressive treatment and presumably\nimproved health outcomes in these groups. Both approaches\nrely primarily on easily obtainable office-based measures and\na count of risk factors or points that can be obtained by most\nmedical office nursing and other staff.\nTreatment and control according to risk group\nWhile treatment of low risk persons (58% treated) is less\naggressive than high-risk persons (66\u00ad75% treated), among\nthose with CVD are only on monotherapy, a principal reason\nless than half of such high risk persons are at goal BP. Also,\ncompared to those at low risk, intermediate risk persons were\nat only half and higher risk persons at one-tenth the likelihood\nof being in control for HTN. Another reason for the poorer BP\ncontrol in higher risk and older persons is the greater preva-\nlence of having isolated systolic HTN where control of BP has\nbeen previously shown much poorer.9,10\nStrengths and limitations\nOur NHANES sample is representative of the US adult popu-\nlation from sample weighting methods; however, certain eth-\nnic groups, such as Asian-Americans were not classified. Our\nresults reflect the US adult population with HTN and should not\nbe extrapolated to non-US populations. Also, while treatment\nstatus was based on self-report, this was largely verified from\nreview of medication containers. Moreover, the FRS estimates of\nCVD risk are based on a limited set of CVD risk factors and do\nnot include DBP, family history, obesity, or other factors which\ncould impact on risk, and other measures such as carotid intimal\nmedial thicknesses, left ventricular hypertrophy, or other target\norgan damage were not available. Also, FRS was based on pri-\nmarily Caucasian cohorts, but robustness for use in other ethnic\ngroups has been validated.21 Finally, without follow-up data for\nclinical events in our study sample, we were unable to compare\nthe predictive validity of our two risk assessment approaches.\nIn summary, half of US persons aged 30 years with HTN are\nat high CVD risk or with known CVD and an additional one-\nfourth have other factors indicating high cardiometabolic risk,\nfor a total of 80% at high risk who may warrant therapy. While\nHTN treatment rates were lowest among lower risk persons\nand highest in those with pre-existing CVD, HTN control rates\nwere best among lower risk individuals but lowest among higher\nrisk persons. Future guidelines should consider risk stratifica-\ntion combining both shorter and longer-term risk assessment\napproaches to identify persons at highest CVD risk.\n"
