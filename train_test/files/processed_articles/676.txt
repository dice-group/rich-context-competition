Dansky, PhD, Diane Brannon, PhD, Dennis G. Shea, PhD,\nJoseph Vasey, PhD, and Riad Dirani, BS\nAre rural elders disadvantaged with regard to health\ncare services? Despite considerable improvements in\nhealth service delivery to rural communities, this ques-\ntion remains unanswered, in part due to conflicting\nreports on differences in health service use by rural\nand urban elderly persons (Comer & Mueller, 1995;\nRecent policy changes in both the private and public\nsectors have raised new concerns about access to care\nin rural locations. For example, the closure of rural\nhospitals (Coulam & Gaumer, 1991; Ricketts & Lambrew,\n1993) and shortened hospital lengths of stay (Mick &\nMorlock, 1990) indicate reduced access to and less\nuse of hospital services by the rural elderly. In addi-\ntion, studies of outpatient physician utilization show\nrural elderly residents receive approximately 20% fewer\nservices than urban elderly residents (Dor & Holahan,\nin reimbursement mechanisms have resulted in a cor-\nresponding increase in the provision of post-acute and\nchronic care services by home health agencies and\nskilled nursing facilities. This paradox suggests that the\nquestion of urban/rural differences in service use is\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the National\nInstitute on Aging Grant R01-AG11820 and of a pilot grant from the Cen-\nter on Aging and Health in Rural America (CAHRA) at The Pennsylvania\nState University.

This\napproach fails to capture the importance of the\nconstellation of services available to and used by in-\ndividuals; consequently, potential substitution or com-\nplement effects are ignored. In some cases, these\npatterns may be interpreted as access problems when\nthey simply reflect alternative methods of providing\ndesired services. This study focuses on the comple-\nmentary effects of each service.\nA second weakness is that researchers often rely\non simple geographical typologies that fail to capture\nimportant differences among rural residents and\ncommunities. Rural health service researchers have\nadvocated the use of multiple descriptive categories,\nrather than a simple urban/rural dichotomy, to cap-\nture unique characteristics of rural communities\n(Coward, McLaughlin, Duncan, & Bull, 1994).\nThe purpose of this study was to advance our un-\nderstanding of differences in health service use among\nthe elderly population by providing more accurate pro-\nfiles of elders in the context of multiple service use--\nhospital days, physician office visits, home health\nvisits and skilled nursing days. Combined, these ser-\nvices represent more than 80% of all health care\nspending for elderly adults. Using data from the Medi-\ncare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), we identify\ndifferences in service use across five geographical cat-\negories and describe profiles of use in each category.\nThese profile differentials have important policy and\npractice implications for improving service delivery to\nolder people.\nUrban and Rural Differences\nin Health Service Use\nHospital Care.--Data on hospital discharges\nshow changing patterns in hospital use. Norton and\nMedicare beneficiaries in rural areas had more dis-\ncharges per capita than urban residents, but recent\nstudies show no significant differences in hospital use\nbetween urban and rural residents (Himes & Rutrough,\npared to urban hospitals, have fewer beds (Moscovice,\nand shorter lengths of stay (Mick & Morlock, 1990).\nThese characteristics suggest economic constraints and\npressures that drive providers to seek less costly alter-\nnatives to inpatient care, a view supported by Dansky,\nMilliron, and Gamm (1996) who found that rural\nhospitals were more likely than urban hospitals to re-\nfer discharged patients to home health services. Com-\nbined, these studies suggest that rural hospitals treat\npatients who are older/but discharge the elderly pa-\ntients sooner than their urban counterparts.\nHome Health Care.--A financial incentive to dis-\ncharge patients earlier has increased the demand for\nhome nealth services. Studies report significant in-\ncreases in the number of referrals made to home health\nagencies for hospitalized Medicare patients over the\nand a home health population that requires increas-\ningly more intensive services (Rogers, 1989; Wood,\nFox, Estes, & Mahoney, 1986). The demand for home\nhealth care also increased following the Health Care\nFinancing Administration's revised definition of in-\ntermittent services (Bishop & Skwara, 1993). Finally,\nchanges in family structure have increased the demand\nfor home health services. In 1987, one in three eld-\nerly persons lived alone (Branch, Goldberg, Cheh, &\nWilliams, 1993); this number is expected to rise pro-\nportionally with increases in the aged population. Those\nliving alone are more likely to use some type of home\nhealth services (Altman & Walden, 1993).\nA literature review of studies published during the\nlast ten years indicates a lack of agreement on rural/\nurban differences in home health services. Gaumer\nhome visits per Medicare patient in rural areas, and\nAltman and Walden (1993) reported no differences\nby region or metropolitan area. By contrast, Kenney\n(1993) found that rural home health users received\nmore skilled nursing and home health aide visits than\ntheir urban counterparts, but fewer medical social ser-\nvice or therapeutic visits. Differences in the number\nand mix of services available have been shown to af-\nfect the utilization rates of home health care services\nare less likely to have a home health agency; when\nthey do, the agency is likely to be smaller and to sup-\nport less diversity in services than its urban counter-\nparts (Kenney & Dubay, 1990). Consequently, ther-\napy services (physical tnerapy, occupational tnerapy,\nspeech therapy) and social services are less available\nthan nursing services (skilled nursing and home health\naide).\nAlthough the differences in home health use be-\ntween rural and urban residents may be due to\naccess issues, differences may exist in the types of\npatients receiving service (Nyman, Sen, Chan, & Com-\nmins, 1991). The rural Medicare enrollee is more likely\nto receive care from an informal caregiver (Coward &\nCutler, 1989). The older age, greater functional limi-\ntations, greater risk of hospitalization and shorter length\nof hospital stay (Kenney, 1993) of the rural beneficiary\nmay increase the need for home health services. In\nan evaluation of hospitalization, intensity of service,\nlength of stay, and consumption of post-hospital ser-\nvices, Gaumer (1989) found that rural home health\ncare recipients more often mirrored the profile of a\npost-acute care patient while their urban counterparts\nmore often fit the use profile of the long-term care\npatient. However, the former may have difficulty re-\nceiving appropriate post-acute care due to the scope\nof services available in rural areas (Dubay, 1993).\nPhysician Visits.--Data from 1985 Medicare claims\nshowed that rural elderly persons had (price adjusted)\nphysician office expenditures of just 78% of the level\nof urban elderly persons (Dor & Holahan, 1990). A\nmore recent analysis of Medicare Part B claims data\nby the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC,\n1992), found that Medicare beneficiaries in rural\nareas receive approximately 18% fewer physician ser-\nvices (measured in relative value units or RVUs) than\nother Medicare beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in frontier\ncounties (population density of six or fewer persons\nper square mile) receive nearly 23% fewer services\nPhysician availability is generally believed to be the\nmost important factor underlying these differences\n(Coward & Cutler, 1989; Office of Technology Assess-\neas have less than a third of the per capita level of\nmedical specialists found in metropolitan areas (OTA,\n1990). However, the correspondence between physi-\ncian availability and utilization rates is generally not\nthis direct. On a per capita basis, rural areas have two\nthirds the general and family practitioners that urban\nareas do (OTA, 1990), but rural elderly persons re-\nceive 40% more RVUs from these providers than do\nurban elderly individuals (PPRC, 1992). Ongoing work\nby Stuart and Shea (1996) suggests that rural residents\nhave far greater use of general practitioners, family\npractitioners, and general surgeons, but far fewer\nvisits with specialty physicians and specialty surgeons.\nDespite more than 40 covariates describing individ-\nuals and availability of providers, these differences are\nstill not explained.\nResearch suggests that income and health insurance\ncoverage are significant predictors of physician utiliza-\ntion among rural residents (Rowland & Lyons, 1989).\nHow important these factors are in explaining urban/\nrural differences among the elderly population is less\ncertain. Medicare data for 1990 indicate that elderly\nbeneficiaries residing in rural, poor areas actually use\nmore outpatient care than rural beneficiaries in non-\nfound that income levels could not explain differences\nin physician expenditures among elderly Medicare\nbeneficiaries. In the Dor and Holahan (1990) study,\nthe only variable to increase predicted use among ru-\nral residents to the levels of urban residents was phy-\nsician resource characteristics. Thus, as Kane, Dean,\nand Soloman (1979) suggested almost two decades\nago, although research indicates that rural populations\nhave lower utilization of care than do urban popula-\ntions, the ability to quantify the extent and importance\nof this difference is still missing.\nSkilled Nursing Facilities.--Overall, studies on ur-\nban/rural differentials in the number of skilled nursing\nfacility (SNF) days show that rural residents spend\nDubay (1993) found that the rate of SNF benefit use\nfor Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas is 15% higher\nthan that for Medicare beneficiaries in urban areas.\nOne explanation for this difference is that the supply\nof certified nursing home beds per 1000 elders is higher\nin rural locations than in metropolitan areas, suggest-\ning that rural elders may be \"over-institutionalized\"\n(Shaughnessy, 1994). An alternative explanation is pro-\nvided by Rowles (1994) who argues that rural com-\nmunities face a greater demand for intermediate type\ninstitutional care because of the difficulties of deliver-\ning community and home services in remote areas.\nThis \"substitution\" argument is supported by Coward,\nDuncan, and Freudenbarger (1994), who found that\nSNF residents in rural facilities were more likely to\nindicate that necessary services were not available in\ntheir communities at the time of their admission to\nthe nursing home.\nMore recent research on the use of long-term care\nservices in rural areas continues to find higher rates of\ninstitutionalization among elderly persons residing in\nless urbanized and completely rural counties even\nafter controlling for a large number of covariates.\nCoward, Home, and Peek (1995) and Coward, Duncan,\nand Uttaro (1996) used data from the Longitudinal\ning home admissions controlling for more than two\ndozen covariates. Despite these controls, they still\nfound that elderly persons in more rural areas were at\nleast 1.2 times more likely to experience a nursing\nhome admission than elderly persons living in more\nurban settings. Although these studies do not control\nfor resource availability, Coward et al. (1996) docu-\nment the greater availability of nursing home beds in\nthese nonmetropolitan locations. As they note, we do\nnot know if demand leads to supply or vice versa, nor\ndo we know if these service use differences represent\nunderuse or overuse.\nPredictors of Service Use\nIndividual Characteristics.--A review by Coward\nand colleagues (1994) indicates that there are resi-\ndential differences in both the demographic charac-\nteristics and in the health status of rural versus urban\nelders. A higher percentage of individuals over age 65\nlive in nonmetropolitan areas, and nonmetropolitan\nareas have a higher percentage of individuals ages 75-\n84. Additionally, rural elders have lower incomes and\nless insurance, are more likely to be married, and are\nless likely to live alone. With regard to health condi-\ntions, there are significant differences between rural\nand urban populations. Rural, nonfarm elders have\nthe worst health profiles, compared to the inhabitants\nof any other residential category; these individuals are\nmore likely to report certain medical conditions (hyper-\ntension, arthritis, or rheumatism) and to have more\nfunctional limitations. However, Hayward, Pienta, and\nMcLaughlin (1996) found that rural men, on average,\nlive longer than do urban men.\nGeographical Location.--Traditionally, studies on\nrural health care have relied on a simple dichotomy\nof urban versus rural to describe residential variation\n(Coward et al., 1994). The most commonly used defi-\nnition of \"rurality\" is the U.S. Bureau of the Census\ndefinition of a rural area as being nonincorporated or\nA major weakness to this approach is that dichoto-\nmies frequently include as much variation in service\nuse within a category as between categories. To off-\nset this limitation, the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA) developed a ten-category\nclassification--the Human Resource Profile County Aa-\njacency Code (HRPCAC)--based on county popula-\ntion size and adjacency to metropolitan areas, to\ndescribe residential variation.\nIn summary, past research on urban/rural differences\nin health service use by older persons presents a con-\nfusing picture. In some cases, provider availability is\npositively related to use; in other cases, it is nega-\ntively related to use. For some services, urban/rural\ndifferences nearly disappear after adjustment for co-\nvariates; in other cases, differences persist even after\ncontrolling for a wide selection of covariates. Studies\nof service types have failed to capture the importance\nof the constellation of services used by individuals be-\ncause they often focus on the use of one type of ser-\nvice and the availability of one type of provider. The\npurpose of this study was to advance our understand-\ning of the differences in health service use among\nrural elders by providing more accurate profiles of\nindividuals who use services in the context of mul-\ntiple service use--hospital days, physician office visits,\nhome health visits and skilled nursing days--and\nmultiple measures of provider availability. Addition-\nally, elaboration of urban and rural differences beyond\nthe traditional dichotomy will enhance our under-\nstanding of unique characteristics of rural elders as well\nas the communities in which they reside.\nMethods\nData Sources\nThe sample in this study was drawn from a pop-\nulation of 12,675 Medicare beneficiaries interviewed\nfor the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)\nin 1991. The MCBS is a nationally representative\nlongitudinal panel survey conducted under the aus-\npices of the Office of the Actuary in the Health Care\nFinancing Administration. Medicare beneficiaries are\ninterviewed three times a year with annual replace-\nment for attrition. MCBS interviews collect extensive\ninformation on individuals' use and expenditures for\nhealth services, source of payment, type of health in-\nsurance, access to care, health and functional status,\nand socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.\nThe MCBS is linked to HCFA databases that provide\nadditional information on Medicare and Medicaid en-\nrollment together with claims-based data on utiliza-\ntion and expenses for Medicare covered services.\nThe size of our sample is 6,956. Included in the\nsample were all MCBS survey participants who met\nthe following conditions: (a) aged 65 years or older\nat the time of the Round 1 interview (2,476 excluded\nbecause of age); (b) responded to both the 1991\nexcluded); (c) interviewed in the community (892\nexcluded); and (d) not enrolled in an HMO (984 ex-\ncluded). Restricting the analysis to individuals who par-\nticipated in both MCBS rounds was done to allow us\nto use predetermined data on the independent vari-\nables from the last quarter of 1991 in the Round 1\nsurvey to predict use of services from the claims data\nin calendar year 1992. Because of the focus on am-\nbulatory care and because certain questions were not\nasked of institutionalized persons, these persons were\nexcluded. The HMO enrollees were excluded because\nMedicare does not collect claims records from HMO\nenrollees. The exclusion of those who are institution-\nalized may bias our results by removing those in poorer\nhealth. The exclusion of the HMO enrollees may bias\nthe results because of health differences and geo-\ngraphic differences in enrollment. HMO enrollees are\ntypically healthier and live in more urban or suburban\nsettings. Finally, the exclusion of those not present for\nboth survey rounds may include both some in better\nhealth who moved to another location and those in\npoorer health who died or changed households. Two\nadditional sample exclusions had to be made at vari-\nous points in the analysis. First, 185 persons could not\nbe matched to any county in the Area Resource File.\nWhen totals are given in the descriptive data, these\npeople are included, although they do not fall into\nany of the urban/rural categories. Second, 737 per-\nsons were missing data on one or more of the ex-\nplanatory variables used in the regression analysis. These\npersons had to be excluded from that part of the\nstudy. While a comparison of the dependent and in-\ndependent variables between our sample and the\nHMO and facility residing populations snowed clear\nand significant differences in the variables, a compari-\nson of those excluded because of sample attrition,\nmissing ARF data, or missing survey variables did not\nshow significant differences in the dependent or in-\ndependent variables.\nData from the Area Resource File (ARF), a comput-\nerized data system developed and maintained by\nthe Office of Data Analysis in the Health Resources\nand Services Administration (HRSA), were used for this\nproject. The primary purpose of the ARF is to provide\nan updated source of county-specific data for health\nplanning and research. The ARF maintains over 7,000\nvariables, including data on geographic descriptors,\nhealth professionals, and health care facilities and is\nthe most comprehensive public-use file available on\ncharacteristics of the health care system at the county\nlevel. The ARF geographical typologies (developed by\nthe HRSA) and data regarding the availability of health\nservices were used in this study.\nThe Provider of Services (POS) file, created by the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services from the\nOnline Survey and Certification (OSCAR) database, was\nused to provide estimates of health resource avail-\nability that were not available in the ARF or when the\nPOS data offered more current information than the\nARF. POS data include extensive information on Medi-\ncare providers of all types (excluding physicians) col-\nlected through regional offices of the Health Care\nFinancing Administration. Through an agreement with\nthe Health Care Financing Administration, we were\nable to link actual beneficiaries with their counties.\nThis allowed us to use the ARF and POS to identify\nprovider availability at the county level for each sampled\nperson.\nMeasures\nService Use.--The following interval level variables\nwere extracted from the MCBS data file: number of\ninpatient covered days for 1992, number of home health\nof SNF days for 1992. The mean for all persons, the\nmean for persons with one or more days, and the\npercent with one or more days, were then calculated\nfor each geographical category. SNF days were included\nin the descriptive analysis but later dropped due to\nthe small numbers in each geographical category.\nGeographical Categories.--Because our principal\nmeasures of health care resource availability are at the\ncounty level (from the ARF), the definition must be\nhomologous to counties. The HRSA classification--based\non county population size and adjacency to metro-\npolitan areas--was used in this stuay to classify each\nperson in the MCBS into a geographical category. To\nmaximize power in our statistical analysis, five catego-\nries, rather than the prescribed ten, were used (see\nFigure 1).\nDemographic Characteristics.--Measures of individual\ncharacteristics were obtained from self-reported data\nin the MCBS. Raw data for age in years and number\nof persons in household were used. Impairment in\nactivities of daily living (ADL) was operationalized as\nthe summed score of 6 items that measured limita-\ntions in bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of\nchairs, walking, and using the toilet. Impairment in\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was opera-\ntionalized as the summed score of 9 items that mea-\nsured limitations in stooping, lifting, reaching, writing,\nusing the telephone, doing light housework, making\nLarge metropolitan\ncore counties\nLarge metropolitan\nfringe counties\nMedium/lesser\nmetropolitan counties\nUrban nonmetropolitan\ncounties\nCompletely rural\ncounties\nCore counties of SMSAs with\nFringe counties of SMSAs with\nCounties in SMSAs with under\nNonmetropolitan counties with\nNonmetropolitan counties with\nFigure 1. Ceographic categories.\nmeals, shopping, and paying bills. We also used mea-\nsures of gender and insurance status.\nAvailability of Health Care Providers.--Data on\nhealth resources in each county were obtained from\nthe ARF and POS files. The following measures,\noperationalized at the county level, were used: ratio\nof hospital beds, ratio of home health RNs, PTs and\naides, ratio of active physicians, and ratio of SNF beds\nto county population.\nAnalysis\nThe unit of analysis is the individual MCBS respon-\ndent. Descriptive statistics were calculated--first, for\nindividual characteristics of all respondents in our\nMCBS sample; second, for each type of service use;\nand third, for characteristics of the health care deliv-\nery system for each geographical category. Regression\nequations were calculated to assess the effects of the\nindependent variables and covariates as predictors of\neach type of service use. Significant predictors were\nthen used as control factors in multivariate analysis of\nvariance (MANOVA).\nMANOVA, an extension of univariate analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA), is used to test hypotheses about the\nrelationship between a set of interrelated dependent\nvariables and one or more independent variables. In\nMANOVA, a vector of means replaces the means\nspecified in ANOVA. The MANOVA procedure ad-\njusts the means for each dependent variable by\nsimultaneously controlling for the other dependent\nvariables. The justification for using MANOVA is its\nrecognition of interrelationships among the dependent\nvariables. Substantial information may be lost when\nthe correlation between variables is ignored as in a\nsingle equation model. Thus, one type of service use\nmust be studied in the context of other service use.\nThe covariates used are a set of 18 variables based\nupon the Anderson and Aday (1974) framework. These\ninclude several measures of individual predisposing\ncharacteristics (e.g., age, gender), enabling (e.g., in-\ncome, insurance), and need (e.g. limitations in activi-\nties of daily living, self-reported health status). Charac-\nteristics of the delivery system include the availability\nof five health care resources: physicians, hospital beds,\nnursing home beds, home health nurses, and home\nhealth aides and physical therapists. All five availabil-\nity measures are included in each equation and each\nregression includes all persons in the sample.\nAlthough two-part models (including a logit or probit\nfor probability of use and a linear regression for level\nof use) have been used in this line of research, our\ninterest in modeling the interrelationships between the\ndependent variables precluded using a two-part model\napproach.\nThe hypothesis being tested is that the population\nmeans for the five geographical categories are the\nsame for all three types of service use (hospital days,\nhome health visits, and office visits). The dependent\nvariables are hospital days, home health days, and\nphysician office visits. MANOVA tested the effects of\ngeographical location and the covariates on the three\nservice types.\nResults\nService use for each of the five geographical cat-\negories is illustrated in Table 1. Observation of the\ndata reveals few consistent patterns of service use\ndifferentials. Residents in large, metropolitan fringe\ncounties have the highest levels of use for inpatient\ndays; persons in completely rural areas have the high-\nest level of home health use; persons in large metro-\npolitan core counties have the highest level of physi-\ncian use. The lowest levels of use are found among\ncompletely rural residents for inpatient days and\nnonmetropolitan urbanized residents for home health\nvisits and physician visits. Overall, residents in the\nurban categories (large metropolitan core, large met-\nropolitan fringe and medium metropolitan) tend to\nhave more inpatient covered days and office visits than\nresidents in the rural categories (nonmetropolitan\nurbanized and completely rural). Residents in the com-\npletely rural category tend to have more post-acute\n(home health and skilled nursing facility) use than resi-\ndents in other categories.\nThese differences in overall use result both from\ndifferences in the probability of use and in the level\nof use for those with some nonzero use, though the\nlatter seems most important. For example, residents\nin metropolitan areas are almost equally as likely as\nresidents in the completely rural areas to have one\nhome health visit; the service use difference in home\nhealth is driven by the large number of mean visits\nfor persons with at least one visit. In hospital care,\nsimilarly, the difference between the metropolitan and\nnonmetropolitan areas is driven largely by differences\nin the number of days of care, rather than the likeli-\nhood of a hospitalization.\nIndividual characteristics and characteristics of the\nhealth care delivery system for each geographical\ncategory are illustrated in Table 2. This sample of\nMedicare beneficiaries is predominantly female\n(74%). A large majority (84%) has some type of pri-\nvate insurance, and 6.8% have public insurance other\nthan Medicare.\nTable 1.

Rural elders have fewer mem-\nbers in their households, and have greater ADL and\nIADL impairment. Although there are fewer males\nthan females in each category, the two rural catego-\nries have a greater proportion of males than the two\nmost urban categories.\nInspection of the data on availability of health care\nservices reveals obvious differences among categories,\nwith the greatest disparities occurring between core\nTable 2.

Particularly notable is\npersons, with almost five times the number of physi-\ncians in core metropolitan areas as there are in com-\npletely rural locations.\nThese provider availability measures seem roughly,\nnot strongly, correlated to the service use differences.\nWhile the greater hospital beds to population ratio in\nmetropolitan core areas corresponds with greater use,\nhospital use is higher in the metropolitan fringe where\nbed supply is lower. Home health worker availability\nis greatest in nonmetropolitan urbanized areas, yet use\nof home health care is lowest in those areas. Physi-\ncian availability appears to follow the more expected\npattern of a positive relationship between resources\nand use.\nResults of regression analysis (illustrated in Table 3)\nshow that age, ADL impairment, Medicaid coverage,\nhousehold size, and fair or poor health status are sig-\nnificant predictors in all models of service use. In ad-\ndition, gender, race, and education are associated\nwith home health and physician use; marital status is\nassociated with home health use; very good health is\nassociated with physician use; and good health is as-\nsociated with inpatient and physician use.\nTable 3.

The ratio of\nhospital beds to population was positively related to\nhome health use, while the ratio of SNF beds to popu-\nlation was negatively related to home health use. The\nratio of home health aides to population was also a\npositive predictor of home health visits. In the regres-\nsion model with the number of physician office visits\nas the dependent variable, the ratio of home health\naides to population was inversely related to the num-\nber of office visits.\nResults of the MANOVA show the effects of geo-\ngraphical location and the covariates on the three\nservice types (see Table 4).\nObservation of the adjusted means for hospital use\nshows that, when controlling for other service use types\nalong with the covariates, rural elders still use fewer\nhospital days than urban elders, with residents in the\nmost completely rural areas using the fewest days. Thus\nthe differences in hospital use between urban and\nrural categories are only partially explained by char-\nacteristics of the individuals and availability of health\ncare providers. We also found that geographic loca-\ntion may explain differences in service use for home\nhealth visits and physician visits. Again, comparing the\nurban categories with the rural categories, home\nhealth visits are lower in core metropolitan areas and\nhigher in completely rural areas. The opposite effect\nis noted for physician office visits, with the highest\nnumber of visits provided in the core metropolitan\nareas and the fewest in the completely rural areas.\nOverall, these results provide strong evidence\nthat differences in service use remain, even after con-\ntrolling for individual characteristics and availability of\nhealth care providers. In the most completely rural\ncounties, where residents have greater ADL and IADL\nimpairment and fewer members in their households,\nthe pattern observed is fewer hospital days and physi-\ncian office visits, but more home nealth visits.

In the multivariate analysis, we used indi-\nvidual characteristics and community characteristics as\ncovariates with geographical location to predict ser-\nvice use. Our results support the view that individual\ncharacteristics partially explain differences in service\nuse. Age was a significant predictor of hospital days,\nhome nealth visits, and office visits. The mean age of\nelders in large metropolitan core areas is higher than\nfor other locations, partially explaining high hospital\nuse in that geographical category. ADL and IADL im-\npairment is highest in the completely rural category,\nand the mean number of household members was\nlowest in that category. These factors combined may\ncontribute to high home health use by rural residents.\nGender as an independent variable had a main effect\non each of the services but did not interact with geo-\ngraphic location.\nOur analysis was limited to available data; other\nindividual characteristics may contribute to service\nuse and should be considered in future analyses. For\nexample, Schlenker, Shaughnessy, and Hittle (1995)\nfound that Medicare beneficiaries receiving care from\nfee-for-service home health agencies received more\nhome health visits, compared to HMO enrollees. Since\nthe sample of MCBS respondents we used excludes\nHMO enrollees, we were not able to examine reim-\nbursement factors in this analysis.\nCharacteristics of the health care delivery system,\nmeasured as the ratio of hospital beds, physicians,\nTable 4.

A\nlong history of research finds correlation between re-\nsource availability and use of services, although theo-\nretical and empirical understanding of the causal rela-\ntionship remains controversial (Folland, Goodman, &\nStano, 1997). Our results, which show significant vari-\nation in service use and availability of providers among\nthe five geographical categories, extends this literature\nto another stage. When our results show significant\ncorrelation between provider availability and service\nuse, however, it is often across service categories. Thus,\nhome health visits are correlated with hospital and\nSNF bed availability. Physician visits are correlated with\nhome health aide availability.\nThis finding suggests that the adage that Roemer's\nLaw--a \"built bed is a filled bed\"--needs to be re-\nconsidered. Perhaps a built nursing home bed is an\nunemployed home health aide. In short, these results,\nwhile certainly preliminary, suggest research into the\nrelationships between service use and provider avail-\nability must go beyond simple counts of one type of\nservice and one type of provider. More detail on the\nservices used ana the availability of the network of\nproviders of various types is needed. For example, physi-\ncian visits and physician availability can be examined\nby specialty groupings. In some preliminary work on\nthis issue, we find that the traditional finding of less\nphysician use by rural residents is far more compli-\ncated. Rural residents exhibit more general practitio-\nner visits but fewer internal medicine and specialty\nmedicine services. There are few differences across\nregions in individual use of hospital-based physicians\nor surgical specialists. These geographic differences\npersist even after controlling for provider availability\nWe found significant differences in home health use\nbetween the two rural categories even after control-\nling for covariates. Residents in the most completely\nrural areas receive approximately 3.5 times the num-\nber of home health visits that residents in rural coun-\nties with urbanized areas receive. This pattern sug-\ngests that home health services may provide a \"safety\nnet\" in remote rural areas, substituting for both formal\nand informal services. For example, home health\nvisits may substitute for physician office visits. Home\nhealth nurses can provide assessment of patients\nwith congestive heart failure to determine if a hospital\nadmission is required or follow-up with a newly diag-\nnosed person with diabetes to evaluate treatment\nresponse. Table 4 shows the most home health visits\nand the fewest physician office visits being provided\nin the most completely rural areas. This pattern, how-\never, is not repeated in the nonmetropolitan urban-\nized population. Additionally, nursing and aide home\nvisits may substitute for formal community services.\nResearch on aging network services (Krout, 1989) in-\ndicates that rural communities are less likely to pro-\nvide services such as adult day care, guardianship,\nhousing and respite services. Further research is\nneeded to identify specific types of home health visits\n(nursing, therapy, aide) and possible substitution\neffects.\nPolicy & Practice Implications\nKey sources of potential differences in service use\ninclude characteristics of the health delivery system,\ncharacteristics of the population, and characteristics of\nthe area or place. Identifying elements within these\nbroad classifications and their relative importance in\nexplaining utilization differences is critical to the de-\nvelopment of informed public policy. Our results, which\nshow variability in elderly service use patterns within\nrural America, argue for a more targeted approach\nto improving rural health services delivery.\nThis research did not investigate how characteris-\ntics of the area may affect service use; however, this\nis likely to be a fruitful line of future research. The\nadvances in the use of geographic information systems\nto turn spatial information into data amenable to\nempirical analysis holds great potential for health ser-\nvices research. Future study might focus on identify-\ning and incorporating geographic barriers to care,\nenabling the study of the effects of networks of social\nservice agencies, or other measures that might be de-\nveloped from this technology.\nTrie profiles of elders who use Medicare-reimbursed\nservices indicate differentials in use between urban\nand rural residents. Our results are also consistent with\nearlier studies, which found that rural residents are\nolder and have more functional limitations. This dif-\nference in individual use, however, has not been\nclosely linked to differences in quality of care or out-\ncomes. Recent studies report gaps in service continu-\nity between hospital discharge and home health care\nfor rural, frail elders (Dansky, Dellasega, Shellenbarger,\nand older were more likely to report benefits from\nhome health visits. Future studies should begin to link\nspecific patterns of health care use of the Medicare\npopulation in rural areas to measures of health care\nquality or outcomes. If use is different, yet achieves\nthe same outcome, then perhaps the networks of\nrural providers have found effective ways of coping\nwith the greater needs of the rural populace.\nPast efforts to address geographic utilization differ-\nentials have usually focused on providing incentives\nto attract specific health care professionals, especially\nphysicians, to rural areas. These supply-side policies,\nemphasizing the characteristics of the nealth delivery\nsystem and the availability of certain providers, have\nmet with limited success (Kane et al., 1979; New-\nhouse, 1992). While not minimizing the importance\nof primary care physicians in rural communities, we\nargue that policy needs to consider more fully the\narray of services needed and how they can be pro-\nvided using different combinations of providers. The\ncombination of physicians, nursing homes, hospitals,\nhome health agencies, and other providers that\nworks in an urban setting may differ from that which\nworks in a rural area. Questions concerning the ap-\npropriate configuration of helping networks among\nelderly rural residents remain unanswered. Evaluating\nthe complementary roles of the range of formal and\ninformal services in remote rural areas may have the\nmost potential for improving service delivery to rural\nelders.\nThe trend toward integrated health care delivery\nunderscores the need to identify and provide the\nappropriate mix of services for rural clients. Effective\nservice delivery in rural areas requires innovative and\ncooperative approaches by diverse health and human\nservices providers. To accomplish this objective,\nMedicare and Medicaid reimbursed services must\nbe integrated (clinically and financially) with rural\ncommunity-based services. The challenge, as noted\nby Longino and Smith (1994), is to do more than sim-\nply \"patch old pants with new cloth\" (p. 240); it is to\nlearn how to help older people stay healthy longer\nand to do so in ways that fit into the communities in\nwhich they live.\nDirections for Future Research\nOur research extends current work that indicates\nthat many of the measurable demand and supply\nfactors fail to explain differences in patterns of use.\nImprovements are needed in research designs to help\nus understand further the complexities in service use.\nWe offer the following recommendations to advance\nthis line of research.\nFirst, research must move beyond single equation\nmethods of estimation toward more complex MANOVA,\npath, and simultaneous equation models. Patterns of\nsubstitution between services as diverse as physician\ncare, hospital care, nursing home care and home health\ncare must be fully explored in models that can con-\nsider correlation between the errors of the various\nequations, as well as endogeneity of the dependent\nvariables. Second, research must continue to explore\nmultilevel modeling using individual, familial, local,\nstate, and national contextual variables. Finally, research\nparadigms must broaden to include psychological, so-\nciological, economic, geographic, demographic, and\nother variables in the explanatory set. Questions that\naddress how regional and community characteristics--\nfor example, transportation, geographic boundaries\nor local culture--influence health seeking behaviors\nshould be studied. Qualitative as well as quantitative\nmethods should be encouraged to produce a finer-\ngrain analysis of service use. A broader paradigm and\nmore complex methodology will allow researchers to\naddress several gaps that now exist in the literature.\nReferences\nAday, L, & Andersen, R. (1974).
