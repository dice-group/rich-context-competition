We\ndefined 1 insensate area on Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing as a posi-\ntive finding for neuropathy. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a combination\nof no history of diagnosed diabetes and a measured fasting glucose 126 mg/dL.\nWe used SUDAAN for 2 and regression analyses.\nRESULTS The prevalence of a positive test when screening for nephropathy\namong those with undiagnosed diabetes was 26.5% compared with 7.1% in those\nwith no diabetes (2, P <.01). After adjusting for age and diagnosed or undiag-\nnosed hypertension, the association of undiagnosed diabetes with nephropathy\neral neuropathy, 21.5% with undiagnosed diabetes had positive screening tests\ncompared with 10.1% with no diabetes (2, P <.01); however, this effect was not\nsignificant after adjustment for age. There was no significant difference in positive\nscreening tests for nephropathy or neuropathy when comparing those with undi-\nagnosed and diagnosed diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of adults with undiagnosed diabetes have\nsigns of nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy. These findings may influence\npolicies about early screening for diabetes.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for US adults has been esti-\nmated at 2.4%, representing 4.9 million adults and nearly 30% of all\ntes is especially likely to be undiagnosed for years because of its insidious\nclinical prodrome; projections based on extrapolation of time to develop-\nment of complications of diabetes estimate that the average time from the\nonset of disease to clinical diagnosis of diabetes in the US population is as\nmuch as 12 years.2,3 Twenty percent of persons with undiagnosed diabetes\nalready have developed retinopathy.2 The prevalence of other microvascu-\nlar complications among US adults with undiagnosed diabetes is unknown,\nalthough microvascular complications, including retinopathy and signs of\nRichelle J.

The NHANES\nsample, allowing estimation of disease prevalence in the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized US population. We sampled\nadults 40 years of age and older for this analysis because\nthis population in the NHANES had both monofilament\nand urine testing. We also used the subsample of par-\nticipants who had fasting plasma glucose measurements,\nresulting in an unweighted sample size of 2,571. For\nthe analysis of peripheral neuropathy, our sample size is\nslightly smaller because not all adults had monofilament\ntesting. Additionally, because participants who reported\na history of stroke (n = 103) were excluded from the neu-\nropathy sample, as stroke might confound the assessment\nof peripheral sensation, the resulting final sample size\nwas 2,337. The Institutional Review Board of the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina approved this research.\nNephropathy: Urinary Albumin-Creatinine Ratio\nBoth urine albumin and urine creatinine were mea-\na Jaffe rate reaction for creatinine analysis and solid-\nphase fluorescent immunoassay for albumin analysis.11\nThe spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio is recom-\nmended by the American Diabetes Association to\nscreen for diabetic nephropathy and is less susceptible\nto false negatives and false positives than is spot urine\nalbumin testing without concomitant urine creatinine\nmeasurement.12,13 A spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio\n30 mg/g is defined as abnormal, representing at least\nPeripheral Neuropathy: Insensate Area on\n5.07 Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Testing\nLoss of protective sensation was ascertained by a\nstandard monofilament test for NHANES participants\nSemmes-Weinstein monofilament was applied 3 times\nto each of 3 areas on each foot (hallux and first and\nfifth metatarsal heads). The testing used a 2-alternative\nforced-choice algorithm.16 Insensitivity at any site on\nmore than 1 occasion constitutes a positive screening\ntest for peripheral neuropathy. Further details of the\nNHANES testing procedure are available.17 Positive\n5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing in per-\nsons with diabetes has been shown to be predictive of\nfuture diabetic foot ulceration, and it has been used\npreviously to estimate the prevalence of peripheral\nDiagnosed Diabetes, Undiagnosed Diabetes,\nNo Diabetes\nThe NHANES assessed participants for diagnosed\ndiabetes using the question, \"Other than during preg-\nnancy, have you ever been told by a doctor or health\nprofessional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?\"\nWe defined participants as having diagnosed diabetes\nif they answered \"yes\" to this question. We defined\nparticipants as having undiagnosed diabetes if they\nanswered \"no\" to this question and had a fasting plasma\nglucose of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). We defined par-\nticipants as having no diabetes if they did not have lab-\noratory evidence consistent with diabetes and denied a\nhistory of diagnosed diabetes. This method of classify-\ning NHANES participants as having diagnosed, undi-\nagnosed, and no diabetes has been used previously.1\nAs a check on the validity of the classification of\nundiagnosed diabetes, we examined the medication lists\nof the NHANES participants whom we defined as hav-\ning no diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes for evidence\nof use of medicines classified according to the US Food\nand Drug Administration's National Drug Code Direc-\ntory (NDC).20 Participants were reclassified as having\ndiagnosed diabetes if they reported being on a medicine\nin NDC drug class code 1036, \"blood glucose regula-\ntors,\" which accounted for 0.5% of the total sample of\nthose initially classified as having undiagnosed diabetes.\nWe investigated demographic characteristics of the\npopulation with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and no diabe-\ntes, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnic-\nity is self-defined by NHANES participants according\nto the following classifications: non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. We also inves-\ntigated the health care access factors of lack of health\ninsurance, absence of a regular place of care, and lack of\nany health care utilization during the past year, as well\nas the socioeconomic factors of low income, defined as\nless than $20,000 for the household for the year, high\nschool education (less than, more than, or equivalent),\nand marital status. Health insurance was assessed only\nfor those aged less than 65 years, as health care cover-\nage in the United States for those aged 65 years and up\nis nearly universal as a result of the Medicare program.\nWe examined the participants' body mass index (BMI)\nand self-rated health status, which had the possible val-\nues of excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.\nAdditionally we examined the prevalence of diag-\nnosed and undiagnosed hypertension in the sample,\nbecause there is a potential confounding effect of\nhypertension on the relationship between diabetes\nand nephropathy/microalbuminuria. Participants were\nclassified as having diagnosed hypertension if they\nanswered \"yes\" to the NHANES survey question,\n\"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health\nprofessional that you had hypertension, also called\nhigh blood pressure?\" In a manner similar to defining\nparticipants with undiagnosed diabetes, we defined\nindividuals as having undiagnosed hypertension if\nthey answered \"no\" to this question about diagnosed\nhypertension and if they had either a measured systolic\nblood pressure 140 mm Hg or a measured diastolic\nblood pressure 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure in the\nNHANES survey was the average of 3 to 4 blood\npressures measured with a mercury sphygmomanom-\neter according to the American Heart Association\nrecommended procedures.21 Finally, we examined the\nmedication lists of the NHANES participants whom\nwe defined as having no evidence of hypertension or\nundiagnosed hypertension for evidence of medicines\nclassified according to the US Food and Drug Admin-\nistration's NDC.20 Participants were reclassified as\nhaving diagnosed hypertension if they reported being\non a medicine in NDC drug class codes 0506 \"anti-\nalpha blockers,\" and 0514 \"ace inhibitors.\" NHANES\ninterviewers also ascertained the main reason for the\nuse of the medication, further validating the classifica-\ntion of each medication as an antihypertensive.\nAnalysis\nWe applied appropriate sample weights to the\nunweighted samples to calculate population estimates\nof those with a positive screening test according to\ntheir diabetes diagnosis status. We used sample weights\nfor the subpopulation with fasting glucose measure-\nments and the combined sample weights for the 1999-\nfor NHANES analysis.22 We compared rates of a posi-\ntive screening test for nephropathy and for peripheral\nneuropathy in those with no evidence of diabetes,\nundiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes using a\n2 test with SUDAAN statistical software for this clus-\ntered and weighted probability sample.23\nBecause hypertension and undiagnosed hyperten-\nsion are common in persons with diagnosed and undi-\nagnosed diabetes in this sample, it is possible that the\npresence of hypertension might confound the effect of\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes on microalbumin-\nuria.5 Additionally, age is related to both the outcomes\nof nephropathy and neuropathy.7 We therefore used\nlogistic regression to examine the effect of undiag-\nnosed diabetes on the presence of microalbuminuria\nafter adjustment for age and hypertension, comprising\nboth diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension. We\nalso used logistic regression to examine the effect of\nundiagnosed diabetes on a positive screening test for\nperipheral neuropathy after adjustment for age.\nRESULTS\nThe sociodemographic and health care access charac-\nteristics of those aged 40 years and older with undiag-\nopposed to those with diagnosed diabetes and no evi-\ndence of diabetes, are displayed in Table 1. There were\n399 people in the unweighted sample with an elevated\nurine albumin-creatinine ratio and 332 people in the\nunweighted sample with at least 1 area of insensitivity\non either foot and no history of stroke.\nThe prevalence of positive screening tests for\nnephropathy and peripheral neuropathy among US\nadults aged 40 years and older with no evidence of\ndiabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes\nis represented in Table 2. When compared only with\nthose with no evidence diabetes, those who had undi-\nagnosed diabetes had significantly more nephropathy,\nP <.01 (2); when compared with those who had diag-\nnosed diabetes, there was no significant difference,\nP = .63 (2). Similarly, a significantly greater proportion\nof persons with undiagnosed diabetes had a positive\nscreening test for peripheral neuropathy than did those\nwith no evidence of diabetes, P = .04 (2), whereas\nthere was no significant difference between the groups\nwith undiagnosed and previously diagnosed diabetes,\nP = .72 (2). In an analysis of positive screening tests\nfor peripheral neuropathy, including those with stroke,\na similar pattern was found, with significantly more\nscreening tests positive for peripheral neuropathy in\nthose with undiagnosed diabetes than in those with no\nevidence of diabetes, P = .02 (2), whereas there was\nno significant difference in positive screening tests for\nperipheral neuropathy between the groups with undi-\nagnosed and previously diagnosed diabetes.\nIn a logistic regression model examining the rela-\ntive contributions of diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,\nage, and any hypertension to the pres-\nence of microalbuminuria, the effect of\nboth undiagnosed diabetes (odds ratio\nsisted even after adjustment for age and\ndiagnosed or undiagnosed hypertension.\nIn a logistic regression model examin-\ning the contributions of diabetes and\nundiagnosed diabetes to the presence of\na positive screening test for peripheral\nneuropathy, with adjustment for age,\ndiagnosed diabetes was a significant pre-\nhowever, undiagnosed diabetes was not\nDISCUSSION\nThis study is the first examination of the\nprevalence of positive screening tests for\nnephropathy and peripheral neuropathy\namong those who had undiagnosed dia-\nbetes in a US population-based sample.\nwith undiagnosed diabetes had signs\nof nephropathy and 21.5% had signs of\nperipheral neuropathy adds to the accu-\nmulating literature which documents\nundiagnosed diabetes is not a benign\ncondition but represents a serious pub-\nlic health concern.

First, we excluded participants with stroke.\nSecond, we reclassified persons with no evidence\nof diabetes or with undiagnosed diabetes who were\nusing diabetes medications. Third, we were using a\nNHANES survey but also the more recent data from\nadditional data may in itself lead to slight differences\nin prevalence estimates. Lastly, our investigation used\nfasting plasma glucose values to define and contrast\nthose with undiagnosed diabetes, which led us to use\na morning fasting subsample of NHANES participants\nand the associated morning subsample weights to reach\nour population estimates. Similarly, the population esti-\nmates of microalbuminuria differ from previous studies\nfor many of the same reasons, including the limitation\nof our sample to adults aged 40 years and older.10\nOne strength of this study is its ability to produce\npopulation estimates for undiagnosed diabetes and\nits coexisting complications for the US population of\nadults aged 40 years and older. Only through using the\nNHANES data set, which simultaneously assesses a\nhistory of diabetes with laboratory evidence for diabe-\ntes, can we arrive at estimates of undiagnosed diabetes.\nIn this way, we can, in effect, know what is unknown.\nWe were also able to examine some of the sociodemo-\ngraphic and health care access factors associated with\nundiagnosed diabetes.\nA few limitations must be acknowledged. Because\nour study is a cross-sectional examination, inferences\nabout sociodemographic health care access charac-\nteristics among those with undiagnosed diabetes is\nlimited in that cause and effect can not be determined.\nFor example, those with undiagnosed diabetes were\nless likely to have health insurance than those with\npreviously diagnosed diabetes. Even so, we cannot\nsay whether the lack of insurance resulted in the lack\nof diagnosis of diabetes or whether, conversely, those\nwith diagnosed diabetes were more likely to subse-\nquently obtain health insurance.\nSemmes-Weinstein monofilament testing is a screen-\ning test for peripheral neuropathy and does not con-\nstitute a definitive diagnosis of neuropathy, although it\ncertainly has documented clinical utility.32 Additionally,\nalthough it may not be as accurate as nerve conduction\nstudies, monofilament testing has utility for estimates\nof disease in large epidemiologic samples such as the\nNHANES, it has been used similarly in previous stud-\nies, and it is recommended by the ADA for assessment\nof the foot in all patients with diabetes who are not\nalready known to have neuropathy.7,12 We excluded\npersons with stroke, but there may be other causes of\ndecreased peripheral sensation that we were not able\nto address which may affect the prevalence of a posi-\ntive screening test, particularly among those with no\nevidence of diabetes. We did not investigate metabolic\ncauses of peripheral neuropathy other than diabetes\nbecause of the limitations of using existing data.\nMass population screening for diabetes is not rec-\nommended at this time33-35 despite evidence that early\ntreatment can prevent complications.36 Although the\nresults presented here do not lead us to advocate mass\nscreening, they do sensitize us to the point that the cur-\nrent approach of detecting diabetes once clinical signs\nand symptoms are apparent may be too late to prevent\ncomplications and may be a strategy in need of review.\nThe evidence presented in this study is consistent with\nsimilar evidence for retinopathy,2 which suggests that\nthose with undetected diabetes are already beginning\nto accrue complications of diabetes. This new knowl-\nedge about the prevalence of positive screening tests\nfor nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy in those\nwith undiagnosed diabetes may have implications for\npolicy and research initiatives regarding screening and\ndetection of diabetes, as well as efforts to prevent dia-\nbetes. We have effective, inexpensive, and minimally\ninvasive tests to detect both diabetes and prediabetic\nstates. More aggressive use of screening based on risk\nstratification for diabetes is in order and should be\nappropriately reimbursed. Research that focuses on risk\nstratification may lead to more cost-effective screening\nstrategies. Additional evidence of early complications\nand investigation into the effects of early detection\nand treatment of diabetes may further inform decisions\nabout policies to screen based on risk.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/4/5/427.\n",
