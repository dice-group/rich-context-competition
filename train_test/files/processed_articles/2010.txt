The Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) estimated that there were 23.1 million Veterans in\nthe United States in 2009, of whom 5.7 million used publicly\nfunded VA health care at least once during the fiscal year (1).\nObesity and overweight might be expected a priori to be less\ncommon among Veterans than among non-Veterans. New\nrecruits must pass medical evaluation to enter military service,\nwhich would screen out those with serious pre-existing obesity\nor obesity-related chronic conditions. Overweight and obesity\nat intake into the Air Force were indeed found to be less com-\nmon than among respondents of similar age and gender in a\nlarge national survey (2). Physical fitness is mandated through-\nout a military career, and some evidence suggests that higher\nexercise levels are maintained after discharge from service (3).\nTobacco smoking has also been found to be more common\namong Veterans than among non-Veterans (4) and might limit\nweight gain. Nonetheless, results from the Centers for Disease\nControl Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),\na large national telephone survey, suggested that Veterans\nwere significantly more likely to be classified as overweight\n(BMI = 25\u00ad29.9kg/m2) but about equally likely to be classified\nas obese (BMI  30kg/m2) compared to non-Veterans of simi-\nlar age and gender (5,6).\nA concern about the higher prevalence of overweight in\nVeterans in BRFSS data is that it may be an artifact of meas-\nurement error. In telephone surveys, BMI must be based on\nself-reported height and weight. Validation studies have found\nthat survey respondents generally tend to over-report their\nheight and to under-report their weight (7,8). The extent to\nwhich reporting biases may vary in relation to demographic\ncharacteristics and Veteran status is unknown. In addition,\nsome authors have questioned the validity of BMI itself as an\nindicator of obesity (9), especially in highly physically fit indi-\nviduals, such as professional athletes (10,11). Compared with\nBMI, waist circumference has been found to be more strongly\ncorrelated with percent body fat as assessed by dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in males (12) and to be more\nstrongly correlated with cardiovascular risk factors (13). Other\nauthors have advocated use of the waist-to-height ratio as a\nsimple measure of excess weight (14).\nThe present study sought to re-examine the association\nbetween Veteran status and overweight/obesity status, using\nObesity, Overweight, and Their Life Course\nTrajectories in Veterans and Non-Veterans\nThomas D. Koepsell1\u00ad3, Alyson J. Littman1,2 and Christopher W. Forsberg1\nVeterans comprise a large and growing segment of the US population. Results from national telephone surveys\nsuggest higher prevalence of overweight among Veterans compared with demographically similar non-Veterans,\nbased on self-reported height and weight. Using 1999\u00ad2008 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES), we compared 3,768 Veterans and 21,974 non-Veterans on: (i) several measures of adiposity based\non direct anthropometry; (ii) life-course of self-reported BMI; and (iii) behaviors related to weight loss or maintenance.\nWhether Veterans were more likely than demographically similar non-Veterans to be obese or overweight depended\non the adiposity measure employed. On BMI, Veterans were about equally likely to be obese (30+ kg/m2), but more\nlikely to be overweight (25\u00ad29.9kg/m2) by both self-report and by direct measurement (significantly so only by self-\nreport). On waist-stature ratio, a roughly similar pattern was observed. On waist circumference, Veterans tended to\nhave larger values than demographically similar non-Veterans, with more Veterans in the largest two categories. But\non dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry, Veterans were less likely to have 35+% body fat than non-Veterans of similar\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity. Life-course trends in self-reported BMI suggested a possible burst of weight gain\nafter military discharge. These results suggest that Veterans may, on average, have less excess body fat than\nnon-Veterans--a pattern not revealed by standard anthropometric measures.\n1Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington, USA; 2Department of Epidemiology,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; 3Department of Health Services, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.\nCorrespondence: Thomas D.

NHANES collects data on weight, height,\nand other anthropometric measures by direct examination.\nIn certain years, DXA-derived measures of percent body fat\nwere also obtained. Thus, we retested the null hypothesis of\nno difference in the prevalence of obesity and overweight by\nVeteran status using other and arguably better measures of adi-\nposity. Interview data with NHANES participants also permit-\nted comparisons between Veterans and non-Veterans as to the\nlife-course trajectory of adiposity, albeit based on self-report\nof weight and height at earlier ages. This information may shed\nlight on how any differences in adiposity by Veteran status\narise with age.\nMethods and Procedures\nSample\nDetailsoftheNHANESsampledesignanddatacollectionmethodology\nare available elsewhere (15). Briefly, NHANES seeks to identify a prob-\nability sample of civilian, noninstitutionalized US residents. Since 1999,\ndata collection has been conducted every year. A multi-stage sampling\ndesign is used, involving stratification by geographic region, probabil-\nity samples of primary sampling units (generally counties) within each\nregion, census tracts within primary sampling units, dwelling units\nwithin census tracts, and finally individual respondents within dwell-\ning units. The present analysis included 25,743 adults aged 21 years or\nolder with known Veteran-status information.\nData\nNHANES collected data both by direct in-person examination and by\ninterviews with examinees. Height, weight, and waist circumference\nwere assessed by direct measurement in all years, and self-reported\nheight and weight were also obtained in all years. Those values were\nused to obtain several measures of adiposity: (i) BMI calculated as\n(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)2 using interview data; (ii) BMI\ncalculated similarly by direct measurement; (iii) waist circumference\nby direct measurement, in centimeters; and (iv) waist-stature ratio by\ndirect measurement, as (waist circumference in centimeters)/(height in\nDXA, which yielded estimates of percent body fat for 13,182 examinees\nin those years. All of these measures have been used in epidemiologic\nstudies to quantify the population frequency of excess body weight\n(12). Strictly speaking, only DXA provides a direct measure of body fat-\nness or adiposity. The remaining measures are best regarded as yielding\nproxy indicators of adiposity, based on simpler and less costly anthro-\npometric measurements. Data on key covariates including age, gender,\nrace, and education, were obtained from interviews.\nAnalysis\nValues for each measure were grouped into categories as shown in\nTable 3. For BMI, standard cutpoints appearing in the literature (e.g.,\n(5,6,16)) were used. For waist circumference and waist-stature ratio,\nwe chose gender-specific cutpoints based on work by Flegal et al. (12),\nusing values that corresponded approximately to percent body fat of\nBecause the distribution of sociodemographic factors proved to be\nquite different between Veterans and non-Veterans, we used model-based\ndirect adjustment to control for potentially confounding factors (17).\nThis method applies a regression-based weighting factor to the original\nNHANES sampling weight for each observation, based on its combina-\ntion of covariate values. Summary statistics based on these augmented\nweights can be interpreted as estimates of the value expected in the group\nof interest if it had the same distribution of covariates as found in a refer-\nence population (here, all sampled Veterans).\nTo account for stratification and multi-stage sampling in NHANES,\nthe svy survey data commands in Stata 11.0 were used for all analyses\n(Stata, College Station, TX). P values were based on Pearson's 2 statis-\ntic, corrected for the survey design and converted to an F-statistic (18).\nP values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 1 compares the distribution of several sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics between non-Veterans and Veterans\nin the study sample. Compared with non-Veterans, Veterans\nwere generally older, were much more likely to be males, were\npredominantly non-Hispanic whites, and had generally higher\neducational attainment. A much larger percentage of Veterans\nwere former smokers, but the prevalence of current smoking\nwas similar.\nOverall, about one-third of both Veterans and non-\nVeterans\nwere classified as obese on the basis of having a directly meas-\nured BMI  30kg/m2 (Table 2). Fewer than 2% of either group\nwere underweight (BMI < 18.5kg/m2). A larger proportion\nadjusted to the age, gender, and race/ethnicity distribution of\nVeterans, the two groups were similarly distributed among the\nBMI categories. Further adjustment for education (as catego-\nrized in Table 1) yielded only slight incremental differences.\nPastpublishedcomparisonsofexcessweightbetweennational\nsamples of Veterans vs. demographically similar non-Veterans\nused BRFSS data (5,6) and were thus based on height and weight\nas self-reported in a telephone survey. To help isolate the influ-\nence of method of BMI measurement (based on self-reported\nvs. directly measured height and weight), Table 3 compares\nBMI by both methods on NHANES participants. The distribu-\ntion among obesity/overweight categories by directly measured\nBMI was shifted upward in relation to the BMI distribution by\nself-report in both Veterans and non-Veterans. By self-report,\nabout 28\u00ad29% of both groups were classified as obese, while by\ndirect measurement, about 32\u00ad33% of both groups were obese.\nNonetheless, the prevalence of obesity was nearly equal between\nVeterans and non-Veterans classified by the same method. By\neither method, differences between Veterans and non-Veterans\nwere largely confined to the normal and overweight categories:\noverweight was more common, and normal weight less com-\nmon, in Veterans than in non-Veterans. This difference was sta-\ntistically significant in the self-reported comparison, but not in\nthe directly measured comparison.\nTable 3 also compares Veterans and non-Veterans of similar\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity on other measures of adiposity.\nOn waist circumference, the distribution in Veterans tended\nto be shifted toward larger values than in non-Veterans, with\nthe largest excess prevalence in the next-to-highest category.\nOn waist-stature ratio, which aims to correct waist circumfer-\nence for height differences, the distribution among Veterans\nwas more concentrated in the two middle categories, with\nproportionally fewer Veterans in the lowest and highest cat-\negories. On percent body fat as measured by DXA, the distri-\nbution among Veterans was even more concentrated in the two\nmiddle categories (25\u00ad34.9% body fat), with a notably smaller\narticles\nepidemiology\nthe most obese category (35+% body fat).\nTable 4 shows results concerning possible differences in\nthe trajectory of weight gain over the life course between\nVeterans and non-Veterans. Respondents in the interview\npart of NHANES were asked to recall their height and weight\nat age 25 years, which was then used to estimate BMI retro-\nspectively at that age. The age-25 BMI for each participant was\nthen compared to his/her BMI (from self-reported height and\nweight) at the time of the examination. Because the amount\nof time between age 25 and age at examination varied among\nthe age strata, mean annual change in BMI was calculated to\nfacilitate comparisons. For this analysis, only subjects aged\n30 years or older at examination time were included, so that\nsufficient time had passed between age 25 and their current\nage. Three 15-year age groups were used to achieve a relatively\neven distribution of subjects among the groups. The mean rate\nof change in BMI was nearly identical between Veterans and\nTable 1Demographic characteristics of NHANES sample\nCharacteristic\nNon-Veterans Veterans\n% n % n\nAge (years)\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nSmoking status\nTable 2Directly measured BMI distribution (in %) among\nVeterans and non-Veterans, adjusted for selected\ncombinations of sociodemographic characteristics\nDirectly measured BMI (kg/m2)\nP\nNon-Veterans, adjusteda for\n Age, gender,\n race/ethnicity\n Age, gender,\n race/ethnicity,\n education\naAdjusted to distribution of covariates in Veterans.\nTable 3Comparison of selected measures of adiposity\nbetweenVeterans and non-Veterans,adjusted for age,gender,\nand race/ethnicity\nPercent among:\nNon-Veterans Veterans P\nBMI (kg/m2)\nDXA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\nsurvey years.\narticles\nepidemiology\nexamination. However, in the youngest age group, the rate of\nincrease in BMI was significantly greater among Veterans than\namong non-Veterans.\nLastly, Table 5 addresses the frequency of self-reported\nweight-control behaviors among NHANES participants by\nBMI category, comparing Veterans and demographically simi-\nlar non-Veterans. Overweight Veterans were 3\u00ad4 percentage\npoints more likely to report trying to lose weight or maintain\ntheir weight, compared to overweight non-Veterans, although\nthese differences were of only borderline statistical signifi-\ncance. Otherwise, the groups were similar.\nDiscussion\nTo what extent are obesity and overweight more prevalent in\nUS Veterans than in demographically similar non-Veterans?\nThe answer to this question can help quantify the burden of\nobesity and obesity-related diseases on Veterans and on the\npublicly funded health care resources that they use. It may\nalso contribute to judging the long-term impacts of health\nhabits influenced by military service, including diet, exercise,\nand smoking. Because both body weight and percent body fat\ntend to be greater in older age groups in large national surveys\n(12,16) (particularly after accounting for birth-cohort effects),\nit was important to adjust for age differences between Veterans\nand non-Veterans.\nWe found that whether Veteran status is a risk factor for\nexcess body weight depends to a large extent on how adiposity\nis measured and how \"excess body weight\" is defined. When\nassessed with BMI using directly measured height and weight,\nobesity defined as BMI  30kg/m2 was about equally prevalent\nin Veterans and non-Veterans after adjusting for differences in\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity. The prevalence of overweight\nmore common in Veterans than in demographically similar\nnon-Veterans when based on directly measured height and\nweight, or about three percentage points more prevalent when\nbased on self-reported height and weight. (Only by self-report\nwas the difference statistically significant.) A roughly similar\npattern was observed for waist-stature ratio which, like BMI,\ninvolves a simple correction for height. For waist circumfer-\nence, the distribution among Veterans appeared to be shifted\nupward rather than being more concentrated in the middle of\nthe distribution. Yet another answer was provided by percent\nbody fat as assessed by DXA: Veterans were less likely to fall\ninto the high-body-fat (35+%) or low-body-fat (<25%) catego-\nries and more likely to have 25\u00ad35% body fat by DXA, toward\nthe middle of the population distribution.\nThe study also provided further evidence about bias in\nBMI when based on self-reported height and weight. In both\nVeterans and non-Veterans, BMI calculated from self-reported\nheight and weight tended to be lower than BMI calculated\nfrom direct measurements. The prevalence of BMI-defined\nobesity (30kg/m2) was about four percentage points greater\nwhen based on directly measured height and weight than\nwhen based on self-reported height and weight in both groups.\nSmaller discrepancies in the prevalence of BMI-defined over-\nTable 4Change over time in BMI between Veterans and non-Veterans, by age at examination, adjusted for gender and race/\nethnicity\nAge in years at examination\nMean \u00b1 s.d.\nNon-Veterans Veterans P\nTable 5 Weight-control behaviors reported used, by BMI\ncategory and Veteran status, adjusted for age, gender, and\nrace/ethnicity\nBehavior; BMI at examination\nPercent reporting\nbehavior among:\nP\nNon-Veterans Veterans\nTried to lose weight in past year\nTried to maintain weight in past year\nSought weight loss help from health professional\n(among those trying to lose weight)\narticles\nepidemiology\nthere was little evidence of any differential bias between\nVeterans and non-Veterans. This conclusion would lend sup-\nport to previous comparative studies based on self-reported\nBMI (e.g., (4\u00ad6,19)) using much larger sample sizes.\nHowever, the DXA comparisons in this study raise questions\nabout the validity of BMI itself as an indicator of adiposity in\nVeterans. Judging by BMI, Veterans were equally likely to be\nobese and somewhat more likely to be overweight than demo-\ngraphically similar non-Veterans, whereas Veterans were found\nto be less likely to have high (35+%) body fat content on DXA\nscanning than demographically similar non-Veterans. These\napparent discrepancies suggest that concerns expressed about\nthe validity of BMI as an adiposity measure in physically fit\nindividuals (10,11) may apply beyond just professional athletes\nand active-duty military personnel. Other authors (20) have\nquestioned whether BMI controls adequately for stature--\na relevant concern inasmuch as Veterans tended to be taller\nthan non-Veterans of similar age, gender, and race/ethnicity\nin the NHANES sample (data not shown). Another possibility\nis that even though average percent body fat may be lower in\nVeterans, its anatomical distribution may differ, with more fat\nconcentrated in the abdomen among Veterans.\nBased on these findings, clinicians providing care to Veterans\nmay want to use extra caution when interpreting BMI as an\nindicator of adiposity. BMI values just above 25kg/m2 in a\nphysically fit Veteran may classify the individual as overweight,\neven though DXA would not reveal excess body fat.\nIn light of our results, descriptions of changes in adiposity\nover the life course would ideally be assessed by serial DXA\nscans for body-fat measurement on a panel of individuals as\nthey aged. In the absence of such evidence, NHANES data do\npermit retrospective description of trends in adiposity over the\nlife course based on self-reported BMI. We found that the rate\nof increase in BMI since age 25 years was significantly greater\nfor Veterans aged 30\u00ad44 years at the time of NHANES partici-\npation than among comparably aged non-Veterans. With later\nage at examination, the Veteran/non-Veteran differences in rate\nof change of BMI disappeared. Although no information was\navailable about the age at which each Veteran separated from\nmilitary service, a typical pattern would involve a few years of\nactive duty as a young adult, followed by a transition to Veteran\nstatus. Thus, a possible interpretation of these findings is that\na \"burst\" of weight gain may occur in the first few years after\nseparating from the military, followed by gradual convergence\nto the same pattern of weight gain with age seen in non-Veter-\nans. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings from\nthe Millennium Cohort Study, involving periodic surveys of a\ncohort of military personnel during and after active duty (21).\nAlthough NHANES data have many strengths, several limi-\ntations of this study should be kept in mind. Although we\ncombined data over a 10-year period, sample sizes remained\nmodest in comparison to the much larger national telephone\nsurvey samples that have been used to compare Veterans and\nnon-Veterans. Arguably the most accurate measure of adipos-\nity, percent body fat based on DXA scanning, was part of the\nNHANES examination protocol only in certain survey years,\nresulting in further diminution of sample size. No details were\navailable about the duration of active duty or timing of separa-\ntion from military service. Previous studies based on BRFSS\ndata have suggested important differences within Veterans\naccording to whether they did or did not receive health care\nthrough the VA, which bears on the degree to which obesity\nposes a special burden to publicly financed care for Veterans.\nNo data on VA health care use were available in NHANES.\nFinally, we found a glimmer of hope in the comparison\nof self-reported weight-control behaviors among NHANES\nrespondents. In comparison with non-Veterans in the same\nBMI category, overweight Veterans were somewhat more likely\nto report that they were trying to lose or maintain weight.\nConceivably, military service may inculcate a leaner, fitter\ndesirable body image that may persist into later life. If so, per-\nhaps weight-control programs in Veterans may be able to capi-\ntalize on that difference in readiness to change when seeking to\nmotivate healthy dietary and exercise behaviors.\n"
