Himes2\n'Center for Demographic Studies, Duke University.\n2Center for Policy Research, Syracuse University.\nOne factor thought to contribute to higher levels of stress among caregivers is the restriction on personal time.and\nleisure activities that theyfeel. We use datafrom the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to exam-\nine the influences that caregiving, the relationship of the care-recipient with the caregiver, and the intensity of the\ncaregiving have on women's participation in personal, family-centered, and community activities. We find that care-\ngiving, regardless of age, does not, reduce the frequency of participation in voluntary activities. In fact, among\nyounger women, some types of caregiving are associated with significantly higher levels of participation. Based on\nour results, we conclude that caregiving does not necessarily result in a \"loss of self.\" Caregivers may be using out-\nside activities as a way to relieve the stress of the caregiving tasks; caregivers may be particularly adept at balancing\nroles, or most caregiving may not be at a level of intensity sufficient to interfere with other activities.\nDIFFICULTIES relating to the \"caregiver\" role of\nwomen continue to be emphasized in current research\nand media. Are women trapped by attending to the needs of\none or more generations of care-recipients as their parents,\ngrandparents, spouses, and other kin become infirm? Are\ncaregiving women simultaneously pulled by the obligations\nof multiple roles as a parent, spouse, and employee? And if\nso, is this at the expense and restriction of their voluntary\nor leisure activities? This research addresses whether the\nincreased competition for midlife and older women's time\nby their family, caregiving, and employment roles dimin-\nishes their participation in other activities.\nCurrent and future demographic transformations have\nthe potential to change the familial responsibilities of\nwomen. The growing numbers of elderly people and their\nincreased life expectancy may cause subsequent genera-\ntions to delegate greater portions of their time to caregiv-\ning. Recent work by Himes (1994) demonstrated that with\nconstant mortality or slight improvements in the survival of\nthe old, a daughter's lifetime chances of providing parental\ncare range from 55 percent to 75 percent. Expansion of the\ncaregiving role to include physically ill or disabled spous-\nes, children, and others increases these lifetime chances\nsubstantially. Women's increased participation in the paid\nlabor force has contributed a new dimension to family\nissues. Employment in the paid labor market also has the\npotential to influence the cqrrirnunity, personal, or volun-\nteer activities of women. Albeit women -- regardless of\nage -- are impacted by these transitions, it is midlife and\nolder women who may be required to make the greatest\nadjustments as they continue to assume the roles of \"care-\ngiver\" and \"mother\" while being employed (Hagemann-\nWhite, 1984) and requested to assist with community needs\nand organizations.\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the extent to\nwhich women's concurrent roles as caregiver, labor force\nparticipant, and family member restrict their involvement in\nvoluntary activities. This research uses data from the\nNational Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to\nexamine the influence of caregiving and market work on the\nlikelihood of participating in personal, family-centered, and\ncommunity activities. Secondly, this research explores pos-\nsible differentials in the limitation of caregivers' activities\nby the relationship of the care-recipient with the caregiver\nand by the intensity of the caregiving relationship. Finally,\nacknowledging that midlife and older women have different\nmarket work experiences and familial relationships, this\nstudy provides a contrast of the impact of caregiving on the\nparticipation levels of midlife and older women.\nBackground Issues\nWomen continue to strongly associate with the caregiv-\ning role -- nearly three-quarters of the caregivers for elders\nare women (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Women are\nalso the primary caregivers for nonelderly disabled or ill\nchildren, spouses, and other family members (Lee, 1992).\nThe range of activities considered as \"caregiving\" varies\nwidely from study to study, including visiting, managing\nhousehold tasks, providing transportation, and the direct\nprovision of personal care. It is likely that many of the con-\nflicting or ambiguous research results in the caregiving lit-\nerature are, at least in part, the result of differences in the\ndefinition of care (Stone, 1991). In addition to variations in\nthe types of activities provided, caregiving can vary dra-\nmatically in duration and intensity (Himes, Jordan, and\nFarkas, 1996). These differences may be just as important\nin determining the effects of caregiving as the types of\nactivities included.\nSeveral empirical studies have contributed to our under-\nstanding of the influence of caregiving on the personal lives\nof women. These studies have often addressed the related\nissues of the sources of stress experienced by caregivers\nand the effect of the caregiving role on the caregiver's life\nsatisfaction. Stress among caregivers is thought to be the\nproduct of a variety of processes, some the result of the\ntype of physical and psychological problems presented by\nthe care-recipient (Kinney and Stephens, 1989; Schulz,\nTompkins, and Rau, 1988; Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peter-\nson, 1980), others the result of the competing demands on\nthe time of the caregiver (George and Gwyther, 1986;\nOne source of stress is the \"loss of self described by Skaff\nand Pearlin (1992). They theorize that the responsibilities\nof the multiple roles occupied by caregivers result in a\nreduction of roles, leading to a loss of the sense of self-\nidentity. In various forms, this hypothesis has been tested\nby researchers examining the roles of employee and spouse\nin combination with caregiving.\nThe fear that the increased participation of women in the\nlabor force will diminish caregiving has resulted in several\nstudies addressing the influence of paid employment on\ncaregiving. In general, two questions are raised in these\nstudies: (1) Are caregiving and employment compatible?,\nthat is, does employment prevent or limit caregiving activi-\nties or, conversely, does caregiving limit employment? and\n(2) Does employment, in addition to caregiving, result in\nincreased levels of stress among caregivers? The answers to\nboth questions are, so far, ambiguous. Studies examining\nthe relationship between employment and caregiving have\ngenerally found high levels of employment among care-\ngivers. Using data from the National Long Term Care Sur-\nvey, Stone and Short (1990) find that caregivers may modi-\nfy their work schedules, but the decision to work is related\nto factors other than care responsibilities. Other studies find\nhigher rates of absenteeism, tardiness, and reduced produc-\ntivity among workers who are also caregivers (Gibeau and\nployed daughters provide less care to impaired elderly than\nnonemployed daughters, but employed caregivers report\ngreater role strain. Based on their examination of two\ncohorts of women, however, Moen and her colleagues\n(Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994; Robison, Moen, and\nDempster-McClain, 1995) find no evidence that increased\nfemale labor force participation has decreased caregiving\nresponsibilities overall. In fact, they find that women in the\nyounger cohort studied were more likely to be caregivers,\ndespite their greater labor force participation.\nIn a series of studies, Scharlach and colleagues have\nexamined workers in several different settings who are car-\ning for relatives. Scharlach and Boyd (1989) document the\nincreased levels of job disruption among working care-\ngivers. Scharlach and Fredriksen (1994) conclude that care-\ngivers to disabled care-recipients between the ages of 18\nand 64 have greater role strain than caregivers providing\ncare to those 65 and older. They also find that employer-\nsponsored programs are designed to alleviate elder care dif-\nficulties, yet often neglect to recognize the needs of care-\ngivers to the nonelderly. In a different study population,\nScharlach (1994) finds that employment may complement,\nrather than compete with, the caregiving role. Many work-\ning caregivers find satisfaction in their ability to successful-\nly combine the two roles and find that employment pro-\nvides a respite from care responsibilities.\nThe role of wife might serve as an additional source of\nstress for caregivers. The positive and negative benefits of\nthis role, in addition to the parental caregiving role, were\nthe focus of recent research by Stephens and Franks (1995).\nTheir examination of the roles of spouse and caregiver for a\nsample of couples in which the woman was providing\nparental care reveals that caregiving generally creates nega-\ntive spillover into the spousal role for women. However,\nthe wife role provides some buffering for the negative\neffects of caregiving. Further research indicated that a hus-\nband's support of a wife's caregiving activities may\nincrease marital satisfaction, although that support may not\nserve as a buffer to the stresses of caregiving (Franks and\nnot find that wives' parent-care responsibilities negatively\naffected husbands' marital satisfaction. Work by Lang and\nBrody (1983) highlights the dilemma faced by midlife\nwomen with competing roles. Looking at the additional\nroles encountered by women meeting the needs of aging\nparents, they found that parental caregiving was dependent\non the woman's work and marital status, as well as the resi-\ndential status of the elderly parent. However, they con-\ncluded that competing roles of midlife women did not sig-\nnificantly reduce their caregiving activities.\nSpitze and Logan (1990) also raise critical issues regard-\ning the validity of the characterization of midlife women\nassisting aging parents as divided by competing family and\nemployment demands. They questioned the appraisal of the\npotential problems experienced by caregivers implied by\nother research by asking, \"How typical was the caregiving\nexperience for middle-aged women?\" They conclude that it\nis the atypical individual who simultaneously experiences\nthe pulls of work, aging parents, in-laws, and dependent\nchildren. More recent work by Rosenthal and colleagues\n(Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews, 1996) finds\nthat among Canadian men and women, the simultaneous\noccupation of the roles of caregiver, parent, and employee\nis not typical. In an accompanying editorial, Soldo (1996)\nemphasizes, however, that an understanding of the burden\non middle-aged adults requires the consideration of the full\nrange of the type of transfers (including time, money, and\ncare) in families, and the broader family structure in which\nthey take place.\nThe roles of employee, spouse, and mother are more sta-\nble than other roles that a caregiver might occupy. As com-\npetition for time and energy increases, the area in which\nrole reduction is most often thought to take place is in the\nleisure and supplemental activities of caregivers -- social\norganization, church, and recreational activities, and infor-\nmal visiting with family and friends. While a reduction in\nthe time available for these activities is often reported to be\na source of stress among caregivers (Cantor, 1983; George\nwork has been done to quantify the extent to which care-\ngivers participate in these types of activities, differences in\nthe types of activities affected, or the relationship between\nthe duration and intensity of the care responsibilities and\nactivity limitation.\nIn their examination of indicators of caregiver well-\nbeing, George and Gwyther (1986) find that elderly care-\ngivers are less likely to participate in social activities than\nother community members their age. Their work, however,\nwas based on a selected population of both caregivers and\nnoncaregivers. Miller and Montgomery (1990) used data\nfrom the nationally representative 1982 National Long\nTerm Care Survey to measure limitations in social activities\namong caregivers. They find that caregivers who subjec-\ntively assess their caregiving demands as high are more\nlikely to report perceived limitations in social activities,\neven when objective measures of care demands are similar.\nHowever, they were limited by the survey's design, which\ndoes not allow for an objective measure of social activities\nnor for a comparison between caregivers and noncare-\ngivers. Hoyert and Seltzer (1992) were able to overcome\nmost of these difficulties through an examination of data\nfrom the National Survey of Families and Households.\nThey find that caregivers report higher levels of participa-\ntion in social activities when compared to noncaregivers.\nUnfortunately, they do not distinguish the effects by age\nnor by the type of activity. Caregiving has a definite age\npattern, with those caring for spouses on average older than\nthose caring for parents, and those caring for parents on\naverage older than those caring for adult children. Since\nsocial activities are also likely to have distinct age patterns,\nbased on the work experience, household composition, and\neducational level of the caregiver, age becomes an impor-\ntant factor in the quantity and type of social activity\nengagement. In addition, Hoyert and Seltzer did not exam-\nine the joint effects of caregiving and employment on the\nsocial activities of caregiving women.\nOn balance, an evaluation of the literature suggests that\ncaregiving may restrict participation in personal, family,\nand community activities, especially among employed\nwomen. In addition, the experience of women caring for an\nelderly parent may differ from that of women caring for\nchildren or other relatives. The goal of our research is to\nexamine the extent to which participation in voluntary\nactivities is restricted by caregiving tasks. We expect to find\ndifferences in participation based on the relationship\nbetween the caregiver and the care recipient, the employ-\nment status of the caregiver, the duration and intensity of\nthe caregiving, and the cohort membership of the caregiver.\nMETHODS\nThe first wave of the 1988 National Survey of Families\nand Households (NSFH, 1990) was selected for this study.\nRespondents in the survey were drawn from a nationally\nrepresentative sample utilizing a multi-stage area probabili-\nty sample design. The survey, conducted in 1987 and early\nover. The primary sampling unit for this survey was the\nindividual, rather than the family or household. The data\nwere collected verbally using a personal interview with an\nadditional self-administered questionnaire portion. The sur-\nvey gathered retrospective household, family, and individu-\nal characteristics of the primary respondent and included\nseveral sections on the respondent's provision of assistance\nactivities to seriously ill or disabled coresidential and non-\ncoresidential kin members, friends, and nonrelatives.\nFrom the NSFH survey's main sample of respondents\nwho provided information on their voluntary activities,\n3,808 respondents were identified as women born between\nand 55 to 74, to capture and contrast the diversity in roles\nacross the life course. Sixty percent of the respondents\nCohort analysis has a long history in sociology and\ngerontology, influenced to a great extent by the work of\nForner, 1994). Part of our interest is an examination of the\neffects of cohort membership on activity participation. The\nanalysis of cohorts, rather than a strict analysis by age,\nallows us to compare groups of women with similar sets of\nexperiences. We expect, for example, that the influence of\nemployment may be different for older women, many of\nwhom did not have lifetime careers, than for younger\nwomen who are more likely to have been in the workforce\ncontinuously. Analysis by cohorts allows us to control not\nonly the different experiences of individuals, but also, to\nsome extent, the context in which those experiences take\nplace.\nDependent variables. -- The variables of interest are\nparticipation in voluntary activities unrelated to work and\nbeyond the normative roles of parent, grandparent, and\nwife. Role involvement in voluntary activities is defined as\nactive participation or volunteering in organizations or\nactivities outside the household. The NSFH included ques-\ntions regarding participation in a variety of these activities.\nIn total, the frequency of participation was measured for\nnine specific types of activities and four types of social vis-\nits. In addition, one question tapped the frequency of social\nactivities with groups of friends. A factor analysis revealed\nthat these activities and organizations could be clustered in\nthree areas: family-centered activities, formally structured\ngroup activities, and casual activities and visiting (Table 1).\nThe first composite measure includes a variety of family-\ncentered activities -- church-affiliated groups, youth\ngroups, school-related groups, and sports groups. These\nactivities are likely to involve several members of a family,\nespecially children. Although they may be considered struc-\ntured activities, the emphasis is not primarily on individual\nenrichment. The second composite measure, formal groups,\nincludes participation in service clubs, hobby or garden\ngroups, professional or academic societies, and literature or\nart groups. These groups have in common an emphasis on\nregular meetings and activities, a focus on personal growth\nor enrichment, and a generally more structured format. The\nthird composite measure incorporates less structured activi-\nties such as visiting with relatives, neighbors, colleagues\nfrom work, or friends from outside the neighborhood,\nattending social events at church or synagogue, and partici-\nTable 1.

These activities are more informal than those included\nin the other two measures and the emphasis is on socializ-\ning. They are less likely to be regularly scheduled, and par-\nticipation is more flexible.\nFor each activity, respondents were asked to report the\nfrequency of their participation as: never, a few times a\nyear, about once a month, about once a week, or several\ntimes a week. Several different methods of scoring partici-\npation were considered, including a variety of weighting\nschemes for the frequency of participation, weighting com-\nbined frequencies of participation, and a simple dichoto-\nmous measure of participation. Our final models are based\non a scheme which translates the reported frequency levels\ninto monthly approximations. The participation scale is cre-\nated from the reported frequency of participation in each\nindividual activity. Those women reporting no participation\nin an individual activity are given scores of 0 for that activ-\nity, while women who reported participating a few times in\nthe past year, but less than monthly, are given scores of 0.5.\nMonthly participation is scored as a 1; weekly participation\nis scored as a 4; and greater than weekly participation is\ngiven a score of 12. The scores for individual activities are\nthen summed across activities within a group to obtain a\ngroup activity score. For family and formal activity, these\ncomposite scores range from 0 to 48, and for casual activi-\nties and visiting the scores range from 0 to 72.\nExplanatory variables. -- The provision of care to seri-\nously ill or disabled coresidential and non-coresidential fam-\nily and friends over the past 12 months and the woman's\ncurrent employment status are the explanatory variables of\ninterest in our models. We use three concepts to capture the\nmultidimensionality of the caregiving process.\nThe first caregiving concept is a global caregiving mea-\nsure designed to evaluate the influence of providing non-\npaid physical care to any individual regardless of the care-\ngiver's relationship to the care recipient or the intensity of\nthe caregiving experience. A dichotomous measure of care-\ngiving was derived based on the answers to a series of\nquestions in the NSFH regarding the provision of care to\nany person in or out of the household in the past year due to\nhis or her serious illness or disability. This definition should\nexclude the ordinary care of children in the household, care\nprovided during short acute illnesses, or incidental assis-\ntance provided to friends or family. It might include the\nroutine care of a chronically ill child, the provision of\nhousehold assistance to a parent or other person (if that\nassistance is needed because of a disability), or the provi-\nsion of physical care during a serious illness. For this study,\nwomen who had provided care to any ill or disabled kin\nmember, friend, or non-relative over the past 12 months are\ndefined as caregivers.\nThe intent of the second caregiving concept is to examine\nif the relationship of the caregiver to the care-recipient influ-\nences the caregiver's participation in voluntary activities.\nFour dichotomous variables were created to identify the\ncare-recipient's relationship to the caregiver. Women who\nprovided physical care to an ill or disabled parent, parent in-\nlaw, or step-parent over the past 12 months are considered to\nbe parental caregivers, while women who provided care to\nan ill or disabled spouse during the past year are considered\nto be spousal caregivers. Similarly, women who provided\nphysical care to an ill or disabled biological child or\nstepchild are considered child caregivers. Finally, women\nwho provided physical care to an ill or disabled sibling,\nstep-sibling, grandchild, grandparent, other kin member, or\nnon-kin person are considered to be \"other\" caregivers.\nThe third set of caregiving variables measures the dura-\ntion and intensity of the caregiving experience. The NSFH\nincludes several questions that (a) identify whether the\ncare-recipient resided with the caregiver, and (b) for non-\ncoresidential care-recipients, the number of weeks and\nhours per week the caregiver provided physical care over\nthe past 12 months. We use these questions to create five\ndichotomous variables assessing the influence of the dura-\ntion and intensity of the caregiving experience. If the care-\nrecipients lived in the same household as the caregiver, the\nwomen are considered coresident caregivers. Four mea-\nsures combining the number of weeks and hours spent care-\ngiving by non-coresidential caregivers were created to cap-\nture the variation in out-of-home care activities. The\nmeasures of duration and intensity are highly skewed, with\nmost caregivers reporting shorter durations and lower\nintensities. Our goal was to create categories which are eas-\nily interpreted and replicated. In order to preserve compara-\nbility, previously defined categories of care duration and\nintensity groups were used (Himes, Jordan, and Farkas,\nhours a day. The four groups are defined as:\nSHORT/LOW caregivers provided care during 26 or\nfewer weeks in the past year and for fewer than 14 hours\nper week.\nSHORT/HIGH caregivers provided care during 26 or\nfewer weeks in the past year and for 14 or more hours\nper week.\nLONG/LOW caregivers provided care during more than\n26 weeks in the past year and for fewer than 14 hours per\nweek.\nLONG/HIGH caregivers provided care during more than\n26 weeks in the past year and for 14 or more hours per\nweek.\nA small fraction of the women provided care to two or\nmore persons in the past 12 months (20% of midlife women\nand 19% of older women). For women providing care to\ntwo or more non-coresidential persons, the survey asked for\nduration (weeks) and intensity (hours) only for the person\nthat the caregiver spent the greatest amount of time assist-\ning, and we use that care-recipient to define our caregiving\nmeasures. A small portion of caregivers provided care to\nboth a coresidential and non-coresidential person. In these\ncases, we assume that the coresidential care-recipient pre-\nsents the greatest constraint on the women's time and use\nthat relationship to define the caregiving measures. For\neach of the three multidimensional concept measures of\ncaregiving -- global caregiving, relationship to care-recipi-\nent, and the duration and intensity of caregiving -- the\ncomparison category is women who provided no care to an\nill or disabled person in the past 12 months.\nA simple measure of work status, employed or not, is\nincluded to capture the women's working role. Additional\nroles common to women and women's characteristics are\nincluded in the analysis as background control measures.\nWomen's additional role variables include presence of chil-\ndren in the household, being a grandparent, and the\nwomen's marital status. Respondent's health has been\nshown to impact kin assistance and activities; therefore,\nself-reported health was included as a background control\nmeasure. Background measures also control for the\nwomen's educational attainment, ethnicity, and income.\nAnalysis. -- Descriptive statistics are used initially to\nexamine whether differences are found by caregiving and\nemployment on the levels of participation in the three activ-\nity groups for each age interval of women. Multivariate\nmodels are then used to estimate the influence of caregiving\nand employment on the likelihood of participation in volun-\ntary activities. For each cohort, a series of models are esti-\nmated to explore the effects of each unique caregiving con-\ncept (global care, relationship to the care-recipient, and the\nduration/intensity measures) on each outcome variable.\nThis results in nine separate models for each cohort of\nwomen. Because activity participation levels are defined as\nratio scales, ordinary least squares models are appropriate\nfor estimation.\nRESULTS\nTable 2 provides descriptive information on the level of\nparticipation in the three activity groups, employment sta-\ntus, and demographic characteristics for caregivers and\nnoncaregivers. Caregiving is slightly more common among\nwomen in the midlife group are caregivers compared to\nin family-centered activities is higher among the younger\nTable 2.

This high level of participation is most likely a\nreflection of the greater likelihood of these women having a\nchild at home. The difference in participation is smaller for\nformal activities, where caregiving midlife women have the\nhighest mean level of participation and noncaregiving older\nwomen the lowest. The most common type of activity for\nall groups is visiting and casual social activities. Again, the\nyounger cohort of women has higher levels of participation\nthan the older women. Although the differences between\ngroups may be substantively different, none of the differ-\nences is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nThe descriptive measures support the distinction of\nwomen at different stages of the life course. Younger\nwomen are more likely than the older cohort to be\nemployed, married, and to have children at home. Midlife\nwomen who are not caregivers have the highest levels of\nemployment, 72 percent, and older women who are not\ncaregivers the lowest level, 28 percent. In additional analy-\nsis, among employed midlife women who had provided\nor more hours per week. Essentially all employed older\ncaregiving women worked 20 or more hours per week (data\nnot shown).\nThe mean age of the midlife women cohort is about 43\nyears while women in the older cohort were 64 years old on\naverage. There is little difference in health status among the\nwomen, either by age or caregiving status. Midlife women\nhave higher incomes than older women by $6,000 to\n$8,000. Midlife caregiving women are most likely to be\nmarried, and noncaregiving older women the least likely.\nCaregivers of all ages are slightly less likely to be Black\nthan noncaregivers. Few older women had a child residing\nin the household (about 17 percent overall), but over 70\npercent of midlife women reported that a child remained in\nthe household. Just over 25 percent of all midlife women\nbut nearly 70 percent of the older women were grandmoth-\ners. Older women had fewer years of completed schooling\nthan midlife women; 62 percent of older women had com-\npleted 12 or more years of school versus 81 percent of\nmidlife women.\nAlthough the proportion of women in each cohort pro-\nviding care is similar, the recipients of that care differ\nTable 3. Distribution of Caregivers by Care-Recipient\nand Duration and Intensity of Caregiving\nVariable Midlife Women Older Women\nCare-Recipient\nDuration and Intensity of Care\nShort/Low 7\nLong/Low 7\n(Table 3). For both groups of women, parents were the\nmost common care-recipient; 53 percent of midlife women\nand 36 percent of older women were caring for a parent.\nHowever, older women are much more likely to be provid-\ning care to a spouse or other person than midlife women.\nMore older women coreside with the care recipient (45% vs\n33% for midlife women). However, the distribution of the\nremaining caregivers among duration and intensity groups\nvaries little by age.\nFigure 1 shows the participation of midlife and older\nwomen in the three activity groups when considering both\ncaregiving and employment status. Among the younger\ncohort, working women who are also caregivers have, with\none slight exception, the highest levels of participation in\nall activities. This difference is significant at the .10 level\nfor all three activity types when working caregivers are\ncompared to nonworking, noncaregivers. So, among care-\ngivers, working and caregiving together are associated with\nhigher, rather than lower, levels of participation. For casual\nactivities, women who are caregivers, whether they work or\nnot, have significantly higher levels of activity participation\nthan their noncaregiving counterparts. Among the older\ncohort of women, working women who are not caregivers\nhave significantly higher levels of participation in both\nfamily and formal activities than women who are neither\nworking nor caregiving. Levels of participation in casual\nactivities do not vary significantly among the groups of\nolder women. These results indicate that caregiving and\nMean Midlife Women\nMean Older Women\n....\nI\nCH Nonworking/Care\nSS3 Nonworking/No Care\nFigure 1.

The\nresults for the full models are available upon request.\nwork may operate differently for the two groups; work tends\nto lead to higher levels of participation for both groups, but\nfor the older cohort the combination of caregiving and\nwork is associated with some reduction in participation.\nAmong the younger cohort, the combination of work and\ncaregiving leads to the highest levels of participation.\nMultivariate results. -- Table 4 provides a summary of\nthe multivariate results for the caregiving measures on the\nlevel of participation in family-centered, formal, and casual\nactivities net of women's normative parent, grandparent,\nand marital roles, and net of education, income, health, and\nrace (complete models are available upon request).\nThe first set of models examines the effect of the global\nmeasure of caregiving and work status on participation in\neach activity (shown in the first panel of Table 4). Neither\ncaregiving nor work has a consistent effect on women's\nparticipation in voluntary activities. Contrary to expecta-\ntions, caregiving does not seem to significantly reduce par-\nticipation levels. In one case, participation in casual activi-\nties for younger women, caregiving has a statistically\nsignificant positive effect -- caregivers have higher levels\nof visiting and casual activity. Work tends to have a nega-\ntive effect on activity participation, although the results are\nnot statistically significant. However, the interaction of\ncaregiving and work tends to have a negative effect on\nactivity participation, particularly for the older cohort of\nwomen. For the older women, the combination of work and\ncaregiving leads to lower levels of participation in both\nfamily and formal activities. The importance of this interac-\ntion highlights the additional burdens that older women\nwho have multiple roles may be facing.\nThe control factors in all models show the expected rela-\ntionships to activity participation. Higher levels of educa-\ntion increase participation for all types of activities for both\ncohorts. Being married reduces visiting levels for both\ncohorts, but for younger women marriage increases partici-\npation in family-centered activities. Marital status has no\nsignificant effect on participation in formal activities for\neither group of women. Being a grandparent is not statisti-\ncally related to any activity. Having a child at home\nincreases participation in family-centered activities for the\nyoung cohort, but reduces participation in both formal and\ncasual activities for the older cohort of women. Better\nhealth leads to greater participation in all models, but\nincome is not statistically associated with any activity.\nBlack women in both cohorts have higher levels of partici-\npation in family activities. Older Black women are less\nlikely to participate in formal activities, and younger Black\nwomen are more likely to participate in casual social activi-\nties than White women.\nThe second set of caregiving models in Table 4 provides\ninformation on the effect of the relationship of the care-\nrecipient to the caregiver on the caregiver's participation in\nvoluntary activities. Midlife women caring for a parent par-\nticipate in more activities outside the household than non-\ncaregiving women (net of background factors). Among the\nolder cohort, parent care is associated with higher levels of\nparticipation in family and formal activities. Other types of\ncaregiving do not result in a consistent reduction in activity\nparticipation, with no effects reaching statistical signifi-\ncance. Again, work is generally associated with lower lev-\nels of participation.\nSeveral factors may be operating that provide parental\ncaregivers the occasion to participate in social activities.\nOn average, parental caregivers have larger familial net-\nworks to share the caregiving task (Miller and Mont-\ngomery, 1990), and a portion of the higher casual visiting\nobserved for younger parental caregivers may, in part,\nreflect the interactions of the kin network in caring for the\ninfirm parent. Women providing care to other kin or non-\nkin may also share the caregiving responsibilities with oth-\ners, resulting in a less strenuous caregiving schedule. In\naddition, their obligations, perceived or real, may be dimin-\nished to less closely related kin or non-kin care-recipients.\nNevertheless, caregiving women do not significantly dimin-\nish their social activities as a consequence of their caregiv-\ning obligations, and in some instances are likely to have\nhigher levels of participation in voluntary activities than\nnoncaregiving women.\nThe third set of caregiving models in Table 4 evaluates\nthe effect of the duration and intensity of the caregiving\nepisode on the midlife women's participation in voluntary\nactivities. The strongest effects are seen for caregiving of\nshort duration and high intensity. For all women, this type\nof care seems to have a positive effect on activity participa-\ntion (net of background factors). Unexpectedly, women\nwith a coresident care-recipient do not significantly reduce\ntheir voluntary activities compared to noncaregiving\nwomen, although the direction of the effect is generally\nnegative, especially among the older cohort. As in the pre-\nvious analyses, employment exerts a negative effect on par-\nticipation, net of caregiving. The presence of a positive\neffect of caregiving on activity participation in the short-\nduration, high-intensity group may be the result of several\nfactors. The care may have been so short in duration as to\nnot interfere significantly with regular activities. Also, we\ndo not have information on the timing of the caregiving\nwith respect to the activities, so the two may both have\noccurred in the past year, but at different times.\nDISCUSSION\nCompetition for women's limited time when providing\nphysical care to an ill or disabled individual, combined with\nthe roles of labor force participant and family member, has\nthe potential to reduce women's participation in voluntary\nactivities outside the household. Using the NSFH data, our\nstudy evaluated the extent to which midlife and older\nwomen caregivers reduce their participation in voluntary\nactivities. From the results of this study, we conclude that\nwomen do not reduce their outside activities in response to\nadditional caregiving requirements and, in some cases,\ncaregiving is associated with higher levels of participation.\nAmong midlife women, caregivers were no less likely\nthan noncaregivers to participate in all three types of activi-\nties. In the case of casual social activities, caregiving sig-\nnificantly increased participation among midlife women.\nFor older women caregiving was not significantly related to\nparticipation in any of the three activity types. Employment\ngenerally was associated negatively with increased caregiv-\ning. However, the combination of caregiving and work sig-\nnificantly reduced participation in family and formal activi-\nties for older women.\nThe effect of the caregiver-care recipient relationship\nwas most significant when the care recipient was a parent.\nFor all activities, parental care was associated with greater\nlevels of participation among midlife women. It is possible\nthat midlife women caring for a parent have a large net-\nwork of caregiving \"helpers\" that rally behind them and\nallow them the opportunity to participate in voluntary activ-\nities. For the older cohort, there was no consistent relation-\nship of care-recipient to activity participation.\nOur analysis does not examine the role of men in provid-\ning care or supporting caregiving women. It is possible that\nthose caregivers who are able to remain active do so by\nsharing their care responsibilities with their male partners.\nIn addition, we might expect that men, who traditionally\nhave lower levels of participation in social activities and\nless involvement in care activities, may not be as affected\nby caregiving as women. It is not unlikely that the grouping\nof activities for men would be different from that observed\nfor women. Further study should address the kin networks\nof all caregivers across the life course and incorporate all\ncategories of care-recipients.\nThe duration and intensity of care responsibilities also\naffected activity participation. The group which stands out\nare those women in the younger cohort who are providing\nshort, intensive periods of care. The generally higher levels\nof activity participation among these women may indicate a\ngroup of women who are unusually competent and orga-\nnized. They may find that they are called upon as caregivers\nbecause of their ability to relate to others, to be involved in\nvarious activities, and to manage their time. It may also be\ntrue that these periods of care, although intense while they\nlast, do not affect the participation levels of women over\nthe course of a year. Women may find it easier to suspend\nparticipation in activities for a short period of time while\nproviding care, and then resume those activities when the\nepisode of caregiving has ended.\nIn all cases, the lack of differences observed among older\nwomen caregivers and noncaregivers may reflect the gener-\nally lower levels of participation by older women in most\nof the activities measured due to the absence of children in\nthe household, the woman's own health status, and the\nactivity reduction associated with retirement. The differ-\nences may also result from differences in the life experi-\nences of the two cohorts of women. Other research (Robi-\nson, Moen, and Dempster-McClain, 1995) finds that\ncaregiving experiences have increased for younger cohorts.\nAlthough the age ranges they examine both fall within our\n\"older\" women's group, we might expect that the chances\nof a woman being called on to provide care may increase\nfor even younger cohorts because of the increasing life\nexpectancy of the elderly. It is also likely that the types of\nconditions requiring care have and will change over time as\npersons survive longer with debilitating chronic illnesses\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease.\nWhile the richness of the NSFH data allows us to exam-\nine the effects of several factors influencing caregiving and\nactivity participation, there are limitations to the data as\nwell. Significantly, we do not know the timing of the care-\ngiving episodes. Caregiving may have been spread over sev-\neral short periods during the past year, or be concentrated\nin one. Intermittent caregiving is likely to have less of an\neffect on activity participation. In addition, we have limited\ninformation on the extent of the caregivers' involvement in\ncare activities. Self-reports of care activities may result in a\nvariety of experiences being included, ranging from intense\npersonal care to household assistance. Finally, we are limited\nin our ability to determine whether the caregiver has primary\nresponsibility for the care activities, or is part of a wider net-\nwork of care providers. However, the persistent lack of\neffect, or even positive influence of caregiving on activity\nparticipation, lends strength to our general conclusions.\nThe higher levels of social participation among care-\ngivers, which confirm those found by Hoyert and Seltzer\n(1992), cast some doubt on the notion that caregivers suffer\na \"loss of self in the caregiving role. Even when those care-\ngivers who provide the most intensive care are examined,\nsupplemental activity participation is not reduced. It is pos-\nsible that much like the effect proposed for employees, care-\ngivers use their outside activities as a source of relief from\nthe caregiving burdens. Another explanation may lie in the\nvarieties of caregiving experiences among women. Most\nparental caregiving is of limited duration and tends to be\nepisodic, rather than continual (Moen, Robison, and Fields,\n1994). These caregivers may find that their participation in\noutside activities is limited only for short periods of time.\nCaregivers of chronically ill or disabled adult children, on\nthe other hand, may have developed alternative sources of\ncare or coping strategies which allow them free time.\nWhile these explanations might explain why caregivers\nwould have similar levels of participation in outside activi-\nties, they do not explain as easily the higher levels observed\nfor some groups in this study. An explanation might be\nfound in the personality characteristics of caregivers and\nnoncaregivers. For example, are those who are more likely\nto be involved in a numerous assortment of activities more\napt to have additional resources and skills which enable\nthem to provide care? A profile of caregivers as being com-\npetent, involved, and capable is beginning to emerge from\nthe literature. While no researcher denies the added stress\nwhich occurs when the caregiving role is added to the lives\nof women, caregiving women, especially those who are\nemployed, appear to be coping remarkably well. Additional\nresearch on the ways in which women are selected into, and\nout of, the role of caregiver, the ways in which they use a\nvariety of roles to compensate and complement one anoth-\ner, and the successful strategies they employ for managing\ntheir time and responsibilities is likely to improve our\nunderstanding of the needs of caregivers and the types of\nsupport most beneficial to them.\n"
