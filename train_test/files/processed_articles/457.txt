Approximately one million people in the\nUnited States are at risk for development of iron overload,\nattributable primarily to HH; in addition one in 10 non-\nHispanic Whites is a carrier [1,2]. This inborn error of iron\nmetabolism is characterized by excessive dietary iron\nabsorption, which in a subset of patients leads to progres-\nsive iron accumulation and reaching toxic levels by middle\nlife [3,4]. The excess iron is deposited in multiple organs,\ncausing oxidative tissue damage and substantial morbidity.\nThe disease progresses silently and often is not discovered\nuntil irreversible damage has occurred. However, these dis-\nease manifestations can be prevented by therapeutic phle-\nbotomy to remove excess iron [5]. Thus, there is a strong\nrationale for early detection of this treatable condition to\nachieve an optimal outcome.\nMost patients with HH are homozygous for a mutation in\nof the HFE protein [6]. A second common mutation results\nin substitution of aspartic acid for histidine at position 63\n(H63D); its relationship to iron overload is less clear,\nH63D) has been associated with iron overload in some\npatients.\nUniversal screening is not currently recommended by the\nAmerican College of Physicians or the U.S. Preventive\nServices Task Force, although there is value of early\nidentification [7,8]. With no universally accepted screening\nrecommendations for hemochromatosis or iron overload,\ndetection in an undifferentiated patient population in pri-\nmary care is difficult and may lead to detection late in the\ncourse of illness, missing the opportunity for the use of\nappropriate therapy that can prevent clinical manifestations\nAlthough the identification of the HFE gene and the com-\nmon C282Y and H63D mutations related to hemochromato-\nsis suggests potential screening based on these mutations,\nlarge population-based screening studies have shown that\ndisease penetrance in HFE-related hereditary hemochro-\nmatosis is lower than previously believed, making universal\npopulation-based screening for iron overload with genetic\nmarkers unattractive [11]. In addition, although detection of\nHH in presymptomatic stages is desirable, it is also impor-\ntant to identify affected persons who have begun to develop\nearly disease manifestations, and this may have a higher\nyield than population-based screening.\nOne of the problems of identifying patients with HH in\nclinical practice is that the disease manifestations are simi-\nlar to those found in other common disorders. However,\nonce identified, many of the complications can be reversed\nby phlebotomy therapy [12].

Many conditions, like iron overload,\nhave multiple risk factors that might increase the clinician's\nsuspicion and need for screening or targeted case finding.\nA risk score simplifies clinical decision making by taking\nmany risk factors for an outcome and combining them into\na single predictive measure. It is not practical to evaluate\nmentally the relative influence of more than two or three\nrisk factors at a time, so a risk score provides an auto-\nmated way to take into account the relationships among\nrisk factors and is a valuable way to target resources for\ncase finding of individuals with ongoing disease [13,14].\nCurrent guidelines for a number of conditions, such as\nosteoporosis and diabetes, recommend screening or treat-\nment based on the use of risk scores [15,16]. However, no\nmultivariate risk score exists to guide targeted screening for\niron overload. Our goal was to create a tool that indicates\nthe likelihood of undetected iron overload in a general pop-\nulation and that could be easily adapted to clinical practice.\nMaterials and Methods\nDescription of data sets and participants. Data used in this study\nwere derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nsurveys were nationally representative samples of the noninstitutional-\nStates. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program with a\nchanging focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to\nrepresentative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These per-\nsons were located in communities across the country, 15 of which were\nvisited each year. To produce reliable statistics, NHANES over-samples\npersons 60 and older, African Americans, and Hispanics [17]. The\nNHANES includes physical exams, laboratory tests, and interviews with\nour risk score and the NHANES III to validate it. The entire NHANES\nand NHANES III participants 20\u00ad74 years old were used to validate the\nrisk score. Participants 75 years old were excluded from our\nNHANES III data set because an essential question about iron was not\nasked of these persons.\nIdentification of elevated iron measures. Our risk score is intended\nto predict cases with elevated iron measures, potentially indicative of\niron overload in an undifferentiated patient population. Here, the term\nelevated iron measures refer to an individual having both elevated\ntransferrin saturation and elevated serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation\n(%) was calculated as the ratio of serum iron concentration to total iron\nbinding capacity (TIBC) multiplied by 100 in both data sets. Transferrin\nng/ml in women were considered elevated [18].\nCreation of the score in the development data set. Based on its\nproposed use as a way to determine whether further laboratory\nassessment is necessary, the developed risk score did not include\nany laboratory testing and instead focused on an individual's history\nand symptoms. The value of the risk score is that it does not require\nlaboratory tests to increase the suspicion among clinicians that the\npatient may have iron overload and require further screening. Follow-\ning that logic, we examined a variety of candidate variables for inclu-\nsion in the risk score that can be assessed easily by a clinician. We\nchose the list of potential distinguishing predictors based on major\ndisease entities related to hemochromatosis and iron overload (e.g.,\ndiabetes, CHF, liver problem), other signs/symptoms that have been\nidentified from population based studies (e.g., arthritis), and other dis-\nease entities discussed in the literature (e.g., osteoporosis) [5,19,20].\nThe demographic predictor variables tested were as follows: age in\nrace/ethnicity in four categories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, and other race). The clinical variables tested were\nreports of physician diagnosis of arthritis, liver condition, osteoporosis/\nbrittle bones, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and thyroid disease/\nproblem. Patient reports of joint pain/aching/stiffness in the past year\nwere also evaluated.\nwe used SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Park, NC) to perform\nlogistic regression analyses with study design variables and weights,\nwhich made the results generalizable to the noninstitutionalized U.S.\npopulation. The modeling strategy followed was backward elimination.\nVariables not significant at the P < 0.05 level in the first logistic regres-\nsion were removed and logistic regression was repeated to confirm\nthat the slope parameters for variables remaining were still significantly\ndifferent from zero. The same variables were identified using both for-\nward selection and backward elimination strategies.\nCreation of the iron overload risk score (IRON score) followed the\nmethods used in the creation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index [21].\nOdds ratios for elevated iron calculated during the second logistic\nregression were used to assess risk scores. Odds ratios less than 1.3\nreceive a score of 0. Significant odds ratios in the range of 1.30 to 1.49\nreceive a score of 1. Significant odds ratios in the range of 1.50 to 2.49\nreceive a score of 2. Significant odds ratios in the range of 2.50 to 3.49\nreceive a score of 3, etc. The total IRON score was the sum of the\nscores for the individual variables.\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were computed\nusing MedCalc software and the iron overload risk scores for the\nthere was no provision for weighting of data in MedCalc Area Under the\nCurve (AUC) was calculated for the ROC curve. The higher the area\nunder the curve, the more useful the tool is for screening. An AUC of 1.0\nwould indicate a perfect relationship and an AUC of 0.50 indicates there\nis no relationship. We also computed weighted ROC curves using a SAS\nbased procedure. However, this strategy does not allow for computation\nof sensitivity and specificity values for particular iron-overload risk\nscores and does not produce ROC curve graphs [22]. The AUCs calcu-\nlated were virtually the same using weighted (0.712) and unweighted\nTesting of the risk score in other samples. We chose to use the\nNHANES III data set for validating the risk score. The NHANES III was\nincluded in our study because the question about liver condition was\nnot asked of persons 75 years old or older. With the NHANES III, we\ncaused pain, osteoporosis, and thyroid disease for calculation of the\nrisk score as these were the variables that were significant after the\nfirst logistic regression. One other difference between the NHANES\nquestions used to validate the score was a slight difference in the word-\ning of the question asking of self report of physician diagnosed liver\n``liver condition,'' whereas in the NHANES III, the variable was worded\nas ``liver disorder caused pain.'' This would suggest that the responses\nasymptomatic testing.\nIRON scores were computed for the NHANES III sample. These risk\nscores were then evaluated using ROC curves and AUCs calculated\nusing MedCalc software. These analyses were done using unweighted\ndata. The AUCs calculated were virtually the same using weighted data\nResults\nof these individuals are shown in Table I. There were 101\nunweighted cases of individuals with elevated transferrin sat-\nviduals.

The IRON\nscore included five variables with a higher score on the IRON\nscore indicating a greater risk that the patient currently has\nsis of liver condition (no 5 0; yes 5 3), physician diagnosis of\nosteoporosis (no 5 0; yes 5 3), and physician diagnosis of\nthyroid disease/problem (no 5 0; yes 5 3).

The diagnosis may not be suspected\neven in patients with more severe manifestations such as\nliver disease, cardiomyopathy, or diabetes mellitus because\nthese conditions are common in the general population.\nThe risk assessment tool that we developed to help physi-\ncians identify patients who might have hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis may provide an effective strategy for promot-\ning early detection of iron overload and prevention of mor-\nbidity and mortality associated with this condition [23].\nThe IRON score can be used as an assessment tool for\nscreening in clinical and population settings or as a pre-\nscreening tool to help identify potential patients that need\nto have further laboratory testing to assess their iron meas-\nures. This is the first risk score created to assist in identify-\ning patients at risk for current iron overload without a physi-\ncal examination or laboratory assessment. It consists of a\nminimal amount of self reported information that could be\ncollected through either a quick personal history or an elec-\ntronic health record.\nThe IRON score has a predictive utility and AUC values\ntion data set) similar to tools that help to target screening\nfor other chronic conditions, such as diabetes and osteopo-\nrosis [14,24,25]. Three previously published screening tools\nare the TAG-IT (AUC 5 0.740 for development data set;\n0.744 for validation data set) which can be used to identify\npersons likely to have impaired fasting glucose; the FRAX\nmean 5 0.66) used to identify women with at risk for frac-\nture; and the ARIC CHD Risk Calculator (AUC 5 0.721 for\nwomen with diabetes; 0.672 for men with diabetes) for\nassessing cardiovascular risk in persons having diabetes\nmended in the recent scientific statement by the American\nDiabetes Association, American Heart Association and\nAmerican College of Cardiology Foundation (ADA/AHA/\nACCF) on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular\nevents in people with diabetes [16]. This approach is con-\nsistent with the current recommendations for screening and\npreventive treatment for a variety of common conditions by\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force\n(USPSTF) and other organizations.\nConsidering the possible morbidity and mortality from un-\nidentified iron overload, this tool has significant potential for\nimproving care by allowing clinicians to identify affected\nindividuals before the onset of significant clinical manifesta-\ntions without requiring the resources that would be used if\nuniversal genetic or laboratory screening was recom-\nmended. Another benefit is that that instead of calculating\na future risk, it calculates risk of currently having elevated\niron measures which may indicate iron overload. Finally,\nthis tool has potential application as a Web-based screen-\ning instrument to improve awareness and population health\n[26,27]. Further studies to evaluate the cost effectiveness\nof the IRON score to identify patients with current iron over-\nload are needed.\nAlthough the IRON score has potential utility in a clinical\nsetting, we should note limitations in its design. First, this\ntool was developed from cross-sectional data and examines\nonly the likelihood of currently having elevated iron meas-\nures. This score does not predict future risk for developing\niron overload or disease sequelae of iron overload. How-\never, for its suggested purpose of guiding targeted screen-\ning, identifying those currently having elevated iron meas-\nures is most appropriate. However, there is not currently\nuniversal agreement on those levels [18,28]. Second, due\nto the data that were available, different questions had to\nbe used in the developmental data set and validation data\nsets to represent risk score components, specifically when\nliver conditions and NHANES III asked about liver disorder\ncausing pain. This difference limits the predictive ability\nfound in the validation data set, as the more inclusive liver\ncondition question would be expected to perform better\nthan one asking about pain due to a liver condition, which\nwill miss individuals who are pain free but have liver dis-\nease. However, we purposefully did not attempt to use lab-\noratory findings to identify liver disease because we wanted\nthe score to include easily available data. Third, neither the\ntion regarding whether a doctor had ever told the respond-\nent that he or she had hemochromatosis. Consequently, we\ncould not exclude individuals with diagnosed hemochroma-\ntosis from the population. It is likely, however, that most\nindividuals who were successfully managing their disease\nwould not still meet our criteria of elevated iron measures.\nIn conclusion, the IRON score is a tool to assist in identi-\nfication of patients with iron overload that has several qual-\nities that make it attractive for use in clinical practice with\nan undifferentiated patient population including brevity, eas-\nily collected information, and predictive ability comparable\nto other tools that help in directing screening. Future\nresearch may focus on evaluating the utility of the IRON\nscore tool in practice.\n"
