However, no study has examined treatment\ncompliance under the context of physician\u00adindustry relationship. This study developed a conceptual framework of physician\u00ad\nindustry relationship and treatment compliance, and empirically tested patients' treatment compliance and affordability under\nthe physician\u00adindustry relationship in the USA.\nDesign. We first proposed a conceptual framework to analyze different scenarios, where the physician\u00adindustry relationship\ncould impact patients' treatment compliance and affordability, taking into consideration the role of health insurers. We then\nemployed a nationally representative data set to investigate these relationships. Multivariable logistic regressions were employed\nto examine the physician\u00adindustry relationship and the physicians' perception of patients' treatment compliance.\nSetting and Participants. 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey.\nResults. Our results showed that physicians with closer industry relationships were more likely to report rejection of care by\ninability to pay (OR: 1.42, P < 0.01) as the major problems affecting their ability to provide high quality care, when compared\nwith physicians without industry relationships.\nConclusions. Our results shed light on the lack of articulation among industry, physicians and health insurers in the USA. It\nis important to make sure that different agents in the health-care marketplace, such as physicians, industry, and health\ninsurers, coordinate more efficiently to provide quality and consistent care to patients.\n",

Many prescription drugs in the\nmarket would not exist without physicians' involvement in\nclinical trials. Physicians with closer industry relationships,\nhowever, are more likely to request the addition of specific\ndrugs from particular pharmaceutical companies on hospital\nformularies, are more likely to prescribe these companies'\ndrugs and are less likely to prescribe generic medications\nInternational Journal for Quality in Health Care vol. 25 no. 3\n\u00a9 The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press in association with the International Society for Quality in Health Care;\n[1, 3, 9]. Such changes in the use of medications can poten-\ntially be expensive and `nonrational' [3, 9] because the indus-\ntry could promote some drugs with lower therapeutic\nadvantage when compared with more cost-effective alterna-\ntives. Moreover, in the USA, health insurers are the major\npayers of health services and medical products. Health\ninsurers' interests and guidelines complicate the physician\u00adin-\ndustry relationship.\nThis is the first paper that to our knowledge examined\npatients' treatment compliance and affordability under the\nphysician\u00adindustry relationship. The health benefits of treat-\nment compliance have been well documented [10, 11].\nPatients' characteristics [12], health-care access and health in-\nsurance coverage could all affect patients' treatment compli-\nance and affordability [13, 14]. However, no study has\nexamined treatment compliance under the context of phys-\nician\u00adindustry relationships. It is critical that different agents\nin the health-care marketplace, such as doctors, industry and\nhealth insurers, work together more efficiently and better\ncoordinated to provide quality and continued care to\npatients.\nIn this study, we first set up a conceptual framework to\nanalyze different scenarios where physician\u00adindustry relation-\nship could impact treatment compliance and affordability,\nconsidering the role of health insurers. Then, we employed a\nnationally representative data set of physicians to empirically\ninvestigate this relationship. It is worth noting that although\nwe studied the health-care market in the USA, our results\nmay provide references and policy implications of the phys-\nician\u00adindustry relationships to other countries too. Physician\u00ad\nindustry relationship is common in the UK, Australia and\nother countries [15\u00ad19]. Although most of these countries\nhave guidelines prohibiting companies from giving physician\nincentives to prescribe their products in the form of gifts or\npayments [15], these guidelines were either developed recent-\nly or are still being developed. Researchers from different\ncountries [18] have consistently called for more transparency\nof physician\u00adindustry communications.\nConceptual framework\nFig. 1 delineates the relationships among health-care provi-\nders, patients, health insurers and industry in the USA. In\nthis simplified health-care market, doctors choose medical\nsupplies, such as drugs and medical devices, on behalf of\npatients. On the other hand, health insurers are the main\npayers of these products. Under most circumstances, insurers\nprovide formularies for doctors to select medications and\nsometimes require pre-approval for certain medical services.\nThe industry negotiates with health insurers the inclusion of\ntheir products in insurers' formularies, as well as prices.\nHealth insurers also set copayment (or coinsurance) and\nguidelines for these products to be used, which can influence\nprovider and patient decisions.\nThe interactions of industry, doctors and health insurers\nare complex and multidimensional. A typology of three pos-\nsible scenarios is the following.\nCoordinated case\nIndustry balances the promotion effort between doctors and\ninsurers. Doctors are well informed and have full knowledge\nof the products advantages as well as their side effects.\nHealth insurers put these products on their formulary and\ncharge reasonable copayments after fair negotiations with the\nindustry. In this case, doctors would appropriately prescribe\nmedical products to patients, and patients would pay reason-\nable copayment and use these products regularly. Under this\ncoordinated scenario, three agents work coordinately to\nensure patients receive the best quality care possible.\nPhysician-dominant case\nIndustry put more emphasis on doctors' detailing and pro-\nmotion. Doctors have strong incentives to prescribe the pro-\nducts; however, health insurers, as the main payer, refuse to\npay or shift the financial burden to patients by charging high\ncopayment or coinsurance. In this case, patients may hesitate\nto purchase the product or have problems to continually use\nthe product given cost concerns. Physicians, thus, may report\nmore problems related to health-care delivery due to insur-\nance rejections or patients' non-compliance.\nInsurer-dominant case\nInsurance companies are the main decision makers who rank\ndifferent drugs and medical devices in favorable lists and set\ncopayments after negotiations with industry. Physicians, as\nthe main decision makers on product selection, do not have\nthe incentives to prescribe the newly added medical product.\nFigure 1 Relationships among doctors, industry, health\ninsurers and patients in the USA. (i) The interactions of\nindustry, doctors and health insurers are complex and\nmultidimensional. Fig. 1 provides a simplified framework of\nthese three agents. (Sponsor refers to patient's employer, the\ngovernment or other third party payers who will share the\ndrug cost. Industry refers to the health- care industry, such\nas pharmaceutical companies, or sometimes pharmaceutical\nbenefit managers who negotiate the drug prices with health\ninsurers on behalf of the industry.) (2) Our model is mainly\nfocused on the interaction of industry, doctors and health\ninsurers. It is also possible that industry can reach patients\ndirectly by promotions or advertising, so that patients will\nrequire certain medical products from the doctors. The\nindustry promotion strategies may vary by drug quality as\nwell. Insurance companies may also have different strategies\nof cost sharing to motivate patients to use the products.\nHowever, these are out of reach of this study.\nTreatment compliance under physician\u00adindustry relationship \u00b7 Policy\nIn this case, it is possible that industry-promoted product\nhas low chance to reach patients. By definition, this scenario\nimplies zero or a weak physician\u00adindustry relationship.\nThese scenarios imply three different associations between\nindustry interactions and the health-care quality. In the\n`Coordinated cases', the physician\u00adindustry relationship is\npositively associated with patients' treatment compliance, if\nother factors are controlled. On the other hand, in the\n`Physician-dominant case', the physician industry relation-\nship is negatively associated with patients' treatment compli-\nance, if other factors are controlled. In the `Insurer-dominant\ncase', we may observe weak physician\u00adindustry relationship, i.\ne. its insignificant association with treatment compliance.\nThus, the association of physician\u00adindustry relationship and\ntreatment compliance is an empirical issue. Using a nationally\nrepresentative physician sample, we empirically tested this re-\nlationship in the US health-care market.\nMethod\nData and variables\nThis study used the 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey,\ncross-sectional nationally representative sample of physicians\nin the USA [20]. Physicians were selected from the American\nMedical Association and consisted of `active, non-federal,\noffice- and hospital-based' physicians who provided direct\npatient care at least 20 h per week. The response rate was\n62%. The survey was administered by mail, and the partici-\npating physicians received $50 or $75 honorarium.\nThe survey provided detailed information on physicians'\ndemographic information, practice and patient characteristics.\nThe Health Tracking Physician Survey also provided sam-\npling weights to adjust for the probability of selection and\nsurvey non-responses. More detailed information about this\nsurvey method is available in its Methodology Report [20].\nDependent variable: measures of treatment compliance. The Health\nTracking Physician Survey asked physicians to identify the\nbarriers to provide quality care. The survey question was:\n`Please indicate whether you think it is a major problem, minor\nproblem or not a problem affecting your ability to provide\nquality care to: (i) rejections of care decisions by insurance\ncompanies, (ii) patient non-compliance with treatment and (iii)\npatients' inability to pay for needed care.' The possible answers\nto each of these questions were one if the response was `no\nproblem', two if it was a `minor problem' and three if it was a\n`major problem.' We constructed dichotomous variables for\neach of these questions that equaled one if physicians\nidentified it as a major problem and zero otherwise.\nKey independent variables: physician\u00adindustry relationship. The\nspecific survey question was `Excluding any food, beverages,\nand drug samples you may have received in your workplace,\nplease estimate the total value of all goods and services you\nreceived in 2006 from drug, device, or other medically-related\ncompanies. Include honoraria or payments from surveys on\nprescribing practices conducted by marketing or research\nfirms for medically-related companies.' Physicians' answers\nwere placed in one of the following categories: 0 = none; 1 =\nOther independent variables. We used Reschovsky's [21]\nconceptual model of physicians' perception of health-care\nquality for our model specification. This health-care quality\nmodel has been adopted in many recent studies [22, 23].\nAccording to this framework, physician demographic\ncharacteristics, patients' components and practice characteristics\ncan all affect physicians' perceived quality care. In our empirical\nmodel, we controlled the following physician characteristics:\ngender, race/ethnicity, specialties, years of practice, board\ncertification status, foreign medical school graduate status,\npractice ownership and physicians' perception of market\ncompetition.\nPatient components included in our study were patients'\nrace/ethnicity ratios and share of patients with chronic dis-\neases. Practice characteristics included practice types, share of\npractice revenues from Medicare, Medicaid, and managed\ncare and practice location. We also included state dummies to\naccount for differences on aggregate market effects on\nhealth-care quality.\nThe sample size of 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey\nmissing information on physician demographic information,\n29 with unknown or missing industry relationship and 85\nwith missing treatment compliance variables, our final\nAnalysis\nWe first presented sample descriptive statistics and summar-\nized the compliance measures by different levels of industry\nincome. We used multivariate logistic regression models to\nexamine the association between the physician\u00adindustry rela-\ntionship and three measures of treatment compliance/afford-\nability individually. All regression models used sampling\nweights to account for the differential selection probability\nand to generate nationally representative results. We used\nStata 10 to perform the statistical analyses.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the summary statistics of our sample.\nApproximately, 50% of physicians reported that rejection of\ncare by insurers was a major problem that affected their\nability to provide quality care. Likewise, 39 and 40% of phy-\nsicians reported that patients' non-compliance with treatment\nand inability to pay were major problems, respectively.\nAs to the physician\u00adindustry relationships, 51% of physicians\nfrom industry excluding free drug samples and food. Most phy-\nsicians were males, Whites, graduated from US medical schools,\nreported a medical specialty, had solo or group practice and\nwere board certified. The average number of years in practice\nwere Latino, 16% were African-American and 5% were Asian\nChen and Vargas-Bustamante\nAmericans. Physicians also had 53% of patients with chronic\nconditions. Most physicians' practices were located in large or\nsmall metropolitan areas and had more than five managed care\ncontracts.\nTable 2 reports the summary statistics of three outcome\nmeasures by different levels of industry income. The percen-\ntages of reporting major problems increased with physicians'\nindustry income. For example, when compared with those\nwith $0 industry income, physicians with more than $1000\nindustry income had 18 and 7% higher likelihoods of report-\ning rejection of care by insurers and patients' non-\ncompliance with treatment as major problems, respectively\nTable 3 presents the results of multivariate logistic regres-\nsions. In the regression of rejections of care by insurer, the\nodds ratios associated with industry income were 1.24 (95%\nsion of patient's inability to pay.\nResults showed that physicians' specialty and practice types\nwere significantly associated with the likelihoods of reporting\nmajor problems. Results also showed that minority physicians\nor physicians with more minority patients were more likely to\nhave major problems with these three outcome measures.\nPhysicians with more patients with chronic diseases, with\nmore managed care contracts or who received higher\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTable 1 Summary statistics of physician characteristics using\nthe 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey (total sample size\nOutcome variables n %\nQuality-index measure\nIndependent variables\nPhysician\u00adindustry relationship\nTotal value received from industry\n(except drug sample and free food)\nyears\nPhysicians' race/ethnicity\nMedical school\nSpecialty\nType of practices\nHealth Maintenance Organization\nIncome from practice of medicine\nProportion of African-American\npatients (%)\n(continued)\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTable 1 Continued\nOutcome variables n %\nProportion of patients with chronic diseases\n(%)\nNumber of contracts from managed care\nUrban/rural\nPerceived competition\nTreatment compliance under physician\u00adindustry relationship \u00b7 Policy\nrevenues from Medicaid, or who reported more competition,\nwere also more likely to report treatment compliance as a\nmajor problem.\nSensitivity analysis\nTo test the robustness of our results, we applied different\nmultivariate models. We first used ordered-probit models,\ntreating assessments of treatment compliance as multi-\ncategory variables. Subsequently, we used ordinary least\nsquare models, treating treatment compliance as continuous\nvariables. All these models produced similar results.\nDiscussion\nOur results shed light on the lack of coordination among in-\ndustry, physicians and health insurers in the USA. If a specif-\nic drug (or medical device) is not on health insurance\nformularies, patients may not be able to afford it or regularly\ntake it. In these cases, physicians may perceive a reduced\nability to provide quality of care that reflects an inherent con-\nflict between insurers who emphasize cost-effectiveness cri-\nteria and the marketing goals from pharmaceutical\ncompanies. Patient's quality care and the perceived ability of\nphysicians to provide it may be compromised under this con-\nflict of interest. According to our conceptual framework, our\nfindings showed that the current health-care market could be\ncloser to the `physician-dominant' case described in our con-\nceptual framework, where physicians perceived barriers to\nprovide high quality care due to the restrictions established\nby insurers.\nIn addition, our results showed some evidences that a\ngreater `relationship' with the industry would somehow influ-\nence physicians' decisions of the prescriptions. The multivari-\nate results indicated that having greater industry involvement\nincreases the likelihood of insurance company denials of\ntreatment. Previous studies also showed that when compared\nwith physicians with no relationship with the industry, physi-\ncians with this relationship would be more likely to request\nthe inclusion of promoted drugs in formularies and more\nlikely to prescribe drugs that were promoted by the industry\n[9]. Thus, if the industry influence induces physicians to\nprescribe less standard treatment, the proposed treatment\nmay face higher likelihood of denial.\nNevertheless, insurer's involvement in the physician\u00adindus-\ntry relationship might reduce physicians' opportunist behav-\nior. If prescribed drugs had a limited therapeutic value or a\nlower cost-effectiveness ratio when compared with existing\ndrugs or generic alternatives, patient's quality care and finan-\ncial security might be compromised. The inclusion of more\nexpensive drugs in these formularies might hinder the ob-\njective of health-care cost reduction. Thus, health insurers\nshould establish more regulations to limit the pervasive effect\nthat industry advertisement among physicians could have on\nthe quality of care delivered to patients. For instance, health\ninsurers may enhance health-care quality by testing the cost-\neffectiveness of drugs included in formularies, more restrict-\nive drug utilization reviews, provide more information to\nconsumers, among other actions.\nOur results also showed that physicians primarily treating\nracial and ethnic minority patients were more likely to report\npatients' low treatment compliance and inability to pay.\nThese findings are consistent with the health disparity litera-\nture that minority patients were more likely to have worse\nhealth-care quality and lower health-care access [24]. In add-\nition, consistent with previous literature [23], our results\nshowed that physicians with more managed care contract or\nthose who face higher market competitions were more likely\nto report rejection care by the insurer and patients' low treat-\nment compliance and inability to pay.\nOur study had some limitations. First, the physician\u00adin-\ndustry relationship was self-reported. Physicians might under-\nreport this relationship that was known as `social desirability\nbias' [25]. Thus, the reported drug income could be consid-\nered as a lower bound for the relationship estimated in our\nmodels. Second, patients' treatment compliance and afford-\nability were physicians' self-perception and might not reflect\nthe real treatment compliance. However, physicians' self-\nassessment of quality care may provide valuable insights into\nthe absence of objective clinical information [16]. In add-\nition, although we included all available covariates from the\nsurvey, our results were still subject to omitted variables that\nmight be associated with treatment compliance. For example,\npatients' cultural background, social economic status and\nother variables could influence their decisions of whether to\n.. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. .\nTable 2 Treatment compliance/affordability measures by industry income\nTotal value received from industry (except drug sample\nand free food)\nn (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)\n*P < 0.05.

Finally, we investigated the associ-\nation between industry interaction and perceived treatment\ncompliance with a cross-sectional design. With such analysis,\nit was difficult to infer a causal relationship between industry\nrelationship and physician perceived quality of care.\nDespite these limitations, our results underscored the need\nfor policy makers to address this problem. More patients\nwere aware of and showed concerns with physician\u00adindustry\ninteraction in the USA [4, 26, 27]. Meanwhile, consumer\ncountries have long demanded details of the financial rela-\ntionships between doctors and industry. Luckily, some\nmedical organizations have realized this problem and imple-\nmented according policy to make the physician\u00adindustry rela-\ntionship more transparent to the public [5, 28, 29] such as\nBoston Medical Center, the University of Michigan Health\nSystem and the Yale University School of Medicine.\nAs an important component of the ongoing health-care\nreform in the USA, the Obama administration has recently\nset new guidelines, such as the Physician Payments Sunshine\nAct, for drug companies to disclose the payments or gifts\nthey make to physicians for research, consulting, etc.\nSimilarly, the National Health and Medical Research Council\nin Australia also calls for developing new guidelines to make\nthe industrial sponsorship transparent and credible [15].\nMany countries have guidelines developed by different\ninstitutions prohibiting companies from giving physician gifts\nor financial incentives [15], although the standard regulation\nof physician\u00adindustry relationship is still lacking. For example,\nin the USA, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of\nAmerica, and The American College of Physicians, have their\nown guidelines. These organizations may have different goals,\nand thus a multiplicity of guidelines may lead to lack of co-\nordination and the adequate definition of an effective frame-\nwork that both the industry and physicians can observe. It is\nimportant that future guidelines should be developed jointly\n[15] with the aim of reducing the likelihood of conflicts of\ninterest between patients and physicians.\nConclusions\nOur study underscored the need for policy makers to\naddress the conflicting goals between the cost-effective cri-\nteria used by public and private insurers to reimburse\npatients and the profitability goals pursued by pharmaceutical\nand other medically related companies. Patients are in the\nmiddle of this conflict, facing barriers to receive and afford\nappropriate health care. It is important to encourage coordin-\nation among doctors, industry and health insurer, to promote\npatient's quality care. It is the role of public institutions to\nensure that these practices do not weaken current efforts to\ncontrol costs while providing quality and consistent care.\nFunding\nNo funding resource is disclosed.\n. .. . . . .. . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . .. . .\n.. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .. . .. .\nTable 3 Continued\nRejection of care by\ninsurers\nPatients non-compliance\nwith treatment\nPatients' inability to pay\nUrban/rural\nLarge metro, 1M+ residents Reference Reference Reference\nPerceived competition\nNot at all Reference Reference Reference\nValues are percentages that reflect nationally representative weighted results.
