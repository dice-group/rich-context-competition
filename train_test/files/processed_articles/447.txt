Their impact is demonstrated by generally\nstrong associations with other psychiatric disorders, role\nimpairment, and suicidality. The unmet treatment needs\nin the adolescent population place these disorders as im-\nportant public health concerns.\nprevalence estimates of\neating disorders from\npopulation-based studies\nof adults are relatively low\n(0.5%-1.0% for anorexia nervosa [AN] and\ntheir severity and dramatic impact have\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated through el-\nevated rates of role impairment,1,2,9 medi-\nchildren and adolescents, previous popu-\nlation-based studies of eating disorders\nhave focused on youths who meet full\nDSM-IV criteria without presenting infor-\nmation on youths with eating problems\nthat fall below current diagnostic thresh-\nolds.

The objectives of this\ninvestigation are the following: (1) to present the life-\ntime and 12-month prevalences of AN, BN, BED, and sub-\nthreshold eating disorders; (2) to examine their sociode-\nmographic and clinical correlates and patterns of\ncomorbidity with other mental disorders; and (3) to de-\nscribe the magnitude of role impairment, suicidal behav-\nior, and service use associated with these disorders.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS-A is a nationally representative face-to-face inter-\nview survey of 10 123 adolescents in the continental United\nStates. The background, measures, design, and clinical valid-\nity of the NCS-A have been described in detail elsewhere.24-26\nBriefly, the NCS-A sample was based on a nationally represen-\ntative household sample (n=879 adolescents) and a school\nsample (n=9244 adolescents), with a combined response rate\nof 82.9%. One parent or parental surrogate of each participat-\ning adolescent was asked to complete a self-administered ques-\ntionnaire that contained questions about the adolescent's men-\ntal health and service use; the self-administered questionnaire\nhad a conditional response rate of 83.3%.\nSociodemographic variables assessed in the NCS-A in-\nclude age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, parental or\nparental surrogate\u00adreported marital status, household in-\ncome, and urbanicity. Parental/surrogate marital status was\ngrouped into married or cohabiting, previously married (in-\ncluding divorced, widowed, or separated), never married, and\nunknown. Household income was used to calculate the pov-\nerty income ratio, defined as the ratio of the income to the pov-\nerty line. The 2000 census definitions were used to code ur-\nbanicity by distinguishing large metropolitan areas from smaller\nmetropolitan areas and rural areas.\nThe DSM-IV disorders were assessed using a modification of\nthe fully structured World Health Organization Composite In-\nternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) administered to the ado-\nlescents by lay interviewers. In addition to the adolescent in-\nterviews, parent report from the self-administered questionnaire\nwas incorporated to assess a selection of behavioral disorders,\nincluding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct dis-\norder, and oppositional defiant disorder; attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder was defined by parent report, while the\nother behavioral disorders were defined by endorsement of either\nthe parent or adolescent. Definitions of all psychiatric disor-\nders adhered to DSM-IV criteria except the definition of oppo-\nsitional defiant disorder, which was modified to enhance clini-\ncal validity based on a clinical reappraisal subsample.27 Although\nservice use has been included as an index of impairment in de-\nriving DSM-IV diagnoses in other articles,28 this criterion was\nremoved from the diagnostic algorithms for the purposes of these\nand other related analyses.29 Additionally, indices of disability\nassessed solely for 12-month disorders were not considered in\ndefining lifetime disorder severity. Both lifetime and 12-\nmonth disorders were examined, as was the age at their onset.\nA more complete description of the diagnostic measures has\nbeen presented by Merikangas et al.24\nThe CIDI was designed to assess diagnostic criteria based\non the DSM-IV criteria for AN, BN, and BED. In accordance\nwith the diagnostic algorithms developed for the parallel adult\nUS survey,2 both AN and BN followed the DSM-IV criteria and\nBED followed the proposed DSM-5 criteria.30 Because the CIDI\ndid not directly assess loss of control associated with binge eat-\ning, items that tapped the cognition of loss of control were used\nto approximate this DSM-IV criterion. Diagnostic hierarchies\nwere applied with AN taking precedence over BN, and BN su-\nperseding BED. More than 1 eating disorder subtype could be\nassigned only if there was clear evidence for a temporal dis-\ntinction between the manifestations of the 2 subtypes.\nSufficient information was also available to define sub-\nthreshold AN (SAN) and subthreshold BED (SBED) among those\nyouths who did not meet criteria for AN, BN, or BED. The defi-\nnition of SAN included the following: (1) lowest body weight\nless than 90% of the adolescent's ideal body weight; (2) in-\ntense fear of weight gain at the time of the lowest weight; and\n(3) no history of another threshold-level eating disorder. The\ndefinition of SBED included the following: (1) binge eating at\nleast twice a week for several months; (2) perceived loss of con-\ntrol; and (3) no history of another threshold-level eating dis-\norder or SAN. Combined, BED, SAN, and SBED capture a po-\ntentially large subset of the EDNOS category, but other symptom\npatterns of EDNOS could not be ascertained (eg, purging dis-\norder, subthreshold BN).\nIMPAIRMENT\nAmong subjects who met criteria for an eating disorder within\nthe past 12 months, impairment was assessed using the Shee-\nhan Disability Scale.31 The Sheehan Disability Scale captures\nthe severity of role impairment in 4 domains: home, school or\nwork, family, and social life. In each of these domains, the Shee-\nhan Disability Scale measures impairment on a scale from 0 to\n10 with anchors provided to the adolescent; non-0 scores in-\ndicate any impairment due to the disorder, while scores at or\nabove 7 indicate severe or very severe impairment. In addition\nto this scale, these respondents were also asked to report the\nnumber of days on which they were \"totally unable to go to\nschool or work or carry out [their] normal activities because\nof problems with [their] eating or weight.\"\nSUICIDALITY\nAdolescents were asked about lifetime suicide ideation, plans,\nand attempts. Because of the sensitivity of these questions, lit-\nerate adolescents were not asked these questions directly in the\nface-to-face interview but rather read the questions and re-\nsponded to them separately. Adolescents who could not read\nwere instead asked these questions orally (n=232). Adoles-\ncents were asked about suicide plans and attempts only if they\nendorsed suicide ideation.\nBoththeparent(orparentalsurrogate)andadolescentwereasked\nwhether the adolescent had ever been treated for emotional or\nbehavioral problems. Reports of service use were classified into\nthe following categories: (1) mental health specialty care: ser-\nvices provided by a psychiatrist in settings such as a mental health\nclinic, drug or alcohol clinic, emergency department, and admis-\nsions to hospitals and other facilities; (2) general medical care:\nservicesprovidedbyageneralhealthcarepractitioner,familyphy-\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

Adolescents who met criteria for AN,\nBN, or BED were also asked whether they had ever talked with a\nmedical doctor or professional specifically about their eating or\nweight problems. With the exception of the eating disorder\u00ad\nspecific question, the analysis of service use in this study is based\non endorsement by either the parent or child; levels of agree-\nment between the parent and adolescent reports on service use\nacross the entire sample were acceptable (=0.54).

The data were weighted to adjust for differ-\nential probabilities of selection of respondents within school\nand household samples, differential nonresponse, and re-\nsidual differences between the sample and the US population\non the cross-classification of sociodemographic variables.26\nThe Taylor series linearization method was implemented to\nadjust for the effects of weighting and clustering on all pre-\nsented estimates and standard errors. Logistic regression\nmodels were used to obtain estimates of odds ratios, adjusting\nfor age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Statistical significance was\nconsistently evaluated using .05-level, 2-sided tests.\nRESULTS\nLifetime prevalence rates of AN, BN, BED, SAN, and SBED\n(Table 1).

Significant ethnic differences emerged for BN,\nwith Hispanic adolescents reporting the highest preva-\nlence; there was a trend toward ethnic minorities report-\ning more BED, while non-Hispanic white adolescents\ntended to report more AN.

In con-\ntrast, BN and BED were significantly associated with nearly\nevery disorder assessed. Both subthreshold presenta-\ntions showed modest amounts of comorbidity across\nclasses of DSM-IV disorders. In particular, BN and BED\nwere strongly associated with mood and anxiety disor-\nders and with multiple disorders, with 27.0% of adoles-\ncents with BN and 37.0% of adolescents with BED en-\ndorsing 3 or more classes of comorbid disorders.\nIMPAIRMENT\nAmong adolescents with 12-month AN, BN, BED, and\n8.7%, and 2.8%, respectively, reported severe impair-\nment (Table 4). Eating disorders were most strongly as-\nsociated with social impairment. Nearly all of those with\nported severe social impairment associated with their eat-\ning disorder. Adolescents with BN and BED also re-\nported that their eating problems most impaired their\nsocial and family relationships. Although impairment in\nthese domains was relatively high, youths with eating dis-\norders rarely reported that their eating problems led to\ncomplete loss of role functioning for an entire day.

Each eating disorder sub-\ntype was associated with significantly elevated levels of\nsuicide ideation, while BN and SAN were further asso-\nciated with suicide plans and BN and BED were associ-\nated with suicide attempts. Of note, adolescents with SAN\nreported levels of suicide ideation comparable to those\nof adolescents with AN and considerably more suicide\nplans and attempts. Suicidality was particularly associ-\nated with BN, as more than half of adolescents with BN\nTable 2.

Adolescents with each of the eating dis-\norder subtypes were significantly more likely to seek any\ntreatment and mental health specialty treatment than ado-\nlescents without these disorders.\nCOMMENT\nTo our knowledge, this investigation provides the first\nreport on the prevalence, correlates, impact, and service\nuse patterns of both threshold and subthreshold eating\ndisorders in a nationally representative sample of US ado-\nlescents. The observed prevalence estimates were gen-\nerally similar to those of previous studies,1-8,22,23 and sa-\nlient differences in sociodemographic and clinical\ncorrelates were observed between eating disorder sub-\ntypes. Subthreshold eating conditions that were fre-\nquent in this population were characterized by many of\nthe same severity markers as cases meeting diagnostic cri-\nteria. While most adolescents with eating disorders re-\nceived some form of treatment, only a minority of af-\nfected individuals received services specifically for eating\nor weight problems. These findings underscore the im-\nportant public health implications for a wide spectrum\nof disordered eating among US youths as well as the ne-\ncessity to improve treatment access for these condi-\ntions.\nPrevalence estimates for eating disorders have been\ndifficult to compare across studies owing to differences\nin research methods as well as cultural and societal dif-\nferences that affect base prevalence. The observed life-\ntime prevalence estimates of 0.3% for AN, 0.9% for BN,\nand 1.6% for BED were only slightly lower than those\nreported for US adults using parallel methods.2 How-\never, the ages at onset of each of these disorders were\nmarkedly younger in the present sample, thereby under-\nscoring the likelihood that retrospective assessments of\nadults may overestimate the age at onset of these condi-\ntions for a variety of possible reasons.32\nThe sex ratio for most eating spectrum disorders in\nthis study was generally smaller than that in prior treat-\nment-seeking samples and considerably smaller than the\n9:1 ratio stated in the DSM-IV. The lack of a female pre-\nponderance of eating disorders could be attributable to\neither the methods of the present study or a true lack of\na sex difference in eating disorders in adolescence. One\nindication that the difference may be genuine is pro-\nvided by the large female to male ratio for SAN. Future\nanalyses will explore possible explanations for sex dif-\nferences in eating symptoms and disorders.\nPrevalence estimates of eating spectrum disorders also\nvaried by race, with Hispanic adolescents having the high-\nest rates of BN. The greater prevalence of BN in Hispanic\nadolescents should be interpreted with caution as immi-\ngration status, country of birth, and length of residence in\ntheUnitedStatesmayallhaveaneffectontheriskofBN.33-35\nNonetheless, this larger prevalence highlights an impor-\ntant discrepancy between treatment-seeking samples and\nthe full US adolescent population.36\nAlthough the frequent crossover of eating disorder sub-\ntypes in longitudinal studies of adults37-39 suggests a lack\nof diagnostic specificity of eating disorder subtypes,40-42\ndifferences in the correlates and clinical profiles be-\nAge, y\nProportion With Disorder\nSubthreshold binge-eating disorder\nAnorexia nervosa\nBulimia nervosa\nBinge-eating disorder\nAge, y\nRelative Proportion With Disorder\nA\nB\nFigure.

There was perva-\nsive lifetime comorbidity among youths with BN, whereas\nAN was associated with only 1 other disorder (ie, oppo-\nsitional defiant disorder). Likewise, suicidality was more\ncommonamongadolescentswithBNcomparedwiththose\nwith AN, corroborating findings from previous commu-\nsevere role impairment was more common among ado-\nlescents with AN relative to those with BN. The reasons\nfor variation in clinical correlates remain to be explored\nbut may include underlying differences in temperament\nand personality characteristics,44,45 genetic, physiologi-\ncal, and personal history variables,46,47 or other mecha-\nnisms that may differentiate AN, BN, and BED in gen-\neral population samples.\nThe discrepancy between the lack of substantial co-\nmorbidity among adolescents in the current study48 and\nthe high rates of comorbidity associated with AN among\nadults1,2 suggests that comorbid disorders may be a con-\nsequence of AN in youths. In fact, some prospective stud-\nies49,50 provide support for comorbid disorders emerg-\ning among youths with primary eating disorders in\nadolescence. Future analyses will compare the temporal\norder and progression of comorbid disorders in adults\nand youths in these parallel studies.\nThe high prevalence estimates of SAN (0.8%) and SBED\n(2.5%) provide evidence for a spectrum of eating disor-\nders among youths in the general population.17-19 Sub-\nthreshold eating conditions were often characterized by\nmany of the same severity markers as threshold cases.\nMost striking was the high endorsement of mental health\nservice use for subthreshold conditions, with more than\nhalf of these adolescents having sought mental health spe-\ncialty treatment. Patterns of comorbidity are also sug-\ngestive of the clinical significance of these subthreshold\nconditions in the population.20,21 Likewise, the signifi-\ncant association between suicide ideation and behavior\nwith subthreshold conditions supports the importance\nof the spectrum concept of eating disorders.\ning disorders reported some contact with the service sec-\ntor for emotional or behavioral problems, with the most\nfrequently used sectors being mental health specialty care,\nschool services, general medical services, and human ser-\nvices. However, only a minority (3.4%-27.5%) of indi-\nviduals with eating disorders had actually talked to a pro-\nfessionalspecificallyabouttheireatingorweightproblems.\nThis could be attributable to denial of eating problems\nby adolescents, shame and/or stigma, or a lack of recog-\nnition of eating symptoms by professionals treating other\ntargeted problems among these youths. The evidence that\nadolescents do indeed use services across sectors sug-\ngests possible avenues for prevention and early interven-\ntion strategies if recognition could be improved (eg, edu-\ncation of parents and youths to minimize stigma and of\nTable 3.

Moreover, the increased risk for cer-\ntain forms of eating disorders among Hispanic and other\nminority adolescents warrants particular attention in edu-\ncation of youths, their families, and mental health care\nToourknowledge,thisisthefirstpopulation-basedstudy\nin the United States to present the prevalence of eating dis-\nordersacrossthefulladolescentagerange.Thelargesample\nsize is unparalleled, and the sampling design and weight-\ning allow for generalizations to the general US adolescent\npopulation.Inclusionofsubthresholdmanifestationsofeat-\ning disorders permitted assessment of a broader range of\neating behaviors and their clinical significance. Further\nstrengths are the use of face-to-face structured interviews\nof the adolescents as well as inclusion of reports from both\nthe parent and adolescent in the assessment of service use\nand behavioral disorders.\nHowever, the cross-sectional design of this study lim-\nits conclusions concerning temporal relationships among\ncomorbid conditions and prevents confirmation of find-\nings from adult samples concerning eating disorder cross-\novers or transitions from subthreshold to full-threshold\nconditions.37-39 In addition, the small number of adoles-\ncents with combinations of eating disorders (eg, only 6\nadolescents met criteria for both AN and BN, and only 2\nadolescents met criteria for both BN and BED) pre-\ncluded our ability to investigate the correlates of com-\nbinations of threshold-level eating disorders.\nAlthough 12-month prevalence is also reported, this\narticle primarily focuses on lifetime prevalence and cor-\nrelates of eating disorders. Such estimates are critical for\na comprehensive life-course understanding of these dis-\norders but may also be subject to unreliability of recall\nof past symptoms or disorders due to memory, bias, de-\nsirability of response, and other factors. Attempts to mini-\nmize such biases were built into the methods of the\nCIDI.28,51 In fact, growing evidence from prospective co-\nhort studies suggests that retrospective recall yields un-\nderestimates as opposed to overestimates of the true preva-\nlence of psychiatric disorders.52,53 Therefore, the estimates\nin this article may be a lower bound of the true preva-\nlence of eating disorders.\nConcerning other limitations, our diagnostic instru-\nment had not been previously validated in adolescents,\nand studies using earlier versions of the CIDI found that\nTable 3.

For example, the interview did not cover mani-\nfestations such as purging without binging, BN or BED\nwith weekly binge eating (a criterion currently pro-\nposed for the DSM-5 for both BN and BED),30,55 or the\nage at onset and impairment of SAN.\nFurthermore, analyses of associations may have been\nunderpowered owing to the relatively small numbers of\nadolescents with eating disorders. In particular, as the\nunweighted number of adolescents with AN in this sample\nis only 34, the lack of findings for sociodemographic mea-\nsures and comorbidity may be due to this methodologic\nissue rather than representing true null findings.

This is unfortunate in light\nof the research questions faced in the revision of the DSM,\nand the designers of future epidemiologic studies should\nconsider the qualitative costs to research of enforcing skip\nlogic along with the monetary costs.\nDespite these limitations, this study provides key in-\nformation concerning the epidemiology of eating disor-\nders in the US adolescent population. The prevalence of\nthese disorders is higher than previously expected in this\nage range, and the patterns of comorbidity, role impair-\nment, and suicidality indicate that eating disorders rep-\nresent a major public health concern. Finally, these find-\nings support the nosological distinction between the major\nsubtypes of eating disorders as well as the importance of\ninclusion of the full spectrum of eating behaviors in es-\ntimating the magnitude and correlates of eating disor-\nders in the US population.\nCorrespondence: Kathleen R.
