We classified dementia inpatients of\na geriatric health services facility into four stages, using the model of self-awareness ability\n(consisting of `theory of mind', `self-evaluation' and `self-consciousness') that was constructed\nby combining `theory of mind' and Lewis's developmental model of cognition and emotion.\nFurthermore, we observed and documented scenes from daily life, and we interpreted the\nreasons why patients become unable to seek assistance from others for ADL, based on the\nmodel. We came to understand why the patients could not seek assistance from others,\nbecause the patients who failed in the task of `theory of mind' were unable to self-assess their\nown mind and the minds of others, and those having failed in the task of `self-evaluation' could not\nevaluate their own situation.\n",

The major causes of abuse are triggered by behavior that\npuzzles caregivers, and an increase in the mental burden of caregivers due to an inability\nto communicate (Yosikawa, 2010). It has become an urgent issue to prevent abuse and to\nimprove the quality of life (QOL) of dementia patients and their families. It can be said that\ncaregivers' understanding of the meaning of apparently puzzling words and deeds of\ndementia patients in daily life is a key to solving the issue.\nDementia is generally defined as a condition in which various cognitive functions, such\nas acquired memory, judgment, orientation, languages, and so on, have become impaired,\ncausing varying degrees of inability to perform normal activities of daily living (ADL).\nWhy do dementia patients turn out to be unable to perform normal ADL, once their\ncognitive functions have become disordered? It seems to be unreasonable to explain such\nconstraint only through impairment of cognitive functions such as memory, judgment, and\norientation. For instance, a patient, even if being able to recall his or her address and\ntelephone number correctly, may lose his or her way in the streets to return home, but this\ncannot be explained only by impaired memory or orientation (Ozawa, 2002). This may be\ndue to the impaired ability of the function of judgment. In the case of dementia, the\nimpaired ability of judgment is said to be the inability to take an appropriate action\nsuitable to an actual situation (Takeda, 2005), but the reasons for such failure have not\nbeen explained. In order for a dementia patient to become unable to get back home\nbecause he or she has got lost in the streets, it is necessary for him or her to have the\nself-awareness ability to recognize that they are indeed lost, the self-awareness ability to\nrecognize the self-`intention' of wishing to return home and the self-awareness ability to\nrecognize the self-`desire' to have someone contact their home for them. After all,\ndementia is not a mixture of impaired intellectual tools, such as impaired memory or\norientation, but indicates a condition in which the intellectual core to coordinate these\nintellectual tools has been impaired (Ozawa, 2002), which will defy understanding of the\nwhole picture of dementia, even if the intellectual functions are scrutinized piece by piece\nAccordingly, to understand the words and deeds of dementia patients that we find very\nhard to explain or understand, we have paid attention to the self-awareness ability of\ndementia patients, the intellectual subject that integrates their own intellectual functions,\nand created `a model for interpreting puzzling words and deeds of dementia patients from\nthe viewpoint of self-awareness' (Yokoi & Okamura, 2008).\nRegarding the self-awareness ability (including ego, self-recognition, self-consciousness)\nof dementia patients, there are several published studies that explored anosognosia (Antoine,\nAntoine, Guermonprez, & Frigard, 2004; Banks & Weintraub, 2008; Barrett, Eslinger,\nBallentine, & Heilman, 2005; Eslinger et al., 2005), the deficit of self-awareness\naccompanying frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease\n(Derouesne et al., 1999; Snowden, Craufurd, Griffiths, & Neary, 1998; Sturm, Rosen,\nAllison, Miller, & Levenson, 2006), the relation between the deficit of self-awareness and\nperformance of ADL or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (Cotrell & Wild, 1999;\nCramer, Tuokko, Mateer, & Hultsch, 2004; Giovannetti, Libon, & Hart, 2002), the relation\nbetween cognitive function, such as memory, and the deficit of self-awareness (Gil et al.\nare currently available that have practically approached the analysis and the reasons of\ndecline of living function from the point of self-awareness.\nThe purpose of this study is to explain the reasons why dementia patients become unable\nto successfully perform ADL with advancement of dementia, using our model to present\nviewpoints understandable to caregivers.\nThis model for interpreting puzzling words and deeds of dementia patients from the\nviewpoint of self-awareness consists of `a developmental model of cognition and emotion'\naccording to developmental psychologist Michael Lewis (Lewis, 1993; Lewis, Sullivan,\nStanger, & Weiss, 1989) and the `theory of mind' developed by psychologists Wimmer\nand Perner (1983) (Figure 1). According to Lewis, a human is born with emotions of\n`contentment', `curiosity\u00c1 interest', and `distress' and a baby in relation to others\ndevelops and differentiates emotions such as `joy', `surprise', `anger', and the like. At\naround the age of 18 months, the baby begins to pay attention to the self, and the\n`self-consciousness', differentiating the self from others, begins to sprout, developing the\nemotions of `Embarrassment' and `Empathy'. And then from the age of two and a half to\nthree, the infant starts to understand the rules and standards of the society in which the\ninfant lives, while, by comparing him- or herself with these criteria, he or she obtains the\nfunction of `self- evaluation' to judge whether the self-thinking, emotions, and actions are\ngood or bad, thus developing the emotions of `Shame' and `Guilt'. In addition, although it\nis usually assumed that the function of mind is as the background of other's behavior\n(Koyasu, 2000), Wimmer and Perner (1983) revealed that children can acquire the `theory\nof mind', which is the ability to estimate psychological states (intention, thought, belief,\ndesire, emotion, preference, etc.) that are in the background of the behavior of self and\nothers and cannot be directly observed (Tager-Flusberg, Baron-Cohen, & Cohen, 1993), at\nbetween four and six years of age.\nSelf-awareness constitutes the basis of sociality (Kajita, 1989). In other words, it is\nsuggested that the development of self-awareness forms the basis upon which infants\nadapt to the human relations, becoming conscious of their own existence at the\nawakening of `self-consciousness' and distinguishing themselves from others, and further\npreparing for adapting to the social rules and standards in which they live, by making\ntheir `self-evaluation', and becoming able to adapt to human relations with an unspecified\nlarge number of people, by presuming the other minds to be based on the `theory of mind'.\nThus, the author has regarded the `self-consciousness', the `self-evaluation', and the `theory\nof mind' in the present model as developmental stages of self-awareness for adapting to\nhuman relations.\nThe `model for interpreting puzzling words and deeds of dementia patients from the\nviewpoint of self-awareness' (Figure 2) views the above developmental model conversely.\nThe loss of the function of `theory of mind' (Tager-Flusberg et al., 1993), that is, the gradual\ninability to presume the psychological state (intention, thinking, belief, desire, emotion,\npreference, etc.) without the capability of direct observation (although it may be\nconcealed in the background of the behavior of the self and others), will make it\nimpossible to understand intention, thinking, belief, desire, and so on, of the self and\nothers. The loss of the function of `self-evaluation' will deprive the overall emotional\ngambit of `Shame' and `Guilt', making it impossible to evaluate the self-situation and to\nreduce resistance in taking actions that may be contrary to the social rules or standards. The\nfunctional loss of `self-consciousness', that is, the psychological differentiation of the self\nfrom others, may lead to lose the emotion of `Embarrassment', `Empathy', etc., and as a\nresult the behavior may be subject to only such primary emotions as `Contentment',\n`Interest', `Sadness', or `Anger'.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThe subjects were chosen from 44 patients who had been admitted to the designated ward for\ndementia in a geriatric health services facility, being diagnosed as having dementia by the\ndiagnosis criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-\nContentment Interest Distress\nJoy Surprise Sadness, disgust\nAnger, fear\nSelf-consciousness, as in\nself-referential behavior\nEmbarrassment\nEnvy\nEmpathy\nSelf-evaluation: Acquisition and\nretention of standards and rules\n( as a weak shame) Embarrassment\nPride\nShame\nGuilt\nTheory of mind: Ability to\npresume a state of mind of\nothers\nFirst 6 months\nSecond half\nof second year\nTIME\nFigure 1. Interrelated development of cognition and emotion, and theory of mind (compiled from Lewis's\ndevelopmental model of cognition and emotion (Lewis, 1993; Lewis, Sullivan, Stanger, & Weiss, 1989), and\nWimmer's and Perner's theory of mind (Wimmer and Perner, 1983)).\nyears, Alzheimer disease: 22, Vascular dementia: 21, Pick's disease: 1). Twenty-four patients\n(male 4, female 20) were finally selected whose families had been informed about the study\npurpose, and had consented to the study in writing. The average age was 83.4 \u00c6 7.8,\nconsisting of 11 patients with Alzheimer disease-related dementia, 12 with vascular\ndementia, and 1 with Pick's disease. Taking into consideration the adaptation to a new\nenvironment, we excluded one patient who had stayed in the facility for less than 1\nmonth and another two patients who were suspected of having mental illness as a\ncomplication other than dementia.\nEvaluation of self-awareness ability\nFor evaluation of the self-awareness ability of `theory of mind', `self-evaluation', and `self-\nconsciousness', the author and the occupational therapist usually in charge of the subjects'\noccupational therapy sessions made the evaluation with the subjects in a peaceful\nenvironment, taking into consideration the duration of attentiveness and the degree of\nany hearing disorder found in the subjects.\nEvaluation methods of self-awareness ability in this model (Figure 2) are explained below.\nPresence or absence of `theory of mind'. The author sat face to face to the subject across a table,\nshowing much simplified adaptations of four picture cards that were originally in the version\nof Wimmer's and Perner's `Wrong Belief' (1983) depicted by Muto (1995), and confirmed the\nTheory of mind\nWhen the function of `theory of mind', which is the ability to presume\npsychological states (intention, thought, belief, desire, emotion, etc.) that\nare in the background of the behavior of the self and others and cannot be\ndirectly observed, is lost, one becomes unable to understand the intentions\nand thoughts of the self and others.\nSelf-evaluation\nWhen the function of `self-evaluation' is lost, one becomes unable to\nevaluate conditions of the self. Furthermore, emotions of `guilt', `shame'\nand `pride' are lost, and one becomes able to act against society's rules and\nstandards without hesitation.\nSelf-consciousness\nWhen the function of `self-consciousness' is lost and the psychological\ndistinction between the self and others is gone, the emotion of `empathy',\nwhich is the basis of human relations, is lost and one becomes able to act\nonly by primary emotions (`fear', `anger', `disgust', `sadness', `surprise',\n`joy', `distress', `interest' and `contentment').\nFigure 2. A model for interpreting puzzling words and deeds of dementia patients from the viewpoint of\nself-awareness.\npresence or absence of the `theory of mind' by pointing to the cards for each scene, while\nslowly reading out the description seen in Figure 3.\nPresence and absence of `self-evaluation'. Lewis did not prepare a task to determine the presence\nor absence of `self-evaluation'. Consequently, the author devised and implemented four pairs\nof picture cards (Figure 4) to evaluate understanding of the fundamental rules and standards\nin Japanese society. First the author sat face to face with the test subject across a table, and\nconfirmed that his or her attention was properly paid to the picture cards. Then, showing the\ncards pair by pair, the author read aloud slowly the narratives in the sequence given in\nFigure 4. In place of the `XXX' seen in the captions, the subject's name was used, and if the\nsubject was a female, the author used the female version of the captions by changing\nthe male characters into female ones. When the correct replies were given for all four\ntasks, the subject was regarded as being able to make a `self-evaluation'.\nFigure 3. Four picture cards used to evaluate the presence and absence of the theory of mind. Scene 1.\n`There is a round box and a square box in front of Taro and Hanako. A bean-jam bun is contained in the\nround box.' Scene 2. `Taro is leaving the room.' Scene 3. `In the meantime, Hanako has transferred the\nbean-jam bun from the round box to the square box.' Scene 4. `Taro has come back. In which box, the\nround box or the square box, does Taro think the bean-jam bun is?'.\nFigure 4. Four pairs of the picture cards used to evaluate the presence or absence of\nself- evaluation. Task 1. `Mr. XXX is washing his hands after use of the toilet.' `Mr. XXX does not wash his\nhands after use of the toilet. Which is better?' Task 2. `Mr. XXX is quarrelling with his friend.' `Mr. XXX is\ngetting on well with his friend. Which is better?' Task 3. `Mr. XXX is wearing his clothes in public.' `Mr.\nXXX has not put his clothes on, and is naked before everybody. Which is better?' Task 4. `Mr. XXX is\neating while standing.' `Mr. XXX is eating while sitting. Which is better?'.\nAccording to Lewis, the `self-evaluation' ability develops from two and a half to three\nyears old. In order to confirm if the above task was appropriate for the cognition ability in\nthis age span, a child care worker in charge at a child care facility conducted a study in which\nthe characters on the cards were changed into children. Twenty-eight children participated\nwith the consent of their parents, with ages from 1 year 7 months to 3 years 11 months. The\nresults confirmed that the age of 2 years 11 months in most of the children was appropriate\nfor the development of `self-evaluation'.\nPresence or absence of `self-consciousness'. Lewis et al. (1989) applied red lipstick on the tip of\nthe nose of an infant without being noticed, and judged the presence or absence of his or\nher self-consciousness when the child touched the tip of his or her own nose when they saw\ntheir face in a mirror. However, a severe dementia patient does not have high interest as\nseen in the infant, nor is it possible to apply the lipstick technique due to impaired\nattentiveness.\nShoji (1989) reviewed all the preceding studies and suggested that the age at which an\ninfant should be able to hearing their own name was from 18 months. As the age at which\nthe above-mentioned lipstick task to evaluate the presence or absence of `self-consciousness'\nused by Lewis was also from 18 months, the task of responding to one's name is therefore\nconsidered to be an additional appropriate method for evaluation of `self-consciousness'.\nThus, in accordance with the advice made by specialists studying `self-consciousness', we\nadapted the previously reported method (Kajita, 1989) as follows. With the patient facing in\nany direction, either the patient's name, both given and family names was spoken from\nbehind the patient, or the name of another patient and a meaningless `ah. . .' sound. The\npatient's response, either turning round at the sound of their own name or not, was taken as\nconstituting the core of recognition of the self or another stimulus, as well as a symbol\nrepresenting the identity of each person.\nEvaluation of ability to seek help from others\nThe author made a participation observation and documentation of the scenes where the\nsubjects were asking for help from others, and where they did not seek help in those\nscenarios requiring help, by paying attention to the following.\n(1) Are the subjects who are embarrassed able to grasp their self-situations?\n(2) From whom do they seek help?\n(3) Where do they seek help?\n(4) At which point in time (when) do they seek help?\n(5) What kind of help do they seek?\n(6) How do they seek help?\n3 months, and each time the author wrote down in his pocket notebook the actual speeches\nand actions in the scenes in as much detail as possible. In addition, the author checked the\nrecords written by the respective subject's caregivers and care nurses so as to extract such\nscenes as relating to the subject's ability to seek help from others, the degree of reliability of\nthese data being confirmed by the author from those who had recorded them.\nSeverity evaluation on general cognition function\nThe author and a caregiver made the evaluation with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)\nAnalytical method\nThe author and the occupational therapist together classified the study subjects into four\nstages (the task of `theory of mind' passed or failed; the task of `self-evaluation' passed or\nfailed; and the task of `self-consciousness' passed or failed, which were divided by the\npresence and absence of `theory of mind', `self-evaluation', and `self-consciousness').\nThen, for the scenario of the subject seeking help from others and that of a subject not\nseeking any required help from others, we interpreted why the subjects were unable to grasp\ntheir self-situations in embarrassment and why they were unable to seek help from others, by\neach of the four stages, based on the model of Figure 2.\nEthical consideration\nFor the present study we submitted the study protocol to the director of the study facility,\nand obtained the approval of the ethics review committee of the facility. As the study\nsubjects manifested dementia, we informed their families in writing of the strict protection\nof the subjects' privacy, and enrolled in the study only those subjects from whose families we\nreceived written consent to participate.\nResults and discussion\nTo make it easy to understand the context of each stage, first we put together the\ncharacteristics that were seen through the cases in the scenes relating to the ability to seek\nhelp from others at each stage.\nThen we showed the representative cases at each stage in the scenes relating to the ability\nto seek help from others. In our case reports, we have used the symbol < > for those\nscenarios where the subject sought help from others, and the symbol << >> for the\nscenario where help was not sought, although help was required.\nOn these scenes, based on the model of Figure 2, we interpreted on a stage-by-stage basis\nthe reason why the subjects had become unable to grasp their self-situation that had caused\nthem embarrassment, and why they had become unable to ask for help from others.\nSix subjects who passed the task of `theory of mind'\nCharacteristic. In a normal life at the facility, we observed the scenes where the subjects\ngrasped their self-situations and sought specific help from the staff. However, they did not\nprecisely understand the minds of others, and were disturbed at the words or the presence of\nothers, often making it impossible to seek help from others.\n[Case 1] A female in her 90s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Mild\n(< >) One night, when an inmate with a severe degree of orientation disturbance came to her\nroom, she exclaimed, `Help! Somebody!' A staff member came quickly to the subject but the\npatient got angry, `What is wrong with this place? Why do you allow such a patient to hang\naround? This makes me feel much worse, although I have been already admitted in this hospital.'\nThe next day she barricaded the entrance door to her room with chairs. I asked, `What\nhappened?', and she explained, `At night someone had got into my room, hanging around.\nSomeone is coming into this room, because there is a toilet in my room.'\n[Case 2] A female in her 70s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Mild\nThe female inmate who often spoke meaninglessly, was sitting at the same table said, `I\nhave toothache', laying her face down on the table, and the subject sitting beside her\nexplained to me, saying `When she visits a doctor, she has to pay the bill. She is\nworrying about it', considering and assuming the other's mind. On the other hand, (<\n>) the subject once put her handbag on the table, asking the unreliable inmate, `Will\nyou watch over this?', and returned to her room. Also, (<< >>) in the previous year\nthe subject joined the Bon festival (a popular Japanese summer festival) dance of her own\nwill, but this year, looking at so many strangers as inmate family members, she would not\nask the staff member to let her join the dance, keeping the caregiver's hand firmly held\nuntil the end of the dance.\n[Case 3] A male in his 80s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Moderate\nThe staff opened a coffee house twice weekly in a log hut adjacent to the facility. (<>) The\nsubject forced me by hand to enter the coffee house again today. I explained that the coffee-\nhouse was not open today, but he was not persuaded, sitting down in front of the floor elevator\nof his ward, not trying to move.\nAlso the subject was convinced that the inmate sitting on his right, who had said something the\nmeaning of which was unclear, must have been begging for something, and shouted to the staff\nmember who was sitting to his left, writing notes on the situation, `Don't you feel sorry for her?'\nAlso one day, when I noticed that his front tooth was broken, I asked, `What happened?', and\nthe subject cooked up a story, saying, `My daughter took me for a ride in her car but she\nsuddenly and unexpectedly braked very hard. That's why my tooth is broken.'\n[Case 4] A female in her 80s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\n(< >) When I was sitting slightly away from the subject, she called me to come to her, saying\n`Young man!', and asked me to go and fetch a jacket, with a gesture that `it must be long enough'\n(up to the wrist), as she claimed that the sleeves of a rather long undershirt are sticking out from\nthe short-sleeved jacket.\nAlso (< >) She said, `I cannot understand' regarding the conversation from inmate, the meaning\nof which was unclear and she turned to me. `Listen carefully to his request' she said, as I sat next\nto her. But (< >) she was once asked by a male inmate sitting at the same table to take care of\nthe stuffed toy bear, Winnie-the-Pooh on the table. The subject became greatly upset and\naddressed a female inmate, whose understanding of spoken words was extremely poor,\n`Ma'am! What shall I do? I don't know to whom this belongs. You are responsible for this!\nTake it away. . .'. She said this imploringly showing embarrassment.\n[Case 5] A female in her 80s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Moderate\n(<< >>) On one occasion, an inmate who had no understanding of the spoken word was\npounding on a table, quite near another female inmate. The female inmate shouted at the\npounding inmate, `Why are you pounding? It's noisy!', without asking the staff member to\ncaution the inmate. The staff member admonishingly explained about the situation to the\nfemale inmate who understood the problem, saying, `I did not know that'.\n[Case 6] A male in his 70s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\nThis inmate was confined to a wheelchair, suffering from hemiplegia and a vision disorder. He\nwas unable to stand up or maneuver his wheelchair. (< >) When his back was itchy, he called on\nstaff members, asking them to scratch his back. On another occasion, when some other inmate\ntried to take his afternoon snack consisting of a bean jam-filled bun, he similarly called on the\nstaff to stop this happening.\nDiscussion. For the subjects in this stage, when they asked for assistance from others, they\nfirst presumed the mind of the staff as shown in the phrase `I know well that I should not do\nthis, but I cannot sleep' (Case 1), and attracted the staff's attention with such words as\n`Excuse me, excuse me', `Young man', and `Young lady' (Cases 4\u00ad6). Afterwards the\nsubjects asked for specific assistance, such as bringing them the cigarettes or their jacket,\nhelp with going to the toilet, back-scratching, and so on. In order to ask assistance from\nothers, they have to be capable of making an accurate self-appraisal of their own situation,\nidentifying such difficulties as going to sleep, going alone to fetch a jacket, going to the toilet,\nor requiring their back to be scratched, and it is essential to have an ability to assume\nknowledge of the other's mind, such as the other's intention, thought, or belief.\nIn normal daily life at the facility, even for the subjects that passed the task of `theory of\nmind', enabling them to request assistance from others, it is impossible to assume precisely\nthe mind of the others, as shown in the scenes in coping with the mind of the inmate with a\nsevere orientation disorder (Case 1), the mind of other inmate family members at the Bon\nfestival dance (Case 2), the mind of the inmate always saying something incomprehensible\n(Case 3), the mind of the male inmate asking for someone to look after his Winnie-the-Pooh\n(Case 4), the mind of the inmate pounding on the table with his fingers (Case 5), and so on.\nThis is also well demonstrated in the use of a fiction or excuse that will easily reveal a lie to a\nlistener (Case 3). Self-empathy is involved in assuming the mind-set of other people (Itakura,\n2006). In the case of the inability to precisely understand the mind of others, it is safe to say\nthat self-understanding of the subject's own mind is at best faulty. The inability of a subject\nto precisely understand for themselves what is in/on their own mind indicates the inability to\nprecisely assess self-intention and belief. With the inability of assessing self-intention or\nbelief, it is impossible to have conviction regarding self-existence. This in turn makes the\nbasis of the subject's self-existence incessantly unstable, with the result that such an unstable\nself becomes susceptible to being easily disturbed by the words or presence of another. As a\nresult of this, the entry of other inmates into a subject's room disturbed her mind sufficiently\nto make her build up a barricade at the door; or the subject who was so as frightened by the\nminds of other inmate family members being strangers to her, that she was discouraged from\nparticipating in the Bon festival dance; or in the case of the subject who became disturbed at\nthe mind of the inmate speaking nonsense, shouted at the staff member, or the subject who\ngot embarrassed and confused at the inmate requesting disposal of the Winnie-the-Pooh, or\nthe other subject who expressed her anger at the mind of the inmate pounding on the table.\nIn short, due to the insufficient ability of a subject to assess their own mind-set, far less the\nmind-set of others, the subject's mind at this stage becomes easily disturbed so that it\nbecomes impossible for them to precisely evaluate the self-situation. Under this set of\ncircumstances, the affected subject may thus become unable to seek suitable assistance\nfrom others.\nNine subjects who did not pass the task of `theory of mind', but passed the task of\n`self-evaluation'\nCharacteristic. Scenarios were observed during which the subjects were capable of informing\nthe staff of their self-situations, but scenarios in which the subjects sought specific assistance\nfrom the staff were scarcely seen, except when they felt threatened or in danger, or when their\nappetite was stimulated.\n[Case 7] A female in her 90s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\n(<< >>) This subject's walking was unstable, but she often rose up from her seat and started to\nwalk. I asked her, `What happened?', and she replied, `I want to go to the washroom', but she did\nnot voluntarily ask to be taken there. Also (<< >>) she was found lying on her bedroom floor\nin the morning. She said that during the night she had fallen out of bed, `I tried to stand up, but\nfell down', she said. She then said that she was sorry that she could not stand up, but she had not\nasked anybody to seek help to lift her up.\n[Case 8] A female in her 90s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\nDuring daytime this subject sat in a chair, often looking downward and drowsing. (<< >>)\nWhen she was subsequently made to visit the toilet, she looked into her diaper, found a stool,\nand was surprised at it, saying `Good Heavens!' and in a sorrowful voice, repeated `Oh! My\nGoodness'. On the other hand, (< >) one early morning when she fell out of bed, she asked the\nstaff to help her, saying, `Please help me'.\n[Case 9] A female in her 90s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\n(<< >>) When I went to see her once, she complained, `I feel giddy'. I laid her on a sofa, and\nshe repeatedly complained, `I feel tightness and pressure in my chest'. I asked her, `Where?', and\nshe said, `Here', placing her hand on her abdomen. When I said, `That's your abdomen. I\nwonder if you are hungry'. Then she complained of her hunger, `I did not take breakfast or\nlunch. Please do something about it'. Usually she never sought any specific request asking for\nsomething to eat. On the other hand, (< >) when a country-style bean-jam bun was given to her\nduring afternoon tea, she asked the staff member who was sitting beside her and supervising,\n`One more cup of tea, please', holding the cup.\n[Case 10] A female in her 90s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Moderate\n(<< >>) This subject's walking was unstable, and she often fell down. She occasionally stood\nup from a chair and started to walk holding onto a table. I asked, `What's the matter?', and she\nreplied, `I'm going to the washroom: give me a car (she means her wheelchair)', but she did not\nvoluntarily call for the staff member to take her to the washroom.\n[Case 11] A female in her 80s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Moderate\n(<< >>) The subject usually asked, `May I take this?' when a meal was given to her, but did not\nask for a rice bowl as a second helping. Even when her tea cup became empty, she did not ask for\na refill saying `Please pour me some more tea', unless someone else asked her, `Shall I pour the\ntea?' However, (< >) one day at lunch when rice boiled with chestnuts was served, I sat beside\nher and observed that, after having eaten the first helping, she said, `Rice!', holding the rice bowl\nup in her hand.\n[Case 12] A female in her 80s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Severe\n(<< >>) The subject was wandering slowly along, holding on the handrail and went into the\nguardroom, asking, `May I come in?' After wandering around for some time, she approached a\nstaff member who was talking with another inmate, and said, `I have a headache. I had better go\nto bed'. The staff member gave her black-sugar candy. While the subject was sucking it in her\nmouth, she remained sitting on a chair, saying, `I had better go back and sleep'.\n[Case 13] A female in her 80s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Severe\nAfter fracturing her cervical femur, the subject underwent conservative treatment with\nobservation, but felt pains persisting in her lower extremity. When the two staff members\ntried to assist her by lifting her onto the toilet seat, she refused, even before the transfer,\nsaying, `No more help. Not for me'. But after she was transferred to the seat, she said, `What\na pity!' To the question, `Who?', she expressionlessly replied, `It's this wee-wee'.\n[Case 14] A female in her 80s, Vascular dementia, CDR: Severe\nThis subject often went out from her room at night to the front of the lighted guardroom. (< >)\nOn this particular day, she came out from her room as usual, trying to sit on the sofa in front of\nthe guardroom, and asked the staff, `Can't I? Can't I?' The staff replied, `No!', and she seemed to\ngive up sitting. The staff led her to a toilet, to change her incontinence-soiled clothes, and then\ntook her into her room. She asked, `Do you take me here?' The staff said, `Now go to bed', and\n`Young lady, too'. Getting into the bed, she asked, `Is this O.K.?'\n[Case 15] A female in her 70s, Dementia with Pick disease, CDR: Severe\nIn a severe depressive condition, this subject hardly moved her body while sitting in a chair, and\nit was really seldom to observe the scenario where the subject talked to others. (< >) One night,\na big cry, `Help! Somebody come quickly!' was heard from her room. The staff hastened to the\nroom, and found a roommate standing beside her bed, whereupon she exclaimed, `Please do\nsomething!'\nDiscussion. As the subjects at this stage are able to evaluate their self-situations, if not\ncompletely, they may be sometimes able to communicate their self-situations to others. In\nCase 7 the subject sat on the floor, but was unable to ask others to help her to her feet, and\nexplained the situation by saying, `I tried to stand up, but fell down', and, `I can't stand up'.\nIn Case 9, despite hunger, the subject was unable to ask for food, explaining her situation by\nsaying, `I feel dizzy, have tightness in my chest, did not take breakfast or lunch'. In Case 10,\ndespite the risk of fall, the subject did not ask for someone to help her get to the toilet, but\nstood up to start walking. When asked by the staff, `What's the matter?', she explained the\nsituation, saying, `I'm going to the toilet'. In Case 13, despite pain, having been transferred\nto the toilet seat, the subject exclaimed, `What a pity!'. However, at this stage it is almost\nimpossible for these subjects to ask for specific assistance. This may be attributed to the\nreasons that they are unable to assess what the minds of others are thinking, simultaneously\nwith their own minds through which the self-intention and desire, namely `what the self\nwants to do and to be done' become vague. In Case 12, the subject came into the guardroom\nwith a vague idea of her `desire to do and to be done', asking, `May I come in?'. In Case 14,\nher intention and desire became much weaker, and when she was led into her room, she\nasked, `Is this the way?', `Is it O.K.?'.\nHowever, in a dangerous situation or when one's own life might be threatened (Cases 8,\n15) or when the appetite is stimulated, the self-desire may become clearer, and the help of\nothers is requested. When a life-threatening fear or physiological desire is strongly aroused,\nthe learned and experienced intellect may appear.\nSix subjects who did not pass the task of `self-evaluation', but passed the task of `self-\nconsciousness'\nCharacteristics. Among the six subjects, except for the two cases mentioned below, scenarios\nwere not observed where the subjects sought the assistance of others. Even in the two\nexceptions, verbal expression became scarce, and scenarios where the staff's assistance was\nasked for were rarely seen. Only in empathy behavior were scenarios observed where the help\nof others was requested.\n[Case 16] A female in her 70s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Severe\n(<< >>) This subject was frightened by a nearby inmate talking loudly but not directed at her:\nshe was standing, looking down. Usually she seldom actively talked to others, at best making\nappropriate responses to other's talk, saying, `Ah! Is that so?', but this time when I talked to her,\nshe started to cry, looking down, while saying, `Everybody is speaking so proudly, but they are\nnot supposed to do so'. Subsequently when I lightly patted her shoulder, she would not look\nback, stepped up to the tatami (straw mat) spread over the floor and sat upright on it. When\nstepping up onto the tatami mat, she took off her shoes and put them in order on the mat.\n[Case 17] A female in her 60s, Alzheimer disease, CDR: Severe\nDay and night this subject went out to wander, and hardly contacted others except for\nexchanging a few words. (< >) However, on one occasion she addressed herself in a half-\nsitting posture to her very old fellow inmate who was saying weakly, `I haven't eaten\nanything' in a depressive state. I was standing nearby, and shortly after she asked me for\nassistance, saying `Doctor! She is complaining of pains in her legs. I understand you are busy,\nbut please'. Nevertheless, she did not intend to pull the author's hand, and after having said, `I\nthink you are busy, but. . .', she returned to the inmate, saying tearfully, `A young man is coming\nsoon for you. I, Granny, have a pain, too'. A few minutes later, however, she resumed her\ncustomary loitering around without even casting a look to this old woman.\nDiscussion. At this stage, the subjects are unable to evaluate not only the self-intention and\ndesire as the self-mind, but also the self-situation. Consequently, they do not only\nunderstand `What they want to do', and `What they want to be done', but also `What\nthey are doing'. As they cannot understand their own situation, they are naturally unable\nto seek other's assistance. At this stage, the subjects scarcely expressed themselves. This may\nbe attributed to not only to the consequences of atrophy of the brain, but also the result of a\ndecrease in the necessity to communicate the self-intention, desire, or situations to others.\nThis reduced requirement for communication may be attributed to a vicious circle causing\nloss of expressions in word and decrease of the opportunity to seek the assistance of others.\nHowever, as the subjects who passed the task of `self-consciousness' could retain\nempathetic behavior (Figure 2), it was sometimes observed that, among the empathetic\nbehaviors, there were the scenes of seeking others' help (Case 17). Also in Case 16, the\nexpression of `Everybody is speaking proudly, and they are not supposed to speak in such\na manner' seemed to seek other's help through the subject's assessment of the minds of\nothers; it should, however, be understood as a panic-stricken reaction to a shout made by\nsome inmate not directed to her, and not as seeking assistance based on the belief of what a\ncertain other person was thinking. After her insistence of, `They are not supposed to speak in\nsuch a manner', the subject did not even look at me. Although the self is grasped from two\naspects as the subject of consciousness and behavior (I), and as the object of the\nconsciousness (me), it may be appropriate to understand her above words not as a\nrequest for assistance from the author being one of the others, but as the words of the\nself (I), who is a panic-stricken subject, empathizing the self (me), who is a crying object.\nIt is presumed that this phenomenon occurred due to the vague differentiation between the\nself (I) as the subject and the self as the object (me), which were born together with a self-\nconsciousness developing through relations with others during infancy.\nFour subjects who did not pass the task of `self-consciousness'\nCharacteristics and discussion. For these final four subjects, no scenarios were observed where\nseeking another's assistance occurred. The reason may be attributed to the psychological\ndifference becoming unclear between the self and the others, and consequently leading to loss\nof the emotion of empathy and to suppressing the behavior of empathy on both the others\nand the self.\nTable 1. Summary of the reasons why dementia patients become unable to perform normal activities of\ndaily living\nSelf-awareness\nStage\nEmotion that has been\nretained\nCharacteristics at each stage\nTask of ` theory of\nmind ' passed\nGuilt Shame Pride\n(As a weak shame)\nEmbarrassment\nIn a normal life in the facility, a patient can presume the\nminds of others so as to seek assistance from others.\nHowever, due to inability of precise presumption of the self\nand other minds, the patient cannot be confident of the\nself-existence, always feeling the unstable self-existence.\nConsequently, the unstable self is easily disturbed at the\nothers' speeches and actions or at the others' presences,\nwhich makes it unable to evaluate the self-situation,\nleading often to inability to ask for help from others.\nEmpathy Envy\nEmbarrassment\nFear Anger Disgust\nSadness Surprise Joy\nDistress Interest\nContentment\nTask of ` theory of\nmind ' un-passed\nand task of\n`self-evaluation'\npassed\nGuilt Shame Pride\n(As a weak shame)\nEmbarrassment\nDue to ability to make the self-evaluation, the patient can\ncommunicate the self-situation with others. However,\nbecause of inability to presume other minds, nor at the\nsame time the self-mind, `What the self wants to do' (the\nself-intention) and `What the self wants to be done' (the\nself-desire) become vague, which makes it impossible to\nseek specific assistance from others. On the contrary,\nwhen the patient feels a danger upon oneself, or when the\nappetite is stimulated, the self-desire becomes clearer, and\nthe patient may seek assistance from others.\nEmpathy Envy\nEmbarrassment\nFear Anger Disgust\nSadness Surprise Joy\nDistress Interest\nContentment\nTask of\n`self-evaluation '\nun-passed and\ntask of\n`self-consciousness'\npassed\nEmpathy Envy\nEmbarrassment\nThe patient is unable to evaluate not only the self-intention\nand desire as the self-mind, but also the self-situation. As\na result, the patient can understand neither `What the self\nwants to do' (the self-intention), nor `What the self wants to\nbe done' (the self-desire), nor `what the self is doing' (the\nself-situation). Being unable to understand the\nself-situation, the patient cannot naturally seek assistance\nfrom others. However, as the patient has retained the\nemotion of empathy, the scenes seeking assistance from\nothers may, as a consequence, be observed in the empathy\nbehavior.\nFear Anger Disgust\nSadness Surprise Joy\nDistress Interest\nContentment\nTask of\n`self-consciousness'\nun-passed\nFear Anger Disgust\nSadness Surprise Joy\nDistress Interest\nContentment\nLoss of the self-consciousness makes the psychological\ndistinction vague, so that the patient may lose the emotion\nof empathy, and, as a result of the behavior of empathy, not\nseeking assistance from others.\nConclusion\nFrom the above findings, the author arranged the reasons in Table 1 why dementia patients\ngradually become unable to enjoy ADL with advancement of decreased ability of self-\nawareness.\nWith the advancement of the decrease of self-awareness ability, dementia patients become\nunable to understand `What the self wants to do' (the self-intention) and `What the self\nwants to be done' (the self-desire). Next they become unable to understand `What the self is\ndoing' (the self-situation). Finally being unable to make the psychological distinction\nbetween the self and others, they become unable to perform human relationships, and to\ncarry out ADL as a result. In the case of the physically handicapped, even people with\nserious disorder can carry out ADL with seeking assistance from others. This is because\nthey can establish human relationships by the psychological distinction between the self and\nothers, and recognizing `What the self is doing', `What the self wants to do', and `What the\nself wants to be done'.\nIt can be said that human beings are able to live with adaptation to the complex field of\nhuman relations only after acquiring the function to distinguish between the self and others\n(`self-consciousness'), the function to evaluate their thoughts and actions in comparison with\nthe standards of the society in which they live (`self-evaluation') and, finally, the function to\npresume others' minds (`theory of mind'). In today's primatology and theory of evolution,\nthe evolution of `intellect' is not caused by the fact that a human being makes tools; the\nMachiavellian intelligence hypothesis has become an established theory whereby it is\npurportedly necessary for a man to adapt to complicated human relations, such as\ncooperation or bargaining with other individuals within a group, and so on (Byrne &\nself-awareness ability, which is the adaptation ability to human relations, is considered to\nbe an appropriate and powerful method (which also has evolutionary and primatological\naspects) for dementia patients with declining `intelligence' who become unable to successfully\nperform ADL.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-\nprofit sectors.\nConflict of interest statement\nNone declared.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
