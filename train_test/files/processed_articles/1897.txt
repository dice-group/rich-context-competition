To describe the sociodemo-\ngraphic differences among Mexican American children\n(first, second, and third generation), non-Hispanic black\nchildren, and non-Hispanic white children; to compare\nthe health status and health care needs of Mexican Amer-\nican children (first, second, and third generation) with\nthose of non-Hispanic black children and non-Hispanic\nwhite children; and to determine whether first-genera-\ntion Mexican American children have poorer health care\naccess and utilization than do non-Hispanic white chil-\ndren, after controlling for health insurance status and\nsocioeconomic status.\nMethods. The Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey was used to create a sample of 4372\nMexican American children (divided into 3 generational\nHispanic white children, 2 months to 16 years of age. We\ncompared parent/caregiver reports of health status and\nneeds (perceived health of the child and reported ill-\nnesses), health care access (usual source of health care\nand specific provider), and health care utilization (con-\ntact with a physician within the past year, use of pre-\nscription medications, physician visit because of earache/\ninfection, and hearing and vision screenings) for\ndifferent subgroups within the sample.\nResults. More than two thirds of first-generation\nMexican American children were poor and uninsured\nand had parents with low educational attainment. More\nthan one fourth of first-generation children were per-\nceived as having poor or fair health, despite experiencing\nsimilar or better rates of illnesses, compared with other\nchildren. Almost one half of first-generation Mexican\nAmerican children had not seen a doctor in the past year,\ncompared with one fourth or less for other groups.\nHealth care needs among first-generation Mexican Amer-\nican children were lower, on the basis of reported ill-\nnesses, but perceived health status was worse than for all\nother groups. After controlling for health insurance cov-\nerage and socioeconomic status, first-generation Mexican\nAmerican children and non-Hispanic black children\nwere less likely than non-Hispanic white children to\nhave a usual source of care, to have a specific provider, or\nto have seen or talked with a physician in the past year.\nConclusions. Of the 3 groups of children, Mexican\nAmerican children had the least health care access and\nutilization, even after controlling for socioeconomic sta-\ntus and health insurance status. Our findings showed\nthat Mexican American children had much lower levels\nof access and utilization than previously reported for\nHispanic children on the whole. As a subgroup, first-\ngeneration Mexican American children fared substan-\ntially worse than second- or third-generation children.\nThe discrepancy between poor perceived health status\nand lower rates of reported illnesses in the first-genera-\ntion group leads to questions regarding generalized ap-\nplication of the \"epidemiologic paradox.\" Given the\noverall growth of the Hispanic population in the United\nStates and the relative growth of individual immigrant\nsubgroups, the identification of subgroups in need is\nessential for the development of effective research and\npolicy. Furthermore, taking generational status into ac-\ncount is likely to be revealing with respect to disparities\nin access to and utilization of pediatric services.

NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey.\nChildren living in the United States who are\nLatino, including Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,\nCubans, and South Americans, are continu-\nally recognized as an underserved and high-risk\npopulation, compared with non-Latino white chil-\ndren. However, identification and discussion of\nhealth disparities that characterize this heteroge-\nneous group of children are difficult because the\nLatino child health data are infrequently analyzed\naccording to pertinent subgroups.1 Furthermore,\nstudies rarely incorporate information about the\nlength of time immigrant families have been in the\nUnited States, which can be associated with social\nand economic risk factors that also affect health.2,3\nThe limited availability of subgroup- and generation-\nspecific data has inhibited our ability to identify the\nhighest-risk groups of Latino children and to de-\nscribe and understand the factors that contribute to\ntheir increased risk.\nAlthough the growth in the Latino population in\nthe United States can be attributed to all subgroups,\nMexican-born immigrants constitute the largest and\nfastest growing group of immigrants.4 Several stud-\nies have addressed access to and utilization of health\ncare services by Latino adults and children in the\nFrom the *Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics, Stan-\nford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California; Department of\nPediatrics, James H.

Those\nanalyses revealed that Mexican ethnicity was an in-\ndependent risk factor for being uninsured and that\nMexican American children had fewer physician vis-\nits in 1 year, compared with other Latino subgroups.\nHowever, data for immigrant or first-generation\nMexican American children are lacking.5\u00ad10\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey (NHANES III),11 which was con-\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, offers the opportunity to examine\ndifferences in health care needs, access, and utiliza-\ntion for Mexican American, non-Hispanic black,\nand non-Hispanic white children. Moreover, the\nNHANES III is one of the few datasets that over-\nsampled Mexican American children and provides\ninformation on generational status (immigrant/first\ngeneration, second generation, or third generation).\nAlthough \"Latino\" is more widely accepted as a\ndescriptor for this population, we use the NHANES\ndescriptor \"Hispanic\" in this article, to maintain clar-\nity regarding the variables being discussed.\nIn this study, we had 3 goals, (1) to describe the\nsociodemographic differences among Mexican\nAmerican children (first, second, and third genera-\ntion), non-Hispanic black children, and non-Hispanic\nwhite children; (2) to compare health status and\nhealth care needs of Mexican American children\n(first, second, and third generation) with those of\nnon-Hispanic black children and non-Hispanic white\nchildren; and (3) to examine whether first-generation\nMexican American children have poorer health care\naccess and utilization than do non-Hispanic white\nchildren, after controlling for health insurance status\nand socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that\nfirst-generation Mexican American children had\nworse health status and greater health care needs, as\nwell as poorer health care access and utilization, than\ndid non-Hispanic white children.\nMETHODS\nStudy Sample\nNHANES III constitutes a cross-sectional representative sample\nof the US civilian noninstitutionalized population 2 months of\nage living in households. The survey was conducted at 89 loca-\ntions in two 3-year phases. The survey used stratified, multistage,\nprobability sampling. Weights indicating the probability of being\nsampled were assigned to each respondent. Mexican Americans,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, children 5 years of age, and adults 60\nyears of age were oversampled, to provide more reliable estimates\nfor these groups. Household interviews with a responsible adult,\nusually the head of household, provided information about family\ncharacteristics and about each sample person, including identifi-\ncation of race/ethnicity and generational status. All household\ninterview procedures, including interviews with English- and\nSpanish-speaking respondents, were pretested, and revisions and\nadjustments were made as necessary to ensure the success of the\nmain study.\nAll children 2 months to 16 years of age with interview infor-\nmation were included. Our analysis sample was composed of\nnon-Hispanic whites. Among Mexican American children, the\nfirst-generation group included children born in Mexico with at\nleast 1 parent born in Mexico or another non-US country. The\nsecond-generation group included children born in the United\nStates with at least 1 parent born in Mexico or another non-US\ncountry. The third-generation group included children born in the\nUnited States with both parents also born in the United States.\nDependent Variables\nData Source\nAll variables for the children were drawn from items on the\nfamily questionnaire and household questionnaire included in\nNHANES III; answers to these items were reported by the parent\nor caregiver.\nHealth Status and Health Care Needs\nHealth status and health care need were assessed with 5 items.\nThese items addressed current perceived health of the child (di-\nchotomized as poor/fair or good/very good/excellent); illnesses\nduring the past 12 months, including cold or flu (yes/no) and\npneumonia (yes/no); and earache/ear infection at any time in the\npast (yes/no; if yes, the number of past earaches/infections was\nHealth Care Access\nHealth care access was assessed with 2 items, ie, usual source of\ncare (yes/no) and usual specific provider (yes/no). Information\non usual specific provider was available only for children who had\na usual source of care.\nHealth Care Utilization\nHealth care utilization was assessed with 4 items. The primary\nitem was time since last spoke to or visited a physician, catego-\nrized as 1 year, 1 year or 2 years, 2 years or 5 years, or 5\nyears or never. Secondary items included use of prescription\nmedication in the past month, seen by a physician during ear-\nache/infection (if answered yes to having had an earache/infec-\ntion), and time since last hearing and vision screens; these items\nwere dichotomous. Hearing and vision screens were included as\nindicators of the use of preventive care. Children 4 to 5 years of\nages were categorized regarding whether they had ever under-\ngone hearing and vision screening. Children 6 to 11 years of age\nand 12 to 16 years of age were categorized regarding whether they\nhad undergone hearing and vision screening within the past 2\nyears.\nIndependent Variables\nThe primary independent variable was reported race/ethnicity\nand generational status, defined as first-generation Mexican\nAmerican, second-generation Mexican American, third-genera-\ntion Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, or non-Hispanic\nwhite. Other independent variables included 6 sociodemographic\nvariables that are known to affect health care access and utiliza-\ntion. The poverty income ratio was defined as the ratio of reported\nhousehold income to the poverty threshold in the calendar year in\nwhich the participants were interviewed and was categorized as\nof the head of household was dichotomized as single female or\notherwise. Head of household educational level was categorized\nas 9 years, 9 to 12 years, or 12 years. Residence location was\ndichotomized as urban (county population of 1 million) or rural\n(county population of 1 million). The primary language spoken\nin the home was categorized as Spanish, English, or bilingual. The\ntype of health insurance was categorized as private, public (Med-\nicaid or Champus), or uninsured.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe NHANES III data were weighted to account for the un-\nequal probabilities of selection resulting from the survey cluster\ndesign, oversampling of certain groups, and item nonresponse.\nPrevalence estimates and stepwise logistic regression analyses\nwere performed with sample weights with SUDAAN, version 8.0\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a soft-\nware program for analysis of data from complex sample sur-\nveys.12 The 5 groups of children were compared with respect to\nsociodemographic variables and the health status, health care\nneed, access, and utilization variables with 2 tests.\nTABLE 1.

Independent variables included race/ethnicity and\ngenerational status, age, gender, single female head of household,\nhead of household educational level, urban residence location,\nand health insurance status. Household poverty index was with-\nheld from the models to avoid colinearity with other indicators of\nsocioeconomic status.\nStepwise logistic regression analyses began with no variables in\nthe model. The variable that contributed the most to the regres-\nsion, as determined by the Wald statistic, and was significant at\nthe .15 level was added. After each new variable was added, any\nvariable that no longer met the criteria for significance was re-\nmoved. The stepwise process ended when none of the unselected\nvariables met the entry criteria.13\nRESULTS\nGroup Differences\nSociodemographic Variables\nAs seen in Table 1, all 3 generations of Mexican\nAmerican children were more likely to live in pov-\nerty than were non-Hispanic white children. The\nfirst-generation Mexican American children were\nmost severely affected, with three fourths living in\nhouseholds with incomes below the poverty level,\ncompared with one half of non-Hispanic black chil-\ndren and one sixth of non-Hispanic white children.\nAmong Mexican American children, however, many\nof the heads of households were employed. First-\nand second-generation Mexican American heads of\nhouseholds had similar levels of employment, and\nboth were higher than the level for non-Hispanic\nblack households. First-generation Mexican Ameri-\ncan children were the least likely to be in households\nheaded by a single female adult, but this value dou-\nbled for the second- and third-generation groups and\nthe value was highest for non-Hispanic blacks, with\n1 in 2 households being headed by a single female\nadult.\nMexican American households had lower educa-\ntional levels, compared with both non-Hispanic\nblacks and whites, and first-generation Mexican\nAmericans had the lowest levels, with three fourths\nreporting less than a ninth grade education. First-\ngeneration Mexican American children were more\nlikely to reside in urban areas, and the percentages\nwere lower for second- and third-generation chil-\ndren. First-generation Mexican American children\nwere more likely to live in households where Span-\nish was spoken as the primary language. Third-gen-\neration Mexican American children were more likely\nto live in households where English was spoken as\nthe primary language.\nTwo thirds of the first-generation Mexican Amer-\nican children in our sample were uninsured. This\nnumber was lower for second- and third-generation\nchildren, but the third-generation children were still\ntwice as likely to be uninsured as non-Hispanic\nwhite children. All 3 generations of Mexican Amer-\nican children were more likely to be covered by\npublic insurance than were non-Hispanic white chil-\ndren. Disproportionately fewer insured first- and\nsecond-generation Mexican American children were\ncovered by private health insurance, compared with\nother groups.\nHealth Status and Health Care Needs\nAs seen in Table 1, greater percentages of first- and\nsecond-generation Mexican American children were\nperceived to be in fair or poor health, compared with\nall other groups. The percentage of third-generation\nMexican American children perceived to be in fair or\npoor health was comparable to that of non-Hispanic\nblack children. The percentage of first-generation\nMexican American children with reported cold or flu\nin the past 12 months was lower than values for all\nother groups except non-Hispanic blacks. The per-\ncentage of first-generation Mexican American chil-\ndren with reported pneumonia in the past 12 months\nwas lower than values for all other groups. The\npercentage of first-generation Mexican children re-\nported to ever have had an earache/infection was\nalso lower than values for all other groups.\nHealth Care Access\nAs seen in Table 2, first-generation Mexican Amer-\nicans were the least likely to have a usual source of\ncare (slightly more than one half of the group). Sec-\nond- and third-generation Mexican American chil-\ndren had much better access, with levels similar to\nthose of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white\nchildren. Similarly, of those reporting a usual source\nof care, first-generation Mexican American children\nwere least likely to have a usual specific provider.\nThe percentages were higher for the second- and\nthird-generation groups, but the percentage of third-\ngeneration children with a usual specific provider\nwas lower than that for non-Hispanic white children.\nHealth Care Utilization\nAs seen in Table 2, only one half of first-generation\nMexican American children had seen or talked to a\nphysician within the past year, compared with three\nfourths of children in all other groups. Three fourths\nof all first-generation Mexican American children\nhad not seen a physician within the past 2 years, and\none tenth had not seen a physician in 5 years.\nSimilarly, in almost every age cohort, first-generation\nMexican Americans were the least likely to have\nused prescription medications in the past month, to\nhave had an ear infection and been seen by a doctor,\nand to have undergone routine hearing and vision\nscreening.\nPrediction of Health Care Access and Utilization,\nConsidering Socioeconomic Status and Health\nInsurance\nHealth Care Access\nIn the stepwise logistic regression models shown\nin Table 3, both first-generation Mexican American\nchildren and non-Hispanic black children were less\nlikely to have a usual source of care than were non-\nHispanic white children, after controlling for several\nsociodemographic variables. Younger children and\nchildren without health insurance were also less\nlikely to have a usual source of care. Among those\nTABLE 2.

Only third-generation Mexican\nAmerican children did not differ significantly from\nnon-Hispanic white children.\nHealth Care Utilization\nIn the logistic regression model in Table 3, and\nsimilar to the results for health care access, first-\ngeneration Mexican American and non-Hispanic\nblack children were less likely to have seen a physi-\ncian in the past year than were non-Hispanic white\nchildren, after controlling for sociodemographic vari-\nables. Younger children, children without health in-\nsurance, children who resided in rural areas, and\nchildren in less-educated households were less likely\nto have seen or talked with a physician within the\npast year. Boys were less likely to have seen or talked\nwith a physician within the past year.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough previous studies with NHANES III data\nshowed differences between Mexican American chil-\ndren and non-Hispanic white children in many dif-\nferent areas, categorizing Mexican American chil-\ndren according to generational status revealed more\nmarked disparities in the areas of access and utiliza-\ntion. Hispanics are the largest group of minority\nchildren in the United States, and Mexican Ameri-\ncans are the largest subgroup of Hispanic immi-\ngrants; therefore, understanding the risk factors re-\nlated to generational status is vital for clinicians,\nhealth care institutions, and policy makers.\nOur analysis showed that first-generation Mexican\nAmerican families had a greater risk burden with\nrespect to poverty level, educational attainment, and\nlanguage. The prevalence of these risk factors among\nfirst-generation Mexican American children was sub-\nstantial. Two thirds were living in poverty, three\nfourths of the heads of household had less than ninth\ngrade educations, and less than one tenth used En-\nglish in the household. The prevalences of poverty\nand low educational level were much greater than\nthose reported for the greater foreign-born popula-\ntively).14 Despite a head of household employment\nrate equal to that for second-generation Mexican\nAmericans and higher than that for non-Hispanic\nblacks, first-generation Mexican American children\nwere at greatest risk of being uninsured. In contrast\nto other risk factors, first-generation families had the\nlowest rate of single female adult-headed households\namong all groups.\nImmigrant children are commonly excluded from\nfederal health insurance programs, and Hispanic\nchildren are consistently found to have the highest\nrates of being uninsured. Most recently, the Census\nBureau reported that 24.1% of Hispanic children\nwere uninsured, compared with 13.9% of non-His-\npanic black children, 11.7% of Asian/Pacific Islander\nchildren, and 7.4% of non-Hispanic white children.15\nHowever, studying all subgroups under the His-\nTABLE 3.

Mexican\nAmerican children, who vary in their residential sta-\ntus, are typically grouped with Puerto Rican chil-\ndren, who are all US citizens, and with Cuban Amer-\nicans, who may be US citizens or have refugee status.\nFurthermore, the lack of data according to genera-\ntional status decreases these differences, with under-\nestimation of the risk of being uninsured.\nIn our study, first-generation Mexican American\nchildren had the highest rate of being uninsured, ie,\n64.2%, which was significantly higher than the per-\ncentage reported for Hispanics as a whole. Signifi-\ncant differences persisted for the second- and third-\ngeneration groups. In fact, each generational group\nof Mexican American children was more likely to be\nuninsured than either non-Hispanic white children\nor black children. It is also interesting to note that,\namong first-generation Mexican American children,\nthere were almost equal proportions of children with\nprivate and public health insurance. This is not sur-\nprising, because 70% of the heads of household were\nemployed. We suspect that a significantly greater\nproportion of first-generation children could be in-\nsured if their parents worked for employers who\nprovided health insurance. Even when insurance is\noffered, however, many employed Hispanics in poor\nand low-income households decline coverage be-\ncause of lack of affordability.16\nPrevious reports that immigrant children as a\nwhole are less likely to have health insurance, less\nlikely to have a usual source of care, and less likely to\nhave had a doctor's visit in the past year were limited\nin that they did not differentiate Hispanic subgroups\nor generations.3,17 Our results confirmed that first-\ngeneration Mexican American children had much\nworse health care access than previously described\nfor Hispanic children as a whole. Previous studies\nshowed that 82% to 89% of Hispanic children had a\nusual source of care.8,18 With regard to immigrant\nchildren, one report indicated that 51% of all foreign-\nborn children (including Latino, white, black, and\nAsian children) in working-poor families were unin-\nsured and that 65% had a usual source of care. Our\nresults are consistent with these findings but suggest\nthat first-generation Mexican American children may\nalso fare worse than immigrant children considered\nas a whole. Even when first-generation Mexican\nAmerican children were insured, they had the lowest\nlikelihood of having a regular source of care or a\nspecific provider.\nFirst-generation Mexican American children also\ndemonstrated the lowest levels of utilization of\nhealth care services, as assessed by visits to a physi-\ncian, use of prescription medications, and screening\nfor hearing and vision problems. Poor health care\naccess is a known predictor of poor health care uti-\nlization; however, the data also suggest that the first-\ngeneration group might have had decreased needs.\nFor example, fewer reported earaches/infections in\nthe first-generation group and lower levels of treat-\nment for ear infections were consistent with fewer\nvisits to a physician for earache/infection. First-gen-\neration Mexican American children also had lower\nrates of reported cold or flu, pneumonia, and ear\ninfections, which were consistent with lower rates of\nprescription medication use.\nBetter health outcomes in recent immigrant popu-\nlations form the basis of what has been described as\nthe \"epidemiologic paradox.\" Previous studies of\nperinatal outcomes showed that, despite the pres-\nence of demographic and socioeconomic risk factors,\nforeign-born Mexican American women have low\nbirth weight infant birth rates and infant mortality\nrates similar to those of white women.19 It has not\nbeen confirmed that any advantage at birth persists\ninto early childhood, and study results are conflict-\ning. Previous studies suggested that Mexican Amer-\nican mothers report low rates of asthma, coordina-\ntion problems, psychologic and behavioral problems,\nspeech problems, and mental retardation among\ntheir children, suggesting that immigrant children\nmay fare better with regard to specific illnesses.20\nHowever, a more recent study testing this hypothesis\ninto early childhood showed that generational status\nalone accounted for lower developmental scores\namong Mexican American children.21\nOur findings showing lower rates of specific ill-\nnesses among first-generation Mexican American\nchildren seem to support the epidemiologic paradox,\nsuggesting that first-generation Mexican American\nchildren had decreased health care needs with re-\nspect to the conditions reported. This might have\ntranslated into decreased utilization of health ser-\nvices for this group. Furthermore, our findings sup-\nport the theory that Mexican American children be-\ncome less healthy as they become more acculturated.\nSubsequent generations reported higher prevalences\nof the 3 illnesses tested, adding to evidence in the\nliterature that Hispanic immigrant children have\nhealth outcomes and indicators that worsen with\ngreater acculturation and each successive genera-\nIn light of what might be better outcomes for first-\ngeneration Mexican American children, we are faced\nwith reconciling the fact that the same group had the\nhighest percentage of children reported to be in fair\nor poor health. This finding is line with previous\nstudies,2 and there are 3 possible explanations for the\ndiscrepancy. First, poor access to care could have\nbiased the group toward lower reporting of need.\n(NHANES III was based on parent or guardian re-\nports and not clinician-diagnosed illness or clinic-\nbased utilization figures.) Second, a language bias\ncould have existed for the monolingual Spanish-\nspeakers. Although the NHANES questionnaires\nwere forward- and reverse-translated and adminis-\ntered by bilingual interviewers, colloquial differ-\nences could have affected how the questions were\ninterpreted. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,\nrecent immigrants may perceive health differently,\nleading to different reporting patterns. Whether per-\nception of poor health is an indicator of undetected\ndisease burden or a difference in the cultural view of\nillness is unknown and requires additional investi-\ngation.\nIndeed, culture, cultural perspective, and/or cul-\ntural differences may account for a portion of the\ndifference attributed to generational status in this\nstudy. One of the most studied measures of accul-\nturation, namely, language, reflected the first-gener-\nation Mexican American households in this study,\nwith 93% being primarily Spanish-speaking. Al-\nthough the definitions of acculturation varied, past\nstudies that used language preference as a measure\nof acculturation showed increased use of preventive\nservices and decreased perceived barriers to care for\nHispanics who spoke English.22 Our findings are\nconsistent with this line of thought, in that a substan-\ntially higher number of first-generation Mexican\nAmerican households reported Spanish as the pri-\nmary language spoken and also had lower levels of\nhealth care access and utilization, compared with the\nother groups. Because of colinearity of language and\ngenerational status, we did not include language in\nthe multivariate analysis.\nThe language and culture of the medical office\nmay have disproportionate effects on utilization of\nhealth care for first-generation immigrants. Hispanic\nparents identify language problems, long waits at the\nphysician's office, lack of health insurance, difficulty\npaying medical bills, and difficulty arranging trans-\nportation as the greatest barriers to care. However,\nmany (10%) may not bring their children in for care\nif the medical staff does not understand Hispanic\nculture.23 This is an important realization that points\nto systemic factors, as opposed to individual patient\nfactors, as causes of racial/ethnic disparities in\nhealth care. The cultural shortcomings of clinical\nstaff, including lack of Spanish language proficiency,\nlack of knowledge of Hispanic culture, and lack of\nHispanic staff members, cannot be underestimated.\nAdditional research is required to identify the spe-\ncific barriers to health care access and utilization for\nspecific population subgroups, the benefits of a cul-\nturally competent and language-friendly clinical en-\nvironment, and the costs of creating and maintaining\nsuch an environment.\nOur study has certain limitations. One limitation is\nthat the NHANES data were collected 10 years ago\nand are cross-sectional, which may limit the applica-\nbility to today's population. However, it is the largest\navailable collection of data on Mexican American\nchildren and one of the only datasets that allows\nanalysis according to generation. Although the num-\nber of Mexican American immigrant children in the\nUnited States is significantly larger than a decade\nago, the differences in language and culture are un-\nchanged and the percentage of minority physicians is\nunchanged. The only change in national legislation\nhas been in the form of tax incentives to employers\nwho provide health insurance for their employees.\nAlthough the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-\ngram has made an impact in enrolling minority pop-\nulations, the gains are likely to be lost as states op-\nerate under budget deficits and legislatures cut\nstatewide programs designed to reach underserved\npopulations. Recently, several states extended public\ninsurance to nonresidents through initiatives such as\nCalifornia's Healthy Kids. These programs are also\nexpected to suffer. NHANES IV, which is in progress\nthrough 2004, will allow us to replicate our analysis\nand to evaluate trends. A second limitation is that all\ndata on health care access and utilization and health\nstatus were recorded from household interviews and\nwere not verified through primary health care\nsources, which introduces potential bias. A third lim-\nitation is that, in our analyses, we made no multivar-\niate adjustment for primary language spoken at\nhome, which has been shown to affect health care\noutcomes. This adjustment might have had an effect\nfor a small subset of first-generation Mexican Amer-\nican households (3.1%) that spoke primarily English.\nFinally, the race/ethnicity groupings specified in our\nanalysis used the categories provided in the\nNHANES III dataset, ie, non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American. These cate-\ngories excluded data on children coded as \"other.\"\nThe sample size for this group coded as other was\ntoo small for analytical use, and the category, which\nincluded other Hispanics, Asians, and Native Amer-\nicans, could not be labeled accurately. Overall, our\nanalysis is strengthened by the use of a large, nation-\nally representative dataset with oversampled minor-\nity groups and by the unique differentiation of Mex-\nican American children according to generational\nstatus.\nMost studies in pediatric health care fail to differ-\nentiate between immigrant and nonimmigrant chil-\ndren, despite the fact that 1 in 5 children in the\nUnited States is an immigrant or lives in an immi-\ngrant family. Similarly, most studies of Hispanic chil-\ndren, including studies of immigrants, fail to differ-\nentiate the experience of individual ethnic groups\naccording to country of origin. This lack of data\nleaves us with an inability to distinguish differences\nin health care needs, access, utilization, and costs\nbetween US- and foreign-born children, creating a\nsignificant problem in terms of health care delivery\nand development of public policy. More impor-\ntantly, this shortcoming leaves immigrant children in\nthe United States at a disadvantage with regard to\nhealth care.\nOur study showed that Mexican American immi-\ngrant children, the largest group of immigrant chil-\ndren in the United States, were not obtaining ade-\nquate access to health care, despite the gainful\nemployment of their parents. Furthermore, the\ngroup lacked continuity of care and was most likely\nto miss preventive care services such as hearing and\nvision screening. Although some of our findings sup-\nported the epidemiologic paradox, findings on pa-\nrental perception of the health status of the first-\ngeneration Mexican American children did not.\nUnderstanding such differences between immigrant\nand nonimmigrant children in the United States is\nessential for improving access to and utilization of\npediatric services, especially given the overall\ngrowth of the Hispanic population in the United\nStates and the relative growth of immigrant Hispanic\nsubgroups.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge Michaela Kiernan, PhD, for insight-\nful comments during the preparation of this article.\nREFERENCES\n1.
