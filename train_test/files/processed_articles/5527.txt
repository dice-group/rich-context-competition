Lustrous surface appearances can be elicited by simple image configurations with no texture\nor specular highlights, as most prominently illustrated by Helmholtz' demonstration of stereoscopic\nlustre. Three types of explanatory framework have been proposed for stereoscopic lustre, which\nattribute the phenomenon to a binocular luminance conflict, an internalised physical regularity\n(Helmholtz), or to a disentangling of ``essential'' and ``accidental'' attributes in surface representations\n(Hering). In order to investigate these frameworks, we used haploscopically fused half-images of\ncentre-surround configurations in which the luminances of the test patch were dynamically modulated.\nExperiment 1 shows that stereoscopic lustre is not specifically tied to situations of a luminance conflict\nbetween the eyes. Experiment 2 identifies a novel aspect in the binocular temporal dynamics that\nprovides a physical basis for lustrous appearances, namely the occurrence of a temporal luminance\ncounter-modulation between the eyes. This feature sheds some light on the internal principles\nunderlying a disentangling of ``accidental'' and ``essential'' surface attributes.

More than shape or colour, material appear-\nances impart objects their distinctive properties of, say, being soft, wet, smooth, silky, edible, or\ndeformable. By visually perceiving material properties, specific kinds of objects and stuff can be iden-\ntified and a great variety of object properties can be visually grasped that go far beyond purely visibly\ndefinable attributes. They pertain, for instance, to \"stability,\" \"tenacity,\" \"ruggedness,\" or to attributes\nsuch as \"lustrous,\" \"hard,\" \"juicy,\" \"dry\" etc. The capacity of visually perceiving material properties is\npart of our more general perceptual capacity for making causal assignments and for embedding all of\nour experiences into various kinds of internal causal analyses. The specific kind of dispositional prop-\nerties and causal ascriptions that are perceptually attainable from the sensory data is subordinated to\nthe type of \"perceptual object\" that is activated by the sensory data. In the case of \"surfaces\"--under-\nstood as perceptual objects, not as physical ones--these dispositional properties pertain to material\nqualities, and the causal ascriptions to, e.g., how surfaces will appear under changes in their orientation\nand location, which haptic experiences will be elicited by them, and how they will behave under vari-\nous kinds of interactions, both with an agent and with other objects. Attributes pertaining to material\nqualities are thus intrinsically transmodal in character.\nThe identification of the principles and mechanisms by which material qualities are brought forth\nposes a pre-eminent challenge for perception theory. In the history of perceptual psychology, system-\natic investigations of the visual perception of material qualities have been largely neglected in favour\nof investigations of seemingly simpler attributes such as shape or colour. This was not only due to a\nLustrous material appearances: Internal and external\nconstraints on triggering conditions for binocular lustre\n2 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\ntheoretical preoccupation with elementary attribute but also due to the difficulties that one encounters\nin attempts to experimentally vary material appearances in a quantitative and parametric way (e.g.,\nOnly recently, a new interest in the visual perception of material appearances has emerged, which\noriginates mainly from problems of rendering. Rendering purposes (e.g., Dorsey & Hanrahan, 2000)\nalso go along with a strong interest in identifying in the 2D visual input crucial parameters by which\na given material appearance can be varied in a controlled way. These investigations revealed that\nmaterial appearances, such as lustre, silk (Koenderink & Pont, 2002), translucency (e.g., Fleming &\nexceedingly intricate triggering conditions. They can be invoked by a multiplicity of combinations of\nspecific ranges of image parameters. As expected, some subsets of the triggering conditions, by which\na given material appearance can be elicited, can be related to external regularities of the ecological\nphysics of the \"corresponding\" type of material, i.e. to regularities in the way light interacts with\ncertain types of physical surfaces. Yet, the specific class of triggering conditions for a certain material\nappearance, i.e. the equivalence classes of input properties that are tied to a certain material appear-\nance, cannot be understood by exclusively focussing on external physical regularities. The triggering\nconditions for material appearances are given by a rather motley conglomerate of physical conditions,\nwhich has about the same degree of physical \"naturalness\" as, e.g., metameric colour classes have\nwith respect to the wavelength composition of lights. While these triggering conditions partly mirror\nthe great variety of complex optical processes of the interaction between illumination and surface\nproperties, they are also determined by the conceptual forms or internal data types underlying compu-\ntational processes (cf. Mausfeld, 2010a). The triggering conditions for material appearances thus do\nnot merely mirror external physical regularities but are also moulded by internal structural constraints\npertaining to the abstract data types of our perceptual systems, or in Gelb's (1929) terms, by the \"struc-\ntural forms,\" by which the sensory input is exploited and computationally processed. The complex\ntriggering conditions by which material appearances can be evoked can help us to gain deeper insights\ninto the structure of conceptual forms in which material appearances figure as an internal attribute, and\ninto the nature of the associated internal causal analyses.\nThe neglect of material appearances also has been due to the fact that traditional colour science\nhas been almost exclusively based on a notion of \"pure\" colour, according to which colour can be\nstudied detached from the internal coding of, say, space, texture, or from the regularities that govern\ninteractions of light sources with surfaces (Mausfeld, 2010b). Two interesting exceptions, however, to\nthis traditional neglect of material appearances can be found in the classic literature, namely investi-\ngations, notably by Helmholtz, of stereoscopic lustre, and Katz inquiries into modes of appearances.\nKatz (1911), following Hering, clearly recognised how intimately \"colour\" is interwoven with the\norganisation of \"space.\" Accordingly, Katz descriptively distinguished different \"modes of appear-\nance,\" such as surface colours, volume colours, or illumination colours, each of which exhibits distinc-\ntive phenomenological characteristics and different coding properties with respect to other perceptual\nattributes. Katz's classification already captures in nuce basic intuitions underlying investigations of\nmaterial appearances (cf. Mausfeld, 2003).\nLustrous appearances under impoverished input conditions\nLustrous appearances elude a definition in terms of a clear-cut perceptual criterion. In this respect, they\ndo, however, not differ from other perceptual attributes, such as brightness or hue. In phenomenologi-\ncal studies, subjects describe lustrous appearances as, for instance, \"light and dark, somehow seen as\nif in the same place at the same time,\" \"a sort of blending or fusion of light and dark,\" \"a peculiar com-\nmingling or sifting-together of dark and light,\" or as \"a bulky experience of luminous greyish white\"\n(Bixby, 1928). In the case of elementary colour appearances, Helmholtz and von Kries recoursed to\npurely physical aspects in order to define hue, saturation, and brightness. These surrogates, although\nuseful for colourimetric purposes, are, in the context of perception theory, fraught with considerable\nof colour appearances in terms of hue, saturation and brightness \"does not claim to be a natural one;\nwithout much ado we can regard it as a completely arbitrary one. Such a description is, however, a\ncompletely rigorous one, since it only refers to objective properties of the light that causes the corre-\nsponding appearances.\" In the case of lustrous appearances, we also tend to resort to physical aspects\nrather than to phenomenological ones in order to illustrate what is meant by them. We usually char-\nLustrous material appearances 3\nacterise them by the typical causal situations that give rise to them, viz. certain aspects (beyond those\npertaining to colour or lightness) of a surface which pertain to its interaction with light (note, however,\nthat for qualification as a lustrous appearance it is irrelevant whether it has been brought forth by\nphysical surfaces, objects on a computer screen, or painted objects on a canvas). Thus, we refer, as a\nmakeshift, to the kind of material that typically exhibits these kinds of appearances, and correspond-\ningly speak, for instance, of metallic, graphite, silky, or vitreous lustrous appearances. However, the\nvariegated class of appearances that these appearances of \"lustrous\" material embrace are far from\nhomogeneous and show subtle differences. Whether this gamut of appearances is based on a com-\nmon core of principles or rather mirrors principles and mechanisms of quite different nature is thus an\nempirical question. Because lustrous appearances are typically brought forward by specific physical\nproperties of surfaces with respect to their interaction with light, we regard it as a reasonable starting\npoint to assume that our perceptual system is sensitive to these regularities and associates with them\na particular visual quality. We will here therefore tentatively proceed on the assumption that the phe-\nnomenological class of lustrous appearances results from a common core of principles.\nFor the endeavour to identify internal factors in the coding of material appearances, it is of par-\nticular theoretical interest that lustrous appearances can be elicited by highly impoverished stimulus\nconditions that, in particular, do not contain cues pertaining to texture, or specular highlights. The most\nprominent among these are displays for stereoscopic lustre. Corresponding observations were first\nreported by Dove (1850;1861) and immediately recognised as phenomena of great theoretical impor-\ntance by Helmholtz, Br\u00fccke (1861), Wundt, Kirschmann, B\u00fchler and many others. The phenomenon\nin point can be easily demonstrated by the well-know stimulus configuration (Figure 1) provided by\nUnder stereoscopic viewing conditions, the binocular combination of the two line drawings of\ninverted luminance contrast yields a vivid lustrous appearance. Similar appearances can be produced\nby a great variety of different highly reduced stimulus configurations (e.g., Anstis, 1861; Katz, 1911;\nmonocular viewing conditions. Thus, lustrous appearances are not tied to the kind of binocular con-\nflict apparently underlying Helmholtz' stereoscopic lustre. This has also been witnessed by painters'\nachievements, notably in Dutch Renaissance art (Gombrich, 1976), to evoke lustrous appearances on\na canvas (attempts which exhibit interesting similarities to today's rendering problems).\nIn the classical literature, several studies can be found that attempted to identify critical image\nture). These studies already had shown that the kind of image information that is exploited by the inter-\nnal data types in which material qualities figure as an internal attribute is exceedingly variegated and\nidiosyncratic with respect to the possible physical generation processes, and thus cannot be understood\nwithout taking internal structural regularities into account.\nExplanatory frameworks I: Lustrous appearances as a resolution of a neural conflict\nCorresponding attempts to explain lustrous appearances by rather simple and allegedly \"low-level\"\nneural principles date back to Dove (1850), who attributed the phenomenon of stereoscopic lustre to\na luminance discrepancy of the intensity signals between the two eyes. He also attempted to explain\nmonocular lustre in similar terms by his (rather obscure) \"accommodation theory,\" according to which\nFigure 1. Stereoscopic lustre. The figure is arranged for uncrossed viewing.\n4 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nlustrous appearances were due to an optical accommodation effect caused by the (typically) laminar\nphysical organisation of lustrous surfaces (cf. Rood, 1861). Brewster (1861) objected to the idea that\nstereoscopic lustre mirrored physical regularities of surfaces and regarded it as an entirely idiosyncratic\nphysiological side effect due to a kind of neural conflict resolution in a situation of binocular rivalry.\nPerceptual phenomena that can be described in terms of rivalry are most commonly understood as\nresulting from some kind of neural conflict (e.g., Anstis, 2000; Burr, Ross, & Morrone, 1986; Pinna,\nSpillmann, & Ehrenstein, 2002). In their wake, a variety of parametric conditions for stereoscopic\nlustre have been experimentally identified (e.g., Ludwig, Pieper, & Lachnit, 2007; Pieper & Ludwig,\n1999, 2002). According to these accounts, the visual system cannot merge the different luminances or\nluminance polarities from the two eyes into a stable percept. Instead of resolving the conflict between\nthe two input values by some sort of averaging or by a rivalry in which the appearance alternates in a\nrandom fashion between the two signals, the visual system adopts, on such an account, a new type of\nresolution in-between pure rivalry and homogeneous fusion, which then is perceived as lustre.\nIntuitions referring to neural conflicts have, of course, little explanatory value unless the neural\ncodes with respect to which a conflict is postulated are specified. In the case of binocular rivalry, such\nspecifications usually refer to monocular luminance-based codes. The available empirical evidence,\nhowever, speaks strongly against neural conflict models of binocular rivalry that are based on sim-\nple functions of luminance, and rather suggests \"that rivalry was occurring at a more abstract level\nof image representation than direct monocular signals from the two eyes\" (Lehky, 2011). Binocular\nrivalry seems predominantly to be dissociated from eye-of-origin information and to occur at a level\nof operations that pertain to \"perceptual objects\" (for different types of relevant empirical evidence,\nsee e.g., Kiesow, 1920; Kovacs, Papathomas, Yang, & Feher, 1996; Logothetis, Leopold, & Sheinberg,\nindicating that image luminances are exploited in terms of intimately coupled internal data types per-\ntaining to spatial surface attributes and reflection-dependent surface attributes (e.g., Boyaci, Maloney,\n1.3Explanatory frameworks II: Lustrous appearances as reflecting physical regularities\nHelmholtz (1867), following Oppel (1854), went beyond ad hoc accounts of lustrous appearances in\nterms of simple luminance-based neural conflict accounts. He tied the phenomenon to specific physi-\ncal regularities concerning the relation of surfaces oriented in 3D-space, illumination and observer.\nLustrous appearances, which perceptually vary on some matte-to-glossy dimension, can physi-\ncally be related to surfaces whose Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) are inter-\nmediary cases between a perfectly matte and an ideal specularly reflecting surface. In contrast to a\ndiffuse matte surface, the amount of light reflected from a lustrous surface to the eye(s) of an observer\nalso depends on the viewing direction. Therefore, the two eyes receive, as a rule, different light inten-\nsities from a given point of the surface (Figure 2). Furthermore, small changes in observer position\nor surface orientation can yield large changes in differential binocular input (cf. Beck, 1972; Evans,\nprovides the basis for \"unconscious inferences\" of the attribute of lustre.\nThis Oppel\u00adHelmholtz explanation has, beyond identifying a core physical regularity associated\nwith lustrous surfaces, the advantage that it provides some suggestive structural links to phenomeno-\nlogical regularities associated with lustrous appearances. It is instructive to consider first the corre-\nsponding phenomenological regularities and their link to physical regularities for the case of glossy\nFigure 2. Lustrous surfaces, as specified by the BRDF, yield different intensities in the two eyes of an observer.\nLustrous material appearances 5\nappearances. Because of the reflectance characteristics of a glossy surface--which reflects the incident\nlight to a certain degree in a specular manner--and the distance between both eyes, the positions of the\nhighlights are generally shifted relative to corresponding surface points between the two monocular\nhalf-images and thus have a different disparity from that of the surface (Blake & B\u00fclthoff, 1990; Her-\nThis highlight disparity regularity, illustrated by Figure 3, apparently has a counterpart in a char-\nacteristic aspect of glossy appearances, namely in the phenomenal segmentation of image intensities\ninto two layers one behind the other, one layer pertaining to the level of the reflecting surface, the other\nto an illumination-dependent component. The latter perceptual component is slightly and somehow\nindeterminately separated in depth from the first one.\nThis highlight disparity regularity associated with glossy surfaces obviously bears a close rela-\ntion to the temporal regularity of the differential binocular input caused by lustrous surfaces. This\nsuggests the idea that the Oppel\u00adHelmholtz account of lustrous appearances could get linked to the\nphenomenal observation that lustrous appearances, both for monocular and binocular viewing condi-\ntions, exhibit a similar kind of phenomenal segmentations into two different (shallow) depth layers.\nThis observation has been extensively reported and discussed in the classical literature on this topic.\nBixby (1928, p. 169) emphasised \"that the luster lies behind the surface and detached from it\"--\"luster\nis not a surface phenomenon; with the best luster, the surface of the stimulus-object is not seen.\" The\ndistinctive feature of lustrous appearances is that a perceptual grasp of an intrinsic surface quality is\nlocally precluded in favour of perceptual aspects of the perceived illumination. This feature serves,\nby mechanisms that are still poorly understood, as cue for a global surface attribute, namely lustrous\nmaterial appearances.\nFunctionalist computational accounts of lustrous appearances, such as the Oppel\u00adHelmholtz\naccount, are based on internal data types for surface-related perceptual categories and illumination-\nrelated perceptual categories. Because of this, they can, in principle, theoretically motivate a separate\nphenomenal attribute pertaining to an interaction property of these two types of computational objects.\nWithin a neural conflict account, in contrast, it appears entirely unmotivated why a local luminance-\nrelated neural conflict should give rise to a perceptual attribute such as lustre, and which kind of dif-\nferences in the structure of neural activities are mirrored in phenomenal differences and which are not.\nFurthermore, computational accounts are in principle suited to account for the fact that small varia-\ntions in image parameters can result in subtle but qualitatively different perceptual qualities of lustre,\nsuch as graphitic, metallic, satiny, pearly, silky, velvety, or vitreous. Such differences in perceptual\nqualities could, within computational frameworks, for instance be accounted for by differences in cue\nintegration mechanisms that regulate the computational segregation of internal surface and illumina-\ntion attributes.\nFigure 3. Highlight disparity and differential binocular luminance input. The figure is arranged for uncrossed\nviewing.\n6 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nHelmholtzian approaches more generally tend to focus on computations that are appropriate\nfor a recovery of functionally relevant physical world properties (e.g., by \"unconscious inferences,\"\nBayesian inferences). The abstract data types over which these internal computations are performed\nare assumed to mirror functionally relevant physical world categories (\"isomorphism\" of external and\ninternal categories). Such an assumption, however, is more problematic than it might appear from an\nordinary perspective. Ample empirical evidence indicates that internal data types (pertaining, e.g., to\nillumination, surface or shadow) do not match and are not isomorphic to external physical categories.\nHence, Helmholtzian approaches suffer from a \"type-mismatch\" problem (see, inter alia, Ludlow,\n2003, p. 150): Internal data types cannot be defined by external physical regularities nor can they\ninductively be derived from them or from the sensory input.\n\nExplanatory frameworks III: Lustrous appearances as reflecting internal principles\nsubserving the separation of accidental and essential attributes of surfaces\nHering's intention precisely was to avoid such a type-mismatch problem and to derive constraints\non data types from structural regularities of the percept and from investigations of internal causal\nanalyses by which functionally relevant perceptual categories are established. Thus, Hering-type\napproaches tend to focus on computations that are appropriate for yielding the semantic distinctions\nand functional achievements that are mirrored in phenomenal categories. The data types over which\nthese computations are performed are defined by certain functionally relevant classes of phenomenally\nexpressed perceptual categories.\nWhile Helmholtzian approaches capture an important physical aspect of the complex triggering\nconditions for lustrous appearances, they cannot, by themselves, account for a characteristic struc-\ntural aspect of the corresponding percept, namely its phenomenal depth segmentation. Hering (1879)\nclearly recognised how intimately colour and its attributes are interwoven with the internal organi-\nsation of perceptual space--what Katz later called \"marriage of colour and space.\" In line with his\ninternalist inclinations, Hering therefore placed his discussion of lustrous appearances entirely within\nhis discussion of the organisation of perceptual space. According to Hering (1879, p. 576), lustrous\nappearances arise as a consequence of a shallow perceptual depth segmentation of surface qualities\nby which \"essential\" and \"accidental\" brightness- and colour-related qualities of a surface are disen-\ntangled. Such a \"cleavage of sensation\" into shallow depth layers arises, according to Hering, when\na \"surplus of light\" is perceptually associated with the surface. Input situations, by which internally\ndefined permissible ranges for luminance-related parameter values for essential surface attributes\nwould be exceeded, give rise to a separate phenomenal surface attribute, namely lustre. The sensory\ninput pattern is, according to computational Hering-type approaches, internally sliced into perceptual\nlayers, which pertain to conceptual forms of different types, namely abstract data types for surfaces\nand their attributes, and data types for illuminations and their attributes. The specific interrelation of\nthese types of \"perceptual objects\" comprises surface attributes, such as lustre, that code relational\nsurface qualities with respect to interactions with light sources.\nAlthough Hering's account of lustrous appearances as part of the organisation of perceptual space\nremained highly sketchy, it draws attention to the crucial role of internal factors, notably the structure\nof internal data types and the types of internal causal analyses associated with them. The peculiar\ntriggering conditions for lustrous appearances that have been revealed so far by corresponding experi-\nmental investigations cannot be understood without taking these internal factors into account. Hering's\ninternalist perspective complements--rather than being in conflict with--the externalist one of Oppel\nand Helmholtz and offers fruitful heuristics regarding the structure of internal data types pertaining to\nsurfaces and their attributes.\nGoal of the present study\nThis study differentially subjects to experimental tests specific proposals pertaining to the first two\nexplanatory frameworks and aims at identifying triggering conditions that support Hering's conjec-\nture. The common ground for differentially testing the above-mentioned explanatory frameworks per-\ntains to lustrous appearances under binocular viewing conditions. We will accordingly confine our\ninvestigation to corresponding types of situations. (Note that, by assumption, none of these three\nframeworks can provide explanations for lustrous appearances in monocular viewing situations. Cor-\nresponding statements naturally apply to other perceptual attributes. In the case of depth, for instance,\nvivid depth impressions can be elicited in monocular viewing situations. Whereas in the case of depth,\na great variety of monocular input properties has been identified by which depth impressions can be\nLustrous material appearances 7\ntriggered, much less is currently known about the relevant monocular input properties by which lus-\ntrous appearances can be triggered.)\nFor binocular viewing conditions, all three types of accounts share the idea that situations in\nwhich the corresponding points in the two eyes receive different luminances are favourable for yield-\ning lustrous appearances. The accounts of Oppel\u00adHelmholtz and of Hering share the insight that any\nconsiderations of binocular luminance differences have to be based on a given internal data type for\nsurfaces. Accordingly, the requirement for lustrous appearances that \"each eye of an observer receives\ndifferent intensities or qualities of light\" (Beck, 1972) only makes sense with respect to the qualifica-\ntion that the two intensities are perceptually tied to the same locations of a given surface. On the basis\nof a corresponding assumption that a specific instance of an internal conceptual form for surface is\nactivated by these stimulus conditions, presumptions of alleged binocular conflicts remain theoreti-\ncally unmotivated. In the case of Helmholtz' display for stereoscopic lustre (Figure 1), the percept is\norganised in terms of solid perceptual objects. We can therefore assume that by this display, a common\nsurface representation for the two eyes is activated. In addition, Helmholtz tacitly takes advantage\nof another property: The two half-images exhibit a luminance contrast reversal with respect to the\nbackground. Such a contrast reversal is much stronger a condition than the occurrence of luminance\ndifferences between the two eyes that follows from Helmholtz considerations about physical regulari-\nties pertaining to lustrous surfaces. Contrast reversal with respect to a background turned out to be a\ncrucial requirement for lustrous appearances for the stimulus conditions employed by Anstis (2000).\nAnstis presented on five luminance levels of a grey surround test patches of six different luminances.\nHe presented pairs of light and dark test patches monocularly by alternating them over time at 16 Hz\nas well as binocularly by means of a stereoscope. Using a rating procedure, Anstis found that lus-\ntrous appearances only were elicited by pairs of test patches that straddled the surround luminance.\nIn his experiments, the appearance of lustre was strongest when a spatial increment in one eye and\na spatial decrement in the other eye are fused in the binocular condition or when a spatial increment\nis alternated with a spatial decrement in the monocular condition. From this, Anstis (2000, p. 2553)\nconcluded: \"Clearly it is the contrast reversal of the spot that makes it appear lustrous, in both the\nmonocular and binocular conditions.\"\nSince a reversal of contrast polarity of monocular inputs is neither required by the Oppel\u00ad\nHelmholtz-type nor by the Hering-type of explanatory account, our experiments on stereoscopic lustre\nwere specifically designed to investigate whether lustrous appearances indeed require the occurrence\nof spatial increment\u00addecrement pairings. The data from our Experiment 1 clearly show that a spatial\ncontrast reversal is not necessary for lustrous appearances, and constitutes more an ancillary type of\nvariable rather than a crucial one. By Experiments 2 and 3, we therefore attempted to identify, for our\nstereoscopic input configurations, the critical parameters on which lustrous appearances are based.\nIt turned out that lustrous appearances are tied to temporal phases of counter-modulation between\nthe two eyes. This is a novel constraint that is not directly ensued by the very general explanatory\nframeworks of Oppel\u00adHelmholtz and Hering. However, as we will point out in the discussion, it is\nconsonant with them and provides interesting insight into the kind of internal causal analysis by which\nthe visual system disentangles attributes of internal data types pertaining to surfaces and illumination,\nrespectively.\n2 Experiments\nIn order to identify relevant image parameters for lustrous appearances, we employed, in line with the\nexperimental studies mentioned above, highly reduced input configuration that do not contain cues\npertaining to texture or specular highlights, and that can be regarded as a kind of minimal stimulus (in\nan ethological sense) for eliciting lustrous appearances. In the static case, Helmholtz' peculiar stimu-\nlus configuration depicted in Figure 1 can be regarded as such a minimal stimulus configuration that\nis particularly suited for eliciting lustrous appearances. In contrast to Helmholtz, we are particularly\ninterested in dynamic aspects. The displays used in our experiments comprise two binocularly fused\nhalf-images, each consisting of a spatially homogeneous test patch whose luminance is temporally\nmodulated. Such stimulus configurations can, in the dynamic case, be regarded as a kind of minimal\nstimulus for eliciting lustrous appearances.\nThe two half-images of the centre-surround configurations were presented on a CRT monitor\n(with a refresh rate of 85 Hz). Observers haploscopically fused these pairs by means of a mirror ste-\nreoscope (Screen Scope SA200) to a single test patch seen in a homogeneous surround. The quadratic\ntest patches of both half-images had a side length of 8.6\u00b0 and were embedded in a common surround\n8 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nWhile the surround luminance was identical in the two half-images and kept temporally constant, the\nluminance of the centre patches was independently temporally modulated according to a continuous\nsingle-peaked modulation function (in the experiments reported here, a Gaussian was used).\nExperiment 1\nStimuli\nIn Experiment 1, the temporal intensity courses were temporally shifted between the two eyes by a\nconstant peak separation of 150 msec (Figure 4). The temporal intensity courses of the two test patches\nwere presented for 3,000 msec. The modulation function always peaked at approximately 1,425 msec\nfor the left eye, and at approximately 1,575 msec for the right eye (because of the refresh rate of the\nmonitor, the frames with the highest luminances occurred at time values that slightly differed from\nthese values; for simplicity, however, we will refer to the peaks of the continuous temporal intensity\nfunction).\nThe width of the temporal modulation functions (which in the case of the Gaussian can be defined\nby its standard deviation) was varied in steps of 20 msec from 100 to 400 msec. Three different sur-\nround luminances were employed, referred to as the \"black,\" \"grey\" and \"white\" surround condition\n(with a luminance of 0.1, 42.5 and 85 cd/m2, respectively). The luminance of the test patch ranged\nfrom 2.0 to 83.0 cd/m2, so that for the black (white, respectively) surround condition the fused pairs\nwere always spatial increments (decrements, respectively). This procedure furthermore had the advan-\ntage that at least in the \"black\" surround condition the test patch was always clearly discernible from\nits surround area.\nProcedure\nEach of the 48 stimulus combinations (16 widths of the temporal Gaussian modulation functions \u00d7 3\nsurround conditions) was repeated 15 times. The entire set of 720 stimuli was presented in random order.\nThe judgemental task of the observers was to indicate whether or not the respective stimulus appeared\n\"lustrous\" at any time during the presentation.After each cycle of stimulus presentation, the same stimu-\nlus was immediately started anew and the observers were allowed to view as many cycles as they wanted\nbefore making a judgement.After observers confirmed their decision by pressing a key, the next stimulus\nwas presented after a 3-sec period of dark adaptation.\nObservers\nFour observers took part in our experiments which were all well experienced with psychophysical\ntasks. All had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. One of them was an author of this paper.\nResults\nThe results of the experiment are shown in Figure 5. In each diagram, the relative frequency of per-\nceived lustre is represented in dependence of the width of the temporal Gaussian intensity functions.\nThe red lines indicate the fit of our data by a Gaussian psychometric function.\nFigure 4. Left: the two monocular temporal modulation functions that were generated according to a Gaussian\nfunction. The function that is shown as the left curve was presented to the left, the other one to the right eye of\nthe observer. The two Gaussians were temporally shifted with a peak separation of 150 msec. Right: The spatial\nlayout of our haploscopic centre-surround configurations and their appearance at time tx\n.\nLustrous material appearances 9\nAs the data of Figure 5 clearly indicate, the propensity to perceived lustre strongly depends on\nthe width of the temporal modulation functions, and hence on the speed of the temporal luminance\nchanges. For modulation functions with the smallest width (and thus the steepest slope), test patches\nwere almost always perceived as lustrous. The propensity to perceive lustre then monotonically\ndeclines with increasing width of the modulation function. The data also show that lustre is con-\nsistently perceived with respect to the black and to the white surround. Its presence thus does not,\ncontrary to Anstis' (2000) claim, depend on a contrast reversal of the luminances with respect to the\nbackground. However, the luminance of the surround has a strong effect on the propensity to perceive\nlustre. The smallest range of stimulus conditions for lustrous appearances is obtained for the black\nsurround, while the grey surround exhibited the largest range, the white surround being in-between.\nApparently, the occurrence of spatial increment\u00addecrement pairings between eyes in the \"grey\" sur-\nround condition increases the tolerance, with respect to lustrous appearances, for shallower gradients\nof the temporal modulation function. We will address the asymmetry between the black and the white\ncondition in the discussion of Experiment 3.\nWe want to briefly mention in passing that the qualitative results of Figure 5 do not depend on the\nparametric form of the modulation function. We obtained similar results with other types of modula-\ntion functions (such as a linear zigzag function according to which the luminance alternately increases\nand decreases by constant differences between a fixed minimum and maximum value). Interestingly,\nobservers furthermore reported subtle phenomenological differences associated with different types of\nthe modulations functions, linguistically described as sheen, metallic-silky, or metallic-satiny.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 was designed to specifically investigate whether there is a temporal segment of the bin-\nocularly combined temporal intensity functions that, if present in isolation, can elicit lustrous appear-\nFigure 5. For all four subjects (rows), the results are shown as psychometric functions, separately displayed for\nthe three surround conditions. Each diagram shows the relative frequencies by which the respective stimulus was\nperceived as lustrous (in dependence of the width of the Gaussian temporal intensity functions).\n10 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nances. The goal of Experiment 2 thus is to narrow down or to identify image parameters by which\nlustrous appearances can be triggered.\nStimuli and procedure\nThe spatial layout of the stimuli employed was the same as in Experiment 1. However, in contrast to\nthe previous experiment, observers did not view, on each trial, full cycles of the modulation functions.\nRather, they were shown short time windows of 300 msec duration of the underlying modulation func-\ntions (see Figure 6). The width of two underlying Gaussian modulation functions was kept constant\nat 150 msec, their peak separation at 200 msec. These parameter values proved to be particularly\nsuited for invoking strong impressions of lustre in previous experiments (Mausfeld & Wendt, 2006).\nThe intensity function for the left eye (red line in Figure 6) peaked at 1.9 sec, the one for the right eye\n(black line in Figure 6) at 2.1 sec.\nThe luminances of the modulation functions varied between 2.0 and 83.0 cd/m2. Each modulation\ncycle was 4 sec long. We systematically varied, within the entire 4 sec cycle, the temporal position of\nthe 300 msec time window during which the modulated test patch was visible to the observers. The\ncentre of the 300 msec window was varied between temporal locations of 1.55 sec (interval borders of\ntime window, the luminances of the two monocular test patches were set to the luminance of the base-\nline of the Gaussian modulation functions (2.0 cd/m2). The luminance of the surround was 0.1 cd/m2.\nEach of the 19 conditions was presented 10 times, yielding total of 190 trials which were presented in\nrandom order. As in Experiment 1, the task of the observers was to judge whether or not the respective\nstimulus appeared lustrous at any time during the presentation. After each cycle of 4 sec, the same\nstimulus was immediately presented again, and the observers were allowed to view as many cycles\nas they wanted before they made their decision. Before the presentation of the next stimulus, a 3-sec\nperiod of dark adaptation was presented.\nResults\nFigure 7 shows the results of the experiment for four subjects. Each data point represents the relative\nfrequency by which the respective stimulus was perceived as lustrous at any time during the presen-\ntation. The abscissa position of each data point represents the temporal mean of the 300 msec time\nwindow during which the respective part of the modulation functions was visible. One particular pres-\nentation window, extending from 1.85 to 2.15 sec within the virtual modulation cycle of 4 sec, is indi-\ncated by the shaded area in the centre of each panel. This time window centres around the intersection\nof the two-modulation curve at a time position of 2 sec. As can be seen from Figure 7, in this centre\npresentation window the propensity to perceive the test patch as lustrous is largest (almost 100% for all\nobservers). While presentation windows that are shifted up to positions 50 msec earlier or later than the\ncentre window elicit for three observers the same proportion of lustrous judgements, the appearance\nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the temporal modulation functions of the two monocular test patches. The\nred curve displays the modulation function for the left eye and the black curve for the right eye. The brightened\narea indicates one of the 300 msec time windows presented to the observers. Outside this time window (dark areas\nin the diagram), the test patches had a constant luminance of 2.0 cd/m2.\nLustrous material appearances 11\nof lustre sharply declines for earlier or later presentation windows. Some presentation windows in the\ninitial phase of cycle also elicit, depending on the observer, a smaller amount of lustre judgements.\nThe data of Figure 7 strongly suggest that, for our viewing conditions, the relevant image param-\neter for eliciting lustrous appearances is a temporal counter-modulation between the left-eye signal\nand the right-eye signal. That is, lustrous appearances are strongly tied to precisely that temporal\nsegment of the binocularly combined modulation functions in which one curve follows a temporally\ndecremental path, while the other follows an incremental one such that the two curves intersect. It can\nalso be inferred from Figure 7 that it is counter-modulation rather than the phases of largest differences\nbetween the luminances of the two-half images to which lustrous appearances are tied. We will address\nthe potential computational role of this counter-modulation in the discussion.\nThe results of this experiment would appear theoretically unmotivated within both the luminance-\nbased neural conflict framework and Oppel\u00adHelmholtz-type framework. It is important to note, how-\never, that the three types of theoretical perspectives discussed in the beginning provide frameworks\nonly and would have to be supplemented with strong additional assumptions in order to allow any\nquantitative prediction. For want of sufficiently strong and empirically warranted assumptions, we\nwill instead, for didactical purposes only, compare three simple mechanisms which can be related, in\ndifferent degrees of naturalness, to the three different frameworks. Figure 8 depicts in each column one\nof the three types of simple mechanisms each based on a proprietary type of response rule for yielding\nlustrous appearances. Mechanism A (left) is based on the interocular intensity difference, mechanism\nB (middle) on the interocular difference in the slope of the temporal intensity change, and mechanism\nC (right) on counter-modulation. The descriptive models based on these mechanisms are not to be\nregarded as explanatory models for lustrous appearances, as they do not refer to relevant functional\naspects or actual mechanisms of the visual system. Rather, they are only intended to illustrate a simple\ninput-output device that takes as input certain parameters of the temporal luminance profile and yields\nas output values for lustrous appearances. In order to yield quantitative predictions, input functions\nand response rules for the three mechanisms have to be specified.\nThe input is given by the stimuli described above (see Figure 6; hence the input functions are\nassumed to be continuous and free of noise). Let Im\nbe the 300 msec time interval with temporal mean\n(t) and fr\n(t) the temporal intensity function for the left and right\nFigure 7. The diagrams display the data of four subjects. Each data point (blue) represents the relative frequency\nby which the respective stimulus was perceived as lustrous. The position of the data points on the abscissa\nrepresents the temporal mean of the respective time window during which the monocular modulation functions\nwere visible to the observer. Diagrams also show the entire underlying modulation functions (red: left eye; black:\nright eye).\n12 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\neye, respectively. Correspondingly, let fl\n(t) and fr\n(t) denote the first derivative of the temporal inten-\nsity function for the left and right eye, respectively. The respective outputs of the three mechanisms\ncan then be defined by the following response rules (which, due to our restrictions on the input func-\ntion, can be formulated here in a highly simplified way).\nMechanism A (interocular intensity difference): Mechanism A assigns a lustrous appearance to the\nstimulus in time interval Im\nif there exists a time t within Im\nfor which the following condition holds:\n| fl\n(t) \u00ad fr\n(t)| > c (where c denotes a critical threshold value).\nMechanism B (interocular slope difference): Mechanism B assigns a lustrous appearance to the stimulus\nintimeintervalIm\nifthereexistsatimetwithinIm\nforwhichthefollowingconditionholds:|fl\n(t)\u00adfr\n(t)|>c\n(where c denotes a critical threshold value).\nMechanism C (counter-modulation): Mechanism C assigns a lustrous appearance to the stimulus in\ntime interval Im\nif there exists a time t within Im\nfor which the following two conditions hold:\n(i) sign (fl\n(t))  sign (fr\n(t)),\n(ii) fl\n(t) = fr\n(t).\nOn the basis of these response rules and specifications of threshold values, predictions can be derived\nwhether a stimulus, given by a certain time interval of the intensity modulation functions, is assigned\na lustrous appearance. These predictions can then be compared to the empirical data obtained by\nExperiment 2.\nWe will illustrate these predictions by example of two further specifications. Firstly, we will select\na stimulus defined by the input functions in the 300 msec interval with a temporal mean of 1.6 sec in\norder to exemplify the relation between the function for comparing left- and right-eye input underlying\neach mechanism (top row of Figure 8) and the predictions of that mechanism (bottom row). This inter-\nval is denoted by I1.6\nand marked by dashed vertical lines in the top row of Figure 8. The predictions for\nthis interval are indicated by a dashed vertical line at abscissa value 1.6 in the bottom row of Figure 8.\nSecondly, we will, in the case of mechanisms A and B, derive predictions for three different values for\nthe critical threshold c. These values, which are again chosen for illustration only, are denoted by c20\n,\n, and correspond, respectively, to 20%, 50% and 80% of the maximal value of the underlying\nparametric function for comparing left- and right-eye input (i.e. | fl\n(t) \u00ad fr\n(t)| in the case of mechanism\nA and | fl\n(t) \u00ad fr\n(t)| in the case of mechanism B). In the top row of Figure 8, these threshold values are\nrepresented by the green, yellow and red horizontal line, respectively.\nOn the basis of the response rules and the specification of threshold values, predictions can be\nmade regarding the time intervals that give rise to lustrous appearances. The bottom row of Figure 8\nshows these predictions for the three mechanisms (left: A, middle: B, right: C). Each data point (filled\ncircle) marks the response resulting from one of the 19 time intervals of 300 msec stimulation used\nin Experiment 2, where the position of the data point on the abscissa represents the temporal mean of\nFigure 8. Predictions for positive \"lustrous\" responses for three simple mechanisms: mechanism A (left, based\non the interocular intensity difference), mechanism B (middle, based on the interocular difference in the slope\nof the temporal intensity change), and mechanism C (right, based on counter-modulation). (See text for details.)\nLustrous material appearances 13\nthe respective time interval (points are connected by coloured lines for visual convenience only). For\nmechanisms A and B, each of the three threshold value depicted in the top row yields an associated\nresponse functions (coloured accordingly). To make these three response functions well distinguish-\nable visually, they have been slightly shifted vertically so that they do not locally coincide.\nNow we can exemplarily look at the predictions made for the 300 msec interval with a temporal\n). For the case of mechanism A (first column), the parametric function for com-\nparing left- and right-eye input (top row, black curve) exceeds, within this interval I1.6\n, the threshold\n(green line) and c50\n(yellow line), but not c80\n(red line). Therefore, the response for lustrous\nappearance (bottom row) plotted at time 1.6 sec is \"Yes\" for the green and yellow response function,\nbut \"No\" for the red one. In the case of mechanism B (second column), the parametric function for\ncomparing left- and right-eye input (black curve) exceeds, within I1.6\n, only the threshold value c20\n(green\nline) and therefore only the green response function (bottom row) represents a lustrous appearance\n(\"Yes\") at time 1.6 sec. Note that mechanism C (third column) predicts that no lustrous appearances\nare associated with time interval I1.6\n; rather, lustrous appearances are associated with any time interval\nthat includes the moment of counter-modulation at time 2.0 sec at which both response rule conditions\nare satisfied. This is the case for the seven time intervals with temporal means from 1.85 to 2.15 sec.\nBy comparing the experimental data of Figure 7 with the bottom row of Figure 8, it can be seen\nthat the empirical results of the four subjects in Experiment 2 conform best with the response function\nof mechanism C (based on counter-modulation). The response functions of mechanismA(based on the\ninterocular intensity difference) and of mechanism B (based on the interocular difference in the slope\nof the temporal intensity change) are substantially broader; these mechanisms predict lustrous appear-\nances also for early and late time intervals for which the subjects in Experiment 2 do not or only rarely\nreport lustrous appearances. This is the case even if a high (50%) or an implausibly extreme (80%)\nthreshold criterion is assumed. The comparative quantitative analysis on the basis of simple descrip-\ntive models for three types of mechanisms speaks in favour of the idea that, for our viewing situations,\ncounter-modulation is the relevant parameter for eliciting lustrous appearances.\nBy Experiment 2, counter-modulation has been identified, for our stimulus configurations, as a rel-\nevant input parameter for eliciting an impression of lustre. Counter-modulation refers to pairing a tem-\nporal increment in one eye with a temporal decrement in the other. This, however, leaves the modula-\ntion functions into which counter-modulations are embedded unspecified. In particular, the entrance\nand exit levels into which the counter-modulation phase is embedded are unspecified. In Experiment 2,\nthe counter-modulation phase was embedded into modulation curves that have their baselines at the\nlowest luminances. Accordingly, in each 300 msec presentation window (including those that contain\nthe counter-modulation segment), the temporal luminance changes of the test patches are incremental,\nwith respect to the modulation baseline, for both half-images. Now, almost the same course of coun-\nter-modulation could be obtained by two modulation curves that have their baselines at the highest\nluminances (see Figure 9). In that case, in each presentation window the luminance changes of the test\npatches would be decremental, with respect to the modulation baseline, for both half-images.\nExperiment 3 was designed to test whether counter-modulation by itself can be regarded as the\nrelevant input parameter for lustrous appearances, independently from the values of the levels, with\nrespect to which counter-modulations are defined. For this purpose, stimulus configurations were\ndesigned, in which exactly identical phases of counter-modulation are embedded into pairs of modula-\ntion functions whose baselines are systematically varied between lowest and highest luminances.\nStimuli\nWe used the same stimulus configurations as in the previous experiments. However, the 3,000 msec\nmodulation function of Experiment 3 (see Figure 10) was not simply a Gaussian function but rather\nconsisted of three segments. The inner 150 msec counter-modulation segment was kept identical for\nall modulation functions: For the left eye, it consisted of a linearly increasing modulation function\nwhich started at 25% and ended at 75% of the maximal available luminance of our monitor (85.0 cd/\nm2). For the right eye, it similarly consisted of a linearly decreasing modulation function which started\nat 75% and ended at 25% of the maximum luminance.\nThetwooutersegmentsofthemodulationfunctions,whichdefinetheentranceandexitlevel,respec-\ntively, consisted of constant modulation functions (of a temporal duration of approximately 800 msec).\nIn order to ensure a smooth modulation between the constant outer segments and the counter-mod-\n14 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nulation-segment, we had to interpolate the modulation function between the inner points of the two\nconstant outer segments and the entrance and exit points of the counter-modulation phase. In order to\nconnect these points, we used segments of 625 msec of that Gaussian function with a temporal width\nof 150 msec that yields an entire modulation function that is closest to a Gaussian function.\nWe omit the technical details for the specification of this function because the specific parametric\nform of this interpolation segment is, in the context of this experiment, theoretically arbitrary.\nIn our experiment, we employed 10 different luminance values for the entrance and exit levels,\nwhich ranged, in steps of 10%, between 5% and 95% of the maximum luminance of our monitor\n(85.0 cd/m2). Additionally, we used two different luminances for the surround of our stimuli, referred\nto as the \"black\" (0.1 cd/m2) and the \"white\" (85.0 cd/m2) surround condition.\nProcedure\nThe entire set of 200 stimuli, consisting of 10 replications for each of the 20 stimulus combinations\n(10 different baseline positions \u00d7 2 surround conditions), was presented in random order. The task of\nthe observers was to rate the amount to which the respective stimulus appeared \"lustrous\" at any time\nduring the presentation. The observers made their judgements by adjusting the length of a continuous\nhorizontally oriented bar presented below the centre patches such that its relative length indicated the\namount of perceived lustre. As in the first experiment, the same stimulus was immediately repeated\nFigure 9. The same course of counter-modulation can result from pairs of modulation functions that have their\nbaselines at the lowest or the highest luminances, respectively. For modulation functions with baseline at lowest\nluminances, the counter-modulation phase starts with an increment with respect to the baseline, for modulation\nfunctions with baseline at highest luminances, the counter-modulation phase starts with a decrement.\nFigure 10. Three examples of pairs of monocular temporal modulation functions as used in the experiment. The\nfigure displays three different levels for the entrance and exit luminances into which the counter-modulation phase\nis embedded. The middle phase of counter-modulation is exactly identical for all three levels. The continuous\nlines represent the modulation functions for the left eye, the dashed lines those for the right eye.\nLustrous material appearances 15\nafter each cycle of 3 sec, and the observers were allowed to view as many cycles as they wanted before\nmaking a judgement. After observers confirmed their decision by pressing a key, the next stimulus was\npresented after a 3-sec period of dark adaptation.\nObservers\nTwo observers took part in our experiments which were both highly experienced with psychophysical\ntasks. Both had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. One of them was an author of this paper.\nResults\nThe results of two subjects are shown in Figure 11, separately displayed for the two surround condi-\ntions. The relevant data--indicated as horizontal red bars--in these displays are the strengths of the\nlustrous appearance, in dependence of the luminance of the entrance/exit levels of the modulation\nfunctions. For convenience, these data are attached to the specific modulation functions by which they\nwere yielded.\nThe data of Experiment 3 show that, for identical phases of counter-modulation, there is a strong\ndependence between the intensity level of the baseline of the temporal modulation functions and the\ndegree of perceived lustre: The amount of perceived lustre decreases monotonically with the lumi-\nnance of the intensity level of the baseline. Note that there are four levels, namely, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55 and\n0.65, in which a temporal increment\u00addecrement pairing occurs outside the fixed-time window of the\ncounter-modulation. Interestingly, the amount of perceived lustre is quite poor, both for the black and\nfor the white surround.\nAccording to the data of Experiment 3, counter-modulation is only exploited as a cue for lustre\nin the context of a dynamic situation in which the initial luminance modulation is temporally incre-\nmental for both eyes (before entering the phase of counter-modulation). This asymmetry of the role of\ncounter-modulation with respect to a white and dark level into which it is embedded can be tentatively\nrelated to an ecological situation by which it could be causally generated, namely binocularly viewing\na rotating lustrous surface that is illuminated from a fixed direction (like a dynamical version of the\nsituation depicted in Figure 2). In such a situation, the specular part of the reflectance characteristics\nof a lustrous surface (which physically is in-between a diffuse matte and perfectly specular one) is\nFigure 11. For each of the two subjects (rows) and surround conditions (i.e. the \"black\" and \"white\" surround\ncondition, columns), the mean ratings are shown as horizontal red bars in dependence of the luminance levels\nof the entrance/exit phase of the modulation functions, which are also shown in the diagrams. Error bars refer to\n16 Mausfeld R, Wendt G, Golz J\nvisually effective with respect to an observer only for a small segment of the entire range of viewing\nangles. This specular part of the reflectance characteristics is incremental in luminance compared\nto the diffuse part that is visually effective for the remaining range of viewing angles. A continuous\nsequence of viewing angles would yield (when considering a small aperture within the field of vision)\na temporal pattern of binocular luminances with a short lightening-up with respect to a darker baseline\nvery similar to the modulation functions with dark entrance/exit levels for which the amount of per-\nceived lustre is highest in Experiment 3.\n3 Discussion\nThe perception of material qualities poses an important challenge for perception theory. Correspond-\ning phenomena are particularly suited for exposing the explanatory gap between the information avail-\nable in the sensory input, on the one hand, and the meaningful categories that characterise the output of\nthe perceptual system, on the other hand. They accordingly direct our theoretical focus to the kind of\ninternal structure that we have to assume in order to account for the explanatory gap. We are obviously\nendowed with a specific perceptual capacity by which we can visually attain aspects of perceptual\nobjects that pertain to their \"hidden\" dispositional powers and propensities. Due to this capacity, we\ncan visually grasp an abundant variety of properties of objects that go far beyond purely visual attrib-\nutes. The capacity to visually attain dispositional properties of objects is part of our more general per-\nceptual capacity for making causal assignments and for embedding all of our experiences into various\nkinds of internal causal analyses. The principles underlying the perception of material qualities will\nthus not only mirror physical regularities pertaining to surfaces and their relations with light. Rather,\nthey will as much be determined by the structure of the conceptual forms or abstract data types of the\nperceptual system, and by the types of causal analyses that are attached to each data type (see Maus-\nfeld, 2010a, for a more detailed account). In order to gain insights into the structure of the conceptual\nforms in which material appearances figure as an internal attribute, we have to identify the complex\ntriggering conditions by which they can be evoked. The more idiosyncratic with respect to external\nphysical regularities the triggering conditions turn out to be, the more likely will they shed some light\non the structure of the conceptual forms or abstract data types to which these attributes belong.\nBy our experiments, we wanted to assess the theoretical fruitfulness of the explanatory frame-\nworks mentioned in the introduction. To this end, we investigated, for the case of stereoscopic lustre,\ndiagnostically suitable input properties that are used by the visual system as a physical triggering basis\nfor eliciting the surface attribute of lustre. Our results show that--contrary toAnstis'(2000) findings--\nstereoscopic lustre cannot simply be accounted for by a binocular luminance conflict.\nFurthermore, our data also speak against a simple Helmholtzian type of explanation in terms of an\ninternalised physical regularity with respect to a differential binocular input. Although the type of trig-\ngering conditions that proved to be crucial in our experiments, viz. counter-modulation, is consonant\nwith the kind of physical considerations that underlie a Helmholtzian approach, it cannot be derived\nfrom it. Unless augmented by strong additional assumptions, a Helmholtzian approach does not suf-\nficiently constrain the kind of diagnostic triggering properties actually used by the visual system. It\ncannot explain or theoretically motivate the selection of precisely those physical invariants that yield\ncounter-modulation in certain viewing situations, from the infinitely many potential mathematical\ninvariants that can be associated with such situations. In contrast, within a Hering-type framework,\ncounter-modulations appear as a computational feature that is particularly suited for certain internal\ncausal analyses pertaining to the segregation of accidental and essential properties of surfaces.\nFrom a computational perspective, luminance changes that differ between the eyes in magnitude\nonly but have the same direction are, in situations as depicted in Figure 2, less useful as diagnostic\nproperties on which a segregation of accidental and essential attributes of surfaces can be based. If cor-\nresponding mechanisms would be based on such quantitative changes alone, they tend to be less robust\nand stable. In contrast, qualitative dynamic features, such as, in the case of counter-modulation, sign\nchanges provide more stable and reliable diagnostic properties for the corresponding computational\ntask. By taking advantage of the binocular counter-modulation of luminance, the visual system could,\nin suitable viewing situation, parse the input into two surface-related causal components, an accidental\nrelational surface quality pertaining to an interaction with a light source, and an essential property\npertaining to intrinsic surface attributes.\nThe physical triggering basis for lustrous appearances consists, in our situations, of structural\nfeatures of specific segments of the binocular temporal modulation curves. Interestingly, we can find\nLustrous material appearances 17\ninstructive similarities with respect to the auditory perception of material qualities. Corresponding\nexperiments (e.g., Klatzky, Pai, & Krotkov, 2000; Carello, Wagman, & Turvey, 2005) show that also\nin this domain relatively elementary features act as a triggering basis for assigning complex material\nproperties to the \"auditory objects\" involved (such as the attack portion of the signal for the perceived\nhardness of the objects, Freed, 1990). Because perceptual material qualities, both in the auditory and\nthe visual domain, are intrinsically transmodal in character, the perception of material qualities will\nlikely rest on deeper and more abstract computational principles, whose elucidation promises to shed\nmore theoretical light on core principles of perception.\nOur results call attention to the complex internal constraints underlying the visual system's\ncomputations. Perceptual psychology has predominantly focused on external constraints that can be\nderived from analyses of relevant physical regularities and has gained, from corresponding empirical\nand theoretical investigations, a wealth of interesting findings. Much less, by contrast, is known about\nthe internal constraints that result from the structural properties of the conceptual forms or abstract\ndata types on which any kind of information processing by definition is based and which determine\nthe conceptual apparatus and the semantic categories of the visual system. These data types cannot\nsimply be derived from \"corresponding\" physical categories. Their structure rather has to be identified\nby appropriate experimental investigations. Such investigations, however, are impeded by the na\u00efve\nrealist convictions that are deeply built-in into our commonsense conception of perception. Because\nof such convictions, we are inclined to identify input and output categories, and hence to erroneously\nuse categories of the output of the perceptual system for a description of its input. In fact, however,\nthe perceptual objects and their attributes that constitute the output of the perceptual system can only\nbe expressed by a logical language that is strictly more powerful than the logical language by which\nthe physico-geometric properties of the input can be expressed. Consequently, the internal structure\nunderlying perceptual organisation in terms of perceptual objects such as surfaces and their associated\nattributes, such as lustre, cannot be derived, by whatever kind of general inductive machinery, from\nthe sensory input. The structural form of the data types on which perceptual computations are based\ndoes not simply mirror and is not solely moulded by external physical regularities. Rather, the form of\ninternal data types is essentially co-determined by constraints that derive from internal functional and\ncomputational requirements (Mausfeld, 2010a, 2013). The conceptual forms or abstract data types of\nthe perceptual system must not only be adequate with respect to the external physical world (however\none understands such a requirement), they must also be computationally adequate in the sense that\nthey have to fit into the entire computational architecture of the perceptual system and subsequent\nsystems that take advantage of it. Not surprisingly then, internal data types for, say, surfaces and their\nproprietary attributes exhibit coding properties that appear idiosyncratic when solely viewed from\nconsiderations of external physical regularities. It therefore remains a core task of perception theory\nto better understand the internal data types by which perceptual objects, such as surfaces, and their\nattributes are coded.\n"
