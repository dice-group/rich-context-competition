By bringing together these instances of\nvicious and often fatal assaults, we explore what it is that prompts such extreme violence\nby ancient males towards their pregnant spouses. We contextualize the ancient sources in\nrelation to research by evolutionary psychologists into intimate partner violence in general,\nand into intimate partner violence during pregnancy in particular. We apply to the evidence\nunderstood as a systematic consequence of the evolved organization of the human male\nmind. These ancient depictions of uxoricide have been viewed by classical scholars as\ntypifying excess power in the hands of tyrants and gods. However, we argue that the\ndepictions in Greek literary culture are refractions of both historical and mythological\nexamples and are representative of men who fear a lack of power in their spousal\nrelationship and a lack of control over their partner's sexuality and reproductive resources.\nThe article contributes to the movement towards consilience between the sciences\nand humanities advocated by Carroll and others (Carroll, Gottschall, Johnson, and Kruger,\nUxoricide in pregnancy\n2012; Slingerland and Collard, 2012). It also contributes to the debates between the cultural\nstudies model of learned behavior and the evolutionary model of genetic adaptations\n(Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 1992; Gavey, 2005), and between the feminist turn away\nfrom the biologization of human behavior (Omitowoju, 2002, pp. 6\u00ad10) and the\nrebiologization of the same advocated by evolutionary psychologists (Hrdy, 1981, pp. 1\u00ad2).\nIt also forms part of a wider body of work, which is starting to break new ground in the\nstudy of the ancient world by exploring how the evidence matches cross-cultural behavioral\npatterns. Scholars in fields other than classics, including anthropology and psychology,\nhave considered ancient sources in elucidating evolutionary histories of monogamy and\nperspectives to demonstrate how access to greater reproductive opportunities underlies\npower battles in human history. More recently, classicists have begun to use evolutionary\npsychology to explain ancient texts, although the field remains informed by the cultural\ndeterminist premise that all significant features of a culture are products of culture-specific\ndates back to Franz Boas. Cairns argues instead that a combined evolutionary and cultural\napproach is needed to understand Homeric anger fully because there are points of overlap\nbetween all cultures \"formed and inhabited by a species which evolved its capacity for the\ncreation of culture under a broadly uniform set of environmental pressures\" (p. 12), while\nat the same time there are cultural differences in expectations about the appropriateness of\nthat the biological versus cultural antithesis is a false one.\nThis article also follows on from the work of Gottschall (2008) and McHardy\n(2008b) which explores why men are violent towards each other in ancient Greek literature.\nThey conclude that the intense competition over female reproductive resources is\nrepresented as central to the understanding of male-on-male violence in Greek literary\nsources. Both scholars argue that the acquisition of wealth, power and status gain their\nsignificance in the sources because they help to provide greater access to female\nreproductive resources. Scheidel's (2009) article on ancient imperial systems draws similar\nconclusions. By using evolutionary theory to analyze a wide range of ancient data, Scheidel\nargues that, in each empire, \"regardless of their marriage customs and constitutional\nproperties, the appropriation of resources facilitate reproductive success\" (p. 204).\nAll these scholars have demonstrated the centrality of female reproductive resources\nto males and the risks it is worth running to attain them, including fatal violence. What is it,\nthen, that motivates certain men, including ancient Greek men, to kill their own intimate\npartners when they are pregnant? The present article looks at representations of lethal male-\non-female violence in Greek literary sources in order to address this question. The\nexamples we consider are mythical and anecdotal ones reflecting male fears and anxieties\nthat grow out of the vital struggle over female reproductive resources.\nMaterials and Methods\nmade the case that, despite variation in levels of intimate partner violence across cultures,\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nand in its acceptability within different societies, there is considerable cross-cultural\nconsistency in purported motivating factors. The reason they cite for the male desire for\ncontrol over a sexual partner is related to perceived male-male competition for women. The\nresulting \"sexual proprietariness\" can generate spousal violence that is intended to\nconstrain female autonomy. Building on the work of Wilson and Daly, Goetz (2008)\nsuggests that the root of intimate partner violence is uncertainty over paternity (cf.\nBrownridge et al., 2011, p. 861). The fear of cuckoldry creates a perceived need on the part\nof a male partner to mount a fierce guard over his wife to ensure that she does not get\npregnant by another man (Burch and Gallup, 2004). This kind of mate guarding can be\nconceived of as paternity guarding as the men fear that the women are trying to trick them\nand are seeking to be unfaithful. It is possible that the male mind has come to be\nhypersensitive to cues of an intimate partner's sexual infidelity, causing some excessive\nreactions to slight suspicions of unfaithfulness because it is so costly to an individual to\nexpend his resources unknowingly raising another man's child (Goetz, 2008). In his\nanalysis of Australian homicide cases, Polk (1994, p. 33) notes a high number of cases in\nwhich men who killed their partners thought they had been unfaithful, whereas family\nmembers maintained that they had not.\nThose men who are particularly prone to sexual jealousy are more likely to act\nviolently, and pregnancy can be a time where feelings of sexual jealousy are exacerbated\n(Brownridge et al., 2011). Pregnancy can cause some men to question the fidelity of their\npartner and this fear about sexual fidelity can lead to an increased risk of intimate partner\nviolence (Bacchus, Mezey, and Bewley, 2006). Partner rape is more likely at times when a\nway in which men try to ensure the paternity of their partner's offspring. Wilson and Daly\n(1998) claim that women are sufficiently interested in extramarital sex to be willing to take\nrisks to evade even possessive mates in order to gain material and/or genetic benefits (cf.\nmotivate a substantial proportion of homicides everywhere. They estimate that these\nkillings could account for as many as half of all homicides. Case studies show that there is\nan increased risk of lethal violence when a woman threatens to leave or actually leaves her\nrelationship. The inability to accept the termination of a relationship is the most significant\nfactor leading to homicide between intimate partners in Polk's Australian cases (Polk,\nand Daly (1996) argue that male proprietorial behavior comes out of an aversion to\nwomen's efforts to leave marriages, as well as to the possibility of their infidelity. Jealous\nmen react strongly to any suggestion of sexual infidelity by their partners or to any attempts\nby the woman to assert control over the relationship (Goetz, 2008; Wilson and Daly, 1998).\nThese themes appear prominently in Polk's case studies of intimate homicide from\nWhile domestic violence is common even in societies that disapprove of violence\nagainst women, uxoricide is relatively rare. Scholars have debated whether uxoricide\ndenotes behavior that is adaptive or maladaptive (see Camilleri and Quinsey, 2012, p. 264\nfor an overview of the scholarship to date). Wilson et al. (1993) suggest that such killing is\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nan extreme by-product of proprietary views of women by men. Others have proposed an\nalternative hypothesis for such data. Killing an ex-partner could have functioned to exert\nfitness costs on rival males (Buss, 2005). Buss (2005) has also proposed that uxoricide\ncould function directly to remedy a reputation of being a cuckold. Such a label could lower\nmen's status by suggesting that he lacks the ability to keep a mate and fend off rivals. Thus\nmen might prefer to present a credible threat of violence to male rivals by demonstrating\ntheir violent potential (McHardy, 2008b, p. 48). They may also present such a threat to\ntheir women to try to control their sexual behavior. In these cases it may not be the\nintention of the men to kill their partners. Male desire to present a powerful and controlling\nfront may be exacerbated by rumors surrounding pregnancy. Polk (1994) has shown that\nwhere uxoricide happens, it fits a pattern similar to non-fatal violence against women and is\ngenerated by sexual jealousy and possessiveness.\nWe turn now to the ancient examples that we will be considering in relation to these\nevolutionary interpretations of male violence towards their pregnant partners. The seventh-\ncentury BCE Corinthian tyrant, Periander, is said to have killed his pregnant wife\n(Diogenes Laertius 1.7), as is the sixth-century BCE Persian Great King Cambyses (Hdt.\nWe treat all the evidence \u00ad which ranges from historiography and biography to\nmythological sources and the novel \u00ad together as manifestations of a wider behavioral\npattern which encompasses all discourses in ancient Greece, including fiction, myth and\nhistory. In this respect, we build on the emerging field of biopoetics or \"literary\nDarwinism\" which uses evolutionary psychology to frame discussions of such evidence as\nThe\ngod Zeus is depicted fatally attacking his mortal partner Semele while she is pregnant with\nhis son Dionysus (e.g., Philodemus De Pietae 60 Gomperz=Hes. fr. 346 MW; P. Oxy\nMetis, who was either his first wife or one of the extra-marital liaisons he embarked on\nduring his marriage to Hera (e.g., Hes. Th.. 886\u00ad900; Hes. fr. 343 MW; schol. bT on H. Il.\n8.39; Apollod. Bib. 1.20). Zeus is also depicted practicing partner abuse on Hera in the\nSynodinou, 1987), but not while she is pregnant. Another god, Apollo, is depicted killing\nhis partner Coronis while she is expecting his child in some sources, although others\nnarrate that his sister Artemis performed the deed for him (Hes. frs. 50, 59, 60 M-W; Pind.\nPind. Pyth. 3.52(b)). A mythological mortal, Amphitryon, is represented on some Italian\npots attempting to burn to death his pregnant wife, Alcmene. She is saved only by divine\nintervention, directed by her lover Zeus (LIMC, s.v. \"Alkmene,\" nos. 3\u00ad7. Burgess, 2001,\np. 219). In one of the surviving ancient Greek novels, Chariton's Callirhoe \u00ad possibly\ndating to the first century CE \u00ad Chaereas is depicted attacking his wife when she is in the\nvery early stages of pregnancy. Although he believes he has killed her, she only appears to\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nliterature, folktale, and art (e.g., Carroll et al., 2012; Gottschall and Wilson, 2005). We also\nbuild on the concept of the Greek \"imaginary\" as elaborated by Loraux (e.g., 1993), Kurke\n(1999) and others, which reads particular ways of communication as refractions of a wider\nset of cultural concerns. Thus we do not distinguish between, for instance, mythological\nsources and events with historical basis \"behind\" them, or between narratives centering on\ngods and those dealing with mortals. Greek gods are never simply humans writ large;\nrather, they provide vehicles for an exploration of power, control and violence (Schaps,\n2006) \u00ad as did tyrants in both literary and historical renditions of them. The myths that we\nexamine typify the depiction of ancient gods as, firstly, anthropopathic personages \u00ad that is,\nones prone to human feelings \u00ad and, secondly, as fantasy figures who exceed the\nlimitations of the human condition (Vernant, 1991).\nUxoricide is rare in ancient sources, and uxoricide in pregnancy is rarer still. There\nis very little evidence to indicate how frequent an occurrence uxoricide in pregnancy was.\nScholars have viewed it as a rare event and an extreme version of everyday domestic abuse\nthat existed in ancient society (Pomeroy, 2007; Schaps, 2006). Ancient legal evidence\nsuggests that husbands were expected to prosecute someone for attacking or hurting their\nhusband to act protectively towards his pregnant wife. A woman killed by her husband in\nsuch circumstances would need to rely on her natal kin, especially her father or brothers to\nprosecute (Pomeroy, 2007). However, rather than reading these few examples as evidence\nof a typical practice of ancient men, or as an indication of a lack of such practice among\nordinary men, we see the myths and anecdotes as reflecting male anxieties about female\npower over reproduction. In the examples we discuss, female sexual fidelity is shown to be\nsomething that even gods cannot control in myth and is believed to be a thing even tyrants\ncannot control in real life. The examples are few, but the recurrence of these stories\nthroughout antiquity shows the consistency of this preoccupation and fear \u00ad worries which\nevolutionary psychologists have shown to be present in other cultures and times.\nAs well as following in the footsteps of those who have applied evolutionary\npsychology to classical research, we are building on the work of classicists who have\nwritten previously on the topic of uxoricide in the ancient world. There have been two key\nfocuses in this work, both of which seek to explain the acts in relation to conditions specific\nto ancient culture. One focus has been on the tyrannical status and/or disposition of the\nperpetrators. In a brief survey of the historical instances where a pregnant wife is kicked to\n27\u00ad39), that the theme is a topos associated with tyrants, which is used to discredit those\nthe similarity between the story of Periander and the description of Chaereas' attack on\nCallirhoe in Chariton's novel and comments that Chaereas has thus been cast in the role of\n\"cruel tyrant\" (see also Hunter, 1994, p. 1080). He argues that Chariton intends the episode\nto illustrate the need to control one's passions and avoid such excessive levels of violence\n(Scourfield, 2003, p. 172). He further argues that the goddess Aphrodite is seen to censure\ndomestic violence in the novel. Scourfield stresses that violent rage and potentially lethal\nattacks on pregnant women are associated with men who display excessive passions and\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nemotions, especially anger and jealousy. These themes are also explored by Fantham\n(1986), who emphasizes the lack of accounts of jealous violence against wives in the\nsources, arguing that these attacks are more readily associated with lovers. She draws this\nconclusion by looking at a wide range of sources, but she does not discuss any of the\nexamples we raise here in her study. Burgess (2001, p. 219) also brings out the themes of\nsexual jealousy and anger in his scrutiny of a set of mythological examples in which a\npregnant woman is burnt to death by her partner, although without making the connection\nto domestic violence.\nA second line of argument that has been made previously concerning these\nexamples is that they spring from the patriarchal ideology of ancient Greek society.\nPomeroy (2007, p. 121) argues that the domestic violence depicted in the historical\nexamples was an excessive version of the everyday domestic violence which, she believes,\nwas typical of the treatment of women as part of a patriarchal society. Llewellyn-Jones\n(2011) examines how the form of patriarchal \"machismo\" society in which the Greeks\nlived is a basis for understanding levels of violence among ancient Greeks, including\ndomestic violence (cf. Fisher, 1998, p. 77). This argument is similar to the ones made by\nConnell (2005) and Edwards (2006) connecting domestic violence to patriarchy and\nnotions of masculinity. According to Llewellyn-Jones (2011, p. 241), \"Women are valuable\nas a means of demonstrating control and authority. A man is expected to instill respect or\nfear within the women for whom he is responsible in order to extract the socially required\ncompliance and correct behaviour.\" A comparable point is made by Schaps (2006) in a\ndiscussion of wife-beating in the Iliad. He suggests that Zeus threatens to dominate and\ncontrol Hera using his superior physical power if he does not feel he is winning an\nmythological examples, that the stories articulate male concerns surrounding female control\nover childbirth and whether any children born are his own. Burgess claims that these myths\nexpress patriarchal ideology (p. 215). Similar arguments have also been made concerning\nfathers who kill their pregnant daughters in classical literature (Glotz, 1904; McHardy,\nWe argue that, in addition to understanding these elements of power and control as\nemblematic of patriarchal or political dominance, they constitute typical, cross-cultural\ntendencies in men who are prone to intimate partner violence. We consider how far the\nmanifestations of power and control over women in the sources are related to male feelings\nof sexual jealousy and to the anxiety surrounding uncertainty over paternity, which causes\nthis jealousy. Thus, whereas Burgess (2001, p. 223) points to the significance of ancient\nGreek concerns about paternity in connection with Pericles' citizenship laws and suggests\nthe story-pattern reflects societal and cultural pressures on Greek men, our concern is with\nthe universal anxieties encoded in the myths which we read as manifestations of the vital\nmale struggle over women's reproductive resources.\nDiscussion\nAs we surveyed above, instances of tyrants killing their wives have been explained\nas symbolic of the tyrants' power and control in their own households, as well as in society.\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nThis reading is a valuable one that focuses on the excessive and destructive acts of the men.\nBy attacking their wives, they not only end the women's lives, but also the lives of their\nown unborn children. This theme is resonant of Greek tragic plots that focus on the self-\nCambyses' attack on his pregnant sister-wife emphasizes this self-destructive aspect to\nCambyses, who kills his brother, sister-wife and unborn child in a series of apparently\nparanoid and rash attacks. He is characterized as mad () and his acts are called\nevil ( ) by Herodotus because of the element of kin-killing in the story (3.31\u00ad\nUnderlying this representation is one that resonates with the descriptions of typical\nacts of intimate partner violence motivated by a desire to assert control. Cambyses is\ndepicted as angry () at the way his sister-wife challenges or disagrees with his\ndecisions. In one of the alternative accounts narrated by Herodotus of how she came to be\nkilled, she strips a lettuce bare and asks him whether he preferred it whole or stripped.\nWhen he replies \"whole,\" she asks why he stripped bare the house of his father Cyrus, the\nfounder of the Achaemenid Empire. In this version her criticism of Cambyses' decision to\nkill their brother, Smerdis, is overt and Cambyses is said to respond violently and\nimmediately. His anger spills out when he perceives she is challenging him, and he\nlaunches an attack on her that causes her to miscarry and die. A similar motive is ascribed\nto Nero in his attack on his pregnant wife Poppaea who criticizes him for returning home\nThis kind of angry attack following perceived criticism is a typical characteristic of\nintimate partner violence where a man reacts angrily to challenges to his control and\ndecision-making (Bacchus et al., 2006, p. 594). However, another aspect is hinted at in\nHerodotus' presentation of the tale, namely the incestuous nature of Cambyses'\nrelationship with his sister and his fears that his brother is trying to take control of what\nbelongs to him. In Herodotus' alternative version of how Cambyses came to attack his\nsister-wife, she cries over a puppy that helps its brother in a fight with a lion-cub and\nexplains that her tears are caused by sadness over the loss of her brother who has no one to\navenge him. In this version, Herodotus suggests that Cambyses acts out of anger both at his\nsister-wife's perceived criticism of the killing of Smerdis and at her feelings for their dead\nbrother. It is possible, then, to posit that Cambyses was thought to act out of feelings of\nsexual jealousy emanating out of how his sister-wife weeps for their brother.\nIn the comparable story of Periander as narrated by Diogenes Laertius, sexual\njealousy is evident as a motivating factor, although its significance has not been explored\nby previous commentators who have focused instead on the anecdote's similarity to the\nstory of Cambyses and allusion to the excesses of tyrants. Periander either throws a\nfootstool at his pregnant wife, Melissa, or kicks her because he had heard, and was ready to\nbelieve, stories of her infidelity (1.7): \"after some time, in a fit of anger, he killed his wife\nby throwing a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant (  \n       ) having been egged\non by the slanderous tales of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.\" In this story,\nsexual rivals of Melissa are credited with spreading stories about her which reach the ears\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nof her husband. While the author makes clear that he believes those stories to have been\nfalse, it is the fact of Melissa's pregnancy that generates the tales and Periander's\nsusceptibility to them.2\nThe characterization of Chaereas in Chariton's novel, which appears to owe\nsomething to the depiction of Periander in Diogenes Laertius, has been analyzed by\nscholars as reflecting the tyrannical aspects of his behavior (Hunter, 1994, p. 1080;\nScourfield, 2003, p. 171), but can also be seen to reflect the anger of a jealous young man\ntowards his beautiful young wife. The story shows explicitly how notions of sexual\njealousy and possessiveness lead to anger and violence against a pregnant spouse. The plot\nbegins when Chaereas wins the hand in marriage of Callirhoe, angering her other suitors.\nThe rival suitors determine to plot against Chaereas by arousing his jealousy (1.2.5\u00ad6).\nTheir first stratagem is to suggest that Callirhoe has been entertaining other men at a party\nin the marital house while her husband is away. When this plot does not work, they arrange\nfor a stranger to inform Chaereas that Callirhoe is being unfaithful. Chaereas is induced to\nlie to his wife and spy on her as a result of his suspicions. This kind of suspicious spying\nmatches the concept of \"mate guarding\" as outlined by Goetz (2008) and others. The fact\nthat Callirhoe is depicted as both young and exceptionally beautiful also matches\nobservations about the reactions of husbands of the most attractive wives (Goetz, 2008, p.\n262). When Chaereas sees a man who is part of the plot enter the house, he believes the\nrumors must be true and rushes in to confront him (1.4.10). In this example, it is made clear\nthat Chaereas is all too ready to believe suggestions of his wife's infidelity even when\npassed on by a stranger. His angry reaction is impulsive, and he rushes to attack his alleged\nlove rival. When he does not find the man in the house, he rushes in on Callirhoe and\nPeriander acts out of anger and jealousy when he attacks his wife,\nbut at the same time it is possible to understand that he is ready to attack her while she is\npregnant because of doubts concerning the paternity of her child. According to this reading,\nthis tale coheres closely to the observations made by Goetz (2008) and Polk (1994) that a\ncontrolling husband might be hypersensitive to suggestions of infidelity by his wife and\nvery ready to believe such accusations, especially when she is pregnant.\n[Chaereas] could find no voice with which to reproach [Callirhoe]; but overcome by\nanger, he kicked at her (     ) as she ran\nforward. His foot struck the girl squarely in the diaphragm and stopped her breath.\nShe collapsed, and her maidservants, picking her up, laid her on the bed. Thus\nCallirhoe lay without speech or breath, presenting to all an appearance of death.\n(Trans. Reardon).\nChaereas' fears of infidelity cause him to lash out in a jealous rage kicking his\npregnant wife in the abdomen. This example contains the most explicit description of a\nkick that targets the stomach or genital area of the woman accused of sexual infidelity. In\n2 In Hdt. 3.50 Periander is also said to kill Melissa, but there is no mention of her being pregnant. Herodotus'\nversion does emphasise Periander's desire to control his family members and his angry, violent behavior\ntowards them.\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nrecent studies, women who have experienced violence during pregnancy emphasize how\ntheir partners frequently target these areas (Bacchus et al., 2006, p. 592). It seems these\nparts of the anatomy hold a particular significance for a man who believes he has been\ncuckolded, and his attack may target the unborn child as much as the woman. Although\nChaereas is not yet aware that his wife is pregnant, he is being characterized in adherence\nto the pattern where males connect their intimate partner's alleged sexual infidelity with a\npossible pregnancy. After the event, Chaereas continues to seethe and shows no hint of\nregret until the truth is revealed (Scourfield, 2003, p. 164). The notion that such violence is\nacceptable against a woman who has been unfaithful is apparent in Chaereas' attitude. This\nkind of opinion is typical of sexually proprietary men who consider themselves to be within\ntheir rights to punish or kill \"their\" women. Men who have just killed their partners out of\nThe story of Chaereas and Callirhoe indicates the triggers for violence even in a\nromantic relationship. Chaereas' jealous reaction is anticipated by those who plot against\nhim as a natural reaction of a young man recently married to a beautiful, young girl. Sexual\njealousy is also given by the narrator as a possible mitigating factor that Chaereas could\nhave used at his trial for homicide (1.5.4\u00ad6.1). The themes that appear in this narrative are\nuniversal ones, which match the modern case studies of intimate partner violence and\nuxoricide. Polk's observation (1994, p. 32) that: \"fuelled by a jealous rage, delusions can\nbuild in the minds of these men tormented by the thought of their lovers moving out of\ntheir control and into the arms of another man\" fits well to this story. The episode\nhighlights the potential for angry violence inflicted by a husband who believes he has been\ncuckolded. Apparent, too, are his desire to control the behavior of his wife; his sexual\njealousy and possessiveness; his willingness to believe rumors about his wife's infidelity;\nand his brutal assault upon her without waiting to hear her account of what had happened.\nThe myth of Apollo and Coronis, who is blasted to death after an act of sexual\ninfidelity, along with those around her in one of the sources (Pind. Pyth. 3.35\u00ad37), shares\nsome of the same themes of anger, jealousy and sexual proprietariness that are apparent in\nthe stories of Periander and Chaereas. In addition, the theme of male violence and\npossessiveness that arises where a woman attempts to leave her partner is a significant part\nof this story. Burton (1962, p. 83) claims that Coronis' transgression was that she had sex\nwith a mortal while pregnant by a god. It is our contention that Apollo is responding not\nonly as an offended deity, but also as a cuckolded partner. There are several variants of the\nstory, but in all of them, Coronis' decision to move on to a relationship with Ischys while\npregnant by Apollo is a constant feature. Apollo is shown expressing sexual proprietariness\ntowards Coronis by watching over her while he is away from home. In Pindar's version,\nApollo keeps watch on her himself, far away though he is, and observes her with another\nman (Pyth. 3.25\u00ad26): \"For she lay in the bed of a stranger who came from Arcadia, but she\ndid not elude the watcher.\" Alternatively, while the wedding feast is being celebrated, the\ncrow brings the news of the \"secret deeds\" committed in Apollo's absence, whereby\n\"Ischys had married Coronis...the daughter of god-born Phlegyas\" (Hes. fr. 60 MW). In\nHyginus' account, Apollo sets a crow to guard his pregnant partner (Fab. 202): \"When\nApollo had made Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas, pregnant, he put a crow in guard, so that\nno one should violate her.\" By instructing the crow to watch over Coronis, Apollo makes\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nan attempt at mate-guarding, albeit not to guard the paternity of the child, but to control the\nsexuality of his partner.\nApollo is depicted reacting angrily to Coronis' betrayal, either sending his sister,\nproper remorse in Ovid's Metamorphoses, as discussed by Fulkerson (2006), matches the\nlack of remorse expressed by many of the men who killed their intimate partners in the\nAustralian cases discussed by Polk (1994, pp. 33\u00ad34). The killing of Coronis illustrates\nhow uxoricide can occur when the male desire to control his partner is so great that he\nwould rather that she die than be allowed to go to another man (cf. pp. 28\u00ad29). This kind of\nthinking is well illustrated by the phrase \"if I can't have you, no one will...\" as cited in one\nof Polk's cases (p. 29). There are close connections between the killing of Coronis and a\nvariant of the killing of Semele \u00ad or Thyone as Pindar calls her (Currie, 2005, p. 361;\ncommon theme of sexual jealousy leading to punishment by death in the two stories.\nIn the most familiar version of the myth of Semele, Semele dies after Hera tricks\nher into requesting that Zeus appears to her in his \"pure\" form \u00ad the thunderbolt \u00ad which\nSemele could not endure and so she was blasted to death. In the, seemingly earlier, variant,\nit appears that Zeus came to kill his pregnant partner because she had entered into a new\nrelationship, with her sister Autonoe's son, Actaeon. A papyrus summary of mythological\nmetamorphoses summarizes the transformation of Actaeon into a stag by Artemis as\nrecounted in the Ehoeae, an epic poem, surviving in fragments and attributed to the epic\nAristaeus and Autonoe, wanting marriage with Semele, ... his mother's father .... was\nchanged into the form of a stag by the design of Artemis, and was torn apart by his own\ndogs.\" (Trans. Renner). The transformation occurs, then, not because Actaeon saw the\nthat he was a superior hunter to Artemis (e.g., Eur. Bacch. 337\u00ad340), but because Artemis\nis being used to get rid of a rival of Zeus (P. Oxy. 2509, on which see Janko, 1984).\nAccording to Acusilaus of Argos, Zeus had Actaeon killed for pursuing Semele (2F33 at\nApollod. Bib. 3.4.4). This appears to have been the key, and perhaps the only, explanation\n86\u00ad87). The accusation by Semele's sisters that she died because of an illicit sexual act\n(Eur. Bacch. 26\u00ad31; cf. Apollod. Bib. 3.4.3), might be denoting the alternative explanation\nfor her death at Zeus' hands. A fragment of Aeschylus' Semele identifies Actaeon as a\ncompetitor who was killed by Zeus (fr. 359 Mette). According to Stesichorus, Artemis\ndisguised Actaeon as a stag to get his dogs to eat him \"in order that he would not take\nSemele as wife\" (fr. 236 Page, at Paus. 9.2.3). In a fragment of Aeschylus' Toxotides,\nActaeon says, indicating perhaps Semele (fr. 243 Radt): \"the blazing gaze of a young girl\ndoes not escape me, if she has tasted of a man: for such I have an experienced eye.\" (Trans.\nGantz). The possibility that Zeus killed Semele for this reason could explain why, on a\nhydria from the late fifth or early fourth century BCE by the Semele Painter, the\nIt would also explain a series of vase-paintings where Zeus is making ready to hurl the\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nthunderbolt at a fleeing woman who might be Semele. For example, one side of a red-\nfigured Nolan neck-amphora of c. 480\u00ad470 by the Berlin Painter shows Zeus wielding the\nthunderbolt (London BM E313). On the other side of the vase, a woman, perhaps Semele\n(Gantz, 1993, p. 477), is looking back at Zeus with her left hand raised, presumably in\nsupplication.\nIn the case of Semele, as in the case of Coronis, the unborn infant is rescued by its\ndivine father from the ensuing blaze in which the mortal woman dies. A mortal\nmythological male, Amphitryon, threatens to engulf his wife in a comparable blaze,\nprompted by feelings of sexual jealousy and possessiveness. In this case, though, unlike the\nexamples of Coronis and Semele, questions of paternity are central to his angry response.\nAmphitryon returns home from exile having avenged the murder of his wife's brothers and\nhaving thus met the conditions that she imposed on him before she would allow him\nconjugal rights (e.g., Ps. Apollod. 2.4.6\u00ad8; Diod. Sic. 4.9; Hyg. Fab. 29). Before his return,\nhowever, Zeus had slept with Alcmene disguised as Amphitryon. In a sense Alcmene has,\nin fact, been deflowered by Zeus because when Zeus takes on a particular form, to a degree\nthat form is the god, as is suggested above all by the example of Leda, who lays an egg\nafter encountering Zeus the form of a swan (e.g., Paus. 3.16.1). As the product of the union\nof Zeus-as-Amphitryon and Alcmene, Heracles, is the child of Zeus, but also the child of\nAmphitryon. On discovering that his wife has been impregnated in his own form but not\nthrough his own act, Amphitryon tries to kill her. When she takes refuge at an altar, he tries\nto turn the altar into her funeral pyre by setting light to it, aided by Antenor. A Paestan red-\nshows Amphitryon and Antenor, both named, setting fire to the altar. Alcmene's raised\nhand either indicates her attempt at supplication, or signals her appeal to Zeus, who looks\ndown from above. The attempted uxoricide fails because Zeus intervenes, both directly, by\nhurling down thunderbolts (shown under the pyre), and by getting the Hyades to pour rain\non the pyre, and so ensuring the survival of Alcmene. Amphitryon's attempted uxoricide is\ndepicted similarly on several other South Italian vase paintings where Zeus and his agents\nare frustrating the attempts by Amphitryon and Antenor to light a fire around the altar at\nwhich Alcmene has taken refuge (LIMC, s.v. \"Alkmene,\" nos. 3\u00ad7; see Burgess, 2001, p.\n219). As we have seen, where Zeus himself is the cuckolded partner, rather than \u00ad as here \u00ad\nthe adulterer, he performs the act attempted by Amphitryon, of burning his unfaithful\npartner to death.\nThis example makes clear the connection discussed earlier between the concern\nabout unfaithful partners becoming pregnant by other men and angry, violent responses\nwhich threaten to kill both woman and child. The choice of burning, which appears in these\nstories, symbolizes destructive vengeance of a man against his partner (cf. Gantz, 1977).\nThe theme has a possible parallel in the cases discussed by Polk where men threaten to\nburn their partners alive by setting the house on fire (Polk, 1994). The concept of\ndestroying the household root and branch is evoked by this image of the threat to burn\ndown the house with all the family in it (cf. Connor, 1985).\nZeus does not kill Metis as such but he comes as close as a god might to a fellow\ndeity's murder when he swallows her, and terminates her independent existence (Hes. Th.):\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nZeus, king of the gods, made Metis his wife first, she who knows most things\namong gods and mortal men, but when she was about to bear the goddess gleaming-\neyed Athena, Zeus craftily deceived her with cunning words and put her down in\nhis own belly, as Gaia and starry Ouranos advised. They advised him thus so that no\nother should hold royal honor over the eternal gods in place of Zeus, for it was\ndecreed that resourceful children would be born of her, first the daughter, gleaming-\neyed Tritogeneia, equal to her father in fierceness and shrewdness, but afterwards\nshe was to bear a son, the king of gods and men who possessed an overbearing\nheart. But Zeus beforehand put her down into his own belly, so that the goddess\nmight warn him about both good and evil. (pp. 886-900; Trans. Deacy)\nPrevious scholars have read this swallowing of Metis in a variety of ways, including\nas emblematic of the patriarchal oppression of women (e.g., Doherty, 1995, pp. 1\u00ad8); as a\nstory about how Zeus consolidates his power by transforming himself from one divine\nplayer among many in a volatile system into the ruler who has all the aces (Detienne and\nof the children of the marriage by swallowing Metis to prevent her from giving birth to a\nfurther dimension by exploring how Zeus' attack on Metis matches, on a fantastic level, the\nuxoricidic violence that men perform when their control is threatened. The story typifies\nthe mythological interplay between gods as susceptible to human emotions, and as fantasy\nfigures who surpass human limitations (Vernant, 1991). Zeus' quest to control his family\nmembers, which elsewhere includes threatened or actual violence (See, e.g., Il. 1.560\u00ad589;\nto a further degree here. When his control is threatened by his first wife and her unborn\noffspring, he takes violent measures to establish the control suited to his position as head of\nthe family (and in his case head of the entire kosmos).\nAdopting such a perspective on Zeus's swallowing of Metis might explain why, in\nan alternative theogonic account, possibly contemporary with Hesiod's (Yasumura, 2011,\np. 86), after Zeus has had sex with Metis, he immediately seizes her and forces her inside\nhis body (Hes. fr. 343.7, 9\u00ad10 MW), either in an attempt to ensure that she will not\nconceive his child, or in order to determine that the child ultimately born will appear to be\nhis monogenic offspring. In either scenario, his act is an extreme instance of what\nperpetrators of partner-abuse seek, namely control over the reproductive resources of their\npartner.\nIn an alternative account of the circumstances surrounding the swallowing of Metis,\nZeus takes a uxoricidic measure to assume, or at least share, the paternity of Athena. In this\nversion, Metis was not pregnant by Zeus, but by the Cyclops Brontes (\"Thunder\"):\nZeus swallowed down Metis, the daughter of Oceanos, who changed her shape to\nmany things, because he wanted to have her inside himself when she was pregnant\nby Brontes the Cyclops. And when the child was brought to perfection, Zeus gave\nbirth out of his head and gave her to the river Triton to rear her. Thus she is called\nTritogeneia, because she has been enhanced by these three: Brontes, Zeus and\nTriton (Schol. bT ad Hom Il. 8.39. Trans. Deacy).\nUxoricide in pregnancy\nIt is not clear in the short description by the Homeric scholiast, whether or not Zeus was\nalready married to Metis. If we are to understand the pair as husband and wife, the action\nagainst Metis represents a violent reaction by Zeus against sexual infidelity which is\ncomparable to the examples discussed previously. Alternatively, Zeus is seeking to turn the\noffspring of the union of two dangerous powers of violence and cunning into his self-born\nchild by burying the pregnant mother inside his own body and subsequently bearing the\nchild out of this body. However, this attempt to control the reproductive resources of Metis\nby supplanting them fails insofar as he fails to become the sole paternal figure who\ncontributes to the formation of Athena, instead sharing this role with both Brontes, and a\nthird figure, Triton, who is both the personification of the river beside which the goddess is\nborn, and the individual who rears her. Athena, who is elsewhere described in ancient\nsources as deriving her identity from her status as the self-born daughter of Zeus (Deacy,\n2008, pp. 17\u00ad32), is here the product of three father-figures. For all that Zeus is immortal,\nin his role as quintessential patriarch and the model of the tyrant, he displays the same\nconcern over control in his relationships that men exhibit in classical myth and in modern\ncase studies.\nConclusions\nPrevious classical research has sought to explain uxoricide in pregnancy in relation\nto culturally-specific concepts of tyrannical abuse and patriarchy. We have shown that, to\nsupplement this work, the evidence needs to be interpreted as one particular culture's\nresponse to a transcultural behavioral phenomenon. We have demonstrated how\ncomparable impulses to those exhibited in modern examples can be detected in the ancient\nsources, including desire for control, sexual proprietariness, mate guarding, uncertainty\nover paternity, and paternity guarding. We have shown how the ancient evidence\nexemplifies universal male anxiety over the control of reproductive resources, and matches\nthe uxoricidic anger that can be experienced by men from modern case studies whose\ncontrol is threatened. The impulses that drive men in the ancient Greek sources are,\ntherefore, analogous with evolutionary impulses that produce violent behavior both cross-\nculturally and transhistorically. Our study shows the potential for evolutionary psychology\nto open new possibilities for research into ancient Greek spousal relationships and male\nfears concerning their partner's reproductive resources. It also shows how classicists can\nparticipate in the development of evolutionary theory through the accumulation of evidence\nand the consideration of strategies for its interpretation.\n"
