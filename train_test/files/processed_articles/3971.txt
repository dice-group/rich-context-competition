Here, we investigated the effects of nuclear factor of activated T-cells\ninhibition on plaque burden in a novel mouse model of type 2 diabetes that better replicates human disease.\nMethods & Results: IGF-II/LDLR\u00ad/\u00adApoB100/100 mice were generated by crossbreeding low-density lipoprotein receptor\u00ad\ndeficient mice that synthesize only apolipoprotein B100 (LDLR\u00ad/\u00adApoB100/100) with transgenic mice overexpressing\ninsulin-like growth factor-II in pancreatic  cells. Mice have mild hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia and develop\ncomplex atherosclerotic lesions. In vivo treatment with the nuclear factor of activated T-cells blocker A-285222 for\nweeks reduced atherosclerotic plaque area and degree of stenosis in the brachiocephalic artery of IGF-II/LDLR\u00ad/\u00ad\nApoB100/100 mice, as assessed non-invasively using ultrasound biomicroscopy prior and after treatment, and histologically\nafter termination. Treatment had no impact on plaque composition (i.e. muscle, collagen, macrophages). The reduced\nplaque area could not be explained by effects of A-285222 on plasma glucose, insulin or lipids. Inhibition of nuclear factor\nof activated T-cells was associated with increased expression of atheroprotective NOX4 and of the anti-oxidant enzyme\ncatalase in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells.\nConclusion: Targeting the nuclear factor of activated T-cells signalling pathway may be an attractive approach for the\ntreatment of diabetic macrovascular complications.\n",

This may not\nonly be due to limited plaque progression but also due to\nplaque regression, as evidenced in the ultrasound biomi-\ncroscopy experiments by smaller plaque size after treat-\nsame mice before treatment. These findings are in line\nwith previous work from our laboratory showing abroga-\ntion of diabetes-induced aggravation of atherosclerosis in\nthe aortic arch of STZ-induced diabetic ApoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice. This\nstudy goes beyond a toxin-induced type 1 diabetes model\nand supports a role for NFAT in the development of athero-\nsclerosis in the context of type 2 diabetes and in an animal\nmodel that better replicates human disease than the STZ\nmodel.\nExperimental models of atherosclerosis and diabetes are\nvery susceptible to the housing environment, often translating\ninto differences in the severity of the disease phenotype (i.e.\natherosclerotic plaque size, degree of hyperglycaemia) when\nthe same strain is studied in different animal facilities.18 This\nissue adds to the complexity of using animal models in medi-\ncal research, potentially having an impact on study results and\ntheir interpretation, and to some extent, contributing to the\npoor translation of preclinical in vivo results into successful\nclinical trials and higher approval rates of new drug candi-\ndates. Among other explanations for this limited translational\nvalue [e.g. shortcomings in the design of clinical trials, over-\noptimistic conclusions from methodologically flawed animal\nstudies, animal models that do not reflect human disease\n(reviewed in Van der Worp et al.26)] is the fact that validation\nstudies are not traditionally conducted in the animal experi-\nmental field (when it is an absolute requirement for all other\nsteps leading to the establishment of new therapies). A\nstrength of this study is that the inhibitory effect of the NFAT\nblocker on atherosclerosis was replicated in two independent\nmice cohorts undergoing the same experimental protocol at\ndifferent animal facilities.\nPlaque size is the preferred primary readout in animal\nmodels and is typically determined histologically at the\nend of the experiments. Advances in ultrasound techniques\nhave made possible the measurement of plaque progres-\nsion/regression non-invasively in rodents, allowing for\nlongitudinal studies which help reduce the number of ani-\nmals required for statistical power. At termination, com-\nplementary evaluations of plaque area have shown good\ncorrelation between the histological and the non-invasive\nmeasurements in the brachiocephalic artery, the aorta and\ncarotid arteries.22,27 Here, we also found a good correlation\nbetween the two techniques in the brachiocephalic arteries\nof young mice but were not able to dissect the histological\ndifference in plaque size observed in the old female mice\n(Figure 5), probably because the effect size of the NFAT\nblocker was smaller in older mice than in younger mice\nand due to lower number of mice in the older cohort.\nNevertheless, ultrasound biomicroscopy should be consid-\nered as an attractive non-invasive method to assess the\neffects of interventions in rodents.\nIn the ApoE-deficient mouse, it is well established that\natherosclerotic lesions progress with age through all\nphases of atherogenesis, from monocyte adhesion, then\nlipid deposition and formation of fatty streaks to more\nmature and fibrous plaques;28,29 and that the pace at which\nthis happens can vary depending on the vascular segment\n(e.g. more advanced lesions in the aortic root vs the\naortic arch;10 slowest progressing lesions in the coronary\narteries29). Our previous work highlighted differential\nsusceptibility to STZ-induced atherosclerosis depending\non the age of the lesions, with more pronounced effects\nof hyperglycaemia on plaque size in early stage lesions,\nsuch as those in the aortic arch, when compared to the\neffects on more advanced plaques such as those in the\naortic root.10 In line with NFAT being activated by hyper-\nglycaemia as we previously established,4,5 the effects of\nthan on the aortic root of STZ-diabetic ApoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice,\nstressing the need for a diabetes-driven process for NFAT-\ninhibition to play a role.10 Here, we found in the IGF-II/\nand severity of the lesions progress with age,19 a clear\nest effects of NFAT-inhibition in the older mice (Figure 1\nvs 5). Young mice exhibited more dynamic lesions char-\nacterized by an active inflammatory process with higher\ndegree of macrophage infiltration than old mice (Figure\n5(e) and (f)). It is possible that the reduction in plaque\nsize observed after inhibition of NFAT signalling could\nbe, at least in part, driven by reduced inflammation. Even\nthough the proportion of the plaque occupied by mac-\n2(d)), the reduction in plaque size observed in the males\ninevitably translated into reduced total macrophage con-\nhave elevated fasting blood glucose levels in line with\nonly moderate non-fasting hyperglycaemia compared to\nthe values originally reported when the model was gener-\nated (~16mmol/L)19. This discrepancy could be attributed\nto genetic drift, which should not be neglected even in\ninbred strains. The combination of impaired glucose toler-\nance and impaired fasting glucose31 makes the IGF-II/\ntes, a condition associated with higher risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In previous\nwork, we showed a clear dose-dependency of glucose-\ninduced NFAT transcriptional activity, with modest eleva-\ntions of a few mmol/L of extracellular glucose being\nsufficient for significant NFATc3 activation in the arterial\nwall.5 In light of this dose-dependency and the need of a\nhyperglycaemia-driven process to occur for NFAT-\ninhibition to have effects, it was reasonable to find that the\ninhibitory effect on the expression of inflammatory mark-\ners in the aorta of STZ-diabetic ApoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice (a model\ncharacterized by profound hyperglycaemia) than of\nglycaemic phenotype.\nNOX4 has recently been shown to protect against\nendothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in LDLR defi-\ncient mice.32 It was suggested that hydrogen peroxide\nderived from NOX4 acted via pAKT1 phosphorylation on\neNOS activation. Here, we showed that inhibition of NFAT\nsignalling in VSMCs exposed to a strong oxidative stress\nenvironment, significantly increased NOX4 expression\n(Figure 4(a)). The cell experiments also suggest that the\nobserved upregulation of NOX4 expression in the aorta of\ndirect effects of the NFAT blocker on the vascular cells. A\nsimilar NFAT-dependent regulation of NOX4 has been\ndemonstrated in immortalized human podocytes stimu-\nlated with insulin using three complementary approaches\nto inhibit NFAT-signalling (tacrolimus, cyclosporine A and\nVIVIT peptide).33 Using another inducer of oxidative\nstress (SIN-1), we also found that inhibition of NFAT sig-\nnalling resulted in enhanced catalase expression in VSMCs\n(Figure 4(b)).\nThis study shows that inhibition of NFAT signalling in\ngression of atherosclerosis but, more importantly, it leads\nto atherosclerosis plaque regression. The effects are not\ndue to changes in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid levels\nbut may be attributed to reduced inflammatory burden and\nimproved anti-oxidant defences such as NOX4 and cata-\nlase. Vascular NFAT may be considered as a novel thera-\npeutic target for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular\ncomplications.\n"
