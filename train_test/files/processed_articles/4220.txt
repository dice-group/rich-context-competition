    "abstract": "Abstract\nMethodologists have offered general strategies for integration in mixed-methods studies through merging of quantitative and\nqualitative data. While these strategies provide researchers in the field general guidance on how to integrate data during\nmixed-methods analysis, a methodological typology detailing specific analytic frameworks has been lacking. The purpose of this\narticle is to introduce a typology of analytical approaches for mixed-methods data integration in mixed-methods convergent\nstudies. We distinguish three dimensions of data merging analytics: (1) the relational dimension, (2) the methodological\ndimension, and (3) the directional dimension. Five different frameworks for data merging relative to the methodological\nand directional dimension in convergent mixed-methods studies are described: (1) the explanatory unidirectional approach,\n(2) the exploratory unidirectional approach, (3) the simultaneous bidirectional approach, (4) the explanatory bidirectional\napproach, and (5) the exploratory bidirectional approach. Examples from empirical studies are used to illustrate each type.\nResearchers can use this typology to inform and articulate their analytical approach during the design, implementation, and\nreporting phases to convey clearly how an integrated approach to data merging occurred.\n",

Since that time, a growing number of\nempirical studies have been published, and there is consider-\nably more agreement about the nomenclature for core designs\nIntegration is considered by many to be the hallmark of\nO'Cathain et al., 2007). Integration is defined as an intentional\nprocess by which the researcher brings quantitative and quali-\ntative data together in one study (Creswell, 2015a). By inten-\ntionally integrating data, the researcher can access knowledge\nor insights unavailable to a quantitative or qualitative study\nundertaken independently (Fetters and Freshwater, 2015;\nO'Cathain et al., 2007). Researchers can achieve MMR inte-\ngration through the philosophical, research design, methods\nand data collection, and/or during the interpretation and report-\ning levels of the research.\nConceptual models to guide integration\nduring analysis in convergent mixed\nmethods studies\nEllen Moseholm1 and Michael D Fetters2\n Keywords\nMixed methods, integration, convergent design, merging, analysis, theory\nDepartment of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of\nCopenhagen, Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark\nDepartment of Family Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nCorresponding author:\nEllen Moseholm, Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases,\nHiller\u00f8d, Denmark.\nEmail: ellen.froesig.moseholm.larsen@regionh.dk\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nThe objectives of this article are three-fold. First, we\ndescribe integration at the different levels and the integration\nchallenges specifically associated with merging quantitative\nand qualitative data in the analysis in convergent mixed-meth-\nods studies. Second, we define three dimensions of merging\nanalytics at the relational, methodological, and directional lev-\nels, and describe the subcategories of each. Third, we intro-\nduce a typology including novel nomenclature for\nmixed-methods analysis procedures relative to the methodo-\nlogical and directional level in convergent MMR studies. We\nintroduce a lens heuristic that can be used to illustrate the\ndirectional levels, unidirectional and bidirectional, to illustrate\nvariationsinthetypologyforinformingintegrationapproaches.\nThrough these conceptual representations and examples,\nmixed-methods researchers can understand different\napproaches in merging of quantitative and qualitative data to\nenhance interpretation of merged data in convergent studies.\nIntegration in mixed-methods research\nIntegration at the philosophical level\nThe utility of paradigms for MMR has been debated exten-\nsively by previous methodologists (Morgan, 2007; Plano\nposes of this article, we use Morgan's (2007) definition of\nparadigm as \"systems of shared beliefs among a community\nof scholars\" that influence how researchers select both the\nquestions they study and the methods that they use to study\nthem (p. 65). The terms \"quantitative\" and \"qualitative\" are\nnot synonymous with paradigms, but refer to different\napproaches to data and methods in social science (Biesta,\nMixing of epistemological positions. Some methodologists have\nquestioned whether the different epistemological positions\nthat quantitative and qualitative studies employ can be logi-\ncally mixed and integrated (Biesta, 2010; Plano Clark and\nIvankova, 2016). Some could argue that MMR is unattainable\nbecause it is not possible to mix methods that are based on\nincompatible views of the social world (Plano Clark and\nmultiple, even conflicting paradigms should be used in MMR\nresearch. For example, Johnson argues for dialectical plural-\nism as a \"metaparadigm\" for integrating equally and respect-\nfully the quantitative and qualitative paradigms such that\nresearchers can thrive on their differences and intellectual\ntensions while still developing integrated wholes (Johnson,\n2015). Another prominent stance is that there are single para-\ndigms that can provide a good foundation for MMR. Mertens\n(2003) argues for a transformative-emancipation paradigm\ncharacterized by the intentional collaboration with minority\nand marginalized groups, while others discuss critical realism\nas philosophical basis for MMR (Maxwell and Mittapalli,\n2010). A detailed review of these arguments exceeds the\nscope of this article, but a good overview of different para-\ndigms in MMR is provided by Shannon-Baker (2015).\nDespite some strongly argued views of the incompatibility of\nquantitative and qualitative approaches, a robust series of pro-\nposals for integration at the philosophical level have been\narticulated and have become increasingly accepted.\nAn analysis grounded in pragmatism.In this article, we take\npragmatism as our paradigmatic stance (Morgan, 2007,\n2014). The rationale for a pragmatic approach in MMR\nresearch lies in its response to the traditional ontological and\nepistemological positions that proclaim issues of incompati-\nble paradigms when conducting MMR research (Biesta,\n2010). Pragmatism does not reject the differences between,\nfor example, positivism and constructivism as approaches to\nresearch, but focuses on their characteristic approaches to\ninquiry (Morgan, 2014). Pragmatism emphasizes creating\nshared meaning and joint action, and this emphasis points to\nthe underlying belief in complementarity. Hence, quantita-\ntive and qualitative approaches can be combined in order to\ncomplement the advantages and disadvantages within each\nIntegration at the design level\nIntegration at the design level can occur through core (also\nknown as basic) designs that include explanatory sequential,\nexploratory sequential, and convergent designs (Creswell,\nbegins with collecting and analyzing quantitative data, and\nthese findings then inform the follow-up qualitative phase.\nThe exploratory sequential design begins with collecting and\nanalyzing qualitative data that then builds to the subsequent\nquantitative phase (Fetters et al., 2013). In a convergent\ndesign, the quantitative and qualitative data are collected and\nanalyzed during a similar timeframe and the data compared\n(Fetters et al., 2013). In addition to these core designs, there\nare additional advanced designs or so-called \"complex\"\ndesigns (Nastasi and Hitchcock, 2016), multistage applica-\ntions, intervention, case study, participatory, and instrument/\napp development build upon the three core designs, but have\nan overarching purpose, for example, interventional MMR\ndesign used in trials, or transformative design used to pro-\nIntegration at the methods level\nThe scope of general procedures for linking quantitative and\nqualitative data at the methods level has been classified as\nconnecting (linking through sampling), building (findings\nfrom one strand inform development of data collection tools\nor procedures for the other strand), hypothesis generating and\ntesting (using one type of data to generate hypothesis and\nanother type of data to test that hypothesis), matching (reflect-\ning the intent to have themes/constructs match on a domain\nMoseholm and Fetters 3\nby domain basis), diffracting (using cuts of data to understand\na phenomenon), embedding (the addition of qualitative data\ninto a multistage study at multiple points), and merging (the\ntwo databases are brought together for analysis and for com-\nFive of these approaches occur during data collection, while\nmerging remains the most obtuse as it refers to the analytical\nprocess, and diffraction may refer to multiple levels.\nIntegration at the interpretation and reporting\nlevel\nIntegration at the interpretation and reporting level can be\neither through narrative, data transformation, joint displays,\nand visualization, for example, using Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) mapping (Fielding and Cisneros-Puebla, 2009;\nFor example, Beck et al. (2009) describe the quantitative and\nqualitative findings in the discussion, thereby integrating\ndata through a narrative. Tarn et al. (2013) illustrate transfor-\nmation of data in their intervention study where qualitative\ndata were transformed into quantitative data and then merged\nwith quantitative survey results in a combined analysis.\nPanda et al. (2015) illustrate the use of joint display as a way\nto bring data together through visual means in a convergent\nstudy. Jones (2015) illustrates the use of visualization through\nGIS mapping in seed distribution programming.\nA more detailed view of merging data\nin a convergent MMR study\nMerging of quantitative and qualitative data during the anal-\nysis continues to be an active area of discussion and develop-\nment, but has proven to be difficult in practice (Bryman,\nin the analysis phase in convergent MMR studies, and this\ncan be challenging due to the inherent difficulty of compar-\ning results from different forms of data. Current discussions\nabout merging remain general, and use descriptive non-\ndirective language such as \"the data are brought together to\nenhance greater understanding\" (Creswell and Plano Clark,\nApproaches for integrating quantitative and qualitative data\nhave been addressed in the literature (Bazeley, 2012; Castro\n2010). These authors suggest practical techniques relative to\nintegrating data generally during the methods, but explication\nof a typology for approaches to merging quantitative and quali-\ntative data during the actual analysis remains obtuse.\nArticulating the intent of merging during design of\na convergent MMR study\nDuring the design of a convergent mixed-methods study,\ninvestigators may have various degrees of clarity of intent\nrelative to merging.The first pattern, a \"blind faith\" approach,\ndescribes the situation when the researchers have an intent,\nsometimes more vague than not, that merging the two types\nof data will produce new insights about the phenomena of\ntheir research. The second pattern, the \"matching\" approach,\ninvolves intentionally designing data collection instruments\nto have related items such that both instruments will eluci-\ndate data about the same phenomena/variables. Concretely,\nthis involves matching qualitative questions with scales of\net al., 2013). The third pattern, the \"data diffraction\"\napproach, alludes to the design (and often inevitability) of\nthe quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments to\nobtain different aspects of a central phenomenon. The intent\nis to obtain different \"cuts of data\" that will reveal informa-\ntion about different aspects of a phenomenon of interest\nTechniques for merging qualitative and\nquantitative data\nThe existing literature does offer techniques for merging\nquantitative and qualitative data for analysis (Bazeley, 2012;\ncomparing the quantitative and qualitative findings after sep-\narate analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data col-\nconstruct-by-construct basis by linking related quantitative\nscales and qualitative themes (Fetters et al., 2013); (3) follow-\ning a thread based on a finding during the analysis of one type\nof data that leads to looking for related information in the\nother type of data (O'Cathain et al., 2010); (4) analysis\nthrough construction of joint display that juxtaposes quantita-\ntive and qualitative findings side-by-side, and then draws\nmeta-inferences from both sources of data (Guetterman et al.,\n2015); (5) data transformation of one type of data into the\nother type of data (e.g. qualitative to quantitative data trans-\nformation followed by merging of the transformed quantita-\ntive data with the other collected quantitative data, or\nquantitative to qualitative transformation followed by merg-\ning of the transformed qualitative data with the other col-\nlected qualitative data) (Fetters et al., 2013); (6) data\ncorrelation (as an iteration of qualitative to quantitative trans-\nformation) involves the process of correlating or cross-classi-\nfying the data types, for example, converting qualitative data\ninto \"variables\" and correlating with quantitative data through\npoint-biserial correlation and cross-tabulation tables (Johnson\nand Christensen, 2014); (7) data consolidation when quantita-\ntive and qualitative data are brought together to form new\nconsolidated codes, variables, or datasets (Johnson and\nChristensen, 2014); and (8) use of GIS mapping to bring\ntogether for analysis spatial information with local quantita-\ntive or qualitative findings (Fielding and Cisneros-Puebla,\n2009). These techniques focus on the practical approach to\nmerging, while paying little attention to the analytical frame.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nOutcomes of merging\nThe existing literature also presents outcomes of merging\ndata. An outcome of the comparisons of the two different\nstrands, that is, the quantitative and qualitative, on a topic is\nthe ability to see whether the databases converge, comple-\nment, conflict, or diverge (Creswell, 2015b). Note should\nbe made that the intention of data collection procedures\nduring the design phase, and the outcomes after the actual\ndata collection and analysis may not always be congruent.\nThat is, a researcher who matches data collection to similar\ndomains on both the quantitative and qualitative data col-\nlection tools may well produce data that converge, comple-\nment, conflict, or diverge. Across all domains of the study,\nthere can be two or more of these outcomes for each domain\nwithin the same study.\nThe mixed-methods methodology \"field test\"\nFor mixed-methods researchers, the \"rubber hits the road\"\nwhen field work actually ensues, and it is during this time\nwhen cracks, potholes, and omissions in current methodo-\nlogical thinking often become apparent. In working on the\nintegration of survey data and interview data in two differ-\nent convergent MMR studies--one investigating quality of\nlife in patients undergoing diagnostic evaluations for can-\ncer (Moseholm et al., 2016), and another project on gate-\nkeeper training for suicide prevention in an ethnic minority\npopulation (Teo et al., 2016)--we felt keenly that current\ndescriptions in the literature fell short for describing the\nanalytical framing and procedures we were using. Despite\nthe deceivingly simple notion that the data are \"brought\ntogether and compared,\" different possibilities for merging\nsurfaced. This prompted our exploration of a typology of\nanalytical frameworks for and examples of data merging\nduring integration. This approach focuses on merging at the\nanalytical level, thereby extending the practical techniques\npreviously described in the literature (Creswell, 2015a;\nThree dimensions of data merging\nanalytics\nWe contend that there are three key dimensions of data merg-\ning analytics in an integrated MMR analysis, the relational,\nthe methodological, and directional. Below, we discuss these\nthree dimensions (Table 1).\nRelational dimension of merging\nThe relational dimension of data merging can be defined as\nhow researchers conducting mixed-methods studies allow\nthe data collection and analytics of the quantitative and qual-\nitative strands to interface. The relational dimension can be\ncharacterized under two categories, either \"separative\" or\n\"iterative.\" In the separative approach, the quantitative and\nqualitative data analyses are conducted independent of each\nother until the final merging of the two strands. For example,\nMcAuley et al. (2006) utilized a separate approach where the\nquantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed\nseparately and then integrated through themes in the discus-\nsion of the results. This may be especially common in large\nteams where there is a qualitative analysis team, and a biosta-\ntistics team. In the iterative approach, \"the data talk to each\nother\" during the analysis and data collection. For example,\nCrabtree et al. (2005) utilized an iterative approach in MMR\ncase studies research when qualitative findings were used\nearly on to develop and refine quantitative instruments.\nRather than allowing two products to emerge separately for\ncomparison, for example, the quantitative results and the\nqualitative results, and then compared, the iterative approach\ninvolves cross-talk during the data collection and analytics.\nMethodological dimension of merging\nThe methodological dimension of data merging can be\ndefined as how the quantitative and qualitative strands are\nweighted relative to merging analytics. There are three cate-\ngories of the methodological dimension of data merging ana-\nlytics. Johnson et al. (2007) describe MMR as being\n\"qualitatively driven,\" \"quantitatively driven,\" and \"equal-\nstatus.\" They depict qualitatively driven MMR as QUAL +\nquan to emphasize that the qualitative strand predominates,\nand define it thus:\nQualitative dominant mixed methods research is the type of\nmixedresearchinwhichonereliesonaqualitative,constructivist-\npoststructuralist-critical view of the research process, while\nconcurrently recognizing that the addition of quantitative data\nand approaches are likely to benefit most research projects.\nThey depict quantitatively driven MMR as QUAN + qual\nto emphasize when the quantitative strand predominates, and\ndefine it as follows:\nQuantitative dominant mixed methods research is the type of\nmixedresearchinwhichonereliesonaquantitative,postpositivist\nTable 1. Three dimensions of data merging analytics.\nRelational dimension\nSeparative\nIterative\nMethodological dimension\n Qualitatively driven\n Quantitatively driven\n Equivalently driven\nDirectional dimension\nUnidirectional\nBidirectional\nMoseholm and Fetters 5\nview of the research process, while concurrently recognizing that\nthe addition of qualitative data and approaches are likely to\nThey do not define the \"Equal Status\" approach directly\nJohnson (2015: 4) later elaborates on equal-status as \"inter-\nactive mixed research\" where the researcher or research team\nattempts to listen to qualitative- and quantitative-related\nepistemologies or insights to produce a superior whole. To\nprovide greater consistency and clarity, we propose the term\nequivalently driven mixed-methods research.\nDirectional dimension of merging\nThe directional dimension of merging can be defined as\nwhether the merging analytics occur using a one-way \"unidi-\nrectional\" approach, or whether the merging analytics occur\nusing a \"two-way\" bidirectional approach.\nUnidirectional approaches.In the unidirectional approaches,\nthe lens of the completed analysis of one type of data frames\nthe merging of the two types of data. As the merging can go\nfrom the quantitative strand to the qualitative strand or from\nthe qualitative strand to the quantitative strand, two unidirec-\ntional approaches emerge (Figures 1 and 2).\nBidirectional approaches.In bidirectional approaches, the\nhallmark is using the analytics of both the quantitative and\nqualitative strands to frame merging. These frameworks\nhave a \"two-way\" lens such that the analyses of both types of\ndata can be considered in the framing. This can be achieved\nsimultaneously or iteratively. With the simultaneous\napproach, the researcher uses results from the quantitative\nand qualitative strands to look at each other and structure the\nmerged findings based on both (Figure 3). As the merging\ncan go from the quantitative strand to the qualitative strand\nand back to the quantitative strand (Figure 4) or from the\nqualitative strand to the quantitative strand and back to the\nqualitative strand (Figure 5). Hence, there are three bidirec-\ntional approaches.\nTypology and nomenclature for mixed\nmethods analytic procedures when\nmerging data in convergent mixed-\nmethods research\nFor consistency with the existing and predominant language\nof MMR, the terminology introduced in the typology lever-\nages language used for MMR study designs. This was a\ndeliberate choice as the typology logically extends concepts\nthat already exist in the MMR literature (Fetters and Molina-\nBased on the above-presented dimensions of data merg-\ning, a typology can thus be developed for data merging\nanalytics (Table 2). As the relational element speaks to the\npresence or lack of iterative merging during data collection\nand analysis, and the proposed typology speaks to the data\nmerging analytics only, our typology incorporates elements\nfrom the methodological and directional dimensions. The\nFigure 1. Explanatory unidirectional framework for convergent\ndesign integration.\nFigure 2. Exploratory unidirectional framework for convergent\ndesign integration.\nFigure 3. Simultaneous bidirectional framework for convergent\ndesign integration.\n6 Methodological Innovations\nproposed typology focuses on the methodological frame of\nintegration, for example, merging analytics, and is therefore\nnot linked to the other \"levels\" of integration, for example,\nthe philosophical, design, or methods.\nBelow we present the typology of the five different MMR\nanalytical approaches, both uni- and bidirectional, for fram-\ning the integration through merging of quantitative and qual-\nitative data in a convergent design (Figures 1 to 5).\nTo demonstrate the five possible combinations of data\nmerging analytics beyond the conceptual level, there needs\nto be empirical evidence for the five data merging analytical\nprocedures. Table 2 provides each framework and a relevant\nstudy to illustrate how researchers have used the different\napproaches in merging of quantitative and qualitative data in\nactual convergent studies. These articles were found through\nsearches in Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Quality &\nQuantity, Field Methods, and Google Scholar using the fol-\nlowing search words: \"convergent OR concurrent\" AND\n\"mixed methods.\" The search focused on the ways in which\nresearchers framed the merging of quantitative and qualita-\ntive data in their analysis. The methodological approach used\nin the analysis was identified by the authors of this article\nbased on the methods, priority of quantitative and qualitative\nstrands, and/or presentation and discussion of the results.\nExamples for each of the five merging analytical procedures\nare provided below.\nNomenclature for unidirectional approaches\nIn both unidirectional approaches, the lens of the completed\nanalysis of one type of data frames the merging of the two\ntypes of data. Thus, there is a sequential approach to the anal-\nysis. The literature provides language for sequential MMR\ndesigns. This language can be readily extended to merging\nanalyses.\nExplanatory unidirectional framework for data\nmerging analytics\nWhen an initial quantitative strand is conducted and fol-\nlowed by a qualitative study to explain the findings, the\ndesign is called an explanatory mixed-methods design. When\nthe lens of the strand of the quantitative analytics frames the\nmerged analysis, it is called a unidirectional explanatory uni-\ndirectional framework (Figure 1). Thus, at the analytical\nlevel, a quantitatively structured analysis is complemented\nby the qualitative data to provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the phenomena of interest.\nExplanatory unidirectional framework examples.Two studies\nillustrate the explanatory unidirectional approach. Maiorana\net al. (2012) illustrate this approach in their study about trust\nand acceptability of sharing HIV-related patient data. Quan-\ntitative survey data with HIV patients and qualitative inter-\nview data with medical staff were merged for comparison,\nusing the qualitative findings to provide a more in-depth\nunderstanding of the quantitative drivers and barriers of shar-\ning HIV-related patient data (Maiorana et al., 2012). The\nquantitative data framed the analysis and the qualitative data\nwere used to elaborate and explain the quantitative findings.\nKennett et al. (2008) used a convergent MMR design to\nunderstand how learned resourcefulness empowers individu-\nals with chronic pain. Using survey data to divide partici-\npants into categories of high and low resourcefulness, the\nresearchers used qualitative data to explain contrasting expe-\nriences across categories. The quantitative categories framed\nthe merging of the two datasets and the qualitative data were\nused to enhance understanding of the complexities underly-\ning the pain-coping process (Kennett et al., 2008).\nExploratory unidirectional framework for data\nmerging analytics\nWhen an initial qualitative strand is used to explore a topic\nthat is then followed by a quantitative strand, the design is\ncalled an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. This\nFigure 4. Explanatory bidirectional framework for convergent\ndesign integration.\nFigure 5. Exploratory bidirectional framework for convergent\ndesign integration.\nMoseholm and Fetters 7\nlanguage can be adapted to merging analytics. When the lens\nof the strand of the qualitative analytics frames the merged\nanalysis, it is an exploratory unidirectional framework (Figure\n2). Thus, at the analytical level a qualitatively structured anal-\nysis is complemented by the quantitative data to provide a\nmore thorough understanding of the phenomena of interest.\nExploratory unidirectional framework examples. Astudy explor-\ning how knowledge and cognitive function contribute to self-\ncare in patients with heart failure illustrates the exploratory\nunidirectional approach (Dickson et al., 2011). Qualitative\ninterview data were used to create a frame for the next steps\nin the analysis where the quantitative survey results were\nused to enhance understanding by exploring misconceptions\nand lack of understanding in those with inadequate self-care\ndepth qualitative interviews and quantitative web-based sur-\nveys with medical providers in a study examining how HIV\npatients' care teams perceived the usefulness and ease of\napplication of newly implemented health information\nexchange systems. From the qualitative data, the researchers\ndiscovered key differences in perceptions and actual use of\nhealth information exchange systems across occupational\ngroups. The researchers then used these results to guide the\nanalysis of the quantitative survey data, stratifying by occu-\npational group. Merging of the two datasets was thus framed\nby the qualitative data analysis, and the final results offer\ninsights into the use and potential benefits of health informa-\ntion exchange systems (Myers et al., 2012).\nNomenclature for bidirectional approaches\nThe bidirectional approach refers to an integration tactic using\na \"two-way\" lens that allows framing with both a quantitative\nand qualitative lens. This can be achieved simultaneously or\niteratively. This yields three possible frameworks based on the\nmethodological and directional dimensions of an analysis.\nThe temporality in the bidirectional lenses is dependent on\nhow the analysis is initially framed, and not necessarily on the\nweighting of the quantitative and qualitative components.\nSimultaneous bidirectional framework for data\nmerging analytics\nThe simultaneous bidirectional framework involves a simul-\ntaneous quantitative and qualitative frame for merging.\nSimultaneous is a key idea in this process as it reflects an\nactive back and forth, interactive consideration of both the\nTable 2.

An illustration\nof simultaneous bidirectional lens can be seen in a convergent\nMMR study of food safety knowledge in Hispanic families\n(Stenger et al., 2014). Quantitative survey data and qualitative\ninterview data were collected and analyzed separately, and\nthen merged for interpretation. Using overarching dimen-\nsions, qualitative themes were compared with survey results\nto assess concordance. The results were combined in a joint\ndisplay, where the frame of the analysis was the overarching\nexamined patient satisfaction with nursing care in a neurosur-\ngical critical care unit. In a joint display, the researchers pre-\nsented a matrix describing quantitative survey results of high,\nmedium, and low patient satisfaction scores with examples of\npositive, negative, and \"yes, but\" comments from qualitative\ninterviews with patients. The quantitative and qualitative data\nhad equal weight during the integration, which enabled\nresearchers to move beyond the ceiling effect of quantitative\nmeasures of patient satisfaction and to gain a more meaning-\nful explanation of patient satisfaction (Andrew et al., 2011).\nExplanatory bidirectional framework for data\nmerging analytics\nMerging analytics that include a bidirectional component, first\nframed by the quantitative strand, then further considered by\nthe qualitative strand, is an explanatory bidirectional frame-\nwork. It is an iterative approach with an initial quantitatively\nframed analysis that is followed by a qualitatively framed\nanalysis before reaching a final interpretation (Figure 4).\nExplanatory bidirectional framework examples.The explana-\ntory bidirectional framework is illustrated in a study looking\nat a film intervention compared to lecture format control for\nincreasing suicide prevention among Japanese people. The\nauthors used a convergent MMR design simultaneously col-\nlecting survey data and open text data in self-administered\nsurvey format (Teo et al., 2016). The instruments addressed\nawareness, self-efficacy, gatekeeper behavior, and social\nnorms, while three open-ended questions elicited the qualita-\ntive data. For the analysis, three domains of focus in the\nquantitative strand were used as a priori codes to search the\nqualitative data. Subsequent to this analysis, the authors\nexamined the emerging themes from the qualitative text to\nlook for corroborative data from the quantitative dataset.\nExploratory bidirectional framework for data\nmerging analytics\nMerging analytics that include a bidirectional component,\nfirst framed by the qualitative strand, then further considered\nby the lens of the quantitative strand, is an exploratory bidi-\nrectional framework. It is an iterative approach with an ini-\ntial qualitatively framed analysis that is followed by a\nquantitatively framed analysis before reaching a final inter-\npretation by reconsidering the qualitative data (Figure 5).\nExploratory bidirectional framework examples. The exploratory\nbidirectional framework is illustrated in an ongoing study\nlooking at quality of life in patients undergoing diagnostic\nevaluations for cancer, where survey data and semi-struc-\ntured interviews with patients were completed within the\nsame timeframe. An initial analysis is framed by themes of\nhigh, intermediate, and poor quality of life as expressed by\nthe patients in qualitative interviews. Quantitative data are\nthen used to elaborate these results. Subsequently, quantita-\ntive categories of high, intermediate, and poor quality of life\nin relation to survey scores are being compared to corrobo-\nrating themes in the qualitative interview data to achieve a\nfinal interpretation.\nDiscussion\nThe full value of convergent MMR designs may be realized\nonly if researchers apply effective merging strategies in their\npractice (Plano Clark et al., 2010). This article provides a\ntypology and rhetoric for methodologically framing the inte-\ngration through merging in convergent MMR studies. While\nexisting terminology of \"exploratory sequential\" and\n\"explanatory sequential\" relates to MMR designs (Creswell,\nlytical procedures relates to the methodological frame of the\nanalysis. We believe that the similarity in language is a\nstrength as it builds on concepts that already exist in the\nMMR literature.\nThe conceptual framework was developed while working\nwith integration through merging in empirical MMR studies.\nWe searched the literature to find examples of how research-\ners have used different merging approaches to enhance inter-\npretation of the integrated quantitative and qualitative data in\nactual convergent studies. It was relatively easy to find stud-\nies using either an explanatory or exploratory unidirectional\nframework. We also found studies using a simultaneous bidi-\nrectional framework. We were less successful in identifying\nstudies using either the explanatory bidirectional or explora-\ntory bidirectional framework. We suspect this is at least\npartly attributable to the practice of authors truncating dis-\ncussion in the methods and instead allocating words to the\nresults or discussion section due to word count restrictions.\nVery few studies we identified were explicit about the\ndrivers of the analysis (Maiorana et al., 2012; Myers et al.,\n2012), making it difficult not only to systematically search\nand review the MMR literature but also to identify the ana-\nlytical framework used in the integration of quantitative and\nqualitative data. Several reviews have found that most MMR\npapers lack clarity in whether the reported results stem from\nMoseholm and Fetters 9\nquantitative or qualitative findings, and papers are even less\nclear when discussing their results and the basis of their con-\nsuspect the lack of description may also be driven in part\ndue to the lack of a rubric and recognition of variation in\nintegration approaches. The introduced typology can be\nused to fill this function.\nThe topic of merging analytical procedures in conver-\ngent studies raises several questions. First, while there are\nfive possible approaches, we cannot comment whether one\nis superior to the other. For example, is it preferable to\nhave a simultaneously bidirectional approach to the merg-\ning of data or is a bidirectional approach the most rigorous\nmethod as it requires the researcher to be clear about the\nunderlying analytical frame guiding the analysis at specific\ntime points? We suspect that the answer is study specific.\nThere might also be situations where a unidirectional\nframework is appropriate, for example, in a survey where\nthe qualitative data stem from one or two open-ended\nquestions. Although the choice of which framework to use\nrelates to the aim of the study, the design, and the weighing\nof the quantitative and qualitative data, some recommen-\ndations may be made. The unidirectional approach may be\nsuitable in convergent studies where there is a clear empha-\nsis on either the quantitative or qualitative strand. The\nsimultaneous bidirectional approach may be suitable in\nstudies using matching, thereby a priori identifying the\ndomains used to frame the analysis. It is more difficult to\nmake recommendations for when to use the explanatory\nand exploratory bidirectional frameworks, as this will be\nlargely dependent on the study aim, rationale for merging,\nand the different types of data.\nSecond, there is the question of bias and/or preconcep-\ntions, which relates to the underlying predominant\napproach. Quantitative researchers typically attempt to\neliminate or control for bias. In contrast, qualitative\nresearchers actively seek to use their preconceptions to\nunderstand qualitative findings. Sale et al. (2002) argue\nthat the distinction of the underlying methodology in MMR\nresearch is crucial, and thus, researchers must be clear,\nwhen merging two datasets, if the driver is a quantitative\nframe (to control for bias) or a qualitative frame (to use\nprevious knowledge actively when analyzing the data). In\nour opinion, the approach to bias/preconception should\nfollow the underlying predominant approach.\nBeing explicit about which analytical procedure frames\nthe analysis can contribute to researchers' understanding of\napproaches available for merging the quantitative and quali-\ntative components of a convergent MMR study; still, this\nresult does not imply the priority of one dataset over the\nother. Instead of talking about priority of either the quantita-\ntive or qualitative strands in a MMR study, Creswell (2015b)\nargues that a clearer approach is to focus on the intent of the\nMMR integration. Being clear on the intent entails clarity of\nthe merging analytical framework used in the integration.\nConclusion\nHere, we have introduced a typology for methodologically\nframing integration in convergent MMR studies, where the\naim is to merge quantitative and qualitative data. We have\nreviewed three dimensions of data merging analytics: (1) the\nrelational dimension, (2) the methodological dimension, and\n(3) the directional dimension. For the methodological and\ndirectional dimensions, we introduce five different frame-\nworks for merging analytical procedures in convergent\nmixed-methods studies. We illustrate the typology and pro-\nvide examples showing how researchers have and can use\nthe different approaches in their analyses to enhance inter-\npretation of merged data. Introducing the idea of a uni- or\nbidirectional approach to integration in MMR research pro-\nvides a conceptual framework and rhetoric for researchers to\nbe explicit about the analytic strategy for merging quantita-\ntive and qualitative data in their MMR studies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork could not have been possible without travel grants for Ellen\nMoseholm from The Graduate School of Health and Medical\nSciences, Copenhagen University, in addition to funding received\nfrom Generalkonsul Oscar Zimmermand og hustrus Legat.\nReferences\nAndrew S, Salamonson Y, Everett B, et al.
