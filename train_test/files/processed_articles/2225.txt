The analyses in the\ncurrent study are based on data from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2005-2006 US study, and the sample\nconsists of 7,001 students from 195 different schools. The findings reveal that students attending schools in which bullying prevention\nprograms are implemented are more likely to have experienced peer victimization, compared to those attending schools without\nbullying prevention. Study limitations and implications for future research are discussed.\n1. Introduction\nAlthough many studies suggest that there is a decline in\nvarious types of peer victimization among school children [1,\n2], bullying remains a serious problem in schools today [3\u00ad5].\nApproximately 1.5 million school-aged adolescents (i.e., ages\n12 to 18) report that they have been victimized by violence\nwhile at school [6]. Furthermore, 75 percent of public school\nprincipals in the United States indicate that their schools\nreported one or more violent incidents to the police, and 25\npercent of public schools reported school bullying on a daily\nor weekly basis [6].\nA growing body of research has supported the premise\nthat experiencing school violence has devastating effects on\nyouth [7\u00ad13]. For example, victims have experienced a signif-\nicantly increased risk of internalizing and somatic symptoms,\nsuch as anxiety, depression, confusion, lowered self-esteem,\nand suicidal ideation [7, 10, 11]. Further, they are more likely to\nperceive a lack of support from peers and parents and tend to\nbe isolated from social interaction with others [10]. In light of\nthis reality, a variety of bullying prevention and intervention\nprograms have been implemented and examined for their\neffectiveness [14\u00ad16]. Although these studies have examined\nvarying levels of strategies, targets, and participants, the\nmajority of them have demonstrated that comprehensive\nand whole-school efforts yield promising results for reducing\nbullying within school grounds.\nThe conditions of school environment, prevention/inter-\nvention programs, and situational factors complement or\ninteract with individual-level characteristics to influence\npeer victimization [17, 18]. Despite a range of ecological\nand contextual factors that are accountable for bullying\ninvolvement among adolescents (e.g., individual empathy,\npeer influence, family environment, teacher support), it still\nremains important to understand victim characteristics that\nare predictive of peer victimization. Previous studies of\npeer victimization, mostly based on a single dimension (i.e.,\nindividual-level or school-level predictor), have been limited\nin assessing the impact of bullying prevention because they\nignore possible contributions of other ecological contexts\nin the surrounding environment. Relative to our concern\nabout peer victimization and the need for promoting a safe\nschool environment, only a small number of studies have\nexamined the different ecological contexts of victimization\n(e.g., individual, peer, family, school) simultaneously. Thus,\n2  \nthe main purpose of the current study is to examine the\nimpact of multiple levels of ecological influence on peer\nvictimization. Few researchers have examined individual-\nand school-level predictors' influence on different forms of\npeer victimization. To date, the current study examines\nwhether these predictors (i.e., demographic characteristics,\nparental or peer support, school climate, and implementation\nof prevention programs) show a significant effect on multiple\nforms of peer victimization (i.e., physical, emotional, or both\nphysical and emotional).\n2. Prior Research on Peer Victimization\n2.1. School Bullying and Peer Victimization. Bullying can be\ndifficult to conceptualize given the multifaceted nature of the\nviolence involved. There is no simple explanation for which\nfactors contribute to bullying [12, 19]. A number of studies\nin which bullying occurs whenever a student \"is exposed\nrepeatedly, over time, to negative actions on the part of one\nor more other students\" [11, page 9]. Using this definition,\nbullying may be further characterized as the presence of\n(i) a power imbalance; (ii) intense intimidation; and (iii) a\nharmful effect on the victim [11, 19]. Thus, school bullying\nmay be defined as physical and/or emotional harm inflicted\nby other students within the geographical boundaries of a\nschool ground [11]. The forms of school bullying range from\nteasing, taunting, or calling names to hitting, kicking, or\ntaking/destroying others' belongings [11]. Studies of school\nbullying suggest that a significant number of students have\npercent to 41 percent of students reported being teased in a\nmean way or being hit, kicked, and/or pushed.\nBullying has detrimental effects on victims' well-being.\nFirst, the association between school bullying and victims'\nphysical/psychological well-being and academic maladjust-\nment is well documented [23\u00ad29]. For example, victims\nof school bullying are more likely to suffer psychological\nmaladjustment, including sadness, depression, loneliness,\nassociation is found between peer victimization and extreme\nemotional responses such as suicidal ideation and suicide\nattempts [25, 29]. Lastly, victimization can lead to interper-\nsonal and academic difficulties at school. Bullied victims\nare more likely to experience relational problems with their\npeers, to be rejected by their peers, to feel aversion toward\nschool, and to receive lower academic grades [23, 27].\n2.2. Individual-Level Risk and Protective Factors. Among a\nnumber of risk and protective factors, a myriad of studies\nfound that individual-level characteristics (i.e., age and race)\nare important sources of influence associated with peer vic-\ntimization [24, 30\u00ad35]. With respect to race, minority youth\nare more frequently victimized by peers at school than are\nmembers of dominant racial groups [24, 32]. Research also\nsupports the notion that risk of peer victimization decreases\nare less vulnerable to bullying victimization compared to\nelementary- and middle-school students. Further, the study\nand found that girls are more likely than boys to be bullied\nat school and to identify themselves as victims. However,\ntypes of victimization differ between boys and girls. While\nboys are more susceptible to physical victimization, girls are\nmore susceptible to emotional or verbal victimization (e.g.,\nrumor-spreading or gossiping) [36]. Finally, considerable\nresearch suggests that family and peer group contexts can\nbe risk or protective factors in bullying victimization; both\nfamily and peer group contexts are significantly associated\nwith students' experience of peer victimization [26, 37]. For\nexample, students who are strongly rejected by their peers\nare seen as easy targets of school bullying [37]. The results\nfrom several prior studies also indicate that students who lack\nparental supervision and support tend to be more victimized\nthan those who do not [26].\n2.3. School-Level Risk and Protective Factors. In addition to\nindividual-level characteristics, there is a growing body of\nliterature suggesting that school-level characteristics (i.e.,\nschool security, school climate, and preventive educa-\ntion/intervention) are influential in predicting the likelihood\nrelated victimization is similar to other types of criminal\nvictimization, the predictors of criminal victimization would\nbe associated with, or explanative of, school-related victim-\nization. Miethe and Meier (1994) [39] stressed that security\nand physical guardianship (i.e., locks, gates, alarm systems,\nand adult presence) have significant effects on victimization.\nAlthough the conclusions of studies on school-level security\nand its impact on the extent of school bullying victimization\nhave been mixed [40], a significant relationship has been\nfound between school security and physical guardianship and\nbullying victimization at school [17, 18, 41]. These studies\nfound that students are less likely to be bullied when schools\nincrease staff supervision, metal detectors, security cameras,\nlocked entrances, visitor sign-in, visible student badges,\nand routine/random locker checks. Furthermore, students\nattending schools whose teachers are aware of school policies\non bullying victimization and whose school professionals\nhandle victimization problems adequately tend to be victim-\nized less frequently [18].\n2.4. Effects of Preventive Strategies on Peer Victimization.\nThese findings clearly show that school violence and peer\nvictimization require changes in school culture and climate\nin order to improve the safety of adolescents at school.\nAccordingly, many scholars and policy makers are paying\nincreased attention to various preventive strategies that have\nbeen employed by schools [42]. Do these prevention strate-\ngies reduce the probability of school violence and peer victim-\nization? Since prevention strategies (i.e., reactive/proactive\nresponses, comprehensive approaches, and curriculum inter-\nventions) and their study designs show varying degrees\nof effectiveness [43], a number of empirical studies have\nreported mixed findings on strategies for reducing school\nviolence and peer victimization [11, 19, 44]. One of the most\nwidely used preventive strategies involves the implementa-\ntion of new curricula and whole-school multidisciplinary\n  3\ninterventions that aim to increase awareness of school vio-\nlence, social cognitive skills, conflict resolution, and policy\n[45] reported on a study examining the impact of 15 weeks\nof training and preventive education by using a quasiexperi-\nmental design. The authors found that participants of a new\ncurriculum for social problem-solving skills were less likely\nto engage in aggressive behaviors. However, other researchers\nfound that there was no statistically significant difference\nbetween an intervention curriculum group and a control\ngroup in decreasing bullying and victimization [46, 47].\nAside from a new curriculum, the main goal of whole-\nschool multidisciplinary interventions program (i.e., the\nOlweus Bullying Prevention Program) is to generate an effec-\ntive, comprehensive response to and consequences for school\napproach is effective in decreasing bullying victimization\nand antisocial behavior through improving school climate.\nAs part of a broader outcome evaluation of the compre-\nhensive approach, researchers reported supportive outcomes\nincluding decreased discipline referrals and suspension rates\n[48, 49]. In sum, these prior studies have been evaluating\nthe effectiveness of interventions into bullying and victim-\nization by using experimental or quasiexperimental designs.\nAlthough these studies used different designs, samples, and\nstatistical techniques, they have been generally supportive of\nthe idea that whole-school interventions or a comprehensive\napproach is more effective than curriculum-based interven-\ntions based on classroom modules.\nDespite reviews of the comprehensive prevention appr-\noach that reported on the effectiveness of programs in\naddressing school bullying, only a small number of studies\nfound that school bullying prevention programs have no\neffect or little effect on reducing school violence [50, 51].\nBased on meta-analysis, Ferguson and colleagues (2007)\n[50] reported that school antibullying programs show little\ndiscernible effect on violence and victimization of children in\na study of the effects of communal school organizations (i.e.,\nsupportive and collaborative relations among administrators,\nteachers, and students) on school victimization. Of the 254\npublic secondary schools studied, they found that communal\nschool organizations had no significant effect on reducing\nstudent victimization.\nAs programs designed to support vulnerable adolescents\nhave significantly increased [52], a number of school pro-\ngrams have been developed to address safe environments\nand students' well-being. Safe Passage program is a model\nfor reducing school problems by bringing together school\nstaff members, parents, the local health department, the\nlocal social service agency, local youth organizations, and\nstudents [53]. Recently, by identifying best practices, Oak-\nland, California, provided services targeted to vulnerable\nadolescents, including a violence-prevention curriculum,\ncase management, mental health services, and after-school\nprograms [54]. Results from studies on this comprehensive\napproach suggest that Safe Passage programs can be effective\nin delivering justice while increasing school safety compared\nto other school-based intervention programs. Specifically,\nviolence-related suspension and overall suspension have been\nsubstantially decreased [54]. Although many of our public\nschools already implemented Safe Passage programs [53],\nonly a small number of studies have evaluated its success.\n3. Research Questions and Hypotheses\nDespite the previous findings, few studies have tested the\nefficacy of intervention strategies on peer victimization. Fur-\nthermore, no study has examined the roles that intervention\nstrategies and school climate play on different types of\nbullying victimization, particularly for distinct physical and\nemotional types of victimization. The current study seeks to\naddress several issues that remain unresolved. First, this study\nfocuses on developing an explanatory model to understand\nthe relationship between school environment/climate and\npeer victimization. Second, it is evident from the literature\nreview that research on prevention strategies of bullying\nis not rigorous enough. Existing research has tested the\neffectiveness of preventive strategies based on students in\na single school site or district. Thus, little is known about\nwhether these models could be expanded to a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adolescents across multiple schools.\nConsequently, the current study suggests several research\nquestions relevant to peer victimization.\n(i) Did students' individual-level backgrounds (i.e., race,\nsex, age, parental support, peer support, and school\npressure) affect the one's risk of vulnerability to peer\nvictimization?\n(ii) Did being minority, being male, being younger, hav-\ning quality of parental support, having quality of peer\nsupport, and feeling higher level of school pressure\nincrease the one's risk of vulnerability to peer victim-\nization?\n(iii) Did students' school-level characteristics (i.e., school\nsecurity climate, implementation of safe passage\nprogram, implementation of Gang Prevention, and\nimplementation of bullying prevention) affect the\none's risk of vulnerability to peer victimization?\n4. Methodology\n4.1. Sample and Procedure. The analyses in the current study\nare based on data from the Health Behavior in School-\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), the HBSC study\nhas been conducted every four years since 1985 to examine\nschool-based behaviors of adolescents from more than 40\ndifferent countries. Funded by the United States Department\nof Health and Human Services, the HBSC study collected data\nwith a nationally representative sample of students in public,\nCatholic, and other private schools. The HBSC survey com-\nponent asks respondents about health problems and school-\nrelated issues (e.g., bullying) through early adolescence. In\naddition, a school administrators' survey has been conducted\nto obtain school-level information on violence prevention\npolicies and security practices. In order to obtain a nationally\nrepresentative sample, data were collected from students\n4  \n(from sixth to tenth grades) and school administrators in\nthe 50 states and the District of Columbia. Given that the\npurpose of the study is to understand school climate and\nviolence prevention strategies related to peer victimization\nat school, the analyses were restricted to students attending\nschools whose administrators have completed a school-level\nsurvey. Among the 8,030 students who completed the survey\nthrough a multistate sampling, 2,226 students from 32 schools\nwere excluded due to missing information of school-level\ndifferent schools were eligible for the current study.\n4.2. Dependent Variable. For the purpose of the present\nstudy, prevalence of peer victimization is operationalized as\na dichotomous variable, with \"0\" indicating the student was\nnot victimized and \"1\" indicating the student was victim-\nized by other students on school grounds (we created the\nvictimization item by summing seven items (i.e., how often\ngot called names/teased, left out of things, hit/kicked/pushed,\nothers lied about me, for race/color, for religion, and made\nsexual jokes to me) and dichotomizing them). A review of\nprior research suggests that certain characteristics of the\nvictims increase the risk of different types of victimization. In\nresponse to these differences, victimizations are grouped into\nthree categories: all victimization, physical victimization, and\nemotional victimization (peer victimization was based on\nOlweus' (1993) criteria: physical victimization and emotional\nvictimization. Physical victimization was measured with one\nitem, \"I was hit, kicked, pushed, shoved around, or locked\nindoors.\" To measure emotional victimization, the following\nsix items were used: \"I was called mean names, was made fun\nof, or teased in a hurtful way,\" \"other students left me out of\nthings on purpose, excluded me from their group of friends,\nor completely ignored me,\" \"other students told lies or spread\nfalse rumors about me and tried to make others dislike me,\" \"I\nwas bullied with mean names and comments about my race or\ncolor,\" \"I was bullied with mean names and comments about\nmy religion,\" \"other students made sexual jokes, comments,\nor gestures to me.\" Similar to all types of victimization, we\ncreated each type of victimization by summing items and\ndichotomizing them so that each measure has a dichotomous\n(yes/no) response).\n4.3. Individual-Level Variables. Three demographic back-\nground variables, Race, Sex, and Age (11 to 17), are included in\nthe study. Race was originally incorporated as an exhaustive\nlist from which respondents could select all categories that\napplied. Given the results, it was collapsed into a new dichoto-\nmous variable with 0 indicating non-white and 1 indicating\nWhite. Sex is also a dichotomous variable with 0 indicating\nfemale and 1 indicating male. Additional measures of indi-\nvidual characteristics were parental support, peer support, and\nschool pressure. the parental support construct is measured by\na combined scale of six items: parent helps me as much as I\nneed; lets me do things I like doing; is loving; understands\nmy problems; likes me to make my own decisions; and makes\nme feel better when upset. Responses were coded 1 to 3:\nalmost never, sometimes, and almost always. Then they were\ncollapsed into new continuous variables with a higher score\nindicating more warmth and support from parents (Alpha =\n.803). Peer support is measured as follows: students in my\nclass enjoy being together; are kind and helpful; and accept\nme as I am. Responses were coded on a five-point Likert scale\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), then collapsed\ninto new continuous variables with a higher score indicating\nmore warmth and support from peers (Alpha = .704). School\npressure is included to assess the role of negative emotions on\npeer victimization. This item has four categories from 1 (not\nat all) to 4 (a lot).\nsuggest that school characteristics and climate have signifi-\ncant effects on victimization. In response, the current study\nexamines two different domains of school characteristics\nto reflect school climate and preventive strategies based\non a survey of administrators. Four predictors related to\npeer victimization are used as measures of school-level\ncharacteristics: security climate, safe passage program, gang\nprevention program, and bullying prevention program. Six\nitems are used to construct the variable of security climate,\nwhich asks questions about whether the school requires\nvisitor check-in; maintains a closed campus; has staff/adults\nmonitor the halls; conducts routine bag/locker checks; uses\nmetal detectors; and has uniformed police. These items are\nmeasured by a dichotomous response, with 0: no and 1:\nyes, and collapsed into a single construct. The high value\nmeans a higher level of security climate on school grounds.\nThree preventive measures, safe passage, gang prevention, and\nbullying intervention, are used to reflect whether a school\nhas or participates in preventive programs. Each item is a\ndichotomous variable, with 0: no and 1: yes.\n5. Analytic Strategy\nTo examine the empirical relationships among the variables\ndescribed in the research question, the current study attempts\nto conduct multilevel modeling linking school-level contexts.\nMultilevel modeling (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling) is\na powerful method of analysis for treating students as\nindividual-level units and schools as school-level units [56].\nThis technique is appropriate for at least two reasons. First,\nit addresses the design effects that are inherent in the HBSC\ndataset, which utilizes a three-stage stratified design, with\ncensus divisions and grades as strata and school districts as\nprimary sampling units [57]. Second, in order to address\nthe research questions, we need to attend to the validity\nand model misfit due to hierarchically structured data. This\ntechnique allows researchers to resolve these problems while\nsimultaneously investigating both within- and between-\ngroup variances [56]. Therefore, the multilevel modeling pre-\nsented the current study's focus on school-level predictors of\nsecure school climate and school-level prevention strategies,\nas well as the individual-level predictors. The two-level model\nconsists of two submodels, one for each level (i.e., Level-\n1, the individual-level model and Level-2, the school-level\nmodel). While the Level-1 model represents the relationships\namong the individual-level predictors, the Level-2 model\ncaptures the influence of school-level covariates' effects.\n  5\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics of all variables ( = 7001).\n (%) Mean (St. deviation) Minimum Maximum\nIndividual-level variables\nSchool-level variables\nPeer victimization\nDue to the hierarchical nature of the current data (students\nnested within schools) and the nature of binary outcomes\n(victimized within school grounds), multilevel mixed-effects\nlogistic regressions are conducted using STATA 12.0.\n6. Results\n6.1. Descriptive Statistics. Table 1 illustrates the descriptive\nstatistics for the dependent and independent variables used\nin the current study. Of 7,001 students, approximately 55 per-\ncent reported experiencing some form of peer victimization\nduring the school year. In particular, among those bullied\nstudents, slightly more than half (53.1%) of the students had\nbeen emotionally bullied (i.e., being called names, victims of\nrumors, or ignored), and about 14 percent of the students had\nexperienced physical bullying (i.e., being hit, kicked, pushed,\nshoved around, or locked indoors). Table 1 also shows that the\nsample population was 47 percent white and 48 percent male,\nwarmth and support from their parents (mean = 15.56 and\nstudents in the current study felt significant levels of stress\nSchool-level variables reported by a sample of 195 school\nadministrators are also illustrated in Table 1. Of the six\nsecurity measures listed under the security climate item,\nthe mean number of security measures was 4.04 (sd =\n1.33). The majority of schools have around four security\nmeasures among six possible strategies, such as visitor check-\nin, a closed campus, staff/adult hall monitors, bag/locker\nchecks, metal detectors, and uniformed police. In terms of\npreventive school programs, the majority of schools have\nbullying prevention programs (65.4%). Approximately 45\npercent of school administrators reported that their schools\nhave implemented gang prevention programs, followed by\nSafe Passage programs (22.8%).\n6.2. Bivariate Analysis. As a preliminary measure, bivariate\ncorrelations among individual-level and school-level vari-\nables are computed (Table 2). As expected, the individual-\nlevel characteristics (i.e., sex, age, parental support, and\npeer support) were negatively correlated with ever being\nvictimized. In contrast, the level of stress about schoolwork\nwas positively related to the experience of peer victim-\nization. At the school level, although it was hypothesized\nthat these security-related predictors would be related to\nvictimization, there were no significant associations between\nsecurity climates, Safe Passage program, gang prevention, and\npeer victimization. Unexpectedly, however, there was positive\nassociation between bullying-prevention programs and peer\nvictimization.\n6.3. Multilevel Models. Multilevel models are constructed\nto determine whether the prevalence of peer victimization,\nphysical victimization, and emotional victimization varies\naccording to school-level predictors (the basic unconditional\nmodel was first conducted to determine the proportion of the\nvariance in outcome between the schools. An analysis of the\nintraclass correlations reveals that around 7 percent (ICC =\n.065) of the variance in peer victimization (both physical\nand emotional victimization) is accounted for by differences\nin the characteristics of the schools. Although most of the\nvariance in student-level characteristics (around 90%) was\nattributed to within-school variance, the between-school\nvariance was statistically significant). Table 3 presents the\nresults of models that include the individual-level and school-\nlevel variables for all three types of victimization (Model 1)\nand for specific types of victimization (Models 2 and 3) from\ncompeting risks models (for interpretation, the estimated\ncoefficients have been transformed into odds ratios). Level-\n1 of Model 1 shows the general pattern of individual-level\ndifferences in odds ratios for victimization cases. Specifically,\nmale students were .67 times less likely than female students\n6  \nTable 2: Correlations of individual-level and school-level covariates.\nIndividual-level variables\nSchool-level variables\nPeer victimization\n(1) Bolded coefficients denote P < 0.05.\n(2) As a preliminary measure, only overall victimizations were included in bivariate analysis.\nTable 3: Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression ( = 7001).\nModel 1 (all) Model 2 (physical) Model 3 (emotional)\n (OR)  (OR)  (OR)  (OR)  (OR)  (OR)\nFixed effects\nIndividual-level variables\nSchool-level variables\nGoodness of fit\n(1) Bolded coefficients denote P < 0.05.\n(2) Null model (equivalent to a one-way ANOVA with schools as a random effect) for each dependent variable that is not reported.\nto report victimization. In addition, older students were 15\npercent less likely than younger students to be victims of\nschool bullying. Those with more warmth, parent support,\nand peer support were less likely to be victims of school bul-\nlying (OR = .933 and OR = .845, resp.). In contrast, students\nwith a higher level of stress about schoolwork were 1.13 times\nmore likely to report victimization than those with a lower\nlevel of stress. After controlling for school-level variables,\nthe results of individual-level effects were consistent with\nour predictions (see Model 1). As expected, the results show\nthat gang prevention programs had significant effects on peer\nvictimization. More specifically, students attending schools\nwhere gang prevention programs are provided were less likely\nto report victimization (OR = .831). For other school-\nlevel predictors such as security climate and Safe Passage\nprograms, we proposed that students attending schools with\nSafe Passage programs or more secure climates were less\nlikely to be victimized. This hypothesis was not supported.\n  7\nInterestingly, bullying prevention programs were negatively\nrelated to peer victimization. That is, students attending\nschools with bullying prevention programs were more likely\nto have experienced peer victimization (OR = 1.236).\nModel 2 in Table 3 shows the effects of individual-\nlevel predictors on physical victimization. Similar to Model\n1 (all types of victimization), the effects of age, parental\nsupport, and peer support were also significant and in\nthe predicted directions, indicating decreased risk of being\nphysically victimized. The effect of the level of stress due to\nschoolwork was not significant in Model 2. However, being\nmale was a significant predictor of physical victimization\nwith a different direction compared to Model 1. That is, male\nstudents were 2.17 times more likely than female students\nto become victims of physical bullying. With the addition\nof school-level variables into the model, individual-level\npredictors were consistent with the individual-level model\nin Model 2. Notably, it was not expected that providing\nbullying prevention programs would be found as a significant\npredictor of physical victimization (OR = 1.290).\nModel 3 presents results from a multilevel logistic regres-\nsion for emotional victimization. In the Level-1 model with\nindividual-level predictors, a number of predictors were\nsignificantly related to emotional victimization. Emotional\nvictimization was negatively associated with being male,\nbeing older, and having more warmth, parental support, and\npeer support. With the addition of the school-level variables\ninto the Level-2 model (see Level-2 model in Model 3),\nsecurity climate and Safe Passage programs at the school level\nwere not found to be significantly associated with emotional\nvictimization. Contrary to our hypotheses, students attend-\ning schools with bullying prevention programs were more\nlikely to have experienced peer victimization (OR = 1.240).\n7. Conclusion and Discussion\nThe current study investigated individual- and school-level\ndifferences in bullying victimization among peers in school.\nWith respect to individual-level factors, both age and gender\nwere important predictors of different types of peer victim-\nization. Age had a positive effect on all three types of peer\nvictimization. This is consistent with the literature that peer\nvictimization appears to decrease with age; older students\nwere less likely to be victims of bullying than younger\nstudents [30, 35]. Gender also had an effect on all three types\nof peer victimization. Boys were more likely than girls to be\nvictims of physical bullying, but girls were more likely to be\nvictims of emotional bullying. These findings are consistent\nwith prior studies' conclusions that the type of victimization\nHowever, inconsistent with prior findings, race did not\nhave an impact on peer victimization. The current study\nfound no statistically significant difference across race. This is\ncontrary to our prediction that minority adolescents are more\nlikely to experience higher rates of bullying victimization,\ncompared to Caucasian adolescents [31]. Given that more\nthan half of the sample was in the non-white category, victim-\nization directed toward minority students may not be appar-\nent. Although existing bullying prevention programs address\nthe factors that may increase the risk of bullying across race,\nthey often do not take into account sociorelational contexts\nas important sources of adolescents' learning process that\ninfluence bullying behaviors. Spriggs et al. (2007) [33] argued\nthat the effects of family, peer, and school relationships on\nbullying involvement differ according to race. Being able to\nrecognize and address these differences across racial groups\nwill help to develop a better understanding of the dynamics\nof bullying victimization and to produce effective bullying\nprevention and intervention tailored to the populations being\nserved.\nBoth parental and peer support represent significant\npredictors of peer victimization. The finding that parental\nsupport was predictive of both types of peer victimization\nsuggests that parent-child interaction has a considerable\neffect on the likelihood of peer victimization. While parental\nsupport may play a protective role against peer victimization,\nlack of involvement and support from parents is likely to\nincrease the risk of bullying victimization [26]. Peer support\nalso was predictive of peer victimization, both physical and\nemotional. Negative peer relationships and lack of peer\nsupport may pose as risk factors conducive to bullying in\nschools [33, 37]. On the other hand, having peer support\nreduces the likelihood of peer victimization [58]. Finally,\nschool pressure had an effect on emotional victimization.\nThose facing a high level of school pressure are more likely to\nexperience negative emotions and to be involved in bullying,\nas an aggressor and a victim, compared to those with a low\nlevel of school pressure [59].\nOur prediction that students in schools with more secu-\nrity measures would be less likely to be victimized was not\nsupported by the study findings. It must be noted that the\nsecurity measure item contains elements that focus mainly\non security on school grounds and the physical safety of stu-\ndents. In order to improve school safety, schools have imple-\nmented security measures such as video cameras, bag/locker\nsearches, metal detectors, and other surveillance programs\n[42, 60]. Studies have found that peer bullying victimization\nis less likely to occur if schools increase the level of security\nand safety for students through adult monitoring [41, 61].\nFor instance, uniformed officers can be useful for deterring\nbullying behaviors, but the utility of the other components\nof security climate (e.g., visitor check-in, a closed campus) in\npreventing bullying is not well documented. Further, security\nmeasures are just one element of the school climate. Other\nelements, such as teachers' awareness of antibullying policies\nand strategies, can intervene to reduce peer victimization.\nSchools in which teachers are aware of school policies\non bullying victimization tend to have fewer incidents of\nbullying victimization [18]. Peer and teacher relations as\nwell as the degree of aggressiveness in a school climate are\nalso associated with bullying offending and victimization\n[41]. By improving several aspects of the school climate, a\ncomprehensive approach can be effective in reducing bullying\nvictimization and antisocial behavior [11].\nFor the school-level predictors, gang and bullying preven-\ntion programs were found to be significant predictors of peer\nvictimization. However, gang prevention had only a partial\neffect. Although gang prevention had an impact on emotional\n8  \nvictimization, it did not indicate any effect on physical victim-\nization. One possible explanation is that strategies for school-\nbased gang prevention (e.g., zero tolerance policies) may have\nproven to be ineffective in reducing physical victimization.\nFurthermore, whether or not school personnel are committed\nto implementing the program can be another important facet\nto consider. For example, the attitude of supervising teachers\nand staff members in supporting the prevention curriculum\nand communicating with the students can affect the overall\neffectiveness of these prevention programs [62, 63]. Teacher\nmonitoring is considered to be an important protective\nfactor against peer victimization because the likelihood of\nstudents reporting bullying incidents depends on teachers\nresponsiveness [64].\nSurprisingly, bullying prevention had a negative effect\non peer victimization. Contrary to our hypothesis, students\nattending schools with bullying prevention programs were\nmore likely to have experienced peer victimization, compared\nto those attending schools without bullying prevention pro-\ngrams. It is possible that bullies have learned a variety of\nantibullying techniques but chose not to practice what they\nhave learned from the program. Sometimes, bullies maintain\ntheir dominant social status among peers in school. As a\nresult, the preventive strategies may become ineffective.\nThe other preventive measure, the Safe Passage program,\nhad no effect on the likelihood of peer victimization. As a\nprogram designed to support at-risk adolescents, the pro-\ngram's goal is to create a safe school environment by reducing\nvarious school problems [52]. However, we did not find any\nsignificant impact on peer victimization. Without knowing\nspecific details of the program, it is difficult to assess the\neffectiveness of the Safe Passage program.\nAlthough prior research suggests that school-level char-\nacteristics (such as school security or a preventive cur-\nriculum) may be influential in predicting the likelihood of\npeer victimization [17, 18, 38], it should be noted that the\neffectiveness of bullying prevention has yet to be proven. A\nmeta-analysis indicates that bullying prevention programs\nspecifically targeting at-risk youth were slightly effective in\nreducing bullying or violent behaviors on campus, but gener-\nally had a minimal effect on bullying and victimization [50].\nFuture direction needs to focus not merely on implemen-\ntation of bullying prevention but rather on its effectiveness.\nUsing a comprehensive approach (both an individual-level\nand a school-level approach), prevention efforts must move\nbeyond individual risk factors and focus on systemic change\nwithin the schools. Furthermore, given that bullying is a\nrelationship problem, researchers need to better identify\nthe bully-victim dynamics in order to develop prevention\nstrategies accordingly.\n8. Limitations and Future\nDirections for Research\nThe current study used multilevel modeling to address the\nneed to simultaneously examine the effect of individual-\nand school-level variables on peer victimization. This type\nof modeling allows one to determine the amount of vari-\nance in the dependent variable that is explained by the\nindividual-level factors (e.g., age, parental support) as well\nas school-level factors (e.g., security climate, preventive\nmeasure).\nA number of limitations in the current study must be\naddressed in future research. First, the cross-sectional nature\nof the study limits one from making a causal inference\nabout the relationship between individual- and school-level\nfactors and likelihood of peer victimization. Future studies\nneed to utilize a longitudinal design in investigating the\ntemporal ordering between the preventive measures and peer\nvictimization in schools. Second, no specific information\nconcerning the prevention measures, specifically bullying\nprevention and gang prevention programs, is provided. The\nHBSC data contain limited information about these bullying\nprevention programs. Future research needs to examine the\nspecific components of the prevention programs. Because the\npreventive measures in the current study were dichotomous,\nit is limited in understanding the impact of preventive\nstrategies on peer victimization. Lastly, while school bullying\namong adolescents can be categorized into different types\n(e.g., physical, verbal, relational, cyber) [65], the current study\nis limited to physical and emotional victimization. As a result,\nwe are not able to examine the distinct nature of the different\nforms of bullying and their relations with other factors.\nReferences\n[1] D. Finkelhor, H. Turner, R. Ormrod, and S. L.
