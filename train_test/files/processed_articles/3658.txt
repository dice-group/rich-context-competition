In\nthe context of death, grief typically consists of a series of cognitive-emotional symptoms\nincluding yearning for reunion, intrusive thoughts of the deceased, nostalgia, and intense\nsadness (Freed, Yanagihara, Hirsch, and Mann, 2009). To date, two divergent theories have\nbeen advanced in an effort to explain the evolutionary function of grief. The reunion theory\nEvolutionizing grief\nproposes that the proper domain of grief is the loss of a partner due to separation or\nestrangement rather than death (Archer, 2001; Bowlby, 1982). In this view, the function of\ngrief is to motivate efforts at reunion; grief in the context of the death of a partner is thus\nunderstood as an unavoidable by-product of a separation response that evolved to maintain\nfitness-enhancing relationships. The reorientation theory posits that grief following the\ndeath of a loved one is a unique functional process that evolved to cope with a terminal loss\nby facilitating disengagement from the deceased and reorientation to a new status through a\nprocess of reassessing plans, priorities, and relationships, while simultaneously signaling a\nWhile the reunion theory has been received relatively more favorably among clinical\nresearchers than the reorientation account, neither has been well integrated into the\nmainstream bereavement literature. Aside from differences in research focus (i.e., proximate\nvs. ultimate factors) and objectives (i.e., reducing subjective distress vs. understanding the\ntrait's evolution), bereavement scholars have argued that evolutionary theories have not been\nincorporated into bereavement research primarily because they lack conceptual clarity, and a\ncorresponding absence of clearly defined testable predictions. Some scholars have challenged\nproponents of evolutionary accounts of grief to empirically test their proposals in order to\nfurther their integration with existing theories, but these calls have, to date, remained largely\nThe aim of this paper is to showcase the potential contribution of an evolutionary\napproach to bereavement research by generating and testing novel predictions. Our goal is\nnot to adjudicate between the two existing evolutionary theories of grief. This is because we\nbelieve that neither the reunion nor the reorientation account alone provides a sufficiently\ncomprehensive explanation of the function of grief to accommodate all of the principal facets\nof the phenomenon. In our view, grief is a process that has two functions: First, in cases\nwhere reunion is possible, grief enhances the likelihood that it will occur, thus leveraging\nexisting investments in a valuable relationship and avoiding the time, energy, and\nopportunity costs of establishing a replacement relationship. Second, in cases where reunion\nis not possible \u00ad death of the relationship partner being the most definitive variant thereof \u00ad\ngrief facilitates the reconceptualization of the other as no longer a living, viable relationship\npartner, opening the door to investment in new relationships. Thus, grief may well consist of\nmultiple mechanisms, each of which produces particular symptoms in particular contexts.\nThis view of grief is consonant with large-scale longitudinal research showing that different\nsymptoms are characteristically evinced at different times in the process of grief, e.g.,\nyearning for reunion within the first 6 months, and acceptance between 7-12 months\n(Maciejewski, Zhang, Block, and Prigerson, 2007).\nA cognitive-evolutionary account of grief\nWe propose that the reunion and reorientation theories of grief can be consolidated\ninto a single cognitive account in which multiple evolved psychological mechanisms are\ndeployed when an individual is separated from a valued relationship partner. These include\nboth (1) mechanisms designed to promote reunion with a lost agent where this is possible\n(predominantly taking the form of symptoms such as yearning for reunion; see Bowlby,\n1982), and (2) when there is evidence that the valued other is deceased, mechanisms\ndesigned to promote coming to terms with the permanent loss of the other by disengagement\nEvolutionizing grief\nand reorientation to a new status without him or her (predominantly taking the form of\nsymptoms such as rumination and sadness; see Nesse, 2005).\nIf the above approach is correct, it should be possible to disaggregate grief into\nevolutionary meaningful subtypes, based on the postulated functions of the symptoms\nthemselves. In the present paper, we focus on factors that influence the operation of\nmechanisms designed to promote reunion with a lost agent. We propose that a mechanism\nthat functions to detect agents in the environment becomes hypervigilant following the loss\nof a valued relationship partner, in order to detect whether reunification with a specific agent\nis possible. This hypervigilance leads to an increase in `false positives': the extent to which\nenvironmental stimuli (e.g., sights, sounds) are misattributed as being caused by the lost\nagent. We term these phenomena false recognitions to distinguish these experiences, the\nattribution of stimuli to a specific agent, from the attribution of stimuli to a generic agent. We\npropose that false recognitions can be understood as an index that the bereavement process is\nincomplete, hindering the employment of mechanisms to disengage and reorient to a new\nstatus without the lost agent (see 2, above).\nTo sketch the logic of our enterprise in advance of the full exposition of our\ntheoretical framework, here we investigate three factors which, we propose, will impact the\nexperience of false recognitions. First, because the costs of failing to detect opportunities for\nreunion should scale with the value of the lost relationship, we predict that strong attachment\nto the deceased (a subjective proxy for relationship investment/value) will predispose the\nbereaved to experience false recognitions. Second, being hypervigilant is costly, and such\ncosts mount over time. Paralleling this, ceteris paribus, the probability that reunification will\noccur declines as a function of the passage of time. Together, these two considerations lead\nus to predict that the passage of time will diminish the experience of false recognitions.\nThird, photographs depicting the deceased while alive constitute evolutionarily novel stimuli.\nAccordingly, we expect that such photographs are treated to some degree by evolved\nmechanisms as veridical input, and are thus processed as cues that the deceased is present.\nThis leads to the prediction that viewing such photographs will increase the experience of\nfalse recognitions. Below, we lay out our theoretical framework in more complete detail.\nAgent hypervigilance\nBecause of their myriad implications for fitness, people are unconsciously biased\ntowards detecting cues of agency in the environment. The elicitation of agent-detection\nsystems has been interpreted in terms of error management theory, which predicts that\nnatural selection will bias the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli toward the less-costly\nerror: whether the situation is agonistic or cooperative, failing to detect an agent who is\npresent will generally be more costly than erroneously presuming that an agent is present\nwhen one is not, hence agent-detection mechanisms should be biased toward false positives\n2000). In addition to the baseline sensitivity towards agency that operates for humans\ngenerally, grief motivates the bereaved to seek out information indicating whether reunion\nwith a specific agent, a lost relationship partner, is possible (Archer and Winchester, 1994;\nexpected to be exceptionally vigilant towards detecting cues of the presence of a lost agent,\nin order to make two decisions: first, whether the target is present in the vicinity, and second,\nEvolutionizing grief\nwhether the target is alive and therefore still a viable relationship partner.\nFalse recognitions\nOne postulated consequence of the hypervigilance to cues of agency is the over-\ndetection of signs of the deceased agent in the environment. Recent neurobiological research\nsupports this claim. For example, recently bereaved pet owners demonstrate attentional bias\ntowards deceased-related words in Emotional Stroop tasks (Freed et al., 2009). Furthermore,\nanecdotal, descriptive and self-report data suggests that it is common for bereaved\nindividuals to interpret sights and sounds as having been caused by the deceased followed by\nthe disquieting realization then that the loved one is dead, especially in the first 12 months\nfollowing bereavement (Archer and Winchester, 1994; Maciejewski et al., 2007; Olson,\nSuddeth, Peterson, and Egelhoff, 1985; Weisman, 1990). The experiences are not (at least in\nelderly European populations) associated with depression or other psychological negative\nsymptoms, and are associated with long and happy relationships (Grimby, 1993). Despite\nthese facts, these experiences have been largely overlooked in conventional theories of grief\nand have not been deemed worthy of investigation in their own right.\nWe define false recognitions as the automatic misperception of external stimuli as\nbeing caused by a particular agent. To be clear, false recognitions are not hallucinations; they\ndo not occur in the absence of external, or relevant, stimuli and they are attributed as a\n`misperception' by the perceiver \u00ad the bereaved individual knows at a conscious level, after\nthe initial experience, that the sight or sound has not been produced by the deceased agent\n(see Aleman and Lar\u00f8i, 2008, for a sophisticated discussion of misperception). As we have\noutlined, in our view, false recognitions reveal the bereaved to be in a state of detecting\nwhether reunification with the lost agent is possible, and therefore to not have fully\nreconceptualized the deceased as no longer a living, viable relationship partner. From a\ncognitive perspective, false recognitions can thus be understood as an index that the grief\nprocess is incomplete. It appears that cognitive mechanisms responsible for quick-and-dirty\ninterpretation of stimuli, the so-called low-road aspects of perception, continue to represent\nthe deceased as an agent capable of producing sights and sounds that impinge on the\nobserver. At the same time, cognitive mechanisms responsible for slower, more reflective\nprocessing, the so-called high-road components of perception, no longer represent the agent\nin this manner \u00ad hence the disquieting conflict between the initial interpretation of sights or\nsounds as caused by the loved one, followed by the subsequent recollection that the loved\none is dead, and realization that the initial interpretation must be erroneous. Eventually,\nhowever, representations of the deceased become so sufficiently reformulated that their\ninfluence on relevant aspects of cognition becomes uniform \u00ad the loved one is represented as\nno longer a viable relationship partner at all levels of representation, with the result that\nsights and sounds are no longer perceived as stemming from the loved one, and the\nexperience of false recognition dissipates (Freed et al., 2009; Maciejewskiet al., 2007;\nPrigerson et al., 1995). At this time, the bereaved will disengage and reorient him- or herself\nto a new status without the lost agent.\nAs noted in our initial sketch, holding aside questions of their influence on other\naspects of the grief experience, we predict that three variables will impact upon the\nexperience of false positives in recently bereaved pet owners: attachment to the deceased,\ntime elapsed since death of significant other, and viewing images of the deceased depicting\nEvolutionizing grief\nthem while alive. Below, we explain the logic of each of these predictions in more detail.\nAttachment level to the deceased\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, not all relationships are equal, and therefore, not\nall efforts to recover a relationship will be equal. For example, the losses of genetically\nrelated relationships, and losses that occur to an individual when reproductive value is high\n(i.e., adolescent children) have been found to be the most painful (e.g., for research, see\nshould determine the level of grief response following bereavement is the amount of\ninvestment that has gone into the relationship (e.g., time, resources). Clinical research reveals\nthat the level of attachment to the deceased \u00ad a subjective proxy for relationship investment \u00ad\nis a good predictor of overall grief intensity (Archer and Winchester, 1994; Freed et al.,\n2009; Shear and Shair, 2005). These measures focus on the overall experience of grief,\nwhereas we are primarily interested in one cognitive component--false recognitions. We\npredict that the degree of relationship investment will also be a good predictor of the\ncognitive experience of grief.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, relationships are expensive. The start up costs for a\nnew relationship are large and there is no certainty that a new relationship will be found.\nTherefore, hastily giving up on a relationship reduces fitness, and the more that has been\ninvested in a relationship, the greater this reduction. More specifically, the start up costs for\nnew relationships must be weighed against both the likelihood of reunification with the lost\nagent and the amount of investment that has gone into the relationship. Where investment in\nthe relationship is especially high, replacement costs will likewise be high, and hence\nindividuals highly attached to the lost agent are expected to be even more vigilant regarding\ncues of the agent's continued presence, and to engage in extended `searching\nIrrespective of their behavior following bereavement, individuals who have a high degree of\ninvestment in another are likely to be predisposed towards the experience of false positives.\nTherefore, we predict that the level of attachment (a proxy for investment) will positively\ncorrelate with the extent of misattributions of ambiguous stimuli to the lost agent, such that\nthe experience of false recognitions will increase as a function of attachment.\nTime elapsed since the onset of bereavement\nGiven the costs of both searching and going without a relationship partner, for any\ngiven level of prior investment in a relationship with a missing partner, there must be an\ninflection point beyond which efficiency demands that the relationship be abandoned and a\nreplacement be sought. If a reunion-promoting adaptation exists, it must thus necessarily be\nthe case that the mechanism calculates the probability of reunion based on events to date \u00ad\nwithout such capabilities, the postulated mechanism would be grossly maladaptive, endlessly\nmotivating fruitless behavior. Indeed, bereavement research shows that individuals who\ncontinue to display attentional bias to reminders of the deceased after 18 months \u00ad i.e.,\n`complicated' grief (a condition affecting around 10% of the Western bereaved population) \u00ad\nincur significant physical and mental health problems and display impaired daily functioning\n(Maccallum and Bryant, 2010). We therefore predict that time elapsed since the onset of\nbereavement will constitute a diminishing factor, and thus will negatively correlate with the\nEvolutionizing grief\nextent of false recognitions.\nViewing photographic images of the deceased\nThere are many cues in the environment that suggest that a particular agent is in the\nimmediate vicinity--items of clothing, objects, agent smell, etc. Such cues vary in reliability.\nStimuli that involve faces and eyes are likely to be processed as the most reliable. Consonant\nwith the highly social nature of our species and the corresponding importance that social\ninteractions hold for fitness, the human mind contains agent and face detection mechanisms\n(Johnson, 2000). Importantly, the effects of the input provided by these systems to other\npsychological mechanisms are at least partly independent of propositional knowledge and are\nlikely to be highly reliable cues of agency. For example, in keeping with the importance in\nhuman societies of maintaining a positive reputation and avoiding punishment, a variety of\nexperiments document that images of eyes can promote prosocial behavior and inhibit\nantisocial behavior (Nettle et al., 2012; Nettle, Nott, and Bateson, 2012). The nature of the\nstimuli used in such experiments makes it clear that individuals' behavior is altered despite\nthe fact that, at an explicit level of consciousness, they are aware that drawings or posters of\neyes are not real agents. Moreover, research suggests that stimuli that activate agent systems\nand facial detection mechanisms are treated as highly reliable cues that a familiar other is\npresent. For example, neurobiological research reveals that viewing photographs of familiar\nothers activates facial recognition systems (i.e., personal identification networks) as though\nthe individuals viewed were physically present (Leveroni et al., 2000; Shah et al., 2001).\nInput suggesting that the deceased is alive will enhance the conflict between the old\nrepresentation of the loved one and the new representation to which the bereaved is\ntransitioning. Correspondingly, if false recognitions are a symptom of the degree of\nincompleteness of this process, then input suggesting that the deceased is alive will\nexacerbate the experience of false recognitions. Because realistic photographs and other\nmedia were not components of the stimulus environment in which the mechanisms\nunderlying grief evolved, they may be processed at least to some degree as veridical. It\ntherefore follows that exposure to such images will positively correlate with the experience\nof false recognitions. Just as in the case of images of watching eyes, the functioning of\nrelevant mental mechanisms will be affected by these evolutionarily novel stimuli despite\npropositional knowledge that they are inanimate, producing input that interferes with the\nprocess of forming new cognitive representations of the deceased. Thus, frequently viewing\nrealistic photographs of the deceased is likely to be a perpetuating factor in the experience of\nfalse recognitions, and hence this behavior will positively correlate with such experiences.\nInteractions between attachment, image-viewing behavior, and time elapsed\nThus far, we have outlined the predicted individual relationships between attachment\nlevel, elapsed time since the onset of bereavement, and viewing behavior on the extent of\nfalse recognitions, a cognitive symptom of grief. However, if we are to fully test the core\npredictions generated by our hypothesis, we must also consider the possible relationships of\nthese three factors to each other.\nFirst, we expect attachment level and frequency of viewing behavior to be positively\ncorrelated. As we have outlined, those highly attached are likely to be more motivated to\nseek out cues of the deceased. Thus, they are more likely to engage in viewing images of the\nEvolutionizing grief\ndeceased, when alive. We do not, however, expect attachment to perfectly correlate with the\nfrequency of viewing images. Bereavement research has shown that while the majority of\nthose highly attached to their deceased loved ones are more likely to engage in `searching\nbehaviors' (which we presume, here, would include revisiting photographs of them when\nalive), a significant minority avoid all reminders of the deceased \u00ad including viewing\nphotographic images of them (see Archer and Winchester, 1994; Freed et al., 2009).\nSecond, as we have outlined, elapsed time is a proxy for the probability of reunion,\nand thus engaging in reunion-seeking behaviors becomes increasingly maladaptive as time\npasses. Correspondingly, we expect a negative correlation between time and the frequency\nof revisiting reminders of the deceased, including images. Likewise, to the extent that\ntransitioning from hypervigilance to disengagement occurs over time, the passage of time\nshould be negatively correlated with attachment level.\nPredictions\nTo summarize the above discussion, our core predictions concerning the relationships\nbetween the predictor variables (frequency of viewing images, attachment, time elapsed) and\nthe key outcome variable (false recognitions) are as follows:\n1. Level of attachment will positively correlate with the extent of false recognitions.\n2. The frequency of viewing images will positively correlate with the extent of false\nrecognitions.\n3. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with the extent\nof false recognitions.\nOur secondary predictions concerning the relationships between the predictor variables\n(frequency of viewing images, attachment, time lapsed) are as follows:\n4. Attachment level and frequency of viewing behavior will be positively correlated.\n5. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with the\nfrequency of viewing images.\n6. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with\nattachment level.\nIt is important to note that, while our theory proposes a causal relationship between\nthe key predictor and outcome variables, our predictions concern only the associations\nbetween these variables, due to the naturalistic methodology we employ. While an\nassociation in the predicted direction is necessarily part of the causal story we propose, of\ncourse, correlation does not equal causation. In this paper, we make a preliminary\ncontribution to the testing of the causal claims by focusing on the correlations; namely, the\neffect of viewing photographs of the deceased, when alive, on the extent of false recognitions\nup to 24 months after the death of a loved one using a survey of bereaved pet owners. We\naddress this limitation in more detail in the discussion section.\nPet loss\nCultural beliefs and practices shape exposure to dying individuals, the preparation of\nthe remains of the deceased, interactions with the remains, representation of the deceased in\nthe afterlife, and exposure to photographs and films of the deceased. Likewise, beliefs and\nEvolutionizing grief\npractices also influence both the expression of grief and the appropriateness of death, dying,\nand grief as topics of discussion (see Rosenblatt, 1993). Compounding these complexities,\nthese factors likely covary with hospice and funerary practices (see Walter, 2005). As a\nconsequence of these considerations, it may well prove difficult to tease out the independent\neffects of exposure to different types of stimuli on the frequency of false recognitions\npredicted by the above framework. Accordingly, the present enterprise is best served by\nsidestepping these matters to the extent possible.\nBereavement following the death of a beloved pet offers a pragmatic solution to the\nabove methodological problem. Approximately 62% of U.S. households own a pet\n(McConnell, Brown, Shoda, Stayton, and Martin, 2011), around 70% of owners carry a\nphotograph of their pet on their person (Archer, 1997), and many report mistaking sights and\nsounds for their deceased pet during bereavement (Weisman, 1990). Archer (1997) argues\nthat pets can be understood as exploiting human responses that evolved to facilitate human\nrelationships, primarily (but not exclusively) those between parent and child. While\naccepting this general framework, we would temper it somewhat by noting the long history\nof mutualism between humans and domesticated animals (dogs being perhaps the paramount\ncase), suggesting a degree of mutualistic co-evolution rather than simply unidirectional\nparasitism (see Serpell, 1996). Although there are substantial differences between human-\nhuman and human-companion-animal relationships, what is important for the present study is\nthe extent to which both the investment process and the grief response are similar in both\nrelationship types. A wealth of research supports the claim that these two processes are\nremarkably similar, and, accordingly, much clinical research on bereavement uses pet loss as\na proxy for human grief. Specifically, people form strong attachments to their pets, such that\nthe death of a pet can elicit a grief response similar to that experienced following the loss of a\nfamily member (Clements, Benasutti, and Carmone, 2003).\nDespite this, at least at the national level, Western culture does not contain any\nnormative practices concerning the death of a pet, nor are there any mores concerning\ndiscussion of this topic; indeed, the absence of both institutionalized practices and explicit\nrecognition of the impact of pet death on pet owners constitutes a positive affordance from\nthe perspective of research, as, lacking other avenues with which to manage their distress,\nmany bereaved owners express a desire to share their experiences with others, as evidenced\nby pet loss forums and virtual pet cemeteries on the Internet.\nMethods\nParticipants\nVolunteers for an unpaid online survey on experiences associated with the death of a\npet were recruited through pet loss websites and forums (87%), and via flyers displayed in\nwaiting areas in veterinary practices in Belfast and Los Angeles (13%). Two hundred and\nforty-seven individuals participated; 83 participants were excluded because they failed to\ncomplete the online survey or did not meet the minimum criteria (were below the age of 18,\nresided in a country other than the U.S. or U.K., had owned their pet for less than 6 years,\nhad owned a pet other than a cat or dog, did not regard their pet as a `companion animal', had\nlost their pet more than 24 months prior to participation or did not have any photographs of\ntheir pet). This left a sample of 164 bereaved pet owners (133 female, 31 male; age range\nEvolutionizing grief\n18\u00ad67, mean age 35); most participants lived in the United States (72%; United Kingdom,\n28%). See Table 1 for participant descriptive information.\nMaterials\nThe survey was created using the platform SurveyMonkey. Survey items addressed\ndemographic information about the participants and their pet, and the circumstances\nsurrounding their pet's death. All participants included in the study possessed photographs\nof their pet that were taken when the pet was alive. Participants were asked whether, and how\noften, they viewed these images after their pet's death (on a 5 point scale: daily, weekly,\nmonthly, on special occasions, never). Participants also completed the 23-item Lexington\nAttachment to Pets Scale (LAPS; Johnson, Garrity, and Stallones, 1992), responding to items\non a 4-point scale (ranging from definitely applies to me to definitely does not apply to me)\nthat measures emotional attachment to a pet, with a higher score denoting a higher level of\nsubjective attachment; this scale has high internal validity and is the most popular\nquestionnaire amongst clinical researchers for the assessment of pet attachment.\nThere is no standardized questionnaire that measures false recognitions exclusively.\nResearchers have included individual items in previous questionnaires that address aspects of\nour dependent variable, i.e., false recognitions \u00ad such as yearning for reunion and searching\nbehaviors. Therefore, we used a combination of pre-existing items and novel items designed\nto measure false recognitions (see Appendix 1). Specifically, we assessed false recognitions\nusing six statements addressing the extent to which, in the past two weeks, participants had\ninterpreted ambiguous stimuli (e.g., sights, sounds) as the deceased pet. Items addressed\nexperiences such as often believing that one saw or heard the pet, and often mistaking\nanother pet for one's own. Three items were taken directly from the 29-item Pet Loss\nQuestionnaire (PLQ) developed by Archer and Winchester (1994). To increase breadth, we\nadded three novel items. Following the PLQ, participants responded using a 3-point scale,\nranging from applies to me to does not apply to me (see Appendix 1). A higher score on the\nscale denotes the frequent experience of misperceiving stimuli as being caused by the\ndeceased pet in multiple modalities (e.g., sight, sound). Although we did not measure the\nfrequency of such experiences directly, agreement that experiences often happened was taken\nas a proxy for a high degree of multiple instances of false recognitions (e.g., sights, sounds,\netc). Our six-item scale, which we term the False Recognition Questionnaire, has excellent\ninternal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient .92).\nResults\nDemographics\nAll participants had lost a pet through death within 24 months of completing the\nsurvey (study criteria). Most participants (100, or 61%) had lost their pet between 3 and 12\nmonths prior to participation, and 64 participants (39%) had lost their pet between 13 and 24\nmonths in the past. One hundred and seven participants (65%) had lost a dog and 57\nparticipants (35%) had lost a cat.\nViewing images of pet\nAll participants possessed photographs of their pet taken before its death (study\nEvolutionizing grief\ncriteria). Sufficient variance in the key independent variable existed for us to test our core\nprediction: while slightly more than half of the participants (95, 58%) viewed these images\nfrequently \u00ad ranging from daily to weekly basis, many participants (70, 42%) viewed them\ninfrequently or not at all \u00ad ranging from monthly, to special occasions, to yearly.\nLexington Attachment to Pets Scale\nThe maximum possible score on the LAPS is 69. Among U.S. pet owners in general,\nthe average score is 45. The scale is more adept at measuring strong pet attachment because\nthe majority of the items are indicators of intense attachment (Johnson et al., 1992); hence a\nscore of 45 indicates a strong attachment to the pet. Participants' scores on the LAPS\nquestionnaire varied greatly (19-69), with a normal distribution of scores, but most\nparticipants were very strongly attached to their pet (M = 52, SD = 11). This is likely to have\nbeen a result of targeting participants via pet loss forums and websites, as individuals who\nfrequent such sites are likely to have had strong emotional ties to their pets. Given that we\nemploy bereavement in the context of pet death as a model system for bereavement in the\ncontext of human death, this bias is an asset, as it makes the sample more comparative to\nhuman loss in terms of attachment levels.\nFalse Recognition Questionnaire\nThe maximum possible score on the False Recognition Questionnaire, assessing the\nextent of false recognitions, is 18. Scores on the False Recognition Questionnaire ranged\nbetween 6 and 18 (M = 10, SD = 4, with a normal distribution of scores). This suggests that\nmany participants experienced false recognitions up to 24 months following their pet's death.\nTable 1.

Correlation coefficients were computed for continuous\nand categorical variables (categorical variables were dichotomized as displayed in Table 1).\nImportant predictor variables were level of attachment, frequency of viewing images, and\ntime.\nRelationships between predictor and outcome variable\nAs Table 2 shows, several variables correlated significantly with scores on the False\nRecognition Questionnaire, and all relationships were moderate. As per Prediction 1, there\nwas a positive correlation between attachment level, r (162) = .357, p < .01 and false\nrecognition scores, r (162) = .331, p < .01. There was also a significant positive correlation\nbetween the frequency of viewing images and false recognition scores, r (162) = .331, p <\n.01, confirming Prediction 2. Time elapsed since pet's death was significantly negatively\ncorrelated with false recognition scores, r (162) = -.199, p < .05, confirming Prediction 3.\nRelationships between predictor variables\nIn line with our secondary predictions, there were significant correlations between the\nthree main predictor variables. As per Prediction 4, there was a moderate positive correlation\nbetween attachment scores and frequency of viewing images, r (162) = .393, p < .01. There\nwas also a negative correlation between time elapsed and frequency of viewing images, r\n(162) = -.260, p < .01, and a negative correlation between time elapsed and attachment\nMultiple regression analyses\nWe examined the extent to which variance in scores on the False Recognition\nQuestionnaire was predicted by a) frequency of viewing images, b) elapsed time since pet's\ndeath, and c) the level of attachment to pet. Multiple regression was used to analyze the\ncontribution of each of the three variables to false recognition scores and to weigh the\naccuracy with which the frequency of viewing images predicts false recognition scores\nrelative to the contributions of attachment and elapsed time.\nPreliminary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the assumptions of\nnormality, linearity, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity. Using the enter method, a\nvariance explained by the model was 16.8%. The frequency of viewing images made the\nstrongest unique contribution ( = .539), which was statistically significant (p <. 01);\nfrequency of viewing images of the pet predicted higher false recognitions scores. The LAPS\nscore also made a unique, albeit smaller, contribution ( = .082), which was statistically\nsignificant (p < .01); specifically, higher attachment scores predicted higher false\nrecognitions scores. Time elapsed since pet's death was not a significant independent\npredictor of false recognitions scores ( = -.040, p = .201). Although the correlations among\npredictor variables were moderate, given the importance of the relationship between these to\nour account, we conducted collinearity diagnostics. Results suggested that there was no\nproblem with collinearity in the data (all VIF levels were low, < 2.0).\nEvolutionizing grief\nTable 2.

We argue that distinct\nmechanisms have evolved that, on the one hand, promote reunion with the lost agent, and, on\nthe other, when reunion is not possible, promote disengagement with the lost agent and\nreorientation to a new status without the agent. With this as an overarching theoretical\nframework, we investigated the functioning of one discrete cognitive mechanism--agent\ndetection--that becomes heightened when an agent is lost, and serves, in this context, to\ndetermine whether a specific agent is in the vicinity and, therefore, still a viable relationship\npartner. We hypothesized that this agent detection hyperactivity leads to a commonly\nreported experience in those recently bereaved, namely that of misinterpreting ambiguous\nstimuli (sights, sounds) as having been caused by the deceased agent, a phenomenon that we\nterm false recognition. We proposed that the frequency of false recognitions is an indication\nof the extent to which the mechanisms designed to promote disengagement with the lost\nagent and reorientation to a life without them have yet to be fully activated. In short, the\ncontinued presence of false recognitions is an index that a principal transition in the\nbereavement process, from the operation of reunification mechanisms to the operation of\nreorientation mechanisms, has yet to be achieved.\nWe sought to investigate the factors that affect the functioning of the agent-detection\nmechanism, enhancing or diminishing the experience of false recognitions, and thus\npotentially retarding the grief process. Using bereavement following the death of a pet as a\nmodel system, we examined three variables: attachment (a subjective proxy for relationship\ncommitment/value), the frequency of viewing photographic images depicting the deceased\nwhile alive, and the time elapsed since the death of the deceased.\nAttachment to the pet, frequency of viewing images of the pet, and the recency of the\npet's death all positively predicted the frequency of the experience of false recognitions.\nDespite the complexity of the relationships between the variables examined, the strongest\npredictor of false recognition was the frequency of viewing photographs of the deceased.\nViewing behavior made the largest unique contribution, such that level of attachment and\ntime elapsed since death could be removed and this factor would still accurately, and\nEvolutionizing grief\nindependently, predict scores on the false recognition questionnaire. This pattern is\nconsonant with our premise that photographic images, being evolutionarily novel, are in part\nprocessed as veridical, serving as a cue that the bereaved is in the vicinity, and thus\nperpetuating the experience of false positive responses to more ambiguous stimuli. Further\nresearch is needed to examine the discrete effects of realistic images as compared to the\ninfluence on false recognitions of exposure to other reminders of the deceased or estranged\nagents (e.g., clothing, smells).\nLimitations and future directions\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate false recognitions as a\ncognitive component of the grief process and the determinants thereof. Likewise, to our\nknowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects on the bereaved of viewing\nphotographic images of the deceased. For a number of reasons, our findings should be\nconsidered preliminary. Some of the limitations of this study are characteristic of\nbereavement research in general, and these are difficult to overcome in naturalistic studies\n(Stroebe, Stroebe, and Hansson, 1993). In addition to the use of pet loss as a model system,\nsuch limitations include using questionnaire methods that necessarily constrain our ability to\nunderstand the direction of causality. We have provided evidence for associations that may\nnot be caused by our predictor variables in the hypothesized direction. For example, absent\ndetailed chronologies, we cannot rule out the possibility that false recognitions cause the\nbereaved to seek out reminders of the deceased, leading to increased viewing of photographs.\nFuture experimental research could begin to tease these apart by, for example, manipulating\nthe amount of exposure to photographs and other cues of estranged agents while controlling\nor accounting for other variables.\nFurther, our sample is not representative of the general population of bereaved pet\nowners. It was limited to bereaved individuals in complex, English-speaking societies who\nhave access to the Internet, many of whom were actively searching for opportunities to\ncommunicate with others about their loss, and who, correspondingly, were more attached to\ntheir pets than the general bereaved population. Such individuals may well have been drawn\nto seek out reminders of their deceased pets. Thus, perhaps we have missed an important\nsection of the community who are highly attached and yet avoidant of reminders.\nFollowing the precedent of prior instruments from which it was derived, our False\nRecognition Questionnaire employed self-reported agreement (i.e., strongly applies to me) in\na range of situations depicting false recognitions (e.g., sometimes, I hear my pet). We did\nnot, therefore, measure the exact frequency of false recognitions. Additionally, we did not\nmeasure situational variables that could have been accounted for, such as the extent to which\nthe bereaved individual kept photos of the pet on display prior to the pet's death (making\nsubsequent viewing of photographs a matter of habit rather than an outgrowth of grief), as\nwell as features of the environment (e.g., the presence of other animals, etc.) likely to shape\nexposure to ambiguous stimuli.\nThe experience of false recognitions has largely been overlooked in the conventional\ngrief literature. This may reflect a Western cultural bias where these types of experiences are\nstigmatized as abnormal despite evidence that they occur frequently during bereavement.\nSuch stigma is likely culturally parochial (see, for example Yamamoto, Okonogi, Iwasaki,\nand Yoshimura, 1969, on bereavement in Japan), and thus cross-cultural research may allow\nEvolutionizing grief\nfor more direct study of false recognition in the context of human, rather than pet, death.\nOur theory of grief incorporates the tenets of the reunion theory. Correspondingly,\nwe expect false recognition to occur during grief following the loss of a relationship for\nreasons other than death. For example, non-acrimonious dissolution of a romantic\nrelationship or the extended separation of the parties (e.g., military families, etc.) should be\naccompanied by a yearning for reunion, with a corresponding increase in false recognitions.\nWe expect this pattern to be exacerbated by frequently viewing images of the departed agent,\nand to cease when the individual returns.\nImplications of our research\nAlthough our findings should be considered preliminary, nonetheless, they provide\nreason for caution with regard to the clinical recommendation for the recently bereaved to\nrevisit mementos (especially photographs) of the deceased when they experience yearning\nfor reunion. Bereavement clinicians have actively prescribed such actions under a new\nparadigm that encourages `continuing bonds' with the deceased (Klass, Silverman, and\nNickman, 1996), despite what is, at best, only equivocal evidence that this has a positive\neffect on overall grief outcomes (Stroebe, Abakoumkin, Storebe, and Schut, 2011; Stroebe\nand Schut, 2005). Frequently revisiting mementos and viewing photographs of the deceased\nmay indeed provide immediate reward, as neurobiological research suggests that this may\nactivate dopamine release and therefore temporarily enhance feelings of well-being (Freed\nand Mann, 2007). However, our research suggests that such actions may delay the transition\nfrom a grief phase characterized by a yearning for reunion to a phase characterized by\ndisengaging from representations of the deceased as a viable relationship partner, and\nreorientation to a new status that does not involve the lost agent but includes new\nrelationships with the living. More than a century ago, Freud (1914/1951) fiercely argued for\nthe removal of reminders of the deceased in order for the bereaved to successfully detach.\nDespite the profound problems with many aspects of his model of the mind, it appears that,\nin this instance, Freud may have been right after all.\n"
