    "abstract": "Abstract\nFront-line staff in long-term care (LTC) homes often form strong emotional bonds with residents. When residents die,\nstaffs' grief often goes unattended, and may result in disenfranchised grief. The aim of this article is to develop, implement,\nand assess the benefits of a peer-led debriefing intervention to help staff manage their grief and provide LTC homes an\norganizational approach to support them. This research was nested within a 5-year participatory action research to develop\nand implement palliative care programs within four LTC homes in Canada. Data specific to this debriefing intervention\nincluded questionnaires from six peer debriefers, field observations of six debriefings, and qualitative interviews with 23 staff\nparticipants. An original peer-led debriefing intervention (INNPUT) for LTC home staff was developed and implemented.\nData revealed that the intervention offered staff an opportunity to express grief in a safe context with others, an opportunity\nfor closure and acknowledgment. The INNPUT intervention benefits staff and offers an innovative, sustainable, easy to use\nstrategy for LTC homes.\n",

A recent study (Osterlind,\nHansebo, Andersson, Ternestedt, & Hellstrom, 2011) recog-\nnizes the discourse of silence surrounding death and dying in\nLTC, noting that staff keep death at a distance by concentrat-\ning on tasks and routines. Emotions are pushed to the back-\nground, and death is surrounded by silence (Cocco, Gatti, de\nMendon\u00e7a Lima, & Camus, 2003; Hopkinson, Hallett, &\nThis experience has been well documented in the litera-\nture as disenfranchised grief (Black & Rubenstein, 2004;\nBoerner, Burack, Jopp, & Mock, 2015; Slocum-Gori,\nHemsworth, Chan, Carson, & Kazanjian, 2013; Thompson\n& Bevan, 2015). Unregulated health care professionals as\nidentified in the Osterlind et al. (2011) study are direct care\nstaff in LTC homes who provide multidimensional (physical,\nemotional, spiritual, and social) care to residents. Due to the\nencompassing and time-consuming nature of their caregiv-\ning roles, the relationships that form between front-line staff\nand nursing home residents can be extremely close, and in\nsome instances forged over years of providing intimate care\nresidents may be equivalent to the deaths of family members,\nevoking strong grief reactions that are compounded with\neach accumulated loss. The failure to acknowledge the rela-\ntionships between staff and residents, and the denial of deaths\nin nursing homes, may preclude direct care staff from effec-\ntively moving through their grief process (Anderson &\nto promote policies and practices that support a healthy\ngrieving process for staff, and to implement innovative strat-\negies to validate, enfranchise, and improve the process of\nworking through the disenfranchised grief that direct care\nstaff may experience after the death of LTC home residents.\n1Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nJo-Ann Vis, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Road, Thunder Bay, ON, P7B\nEmail: jvis@lakeheadu.ca\nDeveloping and Implementing Peer-Led\nIntervention to Support Staff in Long-\nTerm Care Homes Manage Grief\nJo-Ann Vis1, Kimberley Ramsbottom1, Jill Marcella1, Jessica McAnulty1,\nMary Lou Kelley1, Katherine Kortes-Miller1, and Kristen Jones-Bonofiglio1\n Keywords\nlong-term care homes, grief, peer-led debriefing, palliative care, unregulated care provider, front-line staff\n2 SAGE Open\nBased on the above-mentioned research, there is consen-\nsus that in fact front-line staff may experience disenfran-\nchised grief, which in turn impacts their mental health and\nwell-being. The new matter, then, is how to effectively sup-\nport direct care staff in assisting them to manage and prevent\ndisenfranchised grief symptoms.\nDirect care staff, consisting of registered nurses (RNs),\nregistered practical nurses (RPNs), and front-line staff (often\nreferred to in the literature as personal support workers,\nhealth care aids, nurse's aides, or nursing assistants) who\nwork in LTC homes, can expect to experience the effects of\nloss and grief as a result of the death of residents for whom\nthey have provided care. Front-line staff in particular provide\ndaily care and form significant relationships with residents\nand their families.Although the issue of managing disenfran-\nchised grief is important for all direct care staff, this article\nfocuses specifically on the front-line worker. For the pur-\nposes of this article, the generic term unregulated care\nprovider(s) (UCP) will be used to describe the front-line\nworker responsible for the majority of the resident's daily\nhealth care needs.\nObjective\nThe concept of disenfranchised grief has been well researched\nand supported in the literature. This article builds on the\nresearch and literature concerning disenfranchised grief by\ndeveloping an intervention aimed to mitigate its effects on\nUCP in LTC homes.\nThere are two objectives that this article is reporting on.\nThe first objective was to develop an organizational inter-\nvention based on current literature and in collaboration with\nUCPs, aimed to ease the effects of grief and prevent disen-\nfranchised grief. The second objective was to gauge the per-\nceived benefit of the developed intervention tool (INNPUT)\nthrough the use of follow-up qualitative questionnaires, indi-\nvidual interviews, and transcript review of participants'\nfeedback.\nContext and Method of the Research\nin Ontario, Canada, with the purpose of improving the quality\nof life for people who are dying in LTC by creating formalized\npalliative care programs that can be sustained within the LTC\nhomes beyond completion of the project (see www.pallia-\ntivealliance.ca). The project was completed through the col-\nlaboration and active participation of four key partners:\nLakehead University, McMaster University, St. Joseph's Care\nGroup, and the Municipalities of Halton and Niagara. These\npartners created the Quality Palliative Care in Long Term Care\n(QPC-LTC) Alliance, consisting of 25 researchers and 40\norganizations, to help facilitate the project goals. The over-\narching goal of this project was to develop palliative care pro-\ngrams, using Kelley's capacity development model for LTC\nand a participatory action research (PAR) approach (Kelley &\nMcKee, 2013). A toolkit, available on the project website, was\ncreated that includes a framework for developing palliative\ncare in LTC and more than 40 research-informed innovations,\ninterventions, tools, and resources that support development\nof palliative care in LTC homes.\nIn the health services context, PAR is a relatively new\napproach that brings a social science perspective to knowl-\nedge creation to describe, interpret, and explain caregiving as\nsocial rather than medical phenomena. PAR can generate\nboth practical and theoretical knowledge, and is able to vali-\ndate old theories or generate new theories from practice\n(Webb, 1989). Action research differs from more conven-\ntional research paradigms in three ways: its understanding\nand use of knowledge, its relationship with research partici-\npants, and the introduction of change into the research pro-\ncess (Hockley, Dewar, & Watson, 2005). The goal of PAR is\nto create social change in relation to a desired goal through\nthe empowerment of affected people. The empowerment\nprocess, the change process, and its outcomes are systemati-\ncally documented through a variety of data collection meth-\nods before, after, and throughout the research process.\nKnowledge is co-created by the researcher and participants\nthrough a reflective spiral of activity: identifying a problem,\nplanning a change, acting and observing the process and con-\nsequences of the change, reflecting on these processes and\nconsequences, and preplanning, acting, observing, and\nreflecting (repeating the cycle; Kemmis & McTaggart,\n2000). In this research, PAR was an appropriate methodol-\nogy as it reveals greater complexity than other methods and\ncan create social change (Kelley & McKee, 2013). It also\nrecognizes the existing expertise of LTC staff and promotes\nintegration of palliative care into current practices.\nConcepts such as inquiry, learning, participation, and\nchange were used as part of a process through which the\nUCPs were encouraged to share their knowledge about dis-\nenfranchised grief and its effects. Acknowledging and vali-\ndating the staff's knowledge and experience provided\nvaluable research and insight to create change opportunities\nthat will be sustainable over time. This process, one that\nencourages mutual respect for knowledge and shared dia-\nlogue, is part of a PAR process that offers a unique approach\nto organizational success (Foley, 2001).\nPAR emphasizes the importance of recognizing existing\nknowledge, and advocates for conversations that encourage\nin the concept of participatory interaction and learning, recog-\nnizing the implications for this type of learning interaction and\ndialogue when organizations attempt to implement and sustain\nchange (Kelley & McKee, 2013). The participatory research\nmethod gathers existing internal knowledge and collective\nideas, and facilitates collaborative constructions. It was these\nongoing collaborative constructions with the UCPs, combined\nVis et al. 3\nwith research literature that informed the development of the\nINNPUT intervention.\nTo develop the QPC-LTC framework and toolkit, the fol-\nlowing five-step process was used: needs assessment, engag-\ning community partners, developing innovations,\nimplementing and documenting innovations, and creating a\ntoolkit. In 2009, as a first step, an environmental scan was\nconducted, with the results indicating that the UCPs in LTC\nhomes repeatedly reported a development of close personal\nrelationships with the residents. These same staff also stated\nthey experience tremendous loss and grief when a resident\ndies. Consequently, a sub-study was undertaken, aiming to\nbetter understand staff's grief experience and to identify their\nperceived support needs (Marcella & Kelley, 2015). The\nfindings, similar to that of the research by Waskiewich, Funk,\nand Stajduhar (2012), indicated that the UCP's experiences\nwith loss and grief are complex, much shaped by the emo-\ntional impact of each loss, the cumulative burden of ongoing\ngrief, and the organizational culture in LTC. The study iden-\ntified several recommendations, among them the implemen-\ntation of organizational procedures to support staff dealing\nwith loss and grief, the implementation of organizational\nstrategies and rituals to acknowledge all residents who die in\nthe LTC home, and supporting staff with time and resources\nto reach out to colleagues after the death of a resident to\nacknowledge their loss and grief. Staff strongly indicated the\ndesire to be supported by their own peers and did not want\nexternal grief counselors introduced (Marcella & Kelley,\nResearch Method for Developing the INNPUT\nIntervention\nThe INNPUT intervention evolved as an additional cycle\nthrough the continued practice of PAR within the framework\nof the QPC-LTC project. Front-line staff were highly moti-\nvated to participate in addressing their identified need for\ngrief support.\nUCPs working in two of the project's LTC homes partici-\npated in implementing and documenting the benefits of the\nINNPUT intervention. Several UCPs consulted on the devel-\nopment, volunteered to be trained as peer-led debriefers, and\nparticipated in the implementation by promoting the debrief-\nings with their peers.\nAs noted by Crawford and Bath (2013), \"peer driven\nresearch and equitable involvement in research development\nshould be undertaken to ensure that the needs of the PSW\n(UCP)s and peer organizations are better understood\" (p. 579).\nThrough the research, UCPs identified needing a peer support\nintervention after the death of a resident. Collaboration\nbetween research staff was continual throughout the develop-\nment of the intervention, ensuring that the peer support con-\ntext would be effective. Once the intervention was established,\neducation was provided to volunteer UCPs to become facili-\ntators of the intervention. Implementation of six peer-led\ninterventions was completely facilitated by peer leaders, with\nthe research staff in presence only as an observer.Atotal of 21\npages of field notes, seven informal personal interviews aver-\naging 20 to 30 min in length, 74 pages of transcription notes,\nand six packages of qualitative and quantitative survey evalu-\nations were completed by the peer leaders after each\nintervention.\nBecause UCPs comprise the majority of direct care staff\nin LTC homes (Sharkey, 2008), seeking out their expertise\nthroughout the research process was vital in developing an\nintervention for grief support that would meet the needs\nidentified by the staff. Therefore, PAR offered a method\nthrough which expertise was sought to determine issues, as\nwell as solutions to managing unresolved disenfranchised\ngrief. As a result of the above-mentioned sub-study, the con-\ncept of a peer-led debriefing intervention was seen as a\npotential approach to provide staff with the opportunity to\nreceive the necessary education, take a step back from the\nemotionally stressful event of a resident death, and have their\nloss acknowledged. To ensure rigor, the experience and feed-\nback of the UCPs were supported by academic literature.\nThe need to examine information concerning disenfran-\nchised grief and potential debriefing interventions was evi-\ndent. Based on the current literature, it was determined that\nthe effects of disenfranchised grief could be mitigated\nthrough a peer debriefing intervention that incorporates edu-\ncation, "
