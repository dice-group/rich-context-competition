    "reduced_content": "Considerable attention has been gar-\nnered by the concept that health care\naccess and utilization are major deter-\nminants of health outcomes for patients\nwith diabetes. For example, the Diabetes\nQuality Improvement Project was created\nin 1998 because of the perception that dia-\nbetes care in America is suboptimal and\nthat patients with diabetes are not receiving\ncare thought to be beneficial (1). This\nmajor project, sponsored by many organi-\nzations involved with diabetes, is designed\nto increase the level of care provided to\npatients with diabetes and to improve the\naccountability of health care systems.\nHealth outcomes for patients with\ndiabetes do appear to be suboptimal, in\nthat blindness, renal failure, lower-extrem-\nity amputations, ischemic heart disease,\nand stroke are common in these patients\n(2). However, these end-stage complica-\ntions result only after a long duration of\ndiabetes and thus, are occurring in patients\nwho were diagnosed and received much\nof their medical care many years ago.\nThe current contribution of health care\naccess and medical care to the develop-\nment of adverse health outcomes in dia-\nbetes versus the contributions of patient\nself-care practices, provider care prac-\ntices, and inherent biological factors\nremains to be determined.\nCertain data indicate that health care\naccess may not be a major determinant of\nthe health status of patients with type 2\ndiabetes. In a representative group of U.S.\npatients, there was no relationship of\nglycemic control to having health insur-\nance or number of physician visits per year\n(3). In the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study\n(UKPDS), only a small difference in mean\nwas achieved between the group of\npatients who were intensively treated com-\npared with the group less intensively\ntreated (4). Physician specialty, particu-\nlarly whether the physician is an endocri-\nnologist, was reported to have little impact\non quality of care, as measured by\nglycemic control, blood pressure control,\nor microalbuminuria (5).\nTo investigate the current relationship\nbetween medical care and health status\nand outcomes, we analyzed questionnaire,\nclinical, and laboratory data for a repre-\nsentative sample of patients with type 2\ndiabetes in phase 2 of the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III). The health outcomes stud-\nied were those that would be expected to\nbe influenced by recent medical care, such\nas hyperglycemia, albuminuria, hyperten-\nsion, and dyslipidemia.\nFrom the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health,\nBethesda, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Maureen I.

Structured questionnaires and clinical and laboratory assessments were used to\ndetermine the frequencies of physician visits, health insurance coverage, screening for diabetes\ncomplications, treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; and the propor-\ntion of patients who met treatment goals and established criteria for health outcome measures\nincluding hyperglycemia, albuminuria, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\nRESULTS -- Almost all patients had 1 source of primary care (95%), 2 or more physician vis-\nits during the past year (88%), and health insurance coverage (91%). Most (76%) were treated\nwith insulin or oral agents for their diabetes, and 45% of those patients taking insulin moni-\ntored their blood glucose at least once per day. The patients were frequently screened for\nretinopathy (52%), hypertension (88%), and dyslipidemia (84%). Of those patients with hyper-\ntension, 83% were diagnosed and treated with antihypertensive agents and only 17% were\nundiagnosed or untreated; most of the patients known to have dyslipidemia were treated with\nmedication or diet (89%). Health status and outcomes were less than optimal: 58% had HbA\nthose patients known to have hypertension and dyslipidemia, 60% were not controlled to\naccepted levels. In addition, 22% of patients smoked cigarettes, 26% had to be hospitalized dur-\ning the previous year, and 42% assessed their health status as fair or poor.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Rates of health care access and utilization, screening for diabetes com-\nplications, and treatment of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes are\nhigh; however, health status and outcomes are unsatisfactory. There are likely to be multiple rea-\nsons for this discordance, including intractability of diabetes to current therapies, patient self-care\npractices, physician medical care practices, and characteristics of U.S. health care systems.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nHarris\nprobability sample of the U.S. population.\nParticipants were interviewed in their\nhomes and were given a standardized set of\nexaminations and laboratory measurements\nin an examination center. There were 8,420\nparticipants 25 years of age or older, of\nwhom 804 had been diagnosed with dia-\nbetes before the survey. Women with dia-\nbetes diagnosed only during pregnancy (n =\n55) and subjects with type 1 diabetes,\ndefined as those with age at diagnosis 30\nyears who had continuous insulin use since\ndiagnosis (n = 13), were deleted from the\nanalysis. The remaining 733 subjects were\nconsidered to have type 2 diabetes.\nInformation was obtained by structured\nquestionnaires on health insurance, use of\nphysician services, diabetes therapy, self-\nmonitoring of blood glucose levels, fre-\nquency of dilated eye examinations,\nfrequency of blood pressure and blood cho-\nlesterol screening, self-assessed health sta-\ntus, hospitalizations, and cigarette smoking.\nUse of medications for treatment of hyper-\ntension and dyslipidemia was ascertained\nby self-report and by examination of pre-\nscription medicine containers and recording\nof the name of the medicine by the inter-\nviewer. Measurements of height, weight,\n, urine albumin and creatinine, blood\npressure, lipids, and homocysteine were\nmade during a separate clinical examination\nin which 90.5% of the interviewed subjects\nparticipated. HbA\nwas measured by a\nhigh-performance liquid chromatographic\nassay as used in the Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial. Urine albumin was\nmeasured by a solid-phase fluorescent\nimmunoassay (6). Urine creatinine was\nmeasured by a Jaffe rate reaction in which\ncreatinine reacts with picrate in an alkaline\nsolution to form a creatinine-picrate com-\nplex, which was read with an ASTRA clini-\ncal analyzer (Beckman Instruments,\nFullerton, CA). Microalbuminuria was\ndefined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine\nwas defined as a urinary albumin-to-creati-\nnine ratio of 300 \u00b5g/mg. Blood pressure\nwas measured with a standard mercury\nsphygmomanometer. Up to 3 measure-\nments during the household interview and\nup to 3 measurements during the physical\nexamination were made, with the partici-\npant in the sitting position after 5 min of\nrest. The means of all systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures were used to evaluate\nhypertension. Hypertension was defined as\nsystolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or\ndiastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or\ntreatment with antihypertensive medica-\ntion. Serum total cholesterol was measured\nenzymatically (7) using a commercially\navailable reagent mixture (Cholesterol/HP;\nBoehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indi-\nanapolis, IN). HDL cholesterol was mea-\nsured in supernatants after the precipitation\nof apolipoprotein B\u00adcontaining lipoproteins\nwith heparin-manganese chloride and the\nremoval of excess manganese by precipita-\ntion with sodium bicarbonate (8). Triglyc-\nerides were analyzed enzymatically using\ncommercially available reagents (Agent\nTriglycerides Reagent Set; Abbott Laborato-\nries, Chicago). LDL cholesterol was calcu-\nlated using the Friedewald equation for\nthose subjects with triglyceride 400 mg/dl\n(9); dyslipidemia was defined as LDL cho-\nlesterol 130 mg/dl or treatment with pre-\nscribed diet or medication.\nDefinitions of treatment goals and\nabnormal values for HbA\n, proteinuria,\nobesity, blood pressure, blood lipids, and\nhomocysteine are those recommended by\nthe American Diabetes Association; the Joint\nNational Committee on Detection, Evalua-\ntion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure;\nthe National Cholesterol Education Pro-\ngram; the National Kidney Foundation; and\nStatistical analyses were carried out\nusing SAS (Cary, NC) with appropriate\nsampling weights to adjust for the stratified\nsample design. Standard errors were calcu-\nlated and logistic regression was performed\nusing SUDAAN (Research Triangle Insti-\ntute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a com-\nputer program that adjusts for the cluster\nsample design in computing variance.\nRESULTS\nHealth care access and medical care\npractices\nMeasures of health care for patients with\ndiabetes are shown in Table 1.

Approximately 40% had multiple\ntypes of health insurance coverage. Of those\npatients covered by private insurance, 44%\nhad Medicare coverage and 9% had Medic-\naid or Champus/VA. Among the patients\nwith Medicare, 63% had private insurance\nand 24% had Medicare and/or Cham-\npus/VA; and among those with Medicaid,\nMedicare.\nThe majority of patients were treated\nwith insulin or oral agents for their diabetes\n(Table 1); only 4% were treated with both\ninsulin and oral agents.

Almost all of the patients had\ntheir blood pressure checked within the\npast 6 months, and most had their choles-\nterol measured (Table 1).\nClinical hypertension was present in\n63% of patients. Of those patients with\nhypertension, 82% were being treated with\nantihypertensive medication, and hyper-\ntension was undiagnosed or untreated in\nonly 18% (Table 1). Dyslipidemia was pres-\nent in 67% of patients; of those with dys-\nlipidemia, 60% were diagnosed, almost all\nof whom were being treated with medica-\ntion or a prescribed diet, but 40% of those\nwith dyslipidemia were undiagnosed.\nHealth status and outcomes\nHealth status and outcome measures for\npatients with diabetes are shown in Table 2.\nAt least 58% had an HbA\nwhich is the recommended treatment goal\nfor blood glucose control, including 73% of\nthe insulin-treated patients, 61% of the\npatients taking oral agents, and 35% of\nthose treated with diet alone. Mean HbA\nwas 7.8%; this was 5 SD above the mean\nvalue of 5.2% for nondiabetic adults with\nnormal fasting glucose (110 mg/dl).\nMean HbA\nwas similar for those treated\nwith insulin (8.3%) or oral agents (8.0%)\nand was lower for those who were treated\nwith diet alone (6.7%).\nThe majority of patients were over-\n25.

The patients\nhad extensive and frequent contact with the\nhealth care system and had health insur-\nance. Most of the patients were treated with\ninsulin or oral agents for their diabetes,\nand many monitored their own blood glu-\ncose levels. The patients were frequently\nscreened for retinopathy, hypertension, and\ndyslipidemia. Only a small proportion of\nthose with hypertension were undiagnosed\nor untreated. Most of the patients known to\nhave dyslipidemia were being treated with\nmedication or diet.\nThe NHANES III data also indicate,\nhowever, that health status and outcomes\nare far from optimal. Glycemic control was\npoor, many patients were obese and had\nalbuminuria, much of the hypertension and\ndyslipidemia was not controlled, one-fourth\nof patients had to be hospitalized during the\nprevious year, and one-fifth of patients\nsmoked cigarettes. In sum, there appears to\nbe discordance between health care access\nand health outcomes in type 2 diabetes.\nIf access and utilization of medical care\nis not an issue in the health status of patients\nwith diabetes, what factors might be deter-\nmining the poor outcomes in diabetic\npatients? The disease may simply be inher-\nently resistant to current treatment methods.\nDiabetes is perceived to be significantly more\ndifficult to manage than other common\nchronic conditions (15). The NHANES III\ndata indicate that control of hyperglycemia,\nhypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk\nfactors for diabetes complications is com-\nplex. Even in the setting of the UKPDS clin-\nical trial of glycemic control of patients with\ntype 2 diabetes, fasting glucose increased\nmarkedly over 9 years of follow-up, reflect-\ning progressive failure of islet function (16).\nThe intractability of obesity in diabetic\npatients to treatment is well recognized.\nThere may be inadequate use or under-\nutilization of medications to treat hypergly-\ncemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\nMonotherapy with diet, sulfonylurea, or\ninsulin becomes increasingly less effective\nwith time, and the majority of patients\nrequire multiple therapies to achieve\nglycemic control over the long term (16). In\nNHANES III, the proportion of patients tak-\ning oral agents decreased with longer dura-\ntion of diabetes and the proportion taking\ninsulin increased, implying that patients\nwere being transferred from oral agents to\ninsulin rather than adding a second therapy.\nOnly 4% used both insulin and oral agents.\nSome under-utilization of medication\nmay be due to failure by patients to take the\nmedications they have been prescribed. For\nexample, among patients who were pre-\nscribed oral agents to take twice per day, on\nonly 66% of days was this regimen followed\n(17). Difficulties with medication occur\nmore often among older patients and those\ntaking multiple medications, which were\ncharacteristics of the NHANES III patients.\nInadequate patient skills, knowledge,\nand motivation about self-care are impor-\ntant determinants of adverse health out-\ncomes. Daily self-care is a central element in\nthe management of diabetes, and semian-\nnual or quarterly visits to physicians, such\nas those of the NHANES III patients, are\ninsufficient for this daily care. Although\nmany NHANES III patients did not monitor\ntheir blood glucose levels as frequently as\nmight be deemed optimal, the efficacy of\nself-monitoring in type 2 diabetes is ques-\ntionable (18). Physicians routinely indicate\nthat noncompliance by patients with dia-\nbetes is the most common barrier to care\n(19), but there can be a marked gap\nbetween patients' receipt of information\nabout self-care from their physicians and\nthe patients' absorbing or retaining this\nPhysician practice behaviors and set-\ntings are influential in determining health\noutcomes in diabetes. Most primary care for\ndiabetes is delivered by internists and gen-\neral and family practitioners. Physicians\nwho see more than the average number of\npatients per unit of time tend to have lower\nrates of testing for HDL cholesterol and pro-\nteinuria and of referrals for ophthalmic\nexamination (21). Even though diabetes is a\ncommon condition, physicians may not see\nmany patients with diabetes; in 1 large staff-\nmodel health maintenance organization,\n90% of the primary care physicians had\n60 patients with diabetes (22). Many pri-\nmary care physicians do not have organized\nsystems for care of chronic illness (23).\nAdequate co-involvement of the med-\nical care team, the patient, and the family\nappears to be sentinel in effective manage-\nment of diabetes. Clinical trials have demon-\nstrated that health care systems that use\nnurses and other nonphysician personnel as\ncase managers and those with telephone-\nbased contact are efficacious in improving\nglycemic control, blood pressure, and lipid\nlevels (24\u00ad27). A key element in the success\nof the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial was the frequent clinic visits involving\nnurses and dietitians, and the extensive tele-\nphone access to these health care practition-\ners afforded to patients in the intensive\nintervention group in which HbA\nremained low throughout the study (28).\nAvailability of social support, such as that\nprovided by nurse case managers, appears to\nbe a major factor that contributes to adher-\nence by diabetic patients to such behaviors\nas following a diabetic diet, weight loss, tak-\ning prescribed medications, checking blood\nglucose, and checking feet (29).\nIn summary, although rates of health\ncare access, screening for diabetes compli-\ncations, and treatment of hyperglycemia,\nhypertension, and dyslipidemia in type 2\ndiabetes are high, health status and out-\ncomes are unsatisfactory. There are likely to\nbe multiple reasons for this discordance,\nincluding intractability of diabetes to cur-\nrent therapies, patient self-care practices,\nphysician medical care practices, and char-\nacteristics of U.S. health care systems.\nReferences\n1.
