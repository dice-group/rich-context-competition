The\nstrength of this paper is categorising physical\nactivity levels based on national recommenda-\ntions. These data may be used to determine the\nappropriate levels of physical activity necessary\nfor reducing inflammation in overweight and\nobese adults. However, cross-sectional data are\nlimited, as causal inferences cannot be obtained.\nA second limitation is that the sample was pre-\ndominantly comprised of non-Hispanic white\nindividuals, and therefore the findings may not\nextend to all ethnicities.\nOpen Access Research\nIt is less clear, however, whether the benefits of higher\nlevels of physical activity differ among normal weight,\noverweight and obese individuals.\nChronic, low-grade inflammation, marked by eleva-\ntions in cytokines, acute phase reactants and soluble\nadhesion molecules, is a developing CVD risk factor.2 3\nCirculating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein\n(CRP) are both considered to be established inflamma-\ntory markers related to CVD.3 Fibrinogen, soluble intra-\ncellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) and soluble\ne-selectin (sE-selectin) also have key roles in the progres-\nsion of CVD and have been associated with elevated\nrisk.4\u00ad6 Obesity is strongly associated with greater con-\ncentrations of inflammatory markers.7 8 Further, body\nfat distribution is also an important factor relating to\ninflammatory status. Accumulation of fat in visceral\ndepots is more strongly associated with low-grade inflam-\nmation compared to accumulation of fat in subcutane-\nThe effects of physical activity on markers of inflam-\nmation are more complex and may vary depending on\nbody weight. A number of epidemiological studies have\nshown an inverse relationship between physical activity\nLaboratory studies conducted in aerobically trained, typ-\nically normal weight individuals have demonstrated that\na single bout of exercise stimulates IL-6 release from\nskeletal muscle, which promotes anti-inflammatory\neffects,17\u00ad19 as opposed to adipose tissue-derived IL-6\nthat is associated with proinflammatory effects.20\nRandomised controlled trials have also been conducted,\noften in populations that also tend to be overweight or\nobese, to examine the effects of aerobic exercise inter-\nventions on inflammation and the results are mixed.21\nThus, the contribution of physical activity to inflamma-\ntion in the context of obesity remains unclear.\nThe purpose of our study was to disentangle the rela-\ntive contributions of BMI and physical activity recorded\nin MET minutes per week (MMW) to circulating levels\nof IL-6, IL-6sr, CRP, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin in\nmiddle-aged adults. MMW categories for this study were\ndetermined using values put forth by the Physical\nActivity Guidelines for Americans, which states that total\nof moderate or 75\u00ad150 min of vigorous activity per\nweek) produces substantial health benefits for adults.22\nWe hypothesised that BMI and MMW would interact,\nsuch that the greater MMW reported would lessen the\nimpact of obesity on markers of inflammation.\nDesign and sample\nThis study was a cross-sectional analysis of archived data\n(BMI, self-reported physical activity and inflammatory\nbiomarker concentrations) from 1254 respondents who\nprovided consent (as approved by The University of\nWisconsin Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review\nBoard) and were subsequently enroled in the National\nSurvey of Midlife Development in the USA (MIDUS)\nBiomarkers Study.23 The Biomarker Project was one of\nfive projects within MIDUS II set up with the purpose of\nadding comprehensive biological assessments on a sub-\nsample of the MIDUS participants to further understand\nage-related differences in physical and mental health.\nParticipants were eligible for The Biomarker Project if\nthey were previously enroled in MIDUS and MIDUS II,\nwhich recruited non-institutionalised, English-speaking\nadults residing in the contiguous USA aged 25\u00ad74.\nExclusion criteria included non-participation in MIDUS\nand MIDUS II and an unwillingness to travel to specified\nsites for biomarker assessment. The random digit dialling\nsample for the parent study was selected from working\ntelephone banks, and a list of all individuals aged\nbetween 25 and 74 years within each household was gen-\nerated in order to select a random respondent. Those\nwho agreed to participate in the Biomarker Study stayed\novernight at one of three General Clinical Research\nCenters: University of California Los Angeles, University\nof Wisconsin-Madison and Georgetown University. Upon\narrival, each respondent provided a detailed medical\nhistory (including physical activity levels) and all prescrip-\ntion, over-the-counter and alternative medications to be\ninventoried by project staff. Following an overnight stay,\nmorning fasting blood samples were obtained. Cohorts\nfollow-up to MIDUS I respondents who were previously\nsurveyed by the MacArthur Midlife Research Network\nmated to detect small effect sizes (=0.08 and higher)\nAnthropometrics\nHeight was measured in centimetres and recorded to\nthe nearest millimetre. A single measure of WC was\ntaken directly on the skin or over a single layer of light,\nwith close-fitting clothing at the narrowest point between\nthe ribs and the iliac crest in centimetres to the nearest\nmillimetre. Weight was measured in kilograms and BMI\nwas calculated by dividing body mass in kilograms by\nheight in metres squared. BMI categories were organised\ninto three groups--normal weight (BMI 24.9 kg/m2),\nCategorising physical activity by MET-minutes per week\nThe MMW variable was calculated using data provided\nin the medical history form. The form first described\nthree types of regular physical activity\n Vigorous: It causes your heart to beat so rapidly that\nyou can feel it in your chest and you perform it long\nenough to work up a good sweat and breathe heavily\n(eg, competitive sports, running, vigorous swimming,\nhigh intensity aerobics, digging in the garden or\nlifting heavy objects).\nBMI, Physical activity and inflammation\n Moderate: It causes your heart rate to increase slightly\nand you typically work up a sweat (eg, leisurely sports\nlike light tennis, slow or light swimming, low intensity\naerobics or golfing without a power cart, brisk\nwalking, mowing the lawn with a walking\nlawnmower).\n Light: It requires little physical effort (eg, light house-\nkeeping like dusting or laundry, bowling, archery, easy\nwalking, golfing with a power cart or fishing).\nKeeping these definitions in mind, participants were\nasked if they engaged in regular physical activity of any\ntype for 20 min or more at least three times per week\n(yes or no). If participants answered \"yes\", they entered\nup to seven types of seasonal and/or non-seasonal exer-\ncise or activity along with the frequency, duration and\nintensity.\nMMW were calculated in a two-step process. Step 1:\nparticipants who reported no physical activity (for whom\nno MMW calculations could be made) were designated\nas the no regular exercise group (NRE). Step 2: for par-\nticipants who indicated that they performed regular\nphysical activity, total MMW were calculated by multiply-\ning minutes per week by intensity level (1.1 for low, 3.0\nfor moderate and 6.0 for vigorous) and summed across\neach non-seasonal activity reported. Four groups reflect-\ning participation in physical activity and whether or not\ntheir participation was below, at or above United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (USDHHS)\nguidelines were created: NRE (reported no regular\nphysical activity), below recommended (reported\nand above recommended (reported >1000 MMW).\nBlood collection, processing and assays\nParticipants were asked to avoid strenuous activity on the\nday of blood collection. Venous blood samples were col-\nlected in 10 ml serum separator vacutainers following a\n12-h overnight fast and processed at a General Clinical\nResearch Center using standardised procedures. Blood\nsamples were not collected at any specific point during\nthe menstrual cycle in female participants. Briefly, fol-\nlowing collection, vacutainers were allowed to stand 15\u00ad\n30-min (2-h maximum) prior to centrifugation at 4\u00b0C\nfrozen and shipped to the MIDUS Biocore Lab and\ntreated and/or analysed for inflammation markers (IL-6,\nIL-6sr, CRP, fibrinogen, sE-selectin and sICAM-1).\nIL-6 and IL-6sr were assayed in the MIDUS Biocore\nLaboratory (University of Madison, Madison WI) using\nQuantikine High-sensitivity ELISA kits (cat# HS600B\nand cat# DR600, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota,\nfor IL-6 and IL-6sr using a Dynex MRXe plate reader\n(Magellan Biosciences, Chantilly, Virginia, USA).\nIntra-assay and interassay precision (CV%) for IL-6 was\napproximately 4.1% and 13%, respectively. CV% values\nAssays for sICAM-1, sE-selectin, fibrinogen and CRP\nwere performed at the Laboratory for Clinical\nBiochemistry Research (University of Vermont,\nBurlington, Vermont, USA). Measurement of sICAM-1\nwas completed using an ELISA assay (Parameter-Human\nsICAM-1 Immunoassay; R&D Systems). Inter-assay preci-\nsion for sICAM-1 was 5.0%. Measurement of sE-selectin\nwas completed using a high-sensitivity ELISA assay\n(Parameter Human sE-Selectin Immunoassay, R&D\nSystems). Intra-assay and inter-assay precision for\nFibrinogen was measured using the BNII nephelometer\n(N Antiserum to Human Fibrinogen; Dade Behring Inc,\nDeerfield, Illinois, USA). Intra-assay and inter-assay pre-\ncision for fibrinogen was 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively.\nCRP was analysed using a BNII nephelometer with a par-\nticle enhanced immunonepolometric assay. Intra-assay\nand inter-assay precision for CRP was 2.3\u00ad4.4% and\nStatistical analyses\nAll variables were assessed for normality and non-normal\ndata were log transformed, which included data for CRP,\nIL-6, IL-6sr, fibrinogen, sE-selectin and sICAM-1.\nGeneral linear models were performed to determine the\nrelationship of MMW and BMI with the inflammatory\nmarkers. For each outcome, the ordinal MMW and BMI\nfactors were entered as independent factors with an\ninteraction term. If the interaction term was not signifi-\ncant, the interaction term was dropped and the model\nwas refit for main effects only. Pairwise comparisons\nwere assessed using post hoc univariate analyses with a\nBonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nCovariates for all models included factors that are\nknown to affect inflammatory status--age, sex, smoking\nand relevant medications (cholesterol-lowering, corticos-\nteroids, antidiabetics, antidepressants, hormone replace-\nments and hormonal contraceptives). Race was initially\nincluded as a covariate; however, approximately 200 data\npoints were lost in the analyses owing to incomplete\nracial data. As race was not found to be a predictor of\nour dependent variables, with the exception of sICAM-1,\nrace was excluded as a covariate to increase sample size\nin all analyses excluding sICAM-1. All statistical analyses\nwere performed with SPSS V.17 (Chicago, Illinois, USA)\nand statistical significance was set =0.05.\nIn an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the\nrelative effects of BMI and MMW on the inflammatory\nmarkers differed by sex in three-way interaction models.\nAs none of the interactions approached statistical signifi-\ncance (data not shown), sex was retained as a covariate\nin the models.\nRESULTS\nParticipant characteristics\nTable 1 presents the anthropometric characteristics and\ncirculating levels of inflammatory biomarkers in all\nBMI, Physical activity and inflammation\nnon-Hispanic white, 56.8% female and, on average,\nmiddle-aged and overweight.

Briefly, we found a significant interaction\nbetween WC and MMW on sICAM-1. In individuals with\nwomen), sICAM-1 was significantly lower in those report-\ntended to be lower in those reporting no regular exer-\ncise. Overall, the main effects were similar to those\nfound for BMI and MMW analyses. Having an at-risk WC\nwas independently related to higher levels of CRP,\nsICAM-1, IL-6, fibrinogen and sE-selectin. Independent\nof WC, any level of regular exercise was related to lower\nlevels of CRP, IL-6 with a similar tendency for\nfibrinogen.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study aimed to determine whether the\nimpact of BMI and MMW on inflammatory markers\nvaried by level of overweight or obesity. For CRP and\ns-ICAM-1, regular physical activity appeared to diminish\nthe effects of higher BMI compared to those who\nreported no regular physical activity. In addition, we\nfound that BMI was strongly and independently related\nto greater concentrations of both established and emer-\nging inflammatory markers that may increase CVD risk.\nIndependent of BMI, regular physical activity was also\nassociated with lower IL-6, with a similar trend for\nfibrinogen. These results suggest that although obesity\nhas a clear impact on inflammation, physical activity\nappears to mitigate at least some of this effect.\nFor example, overweight individuals had CRP levels\nwhich were similar to levels observed in obese indivi-\nduals if they reported no regular exercise (4.05 and\n4.83 g/ml, respectively). CRP levels greater than 3 g/\nml are typically associated with high CVD risk.26 In over-\nweight participants who reported regular physical activity\nof at least three 20-min sessions per week (be it below\nMMW recommendations), CRP levels were lower and\nnot significantly different from CRP levels found in\nnormal weight participants. This suggests that increasing\nphysical activity level to a minimum of 3 days/week, at\nleast 20 min/day, may improve CRP profiles among over-\nweight individuals.\nObese individuals may require a higher level of\nregular physical activity in order to lower inflammatory\nmarkers. While obese participants also had greater levels\nof CRP and sICAM-1 compared to lean and overweight\nparticipants, those who reported >1000 MMW (above\nthe USDHHS recommendation) had lower levels of\nsICAM-1 and tended to have lower CRP than obese par-\nticipants reporting no regular physical activity. Taken\ntogether, we may speculate that while physical activity\nlevels currently recommended for the general popula-\ntion may reduce particular inflammatory makers in over-\nweight populations, obese populations may require\ngreater levels of physical activity above the recom-\nmended values to reduce inflammatory markers like\nCRP and sICAM-1.\nAs expected, strong main effects of BMI were observed\nfor CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin, in\nagreement with previous work.27\u00ad30 Independent of BMI\neffects, our results suggest that physical activity has dif-\nferentiating effects on inflammatory markers.\nIndividuals reporting no regular physical activity had\nhigher levels of IL-6 with a tendency for higher fibrino-\ngen, compared to those reporting any level of regular\nSimilar results have been observed in the MONItoring\ntrends and determinants in the CArdiovascular disease\n(MONICA) study,31 the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III)12 14 and the\nMulti-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA),32 such\nthat both the increased frequency and intensity of phys-\nical activity have been related to lower IL-6 and fibrino-\ngen. Our findings add to these prior results by\nstandardising levels of physical activity by using\nUSDHHS. Our results suggest that regular physical activ-\nassociated with lower levels of IL-6 and possibly fibrino-\ngen, independent of BMI.\nAlthough IL-6 produced in hypertrophied adipose\ntissue33 34 initiates the acute phase response, marked by\nthe release of hepatic CRP,35 36 an interaction between\nBMI and physical activity was detected for CRP, but not\nIL-6. While IL-6 and CRP were significantly correlated\n(r=0.514, see online supplementary table S1), this correl-\nation suggests that IL-6 levels do not fully explain CRP\nlevels at any given moment. Further, CRP is a more\nstable biomarker, owing to its substantially longer plasma\nhalf-life,37 which may improve our ability to detect inter-\naction effects in CRP compared to IL-6.\nInterestingly, our results also suggest that regular exer-\ncise may have a more profound impact on lowering clas-\nsical markers of inflammation and less impact on the\ninflammatory status of the endothelium. Regular phys-\nical activity has reliably been associated with lower levels\nof IL-6 and CRP, both classical inflammatory markers\nrelated to adipose and systemic inflammation.38\nHowever, regular exercise appeared to have no inde-\npendent impact on markers of endothelial activation,\nparticularly sE-selectin. Higher levels of exercise were\nrelated to lower sICAM-1 in obese individuals only. In\none prior study, inverse relationships between physical\nactivity and sICAM-1 and sE-selectin were reported in\ndrug-treated hypertensive men.39 Thus, further research\nis necessary to understand mechanisms underlying dif-\nferential associations of exercise with systemic and endo-\nthelial inflammation.\nSeveral limitations must be addressed. First, the cross-\nsectional design does not allow us to infer causal\nBMI, Physical activity and inflammation\nrelationships. Prospective and interventional designs are\nnecessary to confirm our findings. No objective mea-\nsures of physical activity were available in the MIDUS\nsample. Therefore, the use of self-report physical activity\ndata may have diminished our ability to detect effects.\nHowever, in addition to being in line with previous\nstudies using self-report physical activity, our findings are\nalso in line with previous studies40 41 that demonstrated\nthat higher cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by\nindirect calorimetry, was associated with lower levels of\ninflammation independent of visceral adiposity or BMI.\nAnother limitation is that the sample was predominantly\ncomprised of non-Hispanic white individuals, suggesting\nthat the findings may not extend to all ethnicities.\nFinally, BMI and physical activity variables are correlated,\npotentially raising the concern of small sample sizes in\nspecific groups crossed by BMI and MMW. However, the\nsmallest group for analyses still contained 54 individuals\n(normal weight individuals reporting no exercise).\nIn summary, our results demonstrate both the inter-\nactive and independent influences of BMI and levels of\nphysical activity on both established and emerging\nmarkers of inflammation. Inflammation is both a conse-\nquence of obesity and a mechanism promoting CVD.\nRegular physical activity appears to mitigate the effects\nof higher BMI on some inflammatory markers, particu-\nlarly CRP, which is strongly implicated in CVD.\nImportantly, while any level of regular physical activity\nmay help reduce inflammation in overweight indivi-\nduals, similar effects in obese individuals may require\nlevels of physical activity that are greater than currently\nrecommended by the USDHHS for general health.\n"
