Insurance premiums continue to\ning health costs under control, employers and insurance companies\nhave instituted mechanisms such as managed care, second surgical\nopinions, and incentives to use generic drugs. Yet, the data show\nthat these efforts have been anything but uniform across the coun-\ntry. Indeed, in many areas, benefits and costs have expanded. \"For\nall the rhetoric we've heard, .. .the bulk [ofemployers] are sitting\non their hands,\" economist Michael Morrisey said. In this paper,\nMorrisey and fellow economist GailJensen examine private insur-\nance coverage by region, trying to glean some insight into why use of\nhealth services varies drastically across the United States. Ex-\nplained Morrisey, \"It strikes us that... some ofthe variation in\nutilization across regions can be explained by differences in insur-\nance coverage.\" While the authors acknowledge that otherfactors\ncertainly play a role in explaining regional variations in health ser-\nvices utilization, they raise this question ofinsurance coverage to en-\ncouragefurther work in this area, especially in developing reliable\ndata sets. Morrisey is a professor in the Department ofHealth Care\nOrganization at the University ofAlabama School ofPublic\nHealth, which hejoined in 1985. He previously worked at the\nAmerican Hospital Association's Hospital Research and Educa-\ntional Trust in Chicago as a senior economist and earned a doctor-\nate in economics from the University ofWashington. Jensen, who\nreceived a doctorate in economics from the University ofMinne-\nsota, was affiliated with the University ofIllinois at Chicago at the\ntime this article was written. She has recently assumed a position as\nassociate professor at Wayne State University's Institute ofGer-\nontology.

To explain this variation, researchers\nhave examined differences in sex, race, and age structure among\nvarious regions as well as differences in income, health status, and the\navailability of health resources.1 Yet, these factors have been unable to\nexplain much of the variation in hospital admission rates, length-of-stay,\nor physician visits. Related studies of small area variations show that use\nof services sometimes varies more by diagnosis than by region. These\nstudies suggest that systematic differences in physician practice styles may\npartially explain the puzzle of regional variation. We suggest that varia-\ntion in health insurance coverage offered by employers in different\nregions of the country may partially explain the regional variation in use\nof services.\nThe link between health insurance benefits and the use of health\nservices is well established. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment\nfound that full coverage (that is, no out-of-pocket payments) for a\nuniformly wide range of health services resulted in annual health care\nexpenditures that averaged $177 higher than the expenditures for those\nwho paid half of the initial charges out-of-pocket.2 Hospital admission\nrates were lower, and physician visits were fewer. The differences in use\nrates increased as the amount of consumer out-of-pocket liability in-\ncreased. Further, health insurers, health maintenance organization\n(HMO) advocates, and advocates of more price competition in health\ncare argue that changes in benefit offerings will further change use\npatterns and reduce health care expenditures.\nSomewhat surprisingly, little effort has been devoted to identifying the\neffects of insurance coverage on the observed variations in regional\nutilization. This has resulted in part from a lack of reliable insurance data\nand data to link utilization with detailed information on coverage. This\narticle constitutes a first step toward such an analysis. We summarize the\nextent of regional variation in health services utilization and then exam-\nine these differences in light of rather remarkable differences in the\nextent of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. To be sure,\nother factors play major roles in explaining regional variation, yet our\nresults suggest that differences in the pattern of private insurance cover-\nage are worthy of consideration as well.\nUse Of Health Services\nExhibit 1 reports regional differences in commonly reported utiliza-\ntion rates adjusted for age and disability level of the population.

This was a greater proportion than in any other region.\nThis finding is perhaps not so surprising given that Blue Cross/Blue\nShield (BC/BS) plans have such a large market share in this area of the\ncountry (40.2 percent of employees in 1985). BC/BS plans are primarily\ncombined basic/major medical plans rather than freestanding major\nmedical plans.4 The difference is that in combined plans, basic coverage\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nprovides an initial extra layer of coverage in the event of hospitalization.\nBasic benefits for hospital care typically do not require a deductible or\ncoinsurance. Rather, all hospitalization expenses are covered for a specific\nnumber of days per year (usually 120 or 365); once the limit is reached,\ncoverage is picked up under the major medical portion of the plan and its\ncost-sharing provisions then apply. Unlike the Blues, commercial and\nself-insured plans tend to be freestanding major medical plans in which\nhospital expenses, and most other categories of care, are subject to the\nsame deductible and coinsurance provisions.\nCommercial insurance and HMOs both have small market shares in\nthe Northeast (20.4 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, measured in\nterms of employees covered). However, almost 30 percent of employees\ncould have joined an HMO had they wished to do so. Self-insurance,\nwhile growing steadily over the period, is also less common in the\nNortheast than elsewhere (with only a 33.5 percent market share).\nMaking HMOs available and self-insuring the fee-for-service plan are\nsteps usually adopted by employers to cut health benefit costs. However,\nBlue Cross's large market share apparently has allowed them to negotiate\nsubstantial discounts with hospitals, particularly in the Northeast. In\n1977, the last year data were collected, the Blues' discount from hospital\ncharges averaged 11.6 percent in the Northeast. This was more than three\ntimes the discount garnered in any other region.5 Further, with the sole\nexception of Connecticut, states in this region do not tax BC/BS premi-\nums but do tax commercial premiums, usually at a rate of 2 percent.6 The\nBlues' favored tax status gives them an added edge over commercial\ncompetitors and weakens the advantages of self-insurance. (Self-insuring\nexempts the firm's plan from premium taxation as well as compliance\nwith state insurance regulations and mandated benefits as a result of the\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, of 1974.) In\nshort, hospital discounts and favorable premium tax treatment of the\nBlues in the Northeast likely have allowed them to bid successfully\nagainst the promised savings of HMOs and the tax and state-mandated\nbenefits exemptions of self-insurance.\nThe incidence of premium sharing for medical insurance coverage in\nthe Northeast mirrors national trends. In 1985, approximately 35 percent\nand 52 percent of employees faced individual or family coverage pre-\nmium sharing, respectively. Differences in the time trends for individual\nand family coverage premium sharing are startling, however. Between\nindividual premium sharing; by 1985 the average employee contribution\n(among those required to contribute) was almost eleven dollars per\nmonth, approximately 20 percent of the full premium cost.

However,\nthere has been almost no increase in the percentage of employees facing\nfamily plan premium sharing for medical insurance since 1981 in the\nNortheast.\nIt is not at all apparent that increased employee premium sharing\ncontrols employee compensation costs effectively. Clearly, it cuts health\nbenefit costs. However, if firms are in reasonably competitive labor\nmarkets, other forms of compensation (wages or other benefits) must be\nincreased when premium sharing is introduced, or the better employees\nin each job grade will seek employment elsewhere. To the extent that\npayroll-based employer taxes (such as FICA and unemployment insur-\nance premiums) must then be paid on the increased wage payments, the\nnet effect may actually be an increase in employer labor costs. Premium\nsharing simply forces employees to pay for insurance with before-tax\nrather than after-tax dollars; hence, it is unlikely to be a cheaper method\nof providing net compensation.\nMore importantly, within the health plan, shifting premium costs fails\nto change the underlying incentives to use health services. To be effec-\ntive, the premium sharing must be linked to the availability of multiple\nplans--and the contributions tailored to provide an incentive for enroll-\nment in the less expensive plans. The limited BLS data, nationally and in\nthe Northeast, suggest that employers are not offering multiple-plan\ncoverage as rapidly as they are increasing the use of premium sharing. We\nspeculate that even fewer are carefully structuring the premium sharing\nacross plans.\nAs the RAND experiment demonstrated, coinsurance and deductibles\nshow greater promise of reducing the use of health services. By reducing\nthe use of marginal physician visits and hospital admissions, they gener-\nate claims savings that reduce the employer's compensation bill. Employ-\ners in the Northeast have increased major medical deductibles for both\nindividuals and families; however, average levels in this region are still\namong the lowest in the country. The increases were 25.8 percent and\n(CPI, all items) increased by 18.3 percent, and the medical care compo-\nnent of the CPI increased by 36.9 percent over the same period. Thus,\nemployers' increased deductibles, at best, reflect \"running in place.\" The\nlevel of coinsurance above the deductible underscores this lack of action.\nThe vast majority of employees nationwide continue to face an 80/20\ncoinsurance rule, a formula that has remained constant for many years.\nIronically, some employees have actually moved toward lower levels of\ncoinsurance--particularly in the Northeast. In 1985, 9.3 percent of em-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

At most, about half of\nthis increase can be attributed to the growth in HMO enrollment over the\nperiod; HMOs rarely stipulate coinsurance. The remainder is due to the\nrestructuring of some northeastern fee-for-service plans to reduce copay-\nments.\nFurther, employers have added many new benefits over the period,\nincluding extended care and home health coverage (both up by 20\npercent over 1981 levels) and alcoholism treatment coverage (up by 71\npercent). The prevalence of stop-loss coverage, which caps enrollees'\nmaximum out-of-pocket payments, was up by 33 percent. While there are\nno definitive studies, there is evidence that on net these coverages\nincrease premiums.7 This suggests that the newly covered services have\nnot been major substitutes for hospital or physician services.\nFinally, the region has tended to lag behind the rest of the country in its\nuse of special cost-control devices. Among fee-for-service enrollees, the\nNortheast has the lowest percentage enrolled in plans with a separate\ndeductible for hospitalization (41 percent). It also has the lowest percent-\nage of persons in plans containing incentives to use generic drugs (1.4\npercent) or to use outpatient surgery (14.7 percent). Hospice care also is\nleast often covered in this region (20 percent). The two exceptions to this\npattern are more frequent coverage of second surgical opinions in the\ngreater frequency of provisions disallowing nonemergency hospital ad-\nmissions on a weekend (8.1 percent). While it would be desirable to\nconsider other utilization review mechanisms, by 1984, only 5 percent of\nconventional insurance plans, nationally, had preadmission certification.8\nThus, the Northeast has relatively few persons without some form of\ninsurance. Private hospital insurance tends to be generous, and deduct-\nibles and coinsurance features are among the lowest in the country. This\nwould lead a proponent of the insurance/utilization link to expect high\nhospital utilization in the Northeast--a fact borne out in Exhibit 1.\nAmbulatory coverage is higher in the Northeast than in the South and\nlower than in the West, suggesting that ambulatory use here should be\nbetween the extremes of these regions as well. Exhibit 1 confirms this\ntheory. The link between insurance and ambulatory use also implies that\nthe Northeast's physician visit rate should be below the Midwest's and\nmuch closer to the South's; however, it is not. This may be attributable to\nincome and other factors; out-of-date physician visit coverage data; or\nthe relative absence of basic coverage (with its low front-end cost sharing)\nin the Midwest compared to the Northeast, which outweighs the physi-\ncian visit coverage, resulting in lower ambulatory use in the Midwest.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Another striking feature of this region is the large market share\nof self-insurance (45.4 percent of employees). Unlike the Northeast,\ncoverage through the Blues is rare (only 9.4 percent), and fee-for-service\ncoverage, regardless of vendor, tends toward the \"major medical only\"\nvariety. This suggests that more western fee-for-service enrollees face\nfront-end cost sharing for hospital care, relative to their northeastern\ncounterparts. In the West, 58 percent of fee-for-service enrollees had free-\nstanding major medical coverage in 1985, compared to 16.7 percent in the\nNortheast. Such coverage, by design, entails front-end cost sharing for\nhospital care. Further, among western fee-for-service subscribers with\nbasic coverage, 18.3 percent had a separate deductible for a hospital stay\nin 1985, compared with only 8.7 percent among northeasterners. Fee-for-\nservice cost sharing for hospital care is clearly the norm in the West rather\nthan the exception it is in the Northeast.\nMajor medical deductibles have increased more in the West than in\nany other region (Exhibit 3). The percentage of western employees facing\npremium sharing is about the same as that nationally; however, the size of\nthe workers. premium contribution (roughly 30 percent of either individ-\nual or family coverage) is substantially higher here than elsewhere.\nLimits on subscribers' out-of-pocket payments and the presence of\nspecial coverage, such as for chemical dependency treatment, extended\ncare, home health care, hospice care, and physical exams, are all more\ncommon in the West than in other regions. This may result from the high\nHMO enrollment, with its broad coverage. Also, competition with\nHMOs may have spurred some fee-for-service plans to expand their\nconventional coverage.\nLower hospital use in the West typically has been attributed to its large\nHMO enrollment, as well; however, there is growing evidence to doubt\nthat view. Gail Wilensky and Louis Rossiter concluded that much of the\ndifference appears attributable to favorable selection into HMOs on the\npart of nonhospital users.9 If they are correct, to what, then, does one\nattribute the lower hospitalization and higher ambulatory utilization in\nthe West? Our data may provide a partial explanation. Relatively fewer\npersons have insurance coverage, and there is extensive use of cost\nsharing. Taken together with the most extensive insurance coverage of\nambulatory services found in any region, the expected pattern of utiliza-\ntion is the one we observe.\nThis explanation, however, may go too far in ignoring the role HMOs\nmay play in reducing hospitalization.

As in the West, the South has a large proportion of persons\nwithout insurance (19.2 percent). Similar to the Northeast, private cover-\nage is almost exclusively fee-for-service. HMO coverage is growing fastest\nin the South, however. Southerners are also most likely to be covered by a\nself-insured plan. Further, employers in the South appear to rely heavily\non traditional cost containment tools. However, since they tend to use\ncombined basic and major medical coverage much more than do employ-\ners in the West, their fee-for-service incentives to control hospital use are\nnot as strong (Exhibit 2).\nNonetheless, cost sharing is extensive. Major medical deductibles are\nthe highest in the South and have grown more rapidly here than\nanywhere except in the West. Also, among those with two-part basic/\nmajor medical plans in 1985, close to one-quarter (more than in any other\nregion) face a separate deductible for hospitalization.\nRestrictions on nonemergency hospital admissions are most common\nhere (10.6 percent of enrollees), as are incentive provisions for outpatient\nsurgery (32.6 percent of enrollees). Special coverage options, including\nalcoholism treatment, drug abuse treatment, extended care, home health\ncare, hearing care, and physical exams, were least frequently provided in\nThe high proportion of uninsured and the extensive use of cost\ncontainment mechanisms suggest low hospital use. This must be bal-\nanced, however, by the prevalence of combined basic/major medical\ncoverage and, perhaps, the absence of long-established HMOs. Thus, it is\nnot surprising that the South's hospital use patterns lie between those of\nthe Northeast and the West (Exhibit 1). Because of high cost sharing on\noutpatient as well as inpatient services and the relative absence of cover-\nage for physician visits, the South's outpatient utilization should be and is\nthe lowest of any region.\nThe Midwest. The Midwest is similar to the Northeast in that the\nproportion of persons under age sixty-five lacking hospital insurance is\nlow (10.9 percent). The Northeast and Midwest also have the lowest\ndeductibles for major medical expenses. If anything, the Midwest pro-\nvides more coverage than the Northeast (Exhibit 3).\nThe major difference between the two regions appears to be the use of\ncombined basic/major medical coverage. While both exceed the national\naverage, only 64.3 percent of private enrollees have such coverage in the\nMidwest, compared to 78.4 percent in the Northeast. From this, one\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In addition, since the Midwest and Northeast provide\nless ambulatory coverage than the West, one would expect lower physi-\ncian visit rates in these regions than in the West. Finally, since ambulatory\ncoverage appears better in these regions than in the South, adjusted\nphysician visits per capita should be higher in these regions than in the\nSouth. All three presumptions hold true (Exhibit 1).\nThe fly in this regional analysis is the ambulatory coverage and use\npatterns between the Northeast and the Midwest. On the basis of the\n(admittedly old) physician coverage variable, one would expect much\ngreater outpatient use in the Midwest relative to the Northeast. However,\nsuch is clearly not the case. As we noted above, the most favorable\ninterpretation for the insurance hypothesis is that the less frequent use of\nbasic coverage (with its absence of front-end cost sharing) more than\noffsets the lack of physician coverage in the Northeast. The least favor-\nable interpretation is that the observation stands in refutation of the\ninsurance/utilization link.\nInsights For Policymakers\nThe purpose of this article is to identify differences in private insurance\ncoverage by region and to speculate on the extent to which these\ndifferences may help explain regional differences in use of health services.\nIt is clear from these data that the type of coverage and the extent of cost\nsharing varies remarkably across regions. In general, the pattern of\ninsurance coverage is consistent with our speculation concerning differ-\nences in service. This is particularly true for inpatient use. The data\nsuggest that places with less complete coverage and more cost sharing for\ninpatient care have lower hospital utilization. Places with greater incen-\ntives for ambulatory use often, but not always, have higher ambulatory\nvisits per capita.\nOur exercise, however, is only suggestive. We have but four regional\nobservations--and a host of insurance features. As any good number\ncruncher knows, one can explain everything--and nothing--with more\nindependent variables than observations. We do hope that the apparent\nassociation in these comparisons will lead to serious efforts to sort out the\nintricacies and interactions of health insurance features--and other\nfactors--on the regional (and small area) variations in use of services. A\nparticularly important aspect of such an investigation is the role that local\nutilization patterns themselves may have on the actual insurance benefits\noffered in the area.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The dif-\nferences in regional utilization may be, in part, a function of conscious\ndecisions made by employers and employees. Further, these data suggest\nthat attempts to temper physician practice patterns must not ignore the\nunderlying incentives faced by patients. Even patients with employer-\nsponsored coverage face some substantial differences in the range of\ncovered benefits and the extent of cost sharing.\nFinally, the numbers offer some insight into Uwe Reinhardt's question\nof why employer actions to control health benefits have not paid off.11\nApparently, employers have not done much. The data indicate that\nbenefits have expanded in most respects--at least through the mid-\n1980s. Deductibles have increased but have only kept pace with medical\ncare cost increases. There have been few actual changes that provide new\nincentives for employees to control their own use of services.\nAll is not as bleak as it appears, however. The suggestive evidence\nreported here hints that insurance incentives can affect use of services.\nThe RAND study clearly shows cost savings associated with specific cost\nsharing features.12 The recent work of Jack Zwanziger and Glenn Melnick\nsuggests that selective contracting can reduce the rates of increase in\nhealth care costs.13 Finally, the work Paul Feldstein and colleagues have\ndone on utilization review suggests that at least some such mechanisms\nmay be effective in reducing health care costs.14\nHowever, U.S. labor markets are competitive, and real wages will\nincrease as an aging population and limited immigration shrink the work\nforce. Any changes employers make to control the cost of health benefits\nnot only must save insurance claims costs, but must save enough that\nworkers can be compensated for the insurance loss with other benefits or\nhigher after-tax wages.\nThis study was funded by Grant no.
