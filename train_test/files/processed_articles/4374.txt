A total of 45 rabbits were randomly divided\ninto a magnesium- (n = 15) and a plastic- (n = 15) stent group, and underwent stent insertion\ninto the lower third of the esophagus under fluoroscopic guidance; a control group (n = 15)\ndid not undergo the intervention. Esophagography was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Five\nrabbits in each group were euthanized at each time point for histological examination.\nResults: Silicone-covered magnesium stents showed similar radial force to plastic stents\n(p > 0.05). The magnesium stents degraded rapidly in an acidic solution, but 90.2% \u00b1 3.1% of\nthe residual mass was maintained after a 2-week degradation in a solution with a pH of 4.0.\nAll stent insertions were well tolerated. Magnesium stents migrated in six rabbits (one at 1\nweek, one at 2 weeks and four at 4 weeks), and plastic stents migrated in three rabbits (one\nat 2 weeks and two at 4 weeks; p > 0.05). Esophageal wall remodeling (thinner epithelial and\nsmooth muscle layers) was similar in both stented groups (p > 0.05), and the esophagus wall\nwas found to be significantly thinner in the stented groups than in the control group (p < 0.05).\nEsophageal injury and collagen deposition following stent insertion were similar and did not\ndiffer from the control group (p > 0.05).\nConclusions: Esophageal silicone-covered magnesium stents provided reliable support for\nat least 2 weeks, with acceptable migration rates and without causing severe injury or tissue\nreaction compared with plastic stents.\n",

In addition, the mechanical\nsupport provided and the biodegradation process\nwere tested in vitro.\nMaterials and methods\nSilicone-covered magnesium and plastic stents\nThe silicone-covered magnesium and plastic\nstents used consisted of two parts: a bare stent\nand a silicone membrane. The bare magnesium\nstent was knitted from a 0.20 mm-wide magne-\na commercial magnesium alloy (Sanming,\nBiomedical Company, Yangzhou, China) with\nthe following chemical composition (in mass per-\n(balance). It is supplied in the form of cast ingots.\nThe plastic stent is knitted from a 0.25 mm\ndiameter polypropylene wire (density, 76 g/m2)\n(Convidien, Trevoux, France). The density of\nwire cross distribution, the height, and the knit\nangle of the stent were the same as those of the\nmagnesium stent made using the same cast ingots.\nThe stent consisted of a cylindrical, cross-linked\nmesh body made of the magnesium alloy or poly-\npropylene, with a 14 mm cylinder and a dilated\nportion at its head and distal end to prevent stent\nmigration. The diameter of the main body was\n10 mm; the total stent length was 31 mm when\nfully expanded (Figure 1a and b). A silicone\nmembrane (C6-530 with A and B components,\nDow Corning Company, China) was used to coat\nthe stent body via a dipping and spinning method:\n(a) precision aluminum molds of the stent were\nused to fabricate the wire framework; (b) equal\nportions of the two parts of the silicone rubber\nwere thoroughly blended together using N-octane\nas a solvent prior to use; (c) the mixed silicone\nwas dipped on the stent mold and cured for 6 h at\nFigure 1. Photographs of the magnesium (a) and plastic (b) stents. Mechanical analysis revealed that the\nmagnesium stent had a similar radial force to the plastic stent (p > 0.05) (c).\nY-Q Zhu, K Yang et al.\nhttp://tag.sagepub.com 13\n80\u00b0C for drying. The molds were cooled for 3 h in\nambient conditions; the stent prototypes were\nstripped from the molds. The stent body was not\nradio-opaque, so a mark was placed at its distal\nend to facilitate accurate positioning under fluor-\noscopy. We compressed and deployed each stent\nusing a 6 mm-wide (approximately 18F) delivery\nsystem.\nMagnesium-silicone stent evaluation in vitro\nThe compression\u00adrecovery characteristics of the\nsilicone-covered magnesium stent and plastic\nstent were investigated using a mechanical testing\nmachine (Instron 5567, Norwood, MA, USA).\nMagnesium-stent degradation was evaluated by\ndetermining the mass lost from the stent. Stents\nwere sectioned into 1 \u00d7 1 mm2 squares. The pre-\nof two phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions\nwith pH values of 7.4 and 4.0. At each experi-\nmental time point, triplicate stent samples were\nrecovered and rinsed with distilled water; the\nstents were dried to a constant weight in vacuum\ndesiccators. Mass loss was determined gravimet-\nrically by comparing the dry weight remaining at\na specific time with the initial weight.\nStent insertion\nAll protocols were approved by the Animal\nResearch Committee of our institution and con-\nducted in accordance with the guidelines of the\nInternational Council on Animal Care. A total of\nkg) were randomly divided into a magnesium-\nstent group (n = 15), a plastic-stent group (n =\n15), and a control group (n = 15). Rabbits in\nthe magnesium- and plastic-stent groups under-\nwent stent placement in the lower third of the\nexchange wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was\ninserted through the mouth and into the stom-\nach under fluoroscopic guidance. The stent-\ndelivery system was introduced over the\nguidewire until it reached the lower third of the\nesophagus. The stent was then released, accord-\ning to esophagography images obtained under\nfluoroscopic guidance. A balloon catheter (10 \u00d7\n40 mm) was inflated within the stent to achieve\nfull stent expansion. Repeat esophagography\nwas performed to confirm the degree of stent\nexpansion and exclude esophageal perforation.\nAnimals in the control group did not undergo\nstent insertion.\nFollow up\nEsophagography was performed under general\nanesthesia and in the upright position prior to\nstent placement, and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks follow-\ning stent insertion. Stent migration, stent patency,\nand diameter of the stented esophagus were com-\npared between the two groups.\nHistological examination\nFive animals in each group were euthanized\nat each time point to compare tissue reactions.\nThe inserted stent was carefully removed from\nthe resected esophageal sample. The silicone-\ncovered magnesium stent was knitted using a\nmagnesium line and comprised 420 mesh cells.\nConsidering that the support provided by the\nstent was mainly attributable to the mesh cells,\nthe stent-degradation rate was determined by\ncalculating the percentage of degraded mesh\ncells. A mesh cell was considered to be degraded\nif one of its four sides appeared discontinuous\nunder microscopic observation. Minor, moder-\nate, and severe degradation of the magnesium-\nand > 50% broken mesh cells in the total\nnumber of mesh cells.\nThe stented and control esophageal samples were\nfixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for a mini-\nmum of 48 h, passed through a series of graded\nparaffin. Serial paraffin-embedded, esophageal\ncross-sections were stained with hematoxylin and\neosin (HE) to evaluate the inflammatory reaction\nbased on revised inflammation scores [Kornowski\net al. 1998]. The scoring was performed as fol-\nlows: 0 = no submucosal inflammatory cell infil-\ntration; 1 = inflammatory cells infiltrating less\nthan one third of the submucosa; 2 = inflamma-\ntory cells infiltrating more than one third but not\nthe entire submucosa; and 3 = inflammatory cells\ninfiltrating the entire submucosa. Masson tri-\nchrome staining was used to assess submucosal\ncollagen deposition. Esophageal samples were\nimmunostained with mouse anti-proliferating cell\nnuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (1:100 dilu-\ntion) (NeoMarkers, Thermo Fisher Scientific\nInc., Fremont, CA, USA) and mouse monoclonal\n-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) antibody (1:50\ndilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., CA,\nUSA) via the Elivision immunohistochemical\ntechnique. Negative controls were prepared by\nomitting the primary antibodies. The pathologist\nwho reviewed the specimens and performed the\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(1)\n14 http://tag.sagepub.com\nanalysis was blinded to the animal randomization,\ntreatment procedures, and follow-up protocols.\nStatistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad\nSoftware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for\nstatistical analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to\ncompare nonparametric data. Continuous varia-\nbles were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard devia-\ntion, and categorical variables as numbers or\npercentages. One-way and two-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) was used to compare the\noverall changes in esophageal diameter following\nstent insertion and at each follow-up time point,\nand to compare the PCNA proliferation index\nand collagen area at each follow-up time point\nwithin or between the control and stented groups.\nBefore one-way ANOVA, the homogeneity of\nvariance and normal distribution of the depend-\nent variables were assessed using the Shapiro\u00ad\nWilk test. Statistical significance was defined as\nResults\nMagnesium-silicone stent and its mechanical\nevaluation\nThe silicone membrane had a uniform thickness of\n100 m, it was tightly wrapped and fixed to the\ncross-linked, knitted, bare magnesium or plastic\nmesh tube and maintained its size and morphology\ndue to its excellent flexibility and elasticity. The\nsilicone-covered magnesium stent displayed good\nelastic deformation properties owing to its ability\nto spring back after compression, with no silicone\nmembrane tearing or ablations after 46 repeated\ncompressions (compression distance: 0\u00ad8 mm).\nThe magnesium stent showed a radial force of 0.89\nrespectively, which was similar to that for the plas-\ntic stent (p > 0.05) at the same compression dis-\nplacement (Figure 1c). Thus, the silicone-coated\nmagnesium stents possessed good flexibility and\nelasticity, and could provide enough support\nagainst lesion compression when used in vivo.\nBiodegradation of magnesium-silicone stent in\nvitro\nThe degradation behaviors of the magnesium-\nsilicone stents in terms of the magnesium mass\nlost were determined in buffer solutions with pH\nmass of the silicone-coated wires was 96.3% \u00b1\ntively (p < 0.01). However, despite a faster speed\nof degradation in acidic solution, the silicone-\ncoated wires maintained 73.4% of their mass\nweight at 4 weeks, indicating that silicone-coated\nmagnesium was a reasonable choice of material\nfor the fabrication of biodegradable stents in\nterms of possible retention time.\nIntervention procedure\nStenting was successful in all 30 rabbits using\nmagnesium and plastic stents. All rabbits toler-\nated the procedure well. Procedure-related\nadverse events, including esophageal perforation\nand bleeding, did not occur during or following\nstent insertion. Esophagography revealed that the\ncontrast agent passed smoothly through the\nstented esophagus in both groups (Figure 3a and\nb). No immediate stent migration into the stom-\nach occurred after stent placement.\nFollow up\nAll rabbits in both groups underwent regular\nesophagography; no animal died during follow\nup. Stent migration occurred in six rabbits in the\nmagnesium-stent group (1 week, one rabbit; 2\nweeks, one rabbit; and 4 weeks, four rabbits), and\nthe plastic stent migrated in three rabbits (one at\nFigure 2.

Quantitative analysis of the PCNA-\npositive cells revealed no significant difference in\nproliferation index between the two stented\ngroups and the control (p > 0.05).

Masson\nstaining revealed that collagen was mainly local-\nized in the submucosa, with no significant differ-\nences between the stented groups and the control\ngroup at each follow-up time point (p > 0.05),\nindicating that the tissue reaction to injury caused\nby stent dilation and degradation was similar to\nthat in the control group (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nWe determined the feasibility of, and tissue\nresponse to biodegradable magnesium-stent\ninsertion into the normal esophagus of rabbits.\nOur main findings are as follows. (a) Silicone-\ncovered magnesium stents provided reliable\nradial force comparable with plastic stents.\n(b) The procedural success rate of magnesium-\nstent insertion was 100%, with the stents provid-\ning good support for at least 2 weeks before\nundergoing rapid biodegradation in vivo.\n(c) Stenting effectively resulted in esophageal wall\nremodeling, which was associated with minimal\ninjury and inflammatory reaction. BSE, including\nrefractory peptic, caustic, anastomotic, and pos-\ntradiotherapy strictures, may cause difficulty in\nfeeding and greatly affect quality of life [Ferguson,\nEsophageal stent insertion can effectively recana-\nlize the occluded lumen without open surgery and\nis widely used to treat malignant esophageal\nobstruction [Na et al. 2013]. However, since\nlong-term or permanent stent insertion is associ-\nated with stent migration, esophageal perforation,\nfistula, and even hemorrhage, it cannot be used to\ntreat BSE. We had previously developed a retriev-\nable, temporary stent and a temporary, drug-\neluting stent to treat benign cardia strictures, with\ngood treatment outcomes. However, the insertion\nof these stents was nevertheless associated with\ncomplications during stent retrieval and stent\nmigration into the stomach. Ideally, stents for\nBSE should provide enough force to tear the\nstricture and then completely biodegrade to\nreduce complications caused by stent placement,\nwithout precluding repeated stent insertion. The\nmagnesium alloy we employed is rigid and under-\ngoes in vivo degradation [Gu et al. 2009].\nThis prevents a postimplantation inflammatory\nresponse and tissue proliferation, and thus, the\nFigure 4. Both the epithelial (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells) and smooth muscle cell layers\nwere significantly thinner in the magnesium- and plastic-stent groups than in the control group (magnification\n\u00d7400; the yellow and red lines indicate the thickness of the epithelial and smooth muscle actin [SMA] layers,\nrespectively). *p < 0.05 for comparisons between the control and the stented groups.\nY-Q Zhu, K Yang et al.\nhttp://tag.sagepub.com 17\nalloy is ideal for in vivo stents [Li et al. 2015].\nHowever, this magnesium alloy undergoes rapid\ndegradation (nearly 50% degradation after 1 week\nin vitro). Rapid degradation can lead to rapid loss\nof the mechanical properties of the alloy, making it\ndifficult to maintain long-term structural support\nafter implantation to effectively treat the disease\n[Wong et al. 2010]. Silicone has excellent elastic-\nity, coating properties, and is resistant to in vivo\ndegradation. In this study, magnesium alloy wires\nwere used as rigid stent struts, and silicone mem-\nbranes were used to cover the magnesium struts.\nThe main advantages of this design included:\n(a) stabilization of the magnesium alloy stent\nstructure; (b) bonding of the wire crossing points;\n(c) improvement of repeated radial expansibility\nand contractibility; (d) isolation of the magnesium\nalloy, preventing it from coming into direct\ncontact with bodily fluids and increasing biodeg-\nradation time; (e) maintenance of stent structure\nduring degradation of the magnesium alloy;\n(f) excretion of the silicone membrane through\nthe stool after stent degradation.\nMechanical tests showed that under different\ncompression distances, this stent has excellent\nrecovery properties. After nearly 50 compres-\nsions, the material could still maintain its original\nmechanical compressive strength. This illustrates\nthat the silicone-stabilized magnesium alloy tubu-\nlar stent can maintain its mechanical properties\nand structural stability.\nStent degradation rate directly affects the struc-\ntural support provided by the stent. In vitro exper-\niments revealed that the silicone coating increased\nthe degradation time of the magnesium alloy. In\nneutral PBS, 60% of the original mass remained\nafter 10 weeks, while in acidic PBS, complete\ndegradation occurred within 10 weeks. In vivo\nof the inserted magnesium-silicone mesh had bio-\ndegraded at 1 and 2 weeks of follow up, respec-\ntively, indicating that the stent provided good\nsupport up to 2 weeks in the rabbit esophagus.\nThe magnesium-silicone stent rapidly biode-\ngraded, lost radial force and collapsed after\n2 weeks. All the above data indicate that magne-\nsium-silicone stents effectively provided good\nsupport for at least 2 weeks.\nThrombus formation and distal embolism are\nmajor problems with magnesium stents inserted\nin the coronary artery [Haude et al. 2013].\nHowever, in our study, the degraded stents,\nincluding the nonbiodegradable silicone, were\nsafely excreted from the body. Two magnesium-\nsilicone stents that migrated into the stomach\nwhen their mechanical support was lost were con-\nfirmed to have been safely excreted from the body\nbefore 4 weeks.\nThe basic concept underlying the treatment of\nBSEs is to tear the fibrous connective tissue or\nhyperplastic smooth muscle layer, and provide\nenough support until the esophageal wall has\nhealed. Our previous work has indicated that the\noptimal duration of stenting for cardia strictures\nTanaka and colleagues reported the use of a poly-\nlactic stent for the treatment of benign gastroin-\ntestinal tract stenosis, and this ultraflex-type stent\nmade from machine-knitted polylactic acid\nmonofilaments showed better radial force than a\nmetallic wall stent. However, this stent was diffi-\ncult to compress into a delivery system, and its\ninsertion [Tanaka et al. 2006]. Although the\neffective support time for the magnesium-silicone\nstent was only 2 weeks, we believe that it may still\nyield good treatment outcomes in BSE, mainly\nbecause on pathological examination, we found\nthat the epithelial and SMA layers had already\nstretched and become much thinner at 1 and\n2 weeks, indicating the remodeling process had\nbeen completed. Moreover, our previous studies\nwere mainly focused on cardia strictures, which\noften require greater dilation for longer durations\nthan esophageal strictures [Ferguson, 2005; Na\nThe other pathological findings, including inflam-\nmation scores on HE staining and esophageal\nwall injury assessed using PCNA staining of the\nepithelial layer and submucosal collagen deposi-\ntion, revealed that magnesium-stent insertion or\nbiodegradation itself did not cause severe damage\nto the esophageal wall, induce significant inflam-\nmatory reaction, or result in scar formation. In\nthis study, we consider that the rabbit was suita-\nble as a model of the human esophagus as it has\nsimilar esophageal wall structure and gastric pH\nconditions to humans. The muscle layer transi-\ntions from striated muscle in the upper esophagus\nto smooth muscle in the lower esophagus. The\ngastric pH during the digestion of food material is\nmaintained between 1 and 2. Both these proper-\nties are similar to those observed in humans\n[Davies et al. 2003]. However, the entire\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(1)\n18 http://tag.sagepub.com\nesophagus and the first half of the stomach are\ncovered by squamous epithelium, which is differ-\nent to the case in humans.\nThis study has some limitations. (a) The magne-\nsium-silicone stent was inserted into a normal\nrabbit esophagus; the tissue reaction in the nor-\nmal esophagus may differ from that in an esopha-\ngeal stricture. (b) Effective support was provided\nfor only 2 weeks; further research is required to\ndelay biodegradation and improve the duration of\nsupport. (c) This stent should be applied in a\nBSE model to investigate fully its feasibility, effi-\ncacy, and tissue reaction in vivo.\n"
