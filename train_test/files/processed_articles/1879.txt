Introduction\nThe prevalence of obesity (Ob) has increased in the United\nStates and most European countries during the last decade and\nis continuing to rise [1,2]. This has also been the experience in\nother affluent and developing societies [2]. The International\nObesity Task Force, a non-government organization that\nstudies the obesity epidemic, estimates one out of every five\npeople worldwide is overweight or obese. Obesity, defined as a\nbody mass index (BMI) higher than 30, has increased 8% in the\nestimated from the most recent National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) of the Nation Health Centers of\nDiseaseControlandPrevention.Ithasalsobeenestimatedthat\nage-adjusted extreme obesity (ExtOb), defined as a body mass\nindex greater than 40, has increased from 2.9% [NHANES III\nduring the same time period [1]. The costs of disease\nprevention and medical management of obese patients are\nof increasing concern for society [1].\nPatients undergoing cardiac surgery with excessive body\nmass index are likely to have other comorbid factors including\nthe five obesity-related illnesses: type II diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and coronary artery\ndisease [3]. These illnesses account for approximately 85% of\nthe increased health problems and economic burden of\nobesity [3,4]. Long-term follow-up of the original Framingham\ncohort revealed that obesity, measured by Metropolitan\nRelative Weight, was a significant independent predictor of\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) [5]. In addition to CVD, the risk\nof ischemic stroke in the obese is twice as high as the normal\npopulation. Obesity has also been positively linked to\nmyocardial dysfunction in patients even without coronary\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/ejcts\n* Corresponding author.

A direct relationship between diastolic\ndysfunction and systolic impairment has been described in\nthe context of excessive BMI.\nThere is currently no systematic assessment of the\nevidence available regarding extremely obese patients and\ntheir perioperative risks. Specifically, the scarcity of data\nregarding the extremely obese patient population in cardiac\nsurgery, as defined by the NHANES criteria, is addressed. Risk\nstratification and informed consent are the primary motiva-\ntion to establish patient-associated factors leading to\npotentially increased morbidity and mortality.\n2. Methods\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 1920 consecutive\npatients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of\nWisconsin Hospitals and Clinics between January 1, 1999 and\nventricular assist device (VAD) surgeries.\nPreoperative data were collected using the Society of\nThoracic Surgery (STS) data criteria; these included: age,\ngender, height,weight, date ofsurgery, currentsmoking habit,\ndiabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and pre-\noperative creatinine level in serum. The operative information\nreviewed included: cross-clamp time, cardio-pulmonary\nbypass time, the use of an intraaortic balloon pump, blood\nproduct use, and postoperative ventilation time. Postopera-\ntive information included the overall complication incidence\nas well as specific adverse events associated with cardiac\nsurgery, including: deep sternal infection, septicemia, pre-\nsence of a transient ischemic attach (TIA) or cerebral vascular\naccident (CVA), prolonged ventilation (>24 h), pulmonary\nembolism (PE), pneumonia, renal failure (RF) with or without\ndialysis, heart block, cardiac arrest (CA), adverse events\nrelated to anticoagulation (DIC and HIT), tamponade,bleeding\nrequiring reoperation, graft occlusion, valvular dysfunction,\natrial fibrillation (AF), gastrointestinal complications, inf-\normation related to total ventilation time, and reoperation for\nbleeding or non-cardiac reoperations. Furthermore, outcomes\nof operative death, 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS), and\nintensive care unit stay (ICU) were analyzed.\nBody mass index which serves as an indirect measure of\ntotal body fat, was calculated using the patients height and\nweight [BMI = weight (pounds)/height (inches)2 \u00c2 703)] or\n[BMI = kg/m2] at the time of surgery in accordance to NHANES\nrweight BMI (20--30) were defined as the non-obese\nreference group (NonOb). Obesity was defined as BMI 30--\n40 and extreme obesity as a BMI ! 40 [1]. To define the BMI\ncategories, the range intervals are closed on the left. A\npatient with a BMI of !30 but less than 40 is included in the\nobese group. Patients whose BMI was lower than 20 (n = 53)\nwere excluded from the analysis.\n2.1. Statistical methods\nContinuous variables are presented as mean \u00c6 one\nstandard deviation. Categorical variables are shown as the\npercentage of the sample in a given category. A Kruskal--\nWallis test was used for comparing medians across groups. For\ncategorical variables, Fisher's exact test was used. For pair-\nwise contrasts between groups, the Wilcoxon rank sum was\nused for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for\ncategorical variables. All computed p values are two-sided. In\nevery instance a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nThere was no adjustment to the significance level for the\nnumber of hypotheses being tested. All computations were\nperformed in R version 1.9.1 for Windows XP (R Development\nFor the graphic representation of BMI complication rate,\nlength intervals, closed on the left, as discussed above.

We critically appraised the literature available after\nsystematic searches of the terms: obesity, body mass index,\ncardiac surgery, CABG, complication rate, valve surgery,\nmortality, and morbidity. We reviewed all literature available\nafter the following terms searched, but excluded publica-\ntions pre-1985 to prevent excessive historical bias. Further-\nmore, studies that did not provide control group or reviews of\nless than 50 obese patients were excluded. Databases\nsearched for these terms included: Medline, Up to Date,\nand University of Wisconsin electronic library systems.\n3. Results\nThe patient and treatment characteristics of the study\npopulation are detailed in Table 1. Obese patients with BMI\n30--40 in our study do not demonstrate an overall increased\ncomplication rate (46.8%; p = 0.8). However, this group of\npatients had significantly increased prolonged ventilation\n9.6; p = 0.04) as inpatient when compared with the non-\nobese reference category (BMI 20--30, see Table 3).

This corresponds\nwith previous reports of patients undergoing cardiac surgery\nwith elevated BMI (see Table 4). However, the BMI ! 40 has\nnot been previously investigated in this context and presents\na novel evaluation of clinical data. Although the low BMI\ngroup (<20) showed a trend towards increased overall\ncomplication rates, it did not prove to be statistically\nsignificant when compared to the normal BMI index\nAll other potential cardiac surgical complications eval-\nuated showed no important clinical differences between the\nBMI categories. This included sepsis, CVA or TIA, pulmonary\nembolism, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, or\nanticoagulation-related complications. The actual frequency\nof complications and its statistical significance is detailed in\nIn order to provide a graphic estimation of relative risks,\nthe complication rates observed were plotted against BMI\n(Fig. 1). This demonstrates clearly that no increase in overall\nmorbidity risk for patients with BMI 20--30 exists. For patients\nwith BMI indices less than 20 and greater than 30, a continual\nincrease of the complication rate is apparent. A U-shaped\ncurve representing the frequency of complications and\npostoperative adverse events at the extremes of the BMI\nrange is evident.\n4. Discussion\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated\nmedical hazards are a considerable public health concern in\nmost developed countries. Specifically, body mass indices\ngreater than 30 are thought to be associated with excess\nsurgical risks. Both age-adjusted prevalences of obese as well\nas extremely obese patients are likely to increase according\nto current US Nation Health And Nutrition Examination\nSurvey [1] and European epidemiological data project\nA national health consensus conference on obesity surgery\ndescribed an increase in demand for bariatric surgery, with\npotential candidates having a BMI ! 40 (representing\napproximately 100 lb excess body weight for a male and\n80-lb excess for female patients). The Society for Bariatric\nSurgery noted an exponential increase of such operations\nmajor gastrointestinal procedures were performed in 2004 in\nthe US alone. The operative risks of gastric resections or\nbypass procedures are both procedure- and patient-related.\nThe risk stratification for other major surgical procedures\nhave not been well defined.\nIn the era of risk stratification and informed consent,\ncommonly applied estimation of open heart surgical risks may\nnot adequately aim to assess obesity as a risk factor in various\nscoring systems [7,8]. Additionally, the highly predictive\nEuroSCORE does not include BMI stratification for cardiac\nsurgical risk [9].\nThere are surprisingly few studies assessing complications\nin obese patients undergoing open heart surgery. Most\nauthors provide retrospective studies with limited insight\ninto selective adverse events, associated with coronary\nartery bypass grafting. Outcomes have not been shown to be\nadversely affected in patients below BMI of 40 in these\nstudies. This study primarily assessed mortality and morbid-\nity associated with BMI ! 40 and provides confirmation of low\nmortality in this patient group. Similarly, our evidence shows\nthat obese patients can have an acceptable perioperative\nand 30-day mortality rate. In fact, our outcome data for the\npatients defined as extremely obese is similar to the non-\nobese patient group. A tertiary medical center with surgical\nexperience in this patient group provides expertise that\ncompensates for certain potential complications (Table 2).\nKuduvalli et al. reported an increased frequency of\nprolonged ventilation in patients with a BMI > 35 [10]. We\nconfirmed that prolonged ventilation, based upon the\ndefinition of postoperative intubation greater than 24 h, is\nlikely in obese and extremely obese patients undergoing\nPatient and treatment characteristics stratified by obesity category\nVariable Non-obese,\nObese,\nExtreme Obese,\np value\n(overall)\np value\n(non-obese vs\nobese)\np value\n(non-obese vs\nextreme obese)\nPatient factors\nOperative details\nmajor cardiac surgery. The use of bronchodilators following\ncardiac surgery was found to be increased in one prospective\nstudy [10]. The incidence of postoperative pneumonia did not\ndiffer across our BMI categories. Others observed frequent\nrespiratory impairment during the postoperative phase, but\nthis has neither been well defined nor established in other\nreviews [11]. Obese patients are more likely to have a low\nrespiratory reserve with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch\nand decreased functional residual capacity. This, however,\nhas not led to adverse outcomes in intensive care medicine in\nthe obese patient.\nOur finding of increased acute renal failure, defined by\ncreatinine rise two times from baseline and greater than\n2.0 mM/ml, has not been previously reported in association\nwith cardiac surgery in obese patients. However, this was not\nassociated with a statistically significant increase in patients\nrequiring renal dialysis for either obese or extremely obese\npatients. A previous prospective study did not show an\nassociation between acute renal failure and body mass index\nThe previous reported finding that obese patients suffer a\nhigher incidence of postoperative superficial or deep wound\ninfections (INF) could not be verified in this retrospective\nanalysis. The low risk observed in both the obese and\nextremely obese patient groups of sternal wound infections,\nprobably reflect the use of the STS definition applied and the\nexpertise developed at this tertiary center with high\nprevalence of morbid obesity. Gaynes et al. [12] reported\na similar experience. In other studies, the expected\nincidence of postoperative mediastinitis has been linked to\nobesity but maybe mostly associated with diabetes mellitus\nand perioperative hyperglycemia with the presence of other\ncomorbid conditions prevalent in this patient group [13--15].\nComplications associated with BMI classifications\nComplication Non-obese\n(NonOb),\nObese,\nExtreme obese,\np value\n(overall)\np value\n(obese vs NonOb)\np value\n(extreme obese vs\nNonOb)\nReoperation, n (%)\nMortality, n (%)\n* Result of Fisher's exact test in single patient.\nFig. 1. Complication rates in open heart surgery plotted against BMI intervals.\nPatients were bundled to the closest BMI in successive intervals of approximate\nstandard errors for each BMI-specific complication rate. Numbers above bars\nare the number of observations in the BMI interval; nine patients whose BMI\nexceeded 48.8 were excluded (complication rate 0.22 for these nine patients).\nThe bundled groups are different than the BMI categories analyzed in our study.\nBirkmeyer et al. [16] describe the rate of wound infections as\nup to three times higher in obese patients after adjustment\nof other predictors of this outcome. Moulton et al. [17]\nstudied patients with a BMI > 30 and found increased\nsuperficial sternotomy wound infections and conduit harvest\nsite infections. Similarly, a large retrospective study con-\nducted by Engelmann et al. concluded that wound infections\nare more frequent in obese patients and observed a high\nincidence of deep sternal wound infections. Sternal wound\ninfections were a major finding in five of the eight series\nreviewed. Loop et al. [13] established an odds ratio of 2.9\nassociated with obesity for sternal wound complications in a\nmultivariate analysis of 6504 patients. Our population group\ndid not show increased incision-related superficial or deep\nsternotomy wound infections (Table 2).\nFindings regarding bleeding complications observed in this\nsetting are controversial. A prospective cohort described by\nBirkmeyer et al. [16] showed decreased postoperative\nbleeding in obese patients (BMI > 31). This was not confirmed\nby a multivariate analysis of extremely obese patients with\nBMI > 36 [16]. Similarly, our obese patient group had a\nreduced risk of postoperative bleeding (Table 3). This may\nappear counterintuitive on first assessment but little\ninformation regarding bleeding propensity and hemostatic\nproperties after major surgery in obese patients is available.\nOnly two studies with small patient cohorts studied\nproduct transfusion rates in obese patients after cardiac\nsurgery. Uva et al. [18] found an increased transfusion rate\nwhile Ranucci et al. [11] found a decreased transfusion rate.\nThe indications for transfusions and parameters used for\nblood products were poorly defined and no conclusive\nevidence is available to date [11,18]. The obese and\nextremely obese patients in our cohort did not show\nincreased hemorrhage tendencies and required no more\nfrequent blood product transfusions than non-obese cardiac\nsurgical patients. In fact, a marked decrease for the need in\nreoperation for bleeding was observed in both obese patient\ngroups in our retrospective analysis. Blood product use,\ndefined as transfusion intraoperatively or postoperatively\naccording to STS guidelines, was similar across all three\ngroups and does not explain the decreased reoperation rate\nfor obese patients.\nA higher frequency of postoperative hypertension requir-\ning pharmacological intervention was not observed in our\nobese patient group. This association was previously found in\na single prospective study published in 1985 by Koshal et al.\n[10] but not confirmed by other authors. The high\npreoperative prevalence of hypertension as a co-morbid\nfactor in this group does not pose a clinically prominent\nproblem postoperatively. Similarly, diabetes mellitus present\npreoperatively in 54.5% of the extremely obese patients and\n37.9% of the obese patients has not been shown to result in\nclinically relevant postoperative morbidity. Little informa-\ntion is available regarding the metabolic syndrome and\nglucose metabolism derangements in the obese cardiac\npatient in the postoperative phase. Contrary to bariatric\nsurgery, where significant weight loss, remission of diabetes\nmellitus and improvement of lipid serum levels are observed,\ncardiac surgery in the extremely obese patient does not\nprovide therapeutic interventions for these pre-existing\ncomorbidities [19]. Continued long-term medical manage-\nment is essential in improving life span.\nIn a relatively small retrospective study, Brandt et al. [20]\nhave reported no statistically significant complication\nincreases in obese patients. They report a discrepancy\nbetween total procedure time of CABG and discuss technical\nconsiderations in their obese patient group [20]. Procedural\ndifficulty or operative hazards encountered in obese patients\ncannot be analyzed in this context. As with reoperations, for\nexample, a certain level of expertise is required to avoid\noperative pitfalls as well as postoperative complications. It is\napparent that with relatively minor adjustments intraopera-\ntive problems can be avoided.\nMethodological differences alone may not conclusively\nexplain the range of findings of the studies compared in\nTable 4. Most evidence provided has been extrapolated from\nrelatively small prospective and retrospective studies. Two\nprospective multi-center studies were conducted adjusting\nfor confounding factors including preoperative comorbidities\nAlthough a consensus definition for obesity and extreme\nobesity exists according to World Health Organization (WHO)\nand NHANES, authors have used variable BMI cutoffs to define\ntheir patient groups (Table 4). Other authors have defined\nobesity by percentage change from ideal body weight\ncalculations [5]. The comparability of the studies available\nis therefore limited and does not allow for meta-analysis.\nThe majority of previous studies available have been\nconducted with the primary focus on coronary bypass surgery\noutcomes. Our patient population consisted of both valve and\ncoronary surgical patients combined similar to the studies by\nEngelman et al. and Moulton et al. [17].

Although patients with cardiac surgery\nhave similar perioperative complications, we assessed a more\nheterogeneous population of patients and therefore possibly\nintroduced confounding variables. Our reference population\nis representative for a large tertiary surgical care center in\nthe United States. The referral patterns reflect the\ndemographics of this region and include the largest patient\ncohort described of extremely obese patients.\nRisk stratification is the ultimate motivation for establish-\ning complication rates in obese patients undergoing cardiac\nsurgery. Preoperative evaluation of obese patient undergoing\ncardiac surgery provides an opportunity for an interdisci-\nplinary approach to allow accurate risk stratification and\ninformed patient choices. The approach for consenting\npatients, and the medico legal issues for consenting patients,\nhas become a focus of daily clinical practice. Our data\nprovides evidence that cardiac surgery is safe even for the\nextremely obese patient population.\nSince obesity is a chronic condition, a potential risk\nreduction based on weight loss alone has to take into account\nthe recidivism of weight loss programs. Behavior modifica-\ntions, exercise, and diet are considered the mainstay of\ntreatment for obesity. Few patients are successful in\nreducing their weight preoperatively, although some evi-\ndence suggests that patients generally have better recovery\nand increased mobility with major surgical procedures after\npreoperative weight reduction [21,22]. Genetic factors may\nbe responsible for up to 70% of the variation of patients\nweights [23]. It is critical to appreciate that patient's weights\nwill fluctuate within 10% of a physiological set value and the\nregulation of BMI involves maintenance of energy balance as\nwell as nutrient composition and physiological feedback\nmechanisms. Chronic imbalance between energy intake and\nenergy expenditure seen in a majority of severely obese\npatients results in adipose tissue mass increases.\nLeptin, a circulating protein of lipid homeostasis, may\nprovide novel approaches to regulate adipose tissue pro-\nliferation and could theoretically reduce body mass indices in\nshort term prior to cardiac surgery [24]. However, any effect\non perioperative outcomes at present is speculative and this\nrequires clinical investigation. Given the polygenic nature of\nsevere obesity, the current constraints of weight loss\nprograms, and the acute nature of cardiac diseases amenable\nto surgical intervention, deferring such procedures in obese\npatients may not be justifiable.\nThe limitations to this study are mostly linked to the\nretrospective nature of the analysis and to the lack of the\nability to adjust for confounding variables. BMI was used to\ndefine obesity in this study population. The concept of\nnormal weight and obesity are relative to the environmental\nand cultural factors, with every population presenting as a\ncontinuum of height and weight.

Impact of body mass index and albumin on morbidity and\nobesity in the Asian population, for example, differ\ncompared to the applied NHANES population criteria. The\nclinical guidelines employed in this study are applied to the\ngeneral population and are not specific to the cardiac surgical\npatients. This allows for a selection bias.\nThe clinical guidelines established by NHANES were\nemployed in this study. They refer to the general population\nand are not specific to the cardiac surgical patients. This\nintroduces a potential bias. The relatively small denominator\nfor patients at the extreme end of the BMI spectrum of this\nstudy limits the statistical power and did not yield sufficient\nobservations for a multivariate analysis of relatively\ninfrequent complications. The occurrence of deep vein\nthrombosis, for example, would require a prospective\nassessment, as this is not currently part of the STS\ncomplication data set. A prospective evaluation of obesity\nas a risk factor for specific complications in cardiac surgery\nwould, therefore, require pooled data from multiple centers\nin order to provide satisfactory power calculations to detect\nincreased risk ratios with certainty.\nIn summary, extreme obesity according to our study and\nother data available is not associated with an increased\nmortality after cardiac surgery. Extremely obese patients\nhave a statistically significant increase in frequency of\nspecific complications, including prolonged ventilation and\nacute renal failure not requiring hemodialysis (HD). This may\nresult in prolonged length of stay and may have economic\nhealth care consequences. Although it has been established\nthat obese patients are not at an excessive adverse risk while\ning cardiopulmonary bypass [17], further clinical investiga-\ntion is required focusing on specific cardiac surgical\nprocedures. To exclude patients from cardiac surgery due\nto high body mass index or quote excessive operative risks\nmay not accurately reflect the evidence currently available.\nReferences\n[1] Flegal KM, Carroll MD, Ogden CL, Johnson CL.
