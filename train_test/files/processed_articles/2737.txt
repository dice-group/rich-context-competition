Pearson correlation was used to explore correlates of\nphysical and mental SRH across ethnic groups.\nResults: While age was positively associated with poor physical SRH, ethnic groups differed in the\neffect of age on mental SRH. Age was positively associated with mental SRH among Vietnamese,\nFilipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and African American individuals, but this was not so for other\nAsians, Mexicans, other Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites. Chinese and Cubans were the only\ngroups where female gender was associated with poor physical and mental SRH. With other Asians\nbeing an exception, education and income were protective against poor physical and mental SRH in\nall ethnic groups. Ethnic groups also differed in how their mental and physical SRH reflect BMI.\nConclusion: Demographic and socioeconomic determinants of physical and mental SRH vary across\nethnic groups. Poor physical and mental SRH are differently shaped by social determinants across\nethnic groups. These ethnic differences may cause bias in health measurement in ethnically diverse\npopulations.\n",

Data were\ncollected by the Institute for Social Research (ISR),\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Study design and\nsampling have been described in detail previously.37\nParticipants\nThe NCS-R sampled 9282 individuals, the NSAL\nsampled 6082 individuals, and the NLAAS sampled\n4649 individuals. This study included a national\nhousehold probability sample of 18\nand 7587 non-Latino Whites. All participants were\nadults (aged 18 or older). Participants were either\nAmerican or immigrants in the United States.\nInterview\nMost interviews were face-to-face and were conducted\nwithin participants' homes. The rest of the interviews\nwere conducted using telephone interviews. The\naverage response rate in the CPES was 72.7%.\nMeasures\nPhysical and Mental Self-Rated Health. Participants were\nasked \"How would you rate your overall physical/\nmental health - excellent, very good, good, fair, or\npoor?\" Responses included five categories: excellent,\nvery good, good, fair, and poor. Single-item SRH\nmeasures have shown strong correlation with multi-\nitem health measures.38 Single-item SRH also predicts\nmortality, net of demographics, socioeconomic status\n(SES), and medical risk factors.15 Test-retest reliability\nfor single-item SRH measures is high.38 These measures\nalso show strong correlations with standard scales on\ndistress and well-being.38\nDemographic and Socioeconomic Factors. Demographic\nfactors included age (continuous measure) and\ngender (dichotomous measure, male as the reference\ncategory). The study also measured 2 socioeconomic\nindicators, namely education level (less than high\nschool [reference category], high school graduate,\nsome college, and college graduate) and income\n(continuous measure).\nBody Mass Index (BMI) Class. The CPES measured\nBMI level based on self-reported weight and height.\nWeight and height were collected in pounds (1 pound\nand 40 kg/m2, BMI class was categorized as under-\nweight, normal weight, obesity class I, obesity class\nII, and obesity class III. Although self-reported BMI\nunderestimates actual BMI,39 BMI calculated based on\nself-reported weight and height is closely correlated\nwith BMI based on direct measures of height and\nStatistical Analysis\nAs CPES has used a complex sampling design, we\nused Stata version 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station,\nTX, USA) for data analysis. Standard errors were\nestimated using the Taylor series approximation. We\nperformed Pearson correlation coefficients within\neach ethnic group. Mental and physical SRH were\nboth treated as continuous measures, with a higher\nscore indicating worse condition. P values less than\n0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nof the total sample) were non-Hispanic Whites, while\nthe remaining 10650 individuals belonged to an ethnic\nminority. Following non-Hispanic Whites, there were\nsample). Table 1 summarizes the sample size for each\nethnic group.\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 2 provides a summary of characteristics across\neach ethnic group. Mental SRH was measured as better\nin Other Asians compared to non-Latino Whites and\nAfrican Americans.\nSeif et al\nCorrelates of Physical and Mental Self-rated Health\nTable 3 provides a summary of the correlation matrix\nbetween demographics, SES, and physical and mental\nSRH across ethnic groups. As shown in this table,\nwhile age was positively associated with poor physical\nSRH in all ethnic groups, ethnic groups differed in\nthe effect of age on mental SRH. Age was positively\nassociated with mental SRH among Vietnamese,\nFilipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and African\nAmerican individuals, but not among other Asians,\nMexicans, other Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites\n(Table 3).\nChinese and Cubans were the only groups where\ngender was associated with poor physical and mental\nSRH. With Other Asians being the only exception,\neducation and income were associated with physical\nand mental SRH in all ethnic groups (Table 3).\nEthnic groups differed in how their mental and\nphysical SRH reflect their BMI (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nMajor and systematic ethnic differences were found in\ndemographic and social determinants of physical and\nmental SRH in the United States population. While\nage was positively associated with poor physical SRH,\nethnic groups differed in the effect of age on mental\nSRH. Age was positively associated with mental SRH\namong Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto\nRican, and African American individuals, but not\namong other Asians, Mexicans, other Hispanics, and\nnon-Hispanic Whites. Chinese and Cubans were the\nonly groups where female gender was associated with\npoor physical and mental SRH. Education and income\nwere protective against poor physical and mental\nSRH in all ethnic groups, with Other Asians being\nan exception. Our findings also suggest that ethnic\ngroups differed in how their mental and physical SRH\nreflect high BMI.\nTable 1. Weighted and Unweighted Sample Size\nEthnicity Percent Number Weighted N\nBoth meaning and determinants of physical and\nmental SRH may be specific to ethnic groups. Our\nfindings are also consistent with previous research\nwhich has documented major ethnic differences in the\nassociations between mental and physical SRH and\npsychiatric disorders.12,26,28 It is still not clear how poor\nphysical and mental SRH reflect the past, current,\nand future health needs of individuals from diverse\nbackgrounds.25,29 Still, there is a need for additional\nresearch on ethnic differences on how demographics,\nOur finding has implications for clinical and public\nhealth practice. Based on these results, sole reliance\non single-item SRH measures will result in bias across\nethnically diverse population, as SRH is differently\ninfluenced by social and medical determinants across\nSRH measures are not ideal tools for the measurement\nof health disparities across ethnic groups.56 Using\nSRH items to screen individuals with a need for health\ncare may also result in the enrollment of a population\nwith heterogenic health care needs. Currently, physical\nand mental SRH items are being used as screening\ntools to detect individuals at high risk.57,58 Combining\nsingle-item SRH measures with other measures is\nrecommended,atleastinethnicallydiversepopulations.\nOur findings advocate for designing more accurate\nscreening tools for the screening of health problems\nin ethnically diverse populations. Although still useful\ninformation to assess, poor physical and mental SRH\ndoes not universally reflect demographic and SES\nstatus across all ethnic groups.\nThefindingsreportedhereemphasizethecomplexity\nand non-linear association between ethnicity,\ndemographic factors, socioeconomics, and SRH.12\nDifferent ethnic groups differ in how they perceive and\ninterpret health or illness, which influences their health\ncare use. Similarly, SES status may differently shape\nSRH of ethnic groups.28 There is a present need for\nthe creation of health measures that are comparable\nacross ethnic groups. Before then, SRH items should\nbe carefully used as a tool for comparison of health\nstatus across ethnic groups. It is still unclear why\ndemographic and SES differently shape the SRH of\ndifferent ethnic groups, and whether this variation is\nbiological or social.59-63 Ethnic groups differ in biology,\nas well as historical life experiences, knowledge, SES,\nour perception of health and illness.\nThe study is not free of limitations. First, due to its\ncross-sectional design, findings should be interpreted\nas associations not causations. Second, the sample\nMoghani Lankarani and Assari\nTable 2.

Third, validity\nof mental and physical SRH may depend on ethnicity.\nFourth, a number of confounders such as nativity,\nimmigration status, and number of years in the United\nStates were not included in this study. Fifth, we did\nnot use multivariable analysis, due to the exploratory\ndesign of this study. Sixth, single-item SRH measures\nare sensitive to the contextual effects of preceding\nquestions in survey instruments, which vary across\nCPES surveys.38 Finally, we did not measure social\ndesirabilityorcurrenthealthstatusinthisstudy.Despite\nall these limitations, using nationally representative data\nand a large sample size were 2 major strengths of the\ncurrent secondary analysis. To conclude, demographic\nand socioeconomic determinants of physical and\nmental SRH vary across ethnic groups. Poor physical\nand mental SRH are differently shaped by social\ndeterminants across ethnic groups. These ethnic\ndifferences may cause bias in health measurement in\nethnically diverse populations.\nEthical Approval\nThe CPES study protocol was approved by the\nUniversity of Michigan Institutional Review Board\n(IRB).
