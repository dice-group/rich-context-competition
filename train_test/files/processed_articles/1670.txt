In adolescents, there are limited\nstudies on the relationship between obesity and sleep duration. We found hypothesized\nthat an average sleep duration of <6 h in adolescents was associated with obesity. Data\nwere from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (ADD Health); a\npopulation for our study was 13 568. Weighted multiple logistic regression was used to\nidentify the relationship between obesity at Wave II and sleep duration, having adjusted\nfor skipping breakfast  2 /week; race, gender, parental income, TV  2 h per day,\ndepression, and obesity at Wave I. At Wave I, the mean age was 15.96 \u00b1 0.11 years;\nadolescents were obese. Adjusted analyses suggest that the effect of shortened sleep\nduration in Wave I was not significantly predictive of obesity in Wave II (P < 0.218).\nLongitudinally, depression and TV  2 h per day at Wave I was associated with a\nhigher risk of obesity at Wave II in adjusted analyses. Depressed adolescents were\nCI = 1.09\u00ad1.72). Environmental factors including TV  2 h per day and depression\nwere significantly associated with obesity; shortened sleep duration was not.

Previous research has identified a range\nof risk factors for obesity, including low levels of physical\nactivity, sedentary behaviour and easy access to energy-dense\naccumulate that short sleep duration may also play a critical\nrole. One explanation for this link could be that being awake\nlonger potentially gives children and adolescents more time to\neat and engage in a sedentary lifestyle (Finelli et al., 2006;\nNelson et al., 2006). Multiple cross-sectional studies across the\nage spectrum (Hasler et al., 2004) in both genders (Chaput\nhave identified associations between chronic short sleeping and\nCorrespondence: Christina J.

Further-\nmore, two studies have reported an association of obesity in\nadolescents with sleeping 6 h or less each week night (Noland\nDespite the increasing attention to the connection of sleep\nduration and obesity, there are still limited data exploring\nthese associations in the adolescent population (Gupta et al.,\n2002). Extensive research has focused on sleep regulatory\nmechanisms and developmental changes in adolescents (Cars-\nhave evaluated the association of short sleep duration and\nobesity in this population. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis\n(Cappuccio et al., 2008) of subjects across the lifespan, from\nchildhood to adulthood, incorporated studies predominantly\nfrom early childhood, not adolescence. Results were based on\nbivariate associations between sleep and obesity, without\nadjusting for other potential confounders.\nIn this study, we evaluated the longitudinal relationship\nbetween sleep duration and obesity in a large sample of\nadolescents from 12- to 18-years old. Based on previous studies\n2002), we hypothesized that an average sleep duration of <6 h\nin adolescents was associated with obesity.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nthe University of Pennsylvania. This was a secondary analysis\nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(ADD Health). ADD Health is a survey of youths, grades\n7\u00ad12, that provided national representation of the U.S. middle\npurpose of ADD Health was to explore the causes of health-\nrelated behaviours of adolescents and their outcomes in young\nSurvey procedures, described elsewhere (Resnick et al.,\n1997), were approved by the University of North Carolina\nstudents completed in-school surveys, and a subset of 20 745\nadolescents (and parents) then completed in-home surveys.\nstill not graduated from high school, including dropouts. The\ntwo sections of the ADD Health data include the restricted-use\ndata set and the public-use data set. Key differences between\nthe two sets of data are that the restricted-use data are the\nentire student sample, with more confidential information on\nthe participants, whereas the public-use data were half of the\nstudy, the restricted-use data sets from the first two waves were\nused.\nOutcome measures\nObesity\nHeight and weight were converted to BMI, the main outcome\nvariable. Variables were self-reported in Wave I, and self-\nreported and objectively measured during home interviews in\nWave II. For consistency, this study utilized self-reported\nheight and weight. In ADD Health, Goodman et al. (2000)\nreported a strong correlation between objectively measured\nClassification of sleep duration\nSleep duration was the main predictor variable of interest this\nanalysis. For the ADD Health study, one question addressed\nlength of sleep. In both Waves I and II, adolescents were asked\nduring the in-home interview \u00d4How many hours of sleep do\nyou usually get?\u00d5 Based on previous studies (Hasler et al., 2004;\nVioque et al., 2000), we defined short sleep duration as <6 h.\nAdditionally, two other studies have demonstrated some\nassociation with sleep <6 h and obesity in adolescents\nAdolescents with extreme sleep hours (<2 or > 14 h) were\ncoded as missing for this analysis. In Wave I, a total of 29\nsubjects were excluded due to extreme sleep hours; eight with\nsubjects were excluded due to extreme sleep hours; two with\nNutrition\nTwo nutritional variables documented in the literature\nincreasing the risk of obesity were assessed. One variable was\nthe frequency of eating in a fast food restaurant. The other\nvariable selected was whether children skipped breakfast.\nThis criterion was selected based on several cross-sectional\nSiega-Riz et al., 1998) that reported BMI or weights of\nchildren and adolescents who skipped breakfast as being\nhigher than those who had breakfast. For both these\nvariables, responses were categorized less than twice a week\nor  twice a week.\nPhysical inactivity\nInitially, inactivity score was based on three questions, which\nused standard 7-day recall of the number of hours spent: (1)\nwatching television; (2) watching videos; and (3) playing video\nor computer games. Analysis of activity using all three\nquestions had revealed a peak of 60 h per week of inactivity;\napproximately 8.5 h per day. It was thought that these results\nmay have been erroneous as subjects may have been multi-\ntasking or reporting video watching as also television watch-\ning. Therefore, total inactivity score was based on only one\nquestion, the 7-day recall of television viewing. Based on\nprevious studies reporting that 2 h per day of television\nviewing led to an increased risk of weight gain, the total\ninactivity score was  categorized 2 h per day or <2 h per day,\nwith a sedentary lifestyle defined as 2 h per day (Eisenmann\nDepression\nDepression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudy-Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D has been widely\nused in studies of adolescents\u00d5 emotional health.

They determined that scores  24\nmaximized the sensitivity and specificity of the CES-D for\npredicting major depressive disorder as defined by the Diag-\nnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third\nEdition (DSM-III), criteria (Roberts et al., 1991). As used by\nRoberts et al. (1991), depression was defined as a cutoff of 24\npoints. This cutoff was used as a dichotomous variable to\nindicate depression.\nAdditional covariates\nAdditional covariates included in the analysis were age, race,\ngender and parental income. In the ADD Health database,\nrace was self-identified among the following categories as white\n(non-Hispanic), black or African American (non-Hispanic),\nHispanic, Asian American, and other. Socioeconomic status\nwas based on parental report of household income.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcome for this study was obesity, defined as\nBMI > 95th percentile for age. All analyses were performed\nusing Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA), and were conducted using methods for\nsurvey data, with grand sampling weights from Wave II used\nto provide nationally representative estimates. Additionally,\nthe cluster design of the ADD Health study was adjusted for\nall analyses. Simple and multiple logistic regression was used\nto evaluate the effects of the potential predictive variables on\nthe risk of obesity. Multiple regressions were adjusted for age,\nrace, gender, parental income and pre-existing obesity (obesity\nat Wave I). A significance level of 0.05 was used for all\nanalyses.\nRESULTS\nAdolescents, who completed both Waves I and II, were\nincluded in the sample. Thus, the final sample size was 13 568\nadolescents. Demographic variables are shown in Table 1. The\nmajority of participants were non-Hispanic White, with a\nsubstantial representation of non-Hispanic Black, Hispanics\nand Asian Americans.\nlittle change in sleep hours by Wave II (Table 2). In Wave I,\nweighted analysis of typical sleep duration showed that the\nmajority of adolescents slept an average of 8\u00ad11 h each night.\nAdolescents who slept <6 h represented 3.77% of the sample.\nBy Wave II, the percentage of adolescents who slept <6 h rose\nslightly to 5.06%, with a slight decrease in the 8\u00ad11 h sleepers\n10.6% of the sample being obese (BMI > 95th percentile;\nTable 2). The mean BMI in Wave II was\nincreased to 11.2% (Table 2). Of those adolescents who were\nII, whereas only 347 adolescents developed obesity between\nWaves I and II. Thus, obesity at Wave I was related to obesity\nLongitudinal relationship with obesity\nAs shown in Tables 2 and 3, there was a significant association\nbetween short sleep at Wave I and obesity in unadjusted\nanalyses. Adolescents who had <6 h of sleep in Wave I were\nalmost twice as likely to be obese in Wave II compared with\n2.90). However, once adjustments were made for existing\nobesity at Wave I, as well as age, gender, race and parental\nincome, there was no significant association between sleep\nduration at Wave I and obesity at Wave II (P = 0.214). This\nlack of association between sleep at Wave I and obesity at\nWave II was evident even when considering adolescents who\nseparately.\nThere was an association between sleep duration and\ndepression.

Consistent with Wave I models,\nadolescents watching >2 h of TV a day were approximately\nDISCUSSION\nThis study is the largest to date evaluating the effect of\nshortened sleep duration on obesity, in a sample of 13 568\nadolescents. The results do not support the hypothesis that\n<6 h sleep has an association with obesity, based on cross-\nsectional results in Wave II, and longitudinal results from\nWaves I and II. When adjusted for age, race, gender,\nsocioeconomic status, depression and BMI at Wave I, sleep\nduration was not a significant risk factor for the onset of\nobesity in Wave II. Instead, television watching for  2 h per\nday in Wave I was predictive of obesity in Wave II.\nConsidering a recent meta-analysis that demonstrated a\nconsistent increase in obesity among short sleepers in children\nand adults (Cappuccio et al., 2008), the results of this study\nraise more questions about the causal pathways that may lead\nto increased adiposity in adolescents.\nAlthough results were unexpected, these data are consistent\nwith previous studies of potential environmental risk factors\nsuch as television watching (inactivity or sedentary behaviour)\nthat may lead to obesity in adolescents (Eisenmann et al.,\nclearly impacted obesity in Wave II. The majority of adoles-\ncents that were obese in Wave I continued to be obese in Wave\nII. These results are similar to previous studies, indicating that\nprolonged television viewing was associated with obesity in\nchildren and adolescents (Dietz and Gortmaker, 1984).\nTelevision viewing may lead to increased risk of obesity\nbecause watching television has been associated with increased\ndietary intake, leading to an imbalance in energy expenditure\nan increasing amount of media exposure (Roberts et al., 2005),\ninactivity (Kaur et al., 2003) and poor food choices (Palumbo\nand Dietz, 1985). As stated earlier, these patterns of behav-\niours appear to be the driving forces behind weight gain in this\nage group. In this study, similar to other analyses of the full\nADD Health sample (Gordon-Larsen et al., 1999), television\nviewing for >2 h each day and acquired food preferences are\npotentially entrenched by adolescence. These factors had\ngreater association than sleep duration with obesity.\nTable 2 Summary of potential predictors (measured at Waves I and II) of obesity at Wave II*\nVariable characteristic\nWave I Wave II\nn Mean \u00b1 SE or % n Mean \u00b1 SE or %\nEaten fast food (days per week)\nSkipped breakfast (days per week)\nSedentary lifestyle (2 h per day of TV)\nTypical sleep duration (h)\nDepressed (CES-D  24)\nObese\n*Because of rounding, percentages may not all total 100.

Although we did not find a\nrelationship between television viewing and sleep in adjusted\nanalyses, there was a slight correlation between television\nviewing and shortened sleep (for Wave I: the correlation was\nAn additional problem is disentangling cause and effect.\nTelevision viewing may result in later sleep onset (Calamaro\net al., 2009). Thus, late night television watching may be a\npathway by which adolescents have shortened sleep duration.\nConversely, because of changing circadian rhythm with\ndelayed sleep phase (Carskadon et al., 1993), adolescents are\nup later, and utilize television or similar sedentary behaviours\nto fill the void (Eggermont and Bulck, 2006). Future longitu-\ndinal studies in adolescents are needed to determine at what\ntime of the night adolescents are viewing television, and\nwhether the timing directly influences sleep patterns and,\nultimately, obesity.\nAdditionally, longitudinal studies evaluating obesity, sleep\nduration and environmental factors, such as inactivity and food\nTable 3 Bivariate (unadjusted) comparison of obesity groups at Wave II by demographic and Wave I and II variables\nDemographic variables\nObese at Wave II\nUnadjusted odds ratio 95% CI\nGender\nRace\nWave I variables\n>2 h per day of TV\nTypical sleep duration (h)\nDepressed (CES-D  24)\nObese\nWave II variables\nEaten fast food (days per week)\nSkipped breakfast\n>2 h per day of TV\nTypical sleep duration (h)\nDepressed (CES-D  24)\nWeighted means or percentages are shown.\n(ref): reference group for odds ratio.\nSleep duration and obesity in adolescents 563\nintake, need to start in early childhood. The differing results\nbetween studies of adolescents and sleep and obesity may be\nbecause of study design differences. Study results from younger\nchildren under 11-years old appear uniform, despite differences\nin the definition of short sleep (Patel and Hu, 2008). Patel and\nHu (2008) in a recent systematic review of sleep duration and\nobesity reported 11 cross-sectional studies, all of which iden-\ntified a positive association between sleep duration and weight\ngain in predominantly school age children under 11-years old.\nOnly four studies, with varying results, have examined the\nrelationship of sleep in adolescents. Differences in definitions of\nshort sleep duration varied across studies, as did the potential\nconfounders addressed. Additionally, differences may be\nbecause of study methods, or may in part reflect a more\ncomplex relationship between sleep duration and weight in this\nage group because of onset of puberty (Patel and Hu, 2008).\nBecause depression is associated with sleep abnormalities\n(Kessler et al., 2003), such as complaints of hypersomnia or\ninfluence and bidirectional relationship of depression on sleep\nand weight gain was considered. In the ADD Health adoles-\ncent population, over 9% of adolescents were reported to have\nmoderate symptoms of depression (Rushton et al., 2002). It\nwas important, therefore, to determine the confounding\ninfluence, if any, of depression on sleep and weight gain.\nWhen included and excluded as a variable in the analysis, it\nwas clear that depression did play a factor in shortened sleep\nduration leading to weight gain in this population. Given that\nsleep duration as well as obesity are affected by depressive\nincluding depression as a potential cofounder adds strength to\nthe results of this study.\nData for the original study were collected on these adoles-\ncents in 1995. Since that time, there has been an explosion of\nmedia-related technology available for use at any time of the\nday or night. Adolescents engage others through computer\ngames, mobile phones to text friends, and surfing the internet\n(NSF, 2006). These technologies were not available at the time\nthese data were collected. Sleep is potentially impacted\nthrough late night use of these devices, and surveying\nadolescents regarding technology use in the 21st century may\nprovide different results (Calamaro et al., 2009).\nAnother limitation could be that a 1-year follow up may\npotentially not be a sufficient amount of time to explore a\npotential relationship between short sleep duration and BMI.\nIn our study, this may be particularly important given that\nthere were only a small number of new cases of obesity\nbetween Wave 1 and Wave 2. An additional limitation of this\nstudy was that validated sleep questionnaires were not\nincluded in the ADD Health survey, and sleep duration was\nself-reported. In addition, sleep duration was limited to a\nsingle question. A previous study has found that self-reported\nsleep duration estimates are similar to actigraphy (Wolfson\net al., 2003), however, it is possible that at the time of\ncompletion of the questionnaire, mood, stress and environ-\nment could have influenced self-reported sleep duration and\npotentially confounded its association with BMI. Another\nlimitation was that the study was observational and, thus, only\nassociations could be presented.\nUse of BMI as a measure of adiposity rather than a direct\nmeasurement of obesity, such as skin-fold thickness, could be\nconsidered another limitation, To date, BMI has been strongly\ncorrelated to measures of adiposity in children and adolescents\nTable 4 Multiple logistic regressions for risk of obesity at Wave II*\nWave I variables\nTypical sleep duration (h)\nWave II variables\nTypical sleep duration (h)\n*All models adjusted for obesity at Wave I, age, gender, race and parental income.\nAdjusted odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are shown.\nin children (Freedman et al., 2001), and diastolic blood\npressure measurements (Freedman et al., 2001). Because of\nthis, BMI is a well-validated marker of adiposity and increased\nrisk of morbidity in children and adolescents.\nCONCLUSION\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nprovides the largest data set to date describing sleep duration\nand association with obesity. With the results of this study, the\nquestion may be raised as to how sleep can have an association\nwith obesity in young children, not through adolescence, but\nagain in adults. It is possible that, as obese children enter\nadolescence; key environmental factors such as inactivity play\na much greater role than sleep duration. However, as these\nadolescents enter adulthood, sleep duration may play a bigger\nrole as inactivity and poor nutrition continue, and comorbid-\nities such as obstructive sleep apnoea, metabolic syndrome or\nhypertension develop, creating a vicious cycle (Fogelholm\net al., 2007). Further research, particularly longitudinal studies\nwith objective measurements of sleep, activity and nutrition, is\nneeded to determine the biological mechanism underlying the\nassociation between short sleep duration and weight gain.\nThere are no conflicts of interest for any of the authors,\nincluding specific financial interests or relationships and\naffiliations relevant to the subject matter or materials discussed\nin this manuscript.\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, J.
