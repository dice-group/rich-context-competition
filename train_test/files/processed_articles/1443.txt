One of our\npurposes was to explore whether changes in the distribution of\nother measured characteristics explained the observed decline.\nBecause age-adjusted estimates formed the basis of our ques-\ntions we used similarly age-adjusted estimates as our starting\npoint so as not to attribute any part of the observed decline to\nthe aging of the population. For both surveys, estimates were\nadjusted by the direct method to the 2000 US population using\nyears. Differences between surveys in demographic character-\nistics were tested for statistical significance using t-tests, with\nBonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.23\nWe modeled the association of hypertension with selected\nrisk factors and present model results as predicted prevalences\nand differences. Log-linear regression models were used to cal-\nculate predictive margins with data from the two surveys com-\nbined. Predictive margins provide predicted prevalences based\non the estimated model coefficients adjusted to the distribution\nof the covariates included in the model.8,24\u00ad27 The predicted\nvalues for each survey were adjusted to the \ncombined sample\ndistribution of covariates and adjustments were \nmodel-specific.\nThe predicted values for each survey-BMI category were cal-\nculated using the same approach. Previous papers on trends in\nhypertension that reported a decline used estimates standard-\npurpose was to consider possible explanations for this reported\ndecline we used similar 20-year age-adjusted estimates as the\nbase for comparisons.\nTo evaluate the effect of measurement error, we created sep-\narate models using hypertension status corrected for cuff size,\ncorrected for zero end-digit preference, and using hyperten-\nsion status corrected for both sources of measurement error;\nthese models included age defined using 20-year intervals as\nthe independent variable. We estimated predicted prevalences\nand differences after adjustment for measured risk factors\nwith and without measurement error corrections. In order\nto examine possible variation in the prevalence difference by\nBMI category, we produced estimates by BMI for hyperten-\nsion as observed and after measurement error correction and\nwith adjustment for age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and\neducation.\nResults\nThere were differences between the two populations in some\ndemographic characteristics associated with hypertension\n(P < 0.01 for both comparisons), the percent of non-Hispanic\nwhites decreased (P < 0.01), the percent of persons with more\nthan high-school education increased (P < 0.01), and the\noriginal contributions\n\npercent of never smokers increased (P < 0.01).
