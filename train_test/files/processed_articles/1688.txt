We determined the allele\nfrequencies and influence of these SNPs alone and in a weighted genetic risk score on FG,\nhomeostasis model assessment of -cell function (HOMA-B), and IFG by race/ethnicity, while\nadjusting for age and sex.\nRESULTS -- All allele frequencies varied significantly by race/ethnicity.

The prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes and the complications as-\nsociated with the disease vary signifi-\ncantly by race/ethnicity (6). Researchers\nconducting recent genetic association\nstudies have used homeostasis model as-\nsessment of -cell function (HOMA-B) to\nidentify several loci that influence levels\nof FG and -cell function (7\u00ad9). A meta-\nanalysis of genome-wide association data,\nby the Meta-Analysis of Glucose and In-\nsulin-Related Traits Consortium\n(MAGIC), recently confirmed 16 com-\nmon single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) associated with FG levels (10). In-\ndex SNPs were in or near PROX1, G6PC2,\ndiscovered in white people of European\nancestry; the influence of these SNPs on\nFG levels in nonwhite populations and\ntheir allele frequencies in general-\npopulation samples are unknown. The\nfrequencies of common disease-\nassociated alleles discovered by candidate\ngene or genome-wide association studies\n(GWASs) can differ significantly across\nracial/ethnic groups (http://hapmap.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov), and in some cases, the risk\nallele within a locus will differ on the basis\nof race/ethnicity (11,12). Other studies\nsuggest that despite the substantial varia-\ntions in allele frequencies, the genetic ef-\nfects on common diseases are largely\nconsistent across racial/ethnic groups\n(13). We addressed these concerns by\ngenotyping 16 confirmed FG-associated\nSNPs in adults who completed the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\n                                                \nFrom the 1Office of Public Health Genomics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia;\nthe 2General Medicine Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; the 3Depart-\nment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; the 4Center for\nHuman Genetic Research and Diadetes Research Center (Diabetes Unit), Massachusetts General Hospital,\nProgram in Medical and   Genetics, Broad Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Boston, Massachusetts; and the 5General Medicine Division, Massachusetts General Hospital and\nDepartment of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\nCorresponding author: Quanhe Yang, qay0@cdc.gov.\n*The MAGIC Investigators are listed in the online appendix, available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the\nofficial position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u00a9 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.

DNA lysates were created from cell\nlines generated using Epstein-Barr\u00ad\ntransformed lymphocytes from these\nblood specimens. We limited our analyses\nto nondiabetic participants who were\naged 20 years and had fasted between 8\nand 23 h before blood collection. Of\n3,517 eligible participants, we excluded\n162 participants who self-identified their\nrace/ethnicity as \"other\" and also ex-\ncluded 331 participants who either self-\nreported diabetes or had a FG level 7.0\nmmol/l or who had an oral glucose toler-\nance test (OGTT) 11.1mmol/l, which\nFG, HOMA-B, IFG, and diabetes\ndefinitions\nPlasma glucose levels were measured by\nhexokinase (COBAS MIRA; Roche Diag-\nnostics, Montclair, NJ).

We used SNP\ntyping was performed with the use of\niPLEX (Sequenom) (15). The minimum\ncall rate was 98.1%, and all SNPs were in\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) ac-\ncording to the National Center for Health\nStatistics criterion (if P  0.01 in two or\nmore race/ethnicity groups, HWE is\nrejected).\nGenetic risk score\nWe constructed a weighted genetic risk\nscore (GRS) to examine the combined ef-\nfect of 16 SNPs on FG levels, HOMA-B,\nand risk for IFG. We used the -coeffi-\ncients from the published European an-\ncestry GWASs of these FG-associated\nSNPs (10). We multiplied these -coeffi-\ncients by 0, 1, or 2, according to the num-\nber of risk alleles carried by each\nindividual, and then summed them. To\nfacilitate the comparison with the simple\nGRS (summing the number of risk al-\n(twice the sum of the -coefficients) and\nmultiplied by 32 (total number of alleles)\n(16). Although a number of SNPs did not\nshow significant association with FG or\nHOMA-B in the NHANES III, we as-\nsumed, on the basis of GWAS results, that\neach SNP is independently associated\nwith FG for computation of a weighted\nGRS. This assumption might not be ap-\npropriate if an index SNP is correlated\nwith the causal SNP in the discovery pop-\nulation but not so in other racial/ethnic\ngroups due to differences in linkage dis-\nequilibrium patterns (17). We used an ad-\nditive genetic model for each SNP and\napplied a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 to\ngenotypes containing 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles\n(16). We fit the weighted GRS as a con-\ntinuous variable and categorized it into\nquintiles in multivariate analyses. In pre-\nsenting the results, we rounded the\nweighted GRS to the whole number.\nStatistical analysis\nWe calculated weighted allele frequencies\nand their 95% CIs, stratified by race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American)\nusing the NHANES sample weights. We\ncarried out HWE tests for each genetic\nvariant for each racial/ethnic group. To\ntest for differences in allele frequencies,\nwe pooled all racial/ethnic groups and\nused 2 to test the differences across the\nracial/ethnic groups. We used linear re-\ngression modeling to evaluate the rela-\ntionship between 16 SNPs and FG levels\nand HOMA-B, adjusted for age and sex.\nWe examined the adjusted marginal effect\non FG by including one SNP at a time in\nthe model for each racial/ethnic group.\nSNPs were coded as 0, 1, or 2 for those\nwho were noncarriers, heterozygous, or\nhomozygous for the risk (FG raising) al-\nleles, respectively. We modeled the GRS\nin a similar fashion by testing associations\nof a per\u00adrisk allele increase with FG. For\nthe GRS models, we calculated adjusted\nR2, with and without the GRS to deter-\nmine the explained variance, by adding\nthe GRS in the models for each racial/\nethnic group. We tested for homogeneity\nof effects of these SNPs in marginal and\nGRS models across race/ethnicity by in-\ncluding the interaction terms of SNP or\nGRS with race/ethnicity in the regression\nmodels using the pooled dataset and re-\nported the associated P value.\nWe used age- and sex-adjusted logis-\ntic regression to evaluate the association\nof the GRS with prevalence of IFG for\neach racial/ethnic group. We modeled the\nGRS to test the association of a per\u00adrisk\nallele increase with odds of IFG. We also\ncategorized the GRS into quintiles to ex-\namine the trend of effect on risk of IFG.\nWe tested for homogeneity of the GRS\neffect on IFG across race/ethnicity by in-\ncluding the interaction term using the\npooled dataset. Statistical tests, using lin-\near or logistic regression modeling, were\nbased on Satterthwaite adjusted-F statis-\ntics. All tests were two sided, and a P value\nof 0.05 at each locus or the GRS was\nconsidered significant. To avoid nonre-\nsponse bias among NHANES III partici-\npants for whom DNA were available, the\nsample weights were recalculated for the\nNHANES III DNA dataset by using previ-\nously described methods (18).

However, despite sig-\nnificant variations in allele frequencies,\nthe patterns of influence of these SNPs on\nFG levels, HOMA-B, and IFG were gener-\nally consistent across racial/ethnic\ngroups. A GRS derived by the combina-\ntion of these 16 SNPs was weakly, yet sig-\nnificantly, associated with an increase in\nFG levels, a decrease in HOMA-B, and an\nincrease in risk for IFG in all racial/ethnic\ngroups. Our findings suggest that the ge-\nnetic variants at these glycemic loci, dis-\ncovered in the white population of\nEuropean ancestry, also contribute to the\nelevated FG and reduced HOMA-B\namong non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans.\nThe 16 FG-associated SNPs are lo-\ncated in or near genes involved in multi-\nple biological pathways (10). Some of\nthese SNPs were also associated with type\nreplicated in non-European populations\n(22,23). Our study includes the most up-\ndated SNPs associated with FG and esti-\nmates their frequencies and effects in a\nnationally representative sample of the\nU.S. population. Our results suggest that\nwith an adequate sample size (not neces-\nsarily as large as for a GWAS), these FG-\nassociated SNPs would likely be\nreplicated among non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican Americans.\nAlthough FG levels seem tightly reg-\nulated within a narrow range by a feed-\nback mechanism that targets a particular\nFG set point for each person (24), FG lev-\nels vary substantially among nondiabetic\nthe variation may be explained by genetic\nfactors (7). Many studies have suggested\nthat elevated FG levels are associated with\nmultiple health conditions, including risk\nfor type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis-\neases (1,2,4,5). These diseases represent a\nmajor burden of disease in many popula-\ntions (25). Identification of populations at\nhigh risk of developing type 2 diabetes\nhas great public health importance. Our\nfindings suggest that a GRS, on the basis\nof these FG-associated SNPs, is signifi-\ncantly associated with IFG, but it is un-\nclear if these SNPs can improve\npredictions for risks of type 2 diabetes or\ncardiovascular disease in the general pop-\nulation. Further studies are also needed to\nexamine the possible associations of these\nSNPs with type 2 diabetes and cardiovas-\ncular diseases in different races and\nethnicities.\nHowever, the combined effects of\nTable 4--Adjusted prevalence and odds ratio for IFG by quintiles of weighted genetic risk score and race/ethnicity, Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey DNA Bank\nCharacteristics\nGRS as\ncontinuous\nvariable P value*\nQuintiles of the weighted genetic risk score\nNon-Hispanic white\nNon-Hispanic black\nMexican American\nData and 95% CI are in parentheses. *For prevalence of IFG, P values for trend test across quintiles of weighted genetic risk score; for adjusted odds ratio, P values for using weighted genetic risk score as a continuous\nvariable in logistic regression models are based on Satterthwaite adjusted F test. P  0.365 for testing heterogeneity of weighted genetic risk score as a continuous variable on risk for IFG across racial/ethnic groups\nis based on Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic.\nGenetic variants and fasting glucose levels\nthese SNPs explain only a small percent-\nage of the total variations in FG levels and\nHOMA-B (3%), suggesting that addi-\ntional loci exist. These loci may be com-\nmon genetic variants with small effects,\nrare variants with larger effects, or vari-\nants that strongly interact with each other\nor with environmental factors (in which\nthe number and effect size remain un-\nknown). These interactions are undoubt-\nedly important but complicated to model;\ntheir exploration is beyond the scope of\nour study.\nThe major strengths of our study in-\nclude the availability of FG and HOMA-B\nmeasurements from a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of the U.S. population\nwith multiple racial/ethnic groups and the\ngenotyping of the 16 most updated FG-\nassociated SNPs. There are several limita-\ntions of our study. First, these FG-\nassociated SNPs were discovered among\npopulations of European ancestry and\nmay be proxies for the causal variants. It is\nwell known that linkage disequilibrium\npatterns vary significantly by race/\nethnicity (17), and it is unclear if linkage\ndisequilibrium might break down for\nsome of these SNPs in other racial/ethnic\ngroups (online appendix Fig. 3). Addi-\ntional fine mapping in all three race/\nethnic groups is needed. Second, we\nreplicated a limited number of SNPs--\neven among non-Hispanic whites--that\nwere significantly associated with FG lev-\nels or HOMA-B in the NHANES III. As\nindicated in the power calculation (online\nappendix), we had limited sample size to\ndetect an effect size of 0.07 mmol/l in\nFG per allele for each individual SNP. The\nmost likely explanation for the lack of sig-\nnificant association was the limited sam-\nple size of fasting individuals from the\nNHANES III. Since these were GWAS-\nconfirmed, FG-associated SNPs (at least\namong non-Hispanic whites), we in-\ncluded all SNPs in our analysis. However,\nusing the GRS as a continuous variable,\nwe have adequate power to detect an ef-\nfect size as low as 0.016 mmol/l per risk\nallele. When including only the 11 SNPs\nthat showed the expected direction of ef-\nfects for FG and HOMA-B, the association\nof the GRS appeared to be stronger,\nthough the patterns remained unchanged\n(results not shown). At least for non-\nHispanic whites, a larger sample size\nwould not likely change the conclusions\nsince the majority of the SNPs' effects are\nin the expected direction, consistent with\nstudies in European populations (10).\nThird, we calculated the weighted GRS\nfor the three racial/ethnic groups on the\nbasis of the published -coefficients from\npopulations of European ancestry be-\ncause of a lack of estimates for other\nracial/ethnic groups (10). These -coeffi-\ncients might not be appropriate for other\npopulations. However, the consistent ef-\nfects of the GRS on FG, HOMA-B, and\nIFG across racial/ethnic groups suggest\nthat the weighting was not totally inap-\npropriate in these populations. In addi-\ntion, the pattern of association between\nweighted and unweighted GRS on FG,\nHOMA-B, and IFG were consistent (on-\nline appendix Tables 4 and 5).\nIn summary, our results suggest that\nthe allele frequencies of FG-associated\nSNPs varied significantly by race/\nethnicity. However, the patterns of\ncombined effects of these SNPs on FG\nlevels and HOMA-B were consistent\nacross the different racial/ethnic\ngroups. A GRS that was based on 16\nSNPs was significantly associated with\nrisk of IFG among all racial/ethnic\ngroups, which may make it useful for\nthe identification of people who are at\nhigh risk for developing diabetes.\n"
