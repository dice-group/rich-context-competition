Drawing on Lefebvre, and subsequent research, we employ rhythmanalysis in conjunction\nwith Miyazaki's notion of `algorhythm' and nascent work on algorithmic governance, to develop a concept of `algor-\nhythmic governance'. We then use this framing to make sense of two empirical case studies: a traffic management system\nand sound monitoring and modelling. Our analysis reveals: (1) how smart city technologies computationally perform\nrhythmanalysis and undertake rhythm-making that intervenes in space-time processes; (2) distinct forms of algorhythmic\ngovernance, varying on the basis of adaptiveness, immediacy of action, and whether humans are in-, on-, or, off-the-loop;\n(3) and a number of factors that shape how algorhythmic governance works in practice.\n",

In recent years, such dynamic regu-\nlation and mediation has been widened and deepened\nwith the rollout of ubiquitous and pervasive computing\nwherein computation is built into the fabric of urban\ninfrastructure and is accessible from any location and\non the move.

First, traffic management and the on-going\nwork within a traffic control centre to gather real-time\ndata on traffic conditions and the rhythms of traffic\nflow in order to dynamically manage a complex\nnetwork in flux and to keep traffic moving. Here, our\nanalysis utilizes ethnographic fieldwork in which one of\nthe authors spent time in a traffic control room obser-\nving the work of the intelligent transport system and its\ncontrollers and managers, and on a set of related\ninterviews. Second, real-time sound monitoring utiliz-\ning a network of sensors, wherein the data are fed back\nto city managers and analyzed, and shared with the\npublic through a city dashboard. Here, our analysis\ndraws on a set of interviews with system developers\nand those that analyze, utilize and share the data.\nIn both cases, the interviews are drawn from a larger\nset of 77 conducted with city workers and stakeholders\ninvolved in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland.\nThese two case studies illustrate two different types of\nalgorhythmic governance: the first more interventionist,\nadaptive and direct, wherein the on-going management\nof a city system is over-determined by code; the second\nmore contextual or performance management orien-\ntated, wherein the rhythms are measured, monitored,\nrecorded and modelled, with interventions more peri-\nodic and indirect.\nRhythmanalysis and the (smart) city\ninstalment in Henri Lefebvre's multi-volume work,\n`Critique of Everyday Life' which was published\nmously, and was a key contribution, along with\n`attempt to get us both to think space and time\ndifferently, and to think them together' (Elden, 2004:\nargument is that `[e]verywhere where there is inter-\naction between a place, a time and an expenditure of\nenergy, there is rhythm', meaning that everyday life\nunfolds within `patterns of flow that possess particular\nrhythmic qualities' which produce a sense of continuity\nand stability, or disjuncture (Edensor, 2010a: 3).\nPeoples' lives therefore take place within a set of oscil-\nlating space-times, some of which are encountered regu-\nlarly, some more periodically; or to put it another way:\nLefebvre identifies two main types of rhythms, linear\nnotes, people are often encountering and co-producing\nseveral of rhythms simultaneously such that cities host\na series of `intersecting rhythms, including the poly-\nrhythmic [multiple], eurhythmic [harmonious and\nstable], isorhythmic [equal and in sync] and even\narrhythmic [out of sync and disruptive] measures as\nwell as secret, public, internal and external beats that\n73). In other words, cities consist of a `multiplicity of\ntemporalities, some long run, some short term, some\nfrequent, some rare, some collective, some personal,\nsome large-scale, some hardly noticed' (Crang, 2001:\n190). These rhythms `may clash or harmonize, producing\nreliable moments of regularity or less consistent vari-\nof in this way, places \u00ad the conjoining of space and\ntime \u00ad unfold as events, wherein multiple constellations\nof trajectories, processes and temporalities `collide, syn-\nA key aspect of how rhythms unfold, are maintained\nand are discernible from noise, and also mutate, is repe-\ntition. Basic elements of a rhythm are repeated to create\nan order, a refrain. In Deleuze and Guattari's term\nmatters of expression that draws a territory and devel-\nops into territorial motifs and landscapes'. Refrain is\nrhythm that becomes expressive, and it is this refrain,\nindividually and collectively reproduced, that produces\nordered space-time (Spinney, 2010). As Brown and\n2001) explain, `[a] refrain. . . is a rhythmic series. . .\nthat creates, by its very repetition, a sense of the famil-\niar, a sense of place.' They elaborate that:\n[a]s the territory becomes secured, so the refrain is\n`picked up' or reiterated by others who come to\noccupy the same space, much like the bird songs or,\nthey argue, cultural myths. Each time the refrain is\npicked up, it is articulated anew, yet it still remains\nrecognisably the same repetitive series. (pp. 36\u00ad37)\nRefrains enact what Deleuze and Guattari call\nthe return of the identical (`the reproductive meter'),\nbut the creation of difference. Here, `[t]ime is not an a\npriori form; rather, the refrain is the a priori form of\ntime, which in each case fabricates different times'\n(p. 348). As Lefebvre notes, `there is no identical abso-\nlute repetition, indefinitely. As such, while a system\nmight work to try and maintain a refrain, to maintain\na eurhythmic state, it is always unfolding in a slightly\nimperfect form, or it might be `punctured, disrupted or\ncurtailed by moments and periods of arrhythmia' and\nRhythms then are not already given, but emerge as\nbeats in the superposition of multiple and heteroge-\nneous temporal flows and routines; these beats, in\nturn, perform differences and require new attunements\nto bring them into order.\nAs Elden (2004) details, Lefebvre uses rhythm not\njust as an object of study, but also as a mode of ana-\nlysis. Rhythmanalysis thus seeks to unpack the ways in\nwhich time, space and lived experience are folded into,\nconditioned by, and produced through various rhythms\n2001). Lefebvre is fairly vague on what rhythmanalysis\nlooks like in practice, and those that have sought\nto deploy his ideas empirically have used a range of\ndifferent methods (see Edensor, 2010b for examples).\nAs noted, our approach has been to use a combination\nethnography and interviews that have sought to under-\nstand how city managers and the software-enabled sys-\ntems they use measure and manage the polyrhythmic\nmeasure contending that while `rhythm seems natural,\nspontaneous, with no law other than its unfurling.. . .\nRhythm, always particular, (music, poetry, dance,\ngymnastics, work, etc.) always implies a measure.\nEverywhere where there is rhythm, there is measure,\nwhich is to say law, calculated and expected obligation,\na project.'\nThe relationship between calculation and manage-\nment in producing urban rhythms is the empirical\nfocus of this article, with particular attention paid\nto how new smart city technologies are being used\nto mediate and regulate the multiple rhythms of cities;\nto conduct a rhythmanalysis of the measure, work and\neffects of Internet of Things infrastructures that seek to\nlimit arrhythmia and produce eurhythmic systems than\nmaintain refrain. As noted by a number of commenta-\ntors, the monitoring, planning and coordination of\nurban systems and services are increasingly being\nmediated by software-enabled technologies processing\nreal-time data (Kitchin and Dodge, 2011; Luque-Ayala\nis delegated to digital infrastructures (DeNardis and\nMusiani, 2016) and enacted through forms of `auto-\nmated management' (Dodge and Kitchin, 2007),\nwherein human and social action are increasingly\nmediated by black-boxed algorithms that are inaccess-\nible to public scrutiny (Gillespie, 2014; Janssen and\nware is re-framing time and temporality (Hassan and\nPurser, 2007), and the space-times of cities are undergo-\ning significant change.\nAlthough Lefebvre in his later years showed strong\ninterest in ICTs and their role in the capitalist mode of\nproduction (Lefebvre, 1996), it is only in the last few\nyears that rhythmanalysis has been deployed for study-\ning the work of algorithms, for example in environmen-\nand financial processes (Borch et al., 2015). However,\nas noted by Borch et al. (2015) in their account of high\nfrequency trading in financial markets, `the bodily focus\nof Lefebvre's project makes it unsuitable for fully\nColetta and Kitchin 3\ngrasping the development toward algorithmic trading'\n(p. 1084), and by extension sensing infrastructures.\nThis is because, they explain, high-frequency trading\nalgorithms are `designed to detect and respond to\nmarket rhythms' and the `rhythmic interactions\namong algorithms take place in ways that are not\nbodily founded or related' (p. 1084: original emphasis).\nThis is not to say that the rhythm of human bodies\nis not attuned to trading markets, but algorithms are\nlargely working in ways independent of body rhythms.\nA further shortcoming in Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis \u00ad\nof `a sustained analysis of the production of time,\nalthough his analysis. . . certainly yield significant\ninsights on presence and absence, multiple temporal-\nities and the interplay of time and space'. If measure\nand calculations are consitituve aspects of rhythms and\nthere is `no rhythm without repetition in time and in\nspace', and if repetition entails difference (Lefebvre\nus a need to rethink measures, linearity and cycles as\neffects of rhythm-making processes. Accordingly, the\nmultiple and entangled character of rhythms requires\nthe interaction between human bodies and everyday\nlife on the one hand and code and organizational pro-\ncesses on the other to be accommodated, to which we\nnow turn.\nAlgorithms, governance and rhythms\nFundamentally, software is composed of algorithms \u00ad\n`sets of defined steps structured to process instructions/\nGillespie (2014) thus notes that all digital technologies\nare `algorithm machines', able to tackle a diverse set\nof tasks automatically, quickly, efficiently, effectively,\nand inscrutably. Given these qualities, many aspects\nof everyday life are increasingly being mediated, aug-\nmented, produced and regulated by digital devices and\nnetworked systems. As noted, this includes a diverse set\nof city systems and infrastructure, where algorithms are\ndeployed to `search, collate, sort, categorise, group,\nmatch, analyse, profile, model, simulate, visualise and\nregulate people, processes and places' (Kitchin, 2017:\n18). In turn, this has enabled new forms of algorithmic\ngovernance to be enacted, whereby `algorithm machines'\nare used to actively measure, monitor, manage and con-\ntrol populations and the space-times of cities.\nIn recent years there has been an increased focus on\nthe nature, working and effects of algorithmic govern-\nance across a range of domains (e.g., finance, health,\neducation, work). This has included research that has\nexamined and theorised how various forms of algorith-\nmic governance is reshaping the management, control\nand governmentality of space and mobility. For exam-\nple, Graham (2005) detailed processes of algorithmic\nspatial sorting in which people are classified with\nrespect to place and differentially treated, and in later\nwork (2011) set out how cities were increasingly under\nsiege through various forms of automated surveillance\nand regulation (e.g., CCTV, transactions, satellites,\nof algorithmic regulation in border security, and in\nthe calculation and management of socio-spatial risks.\nKitchin and Dodge (2011) documented the various\nways in which people, objects, territories and transac-\ntions are algorithmically tracked and acted upon, and\ndetailed forms of automated management in which\n`algorithm machines' are ceded the power to act in\nautomatic, autonomous and automated ways. More\nrecently, Klauser et al. (2014) have examined the chan-\nging nature of governmentality enacted through the use\nof smart metering and smart grids and Luque-Ayala\nand Marvin (2016) have documented how new centra-\nlized urban control rooms enact new forms of real-time\ngovernmentality; Leszczynski (2015) has explored anxi-\neties of surveillance and control in an age of spatial Big\nData practices and dataveillance; Kitchin et al. (2015)\nhave detailed how new streams of urban Big Data and\ncity dashboards are enabling forms of new managerial-\nism, performance management and technocratic modes\nof governance; and Kitchin (2016) has examined the\nethics of governing through smart city technologies\nand issues of profiling, discrimination, bias, due pro-\ncess, accountability.\nIn general, these studies have little considered the\nways in which algorithms are temporal in nature,\nand at best only implicitly note the temporal as well\nas spatial work of algorithmic governance and how\nthey mediate the rhythms of urban life. Here, we\nwant to consider the temporal dimensions of algorithms\nand their work, reframing them as algorhythms that\nproduce modes of algorhythmic governance; that is,\nstructured forms of knowledge designed to create\neuryhtmia \u00ad a familiar, desired refrain.\ncept of an `algorhythm', blending together the notion of\nan algorithm's sequence of step-by-step instructions\nwith rhythm's time-based order of movement to con-\nsider how computation `manifests itself as an epistemic\nmodel of a machine that makes time itself logically con-\ntrollable and, while operating, produces measurable\n520) contends `[a]lgorhythms are vibrational, pulsed\nand rhythmized signals constituted both by trans-\nductions of physical fluctuations of energy and their\noscillations as well as by abstract and logical structures\nof mathematic calculations.' He shows how the micro-\ntemporal `agencement' of such algorhythms \u00ad namely\nthe technical and social linkages creating the\ncondition for actions (Hardie and MacKenzie, 2007) \u00ad\nproduce and mediate everyday life, but can also gener-\nate major failures in networks and services, such as in\nthe cases of the AT&T telephone network crash in 1990\nor the Flash Crash of the New York Stock Exchange in\nargues that algorithms have a temporal flow consisting\nof `a continuous string or stream of interpenetrating \u00ad\nprior and subsequent \u00ad actions that compare, swap,\nsort, allocate, administer, and so forth' where `[e]very\nparticular ``doing'' happening in the present already\nassumes some inheritance from antecedent ``prior-to''\nactions, and it already anticipates, or imparts to, the\nsubsequent ``in-order-to'' actions'.\nWhile Introna (2016) emphasizes the polyrhythmic\nconcatenation of multiple computational systems,\nwherein a number of algorhythms and temporal flows\nintersect and interact, we are more interested in how\nsequences and concatenations are repeated. Likewise,\nwhile Miyazaki is concerned with conducting media\narchaeologies of algorhythms and computing infra-\nstructures, we focus on how the rhythms of urban\nsystems and the space-time unfolding of place are\nalgorhythmically mediated; how forms of algorhythmic\ngovernance are being produced that explicitly measure\nand modulate urban rhythms \u00ad in our case the flow of\ntraffic and the fluctuations of noise. The challenge\n`the time-boundedness of computational culture' to\nthe time-boundedness of governance cultures in order\nto account for the interplay, interference and synchron-\nization of the multiple refrains of smart urbanism. As\nis to find ways of articulating the uneven, mixed timings\nthat emerge within real networks of inter-operating sys-\ntems,' acknowledging that algorithms are an essential\npart of a larger framework, entangled and displaced in\na wide network of epistemic practices, organizations\nand infrastructures (Dourish, 2016). Our approach is\nthus to deploy a form of rhythmanalysis at the level\nof an assemblage of related governmental technologies\n\u00ad the control room, a sound network \u00ad rather than\nindividual algorhythms; to examine how inter-related\nsets of digital technologies work together or in conflict,\nperform synchronization and interact through diverse\ncalculations and repetitions. Thus conceived,\nalgorhythmic governance can be considered as one of\nthe multifarious forms of urban governmentality enacted\nby algorithms. As we detail elsewhere, urban informatics\nare shifting governmentality from disciplinary forms to\nthose of social control; rather than governmentality\nmolding subjects and restricting action within spatial\nenclosures, it seeks to modulate affects and channel\naction across space (Kitchin et al., 2018).\nAlgorhythmic governance in practice\nTraffic management\nThe Dublin Traffic Management and Incident Centre\n(TMIC) provides a single, integrated, 24/7 control\nroom to house the core traffic management systems\nfor monitoring and controlling the road transportation\nnetwork and traffic flow in the Greater Dublin Area,\nincluding dealing with major events and incidents.\nThe TMIC is located on the top floor of the Wood\nQuay Building and access is restricted to selected per-\nsonnel. The control room has nine main desks for oper-\nators, each provided with a computer, telephone,\nCCTV control and three displays (see Figure 1), that\nall face a large wall display with screens arranged in\nmultiple sections that show live traffic conditions and\nallow controllers to share one of their screens with the\nroom. One of the desks is reserved for the control\nroom supervisor, one for a AA Roadwatch operator\n(who communicates traffic news to radio stations\nthroughout the day), and three of the desks are reserved\nfor the Gardai\u00b4 (police service), Dublin Bus and ITS\n(Intelligent Transportation System) staff. Three smaller\ndesks are located in the back left corner of the room\nand hosts Dublin City FM's live broadcast of traffic\nMonday to Friday (staffed by a presenter, assistant\nand producer; http://www.dublincityfm.ie/). In add-\nition to the main control room there is a smaller situ-\nation room with further screen and equipment to\nmanage special events, and a small kitchen.\nThe TMIC is a busy, time-critical environment,\nwith its own overlapping and intertwining everyday,\nwork, machinic and algorithmic polyrhythms operating\non different temporal cycles: the peaks of morning and\nevening rush-hour; people entering or leaving the room\nat breaks or as shifts change; the voice and music on the\nradio; the operators typing at keyboards and switching\nbetween cameras; and hurried conversations or jokes\nand the sharing of screens as a situation unfolds. At\nall times, real-time information is flowing into the\ncentre from a fixed network of 380 CCTV cameras,\nColetta and Kitchin 5\n800 sensors (induction loops), a small number of Traffic\nCams (traffic sensing cameras) used when induction\nloops are faulty or the road surface is not suitable\nfor them, a mobile network of approximately 1,000\nbus transponders (controllers can also directly contact\ndrivers if needed; see Figure 2), phone calls and mes-\nsages by the public to radio stations and the operators,\nand social media posts, which contingently and rela-\ntionally shaping the core patterns of activity. At the\ncentre of this activity is the adaptive traffic management\nFigure 1. The view at a traffic controller's desk.\nFigure 2. Real-time visualization of Dublin public transportation vehicles; yellow dots: Luas trams, blue dots: buses (source: Travic).\nsystem, Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System\nSCATS is an automated and adaptive system for\nmanaging the flow of traffic through a city. It synchron-\nises traffic lights automatically, calculating the timing\nof signal cycles and phases at junctions depending\non traffic conditions in order to ensure the optimal\nflow of vehicles and minimize congestion and man-\nage incidents. In so doing, it dynamically manage the\npolyrhythms of road transportation and pedestrian\ncrossings. A cycle is the wait time at a junction and is\nsubdivided into phases for different directions and types\n(e.g., vehicles, cycles, pedestrians) of flow. It is adaptive\nin the sense that the system automatically adjusts the\ncycles and phases dependent on a set of programmed\nrules and the volume of traffic in previous cycles and\n`SCATS has a hierarchical structure, featuring two dis-\ntinct levels or layers of control: strategic and tactical.\nAt the tactical level, control is undertaken by the local\ncontroller, allowing green phases to be terminated early\nand omitting phases for which there is no demand.\nDecisions are made based on information from vehicle\ndetectors at the junction. At the strategic level, the\nregional computers use flow and occupancy data col-\nlected from vehicle detectors to give coordination\nbetween groups of junctions. Optimum cycle length,\nphase splits, and offsets are determined on an area\nbasis, and not just for one junction.'\nIn effect, SCATS operates at three levels of control\n(McCann, 2014): at the level of the single intersection,\na subsystem and a system. A subsystem is an amalgam\nof closely related junctions, including a `critical' junc-\ntion and adjacent minor junctions and pedestrian cross-\nings. `Within a subsystem, all junctions operate at the\nsame cycle time and will have offset values designed to\nprovide synchronisation between the junctions at all\nseeks to provide coordination between subsystems by\nlinking them together using external offsets.\nAcross the subsystems and system, the adjustment\nof time is based on the degree of saturation (DS), a\ntraffic demand measure, and managed strategically at\na regional computer. The DS algorithm measures\nhow effectively the road is used and what should be\nthe maximum flow allowed based on the number\nof vehicles flowing through a junction in a given time\nperiod. The DS indicates if the road usage is under\nor over-saturated, which is then used by SCATS to\nself-calibrate.1\nAs explained by the centre manager:\nThe SCAT system is set up with the various different\nphases, the various different approaches it can run so it\ncan run the main road, side road, pedestrian, right\nturns, whatever, so that is all set up by the staff here.\nThat is programmed into the traffic controller. When\nthe traffic controller gets switched on then there is an\ninitial set of times, but once it gets that initial set of\ntimings, SCATS itself will start to calibrate to the traffic\nflow. So it self-calibrates to the traffic flow. And then\nwhat it is looking to do is it is looking to equalize, to\nbalance the competing demands at junctions. So that is\nthe first thing it is trying to do. The second thing is,\ndepending on where those junctions are, we may then\ndecide they should be linked to each other to provide\nprogressional flow from one to the other. So it has got\nto maintain coordination with its neighbors. [. . .]\nDuring the heavy, busy hours, you might have a lot\nof junctions along the road all linked to each other\nfor cordination purposes, but as the traffic need dies\ndown they could revert back to smaller and smaller\nclusters of traffic controllers who just respond more\nto their local needs, so they perform better just at\ntheir local needs. (Senior executive officer #1, Local\nAuthority, our emphasis)\nCalculations, calibrating processes and practices are at\nthe core of the production of linear and cyclic rhythms:\ntime is not given, but is built through the interaction of\nmultiple adjustments which shape the measurement and\npractices of rhythms. Indeed, calibration as defined by\nthe Oxford English Dictionary2 refers both to an act of\nmeasurement (`to determine the correct value') and to\nan act of modification and adaptation (`to graduate\nobjects for any irregularities'). Thus, the calibration\ntakes into account the interactions within the TMIC\nas performed by the controllers as well as the flows of\ntraffic and pedestrians, who through their movements\nand actions at a junction contribute to and are affected\nby the system's algorhythms. For example, by pressing\na pedestrian crossing button at junction, people pro-\nduce a temporary break in the traffic rhythm closing\ndown the main phase in order to run the pedestrian\nphase. Similarly, the number of cars and the gaps\nbetween them detected by the induction loops commu-\nnicates if a phase was too short or long and the next\nphase time is re-calculated automatically by the SCAT\nsystem. Public buses benefit from prioritisation, so as\nthey approach a junction the phasing will alter to\naccommodate their passage, generating a further alter-\nation of traffic rhythms that need to be managed by the\nColetta and Kitchin 7\nsoftware, and which sometimes produces congestion in\nthe other phases. Cycles are set to last a minimum of\n40 seconds to a maximum 130 seconds, but in practice\nthey rarely exceed 80 seconds or go below 60 seconds.\nThis is based on the pragmatic evaluation that the wait-\ning time for a pedestrian crossing above 80 seconds\nwould be too long:\n`So then that means that throughout the day when it is\nnot busy the cycle goes between 60 and 80 seconds\nwhich just means that if a person is waiting at the\nside of the road they are not waiting too long, or the\npeople at the side roads are not waiting too long.\nBecause if you have everything at 120 and all the add-\nitional [time] goes to the main road you could be sitting\non the side road for maybe 80 seconds which is a very\nlong time.' (Senior execuive officer #2, Local Authority)\nCalibration is strictly related to repetition: the repeated\npassage of cars at specific intervals of time produce a\ntemporal pattern that SCATS uses to adjust the phases.\nThe association of calibration and repetition through\ncalculation produce the refrain of traffic management.\nRefrains enable data actionability and accountability,\nand are used by ITS staff to configure the setting of\nSCATS taking into account whether it is a weekday\nor weekend, as well as seasonal/daily rhythms and\nwhen schools are closed. Consequently, each phase of\neach junction has its own temporal rhythms which can\nbe discerned over time. Figure 3 displays an average\n(over 4 months) flow of traffic through one junction\nphase over 24 hours for each day of the week, showing\na morning and late afternoon/evening peaks for week-\ndays, but early afternoon peaks at the weekend.\nOn the management side, operators can intervene\nand override the original SCATS settings, as well as\nits present conditions. Figure 4 shows the SCATs inter-\nface as interacted with by a controller, with the right-\nhand part of the screen showing a junction and its\nphases, and the left hand part the length of time for\neach phase. Interventions are circumscribed by the con-\nfiguration of the system by ITS staff, which in turn refer\nto the Traffic Signs Manual by the National Roads\nAuthority,3 which gives rules on the minimum and\nmaximum times for phases. If, for example, operators\ntry to go below the minimum safety times for green or\nred time on a different phase SCATS will automatically\noverride the modification attempt with the original\nconfiguration:\nWe have a number of rules and a number of different\nelements that you do, so you draw a diagram of what\nyour phasing is going to be, you then define what signal\ngroups can run at the same time as the other, you give\nbasic timings, you give minimal times for your pedes-\ntrian crossings, you calculate what the critical collision\npoint is, so what phases. How long the inter-green time\nhas been the different phases and any other require-\nments that you want to have, i.e. if you want phases\nto be allowed to be controlled by different factors, so if\nyou turn on switches or turn on different things, differ-\nent things happen.

The directive was enshrined in Irish\nlaw as the Environmental Noise Regulations (Statutory\nFigure 4.

Real-time passenger information sign at a bus stop.\nCity Council (DCC) (as well as the other three Dublin\nlocal authorities) is obliged to measure, model and\npublish noise levels across its jurisdiction. DCC sub-\ncontracts this service to a private, Dublin-based start-\nup company, Sonitus Systems, who deploy an Internet\nof Things solution using networked sound sensors\nlocated in 14 locations (40 across the city as a whole).\nThe sound levels recorded by the monitoring stations\nare displayed via an interactive map8 and specific\nsite graphs,9 enabling the public to read daily and\nlonger-term sound levels for each station, and compare\ndifferent locations (see Figure 7). As one our inter-\nviewees explained:\n`[O]ur system is constantly measuring noise levels, 24/7,\nit makes an average every five minutes, or every five\nminutes it logs a reading, and then it uploads that auto-\nmatically to our server. And we take all that data\ncoming in, a reading every five minutes from 40 sites\nall over the city, and we turn that into useful informa-\ntion about what is happening in areas around the city\nby processing it, by averaging it, by comparing it with\nother sites and by providing a set of tools online to let\neither our customer or the general public analyze what\nis happening one day to the next, over time, and look at\nit in longer-term trends over time. (Start-up entrepre-\nThe consequence is that the city now has `millions and\nmillions of measurements, six metrics taken every five\nminutes for the last five years at a dozen different points\naround the city' (company manager), which are made\navailable for scrutiny through a web-based software\nplatform and forms part of the database for noise\nmodelling (see Figure 8). To produce noise maps at a\nfiner resolution than the sound monitors enable, the\ndata are complemented by `road surface and gradient,\nnumber of vehicles and speed of the traffic, positions of\nbuildings and barriers and the topology of the local\narea' and are modelled using predictive software to pro-\nduce day-time and night-time maps.10\nHere, quite literally we have a set of algorhythms at\nwork, algorithmically measuring, processing and ana-\nlyzing urban sound and its rhythms. As with the traffic\nmanagement system, the rhythms detected are affected\nby calibration, initial settings and the equipment used.\nAs one of our interviewees describes with respect to an\nair quality sensor network:\nInterviewee: It takes time to understand whether sen-\nsors work or not. You need to choose the interval in\nwhich you retrieve the data. Because if you retrieve\nthem at the second scale, you have plenty of informa-\ntion, but there also can be much noise. If you retrieve\nthem at the hour scale it is more normal but you can\nFigure 7. Sound levels at Drumcondra Library, Dublin.\nColetta and Kitchin 11\nlose information, so you need to find a compromise, the\nright balance.\nInterviewer: Also in relation with the times of the city:\nmorning, peak hours, evening. . .\nInterviewee: Exactly. Then the higher the resolution,\nthe higher the consumption of battery; the more you\nkeep data in the flashcard, the more you have to trans-\nmit them. There is a whole series of compromises you\nneed to deal with. (Environmental engineer, University)\nThe calculation of the measurement interval thus\nrequires a compromise between the resolution of infor-\nmation and noise, and to take into account battery cap-\nacity and maintenance. The resolution is also often\nshaped by the type of communications network\ndeployed to relay data. Sending data via GSM can be\nexpensive over time, encouraging lower resolution trans-\nfers. In Dublin, a Low-Power Wide-Area Network\n(LPWAN) is being tested which allows long range com-\nmunication at a low bit rate and is specifically designed\nfor battery-powered Internet of Thing devices and to\nsupport low cost sensors. In other words, the rhythm\nand resolution of the data measurement and transfer \u00ad\nevery five seconds, every minute, every hour, every day \u00ad\nis technically mediated. Again, calibration is coupled\nwith repetition and produces the refrain that enables\nthe accountability and actionability of data.\nDiscussion and conclusions:\nAlgorhythmic governance, refrains and\nrhythm-making\nThe concept of algorhythmic governance expresses the\nexistence of scalable dynamics generated by the inter-\nplay of calibration and repetition that create refrains\nthat make computation, management and policies\naccountable and actionable. Rhythm-making takes\nplace in different organizations and they are ongoing,\nopen, dispersed, loosely connected, performative, pre-\nscriptive and manipulable. In rhythmanalytical terms,\nthe SCATS software and the operators in the TMIC,\nand the Sonitus sound monitoring network and sound\nmodellers, are undertaking rhythmanalysis \u00ad that is,\nthey are seeking to measure and reveal the polyrhythms\nof the city. But they are also rhythm-makers, in that\nthey actively seek to mediate and calibrate repetitions\nand rhythms in the world \u00ad to try and minimize differ-\nence and arrhythmia (disruptive, out-of-sync disjunc-\ntions) and produce eurhythmia (harmonious, stable,\nfamiliar refrain) which in turn produces further differ-\nence and possible arrhythmia enacting particular\nFigure 8. Noise model for part of Dublin (source: http://dublincitynoise.sonitussystems.com/noise-maps.php).\n(and unstable) space-times. Similarly, people who\naccess the data produced within both domains through\napps, websites and on-street signs seek to undertake\ntheir own rhythmanalysis that shapes their space-time\ndecision-making, and whose subsequent actions collect-\nively and cumulatively alter the rhythms of the city.\nOur analysis highlights that while both the traffic\ncontrol room and the sound network enact algorhyth-\nmic governance, it is clear that they do so in different\nways. Both systems are highly automated with respect\nto data generation, transmission, processing, analysis\nand sharing. They differ, however, with respect to\ntheir adaptiveness and action.\nSCATS is an adaptive system in two respects. First,\nthe regulation of the phases and cycles adapts to the\ndemand at junctions and across the road network and\ncertain priority rules. This process is a form of auto-\nmated management as defined by Dodge and Kitchin\n(2007), in which the system makes and enacts auto-\nmated, automatic and automated decisions. Second,\nunlike automated management in its pure form, a\nhuman controller can intervene, within certain param-\neters, to over-ride the automated adaptions and re-cali-\nbrate the system. In this sense, the system is one of\nhuman-on-the-loop (rather than human-off-the-loop),\nwherein the system works in an automated fashion but\nunder the watch of a human controller who can inter-\nvene (Docherty, 2012). Moreover, the system enacts real-\ntime actions and has real-time effects, with the phases\nand cycles of traffic lights at key junctions being dynam-\nically changed. As a result, every two cycles the length of\ntime vehicles wait at junction updates; the system has\nimmediate material actions designed to produce a\ndesired space-time rhythm. However, due to the poly-\nrhythmic and complex nature of cities, and the mutable\ncyclicality and linearity of algorhythms, the results are\nnever a perfect flow, but rather a semi-optimal concat-\nenation that seeks to stave off inertia or chaos.\nIn contrast, the sound network is fixed and non-adap-\ntive beyond periodic system upgrades. The system\nsimply generates sensor measurements, transmits them\nback to a central database, and updates a set of web-\nbased visualizations. Moreover, it engenders no immedi-\nate material action. Instead, the data is used to build up\nsound profiles of key locations over time and is com-\nbined with other data to produce sound models for the\ncity. These data and models are then used as the basis for\nidentifying and implementing noise reduction policies.\nIn other words, algorhythms form the basis of measuring\nand monitoring noise levels, and for justifying govern-\nance interventions, but the system does not directly inter-\nvene in action. As such, the noise monitoring networks\nconstitutes a form of algorhythmic governance that is\nnot yet fully automated or self-calibrating.\nThe two case studies thus reveal two different\nforms of algorhythmic governance which each enact a\ndifferent type of rhythmanalysis and perform different\nkinds of rhythm-making. It is our contention that there\nare many more forms of algorhythmic governance.\nThe most obvious third form is one where humans\nare off-the-loop, wherein an algorhythmic system has\nbeen delegated the responsibility and authority to pro-\ncess data and make decisions and act upon them with-\nout any human input or interaction (Docherty, 2012).\nIndeed, there is a need to explore further the ways in\nwhich algorhythmic governance is co-created by algo-\nrithms and actors and the ways in which each shapes\nthe other. Within each form of algorhythmic govern-\nance, there will be variability in how the mode of gov-\nernance of operates and how it is actioned, dependent\non a number of factors \u00ad data generated, technology\n(e.g., sensors used, network infrastructure, battery life),\nepistemic practices, epistemology (mode of analysis,\nvisualization), and forms of regulation and control\nexercised (in the case of human-off-the-loop varying\nfrom automated fines, to altering phases and cycles,\nto killing people as with military drones).\nIn each case, a combination of heterogeneous and\nlayered timings and devices, and practices of continuous\nmaintenance and calibration designed to balance and\nequalize repetitions and minimize difference, is enacted.\nAs our case studies highlight, a number of other issues\nare also raised. For example, how and where the net-\nworks of sensors are set up and calibrated: decisions that\nestablish a traffic cycle of 2 minutes with different\nphases, or a time frequency of 5 minutes, affects the\nactionability of data and the capability of actors to\nmonitor, detect and intervene. The sensitivity of sensors,\nlocal conditions, scientific norms and handling proced-\nures can add noise to the measurements, which can also\nbe biased and contain error (Kitchin et al., 2015).\nIndeed, there are always concerns over data fidelity, pre-\ncision, representativeness, cleanliness, consistency, and\nreliability of measurements, and the extent to which\nthese affect calculations. Moreover, calibration and fil-\ntering the signal from noise is reliant on computational\nprocedures to extract meaningful information, which\ninfluence the derived data. And given the polyrhythms\nand unfolding nature of cities, there is no established or\nstable norm against which such calibrations are being\nmade; to degree then, adaptive systems such as traffic\nmanagement are self-organizing, with system rules and\nhuman interventions based on a rule of thumb garnered\nfrom controller experience.\nColetta and Kitchin 13\nThere are also questions of transparency and\naccountability with respect to such algorhythmic govern-\nance. Within automated systems, the rules for acting on\ndata and making decisions is largely black-boxed, espe-\ncially for ordinary citizens. Yet it is known that pro-\ngrammers routinely, if unintentionally, change the\nsubstance of rules when translating them into computer\ncode, thus altering the regulatory work they do\ndirty or error-prone data can generate high rates of\nfalse positives and baseless decision making. As a\nresult, the result, the `transparency, accuracy, and polit-\nical accountability of administrative rulemaking' are\npotentially lost and are difficult to challenge (Citron,\nTo conclude, there is clearly much more research to\nbe undertaken to more fully chart the nature, workings\nand forms of algorhythmic governance, the various\nissues shaping and arising from their use, and how\nthey perform rhythmanalysis and rhythm-work in\norder to mediate the polymorphic temporal rhythms\nof urban life. Indeed, the city itself has an institutional\nand historical `heartbeat' that interact and is difficult to\nattune with the real-time one of smart urbanism, as one\nof our interviewee remarked:\nWhen you think about the physical city you have to\nthink in terms of the pulse rate being 30 years, a heart-\nbeat in Dublin terms is 30 years because that is how\nlong it takes to conceive of and build a bridge. You are\nlooking at timelines that are not driven by electronic\nInternet time clocks.. . . Whereas you talk through\nproblems like homelessness. . . and that is a very imme-\ndiate sharp focus problem, depending on government\npolicy it may be more or less of a problem in a particu-\nlar month, year and so on. So there are many different\ntimelines and tracks within a city. (Manager, large\ncompany)\nAlgorhythmic governance is the (semi)automated\nendeavour to combine of all these heterogeneous and\nlayered timings and devices, where the effort to cali-\nbrate, balance and equalize the heartbeat of the city\ngenerates both regulation and interference, entangling\n`real-time', past and future, and acting `at the same\ntime' on different scales.\n"
