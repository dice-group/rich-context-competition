In addition,\nthere are no well-accepted standards\nfor body fatness for children. Thus, in\ngeneral, weight adjusted for height is\nused rather than a more direct mea-\nsure of body fat. A variety of methods\nhave been used to adjust weight for\nheight, but currently the most com-\nmon, both for children and for adults,\nis BMI.12 For children, BMI varies con-\nsiderably with age, so generally the\nBMI of a child is compared with the\nBMI of a reference population of chil-\ndren of the same sex and age. A vari-\nety of reference data sets exist for BMI\nin childhood. There is no standard\ndefinition of adiposity or excess body\nfat in childhood against which given\nBMI levels can be compared.\ncharts are often used in the United\nStates to screen for overweight. These\ncharts were constructed from refer-\nence population samples of US chil-\nthan 6 years).6 In the construction of\npercentiles were smoothed with a vari-\nety of methods, but data were too\nsparse to estimate percentiles below\nthe 3rd or above the 97th percentile.\nUsing a different approach from that\ndeveloped by Cole,13 estimates of 3\nparameters, L (a skewness parameter),\nM (the median), and S (a measure of\nvariation), were calculated by solving\nequations that used the values for the\nsmoothed percentiles ranging from the\n3rd to the 97th. Because percentiles\nless than the 3rd or greater than the\n97th are beyond the range of the data\nfrom which the LMS values were esti-\nmated, \"extrapolation beyond this\nrange should be done with caution.\"6\nConsequently, we present estimates of\nhigh BMI for age based on the 97th\npercentile.\nThe increase in the prevalence of high\nBMI for age among US children that was\npreviously seen between NHANES III\nest BMI for age level, no change in\ntrends.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Ogden had full access to all\nof the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Ogden, Flegal.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Ogden, Carroll,\nFlegal.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Ogden, Carroll, Flegal.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Ogden, Carroll, Flegal.\nStatistical analysis: Ogden, Carroll, Flegal.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nRole of the Sponsor: All data used in this study\nwere collected by the National Center for Health\nStatistics, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion.
