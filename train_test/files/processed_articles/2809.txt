Habitual gait speed (HGS) and the figure-of-8 walking test (F8WT) are measures of walking ability\nthat have been associated with mobility outcomes and disability among older adults. Our objective was to contrast the\nphysiologic, health, and behavioral attributes underlying performance of these two walking tests among older adults with\nmobility limitations.\nMethods. HGS and F8WT were the primary outcomes. HGS was measured as time needed to walk a 4-m straight\ncourse at usual pace from standstill position. F8WT was measured as time to walk in a figure-of-8 pattern at self-selected\nusual pace from standstill position. Separate multivariable linear regression models were constructed that predicted walk-\ning performance. Independent variables included physiologic, cognitive\u00adbehavioral health attributes, and demographic\ninformation.\nResults.Of 430 participants, 414 completed both walking tests. Participants were 67.7% female, had a mean age\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n2.90 seconds. Within separate multivariable linear regression models (HGS: R2 = .46, p\nmodel\nmodel\n< .001), attributes statistically significant within both models included: trunk extension endurance, ankle\nrange of motion, leg press velocity at peak power, executive function, and sensory loss. Cognitive and physiologic attrib-\nutes uniquely associated with F8WT were cognitive processing speed and self-efficacy, and reaction time and heel-to-\nfloor time. Pain and peak leg press strength were associated with only HGS.\nConclusions. Both HGS and F8WT are useful tests of walking performance. Factors uniquely associated with F8WT\nsuggest that it may be well suited for use among older adult patients with balance problems or at risk for falls.\nKey Words: Walking--Mobility--Performance--Rehabilitation--Physiological attributes.\nDecision Editor: Stephen Kritchevsky, PhD\nMobility limitations affect 25% of adults more than\n65 years and impede walking and physical activity\nin this population (1). A number of studies suggest that\nlimitations in mobility are of increasingly greater concern\namong elderly adults because this ability remains central to\nmaintaining functional independence (2). Therefore, tools\nthat allow for early screening of those at risk for decline in\nmobility and performance-based walking are indispensable\nfor both geriatric research and clinical care (3). Key among\nthese tools is habitual gait speed (HGS), a measure of\nstraight-path walking, and a predictor of subsequent mor-\nbidity and mortality (4). Another important measure and a\nrecently validated test of walking skill, the figure-of-8 walk-\ningtest(F8WT),istheorizedtomoreaccuratelyassesswalk-\ning during activities that require navigating around curved\npaths and avoiding obstacles (5). Some reports indicate\nthat F8WT and HGS performance may be linked to tests of\nexecutive function (5). However, most of the studies evalu-\nating the attributes that underlie walking performance have\nbeen completed among relatively small samples (N < 150\nparticipants) and have not directly compared HGS and\nthe F8WT across a wide array of attributes that may influ-\nence performance (6). Consequently, it remains unclear\nwhether the two tests reflect different health attributes that\nunderlie mobility limitations among community-dwelling\nolder adults. We therefore sought to compare the physi-\nologic, cognitive, and health attributes underlying perfor-\nmance of HGS and F8WT to better understand how the two\ntests contrast. Direct comparison of the two tests allows\nus to better understand the relationships among the attrib-\nutes that influence mobility performance among elderly\nadults. To address this aim, we conducted an analysis of\nbaseline data collected as part of the Boston Rehabilitative\nImpairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE). Boston\nRISE is a prospective cohort study among 430 primary\ncare patients aged 65 and older, who are at risk for mobil-\nity decline and disability. Because F8WT consists of both\ncurvilinear and straight patterns of walking, we expected\nthat the Boston RISE study results would help delineate\nthe contexts of care in which the respective walking tests\nwould be most useful.\nMethods\nAll data were collected as part of the Boston RISE\nat the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston,\nMassachusetts. Boston RISE is a prospective cohort study\nregarding the aims, recruitment, and methods employed\nwithin Boston RISE have been published elsewhere and\nwill be briefly summarized (7). Recruitment for the study\nParticipants were recruited through primary care practices\nbased at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and\nWomen's Hospital, which are Partners HealthCare Medical\nCenters, located in Boston, MA. Eligibility criteria included\naged 65 or older, ability to understand and communicate\nin English, and presence of preclinical disability defined\nas self-reported limitation or modification in the ability to\nwalk half mile or climb one flight of stairs (10 steps), or\nlimitations in performing these mobility tasks due to under-\nlying health conditions (8). Exclusion criteria were the\npresence of a terminal disease, an episode of major surgery\nor myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, a planned\nmajor surgery, an anticipated move from the Boston area\nwithin 2 years, major medical problems interfering with\nsafe and successful testing, mini-mental status exam score\nless than 18, and Short Physical Performance Battery score\nTo address our aims, we performed a cross-sectional\nanalysis of baseline data from the Boston RISE cohort.\nWe included only those individuals (N = 414, 96%) who\ncompleted both HGS and F8WT and were able to do so\nwithout the use of a walker. These measures served as our\nprimary (dependent) outcome measures. Both HGS and\nF8WT measures were verbally explained and demonstrated\nto study participants prior to performance. Time needed\nto walk a 4-m straight course at usual pace from a stand-\nstill position was recorded using a stopwatch (timed to 0.1\nsecond) and was defined as the time between the first foot-\nfall after the 0-m mark and the first footfall after the 4-m\nmark. HGS was computed as the distance (4 m) divided by\nthe time to complete the walk (9). F8WT was measured as\nthe time to walk in a figure-of-8 pattern around two cones\nplaced 5 ft apart (1.525 m), at usual pace from a standstill\nposition (5). Participants started the walk from midway\nbetween the cones, facing outward from the cones, and\nasked to stop on return to the starting position. To avoid\ninfluencing movement planning for the F8WT, there was\nno mark to indicate the start or stop position or the specific\ndirection to start the walk (clockwise vs anticlockwise). We\nmeasured time from the first step and continued till the last\nstep brought the participant to side-by-side stance of the\nfeet at the original start point between the two cones (5).\nThe time to complete the task was the focus of our test,\nbut others have measured the amplitude (number of tests\ntaken) and the accuracy (the tightness or wideness of the\ncurved path) (5). Intraclass correlation coefficient for test\u00ad\nretest reliability for time to complete F8WT is .84 (95%\nHealth and cognitive\u00adbehavioral attributes assessed\nincluded pain severity via the severity subscale of the\nBrief Pain Inventory (12), depression as manifested by\na score greater than or equal to 10 on the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire 9-item scale (13), self-efficacy via the\nActivities-specific Balance Confidence scale (14), and exec-\nutive function and psychomotor speed via the Trails-making\ntest A and B. The Trails A test primarily assesses visuoper-\nceptual and psychomotor speed, whereas Trails B assesses\nswitching of attention, working memory, and cognitive\nflexibility (all executive functions), as well as psychomotor\nspeed and visuoperceptual abilities. A derived trails score\n(Trails B - A) was used to emphasize executive function by\ndiminishing the influence of psychomotor speed (15).\nPhysiologic attributes assessed in the baseline exam\nincluded heel-to-floor time, reaction time, trunk muscle\nendurance, limb joint range of motion, sensory loss, and leg\npress strength, power, and velocity.\nPeak Leg Press Strength, Power, and Velocity\nWe measured each attribute separately for each leg using\na computerized pneumatic leg press machine (Keiser A420\nPneumatic Leg Press, Keiser Co., Fresno, CA). We deter-\nmined the one repetition maximum (1RM) as previously\ndescribed (16) and then measured leg muscle power and\nstrength for five repetitions performed at 40% and 70% 1RM.\nWe computed leg velocity at peak power by inspecting the\nrespective analog graphs of power and force and dividing the\nrecorded peak power by the peak force at peak power.We also\nrecorded the peak velocity (highest value on velocity analog\ngraph generated by the computer software) during the repeti-\ntion at which peak power was recorded. We determined the\nvelocity value for each leg at resistances that corresponded to\n40% and 70% 1RM. The highest value regardless of side or\npercent 1RM was recorded as peak velocity.\nAsymmetry of Leg Strength and Leg Power\nWe measured asymmetry of leg strength as the ratio of\nthe higher of the leg press strength values over the corre-\nsponding value of the other side. Similarly, asymmetry of\nleg power was measured as the ratio of the peak leg press\npower in a similar fashion (17).\nHeel-to-Floor Time and Reaction Time\nHeel-to-floor time is a test of rapid leg coordination and\nwas measured in a seated position as the time to complete\n10 repetitions in which the heel of one foot was placed\njust below the opposite knee and then back to the floor (7).\nReaction time was measured using a validated computer-\nbased test in which participants pressed a mouse button\nafter the appearance of a bright light on a computer screen,\nwhich appeared at random intervals. Participants were\ngiven five practice trials, and reaction time was recorded as\nthe mean of 10 subsequent measurement trials (18).\nTrunk Muscle Extension Endurance\nTrunk muscle extension endurance was measured as pre-\nviously described (19). Extension endurance was measured\nwhile the participant was lying prone on a specialized plinth\npositioned 45\u00b0 from vertical with feet fixed in position on\na footplate and the body supported below the waist by the\ntable. The participant maintained their trunk in a neutral\nposition within the sagital plane in line with their pelvis and\nlegs for as long as possible with arms across the chest. The\ntest was terminated when the participant was no longer able\nto maintain the unsupported position. Time was recorded in\nseconds for all measures (20).\nKyphosis\nWe measured kyphosis using a flexicurve ruler by a\nvalidated and reliable technique (21).\nJoint Range of Motion\nWe measured knee range of motion, ankle dorsiflexion,\nand ankle plantarflexion using a goniometer (10). To evalu-\nate reduced ankle range of motion, decreases in dorsiflexion\nand plantarflexion were defined as the inability to dorsiflex\nSensory Loss\nSensory loss was measured by the validated Semmes-\nWeinstein monofilament test for peripheral sensation (22).\nSensory loss was dichotomized as sensory loss present or\nOther covariates included age, gender, education (num-\nber completing  high school grade 12), number of chronic\nconditions (via the standardized comorbidity questionnaire)\n(24), and body mass index in kilograms per square meter\n(estimated from participants' height and weight). All study\nprocedures were approved by the Spaulding Rehabilitation\nHospital Institutional Review Board and were well toler-\nated by study participants without occurrence of any associ-\nated injuries or serious adverse events.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS version\n9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All data were initially\ninspected using descriptive statistics. Time to complete the\nF8WT and the HGS were treated as continuous variables\n(5). Lower limb strength and trunk muscle extension were\nnormalized per body weight in kilograms. Body mass\nindex was treated as a categorical variable based on the\nstandard National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute cut\npoints for body mass index: normal, less than or equal to\n30 (25). Comparison of the calculated leg press velocity\nwith the actual measured peak leg press velocity showed\nthe former explained more of the variance in both walking\ntests, so calculated leg velocity was used in all subsequent\ndata analyses. We separately examined the bivariate\nassociation between each of the independent variables and\nboth outcomes. In addition, we tested for the contribution\nof different aspects of cognition (Trails A, Trails B, Trails\nB - A) to HGS versus F8WT. All potential variables were\nevaluated for collinearity. For variables in which collinearity\nwas present (r  .4), decisions for inclusion were based\nupon clinical relevance and strength of association with\nthe outcomes (eg, asymmetry of leg strength was chosen\nover asymmetry of leg power due to its higher association\nwith the walking tests). Separate multivariable linear\nregression models for HGS versus F8WT were generated\nby including all potential variables and then employing\na manual backward elimination process, advocated by\nSun and colleagues (26). Based on predefined criteria,\niterative models were evaluated after individually removing\nnonsignificant predictors (p  .05) and inspecting to ensure\nthat their removal did not meaningfully alter the estimates\nor standard errors of the retained values (ie, >10% change\nin the estimates or standard errors). Age, gender, education,\noverweight status, and obese status were retained in both\nmodels because they were deemed to be clinically relevant\nadjustment variables. To evaluate the relevance of the\ndifferent aspects of cognition, Trails A, Trails B, and Trails\nB - A were evaluate within separate multivariable models\nfor each walking test in order to understand their respective\nassociation with the outcomes. Finally, each multivariable\nmodel was reevaluated to ensure that each satisfied all\nstatistical assumptions of regression modeling (normal\ndistribution of residuals, no outliers, no relationship between\nresiduals and explanatory variables, no multicollinearity,\nand no heteroscedasticity). An alpha level less than .05 was\nused to determine statistical significance.\nResults\nParticipant baseline characteristics are presented in\nTable 1. The study population was 67.7% female, had\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nchronic medical conditions. The mean HGS of participants\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nThe mean HGS of participants with missing data was\n\u00b1\n4.1 seconds. Demographic and clinical charac-\nteristics of participants with missing values compared with\nthose of participants with complete data showed that both\ngroups were not significantly different in age, gender, body\nmass index categories, college education, pain severity, or\nreaction time (Table 2). However, those with missing data\ntended to be sicker (higher number of chronic conditions),\nhad more kyphosis, lower self-efficacy scores, and were 1.8\nseconds slower on F8WT and 0.12 m/s slower on the HGS\ntest, compared with those with complete data.\nThe F8WT and HGS were strongly correlated with each\nother (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = -.67, p < .0001).\nTable 3 presents the results of bivariate linear regression\nanalyses between each of the independent variables and\neach of the outcomes.\nThe adjusted R2 reflects the variance in HGS and F8WT\nexplained by each model. Physiologic and health attributes\nthat explained greater than 10% of the adjusted variance\nin HGS and F8WT were peak leg press velocity (at peak\npower), peak leg press strength, trunk muscle extension\nendurance, ankle range of motion, executive function,\nand self-efficacy (Table 3). Bivariate analysis evaluating\ncontribution of different aspects of cognition showed that\nTrails A explained 12% of variance in F8WT and 6%\nvariance in HGS. Although Trails B explained 14% of\nthe variance in both walking tests, Trails B - A explained\n12% variance in HGS and 9% variance in F8WT (Table 3).\nSeparate multivariable linear regression models were\nconstructed to determine which physiologic and health/\nbehavioral attributes contributed to HGS (R2 = .44, p\nmodel\n<\nmodel\nAttributes that achieved statistical significance in the final\nmodel for both walking outcomes were Trails B, trunk\nextension endurance, ankle range of motion (reduction in\ndorsiflexion and plantarflexion), leg press velocity at peak\npower, and sensory loss. Attributes that uniquely achieved\nstatistical significance with F8WT were reaction time,\nheel-to-floor time, self-efficacy, and cognitive processing\nspeed (Trails A). Pain and peak leg press strength were\nsignificantly associated with HGS performance (Table 4).\nIn separate models, the derived trails score (Trails B - A)\nwas associated with HGS but not with F8WT (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe major findings of our investigation comparing attrib-\nutives predictive of HGS and F8WT were (i) that certain\nattributes were associated with performance on both tests\n(leg press velocity at peak power, trunk muscle extension\nendurance, executive function as measured by Trails B,\nand ankle range of motion) and (ii) other attributes were\nuniquely associated with each respective test. Specifically,\nwhereas pain severity and peak leg press strength were\nassociated with HGS performance, self-efficacy, reaction\ntime, heel-to-floor time, and cognitive processing speed (as\nmeasured by Trails A) were uniquely associated with time\nto complete F8WT performance.\nTable 1.

We observed\nthat the Trails B test performance was associated with per-\nformance on both walking performance tests. Consistent\nwith our findings, prior studies have linked certain aspects\nof cognition with performance on F8WT and HGS tests\n(27). The Trails-making test part B measures cognitive skills\nsuch as attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility\n(all executive functions), as well as psychomotor speed and\nvisuoperceptual abilities (15,28). Our study findings are\nunique in that when the derived trails test (Trails B \u00ad A) was\nutilized (see Table 4), executive cognitive function was no\nlonger associated with F8WT. The Trails B - A was devel-\noped to diminish the component of processing speed and to\nemphasize executive function components (15,29). The one\naspect of Trails B - A, which reflects processing speed, is\nmore uniquely related to the switch demands of the Trails B\ntest. Our results suggest that among the cognitive skills we\ntested, performance on the F8WT is most sensitive to speed\nof cognitive processing in general. This conclusion is sup-\nported by the fact that Trails A, which emphasizes cognitive\nprocessing speed and diminishes executive function, was\nsignificantly associated with F8WT but not with HGS. The\nassociation of straight-path walking with executive function\nis well established (30). Our results highlight that curved-\npath walking may be sensitive to other aspects of cognition\nand reinforce the connection between walking performance\nand cognitive processing previously highlighted in an\nimportant review article (30).\nThese findings with regard to speed of processing with\ncognitive tasks are also mirrored by our findings with regard\nto the other measured attributes that were uniquely associated\nwith F8WT performance. Reaction time and heel-to-floor\ntime (a test of rapid leg coordination) were both uniquely\nassociated with F8WT performance. These tests measure\nrapid movements of the limbs and thus are also speed-\ndependent attributes. Our findings suggest that navigation of\na curved path draws upon aspects of both central and periph-\neral components relevant to processing speed. The clinical\nimplications of the finding should be interpreted in light of\nthe fact that self-efficacy was also uniquely associated with\nF8WT. Reaction time, speed of movement, and self-efficacy\nare attributes that have all been linked to falls. For exam-\nple, the ability to catch oneself quickly after a perturbation\nis considered to be a very important skill in preventing a fall\nor fall-related injury (30). Reaction time and heel-to-floor\ntime as reflections of limb speed of movement are related\nto this ability as well (31). Reaction time has been directly\nTable 3.

The heel-to-floor\ntest has not yet been evaluated in this context. In addition,\nthe scores on our self-efficacy measure (Activities-specific\nBalance Confidence scale) are predictive of falls (32). Taken\ntogether, our study results suggest that F8WT performance\nmight be closely related to \"central\" cognitive\u00adbehavioral\nattributes (cognitive processing speed and self-efficacy)\nand \"peripheral\" physiologic attributes (reaction time, rapid\ncoordination, and sensory loss), which are linked to falls and\nfall-related injuries (30,33). An evaluation of F8WT as a\npredictor of falls outcomes has not been reported, but would\nbe justified based on these findings.\nThe findings with regard to leg velocity and leg strength\ncontrast with our aforementioned results. Leg velocity was\nassociated with both walking tests; however, leg strength was\nonly associated with HGS. Both leg velocity and leg strength\nare components of leg power (power = force \u00d7 velocity), an\nattribute linked to a variety of physical functional tasks (34).\nLeg velocity as measured in our study reflects peripheral\ngeneration of speed of movement at relatively slower speeds\nbecause it is generated against a more substantial resistance\n(~40% 1RM). It is likely that this attribute, which is derived\nfrom power generation of the hip extensors and quadriceps,\nrepresents biomechanical aspects of walking that are com-\nmon to both tests. The fact that leg strength was uniquely\nassociated with HGS and not F8WT may also be one expla-\nnation for the observed association of pain with HGS and\nnot F8WT. For example, in HGS, when an individual has\nan arthritic or sore limb, they may experience greater pain\nbecause larger forces are being generated across that limb.\nAlternatively, the same individual may not have pain influ-\nence on F8WT performance to the same degree because\nforce production is less influential on performance.\nOther possible explanations exist for the unique associa-\ntion of pain with HGS. It is possible that different motor\npatterns involving hip joint loading, stride length, and\nstance adjustments during walking may explain this find-\ning (35). With F8WT performance, the asymmetry of foot\nplacement, stride length, and stance adjustments needed\nto achieve curvilinear walking, likely produces alterations\nin limb joint loading throughout the test. In comparison,\nduring HGS performance, repetition of limb placement in\nstraight-path walking leads to a repeated pattern of hip and\nlower limb joint loading. Thus, a repeated joint loading pat-\ntern within a painful joint may bring about a greater per-\nformance\u00adpain association than what is observed in F8WT.\nLastly, it is plausible that participants generally walk faster\nwhen going in a straight line but almost everyone slows\ndown to walk in a curved path because it is a more com-\nplex task. Thus, walking faster (during HGS) may be more\nTable 4.

A more detailed bio-\nmechanical assessment of these two walking tasks in future\ninvestigations may help explain many of the observed dif-\nferences between HGS and F8WT.\nStudy Limitations\nOur study is cross-sectional, and thus causation cannot\nbe determined. A prospective study may allow us to better\nestablish temporal relationships between physiologic attrib-\nutes and measures of walking skill. Because we used base-\nline data, further understanding of these relationships will\nbenefit from longitudinal analyses of the attributes influenc-\ning both tests, and importantly how these relate to mobil-\nity limitations among older adults. Additionally, we did not\nevaluate certain aspects of F8WT, which other studies have\ninvestigated. These include the amplitude and accuracy\n(wideness or narrowness) of the curved path traversed dur-\ning the F8WT, which are components of F8WT that were\nnot measured in the Boston RISE study. These other aspects\nof F8WT performance may also have clinical relevance,\nperhaps with regard to the associated cognitive tests utilized\nin this study. Thus, we confine our conclusions to a single\naspect of F8WT performance (time for completion).\nIn addition, although this study screened out those with\nmoderate to severe dementia, it is plausible that some par-\nticipants had early dementia and this may have influenced\nfindings with respect to the cognitive measures and the\nassociated performance on the walking tests.\nFinally, we did have missing data. The magnitude of\nmissing data is consistent with other well-established\ncohort studies of community-dwelling older adults (7).\nPatients with missing data tended to be sicker (higher num-\nber of chronic conditions), had more kyphosis and smaller\nself-efficacy scores, compared with those with complete\ndata. Importantly, patients with missing data were 1.8\nseconds and 0.14 m/s slower on the F8WT and HGS test,\nrespectively, compared with those with complete data. The\ndifference in gait speed (>0.10 m/s) suggests that these\nindividuals were at clinically meaningful lower levels of\nfunction (36). Thus, it may be challenging to extrapolate\nour findings to individuals at the lowest levels of functional\nperformance.\nThe major strength of this study lies in the large num-\nber of attributes investigated that contribute to walking\nperformance and the identification of those attributes that\ndistinguish F8WT and HGS. Although heel-to-floor time\nis a relatively new test, first used on a large scale within\na different study (37), both the Activities-specific Balance\nConfidence scale and the reaction time test have been linked\nto falls (31). Thus, in contrast to HGS, which is advocated\nfor use among patients at risk for disability and mortality\n(4), F8WT may be useful among patients prone to balance\nand fall-related problems. Alternatively, given the observed\nassociation between pain and HGS performance, HGS may\nbe useful in the assessment of older adults undergoing treat-\nment for pain problems. These hypotheses are worthy of\nfuture study.\nConclusions\nHGS and F8WT are performance-based walking tests\nthat are dependent upon a number of different attributes.\nAlthough both tests are associated with tests of cognitive\nfunction, F8WT appears to be particularly sensitive to cog-\nnitive processing speed. Reaction time, heel-to-floor time,\nand self-efficacy are attributes that are uniquely associated\nwith F8WT, and HGS is uniquely associated with pain\nseverity. The use of F8WT or HGS should be considered\nbased on the clinical context and in light of the attributes\nthat are uniquely associated with each test. These contrast-\ning findings have important implications for clinicians and\nresearchers evaluating walking performance among older\nadults.\nFunding\n04, Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center, from the National\nCenter for Research Resources.\n"
