    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This DataWatch reports on the key findings from the 1993 Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation Family Health Insurance Survey, which interviewed\nmore than 27,000 families in ten states. There is considerable variation among\nthe states in insurance coverage, health status, and access to care of both\nadults and children. Moreover, states with higher percentages of uninsured\nresidents also have populations with lower health status and more access\nproblems. This clustering of problems in certain states may make health care\nreform even more challenging for their elected officials to accomplish.\nOnly a few years ago national health care reform was at\nthe center of health policy discussions.1 Over a longer period,\nseveral states have shown interest in health care reform, and\nsome of them have legislated and implemented reforms.2 Now Con-\ngress and the Clinton administration have joined them by express-\ning strong interest in increasing state flexibility and responsibility\nfor reform. For example, the Clinton administration has strongly\nsupported Section 1115 Medicaid waivers, and the new State Chil-\ndren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), signed into law as part of\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, relies on federal grants to partici-\npating states, which will design and administer the program.3\nThe problems to be corrected by health care reform have been\nwell documented for the nation as a whole. We know a good deal\nabout the number of uninsured Americans, their characteristics, and\nthe implications of being uninsured for access to health care and use\nof services.4 On the other hand, as the focus shifts to the states, it is\nimportant to ask if these national patterns represent the circum-\nstances of all states equally well. To put it another way, does each\n\u00a91998 The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nJoel Cantor is director of the Division of Research, United Hospital Fund of New York,\nand an associate professor in New York University's Robert F.

Although we do have estimates of variation in the uninsur-\nance rate by state from a national survey, there is limited comparable\ninformation on state circumstances along several other problem\ndimensions.5\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) launched a pro-\ngram, State Initiatives in Health Care Reform, in 1991 to award\ngrants to individual states to assist them with the process of design-\ning and implementing health care reforms.6 The grantee states were\nselected, in part, for their geographic diversity, the extent of unin-\nsurance, and the proposed approach to reform. Although the grantee\nstates were required to have a clear, prospective plan for health care\nreform, they varied widely in the extent of previous reforms, and\nseveral of them had no history of reform.7 As part of the RWJF\nprogram, we developed and fielded two surveys to better under-\nstand the states' problems, analyze policy options, and collect base-\nline data to support subsequent evaluation of outcomes. An earlier\nreport described results from the Employer Health Insurance Sur-\nvey.8 In this paper we report key results from the Family Health\nInsurance Survey.\nStudy Methods\nThe RWJF Family Health Insurance Survey was conducted in the\nNew Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Ver-\nmont, and Washington State.9 It collected detailed information on\ninsurance status, as well as information on demographic charac-\nteristics, employment, income, health status, access to health care,\nand use of health services.10 Response rates ranged from a low of 61\npercent in New York to a high of 83 percent in North Dakota.\nMore than 2,000 twenty-five-minute telephone interviews were\nconducted with families in each state, supplemented by 100\u00ad200\nin-person interviews in households having no telephone. This\nthe ten states. Families with Medicaid enrollees or uninsured per-\nsons were oversampled using a general population telephone\nscreening interview. The Medicaid population identified in the\nscreening interview was supplemented by sampling from program\nenrollment lists in nine of the ten states. Finally, households with-\nout telephones in a few geographic areas in each state were identi-\nfied and interviewed in person.\nThe interview unit was the family. Within each family, the survey\ncollected all data items for all adults; insurance and other charac-\nteristics were collected for all children, but health status and service\nREFORM\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 7 , N u m b e r 1\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The weights adjust\nfor the probability of selection and for differential nonresponse\namong subgroups of families. The estimates are for the nonelderly\npopulation and are provided separately for adults and children. All\ninsurance and health status estimates refer to the day of the inter-\nview. The estimates of health service use and measures of access\nproblems--not having a usual provider and not receiving selected\nhealth services--refer to various reference periods preceding the\ninterview.\nStudy Findings\nOverall, the ten survey states are quite representative of all fifty\nstates in the average level and variability of several important popu-\nlation, health care system, and health policy characteristics (Exhibit\nall states and $21,770 in the ten survey states, while the range was\nsurvey states. To cite another example, the survey states cover\nnearly the complete range of generosity in Medicaid program eligi-\nbility, as measured by the ratio of Medicaid recipients to the popula-\ntion in poverty. Measures of variation in managed care penetration\nand the supply of hospitals and physicians also are very similar.\nExtent of insurance coverage. The health care circumstances of\npeople in the ten study states vary substantially (Exhibit 2). The\npercentage of the nonelderly population without health insurance\ncoverage in 1993 varied nearly threefold, from 27 percent in New\nMexico to 10 percent in Minnesota. The percentage of uninsured\npersons is lower for children (under age eighteen) than it is for\nadults (ages eighteen to sixty-four) in nine states. However, the\nrange of variation among the states in the percentage of uninsured\npersons is greater for children (ratio of the high to low state is 4.0 to\nHealth status and access. Key measures of health status and\naccess to care follow a similar pattern (Exhibit 2). The percentage of\nadults and children reported to be in fair or poor health (on a five-\nlevel scale) or reported to have no usual source of medical care other\nthan an emergency department are highest in the states with a high\npercentage of uninsured persons.11 As we observed in patterns of\ninsurance coverage, there is more interstate variation among chil-\ndren than there is among adults. The ratio of the high to the low\nstate on both measures is at least twice as great among children as it\nis among adults.\nHigh-uninsured states versus low-uninsured states.

In each, we group the three states with\nthe highest percentage of uninsured persons and the three states\nwith the lowest percentage of uninsured persons. Specifically, we\ncompare circumstances in Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma--\nthe high-uninsured states--with those in Minnesota, North Da-\nkota, and Vermont--the low-uninsured states.\nThese and the estimates that follow are based on simple means of\nthe separate estimates for the three individual states (that is, they\nare not weighted by each state's population), because our objective\nis to use these states as observations to characterize circumstances\nin similarly situated states that were not studied. In contrasting the\npatterns for high- and low-uninsured states, we examined the con-\nditions for the middle four states grouped (not shown in the exhib-\nits). With the exception of one measure (childhood immunization\ncompliance), estimates of health care problems for the middle four\nstates fell between those for the high- and low-uninsured states.\nInsurance coverage. Exhibit 3 shows the distribution of public\nand private health insurance coverage of adults and children. The\ninterstate variation in the uninsured rate for each age group is mir-\nrored by differences in the rate of private coverage, but the percent-\nage with public coverage in each age group varies little among the\nstates.12 Therefore, the relatively wider interstate spread in the per-\ncentage of children without coverage--also seen in Exhibit 2--\nstems from wider variations in the rate of private coverage for them.\nHealth status.

Also,\nthe percentage of adults limited in the kind or amount of vigorous or\nmoderate physical activity (for example, lifting heavy objects, mov-\ning a table, or carrying groceries) is modestly higher in the high-\nAccess to care. The measures of access to care shown in Exhibit\n5 reveal greater problems in the three states with the highest per-\ncentage of uninsured than in the three low-uninsured states. The\nfirst two measures of poor access--lack of a usual source of care\n(other than the emergency department), and not receiving emer-\ngency care when needed--are two to three times higher in the\nhigh-uninsured states. The rates of these access problems are higher\nfor adults than they are for children.\nHealth Insurance Status Of Adults And Children, Three High-Uninsured Versus\nAge group/insurance Three high statesa Three low statesb\nAdults\nUninsured\nPrivate insurance\nPublic insurance\nChildren\nUninsured\nPrivate Insurance\nPublic Insurancec\nSOURCE: 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Family Health Insurance Survey.\na Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.\nb Minnesota, North Dakota, and Vermont.\nc Persons having any type of private coverage were classified as covered by private insurance; therefore, public insurance is\nlimited to those with only a public source of coverage.

First, among adults and children the percentage\nwith no doctor visit in the year prior to the survey is about 1.2 and 1.5\ntimes greater, respectively, in the high-uninsured states than in the\nlow-uninsured states. This difference prevails despite the fact that\npeople in the high-uninsured states are in poorer health, which\nshould make them more likely to have seen a physician. Three meas-\nures of preventive services use show similar patterns. The percent-\nage of women ages nineteen to sixty-four who fail to receive a rec-\nommended Pap smear, the percentage of women ages forty-one to\nsixty-four who fail to obtain at least one mammogram, and the\npercentage of children ages two to four who fail to receive at least\none recommended immunization were between 1.2 and 1.5 times\ngreater in the high-uninsured states.14\nDiscussion\nIn the current political environment, much of the responsibility\nfor improving health care access and affordability is vested in gover-\nnors and state legislatures rather than in the federal government.\nThe new CHIP provides federal funds to assist states in providing\ncoverage to their low-income, uninsured children. However, to par-\nticipate in CHIP, states also must contribute payments to the pro-\ngram and make many decisions about its design.15 In this DataWatch\nwe found considerable interstate variability in the health insurance\nAccess To Care For Adults And Children, Three High-Uninsured Versus Three\nAccess measure/age group Three high statesa Three low statesb\nNo usual source of care, other than emergency room\nAdults\nChildren\nDid not get emergency care when needed\nAdults\nChildren\nNo physician visits in past 12 months\nAdults\nChildren\nNo Pap smear\nNo mammogram\nNot fully immunized\nSOURCE: 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Family Health Insurance Survey.\na Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.\nb Minnesota, North Dakota, and Vermont\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 8\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

While the percentage of uninsured children is\nlower than the percentage of uninsured adults in most states, still\nalmost one-quarter of all children are uninsured in the three states\nwith the highest uninsured rates. Thus, the ease with which some\nstates would have been able to take significant steps on their own to\nclose the gap in the care of children may be less than widely be-\nlieved. This suggests that federal support for states' efforts, as em-\nbodied in CHIP, is well placed. This program may help to diminish\nthe disparity we now see among states in the rate of uninsured\nchildren.\nWe find that health care problems cluster within states: Those\nwith the highest percentages of uninsured persons also have lower\nlevels of average health status and higher levels of access problems.\nStates with both a high percentage of their population without\ninsurance and with low health status will have to spend more per\ncapita than other states spend to attain equivalent outcomes. The\nsubstantial variation suggests that a strategy relying on incremental,\nstate-by-state action is likely to leave the nation with significant\nlingering gaps in the health care of many Americans. While some\nstates such as Minnesota and Vermont may be expected to redress a\nsignificant part of their respective health system problems, the chal-\nlenges to other states such as Florida, New Mexico, and Oklahoma\nare far greater.\nAlthough our results provide a better quantification of the prob-\nlems state health reformers face, their policy implications are not\nentirely clear. We observe considerable clustering of various prob-\nlems among states with the highest rates of uninsurance. Yet from\nthe data presented here, we cannot discern whether this represents\nthe coincidence of several different problems, each requiring a dif-\nferent policy remedy, or the single core problem of inadequate rates\nof insurance, with the obvious policy implication to expand cover-\nage. There is a well-documented connection between lower rates of\ncoverage and poorer access to medical care, but we cannot be sure\nthat this is the only cause of the access shortfalls that we observe\namong the states. Moreover, it is possible that the lower levels of\nhealth status in the high-uninsured states merely reflect the effects\nof long-standing insurance coverage gaps and correspondingly\npoorer access to care. On the other hand, the observed health status\ndifferences also could be the result of differences in income, educa-\n\"A strategy relying on incremental, state-by-state action is likely\nto leave significant lingering gaps in health care.\"\nREFORM\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 7 , N u m b e r 1\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Until these more complex relationships can be sorted out\nthrough further research, it would be premature to conclude that\nhealth care reform either is or is not simply a matter of insurance\ncoverage expansions.
