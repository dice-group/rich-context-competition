In this study, we aimed to estimate total\nantioxidant intakes from diets and supplement sources in the U.S. population. The USDA Flavonoid Database, food\nwere used in this study. Daily total antioxidant intake was 208 mg vitamin C (46 and 54% from diets and supplements,\n(89 and 11), and 210 mg flavonoids (98 and 2). Antioxidant intakes differed among sociodemographic subgroups and\nlifestyle behaviors. Energy-adjusted dietary antioxidant intakes were higher in women, older adults, Caucasians,\nnonconsumers of alcohol (only for vitamin C and carotenes), nonsmokers (only for vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenes), and\nin those with a higher income and exercise level (except for flavonoids) than in their counterparts (P , 0.05). Consumption\nof fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may be a good strategy to increase antioxidant intake. The possible association\nbetween antioxidant intake and the prevalence of chronic diseases should be investigated further. J. Nutr. 140: 317\u00ad324,\n",

With the\nadvancement of science, varying forms of natural antioxidants\nwith different strengths are being discovered in dietary sources\nand dietary supplements. However, the health benefits of\nantioxidant intake in reducing oxidative stress and inflamma-\ntory process remains inconclusive (3\u00ad5). This is partially due to\nthe incompleteness of the intake data in various forms and doses\nof antioxidants. Furthermore, antioxidants are present in human\ndiets in many different chemical forms, e.g. flavonoids, caro-\ntenes, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium.\nIn fruits and vegetables, vitamin C contributes only ~14%\nof the total antioxidant capacity and phenolic phytochemicals\nsuch as flavonoids contribute the most (6,7). The phenolic\ncompounds that are the major sources of total antioxidant\ncapacity and prevent LDL oxidation are quercetin in apples\nand onions; catechin, procyanidin, quercetin, and kaempferol\nin grapes and wines; and genistein in soybeans (8\u00ad10).\nRecently, high consumption of flavonoids and isoflavones by\nJapanese women was related to their lower incidence of CVD\n(11). Flavonoids and their derivatives are the most abundant\ngroup of polyphenolics with antioxidant properties in diets (7).\nThe protective effect of flavonoid-rich foods on risk of chronic\ndiseases has been explained by their antioxidant properties\n(12\u00ad15), whereas others reported no associations between\nflavonoid intake and CVD risks (16\u00ad19). In 3 European studies\nconducted in Finland (20), 7 European countries (21), and the\nNetherlands (Zutphen) (22), the sum of dietary intakes of only\n5 common flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, myrice-\ntin, and quercetin) was inversely associated with the risks of\nCVD. In studies conducted in the US (17\u00ad19), however, no\nassociation was observed between flavonoid intake and CVD\nrisks. These studies quantitated only partial intakes of all\nantioxidants because of methodological limitations imposed by\nlack of flavonoid composition in foods, which were not\navailable until recently. The importance of antioxidants in\nreducing risks of chronic diseases has been extensively studied;\nhowever, antioxidant intake in a free-living population has not\nyet been estimated adequately.\nRecently, our research group reported estimates of the total\ndietary flavonoid intake of the U.S. population based on the\nrecently released USDA flavonoid databases matched with food\n2 Author disclosures: O.

The National Center for Health Statistics has\nconducted the NHANES to obtain nationally representative information\non the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. All\ninterviewed persons were invited to the mobile examination center,\nwhere the 24-h dietary recall (DR) and questionnaires on dietary\nsupplement use were administered. A total of 8809 individuals over 19 y\nThis study included vitamin C, vitamin E, carotene, flavonoid, and\nselenium intakes from diet and dietary supplements to estimate the\nindividual and total antioxidant intakes.\nThe U.S. adult population was grouped by sociodemographic and\n(non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; Mexican-American; others),\ny\"), current smoking (yes or no to \"current smoking\" and \"smoked\ncigarettes, cigars, or pipes and/or used chewing tobacco or snuff at least\nonce during the past 30 d\"), and exercise levels [expressed as the\nmetabolic equivalent (MET) score calculated by combining the intensity\nlevel of the leisure time activities reported, mean duration, and\nFood consumption data. Dietary antioxidant vitamin, selenium, and\nflavonoid intakes were estimated based on one 24-h DR (midnight to\nfoods and beverages consumed by the respondents except for plain\ndrinking water. To minimize errors from misreporting, individuals with\nunreliable or incomplete DR records were excluded as noted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (26).\nUSDA flavonoid databases. Details of the datasets used in this study\nwere reported in our previous study (23). Briefly, we created 1 flavonoid\ndatabase from 2 different data sets released in recent years: 1) the USDA\nDatabase for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Food (27) includes the\nmost abundant 19 individual flavonoid compounds in 5 flavonoid\nsubgroups (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocya-\nnidins) in 234 selected foods; 2) The USDA-Iowa State University\nDatabase on the Isoflavone Content of Foods (28) was created by\nextensive sampling of 108 soy-containing foods and subsequent analysis\nat Iowa State University. The combined flavonoid database consisted of\n24 flavonoid compounds: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin,\nisorhamnetin), flavones (luteolin, apigenin), flavanones (eriodictyol,\nhesperetin, naringenin), flavan-3-ols (catechins, epicatechins, theafla-\nvins, thearubigins), anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin,\npelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein,\nglycitein, biochanin A, formononetin). To improve the coverage of the\nestimated flavonoid intake, we expanded the flavonoid database\naccording to the preestablished protocol that has been described\nextensively in a separate publication (23).\nEstimation of dietary antioxidant intakes. We matched the NHANES\nfood consumption data with the flavonoid database following the steps\ndescribed in our previous work (23): 1) conversion of food items in\nNHANES DR to USDA Standard Reference codes using food recipe\nbook and food description data file for NHANES food codes; 2) weight\nadjustment using moisture content; 3) code modification using the USDA\nfood unit conversion search program; and 4) linking food intake data\nwith the flavonoid database. Daily individual flavonoid intake from\nselected foods was determined by multiplying the content of the\nindividual flavonoid (mg aglycone equivalent/100 g food) by the daily\nconsumption (g/d) of the selected food item. Data on individual\nparticipants' daily dietary intakes of antioxidant vitamins and selenium\nEstimation of antioxidant intakes from dietary supplement use.\nenables investigators to estimate the individual participant's antioxidant\nvitamin, selenium, and flavonoid intakes from dietary supplements.\n2002 consist of 5 files: supplement counts, supplement records,\nsupplement information, ingredient information, and blend information\n(24,25). To calculate the intakes of antioxidant nutrients from the\nsupplement, vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenes, selenium, and flavonoids\nwere selected from the ingredient information file. Next, nutrient\ncomposition table of supplements containing the antioxidants was made\nusing the supplement information file. The antioxidant intakes from the\nsupplements were calculated using the supplement counts file, supple-\nment records file, and the nutrient composition table of supplements.\nIngredient units in the supplements were converted to the Dietary\nReference Intakes units. Nutrient compounds in the supplement were\nconverted to the elemental nutrients; e.g. the conversion factor of 43%\nfor ascorbyl palmitate to ascorbic acid was used (29).\nmatch their nutrient units. Among 6 carotenoids (a-carotene, b-\ncarotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin) available\nintake data were used in this study to estimate carotene intake in the\nform of retinol activity equivalent (RAE), because the NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2000 provides carotene intake (a-carotene + b-carotene) data only. For\nthe supplement label expressed as \"b-carotene-% of vitamin A,\" the\ncontent of b-carotene in the supplements was calculated after the content\nof vitamin A in the supplement was found.\nVitamin E has several different units for the expression of its\nactivity. In the 1980 Recommended Dietary Allowances (30), units for\nvitamin E were changed from IU to a-tocopherol equivalents taking\ninto account the activity of not only a-tocopherol, but also g-\ntocopherol and d-tocopherol and tocotrienols. The 2000 Recommen-\nded Dietary Allowances and estimated average requirements (29) for\nvitamin E were based only on 2 R, 49 R, 89 R-(RRR)-a-tocopherol, the\nform found in food, and the 2R-stereoisomeric forms of a-tocopherol\nthat occur in fortified foods and supplements. The other tocopherols\nand tocotrienols do not contribute toward meeting the vitamin E\nrequirement (29). Vitamin E was represented as a-tocopherol equiv-\ndata files, a-tocopherol intake from diet and dietary supplements were\nsolely taken into consideration as vitamin E intake and expressed as mg\nof a-tocopherol.\nexpressed on the total amount of flavonoid intake regardless of the\nsubcategories of flavonoids consumed.

All statistical analyses were carried out with SAS\nsoftware, release 8.1, 2000 (SAS Institute) and the Survey Data Analysis\nfor multi-stage sample designs professional software package (SUDAAN,\nrelease 8.0.2, 2003, Research Triangle Institute). Sample weights were\napplied to all analyses to account for the unequal probability of selec-\ntion, noncoverage, and nonresponse bias resulting from oversampling\nof low-income persons, adolescents, the elderly, African-Americans, and\nMexican-Americans.\nArithmetic means of dietary total and individual antioxidant intake\nof subpopulations grouped by sociodemographic and lifestyle variables\nwere determined. SEM was calculated by the linearization (Taylor\nseries) variance estimation method for population parameters by\nSUDAAN. We used t tests and ANOVA to test for overall differences of\nantioxidant intakes from diet and supplements by sociodemographic\nand lifestyle variables such as gender, income, and smoking, etc. The\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ntrends of antioxidant intakes by the weight and frequency of specific\nfood groups consumed were tested using linear contrasts after\nadjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, PIR, current smoking status,\nand exercise level.

Only flavonoid intake from diet was used in the\nanalysis, because intake from was accounted for ,2% of the\ntotal in this study. After adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI,\nPIR, current smoking, and exercise level, fruit and fruit juice\nconsumption was positively associated with dietary and total\nintake of vitamin C, carotenes, vitamin E, and selenium (P ,\n0.05). Vegetable and vegetable product consumption was\npositively associated with dietary and total intakes of all\nindividual antioxidants (P , 0.001); wine consumption with\ntotal carotene and dietary flavonoid intake (P , 0.1); tea\nconsumption with total selenium intake (P , 0.05); and dietary\nflavonoid intake (P , 0.001) (Table 3). Participants' self-\nreported frequency of food group intake based on FFQ also\nshowed a consistent, but weaker association than the results\nobtained from weight-based food consumption data (Supple-\nmental Table 1).\nMajor dietary antioxidant sources. The major dietary sources\nfor the dietary vitamin C intake were: citrus fruit juices,\nfruitaides and drinks, and other vegetables; vitamin E: mixture\nmainly grain, fat, oil and dressing, and mixture mainly meat,\npoultry, fish; carotenes: deep-yellow vegetables, dark-green\nvegetables, and other vegetables; selenium: yeast breads, rolls,\nmixture mainly meat, poultry, fish, and mixture mainly grain;\nand total flavonoids: tea, citrus fruit juice, and beers and ales\n(Table 4). Mixtures mainly grain includes foods such as burritos,\ntacos, pizza, egg rolls, quiche, spaghetti with sauce, rice, and\npasta mixtures; frozen meals in which the main course is a grain\nmixture; noodle and rice soups; and baby-food macaroni and\nspaghetti mixtures. Citrus fruit juices were the major sources of\nvitamin C, contributing 23% of daily dietary vitamin C intake;\nvegetables were the major sources for carotene, contributing\n58% of daily dietary carotene intake; and teas were identified as\nthe most remarkable sources of flavonoids, contributing 77% of\ndaily flavonoid intake.\nDiscussion\nThe mean daily vitamin C intake in U.S. adults was 95.5 mg\nfrom diet only and 207.9 mg from both diet and supplement in\nthe present study, suggesting that supplements are a major\nsource for vitamin C intake in the US. Compared with our\nresults, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Trial\n(31) reported a higher mean vitamin C intake of 159.7 mg/d for\nmen who did not consume vitamin supplements compared with\na lower total vitamin C intake of 177.8 mg/d for male\nsupplement users. Data on supplement use in the Prostate,\nLung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Trial was, however,\nEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition\nStudy (32) reported that the mean daily intake of dietary vitamin\n(Greece), which is in accordance with our findings. Another\nEuropean study (33) reported that the mean daily vitamin C\nintake from diet in elderly adults in Spain was 125.4 mg for men\nand 136.3 mg for women. The dietary vitamin C intake of\nEuropeans is overall higher than that of the U.S. population\npresented in this study and the difference can be explained by the\nfact that fruit and vegetable intake in Europe on average is\nhigher compared with in the US (34).\nWe reported a dietary a-tocopherol intake of 7.1 mg/d in this\nstudy, which was a bit lower than that of the European\npopulation, ranging from 7.3 mg (Sweden) to 13.3 mg (France),\nin the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and\nNutrition Study (32). In the present study, vitamin E intake was\nsignificantly higher in nonsmokers (7.2 mg) than in smokers (6.9\nmg), which was slightly lower than, but in a good accordance\nwith, the previous study by the Minnesota Heart Survey (35).\nOur estimation of vitamin E intake might be underestimated,\nbecause in our study, only a-tocopherol intake was counted for\nthe estimation. The same study reported a mean b-carotene\n(32). Dietary flavonoid intake in our study (207 mg/d) was much\nhigher than previous reports (36,37). This is due to the fact that\nprevious studies were limited to a small number of flavonoids.\nDaily dietary selenium intake in this study (108.5 mg) was\nslightly lower than selenium intake reported in a Japanese study\nwomen in this study (89.2 mg) was in accordance with a previous\nselenium contents in foodstuffs depend on the soil for plant food\nitems, the feed for stockbreeding products, and the sea condi-\ntions for marine products (38). Therefore, the levels vary by\ndietary patterns, geographic regions, and agricultural practices.\nOur study found that individual and total antioxidant intake\nfrom diet and supplement differed among sociodemographic\nsubgroups. Energy-adjusted antioxidant intake from diet in-\ncreased with age, income, and exercise level (except for\nflavonoids) in agreement with previous studies (23,40). In\nhighest in men older than 60 y. As previously reported by our\nresearch group (23), flavonoid density of the diet increased with\nage, income, physical activity, Caucasian descent, female sex,\nand vitamin supplement use. In our study, smokers consumed\nless vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenes than nonsmokers. This\nis consistent with previous findings (35,41). Nevertheless, it\nraises a serious public health concern, because smokers are\nexposed to increased oxidative stress and have a higher demand\nfor antioxidant vitamins than nonsmokers.\nEnergy-adjusted antioxidant intake from supplement was\nhigher in women, older adults (except flavonoids), Caucasians,\nand those with higher exercise level (except flavonoids) and\nhigher income compared with their counterparts. These findings\nare in agreement with previous studies (42\u00ad44). Evaluating the\nNHANES III survey, Balluz et al. (42) reported that the use of\nsupplements was highest in women, non-Hispanic whites, and\nparticipants with the highest levels of education and income.\nLyle et al. (43) identified supplement users among 2152 middle-\nand older age adults in Wisconsin. They found women;\nparticipants with high levels of education, low BMI, and active\nlifestyles; and nonsmokers take more supplements than their\ncounterparts. Jasti et al. (44) reported that middle-aged or older\nwomen, Caucasians, those well-educated and with higher\nincome levels, and residents of western parts of the US were\nmore likely to use supplements than their counterparts.\nWe found that consumption of fruits, fruit juices, vegetables,\nand wine were positively associated with dietary and total\nantioxidant intake. Fruit, fruit juices, and vegetables have\npreviously been identified as major sources of antioxidant\nAntioxidant intake from the U.S. diet and supplements 321\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nvitamins (45,46). Wine consumption has been associated with\nhigher total carotene and dietary flavonoid intake in our study. It\nhas previously been reported that supplement users have a\nhigher intake of micronutrients from food, including vitamin C,\nvitamin E, and carotenoids, independent of antioxidant intake\nfrom supplements (43). This finding is similar to a previous study\nin that supplement users were identified to consume more wine\nWe identified the major food sources of dietary vitamin C in\nthe US as citrus fruit juice, fruitades, potatoes, tomatoes, and\nother vegetables. In agreement with our findings, Hampl et al.\n(45) reported the leading sources of vitamin C in the U.S. diet as\nfruits and fruit juices, vegetables, and vitamin C-fortified fruit\ndrinks. A Spanish study (46) found that fruits (mainly oranges),\ntomato, and sweet pepper were the major sources for vitamin C\nin the Spanish diet. According to our findings, dietary vitamin E\nin the US was mainly derived from grain, fat, oil, dressing, meat,\npoultry, fish, potatoes, nuts, and seeds. Our findings are\nconsistent with the reports by the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services and the USDA, who identified food items\nwith high amounts of vitamin E (47), except for potatoes, meat,\nand poultry. The latter 3 are most likely to contribute to vitamin\nE intake because of their high amount of consumption by U.S.\nadults. Major food sources of dietary vitamin E in Spain were\nvegetable oils (sunflower and olive), noncitrus fruits, nuts, and\nseeds (48). Our study found deep-yellow vegetables, dark green\nvegetables, and other vegetables were the major food source of\ncarotenes in the U.S. diet. This is in agreement with previous\nstudies (46,47). The antioxidant mineral selenium was mainly\nconsumed in yeast breads, grains, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs by\nU.S. adults. In agreement with our findings, a Japanese study\n(38) reported fish, shellfish, cereals, meat, and dairy products as\nthe major food sources for selenium. Dietary flavonoids were\nprimarily consumed in tea, followed by citrus fruit juice, beer,\nwine, and citrus fruits. Previous studies reported that onion is\nthe major source of flavonoids in the U.S. (36). and Japanese (11)\ndiets. However, these studies did not consider intake of tea\ncatechins, which have previously been shown to be major\ncontributors to total flavonoid intake by our group (23). In the\nZutphen elderly study, the major sources of flavonoid intake\nwere reported as tea, onion, and apple (37). In 2004, a research\ngroup found tea to be the major flavonoid source in the\nTABLE 3 Mean antioxidant intake of U.S. adults aged $19 y\nby food group consumed from one 24-h DR\nFruit and fruit juices\nVitamin C, mg/d\nVitamin E, mg/d a-tocopherol\nCarotenes, mg/d RAE\nSelenium, mg/d\nVegetables and vegetable products\nVitamin C, mg/d\nVitamin E, mg/d a-tocopherol\nCarotenes, mg/d RAE\nSelenium, mg/d\nWines\nVitamin C, mg/d\nVitamin E, mg/d a-tocopherol\nCarotenes, mg/d RAE\nSelenium, mg/d\nTeas\nVitamin C, mg/d\n(Continued)\nTABLE 3 Continued\nVitamin E, mg/d a-tocopherol\nCarotenes, mg/d RAE\nSelenium, mg/d\n1 Values are means 6 SD.\n2 All participants who did not consume the food in the 1-d, 24-h DR were grouped as\nnonconsumers and all consumers were divided into tertiles by the amount of\nconsumption.\n3 T1, T2, and T3 stand for the first, second, and 3rd tertile, respectively.\n4 P-values for linear trend, adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, PIR, smoking, and\nexercise level.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nAustralian diet, followed by orange (48). They also found that\nflavonoid sources varied among different age groups. In adults,\nred wine was a major catechin and epicatechin source, whereas\nin children it was apples, apricots, and grapes.\nOur findings are interpreted based on several assumptions:\nfirst, the USDA food composition databases were constructed\nbased on U.S. representative food samples, including varying\ncultivars, geographic origin, growing seasons, agricultural\npractices, and analytical methods. Second, this study focused\non antioxidant intake, not bioavailability and metabolism in the\nhuman body or changes during processing and food preparation.\nThird, dietary intake data were based on a 24-h DR that might\nbe a limitation of this study, because there is no scientific\nagreement on the minimum period of dietary data collection to\nobtain an approximation of usual intake for the antioxidants.\nHowever, despite within-person variability, a 24-h DR can\nproduce adequate estimates of mean intake of a group that can\nbe useful for contrasting the dietary status of the group with\ndifferent levels of risk factors for certain diseases (49).\nIn summary, the results of this study demonstrated that daily\nantioxidant intakes from diet and dietary supplements are\nsignificantly different in adult subgroups having different socio-\ndemographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors. In this study,\nwe focused on the documentation of the antioxidant intake levels\nbased on food composition tables; thus, further research is needed\nto study individual bioavailability, metabolism in the human\nbody, and changes during processing and food preparation.\nEstimated total antioxidant intake from both diets and\nsupplement is a prerequisite to investigating the implicated\nrelation between the antioxidant intake and the prevalence of\nchronic diseases within a population and its subgroups. To our\nknowledge, this was the first documentation on the antioxidant\nintake status of U.S. adults and subgroups on a large scale.\nHaving a reliable and valid assessment of dietary intake is the\nfirst step to establishing recommended dietary intakes that\npromote public health. The findings of this study will play a\npivotal role in promoting and protecting national health through\nconcerted efforts of policymakers, public health officers, nutri-\ntion and health educators in the government, the food and\nsupplement industry, and academia. Furthermore, the well-\ndocumented health disparity in the US may also be partially\nexplained by the marked differences in antioxidant intake\namong different socioeconomic subgroups.\n"
