    "abstract": "Abstract\nEndothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) are endogenous peptides that signal through Gaq/11-protein coupled receptors\n(GPCRs) to produce nociceptor sensitization and pain. Both peptides activate phospholipase C to stimulate Ca2\u00fe accumu-\nlation, diacylglycerol production, and protein kinase C activation and are rapidly desensitized via a G-protein receptor kinase\n2-dependent mechanism. However, ET-1 produces a greater response and longer lasting nocifensive behavior than BK in\nmultiple models, indicating a potentially divergent signaling mechanism in primary afferent sensory neurons. Using cultured\nsensory neurons, we demonstrate significant differences in both Ca2\u00fe influx and Ca2\u00fe release from intracellular stores\nfollowing ET-1 and BK treatments. As intracellular store depletion may contribute to the regulation of other signaling\ncascades downstream of GPCRs, we concentrated our investigation on store-operated Ca2\u00fe channels. Using pharmaco-\nlogical approaches, we identified transient receptor potential canonical channel 3 (TRPC3) as a dominant contributor to\nCa2\u00fe influx subsequent to ET-1 treatment. On the other hand, BK treatment stimulated Orai1 activation, with only minor\ninput from TRPC3. Taken together, data presented here suggest that ET-1 signaling targets TRPC3, generating a prolonged\nCa2\u00fe signal that perpetuates nocifensive responses. In contrast, Orai1 dominates as the downstream target of BK receptor\nactivation and results in transient intracellular Ca2\u00fe increases and abridged nocifensive responses.\n",

ET-1 was first isolated and described as\nsynthesized by multiple cell types. ET-1 signals through\ntwo Gaq-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), endothe-\nlin-A (ETA\nR), and endothelin-B (ETB\nR), which are\nexpressed in a tissue-dependent manner (Stephenson\nKhodorova et al., 2009). The affinities of the three iso-\nforms of endothelin (ET-1, -2, and -3) also differ for\nETA\nR and ETB\nR binds all three endothelin iso-\nforms with equal affinity, whereas ET-1 has high affinity\nfor ETA\nR over ETB\nET-3 has 100-fold lower affinity for ETA\nR than ETB\nR\n(Horinouchi et al., 2013). Both endothelin receptors are\ndesensitized through GPCR kinase type-2 (GRK-2)\ndependent mechanisms (Freedman et al., 1997), employing\n1Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Texas Health\nScience Center at San Antonio, TX, USA\n2Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at\nSan Antonio, TX, USA\n3Department of Physiology, University of Texas Health Science Center at\nSan Antonio, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNathaniel A.

Similar to ET-1,\nBK signals through two Gaq coupled receptors, BK type-\nR, respectively;\npredominantly through B2\nR, which is also the dominant\nisoform widely expressed in multiple tissue types under\nnormal physiological conditions (Calixto et al., 2004). On\nthe other hand, B1\nRs are usually not expressed under\nphysiological conditions but upregulated in response to\ninflammation and tissue injury (Calixto et al., 2004;\nBK has significantly higher affinity for B2\nR\nto ET receptors, B2\nR activation leads to receptor desen-\nsitization via GRK-2-dependent endocytosis (Blaukat\nfocused our studies with BK on the B2\nR system.\nBoth ET and BK receptors signal through Gaq/11\nprotein-coupled receptors that stimulate inositol 1,4,5-tri-\nsphosphate (IP3\n) and diacylglycerol (DAG) production\nvia activation of phospholipase C (PLC; Takigawa\nPetho and Reeh, 2012). Although additional Ga-subunit\nsignaling mechanisms have been linked to both BK (Gai;\nET (Gai; Shraga-Levine and Sokolovsky, 2000 and Gas;\nas the dominating target of BK and ET receptor activa-\ntion in peripheral neurons (Davenport, 2002; Leeb-\nLundberg et al., 2005). For this reason, we focused our\nstudies on calcium responses following activation of the\nclassical PLC pathway downstream from Gaq/11, even\nthough alternative pathways including protein kinase A,\nprotein kinase C, and several mitogen-activated protein\nkinases are also activated by Gaq/11-coupled processes.\nbinds to receptors expressed on endoplasmic reticu-\nlum (ER) to induce calcium release from intracellular\nstores. The subsequent decrease of Ca2\u00fe concentration\nin intracellular stores activates store-operated calcium\nentry (SOCE) channels, further increasing intracellular\ncalcium accumulation (Putney, 1986). Focused investiga-\ntions have since revealed molecular elements, stromal\ninteraction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 as important\nmodulators of SOCE function, as STIM1 serves as an\nact as pore-forming subunits (Prakriya et al., 2006). The\nsecond coiled-coil domain in the cytosolic C-terminus of\nSTIM1 interacts with and activates Orai1 following prior\nactivation of its Ca2\u00fe-sensing EF hand domain (Prakriya\nthe ER lumen falls below $300 mM, STIM1 oligomerizes,\ntranslocates, and interacts with Orai1 to activate SOCE\nchannels (Cahalan, 2009). STIM1 also regulates the activ-\nity of other calcium channels, including the transient\nreceptor potential canonical channel (TRPC) ion channel\nfamily, defining their function as SOC channels (Yuan\net al., 2007). Interestingly, both BK and ET regulate\nTRPC channel activities; ET-1 regulates TRPC3, 5, 6, 7\n(Horinouchi et al., 2011), whereas BK regulates TRPC1,\net al., 2011). Taking under consideration the expression\npattern of TRPC ion channels in both trigeminal ganglia\n(TG) and DRG sensory neurons (Alkhani et al., 2014),\ntheir function as SOCE channels and their existence as\ndownstream targets from Gaq/11-signaling (importantly\nTRPC3; Peppiatt-Wildman et al., 2007), we investigated\nfunctional coupling between TRPC3, Orai1 channels and\nET-1, and BK receptors in rat TG sensory neurons.\nHowever, spontaneous nociceptive behavioral measures\nwere conducted on hindpaw tissues innervated by DRG\nafferent neurons to reduce output ambiguity that occurs\nin tissues innervated by TG afferent neurons\n(Krzyzanowska and Avendano, 2012). TG neurons\nwere used as they provide more neurons/ganglia than\nthose isolated from dorsal root ganglia tissue, allowing\nus to reduce the number of animals used for this study.\nImportantly, sensory neurons from both the trigeminal\nand dorsal root ganglia yield similar expression patterns\nfor ET and BK receptors (Pomonis et al., 2001; Sugiura\nYamamoto et al., 2013). Here, we identify divergence in\ncalcium signals generated downstream from ETA\nR and\nR activation with respect to SOCE channels.\nMaterial and Methods\nReagents\nThe following reagents were used: ET-1 (Sigma Aldrich,\nSt. Louis, MO), BK (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),\nPyR3 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom),\n(Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom),\nKingdom).\nAnimals\nAll procedures utilizing animals were approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at\nSan Antonio and were conducted in accordance with\npolicies for the ethical treatment of animals established\nby the National Institute for Health. Male Sprague\nLaboratories, Wilmington, MA), were used for behavior\nanalyses and TG dissection.\n2 ASN Neuro\nCell Culture\nTG neurons were cultured as previously described (Jeske\net al., 2006). In short, TG were bilaterally removed from\nmale Sprague Dawley rats, placed in ice-cold Hanks'\nbalanced salt solution (HBBS) medium and washed\ntwice with HBBS. TGs were dissociated by simultaneous\ncollagenase and dispase treatment and gentle trituration\nwere washed twice to remove the digestive enzymes and\nplaced on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated cover slips\n(Corning, Bedford, MA) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle\nMedium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,\n1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 100 ng/ml\nnerve growth factor. Cultures were maintained at 37\n, and grown for 1 to 2 days for calcium\nimaging experiments.\nNucleofection\nFor single-cell PLC activity experiments, TG neurons\nwere nucleofected with 2 mg of GFP-PLCq-PH (a kind\ngift from Nikita Gamper University of Leeds, UK;\nGamper et al., 2004) according to manufacturer recom-\nmendations (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) prior to cover slip\nplacement. Experiments were performed 2 days after\nprocedure.\nMeasurements of Inositol Phosphate Accumulation\nET-1- and BK-stimulated inositol monophosphate (IP)\naccumulation in primary sensory neuronal cultures was\nmeasured as previously described (Rowan et al., 2014).\nNeuronal cultures grown in 96-well plates were labeled\nwith 2 mCi/ml [3H]myoinositol for 24 hr before experi-\nments. After labeling cells were washed three times with\npiperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and were prein-\ncubated in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 20 mM\nLiCl for 15 min at 37 C in room air. Cells were incubated\nwith various concentrations of ET-1 and BK (25 min,\n37 C) and reactions were terminated by the addition of\nice-cold formic acid. Total [3H]IPs were separated by ion\nexchange chromatography and measured by liquid scin-\ntillation spectrometry. Data are expressed as a percentage\nincrease above basal IP accumulation.\nCalcium Imaging\nTo measure single-cell intracellular Ca2\u00fe levels, the dye\nFura-2 AM (2 mM; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was\nincubated with cultured neurons for 30 min at 37 C in\nthe presence of 0.05% Pluronic (Calbiochem/EMD\nBiosciences, Gibbstown, NJ). Fluorescence was detected\nwith a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope fitted with a 20\u00c2/\n0.8 NA Fluor objective. Fluorescence images from\nand analyzed with MetaFluor Software (MetaMorph,\nWeb Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown,\nPA). All Ca2\u00fe measurements were performed at RT. To\nasses single-cell Ca2\u00feresponses after ET-1 or BK stimu-\nlation, cells were continuously perfused with standard\nextracellular solution (SES) that contained (in mM) 140\nglucose. After 60 s baseline was established 100 nM of\nET-1 or BK was applied and net changes in Ca2\u00fe were\ncalculated. In recordings where cells underwent double\ntreatment with ET-1 and BK, neurons were washed for\n5 min with SES. To assess SOCE stimulated by ET-1 or\nBK, cultured neurons were perfused with Ca2\u00fe free buffer\nafter baseline was established, ET-1 (100 nM) or BK\nwashout, 2 mM Ca2\u00fe was introduced to the extracellular\nenvironment. Ratiometric data were converted to [Ca2\u00fe]i\nby using the equation [Ca2\u00fe]i\n\u00bc K[(R \u00c0 Rmin\n)/(Rmax\n\u00c0\nR)]. Values of K, Rmin\n, and Rmax\nare determined with use\nof calibration kit (Invitrogen, Oregon). Data collected\nwith calibration kit allow generation of a standard\ncurve, which can then be used to convert fura-2 fluores-\ncence measurements obtained from experimental samples\ninto estimates of free Ca2\u00fe concentration. The plot of the\nlog of [Ca2\u00fe]\nfree\n(x-axis) versus the log of {[(R \u00c0 Rmin\n)/\n(Rmax\n\u00c0 R)]} yields a straight line, the x-intercept of\nwhich is the log of K. R is the ratio of 510 nm emission\nintensity with excitation at 380 nm; Rmin\nis the ratio at\nzero free Ca2\u00fe; Rmax\nis the ratio at saturating Ca2\u00fe.\nAnimal Behavior\nAll injections were given intraplantarly in 25 ml volumes\nvia 28-gauge needle inserted through the lateral footpad\njust under the skin to minimalize tissue damage. Drugs\nstocks were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)\nor PBS 2% Tween20. After injection (Time 0), animals\nwere freely moving, on a flat surface enclosed by Plexiglas\ncage. Nocifensive behavior was defined as hindpaw\nflinching, lifting, and licking. Animals were observed for\n40 min and behavior was quantified every 5 min.\nData Analysis\nFor detail statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism 4.0 soft-\nware was used (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego,\nCA). Data were given as mean \u00c6 standard error of the\nmean (Haasemann et al., 1998), with the value of n refer-\nring to the number of analyzed cells per group.\nConcentration\u00adresponse data for ET-1 - and\nSzteyn et al. 3\nBK-mediated IP accumulation were fit to a logistic equa-\ntion using nonlinear regression analysis to provide esti-\nmates of maximal response (Emax\n)\nusing Prism software. The significant difference between\ngroups was assessed by one-way and two-way analysis of\nvariance (Pechanova and Simko, 2007), with Bonferroni\npost hoc correction as required. Two conditions were\ncompared using paired or unpaired t-test. A difference\nwas accepted as significant if p < .05, p < .01, or\np < .001, marked *, **, and ***, respectively. NS \u00bc not\nsignificant.\nResults\nET-1 and BK Cause Nocifensive Behavior in Rats\nInflammatory mediators induce nocifensive behaviors in\nmultiple behavioral models (Gokin et al., 2001;\nKhodorova et al., 2002). Here, we aimed to directly com-\npare the time frames of nocifensive behavior (flinching,\nlicking, and lifting of injected paw) following intraplantar\n25 ml), or vehicle (PBS, 25 ml). As illustrated in Figure 1,\nstatistical comparisons of blinded observations following\nintraplantar injection of ET-1 or BK into the hindpaw\nrevealed significant differences at differential time points.\nFollowing BK administration, rat nocifensive behavior\npeaked 5 min after injection, while ET-1 injection pro-\nduced similar nocifensive behavior, but not until 30-min\npostinjection. As both of these inflammatory mediators\nsignal through similar Gaq-coupled mechanisms, our\nstudy progressed along the signaling pathway to investi-\ngate sensory neuronal Ca2\u00fe accumulation.\nSingle-Cell Ca2\u00feResponses Triggered by ET-1 and\nBK in TG Neurons\nWe next decided to characterize single-cell Ca2\u00fe\nresponses triggered by ET-1 and BK by real-time Ca2\u00fe\nimaging, starting with physiological extracellular solution\ncontaining 2 mM Ca2\u00fe (Figure 2(a) and (d)) Under those\nconditions, ET-1 treatment effected in significantly higher\nincrease in intracellular Ca2\u00fe concentration when com-\npared with BK (Figure 2(d)). In following set of meas-\nurements, we used protocol that was designed to isolate\nCa2\u00fe entry due to SOC channels activity. After baseline\nin Ca2\u00fe free solution was established, cells were treated\nin intracellular calcium concentration were analyzed. ET-\n1 triggered significantly higher calcium release from intra-\ncellular stores when compared with BK-induced\nresponses (Figure 2(c) and (e)). After cells had time to\nrecover from ET-1 or BK stimulation, we exchanged\nextracellular solution from Ca2\u00fe free solution to one con-\ntaining 2 mM Ca2\u00fe, observed intracellular Ca2\u00fe increase\nwas due to activity of SOC channels. Data summarized in\nFigure 2(f) showed that ET-1-induced Ca2\u00fe depletion\ncaused significantly higher SOC channels activation\nthan that caused by BK. We were also interested in the\nfrequency of coexpression of ETA\nR in TG neu-\nrons. To that end, after we established the baseline, we\ntreated cells with ET-1 and after 5 min of recovery, the\nsame cells were treated with BK and the frequency of\nevents is illustrated in Figure 2(b); 20.8% of cells that\nresponded to ET-1 also responded to BK stimulation.\nOn the other hand, 74.1% of cells that showed sensitivity\nto BK treatment also showed response to ET-1.\nET-1 and BK Activation of PLC in Population and\nSingle-Cell Measurements\nTo examine possible mechanisms that would explain the\nvariability in calcium accumulation following ET-1 and\nBK treatment of sensory neurons, we focused on PLC\nactivation, as it is the first molecular reaction that takes\nplace after activation of ETA\nR. IP is one metab-\nolite that accumulates in the presence of LiCl after\nhydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate\n) and is broadly used as an index of PLC enzymatic\nactivity (Rowan et al., 2014). When IP accumulation was\nmeasured in sensory neuron cultures after treatment with\nET-1 or BK, significant differences between maximal\nresponses of the agonists were observed (Figure 3(a)).\nHowever, given that sensory neuron cultures are hetero-\ngeneous and significant differences observed could be due\nFigure 1.

Number of hindpaw\nflinches, lifts, and licks were counted and reported at two time\npoints after injection, 5 min and 30 min. Statistical significance was\nassessed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, n \u00bc 6\u00ad9,\nkinin; PBS \u00bc phosphate buffered saline; ANOVA \u00bc analysis of\nvariance.\n4 ASN Neuro\nto high expression of ETA\nR in non-neuronal cells, we\nanalyzed PLC activity on a single-cell level (Gamper\net al., 2004). To this end, we nucleofected cultured sen-\nsory neurons with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged\nPLCq pleckstrin homology domain cDNA, which trans-\nlocates to the cytosol from the plasma membrane follow-\ning activation of PLC and subsequent PIP2\nhydrolysis.\nWhen PLC activation was compared in cells stimulated\nwith ET-1 or BK, no significant differences were observed\n(Figure 3(b) to (c)), suggesting that on a single-cell level,\nET-1 and BK activate PLC similarly. To further investi-\ngate a potential role for PLC in sensory neuronal\nSOCE, we measured real-time calcium accumulation in\nFigure 3(d)). Under this condition, neither ET-1 nor\nBK was able to generate notable SOCE, indicating that\nactivation of PLC is necessary for ET-1- and BK-\nmediated SOCE in cultured sensory neurons.\nIon Channels That Contribute to SOCE in TG\nNeurons\nPrevious studies indicate similar expression patterns of\nETA\nR in primary nociceptors (Gemes et al.,\nactivate SOCE, due to PLC-dependent IP3\nproduction\nfollowing receptor activation (Figure 2, Putney, 2011;\nTykocki et al., 2014).

SOCE triggered by ET-1 was\ndecreased by 74% when PyR3 (TRPC3 blocker) was pre-\nsent (Figure 4(a) and (b)), whereas, Gd3\u00fe (Orai1 blocker)\ncaused a 33% decrease in calcium response (Figure 4(a)\nand (b)).

Intraplantar\ninto the hindpaw was followed by 10 nM (25 ml) injection\nof ET-1 or BK 5 min later. Inhibition of Orai1 with Gd3\u00fe\nresulted in a significant increase in ET-1-triggered noci-\nfensive behavior through the first 25 min of observation\n(Figure 5). PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3 prior to ET-1\nadministration resulted in a leftward shift in the time\ncourse of response, inducing an earlier onset of nocicep-\ntive responses; however, the magnitude of response was\nunchanged. As for BK-induced nocifensive behavior,\nOrai1 inhibition did not change the maximal response;\nhowever, the recovery time was prolonged when com-\npared with BK alone. Furthermore, TRPC3 inhibition\nby PyR3 significantly decreased peak BK nocifensive\nbehavior at the 5-min time point, suggesting that activa-\ntion of TRPC3 contributes to BK-mediated nocifensive\nresponses.\nDiscussion\nSensory neurons, especially slow conducting C-type\nfibers, can remain in quiescent states for long periods of\ntime (Schmidt et al., 1995). During that time, inactivity of\nvoltage gated Ca2\u00fe channels and continuous membrane\nCa2\u00feATPase activity could deplete intracellular Ca2\u00fe\nstores. However compensatory SOCE mechanisms pre-\nvent store depletion and support cellular viability\nfew published studies have addressed the role(s) of\nSOCE in sensory neurons. These earlier works identify\nthat extracellular Ca2\u00fe is required to maintain calcium\nhomeostasis in resting neurons, as they show decreased\nCa2\u00fe levels within minutes after placement in Ca2\u00fe-free\nFigure 4.

Furthermore, negative manipulations of\nSOCE can deplete intracellular stores, contributing to\npathological conditions following neuropathy (Rigaud\net al., 2009). However, inflammatory GPCR activation\ncan also cause store depletion following acute injury,\nalthough mediators that activate the same receptor sig-\nnaling mechanisms often yield differential cellular results.\nIn the present study, we investigated the differential\nsensory neuron activation profiles for the inflammatory\nmediators ET-1 and BK. Both mediators signal through\nGaq/11 protein-coupled pathways, activate PLC, stimu-\nlate increased intracellular Ca2\u00fe accumulation, and\nundergo rapid GRK2-dependent desensitization\net al., 1998). However, we report differential nociceptive\nbehavior patterns and calcium accumulation indices fol-\nlowing either ET-1 or BK administration. To address\nthis, we examined SOCE channels farther downstream\nfrom receptor activation and discovered a unique path-\nway association between ET-1 and TRPC3 separate from\na more balanced pathway linking B2\nR activation to both\nTRPC3 and Orai1. This differential pathway association\nis especially unique, given the similarities between the\nreceptors activated and their immediate downstream\ntargets.\nIn many cell types, BK stimulates transient increases in\nintracellular Ca2\u00fe, only to return to baseline within min-\nutes following treatment (Pinheiro et al., 2013). In con-\ntrast, ET-1 stimulates transient increases in free\nCa2\u00feconcentration in aortic smooth muscle, and elevated\nCa2\u00fe levels can be maintained for up to 60 min (Miwa\net al., 1999). Results presented here demonstrate clear\nparallels between nocifensive behavior time course and\ncalcium accumulation. BK induced a short-lived\nCa2\u00fesignal that translates into quickly resolved\nFigure 5. Nocifensive behavior in rats after administration of ET\n-1 or BK.

In contrast, ET-1 fos-\ntered a prolonged Ca2\u00feelevation that contributes to\nextended nocifensive behavior (Figure 1). These observa-\ntions, combined with previous knowledge about signal\ntransduction pathway downstream of ETA\nR,\nsuggest that second messenger pathway(s) bifurcate to\ncontribute to divergent responses. At the beginning of\nour investigation, we established that in single-cell meas-\nurements, both ET-1 and BK stimulation activate PLC to\nthe same degree (Figure 3(b) and (c)) and mobilize Ca2\u00fe\nfrom intracellular stores (Figure 2(c) and (e)). However, a\nconsequence of store depletion is the activation of various\nSOCE channels. Therefore, we investigated SOCE chan-\nnels activated by ET-1 and BK to clarify observed\ndiscrepancies.\nOrai1 and TRPC3 are among many SOCE channels\nthat assist in intracellular Ca2\u00fe homeostasis, and both are\nexpressed and have been characterized in sensory neurons\navailable pharmacological antagonists of these channels\nwere used to determine the roles of each in mediating the\ndifferential effects of ET-1 and BK. Results presented\nhere demonstrate that ET-1 predominantly activates\nTRPC3, which contributes to 73% of ET-1-induced\nSOCE (Figure 4(d)). In contrast, BK-triggered SOCE is\nsignificantly more balanced between Orai1 and TRPC3,\nwith slight preference toward Orai1 involvement (58%,\nFigure 4(c)). This variability in ion channel activation\nresulted in significant differences in the length and size\nof the Ca2\u00fe signal. Importantly, this divergence in\nSOCE activation profiles could contribute to the differ-\nential nocifensive behaviors caused by ET-1 and BK. To\nfurther examine the roles of Orai1 and TRPC3 in ET-1 -\nand BK-induced behavior, we employed the same\npharmacological inhibitors in our nocifensive behavior\nmodel.\nSOCE antagonist results establish parallels between\nthe functional coupling of Orai1 and TRPC3 channels\nin single-cell responses and nocifensive behavior. Orai1\nsuppression of neuronal excitability would explain signifi-\ncantly prolonged recovery time after BK injection in rats\nthat were pretreated with the Orai1 blocker, Gd3\u00fe\n(Figure 5(b)). Furthermore, PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3\nsignificantly reduced BK-induced peak nocifensive\nbehavior. This finding agrees with the robust BK-induced\ninflammatory response observed by ourselves (Figure 1)\nand others (Petho and Reeh, 2012). However, neither of\nthe SOCE antagonists reduced peak ET-1 nocifensive\nbehavior, and in both instances, affected the time-to-\npeak response ratio. Both PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3\nand Gd3\u00fe inhibition of Orai1 reduced the time\nrequired for ET-1 administration to reach peak nocifen-\nsive behavior. These results may simply be due to the\nquick behavioral response of BK versus the slower\nresponse time for ET-1or may involve additional under-\nlying factors.\nIt has been reported that TRPC3 plays vital role in\nDRG neurons sensitization triggered by exposure to\ninflammatory mediators (Alkhani et al., 2014). This\nmay explain why the ET-1 signal, which is very strongly\nbiased toward TRPC3 activation, resulted in prolonged\nnocifensive responses. Also, TRPC3 inhibition would\nalter this behavior through decreased sensitization, result-\ning in reduced nocifensive action. Further modification of\nrat behavior was observed when Orai1 was inhibited\nprior to ET-1 injection. Interestingly, Orai1 activity has\nbeen shown to suppress neuronal excitability, while inhib-\nition increases neuronal burst firing (Gemes et al., 2011).\nHere, this mechanism would explain the increased noci-\nfensive responses in animals pretreated with the\nOrai1 inhibitor Gd3\u00fe prior to ET-1 administration\n(Figure 5(a)). Indeed, as ETA\nR downstream signaling tar-\ngets Orai1 to a smaller degree than TRPC3, the shift in\nnocifensive behavior response time shift could be\naffected. Importantly, TRPC3 inhibition produced\ngreater changes in nocifensive behavior, similar to\nsingle-cell studies. Despite the lack of mirrored results\nbetween single-cell studies and nociceptive behavior,\nFigure 6.

In contrast, BK triggers short-lived transient\nincreases in intracellular Ca2\u00fe through dominant activa-\ntion of Orai1, contributing to a rapid, but abbreviated\nonset of nocifensive behavior. Further studies into this\ndivergent signaling behavior could prove important to\nalleviating acute hyperalgesia.\nSummary\nEndothelin and bradykinin are inflammatory mediators\nthat bind to receptors on sensory neurons to stimulate\nvarious molecular pathways. In this investigation, we\nidentified store-operated ion channels Orai1 and\nTRPC3 contribute to endothelin/bradykinin effects\nin vitro and in vivo.\n"
