Yet that belief, although not entirely wrong, is\ninaccurate. So, here in this short, tutorial-like note we wish to disentangle dioptric blur,\ncaused by myopia or mis-accommodation, from blur by low-pass filtering including\nconvolution with a Gaussian kernel. Perhaps surprisingly--if well known in\noptometry--the blur kernel (or point-spread function [PSF]) for dioptric blur is (to a good\napproximation and disregarding diffraction) simply a cylindrical disk. Its projection onto the\nretina is classically referred to as a blur circle (see Figure 2(a) which is discussed later), the\ndiameter of which can be easily deduced from a light-ray model. The derivation is given later,\nwhere we further derive the relationship between the blur-disk's diameter and the extent of\nblur in diopters, and the diameter's relation to the near or the far point. Finally, we explore\nthe relationship of defocus to visual acuity based on an empirical approach by Blendowske\n(2015). Note from the outset that we only consider defocus here, not blur in general. The\nactual PSF is a superposition of the PSF from defocus with the PSFs from diffraction,\nastigmatism, higher order aberrations--which all depend on pupil diameter--and the\nidealized, needle-like PSF. It looks, in particular at low levels of mis-accommodation, very\ndifferent from a cylinder. Examples, for 200 eyes, are shown in Watson (2015, p. 15), based\non Thibos, Hong, Bradley, and Cheng (2002).\nThe role of the blur disk for blur, myopia, and accommodation has long been known.\nJurin (1738) uses it in his Essay on distinct and indistinct vision when he describes ways to\ndegrade the retinal image, from perfectly distinct (meaning perfectly in focus) to imperfectly\ndistinct, meaning somewhat out of focus but perceptually still appearing as distinct. One of\nthe methods used by Jurin was simply to bring the stimulus closer to the eye than\naccommodation would allow, such that the retinal image is out of focus.1 Figure 1 is an\nexample from Jurin's essay where the observer looks at a ring stimulus, fixating a point (c) on\nthe ring's outer circumference. The pencil of rays emanating from that point will be dissipated\ninto a circle of dissipation (Jurin's term for the blur disk), drawn, in the figure, into the\nstimulus (Jurin, 1738; Figure 2; here Figure 1).2 Jurin performs calculations with the radius\nof dissipation; he argues, for example, that the penumbra in a certain example has twice the\nthickness of the radius, and he describes how to measure the radius on that basis\nFigure 1. (a) Example of a circle of dissipation from insufficient accommodation in Jurin (1738, Figure 2).\nThe circle, with center c, originates at the border of a ring stimulus with center C. (b) Jurin was aware of the\neye's basic anatomy, as shown by his sketch of the eye (Jurin, 1738, Figure 51).\nperceptually.3,4 He does not actually derive the size of the radius, however, even though he is\naware of the role of the pupil size and lens curvature. Jurin had a good understanding of the\nTo set dioptric blur apart from other kinds of blur, Figure 2 shows several types of a PSF5\nthat underlie various kinds of blur. The cylindrical PSF in Figure 2(a) is a simplified version\nof what happens optically; the exponential in Figure 2(b) is an illustration of a two-\ndimensional (2D) low-pass analog to the simplest low-pass filter in the time domain (it has\nno natural counterpart in 2D); and the Gaussian in Figure 2(c) is typically used for modeling\nlow-pass filtering in the neural pathway, or, respectively, a difference of Gaussians for\nSpurious Resolution\nThe importance of choosing the proper type of blur becomes obvious when considering\nspurious resolution. This is a phenomenon long known in optical instrumentation\n(Hotchkiss, Washer, & Rosberry, 1951; Smith, 1982b); it may be illustrated by applying\ndioptric blur to a frequency sweep pattern, like the one in Figure 3(a), where spatial\nfrequency increases from left to right. For a given defocus, grating contrast first decreases\nwith increasing spatial frequency (as expected) reaching zero contrast at a certain spatial\nfrequency (Figure 3(b)). With spatial frequency increasing further, however, the grating\nbecomes visible again albeit with inverted phase. This is followed by another zero-crossing\nof contrast, followed by another spatial frequency interval with nonzero contrast and the\noriginal phase preserved. Such alternation of reversed and preserved phase continues up to\nthe cut-off frequency of the optical system. Consequently, high spatial frequencies are\ndetectable under dioptric blur, both psychophysically and when used as a stimulus for\nobjective acuity testing (Bach, Waltenspiel, & Schildwa\n\u00a8 th, &\nBach, 2015; Smith, 1982b). This is the case even when the PSF is much wider than the\nperiod of the grating. High-acuity results, obtained with periodic patterns like sine-wave\ngratings, must thus not be taken at face value. Gaussian blur, in contrast, cannot evoke\nspurious resolution because the Fourier transform of a Gaussian remains a Gaussian and\nis always positive.\nDioptric blur is not unique in its ability to induce spurious resolution (Harding, 1977;\nKoenderink, 1984); Gaussian blur, however, is unique in avoiding spurious resolution\n(Koenderink, 1984). It is also obvious that the effect is not limited to gratings as in\nFigure 2. Various point-spread functions (PSFs) that lead to blur. (a) Slightly simplified PSF for defocus\nresulting from inaccurate accommodation or myopia. Note that the actual PSF on the retina is a superposition\nof that with influences from other factors. (b) PSF for a 2D low-pass filter in analogy to a first-order time-\ndomain low pass. (c) A Gaussian PSF.\nStrasburger et al. 3\nFigure 3(a), and related phenomena even occur with nonperiodic stimulus types, such as\noptotypes (Figure 4; see also Thorn & Schwartz, 1990; Wolf & Angerstein, 1978). The likely\ndifference, however, between the effect on gratings (measuring resolution acuity) and the\neffect on optotypes (measuring recognition acuity; Heinrich & Bach, 2013; Strasburger &\nRentschler, 1996) appears to be that, while the orientation of the grating can still be judged\nunder the regimen of spurious resolution, the observer cannot make sense of the patchy\nimage of the optotype that results from the phase shifts associated with spurious\nresolution (Bach et al., 1989; cf. Yellott & Yellott, 2007). However, there may be enough\ninformation left in the dioptrically blurred letter stimuli to allow for differentiation between\nletters after sufficient practice (Heinrich, Kru\n\u00a8 ger, & Bach, 2011). The role of spurious\nresolution in reading is not yet clear (Chung, Jarvis, & Cheung, 2007). To avoid spurious\nresolution, artificial pupils with Gaussian aperture have been proposed (Fry, 1953).\nThe above points illustrate that the choice of the proper blur kernel is of practical relevance\nwhen dioptric blur-related vision impairments are considered. The considerable qualitative\ndifference between blur obtained with different blur kernels, as illustrated in Figure 4, also\ndemonstrates the limitations of those approaches that attempt to combine multiple sources of\nblur into one equivalent Gaussian blur kernel (e.g., Coppens & van den Berg, 2004).\nMore generally, different visual impairments are associated with different kinds of image\ndegradation. Myopia is closely related to dioptric blur. Cataract, on the other hand, involves\ne\nc\nn\na\nn\ni\nm\nu\nL\nSpace\nin phase reversed phase in phase\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.

Amblyopic vision,\nalthough appearing blurred to the subject, is not validly simulated by blur kernels altogether,\nas it appears to be associated with perceptual distortions and image fragmentation (Piano, Bex,\n\u00a8 umer, Sa\n` ze, &\nConstantinescu, 1993). This is the likely reason why there is a dissociation in amblyopia\nbetween optotype acuity and grating acuity (or pattern acuity), both as measured\npsychophysically (Bach, Strahl, Waltenspiel, & Kommerell, 1990; Friendly, Jaafar, & Morillo,\npattern VEPs (Heinrich, Bock, & Bach, 2016; Wenner, Heinrich, Beisse, Fuchs, & Bach, 2014).\nr\nu\nl\nb\nn\na\ni\ns\ns\nu\na\nG s\nu\nl\nu\nm\ni\nt\ns\nl\na\nn\ni\ng\ni\nr\nO\ns\nu\nc\no\nf\ne\nD\ns\ns\na\np\n-\nw\no\nl\n\"\nr\ne\nd\nr\no\n-\nt\ns\nr\ni\nF\n\"\nDefocus\nGauss\n\"First-order\"\nlow-pass\nFigure 4.

As Yellott and Yellott (2007) illustrate, the answer to\nthat depends, to a large degree, on the relative effects of defocus and diffraction, with the\nlatter being related to pupil size. Various higher order aberrations (see, for instance,\nSchaeffel, 2006) and the Stiles-Crawford effect (Stiles & Crawford, 1933) may also come\ninto play. However, as Artal (2014) points out, in eyes with normal optics, the amount of\nhigher order aberrations and visual acuity are not related; it may even be that the normal\npattern of aberrations provides the best performance (Artal et al., 2004). Defocus is further\nthe main source of degradation in the retinal images in most persons; the relative impact of\naberrations on image quality is comparable only for amounts of defocus below 0.25 D (Artal,\nEquations that relate the blur-disk diameter to defocus like the one given below have been\nderived or cited earlier (Smith, 1982a, Equations (10) and (15); Dehnert, Bach, & Heinrich,\nFigure 5, we present an intuitive approach, slightly different to that in, for example, Smith,\nBlur-Disk Diameter and Pupil Diameter\nUnlike the case for the Gaussian, the dioptric blur-disk's diameter is reasonably well defined\nsince the luminance-times-blur-disk volume is (approximately) cylindrical (Figure 2(a)).\nUnder a few simplifying assumptions its diameter depends--in a surprisingly\nstraightforward way--on defocus and pupil diameter: The blur-disk diameter b, in\ndegrees of visual angle, is (as will be derived later) given by\nb \u00bc\n\nb\np\nf df\nN\nP\nFigure 5.

The equation allows\nstraightforward calculation of the blur kernel. This is well known (Atchison & Smith, 2000,\nFigure 5 shows the enveloping rays from a far-away point source in a myopic eye, that is,\nan eye in which the focus lies before the retina (by a distance df ).

The ratio of these two\ndP\n=dN\nSince we assume paraxial approximations (i.e., small angles and thus tan ' \u00bc ') we have,\nby definition,\nbrad\n\u00bc\nb\ndN\n\u00bc\nb\ndP\nn \u00bc\nb\nf \u00fe df\nInserting Equation (4),\nbrad \u00bc \u00c0p\ndf\nf\nn\nf \u00fe df\nStrasburger et al. 7\nand Equation (2a), we arrive at\nbrad\nThis is almost the desired equation except that the pupil diameter refers to a size within the\neye which is not readily available. The size p of the pupil as seen from the outside, called the\nentrance pupil, is slightly larger than the actual size, since the physical pupil is seen through\nthe cornea, that is, through a magnifying lens. However, since the lens is close to the nodal\npoint, the enlargement is small and we will neglect it here. Thus, the size of the blur disk on\nthe retina, in radians, is given to a good approximation by the above equation (Equation 8),\nwhere p is the size of the entrance pupil, that is, the size as seen from the outside, and D is\ndefocus in the air. It is a linear relationship between angular blur-disk diameter and defocus,\nwith the slope given by the pupil diameter.\nOften, we are in a situation where we do not know the accommodation error in diopters\nbut do know by how much an image is too near or too far from the eye. Following James\nJurin's example, find your personal near point and then, gradually, move the object closer.\nOr, if you are myopic, take off your glasses and move the object a little farther away than\nyour far point. The image (from the well-focused case) will then, effectively, be convolved by\na blur disk, the linear size bstim\nof which is given by\nbstim \u00bc p\ndfoc \u00c0 dstim\ndstim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere p, as before, is effective pupil diameter, dfoc\nis the distance of the focal plane (e.g., the\nnear point), and dstim\nis the distance of the stimulus. Like Equation (3), this follows directly\nfrom the Intercept Theorem (similar triangles), now applied, however, to the exterior space\nExamples\nFigure 6 shows the linear relationship of Equation (1) (or, with rescaling, of Equation (8)) for\na quick look at what blur-disk diameter to expect at a certain defocus for an adult subject.\nWorkplace progressive addition lenses, for example, with half a diopter undercorrection for\nfar vision, would thus give a blur disk of approximately 0.1 \u00bc 60 visual angle, disregarding\nother factors. Note that with less than about \u00bc D defocus, factors other than defocus become\nmore prominent in determining blur (Artal, 2014).\nAs a further example, let us consider the near point for an observer with a natural\nlens--the closest distance for an object to appear in focus with a given accommodation\ncapability (Figure 7). With proper accommodation, no dioptric blur occurs; this results in\nconstant acuity as long as distance is large enough to be within the range of accommodation.\nThat acuity along the blue segment is referred to as the distance acuity, here set to a value\nequivalent to the acuity achieved with a blur circle of 1 arcmin diameter. Proximal to the limit\nof accommodation, dioptric blur increases and degrades acuity (solid red line). When the near\npoint is determined by deciding when the approaching target starts appearing blurred, the\njust-noticeable difference in blur (indicated by gray shading above the blue line) results in a\nsmall additional shift in the subjective near point. The dashed red line represents the blur-\ncircle diameter in the case of a fixed focal length, for example in a person with a monofocal\nintraocular lens, assumed to be in-focus at 50 cm. This also approximates the situation when\nwearing single-vision reading glasses in advanced presbyopia with little or no residual\nBlur circle diameter [log arcmin]\nDistance [m]\nAccommodation demand [D]\nDistance acuity\nFigure 7.

Moving along the solid blue\ntrajectory in the graph from right to left corresponds to an approaching target. With proper accommodation,\nno dioptric blur occurs (blue line); acuity in this condition would be referred to as the distance acuity.\nProximal to the limit of accommodation (here assumed to be at 2D as in a typical 50-year-old emmetropic\nobserver), dioptric blur increases and degrades acuity (solid red line). The dashed red line represents the\nblur-circle diameter in the case of a fixed focal length, as in a person with a monofocal intraocular lens,\nassumed to be in-focus at 50 cm.\nDefocus (D)\nBlur Disk Diameter (\u00b0)\nFigure 6.

Computations were performed for a pupil size of 5 mm. In reality, the\ntransition between distance acuity and blur-affected near acuity is less abrupt than\ndepicted, as the switch between the two operating ranges is not sudden.\nVisual Acuity and Defocus\nLet us finally turn to a question that will quickly arise in the context of blur: How is acuity\naffected by defocus? Acuity will obviously be best when blur is minimal (see Artal, 2014, for a\nqualification of that assertion), so a better question is how much is acuity reduced by defocus?\nLet vbc\ndenote the visual decimal acuity achieved with the best correction in place, and v the\nacuity with blur present. We are then seeking how the degradation factor v/vbc\ndepends on\ndefocus, that is, on the spherical error, which we have called D above. Here, Blendowske\n(2015) has derived a surprisingly simple empirical relationship for the reduction of acuity:\nv=vbc\n\u00bc\nwhere v/vbc\nis visual acuity (decimal or Snellen fraction) relative to the best-corrected case,\nand D is the spherical error in diopters (Figure 8). Blendowske's equation (which in his\npublication also includes cylindrical refractive errors which we omit here) was inspired by\nRaasch (1995), who had fit a second-order polynomial to a large set of empirical data with\nnatural pupil sizes, relating acuity to (spherical and cylindrical) refractive error. Blendowske\nextended that data set to include even more published data, in particular data for small\nrefractive errors, again with natural pupils of diameters in the range from 2 to 5 mm.\nIt turned out that, by estimating relative rather than absolute acuity, Blendowske obtained\nhis much simpler Equation (10), which (unlike Raasch's equation or the Equations (1) or (8)\nabove) also works well for low refractive errors, down to zero diopters. Note that the\nDefocus (D)\nRelative acuity, vrel\n= v / vbc\nFigure 8. Effect of defocus on relative acuity, according to Blendowske's (2015) empirical model,\nVrel\n\u00bc V/Vbc\nequation is based on empirical data, not on physical modeling, and thus naturally includes\nthe influences of higher order aberrations and diffraction. Note further that pupil size,\nalthough it influences acuity, does not appear in the equation. Nevertheless, the fit to the\ndata is very good, also at small values of D, with a regression standard error of 0.046 log\nunits; residual error mostly stemmed from not controlling for pupil size. As a practical\nexample, mis-accommodation by \u00bd, 1, 2, or 3 D in a subject having 1.0 decimal acuity\nFor small values of defocus the equation simplifies further, to\nv=vbc % 1 \u00c0 D2 for small D 6% error below \u00bd D\nSince the graphs for the (empirical) Equations (10) and (11) have a \u00bdhorizontal tangent at\nzero diopters, there is rather little change of acuity with blur for small blur values (<\u00bc D), a\nfamiliar finding in everyday practice.\nVisual acuity (as measured with grating stimuli) is essentially determined by the high-\nfrequency end of the contrast sensitivity function (effects of blur also extend to other parts\nof the contrast sensitivity function of course). This is quantified by the corresponding\nConclusion\nWe have illustrated and discussed choosing the proper blur kernel to simulate visual\ndegradation. In the case of defocus, this is a simple disk. Different blur kernels may\nproduce qualitatively different images. In particular, Gaussian blur does not introduce\nspurious resolution and related effects and is thus fundamentally different from the blur\nthat is associated with typical optical problems. The blur-disk's diameter, except for small\nvalues of defocus, is proportional to defocus in diopters and pupil size; its linear size in a\nstimulus is proportional to the stimulus' relative distance from the near or far point.\nDegradation of visual acuity from its best-corrected value is related to defocus blur by\na simple (inverse) second-order equation in a wide range of defocus including small\nvalues.\n"
