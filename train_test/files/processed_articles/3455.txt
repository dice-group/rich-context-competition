    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis descriptive survey study was designed to find out the utilization of e-counseling in career information dissemination\namong the undergraduates of the federal universities in South East Nigeria. Three research questions and three null\nhypotheses guided the study. The population of the study consisted of 36 guidance counselors and 64,997 undergraduates\nof the federal universities in South East Nigeria. The sample consisted of 1,036 participants. This is made up of all the 36\nguidance counselors in the federal universities in South East Nigeria, and 1,000 undergraduates randomly selected from the\nvarious universities. In each university, 200 undergraduates made up of 100 males and 100 females were randomly selected\nusing balloting by replacement. All the guidance counselors were used due to smallness in number. The instrument for\ndata collection was the E-Counselling Career Information Dissemination Questionnaire (E-CCIDQ). The reliability of the\ninstrument was established using Cronbach's alpha statistical analysis, and reliability indices of .91, .85, and .84 were obtained\nfor the three clusters. Data for the research questions were answered using percentage, mean, and standard deviation, while\nthe null hypotheses were analyzed using t test statistics tested at the .05 level of significance. The research findings revealed\nthat the universities in South East of Nigeria have e-counseling facilities and the students are very aware of e-counseling\nopportunities in the universities. Also, the counselors and undergraduates to a high extent utilize e-counseling in career\ninformation dissemination. Based on findings, discussions and some recommendations were made.\n",

This technology has offered opportunities in commu-\nnication, among which is e-counseling, which enables coun-\nselors to provide supportive online counseling opportunities\nthrough a live webcam session, Internet chatting, messaging,\nInternet conferencing, emailing, and telephoning. Ani (2006)\nnotes that the use of ICT has revolutionized access to infor-\nmation of the business world. In advanced nations such as\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, it has\nbeen experimentally found that the use of computer to com-\nplement the effort of human labor has brought about\nimproved performance. In counseling, this shifted drastically\nfrom the conventional face-to-face counseling relationship\napproach to a more dynamic, flexible, and more convenient\napproach called e-counseling or online counseling\nE-counseling is one of the counseling opportunities intro-\nduced in the recent decades for delivering psychotherapeutic\nservices. It is defined as therapeutic service delivered by a\nhelping professional with electronic devices such as the\nInternet and audio media. It can exist in real life situations\nsuch as in the use of skype, phone conversation, chatting\nonline, and e-messaging (Suler, 2000).

Therefore, e-counseling, in which the mode of com-\nmunication is often through writings via emails or a chat\nroom, allows both the client and the therapist opportunity to\npay close attention to their communication and reflect on\ntheir thoughts and feelings prior to their being expressed.\nThis probably may be a particularly suitable way of commu-\nnicating and expressing of oneself through words. Clients\nmay also be able to communicate better in this environment\nas they are not affected by the therapist's non-verbal cues\n(Haberstroth, Duffey, Evans, Gee, & Trepal, 2007).\nNigeria is fast growing into a computerized nation in recent\nyears. This is seen in the rate at which students and counselors\nembark on utilization of e-counseling. This trend invariably\nmakes Nigeria an Internet-oriented society, particularly in the\nfederal universities in South East Nigeria. Although, the\nmajority of students and counselors utilize face-to-face coun-\nseling, a good number of others utilize e-counseling. Those\nwho utilize e-counseling sometimes tend more pressing prob-\nlems, needs, and aspirations in their academic pursuits when\ncompared with their counterparts who utilize face-to-face\ncounseling (Kraus, Hen, Boniel-Nissim, & Shapira, 2008).\nHowever, insufficient availability of e-counseling facilities\nsuch as computer system, cellular phone, CD-ROM, Internet\nconnection, web browser, flash drive, virus scanner, backup,\nscanner, Internet telephony, diskette, graphic editor, white-\nboard, and Java might tend to hinder effective utilization of\ne-counseling in Nigerian universities just as it is with e-learn-\ning. This assertion would be determined in this study. Other\nhindering factors include irregular supply of electricity, inad-\nequate procurement of ICT facilities, and poor maintenance of\nthese facilities (Chiaha, Eze, & Ezeudu, 2013). No wonder\nFebbets (1999) remarked that Nigeria needed to up-grade its\nICT facilities and terminals if she must compete effectively in\nthis fast evolving ICT era.\nNevertheless, despite the limitations of these hindering\nfactors, e-counseling utilization tends to become an impor-\ntant source of communication for therapy to a growing num-\nber of consumers among who are students in Nigerian\nuniversities. It offers mental health professional, which is\nanother way of providing services to their clients (Cherry,\n2014). One of the characteristics or good aspects of e-coun-\nseling is its convenience. Both the counselor and the client\nhave the convenience of corresponding with each other at a\nrange of variant times (Khasanshina, Wolf, Emerson, &\nStachura, 2008), thus, taking away the hassle of scheduling\nand setting appointments, which characterize the conven-\ntional face-to-face counseling practice. In addition, e-coun-\nseling creates an opportunity for the therapists to extend their\nservices to more clients, as appointments can be potentially\nscheduled over 24 hr and can reach a larger geographical\nregion through synchronous and asynchronous e-counseling\nFurthermore, those individuals who are ambivalent\nabout counseling or who may be uncomfortable with the\ntraditional models of therapy tend to find e-counseling\nmore convenient, comfortable, and suitable than the con-\nventional face-to-face counseling communication. This is\nbecause of its unlimited access to information and per-\nceived privacy for clients such as those suffering from\nsocial phobia, agora phobias, or anxiety disorders (Gedge,\nprotection of the counselor and his client (Cherry, 2014,\nnotes that the advantages of e-counseling is making it to be\nwidely acceptable in the counseling field.\nIt is important to note that although e-counseling has been\nconsidered effective in counseling profession, it has also\nbeen criticized in terms of non-observation of verbal and\nnon-verbal cues, from both counselor and client, difficulties\nin maintaining clients' confidentiality, and security. Other\ncriticisms include its overall effectiveness, technological dif-\nficulties, and its limits of being able to guarantee the coun-\nselor's credibility (Elleven & Allen, 2004). Based on these,\nthe researchers are concerned with determining the extent of\nutilization of e-counseling in career information dissemina-\ntion among undergraduates of the federal universities in\nSouth East Nigeria.\nCareer information refers to any type of fact about jobs,\nbusiness, occupation, profession, trade, or work obtained for\nuse in career planning to earn a living. It is a valid and useful\ninformation given to an individual to enable him become\npurposeful and effective in his career-oriented profession\n(Omeje, 2010). Consequently, the aim of career information\nis to help individuals to understand themselves and the world\nof work better so as to function effectively in and outside it\n(Iwuama, 1999). In other words, it helps individuals imbibe\nto strategies for proper choice and management of careers so\nthat they can have a very sound career development.\nAlthough the imperatives of e-counseling calls for its uti-\nlization in dissemination of career information to undergrad-\nuates in the universities, the researchers are uncertain about\nthe extent of its utilization in dissemination of career infor-\nmation among university undergraduates in South East\nNigeria. Hence, the researchers are poised to ask the follow-\ning: Do counselors utilize e-counseling in dissemination of\ncareer information to undergraduates in the universities? If\nthey do, to what extent is this obtained? It is in view of these\nconcerns that the study is being carried out.\nResearch Questions\nIn line with the above, these research questions were posed\nto guide the study.\nResearch Question 1: What are the e-counseling facili-\nties available for career information dissemination in the\nfederal universities in South East Nigeria?\nOmeje et al. 3\nResearch Question 2: What are the students' awareness\nlevels of e-counseling opportunities for career informa-\ntion dissemination?\nResearch Question 3: What is the extent of utilization of\ne-counseling in career information dissemination by the\ncounselors and undergraduate students?\nHypotheses\nThe following null hypotheses postulated were tested at the\n.05 level of significance.\nHypothesis 1: There is no significant difference between\nthe mean scores of undergraduates and counselors on\navailability of e-counseling facilities for dissemination of\ncareer information.\nHypothesis 2: There is no significant difference between\nmean scores of male and female undergraduates on aware-\nness level of e-counseling opportunities for career infor-\nmation dissemination.\nHypothesis 3: There is no significant difference between\nthe mean scores of undergraduates and counselors on\nextent of utilization of e-counseling in dissemination of\ncareer information.\nMethod\nThe study was carried in the federal universities in South East\nNigeria. South East Nigeria has five states, namely, Enugu,\nEbonyi, Imo, Abia, and Anambra states. The federal universi-\nties in South East Nigeria are University of Nigeria, Nsukka\n(UNN); Federal University of Science and Technology\nOwerri (FUTO), Michael Okpara Federal University of\nAgriculture Umudike, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka,\nand the Federal University Ndufu-Aike Ikwo.\nThe population of the study comprised all the 65,033 uni-\nversity guidance counselors and undergraduates in the five\nfederal universities, South East of Nigeria. This is made up\nsource: academic planning unit of various federal universi-\nsion). The sample of this study was 1,036 participants made\nates selected randomly through balloting by replacement. In\neach of the federal university, 200 undergraduates made up\nthe final year students in the faculties of education, agricul-\nture, and social sciences, while all the guidance counselors in\nthe whole federal universities were used for the study due to\nthe smallness of their number.\nThe instrument that was used for data collection\nwas the E-Counselling Career Information Dissemination\nQuestionnaire (E-CCIDQ) designed by the researchers. This\ninstrument has two sections, A and B. Section A is designed to\nelicit bio-data information of the respondents while Section B\ncontains 34 items put into three clusters. Cluster 1 elicits infor-\nmation on various e-counseling facilities available for dissem-\nination of career information in universities. The items were\nplaced on two-point rating scales of available (AV) and not\navailable (NA), which were weighted 1 and 0. Cluster 2\nfocuses on students' awareness level of e-counseling opportu-\nnities for career information dissemination, while Cluster 3\nelicits information on extent of utilization of e-counseling in\ncareer information dissemination. The items in Clusters 2 and\n3 were placed on a four-point rating scale of very aware (VA),\nmoderately aware (MA), rarely aware (RA), and not aware\n(NA) for Cluster 2; and very high extent (VHE), high extent\n(HE), low extent (LE), very low extent (VLE) for Cluster 3.\nThey have assigned weight of 4, 3, 2, and 1 points, respec-\ntively. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 were completed by the undergradu-\nate students, while the guidance counselors completed only\nThe reliability of the instrument was established using\nCronbach's alpha analysis to ascertain the internal consis-\ntency of the items and reliability. The analysis of data gave\nrespective clusters.\nThe data collected from the study were analyzed using\nfrequency, percentage, and mean to answer the research\nquestions generated for the study. A criterion mean score of\n2.50, which is the average of the weighted responses per item\nwas used as decision rule for agreement or disagreement of\nan item. As the items of the questionnaire were positively\nframed, any score from 2.50 to 4.0 was an indication of\nagreement with the item of the questionnaire, while below\n2.50 was an indication of disagreement.\nResults\nResearch Question 1: What are the e-counseling facili-\nties available for the career information dissemination in\nthe federal universities in South East Nigeria?\nTable 1 shows the percentage ratings of counselors and\nundergraduates on the availability of e-counseling facilities\nfor career information dissemination in the federal universi-\nties in South East Nigeria. The analysis reveals that the per-\ncentage ratings of both counselors and the undergraduates on\nthe availability of Items 1 to 15 are more than 50 percent-\nages. This, by implication, shows that all the 15 items are\navailable e-counseling facilities for career information dis-\nsemination in the federal universities in South East Nigeria.\nResearch Question 2: What are the students' awareness\nlevels of e-counseling opportunities for career informa-\ntion dissemination?\nData analysis in Table 2 shows the mean and standard\ndeviations of the awareness level of male and female\n4 SAGE Open\nundergraduates on e-counseling opportunities for career\ninformation dissemination. The data analysis result shows\nthat the mean ratings of both male and female undergradu-\nindicating that undergraduates in the federal universities in\nSouth East Nigeria are very aware of those e-counseling\nopportunities. The mean ratings of both male and female\nundergraduates to Items 4, 5, and 7 are within the range of\nuniversities in South East Nigeria are moderately aware of\nthose e-counseling opportunities. However, the overall\nundergraduates, respectively, imply that the students are\nvery aware of the e-counseling opportunities. Besides, the\noverall standard deviations of 0.57 and 0.45 for the male and\nthe female indicate that the ratings of the undergraduates did\nnot vary much.\nResearch Question 3: What is the extent of utilization of\ne-counseling in career information dissemination among\ncounselors and undergraduates?\nTable 3 shows the mean and standard deviation of the rat-\nings of counselors and undergraduates on the extent of utili-\nzation of e-counseling in career information dissemination\namong the undergraduates. The analysis shows that the mean\nratings of both counselors and undergraduates to Items 1, 2,\nthat both the counselors and the undergraduates to a very\nhigh extent utilize those e-counseling in career information\ndissemination. Also, the mean ratings of both the counselors\nundergraduates to a high extent utilize those e-counseling in\ncareer information dissemination. Similarly, the overall\nundergraduates, respectively, imply that both to a high extent\nutilize e-counseling in career information dissemination. The\noverall standard deviation scores (counselors = 0.28 and\nundergraduates = 0.52) indicate that the two categories of\nrespondents vary much in their ratings of extent of utilization\nof e-counseling in career information dissemination.\nHypothesis 1: There is no significant difference between\nthe mean ratings of the undergraduates and the counselors\non the availability of e-counseling facilities for dissemi-\nnation of career information.\nTable 4 shows that the calculated chi-square value of 1.72\nhas a probability value of .63. Because the probability value\nof .63 is greater than the .05 level of significance, the null\nhypothesis is accepted. Thus, there is no significant differ-\nence between the ratings of undergraduates and counselors\non the availability of e-counseling facilities for dissemina-\ntion of career information.\nHypothesis 2: There is no significant difference between\nmean ratings of the male and the female undergraduates\non awareness level of e-counseling opportunities for\ncareer information dissemination.\nTable 5 shows that the probability associated with the cal-\nculated value of t(\u00ad.338) is .74. Because the probability value\nof .74 is greater than .05 level of significance, the null\nhypothesis is accepted meaning that there is no significant\ndifference between mean ratings of male and female\nTable 1.

Because the probabil-\nity value of .04 is less than .05 level of significance, the null\nhypothesis is rejected. Thus, there is a significant difference\nbetween the mean ratings of the undergraduates and the\ncounselors on the extent of utilization of e-counseling in dis-\nsemination of career information with the mean ratings of the\nundergraduates being higher than that of the counselors. This\nimplies that the undergraduates utilize e-counseling in dis-\nseminating of career information more than the counselors.\nDiscussion\nThe e-counseling facilities are available for career informa-\ntion dissemination in the federal universities in South East\nNigeria.\nThe results displayed in Table 1 reveal the percentage of\nthe ratings of the counselors and the undergraduates on the\nTable 2.

This, by implication\nshows that all the items are the available e-counseling facili-\nties for career information dissemination in the federal uni-\nversities in South East Nigeria and that these e-counseling\nfacilities are familiar to the counselors and the undergradu-\nates. This finding is in agreement with the early study of\nFebbets (1999), which notes that we live in a fast-changing\nworld, and if Nigerians must not be left behind, there is need\nto up-grade terminals to microcomputer, maintain them to\nkeep pace with the technological development, which not\nonly has significant impact on the information industry but\nalso is an important factor in information planning.\nIndeed, the result of Null Hypothesis 1 shows that there is\nno significant difference between the mean ratings of the\nundergraduates and the counselors on the availability of\ne-counseling facilities for dissemination of career information.\nIt further affirms the Research Question 1 analyses on the\navailability of e-counseling facilities among the undergradu-\nates in the universities. This finding is interesting as it tends to\nshow that both the counselors and the undergraduates can\nidentify ICT facilities and their uses. Implicitly, with the avail-\nabilities of the ICT facilities, e-counseling would be functional\nin the universities South East of Nigeria. Consequently, in line\nwith Ani (2006), the availabilities of these facilities would\nenhance dissemination of career information through\ne-counseling.\nStudents' Awareness Level of E-Counseling\nOpportunities for Career Information\nDissemination\nThe result of data analysis with respect to the undergraduates\nawareness level of e-counseling opportunities for career\ninformation dissemination presented in Table 2 indicates that\nthe male and the female students are very aware of e-cous-\nnelling opportunities for dissemination of career information\n3.56, SD = 0.45). A global look at the analysis shows that the\nmale and the female undergraduates are very aware of the\nuse of e-counseling opportunities such as classroom forum,\ne-messaging and chatting, and synchronous and asynchro-\nnous e-counseling in dissemination of career information.\nHowever, the male and the female students' awareness of the\nuse of film modeling, psychometric test instruments stored in\nCD-ROM, and WhatsApp opportunities in career informa-\ntion dissemination is of a moderate level. The fact that the\nundergraduates are aware of these e-counseling opportuni-\nties for dissemination of career information is interesting. It\nalso shows that Nigerian undergraduates are not ignorant of\nthese e-counseling opportunities but rather they have com-\nplaints with the existing e-counseling opportunities available\nfor use in this fast evolving ICT era (Febbets, 1999).\nThe data analysis result in Table 5 reveals that there is no\nsignificant difference between the male and the female stu-\ndents' awareness level of e-counseling opportunities for\ncareer information dissemination (t cal = 0.33, sig [2-tailed]\nmale and the female undergraduates did not differ in their\nawareness level of the e-counseling opportunities for dis-\nsemination of career information indicates that they are\nICT compliant gender. This finding corroborates with\nKhasanshina et al. (2008) that most students limited by the\nconventional face-to-face counseling resort now to e-coun-\nseling, which is a more convenient and faster means of com-\nmunicating with a counselor.\nThe Extent of Utilization of E-Counseling in\nCareer Information Dissemination Among the\nUndergraduates\nResult of data analysis on the extent of utilization of e-\ncounseling in dissemination of career information by\nTable 4. Chi-Square Analysis of the Ratings of Undergraduate\nand Counselors on the Availability of E-Counseling Facilities for\nDissemination of Career Information.\nValue df\nAsymp. sig.\n(two-sided)\naTwo cells (25.0%) have expected count less than 5. The minimum\nexpected count is .35.\nOmeje et al. 7\ncounselors and undergraduate students presented in Table 3\nshows that both groups of respondents utilize e-counseling\nin dissemination of career information to a high extent\n(counselors: overall X = 3.31; undergraduates: overall X\n= 3.49). The result further reveals that in e-counseling, both\nthe counselors and the undergraduates source and dissemi-\nnate career information via mobile phones, Facebook, email,\nand Google search. Others include using Twitter, Palmchats,\nWhatsApp, and Black Berry Messenger (BBM). That both\nthe counselors and the undergraduate students utilize\ne-counseling to a high extent in disseminating career infor-\nmation is encouraging. This finding tends to be in conso-\nfindings that e-counseling is drastically overtaking the con-\nventional face-to-face counseling due to its more flexible,\nconvenient, and accessibility qualities.\nThis study, in addition, reveals through the hypothesis\ntesting result in Table 6, that a significant difference exists\nbetween the extent of utilization of e-counseling in career\ninformation dissemination by the counselors and the under-\ngraduate respondents, with the undergraduates being higher\nin the utilization than the counselors (counselors: X = 3.31;\nthese undergraduates, final year students, are likely unem-\nployed. So, they are more likely to be engaged in the use of\nonline social networks in sourcing and disseminating of\ncareer information than the counselors who are already\nemployed. In addition, the convenience of use and easy\naccessibility to career information via e-counseling mode\nmight have also contributed to their higher utilization of\ne-counseling in disseminating career information.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe guidance counselors and the undergraduate students'\nrespondents have identified 15 e-counseling facilities such as\ncomputer system, cellular phone, CD-ROM Internet connec-\ntion, web browser, flash drive, virus scanner, backup, scanner,\nInternet telephony, diskette, flash drive, graphic editor, white-\nboard, and Java as available for career information dissemi-\nnation in the universities in South East of Nigeria. Equally,\nthe study revealed also that the undergraduate students are\nvery aware of e-counseling opportunities for dissemination of\ncareer information. However, although both respondents are\nto a high extent using the identified e-counseling facilities in\ncareer information dissemination, it is also evident that\nfemales use these facilities more than males. Based on these\nfindings, the following recommendations are made:\n1. More e-counseling facilities should be made avail-\nable in the various federal universities in South East\nof Nigeria for more improvement in dissemination of\ncareer information among undergraduates.\n2. That the undergraduates utilize e-counseling in dis-\nseminating of career information more than the\ncounselors tends to suggest that e-counseling facilities\nare inadequate for use by the students and the counsel-\nors. Consequently, counselors should be provided with\nmore and stable facilities to enhance more opportuni-\nties for e-counseling with the undergraduates.\n3. Counselors should be provided with opportunities to\nattend workshops and conferences where they will be\nexposed to more novel opportunities available in\ne-counseling utilization. With such exposure, they\nwould be more knowledgeable and skilled in their\nusage in e-counseling opportunities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAni, S.
