Luszcz2\n1Centre for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra.\n2Centre for Ageing Studies, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia.\nA population-based sample (N = 787) was followed for 8 years and assessed three times on measures of well-being\n(depressive symptoms, morale, and control) and fall history. Marginal models assessed the association between\nbaseline well-being measures and falling. Random effects models assessed change in well-being indicators as well\nas change in fall rate over 8 years. After adjustment for sociodemographics, psychotropic medication, health, and\nsensorimotor function, our results showed that depressive symptoms, control, and morale were risk factors for\nsubsequent falling, and an increase in depressive symptoms or a reduction in morale was associated with an\nincreasing fall rate. We conclude that the three well-being measures are independently associated with falling and\nneed to be considered in fall-risk assessments and population-based prevention and intervention strategies.\nKey Words: Falls--Well-being--Depression--Morale.\nFALLS constitute a major public health problem in later life\nand are the leading cause of unintentional injury and\nhospitalization in persons aged 65 and older (Dellinger &\nStevens, 2006). With age, the risk of falling rises steadily, and\nthe 12-month risk of mortality after being hospitalized for a fall\nsearch has identified risk factors for falling, and evaluation of\ninterventions to address these risk factors is extensive. Most of\nthis research has focused on understanding the physiological,\nsensory, and environmental factors leading to falls (Lord,\nalso literature demonstrating that depressive symptoms may\nincrease the risk of falling in later life for both community-\nbased individuals (Kron, Loy, Sturm, Nikolaus, & Becker,\n2003) and stroke survivors (Jorgensen, Engstad, & Jacobsen,\n2002). The Osteoporotic Fractures Study found that, over a\n6-year follow-up period, depression increased the risk of falling\nAnother multisite study of 311 community-dwelling elders\nfollowed for 36 weeks found that ``depressive state of mind''\npredicted falling along with more traditional risk factors such as\nsway, fall history, and grip strength (Stalenhoef, Diederiks,\nIt remains unclear whether the association between depression\nand falling is a direct effect or whether it is mediated by psy-\nchotropic medication (Cumming, 1998; Leipzig, Cumming, &\ndecline (Anstey, von Sanden, & Luszcz, 2006), physical decline\n(Penninx et al., 1998), or other factors. One study has shown that\ndepression among hospitalized older adults is associated with\nmotor disturbances that may predispose individuals to falling,\nthus providing one mechanistic link between depression and\nfalling (Turcu et al., 2004). In the present study we seek to\nbroaden the scope of factors that are considered to be potential\npredictors of falling in later life, by examining psychological\nwell-being as a predictor and covariate of falling, in the\nAustralian Longitudinal Study of Ageing.\nIt is possible that the observed associations between\ndepressive symptoms and falling reflect a more general\nassociation between psychological well-being (Luszcz, 1998)\nand falling, justifying the investigation of other measures of\npsychological well-being for potential inclusion in fall-risk\nassessments or for incorporation in intervention strategies. The\nrelationship between well-being and adaptive aging has\nreceived increasing attention (Ryff & Singer, 2000) as the\nliterature recognizes that well-being is more than the absence of\nmental illness or negative affective states. Two approaches to\nwell-being have been identified (Ryan & Deci, 2001). The\nhedonic approach focuses on the experience of positive or\nnegative valence, with the relationship between these two states\ntypically an excellent indicator of life satisfaction (Diener,\n1984). In contrast, the eudaimonic approach focuses on those\ncharacteristics (e.g., mastery and control beliefs, self-growth\nand acceptance, self-referent beliefs, social support, and\nautonomy) that are related to adaptive functioning (Ryff &\nKeyes, 1995). However, increasing degrees of commonality\namong these approaches has been demonstrated at the higher-\norder factor level (Abbott et al., 2006). Consequently, the\npresent study includes measures of well-being that are inclusive\nof these different approaches.\nAnother important question for understanding psychological\nrisk factors for falls is whether changes in factors that are\nassociated with falling in cross-sectional analyses or at the\npopulation level are also predictive within individuals in\nlongitudinal analyses. Researchers have stressed that between-\nperson differences do not necessarily reflect within-person\nchange (Hofer & Sliwinski, 2001). Therefore, in the present\nstudy, we first assessed the key variables of interest (measures\nof well-being) by using population-average models that\nestimated whether individuals having poorer scores on\nmeasures of well-being were at increased risk of falling\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\ncompared with individuals with higher scores on measures of\nwell-being. We then used random effects models to evaluate\nwhether decline in well-being within persons was also asso-\nciated with an increasing fall risk over the follow-up period.\nFinally, an important aspect of this study was the inclusion of\na larger number of covariates than are typically incorporated in\nfalls research. We adjusted for demographic factors, medical\nconditions, a measure of cognitive function, and health behav-\niors that have been associated with falling in previous research\nevaluate the extent to which well-being was independently\nassociated with falling. Our specific hypotheses were as\nfollows. First, lower morale, increased depressive symptoms,\nand lower expectation of control would be associated with an\nincreased risk of falling in population-average models. Second,\ndeclines in indices of well-being would be associated with an\nincreased rate of falling in random effects models. Third, given\nthe association between falls and several of the covariates\nincluded in this study, we expected effect sizes to reduce\nprogressively after adjustment for covariates.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nWe drew the data for this study from the Australian Longi-\ntudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA; Andrews, Cheok, & Carr,\n1989). Participants provided written consent and the Clinical\nInvestigations Committee of the Flinders Medical Centre in\nSouth Australia granted ethics approval. Researchers used the\nSouth Australian Electoral Roll as a sampling frame to identify\npotential participants aged 70 years and older. They stratified\nthe sample (N\u00bc2,087) by age and sex into three 5-year cohorts,\naged 85 years and older. In addition, partners of participants\naged 65 and older were invited into the study.\nOur investigation drew from three waves of data collection\nincluding clinical assessments: Wave 1 was conducted between\ncomprised telephone interviews and did not include clinical or\ncognitive assessments. We included participants in the present\nstudy (N \u00bc 787) if they had answered falls questions at Wave 6.\nAll of these participants had falls data available at Wave 1, and\nEducation and Mini-Mental State Examination\nWe measured education as the total number of years of\nformal education (range \u00bc from 0 to 20 years). We used the\nclinical cutoff for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),\nthat is, 23 points or fewer on the 30-item version or prorated\nequivalent on the 21-item version, to screen out those\nparticipants who had dementia. Researchers also used MMSE\nscores as a measure of cognitive functioning to predict falls\namong the nondemented participants. At Wave 1, researchers\nused a 21-item version of the test (Folstein, Robins, & Helzer,\n1983). This test assesses orientation, registration, attention,\ncalculation, and recall (Teri, Hughes, & Larson, 1990). We\nadministered the 30-item version at Waves 3 and 6. We\nconverted the 21-item version to a 30-item scale by using this\nSensorimotor Measures\nWe tested corrected distance visual acuity at 3 m for each eye\nby using a well-illuminated Snellen chart. The criterion for\ndistance visual acuity was the smallest line at which the\nparticipant could correctly read at least half of the characters.\nWe measured grip strength in the dominant hand by using\na dynamometer while the participant was standing. The average\nof two attempts at maximum force was recorded in kilograms.\nWe measured balance with the semitandem stand and a measure\nof functional reach. For the tandem stand, participants were\nrequired to stand with the heel of one foot next to the ball of the\nopposite foot and to maintain their balance without moving\ntheir feet. Performance was rated according to whether the\nparticipant could hold the position for 10 seconds (coded as 1),\nwas able to hold the position for less than 10 seconds (coded as\n2), or tried but was unable to hold the position (coded as 3).\nFunctional reach assessed the maximal reach a participant could\nachieve while maintaining a fixed-base standing posture. The\naverage distance in centimeters from three trials was used as the\nscore.\nHealth Measures\nWe obtained health measures during the home interview. We\nmeasured self-rated health (SRH) on a 5-point scale (1 \u00bc\nexcellent, 2 \u00bc very good, 3 \u00bc good, 4 \u00bc fair, and 5 \u00bc poor). A\nself-report questionnaire of 61 medical conditions was based on\nmeasures used in the Duke Longitudinal Studies of Aging\n(Palmore, 1970) and the Established Populations for Epidemi-\nologic Study of the Elderly (National Institute on Aging, 1986).\nWe selected conditions known to affect fall risk for this study as\nindependent variables, including heart condition or attack,\nhypertension, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and diabetes.\nWe scored all of these as 1 \u00bc yes and 0 \u00bc no. Information was\nalso obtained on psychotropic medication (1 \u00bc yes; 0 \u00bc no),\ncurrent smoking (1 \u00bc yes; 0 \u00bc no) and frequency of alcohol\nconsumption (1 4 times per month; 2 \u00bc 2 to 3 times per\nweek; 3 ! 4 times per week).\nPsychological Well-Being\nWe measured depressive symptoms by using the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression scale (CES-D), a 20-item\nquestionnaire designed to measure depression in community-\nbased epidemiological studies (Radloff, 1977). Item responses\nare in reference to the way the individual felt over the past week.\nA 4-point Likert-scale is utilized, with answers extending from\nrarely or none of the time (0) to most of the time (3), with scores\nranging from 0 to 60. The CES-D has shown internal\naged 70 and older, and it has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity\nof 73% for detecting clinically significant depression in previous\nresearch (Lewinsohn, Seeley, Roberts, & Allen, 1997). Cron-\nWe measured morale with the five items loading most\nstrongly on each of the subscales of agitation, lonely\ndissatisfaction, and attitude toward own aging from the\nPhiladelphia Geriatric Centre Morale Scale (Lawton, 1983;\nof scales has been shown to be invariant across age and gender\nin older samples (Liang, Lawrence, & Bollen, 1986). In this\n15-item test, with responses of agree or disagree, a higher score\nindicates higher morale. Cronbach's alpha was a \u00bc 0.81 or 0.82\nat each wave.\nWe measured control with the Expectancy of Control\nsubscale from the Desired Control Measure (DCM; Reid &\nZiegler, 1980), which asks respondents to indicate the extent to\nwhich they believe they actually have control in areas of\ninvolvement with others, engagement in activities, and health.\nThe DCM comprises two subscales measuring desire and\nexpectancy for control in areas found to be important to\npsychological well-being of older adults (Reid, Haas, &\nHawkings, 1977). The expectancy subscale appears to be\na more reliable and sensitive measure than either the desire\nsubscale or a total score, based on summing the cross-products\nof the two separate subscales (Reid & Ziegler), possibly\nbecause of the importance of the expectancy of realizing\ndesired outcomes rather than the desire for control per se. This\n12-item scale with five levels of response (1\u00bc strongly agree,\n2 \u00bc agree, 3 \u00bc neither agree nor disagree, 4 \u00bc disagree, and 5 \u00bc\nstrongly disagree) was scored such that a higher score indicated\nlower control expectancies and hence poorer well-being.\n3, and 6, respectively.\nQuestions on Falling\nAt Waves 1, 3, and 6 participants answered an injury\nquestionnaire as part of the larger health and sociodemographic\nquestionnaire, and this included questions on falls. For this\nstudy, the main dependent variable was falls per year, measured\nby this question: ``Have you had any falls in the past year--\nincluding those falls that did not result in injury as well as those\nthat did?'' Although the gold standard method for reporting\nfalls is the prospective calendar method, retrospective self-\nreports of falls over 6 months have shown an 84% agreement\nwith falls reported by use of a calendar (Mackenzie, Byles, &\nD'Este, 2006), and a meta-analysis has shown that the recall of\nfalls in the previous year was specific (specificity was 91% to\na prospective method of recording falls (Ganz, Higashi, &\nStatistical Analyses\nWe compared sociodemographics, health, sensorimotor\nfunction, MMSE score, and depressive symptoms between\nthree fall groups at Wave 1 (nonfallers, single fallers, and\nmultiple fallers) by using a one-way analysis of variance in\nwhich variables were continuous and by using a Pearson chi-\nsquare (v2) test in which variables were categorical. In those\ninstances in which the expected frequency of a cell was ,5 for\ncategorical variables, we used Fisher's Exact Test. We imputed\nmissing item data by using the expectation maximization algo-\nrithm, which is an iterative optimization procedure (Graham,\nSPSS using all available items.\nWe used marginal models (population-average models) to\nestimate between-subject effects of the relationships between\nmeasures of well-being at Wave 1 and rate of falls over the\n8 years of follow-up. We used generalized estimating equations\nwith the log link function and Poisson distribution (Fitzmaurice,\nLaird, & Ware, 2004). We assumed the within-subject\nassociation among the vector of repeated outcomes to have an\nexchangeable correlation structure (Twisk, 2003). This ap-\nproach allows for the full distribution of the falls variable to be\nmodeled and incorporates all falls data available over three\noccasions of measurement, thereby allowing for reliable\nlongitudinal estimates and maximizing the use of available data.\nWe used a hierarchical approach to evaluate the relationship\nbetween well-being and falling, with three models being fit to\nthe data. Model 1 adjusted for time in the study, and demo-\ngraphic variables (dichotomous: gender; continuous: age, years\nof education), to determine the observed associations inde-\npendent of sampling effects. Model 2 added health variables\n(categorical: self-rated health, heart condition or attack,\nhypertension, stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes,\npsychotropic medication, current smoker, and alcohol frequen-\ncy) to Model 1. It adjusted for medical conditions and health\nbehaviors to evaluate the association between well-being and\nfalling independent of potentially confounding physical health\nfactors that may lead to poorer physical outcomes and mental\nhealth. Model 3 added sensorimotor variables and cognitive\nfunction (categorical: semitandem stand; continuous: visual\nacuity, functional reach, grip strength, and MMSE score) to\nModel 2. It tested whether well-being was associated with\nfalling independent of the sensorimotor factors and cognitive\nfunction shown to affect balance and fall risk (Anstey et al.,\nreference category for all categorical variables. In those in-\nstances in which main effects of well-being measures were\nsignificant, we also tested interactions between time and these\nmeasures after we included all covariates in Model 3.\nWe examined the effects of within-person change in\ndepressive symptoms, morale, or control on the rate of falls\n(i.e., subject-specific effects) by using random effects models\n(random intercept and slope specified for time) using the log\nlink function and Poisson distribution (Fitzmaurice et al.,\nwell-being variables were time varying rather than just being\nincluded at Wave 1.\nTo overcome potential recall bias caused by possible cogni-\ntive impairment, we reestimated all marginal models and ran-\ndom effects models by excluding participants who scored\nbelow the cutoff score for possible dementia (i.e., ,24; see\nFolstein, Anthony, Parhad, Duffy, & Gruenberg, 1985) on the\nMMSE at any wave.

Multiple fallers were also\nmore likely than the others to have higher depression, lower\nmorale, and higher control scores, all indicating lower levels of\nwell-being.

Marginal models show the between-\nperson effects on falls of measures of well-being at Wave 1, and\nrandom effects models show the effect of within-person change\nin morale, control, and depressive symptoms on fall rate. The\nsignificant effects for time show that the rate of falling\nincreased by approximately 5% per annum during the 8 years\nof follow-up when we adjusted simultaneously for the\ndemographic variables and individual well-being measures.\nThe significant effect for age and gender shows that older adults\nand women were more likely than younger adults and men to\nfall during the follow-up period. There was no effect of\neducation on falling.\nHigher scores on the Morale scale at Wave 1 were associated\nwith a lower fall rate. Specifically, a participant who scored one\nunit higher on the Morale scale compared with another\nparticipant experienced [1 \u00c0 (1/incident rate ratio or IRR) \u00bc\nmodel, individuals whose morale improved over the follow-up\nperiod had a reduced risk of falling such that for every increase\nof 1 point on the Morale scale, an individual reduced her or his\nrisk of falling by 8%.\nHigher scores on the Control scale at Wave 1 were associated\nwith a higher fall rate. Specifically, a participant who scored\none unit higher (i.e., worse) on the Control scale compared with\nanother participant experienced 4% more falls. When examined\nas a time-varying covariate in the random effects model, control\nwas not associated with fall rate. This was because there was no\nmean change in control from Wave 1 to Wave 6.\nHigher scores on the CES-D scale at Wave 1 were associated\nwith a higher fall rate. A participant who scored one unit higher\non the CES-D scale compared with another participant\nexperienced 4% fewer falls. In the random effects model,\nindividuals whose depressive symptoms increased over the\nfollow-up period had an increased risk of falling such that for\nevery increase of 1 point on the CES-D score, an individual\nincreased her or his risk of falling by 4%.\nIn the marginal models, there were significant Morale 3\nTime interactions (b , .01, p , .01) and CES-D Score 3 Time\ninteractions (b , .01, p , .01), indicating that those with\npoorer well-being at Wave 1 had a greater rate of increase in\ndepressive symptoms over the 8-year follow-up. When we\nexcluded those participants with MMSE scores of ,24 from\nthe analyses, we found that the pattern of results for Model 1\nwas unchanged in both marginal models and random effects\nmodels.\nAdjustment for Demographic and Health Variables. --\nTable 3 shows the results of models of well-being and falls\nas adjusted for demographic variables and health. There were\nno changes in the patterns of results for demographic variables\nafter the addition of the health measures, except that education\nbecame a significant predictor of morale in the marginal\nmodels. Reporting a heart condition, taking psychotropic\nmedication, and smoking were not associated with falling.\nResults for the marginal models showed that those with poorer\nSRH, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes at Wave 1 had higher\nrates of falling in the subsequent 8 years of follow-up. Results\nfor alcohol consumption were mixed; those individuals\nconsuming two to three drinks per week reported an increased\nfall rate, whereas those consuming four or more drinks per\nweek had a reduced fall rate, compared with participants who\nconsumed four or fewer drinks per month. For the marginal\nmodels, the Time 3 CES-D Score interaction remained\nResults for medical conditions were slightly less consistent in\nthe random effects models, with fewer medical conditions\nbeing significant predictors of fall rate.

In the marginal models, the patterns of interactions\nwith time remained unchanged after we adjusted for sensori-\nmotor variables and MMSE score.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study supported our first hypothesis that\nbetween-person differences in Wave 1 depressive symptoms,\nmorale, and control all predict subsequent fall rate over 8 years\nin older adults. We found this effect after adjusting for all of our\ncovariates, indicating that well-being is an independent pre-\ndictor of falling over at least 8 years of follow-up. The fact that\nthe sample of individuals included in our analysis had better\nscores on the well-being measures than those observed in the\nfull sample shows that those persons persisting in the study\nwere higher functioning than those in the initial population-\nbased sample. This suggests that the results of this study may\nunderestimate the strength of the association between well-\nbeing and falling in the population. At Wave 1 there were no\ndifferences on the three measures of well-being between those\nindividuals who reported one fall and those who reported no\nfalls in the previous 12 months. Those who reported falling\nmore than once in the previous 12 months did report worse\nwell-being at Wave 1. This suggests that the importance of\nwell-being is to some extent prognostic, and it is more likely to\nbe a consequence of the impact of previous falling among those\nreporting multiple falls.\nOur second hypothesis, that within-person change in well-\nbeing would be associated with change in fall rate, was\nsupported in relation to depressive symptoms and morale but\nnot control. Our examination of the estimated marginal means\nfor control indicated that there was no change between Wave 1\nand Wave 6 but that there was a decrease in scores at Wave 3.\nThis explained the lack of significant effects seen in the random\neffects models when we used control as the time-varying\ncovariate. It seems that the expectancy of control is relatively\nstable in late life (Luszcz, 1998) and that individual differences\n(rather than within-person change) in this variable are important\nfor predicting falls. It is possible that domain-specific aspects\nof control relevant to physical function may show more\nfluctuation as declines in mobility occur. The discrepancy in\nresults between analyses of between-person differences and\nwithin-person change in control highlights the importance of\nusing both approaches when one is investigating the signifi-\ncance of predictors in longitudinal research.\nA particular strength of this study was the control for a wide\nrange of covariates, and hence the results demonstrate an\nindependent effect of well-being on fall risk in community-\ndwelling older adults. As we expected, a number of the\npotentially confounding variables were significantly associated\nwith an increase in fall rate, including SRH, hypertension,\nstroke, diabetes, functional reach, grip strength, and semi-\ntandem stand. The association between alcohol consumption\nand falling depended on the level of consumption, which is\nsuggestive of the nonlinear association seen between alcohol\nconsumption and cognition (Rodgers et al., 2005). Previous\nstudies have shown that depressive symptoms are associated\nwith some of the physical function measures used in the ALSA\n(Penninx et al., 1998). Depressive symptoms are associated\nwith antidepressant use and with cognitive decline (Wilson,\nMendes De Leon, Bennett, Bienias, & Evans, 2004), which has\nin turn been associated with fall risk (Anstey et al., 2006).\nTherefore, by controlling for these potential confounds, the\npresent study presents a robust finding in relation to well-being\nand falls.\nOur third hypothesis was that the effect of well-being\nwould be reduced after we adjusted for the large number of\ncovariates in our models. This hypothesis was weakly\nsupported, in that effect sizes did reduce, but in several cases\nthey remained quite substantial in clinical terms as well as\nstatistical terms. For example, in the marginal models, even\nafter we adjusted for all covariates, a reduction of 1 point on\nthe Morale scale was associated with a 6% increase in fall rate\nover 8 years. This suggests that the effect of well-being on\nfalling was not due to indirect effects in terms of its effect on\nthe measures of health and sensorimotor function included in\nthis study.\nStudy limitations include the lack of a clinical diagnosis of\ndepression, and the retrospective, self-report nature of our falls\nmeasure. This was overcome somewhat by the exclusion of\nparticipants with possible dementia and the consistency of\nresults across analyses. The strengths of the study include the\nlarge sample size, multiple follow-ups over a long interval, and,\ncompared with previous studies, the adjustment for a wide\nrange of potentially confounding variables. Moreover, to our\nknowledge this is the first study to include time-varying\nmeasures of well-being in predicting falls in a population-based\nsample over a prolonged period.\nThe results of the present study may be viewed within the\nbroader context of the association between psychological and\nphysical well-being in later life. The fact that morale predicted\nfalling suggests that researchers should expand the conceptu-\nalization of risk factors for functional outcomes to consider the\npsychosocial context of the individual. Just as social support is\nprotective against dementia (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, &\nWinblad, 2004), so might strategies to enhance psychological\nwell-being protect against falling in late life. The Philadelphia\nGeriatric Center Morale Scale has been associated with\nneighborhood and social characteristics (Breeze et al., 2005)\nand is used as a measure of quality of life (Wong, Woo, Hui, &\nHo, 2004). Compared with morale, the influence of depressive\nsymptoms on fall risk may be more driven by biologically\nbased mechanisms, particularly those that contribute to poor\nconcentration and reduction in energy levels. It is possible that\ndeficits in executive function associated with depression are\nalso associated with an increase in the risk of falling (Holtzer\nPotential mechanisms for the association between well-being\nand falls may include shared biological factors operationalized\nas allostatic load. Better self-monitoring and chronic disease\nmanagement resulting from higher levels of psychological well-\nbeing may be protective against accidental falls. Other factors\nnot examined in this study such as neighborhood, social\nsupport, and access to recreation and services may also\ncontribute to the overall psychosocial context that predisposes\nindividuals to falling.\nAn indication of the need for research on psychosocial\nfactors associated with falls is seen by surveying the recent\nCochrane review of interventions to prevent falling (Gillespie\net al., 2003). That review identified studies of exercise,\nimprovements in home safety, medication withdrawal, nutri-\ntional and hormone supplementation, vision assessments,\ncardiac pacing, and multifactorial interventions, but psychoso-\ncial interventions were not included.\nThe results of this study suggest that falls-risk assessments\nshould include brief measures of well-being. Psychosocial\ninterventions that focus on improving positive aspects of well-\nbeing, as well as reducing depressive symptoms, may also\nreduce the incidence and prevalence of falls in older adults.\n"
