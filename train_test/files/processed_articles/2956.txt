Taxes and profit shifting\nTax competition between countries may be conceived of in different ways. A\ncommon conception is that countries or regions employ tax instruments to attract or keep\nfirms. But even without firm relocation a country may benefit from lowering taxes if this\ninduces multinational firms to shift taxable profits to this country. Firms may achieve such\nincome shifting by using prices for intra-company sales that depart from arms' length\nconditions, by agreeing on excessive management and overhead fees, by setting non-market\ninterest rates within a group, etc. There are also limits to profit shifting behavior.\nGovernments, in particular in high tax countries, may try to limit the allowable transfer\npricing strategies and this may even lead to a double taxation.1 In addition, firms themselves\nmay find it difficult to set tax efficient prices if this leads to confusion in the accounts of\nprofit centers and problems in the remuneration of managers (Caves 1982, pp. 246-7), or if\nminority shareholders resist.\nStarting in the early 1990s, a growing literature has tried to empirically identify tax\nmotivated profit shifting.2 So far, the studies have almost exclusively concentrated on U.S.\ndata. The debate has been stirred by Wheeler (1988) und Dworin (1990) with the simple\nobservation that foreign-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. have a smaller profitability than\ngenuine U.S. firms. Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993) showed that at least 50% of\nthe difference could be explained by the special characteristics of foreign-owned firms. For\nexample, those firms on average are younger than domestic firms or may have special write-\noffs following a foreign takeover. The authors suggest that the reminder of the difference in\nprofitability is due to profit shifting activities.3 Harris et al. (1993) analyze the profitability\n2 Useful surveys on profit shifting and related aspects of international tax issues are contained in recent papers\n3 In an unpublished revision of Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993), Grubert (1997) found a considerably\nreduced difference between U.S. and foreign-owned firms.\nof U.S. parent firms and find that parents with subsidiaries in low-tax countries have a\nsignificantly lower return than parents with high-tax affiliates, which is compatible with\nprofit shifting activities. Grubert and Mutti (1991) use aggregated data from the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis and find that profits on sales of U.S. subsidiaries are higher in low-tax\ncountries than in high tax countries.4\nOne of the interesting empirical facts reported in Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson\nterms of total assets that was near to zero. Conversely, only 27% of the domestic firms fell\ninto the same zero range from -2.5% to +2.5%. This issue is taken up in Collins, Kemsley\nand Shackelford (1997) who concentrate on a sample of foreign-owned and non foreign-\nowned wholesale firms. Their working hypothesis is that if foreign-controlled firms (unlike\ndomestic firms) target zero profitability, then an (exogenous) increase in sales should go\nalong with a smaller increase in profitability compared to domestic firms. The reason is that,\nwhile higher sales per se are good for profits, foreign firms would counteract by charging\nhigher prices on intra-firm trade. The findings of Collins, Kemsley and Shackleford do not\nsupport the view that foreign controlled firms have a significantly weaker correlation\nbetween sales and profits. Based on this observation the authors suggest that systematic\ndifferences between domestic and foreign firms rather than income shifting may be the\nreason for the near zero profitability of many foreign-controlled U.S. firms.5\nHines and Rice (1994) use 1982 country level data on U.S. affiliates. Their profit\nmeasure approximates earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The empirical results\nsuggest that a one percentage point increase in the host country tax rate reduces reported\nEBIT of U.S. affiliates by some 3 percent. Finally, Huizinga and Laeven (2005) in a recent\npaper use a micro data set of European based subsidiaries. Like in Hines and Rice, they\n4 U.S. studies using mostly smaller firm samples include Klassen, Lang and Wolfson (1993), Jacob (1996),\n5 A recent study that uses a quite different approach is by Bartelsman and Beetsma (2003). Instead of using\nspecific data on multinationals, however, they consider aggregate industry data of OECD countries to detect\ntax effects on the size of value added.\nconsider a cross-section (1999) of firms and study the effect of tax differentials on reported\nEBIT. Their findings suggest that, while the estimated tax effect is considerably smaller than\nin Hines and Rice, profit shifting implies a significant revenue loss for high tax countries,\nGermany in particular.\nIn this paper, I use the MiDi database of the Deutsche Bundesbank on German\ninbound and outbound FDI to empirically detect profit shifting. While the above discussion\nof the literature has made clear that there have been several attempts to empirically identify\nprofit shifting behavior of multinationals, this paper is one of the first micro-based studies\nwith non-U.S. data.\nWhile there are many potential influences on firm profitability, a first hypothesis is\nthat the lower the tax rate of a foreign parent is vis a vis the rate that is applicable to its\nGerman affiliate, the more profitable it will be to shift the profits of the affiliate to the home\ncountry of the parent. Therefore the profitability of the German affiliate may be positively\ncorrelated with the home country tax rate. The paper also looks at the effects that the foreign\ntax rate has on the profitability of German subsidiaries abroad. A problem here is that the\ndatabase of German FDI does only record net-of-tax profits of subsidiaries, which at a given\npre-tax profitability automatically react negatively to a tax rate increase. Therefore the paper\nwill formulate hypotheses how co-ownership of foreign subsidiaries may influence profit\nshifting. Under certain conditions the testable hypothesis can be formulated that tax rate\nchanges have a more pronounced effect on wholly-owned subsidiaries as compared to non-\nwholly owned ones.\nThe strongest evidence for profit shifting behavior is found for inbound FDI. For\nprofitable subsidiaries that are directly owned by a foreign investor the evidence suggests\nthat a 10 percentage point increase in the parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half\na percentage point increase in the profitability of the German affiliate.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates a stylized\nmodel of profit shifting that will formulate testable hypotheses. Section 3 will briefly\nintroduce the data used in this paper before Section 4 will econometrically analyze German\ninbound FDI and Section 5 will look at German outbound investment. Section 6 concludes.\n2. A stylized model of profit shifting\nOne characteristic of the MiDi database, which will be described in more detail in the\nnext section, is that it collects net of tax profits, but no information on pre-tax profits.\nAnother issue is that MiDi contains little information on the parent firms apart from\ninformation on their country of origin. In the light of these data limitations, the following\nmodel is set up to develop hypotheses about the observed subsidiaries that indeed can be\ntested with the help of the German panel data set.\nConsider a multinational with a parent firm in country H that owns a single affiliate\nin the destination country D. Country D taxes reported profits at rate tD\n. Country H is\nassumed to exempt foreign profits earned in country D, but taxes domestic profits (and any\nprofits that are shifted into country H) at the rate tH\n. Since Germany uses an exemption\nsystem towards foreign dividends, this assumption is justified if we think of Germany as the\nhome country H. In the case where Germany is acting as the host country (D) the assumption\nis obviously appropriate in the case of investing countries that also use an exemption system.\nIf the investing country uses a credit system of taxation, then effective exemption still occurs\nif the parent in the home country is in an excessive credit position. An excessive credit\nposition applies if the foreign taxes underlying the foreign dividends received by a parent\nare higher than the taxes that would apply had the parent earned the equivalent income at\nhome. Since Germany is a high tax host country, such a situation is the norm and a credit\nsystem in the home country of the multinational may then be approximated by an exemption\nsystem.\nLet there be a level of \"true\" profits that would prevail in H and G in the absence of\nprofit shifting activities (fH\n, fD\n). The only decision variable of the multinational shall be the\nnet amount S of profits that is shifted from D to country H. A negative amount of S then\nindicates profit shifting into D. Shifting profits from a high tax jurisdiction to a low tax\njurisdiction may save taxes but may also imply a cost for the multinational. For example,\nspecial activities may be necessary to hide the profit shifting. I assume that this cost is\nincurred by the plant that reduces its profitability. This assumption reflects that legal costs\nthat arise when inadequate transfer prices are contested by minority shareholders or tax\nauthorities will occur in the country where profits have been diminished.6 That is, the cost\ncH\n(S) falls on the parent if the profit is shifting from the home country into D and cD\n(T,) is\nincurred by the affiliate if the shifting is out of the host country. Here  denotes the fraction\nof shares of the host country affiliate that are held by other investors.7 The respective cost is\nassumed to be convex in the absolute amount of shifting.\nIf the shifting is from D to H, then the existence of other investors (who may resist\nthe manipulations) makes profit shifting increasingly costly, while this is not the case if the\nother investors gain from profit shifting.8 Therefore, cH\n, unlike cD\n, is taken to be independent\nof . The assumptions on the shifting cost may be summarized as follows:\n/\n/\n,\n/\n,\n/\n,\n/\n)\n(\n/\n,\n/\n,\n)\n(\n=\n\n\n>\n>\n\n\n\n\n>\n\n\n\n\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n<\n>\n\n\n<\n\n\n\n=\n=\nS\ni\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nH\nH\nH\nS\nc\nS\nif\nS\nc\nS\nc\nS\nc\nS\nc\nS\nif\nS\nc\nS\nif\nS\nc\nS\nc\nS\nif\nS\nc\nGlobal net of tax profits, which are assumed to form the objective function of the\nmultinational, are given by\nH\nD\nS\nc\nS\nf\nt\nS\nc\nS\nf\nt\nP\nH\nH\nH\nD\nD\nD\n\n\n\n\n-\n+\n-\n+\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n= ))\n(\n)((\n(\n))\n,\n(\n)(\n(\n)\n(\n6 See Edwards and Weichenrieder (2004, p. 147-9) for a legal discussion of the corporate governance issues\nthat arise when transfer pricing hurts minority shareholders.\n7 For simplicity, the fraction of ownership is assumed to be exogenously determined by firm characteristics.\n8 Co-ownership has been shown to be empirically important for the tax influence on related-party debt (Mintz\nDifferentiation of P w.r.t.

But since \u00b2\n/\n)\n,\n(\nS\nc\nD\n\n\n increases in , there is also a higher cost of\nshifting profits home and the net effect is unclear.\nThe empirical parts of this paper will exploit information on the net of tax profits.\nNet-of-tax profits D\nand H\nin the model are defined by equation (2). Given the slope\ndefined by equation (4), the reaction of the reported net of tax profit in D is may be rewritten\nas\n]\n)\n)(\n(\n[\n/\n)\n,\n(\n)\n(\nd\nd\n>\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n=\n\nD\nH\nD\nH\nD\nt\nt\nT\nS\nc\nt\n,\n9 Outside ownership has also been considered in the theoretical work by Kant (1988).

For the later empirical\ninvestigation it would be helpful to also have a clear testable prediction about the role of\noutside shareholders on the size of this tax effect. But, like in equation (4), the role of\nminority shareholders is ambiguous.\nNow consider the impact of a change in the tax rate tD\non the reported profits D\n.\nAgain I start from the first order condition (3) to derive the tax rate effect.

Whether this slope should be expected to differ for\nsubsidiaries with different  is unclear.

The impact of  on this slope is unclear for two reasons. First, the expression in equation\n(7), which re-enters if (8) is differentiated w.r.t. , cannot be signed. Second, it may be that\nthe pre-tax profit ( )\nD\nD\nc\nS\nf -\n- depends on .\nIt is useful to summarize the results for Case A (S > 0) in a non-technical\nproposition.\nPROPOSITION 1: If the profit shifting incentives lead to an upward manipulation of\nhome country profits and a downward manipulation of profits in the host country,\nthen an increase in the host (home) country tax rate should reduce (increase) reported\nprofits of the foreign affiliate. It is theoretically unclear how co-ownership influences\nthe magnitudes of these effects.\nCase B: Incentives to shift profits abroad.\nIf the home country is a high tax country, then the incentives are to shift profits abroad (S <\n0) as long as co-ownership is limited: 0\n)\n)(\n(\n)\n( <\n-\n-\n-\n-\nD\nH\nt\nt  . The first order condition\nin this case is 0\n)\n/(\n)\n)(\n(\n/\n)\n( <\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n=\n\n\nH\nD\nH\nt\nt\nS\nS\nc and implicit differentiation yields:\n/\n)\n(\n)\n(\n/\n)\n/\n)\n(\n(\nd\n/\nd <\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n-\n= S\nS\nc\nt\nS\nS\nc\nt\nS\nH\nH\nH\nH\n.\nAs long as case B applies, an increase in the home country tax rate will make S more\nnegative, i.e. it will increase profit shifting. Since cH\nis independent of , so is the slope\ndT/dtH\n. It is easy to verify, that if profits (fD\n\u00ad S) are independent of the co-ownership\nvariable , then the marginal effect of tH\non net-of-tax profits will also be independent of .\nFrom the first order condition, [ ] 0\n/\n)\n(\n)\n(\n/\n)\n(\nd\n/\nd >\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n= S\nS\nc\nt\nt\nS\nH\nH\nD\n. Clearly,\nif the profit shifting incentives are such that profits are shifted into the affiliate, then an\nincreased taxation of the affiliate will reduce this incentive and make S less negative. Unlike\nin Case A, the impact of  can now be signed: ( ) 0\nd\n/\nd\n/\nd\nd <\n\nD\nt\nS . An increase in the co-\nownership abroad lowers the (absolute) marginal effect of a change in the host country tax.\nAn intuition behind this is that a fraction of a tax decrease abroad is benefiting other\nshareholders of the affiliate, which makes this increase less effective for the decisions of the\nmultinational. What are the implications for reported net of tax profitability? From the\ndefinition of the affiliate's net of tax profit and cD\n= 0 it follows:\n)\n/\n)(\n(\nd\n/\nd <\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n=\n\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nt\nS\nt\nS\nf\nt .\nWhen tD\nincreases net-of-tax profits fall for two reasons. First, an increase in the tax rate\nreduces net profitability for a given amount of profit shifting. Second, profit shifting into the\naffiliate is reduced. Since net of tax profits, which will be the focus of the econometric\nanalysis, are reduced even in the absence of profit shifting it is important to have a testable\nhypothesis on how the slope in equation (10) depends on . If the profit (fD\n\u00ad S) of the\naffiliate is independent of co-ownership, then from ( ) 0\nd\n/\nd\n/\nd\nd <\n\nD\nt\nS it follows that\n.\n)\n/(\n\n\n\n\n\nD\nD\nt Increased co-ownership in this case would reduce the impact of tax rate\nchanges on profitability. The above results may be summarized in a non-technical way as\nfollows.\nPROPOSITION 2: If the profit shifting incentives lead to a downward manipulation\nof home country profits and an upward manipulation of profits in the host country,\nthen an increase in the host (home) country tax rate should reduce (increase) reported\nnet-of-tax profits of the foreign affiliate. Under the assumption that pre-tax profits\nare not dependent on co-ownership, co-ownership should reduce the effect of the\nhost country tax rate on reported net of tax profitability.\nThe two propositions of this section suggest an asymmetry in the effect that co-\nownership has on the amount of shifting. Given that the profit shifting benefits the affiliate,\nco-ownership is expected to limit the effect of a tax rate change in the host country on the\namount of profit shifting. Intuitively, co-ownership makes this reaction to tax rate changes\nmore expensive because co-owners participate in the increased profit. Conversely, co-\nownership does not necessarily dampen the effects of a tax rate increase in the home country\nof the parent if the profit shifting is benefiting the parent's profit: while co-ownership per se\nincreases profit shifting incentives, it also implies a resistance to such behavior if it comes at\na cost to co-owners.\n3. The data\nGerman investors owning foreign affiliates are legally required to report on their\nforeign operations if it meets mild size and ownership requirements. Conversely, foreign-\ncontrolled affiliates that operate in Germany have to report on these German operations. The\nfirm reports are the basis for the FDI database of the Deutsche Bundesbank (MiDi).10 Most\nof the information in the data refers to a set of balance sheet items. On the liability side there\nis information on paid-up plus not paid-up equity, capital reserves, loss carry-forwards,\ncurrent profits net of taxes, debt, liabilities to affiliated companies, and other liabilities. On\nthe asset side, information is collected on fixed assets plus intangibles, financial assets\n(shares, loans), current assets, and other assets. Important non-balance-sheet items that are\ncollected by the Bundesbank are sales and employees.\nAn unusual feature of the MiDi balance sheets is that they contain the yearly profit\nafter taxes but before dividend distributions as a separate part of the equity of the firm.\nTherefore, the balance sheets provide information on profitability despite the fact that the\ndatabase does not contain formal profit and loss statements.\nMicro data on foreign direct investment are available for years since 1989 but firm\nidentifiers that allow for the tracing of firms over time are available only from 1996\nonwards. Nevertheless, the ability to trace firms over up to 8 years is an important advantage\nover other data sources on FDI and can be used to avoid possible biases from cross-section\nestimates.\nFor the purpose of this study, I dropped affiliates if these were either operating in\nnot-for-profit sectors or were not incorporated. I also excluded affiliates in the banking and\ninsurance industries and holding companies to avoid problems connected to the very\ndifferent balance sheet structure of financial firms. On the outbound side, this results in\nBundesbank data to analyze the financial structure of German inward FDI and Mintz and Weichenrieder\n(2005) look at the financing of outward FDI. Buettner and Ruf (2004) use the database to study taxes and\nlocation decisions of German multinationals.\n11 I also dropped a limited number of observations for which we failed to collect reliable tax rate information\non the home country (host country) if the affiliate was located in Germany (abroad). Finally, since the legally\napplied reporting thresholds varied between 1996 and 2003 I filtered the sample by imposing uniform size\nimpression of the total assets involved. The first two columns summarize the inbound side,\nwhile columns 3 and 4 inform about the magnitudes on the outbound side. In both cases I\ndecided to follow the Bundesbank convention to separately account for directly and\nindirectly held affiliates. On the inbound side, the affiliate is indirectly held if the immediate\ninvestor is a foreign-owned intermediate company that is located in Germany. An affiliate is\ndirectly held if the immediate owner is a foreign investor. The definitions differ a bit on the\noutbound side. Here a German-owned foreign affiliate is defined as an indirectly held\nparticipation if the ownership chain contains at least one foreign company between the\nGerman investor and the foreign affiliate. This foreign intermediate company may or may\nnot be in the country of the ultimate company. Conversely, the affiliate is directly held if no\nintermediate foreign company is used.\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics of German inbound and outbound FDI (2003)\nInbound FDI Outbound FDI\nDirect Indirect Direct Indirect\nTotal assets, average\n( million)\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 summarize the distribution of net-of-tax returns on total\nassets. Each of the four graphs contains 5 lines that represent the return on total assets\n(ROA) in the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th centile of firms. Again the categories \"direct\" and\n\"indirect\" are reported separately. Indeed, firms in these categories show a sizeable\ndifference in ROA when it comes to inbound German FDI. Indirectly held firms have a\nlower spread in returns and more often show near zero profitability. If we look at a \"near-\nzero band\" between -2.5% and +2.5% similar to Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993),\nrestrictions (total assets 3m for majority participations and 5.1m in the case of minority stakes) during this\nperiod.\nwe find that in 2003 from the total of all directly held affiliates (inbound) 36% fall in this\nrange, while for the indirectly held firms it is even a majority of some 72%.12\nFigure 1.Net-of-tax return on total assets: inbound FDI\nFigure 1a: Return on total Assets, directly-held affiliates Figure 1b: Return on total Assets, indirectly-held affiliates\nAnnotation: In each graph, the bold line indicates the return on assets of the median non-financial firm.

The left hand diagram refers to the subsample of\nfirms that are directly held by a foreign firm, while the graph on the right hand refers to firms in Germany that\nare foreign held via a German intermediate company.\nFigure 2.

The left hand diagram refers to the subsample of\nfirms that are directly held by a German parent firm, while the graph on the right hand refer to firms that are\nheld via a German-owned intermediate company outside Germany.\nThe fact that this high fraction of firms with more or less zero profitability is pretty\nconstant over the years may fuel the suspicion that advanced tax planning is the reason\n12 Grubert, Goodspeed and Swenson use taxable profits (instead of net of tax profits) to total assets to define\nthe band.\nbehind these figures. However, the high fraction of affiliates with zero profitability among\nindirectly held affiliates at least partly results from specific data problems. While the\nBundesbank requests firms to report profits net of taxes but before distributions, some\nindirectly held firms may fail to report profits that are transferred to the owner on the basis\nof a corporate contract. Under such a corporate contract the dependent company may agree\nto transfer all profits and losses to the upper-tier corporation in order to achieve profit and\nloss consolidation for tax purposes. Consolidation not only requires the existence of such a\ncontract. Germany also restricts consolidation of profits and losses within a group to cases in\nwhich a German umbrella company is a majority owner of the dependent firm, i.e. an\nownership chain is necessary to establish a profit transfer agreement. While the Bundesbank\nrequires firms to report their profits before distribution, I found strong empirical evidence\nthat many indirectly held firms report figures that are net of profit transfers to the umbrella\ncompany and therefore decided to drop indirectly held firms in the analysis of inbound FDI.\nUnlike the data for indirect inbound FDI, the profit data for German outbound investment\npresented in Figure 2 show no bunching at zero profitability and the reporting of zero\nprofitability of indirectly held firms did only weakly correlate with the opportunity to\nconsolidate profits in the relevant host country. For this reason, indirectly held firms were\nkept in the analysis of outbound investment.\n4. Profit shifting and the profitability of German inbound FDI\nSince during the observed period Germany is a high tax country by international\ncomparison, the results derived for the case A (see Section 2, S > 0) are considered relevant\nfor the profitability of inflowing FDI. According to Proposition 1, which assumes profitable\nmultinationals, the foreign corporate tax rate in the country of the parent is then expected to\npositively affect the profitability of a German affiliate. Whether this effect should be\nexpected to be larger for wholly-owned versus partly-owned affiliates is unclear from\nProposition 1.\nTo test these implications I use a subsample of incorporated non-financial firms in\nGermany that on average across all firm observations show a positive profitability. The\nendogenous variable is return on assets (ROA), where the return is measured by the net-of-\ntax profits after interest payments (but before dividends). Because of the data problems\ndiscussed in Section 3, I concentrate on firms that are directly held by a foreign investor.\nTable 2 gives a summary statistics of this sample that contains 3788 firms that on average\nare observed over 4.7 years. Despite the fact that the sample is built by excluding firms that\non average show non-positive profitability, the profitability measure shows a huge spread\nbetween -407 percent and 321 percent. To limit the impact of outliers I use a winsorized\nvariable W_ROA that has been derived by setting the top and the lowest 5% of the\nobservations to the 5th and 95th percentile of ROA, respectively. The average tax rate in the\nhome country of the German affiliate is 34.7%.13 WHOLLY is an indicator variable with\nvalue one if the foreign investor holds 100 percent of the German firm and zero otherwise.\nThis variable is also used to create interactive variables. CT_WHOLLY takes on the value\nof the home country tax rate if the affiliate is wholly owned, and zero otherwise.\nAnalogously, CTGER_WHOLLY results from multiplying the German corporate tax rate\nwith the variable WHOLLY. DEBT_RATIO is defined as the ratio of debt to total assets that\nin some cases exceeds 100 percent. This can occur if the firm under consideration has loss\ncarry forwards. To limit the impact of those outliers, the regressions use a winsorized\nvariable, W_DEBT_RATIO.\n13 On average, the parent firms of the German affiliates over the observed years experienced a maximum\nabsolute change in the home country corporate tax rate of 4.4 percentage points. In cases in which investors\nfrom different countries own a German corporation I used the rate for the largest investor. The tax rate\nemployed includes also average or representative local income taxes. It abstracts from tax base effects since\noptimal profit shifting decisions of profitable firms are independent of tax base effects.\nVariable Observations Firms Average Std.deviation Min Max\nSince random effects models did not pass a Hausman test, the tax effects were\nestimated using a fixed effects model. Table 3 reports the regression results. The German tax\nrate could not be entered in the model as all firms are subject to the same rate in a given year\nand year fixed effects are also included. Model (1) starts with a parsimonious specification\nusing the foreign tax rate, fixed firm and time effects, plus the logarithms of employment,\nsales, and fixed assets.14 The variable of prime interest, CT, which measures the corporate\ntax rate of the foreign parent, turns out significant at the six percent level. The coefficient of\n0.049 implies that an increase in the tax rate of the parent by ten percentage points increases\nthe return on assets of a German affiliate by approximately half a percentage point, which\namounts to roughly ten percent of the average profitability in the sample. This evidence is in\nline with profit shifting behavior and Proposition 1. Employment does not enter\nsignificantly, while sales enter significantly positive. The size of fixed assets enters\nnegatively, which may result from large depreciation allowances of investing firms.\nModel (2) uses the same specification but adds the variable W_DEBT_RATIO. Since\nadditional debt increases the interest cost of an affiliate, the significant negative coefficient\nis in line with expectations. Inclusion of the debt ratio leads only to a small change in the\ncoefficient of CT. By including the leverage variable the coefficient of CT measures the\neffect of the tax rate that prevailed when leverage was held constant. Therefore, changes in\n14 To be precise, the value for fixed assets also includes intangible assets as these are compounded in the\nBundesbank questionnaires.\nthe profit shifting activities that are induced by a change in CT seem to result only to a\nlimited extent from the use of debt. This is in line with the previous observation that the\nparent tax rate does not significantly influence the leverage decision of foreign owned\naffiliates in Germany (Ramb and Weichenrieder 2005).\nTable 3: Foreign tax rate and domestic profitability\nAnnotations: ***significant at 1%-level, **significant at 5%-level, *significant at 10%-level. P-values in\nbrackets are based on robust t-statistics (corrected for correlations within country cells and within firm cells).\nDependent variable: W_ROA. All regressions contained a full set of time and firm fixed effects; coefficients\nare not reported. W_DEBT_RATIO and W_ROA have been winsorized. To avoid losing firms with zero\nemployment, sales, or fixed assets in some year, I added a small constant before taking logs. For sake of\npresentation, logs have been entered in one tenth of a percent.\nAccording to Proposition 1, the effect of co-owners on the impact of a change in tax\nrates is unclear. Models (3) and (4) include variables that are constructed by interacting the\nGerman and the foreign tax rates with the dummy WHOLLY. The objective is to empirically\ninvestigate whether co-ownership matters for the size of the tax effects. The effect of\nownership on the size of the tax effects turns out to be not only theoretically undetermined\nbut also empirically insignificant. Finally, the insignificance of WHOLLY does not suggest\nthat the net of tax profitability changes if firms have a change from partial to full ownership\nby a foreign investor and this is confirmed by employing a formal F-test using all variables\nin which the variable WHOLLY is included (p-values are 36% and 54% in equations (3) and\n6. The profitability of German outbound FDI\nI now turn to the outbound side of German FDI. Given the high German tax rates a\nmajor concern is that German multinationals have an incentive to shift profits abroad to\nrepatriate these profits as a tax free dividend. This is a concern that corresponds to the Case\nB in Section 3.\nOf course a straightforward approach would be to test whether foreign taxes\ninfluence the pre-tax profitability of German owned foreign affiliates. The problem in doing\nso is that the Bundesbank database only contains net-of-tax profits. Therefore, it is\nimpossible to identify whether a reduction in a foreign affiliate's observed return is due to a\nchange in profit shifting activities or is simply caused by higher taxation at constant pre-tax\nearnings. However, there is another prediction of the model in Section 3 that indeed can be\ntested. If the incentives are to shift profits abroad, then, according to Proposition 2, co-\nownership should lead to a reduced impact of the foreign tax rate if co-ownership by itself\nhas no impact on profitability. This contrasts with the case in which co-investors have an\nincentive to resist to profit shifting and the cost of profit shifting was assumed to increase in\nthe amount of profit shifting.\nVariable Observations Firms Average Std.deviatio\nn\nMin Max\nTable 5: Differential effects of the host country tax rate\nAnnotations: ***significant at 1%-level, **significant at 5%-level, *significant at 10%-level. P-values in\nbrackets are based on robust t-statistics (corrected for correlations within country cells and within firm cells).\nDependent variable: W_ROA. All regressions contained a full set of time and firm fixed effects; coefficients\nare not reported. W_ROA and W_DEBT-RATIO are winsorized versions of ROW and DEBT-RATIO. To\navoid losing firms with zero employment, sales, or fixed assets in some years, I added a small constant before\ntaking logs. For sake of presentation, logs have been entered in one tenth of a percent.\nLike in Section 5, I concentrate on affiliates that on average show a positive\nprofitability. Table 4 gives the summary statistics for important variables. As on the inbound\nside, the return on total assets shows a huge variation that is obviously unrelated to taxation\nand the regressions below will therefore use the winsorized variable W_ROA. CT is now\ncharacterizing the corporate tax rate applicable to profits of the German-owned affiliate\nabroad. Using the dummy WHOLLY that takes on the value one if the German investor\nholds a 100% participation, I created the variable CT_WHOLLY = CT * WHOLLY in\naddition to using the simple host country corporate income tax, CT. Of course, the impact\nCT is expected to be negative: an increased tax rate should reduce the net of tax profitability\nas long as a potentially accompanying tax base broadening does not overcompensate the\neffect of tax cuts.15 Proposition 2 suggests that the coefficient of CT_WHOLLY should also\nbe negative reflecting that firms without co-investors find it easier to adapt to tax rate\nchanges than other firms.\nTable 5 contains two regression results using fixed effects models. While model (2)\ncontains a variable for the leverage of the affiliate, model (1) omits such a variable. Apart\nfrom this, there are no differences in the specifications.\nLike in section 5, there is no evidence that the fact that a firm is wholly-owned\ncorrelates with profitability. The sign of CT is consistent with expectations: an increase in\nthe tax rate of the host country reduces profitability. The coefficient is not significant,\nthough, suggesting that a large fraction of the effects of rate reductions may be outweighed\nby accompanying tax base adjustments. The main variable of interest is CT_WHOLLY,\nwhich turns out to be negative and statistically significant at the 8 percent level in model (1).\nIn line with Proposition 2, this suggests that wholly-owned firms indeed do react more\nstrongly than co-owned affiliates.\nThe German tax rate cannot be tested when time fixed effects are included as it is\nidentical for all firms in a given year. The variable CTGER_WHOLLY measures the\ndifferential effect of the German tax rate for wholly owned affiliates as compared to non-\nwholly owned subsidiaries. It shows a positive sign but is not significant at conventional\nlevels. This is consistent with the model that has not suggested a systematic correlation.\nUnlike in the inbound sample, LN_EMPLOYMENT has a positive effect on\nprofitability, while the control variables LN_SALES and LN_FIXEDASSETS have a\ncorresponding sign: positive for sales and negative for the amount of fixed assets.16 Finally,\ntwo variables are added that represent the macroeconomic situation in the host country. As a\n15 I do not observe information on the tax base of foreign subsidiaries.\n16 Like on the inbound side, LN_FIXEDASSETS include intangible assets as these are compounded in the\nBundesbank questionnaires.\nmeasure of the local performance off the real economy, GDPGROWTH enters positively:\naffiliates in high growth countries are enjoying a significantly higher return on assets.\nBesides real growth also the financial macroeconomic situation may affect profitability.\nDOMPRIVCRED, which measures the domestic private credit to GDP ratio and captures the\nliquidity of local loan markets, does not show up to be significant.\nIf the negative coefficient of CT_WHOLLY is interpreted as evidence for profit\nshifting activities the question arises as to what extent this profit shifting may be due to a\ndifferent financial structure. Since the dependent variable is a measure of the return on total\nassets, interest on additional debt, which an increased local tax rate may induce, will reduce\nprofits and decrease this measure. Inclusion of a variable for the debt to asset ratio in model\n(2) should control for this latter effect. Indeed the inclusion of W_DEBT_RATIO decreases\nthe impact of CT_WHOLLY and renders the estimated coefficient insignificant. This change\nsuggests that some part of the profit reaction that is induced by a lower foreign tax rate CT\nresults from a reduced leverage. These results are in line with the finding of Mintz and\nWeichenrieder (2005) that the foreign tax rates significantly influences the intra-company\nloans granted by a German parent, but much less so if the foreign affiliate is co-owned by\nother investors. The estimated coefficient of -0.109 implies that an increase of the debt to\nasset ratio by one percentage point is associated with a reduction of the ROA by some 0.11\npercentage points.\n6. Summary\nThe paper has taken two approaches to identify profit shifting behavior. In a first step, it has\nlooked at the correlation between the home country tax rate of a parent and the net of tax\nprofitability of its German affiliate. The finding is compatible with profit shifting behavior.\nFor profitable affiliates the evidence suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in the\nparent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half a percentage point increase in the\nprofitability of the German affiliate.\nIn a second step the paper has analyzed German outbound FDI. Given the high tax\nrates of German parents by international standards, the profitability of German-owned\naffiliates abroad may benefit from profit shifting. Since pre-tax profits are not observed in\nthe German FDI data, the empirical test looks at whether the local tax rates of German-\nowned affiliates have a stronger impact on wholly-owned affiliates. While such a differential\neffect seems to be present if leverage is excluded as an explanatory variable, the significance\nof the distinction between wholly-owned and partly-owned affiliates is blurred if leverage is\nentered in the regression.\nBibliography\nBartelsmann, E.J. and R.M.
