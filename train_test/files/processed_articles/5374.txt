For example, Stephen Jay Gould asserts the most that\nevolutionary studies can hope to do is set out the conditions under which certain\nmorals or values might have arisen, but it can say nothing about the validity of such\nvalues, on pain of committing the Naturalistic Fallacy. Such questions of moral\nvalidity, he continues, are best left in the domain of religion. This is a common\ncritique of evolutionary ethics but it is based on an insufficient appreciation of the full\nimplications of the Naturalistic Fallacy. Broadly conceived, the Naturalistic Fallacy\nrules out any attempt to treat morality as defined according to some pre-existent\nreality, whether that reality is expressed in natural or non-natural terms. Consequent\nto this is that morality must be treated as a product of natural human interactions. As\nsuch, any discipline which sheds light on the conditions under which values originate,\nand on the workings of moral psychology, may play a crucial role in questions of\nmoral validity. The authors contend that rather than being a constraint on\nevolutionary approaches to ethics, the Naturalistic Fallacy, so understood, clears the\nway, conceptually, for just such an approach.\n",

The NF prohibits deriving value statements from purely\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nfactual statements about the way the world is. Since evolutionary studies seek to\nprovide strictly factual statements about the world it seems, to many, to follow that\nsuch studies cannot provide the basis for an ethical system. There are many variations\nof this claim and a great debate on the topic. In order to focus on the salient aspects of\nthis issue we will focus on one particular version of this objection, that presented by\nnoted evolutionary thinker, the late Stephen Jay Gould.\nGould addresses the issue of evolution and ethics in his work entitled Rocks of\nAges: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life (1999). In that work he sets out a\nprinciple that sets the boundaries between science and religion, which he terms\nNOMA, i.e. Non-Overlapping Magisteria. A magisterium, Gould tells us, `is a\ndomain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful\ndiscourse and resolution.' (5) Science and religion, according to Gould, each have\ntheir respective magisterium where their teaching is authoritative, and it follows,\ngiven the logic of magisteria, that neither has any authority to teach in the other's\ndomain. The domain of science is the empirical world. As Gould says `Science tries\nto document the factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that\ncoordinate and explain these facts.' (4) The domain of religion is `the realm of human\npurposes, meanings, and values--subjects' he continues `that the factual domain of\nscience might illuminate, but can never resolve.'(4) The consequences of this setting\nof boundaries is that `religion can no longer dictate the nature of factual conclusions\nresiding properly within the magisterium of science' and that `scientists cannot claim\nhigher insight into moral truth from any superior knowledge of the world's empirical\nIt is this latter claim that directly concerns us here: that the superior knowledge of\nthe empirical nature of the world does not provide a higher insight into ethics than\nthat provided by non-empirical methods, such as religion. It is clear that the\nNaturalistic Fallacy lurks beneath this claim. Gould writes of ethics, that `fruitful\ndiscussion must proceed under a different magisterium, far older than science,' a\ndiscussion `about ethical \"ought,\" rather than a search for any factual \"is\" about the\nmaterial construction of the factual world.' (55)\nGould is really not adding anything new to this debate. (Nor, in all fairness, does\nhe claim to be. In fact Gould includes a lengthy footnote admitting that he\noversimplifies the topic, but justifies his use of the is/ought distinction as `broad-\nscale treatment' of a `central principle.' n55-57) Still, he does set out a useful schema\nfor understanding the issue. There are empirical facts about the world and there are\nvalue judgments about those facts. Facts are ascertained via the scientific method;\nreligion is barred from speaking about the empirical constitution of the world because\nit does not employ the scientific method. So far, so good. Then we see that science is\nbarred from speaking about values; but religion is not similarly barred--and why?\nBecause the line between facts and values is guarded by the NF and it is presumed\nthat the NF prohibits any scientific approach to ethics but passes through any\nreligious or philosophical approach (at least, any non-empirical philosophical\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nIt is here that we see a confusion which needs to be addressed to fully appreciate\nthe role of the NF in ethical theory. While it is true that the NF does prohibit a certain\nscientific approach to ethics, it does not follow that it prohibits any scientific\napproach. Furthermore, a deeper reading of the NF shows that it does not allow all\nreligious or philosophical approaches to ethics, but places a constraint on this\nmagisterium, as well. The thesis here is that once this confusion is cleared away we\nwill see that not only is an evolutionary approach to ethics permissible, but it may in\nfact be indispensable. In order to justify this final claim we must first delve into the\nII) Understanding the Naturalistic Fallacy\nWe find the first historical reference to the Naturalistic Fallacy in David Hume's\nTreatise of Human Nature in which he states:\nIn every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always\nremark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of\nreasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations\nconcerning human affairs: when of a sudden I am supriz'd to find, that instead\nof the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no\npropositions that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is\nimperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or\nought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, `tis necessary that it\nshou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a reason should be\ngiven, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a\ndeduction from others, which are entirely different from it. (469)\nScholars have generally taken this to mean that one cannot make logical inferences of\nvalue from observations of natural facts--at least, not without the inclusion of an\nadditional (suppressed or hidden) premise. \"Is\" does not imply \"ought\", as they say.\nIt has also been referred to as the Fact/Value Gap, but it reached its greatest\npopularity as the Naturalistic Fallacy in the Principia Ethica of G. E. Moore. Moore\nmaintained that any attempt to define \"good\" in naturalistic terms was fallacious. But\nas with many scholars, the intended meaning of an idea can become lost,\nmisrepresented, caricatured, etc., if we ignore the primary sources.\nFew realize that there is a feature in Moore's ethical system which is often\noverlooked and that is his claim that metaphysicians also commit the naturalistic\nfallacy. Understandably so, Moore dubbed his famous fallacy in order to reveal the\nproblems associated with defining Good in naturalistic terms. However, Moore\nstretches the boundaries of this fallacy by claiming that it applies to those who define\nGood in metaphysical terms, as well.\nIn the first chapter of his Principia, Moore states that any attempt to define Good\nin terms of natural properties commits the naturalistic fallacy. This, he believed, was\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\ndue to the unique nature of Good, which is, he claimed, indefinable. `\"Good\"...is\nincapable of any definition...\"good\" has no definition because it is simple and has no\nparts. It is one of those innumerable objects of thought which are themselves\nincapable of definition, because they are the ultimate terms by reference to which\nwhatever is capable of definition must be defined.' (9-10)\nNow, although Moore realizes that Good is not actually indefinable i.e. that no\ndefinition of it is possible, he is trying to point out that its elusive nature is the\nsubstantive to which any adjective of \"good\" must apply. In other words, although we\nmay experience many good things, that which is Good about these things is not found\nin their properties. To offer any definition of Good we may ask, says Moore, whether\nthat definition is good. This, of course, is Moore's open question argument. `If \"good\"\nwas definable it was a complex, and so it could be asked of any definiens if it was\ngood. After all, a definition should not be merely \"analytic,\" it should give\ninformation about the definiendum; therefore whatever definition is offered, it may\nalways be asked, with significance, of the complex so defined, whether it is itself\ngood.' (Hill, 99) Good is what it is and not another thing; anyone attempting to define\nit through the use of any natural properties commits the naturalistic fallacy.\nIn the fourth chapter of the Principia, Moore goes on to state that any\nmetaphysical definition of Good commits the naturalistic fallacy as well. Unlike\nnaturalists, metaphysicians did not believe that ethics could be explained in terms of\nnatural properties but instead believed, like Moore, that Good was a super-sensible\nproperty. Unlike Moore, however, the metaphysicians came under attack because\nthey tried to define Good as actually existing super-sensible objects. (Warnock, 28)\nThis is somewhat confusing due to the fact that Moore earlier defined Good as super-\nsensible and known only through intuition yet he also maintains that goodness does\nnot exist. The main difficulty with Moore's definition of Good seems to lie in its\nprecarious mode of existence. There is a similarity here between Moore's theory of\nGood and Plato's theory of Forms.\nMoore believed the central problem with the metaphysicians involved their\nattempt to equate Good with some super-sensible property such as the true self or the\nreal will.(Warnock, 32) In this respect they seem, prima facie, to have committed the\nnaturalistic fallacy (though not because they have equated Good with a natural\nproperty). As Frankena points out, Moore tends to confuse matters by lumping\nnatural and metaphysical properties into one class. Perhaps Frankena is correct in\nclaiming that Moore should have called it the `definist fallacy' i.e. the fallacy is\ncommitted when the attempt is made to define Good as a natural or a metaphysical\nproperty. (Cited in Warnock, 13) Mary Warnock points out that Moore didn't care\nmuch for the name: `It does not matter what we call it provided we recognize it when\nwe meet it; the true fallacy is the attempt to define the indefinable.' (Warnock, 13)\nNevertheless, an important distinction can be made between committing the\nnaturalistic fallacy by equating Good with a natural property and committing the\nnaturalistic fallacy by equating Good with a metaphysical property. What Moore is\nasserting is that any argument of the form:\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\n(1) \"Reality is of this nature\" \u00c6 \"This is good in itself\"\n(where \u00c6 designates \"implies\")\ncommits the naturalistic fallacy (NF). Since this differs in type from the attempt to\ndefine Good in terms of natural properties, we shall distinguish it by calling it the\nmetaphysical fallacy (MF). Though it differs in type (or species) from that of defining\nGood in terms of natural properties, we may consider it, as does Moore, to belong to\nthe overall genus of the naturalistic fallacy.\nIt has been suggested that Moore treats Good and the naturalistic fallacy in this\nmanner because if naturalistic or metaphysical definitions were synonymously\nidentified with Good, the autonomy of ethics would be destroyed: `If Good is\nidentified with some empirically verifiable biological tendency (say, what is more\nevolved) Ethics becomes a branch of biology. If Good is defined in psychological\nterms (say, whatever anyone prefers) Ethics becomes a branch of psychology. And\nso on.' (Regan, 201-202) If naturalistic or metaphysical definitions were synonymous\nwith Good, Regan states, Moore believed our freedom to judge intrinsic value would\nbe lost. For example, if Good means \"more evolved\" then there could be no room for\nindividual judgment about what sort of things ought to exist for their own sakes. In\nthis way, those that are most knowledgeable about what things are more evolved (i.e.\nbiologists), would become our authorities. The same holds true if Good is defined in\npsychological or metaphysical terms. If Good is not defined in either naturalistic or\nmetaphysical terms, the autonomy of the individual is assured:\nAt the deepest level it is the autonomy of the individual judgment about what\nhas intrinsic value, not the autonomy of the Science of Morals...Individuals\nmust judge for themselves what things ought to exist, what things are worth\nhaving for their own sakes. No natural science can do this. No metaphysical\nsystem can do this. (Regan, 204)\nMoore here articulates a more general concern over evolutionary ethics--that such an\nethics will somehow dictate to the individual what and how he or she ought to value.\nHowever, we will later argue that an evolutionary ethics based on a deeper\nunderstanding of the NF rules out any such concern. For now we can see that\nextending the NF to metaphysical definitions of the good poses a problem for\nGould's insistence on the exclusivity of the Religious Magisteria concerning ethics,\nand, we believe, creates an opening for evolutionary ethics.\nIII) Implications of the Naturalistic/Metaphysical Fallacy\nGiven this understanding of the Naturalistic Fallacy we can see that certain moves\nfrom facts to values are ruled out. For example, any attempt to read a value statement\ndirectly from a simple statement of fact would be to commit the NF. An instance of\nsuch a fallacious move can be found in a 1984 article by philosopher Michael Levin\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nentitled \"Why Homosexuality is Abnormal.\" In support of the notion that there is\nsomething \"unnatural\" about homosexuality Levin writes,\nThe erect penis fits the vagina, and fits it better than any other natural orifice;\npenis and vagina seem made for each other. This intuition ultimately derives\nfrom, or is another way of capturing, the idea that the penis is not for inserting\ninto the anus of another man\u00adthat so using the penis is not the way it is\nsupposed, even intended, to be used. [italics in the original] (251)\nHere the NF comes into play and asks the key question: Even though x (the penis)\nevolved to do y (be inserted into the vagina) why ought we to do y, instead of z? To\nreply that y is the evolved function of x, and z is not, is merely to restate the original\npremise. It is a circular argument, and is without merit.\nNow Levin, being a professional philosopher, does not present such a simplistic\nargument as this, but it is not merely professional philosophers who moralize and the\nNF can be a useful tool in assessing popular moral arguments, which are often more\nsocially influential than philosophical arguments. Of course, we are here most\ninterested in the role of the NF in moral philosophy and it does play a role in\nassessing Levin's larger position.\nWhile he does not mention the NF, Levin goes to great lengths throughout the\narticle to avoid suspicion of this charge. He begins by stating that homosexuality is\nabnormal `not because it is immoral or sinful...but for a purely mechanical reason. It\nis a misuse of bodily parts.' (251) Still, for Levin, the evolution-determined function\nof the penis clearly sets the boundaries for the normative use of the penis. (256-258)\nLevin does not argue, overtly at least, that since evolution shaped the penis to do x\nthat to do ~x is immoral. His argument is that the use of the penis in accord with its\nevolutionary purpose is conducive to happiness, and to act counter to what is\nconducive to our happiness is abnormal. He attempts to presents this conclusion as a\nprudential assessment, rather than a moral one but he undermines such an\ninterpretation. He writes.\nHomosexual acts involve the use of the genitals for what they aren't for, and it\nis a bad or at least unwise thing to use a part of the body for what it isn't for.\nCalling homosexual acts \"unnatural\" is indeed to sum up this entire line of\nreasoning. \"Unnatural\" carries disapprobative connotations, and any explication\nof it should capture this. [italics in the original] (253)\nHis argument comes down to: homosexuality is bad because it makes us unhappy,\nand it makes us unhappy because it is unnatural\u00adi.e. contrary to the design of nature.\nWith this formulation Levin may be able to avoid the more egregious violation of the\nNF previously discussed, but he falls into a variation of the fallacy, nonetheless, i.e.\nhe uses a natural description to make a moral prescription.\nIt may be legitimate to argue that one ought not to act in a way incompatible with\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\none's happiness and so one ought not to do x because x is incompatible with\nhappiness. But then one must support the premise that \"x is incompatible with\nhappiness.\" Levin's primary support for this premise is that `Nature is interested in\nmaking its creatures like what is (inclusively) good for them.' (259) Therefore using\nour bodily parts (not merely the penis) for the purpose for which they were\nintended/evolved will lead to a life that is, on whole, more enjoyable, and a life so\nlived will be a happier life. (260) Levin's explication of this position is marred by an\nequivocation between \"enjoyment\" and \"happiness\" but more importantly he seems\nto rule out, by definition, any sense of happiness generated by using body parts in an\n\"unnatural\" manner. `Homosexuality' he asserts `is likely to cause unhappiness\nbecause it leaves unfulfilled an innate and innately rewarding desire.' (261) This\n\"innate desire\" is not simply to experience sexual release, or to ejaculate, but to\n`introduce semen into the vagina.' (261) Any other means of release will fail to truly\nsatisfy this desire.\nLevin is here treading on treacherous grounds, not only logically, but empirically.\nThere are more serious problems with this line of reasoning than violating the NF, but\nthat this is an example of the NF we can see by posing the question: What if an\nindividual does not find vaginal sex innately rewarding, but instead finds anal sex or\neven no sex more rewarding? In such instances it follows that fulfilling the natural\nfunction of the penis will not be enjoyable, and will not conduce to happiness.\nTherefore, one ought not to act in the way nature intended for to do so would violate\nthe principle that one ought not to do what is incompatible with happiness. (It is,\nperhaps, telling that Levin allows that volitionally celibate individuals, such as\nCatholic priests, do not face the same problem in being happy as homosexuals do--\ndespite their similar violation of the natural impulse. 271)\nIt is, we believe, arguments like Levin's which cause the most anxiety over\nevolutionary ethics. The concern seems to be that if we allow evolutionary thinking\ninto our ethics we are going to end up with a reactionary moral system which\nsupports an oppressive patriarchal value system in which woman are consigned to the\nkitchen, homosexuals to the closets, the poor and disadvantaged to the fringes of\nsociety, all in the name of the natural moral order. The Naturalistic Fallacy cuts off\nany such strategy by pointing out that simply because something has played a certain\nrole in the evolution of the species it does not follow that it ought to continue to play\nthat role, or that it can play no other role. How we ought to behave is a moral\nquestion which cannot simply be read out of the world of facts.\nCuriously, this is just the point that opponents of evolutionary ethics, such as\nGould, want to make, and it is a valid point. However, it does not do all the work\nGould and others attribute to it. For one, it does not hand ethics over to religion and\nmetaphysics --as we can see from an examination of the MF.\nThe Metaphysical Fallacy holds that value statements cannot be derived from a\nsimple statement of religious or metaphysical \"fact.\" As an example let's explore an\naspect of Immanuel Kant's ethics. Kant developed a dualistic view of humans as\nphenomenal beings, with passions, needs and desires, and noumenal beings, capable\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nof grasping the laws of pure reason. (1788) Morality, for Kant, is derived from these\nintellectually grasped laws of pure reason. This is, of course, the Categorical\nImperative (in its various manifestations).\nThe question to consider here is, what grounds the Categorical Imperative, not as a\nrule of reason (we can grant Kant that) but as a moral law? Why ought one to follow\nthe Categorical Imperative? Or in Moore's terms, why is it good to follow the\nCategorical Imperative? Kant addressed this question and deemed it unanswerable: `it\nis wholly impossible to explain how and why the universality of a maxim as a law\n[italics in original]\u00adand therefore morality \u00adshould interest us.\" However he then\nasserts that this interest is connected to the fact that the law has `sprung from our will\nessential nature as rational beings is the foundation for the moral force of the rule of\nreason. In effect, Kant is arguing:\np1 Humans are Essentially Rational Beings,\np2 Pure Practical Reason dictates certain rules for behavior\nC--We ought to follow these rules.\nThe argument is, of course, much more complicated but this will serve, I believe,\nwithout too much harm being done to Kant.\nNow we ask the Open Question. When we ask Kant why we ought to follow the\ndictates of rationality, his answer, ultimately, is because it is an expression of our\nrational nature. Even if we were to grant the notion of an essential nature, it seems we\ncan still ask why we ought to fulfill that nature? If it is supposedly good to do so, a\njustification seems called for. Kant, however, absolutely rejects any consequential\njustification of ethics. We cannot claim, for example, that we will be happier if we\nfollow the dictates of reason. We are simply obliged by virtue of our rational natures\nto act rationally.\nWe can now notice a circularity lurking in the argument: We ought to do x\nbecause it is rational, and we ought to be rational because we are, essentially, rational\nbeings--in effect this is to derive an \"ought\" (act according to rationality) from an\n\"is\" (we are rational). Whether the \"is\" is an empirical statement or a metaphysical\nstatement, it is an invalid move. This is not to deny that we must be rational in order\nto engage in moral discourse. Kant is correct in emphasizing the necessity of\nrationality as a pre-condition of any moral deliberation. He goes astray, however, in\nderiving the principles of morality strictly from the notion of rationality, per se. 1 He\nin effect identifies the \"good\" with the \"rational,\" which not only begs the question of\nreason's moral authority, but rules out of consideration, a priori, emotional and\nconsequential concerns.\nThe Metaphysical Fallacy prohibits certain religious/philosophical attempts at\ndeveloping an ethics, just as the Naturalistic Fallacy prohibits certain scientific\nattempts at developing an ethics. This is, in fact, what we believe the Naturalistic\nfallacy does: it does not demarcate the boundaries between science and ethics, or\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nbetween science and religion--it invalidates certain attempts at developing an ethics.\nSpecifically, it invalidates ethical arguments of the form\nX is the natural function of Y; therefore one ought to do X\nIt also rules out:\nX is an expression of Ultimate Reality: therefore X is morally correct\nWe can see, then, that Gould's NOMA is mistaken in placing ethics under the\nmagisterium of religion. Religious and metaphysical systems can be just as misguided\nin their approach to ethics as scientific approaches can be. However, our goal was not\nto critique religion, but to argue for a positive role for evolution in ethical theorizing,\nand to that we must now turn.\nIV) The Naturalistic Fallacy and Evolutionary Ethics\nThe message to be taken from this understanding of the NF is that no factual\nstatement about the world--be it empirical or metaphysical--entails a value\nstatement. The deeper message is that values are not to be found, at all, whether in the\nnatural universe, or in some transcendent realm. Now, this may seem an unpalatable\nconclusion that does not bode well for any ethical system, much less an evolutionary\none, but we do not believe this is to be the case. Moral dilemmas exist; values\nconflict; \"what ought we to do?\" is still a meaningful question. There needs to be\nsome way of dealing with these ethical concerns, even after the NF/MF has done its\nwork.\nTo see how to proceed we need to adjust our traditional notions of the subject of\nmoral philosophy. The notion that ethical truths are \"out there\" waiting to be\ndiscovered is itself the remnant of a pre-scientific mode of thought. It stems back to a\ntime when not only ethics, but science itself was under the magisterium of religion.\nThe progress of modern science can be viewed as a process of freeing the study of\nnature from religious/ metaphysical constraints and establishing its own magisterium.\nFor example, our understanding of species increased dramatically once we\nsurrendered the notion that there are fixed essences embodied by species, and saw\ninstead that species are what they are because of a complex, dynamic process of\ninteraction between individuals and their environments.\nThis provides an important lesson for understanding ethics. While the universe is\nvalue-neutral in the sense of not entailing any moral imperatives, it does contain the\nconditions that give rise to valuing and to creatures who make value judgments.\nThese value judgments are not the expression of some pre-existing moral essence but\nrather arise from the complex interactions between individuals and the environment.\nIn effect, morality is not \"out there\" waiting to be found, it is constructed by\nindividuals-who-value, who live in an environment which provides the conditions for\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nboth satisfying and frustrating our desires, and who must live with others who may or\nmay not value the same things, in the same way. Morality is both the result of and a\ncontributor to complex social interactions.\nThis approach should not be construed as an endorsement of a non-cognitivist or\nanti-realist approach to ethics. In one sense this critique of the NF/MF is neutral on\nthese meta-ethical issues. However, the goal of this critique is to clear the conceptual\nground for an evolutionary ethics and such an ethics is aligned more consistently with\ncognitivist /realist approaches. Although in making this claim we would do well to\nkeep in mind Simon Blackburn's warning that \"realism\" and \"cognitivism\" are `terms\nof art that philosophers can define pretty much at will.' (120) In saying that values are\nnot \"out there\" we do not mean to imply that values are therefore simply expressions\nof subjective attitudes or emotions.2 What is being denied is any strict identification\nof a factual description of some property of the world with a normative evaluation of\nthat property.\nA complete inventory of the universe would not yield any property which in and of\nitself could be labeled \"good\" or \"bad.\" But that inventory would contain creatures\n(e.g. humans) that have needs, desires, interests, etc., which in relationship to other\nthings on the list yield satisfactions/dissatisfactions, which constitute \"values.\" A\n\"value\" is not an object in the world, but is shorthand for an objective relationship\nbetween creatures with interests and other components of the universe. 3\nTo view ethics in this way is to see it as an attempt to evaluate and critique certain\nresponses to complex social situations, not as an attempt to divine some pre-existing\nmoral order. It is to view ethics as a practical discipline. This is not a radically new\nview of ethics. It was first suggested by Aristotle, and it has been more recently\nadvocated by Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, who have urged us to see morality as\nan \"applied science.\" (1986) It is also the approach to ethics developed by John\nmuch to offer evolutionary ethics and who is, in fact, the guiding light behind much\nof this article. 4\nGiven this view of ethics, it becomes essential to gain greater insight into the\nconditions that underlie value judgment, their development and their consequences.\nThese are empirical questions and so fall under the magisterium of science. Any\nscience which helps us to understand and assess morally problematic situations has\nsomething to contribute to moral philosophy. Evolution, as a scientific study of\nhuman cognition, emotions and predispositions--core elements of moral situations--\nrather than being barred becomes a most valuable tool in the study of ethics. 5\nV) Conclusion\nBefore concluding, we need to deal with the most common objection to this\nposition, and again we can allow Gould to speak for the opposition. It is quite\nreasonable, Gould says, to accept that science can highlight the conditions of moral\nexperience or the history of moral systems, what he calls the `anthropology of\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nmorals,' but it can go no further. Factual information can contribute nothing to\nnormative ethics; or as Gould puts it `science can say nothing about the morality of\nmorals.' (65-66) John Dewey responded to just this type of criticism, one hundred\nyears ago. Here is his formulation of the criticism of what he calls the \"historical\nmethod,\" i.e. an evolutionary approach to ethics in which the cultural as well as\nnatural development of morality is assessed. 6\nThe opponent argues thus: It is of course true that morality has a history; that is,\nwe can trace different moral practices, beliefs, customs, demands, opinions,\nvarious forms of outward manifestation. We can say that here such and such\nmoral practices obtained, and then gave way in this point or that. This indeed is\na branch of history, and an interesting one....But when this is said and done the\nresult remains history, not ethics. What ethics deals with is the moral worth of\nthese various practices, beliefs, etc....The historian of ethics can at most supply\nonly data; the distinctive work of the ethical writer is still all to be done. (1902,\nThe problem with this objection is that it misconstrues the purpose of the historical/\nevolutionary approach to ethics, and the nature of ethical deliberation. Dewey's\nimaginary critic, and Gould, are correct that this process will not reveal the \"Good\",\nor the \"Right\" (as those terms are understood in traditional philosophical jargon.) But\nthis is not the purpose of such an approach. For Dewey, we engage in moral inquiry\nbecause there is no clear, objective moral truth at hand. We investigate in order to\nbetter understand the conditions of human valuations and so be better equipped to\nunderstand and resolve those dilemmas which we must face. He writes, `It might be\ntrue that objective history does not create moral values as such, and yet be true that\nthere is no way of settling questions of valid ethical significance in detail apart from\nhistorical consideration.' (23)\nDewey believes moral dilemmas are problematic situations in which there is a\nquestion about what to do. They arise when there is a disjunct between the desires/\ninterests of an agent and the environing conditions in which one finds oneself. Such\nsituations call for deliberation in order to reach a judgment that \"x\" is the right/good\nthing to do. For Dewey, to claim \"x\" is \"good\" is not to commit the naturalistic\nfallacy of identifying a natural property with a moral evaluation. It is to judge that \"x\"\nperspective the entire situation is composed of natural elements, and so the moral\nconclusion must follow from naturalistic premises. But, as should be clear at this\npoint, such conclusions are not violations of Moore's injunction; nor is Dewey's\napproach subject to the Open Question criticism. To say \"x resolves the dilemma, but\nis x good?\" is confused. Once we have established that \"x\" resolves the dilemma to\nthen ask if it is good is either redundant, or it is to ask for further evaluation of the\nproposed resolution--i.e. it is to ask \"does x truly resolve the dilemma?\" \"does it\nresolve the dilemma in the short run but create greater long term problems?\" \"does it\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nresolve the problem by frustrating other significant interests?\" etc. These are all fair\nquestions, indeed important questions. They do not imply, however, that there is\nsome fallacy lurking beneath the moral judgment, they merely seek to continue the\nprocess of moral inquiry in a meta-ethically and epistemically responsible way.\nIn order to resolve a problematic situation, to make a moral judgment, we need to\nhave a clear grasp of the situation at hand and the possible consequences of various\noptions. Whatever contributes to our understanding of the situation, contributes to our\njudgment of what we may construe as the good in that situation. As Dewey says,\n`Whatever modifies the judgment...modifies conduct. To control our judgments of\nconduct...is in so far forth to direct conduct itself.' (38) In other words, whatever\ncontributes to that moral judgment has normative and not merely descriptive\nsignificance. Evolutionary studies clearly can make such a contribution.\nThis is not to imply that evolution will have something to offer each dilemma; our\nmoral experience is too complicated to make any such generalized claim. The point is\nthat evolutionary studies, by helping to uncover the workings of human emotions and\ncognition provide a wealth of resources that can inform, in a practical way, our moral\ndeliberations. Philosophers/ethicists can no longer turn a blind eye to the evolutionary\nsciences and related disciplines uncovering relevant information regarding human\nnature. We believe that the attribution of such information to the field of ethics is a\nclearly defined epistemically responsible method for framing ethical concepts.\nSo, in conclusion, rather than excluding evolutionary considerations from ethics\nthe Naturalistic Fallacy actually opens up space for evolution to contribute to moral\nphilosophy. The deeper lesson of the Naturalistic Fallacy is that ethics is not about\nidentifying pre-existing moral definitions. It is, instead, an ongoing process of\ndeliberation concerning what is right/good to do. Given this, any discipline which\ncontributes to an understanding of the human condition, contributes to this process.\nEvolutionary studies aspire to offer insights into the physical, psychological and\nsocial aspects of human existence and, to the degree that these insights are valid, may\nprove invaluable to our moral thinking. 7\nNotes\n1 For a more detailed discussion of Kant's ethics from an evolutionary perspective\n2 Simon Blackburn has developed a naturalistic approach to ethics which also seeks\nto overcome the constraints of the naturalistic fallacy. His theory, which cannot be\ngiven its due here, bears apparent kinship with the approach developed in this\npaper, but differs in relation to the cognitivist/realist issue. While appropriately\nwary of such labels, Blackburn accepts that his theory falls near the non-\ncognitivist/anti-realist end of the spectrum (although he prefers the term \"quasi-\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nrealism\"). Ethical propositions are properly seen as projections of our concerns\nand attitudes, rather than as references to some property of the world. As such\nthere are no truth conditions applicable to ethical propositions. (1998) As it stands\nthis is in agreement with the Deweyan position underlying this paper, but it does\nnot go far enough in assessing ethical propositions. Dewey would agree that\nethical propositions are rooted in human concerns but he would insist they are\nmore than projections. They are themselves practical judgments which address\nbad\" is not to identify \"fat\" with some objective moral quality \"badness\" but\nneither is it simply an expression of a subjective attitude. If it were, then for\nDewey it would not be an ethical proposition. (1945, p. 684) As an ethical\nproposition \"fat is bad\" works against, is inconsistent with, somehow conflicts\nwith some desired state of affairs (which is also a real property of the world). Such\na proposition is open to a cognitive assessment, despite the fact that non-cognitive\nfactors play an essential role in moral judgments (here Dewey and Blackburn are\nin agreement.) Much more can and should be said on this issue than can fit within\nthe scope of this paper.\n3. DiCarlo has mentioned elsewhere (\"Problem Solving and Religion in the EEA: An\nEndorphin Rush?\" presented at the New England Institute Cognitive Science and\nEvolutionary Psychology Conference, August, 2003, Portland, Maine) that an\nevolutionary concept of human value begins with the drive to maintain bio-\nmemetic equilibria in order to achieve survival-reproductive value. As a starting\npoint for acknowledged value, that which would have best favored survival and\nreproduction would have garnered the most value. The eventual emergence of non-\nconscious humans to conscious, socially-active language users, created the\nenvironment in which humans were capable of measuring ideas with actions in\nterms of their own survival strategies. Hence, the emergence of consciously\nrecognized `value' in terms of survival and reproduction. See also diCarlo 2002/3,\n4 It is worth noting some recent works on evolution and ethics consistent with a\nDeweyan approach. Larry Arnhart (1998) makes a compelling case for an\nAristotelian evolutionary ethics which shares much with Dewey's approach--not\nsurprising, given Dewey's affinity with Aristotle. Also, Robert Hinde (2002) has\nquite effectively set out the role biology may play in moral philosophy, given that\nmoral philosophy is concerned with ethical deliberations, rather than with a search\nfor absolutes. Most significantly. William Casebeer (2003) sets out, in effective\ndetail, the case for an Aristotelian/Deweyan ethics grounded in evolutionary\nbiology and cognitive science consonant with the ethical approach being\ndeveloped in this paper. His work also contains a critique of the NF, but from a\ndifferent, though complementary, angle.\n5 One way in which we can see this in application is to briefly consider diCarlo's\n`Relations of Natural Systems' project. This is essentially a multi-disciplinary\nweb-based approach to understanding human behaviour by examining our species\nOn the Naturalistic Fallacy: A Conceptual Basis for Evolutionary Ethics\nand its environmental interactions as a complex synthesis of relational systems. It\nis anticipated that though the understanding of such interactive systems may not\nprovide us with \"oughts\" it will certainly clarify matters in terms of the \"is's\" i.e.\nthe physical substrates. And we believe this to be epistemically responsible. For\nwe are now taking the initiative to ask the other humanities, social and natural\nsciences what makes humans \"tick\" at various levels. Such a synthetic view--in\nconjunction with a clear understanding of the NF/MF--will shed light on the origin\nand development of human values.\n6 Dewey's conception of an evolutionary account of ethics is not a strictly biological\napproach. His concern is to study the developmental history of moral judgments,\nwhich on a certain level may not include biological considerations. But Dewey's\nnaturalism sees \"culture\" as an outgrowth of the needs, desires and predispositions\nof humans who are the product of natural evolution. Therefore \"natural\" evolution\nand \"cultural\" evolution are points on a continuum and are both part of a full\nappreciation of human experience. The contemporary evolutionary study of ethics\nseems a continuation of the project Dewey is defending in his 1902 essay. For a\nfurther discussion of Dewey's views on evolution see, Teehan, 2002.\n7 Perhaps, the role to be played is even more urgent. Dewey warns, `A culture which\npermits science to destroy traditional values but which distrusts its power to create\nReferences\nArnhart, L. (1998).
