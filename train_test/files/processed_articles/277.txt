A hierarchical model of contextual and indi-\nvidual-level effects on academic achievement and school attrition\nreveals patterns that reproduce those found in national student\nsurveys but also others that are unique to the second generation.\nAmong the latter are the resilient negative effect of length of U.S.\nresidence on achievement across school contexts and the fact that\nstrong effects of national origin on grades are attenuated in\nschools with high proportions of coethnics. Mexican-origin stu-\ndents display significant disadvantages in achievement and reten-\ntion that are generally compounded, not alleviated, by the schools\nthat they attend. A theoretical explanation of this pattern is\nadvanced, and its practical implications are discussed.\nThe rapid growth of immigration during the past three decades\nhas transformed the demographic structure of the United\nStates and the nature of its interethnic relations. During the past\nintercensal period, immigration accounted for 70% of the\ngrowth of the American population; the foreign-born population\nreached 30 million, approaching the historic record of 15% of the\n62% of the population of Los Angeles was of immigrant stock\n(first or second generation) as were 54% of New York's, 43% of\nSan Diego's, and 72% of Miami's population (1, 2).\nAlthough the initial attention of scholars and policy makers\nfocused on the immigrants themselves, it has become clear over\ntime that the long-term consequences of today's immigrant wave\nare more closely linked with the second generation and its chances\nfor successful adaptation. Immigrant children and U.S.-born chil-\ndren of immigrants are the fastest growing segment of the nation's\nmillion or 1 in 5 of all young Americans (3, 4).\nUnlike first-generation immigrants whose concerns and aspira-\ntions are commonly centered in their country of origin and who\nfrequently return there, the second generation is composed of U.S.\ncitizens and most of its members are here to stay (5, 6). Most of this\npopulation is still young and the majority are still in school (4, 7).\nHence, the principal outcomes of the adaptation process at this\nstage are educational: academic attainment and the likelihood of\ngraduating vs. dropping out of high school. In this article, we\nexamine the effects of the class and ethnic composition of the\nschools that second-generation youths attend in early adolescence\non these key outcomes.\nUsing data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study\n(CILS), the most extensive data source on the immigrant second\ngeneration to date, Portes and Rumbaut (8) analyzed the educa-\ntional adaptation process of this population. Results were published\nin a series of articles and in a recent book, Legacies: The Story of the\nImmigrant Second Generation. The main findings from their analysis\nwill be summarized below. However, potential effects of school\ncontextual variables on academic achievement and school retention\nwere not examined exhaustively. The purpose of the present article\nis to extend and supplement these prior results by applying more\nadvanced and appropriate statistical methods to the CILS data set.\nThe longitudinal character of the study makes it possible to examine\nhow school compositional factors at an early age can bear on\nsubsequent academic achievement and on the likelihood of second-\ngeneration youths remaining in school until graduation. Specifi-\ncally, we inquire about the effects of the class and ethnic compo-\nsition of schools attended in early adolescence on the probability of\ngraduation and on level of educational attainment.\nTheoretical Background\nAt least since the famous Coleman Report, the preoccupation\nhas continued among education scholars with the ways in which\nschool context affects the academic performance of children,\nboth directly and in interaction with individual predictors (9\u00ad12,\n\u00a7). The abundant literature about this topic has paid particular\nattention to the differential performance of students in Catholic\nand other private schools, as contrasted with those in lay public\nEducational researchers have identified school composition as\none of the key areas responsible for schools' differences in overall\nacademic success and rates of dropout (16). School compositional\neffects constitute the aggregate influence of school peers on a\nstudent's school experience, above and beyond the effects of the\nindividual student's own particular peers (17\u00ad19). When schools are\nsegregated by their socioeconomic status (SES), they differ in many\nways, including teacher quality, staffing ratios, school climate, and\nteachers' expectations (20). Previous research has found a school's\nmean SES to have a contextual effect on students' achievement and\ndropout rates, over and beyond the effects of individual students'\nMany minority schools are of low SES, which is a major reason\nwhy minority schools are associated with low achievement. How-\never, recent studies show an influence of ethnic segregation on\nacademic achievement independent of the school's SES (26). And,\ndespite 20 years of desegregation efforts, U.S. public schools have\nincreasingly resegregated (27). School segregation is most pro-\nnounced in large metropolitan areas where immigrants are con-\ndistrict segregation in metropolitan areas steadily increased (28).\nSchool segregation among Hispanics has become substantially\nAbbreviations: CILS, Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study; SES, socioeconomic status;\nGPA, grade point average.\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed at: Princeton University, 186 Wallace Hall,\nPrinceton, NJ 08544.

Few studies so\nfar have focused, however, on the long-term consequences that\nearly class and ethnic composition of schools can have on subse-\nquent educational outcomes.\nThe sociology of immigration and, in particular, the study of the\nsecond generation, has made several significant empirical contri-\nbutions, indicating that the growing population of children of\nimmigrants is similar to the general student population in some\nrespects, but it also differs in systematic ways. These analyses,\nincluding those performed on the basis of CILS data, show positive\neffects of family status, student ambition, self-esteem, and gender\n(female) on achievement. They also point to the very strong effect\nof intact families on school retention and significant positive\ninfluences of coethnic friendships and fluent bilingualism on aca-\ndemic attainment (30\u00ad35). In addition, resilient ethnic effects\nassociated with students' national origins persist after controlling\nfor all individual and family variables. These effects have been\ninterpreted as supporting the enduring influence of coethnic com-\nmunities and the intergenerational transmission of advantage and\ndisadvantage associated with the modes of incorporation of differ-\nWe hypothesize that the socioeconomic and ethnic composition\nof schools attended early in life can have enduring consequences on\nchances for educational success of immigrant children. Based on the\nexisting research literature, we predict that the average SES of\nschools attended in early adolescence will be positively associated\nwith educational performance and negatively associated with drop-\nping out among second-generation youths (10, 11). On the other\nhand, the ethnic composition of schools can play an equally\nenduring but different role. Although family and school SES\nreinforce each other's effects, attending schools populated mostly\nby coethnics may attenuate individual nationality effects. Several\nrecent studies suggest that children from underprivileged back-\ngrounds may feel at less of a disadvantage in the company of their\npeers, and they would perform worse than expected in the com-\npetitive environment of majority white middle-class schools\u00b6\nBy the same reasoning, children from advantaged immigrant\nnationalities who attend schools with a large number of similar\ncoethnics may see their academic gains attenuated by the more\ncompetitive environment of such schools and the diminished sense\nthat they are, in some sense, ``special'' (41, 42). Although tentative\nat this point, these ideas will serve as guide points for the explo-\nration of a question not analyzed before, namely, how early school\nethnic composition bears on the subsequent academic fate of the\nnew second generation.\nData and Prior Results\nCILS is a survey of 5,266 children of immigrants who were\nschool systems of Miami (Dade County) and Ft. Lauderdale\n(Broward County) in Florida and San Diego in California. The\nsample was limited to eighth and ninth graders to control for the\nwell known censoring bias created by school dropouts in later\ngrades. The ninth- to twelfth-grade dropout rate in Dade County\n(Miami) and San Diego schools at the time of the CILS surveys\nexceeded 15%. Among minority students, the dropout rates went\nas high as 25% (see ref. 8, p. 259).] Second-generation students\nwere defined, in agreement with common usage in the immi-\ngration literature, as native-born children with at least one\nforeign-born parent or foreign-born children who were brought\nto the United States at an early age and have resided in the\nUnited States ever since.\nThe sample design was based on a selection of schools in each\narea that represented different socioeconomic levels, ethnic com-\npositions, and geographic locations. In total, 42 schools in the three\nmetropolitan areas took part in the study. In all, 77 different\nnationalities are represented in the study. MiamiFt. Lauderdale\nand San Diego were selected because of the different compositions\nof their immigrant populations. South Florida is home to large\nconcentrations of people from the Caribbean and South America,\nincluding Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, West Indians, and Co-\nlombians. Southern California, in turn, has large concentrations of\nMexicans, Central Americans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and East\nAsians.\nThree years after the original survey and at the time when most\nrespondents were in their senior year of high school, a follow-up was\nconducted. Its purpose was to examine the evolution of key\nadaptation outcomes during adolescence. Survey data were sup-\nplemented by data provided by school systems on school inactivity\nand senior high school grades. These records are the data used as\ndependent variables in the following analysis.\nThe follow-up survey retrieved 82% of the original sample.\nSampling bias analysis, reported in earlier publications, indicates\nthat the second survey is representative, in almost every respect, of\nthe original sample (8). In addition, however, data on school\nattrition and academic grades were provided by the schools them-\nselves and are available for most original respondents, including\nthose not re-interviewed in the follow-up. Therefore, the data allow\nus to examine the effects of individual, family, and school predic-\ntors, measured during early adolescence, on academic outcomes 3\nyears later.\nSeveral prior studies have analyzed different aspects of educa-\ntional attainment in this sample. These studies have relied on\nstandard models of status attainment in sociology and economics\nthat highlight the significance of parental SES, family composition,\naspirations, and gender on student's academic performance\u00a7 (43\u00ad\n45). In the only multilevel study of contextual effects on the\nperformance of the second generation published so far, Portes and\nMacLeod (38) found that children from relatively advantaged\nethnic communities, such as Cubans in Miami and the Vietnamese\nin San Diego, performed well academically, regardless of the\ncomposition of the schools that they attended. In contrast, disad-\nvantaged students, such as Mexican Americans in California and\nHaitian Americans in Florida, performed differently depending on\nschool context. In agreement with results based on prior national\nsamples, this study found that family and school SES supported\neach other so that the academic advantage of children from\nhigh-status families was compounded in high-status schools.\nResults published in Legacies (8) focused on academic outcomes\nby the senior year of high school. The analysis found that, in\naddition to the positive effects of family SES and intact families on\ngrade point averages (GPAs), early educational aspirations and\nself-esteem also yielded strong positive effects. In contrast, length\nof U.S. residence reduced grades in late adolescence, pointing to a\ndeclining achievement drive among more assimilated second-\ngeneration youths.\nThe same analysis modeled determinants of school attrition.\nLiving in an intact family (both parents present) proved a para-\nmount factor in keeping children in school; early educational\nexpectations and self-esteem also prevented second-generation\nyouths from dropping out. Most ethnic effects disappeared after\ncontrolling for individual and family variables, with one important\nexception: Mexican-origin children continued to have a significantly\nhigher probability of abandoning school prematurely. We inquire in\nthe following analysis on how these results are affected by contex-\ntual characteristics that have not been examined in prior analyses.\n\u00b6Suarez-Orozco M. Paper presented at the Session on Growing up American, Meetings of\nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, February 1996, Baltimore, MD.\nMassey D. S. & Fisher M. J. (2003) Manuscript, Population Studies Center, University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia.\nResults\nTable 1 presents results of an individual-level ordinary least-\nsquares regression of GPAs in senior high school and of a\nmultinomial logistic regression of the probabilities of dropping\nout or being declared inactive by the school system. The model\nincludes predictors derived from the previous theoretical review\nand found to have statistically significant effects in all previous\nanalyses. Because our purpose is to examine possible interaction\neffects between school contextual factors and individual-level\npredictors of educational attainment, it is appropriate to limit\nthe level I models to predictors found to have statistically reliable\neffects. Results in Table 1 provide a baseline for our analysis as\nthey replicate those reported by prior studies.\nThe analysis of national differences is limited to just four\nnationalities: Chinese, Koreans, Mexicans, and Vietnamese. This\ndecision was based on the prior finding that these are the nation-\nalities that have the strongest and most resilient effects on academic\nperformance and that these effects are of opposite sign: the three\nAsian groups perform consistently above the sample average and\nretain significant positive effects after controlling for other predic-\ntors; the opposite is the case for Mexican-origin students (8).\nChinese and Korean students are combined in this analysis because\nof their relatively small numbers and because of their close simi-\nlarity in terms of parental human capital, proportions living in intact\nfamilies, areas of residence, and levels of academic performance.\nThis reproduces past practice in the analysis of the same data (8).\nThe reference category for the analysis of national differences is\nthe remainder of the CILS sample comprising 73 different national-\norigin groups and 3,000 cases. Because Mexican scores and those\nof the three Asian nationalities balance each other on the depen-\ndent variables, the averages for this reference category are very\nclose to those of the total sample. This finding makes this category\nan appropriate point of comparison, equivalent to contrasting\nMexican- and Asian-origin students with the rest of the second\ngeneration.\nThe dependent variables are GPA in senior high school and\nindicators of dropping out and inactivity reported by the respective\nschool systems. We explicitly control for differences in grading\npractices across regions by introducing this variable into the model\nas a predictor. [This predictor is a dummy variable with schools in\nCalifornia (San Diego) coded 1; those in Florida (MiamiFt.\nLauderdale) are coded 0.] The rest of results in the table reproduce\nthose reported earlier. They add to our confidence in GPA as a valid\nindicator of academic performance by showing that it is a well\nbehaved measure that correlates positively and significantly with\nestablished predictors of academic attainment: parental SES and\nintact families have strong positive effects, as do self-esteem and\neducational expectations. Females display significantly higher\nachievements, a result that reproduces those reported in national\nsamples (38). As noted earlier, length of U.S. residence tends to\nhave a negative effect on second-generation grades.\nThe school systems of MiamiFt. Lauderdale and San Diego\nprovided two indicators of school abandonment, classifying some\nstudents as ``dropouts'' and others as ``inactive.'' The first category\nincludes students who have been officially determined to have left\nschool before graduation and the second includes students whose\nwhereabouts are unknown. (The two categories are mutually ex-\nclusive so that dropouts are not counted twice.) Table 1 shows a\nsimilar pattern of effects on both indicators. It reproduces prior\npublished results showing the positive effects of intact families and\nearly educational expectations in preventing school abandonment\nand the negative ones of age and Mexican origin. We inquire next\nhow these results vary with the characteristics of the schools that\nsecond-generation youths attended in early adolescence.\nFixed and Random Effects. Table 2 presents results of an ANOVA\nfor random effects where the intercepts and all significant individ-\nual effects are modeled as a function of their respective grand\nmeans plus an error term. This analysis is necessary to determine\nwhether sufficient between-school variance exists to justify multi-\nlevel contextual modeling. The absence of such variance represents\na substantive outcome insofar as it indicates that a specific indi-\nvidual or family effect persists, regardless of school context. By\nhaving predictors coded as deviations from their school means, the\nTable 1.

A good operational reason for this\ndecision exists, namely, the need for a large enough sample to\npermit reliable estimation of contextual effects. However, there are\nalso substantive facts that make this approach reasonable. The three\nAsian groups are quite similar in a number of characteristics. These\ncharacteristics include the proportion living in intact families, very\nhigh for all three groups; the high educational expectations among\nboth parents and children; and the three groups' higher-than-\naverage levels of academic performance. As shown in Table 1, both\nChineseKoreans and Vietnamese retain significant positive ethnic\neffects on grades after controlling for all other factors, but neither\ngroup has a significant net effect on dropping out or becoming\ninactive in school.\nResults presented in Table 2 use robust estimates of standard\nerrors to correct for the two-stage CILS sampling design. Robust\nstandard errors also attenuate the effect of a large sample size,\nreducing the probability of a type I error. Results for the intercepts\nshow sufficient between-school variance in all dependent variables\nto justify additional analysis. (To prevent an excessive loss of\nschools, the analysis of contextual effects on all predictors, except\nnational origin, was performed with the latter kept as fixed effects.)\nThe same is not the case for the slopes. Among predictors of senior\nhigh school grades, average effects of length of U.S. residence and\nself-esteem do not vary significantly across schools. Substantively,\nthis means that, regardless of school context, individual self-esteem\nis associated with higher academic performance, whereas accultur-\nation (indexed by longer periods of U.S. residence) depresses it. The\ntwo ethnic effects, Mexican and Asian, remain highly significant,\nalbeit in opposite directions and both vary sufficiently to justify\nfurther analysis.\nAmong the few significant predictors of dropping out, only the\nage effect varies across schools. Although total variation in the\nMexican effect on dropping out is nonsignificant, it is possible that\nsome unobserved variation still exists. Given the theoretical im-\nportance of this coefficient, we will examine this possibility. The\nabsence of sufficient observed and unobserved variation in other\nsignificant predictors means that the strong effects of intact fami-\nlies, early educational expectations, and self-esteem in preventing\nschool abandonment persist across different types of schools. This\nresult is substantively important. Self-esteem emerges from this\nanalysis as one of the strongest predictors of educational outcomes\namong second-generation youths, having a significant positive\ninfluence on grades and a negative one on dropping out, both\nresilient to school compositional differences. Prior analyses of the\nsame data show that the positive effect of self-esteem on senior high\nschool achievement remains even after controlling for junior\ngrades, a finding that supports the hypotheses of a causal relation-\nGrowing up in an intact family turns out to be the most important\nfamily factor because (unlike family SES) it has strong effects on\nboth grades and the probability of high school graduation, with the\nlatter effect invariant across schools of different characteristics. The\neffects of early educational expectations run in the same direction,\nreinforcing those of family composition and self-esteem.\nGrades. The hierarchical analysis of school contextual effects mod-\nels the intercepts of individual (level I) regressions and slopes for\nwhich significant variance occurs as outcomes of three school\ncharacteristics: (i) socioeconomic composition, indexed by the\nobverse of the percentage of students eligible for the federally\nsubsidized lunch program; (ii) ethnic composition, indexed by the\npercentage of students in school who are either Asian or Hispanic;\n(iii) other school characteristics, captured by the contextual (level\nII) error. The latter is interpretable as the sum of all other\n(unmeasured) school characteristics affecting each level I outcome.\nA control for region in the regressions of the between-school\nintercepts obviates the need to include the same predictor in the\nregressions of the slopes.\nSchool compositional effects on grades are presented in Table 3.\nSES of schools significantly improves academic achievement, a\nresult that reproduces the results found in past studies of national\nsamples (11, 14). The figure corresponds to the common-sense\nnotion that schools attended by high-status students tend to be\nbetter overall, especially in terms of their academic outputs. (It is\nalso possible that higher-SES schools tend to give higher grades to\ntheir students. Although we interpret GPAs in this analysis as a valid\noverall indicator of academic achievement based on its correlations\nwith earlier test scores and other established predictors, the pos-\nsibility that its variation between schools reflects, at least partially,\ndifferent grading practices cannot be discarded.) Turning to the\nTable 2.

This\ninteraction of family and school contexts is identical with that\nobserved in national samples, indicating that immigrant youths are\nno different from their native-born counterparts in the intergen-\nerational transmission of privilege. However, when high-SES stu-\ndents attend heavily Asian schools, the influence of their family\nbackground is partially neutralized. The contextual effect of school\nAsian composition is significant only at the 0.10 level, but it is of a\nsufficient order of magnitude to attenuate the mutually reinforcing\ninfluences of family and school SES. This effect is similar to the\n``leveling'' influence that Catholic schools have on children of\ndifferent socioeconomic backgrounds, which has been observed in\nFig. 1 helps illustrate the changing effects of family status in\nschools of different socioeconomic levels. It graphically portrays the\ncompounding effects of social class in increasing achievement\ninequalities. Schools of very-low-average status neutralize the pos-\nitive influence of parental SES, leading to a slightly downward slope\nin performance. The positive interaction between family and school\nSES is most visible in high-status schools where the advantages\nbrought to school by privileged children truly pay off. (Again, it is\npossible that the academic advantage of students from high-SES\nfamilies who attend high-SES schools may partially derive from the\ntendency of these schools to grade their privileged students more\ngenerously. Investigating this possibility would require an in-depth,\npossibly ethnographic investigation into the grading practices of\ndifferent types of schools.)\nAs noted previously, intact families exercise a positive effect on\nachievement regardless of school context, a result that highlights\nonce again the powerful influence of this variable on second-\ngeneration achievement. The effect of early educational expecta-\ntions does vary, however, with the class composition of schools. As\nwith family and school SES, these effects are mutually reinforcing\nso that early ambition has a higher academic yield in high-status\nschools, whereas its positive influence is weakened in poorer ones.\nThis interaction effect is quite similar to that portrayed in Fig. 1.\nTherefore, two key interactions discovered by this analysis point to\nthe mutually reinforcing influence of high family SES and educa-\ntional ambition for students whose school peers come from equally\nprivileged backgrounds. This result clearly supports our first hy-\npothesis concerning class compositional effects.\nNext, we seek to establish whether the effects of national origin\nvary with the proportion of coethnics in school. The central finding\nin Table 3 is that individual ethnic effects, positive for Asians and\nnegative for Mexicans, are attenuated in the presence of a sizable\npercentage of coethnics. Fig. 2 illustrates this pattern for Asian\nstudents. The average percentage of Asians in our school sample is\nTable 3.

Asian-origin students' senior average grades in schools with different\nproportions of Asians.\n19%, ranging from 0% to 45%. For schools at the low end of this\ncontinuum, the average senior GPA for an Asian-origin student is\n3.22, or 30% above the sample average. For Asian students who\nattended more coethnic schools, the average grade drops to 2.77,\nstill above the grand mean but only by 12%.\nIn the Mexican students, the negative effect of ethnic origin is\nalso significantly attenuated in schools with higher numbers of\nHispanics. This effect reproduces that found by Portes and Ma-\ncLeod (38) in their analysis of math scores in junior high school.\nThese authors interpreted it as indicating that Mexican students do\nbetter in the more congenial and presumably less competitive\nenvironment created by coethnic peers.\nThis line of reasoning corresponds to our second hypothesis\nconcerning the diminished effects of national and class origins in\nthe presence of a significant number of peers from the same ethnic\nbackground. This attenuation applies to advantaged and disadvan-\ntaged immigrants and is supported by the previously noted effect of\nPercent Asian in flattening the family SESGPA slope. To see\nwhether this contextual effect replicates across other indicators of\nacademic achievement, we ran the same analysis with math scores\nin junior high school as the dependent variable. Portes and\nMacLeod (38) had already found a reduction of ethnic disadvan-\ntage on math scores for Mexican-origin students. We tested\nwhether the same result applies to the significant advantage of\nAsian-origin youths. In this case, the number of Vietnamese-origin\nstudents is sufficiently large to allow us to test this effect for all Asian\nstudents and for the Vietnamese alone.\nTable 4 presents the findings that indicate again that the signif-\nicant academic advantages associated with Asian or Vietnamese\norigin diminish in school contexts characterized by a large propor-\ntion of other Asian students. Math scores were measured in junior\nhigh school at the same time as ethnic composition of schools. (The\nStanford standardized math test score was administered to all\nstudents in the sample during the eighth grade. These data are used\nin the analysis presented in Table 4. In senior high school, the test\nbecame optional, thereby eliminating its value as an indicator of\nachievement. This optionality is the reason why earlier analyses\nfocused exclusively on senior GPAs.) But the analysis in Table 3\nused GPAs in senior high school as the dependent variable. These\nresults indicate that the contextual effects of ethnic composition,\nlike those of class composition, endure over time: second-\ngeneration students who attended higher-SES schools in early\nadolescence continued to receive higher grades later on; and the\nhandicaps or advantages that they brought from their respective\nethnic communities continued to be reduced if their early school\ncontexts were marked by a heavy coethnic presence.\nComplementing the explanation advanced by Portes and\nMacLeod (38) for the reduction of the Mexican disadvantage in\nmostly Hispanic schools, we interpret results for Asian students in\nTables 3 and 4 as indicating that the greater competition in heavily\nAsian schools and the presence of equally disciplined and motivated\npeers reduces the relative advantage brought by these students from\nhome. In both cases, however, the reduction of the ethnic effect is\nrelative; although attenuated, it never entirely disappears. Corre-\nsponding to our two original hypotheses, the compositional effects\nof class and ethnicity work at cross-purposes in affecting the\neducational attainment of the second generation. Although higher\nschool SES supports and reinforces the effects of family SES and\neducational expectations, coethnicity of schools reduces the strong\nnet influence on attainment associated with different immigrant\nbackgrounds. Both interactions are resilient, enduring over time.\nSchool Abandonment. The two indicators of school abandonment\nrefer, respectively, to students who were officially determined to\nhave left school before graduation and those whose whereabouts\nwere unknown. Despite this difference, the analysis of determinants\nof both outcomes yields similar results, showing only a few predic-\ntors to have reliable effects. These have been described previously.\nWhat is new in this analysis is that, as shown in Table 2, most of these\neffects vary little across school contexts. These include the strong\ninfluence of intact families and of early educational expectations\nand self-esteem.\nExtending this analysis, Table 5 presents hierarchical generalized\nlinear models regressions of the intercepts of both indicators of\nschool abandonment and of the age slope for dropping out. Despite\nlimited between-school variance, we also regressed the Mexican-\norigin individual effect to determine how it is influenced by\ncontextual factors. These coefficients come from a multinomial\nlogit model, and, hence, the intercepts represent the average\nwithin-school log-odds of dropping out or being declared inactive\nTable 4.

For dropout rates, the associated coefficient is statistically\ninsignificant. For inactivity rates, it is significant at the 0.05 level, indicating a larger average rate in California schools.\nrelative to those who remained active or graduated. The slopes\nrepresent the net effects on these log-odds.\nTo make results interpretable, we transformed all significant\neffects into probabilities. Table 5 thus shows that the average\nprobability of dropping out in schools in this sample is 0.058 and that\nit is not affected by the ethnic composition of schools attended in\nearly adolescence. On the other hand, class composition does play\na significant role, reducing the probability by 1% for each 10%\nincrease in the average SES of schools. Note that family SES is not\nitself a significant predictor of dropping out, so that the inhibiting\ninfluence of social class on this variable is exclusively contextual.\nOlder students are more likely to drop out or be declared inactive.\nEach additional year of age increases the probability of dropping\nout by 1.5% in the average school. The hierarchical generalized\nlinear regression model also indicates a tendency for this effect to\nbecome steeper in schools with a higher percentage of Hispanic\nstudents. Results confirm that Mexican ethnic origin raises the\nprobability of dropping out and that it does so by a significant\nmargin, 5.5%, which almost doubles the sample average. An equally\nimportant finding is that this probability increases in higher-status\nschools. In other words, although for the average second-generation\nstudent attendance at a high-SES school reduces the chances of\ndropping out, for Mexican-origin children it raises it. This remark-\nable effect is portrayed in Fig. 3, which presents the relationship\nbetween dropout probabilities and class composition for the entire\nCILS sample and for its Mexican component.\nAlthough this last effect was not predicted, it is in line with the\nrationale of our second hypothesis, that is, in higher-SES (and\npresumably less ethnic) schools the tendency of Mexican-American\nstudents to drop out is heightened. This implies a lower probability\nof doing so in lower-SES (and presumably more ethnic) schools.\nThe double contextual effect of class composition (positive for most\nstudents, but negative for Mexican Americans) highlights again the\ndeleterious effect of more competitive environments for immigrant\nstudents coming from unusually disadvantaged backgrounds. These\nresults support, once again, those reported by Portes and MacLeod\nSummary\nThis article has sought to extend our knowledge of the academic\nachievement of the immigrant second generation by focusing on the\nlong-term effects of class and ethnic composition of schools. We\nfind that many of the individual-level effects reported in the\nliterature are quite stable across different school contexts. Such\nresults include the positive association of self-esteem with GPAs\nand high school graduation and the strong effects of growing up\nwith both biological parents and of early ambition on both educa-\ntional outcomes.\nOther results reproduce those found in national student samples.\nThese include the significant contextual effect of school SES in\nimproving grades and reducing the probability of dropping out. As\nfound in earlier studies, school-class-composition SES interacts\nwith family SES, compounding the already considerable advantages\nof students from more privileged backgrounds. Children of immi-\ngrants are no different in this respect from the rest of the popula-\ntion.\nResults unique to the second generation include the notably\ninvariant effect of length of U.S. residence on achievement and the\ndistinct ways in which the influence of ethnic origins play across\nschools. Longer periods of U.S. residence lower academic perfor-\nmance, and they do so regardless of school context. This result\npoints to the influence of acculturation in bringing down the initial\nachievement drive among immigrant youths to the level predomi-\nnant among native-parentage students. The sizable negative cor-\nrelations between length of U.S. residence and school engagement\nand hours of homework reported by prior studies lends further\nsupport to this conclusion (8).\nChildren of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants and\nchildren of Mexican immigrants display well known and opposite\npatterns of academic achievement. The present analysis sheds light\non what happens when coethnics constitute a large proportion of\nschool peers. We hypothesized a counterintuitive effect of ethnic\ncomposition leading to a partial attenuation of individual ethnic\neffects. The rationale for this hypothesis, drawing from recent\nliterature that points to the inhibiting effects of highly competitive\nenvironments on disadvantaged students, is well supported by the\nresults. Thus, once individual ethnic effects on average grades\n(positive for Asians and negative for Mexicans) are taken into\naccount, the presence of a greater number of coethnic acts primarily\nas a leveling factor. Our inquiry into whether this leveling effect is\nrestricted to GPA as an indicator of academic achievement shows\nthat it is not; the same result is observable in math scores for both\nethnic groups, pointing to the robustness of this effect across\nnationalities and over time.\nMexican-origin students suffer not only from lower achievement\nlevels, but also from a higher propensity to drop out of school. The\nnew finding in this analysis is that this propensity becomes greater\nin high-SES schools, contrary to what happens to other students.\nThis result suggests that dropping out represents a ``solution'' for\nstudents who confront more competitive school environments\nwhere the handicaps associated with their own backgrounds be-\ncome highly visible, subjecting them to greater discrimination by\nothers (37, 47, 48). This last finding is, of course, in line with the\nhypothesis of attenuation of individual ethnic effects in mostly\nminority (and lower SES) schools.\nConclusions\nResults from this study make clear that the class and ethnic\ncomposition of schools attended by immigrant youths in early\nadolescence make a difference and that they do so in non-\ncommon sensical ways. If our findings hold, they will have\ndefinite implications for policies seeking to improve the educa-\ntional achievement of students from different class and ethnic\nbackgrounds. A significant issue in need of attention concerns\nthe interpretation of the consistent academic advantages of\nstudents from certain immigrant origins, such as Asians, and the\ninferior performance of others, such as Mexicans. ``Culturalist''\ninterpretations have been advanced pointing to the achievement\n``ethos'' associated with a Confucian background and the lack of\nsuch drive among groups steeped in a Catholic tradition (49, 50).\nSuch facile interpretations ignore the specific historical origins of\neach immigrant group and the ways in which different contexts of\nreception have affected the socioeconomic adaptation of first-\ngeneration immigrants. Adult immigrants, who possess material\nresources are themselves highly educated and have been well\nreceived in the host society, are in a position to effectively support\nFig. 3. Effect of school SES on dropping out for Mexican and average\nstudents.\nthe education of their offspring. This is the path followed by Chinese\nand Koreans, immigrants with high-average levels of education and\nwho, as legal immigrants, are entitled to the full protection of the\nlaw. In the case of the Vietnamese, lower levels of education were\ncompensated by a still more favorable official reception. As refu-\ngees from a communist regime, they were entitled to generous\nNo such help has been received by Mexican immigrants who have\nthe lowest average levels of education and occupational skills of any\nsizable immigrant group in the United States and who experience,\nin addition, a negative reception by the host society and govern-\nment. The low levels of human capital among Mexicans are not a\nconsequence of extraordinarily poor education in their country of\norigin, but of its geographical proximity to the United States. Other\nless developed countries have lower average educational levels than\nMexico but do not share a 2,000-mile border with the richest\ncountry in the world. This geographical accident has enabled tens\nof thousands of Mexican peasants and unskilled workers to migrate\nby land in search of manual jobs (53\u00ad55).\nThe presence of so many poor and poorly educated Mexican\nmigrants reinforces already strong stereotypes in the American\npopulation and contributes to a highly negative reception. Govern-\nment authorities regard Mexicans as potentially illegal entrants and\ntreat them accordingly. The general public perceives them as part\nof a ``Third World invasion'' by the poor and downtrodden from\nother lands (50). Simultaneously, and despite these stereotypes,\nMexican laborers continue to be in high demand in agribusiness, the\nconstruction industry, personal services, and other labor-intensive\nsectors.\nPoor and poorly educated migrant workers congregate in tran-\nsient and discriminated communities that cannot muster the min-\nimum material and social resources to foster the economic progress\nof their own members, much less provide for the educational\nsuccess of their offspring. Mexican youths bring to school a com-\nmon experience of poverty and a lack of knowledge of the means\nand the importance of succeeding educationally. The consistent\nnegative ``Mexican'' coefficient in our own study and in previous\nanalyses of academic attainment directly reflects these realities.\nDespite such handicaps, the majority of Mexican-American\nstudents still manage to graduate from high school and a minority\neven moves up to college. That achievement, which reflects the\nresilience of individual determination despite adverse external\ncircumstances, should not lead us to forget that differences among\nfirst-generation immigrants in human capital and contexts of re-\nception cumulate over time, leading to large subsequent inequali-\nties. Should American society wish to achieve a minimum level of\nequality among its newest citizens, measures are urgently needed to\nbuild family and community resources capable of supporting the\neducation of the young.\nSchools, especially the inner-city schools that disadvantaged\nminorities attend, will not accomplish this task. The key lies in the\nfamily and community institutions that immigrant groups can\ndevelop, but that in the case of those made up mostly of low-skilled\nworkers require extensive outside support (42). Prior results based\non a large survey of adult immigrants found that all immigrant\nparents, regardless of nationality, have high educational aspirations\nfor their offspring and are willing to endure major sacrifices to\nachieve these goals (8). Poorly educated and poorly received\nmigrant laborers living in transient communities lack, however, the\nknow-how or the resources to accomplish those ends. Mexicans are\nnot only the largest immigrant group in the nation but one which,\nfor the reasons explained previously, are among the most prone to\nfind themselves in this situation. To the extent that immigration\ncontinues to meet the nation's demand for manual labor, compen-\nsatory programs of support to immigrant families and communities\nmust be put in place lest we confine a large number of these\nworkers' children to poverty and permanent social exclusion.\nThe data on which this article is based were collected as part of the CILS\nsupported by National Science Foundation Grant SBR902255, the\nSpencer Foundation, the Andrew W.
