Jafar, MD, MPH; Muhammad Islam, BSc; Neil Poulter, MD; Juanita Hatcher, PhD;\nChristopher H. Schmid, PhD; Andrew S. Levey, MD; Nish Chaturvedi, MD\nBackground--Blood pressure during childhood is an established predictor of adult blood pressure, which in turn increases\nmortality as a result of cardiovascular disease. Adult South Asian populations are particularly predisposed to\ncardiovascular disease compared with whites, but the prevalence of high blood pressure and determinants of blood\npressure in South Asian children have not been explored or compared with those of white children.\nMethods and Results--Analyses were performed on 5641 South Asian children 5 to 14 years old included in the nationally\nincluded in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (1988\u00ad1994). Anthropometric\nmeasurements were obtained. Blood pressure was measured twice in the seated position with a mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer and an appropriate-size cuff. High blood pressure was defined as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure level that\nwas 95th percentile of age-, sex-, and height-percentile\u00adspecific reference level for the US population. Mean body\nmass index (BMI)\u00adadjusted blood pressure values were compared among children in 2 data sets by use of linear\nregression analysis. The overall prevalence (95% CI) of high blood pressure in South Asian children 5 to 14 years old\ncontrast with the predicted 5% prevalence of high blood pressure in children in the United States (P0.001). The mean\nConclusions--South Asian children have higher body-mass\u00adadjusted blood pressure levels than white children in the United\nStates. Further studies are needed to determine factors responsible for these differences. Immediate attention is needed to\nKey Words: blood pressure  pediatrics  epidemiology  ethnic groups\nMigrant populations of South Asian origin (India, Paki-\nstan, and Bangladesh) living in the West are at higher\nrisk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with\nwhites,1\u00ad3 but the problems of noncommunicable diseases are\nnot limited only to South Asian populations residing in the\nWest. South Asian countries, home to approximately one\nquarter of the world's population, are major contributors to\nthe global burden of CVD at present, and this contribution is\nprojected to grow, given their consistent population growth\nrates.4 Hypertension, the most common risk factor for CVD,\nhas now become a major health problem in Pakistan, affect-\nyears old.5 Thus, prevention of high blood pressure and CVD\nneeds urgent attention in South Asia.\nThe knowledge that blood pressure during childhood is an\nestablished predictor of adult blood pressure, which in turn\nincreases mortality from CVD, clearly underscores the impor-\ntance of studying childhood blood pressure and the need for\nestablishing preventive measures in early life.6,7 The Fourth\nReport on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High\nBlood Pressure in Children and Adolescents recommends age-,\nsex-, and height-specific values that are at 95th percentile of\nnormative systolic and diastolic blood pressure values as diag-\nnostic of high blood pressure in childhood.8 Unfortunately, data\non age-specific blood pressure levels in children of South Asian\norigin are scarce. To date, studies of blood pressure in South\nAsian children have suffered from inadequate sample size or\nhave been restricted to distinct communities.9\u00ad12\nFrom the Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Community Health Sciences (T.H.J., J.H.), the Section of Nephrology, Department of Medicine\n(T.H.J.), and the Department of Medicine (M.I.), Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan; the Division of Nephrology (T.H.J., A.S.L.) and the Division\nof Clinical Care Research (C.H.S.), Tufts-New England Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine School, Boston,\nMass; and the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK (N.P., N.C.).\nCorrespondence to Dr Tazeen H.

The details of sampling, design, components,\nsurvey instrument, and quality control have been reported previous-\nly.5,15 Briefly, the survey was conducted on a nationally representa-\n2400 urban and rural households after informed consent had been\nobtained. A 2-stage stratified design was used. The urban and rural\nareas of each of the 4 provinces of Pakistan were taken as strata.\nThere were 80 urban or rural primary sampling units. A total of 30\nhouseholds were drawn into the sample from each unit, and all\nresidents of the household were included in the study. The overall\nindividual response rate was 92.6%. The total number of individuals\nData on demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health-related\nvariables were collected by use of a questionnaire validated in local\nlanguages. Physicians at mobile examination centers performed a\nstandardized physical examination. Mothers were proxy respondents\nfor children 12 years old. Trained technicians performed anthro-\npometric examinations. Blood pressure was measured by certified\nphysicians in a standardized manner. Blood pressure certification\nconsisted of measurement performance on live volunteers. As in\nNHANES III, the physician selected one of 5 (infant, child, adult,\nlarge adult, and thigh) cuff sizes for blood pressure measurement on\nthe basis of the size of the participant's arm. Blood pressure was\nmeasured in the seated position by use of a mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer with the right forearm horizontal on a table. After the\nappropriate-size cuff for children had been applied (covering approx-\nimately two thirds of the upper arm), the cuff was gradually inflated\nto approximately 20 mm Hg above the point at which the radial pulse\ndisappeared. The pressure within the cuff was then released at a rate\nof approximately 2 mm Hg/s while auscultating with a stethoscope\nover the brachial artery. The onset of sound (Korotkoff phase I) was\nindicative of systolic blood pressure, and the disappearance of the\nsound (Korotkoff phase V) was taken as indicative of diastolic blood\npressure.16 Two readings were recorded at an interval of 1 to 2\nminutes, and the cuff was completely deflated between the readings.\nThe mean of 2 readings was calculated for final analysis.\nWeight and height were recorded for each individual in light\nclothing without shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Pulse rate\nwas measured by noting pulsations of the radial artery at the right\nwrist in the sitting position. Quality control for the survey and blood\npressure measurements included a visit to the field by expert\nconsultants, duplicate examination by field supervisors, calibration\nprotocols, and retraining exercises.15\nUrban and rural areas were classified according to the definition\nused by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, according to which thinly\npopulated, largely agricultural areas (5000 people) with poor\navailability of basic amenities (eg, electricity) are considered rural.14\nEthnicity was reported as \"mother tongue,\" which is specific for each\nof the 5 major ethnic subgroups of Pakistan: Muhajir, Punjabi,\nSindhi, Pashtun, and Baluchi. Levels of socioeconomic status were\ndefined through a count of the number of items owned. An index of\nhousehold item (eg, television, refrigerator, automobile) ownership\nwas constructed by summing up items owned by the household. This\nmethodology has been shown to be particularly useful for measuring\nhealth inequalities that result from the direct effects of material\nconditions and has been validated previously.17,18 Two components\nof saturated fat intake were defined: (1) intake of ghee (hydrogenated\noil/clarified butter), depending on whether or not these were con-\nsumed daily, and (2) meat (animal fat) intake, depending on whether\nor not the meat was consumed at least every other day. High intakes\nof calcium and potassium were defined as daily consumption of dairy\nproducts and fruits, respectively.\nHigh blood pressure in children was defined as systolic or diastolic\nblood pressure of 95 percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific\nlevels of blood pressure of the reference US population.8\nA family history of hypertension was defined by the presence of\nhypertension (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic\nblood pressure 90 mm Hg based on the mean of 2 readings, or\ncurrent therapy with antihypertensive medications) in any adult\nmember (15 years old) of the household.\nNHANES III is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of\nthe population in the United States. Details of its design and conduct\nhave been published previously.13 As in NHSP, blood pressure\nmeasurements were obtained in the seated position for children 5\nyears old or older in a standardized manner with a mercury\nsphygmomanometer.13 Although 3 readings of blood pressure were\nrecorded, to be consistent with NHSP, a mean of the first 2 readings\nwas calculated for our analysis (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/\nchildren 5 to 14 years old were included in NHANES III. Of these, 2224\nbelonged to the black race and were excluded from this analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nAge- and height-percentile\u00adspecific systolic and diastolic blood\npressure values for South Asian children 5 to 14 years old from\nNHSP data were plotted on normograms derived for the US\npopulation.8 The overall and age-specific prevalence of high blood\npressure was computed for South Asian children and compared with\nthe overall prevalence of the same in children in the United States by\nuse of 2 test.\nLinear regression analyses were used for the outcomes of systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure levels to determine the association of\nethnicity (United States versus Pakistan) after adjustment for BMI.\nTo assess the reproducibility of blood pressure readings in the 2\nsurveys, the mean difference (SEM) between the first and the second\nreadings and the correlation between the 2 were computed.\nThe associations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with\nsociodemographic and clinical characteristics were studied by use of\nunivariate and multivariate analyses in children 5 to 14 years old in\nthe NHSP data. The candidate predictor list included ethnicity; age;\nsex; BMI; low versus high socioeconomic status; urban versus rural\ndwelling; consumption of food rich in saturated fats (meat and ghee),\npotassium (fruits), and calcium (dairy products); and a family history\nof hypertension and heart rate.\nStepwise linear regression analyses were conducted by use of\nforward selection with an entry criterion of P0.1 for the primary\noutcomes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. All adjusted\nassociated factors of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were\nretained in the respective final models. In addition, variables signif-\nicantly associated with the outcome (P0.05) in the univariate\nanalyses were forced into the multivariate models. Interactions\nbetween age, ethnicity, BMI, and sex with each other and with other\nvariables were tested in the final models.

Using blood pressure\u00ad\nnormative data in children in the United States as reference,\nthe overall prevalence (95% CI) of high blood pressure in\n9.8%) in girls.8 The BMI-standardized levels of diastolic\nblood pressure were significantly higher in South Asian\nchildren compared with those in the United States.13\nAn increased prevalence of childhood cardiovascular risk\nfactors is predictive of increased carotid intimal-medial thick-\nness, which is a determinant of cardiovascular events.19,20\nRecent data from the population-based Bogalusa Heart Study\nand the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study show that\nsystolic blood pressure elevations beginning in childhood are\na consistent predictor of arterial stiffness in young adults.6,19\nNumerous studies have highlighted the importance of diastol-\nic blood pressure in children, which has been suggested to be\na good predictor of adult hypertension and CVD.21,22 Lower-\ning blood pressure in hypertensive adults slows the progres-\nsion of arterial stiffness and lowers the risk of CVD.23,24\nThus, institution of measures during childhood for prevention\nof high blood pressure is essential for optimal risk reduction\nof CVD.\nIt is interesting to note that prevalence of high blood\npressure is greater among children in Pakistan (12%) com-\npared with the 5% predicted for children in the United States.8\nThis is despite lower BMIs of Pakistani children.13 The\nreason for this paradox is unclear but could be attributed to\nethnic differences between the 2 populations. Ethnic differ-\nences in blood pressure have been reported in other popula-\ntions as well.1,25,26 Prospective studies are needed to explore\nthe potential relationships between ethnicity and blood\npressure.\nFurthermore, low birth weight has been shown to be\nassociated with chronic diseases, including diabetes and high\nblood pressure,27\u00ad29 though this notion has been challenged\nby some.30 Adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including ma-\nternal morbidity and mortality, intrauterine growth retarda-\ntion, and low-birth-weight infants, are much more common in\ndeveloping countries, especially South Asia, compared with\nthe West.31,32 Whether a greater prevalence of high blood\npressure in South Asian children despite lower BMIs is a\nreflection of lower birth weight remains to be determined.29,33\nOur findings also raise the important question of the\nsuitability of criteria for diagnosis of high blood pressure in\nSouth Asian children. The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis,\nEvaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Chil-\ndren and Adolescents recommends age-, sex-, and height-\nspecific blood pressure values that are above the 95th\npercentile of normative systolic and diastolic blood pressure\nvalues among the US population as diagnostic of high blood\npressure in childhood.8 On the basis of this definition, 5% of\nchildren in any given population would be classified as\nhaving high blood pressure. Using the 95th percentile for\nblood pressure recorded among children in the United States\nas reference, the prevalence of high blood pressure in children\nbe assumed that the threshold blood pressure level for\nend-organ damage would be higher for South Asian children.\nTherefore, appropriate reference populations and blood pres-\nsure cutoff values for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in\nchildren of South Asian as well as other ethnic descent need\nto be determined.\nBMI-specific blood pressure levels in children in Pakistan vs\nwhite children in the United States. Data are on 5374 South\n75th, and 95th percentiles of values in NHSP data.

The same trend has been reported from other\ndeveloping regions of the world.34 The poorer health facilities\nand lower literacy status of women in rural versus urban areas\nlead to a greater proportion of adverse outcomes of pregnan-\ncy,35,36 one manifestation of which could be elevated blood\npressure during childhood.27\u00ad29 The reason for higher blood\npressure in rural versus urban children in Pakistan deserves\nfurther study.\nObesity during childhood has been reported to be strongly\nassociated with systolic blood pressure in children and in\nadults.37 We also observed significant relationships between\nblood pressure and BMI in children. This is despite lower\nBMIs of children in Pakistan compared with those in the\nWest. Recent evidence suggests that because of differences in\nbody stature, an equally high BMI confers more CVD risks in\nAsian than in white populations.38,39 Therefore, the recent\nWHO guidelines for defining obesity suggest lower cutoff\nvalues of BMI in the Asian population.40 It is therefore\nimportant to develop population-based distribution for com-\nputing appropriate age-, sex-, and BMI-specific blood pres-\nsure levels for children in this population.\nPreviously, we reported an independent association be-\ntween high meat intake (as a proxy for animal fat consump-\ntion) and hypertension in Pakistani adults.5 We now report the\nsame association with systolic and diastolic blood pressures\nin children. In addition, ghee consumption was also positively\nand independently associated with diastolic blood pressure in\nchildren. Ghee contains cholesterol oxides that are thought to\nbe related to atherosclerosis.41 Our finding of an independent\nassociation between high saturated fat content in diet and\nblood pressure are consistent with those of the Bogalusa\nTABLE 3.

Multivariate analysis of data on South Asian children\nrevealed that these differences persisted even after adjustment\nfor sociodemographic factors. This is consistent with our\nfindings in adults.5 The mechanisms responsible for the sex\ndifferences in blood pressure levels are not clear, although it\nis speculated that interactions between sex hormones and the\nkidneys could play a protective role in premenopausal wom-\nen.44 The potential role of sex hormones on blood pressure in\nwomen needs further study.\nOur study has some limitations. First, the differences in\nprotocols and methodologies between the 2 surveys could\nlead to differences in blood pressure measurements. Still,\nboth the NHANES III and NHSP were designed and con-\nducted under the supervision of NCHS and used similar\nsampling rationales and techniques for measuring blood\npressure and BMI. Second, higher blood pressure levels in\nNHSP versus NHANES could reflect a \"white-coat effect\"\nbecause of less familiarity of Pakistani children with receiv-\ning blood pressure measurement. This is unlikely to explain\nthe entire difference in blood pressure levels between the 2\npopulations, however, because the white-coat effect tends to\naffect systolic blood pressure more than diastolic blood\npressure, and the differences in the levels of the latter were\ngreater than those in the former. Furthermore, comparison of\ndata after adjustment for pulse rate, which is expected to\nincrease with the white-coat effect, revealed consistent results\n(data not shown). Third, diastolic blood pressure levels are\ntraditionally more difficult to measure. Therefore, a wider\ndifference in levels of this component of blood pressure\nbetween the US and Pakistani children may have several\ninterpretations. These include true findings versus measure-\nment errors. Furthermore, higher correlation between the 2\nreadings of diastolic blood pressure in NHSP (r0.93) than\nin NHANES (r0.73) could reflect expectation bias on the\npart of the NHSP research staff, though it is equally likely to\nbe a result of adherence of the latter to the study protocol.\nFourth, the blood pressure levels recorded in our study are\nbased on an average of 2 readings at a single visit. A more\nprecise clinical estimate would include measurements from\n3 separate occasions. Still, multiple readings of blood\npressure from the same day are considered appropriate for\nepidemiological studies.13 Furthermore, comparative blood\npressure levels from the US population reported in this article\nare also based on an average of 2 readings at a single visit.\nMoreover, the reproducibility of the second reading of blood\npressure compared with the first was good. In addition, our\nmain findings were similar on comparison with data collected\non children 8 to 14 years old during NHSP with NHANES\n2 readings of blood pressure obtained during NHANES III.\nFinally, it is remarkable that despite the lower BMIs of\nPakistani children, their blood pressure levels are higher than\nAmerican children, and even equal levels of blood pressure\nbetween the 2 populations would have been noteworthy.\nThus, we believe that our findings are robust and alarming.\nIn the analysis for factors associated with blood pressure in\nPakistani children, we did not adjust for all known environ-\nmental risk factors for high blood pressure. For instance,\ninformation on sodium intake and physical activity was not\ncollected during the NHSP.45 Rural areas of Pakistan have the\nhighest proportion of the labor force employed in the agri-\ncultural sector, ie, approximately 63.8%, whereas in the urban\nareas, it is only 7.6%.46 It is known that child labor in the\nagricultural sector accounts for 70% of working children\nglobally and in South Asia.47 Hence, physical activity is\nlikely to be greater among rural than urban children. There-\nfore, it is perhaps surprising that blood pressures were higher\namong rural children, and an evaluation of causative factors\nfor raised blood pressure in rural areas is required. Finally, the\nfood frequency questionnaire used during NHSP has not been\nvalidated. Nevertheless, our findings warrant an in-depth\nassessment of the potential dietary associations with blood\npressure and development of validated dietary questionnaires\nin the native South Asian population.\nIn conclusion, this is the first report on levels and associ-\nates of blood pressure in a native South Asian sample of\nnationally representative children of Pakistan. We found that\nusing the blood pressure normograms for children in the\nUnited States as reference, the prevalence of high blood\n13.7%). This is substantially greater than the 5% predicted\nprevalence of high blood pressure in children in the United\nStates based on same criteria, despite the lower BMIs of\nSouth Asian children.8 The reasons for higher blood pressure\nlevels in South Asian children versus those in the United\nStates need exploration. The adjusted associated factors of\nhigh blood pressure in South Asian children identified in our\nstudy need immediate attention. Effective ways of identifying\nSouth Asian children at high risk of high blood pressure and\nCVD need to be identified and implemented.\n"
