The purpose of this study is to explore Taiwanese\ncollege students' needs for English E-learning websites. Accordingly, this paper uses the unified theory of acceptance and\nuse of technology to investigate and explain Taiwanese college students' acceptance of English E-learning websites. After\nanalysis, the results demonstrate that performance expectations, effort expectancy, and social influence have positive effects\non behavior intentions and facilitating conditions; behavioral intentions also have positive effects on use behavior. Overall,\nif students believe that English E-learning websites can help them increase their performance and that they are easy to use,\nthere is an increase in their intention to use them. This suggests that web designers should improve knowledge management\nfunctions and improve user interfaces to be easier to operate.\n",

In other words, learning via\nthe Internet can enhance studying efficiency. Everyone has\naccess to knowledge more than ever before through the\nInternet. In addition, E-learning is accessible from any loca-\ntion. The Internet, computers, satellite broadcasting, audio\nand videotapes, interactive television and CDs are all exam-\nples of multimedia. Moreover, we can learn about a wide\nrange of topics through the Internet and are not limited by\nphysical constraints, such as the need to cram schools and\nclassrooms with students, and so on.\nTsai (2009) has developed courseware for semiconductor\ntechnology that overcomes problems encountered in devel-\noping English Special Programs (ESP) in Taiwan. In the\ndesign of the courseware, five skills for learning English (lis-\ntening, speaking, reading, writing, and translation) have been\nconsidered and a 3D multimedia technique has been used to\npromote learning interest, student engagement, and effi-\nciency. Students report they have benefited from the course-\nwareimplementation.Theyreportthatthemultimedia-assisted\nenvironment promotes learning effectiveness (Sihar, Hj Ab\nTaiwan has an extremely competitive infrastructure for\ninformation and communication technology.

The research results may be\nutilized in future English E-learning website service devel-\nopment suggestions, and to improve usability and adaptabil-\nity. Although this research is based on Taiwanese college\nstudents, the results should be relevant to other language\nlearners.\nWe attempted to explore Taiwanese college students'\nintentions to use English E-learning websites. The unified\ntheory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model\nwas used to assess the technological and value issues and\nthus obtain an understanding of Taiwanese college students'\ndecisions to use English E-learning website services.\nBased on these facts, this study aims to focus on three\nobjectives:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To identify the influence of the UTAUT factors on the\nadoption of English E-learning websites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To understand college students' needs for English\nE-learning websites in Taiwan.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To understand the influence of online English\nE-learning on students' behavior in Taiwan.\nLiterature review\nE-Learning\nE-learning is changing the way education is implemented\nand perceived. Schools can take advantage of this technol-\nogy to make learning faster, cheaper, and more effective.\nThese types of improvements are especially appealing to cor-\nporations. Corporate executives have begun to recognize that\nhigh-quality training creates long-term competitive advan-\ntages. They increasingly realize that effective education's\nstrategic benefits can outweigh its costs. (Hambrect and Co,\nWith the rapid growth of e-learning, a technological revo-\nlution is currently taking place in institutions of higher learn-\ning (Sihar et al., 2011). E-learning is a learner-centered\neducational system that enables learners to learn whenever,\nwherever, and whatever they wish, according to their learn-\nThe organizational structure of learning should be consis-\ntent with knowledge management practices in schools. In\naddition to social interaction among teachers, it is necessary\nto facilitate resource management (e.g., time and space shar-\ning) that contributes to teaching and learning because it pro-\nvides an environment where knowledge management\npractices take place. For example, schools need to consider\nwhat types of IT resources are important to develop physical\nand online environments for sharing and whether teachers\nare able to use them effectively (Leung, 2010).\nAs research observes, however, the use of technology has\npositive performance effects when learning foreign lan-\nguages and also improves students' motivation.\nDefinition of E-learning.E-learning is also called computer-\nassisted instruction, Web-based learning, distributed learn-\ning, online learning, or Internet-based learning. There are\ntwo E-learning modes. The first is computer-assisted instruc-\ntion, which uses computers to aid in the delivery of stand-\nalone multimedia packages for teaching and learning. The\nsecond mode is distance learning, which uses information\ntechnologies to deliver instruction to remote learners from a\ncentral site.\nA traditional approach is a face-to-face approach, which\nis similar to Osborn's definition. An electronic approach may\nincorporate teleconferencing, chat rooms, or discussion\nboards. Instant messaging is a most common communication\nchannel on the web, through such famous services like\nMicrosoft MSN, Yahoo Messenger and Skype (Lin, 2009).\nE-learning is becoming a major component in academia\ntoday.There is a need for formalized guidelines in E-Learning\nthat instruct the designer (course instructor) on how to\ndesign, maintain, and manage a course. There are a wide\nvariety of E-learning systems available on the market.\nContent available web learning is variable: some of it is\nexcellent, but much is mediocre. The needs of content devel-\nopers, educators, and students cannot be addressed through\nmany available E-learning services; there are gaps that need\nto be addressed (Jayanthi, Srivatsa, & Ramesh, 2007).\nBenefit of E-learning.Communication technologies such as\nthe Internet are creating abundant opportunities to facilitate\nlearning (Wang, 2008). One drawback may be that learners\nmust be more responsible for themselves in E-learning envi-\nronments. However, this also provides more opportunities\nfor learners to choose their own directions and set their own\npace. Systems can also provide materials that are fine-tuned\nto users' needs.\nAs .NET framework-specific distributed technology,\n.NET remoting is not designed to provide interoperability or\ncrossing trust boundaries to third-party clients. On the other\nhand, .NET remoting provides faster communication speed\nover internal networks. (Amirian & Alesheikh, 2008).\nChen and Tsai (2011) conducted a study regarding Virtual\nClassroom development, providing several strategies for\nbuilding up prospective e-classroom districts or schools.\nIn December 2009, another study evaluated three\nE-learning systems in Iran that have been used in well-known\nuniversities: the Iran University of Science and Technology\n(IUST), the AmirKabir University of Technology (AUT),\nand the Virtual University of Shiraz (SVU), all of which are\nlocated in Tehran. All of these universities provided high-\nquality E-learning systems for students and have collected\nsome information regarding the systems' performance\nthrough interviews with students and staff (Etaati, Sadi-\nEmpirical studies have applied media psychology to\nexamine esthetic-emotion items, treated as adjectives associ-\nated with the two motivational models (MMs) developed by\nKeller, Malone, and Lepper, which are suited for formal and\ninformal visual environments, respectively. Exploratory fac-\ntor analysis (EFA) has been performed on aesthetic-emotion\nitems in two studies to develop a scale to measure learners'\nmotivation (Riaz, Rambli, Salleh, & Mushtaq, 2011).\nFurthermore, the expanding multimedia capabilities of\nnew technologies provide vast opportunities to engage and\nmotivate learners.\nTable 1 shows the comparisons between traditional class-\nroom learning and E-learning.\nAdoption Theories\nA wide body of research focuses on identifying factors\naffecting people's intentions to use new technologies and\nhow these intentions predict actual usage (Davis, Bagozzi, &\nWarshaw, 1989). The following sections summarize some of\nthe major theories.\nInnovation diffusion theory (IDT). IDT seeks to explain the\nprocess by which users adapt technological advances\n(Rogers, 1995; Figure 1). The theory's core constructs and\ndefinitions are shown in Table 2. Since the 1960s, it has\nbeen applied to the study of topics as diverse as agricul-\ntural tools and organizational innovation (Tornatzky &\nKlein, 1982). The five factors from this model along with\ntwo additional factors introduced by Moore and Benbasat\n(1991) were adapted to information system innovations\n(Table 3; Figure 2).\nTheory of reasoned action (TRA). The TRA is a fundamental\nmodel that was created by social psychologists to study con-\nscious intentional behavior (Fishbein, & Ajzen, 1975; Figure\n3). It has been incredibly influential and applied to a wide\nvariety of behavior (Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988).\nDavis et al. (1989) used it to study acceptance of new tech-\nnologies and obtained results that were consistent with previ-\nous studies of other behavior. The core constructs and\ndefinitions are shown in Table 4.\nTheory of planned behavior (TPB).TPB expanded TRA with\nthe concept of \"perceived behavioral control\" (Table 5).\nAjzen (1991) reviewed studies that used TPB successfully\nfor a wide range of intentions and behaviors (Figure 4). It has\nbeen effective in predicting acceptance and use of many dif-\nferent technologies (Harrison, Mykytyn, & Riemenschnei-\nTechnology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Extended TAM\n(TAM2). TAM was designed to predict information technol-\nogy acceptance and usage related to labor (Figure 5). Unlike\nTRA, the final conception of TAM does not include the atti-\ntude construct; this is to better explain intention parsimoni-\nously. TAM has been widely applied to a diverse set of\ntechnologies and users (Table 6).\nTAM2 enlarged TAM by including \"subjective norm\" as\nan additional predictor of intention in the case of mandatory\nsettings (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000; Figure 6). It is modified\nfrom TAM and includes more variables (Table 7).\nCombinedTAM andTPB (C-TAM-TPB). C-TAM-TPB combines\nthe predictors of TPB with perceived usefulness from TAM\nto supply a hybrid model (Taylor & Todd, 1995; Table 8;\nSocial cognitive theory (SCT). SCT is one of the most compre-\nhensive theories of human behavior (Bandura, 1986).\nTable 1.

Several studies have examined motivational theory and\nadapted it to specific contexts (Table 11).\nUTAUT\nUTAUT is a model of individual acceptance that is compiled\nfrom eight models and theories (TRA, TAM, MM, TPB,\nC-TAM-TPB, MPCU, IDT, and SCT; Venkatesh, Morris,\nEach of the constructs mentioned in IDT, TRA, TAM,\nTPB, C-TAM-TPB, MPCU, MM, and SCT pertained to\none of UTAUT's main constructs and measurement items\nThe purpose of formulating UTAUT was to integrate the\nfragmented theory and research on individual acceptance of\ninformation technology into a unified theoretical model\n(Venkatesh et al., 2003). To do so, the eight specific models\nof the determinants of intention and usage of information\ntechnology were compared and conceptual and empirical\nsimilarities across these models were used to formulate\nTo conclude, UTAUT advanced individual acceptance\nresearch by unifying the theoretical perspectives common in\nthe literature and incorporating four moderators to account\nfor dynamic influences, including gender, age, voluntariness,\nand experience (Venkatesh et al., 2003). It seems reasonable\nto assume that UTAUT could be used to study the acceptance\nand use of English learning websites. We therefore intro-\nduced subjective task value to UTAUT in addressing our\nresearch question.\nMethod\nResearch Model\nIn this study, we use UTAUT to study acceptance and use of\nEnglish E-learning websites by Taiwanese college students.\nAccording to UTAUT, four factors influence use of English\nE-learning websites: performance expectancy, effort expec-\ntancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions.\nWe did not consider the moderating effect of gender, age,\nexperience, and voluntariness in this study. Because our par-\nticipants are all college students, the gender, age, experience,\n6 SAGE Open\nAttitude toward\nUsing\nBehavioral\nIntention to Use\nActual\nSystem Use\nPerceived\nUsefulness\nPerceived\nEase of Use\nPerceived\nUsefulness\nNote.

Therefore, we have made some\nalterations to our research model (Figure 9).\nHypotheses\nThe UTAUT model integrates the eight theoretical models\nnoted above and is composed of the core determinants of\nusage intention (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Of the four core\ndeterminants, performance expectancy, effort expectancy,\nand social influence significantly predict intention. The\nUTAUT model is well suited to the context of this study.\nBased to these observations, we developed the hypotheses of\nthis study.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 1: Performance expectancy positively\naffects users' intentions to use English E-learning\nwebsites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 2: Effect expectancy positively affects\nusers' intentions to use English E-learning websites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 3: Social influence positively affects\nusers' intentions to use English E-learning websites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 4: Facilitating conditions of English\nE-learning websites positively affects users' use\nbehaviors of actually using English E-learning\nwebsites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 5: Users' behavioral intentions to use\nEnglish E-learning websites positively affect the\nusers' use behavior of actually using English\nE-learning websites.\nProcedures\nThe data were gathered from college students in Taiwan. The\nquestionnaire of this study was modified from the question\nitems of Venkatesh et al. (2003). Because the questions from\nthe Chinese questionnaire were translated from English, the\nquestionnaire was first pretested on four Taiwanese college\nstudents and was then slightly modified according to their\nfeedback before being scanned by two foreign language pro-\nfessors. The initial tests demonstrated high reliability. The\nquestionnaire was placed on the MY3Q questionnaire web-\nsite (http://www.my3q.com) and sent to a random sample of\nTaiwanese college students.\nParticipants\nThe participants of this study are college students in Taiwan.\nWe collected data from 176 respondents from more than 10\nTaiwanese colleges.

In addition to demographic information, this\npaper-based questionnaire collected data from individual\nusers of English E-learning websites based on a number of\nconstructs in the research model. Earlier research by\nVenkatesh et al. (2003) had validated measures for each of\nthe constructs; we decided to include those validated items in\nour questionnaire.

The Confirmation of Hypotheses.\nHypotheses Confirmed\nH1: Performance expectancy positively affects users'\nintentions to use English E-learning websites\nYes\nH2: Effect expectancy positively affects users'\nintentions to use English E-learning websites\nYes\nH3: Social influence positively affects users' intentions\nto use English E-learning websites\nYes\nH4: Facilitating conditions of English E-learning\nwebsites positively affects users' use behavior of\nactually using English E-learning websites\nYes\nH5: Users' behavioral intentions to use English\nE-learning websites positively affect the users'\nuse behavior of actually using English E-learning\nwebsites\nYes\nthat when students expect an English E-learning website to\nbe easy to use, they increase their intentions to use it.\nThe influence of students' Social Influence to use English\nE-learning websites on intention to use English E-learning\nwebsites.The results showed that Performance Expec-\ntancy positively affects users' intentions to use English\nsupported. This means that when students' teachers, peers\nor someone important to them suggests that they use Eng-\nlish E-learning websites, they increase their intentions to\nuse them.\nThe influence of students' Facilitating Conditions for using Eng-\nlish E-learning websites on use behavior. The results showed\nthat Facilitating Conditions positively affect users' use\nbehavior of actually using English E-learning websites ( =\nwhen students receive more facilitating conditions to use\nEnglish E-learning website, they use the websites more\nfrequently.\nThe influence of students' Intention to Use English E-learning\nwebsites on use behavior. The results showed that Intention to\nUse positively affects users' use behavior of actually using\nEnglish E-learning websites ( = .098, p < .01). Therefore,\nH5 is supported. This means that when students have more\nintent to use an English E-learning website, they use the\nwebsite more frequently (Table 20).\nDiscussion\nConclusion\nThe results support the UTAUT model's use to study the accep-\ntance of English E-learning websites.The UTAUTmodel shows\nthat students' use behavior of English E-learning websites\ndepends on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and\nsocial influence. Therefore, we suggest that web designers\nimprove knowledge management functions and make user inter-\nfaces easier to operate. Furthermore, students should be notified\nthat the websites can be supported by facilitating conditions.\nLimitations and suggestions\nBecause this study only examines the acceptance of English\nE-learning websites among Taiwanese college students, the\nresults may not be generalized to other E-learning systems\nand countries. Therefore, we suggest that a future researcher\nvalidate the model and findings in other E-learning systems\nor other countries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjzen, I.
