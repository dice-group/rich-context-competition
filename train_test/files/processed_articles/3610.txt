Digital\ntechnologies allow those with resources and know-how to\ncreate, track, and sort enormous sets of data whether they be\nglobal trends on heart disease or the \"cacophony of short-\nburst\" communications that define the social media platform\nTwitter (Carr, 2010). We see the emergence of products like\nGoogle Glass, eyeglasses that overlay data on top of our\ndaily experiences. Through the glasses, we can video chat\nwith friends, interface with Google maps, or have updates\npushed to us about, for instance, suspended subway services.\nA likely fix in a world full of data: more data to solve prob-\nlems of more data.\nData are ubiquitous in IBM's \"Smarter Planet\" advertise-\nments about the coming \"tsunami of information\"--Radio-\nFrequency Identification (RFID) chip transmissions, store\ntransactions, medical records, emails, photos, videos, blogs,\ntraffic patterns, and so on. One of the commercials in the\nseries asks, \"What if technology could capture all this infor-\nmation and turn it into intelligence?\" IBM could help you\nidentify patterns faster and \"pull insights from the noise.\"\nThe company could help organizations \"manage their peo-\nple\" and \"mitigate risk.\" And, most importantly, they can\nhelp you \"convert data into action\" (infoondemand, 2009).\nCharles Duhigg's (2012) New York Times Magazine piece\n\"How Companies Learn Your Secrets\" offers us another look\ninto the mysterious world of data. Duhigg tells the tale of\nhow Target uses data science to better understand its custom-\ners. One of the more humorous and alarming examples is\nhow Target cross-references purchases to figure out when a\nfamily is pregnant, even though they have not told Target.\nBecause these algorithmic calculations are based on shop-\nping data, Target can better target ads and discounts more\nstrategically to these families.\nThese are just a few examples of the way our everyday\nlives are being translated into data. On one hand, access to\ndata is cast as a coping mechanism for a world overrun with\ndata. On the other hand, these data are cast as a treasure trove\nfor businesses seeking audience attention. This emphasis on\ncreating, managing, and utilizing data falls under the buzz\nphrase \"Big Data\"--data sets too large for traditional com-\nputation, and the technologies, engineers, and statisticians\nwho support it.\nTelevision companies are also experimenting with lever-\naging Big Data as a way to understand audiences and man-\nage risk in a data-rich digital media landscape. One of the\n1Kennesaw State University, Marietta, GA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael Lahey, Digital Writing and Media Arts Department, Kennesaw\nEmail: mlahey@kennesaw.edu\nEveryday Life as a Text: Soft Control,\nTelevision, and Twitter\nMichael Lahey1\n Keywords\ndata, digital, everyday life, social TV, soft control\n2 SAGE Open\nreasons the television industry wants to understand its audi-\nences better is because it is increasingly difficult to dictate\nwhen and where audiences will watch (Kastelein, 2013). The\npossibilities opened up by a digital media environment for\nbusinesses and audiences alike directly trouble the industry's\nability to dictate clearly windows of distribution. This is a\nproblem for an industry that has historically been understood\nOn one hand, television companies fight against the prob-\nlems present in this type of environment through hard coding\ndigital rights management into web browser screens and uti-\nlize copyright laws to slow down illegal content uses (Moody,\n2013).1 On the other hand, some television companies also\nactively seek to understand networked digital environments\nin terms of the information about audiences that it can pro-\nvide. Television companies hope to leverage this knowledge\nof audience behaviors in various ways to tame problems of\nattention. A key way this happens is through how television\ncompanies use social media for audience information.\nThis article explores how data are utilized in the tentative\npartnerships created between television and social media\ncompanies. Specially, I look to the mutually beneficial rela-\ntionship formed between television companies and\nTwitter--a social media platform that allows users to send\neither single photos, 6 s or less video clips via their Vine app,\nor 140 character bursts of communication known as tweets.\nInvestigating the Twitter\u00adtelevision relationship is not about\nany single television program as Twitter's presence in the\nsocial media efforts of virtually all television shows is ubiq-\nuitous. Nor is this article about how television companies\nmight use Twitter to directly engage audience attention.\nRather, it is about how Twitter shares complex analyses of\nuser behavior with television companies. They call this work\nthe \"TV Genome,\" and Twitter does this by creating algo-\nrithms that connect tweets to television content with very\nfew context clues.All the user has to do is use Twitter and the\nwork happens in the background.\nIn this light, I want to call attention to how audience data\nare utilized as a way for the television industry to map itself\nonto the everyday lives of contemporary audiences. An\nemphasis on everyday life is important because it is at the\nlevel of the everyday, as understood by Henri Lefebvre,\nwhere the materialization of attention and monetization takes\nplace. In addition, everyday life, as Rita Felski (1999) argues,\nis understood as the space and time where we become \"accli-\nmatized to assumptions, behaviors and practices\" (p. 31).\nWhile our habitual practices may be processes that we do not\nthink about too much, I guarantee you that the television\nindustry charts them in great detail.\nThe television industry has historically been more or less\ninterested in consumer data gleaned from viewer rating sys-\ntems and focus groups. What is different about data collected\nfrom social media platforms is that it is \"wild,\" collected\nfrom everyday utterances and not within a structured research\nscenario (C. Ang, Bobrowicz, Schiano, & Nardi, 2013). This\n\"wild data\" allows television companies access to a broader\nspectrum of consumer information in an open-ended format\nthat allows for more careful tracking of changes in consumer\nsentiment over time.\nThus, I want to argue that the data-intensive monitoring of\neveryday life offers some measure of soft control over audi-\nences in a digital media landscape. Borrowing from the work\nphrase soft control to define the purposeful actions of the\ntelevision industry to shape audience attention toward prede-\ntermined goals. These interactions between television com-\npanies and audiences develop autonomously over time while\noften being interjected with prompts and run through differ-\nent iterations. The data collection that happens on Twitter\ncan be seen as a soft control practice that works in the back-\nground to funnel information about audiences to television\ncompanies. This happens because Twitter gives television\ncompanies in-depth access to unstructured utterances from\nthe everyday life of the Twitter user. The data that are pro-\nduced in this instance occur because people are simply using\nTwitter the way it is supposed to be used. Twitter's algorith-\nmic scripts have data to parse because, well, we do the work.\nThey are there to track, atomize, and tabulate us. By looking\nspecifically at the role Twitter plays in harnessing knowledge\nabout audience behaviors and practices, I will show how\nalgorithmic scripts are put into action for the television\nindustry and how the logic of soft control helps strengthen\nvarious television companies' position in a digital media\nenvironment.\nThis is not to suggest that television companies can deter-\nmine audiences in the strictest sense--that would clearly be\nfalse. Any investigation into \"Social TV\"--the relationships\ncreated between social media technologies and television--\nwill quickly uncover that audience attention is not something\nthat is easily taken for granted. In fact, this process of captur-\ning eyeballs is never fully complete and always in flux.2 But\nthis does not mean that television companies are not finding\nuses of social media to manage the terms of the industry\u00ad\naudience relationship. The amount of data we pump into this\nsocial feedback loop is astounding and points to the unequal\ndynamic between producers and audiences. Thus, even in a\nmedia environment that ostensibly gives more control to the\naudience, an uneven playing field exists.\nTelevision, Social Media, and Data\nBefore moving on to explaining Twitter and the TV Genome,\nI want to briefly situate this discussion against the burgeoning\nimportance of social media to the television industry in terms\nof direct engagement and, more importantly, data collection.\nAnd there is a lot of chatter these days about the relationship\nof social and traditional media. Twitter is the first thing star\nreporter/TV-hostAnderson Cooper reportedly checks when he\nwakes up (Anderson, 2011). Advertising Age sees the\nintegration of social media into traditional media as producing\na new type of hybrid media (Rubel, 2011). Gail Becker, global\nhead of Edelman's Digital Media, who counsels the National\nAssociation of Broadcasters, says that we have \"officially\nentered into an era of social entertainment\" when people are\nbeginning to expect to interact with the entertainment they\nconsume (Value, Engagement, 2011). Relatedly, in an Edelman\nin the United States\" consider social networking as a form of\nentertainment, the number jumping to 70% among 18- to\nSocial media are, perhaps obviously, built around the con-\ncept of sharing, which is materialized in the ubiquity of\n\"share\" buttons across the Internet. These buttons allow you\nto share content across a variety of platforms and socially\nenabled sites. This web application programming interface\n(API)-enabled form of communication is hybrid from top to\nbottom. While some platforms like Facebook started ostensi-\nbly as a way to allow friends to communicate, consumer- and\nmedia-oriented companies have flooded this space as a way\nto reach out to their customers wherever they are. This mix-\nture of consumer, personal, and interpersonal messages is\nprecisely what these companies are after--\"a superior align-\nment of commercial, consumer, and wider public interests\"\nIt is clear that there is a burgeoning connection between\ntelevision and social media. According to Lost Remote, a\nblog about Social TV, \"Facebook is [now] a huge distribution\nand promotional platform for TV shows\" (Bergman, 2012).\ntelevision shows 1.65 billion times, and television shows are\nalways well represented during the evenings on Twitter's top\nthe so-called \"water cooler effect\" through social media,\ntelevision companies believe they have to remap their prod-\nucts onto the times and spaces of contemporary consumers\nTelevision companies use social media platforms like\nFacebook and Twitter for what we could call direct audience\nengagement. These instances can be mundane, like when\nNina Dobrev, an actress formerly of the CW's The Vampire\nDiaries, tweets out to fans:\nFeeling soooooo much love from the Teens!!! Thank you for\nnominating me--you guys are amazing! <3 you!!!! @\nteenchoicenews\nThis tweet is retweeted by The Vampire Diaries' official\nTwitter account, creating more circulation. A \"perhaps-fan\"\n(we really do not know about much about \"her\"--if she is a\nbot, corporate account, etc.) like @dobrevselenas can\nrespond to the tweet with \"@ninadobrev you deserve it baby,\ni love you more <3.\"\nThere are also award-winning (or at least nominated) uses\nof social media. The Shorty Awards gives annual recognition\nto the best uses of social media by television companies.\nTNT's Legends was nominated in 2015 for best use of a\nTwitter hashtag with #DontKillSeanBean, capitalizing on the\npopularity of the pop culture meme that questions why Sean\nBean, the main actor in Legends, dies in everything. BBC\nAmerica's Orphan Black was also nominated in 2015 for its\nuse of social media--Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter--to create\ncontent for the #CloneClub, a group of passionate fans\nlabeled after the show's central theme of genetic cloning\nfor its work with 360i, a digital marketing agency, on Game\nof Thrones to create #ROASTJOFFREY, a 48-hr, crowd-\nsourced social media comedy roast of King Joffrey, a reviled\ncharacter on the show (\"Best Use of Social Media for\nAlthough these examples are worthy of investigation in\ntheir own right, for the purposes of this article, an important\nway to understand the burgeoning relationship between\nsocial media and the television industry is through the types\nof partnerships that occur in the process of building and shar-\ning data sets on potential audiences.\nTelevision's contemporary interest in mining social\nmedia platforms for user data parallels their interest in direct\naudience engagement through social media campaigns, and\nthe two are often intertwined. Television companies look to\npartner with data-rich companies like Google, Facebook,\nTwitter, Acxiom, and BlueKai that offer more data on cus-\ntomers than the television industry could collect alone.3\nThese are what Joseph Turow (2006) would call \"permis-\nsion-based\" databases that collect data to analyze consumer\nThere are many reasons--including improving program-\nming and digital ad targeting--behind this push into Big\nData. For instance, all the major networks--ABC, CBS, and\nNBC--have set up their own analytics companies that mix\nfirst- and third-party data as a way to handle the flood of data\nfrom social media and traditional data sources (Thielman,\nnered with Adobe Social to create a social listening cam-\npaign to shift how it marketed the hit show Being Mary Jane\n(Enright-Schulz, 2014). Similarly, HBO partnered with\nArktan SocialTrends and Facebook to mine user data as a\nway to shape promotion for the final season of True Blood\n(Aggarwal, 2014). In addition, Time Warner Cable utilizes\nuser data to \"target customers with the same advertising\ncampaign simultaneously in cable television, mobile devices,\nthe web, social media advertising, and other platforms\"\n(Ungerleider, 2013). In doing so, Time Warner creates data\nprofiles by combining viewing habits with information that\ndata management companies collect such as voter registra-\ntion records and real estate records. All these data create a\nvery specific profile of who a user is or could potentially be.\nThis personalization can then be fed back into the many\ninterconnected platforms and technologies, creating slight\ndifferences in approach for each individual.\n4 SAGE Open\nLet us turn now to Twitter for a more in-depth example of\nhow data are used to shape the industry\u00adaudience relation-\nship before explaining how we can view this as a form of soft\ncontrol.\nTwitter and the TV Genome\nOn June 4, 2013, @bobbychiu wrote \"My expression after\nwatching Game of Thrones this week . . . Omg\" which was\npaired with a picture of a rabbit emerging from a hole, ears\nperked, face wide with terror.\nThe most interesting thing about this tweet is that it has no\ndirect connection to the HBO show Game of Thrones. This\nuser is not trying to talk back to Game of Thrones; he or she\nis merely sharing his opinion with a range of his followers\nand using Twitter the way it is supposed to be used. Thus,\nthis individual is just tweeting about what is happening in his\nor her everyday life. It just happens that this expression is\nhosted on a platform that catalogs this sentiment and algo-\nrithmically aggregates it with the other tweets connected to\nGame of Thrones.\nAs one person, @bobbychiu's comments are fun but once\naggregated have the potential to paint a picture of broader\nconsumer sentiment. It makes sense that television compa-\nnies would want access to Twitter's data as evidence sug-\ngests that Twitter usage portrays a different picture of the\npopularity of shows than traditional Nielsen ratings do (Amol\n& Vranica, 2013). In addition, Twitter has been leveraging its\nrelationship with television in an attempt to monetize the\nplatform. As Sarah Perez of TechCrunch says, Twitter is\n\"betting big on being the TV companion app\" (Perez, 2013).\nTo better understand how these data are aggregated, let us\nlook at Bluefin Labs, one of many companies (Radian6,\nGeneral Sentiment, Sysomos, Converseon, and Trendrr) in\nthe growing field of Social TV analytics. According to\nBluefin Labs, their clients include 40 of the largest TV net-\nwas purchased by Twitter in February of 2013 to shore up a\nrelationship to television companies (MacMillan, 2013).\nBluefin calls its work in Social TV analytics the \"TV\nGenome.\" This \"genome\" is created by cross-referencing\ncomments made on Twitter with program guide information,\nthe names of characters and actors, closed-captioning text,\ndemographic information about who is commenting, along\nwith an advertising schedule that Bluefin created. The\n\"genome\" works in two tiers, one tied into those watching\nwithin a 3-hr window of the show and another focusing on\nthe 90 days after a show's premiere to catch time-shifted\nThis is a data-driven approach that uses tweets as data\npoints in conjunction with the unstructured data of television\nvideo feeds. To create something like a \"graph\" of television,\nBluefin records linear television streams and turns these\nfeeds into data. Data are not just something that exist.\nEverything in our world only has the potential to become\ndatum and only does so when it is translated into a \"unit or\nmorsel\" of information (Gitelman & Jackson, 2013, p. 1). To\nput it another way, this video is just a feed full of potential\ndata until it translated into mapped data. Bluefin has experi-\nence in trying to map video data; Michael Fleischman, the\nchief technology officer of Bluefin, actually worked to help\nmachines recognize home runs by watching Boston Red Sox\nWhen a video feed is translated into data, it would first be\nbroken down into still images, or frames, and then stored into\nsomething like an Apache HBase--a Big Data file system\nwhere you can store images. The images are stored as raster\nimages (as pixels with discrete number values for color) or\nvector images (color-annotated polygons). The images are\nthen broken down into particular features based on pixel\nplacement, luminance, color, patterns of pixel movement\n(including camera movement), and so on. Once the video\nimage is broken down into discrete units, it is available as\ndata. An algorithm can then be taught to recognize what is\nhappening on the screen based on how it cross-references\npixel or polygon movement and audio wavelengths as visual\ndata are connected with automatic speech recognition sys-\ntems to improve accuracy. Thus, for instance, Twitter's algo-\nrithms know when King Joffrey from Game of Thrones is\ndoing something sadistic or when Detective Linden from\nAMC's The Killing is having a bad day. This ability to break\nthe image down into readable data allows every channel that\nBluefin monitors to be precisely mapped.\nThe semantic analysis that Bluefin does for specific chan-\nnels\u00adincluding shows, advertisements, interstitials\u00adis made\nmeaningful for television companies when combined with an\nanalysis of tweets. This allows Bluefin to have a very spe-\ncific knowledge of when conversations about a television\nprogram are occurring. To more precisely catalog what the\nfolks on Twitter think of particular shows, Bluefin breaks the\nlanguage of tweets down into categories that are more\nsophisticated than good or bad--\"vulgar or polite, serious or\namused, calm or excited\" (Talbot, 2011). Thus, Bluefin utli-\nziies deep machine learning algorthims that are utlizied to\ngive order and meaning to comments pulled from social\nmedia.\nWhile Twitter also uses Bluefin to target advertisements\nat particular tweeters, the use of tweets to create a map of\nhuman behavior is another animal altogether (Lunden, 2013).\nThis map ingests data from a variety of places we can be in\nour everyday lives--at work, home, at a friend's house, or a\nbar. As long as we have a smartphone and a Twitter app (or\non another app running Twitter's API), we can do the things\nwe may normally do: respond to a tweet by a friend, com-\nment about the role of nudity in HBO programming, pro-\nclaim excitement over the trajectory of a particular character\narc, or any other example from the vast array of choices that\nconstitute our everyday lives. Translating the playing we do\non Twitter into data, Bluefin atomizes our tweets and reas-\nsembles them into larger identified data trends that look\nsomething like water cooler \"talk.\" In this way, the social\nmedia we may create--in this instance, a tweet--becomes\nthe data for television companies to better understand how\nwe feel about television.\nHow are the things that occur in the Twitter-TV partner-\nship any different from a longer history of companies trying\nto understand their audiences? According to James Beniger\n(1986), the technologies \"for collecting and processing all\nthese types of information\" appear in the late 1910s and\ntively unsophisticated process at the time, as Karen Buzzard\nPrior to the 1930s, knowledge of media audiences consisted\nprimarily of subjective impressions such as anecdotes, postcards\nmailed in by the audiences, and other schemes conceived by\nadvertisers. (p. 2)\nSince that time, audience research has grown into a robust\nindustry supporting a range of other media industries as they\ntried to control the \"reciprocal flow of information from the\nmass audience back to the media writers and programmers\"\nwith the goal of closing the gap between ideal behavior (what\nthey wanted) and real behavior (what actually happened;\nthe expansion of the research community also made the social\nscientist a common figure in marketing circles, and introduced\nsocial science terminology into marketing and advertising\njargon. The result was a pressure to generate more detailed and\ndeeper descriptions of consumer behavior. (Arvidsson, 2011,\nIn relation to television, by the end of the 1960s, Nielsen\nMedia Reach became a monopoly provider for audience\ninformation to the television industry. Nielsen's methods\nhave, over time, become more sophisticated, moving from\ndiary usage where a statistically meaningful range of indi-\nviduals self-reported behavior to, since 1984, the use of the\nPeople Meter to technologically track viewing habits\nThe point of this brief historical tour is to situate practices\nof trying to understand audiences with a longer tradition. As\nMark Andrejevic (2009) says, contemporary efforts \"to track\nthe behavior of viewers can trace their lineage back to the\nefforts of early audience rating researchers to find a two-way\nchannel for monitoring the audience\" (pp. 33-34). This\nmeans that the technological methods offered by social\nmedia platforms are \"amplified or supercharged\" versions of\naudience research and not completely different (Deuze,\nmedia companies is the sheer amount of potentially usable\ndata that these data-rich environments foster. Surveys and\ndiaries are a voluntary form of engagement, whereas social\nmedia data are often referred to as \"wild.\" This means it is\nnot based on surveys, diaries, or viewing logs collected from\na small sample of TV viewers but rather these data simply\nexist as a function of the way the Internet and social media\ntechnologies work. For instance, we simply have to log on to\nFacebook, click through some links, and chat with some\nfriends, or post our opinion about a TV show on Twitter. This\nis a key feature to how soft control works now; we simply\nhave to live and let the background scripts do their algorith-\nmic parsing.\nSoft Control and Everyday Life\nHow can Twitter's TV Genome be seen as a form of soft\ncontrol in the dynamics created in industry\u00adaudience rela-\ntionships? To explain this, I need to fully define soft control.\nBy all means, control is a scary word. For me, it conjures up\nold fears of subliminal advertising, that is, this message\nmade me do that specific thing, but I am unaware of the\ncause of my behavior.5 Although this looming, sinister form\nof control is a very popular usage of the term, it is but one of\nthe many ways control has been imagined academically.\nIn The Control Revolution, a sweeping rereading of\nEarth's history through the framework of informational con-\ntrol, James Beniger (1986) offers a good starting point to\nunderstand how the term can be used. Beniger explains con-\ntrol using a range of definitions from determination to influ-\nence. He refers to these as existing on a continuum between\nstronger and softer forms of control. The only thing that\nencapsulates these different definitions is the notion of a\n\"predetermined goal.\" Thus, to Beniger (1986), \"all control\nis thus programmed\" (p. 40).\nFocusing on the role technology and the economy play, he\nlooks at how public institutions dealt with social control in a\n19th- and 20th-century industrial world increasing in size\nand speed. Beniger (1986) points to the concepts of informa-\ntion and feedback as central to understanding control. This\nmeans that since the 1840s, long before the \"Information\nAge,\" social organizations needed to be able to utilize infor-\nmation as quickly and efficiently as they did material energy\nresources. Simply, if the world was moving faster, more\ninformation was needed to shape the direction of that world.\nLooking at the rise of the advertising industry as a\n\"nascent infrastructure for control of consumption,\" Beniger\n(1986) points to the long list of innovations in the industry--\nnewspaper distribution numbers, coupon reinforcement, the\nscientific methods of audience investigation by advertisers\nlike Claude Hopkins--as proof of this desire for control.\nThis information was used as a feedback technology to gain\na better understanding of the audience and how to reach it.\nBeniger clearly is indebted to the work of cybernetics and\ninformation theory as seen through his citations of luminar-\nies like Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, two founding\nfigures in the study of information. Wiener (1948) defines\ncybernetics as the science of control and communication\nacross a range of biological and man-made machines.6 The\nfocus of cybernetics, as W. Ross Ashby (1957) says in An\n6 SAGE Open\nIntroduction to Cybernetics, was to understand the behavior\nof machines as far as they were \"regular, or determinate, or\nreproducible\" (p. 1). This study of behavior wants to identify\nthe range of possibilities of action as a way to chart and pre-\ndict results in complex systems. In these complex systems,\nthe concept of difference--or the change from one state to\nthe next--was important, because it offered a way to plot,\npredict, and program change mathematically.\nHenri Lefebvre analyzes the relationship of feedback tech-\nnologies to control in the way cybernetic systems are utilized\nto shape human communication in a \"bureaucratic society of\ncontrolled consumption.\" The idea of bureaucratically con-\ntrolled consumption is most clearly articulated in Lefebvre's\nEveryday Life in the Modern World. He argues that society\nand its various \"sub-systems\" are functionally organized and\nrationalized, and produced and reproduced though program-\nming, obsolescence, and management via cybernetic systems.\nIt is our everyday lives where this control, in the form of pro-\ngramming, takes place (Lefebvre, 1984). An important take-\naway from this is thinking about how cybernetic systems\nhave the potential to produce as much control as they do free-\ndom. This view of societal control exists in the intense amount\nof data that cybernetic systems collect and that human statisti-\ncians and computer-based algorithms interpret, which has\nbecome a central force in how media industries understand\nand shape their relationship to audiences.\nTo Gilles Deleuze, the networked nature of audiences and\ncontemporary media does not work against a society of con-\ntrol, but rather is a chief feature of a control society. In his\nshort work, \"Postscript on the Societies of Control,\" Deleuze\ndiscusses the transition from a disciplinary society built on\nenclosure--as you move from the hospital, to the factory, to\nthe school--to a control society built on more open-ended\nforms of continuous control where technology interlinks all\nthese previously separate domains. In this formulation, the\nmodes of a control society are not unyielding but flexible--\nsomething Lev Manovich (2002) would call \"modular\"\n(p. 28). These systems of control are at the crux of a contra-\ndiction where freedom of spatial movement is paired with\nconstant monitoring, auditing, and adjustment. As Gilles\nDeleuze (1992) says, a society of control is one where the\n\"controls are a modulation\" (p. 3). In other words, this logic\nof control is flexible, reconfigurable, and fast. \"Control is\nabout the constant subtle structuring of social life, the ways\nthat we are sorted, tracked, cajoled, and tempted\" (Wise,\nWith all these data--credit scores, faces, passports, driv-\ner's licenses, search patterns, website visited--we have per-\nhaps transitioned from the individuals of the disciplinary\nsocieties to the \"dividuals\" of the control society (Deleuze,\n1992, p. 5). To Deleuze, \"dividuals\" are not us, per se; they\n\"can be seen as those data that are aggregated to form unified\nis a constant feedback loop between how we imagine our-\nselves and the categories created for us by all these data.\nJohn Cheney-Lippold (2011) sees the \"digital construction of\ncategories of identity\" as a new axis of soft control where\n\"control can be enacted through a series of guiding, deter-\nmining, and persuasive mechanisms\" (p. 169).\nApplying Tiziana Terranova's (2004) ideas about soft\ncontrol is also instructive here because how television com-\npanies use social media to collect and map audience data acts\nlike the open environment \"biological computing\" systems\nshe identifies in Network Culture.7 To Terranova, these envi-\nronments are characterized by potentially enormous produc-\ntivity; their difficulty to control; \"nonlinear interactions,\nfeedback loops, and mutations\"; and a central designer that\nwishes to produce an \"emergent behavior\" out of other actors\nFor Terranova (2004), \"biological computing models\"\nhave a moment of construction, then a positioning of con-\nstraints, and, finally, the \"moment of emergence of a useful\nor pleasing form\" (p. 118). Control is implemented in the\nbeginning (founding the model) and the end (the survival of\nthe most \"useful or pleasing variations\") (Terranova, 2004,\np. 118). If no \"pleasing variations are found, then the model\nis fine-tuned\" and sent through another modeling run\nImagine biological computing on a much larger scale and\nyou get close to conceptualizing what television companies\nare doing. Twitter's TV Genome allows looks like an open-\nended biological computing model. For instance, let us say\nTwitter analyzes the responses to an episode of The New\nGirl. The data sets are theoretically open as tweets only trig-\nger algorithms when certain parameters are met. The actors\nhere--the tweeters--are given relative autonomy. They are\nnot told their data are being used and whether Twitter\n\"ingests\" this tweet or not does not affect the tweet. This\ningested tweet is paired with a range of other tweets to create\ndata for the Fox Network to view via Bluefin's Signals\nApp--an application that aggregates and displays the infor-\nmation from the TV Genome specific to that client. And like\na biological model, it is open to change depending on when,\nwhere, and what people tweet. Thus, it is open ended; the TV\nGenome is always transforming. This mode of open-ended\ncontrol works because it does not \"require an absolute and\ntotal knowledge of all the states of each single component of\nand as Twitter tweaks its algorithms, the analysis of these\ntweets has the potential to gain in complexity.\nAccording to Madeline Akrich (1992), \"a large part of the\nwork of innovators is that of inscribing this vision of (or pre-\ndiction about) the world in the technical content of a new\nobject\" (p. 208, emphasis added). In this way, designers\nattempt to \"define a framework\" for how audiences will\nengage a particular object. Of course, no audience may come\nforth or they may do something radically different from the\nintended use, as was the case in how photoelectric light kits\nmade in France were actually used in ancillary markets in\nAfrica (Akrich, 1992). The failure of a particular object to be\n\"correct\" for an audience does not signify the end of the road\nper se. Rather, the experience translates into data to be fed\nback into the design process where designers redefine \"actors\nwith specific tastes, competences, motives, aspirations, polit-\nIn the process of inscribing an object with particular uses,\ndesigners \"script\" potential outcomes. If we focus on the\ndesign of an object like a short promotional video, then we\nget a certain orientation to what design can be. We may think\nabout lighting, actors, editing, rhetorical appeals present via\ndialogue, and so on. Talking about designer scripts that work\nin the background forces us to take a different approach.\nWhen I talk about background designer scripts in the Twitter\u00ad\ntelevision relationship, I am referring to how user data are\ningested, mapped, reduced, and made actionable through\nvarious audience retention strategies. Thus, in a sense, these\nscripts, that is, algorithms, lay dormant, waiting for users to\ndo the work. Background design scripts may best be seen as\nproto-design, running as a parallel process to the creation of\ndesign objects, services, and environments.\nThe data that algorithms behind the TV Genome collect\nare used to shape the direction of television companies as\nthey come to grips with an environment that works against\ndictating windows of distribution. The background algo-\nrithms are used to create the structured tracking, personaliza-\ntion, and responsiveness that are becoming an important part\nof how television relates to digital media environments.\nFurthermore, the collection of data allows television a richer\npicture of the rhythms, places, and practices of the everyday\nlives of audience members. That these data are dynamic\noffers the potential for an even more complex rendering of\nour everyday lives as companies \"measure\" and \"adjust\"\ntheir relationship to audiences. Thus, the moment data are\nmapped, reduced, and fed back into audience retention strat-\negies is when we can see a logic soft control.\nConclusion\nI have been looking at the role of data as a background script\nin designing soft control into the relationship of television to\nthe everyday lives of digitally enabled audiences. On one\nhand, it is frustrating that we cannot know more; no company\nis going to share its proprietary algorithms or tell you specifi-\ncally how data become actionable. On the other hand, there\nare still some important lessons to glean from an acknowl-\nedgment these background scripts are in place.\nFirst, the feedback loop between tweets, the TV Genome,\nand television industry practices is significantly sustained\nthrough the role algorithms play in shaping our everyday\nlife. While I have been looking at the role algorithms play in\nextending the scope of industrial data collection, according\nto Tarleton Gillespie (2012), \"algorithms play an increas-\ningly important role in selecting what information is consid-\nered most relevant to us, a crucial feature of our participation\nin public life\" (p. 1). Thus, we have algorithms that read\ntweets as data on one end, and algorithms that suggest search\nengine results on Google on the other end.\nThe important point to note here is how these algorithms\nwork in our everyday life not by hailing us--calling for any\nparticular mode of address--but my working in the back-\nground to collect \"wild\" data from our experiences of being\nalive and communicating. Eli Parsier (2012), in The Filter\nBubble, says we tell ourselves a reassuring story. In a broad-\ncast society, editors largely had control of the flow of infor-\nmation. They could tell us when, where, and how. The\nInternet ostensibly swept these structures away. But rather\nthan the baton of control being passed to us, it has been\npassed from industrial gatekeepers to algorithmic ones.\nSecond, I want to point out that the amount of data col-\nlected by a company like Twitter (and, remember, they are but\none player in this larger field of data collection) helps identify\nlogics of soft control by reinforcing an asymmetry of informa-\ntion between those who hold data and those who do not. The\n\"information flow\" goes from our social media work to their\nIn the amount of knowable things circulating today--the\ntexts of our everyday lives, or at least the information traces\nthese texts leave behind--we can start to see the way\nDeleuze's society of control might work. As entities like the\ntelevision industry create more sophisticated portraits of\nwhom we are, they arguably gain the upper hand in pattern-\ning their practices toward our digital habits. As a nod to\nPierre Bourdieu, these corporations know my habitus per-\nhaps better than I do.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: I, the sole author, agree to this submission and this article is\nnot currently being considered for publication by any other print or\nelectronic journal.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
