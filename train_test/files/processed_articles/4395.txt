    "abstract": "Abstract\nCoronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a\ndisease known to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. The role of inflammation and\nimmunity in atherosclerotic process offers possible explanations for the increased cardiovascular\nrisk in patients with RA. The immune response to citrullinated peptides has been extensively\nstudied in RA; antibodies directed to citrullinated peptides are now a cornerstone for RA\ndiagnosis. However, few studies have investigated the response to citrullinated peptides and the\ndevelopment of atherosclerotic plaque. Antibodies to carbamylated proteins can be detected\nbefore the clinical onset of RA, suggesting a potential predictive role for these antibodies; on the\nother hand, carbamylation of lipoproteins has been described in patients with cardiovascular\ndisease. This review examines the role of citrullination and carbamylation, two post-translational\nprotein modifications that appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of both RA and\natherosclerosis, expanding the similarities between these two diseases. Further investigation on\nthe role of the immune response to modified proteins may contribute to a better comprehension\nof cardiovascular disease in patients with RA.\n",

Two of these modifications, citrullina-\ntion and carbamylation, seem to be involved\nin the pathogenesis of both RA and athero-\nsclerosis, extending the links between the\ntwo diseases.\nCitrullination and RA\nCitrullination is an enzymatic post-transla-\ntional modification that is mediated by\npeptidylarginine deiminases (PAD), which\ntransform peptide-bound arginine residues\ninto citrulline, a non-natural amino acid.2\nOver the past decade, the immune response\nto citrullinated peptides has been extensively\nstudied in RA, and anticitrullinated protein\nantibodies (ACPA) are now a cornerstone\nfor the diagnosis of RA, with a specificity of\nantibodies have a predictive role (as they can\nbe detected before RA onset), and a prog-\nnostic role, being associated with a particu-\nlarly severe and erosive arthritis.3\nAnticitrullinated protein antibodies are\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of RA.\nCitrullinated peptides bind human leuko-\ncyte antigen DRB1, the so-called shared\nepitope, and a strong correlation between\nACPA positivity and shared epitope expres-\nsion was demonstrated.4 Moreover, smok-\ning may induce an immune response to\ncitrullinated peptides, with generation of\nACPA and the onset of RA in shared-\nepitope carriers.5 Published data support\na link between RA and chronic periodon-\ntitis; the oral pathogen Porphyromonas\ngingivalis has the unique ability to produce\na PAD enzyme that citrullinates proteins\nand may induce the development of RA in\ngenetically predisposed individuals.6\nInterestingly, both cigarette smoking and\nP. gingivalis are also risk factors for cardio-\nvascular disease (Figure 1). The effect of\ntherapy on ACPA status remains\ncontroversial.4\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the shared pathogenic pathway linking rheumatoid arthritis and\natherosclerosis.\n82 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)\nCitrullination and atherosclerosis\nFew studies have investigated the response to\ncitrullinated peptides and the development\nof atherosclerotic plaque. Sokolove et al.7\ndemonstrated that both citrullinated fibrino-\ngen and vimentin were correlated with the\ncoronary artery calcium score in 134 female\npatients with RA. Moreover, citrullinated\nproteins and PAD-4 enzyme were detected\nwithin atherosclerotic plaques obtained\nfrom non-RA patients, and ACPA isolated\nfrom patients with RA were able to target\nthese proteins.7 Citrullinated proteins and\nPAD enzymes have also been detected in the\nperivascular myocardial interstitium, espe-\ncially in RA patients.8 Cambridge et al.9\ninvestigated the possible association between\nACPA and CHD in 432 healthy subjects who\nwere followed up for 5 years. In this study,9 a\nsignificantly higher percentage of partici-\npants who developed CHD were ACPA-\npositive compared with those who did not\ndevelop CHD; the association remained\nsignificant even after adjustment for trad-\nitional atherosclerotic risk factors.9\nCarbamylation and RA\nCarbamylation is a chemical post-\ntranslational modification consisting of the\naddition of a cyanate group on self peptides,\nleading to the production of homocitrulline.\nAmong other factors, tobacco smoke seems\nto induce protein carbamylation.10 The\nimmunogenicity of homocitrulline has been\nstudied in RA patients. Shi et al.11 detected\nantibodies to carbamylated proteins in both\nACPA-positive and -negative patients; in\nthe latter group, carbamylated protein anti-\nbody positivity was strongly associated with\nmore erosive forms of RA compared with\nantibody negativity.11 Moreover, cross-reac-\ntivity between antibodies to citrullinated\nand homocitrullinated proteins seems to be\nlow.11 Similar to ACPA and rheumatoid\nfactor, antibodies to carbamylated proteins\ncan be detected before the clinical onset of\nRA, suggesting a potential predictive role\nfor these antibodies.12 The exact pathogenic\nrole of carbamylated proteins and the effect\nof RA treatment on antibodies to these\nproteins remain unaddressed.\nCarbamylation and\natherosclerosis\nCarbamylation of various lipoproteins has\nbeen described in patients with cardiovascu-\nlar disease. Carbamylated high-density lipo-\nprotein may promote atherogenesis by\nimpairing the balance between macro-\nphage-mediated cholesterol uptake and\nefflux.13 Carbamylation of low-density lipo-\nprotein (LDL) might induce endothelial\ndysfunction, acting via the lectin-type oxi-\ndized LDL receptor 1,14 a scavenger recep-\ntor for oxidized LDL that has been\nproposed as a biomarker of RA.15\nCarbamylated LDL may uncouple endothe-\nlial nitric oxide synthase, reducing nitric\noxide bioavailability and impairing endo-\nthelium vasodilatation.14 Moreover, carba-\nmylated LDL seems to promote monocyte\nadhesion to endothelial cells, damage endo-\nthelial cells and progenitor endothelial cells,\nand induce vascular smooth muscle-cell\nproliferation.16 Carbamylation of other pro-\nteins that are not yet clearly elucidated, may\nalso contribute to the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis.\nConclusions\nCitrullination and carbamylation are two\npost-translational modifications that seem\nto link RA and atherosclerosis, expanding\nthe similarities between these two inflamma-\ntory, immune-mediated chronic diseases.\nFurther investigation into the role of\nthe immune response against citrulline\nand homocitrulline may contribute to a\nbetter cardiovascular outcome in patients\nwith RA.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nEditorial assistance was provided by Gayle\nRobins on behalf of HPS\u00adHealth Publishing\nand Services Srl and funded by Pfizer Italia.\nReferences\n1.
