The present study examined the association of providing assistance to older parents amid everyday\ncircumstances and short-term psychological consequences for adult children providing assistance.\nMethods. We explored this association using 824 daily diary interviews of 119 adult children providing assistance in\nthe National Study of Daily Experiences by using a left-censored random effects tobit regression model that accounted for\nthe clustered data and floor effects in reported psychological distress.\nResults. Psychological distress was higher on days adult children provided assistance to their parent (b\u00bc0.88, p , .05)\neven after we controlled for situational variables such as time spent on daily paid work, time spent on leisure activities, and\nassistance provided to individuals other than parents. Demographic and psychosocial variables such as having resident\npsychological distress.\nDiscussion. Even after we controlled for within-person (daily situational variables) and between-person factors\n(background characteristics), the act of providing assistance itself had immediate associations with daily mood for helpers,\nparticularly for those with fewer resources and greater demands on time. Feasibility and success of programs that provide\nrespite and relief services to older adults and their children should be assessed in light of daily living.\nKey Words: Routine assistance--Daily diary--Stress proliferation--Caregiving.\nVARIATION in assistance between adult children and their\nolder parents has emerged as an important topic in social\ngerontology (e.g., Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2005; Pillemer &\nSuitor, 2006). Whereas studies of continuous care to chroni-\ncally ill family members can contribute to researchers' general\nunderstanding of care-related stress and its psychological\nconsequences on the younger generations providing assistance,\nmost of these studies are specific to certain types of care\nexperiences (e.g., for Alzheimer's patients, stroke patients) and\nfocus on intense caregiving. This focus has provided an\nimportant, but limited, perspective on the range of possible\noutcomes (Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 1999).\nThere is growing recognition that family members are involved\nin a range of activities: from infrequent to daily provision and\nfrom casual routine assistance to very intensive care for family\nmembers that could still affect the daily lives of people\nproviding assistance (e.g., Szinovacz & Davey, 2007).\nFurthermore, a preponderance of the literature has relied on\nretrospective accounts of assistance that are often collected over\na relatively long period of time, covering weeks, months, and\nyears. As a result, these accounts are likely to be confounded by\nother events that happened during the time period. This study\nexamined the more immediate impact of routine assistance\nagainst the context of daily living and its cumulative effects\nover time for adult children providing assistance.\nUnderstanding of daily stressors and their immediate and\ncumulative influence over time has benefited from develop-\nments in daily diary designs in which repeated measures are\ncollected from individuals during their daily lives (Almeida,\nindividuals reported regarding a number of everyday events,\nbehaviors, symptoms, and emotional states to capture the\nongoing experiences in the natural context of daily living\n(Larson & Almeida, 1999). Unlike traditional designs that\nrequire respondents to recall experiences over long time frames,\nthis design alleviates memory distortions, especially those\nrelated to current emotional state, and improves accuracy of\nrecall. But the most valuable feature of diary methods is that\nthey allow assessment of within-person processes and permit\nresearchers to shift their focus from considering mean levels of\nstressors and well-being in a group of individuals to charting\nthe day-to-day fluctuations in stress and well-being within an\nindividual himself or herself (Reis & Gable, 2000). Because\nindividuals serve as their own controls, investigators can now\nexamine how daily provision of assistance to a parent is\nassociated with changes in individuals' own well-being from\none day to the next. For example, research has suggested that\ncompeting roles may increase psychological distress among\ncaregivers (e.g., Murphy et al., 1997). Most of these studies\nhave used a between-person design, comparing one caregiver to\nanother. These studies could be confounded by within-person\ndifferences, such as amount of time spent on competing roles or\nexperience of poor health or physical ailment on a day when\nassistance is provided. In contrast, in the present study, we were\nable to test whether psychological distress is higher on days\nwhen adult children provide assistance than on days they do\nnot. Similarly, between-person designs have found that higher\neducation may buffer helpers from psychological distress. Our\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\nwithin-person design, however, allowed us to determine the\nbuffering effect of education on a day when assistance is\nprovided versus one when it is not, as well as to compare helpers\non other potentially important background characteristics.\nStress Proliferation on Everyday Living\nProviding routine assistance to an older parent has salient\npsychological consequences such as increased distress and\nburden for the adult child providing help (e.g., Aneshensel,\nPearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995; Antonucci, Akiyama,\nMany researchers believe that this distress and burden is partly\ndue to the impingement of the helping role on other everyday\nroles and experiences, which makes up the structural un-\nderpinning of stress spillover or proliferation (Pearlin, 1989;\nPearlin, Aneshensel, & LeBlanc, 1997). According to the stress\nprocess model (Aneshensel et al., 1995), individuals bear\nmultiple social roles; for instance, they may simultaneously be\nbreadwinners, parents, employees or employers, members of\nvoluntary organization, and so forth. Each of these roles imposes\ntime commitments, responsibilities, and obligations. Many of\nthese roles have been a part of the daily plan of an individual for\na long time and have been accommodated into the flow of daily\nliving. The helping role emerges after these primary roles have\nalready been acclimatized (Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff,\n1990). Initially, the demands of providing routine assistance to\na parent may be minimal and sporadic; however, they can\ncontinue to grow over time, making reordering of priorities and\nreallocating energies increasingly difficult. It is this feature of the\nhelping role that contributes to stress proliferation, wherein the\nnew role imposes demands on one's time and energy and\nrequires restructuring and juggling of the primary roles in daily\nlife, making it particularly challenging and eventually under-\nmining the health and well-being of the individual providing\nroutine assistance to parents (Pearlin, 1989).\nExtant research supporting this theory has found that whether\nproviding help is situation specific and occasional or repetitive\nand chronic, it is still powerful enough to disrupt an array of\nroles, activities, and relationships that are only proximally related\nto the helping role. Using longitudinal data, McKinlay,\nCrawford, and Tennstedt (1995) found that providing assistance\nexerted the greatest toll on an individual's personal life, followed\nby family life and employment. They found that providing\nassistance was particularly stressful for those who had multiple\nresponsibilities and for those who spent less time on themselves.\nMurphy and her colleagues (1997) found that role overload was\nhighest for women helpers with multiple roles of parent or\nworker. At the same time, resentment in the helping role was\nhighest for those women who had fewer roles apart from\nproviding help, those who had to quit work to fulfill their role,\nand those without a partner. More recently, Stephens, Townsend,\nMartire, and Drule (2001) examined role conflict experienced by\n278 helping women who simultaneously played the role of\nmother, wife, and employee. Their results suggested that part of\nthe stress that these women experienced was due to conflicts\nbetween the helping role and the other roles they were playing.\nSituational and Background Characteristics\nAlthough we expect to find evidence of stress proliferation in\nthe everyday lives of all helpers, we believe that the nature and\nextent of exposure and reactivity to stress will vary with the\nbackground and situational characteristics of the person in-\nvolved. For instance, the social and economic characteristics of\nhelpers as well as the possession of resources from which they\ncan draw are important covariates to consider. We consider\nseveral important ones in this article.\nAdult children's age is an important predictor of the provi-\nsion of routine assistance. Older adult children give more sup-\nport than younger adult children (Ikkink, van Tilburg, &\nhave fewer conflicting demands. Although the effect of adult\nchildren's gender on routine exchanges is not as well under-\nstood (Pinquart & So\n\u00a8rensen, 2006), it is quite clear that women,\nin particular daughters, spend more time providing assistance to\ntheir older parents than do adult sons (Campbell & Martin-\nHousehold structure also plays an important role in the\ndetermination of exchanges between the generations and vulner-\nability to stressors. An adult child's marital status is an impor-\ntant aspect of intergenerational exchanges, wherein unmarried\ndaughters are more likely to engage in an exchange of house-\nhold assistance than married siblings for whom the opportunity\ncost of providing assistance is higher (Couch, Daly, & Wolf,\n1999). Moreover, the presence of minor children in married-\ncouple households leads to increased time spent in domestic\nwork, reduced time in the labor market, decreased monetary\ntransfers to parents, and increased role overload (Ikkink et al.,\n1999). Economic theories also suggest that the educational or\nfinancial status of adult children facilitates the provision of\nassistance to older parents. For instance, empirical studies\nwith little education or earning lower wages provide hands-on\nassistance to older parents, whereas their higher earning coun-\nterparts provide financial resources or use paid services. We\ntherefore expect that adult children with lower education may\nbe more distressed on days when assistance is provided.\nFinally, several researchers have asserted that personal dis-\npositions interact with stressful situations in determining indi-\nviduals' own appraisals of a stressor (Ben-Porath & Tellegen,\nsonality traits have shown that neuroticism predicts increased\nexposure and lowered adjustment to interpersonal daily stress-\nPerceived mastery and control, in contrast, are known to buffer\nthe emotional effects of chronic daily stressors (Lachman &\nChang, 1999). We therefore expect that adult children with\nhigher mastery and lower scores on the neuroticism trait will\nexperience less significant psychological distress on days when\nassistance is provided to parents. Whereas some of the factors\nlisted above increase one's vulnerability to stressors, others\nmay serve as protective factors.\nStudy Purpose, Hypotheses, and Research Questions\nDaily diary designs provide a unique opportunity to simul-\ntaneously study within-person and between-person differences\nby examining psychological distress in helpers on days when\nassistance is provided versus days when it is not (within-\nperson), as well as by comparing helpers as a function of their\nbackground and contextual factors (between-person). Given\nthat the proliferation of stressors on primary role-related\nactivities is a key determinant of stress and well-being among\nindividuals providing assistance, in the present study we\nhypothesized that psychological distress would be higher on\ndays helpers encountered more daily situational factors (spent\nmore time on activities, encountered stressors, provided help\nto other family members) in addition to providing assistance\nto a parent. We also hypothesized that women; younger\nindividuals; African Americans; unmarried individuals; persons\nwith young children; as well as individuals with lower educa-\ntion, higher neuroticism, and lower mastery would be more\nsusceptible to psychological distress.\nUsing a representative sample of the population, we identi-\nfied adult children that engage in a full range of assistance in\norder to address two main questions. First, how are the daily\nrole-related experiences affected by the type of day (i.e.,\nhelping vs non-helping day)? Second, after we control for daily\nrole-related experiences and responsibilities and person-level\nvariables, is psychological distress higher on days when assis-\ntance is provided than on days when it is not?\nMETHODS\nData and Sample\nWe used data from participants in the National Study of\nDaily Experiences (NSDE). The NSDE is a randomly selected\nsubsample of the National Survey of Midlife Development in\nthe United States (MIDUS) carried out under the John D. and\nCatherine T. MacArthur Foundation Network for Successful\nMidlife Development (for detailed descriptions of the MIDUS\nparticipated in the NSDE daily diary study, yielding a response\nrate of 83%. Over the course of eight consecutive evenings,\nparticipants completed short telephone interviews about their\ndaily experiences. The initiation of interviews was staggered\nacross days of the week to control for the possible confounding\nbetween day of study and day of week. Participants completed\nan average of seven of the eight interviews, resulting in a total\nof 7,221 daily interviews. Participants received $20 for their\nparticipation (for more details on the study, see Almeida,\npants, we identified 119 individuals who reported providing\neither instrumental or emotional assistance to their parent on at\nleast 1 of the 8 days of the diary interview. The 119 individuals\ncompleted an average of 6.9 days of interviews out of the\n8 days, resulting in 824 daily interviews.\nMeasures\nOutcome variable. --Daily psychological distress was oper-\nationalized using an inventory of 10 emotions from the Non-\nSpecific Psychological Distress Scale (Kessler et al., 2002;\nMroczek & Kolarz, 1998), which was conducted on each of the\n8 days of telephone interviews. Participants rated these mood-\nrelated questions on a 5-point scale (0 \u00bc none of the time; 4 \u00bc\nall of the time). The inventory included emotions such as\nsadness, hopelessness, anxiety, and restlessness. The scale was\ndeveloped using item response models and factor analysis,\nyielding a single-factor structure representing current psycho-\nlogical distress (for complete information on psychometric\nproperties of the scale and validation, refer to Kessler et al.,\nfrom .70 to .89 across the 8 days of administration.\nPsychological distress in this sample had a positively skewed\nthe scores clustered toward the lower end of the scale. Other\nstudies of more serious caregivers have seen this low rating of\npsychological distress as well (Schulz et al., 1997). To adjust\nfor the skewness, we attempted to transform this variable to\na more symmetric distribution by adding a constant of unity to\nthe score before taking the natural logarithm of psychological\ndistress (Mlogged psychological distress\nthe logged psychological distress score for descriptive and\nunivariate analyses and relied on random effects tobit re-\ngression with left-side censoring for the multivariate model.\nPredictor variables. --Using a broad definition of helping,\nwe assessed providing routine assistance to a parent as help\nprovided with emotional or instrumental tasks on each of the\n8 days of the study. Two questions were asked regarding assis-\ntance to people living outside the house, in particular a parent.\nThe first question was ``Did you provide any unpaid assistance\nor instrumental assistance to someone outside the house?'' (e.g.,\nhelp with shopping, etc.). If participants agreed, then they were\nasked to name each of those to whom they provided assistance\non that day. The list included parents. Likewise, the second\nquestion was about providing emotional support (e.g., giving\nadvice, comforting them). Providing either emotional or instru-\nmental support or both on a given day to a parent was coded as\n1 if yes and 0 if no. Providing emotional or instrumental support\nto someone else other than a parent was also used as a control\nvariable and was coded similar to the previous variable, namely\n1 if provided support and 0 if provided no support on a given\nday. In this way, we could distinguish assistance provided to\nparents from assistance provided to others.\nThree time-use variables measured competing everyday\nsituational demands. These variables were related to time spent\neach day on tasks and activities other than providing assistance\nto a parent. The first variable, routine chores, assessed the\namount of time the participant spent on routine chores in the\nhouse, such as yard work. The second variable reflected\nthe amount of time spent on activities related to business, paid\nwork, or school, which included time traveling and thinking\nabout the work. The third variable considered the use of time\non activities related to leisure, such as relaxing, taking a nap, or\nengaging in physical exercise or leisure activities. Time spent\non these activities was coded in hours and minutes.\nBackground variables. --From the MIDUS survey, which was\ncollected approximately a year before the NSDE diary inter-\nviews, variables that acted as reasonably stable background\ncharacteristics were included as between-person covariates in\nthese analyses. This study included demographic variables such\nas gender (0\u00bcmale, 1\u00bcfemale), African American race (0\u00bcno,\n1\u00bcyes), and education (1\u00bcless thanhigh school, 2\u00bchigh school,\n3\u00bccollege, 4\u00bccollege and higher). Apart from these individual\ncharacteristics, we utilized family-related variables such as\nmarital status (1 \u00bc married, 0 \u00bc not married) and whether the\nparticipant had any children younger than 18 years (0 implying\nno children). We coded age reported during the NSDE diary\ncluded trait neuroticism and personal mastery as two personal\ncharacteristics variables. The neuroticism items included the\nfollowing four adjectives: moody, worrying, nervous, and calm\n(Lachman & Weaver, 1997). Participants indicated how well\neach of the four items described them on a 4-point scale from 1\n(a lot) to 4 (not at all). All but the last item were reverse-coded,\nand the mean across the items was taken such that a higher\nvalue indicated higher levels of neuroticism. Scores ranged\nfrom 1 to 4. Cronbach's alpha for this sample was .76.\nThe personal mastery scale consisted of two items from\nPearlin and Schooler (1978) and two items from Lachman and\ninformation on this scale. Respondents rated on a 7-point scale\n(1 \u00bc strongly agree; 7 \u00bc strongly disagree) how strongly they\nagreed with the following questions: (a) I can do just about\nanything I really set my mind to; (b) When I really want to do\nsomething, I usually find a way to succeed at it; (c) Whether or\nnot I am able to get what I want is in my own hands; and (d)\nWhat happens to me in the future depends mostly on me.\nWe recoded responses so that higher scores indicated greater\npersonal mastery. The scale was constructed by calculating the\nmean across each set of items. Scores ranged from 1 to 7.\nCronbach's alpha for this sample was .63. Table 1 provides\ndescriptive statistics for the total sample.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the participants\nin the study. The average age of participants was 45 years\nmarried, 38% had resident children younger than 18, and the\nmajority of the sample was Caucasian (94%), with high school\neducation or higher (M \u00bc 2.90, SD \u00bc 0.93). These participants\nwere on average moderately high on neuroticism (M \u00bc 2.24,\nOn average, participants provided assistance on 28% of the\nstudy days (approximately 2 out of 8 days). A total of 66\nparticipants (55%) provided routine assistance to their parents\non only 1 of the days, compared to 53 (45%) who provided as-\nsistance on more than 1 day of the study (not shown in Table 1).\nOn average, each day participants spent approximately 2 hr on\nThese participants also provided assistance to other family\nmembers, friends, and work colleagues on 4% of the study\nassistance to other family members on parent care days. A total\nof 39 participants (32.77%) provided instrumental support to\na parent, 60 participants (50.42%) provided emotional support,\nemotional support to a parent.\nUnivariate Analysis Examining Psychological\nDistress and Role-Related Experiences\nIn order to examine if engaging in the helping role has an\nimmediate association with psychological distress and other\nrole-related experiences, we next considered time-use data and\nrole-related experiences to test using paired t tests whether days\nwhen assistance was provided to parents were different from\ndays when it was not, as shown in Table 2. Participants reported\nsignificantly higher psychological distress (t \u00bc\u00c02.01, p , .05)\non days when assistance was provided (Mlog\ndays when it was not (Mlog\n\u00bc 0.66). With regard to everyday\nliving activities, on average participants spent the same amount\nof time on routine chores and leisure activities, however they\nspent significantly less time (t \u00bc 2.54, p , .01) on work-related\nactivities on days when assistance was provided (M \u00bc 3.67)\nthan on days when it was not (M \u00bc 4.61). Participants also\nreported a significantly greater number of stressors on days\nwhen assistance was provided (t\u00bc\u00c03.00, p , .01). On average,\nthey experienced stressors on 57% of days when assistance was\nprovided, compared with 43% of the days when it was not (t \u00bc\n\u00c02.90, p , .01). Out of all stressors, network stressors (i.e.,\nevents that occurred in the lives of close family members and\nfriends) occurred more on days when assistance was provided\n(experienced on 17% of helping days) than on days when it was\nnot (experienced on 7% of non-helping days).\nMultivariate Analysis Examining Psychological\nDistress and Role-Related Experiences\nTo take into account the clustering of participants on 8 days\nof the study and in order to adjust for floor effects in reported\nnegative affect, in the next set of analysis we used a left-\ncensored random effects tobit regression model to predict daily\npsychological distress. One of the main reasons for using daily\ndiary designs is that we expected there would be as much\nwithin-person variation (i.e., helping days are different from\nnon-helping days) as between-person variation (i.e., partic-\nipants differ from one another) in psychological distress among\nparticipants. To examine this, we began our analysis with the\nTable 1.

As we expected, we\nfound as much intraindividual variability as interindividual\nvariability. The intraclass correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.49\nsuggested that approximately half of the total variation in daily\npsychological distress was within-person and the other half of\nthe variation was between-person. Model 1 in Table 3 indicated\nthat on average psychological distress was higher on days when\nassistance was provided than days when it was not (p , .05).\nWe next estimated a series of models, beginning with a model\nwith everyday situational factors (within-person predictors)\nfollowed by background characteristics (between-person pre-\ndictors) predicting daily psychological distress.\nModel 2 in Table 3 presents the results including the\neveryday situational factors measured on 8 days of the study.\nResults indicated that on days that participants devoted more\ntime to paid work (b \u00bc 0.12, p , .05) and leisure activities and\nTable 2.

Spending time on routine household chores was not\nrelated to psychological distress. Additionally, psychological\ndistress was higher on days when the participant provided\nassistance to another family member other than the parent (b \u00bc\n2.70, p , .01). Even after we controlled for the amount of time\nspent on paid work, on leisure activities and sleep, and\nengaging in other helping tasks, providing assistance to a parent\nwas associated with the experience of greater psychological\nModel 3 in Table 3 presents the results including situational\n(within-person) as well as background factors (between-person),\nsuch as age of adult child, gender, marital status, race, parental\nstatus, education, and personality factors such as neuroticism\nand mastery. Examination of the between-person variables\nshowed that having less education (b \u00bc\u00c00.54, p , .01), being\nsingle (b \u00bc \u00c00.96, p \u00bc .07), and having young children (b \u00bc\n2.14, p , .01) increased the chances of experiencing psycho-\nlogical distress across all days. Conversely, having lower neu-\np , .06) acted as protective factors against psychological\ndistress. Age and gender of the adult child as well as race did\nnot predict daily psychological distress among participants.\nFinally, even after we controlled for the situational factors as\nwell as the background characteristics, providing assistance to\na parent continued to be associated with greater psychological\ndistress on the day help was given compared to days when it\nwas not (b \u00bc 0.88, p , .05). We explored several interactions\nbetween everyday situational factors and background character-\nistics of the adult children; however, perhaps due to the limited\nsample size, we did not find any in the present study.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious research has examined assistance between gener-\nations primarily using retrospective accounts of assistance\nprovided over long time spans. These methods do not capture\nthe everyday hassles and disturbances that are associated with\nthe act of providing daily assistance to a parent. In the present\nstudy, we took a microlevel approach to examining the associa-\ntion of providing routine assistance amid everyday circum-\nstances and the psychological consequences for the adult child\nover shorter time spans.\nIn order to address our first research question, we began by\nexamining how daily role-related experiences were affected on\ndays when assistance was provided compared with when it was\nnot. Past studies that have examined the relationship between\nwork roles and helping roles have found that helpers often have\nto give up or cut down on personal roles (employee or parental\nrole) to provide assistance (Murphy et al., 1997; Stephens et al.,\n2001). Consistent with this idea, we found that our sample of\nhelpers was reasonably involved in routine daily chores and\nwork-related activities, but on days when assistance was pro-\nvided they spent less time on work-related activities. Notably,\nwe also found that helpers reported more stressors on days\nwhen assistance was provided than on days when it was not.\nMany of the stressors revolved around participants' social net-\nworks. This is an interesting finding, because network stressors\nare events that occur in the lives of others. Perhaps helpers'\nexpression of care and compassion further exposes them to the\nstressors of friends and family.\nTo address our second research question, we used a multi-\nvariate analysis approach to examine psychological distress on\ndays when assistance was provided versus days when it was\nnot, taking into account daily role-related experiences and\nresponsibilities and background characteristics. Our results\nclearly show that even at the microlevel, the enactment of the\nrole of providing routine assistance to a parent is in itself\nstressful. Consistent with our first hypothesis and in line with\nprevious research that suggests that conflicting demands of\nhelping and fulfilling other personal roles (e.g., employee,\nparent) are important factors that account for negative effects on\nthe well-being of the helper, we found that any increase in the\namount of time spent on work on a given day increased psy-\nchological distress on days when assistance was provided. A\nsurprising finding was that time spent on leisure and sleep was\nalso related to higher psychological distress on days when\nassistance was provided. Because leisure and sleep are also\nplanned activities that may cause role conflict and overload on\ndays when assistance is provided, it is not surprising to find that\ndistress was higher on those days. Further research is required\nto examine the implications of these findings. Some researchers\nhave suggested that if these factors are held constant, providing\nassistance might lead to positive appraisals of the helping role\n(Marks, 1998). Our findings do not support this. Even after we\ncontrolled for the amount of time spent on activities such as\nhousehold chores, work, as well as providing help to others,\nproviding assistance to a parent was still significantly related to\nhigher daily psychological distress.\nConsistent with our second hypothesis, we found clear\nevidence that being single, being non-White, and having lower\neducation was associated with higher daily psychological\ndistress (Couch et al., 1999; Pinquart & So\nMoreover, we also found evidence that personal characteristics\nsuch as low neuroticism and high mastery buffered the effects\nof care enactment on psychological distress. However, we did\nnot find any effects for age, gender, and race in our study. This\ncould be because of the relative homogeneity of this sample, as\nthe study was not specifically designed to study assistance\nprovided by adult children. The age range within a sample of\nadult children would also be more restricted than in a sample\nthat also included assistance provided by spouses. It is also\npossible that differences between sons and daughters are less\npronounced than those found between husbands and wives\ntinuum of assistance (Davey & Szinovacz, 2007). Likewise, the\nsmall proportion of non-Whites in the sample made it difficult\nto find any race effects and also restricts the generalizability of\nthe results.\nThe present study is among the first systematic studies that\nhave examined the daily impact of providing routine assistance\nto a parent living outside the house; however, there are several\nlimitations that we need to acknowledge. First of all, the present\ndata were not collected with the intention of understanding\nroutine assistance to parents. We therefore had to rely on global\nmeasures of assistance instead of specific dimensions of care,\nsuch as number of hours of assistance to a parent. Because\nmeasures of intensity of providing care were not available, we\nare not able to clarify whether it is the act of providing care\nor the intensity of providing care that is more important\nfor predicting psychological distress. Future research should\nexamine the daily intensity of help provision and its con-\nsequences on indicators of distress. Additionally, variables that\nare important predictors of intergenerational exchanges, such as\nparent's health status and proximity to the parent, were not\nknown and so could not be included. Providing assistance to\na parent who lives in closer proximity might be physically\ndraining and exhausting; however, being far away from a parent\nmight not give adult children immunity from feeling over-\nwhelmed on days the parent requires care. The lack of informa-\ntion about parent's health status and proximity to parents did\nnot allow us to assess variability in everyday distress due to\nthese factors. Finally, we tested several interactions between\nproviding daily assistance, daily exposure to stressors, and re-\nsilience variables, but due to the low power of the study, these\ncould not be estimated and remain to be explored in future\ndiary studies.\nDespite these limitations, the current study clearly suggests\nthe possible link between assisting a parent and the downward\ntrajectory of health and well-being in caregiving. The accumu-\nlation of small and large daily stressors may build up and spill\nover into other areas of life, eventually undermining psycho-\nlogical resources and well-being. Our results also imply that\nindividuals who experience greater role conflict and demand\non their time as well as those with the fewest resources ex-\nperience the most distress on days when assistance is provided\nto parents. These results also suggest new strategies for sup-\nporting people assisting parents and other older relatives.\nRather than designing respite and support programs in a non-\nspecific way, experts could design programs that specifically\ntarget the everyday care events that are stressful. By building on\nan understanding of the daily events that people find stressful,\nthis approach could make daily life easier for older adults and\nthe individuals who support them and prevent the depletion of\ncare resources. By focusing on stressors in this way, support\nprograms may be more effective in relieving caregiver burden\nwhile also giving financial and other support for those with the\nfewest resources.\n"
