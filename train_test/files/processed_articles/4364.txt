Survey data (N = 612)\ncollected from Finland in 2011 are analysed. The article shows that mobile-only Internet\nuse is not associated with particularly diverse or frequent daily travelling practices,\nwhereas combined mobile/fixed use is. Mobile-only Internet users are, in fact, in a\nrelatively disadvantaged position \u00ad compared with other users, they are more typically\nunemployed and their household income is lower. The mobility of Internet access as\nsuch does not guarantee a safe social position in society. Mobile Internet use must be\ncomplemented with fixed use, which brings about more versatile and frequent travelling.\nThe finding suggests that the `mobile-rich get richer' when it comes to Internet use and\ndaily travelling practices.\n",

In particular, the smartphone has transformed the use of\nInternet by making the Internet available to people on the move. Despite this great\naffordance of mobility, studies from Finland and other European countries indicate that\na majority of smartphone users utilize only a small number of the functions on their\nsmartphones (Fortunati and Taipale, 2014; Sell et al., 2012). The Internet-enabled smart-\nphone is clearly an under-utilized multi-functional device. Second, separate mobile solu-\ntions, such as USB data sticks, SIM card slots in laptops and tablet personal computers\n(PCs) have added substantially to the portability of the Internet. This category of solu-\ntions also includes Wi-Fi hotspots, which allow access to the Internet when 3G or 4G\nnetworks are not available or roaming costs are high.\nThe main research problem of this study pertains to these latter ways of connecting to\nthe Internet. The study investigates how mobile-only Internet use, when compared with\nfixed-only and combined mobile/fixed Internet use, is related to daily travelling prac-\ntices. Furthermore, the study clarifies the type of social differentiations that are related to\nthese three ways of accessing the Internet. The rationale for this study design is based on\ntwo key observations. First, although there are a few studies on Internet use based on\nOkazaki, 2006), it is still unclear how people use other mobile ways (e.g. USB data\nsticks) for connecting to the Internet, and how such use is socially differentiated when\ncompared with the use of fixed Internet connections. Second, it is also unclear whether\nor not different methods of accessing the Internet are differently intertwined with peo-\nple's travelling practices. In this study, travelling practices are defined as forms of daily\nspatial mobility. By daily spatial mobility, Kellerman (2012) means two-way movement\n(e.g. journeys to and from work, school or shopping), rather than one-way movement\n(e.g. change of residence), that takes place regularly (so this does not include, for exam-\nples, vacation journeys). Ordinary means of transportation, such as cars, buses, trains and\nwalking, are typically used for daily spatial mobility. Such ordinary two-way forms of\ntravelling are central to this study, which exploits a sociological theory of mobilities, as\nIn this article, Finland serves as an example country for investigating whether mobili-\nties, both various forms of Internet connection and daily travelling practices, accumulate\nand reflect social differentiations between various socio-economic groups. The study by\nDiMaggio et al. (2004) suggests that such socio-economic differences represent con-\nstraints that are reflected in the use of digital devices (as well as in travelling practices)\nin developed countries and elsewhere. Previous similar studies consider countries such\nas Armenia (Pearce and Rice, 2013) and the United States (Brown et al., 2013; Smith,\n2012), while Finland represents a quite different country context. Finland has a high\nlevel of gender equality and a relatively homogeneous population structure (e.g. in terms\nof religion, race and language minorities), and its income differences are relatively low.\nAlthough income equality has recently shown signs of growth, the redistributive tax and\nwelfare system has remained effective in maintaining a good material living standard\nacross the social strata (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n[OECD], 2010). Previous studies on the adoption and use of new information and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) in Finland have also reflected these relatively small\ninequalities, as will be demonstrated later in this article.\nIt is against this backdrop that this article aims, first, to outline how different modes\nof physical travelling are related to (1) mobile-only, (2) fixed-only and (3) combined\nmobile/fixed Internet use. Second, the study aims to clarify whether these three methods\nof connecting to the Internet are socially differentiated in Finland. In fact, while the\nadoption of the Internet in general has received much scientific attention (e.g. Kiiski and\nPohjola, 2002; Rice and Katz, 2003), the adoption of mobile Internet use in particular has\nlargely been investigated (1) separately from fixed Internet use and (2) by focusing on\ncognitive motivations for adoption rather than socio-economic factors (e.g. Kim and\nGarrison, 2009; Shin 2007). The most relevant studies on social differentiation, in which\ndifferent ways of connecting to the Internet are studied side by side, have chiefly focused\non teenagers as a special group of Internet users (Brown et al., 2013), and on developing\ncountries (Pearce and Rice, 2013). Considering these limitations of previous studies, this\nstudy adds to the body of literature by investigating nationally representative survey data\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. First, theoretical starting points for the\nstudy will be presented. Then the article will show how previous studies have addressed\nthe relationship between travelling practices and Internet use, as well as social differen-\ntiations concerning these mobilities. Based on these considerations, hypotheses will be\ndefined for the study. The data and methods will be introduced to the reader before the\nresults are presented. The article will end with discussion and conclusions.\nLiterature\nMobilities theory\nThis study is grounded on the mobilities paradigm, largely formulated by the British\nsociologist John Urry (2000, 2007). This paradigm underlines the fact that the `social' is\nnot constituted only by dense, bodily, face-to-face interactions, but that travelling and\ncommunication technologies also function as cement, binding together people who live\napart. The paradigm claims that different mobilities are tightly interconnected and inter-\ndependent (B\u00fcscher and Urry, 2009: 102). Five mobility categories are typically pre-\nsented: (1) physical travelling of people, (2) physical movement of objects, (3)\nimaginative mobility (e.g. movement of images and ideas through means such as televi-\nsion, radio and newspapers), (4) virtual mobility (real-time communication through the\nInternet) and (5) person-to-person communication (e.g. through emails, mobile phones,\nletters etc.). (For more background, see, for example, Larsen et al., 2006: 47\u00ad48; Urry,\nMobility scholars also argue that a wide and diverse arsenal of mobility tools is a key\nasset in a modern networked life. Mobility tools contribute to the building of one's net-\nworking capacity, or so-called network capital (Elliot and Urry, 2010; Quan-Haase et al.,\n2002; Wellman and Frank, 2001). At times, network capital has been viewed as a variant\nof social capital, which emphasizes the role of personalized social networks that are\nbased on person-to-person communication (e.g. Quan-Haase et al., 2002; Wellman,\n2001; Wellman and Frank, 2001). At the same time, the literature from previous research\nis clearly insufficient in terms of understanding how different ways of accessing the\nInternet (e.g. mobile, fixed and combined) are connected to travelling practices, and\nwhat kind of social inequalities are related to the different methods of accessing the\nInternet (Taipale, 2014). This inadequacy is partly due to the qualitative and ethnographic\nmethodologies widely applied in mobility research, which have stressed the need for\nwithout also underlining the need for a systematic and statistical modelling of the rela-\ntionships between the various forms of mobility.\nOne way of understanding mobility-related inequalities is the Matthew effect approach.\nThe concept was originally used by Merton (1968), who argued that in science an emi-\nnent scholar gains more credit than a comparatively younger researcher, even if their\ncontributions to science are basically the same. In a similar vein, Internet scholars have\nargued that the Internet stimulates more usage among those with greater resources, skills\nand know-how, whereas those whose resources are scarcer benefit less (e.g. Chen and\npeople thus get richer and those with fewer mobility tools and less networking capital\nity scholars, this virtuous circle of mobilities is also acknowledged. For instance, Urry\n(2007) writes that `There are then positive feedback mechanisms whereby the network\nrich get richer and the network poor poorer, so producing greater social inequalities\nbetween people' (p. 231). Nevertheless, attempts to model statistically whether or not\nphysical and digital means of mobility tend to accumulate for some individuals have so\nfar remained rare.\nThe interconnections between travelling and Internet use\nBefore the Internet, many communication technologies, such as the television and the\nlandline phone, had already occasionally been considered threats to travelling and meet-\ning other people in person (e.g. Putnam, 2000). When the Internet was introduced, it was\nperceived as a vehicle to reduce travelling and travel-related risks, as it made it possible\nConcerns were raised that mobile communication technologies would replace traditional\nforms of social interaction with others and make travelling redundant (Gergen, 2008:\n301\u00ad302). Empirical research has, however, provided scant support for these views. It\nhas been argued, for instance, that Internet use may lead to less use of traditional media\nbut that Internet usage does not influence the amount of time spent on social activities\n(Peng and Zhu, 2011). Others have firmly argued that Internet use adds to socializing and\nIn reality, the relationship between the Internet and travelling is complex. As\nMokhtarian (2009) argues, it is difficult to improve the Internet to reduce physical travel-\nling without using the same technology to increase travelling and make it a more pleasur-\nable experience. In fact, studies from North America point out that Internet use\ncomplements face-to-face interaction rather than functions as a substitute for it (Koku\net al., 2001). Mok et al. (2010) have also reported that the frequency of face-to-face\ncontacts did not really change from the 1970s until the first decade of the 21st century,\nand that encountering others still entails physical travelling. Fortunati et al. (2013) have\nfound that, while the use of the mobile phone was connected to face-to-face (or body-to-\nit was mainly the Internet that was related to sociability. This indicates that technologies\nthat support meetings in person change over time. All in all, the literature shows that the\nInternet promotes rather than reduces personal interactions.\nMobile communication studies have shown results similar to those concerning the\nInternet: mobile communication either has a neutral effect on physical travelling or it\nmodifies travelling patterns and routes. For example, Ling and Haddon (2003) show that,\nwhile calls made via fixed phone lines caused car trips to increase in number rather than\nto decrease in number or be modified, calls from mobile phones have a more balanced\noutcome. The effect of mobile calls was evenly balanced between causing, preventing\nand changing car trips. In the same spirit, Ling and Donner (2009) later argued that\nmobile communication technologies increase the efficacy of travelling by enabling a\nflexible coordination of travel-related issues. In Sweden, Thulin and Vilhelmson (2007)\nfound that people who frequently use a mobile phone also travel and socialize with other\npeople face to face more often than those who use a mobile phone less frequently.\nHowever, all these studies have focused on mobile phone use. Other devices that enable\none to access the Internet on the move have not been studied so thoroughly.\nBased on the key theoretical proposition of mobility researchers and on the above\nreview of the somewhat diverse previous findings, the first three research hypotheses for\nthe study are defined. Using the theoretical idea of the Matthew effect, the following\nhypotheses are framed to test whether the ways and amount of travelling gradually\nincrease as the ways of accessing the Internet become more mobile (the shift from fixed-\nonly to mobile-only) and numerous (the shift from mobile-only to combined mobile/\nfixed use of the Internet).\nHypothesis 1 (H1). Fixed-only Internet use is associated with the least diverse and\nfrequent physical travelling practices.\nH2. Mobile-only Internet use is connected with relatively diverse and frequent physi-\ncal travelling practices.\nH3. Combined mobile/fixed Internet use is associated with the most diverse physical\ntravelling practices.\nSocial differentiation and Internet usage\nThe second aim of the study is geared toward analysing whether or not ways of accessing\nthe Internet are socially differentiated in Finland and, if so, whether the differentiations\ncan be understood using the idea of the Matthew effect. Two main lines of research can\nbe identified from previous studies that have analysed the socially differentiated use of\nthe Internet by statistical means. First, the adoption and non-adoption of the Internet\nhave been investigated with the purpose of understanding digital gaps within and between\ncountries. The diffusion theories (e.g. Rogers, 1983) and uses and gratification theories\n(e.g. Katz et al., 1973\u00ad1974) have been widely applied in these inquiries. Gaps have been\ndetected in relation to both technology adoption and patterns of use (e.g. Brown et al.,\n2003). Although these studies on the socially differentiated use of the Internet have pro-\nvided many important results, they have not elaborated on the different ways in which\ndifferent Internet users access the Internet.\nSecond, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and similar approaches have been\nemployed to understand the take-up of the Internet, both wired and wireless (e.g. Cheong\nthat they reduce Internet adoption to the level of cognitive processes. Internet adoption is\nmeasured by using indicators such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and\nbehavioural intentions towards the technology being studied. Some studies have extended\nthe TAM to cover predictors that are seen as peculiar to mobile Internet use (e.g. per-\nceived access barriers, Portera and Donthub, 2006), perceived ubiquity and perceived\nreachability (Kim and Garrison, 2009) and cognitive absorption (Saad and Bahli, 2005).\nAll in all, TAM research has made only a little effort to comprehend the role of socio-\ndemographics in the adoption of wireless communication technologies.\nThe TAM directs the focus of research to the motivational aspects of adoption, not to\nactual use. As such, the TAM clearly serves the purposes of consumer and business stud-\nies, which provide information on the appropriate targets for new technologies and ser-\nvices when they are introduced to the market. The limits of this approach become evident\nwhen the technology under investigation becomes extremely widespread, which is the\ncase for Internet use in many countries. For example, in Finland the use of the Internet\nFinland, 2012). For this reason, it makes increasingly good sense to explore how the\nactual patterns of Internet use are differentiated among users and, as this study does, to\nanalyse more specifically whether modes of accessing the Internet differentiate users and\ntheir travelling practices.\nIn fact, there is increasing awareness that social differentiation, which ultimately\nmeans either social inclusion or social exclusion, also includes `spatial' and `mobility'\naspects (Cass et al., 2005; Kenyon et al., 2002). There are thus good reasons to think that\nthe portability of the Internet could also be a socially differentiating factor. As the core\nfunctions of social life (family, work, leisure time, etc.) are spatially dispersed in today's\nindustrialized societies, accessing a variety of activities, goods and social relationships\nprogressively takes place through communication technologies, such as the Internet. If\npeople are categorically excluded from these new means of mobility, they face the risk\nof becoming socially excluded. Hence, it is important to have a better understanding of\nwhether the digital exclusion that follows from the rich-get-richer cycle (the Matthew\neffect) reflects offline exclusion and restricts physical travelling (Helsper, 2012).\nStudies from the United States show that mobile devices are increasingly used to\naccess the Internet, yet they still clearly differentiate between socio-demographic groups\nof people. More than half of all Americans (55%) reported that they had used a mobile\nmobile phones as the primary way of accessing the Internet. Brown et al. (2013) have\nfurther argued that US teenagers living in low-income families use their mobile phones\nfor accessing the Internet more frequently than their more affluent counterparts. For\nthese teenagers, mobile Internet access offers a way to bridge a `digital gap' even if their\nfinancial resources are constrained (see also Donner et al., 2001). In Brown et al.'s (2013)\nstudy, however, only mobile Internet users were investigated, and they were not com-\npared with other groups of Internet users. The study by Pearce and Rice (2013) is one of\nthe few that makes comparisons between mobile-based and fixed PC-based Internet\nusers. These authors found that Armenians who mostly use a mobile phone to access the\nInternet are younger than those using a PC or both a PC and a mobile phone to access the\nInternet. Armenian PC-based and combined mobile/PC-based Internet users were more\nlikely to have higher education, to have better economic standing and to live in towns\nthan mobile Internet users.\nIn Finland, only a handful of studies have tried to investigate social differentiations in\naccessing and using ICTs. The studies carried out show that socio-economic differences\nthat there is no longer any room for growth in Internet use as a whole in Finland (Statistics\nFinland, 2012). This finding indicates that accessing the Internet by the most common\nmeans, such as dial up, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) or cable, which allow\nthe fixed use of the Internet, is perhaps no longer socially differentiated in Finland. Based\non this knowledge, the following hypothesis is defined for the study:\nH4. Fixed-only Internet users are found evenly in all different socio-demographic\ngroups.\nAccessing the Internet using mobile phones and other mobile devices (e.g. laptops\nand tablet computers) is rapidly increasing in Finland, in the same way as in the United\nStates (e.g. Smith, 2012). According to Statistics Finland (2012), men more than women,\nand those under 45 years of age more than older people, use mobile Internet access in\nFinland. Taipale (2014) has shown that the use of small transportable digital tools in\nFinland is associated with male gender, young age and being a student, whereas income\nis not a predicting factor and area of residence (whether urban or not) is only a predicting\nfactor to a small extent. More generally, there is evidence that between 1999 and 2004,\nincome and education lost their predictive capacity in Finland for the perceived impor-\ntance of mobile phones, PCs, and the Internet (R\u00e4s\u00e4nen, 2008). This can be explained by\nlooking at the reduction in the prices of new technologies, but is also likely to relate to\nthe relatively small income inequality and high material living standard of Finland com-\npared to other countries worldwide (OECD, 2010). This overall picture contrasts with\nrecent studies from Armenia and the United States in which it was found that mobile use\nof the Internet is related to low income (Brown et al., 2013; Pearce and Rice, 2013).\nBased on this country-specific knowledge, the following hypothesis can be defined:\nH5. Mobile-only Internet use is related to male gender, young age and being a student,\nwhile other socio-economic factors are weakly connected or not connected at all.\nDue to the lack of knowledge about the number of Internet connections in Finland, the\nlast hypothesis is the most difficult to formulate. Although the use of basic new ICT is no\nlonger strongly related to income, official statistics show that the total number of Internet\nconnections has increased along with household income in Finland (Statistics Finland,\n2013). Nevertheless, people living in the region of the capital have, on average, more\nInternet connections (three or more) than people living in other major cities, towns and\nvillages. There is also evidence that the accumulation of Internet-related technologies in\nFinland, such as the parallel use of an Internet connection and an additional wireless\nnetwork in the home, is related to high income and to living in an urban area (Statistics\nFinland, 2012). Thus, the following hypothesis is defined:\nH6. The combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet is associated with high income and\nurban places of residence, while other socio-economic factors are weakly connected\nor not connected at all.\nFinally, the ways of connecting to the Internet are not only related to demographic or\nsocio-economic factors. A mobile and a fixed connection also have different affordances,\nsuch as functions, attributes and physical properties, that affect their usability. Pearce and\nRice (2013) show that, while PC-based Internet allows a larger display and a complete\nkeyboard, mobile-based Internet might require more compromises in terms of usability\nand functionality. The affordance of mobility is the most evident. While a fixed Internet\nconnection allows mobility only at the communicative level, a mobile Internet con-\nnection also means that the device is portable. The advantages of mobile Internet\nconnections have also affected their popularity (Finnish Communication Regulatory\nAuthority, 2013). In Finland, the number of mobile Internet subscriptions first exceeded\nData and methods\nData\nThe data (N = 612) were collected in Finland in May and June 2011, using a structured\npostal survey. The Population Register Centre of Finland carried out the nationally rep-\nresentative sampling. The sampling frame consisted of Finnish-speaking citizens aged\nbetween 15 and 65 years. The survey was pre-tested with 10 individuals. The data were\nweighted to correct for the skewed gender and age distributions that resulted from the\nhigher non-response rates of men aged between 25 and 34 years and women aged\nbetween 35 and 44 years when compared with other groups. A response rate of 24.4%\nwas reached without reminders. The subsample of Internet users (n = 475) drawn from\nthese data was used in the analysis. The design of the questionnaire benefited mainly\nfrom two earlier survey studies, the first conducted in five European countries (Fortunati,\n1998) and the second in the United States (Department of Communication Studies,\nMeasurements\nThe dependent variable indicating the way a respondent accessed the Internet was based\non the following question: `Which of the following do you use at least sometimes to\nconnect to the Internet from home?'

(Stradling, 2003). The following modalities were presented: car driver, car pas-\nsenger, motorbike, bus, train, taxi, bicycle and on foot (at least 10 minutes). The answer\nchoices were (1) most days, (2) once or twice a week, (3) about once a fortnight, (4)\nabout once a month, (5) several times a year, (6) about once a year or less and (7) never.\nThe answer choices were recoded into two: `at least once or twice a week' (answer\nchoices 1 and 2) and `less frequently' (choices 3\u00ad7).\nSocio-demographic variables were chosen according to the relevance shown by previ-\nous research. Gender was measured with fixed categories, `Male'and `Female'. Age was\ndetermined by asking for the respondent's year of birth. Years were recoded into three\ncategories (17 years or under; 18\u00ad44 years; and 45+ years) to ensure a sufficient number\nof responses in each category. Education level was measured by using the International\nStandard Classification of Education of 1997 (ISCED). Three categories were con-\nstructed for the study: low (ISCED levels 1\u00ad2), middle (ISCED levels 3, 4 and 5b) and\nhigh education (ISCED levels 5a and 6). The indicator for main economic activity\nincluded the following answer choices: employee, housewife/husband, unemployed,\npensioner and student. The level of urbanization was measured through the respondents'\nestimate of the size of the place in which they lived.

In Table 1, each of these Internet user\ngroups is compared with `All other users', one at a time (descriptive statistics for `All\nother users' are not presented in Tables 1 and 2). Table 1 shows that people who access\nthe Internet via fixed means only do not differ from other Internet users regarding any of\nthe studied characteristics. By contrast, the group of mobile-only Internet users contains\na higher proportion of women (70.1%) and a lower proportion of men (29.9%) than other\nInternet users. Mobile-only Internet users more often have a medium level education,\nand are more typically unemployed than other Internet users. The average household\nincome of mobile-only Internet users is also lower than the average income of other\nInternet users. Regarding the background characteristics of those who access the Internet\nby means of both fixed and mobile connections, Table 1 shows that they are often young\nand students. It is characteristic of these Internet users that they live in essentially urban\nareas and in households with high income.\nTable 1.

Mobile-only users, on the other hand, drive a car less\nfrequently and use the bus more regularly than other users. Those who access the Internet\nby using both wireless and wired connections can be labelled private motorists. More\nthan three-quarters of these Internet users drive a car at least once or twice a week. Some\ntravelling practices are so infrequent among these three categories of Internet users that\nthey must be dropped from further multivariate analyses. These cells are marked with\nasterisks in Table 2.\nAfter this descriptive analysis, three logistic regression models were executed to test\nthe hypotheses. The models are presented in Table 3. The predictors of travelling with\nsmall frequencies were dropped from the analysis. Nagelkerke R2 for the fixed-only\nInternet use model was .068, indicating that the model explains only a small part of the\ntotal variance.

The only mode of travelling that is used more frequently by mobile-\nonly users compared with other users is the bus, but this is also significant only at the .10\nlevel. Hence, this hypothesis is also rejected.\nH3 posited that people who access the Internet using both mobile and fixed connec-\ntions would also have more diverse and frequent travelling practices.

These Internet users not\nonly drive a car and travel as a car passenger more often than others, but they also travel\nby train and walk more habitually than all other users. As this finding reveals, the strong\naccumulation of mobilities for those who use both mobile and fixed ways of connecting\nthe Internet, it also provides support for the Matthew effect of mobilities.\nHypotheses H4, H5 and H6 addressed the issue of social differentiation in ways of\naccessing the Internet. The analysis provides strong support for H4, which proposed that\nfixed-only Internet users include people evenly from all socio-economic groups. There is\nno social differentiation between fixed-only and other Internet users as far as the socio-\ndemographic variables used in this research are considered. Thus, H4 can be accepted.\nH5 proposed that mobile-only Internet users would be male, young and students, which\nwould be a sign of more notable social differentiations in Internet access. In this respect,\nthe results are somewhat counter-intuitive. First, in this model, gender is not a significant\npredictor, indicating no statistically significant gender differences. Previous research\nindicates that the gendered patterns of mobile communication technology use may relate\nmore to differences between various family types and woman's role within these families\n(Fortunati and Taipale, 2012). Second, young age is also not connected with mobile-only\nuse, and mobile-only users are less likely to be students than to be employed. Instead, the\nanalysis shows that mobile-only users are 4.8 times more likely to be unemployed than\nto be workers (being a worker serves as a reference category in the model). Third, what\nwas less expected is that mobile-only users live in families with a lower household\nincome than those who access the Internet by using other methods. H5 is thus rejected.\nH6 suggested that people accessing the Internet through both a mobile and a fixed\nconnection have a higher income and live in urban areas, and are hence in a relatively\nsecure position in society. The regression analysis clearly confirms only that the com-\nbined mobile/fixed Internet users live in essentially urban areas, while income is not\nassociated with this combined method of accessing the Internet. In addition, the analysis\nshows that the combined mobile/fixed Internet users could be more typically men than\nwomen, as well as more commonly 17 years of age or under 45 years of age or older. It\nfollows from this that they are also more typically students than employees. H6 is thus\nonly partly confirmed. The combined mobile/fixed Internet users are perhaps not wealthy\nand in a secure social position in classical terms, but they can be considered among the\nnew vanguard of mobile-rich people (Fortunati and Taipale, 2014).\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to investigate, first, which daily travelling practices are related\nto mobile-only, fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet, and second,\nwhat kinds of social differentiations are related to these three methods of accessing the\nInternet.\nRegarding the first aim, the results clearly show that the modes of physical travelling\nused are no more diverse among mobile-only Internet users than they are among fixed-\nonly Internet users, although the theory of mobilities would suggest that the portability\nafforded by a mobile Internet connection should be reflected in a more lively and mobile\nlifestyle. In fact, these two methods of accessing the Internet are not strongly intertwined\nwith any of the forms of daily travel in the study. More interestingly, the results reveal\nthat it is only when mobile Internet use is combined with use from fixed locations that\npeople begin to utilize multiple modes of physical travelling. This suggests that it is the\ncombined mobile/fixed Internet use, not the use of mobile Internet alone, that adds to\nwidely interconnected and complex mobility systems and network capital. This intercon-\nnectedness thesis is a much-discussed topic in the theoretical and qualitative literature\nutilizing nationally representative quantitative data.\nThe same results also make apparent the Matthew effect of mobilities. While mobile-\nonly Internet use as such is not enough to translate into a mobile-rich lifestyle, when\ntaken together with the use of fixed Internet access, it facilitates mobile ways in everyday\nlife. Although this study cannot provide one solid explanation for this observation, one\nanswer might deal with the different affordances of fixed and mobile Internet use. A\nfixed connection is usually faster and more reliable, and such Internet use is also typi-\ncally supported by hardware with a higher specification, such as a large screen and com-\nplete keyboard, which allows full-scale utilization of the Internet (Pearce and Rice,\n2013). These affordances of a fixed, and especially a PC-based, Internet connection may\nbetter serve the need of those planning a route and making travel arrangements in advance\n(e.g. printing out maps and downloading travel music). Furthermore, these results sup-\nport the previous findings that mobile communication adds to rather than substitutes for\nIn response to the second aim, the study shows that mobile-only Internet users, in\ncontrast to what was hypothesized, belong to a socio-economically less advantageous\npart of society in Finland. This result appears surprising as income differences in general\nhave lost their relevance as the predictors of basic ICT use from Finland (e.g. R\u00e4s\u00e4nen,\n2008; Taipale, 2014). Hence, this result is more in line with previous research from the\nUnited States (Brown et al., 2013) and Armenia (Pearce and Rice, 2013), societies that,\nin terms of their social, economic and cultural structures, are different to Finland. In\nthese other two countries, Internet use based on a mobile phone is largely related to low\nincome. This similarity in results, irrespective of the fact that mobile Internet was con-\nceptualized and measured differently in all the studies, can be seen as an indication of a\nmore international phenomenon that deserves more scholarly attention.\nThe results also revealed socio-economic factors that differentiate between combined\nmobile/fixed and other Internet users. It is young people, men, students and those living\nin urban areas, who are most likely to utilize both mobile and fixed ways of accessing the\nInternet in Finland. Considering that daily travelling practices were also most diverse\namong this group, it appears that various means of mobility accumulate for this rather\nwell-defined group of Internet users. Although the Matthew effect proved to be valid\nhere, it is worth reminding that the combined fixed/mobile use was not associated with\nhousehold income. These Internet users do not have higher household income than other\nusers, but their average income does not prevent them from using a wide array of both\nphysical and digital mobilities. In this sense, high income is not a strong precondition for\nextensive mobility in Finland.\nThe implications of these findings for the theory are twofold. First, the study clearly\nprovides reasons to think that the mere possibility of digital mobile connectivity through\nmobile-only Internet is not a sufficient key to success in increasingly mobile and technol-\nogy-saturated societies. Even in developed countries like Finland, mobile-only Internet\npresents relatively constricted possibilities for going online. Second, the study provides\nsupport for the Matthew effect on mobilities, although only if one specifies that it is not\nmobile-only Internet use alone but mobile Internet use accompanied with fixed Internet\nuse that leads to the accumulation of mobilities.\nBesides the fact that this article deals with only one country, the study also has another\nlimitation that is worth discussing. It is not clear whether mobile-only users really go\nonline if they utilize, say, a USB data stick. It is likely that a certain proportion of them\nuse a data stick to connect their fixed desktop computer to the Internet, and use it only\noccasionally with their laptop or other mobile device. However, even if not continuously\nutilized, the possibility of accessing the Internet on the move is an untapped resource that\ncan be exploited when the need arises. Thus, a more careful study of why people pur-\nchase USB data sticks and similar products (whether due to their transportability, low\nprice or the possibility of tethering the stick to many devices) would help us to specify\nfurther how mobile Internet use is embedded in mobile lifestyle and daily travelling\npractices.\n"
