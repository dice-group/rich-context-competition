Regular\nnational data collection exercises with the production of reli-\nable and valid data are one way in which nations signal their\nmembership of a global community (Barrett & Tsui, 1999).\nIncreasing use of metrics to measure \"development\" and\n\"progress\" toward achieving targets such as the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals means that statistical data are becoming\nmore important although much \"data\" produced by interna-\ntional organizations such as the World Bank and the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) are, in fact, guessti-\nSince its establishment in 1947 under the UN Department\nof Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Statistical\nDivision (UNSD) has been concerned with the systematic\norganization and compilation of country-level statistics and\nindicators (UNSD, 2013). The UNSD has encouraged postin-\ndependenceAfrican states to standardize and streamline their\ndata collection and has provided definitions and guidelines\nto be used in data collection and training (Ching'anda &\nNtozi, 1998). Key themes emitting from the UNSD are the\ndevelopment of National Statistical Systems (NSS), regular\ndata collection, and improving and standardizing data collec-\ntion to facilitate comparability.\nA key concept in censuses and surveys is the definition\nof household; this determines the units for which much data\nare collected and analyzed, and thus influences the data that\nare the basis for many policies.

Throughout the article, we consider the role of compa-\nrability in the evolution of definitions.\nMethod\nTwo research methods and data sources inform this work.\nWe review UN and national documentation on definitions\nand concepts along with survey and census enumerators'\nmanuals in diverse African countries. We then focus on the\ndefinition of the household and the collection and manage-\nment of household-level data in analyzing the relationship\nbetween UN guidelines over the past 50 years and actual\npractice in two Anglophone (Tanzania and Uganda) and\ntwo Francophone (Senegal and Burkina Faso) African\ncountries. Further insight is provided by in-depth inter-\nviews in the same countries with individuals in different\npositions within the hierarchy of National Statistical Offices\nfrom retired and contemporary senior personnel to census\nand survey enumerators (for more detail, see www.house-\nholdsurvey.info).\nUN Influence on Data Production\nMost census and many household survey reports acknowl-\nedge technical advice and help provided by outside agencies\n(e.g., United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA], U.S.\nBureau of Census, United Nations Economic Commission\nforAfrica [UNECA]), although it is rarely made explicit how\nthese relationships work in terms of decisions about defini-\ntions and their operationalization. References in census doc-\numentation indicate the importance of conforming to UN\nprinciples and this is a clearly articulated dimension of\nnational modernity.\nThe Tanzanian 1967 census report stated,\nThe census was conducted according to modern scientific\nprinciples as summarized in recent recommendations by the\nUnited Nations and its Economic Commission for Africa.\n(United Republic of Tanzania, 1969, p. viii)\nThe introduction to the 1975 Burkinabe (Upper Volta)\ncensus report states,\nUndertaken within the framework of the African Census\nProgramme, [the census] fulfils the principal requirements of\nthe United Nations Statistical Commission (p. 5) . . . it forms an\nimportant step towards the development of a modern system of\ndata collection (p. 6). (R\u00e9publique de Haute-Volta, 1978,\npp. 5-6, our translation)\nAfter a detailed history of colonial censuses, the introduc-\ntion to the 1960 Ghana census report emphasizes,\nThe 1960 Population census of Ghana is a modern census carried\nout according to the principles and recommendations laid down\nby the United Nations. (Republic of Ghana, 1962, p. xi)\nThe Ghanaian administrative report reporting on the 1960\ncensus states,\nThe concepts and classifications used in the Census were largely\nbased on international recommendations.Adaptations were made\nFrequent references to the United Nations in Ghana's doc-\numentation as far back as 1960 demonstrate the strong\nawareness of the UN principles and definitions as these\nguided the evolution of census data collection. But, because\nof problems in making these definitions workable locally,\nthere are many adaptations. The Ghanaian census bureau's\nmove from collecting data for occupants of \"houses\" in 1960\nence of the international agenda and its concepts.\nIn general, Anglophone African censuses conducted late\nin the colonial era and early in independence, although\ndependent on outside funding and advice, were grounded in\ndetailed knowledge about local conditions and social organi-\nzation. The guiding principle was to get the most accurate\ncensus count (avoiding omissions and double counting\nthrough a de facto1 approach) and using local vocabulary to\ndefine enumeration units. The census was primarily pre-\nsented as a national affair and part of postindependence\nnation-state building.\nDespite increasing impetus toward harmonized global\nguidelines and frameworks for statistics (International defini-\ntion and measurement of standards and levels of living [UN,\n1954b], Framework for Social and Demographic Statistics\nthe Human Development Index was first produced, that data\nproduced by censuses and surveys really became interna-\ntional goods: This may have generated greater pressure for\nindividual countries to conform in terms of concepts and defi-\nnitions. Other non-UN international surveys, such as the\nWorld Fertility Survey (late 1970s) had focused attention on\nthe comparative power of harmonized data. Recently the\ndemand for social statistics and indicators has grown signifi-\ncantly (see UNGA, 2014), in part due to the need to monitor\nprogress toward goals agreed at international summits (e.g.,\nRandall et al. 3\nConference on Population & Development, 1995 World\nSummit for Social Development, 1995 World Conference on\nWomen, Millennium Development Goals). Because house-\nhold surveys and censuses are central to the production of\ndata, much UNSD work has focused on the production of\nComparability\nThe 1954 UN Handbook of Population Census Methods\nhighlights the key role of comparability:\nFor the purposes of international comparability it is desirable\nthat a de facto enumeration be made; that is, a count of all the\npersons present in the country at the time of enumeration. Any\ndata on a de jure basis which may be desired should be obtained\nMost Anglophone censuses followed this de facto\napproach and some census instructions emphasized the\nimportance of the de facto enumeration over other concerns\nas highlighted in the Ugandan enumerator's manual for\nA household is defined as a group of persons who normally live\nand eat together. This is a very loose definition and there may be\nmany cases when you are in doubt as to whether people should\nbe included in the same household or shown as belonging to\nseparate households. It is not possible in these instructions to\ncover all such cases in detail, and your decision in such cases\nshould be determined by common sense and convenience in the\nenumeration. It is not a matter of great importance whether or\nnot such persons are included in one household or shown\nbelonging to separate households. The important thing is that\nevery person should be enumerated. (Republic of Uganda, 1974,\np. 87, emphasis added)\n\"Comparability\" is a dominant theme throughout UN\ndocumentation, and it tends to take precedence over other\nconsiderations such as local applicability of concepts. In\nterms of the ways in which these influences affected prac-\ntices in National Statistical Offices, the emphasis from the\nUnited Nations is clear that they should\nco-operate in the design of standard and uniform procedures for\nsample surveys to obtain better indicators of levels of living.\nand from the same report:\nDiscussion of the value of household inquiries, especially in\ndeveloping areas, was carried a step further by the Working\nGroup of Experts on Family Living Studies convened by the\nInternational Labour Office in 1955. This group recommended\ninter alia that the international agencies should aid in the\ndevelopment of sound methods of study and encourage\ninternational comparability by issuing lists of standard\ndefinitions and classifications to be used in household enquiries.\nThe impetus from the United Nations toward comparabil-\nity and standardization over time is clear and focused on\ncountries in receipt of funding and technical support for sta-\ntistical data collection. The comparability of statistics is an\nimportant part of demographic training and our analyses of\ndiscussions with higher level personnel within the Tanzanian\nstatistical office and international organizations make it clear\nthat preoccupations about comparability often overruled\nother considerations about the validity of demographic data\n(Randall, Coast, & Leone, 2011). However, although compa-\nrability--over time within countries and over space between\ncountries--is frequently talked about, in practice, there are\nsignificant deviations from this ideal.\nCensus enumeration units have become more standard-\nized over the last 50 years and most countries now use\n\"household\" rather than another unit such as dwelling or\nfamily. For example,\nGambia changed from the use of family/yard in 1963, to\nMalawi moved from using the dwelling unit to a house-\nSouth Africa moved from using the family to the house-\nHowever, although the term household is now ubiquitous,\nthe way it is locally defined and interpreted still varies\nconsiderably.\nUN Concept of Household\nThe UN documentation on household definition is extremely\nconsistent over time. In 1959, there were discussions about\ntwo different approaches to household: the housekeeping\nunit and household-housing unit concepts (United Nations,\n1959), reproducing recommendations from the UN docu-\nment \"Principles and Recommendations for National\nPopulation Censuses\":\nA private household should preferably be defined as: (a) one-\nperson household: a person who lives alone in a separate housing\nunit or who, as a lodger, occupies a separate room or rooms in a\npart of a housing unit but does not join with any of the other\noccupants of the housing unit to form part of a multi-person\nhousehold as defined below; or (b) multi-person household: a\ngroup of two or more persons who combine to occupy the whole\nor part of a housing unit and to provide themselves with food or\nother essentials for living. The group may pool their incomes\nand have a common budget to a greater or lesser extent. The\ngroup may be composed of related persons only or of unrelated\npersons or of a combination of both, including boarders but\n4 SAGE Open\nThe key dimension here is \"housekeeping,\" which\nrevolves around \"provide themselves with food.\" This phrase\nis itself ambiguous, as demonstrated by the example of two\nwives of a polygamous man: both obtain the grain for their\nmeals from the family granary that is managed by their joint\nhusband. The granary is filled with grain cultivated on fields\n\"owned\" by the husband and his lineage and worked on by\nhis wives and children. The wives take this grain and cook it\nseparately in different kitchens attached to their different\nhouses in the same compound and then feed themselves and\ntheir children and each sends food to their husband. In this\ncommon case, if \"provide themselves with food\" refers to\nthe source of food--the communal granary--then both\nwives, their husband, and any dependent children (and oth-\ners) will form one household. However if \"provide with\nfood\" is interpreted as being related to the cooking and eat-\ning of the food, thus focusing on the \"cooking pot,\" each\nwife constitutes a separate household, and a somewhat arbi-\ntrary decision is made about which household the husband is\nassigned to.\nDespite this ambiguity, the wording of the UN definition\nof household for censuses barely changes over the next few\nThe concept of \"household\" is based on the arrangements made\nby persons, individually or in groups, for providing themselves\nwith food or other essentials for living. (DESA, 1980, p. 50)\n1.324. The concept of household is based on the arrangements\nmade by persons, individually or in groups, for providing\nthemselves with food or other essentials for living.\nknown as the housekeeping concept. It does not assume that the\nnumber of households and housing units is equal . . .\n1.326 . . . Some countries use a concept different than the\nhousekeeping concept described in the previous paragraph,\nnamely, the \"household-dwelling\" concept, which regards all\npersons living in a housing unit as belonging to the same\nhousehold. (According to this concept, there is one household\nper occupied housing unit.) In the household-dwelling concept,\nthen, the number of occupied housing units and the number of\nhouseholds occupying them are equal and the locations of the\nhousing units and households are identical. However, this\nconcept can obscure information on living arrangements, such\nas doubling up, that is relevant for evaluating housing needs.\nThe definition of household most often used in national censuses\nconducted during the 1990 round of censuses incorporates both\nthe housekeeping and household-dwelling concepts. (DESA,\nIn referring to both housekeeping and household-dwell-\ning, the final sentence of this quote highlights the lack of\nclarity and consistency even in standardized approaches. All\nthe definitions require cohabitation although the UN docu-\nmentation demonstrates the subtle differences between\nhouseholds defined on coresidence alone and those based on\nhousekeeping where the definition is ultimately is trying to\ncapture an economic unit. However, as elucidated below, the\nhousekeeping concept gets reduced in some contexts (par-\nticularly Anglophone East Africa) to cooking and eating\ntogether, which is then prioritized in national definitions. In\nsuch cases, culturally determined patterns of cooking and\ncoeating come to be the principal defining characteristic of\nthe household rather than having a common budget.\nInterviews with statisticians and other individuals along\nthe chain of data production and use in African statistical\noffices revealed that many see the UN definition of the\nhousehold (and their own national interpretation of this) as\nan alien concept that has been developed for statistical and\ndemographic analysis, under demands for comparability,\nrather than something that represents a fundamental and\nlocally relevant social unit. It is a technical term that needs to\nbe learnt and then applied to generate the \"comparable\" sta-\ntistics required.\nLocal Understanding or Comparable\nUnits?\nAlthough the UN explanations clarify the difference between\na housekeeping household and a household-dwelling, trans-\nlating this into units of data collection may be difficult in the\nfield. Furthermore, data collection in multilingual contexts\nrequires ways for enumerators to explain to respondents the\nunits for which data are being collected (Randall, Coast,\nCompaore, & Antoine, 2013). Hence, a tension arises\nbetween the UN household unit and actual living arrange-\nHouseholds in early Botswana censuses were based on\nlocal knowledge and vocabulary about social organization,\nwith an anthropologist cited as the source for the explanation\nof the enumeration unit.\nThe household is the smallest well defined social unit and, in\nProfessor Shapera's words, \"It consists basically of a man with\nhis wife or wives, and their unmarried children, but often\nincludes one or more married sons, brothers or even daughters,\nwith their respective families.\" Every household has its own\ncompound, known as a \"lolwapa,\" consisting of one or more\nhuts and a granary within a courtyard surrounded by a reed\nfence, a wooden palisade, a low earthen wall or something\nsimilar. In most cases therefore the household is an easily\nrecognised physical entity and it formed the basic enumeration\nunit. It is the compound which is referred to as the \"dwelling\"\nand not the individual huts within it, and the people living within\nthe compound are referred to as the household. (Republic of\nThis 1972 definition makes no reference at all to house-\nkeeping, provision, or consumption of food. By 1981,\nRandall et al. 5\nBotswana's approach to the household had moved away\nfrom local anthropological references and closer to the UN\nhousekeeping approach.\nIn general those who live in a \"lolwapa\" or its equivalent should\nbe shown as one household if they eat from the same pot.\nOtherwise they should be regarded as separate households.\nLocal vocabulary is retained but the issue of eating from\nthe same cooking pot is introduced, with the interpretation of\nthe UN's \"common provision for food\" becoming \"eating\nfrom the same pot.\"\nGhana's earlier censuses also grappled with how to apply\na standardized definition of the household:\nFor the unit of enquiry the household was proposed. But owing\nto difficulties of definition which enumerators were expected\nto encounter it was decided to record in the census individuals\nby house or compound and to use the household concept only\nin the PES [Post-enumeration survey]. It was realised that the\nhouse or compound may not necessarily correspond to\nparticular economic or social concepts. (Republic of Ghana,\nLater the report does define \"household\" as used in the\npostenumeration survey (PES):\nThe definition adopted finally in the PES, \"a person or group of\npersons all living and eating together from the same cooking\npot\" was in fact, a slightly modified version of the United\nNations concept adopted to suit the African social environment.\nCompared with the 1959 UN household definition of\n\"provide themselves with food and other essentials for liv-\ning,\" this 1964 Ghanaian definition is actually very different,\nand potentially a smaller unit--specifically talking about\neating out of the same cooking pot--a phraseology that is\nnever used in the UN documentation.\nhouses as the unit, in 1984, Ghana moved to households and\nhousekeeping.\nA household was defined as follows: \"a household consists of a\nperson or group of persons who live together in the same house\nor compound, share the same housekeeping arrangements and\nare catered for as one unit. . . . For instance two brothers who\nlive in the same house with their wives and children may or may\nnot form separate households depending on their catering\narrangements. . . . A usual member of household was considered\nto be any person who, whether present or absent on Census\nNight has spent (i.e. lived together in the same house or\ncompound, shared the same housekeeping arrangements and\nbeen catered for as one unit with the other members of the\nhousehold) at least the last 6 months with the household.\"2\nThis definition (and that of the 2000 census) uses \"cater-\ning arrangements\" rather than cooking pot and is close to the\nUN definition.\nSometimes, the interpretation of the UN guidelines\nremains ambiguous. For example, in the (de facto) 1987\nMalawian census,\nA household consisted of one or more persons, related or\nunrelated, who make common provision for food and who\nregularly take their food from the same pot and/or share the\nsame grainhouse (nkhokwe) or pool their incomes together for\nthe purpose of purchasing food. (Government of Malawi, 1987,\nThe same definition was used in 1998 and in the census\nreport on households and household characteristics it is\nreferred to as \"the UN definition\" (Government of Malawi,\nimportant guiding role. However the inclusion of \"and/or\"\nmakes this a more inclusive unit than a \"cooking pot\" inter-\npretation of \"provide themselves with food.\"\nIn most cases, we can discern the ways different countries\nmanage to combine UN guidelines with local social organi-\nzation through instructions within manuals or comments in\nreports. In Tanzania, a key-informant interview provided a\nclear insight into work undertaken to simultaneously inte-\ngrate local vocabulary with the requirements generated by\ncomparability and conformity with the UN concepts.\nSo when we, at NBS (in mid 1970s) when we sent and we\ndiscussed this in meeting and we said well, we now have to look\nfor a word in Kiswahili--there were suggestions more than\none--as usual--we said well we have the National Kiswahili\nCouncil and we have the Department of Kiswahili at UDSM\n[University of Dar Es Salaam]. We shall send them the definition\nof the household as we know it from the UN now we shall ask\nthem to suggest what is it the Kiswahili equivalent that would fit\nthat UN definition, that long thing . . . they also came up with the\nkaya. Kaya is the arrangement that best suits that definition of\nthe household from the UN. (Senior retired Tanzanian\nstatistician/demographer)\nIn Tanzania, with its national language and a clear desire\nto follow UN requirements, there was a deliberate move\ntoward a particular word based on a well-articulated piece of\nresearch undertaken to specifically identify the best local\nterm. However, in many contexts (including multilingual\nTanzania), there are real problems matching the UN concept\nonto a slightly different concept or word that already exists in\na local language (Randall et al., 2013), as shown here for\nBurkina Faso.\nIt's very difficult [in Fulfulde] to find a word like that, but, well,\nfollowing the definition which has been agreed before the\nfieldwork, we are forced to explain it. On top of that you add\nextra things. For example if we say that they have to pool the\nresults of their production, to translate that into Fulfulde . . . [in\n6 SAGE Open\nthe field] when we go people often say, well there are the old\nmen, but we, we have our definitions which are there and we are\nforced to say even though the old man is there that doesn't mean\nto say that we can't have different households . . . the definitions\nare there to respond to needs, it's a standard definition that's\nthere. (Burkina Faso; statistician and former Institut National de\nla Statistique et de la D\u00e9mographie [INSD] enumerator)\nThis tension is reiterated by a UNFPA advisor\nBut the majority of these surveys they get the definition from\n[the statistical office] and they try to use it. Unfortunately what\nhappens is, where the respondents have their own perceptions\nand also the enumerator they have their own perceptions. A lot\nof the data that we get in this part of the world is indicative of\nthis question, it's not quite perfect information because of this\nconfusion. (UNFPA advisor, East Africa)\nWhere the UN definition is adopted by the statistical\noffice but there are no clear ways of translating it into local\nlanguages, then the definition needs to be broken down into\nits constituent parts and explained to both data collectors\nand respondents. It seems to be these explanations of the UN\ndefinition in recent years that have led the definitions down\na route we identify as the \"cooking pot\" pathway. The sim-\nplest interpretation of arrangements . . . for providing them-\nselves with food or other essentials for living is to say \"those\npeople who eat out of the same cooking pot,\" which in some,\nbut not all, contexts is the group who also provisions\ntogether to fill that cooking pot. This emerges clearly in\nUganda.\nA household has got a standard definition. We look at two\nelements to define a household. The first one--actually the most\nimportant--is the eating area. People must be dining together.\nThey may live together but as long as they are not feeding from\nthe same pot, then those ones are different households. (Uganda\nBureau of Statistics [UBOS] statistician, Uganda)\nHowever, eating out of the same cooking pot is only a\nvery limited interpretation of the UN definition and one that\nmoves away from the original goal of a definition attempting\nto capture society's basic economic consumption unit. There\nmay be culturally prescribed patterns of cooking and eating\ntogether--such as in polygamous populations where every\nwife cooks in her hut for her children, yet the economic unit\nof production and consumption is much wider and would put\nall those wives in one \"household.\" In other contexts, the\ndistribution of a very large household around several cook-\ning pots may be purely practical but would lead to several\ncensus households.\nOver time, the guidance from the UNSD has become\nmore detailed although not necessarily with clear explana-\ntions about how to resolve perennial practical issues. The\ntensions between the statistical definition of the household\nand its operationalization in field data collection are well\nestablished:\nWhile the household concept has not been widely contested as a\nconsumption unit, questions have been raised regarding its\nmeaning as a production unit or income generating unit. The\nmain argument is that persons living in the same housing unit\nwho together make provision for food and other essential items\nmay not necessarily pool their income or make decisions jointly\nregarding their economic activities. Various situations may arise\nin different societies. For example, in manyAfrican communities\nan extended family comprising several households may own and\ncultivate a field together, while cooking and housekeeping\narrangements are still made separately by each household level.\nThe consumption unit may also include persons who do not\nreside with the household although they regularly take their\nmeals in common. The usual concept of household may therefore\nrequire considerable adaptation or elaboration in order to be\napplied consistently in particular societies. (UNSD, 1984, p. 99)\nThe final sentence is informative about the problematic\nrelationship between UN guidelines and local implementa-\ntion of them because no advice is given about how this adap-\ntationmightbeachievedwhilestillmaintainingcomparability.\nMost countries have ignored this UN awareness of the com-\nplexity of African households and oriented their definitions\naround the minimal group of those who live, cook, and eat\ntogether.\nThe 1997 Principles and Recommendations for Population\nand Housing Censuses (DESA, 1997) dedicated two pages to\nexplaining the concept of the household, its different dimen-\nsions, and how these things should be recorded. The explana-\ntion still commences with \"[those] who make common\nprovision for food or other essentials for living\" (DESA,\n1997, p. 65) but then develops a wealth of detail and clarifi-\ncation. Interestingly, a key concept in many national defini-\ntions, that of eating together out of the same pot, is not\nmentioned.\nCase Study Countries: Diversity in\nEvolution of Definitions\nOur comparative case study countries were selected because\nthey experienced different colonial histories and postcolonial\npolitical ideologies, with contrasting geographic and linguis-\ntic settings. Yet all are members of the United Nations and all\nhave invested considerably in statistical development. We\naim to establish where there are clear temporal trends across\nthe countries in terms of their relationship with the UN defi-\nnitions and guidelines, which remained constant throughout\nthe half century with \"joint provision of food or essentials of\nliving.\" Table 1 summarizes the dominant criteria of each\nnational definition over time and is based on detailed extracts\nfrom census documentation (see the appendix).\nThe documentation for the 1975 Burkina Faso (then\nUpper Volta) census identifies compounds and households\nwith a somewhat confusing overlapping use of \"family\"\n(R\u00e9publique de Haute-Volta, 1978). Households were enu-\nmerated within compounds and a household could only\nRandall et al. 7\ninclude one married man with his wives and unmarried\ndependants. There is no mention of provision of food or\n2006), Burkina Faso follows some aspects of the UN defini-\ntion closely by requiring co-residence and common provi-\nsion of food and daily life, but it also requires the recognition\nof a household head and that a household cannot contain two\nmarried couples. Both these conditions diverge from the UN\nguidelines, and the latter hinders comparability with other\ncountries. The report on the Burkina 1985 census specifi-\ncally recognizes:\nAs it is defined here [i.e. one married couple per household], the\nhousehold loses its meaning as an economic and production\nunit. The notion of household has principally been used in the\ncensus as a control variable to ensure exhaustive enumeration.\nThe 1985 census report tables on donn\u00e9es collectives\n[group data] present the characteristics of compounds and\ncompound heads, with just one table on \"households per com-\npound.\" However, in 1996, although the definitions remain\nidentical, and despite the 1985 proviso above, the donn\u00e9es\nTable 1.

It is unclear how \"shared living costs\"\ncould possibly be operationalized in a de facto census and\nthe enumerators we interviewed interpreted the guidelines as\nmeaning eating together.\nUganda's de facto censuses utilize a restricted interpreta-\ntion of \"joint provision of food or essentials of living\" sum-\nmarized as \"eating together.\" This cooking pot dimension is\nprioritized by all our Ugandan key informants.\nSenegal is totally different from bothAnglophoneTanzania\nand Uganda, and other Francophone countries, with clear\ndefinitions that prioritize what are seen to be Senegalese char-\nacteristics. Pilon and Vignikin (2006) show that in all com-\nparativeanalyses(censusorsurveys)Senegalhassubstantially\nlarger households than any other African country; this is\nprobably a consequence of their approach to definitions. In\n1976, Senegal avoided the problems posed by the household\nby avoiding the concept altogether and de jure enumerating\ncompounds (concessions) and their constituent family nuclei\nfor the household (m\u00e9nage), defined as living together in the\nsame compound, eating together, and under the authority of\none head of household: subsequent clarifications indicate that\nliving together takes precedence over eating together. Clear\nexamples of the enumeration units were given by providing\nlocal words (see the appendix), which almost certainly means\nthat during enumeration these local words were used in pref-\nerence to any precise definition.\nEach country has taken a different route to reconciling\nlocal conditions with the UN definition. Whereas Tanzania\nmade huge efforts to conform to the United Nations, Uganda\nconcentrated on a particular interpretation of UN \"joint pro-\nvision\" by focusing on the cooking pot. Senegal has largely\nremained detached from UN recommendations apart from\nchanging from concessions and noyaux to \"households.\" By\nretaining the importance of the household head and the use\nof local words, it is clear that they are prioritizing local orga-\nnization rather than international comparability. Burkina\nFaso complied with much UN wording but added local pri-\norities about married couples.\nCensus: Household Structure and\nRelationships Within Them\nEarly census data were collected on people within \"house-\nholds\" because that was the most effective way of enumerating\nthe whole population (Republic of Uganda 1974, appendix).\nRelationships within households, and household structure,\nhave become an increasingly important dimension of house-\nhold data collection because of their importance for under-\nstanding support and welfare. UN documentation provides\ndetailed guidelines for household composition data collection\nbut national censuses oscillate between following UN guidance\nand trying to cope with making these data meaningful locally.\nThe practical problems of recording standardized relationships\nwithin the statistical household are well established:\nTraditional kinship systems especially in developing countries,\nmay permit several interpretations of \"mother,\" \"brother,\"\n\"sister,\" \"wife,\" \"widow\" and other kin and therefore, special\nknowledge is required in order to translate data based on these\nrelationships into internationally comparable form. (United\nUN advice acknowledges challenges of application in the\nfield while exhorting the need for comparability.\nAfter identification of the head or other reference member of the\nhousehold, each of the remaining members of the household\nshould be distinguished in relation to that person, as appropriate,\nas one of the following: (a) spouse, (b) child, (c) spouse of child,\n(d) grandchild or great-grandchild, (e) parent (or parent of\nspouse), (f) other relative, (g) domestic employee or (h) other\nperson not related to the head or other reference member. Where\nthis classification is considered too detailed for successful\ncollection of the information, categories (e) and (f) may be\nconsolidated as Other relative and (g) and (h) can be consolidated\nCollecting data on household structure via relationship\nwith the household head assumes that household head is a\nvalid concept and that individuals are members of that house-\nhold through their relationship with that person. This may gen-\nerate problems of coherence in de facto data collection when\nthe household head is absent or for de jure approaches, when\nthe recognized household head has been absent for longer than\nthe residential cutoff (often 6 months). By only allowing a lim-\nited number of relationships with the household head, locally\ncoherent household structures can be obscured.\nThis limited classification may work well in populations\nwhere most households are small and constituted of nuclear\nfamilies or their close derivatives. Its ability to represent the\ndiversity and complexity of many African households, let\nalone contribute to understanding how support is provided\nfor the socially or physically vulnerable (a stated aim of the\ndata collection), is limited.\nWhereas the importance of understanding changing\nhousehold composition was recognized in early UN docu-\nmentation, approaches to this issue have not really been\nrevisited in Africa in the light of new computer technology\nand the possible inappropriateness of the categories.\nRelationships could now be recorded in more meaningful\nways to include relationships between different household\nRandall et al. 9\nmembers while retaining comparability by simultaneously\nrecording relationships to household head. The potential\ncomparative analysis of household structure from the differ-\nent codes in recent censuses (Table 2) is very limited.\nNot every country follows UN guidelines. Ghanaian\nreports on the 1970 census repeated earlier concerns that the\nUN relationships did not match well onto African usage\nThe conventional relationship titles which are so deeply rooted\nin African society had to be avoided so as to make analysis of\nthe household pattern meaningful. (Republic of Ghana, 1964b,\nThis led to the development of a large number of detailed\ncodes such as \"mother's brother's son/daughter.\" In 1970,\nbecause of the de facto enumeration, temporary heads (99)\nhad a different code to head (11). There were 14 relationship\ncodes for people in the house who were relatives of the\nhead--and a code for those who were relatives of the head's\nspouse (Republic of Ghana, 1975, p. xiv).\nOther deviations from UN guidelines are observed in\nKenya. In 1962, the census form instructs \"relationship to\nhead of household.\" In 1969, this has become \"relationship\"\nand in 1979 \"what is the relationship of this person to the\nhead of household or other members of the household?\" The\nenumerator instructions state that\nTable 2.

In such cases concentrate first on relating parents\nand their children, then on relating husbands and wives and then\non relating persons to the head of household or other members\nThese confusing instructions are followed by indications\nthat they should write things like \"daughter of 4\" using line\nnumbers. In 1989, Kenyan relationship codes reverted back\nto a precise repetition of the UN guidelines to record rela-\ntionship to the head of household (Republic of Kenya, 1989).\nUganda's 1991 census questionnaire also asked for relation-\nship to head or other member of household. It is not clear\nwhy these more flexible and informative approaches have\nbeen abandoned, but it might be the influence of interna-\ntional standardization and comparability.\nYet again, Senegal demonstrates its independent approach\nto data collection. In 1976, people were enumerated in com-\npounds and family nuclei within the compound. It is explained\nthus: The familial nucleus (noyau) is the smallest possible\nfamily cell that can exist and is constituted by the spouses (or\none spouse) and their directly descended unmarried descen-\ndants who must live in the same compound. By extension, the\nsame family nucleus can include a husband with several\nwives and their unmarried children living in the same com-\npound and direct ascendants (mother of the head of the family\nnucleus), brothers and sisters, and close unmarried kin (neph-\news, nieces, uncles, etc.) on condition that they live with the\nhead of the familial nucleus and do not have their own unmar-\nried children in the compound. This is identical to the unit\ncalled \"household\" in the Burkinabe censuses.\nAlthough this notion was abandoned for the subsequent\ntwo censuses, it was reinstated in the 2013 census where the\nenumerator's manual states,\nThe familial nucleus corresponds to the \"biological\" family. It is\nmade up of the parents (or one of the parents) and their unmarried/\nunpartnered direct descendants (biological children). Thus a\nhousehold can be made up of one or several familial nuclei. Note\nthat a polygamous household which includes unmarried children\nmakes up one single nucleus if all the members live and take their\nmeals together in the same compound.Anucleus can also include\ndirect ascendants, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts,\ngrandchildren, unmarried nephews and nieces who are supported\nby the head of the nucleus.\nEnumerating household members depends on the principle of\nthe closest kin link. The household head is the first person to\nrecord on the questionnaire. Then you enumerate close kin of\nthe household head before moving onto distant kin and those\nwith no kinship link with him, keeping track, where possible\neach person's membership of a specific familial nucleus.\nKey informant interviews indicate that many Senegalese\nresearchers and statisticians consider that this idea of nucleus\nand the relationships within it captures the essence ofAfrican\nfamilial and household structure.\nIt [familial nucleus] is an excellent thing, especially for censuses.\nIt helps us avoid many errors, because the concept of noyau\nallows you, when you are in a household, which is usually\npolygamous, to be certain that you have first identified all the\nbiological children for each wife and all the other people who\nhave no biological links with the household head. And there is\nthe advantage that, when you are with a polygamous couple you\ncan, for each wife, identify her biological children and the\nchildren who are related by more distant kinship links. So if you\ndo that you can be sure that you haven't omitted a single person,\nbecause when you are interested in the biological family what is\ncertain is that there is a strong chance no-one will be left out . . . .\nIt's a way of checking, but also for analysis, it allows you in\nsome way to have a good understanding of the exact composition\nof the household. But particularly for data collection this\napproach ensures exhaustivity. (Statistician: Agence Nationale\nde la Statistique et de la D\u00e9mographie [ANSD])\nSenegal has also used \"noyaux\" in surveys and has thus\napproached the problems of enumerating complex African\nfamilies and their residential and economic arrangements\nthrough local management of data collection rather than fol-\nlowing the UN guidelines.\nHouseholds in Nationally\nRepresentative Surveys: The Influence\nof Censuses\nCensuses and surveys have rather different purposes; com-\nplete enumeration for censuses versus in-depth information\nfor surveys. However, because the establishment of statisti-\ncal offices to conduct censuses generally preceded sample\nsurvey development, alongside pressure for comparability,\nthe influence of established UN census design and concepts\non survey definitions is clear:\nThe problems of definition encountered are common to\npopulation enumeration in any context; therefore, it is suggested\nthat, where the difficulties have been faced and a satisfactory\ndefinition of a household has been evolved for purposes of\npopulation census, it will usually be desirable to adopt that for\nsample surveys also. In most cases this will be the international\nstandard definition of private household, developed to promote\ninternational comparability in population census results. (United\nThe merits of standardization were promoted by interna-\ntional organizations at an early stage:\nDiscussion of the value of household inquiries, especially in\ndeveloping areas, was carried a step further by the Working\nGroup of Experts on Family Living Studies convened by the\nInternational Labour Office in 1955. This group recommended\ninter alia that the international agencies should aid in the\ndevelopment of sound methods of study and encourage\ninternational comparability by issuing lists of standard\ndefinitions and classifications to be used in household enquiries.\nComparisons of the definitions used in most recent house-\nhold surveys in our sample countries suggest that this stan-\ndardization and harmonization has not been achieved despite\nthe production of national and international documents spe-\ncifically outlining harmonized concepts (e.g., National\nThe 1964 United Nations Statistics Office document did\nrecognize that global diversity might present problems for\nstandardized approaches:\n--problems of application of household definition in \"under-\ndeveloped\" countries \"where variations from the so-called\n`normal' family structure are present\" . . .\n--in such circumstances, application of the recommended\ninternational definition of a household requires care. (United\nOne assumes that \"normal family structure\" referred to\nnuclear families, themselves now considerably eroded in\nmany contexts where they might once have been considered\nUN documentation recognizes the problems the standard-\nization enterprise has set in Africa, especially with respect to\nsurvey data collection, as surveys cover diverse issues for\nwhich different definitions may be more appropriate.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether it is expected that\nrespondents should be reconfigured to make them fit with the\ndefinition, as in Uganda, or the definition should be used\nflexibly to be able to match local conditions, as in Senegal.\nConclusion\nA number of themes emerge from this investigation of the\nrole of UN guidelines in determining the collection of census\ndata in Africa.\nThere is a temporal transformation with early postinde-\npendence censuses preoccupied with a complete enumera-\ntion of the population and avoiding double counting and\nomissions. The units of data collection reflected this, and\nutilization of local terminology or very strict de facto\napproaches were strategies used to do the best \"counting\"\noperation possible. Being able to undertake a competent and\nexhaustive census was seen as an essential part of the mod-\nern state. Issues of comparability or sophisticated analysis of\nthe nature and structure of the units for which data were col-\nlected were largely ignored.\nUN guidelines in the census documentation of individual\ncountries, the use of \"household,\" and the reiteration of UN\nnotions of household became more important. However, a\nmajor problem arose, and persists, because of ambiguity in\nthe UN definition of household and the fact that it referred to\nthree criteria: residence, housekeeping, and provision of food.\nDifferent countries have emphasized these criteria in different\nways, and in some, the provision of food has been reduced to\nthose eating out of the same cooking pot (e.g., Uganda); this\nis a minimalist interpretation of the UN requirements of \"pro-\nvision of food\" which may, when applied strictly, split basic\nsocioeconomic units into smaller components because of\nsocial diversity in eating behaviors. Other countries integrate\nconcepts into their definitions, which are not mentioned in the\nUN but are seen as locally important like \"answer to one\nhousehold head.\" In Burkina Faso, the continued restriction\nof census households to one married couple is a further elabo-\nration away from the UN guidelines.\nSenegal stands out as a nation with confidence in its own\nstatistical collection and approaches. Even after adopting the\nUN terminology of household (m\u00e9nage), the instructions\nretained local language terms, an approach abandoned else-\nwhere in Africa after the 1960s and which probably explains\nthe consistently larger household sizes observed in\nSenegalese census and survey data compared with other\ncountries The structure of Senegalese data collection retains\nthis independence with many surveys retaining the idea of\n\"noyaux\" and the census returning to it.\nThis article aimed to provide a historical account and\nanalysis of the changing relationships between individual\nAfrican countries, their national data collection activities,\nand the United Nations through the lens of the definition of\nhousehold. It is beyond the scope of the research reported on\nhere to determine the extent of repercussions of these defini-\ntional evolutions on policy. Furthermore, as policies should,\nin theory, be based on a triangulation of diverse data sources,\nas well as be driven by political strategies, it would be of\ngreat concern if definitions alone could be shown to have\ndirectly influenced policies. Nevertheless, the indicators\ngenerated from census and survey data can be powerful tools\nin orienting development initiatives. Cross-national compar-\nisons are increasingly used in the tracking of development\ngoals. If analysts and policy makers are not clear about the\ndifferent ways in which the same terminology household is\noperationalized and applied in different settings, then the\nquality of such comparisons is undermined.\nCensus households matter beyond facilitating the enumera-\ntion of individuals because, increasingly, research and policies\ndo not focus on the characteristics of individuals but on the\ncharacteristics of the social units within which they live. This\nfocus is demonstrated in the Republic of Kenya Strategic Plan\n\"The household is central to the development process. Not\nonly is the household a production unit but it is also a con-\nsumption, social and demographic unit\" (Kenya, 2003, p. 59),\nwith similar phrases echoed elsewhere. If interventions are\nfocused on the \"household\" units for which policy makers\nhave data, the characteristics of those households become\nimportant. Thus, wherever the definition influences the char-\nacteristics of the household, there will be repercussions for the\nconclusions drawn from analyses of those characteristics. Two\nexamples illustrate this: The first constitutes analyses that\nfocus on the characteristics of the household head and its asso-\nciation with, or influence on, the well-being or characteristics\nof different members: Such analyses could provide informa-\ntion on the sorts of households where children are more or less\nlikely to be schooled, or those identified as economically or\nsocially vulnerable such as female-headed households. In the\nlatter case, definitions that depend primarily on cooking pot\norganization will often lead to high frequency of female-\nheaded households in regions where polygamy is widespread\nand where polygamous wives cook separately such as Maasai\nareas of Kenya and Tanzania (Kenya, 2005; Randall & Coast,\n2015). A second example draws on analyses that focus on the\nsize and structure of households: Analyses of census data such\nas Ruggles and Heggeness's (2008) work on intergenerational\ncoresidence in developing countries are particularly sensitive\nto household definitions. Burkina Faso was not part of that\nstudy, but the fact that in census data Burkinabe elderly mar-\nried couples are, by definition, separated into different house-\nholds whether they eat or live together with offspring, would\nhave given an erroneous picture of intergenerational coresi-\ndence. Analysis of both household size and proportion of\nfemale-headed households for our study countries did demon-\nstrate quite considerable difference between the results gener-\nated by the census definition and those of surveys (Golaz,\nAntoine, Randall, & Coast, 2012). A focus on the living\narrangements of older people is becoming an important dimen-\nsion of evaluating welfare and, as highlighted in a recent\nreview of the SAGE study in Ghana \"the social opportunities\nand challenges of the evolving living arrangements in Ghana\nwill be worthy of consideration in national policy discussions\"\n(Biritwum et al., 2013, p. 11). Policy makers are interested in\nwhat analysis of living arrangements reveals, and these analy-\nses are sensitive to household definitions.\nA number of tensions emerge: between the requirement for\ncomparability over time and space (recognized by all docu-\nmentation in all countries) and the need to accommodate\nchanging social contexts (urbanization etc.) and diverse forms\nof social organization; the desire to do the best data collection\npossible, which in the census means enumerating everyone\nonce and once only; and the national recognition that this may\nnot be achievable through using the UN definition of house-\nhold. The fundamental tension seems to be that of applying a\nconcept of household that remains largely Eurocentric and\norganized around complete enumeration where most house-\nholds are composed of small nuclear families or fragments of\nthem, to the rather different and dynamic living arrangements\nin much of Africa. Different nations have chosen different\napproaches. In some cases, the UN definition is adopted (and\nslightly modified) and these households become the some-\nwhat alien statistical category just used for data collection\n(Uganda), whereas others, like Senegal have forged their own,\nmore independent pathway. The increased power of computer-\naided data collection, entry, and processing means that simul-\ntaneously collecting and organizing both standardized,\ninternationally comparable data, and locally defined and rele-\nvant data on the ways in which people live should be possible,\nand is desirable for policy makers and researchers alike.\nAppendix\nCountry Definitions of Household and Guidelines\nBurkina Senegal Tanzania Uganda\nA household is a group of persons\nwho live together and share their\nliving expenses.

The\nfollowing constitutes a household:\n(i) A household may consist of one person\nwho lives and eats on his or her own.\n(ii) A household may consist of several\npersons who are not related to each\nother.

The family nucleus is the smallest possible family unit. It is made up of\nwives (or a wife) and their direct, unmarried descendants, that is to say parents and unmarried children. These people must live together in the same compound. By extension,\nthe same family nucleus can include the husband, several spouses, and their children provided they live in the same compound. Furthermore the same nucleus can include\ndirect ascendants (mother of the head of the family nucleus), brothers and sisters, and close unmarried kin (nephews, nieces, etc.) provided they live with the head of the family\nnucleus and themselves have no unmarried children in the compound.\ncThe basic socioeconomic unit in which different members, related or not, live together in the same house or compound, pool their resources, and jointly meet their needs for\nfood and other items of daily living. Some examples of households:\n\u00b7 Every married man, with his wife and unmarried children constitutes a separate household.\n\u00b7 Each child of a man, with his wife(ves) and children make up a separate household even if they cohabit in the same house or compound and jointly meet their needs for\nfood and other items of daily living.\n\u00b7 Any person, male or female, who lives alone and provides for himself or herself forms a separate household, and so on.\ndThe household is the group of people, related or not, who live in the same compound, eat their daily meal together, and recognize the authority of a single person called the\nhousehold head. This concept is equivalent to \"ndieul\" in Wolof, \"ngank\" in Serer, and \"hirande\" in Toucouleur. If someone lives in the compound and eats with a household\nin that compound, you should record him or her in that household. If he or she lives outside the compound but eats with a household, he or she should not be counted in that\nhousehold. Furthermore, if a person lives alone and eats alone, he or she should be recorded as a distinct single person household.\nThe compound is a group of buildings enclosed (or not) by a wall or fence . . . by residence we mean \"usually living in a place for a certain length of time.\" For the 1988 census,\nthis place is the compound and the duration of residence is 6 months.\neThe basic socioeconomic unit in which members can be related or not. They live together in the same house or compound and jointly meet their needs for food and the\nmajority of other items of daily living. They usually recognize the authority of one of the household members who is the household head, whatever their sex.\nNB: In compounds or houses occupied by parents and their married children, you must count the parents as a separate household from the household of their married\nchildren: Each married child, his wife(ves), and unmarried children make up a different household. However, if just one parent depends on their married child, they belong to his\nhousehold.\nfA group of people, related or not, who live together under the same roof and jointly or partly pool resources to meet their basic needs, notably housing and food. These\nhousehold members usually eat together and all recognize the authority of a single household head. In our national languages, the terms nj\u00ebl in Wolof, ngank in Serer, hirande in\nPulaar, and siitik in Joola are accurate translations of the concept of household.\nAppendix (continued)\n"
