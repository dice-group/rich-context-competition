Arch Intern Med. 2001;\nWhen Physicians Counsel About Stress:\nResults of a National Study\nThe prevalence of stress in primary care is high;\n60% to 80% of visits may have a stress-related\ncomponent.1 Over the past 5 years, 44% of\nAmericans have reported an increase in psychological\nstress.2 Stress is associated with more office visits and\ndisease, but little is known about stress management\ncounseling in primary care.3,4 Our study objective was\nto examine the rates of stress management counseling\nby US primary care physicians and to identify associ-\nated factors.\ntional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a\ncross-sectional, multistaged, stratified sampling survey\nof randomly selected, office-based physicians in the United\nsicians (average response rate, 60.4%).5 We examined of-\nfice visits, which included stress management counseling\nprovided by a primary care physician. Stress manage-\nment was defined as \"information intended to help pa-\ntients reduce stress through exercise, biofeedback, yoga,\netc\" and included physician counseling at the visit and\n\"referrals to other health professionals for the purposes\nof coping with stress.\"5 Our final sample consisted of\nWe conducted weighted analyses using SAS-callable\nSUDAAN (version 10.0; SAS Institute Inc) to account for\nthe multistaged probability design, clustering of pa-\ntients by physician, and oversampling of selected phy-\nsician practices used by NAMCS. Potential correlates of\nthe provision of stress management counseling by\nprimary care physicians were (1) patient demographic\ncharacteristics (age, sex, race, education, income, re-\ngion, insurance status, and survey year) and (2) visit char-\nacteristics (physician specialty, visit continuity, visit acu-\nity, number of chronic conditions, number of visits, visit\nlength, and diagnosis). Multivariable logistic regression\nmodeling identified those factors independently associ-\nated with physician counseling about stress.\nfice visits (3%) included stress management counseling\nby primary care physicians. Stress management coun-\nseling was the least common type of counseling, com-\npared with counseling about nutrition (16.8%), physi-\ncal activity (12.3%), weight reduction (6.3%), and tobacco\nAdjusted multivariable analyses identified factors in-\ndependently associated with physician counseling about\nstress (Table). Older patients (age 65 years) were 39%\nless likely to be counseled, while patients living in the\nNortheast were 63% more likely to be counseled. Coun-\nseling was 43% more likely for patients being seen for a\nchronic problem flare-up. Counseling increased with the\nnumber of chronic conditions. Physicians were more likely\nto counsel patients with a depressive disorder. Finally,\ncounseling was associated with longer visits.\nComment. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to\nexamine factors associated with the provision of stress\nmanagement counseling by US primary care physicians\nusing a nationally representative sample. The low rate\nof counseling points to potential missed opportunities,\nsuggesting that physician counseling about stress has not\nbeen incorporated into primary care to the extent of other\ntypes of counseling.\nAs the number of chronic conditions increased, so did\nthe receipt of stress counseling, especially in patients seen\nfor flare-ups of existing conditions. This is expected, since\nTable.

This care pattern implies that\ncounseling is being offered downstream, rather than as\na preventive measure, similar to physician counseling\nabout other therapeutic lifestyle changes.6\nOf the conditions we studied, only depression was as-\nsociated with counseling. The pervasiveness of depres-\nsion in primary care has led to primary care being de-\nscribed as the \"hidden mental health system.\"7 In addition,\nstress has been linked to both the initial diagnosis and\nclinical course of depression.4 Our findings suggest that\nwhile primary care physicians are aware of the links be-\ntween stress and depression, the role that stress may play\nin other nonmental health conditions may be less well\nrecognized.\nWe also found stress management counseling to be\nassociated with longer visits. This is consistent with other\ntypes of counseling in primary care, and prior studies cite\nlack of time as a key obstacle preventing counseling about\nstress.1,8 Emerging models of primary care may address\nphysicians' concerns of time by using nonphysician health\ncoaches and health educators and using interventions such\nas group sessions and communication by e-mail or tele-\nphone, which may facilitate a greater incorporation of\ncounseling into clinical care.9\nThe low rate of counseling we found is not unique to\ncounseling about stress, since rates of physician coun-\nseling are suboptimal across most therapeutic lifestyle in-\nterventions.6 Physicians may recognize the need for pro-\nviding counseling, but the low rate points to broader\ndelivery issues in primary care.
