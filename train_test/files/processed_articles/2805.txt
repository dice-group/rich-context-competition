This study uses\ncompare decline in the neighborhood poverty gap between blacks\nand other Americans with decline in the residential segregation of\nblacks. We find that both declines resulted primarily from narrow-\ning differences between blacks and whites as opposed to narrowing\ndifferences between blacks and Hispanics or blacks and Asians.\nBecause black\u00adwhite differences in neighborhood poverty declined\nmuch faster than black\u00adwhite segregation, the neighborhood pov-\nerty disadvantage of blacks declined faster than black segregation--\na noteworthy finding because the narrowing of the racial gap in\nneighborhood poverty for blacks has gone largely unnoticed. Fur-\nther analysis reveals that the narrowing of the gap was produced by\nchange in both the medians and shapes of the distribution of pov-\nerty across the neighborhoods where blacks, whites, Hispanics, and\nAsians reside.\nneighborhood poverty | residential segregation | racial inequality |\nGini index\nNon-Hispanic blacks (hereafter \"blacks\") generally live in\npoorer neighborhoods than other Americans. In metropol-\nitan areas in 2010, for example, blacks were nearly four times\nmore likely than other residents to live in neighborhoods where\nthe poverty rate was 40% or higher. The racial divide persists\neven when comparing households of the same income (1). One\nstudy finds that the average black household with annual earn-\nings of $75,000 resides in a higher-poverty neighborhood than\nthe average white household with annual earnings of less than\n$40,000 (2). However, racial differences in neighborhood envi-\nronments were even greater in the past (3). In this article, we\ndocument a significant narrowing of the black\u00adnonblack gap in\nneighborhood poverty levels since 1980 and compare that de-\ncline with the decline in black residential segregation over the\nsame period.\nThe residential clustering of rich and poor in America is\nimportant because of the diminished life chances for residents\nof high-poverty neighborhoods (4, 5). In addition to more noise\nand congestion and the absence of green space, high-poverty\nneighborhoods in America often are characterized by poor\nschools, reduced access to healthy food, high crime rates, and\nweak social institutions. Sizable neighborhood inequality is\nparticularly troubling when high neighborhood poverty is as-\nsociated with race (6). If exposure to poverty adversely affects\nchild development and educational attainment, as recent re-\nsearch suggests (7\u00ad11), then disparities in the neighborhood\npoverty environments of blacks versus more advantaged groups\nmay be an important factor in the persistence of racial in-\nequality across generations (12).\nThe term \"black neighborhood disadvantage\" is used in this\narticle as shorthand for the difference in poverty rates of the\nneighborhoods where blacks and other Americans live. Although\nblack neighborhood disadvantage requires black residential\nsegregation--blacks and nonblacks cannot be unequally distrib-\nuted across rich and poor neighborhoods unless they are unequally\ndistributed across neighborhoods--the neighborhood disadvantage\nof blacks need not change at the same rate, or even in the same\ndirection, as black residential segregation. This study compares\nthe two trends and quantifies the contributions of black\u00adwhite,\nblack\u00adHispanic, and black\u00adAsian neighborhood change to overall\nchange in the segregation and neighborhood disadvantage of\nblacks in metropolitan America.\nThe findings advance our understanding of how racial neigh-\nborhood segregation and inequality have been changing in\nAmerica. By using a common metric for neighborhood segre-\ngation and inequality, we show that the neighborhood disad-\nvantage of blacks has declined faster than the neighborhood\nsegregation of blacks, and by applying a decomposition method,\nwe show that black disadvantage declined faster than black\nsegregation primarily because of trends for blacks vis-\u00e0-vis\nwhites, as opposed to blacks vis-\u00e0-vis Hispanics or Asians. Fur-\nther analysis reveals that the decline in black neighborhood\ndisadvantage was due to changes in the shapes as well as in the\nmedians of the race-specific neighborhood poverty distributions.\nChange in the Neighborhood Poverty Disadvantage of\nIn America, neighborhoods are where the nation's economic\ncleavages are most visibly \"etched in place\" (13). Neighborhood\nconditions historically have been particularly harsh for blacks, as\ndepicted in Fig. 1. The Lorenz curve (14) in Fig. 1 is constructed\nby arranging the 57,370 US metropolitan neighborhoods (census\ntracts) from poorest (highest poverty rate) to least poor based on\nSignificance\nRacial inequality in America persists in part because of racial\ndifferences in exposure to adverse neighborhood environments.\nBlacks in particular are significantly more likely than other\nAmericans to live in high-poverty neighborhoods--neighbor-\nhoods characterized by poor schools and limited access to\nhealthcare, jobs, and beneficial social networks--resulting in\ninequality of opportunity, as life chances are diminished for\nresidents of such neighborhoods. In addition, the greater expo-\nsure to crime, noise, and congestion implies a lower quality of\nlife, on average, for black Americans. Because black neighbor-\nhood disadvantage results in inequality of life chances based on\nrace, it is important to determine the direction, pace, and sources\nof change in black\u00adnonblack differences in neighborhood pov-\nerty in America.\nAn earlier version of this work was presented at Nuffield College, Oxford, January 27, 2016.\nAuthor contributions: G.F. designed research; G.F. and F.A. performed research; G.F. and\nF.A. contributed new analytic tools; G.F. and F.A. analyzed data; and G.F. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\nData deposition: The dataset used in this analysis has been archived in the Interuniversity\nConsortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan.

The curve plots the cumulative proportion\nof blacks in the neighborhoods (x axis) by the cumulative pro-\nportion of nonblacks in the neighborhoods (y axis), where non-\nblacks consist of Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites.\nIf blacks and nonblacks were distributed equivalently over rich\nand poor neighborhoods, 10% of each group would reside in\nthe poorest 10% of neighborhoods, 20% of each group in the\npoorest 20% of neighborhoods, and so on, coinciding with the\ndiagonal line of equality in Fig. 1. Instead, the Lorenz curve lies\nwell below the line, reflecting a high concentration of blacks in\npoorer-than-average neighborhoods.\nThe degree of black neighborhood disadvantage is quantified\nas the difference between the Lorenz curve and the line of\nequality. There are two standard ways to measure this difference.\nThe first, the index of dissimilarity (D), measures the difference\nas the vertical distance between the curve and the line of equality\nat its greatest point. The second, the Gini coefficient (15), is the\nproportion of the area below the diagonal that falls within the\ncurve (the shaded area in Fig. 1). Both indexes range in value\nfrom zero (no black disadvantage) to 1.0 (all blacks live in poorer\nneighborhoods than all nonblacks). We use the Gini in our\nanalysis because it is based on information for the entire distri-\nbution and is decomposable (Table 1) whereas D is based on a\nsingle point on the Lorenz curve and is not decomposable.\ndifferences in the neighborhood poverty rates for blacks and other\nexample, indicating that in 1980 only 7.7% of nonblacks lived in\nneighborhoods where the poverty rate was as high as or higher\nthan where the typical (median) black lived. By 2010, this figure\nhad increased from 7.7 to 22.5% and the Gini had declined to\n0.39. To understand how this reduction in black neighborhood\ndisadvantage came about, note that the Lorenz curve--and thus\nits associated Gini--is a population-weighted average of the black\u00ad\nwhite, black\u00adHispanic, and black\u00adAsian Lorenz curves (for a figure\nshowing the three Lorenz curves, see Fig. S1).\nderives from change in the three constituent Ginis plus change\nin the population composition of the nonblack population.\nFormally, let the black\u00adnonblack Gini at a point in time be\nexpressed as G = \nP\ni\npi\n Gi, where i indexes the nonblack group\nof interest, pi\nis the proportion of the nonblack population in that\ngroup, and Gi\nis the Gini value for that group vis-\u00e0-vis blacks.\nThen change in the black\u00adnonblack Gini from time 1 to time 2 is\n=\nX\ni\n\nGi\n\u00de +\nX\ni\n\u00de\npi\nwhere \nGi\n\u00de=2, the average value of Gi at times 1 and\npi\nis the average proportion at times 1 and 2.

To separate out the interactive effect of\nchange in G and change in p, we weight by the initial (instead of\nthe average) values of G and p:\n=\nX\ni\n\u00de +\nX\ni\n\u00de\n+\nX\ni\n\u00de.\nWe are not aware of prior work that has decomposed change in\ninequality by partitioning the Gini in this manner.\nTable 1 reports the additive and interactive components of the\nThere are two critical findings. The first is that black\u00adnonblack\nneighborhood inequality declined by 40% based on the Gini,\nto 0.29). Although blacks today are still much more likely than\nother Americans to live in high-poverty neighborhoods, there has\nbeen a sizable narrowing of the black\u00adnonblack neighborhood\npoverty gap since 1980. The second critical finding is that the\nreduction was driven primarily by the narrowing of neighborhood\npoverty rates between whites and blacks. Because whites con-\nstitute the majority of the nonblack population, the notable de-\ncline of 0.21 Gini units in black\u00adwhite inequality (Table 1) had a\nlarge compressing effect on black\u00adnonblack neighborhood in-\nequality, accounting for the large majority of the overall decline.\nChange in the composition of the nonblack population was the\nnext largest factor, accounting for about one-fourth of the de-\ncline. Change in black\u00adHispanic and in black\u00adAsian inequality\ncombined was responsible for only about 10% of the decline in\nblack\u00adnonblack neighborhood inequality.\nResidential segregation in America has been the subject of much\nresearch in the social sciences (6, 16\u00ad23). Black segregation has\nbeen a particular concern because of its magnitude and history.\nAs recently as 1980 the Gini coefficient for black\u00adnonblack resi-\ndential segregation in metropolitan America was 0.89 (D = 0.75),\nfar exceeding the degree of inequality in black\u00adnonblack neigh-\nFig. 1.

Decomposition of decline in black neighborhood\nComponent Change in Gini\nContribution\nAdditive Interactive\npopulation grew from 8.4 to 21.4%, and the Asian portion grew from 2.0 to\n7.3%. The additive model weights by the simple average of the group's\nmodel weights by the group's share of the nonblack population in 1980.\nThe general consensus among researchers--that the segrega-\ntion of blacks is high, and will remain so well into the future--\nwas called into question in 2012 by a highly publicized report\nproclaiming the approaching end of the residential segregation\nof blacks in America (24). Critics of the report argued that it\noverstated the decline in black segregation by, among other things,\nfailing to distinguish black Hispanics from African Americans\n(25). Most critics agree, however, that black residential segrega-\ntion is declining. From Table 1 we know that black\u00adnonblack\ndifferences in neighborhood poverty have diminished notably\nsince 1980. Using data from the same neighborhoods and applying\nthe same methods, do we arrive at the same conclusion about\nchange in black segregation?\nTo address this question, we reanalyzed the 57,370 metro-\npolitan neighborhoods, this time focusing on change in their\nracial composition. Because neighborhood segregation is a type\nof inequality--the unequal distribution of racial groups across\nneighborhoods--black segregation can be analyzed using the\nsame metric (Gini units) and the same tool (Gini decomposition)\nthat we used to analyze change in black neighborhood disadvan-\ntage. To directly compare black segregation with black disadvan-\ntage, we calculated segregation for the total US metropolitan\npopulation following the same procedure that we used to calculate\nblack disadvantage, which is best measured at the national level.\nFor metropolitan America as a whole, then, we compare the dis-\ntribution of blacks and nonblacks across neighborhoods (segrega-\ntion) with the distribution of blacks and nonblacks across rich and\npoor neighborhoods (disadvantage).\nThe Lorenz curve for segregation is formed by ordering neigh-\nborhoods based on the percentage of residents who are black, from\nhighest to lowest, and plotting the cumulative proportion of blacks\nin the neighborhoods (x axis) by the cumulative proportion of\nnonblacks (y axis) (26). If every US neighborhood had the same\nproportion of blacks--complete black integration--the Lorenz\ncurve would coincide with the diagonal line of equality. Fig. 2 dis-\nplays the Lorenz segregation curves for US metropolitan areas in\nhigh levels of black residential segregation both years. For example,\n1980 half of the black population resided in neighborhoods that\nwere home to less than 1% of the nonblack population.\nThe Lorenz curve for 2010 is closer to the line of equality,\nindicating that black segregation has moderated somewhat since\nGini units (from 0.89 to 0.76), as indicated by the shaded area in\nFig. 2--well short of the 0.26 Gini unit decline in black\u00adnonblack\nneighborhood inequality over the same period. Fig. 3 displays the\nsources of this difference by comparing the decomposition of the\ndecline in black\u00adnonblack segregation (Table 2) with the de-\ncomposition of the decline in black neighborhood disadvantage\n(Table 1). The critical finding is that black neighborhood dis-\nadvantage declined more than black segregation primarily be-\ncause the decline in black\u00adwhite disadvantage greatly outpaced\nthe decline in black\u00adwhite segregation and secondarily because\nchange in the racial/ethnic composition of the nonblack pop-\nulation affected inequality more than it affected segregation. The\nchanging residential circumstances of Asians and Hispanics rel-\native to blacks, on the other hand, accounted for very little of the\nfaster decline in black neighborhood disadvantage.\nWe also compared black segregation with black neighborhood\ndisadvantage within each of the four major regions of the country\nto determine whether we would find the same pattern of results\nacross regions with different population composition (blacks\ncomprise about 20% of the population in the South, for instance,\nbut only 6% in the West). Regional changes in fact mirrored\nchanges at the national level. In every region, black disadvan-\ntage diminished faster than black segregation, and in every in-\nstance, this finding was largely due to changes in the poverty\nrates and racial compositions of the neighborhoods where\nblacks and whites (as opposed to Hispanics or Asians) lived. As\none would expect, Hispanic\u00adblack change had a greater impact\non change in black disadvantage and segregation in the West,\nwhere Hispanics constitute a larger share of the nonblack\npopulation. Hispanic\u00adblack change nonetheless accounted for\nvery little of the faster decline in black disadvantage in the West\nbecause the decline in Hispanic\u00adblack segregation nearly kept\npace with the decline in the neighborhood disadvantage of\nblacks relative to Hispanics (Fig. S2).\nFig. 2. Lorenz curves showing decline in black neighborhood segregation\nFig. 3. Decline in black segregation versus decline in black neighborhood\nChanges in the Distribution of Neighborhood Poverty by\nRace: Median Shifts and Shape Shifts\nAlthough blacks on average still live in the poorest neighborhoods,\nthey live in relatively better neighborhoods vis-\u00e0-vis nonblacks in\nnarrowing differences in the poverty rates of neighborhoods where\nblacks and whites live. In this section, we use relative distribution\nmethods (27) to compare change in the distribution of neighbor-\nhood poverty directly for blacks versus whites, blacks versus His-\npanics, and blacks versus Asians. We focus on change in the\noverlap of the distributions because increasing overlap means\ndeclining black disadvantage. Relative distribution methods ac-\ncount for change in the overlap of two distributions by separating\nthe contributions of median shifts from the contributions of shape\nshifts. The method enables us to determine, for example, how\nmuch of the decline in black\u00adwhite neighborhood disadvantage is\ndue to convergence in the median neighborhood poverty rate for\nblacks and whites and how much is due to changes in the shapes of\nthe two distributions.\nFrom the declines in inequality observed in Table 1, we know\nthat there is greater overlap in the black\u00adwhite, black\u00adHispanic,\nWhich distributions moved, and in what direction? Table 3 pro-\nshift in the black distribution, toward lower poverty neighborhoods,\nand a rightward shift in the distribution for each of the other\ngroups, toward poorer neighborhoods. Blacks, then, were the only\nmajor population group in metropolitan America who were living\nthe difference in median neighborhood poverty rates declined by\n4.6 percentage points for blacks and whites, by 5.0 percentage\npoints for blacks and Hispanics, and by 4.4 percentage points for\nblacks and Asians. These median shifts are likely to account for\nmuch of the decline in the neighborhood disadvantage of blacks.\nBlack neighborhood disadvantage might also have been di-\nminished by shifts in the shapes of neighborhood poverty dis-\ntributions. The effects of shape shifts depend on the location as\nwell as the size of the shifts. Shape shifts are most consequential\nwhere the two distributions being compared overlap the most.\nFor whites and blacks, for example, whites' shape shifts have the\ngreatest effect when they occur in the neighborhoods where poverty\nrates are above average for whites, where there is the greatest overlap\nwith prevailing neighborhood poverty rates for blacks.\nFigs. 4\u00ad6 show the neighborhood poverty distribution for blacks\nrelative to the distributions for whites (Fig. 4), Hispanics (Fig. 5),\nof the black neighborhood disadvantage with respect to each of\nthe other racial/ethnic groups. The convergence is particularly\nnotable for blacks and Hispanics. If those trends continue, in the\nnear future Hispanics will tend to live in poorer neighborhoods\nthan blacks.\nClose inspection of the figures reveals the median shifts\nreported in Table 3--the leftward shift of the black distribution\nand the rightward shift of the distributions for whites, Hispanics,\nand Asians. More obvious, however, is the \"flattening\" of the curves\nfor whites, Hispanics, and Asians. For whites especially, the peak of\nthe curve declined notably, and the right (higher poverty) tail en-\nlarged. Because the distributions for whites, Hispanics, and Asians\nall thickened in the regions of the curve where a large share of\nblacks reside, we expect to find that white, Hispanic, and Asian\nshape shifts all contributed to the decline in black disadvantage,\nindependent of median shifts. The shape of the black distribution in\nchange in the shape of the black distribution contributed little to the\ndecline in black disadvantage (except in the case of Hispanics,\nwhere a small shape shift for blacks is likely to be consequential due\nto the substantial overlap in the Hispanic and black distributions).\nTable 4 reports results using relative distribution methods to\nisolate the contributions of median shifts and shape shifts. As\nexpected, median shifts were responsible for much of the decline\nin black neighborhood disadvantage, accounting for about three-\nfourths of the black\u00adwhite decline, half of the black\u00adHispanic\ndecline, and two-thirds of the black\u00adAsian decline. For black\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis whites and Asians, the remainder of the\ndecline was due to the shape shift for whites and Asians, re-\nspectively--none was due to shape shift in the poverty distribu-\ntion for blacks themselves. Indeed, the shape shift effect for\nblacks is negative (but small) when blacks are compared with\nwhites, indicating that black neighborhood disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis\nwhites would have increased, not declined, had the distributions\nfor blacks and whites remained constant except for the shape of\nblacks' neighborhood poverty distribution. The decline in black\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis Hispanics was driven roughly equally by\nblacks' shape shift (28%) and by Hispanics' shape shift (25%).\nThis finding is not surprising, given the considerable overlap in\nthe neighborhood poverty distributions for blacks and Hispanics.\nFinally, there is a negative interaction effect for blacks and\nAsians, indicating that the joint effect of median shifts and shape\nshifts operated to reduce the magnitude of the decline in black\nneighborhood disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis Asians.\nTable 2.

This state of affairs\nraises the question of why, during a period of legal sanctions against\nhousing discrimination on the basis of race, black neighborhood\ndisadvantage has proved to be more tractable than black neigh-\nborhood segregation. As shown in this study, the principal source\nof the faster decline in black disadvantage than in black segre-\ngation is the greater black\u00adwhite convergence in neighborhood\npoverty rates than in neighborhood coresidence. Blacks have\nbecome less residentially disadvantaged primarily because of\ntheir diminished neighborhood poverty differences with whites,\nthe largest racial group in America. The narrowing of black\u00ad\nHispanic and black\u00adAsian differences matters much less for\neither black disadvantage or black segregation.\nThe findings of this study challenge three perceptions about\nthe racial stratification of America's neighborhoods. First, the\nend of black segregation is not at hand. As of 2010, the black\u00ad\nnonblack segregation Gini was 0.76, with half of the metropoli-\ntan black population living in neighborhoods that were home to\nonly 3.6% of the nonblack population. Clearly, the residential\nsegregation of blacks remains very high in America.\nSecond, in contrast to the view that blacks have become less\nsegregated largely because Hispanics and Asians have served as a\nbuffer between blacks and whites (28), we find that Hispanic\u00ad\nblack and Asian\u00adblack integration collectively accounted for only\nWhite\u00adblack integration, in contrast, accounted for about 72%\nof the decline. To be sure, white\u00adblack differences count more\nbecause whites outnumber Hispanics and Asians. However, that\nis the point: had white\u00adblack segregation not changed, the de-\ncline in the residential segregation of blacks between 1980 and\n2010 would have been only about one-fourth as large. That fact is\nnot easily deduced from patterns of mobility into or out of poor\nneighborhoods (29, 30) or from research on white flight from\nneighborhoods as blacks move in (31). It is difficult to infer ag-\ngregate neighborhood change from household migration (32),\nand only by directly decomposing the change in black\u00adnonblack\nsegregation do we discover that the decline in the residential\nsegregation of blacks in America has been driven primarily by\nreduction in the residential separation of blacks and whites.\nThird, the reduction in black segregation was not the most\nsignificant change in the racial stratification of America's\nmuch greater--although less noticed--narrowing of neighbor-\nhood poverty differences between blacks and other Americans in\ngeneral and between blacks and whites in particular.\nOur analysis reveals the sources of the narrowing neighbor-\nhood poverty gap between blacks and other Americans. We now\nknow that the decline in black disadvantage resulted primarily\nfrom the narrowing of the black\u00adwhite gap in neighborhood\npoverty. We also know how distributional changes produced the\ndecline in black disadvantage: shape shifts for whites, Hispanics,\nand Asians accounted for part of the decline in the relative\ndisadvantage of blacks, but a larger portion of the decline was\ndue to median shifts--lower neighborhood poverty rates for\nblacks and higher rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians. The\ngrowth in neighborhood poverty rates for whites squares with\ncensus reports showing a sharp increase in the number of poor\nwhites living in poor neighborhoods (33). The decline in neigh-\nborhood poverty for blacks is consistent with evidence of the\nmovement of blacks into middle-income neighborhoods (18, 34,\n35); when a growing middle class black population moves from\nlow income to middle income neighborhoods that are pre-\ndominantly black, black neighborhood disadvantage declines faster\nthan black segregation, in line with the findings here. The reasons\nfor these trends are only partly understood. It is likely that the\ngentrification of poor urban areas (36) and a softening of white\naversion to black neighbors (figure 3.5 in ref. 37) are responsible for\nsome of the reduction in black neighborhood disadvantage. The\nmovement of immigrant populations to new destinations (38, 39)\nmight have played a role as well.\nIn light of evidence that racial disparity in neighborhood eco-\nnomic conditions serves as a source of racial differences in life\nchances (8, 9), black neighborhood disadvantage undercuts the\nAmerican ideal of equality of opportunity. The Gini value for\nindicating that on average blacks still reside in significantly poorer\nneighborhoods than whites. A serious concern is that black\u00adwhite\ndifferences in wealth inequality (40)--inequality that itself is based\nto a large extent on racial differences in housing assets (41)--\nmight slow or halt further narrowing of the black\u00adwhite neigh-\nborhood poverty gap. With the high cost of housing, for example,\nintergenerational transfers are likely to become increasingly im-\nportant, so black deficiencies in home wealth today might make it\nversus Hispanics.\nversus Asians.\nTable 4.

There is no guarantee, then, that the\ndecline in black\u00adwhite neighborhood inequality will continue. Al-\nthough residential segregation dominates the headlines, the future\ndirection and pace of change in racial neighborhood inequality is\nlikely to have greater implications for American society.\nMaterials and Methods\nNeighborhood Data. When we ask whether blacks now live in neighborhoods\nthat are more economically similar to the neighborhoods where other\nAmericans live, we want to know about disparities in conditions for blacks\nand other Americans without regard to whether they live in Atlanta or\nDetroit or Los Angeles. By pooling the neighborhood data for all US met-\nropolitan areas, we compare the poverty rates of neighborhoods without\nregard to their metropolitan location. In line with many prior studies, we use\ncensus-defined tracts to measure neighborhoods. Census tracts are designed\nto be relatively homogeneous units with an optimum size of about 4,000. We\ndecennial censuses. Neighborhood poverty rate is the percentage of indi-\nviduals living below the poverty line, which we assembled from long-form\nAmerican Community Survey. To base findings on the same neighborhoods in\ndents live in group quarters (such as prisons), yielding a consistent set of\n57,370 neighborhoods for both years. Using census data for all places des-\nignated as \"metropolitan areas\" by the US Census Bureau captures 77% of\nbecause it is the first year with adequate census data for Hispanics. The\nfour major racial/ethnic groups in the analysis--Hispanics, non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Asians--comprise more than 97% of the\nUS population.\nMethods. This study provides a design for revealing the loci of change in the\nrelative gains or losses of population groups. The design combines Gini de-\ncomposition with relative distribution methods. Although there are various\nways to decompose inequality and segregation (43), the decomposition\nmethod introduced here identifies the group comparisons that matter most\nfor the relative gains or losses of one population (e.g., blacks) vis-\u00e0-vis another\n(e.g., nonblacks). Relative distribution analysis in turn identifies the distribu-\ntional changes--median shifts versus shape shifts--that account for the\nchange in a particular group comparison (e.g., blacks versus whites). Both\nmethods deepen our understanding of change in inequality between groups\nby pinpointing where the change is coming from--which subpopulations,\nand which parts of the distribution, are driving the change. By combining\nthe decomposition of Ginis with the decomposition of distributional change\nusing relative distribution methods, the analysis here provides a template\nfor future research investigating the relative gains and losses of groups.\n"
