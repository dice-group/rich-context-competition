Approximately 13 years\nafter this military buildup, this War is expected to be drawing\nto a close asAfghans will now take the primary role of security\n(Lila, 2013). Billions of dollars were spent in fighting the war,\nbut the effectiveness of this effort has not yet been accurately\nassessed.Although assessments have been accomplished, they\nare questionable in their reliability and validity (Downs-\nMartin, 2011). In addition, the analysis of data is limited and\nattempts to forecast (Downs-Martin, 2011). The complexity of\nassessing the Afghan War is founded in the fact that the U.S.\npopulation is hopeful. Spending record amounts on defense,\nthe U.S. population should be hopeful that they are \"buying\"\nsomething of value. Yet, as Downs-Martin (2011) argues, cur-\nrent assessments using past and present data to determine\nsome future accomplishment are dubious.\nIntroduction\nThis article focuses on assessing the military in combat oper-\nations in Afghanistan. To accomplish this, the military is\ndefined and a review of literature that quantifies and assesses\nmilitary operations in Afghanistan follows. This article then\ndiscusses the impact of the Afghan War on the Afghan people\nand offers evidence of the widespread impact the Afghan War\nhad on civilians.An analysis and discussion of enemy engage-\nments in Afghanistan follows and focuses on the casualties of\nwar as a measure of military effectiveness.\nThe Counter-Terrorism Industry's Purpose\nThe U.S. military in its current state, including the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), has established infrastruc-\nture that is far more advanced than the rudimentary infra-\nstructure necessary in late 2001. These resources come at\nan increasing cost. Advanced weapons, aircraft, surveil-\nlance systems, and other countless associated pieces of\nequipment are bought and paid for by the American people.\nTherefore, the American people have a right to know how\ntheir resources have been used. Such transparency is pur-\nported by some government officials, but others character-\nize the U.S. Government's transparency as being little more\nthan smoke and mirrors. Before an assessment can be made,\nthe definition and purpose of the military must be defined.\nThis may seem a simple task, but when one considers the\nvast array of military institutions, their operations, and\nthe public's perceptions of what the military should do, the\nmission of the military becomes less clear. This study will\nrefer to the U.S. Armed Forces as the \"military\" and reflect\nonly the decisions within the span of military commanders.\nThus, political forces and intent are not the focus of this\nassessment, but rather the actions and decisions of the U.S.\nArmed Forces.\n1University of New Haven, West Haven, CT, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJibey Asthappan, Director, National Security Studies, Assistant Professor\nin Criminal Justice, University of New Haven, 300 Boston Post Rd., West\nEmail: JAsthappan@newhaven.edu\nThe Cost of War: Weighing Civilian\nLosses in the Afghan War\nJibey Asthappan1\n Keywords\nWar on Terror, Afghan War, civilian losses, effectiveness of war, counter-terrorism\n2 SAGE Open\nThe Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States,\npublished in March 2013, defines the purpose of the armed\nforces as such:\nThe US Armed Forces fulfill unique and crucial roles, defending\nthe US against all adversaries while serving the Nation as a\nbulwark and the guarantor of its security and independence. The\nUS Armed Forces function within the American system of civil-\nmilitary relations and serve under the civilian control of the\nPresident, the Commander in Chief. The US Armed Forces\nembody the highest values and standards of American society\nand the profession of arms. (U.S. Army, 2013, p. i)\nToday's military is embroiled in a war far different than the\nwars that shaped the structure, culture, and traditions of the\nU.S. military. The men and women of the military are trained\nto survive and win under war conditions. Nation-building\nand community policing are not the primary objectives for\nwhich members of the military are trained. The objectives of\nmilitary basic training may be considered a clear representa-\ntion of what the military expects from members; they are a\nreflection of what leaders demand to be instilled in all ser-\nvice members. Although each branch of service in the U.S.\nMilitary (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines) differs by method\nand training needs, they do share many similar characteris-\ntics. Military training certainly emphasizes physical fitness,\nbut a large component of basic training is changing the way\nthe trainee thinks. Military ethics, values, discipline, and tra-\ndition ensure that trainees will obey commands and respect\nthe chain of command. Field training exercises (FTX) and\nrifle/handgun training both ensure that the trainee is prepared\nfor battle. FTX are designed to mimic austere war condi-\ntions. Trainees are required to perform military operations\nwith very little sleep. Rifle and/or handgun training ensures\nthat all trainees know how to fire a weapon with accuracy\nand maintain that weapon for reliable action. Military basic\ntraining serves a critical purpose: It ensures that the men and\nwomen of the military will behave as expected when war\noccurs. Military basic training does not emphasize human\nrights or government building. As one might expect, empha-\nsis is placed on killing while not being killed. Ethics such as\n\"service before self\" are an effort to inculcate the trainee to\nplace the greater good and mission success over that of indi-\nvidual needs. With such a mind-set, it should be of no sur-\nprise that military members have difficulty showing kindness\nto civilians of an enemy state. Military members are best\nsuited to be engaging with combatants.\nOften, entities outside of the military are tasked to facili-\ntate the efforts of the War on Terror. Agencies such as the\nDoD (apart from the military branches), Department of\nHomeland Security, Central IntelligenceAgency, Department\nof State, and the Department of Justice have fulfilled the mis-\nsion of the War on Terror and continue to do so. In addition,\ncontractors also provide a great deal of the manpower needed\nto fight this war. In fact, defense contractors outnumber\nMiller, 2007). Thus, any assessment must encapsulate the\nefforts of all these participating entities.\nAssessment\nAssessments should provide a data-driven method to inform\npolicymakers, government agencies, and the public of how\nwell resources are currently being utilized and inform deci-\nsions that alter resource allocation in an effort to improve effi-\nciency.Although the value of an assessment is rarely disputed,\nthe measures used in assessment are often criticized. The out-\nput of a war is generally nonlinear and measures to determine\nsuccess are often hidden and/or subjective. Political and eco-\nnomic measures have long been used to determine the effec-\ntiveness of the Afghan War. The results of these studies only\nserve to further cloud the true effectiveness of theAfghan War\nIf the goals of the Afghan War are to change the political\nclimate inAfghanistan, they have been met equally as well as\nthe goals of the Vietnam War. During that era, assessment of\nthe War endured a significant transition. Determining the\nvalue of assessment during military campaigns gained atten-\ntion during the Vietnam War when the Military Assistance\nCommand, Vietnam (MACV) and federal agencies in the\nUnited States expressed their dissatisfaction of techniques\nused to acquire and analyze data prior to the Hamlet\nEvaluation System (HES). The HES was a reaction to the\nlack of validity and reliability of data obtained by the MACV\nand the Vietnam government which included subjective data\nusing unreliable measures (Gayvert, 2010). The HES, started\nin 1967, was a concerted effort to collect political and insur-\ngency data at the hamlet rather than the village level in\nVietnam because it was a more accurate measure of the pop-\nulation (Gayvert, 2010). The HES was an effort to better\nassess how the campaign was truly changing the population\nat a time when U.S. government and population questioned\nthe effectiveness of the war. The granularity for the HES was\ncrucial because it was the hope of the American people that\ncommunist ideology would not take hold in Vietnam. Yet,\nthe ideology of the Afghan people is not the central concern\nof theAfghan War. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has made\nit clear that the purpose of the Afghan War was to combat al\nQaeda (Thompson, 2014). The Afghan security forces are\ntasked with continuing the pressure to keep al Qaeda at bay.\nIdeology of the people in Afghanistan is not an objective;\nthus, political measures may be an inconsistent measure.\nDowns-Martin (2011) argues that major flaws plague cur-\nrent methods of assessment. The flaws include the potential\nfor overoptimism when military members are asked to deter-\nmine whether operations are effective. As Downs-Martin\npoints out, overoptimism is a favorable characteristic of\nleadership as it encourages progress, but in assessment, it can\nproduce inaccurate results. Data collection, analysis, and\ndepiction of trends are also areas for improvement for cur-\nrent methods of assessment. Thus, data may be collected but\nAsthappan 3\nwithout consistency, appropriate analysis, and representa-\ntion; the results can be incomplete or misleading (Downs-\nMartin, 2011). In addition, assessments based on an end goal\nare particularly problematic in Afghanistan because the goal\nhas shifted during the span of the war and because political\nstability is difficult to assess considering the heterogeneous\ncomposition of Afghanistan (Downs-Martin, 2011).\nDowns-Martin (2011) argues that objective analyses of\nthe complex nature of terrorism and insurgency conducted\nin a time frame that is useful are highly unlikely and con-\ncludes that any \"operational/strategic counterinsurgency\nassessment in Afghanistan must be subjective\" (Downs-\nment that accounts for the total security situation is crucial\n(Cordesman, 2015). Ineffective measures and assessments\nbased only on hostile forces have resulted in short-sighted\ngoals (Cordesman, 2015). This study aims to assess opera-\ntional counterinsurgency operations using a cost-benefit\nanalysis of casualties. As crude as it may be, body count, or\ncasualties, may be one of the only measures that is rela-\ntively accurate and may be most useful in determining how\nwell operations are conducted.\nBody count is more complex than simply the number of\nterrorists that were killed. Casualties of friendly forces, non-\ncombatants, and civilians negatively affect populations\naround the globe. When a parent of a fallen military member\nis informed of his or her loss, the ensuing pain of that loss is\ndifficult to conceptualize. Although obvious, it is important\nto note that the pain of loss is no less for the Afghan people\nwho continue to endure losses as result of this war. This\nimpact on a population has the immense potential of chang-\ning the course of the War and, thus, the outcome of a cam-\npaign assessment.\nThe Afghan People\nThe deaths of innocent civilians caught in the middle of war\nmay be the greatest cost of the Afghan War. Shaw (2002)\nestimates the ratio of \"innocent Afghan\" civilians to\ninnocent casualties of war can be argued to be a negligible\nloss for one of two reasons. First, equal or greater losses\nwould have occurred without intervention. Second, the civil-\nians' losses are small compared with enemy losses.\nMany great military members and contractors were lost in\nthis War and that is a terrible price to pay, but those who\nserve know the danger of serving. When service members\nare deployed, there is no reason to believe they are out of\nharm's way; quite literally, they are putting themselves\ndirectly in harm's way. This in no way diminishes the loss of\ntheir lives, but their loss cannot be assumed as unforeseen.\nOn the other hand, the Afghan civilians have little choice but\nto attempt to survive the conflict. The Afghan people will see\nthe cost of war in their villages, government, and culture.\nUnlike military members, they are not being compensated\nfor the hazards they face. It is also questionable whether the\noutcome of the War will benefit them.\nIn a War fought with the awesome might of the United\nStates, Britain, France, and other superpowers, the Afghan\ncivilians are forced to withstand and survive as bystanders.\nThe greatest atrocities occur when children are killed by an\nunexploded ordnance or exposed to the toxins created when\nammunition having depleted uranium (DU) cores have been\nreported. Unexploded ordnances can leave children crippled,\ntinction of experiencing the highest number of casualties in\nthe world (Bilukha & Brennan, 2005). Data from the United\nNations Mine Action Center indicate that as the number of\ncasualties due to landmine detonations decreased, casualties\ncaused by unexploded ordnances increased. Moreover, the\nproportion of children being injured or killed by unexploded\nordnances increased; children accounted for 42% of all inju-\nries due to unexploded ordnances (Bilukha & Brennan,\n2005). Although the United States reports that no ammuni-\ntion having DU were being used in Afghanistan, the Afghan\npeople suggest they have been used and are the cause of\nincreased cancer rates and birth defects (Miraki, 2006). The\nuse of DU is not central to this study, but it does highlight a\nsubstantial and long term cost of the Afghan War.\nGhufran (2008) found that the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization's International Security Assistance Force\n(ISAF) was having difficulty reducing insurgent activities.\nIn addition, although many Taliban fighters have been\nkilled, this came at a high price in the form of civilian lives.\nGhufran identifies the dilemma of the Afghan War: Killing\nTaliban forces results in killing civilians and the killing of\ncivilians is counterproductive for the Karzi administration.\nCivilian deaths result in antigovernment and anti-U.S./\ncoalition sentiments. Moreover, the psychological and soci-\netal costs of the massive loss of life cannot be understated.\nSimilarly, war-stricken nations have reported high rates of\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 94% of children dis-\nplaced due to the conflict in Bosnia reported symptoms of\nPTSD (Bhutta, 2002). The widespread and staggering loss\nof life in Afghanistan is certainly detrimental to Afghan\nsociety, but it may also ensure that peace is less likely in the\nregion. Bhutta (2002) argues that PTSD results in a cycle of\nviolence. Figure 1 depicts operations in which enemies\nwere engaged in Afghanistan.\nFigure 1, derived from data from The Guardian, depicts\nthe widespread impact of operations inAfghanistan. Southern\nareas of Afghanistan have seen the greatest concentrations of\nenemy action operations, but many operations are scattered\naround the country. Benini and Moulton (2004) found an\n\"unequal distribution of civilian victims across local com-\nmunities\" (p. 405). Many communities have no civilian\nlosses, but a small portion has a great number of losses. Their\ndata were relegated to Operation Enduring Freedom and\ndoes not extend beyond 2003, but their findings seem to be\nsupported by the data in this study. Although operations in\n4 SAGE Open\nAfghanistan are widespread, certain regions have far more\nviolent action than others. To make the direct impact to the\npopulation more visible, Figure 2 depicts the population den-\nsity of Afghanistan. The data depicted in Figure 2 were\nacquired from The Guardian.\nAs is visible when comparing the enemy action map\n(Figure 1) and the population map (Figure 2), the southeast-\nern portion of Afghanistan has a great deal of both people\nand enemy action. Thus, a greater portion of people in these\nareas have been directly exposed to war. Although northern\nareas of Afghanistan are exposed to fewer enemy action\noperations and western areas of Afghanistan are not as popu-\nlated, it should be expected that the people of the area have\nhad some exposure to war, albeit indirect.\nWar is a life-altering event for any military member. Most\ncivilian Americans will never be exposed to war directly but\nmay be told stories of war by a family member or friend. These\nstories often depict heroic actions of service members defend-\ning the very freedom that most Americans take for granted.\nAfghan civilians will spend generations telling the stories of\nthe Afghan War. The most riveting and surviving stories will\nlikely be those of human tragedy. In 2009, the U.S. military\nclaimed a 28% reduction in civilian casualties due to a shift in\nstrategy that included a reduction in the number of air strikes\nin populated areas (Mullen, 2010). Yet, United Nations\nAssistance Missions in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that\ncivilian deaths increased by 14% in the same period (UNAMA,\n2010). The contrary findings between the U.S. Military and\nUNAMA may be a result of different data sources or proce-\ndures in obtaining data. During the Gulf War, military strategy\nattempted to reduce the number of civilian casualties and the\nimpact of destroyed targets on the civilian population; yet, it\nwas implementation that prevented the strategy from being\neffective (Knights, 2003). Pilots and targeteers continued to\nuse overwhelming destructive power that resulted in far more\nsuffering than intended (Knights, 2003). Leaked videos from\nconflicts in Afghanistan reflect the overwhelming use of force\non targets. Such evidence, despite the possibility that these\nincidents occurred infrequently, fuels a lack of confidence for\ninternational forces.\nDistrust and tension continue to be a concern between\nthe Afghan government and international military forces\n(Mullen, 2010). This distrust should be expected to be\nshared among the civilian population via informal social\nnetworks. Thus, for every misstep that American missions\ntake, generations of enumerable children will be told of\nthese atrocities and change the very culture, the very real-\nity that these individuals impart on themselves. For this\nreason, the global community has a right to know the\neffectiveness of military troops. The global community\nwill suffer the missteps of American and coalition troops\nfor generations to come.\nDespite the expectation that Afghans would view\nAmerican influence as negative, a 2010 study conducted by\nthe Asia Foundation found that 83% of Afghan respondents\nsee the introduction of Western values as positive (Rene,\nFigure 1. Operations in which U.S. forces engaged with the enemy.\nAsthappan 5\n2010). What complicates these optimistic results is that the\nAsia Foundation's survey results also indicate most Afghans\n(62%) feel that speaking negatively about the government is\nnot acceptable (Rene, 2010). In addition, corruption and nep-\notism have become rampant; this further deters the growth of\nthe nation and increases the potential for an ineffective gov-\nAs stated, assessment of operations in Afghanistan must\nbe a measure that has a quieting effect; that is, the measure\nmust be simple and objective. The most identifiable con-\nsumer of theAfghan War is theAfghan people, so any assess-\nment must include the impact to the population. In addition,\nthe Afghan people pay the greatest price of the War. Thus,\nthe cost and benefits most affect the Afghan people.\nAmericans and the U.S. government are interested in elimi-\nnating terrorists who target the United States and its interests.\nTherefore, the most direct method to measure success is to\ncompare the benefit, killing terrorists, against the cost, kill-\ning innocent civilians. Operations that kill or injure more ter-\nrorists than civilians are a simple yet effective measure of\nsuccess. TheAfghan War was and is more than simply killing\nterrorists; it is also considered to be a humanitarian effort.\nThus, a protection policy is inherent when one of the war's\ngoals is to help the Afghan people become and feel safe. In\nmeeting this goal, forces should identify those that are\ndirectly affected and develop ways to protect them (Bonwink,\n2006). Using data from U.S. operations in Afghanistan, this\nstudy aims to address the following research question:\nResearch Question 1: Do operations in Afghanistan pro-\nvide more good, in the form of killing more terrorists,\nrather than doing more harm by killing innocent civilians?\nThe following hypotheses will be tested:\nHypothesis 1: When engaged in operations involving\nenemy forces, civilians and friendlies are more likely to\nbe wounded or killed than enemies.\nHypothesis 2: When engaged in enemy operations,\nenemy forces are more likely to be killed.\nHypothesis 3: Over time, operations have become less\ndeadly for Afghan civilians.\nHypothesis 4: Killing or injuring more enemies relates to\nkilling even more nonenemies (civilians and friendlies).\nThese hypotheses are written such that finding no support\nfor Hypothesis 1 would indicate that Afghan War operations\nare less likely to kill civilians or that enemy operations are not\nrelated to the number of civilian deaths that occur. Support for\nHypothesis 2 would indicate that operations in Afghanistan\nare more likely to kill enemies. On the other hand, if results\ndo not support HA2, operations in Afghanistan were not\nFigure 2. Population density in Afghanistan.\n6 SAGE Open\neffective. Hypothesis 3 is focused on how good operations in\nAfghanistan have become in avoiding civilians over the\nof all operations between enemies and nonenemies (civilian\nand noncombat) is tested to address Hypothesis 4.\nMethod\nThe greatest cost of war is the loss of lives; it is also the\ngreatest benefit. Dead enemies represent the benefit and dead\ncivilians and friends (known as friendlies) represent the cost.\nThe deaths of the innocent and the enemy can be far-\nreaching; each in their own respect. The death of a terrorist\nmay act as a deterrent and could potentially stem further\nrecruiting of terrorists. A death of a civilian could feed an\nantiwar sentiment, promote the agenda of the terrorists, and\nresult in long-lasting societal costs.\nThus, in an effort to assess the success of military opera-\ntions in Afghanistan, this study utilizes open source data from\nThe Guardian on enemy and civilian casualties during com-\nbat operations. Prior to 2008, no assessment plan was put into\nplace, thus including data on operations during this time is\nvital. It is argued that enemy casualties represent the benefits\nof operations during the Afghan War because a ubiquitous\ngoal of the Afghan War has been to eradicate al Qaeda. The\ndeath of noncombatant and friendlies are considered a cost of\nwar. The data used in this study utilizes information reported\nculminate into a data set having 76,597 observations.\nVariables used in this study include the type of operation, year\nof the operation, the number of enemies killed, enemies\nwounded, civilians killed, civilians wounded, friendlies\nkilled, and friendlies wounded. To obtain a better understand-\ning of the cost of lives affected, the sum of wounded and\nkilled were calculated to obtain a total number of enemy casu-\nalties. In addition, the sum of killed and wounded from civil-\nian and friendlies were calculated to represent the innocent\nlives that were impacted due to the operation. Below are the\ndescriptive statistics for variables used in this study.\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 reports the number of incidents of each action when\nthe type of action was recorded. Enemy action events were\nally improvised explosive device incidents, occurred second\nof all incidents. Counter-Insurgency events occurred least\noften of known incidents; only .06% (n = 43) of the incidents\nwere of this variety. Together these incidents compose some\n74,159 operations/missions in which the U.S. Military\nengaged.\nTable 2 reports the descriptive statistics of data used in the\nempirical analysis. The unit of analysis is each incident.\nSome operations were not given a designation for the type of\noperation. In total, 76,911 incidents were recorded from\nof this study. Events that resulted in the killing or wounding\nof enemies can be considered successful engagements while\nincidents resulting in killed or wounded \"friendlies,\" hosts,\nand civilians are considered unsuccessful engagements. Of\nparticular importance is the number of innocent persons that\nwere killed or wounded in respect to the number of enemies\nthat were wounded or killed. An engagement may be consid-\nered successful if more enemies were killed/wounded than\ncivilians. Overall, incidents have an 11% chance of resulting\nin a killed or wounded friend. Civilians are more likely to be\nkilled or wounded; this occurs 17% of the time. Twenty-eight\npercent of incidents resulted in nonenemies being killed or\nwounded. On the other hand, enemies were killed or wounded\n22% of the time. The maximum number of enemies killed in\nany operation recorded is 181 persons. Sixty-seven civilians,\n27 hosts, and 16 friendlies were the maximum persons killed\nduring these operations.\nEmpirical Results\nHypothesis 1 sought to determine whether nonenemies were\nmore likely to be killed during operations when the enemy is\nengaged.Azero-inflated negative-binomial regression model\nis used instead of a Poisson regression model to account for\nthe zero-heavy count data. In addition, this regression model\nwas chosen over a negative-binomial regression model\nbecause zeros in this data represent significance rather than\nnothing. Zero losses during a military engagement is mean-\ningful, thus, the zero-inflated binomial model was chosen.\nCoefficients in these models are reported in incident rate\nratio (IRR). Negative relationships are demonstrated with\ncoefficients between 0 and 1. For example, an IRR of 0.5 can\nbe read as an increase of one unit in the independent variable\nwill result in a 2-unit decrease in the dependent variable.\nThe results, reported in Table 3, indicate that during oper-\nations in which enemies were confronted, nonenemies were\nTable 1. Military Engagement by Action.\nAction Incidents Percent\nAsthappan 7\nmore likely to be killed or wounded. With a p value of .012,\napproximately 7% more of a nonenemy is killed or injured\nwhen the operation targets an enemy. Stated another way, an\nadditional civilian is killed after approximately 14 enemy\nengagements. This loss is not dramatic, but it is significant.\nIn addition, the McFadden's R2 is moderately high (.561),\nindicating that 56.1% variation in the deaths of civilians is\nexplained by this type of operation.\nIn addressing Hypothesis 2, \"when engaged in enemy\noperations, enemy forces are more likely to be killed,\" a\nzero-inflated negative-binomial model is utilized again. The\nresult of this regression is reported in Table 4. The focus of\nthis regression is to determine whether engagements with the\nenemy are successful, that is, whether enemies being killed\nor wounded when the purpose of the operation is to kill ene-\nmies. The result of this regression indicates that enemies are\nslightly less likely (p = .002) to be killed during enemy\nactions when compared with all other incidents. Enemies are\nR2 is .576 indicating a moderately strong model in which\n57.6% of variation in number of enemies killed can be\nexplained by enemy action under a zero-inflated negative-\nbinomial model.\n5-year period. Over this time, it would be expected by most\nthat operations would become more effective. Gaining con-\ntrol of enemy territory and more accurate intelligence should\nresult in more effective engagements. Thus, the Hypothesis 3\nassumes that civilians are less likely to be killed or wounded\nas the years pass. As reported in Table 5, Model one's results\nare contrary to the assumption of fewer civilian losses.\nAfghan civilians could expect an increase of .04 of a life lost\nor a person wounded for every year that passes. To investi-\ngate this further, Models 2 and 3 report the number of addi-\ntional lives lost and people wounded, respectively. Model 2\nindicates that fewer Afghan civilians (IRR = 0.961) were\nkilled as the years passed, but Model 3 indicates that more\nAfghan civilians (IRR = 1.057) were wounded for every\nyear. McFadden's R2 values indicate moderately strong\nmodel fit for all three regressions.\nAlthough the numbers of nonenemy casualties are cer-\ntainly unwanted losses, the argument could be made that\nthose losses are necessary to kill or wound enemies. The\nfinal hypothesis in this study seeks to find the price of a\nnonenemy combatant paid in enemy combatants. The results\nof this regression assume that a nonenemy life is worth as\nmuch as an enemy life; it certainly could be argued other-\nwise, but setting one as being more valuable and to what\ndegree would be quite controversial.

As the table displays, for every\nenemy that was killed or wounded, 1,013 nonenemies were\nkilled or wounded. The result is significant (p = .000) and\nDiscussion\nIt has been said that every war has its casualties and every\nvictory its price. As the United States draws down troops\nfrom the Afghan region, it is difficult to find closure since no\nvictory or defeat has been evident. Results of this study are\nmixed but the results do not favor the conclusion that the\nmilitary has been very effective in killing more enemies than\ncivilians. To assess the military's effectiveness, four hypoth-\neses were tested, each centering on civilian and enemy\ncasualties.\nThe first hypothesis assumes that casualties, wounding or\ndeath, of civilians during an enemy confrontation would act\nas a disservice to the overall mission in Afghanistan. The\nresults indicated that, compared with all other operations,\ncivilians were more likely to become casualties during\nenemy action. Although this offers some insight into the\neffectiveness of engagements with the enemy inAfghanistan,\nit focuses only on the losses. Thus, Hypothesis 2 sought to\ndetermine whether enemies were also more likely to be killed\nor wounded when engaged. The results of the analysis indi-\ncate that enemies have a lower likelihood of being a casualty\nwhen U.S. troops directly engage the enemy.\nHypotheses 1 and 2 assumed that enemy action is of pri-\nmary concern when considering losses, thus Hypothesis 3\nwhether U.S. operations have become safer over time.\nResults of the three models that investigated this hypothesis\nfound that although the number of civilians killed decreased,\nthe number of wounded increased. The result is an overall\nincrease in the likelihood of a civilian casualty.\nAlthough the previous hypotheses shed some light on the\neffectiveness of military operations, a convincing argument\nremained unchallenged. That is, although civilian lives are\nlost, the number of enemies that are killed or wounded is\nassumed to compensate those losses. Put another way, the\nnumber of civilian losses were considered acceptable as long\nas an increased number of enemies were killed as a result.\nBecause making an assumption that a civilian or enemy life\nis worth more or less would be wrought with pitfalls, this\nstudy assumed that one enemy killed or wounded is worth\nthe same as one civilian casualty. The results of the final\nanalysis indicate that military operations kill or wound\nslightly more civilians than enemies. In any one operation,\nthis would be acceptable, but this is an analysis of nearly\nThe results of this study have indicated that between the\nmies to become casualties during operations in which the\nenemy is engaged. In addition, nonenemies have become\nslightly more likely to be wounded but slightly less likely to\nbe killed. Finally, the tradeoff between enemy and civilian\ncasualties favors the enemy. That is, in general, for every\nenemy casualty, more than one civilian is a casualty from\nU.S.-led military operations. The results of this study are a\nsobering reminder of the great losses in war. Assessment of\nthe military's effectiveness during the Afghan War could be\nsubjective, but the data and analyses used in this study are\npurposed to be objective. Assuming that the lives of the\nAfghan people are as valuable as those of terrorists/insur-\ngents, U.S. operations were not effective. Yet, this assump-\ntion should not be taken lightly. In the safe confines of an\noffice or home, many might argue in support of the humani-\ntarian perspective so evident in this article, but for the mili-\ntary members who fought this war, this perspective may not\nbe practical (Slim, 2003). Actors in the war must grapple\nwith their own perceptions of how much \"they\" are like \"us\"\n(Slim, 2003). Those who are spectators of the war may find\nit simple to partition enemies and civilians, but actors are\ncharged with deciding upon this partition in a moment when\ntheir own lives are in jeopardy.\nLimitations\nDetermining the effectiveness of complex systems can\nincite passionate arguments. This study sought to measure\nmilitary effectiveness using variables that are less subjec-\ntive: the casualties of war. Although simplistic, its purpose\nis to get to the heart of the problem; if U.S. Armed Forces\nare injuring or killing more innocent people than enemies,\nthose military operations cannot be considered effective.\nOn the other hand, other measures of effectiveness can be\nargued. Future research should seek more objective ways to\nmeasure military operations using a variety of definitions\nof effectiveness.\nData on military operations in current conflicts are diffi-\ncult to obtain. This researcher could only acquire data from\nlyzed regularly and these results should be shared with the\npublic. That is not to say that classified information should\nbe available to our enemy; instead, analysis in the aggregate\nshould be shared with the public. Future research should uti-\nlize a larger time span of data so that more accurate findings\ncan be established.\nAsthappan 9\nIn conclusion, it may be that the success or failure of the\nAfghan War can only be determined decades after U.S.\nForces leave the nation. Economic and political institutions\nthat serve the people remain to be fully developed and it\ncould take a significant number of years before that can be\naccomplished. Thus, the story of the country of Afghanistan\nmay have only just begun. In the future, U.S. operations\ncould be marked as the driving force for prosperous change\nor they could be identified as the entity that caused so much\nharm to the Afghan people. This study cannot assess how the\nAfghan War has changed and will continue to change lives,\nculture, and the world, but it does imply that the cost to the\nAfghan people exceeds the costs incurred by the enemy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBenini, A.
