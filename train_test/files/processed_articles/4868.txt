This change may range from\nminor deviations to drastic shifts away from an architectural norm and the accumulation of these shifts within a time frame\nconstitutes variations. This article focuses on identifying variations in the architecture of the Ijo fishing group that migrates\nalong the coastline of West Africa. It examines the causes of cross-cultural variation between base camp dwellings of Ijo\nmigrant fishermen in the Bakassi Peninsula in Cameroon and Bayelsa State in Nigeria. The study draws on the idea of the\ninevitability of cultural and social change over time as proposed in the theories of cultural dynamism and evolution.

He posits that changing conditions and\nvariability remain one of the major characteristics of vernac-\nular architecture. This is based on the concept of cultural\nchange, which emphasizes the dynamism of culture in every\ngiven society with time. In essence, the tendency to change\ndoes not only depend on external forces acting on it, but is\ninherent in any cultural system and affects all its forms of\nmaterial culture. The material culture being investigated here\nis vernacular architecture. Rapoport and Hardie (1991) argue\nthat for vernacular architecture, the process of culture change\nand associated changes to the built environment is dynamic,\nso that the problem is to identify persisting traditional ele-\nments, as well as disappearing, changing, or new elements in\nthe built environment. Based on this concept, architecture is\nsubject to change not only by external influences but also by\nits inherent tendency to do so.\nAs such, this article focuses on examining the extent to\nwhich migration facilitates external influences and acts as an\nagent of cultural change, bringing about architectural varia-\ntions in dwellings from the same society. The results of this\nresearch may not necessarily address the issue of change in a\nway that is applicable to all vernacular environments, but it\ncan contribute to overall knowledge by addressing it from\nthe culture-specific viewpoint of Ijo migrant fishermen.\nFrom a review on existing literature on variations in archi-\ntecture, certain gaps and paucity of research were identified.\nFirst, most of the studies on architectural variation are longitu-\ndinal or chronological studies from a mixture of anthropology,\narchaeology, and cultural geographical from an architectural\nviewpoint, focusing on change in a single community over\nactually examined the architectural variations of a group with\nthe same ethnic source but living in different locations due to\nthe few cases identified, the studies focused on analyzing\n1Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt,\nNigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nWarebi Gabriel Brisibe, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Department\nof Architecture, Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port\nEmail: briswares@yahoo.com\nBase Camp Architecture: Examining\nVariations in Fisher Dwellings in Nigeria\nand Cameroon\nWarebi Gabriel Brisibe1\n Keywords\nmigration, variations, Ijo fishermen, vernacular architecture, base camp\n2 SAGE Open\ndomestic space in relation to social change, using primarily\nqualitative methods to identify variations. But all three of\nthese previous studies fall short of investigating the causes of\nthese variations. Furthermore, only studies related to archaeol-\nogy employed the use of quantitative methods in analyzing\nthese architectural variations. This research is intended on tak-\ning a step further by investigating architectural variations and\ntheir causes, for which quantitative and qualitative methods\nhave been used.\n\"Fishermen Without Borders\"\nMigration is a common socioeconomic activity in the life-\nstyle of artisanal fishermen of Ijo ethnic origin. The Ijos are\none of 10 prominent migrant fishing tribes in the West\nAfrican subregion and the fourth largest ethnic group in\nNigeria. They migrate to different locations along the inshore\nrivers and coastline of Nigeria and even beyond. This has\ncontributed in spreading their population among other\nregions in Nigeria and Africa, although their ancestral home-\nland is in the central Niger Delta area of Nigeria.\nThese fishermen embark on two forms of migration: the\nfirst is an interregional and sometimes transnational form of\nmigration, where the fishermen relocate and become settlers\nin other geographic regions or countries; and second, an\nintersite or intraregional form of migration, where the fisher-\nmen carry out various short migratory or commuting trips\nwithin the region they choose to settle during different fish-\ning seasons in the year. Some scholars refer to them as \"inter-\nnational\" and \"internal\" migrations. Openness of the borders\nof the territorial waters between coastal countries in West\nand Central Africa were identified as the key factor that\nmakes such international migration possible (Njock &\nWestlund, 2008). In both forms of migration, residential\nmovement is involved. Often, one main dwelling along a\nriver route known as the base camp and a number of satellite\ndwellings in offshore and inshore waters are established.\nThe other parts ofAfrica where Ijo fishermen have migrated\nto include Benin republic (Olawepo, 2008); the Bakassi\nPeninsula and Littoral regions of Cameroon (N. B. Leis, 1964,\nP. E. Leis, 1972); the Lake Chad regions which border Nigeria,\nand the Republic of Chad; and the coastal regions of Equatorial\nGuinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo (Agoro, Asuk,\nFigure 1). However, this article is narrowed down to the com-\nparative analysis of the dwelling models in Bayelsa (Nigeria)\nand Bakassi (Cameroon) only as shown on the map in Figure\n2. Most of the current populations of Ijo fishermen in\nCameroon are descendants of these early settlers in Bakassi or\nother regions in the Sud Ouest Province.\nFishermen and Migration in Nigeria\nThe term migrant fisherman was developed in Nigeria dur-\ning the early 1980s as research interests in coastal and inshore\nfisheries grew. It became an official term used to describe the\nfishing communities that were the focus of a government\nresearch initiative. Part of the results of the study showed\nthat the fishermen and their families moved residence up to\nan average of three locations a year according to seasons,\ntides, and fish movements (Ezewu & Tahir, 1997). Figure 3\nshows Ezewu and Tahir's model that explains the three loca-\ntions fishermen reside in each season. These are the base\ncamps, offshore camps, and villages of origin.\nThe villages of origin are large settlements made up of\nseveral clans or families. Although the base camps transit\nsettlements, they also serve as places of extended stay often\nfor considerable lengths of time. They are often established\nto bring the fishermen closer to the fishing grounds. The off-\nshore camps are seasonal sites with temporary homesteads\nwithin or close to the fishing grounds and are not intended\nfor extended periods of stay or designed as such. In this\nstudy, the focus is on the base camp as the primary settlement\nfrom which architectural data are obtained.\nMethod\nA combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was\nadopted for this study. For data collection, focus group dis-\ncussions proved very useful at the base camps. The gathering\nof all the household heads in a multi-homestead base camp\nfor discussions is a preexisting social practice which was\ncapitalized upon. The information derived from these group\ndiscussions was often self-validating as any information\noffered by a member was likely to be confirmed, corrected,\nor refuted by others. Factual credibility rested on collective\nFigure 1. Outward migration to coastal regions of West and\nCentral African Countries.\nmemory which is essential for the narrative and descriptive\napproaches used in studies of the vernacular environment.\nCapturing different aspects of the vernacular environment,\nfrom different views, and showing various building elements\nand details for dichotomous (binary) data categorization\nrequired the use of drawings and photographs.\nTo analyze the data, the use of coefficients for the purpose\nof measuring similarity was adopted. A coefficient is a statis-\ntical technique used in analyzing binary data in a matrix for-\nmat that produces values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. Although\nusing coefficients to determine similarities is effective, it is,\nhowever, not conclusive enough as it only shows similarities\nbut does not show whether the similarities are as a result of\nsame ancestry \"branching\" or borrowing from other cultures\n\"blending.\" As such, it is necessary to ascertain the type of\nsimilarity using more graphical or diagrammatic methods\nlike the principal coordinate analysis (PCA). The XLSTAT\nsoftware, which is a form of multidimensional scaling, was\nused. The end result is a simple graphical display of dots on\na two-dimensional scatter diagram. The position of these\ndots would indicate the level of similarities and source of\nvariations between the dwellings of the different migrant\nfishing groups in the Bakassi Peninsula.\nThe reason for adopting a combination of research meth-\nods is to first ascertain quantitatively the causes of variation\nand then offer possible interpretations from qualitative data\nfor the reasons behind these variations.\nFigure 2.

Adapted from Ezewu and Tahir (1997).\n4 SAGE Open\nTypes of Base Camp Dwellings\nA total of 74 fishing camps were visited for this study, 25 in\nBakassi and 49 in Bayelsa, the location of which are shown\non the maps in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. There are three\nmain types of base camp dwellings built by Ijo migrant fish-\nermen; these are the agbada ware (house on stilts) and the\natu or atuk ware (house on mud foundation). The third\ntype is simply a combination of features obtained from the\nfirst two types. It is referred to as the agbada\u00adatou mo ware\n(stilt house with mud foundation). These building types are\ndistinguished by the materials used and construction meth-\nods used in their substructure. They form the basic base camp\ntypologies built by Ijo migrant fishermen in all locations they\nmigrate to. For example, both the migrant fishermen in\nBayelsa and in Bakassi build these dwelling types, but their\nsimilarities are in the substructure only, aside from that there\nmay be variations.\nFigure 4. Map showing 25 base camps visited and area under Cameroonian control before August 12, 2008.\nSource. Adapted from Map No. 4247 Department of Peacekeeping Operations Cartographic Section (United Nations, 2005).\nAgbada Ware (House on Stilts)\nThe stilt house is the most prominent feature on the Ijo river-\nine landscape. It is built on the edge of the river for easy\naccess to the waterways and to fishing grounds. The dwell-\nings are erected on timber posts or stilts, which create a\nraised platform providing protection from high tides and\nfloods that can reach heights of up to 2 m. Details are shown\nbelow in Figure 6.\nAto\n.uko ware (House on Mud-Foundation)\nThe main feature of the atouko ware is its elevated mud\nfoundation (see Figure 7). The term atouko is derived from\nthe Ijo word atou which means mud. The type of mud\nreferred to here is the chikoko mud. It is a mixture of clay soil\nand dead vegetable matter, which makes it resilient to the\neroding effects of constantly flowing water.\nAgbada-atou mo ware (Mud and Stilt Hybrid\nHouse)\nIn this type of built form, a part of the foundation is erected\non stilts and the other part made up of compact and elevated\nFigure 5. Three river routes and locations of 49 selected base camps in Bayelsa state.\nFigure 6. Agbada ware--Dwelling on stilt foundation.\n6 SAGE Open\nchikoko mud. This occurs when dwellings combine both liv-\ning/sleeping spaces and hearth spaces as shown in Figure 8\nbelow. Another common practice is where a part of the build-\ning is sited on marshy land and the other part over water.\nMigration and Theories of Change\nChange can be identified in any cultural system, which is\nmade up of many subsystems. These include art, architecture,\nfolklore, and so on, all of which experience change. Several\nstudies carried out in this area have all attempted to answer\nquestions relating to variation or change. Such as, the extent of\nthis change and then if this change comes as a result of internal\n(immanent) or external (externalistic) forces. As a result of\ncultural dynamism, changes are bound to occur and the accu-\nmulation of such changes over time constitutes variations.\nStudies in this area suggest that there are two main mech-\nanisms by which variation is produced in material culture:\nvariations generated as a result of copying or \"Lateral bor-\nrowing\" of other ideas during the production process, and\nvariations produced from within the group by \"cognitive\nmechanisms.\" Both way, such changes could occur during\nproduction and an accumulation of these could result in sig-\nnificant variations. Lateral borrowing may or may not be\nintentional but may arise via association with other groups.\nCognitive mechanisms are sometimes deliberate or erro-\nneous modifications made to an original pattern that brings\nabout variations. They can also be innovations necessitated\nby production of material culture in a different context or\nthrough changing \"worldviews\" of the society in question.\nMoreover, the change may come about as a response to new\nchallenges posed by a different climate or location (Gabora,\nanisms is that one is borrowed from neighboring groups and\nthe other is developed from within the group.\nIn relation to migration, this article examines how much\nchange can be attributed to cognitive mechanisms brought\nabout by the expansion or splitting of a society into daughter\npopulations during migration. Also, how much change can\nbe attributed to lateral borrowing of other cultural traits\nfrom other groups encountered during migration? The for-\nmer is known as phylogenesis or \"branching\" (Collard &\nO'Brien, Shennan, & Collard, 2006; Mace, Holden, &\nShennan, 2005), while the latter is referred to as ethnogen-\nThis article shows how quantitative methods are used to\ntest the influence of immanent forces such as \"phylogenesis\nor branching\" and/or externalistic forces such as \"ethnogen-\nesis or blending\" in architectural variation. The aim is to\nascertain the effect of migration on the migrant fisher base\ncamp dwellings of the Ijo ethnic group in Bayelsa and\nBakassi.\nIdentifying Causes of Architectural\nVariations Quantitatively\nThe study was initiated based on the supposition that issues\nrelating to migration could result in changes that constitute\nFigure 8. Agbada\u00adAtouko mo ware--Dwelling using both mud\nand stilt foundations.\nFigure 7. Atouko ware--Dwelling with compact mud foundation.\nsignificant variations between the dwelling models. These\nchanges may either be developed from within the society\nitself or brought about by external influence from other\nneighboring groups. In this research, four of the neighboring\nfishing groups were selected for comparative study. The eth-\nnic groups selected are the Ibibios, Andonis, Ilajes, and the\nUrhobos, each of which has been known to live in the same\nregion as the Ijos at one point or the other during migration.\nAlso, these groups practice migrant fishing and build base\ncamp dwellings. Only architectural data involving external\nfeatures of the base camp dwellings which were collected\nhave been used. These external features or traits are required\nto produce the dichotomous or binary data used in the statis-\ntical analysis.\nIn addition to the architectural data obtained from the\nneighboring ethnic groups, corresponding data from the\nmigrant fishing dwellings in Bayelsa state were also included.\nThe addition of these data was meant to serve two purposes:\nfirst, to serve as a basis for comparison between the base\ncamp dwellings in the ethnic homeland and in Bakassi.\nSecond, it serves as a control to indicate whether any of the\nother ethnic groups have any form of relatedness to the par-\nent Ijo ethnic group in Bayelsa, which could then suggest\nphylogenetic (common ancestry) possibilities between them.\nA list of all exterior features of base camp dwellings in\nBakassi and Bayelsa are presented as dichotomous data\nbelow.\nDichotomous/Binary Data\nThe main architectural traits in the base camp dwellings are\nlisted from 1 through to 14, but there are subtraits as well.\nThese subtraits are known as multistate variables and have\nbeen treated as individual traits. The digit \"1\" records that a\ntrait is present among a particular ethnic group, while \"0\"\nrecords traits that are absent. The use of the \"1\" and \"0\" dig-\nits are the reason this form of data are being referred to as\n\"Dichotomous\" or simply \"Binary\" data (Shennan, 1997).\nThe building traits recorded include construction elements,\nhouse components, or other associated features. This research\nfocuses on external features and as such does not consider\ninternal fixtures or furnishings.\nMeasuring Similarity: Coefficients and\nDichotomous Data\nTo represent the data in dichotomous or binary form, a total of\n32 external architectural features or traits were first identified.\nThese traits are a compilation of the external features of base\ncamp dwellings in the Bakassi peninsula common to all the\nfive groups being compared, including the Ijos. There are a\nnumber of techniques which can be used in analyzing dichot-\nomous data to ascertain similarity between the groups. One of\nsuch techniques is the coefficients. Shennan (1997) examines\nthe use of coefficients for the purpose of measuring similarity\nand discusses the different types of coefficients that can be\nused. However, in this study, coefficients will be used simply\nto derive the matrix for the PCA, which is the quantitative\nmethod required to analyze the data. The coefficients used are\nthe simple matching coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, and\nthe alternative to the Jaccard coefficient.\nThe major point of variance between the first two coeffi-\ncients is how negative matches are treated. Negative matches\noccur when traits are absent in all cases. An example is the\nnegative match in Trait 12 (ii) of Table 1, where none of the\nsix individual ethnic groups possess the trait in question. For\nthe simple matching coefficient, the 1 and the 0 values are\nequally important, which means that even if all the groups or\nunits indicate absence for a particular variable or trait, the\nnegative match still counts when compiling the matrix. It\nsuggests that similarity between groups (in this case, base\ncamp dwellings of different migrant fishing groups) can still\nbe determined by the joint absence of traits in or on them. In\nthe Jaccard coefficient, if the individuals all indicate absence\nfor a trait, then it is disregarded altogether, that is, the nega-\ntive match does not count when compiling the matrix, further\nsuggesting that joint absence of traits does not indicate simi-\nlarity between the individuals being considered.\nFor deriving the coefficient,\na = positive match (joint presence)\nb = positive\u00adnegative match (top presence, bottom\nabsence)\nc = negative\u00adpositive match (top absence, bottom\npresence)\nd = negative match (joint absences)\nFor simple matching coefficient, it is calculated as follows:\nS\na d\na b c d\n=\n+\n+ + +\n.\nFor Jaccard coefficient, it is calculated as follows:\nS\na\na b c\n=\n+ +\n.\nThe alternative to the Jaccard coefficient is as follows:\nS\na\na c\na\na b\n=\n+\n+\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nAll three methods of coefficients were used to calculate\nfor similarity measure and to see whether the results obtained\nwere comparatively similar. Table 2 shows the multistate\ndata being treated as mutually exclusive attributes and pre-\nsented as individual variables.\nTables 3 and 4 exemplify how the matrices are developed\nby counting positive matches (joint presence) indicated by\n\"a,\" mismatches (one presence, one absence) indicated by\n\"b\" and \"c,\" and negative matches (joint absences) indicated\nby \"d.\" This defines the mathematical functions a, b, c, and\nd, respectively, which are then used to calculate the simple\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

What this means is that for any coef-\nficient below the threshold of 0.4, which bears less than half\nthe attributes of the other tribe, there are lesser possibilities\nof borrowing or ethnic blending due to fewer similarities\nbetween the two groups being compared. But for coeffi-\ncients with values of more than 0.7, it shows that there are\nstronger possibilities of borrowing or ethnic blending, due\nto more similarities between the two groups in question.\nCoefficients with values of 0.5 to 0.6 where half the attri-\nbutes are shared are inconclusive.\nInterpreting PCA: Similarities Between\nEthnic Groups\nTo analyze the data matrix and derive two-dimensional scatter\ndiagrams that indicate similarities between the ethnic groups,\nthe XLSTAT software was used. Three different matrix data\nTable 4. Calculating Joint Matches, Negative Matches, and Mismatches Using Approximate Values of Coefficients.\na b c d Zs Zj Za\nTable 5.

BY = Bayelsa; BK = Bakassi.\nwere used in this analysis, and these are the matrices of the\nsimple matching coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, and the\nalternative to the Jaccard coefficient. The three different matri-\nces were analyzed separately to see whether the results of the\nvarious scattergrams they generate would be similar.\nThe scatter diagram or scattergram is a simple two-\ndimensional representation of the results with the ethnic\ngroups indicated as dots in the space. The distance between\nthese dots on the scatter diagram represents the similarity\nbetween the ethnic groups. The scattergram is divided into\nfour quadrants by the two axes F1 and F2. The dots, or in\nthis case ethnic groups, which are seen to cluster within a\nparticular quadrant with the shortest distances between\nthem are regarded as those that bare the strongest similari-\nties. The axes can also be seen as dividing the space into\ntwo halves: the left and right halves and the top and bottom\nhalves. The dots (groups) that conglomerate or cluster on a\nparticular side of the halves can also be interpreted as hav-\ning some form of similarity although not as strong as when\nthe dots (groups) cluster within a particular quadrant. The\ndots positioned across diagonally or farthest from each\nother are the most dissimilar of all the groups.\nThe values obtained from the coefficients was used to\ngenerate values for the four coordinate points for the PCA\nshown in Tables 9 to 11, which is then used to plot the\nscattergrams shown below in Figures 9 to 11, revealing the\nposition of the dots (groups) on the diagram.\nPCA Using the Simple Matching\nCoefficient Matrix\nPCA Using the Jaccard Coefficient\nMatrix\nTable 8.

Similarity Matrix for Alternative to Jaccard\nCoefficient.\nPCA Using the Alternative to the\nJaccard Coefficient Matrix\nDiscussion on Matrix of Coefficients\nand PCA\nThe interpretation of the results obtained from the matrix of\ncoefficient is as follows: For any coefficient below the\nthreshold of 0.5, in which a group bears less than half the\nattributes of the other group, it suggests that there are fewer\nsimilarities between both groups. But for coefficients with\nvalues of more than 0.7, it shows that there are strong\nsimilarities between the two groups (see Tables 1 and 2).\nThis result does not indicate whether the two groups share a\ncommon ancestry (branching) or whether borrowing (blend-\ning) occurs between them. To ascertain whether the similari-\nties are due to \"blending\" or \"branching,\" the PCA was used\nand the result was represented in two-dimensional scatter\ndiagrams or scattergrams.\nInterpretation of Scatter Diagram\nGenerated From All Three Coefficient\nMatrices\nBased on the simple matching coefficient where negative\nmatches are considered, the list should show that t3 (Ibibio),\nt4 (Andoni), and t6 (Urhobo) are the groups with the stron-\ngest similarities in terms of external architectural features in\ntheir base camp buildings. This is supported by the clustering\nof the points within the bottom-right quadrant in the scatter-\ngram. This only partly supports the results of the simple\nmatching coefficient by indicating strong similarities\nbetween t4 (Andoni) and t6 (Urhobo), as the distance\nbetween these two points is the shortest. However, the fact\nthat negative matches have been considered in the build-up\nto this scatter diagram has clearly had an effect on the result.\nThe scatter diagram derived from the alternative to\nJaccard Coefficient matrix is similar to that derived from\nthe Jaccard Coefficient matrix, in that, it also disregards\nnegative matches. The results are similar as the distance\nbetween points (groups) t2, t1, t4, and t6 are closer together\nthan t5 and t3. But more specifically, the space between t2\nand t1, and t2 and t6 are equidistant, which suggests that t2\n(Ijos in Bakassi) bares strong similarities to both t1 (Ijos in\nBayelsa) and t6 (Urhobos). This supports the initial find-\nings that phylogenetic or branching forces exist between t1\nand t2, while ethnogenetic or blending forces exist between\nFigure 9. Scattergram showing the similarity of the groups from\nsimple matching coefficient.\nFigure 10. Scattergram of group similarity generated from\nJaccard coefficient matrix.\nFigure 11. Scattergram of group similarity generated from\nalternative to Jaccard coefficient matrix.\nt2 and t6. However, the distance between t1 (Ijos in Bayelsa)\nand t6 (Urhobos) is far apart, suggesting that similarities\nbetween these two groups are not strong, which reduces the\npossibility of common ancestry between the Ijo (Bayelsa)\nand Urhobo.\nThe results from the scattergram show that the strongest\nsimilarities exist between the external architectural features\nof the Ijo migrant fisher dwellings in Bakassi (T2) and those\nof their Urhobo (T6) neighbors. Similarities between the Ijo\nand the Urhobos in Bakassi show that there are variations\nbetween the Ijos and their parent group in Bayelsa (T1).\nHowever, because the similarities between the Ijos and\nUrhobos are only in external architectural traits, it means that\nthe PCA analysis has only revealed external similarities and\nnot internal ones. The fact that stronger similarities exist\nbetween these two groups, amid all the other groups in\nBakassi that have same levels of proximity to the Ijo migrant\nfishers, raises questions as to why this is the case. Responses\nfrom interviews suggest a number of possible reasons that\ncould have fostered this selective ethnogenetic activity.\nAlthough, results show no indications of both groups\nsharing a common ancestry, the data obtained from respon-\ndents during fieldwork confirm that a stronger level of busi-\nness relationship and proximity exists between the Urhobo\nand Ijo migrant fishermen. Over the years, fishermen of the\nUrhobo group migrate into inshore brackish water regions\ndominated by Ijo tribes to carry out fishing activities. They\nare the only non-Ijo group allowed to operate within the\ninshore territorial waters of the region while other tribes\nwithin the region are limited to the marine or offshore waters.\nHowever, it shows that there has been increased proximity\nand relations due to migration between the Urhobo and the\nIjo migrant fishermen. The evidence suggests that these\nincreased relations have led to possible \"blending\" activities\nbetween the two groups.\nConclusion\nThe PCA analysis therefore reveals that one of the causes of\nvariations between the Ijo base camp dwellings in Bakassi\nand Bayelsa is ethnogenesis, due to the Ijos in Bakassi bor-\nrowing cultural traits from the Urhobos, whom they had\nmore contact with during migration. However, it is important\nto note that the traits borrowed from their neighboring group\nrelates more to building components and external architec-\ntural features as listed in Table 1 and not to spatial configura-\ntion. Of these two aspects, the PCA only revealed the source\nof the exterior variations. Because the PCA analysis was\nbased on data obtained from only external architectural fea-\ntures of all the groups, the results cannot be used to explain\nvariations in the spatial configurations of the dwellings.\nFurthermore, from Table 1, the data show that the use of\nconnecting walkways to indicate kinship ties and the use of\nliving areas were used only by Ijos in Bakassi, which sug-\ngests that some of the architectural traits were not borrowed\nbut are a result of cognitive mechanisms. This means that in\naddition to lateral borrowing of traits, variations in Ijo base\ncamp dwellings in Bakassi also resulted from cognitive\nmechanisms which are modifications made by successive\ngenerations of fishermen over the years. So based on the\nempirical evidence, the conclusions drawn from this\nresearch is that causes of variations in Ijo migrant fisher\narchitecture can be traced to two sources or factors: lateral\nborrowing of traits from neighboring groups as well as mod-\nifications due to cognitive mechanisms made by the Ijos in\nBakassi over time.\nAs such, the study supports findings of past works by\nSorokin (1985) who argued that change is determined not\nonly by external circumstances but also by the nature of the\nsystem itself. It also supports the claims by Diaw (1992) on\nhow ethnogenesis influences lateral borrowing among\nmigrant fishing groups. In addition, we could also deduce\nfrom the findings that similarities in base camp dwelling\ndesigns, due to possible lateral borrowing between Ijos and\nUrhobos in Bakassi, are not a function of language similarity.\nThis supports the claims made by Welsch, Terrell, and\nNadolski (1992) that there are no associations between simi-\nlarity of material culture and language, than those made by\nRoberts, Moore, and Romney (1995) who suggest that there\nis such an association. Finally, the result showing notable\nvariations between base camp designs challenges the previ-\nous hypothesis made by Hollos (1989) that no evident change\nin culture, livelihood, and behavior was observed from those\nwho had settled in the Cameroons over the years.\nThis study does not totally attribute change or architec-\ntural variations solely to migration; it, however, shows how\nmigration acts as an agent of contact and communication\nbetween different groups. It is this contact that inevitably\nresults in cross-pollination of social and material cultural\ntraits between neighboring groups and one of such material\nculture is vernacular architecture.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAgoro, S.
