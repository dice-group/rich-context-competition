The prevalence rate in Nigeria varies from one\nlocation to another, for example, 0.65% in rural Mangu vil-\nlage to 11.0% in urban Lagos. However, the prevalence rate\nfor Nigeria is put at 3.9% (International Diabetes Federation,\nDespite the tremendous success at improving the lives of\nthose living with diabetes with technological breakthrough\nin biomedical sciences, the management of type 2 diabetes\nlies largely with those with diabetes. It includes practices that\nmust be carried out by the patients themselves. Such prac-\ntices include eating a healthy diet, performing physical exer-\ncise, taking medication as prescribed, monitoring of blood\nglucose level, regular clinic visits, and managing stress,\namong other practices (American Diabetes Association,\n2002). However, performing these practices has remained\nproblematic for those living with the condition as it requires\nbehavioral change. Chinenye et al. (2012) and Chinyere,\nNandy, and Nwankwo (2010) claimed that most Nigerians\nwith diabetes have suboptimal glycemic control, are hyper-\ntensive, have chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, and\ndo not practice self-monitoring of blood glucose. Okafor and\nOfoegbu (2012) observed suboptimal glycemic, blood pres-\nsure control and dyslipidemia and overweight among sub-\njects studied. A study on illness beliefs and diabetes in\nUganda adults identified patients' limited knowledge about\ndiabetes in general as a major problem in diabetes manage-\nment (Ujelm & Nambozi, 2008). Baumann, Opio, Otim,\nOlson, and Ellison (2010) found that few patients did home\nglucose monitoring, considered activities of daily living as\nregular exercise, and lack healthy food choices.\nIf people living with diabetes are to follow their physi-\ncians' recommendations, it is imperative for the physicians\nto understand their knowledge of diabetes and health beliefs\nabout diabetes and how these affect their following physi-\ncians' recommendations. Understanding knowledge of dia-\nbetes and health beliefs may help in designing an effective\nintervention program for those living with diabetes.\nTherefore, this study was conducted to understand the asso-\nciation and influence of diabetes knowledge and health\nbeliefs on diabetes management among the Igala in Kogi\nState, Nigeria.\nThe Igala are an ethnic group in Kogi east, Nigeria.

Boston (1969) likens the location of the Igala to\nPoland in Europe, which seems to have been pulled in differ-\nent directions at different periods. The Igala still hold on to\ntheir traditions, including the belief that traditional medi-\ncines can cure all kinds of illnesses. There are no data on the\nincidence and prevalence of diabetes among the Igala except\nthe national prevalence rate of 3.9 %, as estimated by the\nInternational Diabetes Federation (2009) for Nigeria.\nTheoretical Framework\nThe health belief model (HBM), developed by Becker and\nMaiman (1975), is useful in explicating self-care activities\nsuch as diabetes management recommendations and has a\nfocus on behavior related to the prevention of disease. The\nfoundation of the HBM is that individuals will take action to\nprevent, control, or treat a health problem if they perceive the\nproblem to be severe in nature; if they perceive that the\naction will yield or produce an expected outcome; and\nbecause of the perceived negative consequences of therapy.\nThe HBM has been applied to a broad range of health\nbehaviors. Three broad areas can be identified: (a) preventive\nhealth behaviors, which include health promoting (such as\ndiet, exercise) and health-risk (such as smoking) behaviors as\nwell as vaccination and contraceptive practices; (b) sick-role\nbehaviors, which refer to compliance with recommended\nmedical regimens, usually following professional diagnosis\nof illness; and (c) clinic use, which includes physician visits\nfor a variety of reasons. The HBM states that an individual's\nbehavior can be predicted based on certain issues that the\nindividual may consider (perceived susceptibility, perceived\nseverity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers) when\nmaking a decision about a particular behavior concerning his\nor her health (Glanz, Lewis, & Rimer, 1990). These concepts\nwere proposed to account for people's \"readiness to act.\" An\nadded concept, cues to action, would activate that readiness\nand stimulate overt behavior, while the concept of self-effi-\ncacy, or one's confidence is the ability to successfully per-\nform an action. These concepts were added to help the HBM\nfit better the challenges of changing habitual unhealthy\nbehaviors, such as being sedentary, smoking, or overeating.\nUsing HBM, the likelihood of individuals with diabetes\nmellitus adhering to biomedical prescription is determined\nby certain variables. The first variable, susceptibility, refers\nto the perception of vulnerability to diabetes and its compli-\ncations. How do individuals perceive developing problems\ndue to diabetes, for example, hypoglycemia and hyperglyce-\nmia? An individual's perception of diabetes complications\nwill likely motivate him or her to adhere to medical prescrip-\ntions. The second variable, severity, is the perception of dia-\nbetes as a serious illness, ranging from perceiving\ncomplications, such as blindness, to viewing diabetes as a\nlife-threatening disease. The third variable, benefits, con-\ncerns the perception that the diabetes regimen will be\neffective. For example, taking regular exercise and eating\nregulated meals will make the patient feel better as a result of\ntaking these actions. The fourth variable, barriers, refers to\nthe perceived costs of adhering to the regimen. This deals\nwith how inconvenient the regimen is perceived to be, for\nexample, how much will it cost a patient to buy the drugs for\na month considering other responsibilities before the patient.\nFinally, cues to action deals with either external (e.g., remind-\ners from family members when to take medications) or inter-\nnal (e.g. feeling high and low blood sugar) cues the individual\nassociates with taking action.\nResearch Design\nA convenient sample of 152 men and women living with dia-\nbetes who met the selection criteria and agreed to participate\nin this study constituted the participants for the study. The\nrespondents were selected from seven hospitals owned by\ngovernments, private individuals, and faith-based organiza-\ntions that served as both out-patient and in-patient clinics.\nThe respondents were approached as they came in to see\ntheir doctors or to have a blood glucose test. The selection\ncriteria for inclusion included the following: the individual\nmust have been diagnosed by a medical doctor as having dia-\nbetes, he or she must be attending clinics for treatment and\ncheck-ups, he or she must be mentally sound to respond to\nquestions, and he or she must give a voluntary consent to\nparticipate in the study. The instruments were in-depth inter-\nview guide and questionnaire, which was either self-admin-\nistered or interview administered, depending on the literacy\nlevel of the respondent. For the illiterate respondents, the\nquestionnaire was transcribed from English to the Igala lan-\nguage and back to English by experts in spoken and written\nIgala. The questionnaire included questions on socio-demo-\ngraphic characteristics and diabetes knowledge test (DKT)\nand diabetes HBM developed by Given, Given, Gallin, and\nCondon (1983), on perceived susceptibility, perceived sever-\nity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. These were\nused to measure the diabetes knowledge and beliefs about\ndiabetes from those with the condition. The study was con-\nwas approved by the ethical committee of Kogi State\nMinistry of Health.\nMeasurement of Diabetes Knowledge, Health\nBeliefs Diabetes Management\nThe DKT consisted of 7 items administered to the respon-\ndents. The 7 items were directly from the University of\nsubstituting the food items on the original DKT with the\nlocally available food consumed in the study population. The\nrespondents were scored based on total correct responses out\nof 7 items and were classified as either having low or high\ndiabetes knowledge.\nThe study adopted 16 questionnaire items, as developed\nby Given et al. (1983), on perceived susceptibility, perceived\nseverity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, to mea-\nsure the beliefs of diabetic patients about their diabetes. The\nitems were measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from\nstrongly disagree to strongly agree. To quantitatively capture\nthe degree of agreement to each item by the respondents, the\nitems were scored from the lowest to the highest. The item\nscores for each scale were then summed up to serve as the\nmeasure for the respective attribute. To ascertain how many\nof the respondents scored high (good or satisfactory) or low\n(bad or poor) on each of the attributes, a norm above which a\nperson was high and below which was low was created by\nadopting the mean. This enabled ranking as high or low,\ngood or poor. The HBM scale consisted of 16 items and was\nfound to be reliable (16 items:  = 71), the subscales of per-\nceived susceptibility ( = 72), perceived severity ( = 63),\nperceived benefits ( = 74), and perceived barriers ( = 71).\nDiabetes management was measured using self-reports of\nthe respondents on the performance of their physicians' rec-\nommendations on medication, regular blood glucose testing,\nweight management, eye and foot examination, regular clinic\nvisits, and regular physical exercise. However, metabolic\ncontrol was not included, as it requires blood samples which\nwere not performed in this study. Using the same method\ndescribed above, participants'responses were scored, ranked,\nand classified as good or poor and high or low.\nResults and Analyses\nA total of 54% of the respondents were women, whereas\n46% were men. The respondents' mean age was 56. The\nmean age support Nyenwe, Odia, Ihekwaba, Ojule, and\nBabatunde (2003), who state that diabetes is more frequently\nfound in people aged 50 years and above in Nigeria. Also,\n29% of them had no formal education, 23% had primary edu-\ncation, 18% secondary education, and 26% post-secondary\neducation. Besides, 34% were civil servants, 18% were self-\nemployed, 14% were retirees, and 15% were not in any paid\nemployment, whereas 12% were house wives.\nDiabetes Knowledge\nTable 1 below shows that 38% of the respondents could not\nidentify food that contains carbohydrate, and 43% could not\nidentify food with the highest concentration of fat. About\n36% did not know what is the best method for testing blood\nglucose, while 9% said that it is through urine testing. On the\nissue of exercises, 46% did not know the effects of exercises\non individuals.\nRegarding taking care of the feet, 32% did not know how\nto take care of their feet. About 57% knew how best to man-\nage their feet, while 12% got it wrong on how to take care of\nthe feet. About 59% did not know the effect of eating food\nthat contains less fat, 18% said that it decreased the risk of\nkidney problem, whereas about 15% asserted that it decreases\nthe risk for heart diseases.\nTable 2 above shows that 49% of the participants had low\ndiabetes knowledge, whereas 51% had high diabetes knowl-\nedge. This result may be attributed to the low level\nTable 1.

The\nmean of the item served as a measure of perceived suscepti-\nability of the patient to control his or her diabetes.\nTable 5 shows that 40% and 56% of those with low and\nhigh perception of susceptibility to diabetes complications\nhad poor diabetes management status, respectively, com-\npared with 60% and 44% of those with low and high percep-\ntion of susceptibility to diabetes complications with good\ndiabetes management. However, the chi-square statistics\nresult shows no relationship between perceived susceptibil-\nity and diabetes management (p > .05). Hence, the hypothe-\nsis that stated that perceived susceptibility to complications\nof diabetes will motivate the individual to follow doctor's\nrecommendations was rejected.\nPerceived severity.The respondents reported their belief of\nseverity of their diabetes by rating how serious their diabetes\nwill have bad effect on their future health (for instance, \"my\ndiabetes will cause me to be sick a lot\"). The means of these\nratings served as measures of perceived severity (M = 13.38,\nSD = 2.07). Four items assessed perceived severity on a\n5-point scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly\ndisagree.\nThe bivariate analysis showed that 73% and 17% of those\nwith low and high perception of severity had poor diabetes\nmanagement status, respectively, whereas 27% and 83% of\nthose with low and high perception of severity of diabetes,\nrespectively, had good diabetes management status.

Exam-\nples are \"I believe I can control my diabetes\" and \"my\nmedicine would make me feel better\" assessed on a 5-point\nscale of strongly disagree to strongly agree. The mean of the\nfour items served as the measure of perceived benefits (M =\nThe bivariate result showed that 35% and 64% of those\nwith low and high perceived benefits, respectively, had\npoor diabetes management status, whereas 65% and 36%\nof those with low and high perceived benefits of follow-\ning biomedical recommendations, respectively, had good\ndiabetes management status. The statistics showed that\nthere was a significant relationship between perceived\nPerceived barriers. The respondents rated four items acting as\nbarriers to diabetes management status on a 5-point scale,\nranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. These\nincluded \"I would have to change too many habits\nTable 2. Respondents' Level of Diabetes Knowledge.\nLevel of knowledge Frequency %\nSource. Underlying data from survey, 2009.\nand follow my prescriptions\" to \"following prescriptions\ninterfere with my normal daily activities.\" The mean of the\nrating was used to measure the perceived barriers (M = 11.88,\nSD = 2.48); higher scores showed more barriers to diabetes\nmanagement.\nTable 1 shows that 54% and 46% of those with low and\nhigh perceived barriers, respectively, had poor management\nstatus, whereas 46% and 59% of those with low and high\nperceived barriers to following recommendations had good\nmanagement status. The chi-square result showed that there\nwas no significant relationship between perceived barriers\nand diabetes management (p > .05). Hence, the hypothesis\nwhich states that perceived barrier will impede the individual\nfrom following doctors' recommendations was rejected.\nThe result on the aggregate of all subscales of HBM\nshowed that 42% and 51% of those with low and high per-\nception of health belief, respectively, had poor diabetes man-\nagement status, whereas 58% and 49% of those with low and\nhigh perception of health belief, respectively, had good man-\nagement status. The result shows that statistically there is no\nrelationship between the aggregate health belief and diabetes\nmanagement.\nRegression Analysis\nA further analysis in Table 6 shows that health belief ( =\nence on diabetes management.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe study examined the association and influence of diabe-\ntes knowledge, diabetes beliefs, and diabetes management,\nincluding self-report to following physician's\nrecommendations.\nThe result which linked high level of diabetes knowledge\nwith poor management status supports a similar study that\nfound good level of diabetes knowledge with poor adherence\nto recommendations (Al-Deagi, McElnay, & Scott, 1995).\nThe association between diabetes knowledge and diabetes\nmanagement supports a study that has demonstrated that\nincreased glycemic control is associated with higher scores\nof diabetes knowledge (Colleran, Starr, & Burge, 2003).\nIn this study, diabetes knowledge was associated with\nmanagement status. This agrees with Glasgow and\nAnderson's (1999) claim that disease-specific diabetes\nknowledge may be a process or mediating variable that\nTable 5.

This may be\nrelated to the perceived susceptibility of health belief, par-\nticularly the assertion that knowledge of the complications of\ndiabetes may lead to taking the necessary preventive\nmeasures.\nThe study showed that, even though some respondents\nhad high diabetes knowledge, some of them still had low\nmanagement status. This finding is in line with the study by\nBautista-Martinez et al. (2008) that the acquisition of diabe-\ntes-related knowledge is not enough to increase compliance\nwith diabetes treatment. According to Klepac (1996), indi-\nviduals will not carry out a health-related behavior unless\nthey have at least a minimal level of health motivation and\nknowledge, see themselves as vulnerable and the condition\nas threatening, are convinced of the health behavior efficacy,\nand find few barriers to the action. Arseneau, Mason, Wood,\nand Green (1994) have found that illness-specific knowledge\nis one component of effective self-management, whereas\ncomponents to include behavioral skills, cognitive problem-\nsolving abilities, and a sense of efficacy in bringing these\ncapabilities to bear to affect disease outcome. The implica-\ntion of the finding is that diabetes knowledge is an important\nfactor on how patients will follow their management plan but\nshould not be seen as an end in itself.\nThe low level of diabetes knowledge found in this study\ncompares relatively with other studies on diabetes knowl-\nWhile other empirical evidences from other studies suggest\nthat people affected with diabetes often have inadequate\nknowledge about the nature of diabetes, its risk factors, and\nassociated complications (Jabbar, Contractor, Ebrahim, &\nConsensus among the health care providers in the communi-\nties attests to the low level of diabetes knowledge in the\nstudy communities they described the level of diabetes\nknowledge among the people as shallow.\nAs the findings show, perceived severity and perceived\nbenefits were significantly related to diabetes management.\nThis may be explained by the fact that not all the constructs of\nHBM will directly affect diabetes management. Rather, other\nfactors, such as socio-demographic characteristics, diabetes\nknowledge, perception, psychosocial factors, patients'factors,\nand cultural beliefs (Arndt et al., 2001; Williams, Whittle, &\nGatrell, 2002), will have to be all present to activate the beliefs.\nFor the present study, the health beliefs related with dia-\nbetes management were perceived severity and perceived\nbenefits. This finding is supported by Glasgow, McCaul, and\nSchafer (1986), who avers that beliefs about treatment effec-\ntiveness appear to have an important influence on diabetes\nself-management. Ayele, Tesfa, Abebe, Tilahun, and Girma\n(2012) also found that those respondents with high perceived\nseverity of diabetes and less perceived barrier to self-care\nwere more likely to take diabetes self-care. Garcia and Mann\n(2003) also confirmed the predictability of three variables\nout of the four variables, with susceptibility, barriers, and\nbenefits explaining 43% of the variance of intention to resist\ndieting. Nejad, Wertheim, and Greenwood (2005) found that\nthe best predictors of weight loss were perceived susceptibil-\nity and perceived benefits, while perceived benefits of diet-\ning and severity (a measure of how negatively weight gain is\nperceived) significantly predicted intention to diet.\nSimilarly, Cerkoney and Hart (1980) found that the com-\nbination of the five HBM variables accounted for 25% of the\nvariance in adherence, as measured by self-report in combi-\nnation with a reactive direct observational procedure. Based\non the results from this study using HBM, it can be said that\nHBM alone is a poor predictor of diabetes management\namong those with diabetes in the studied population. This is\nevident as only perceived severity and perceived benefits had\nsignificant relationships with diabetes management. The\nvalue expectancy assumption of the model seems weak\namong the study respondents. This could be linked to the\nbelief among the Igala that all diseases are curable using\nlocal herbs from competent herbalists. This result supports\nAdejoh's (2011) claim that, among the Igala, there is a strong\nbelief in Igala medicine in curing all kinds of diseases. This\ncould have implications for how a person will manage his or\nher condition. Hence, using HBM alone could be misleading\nand lead to wrong decisions and judgments.\nThe findings of this study are in line with a review which\nfound that the individual components (severity, susceptibil-\nity, benefits, and barriers) each only accounted for 0.5% to\n4% of the variance in behavior (Harrison, Mullen, & Green,\nof health beliefs accounted for 41% to 52% of the self-\nreported adherence and that perceived severity and perceived\nbenefits were associated with greater self-reported adherence\nand metabolic control.\nThis study was not an experimental design and was lim-\nited to self-report of the respondents. Hence, the validity of\nthe model in this population has not been tested. The study\nonly took a convenient sample from one ethnic group in an\nethnically diverse region. So the generalization of these find-\nings must be with caution. Also, the responses to all the ques-\ntions were all self-reports. There could be the problem of\nrecall from the respondents, which might make the reliability\nof the responses difficult to validate. Besides, this report was\nlimited to diabetes knowledge and health beliefs using HBM\nand so did not give room to examining cultural beliefs affect-\ning diabetes management among the studied population.\nSimilarly, only four components of the earlier version of\nHBM were used to measure health beliefs in this study, hence\nthe need to expand the study and include the added compo-\nnents of the revised model. However, it is hoped that the\nfindings from this study will stimulate further studies on dia-\nbetes knowledge, health beliefs, and diabetes management in\nNigeria, with particular focus on cultural beliefs in relation\nto diabetes health beliefs.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdejoh, S.
