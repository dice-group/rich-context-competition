    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: Routine fasting (12 h) is always applied before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but\nprolonged preoperative fasting causes thirst, hunger, and irritability as well as dehydration, low\nblood glucose, insulin resistance and other adverse reactions. We assessed the safety and efficacy\nof a shortened preoperative fasting period in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nMethods: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up\nto 20 November 2015 and selected controlled trials with a shortened fasting time before\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy. We assessed the results by performing a meta-analysis using a\nvariety of outcome measures and investigated the heterogeneity by subgroup analysis.\nResults: Eleven trials were included. Forest plots showed that a shortened fasting time reduced\nthe operative risk and patient discomfort. A shortened fasting time also reduced postoperative\nnausea and vomiting as well as operative vomiting. With respect to glucose metabolism, a\nshortened fasting time significantly reduced abnormalities in the ratio of insulin sensitivity. The\nC-reactive protein concentration was also reduced by a shortened fasting time.\nConclusions: A shortened preoperative fasting time increases patients' postoperative comfort,\nimproves insulin resistance, and reduces stress responses. This evidence supports the clinical\napplication of a shortened fasting time before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n",

However, some\nstudies have indicated that a long preopera-\ntive fasting period causes patient discomfort\nmanifesting as thirst, hunger and irritability\nas well as adverse reactions such as dehy-\ndration, low blood glucose and insulin\nresistance. Oral administration of carbohy-\ndrates 2 h before anaesthesia for surgery\nis safe and reduces both insulin resistance\nand patient discomfort.4 Oral carbohydrates\nalso reduce gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis,\nlipolysis and muscle protein catabolism\nand increase glycogen reserves.5 At present,\na shortened preoperative fasting period\nand administration of oral carbohydrates\nbefore laparoscopic cholecystectomy remain\ncontroversial. This systematic review was\nperformed to provide reliable evidence\nfor the application of this approach in\nclinical practice.\nThree published meta-analyses included\nstudies of paediatric, neoplastic and general\nsurgery, but their results require further\ninvestigation. Recently, numerous trials eval-\nuating the impact of preoperative fasting\ntimes in patients undergoing laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy have yielded inconsistent\nresults. Considering the differences in pre-\noperative fasting times, we performed the\npresent meta-analysis of randomized con-\ntrolled trials to determine the impact of a\nshortened preoperative fasting period in\npatients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystec-\ntomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst meta-analysis of the effects of a shortened\npreoperative fasting time in patients undergo-\ning laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nMaterials and methods\nData sources, search strategies and\nstudy selection\nWe searched the PubMed and Embase\ndatabases and the Cochrane Central\nRegister of Controlled Trials using the fol-\nlowing core terms: ``preoperative fasting,''\n``diet restriction,'' ``perioperative period,''\nand ``clinical trial.'' We applied no language\nrestrictions and included all relevant articles\nmanual searches from the reference lists of\nidentified trials. This study conforms to the\nPRISMA guidelines for the reporting of\nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nTwo reviewers independently identified\neligible reports. Discrepancies were resolved\nthrough group discussion. The eligibility\ncriteria were as follows: treatment by lap-\naroscopic cholecystectomy, randomized\ncontrolled design, and use of comparison\ngroups in which one group underwent a\nshortened preoperative fasting time and the\nother (control group) underwent routine\nfasting or water as placebo. The exclusion\ncriteria were as follows: the study did not\nevaluate the impact of the preoperative\nfasting time, patients included those who\ndid not undergo laparoscopic cholecystec-\ntomy, and data on some investigated\noutcomes were unavailable (e.g. under risk\nin operation, gastric volume, pain, PONV,\nglucose, insulin, insulin resistance/sensitiv-\nity, cortisol, C-reactive protein [CRP] and\ncarnitine).\nData extraction and quality assessment\nTwo authors compiled the data using a\npredefined information sheet. The following\nitems were extracted from the included art-\nicles: author, year, number of patients (experi-\nmental), diabetes, ASA level, fasting time in\nthe experimental group, nutrient type, liquid\nvolume, control type and conclusion. Two\nreviewers also independently assessed the risk\nof design bias in the included studies using the\nCochrane Collaboration tool.9 The following\noutcomes were evaluated in this review: under\nrisk in operation, gastric volume, pain,\nPONV, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance/\nsensitivity, cortisol, CRP and carnitine.\nThese outcome measures were ranked accord-\ning to the Grading of Recommendations\nAssessment, Development and Evaluation.10\nStatistical analysis\nWe used the inverse variance method to pool\ncontinuous data and the Mantel\u00adHaenszel\nmethod for dichotomous data; the results\nare presented as the standardized mean\ndifference (SMD) with 95% confidence\ninterval (CI), risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI\n(under risk in operation) and odds ratio\n(OR) with 95% CI. The I2 statistic was\ncalculated to evaluate the extent of variabil-\nity attributable to statistical heterogeneity\nbetween trials. In the absence of statistical\nheterogeneity (I2 < 50%), we used a fixed-\neffects model; otherwise we used a random-\neffects model.11 The median and quartile\ndata were transformed to mean and SD for\nanalysis.12 We analysed the following pre-\ndefined subgroups to identify the sources of\nheterogeneity: nutritional types, control\ntypes and intake volume. We investigated\npublication bias by visually examining funnel\nplots and using the Begg\u00adMazumdar and\nEgger tests. The nonparametric ``trim-\nand-fill'' method was used to determine\nthe stability if publication bias was present.\nGenerally, a two-sided P-value of< 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. Data\nanalysis was performed with Review\nManager (Version 5.3) and STATA\nResults\nLiterature search and study\ncharacteristics\nOur database search returned 249 articles\nafter removing duplicates, from which we\ncollected 11 trials for inclusion in our meta-\nanalysis (Figure 1). All included patients\nunderwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nThe ASA class was not described in two\narticles, while one article included patients\nwith an ASA class of 1 to 3. The preopera-\ntive fasting time was 2 h in all studies except\none, in which the fasting time was 3 to 4 h.\nThe intake type was carbohydrates (or\nmaltodextrin) and carbohydrates plus pro-\ntein, glutamine, antioxidants or other nutri-\nents. The intake volume ranged from 200 to\n400 ml. The control types were placebo\ncontrol (water) and blank control (routine\nfasting). Blank control and placebo control\nwere set parallel in three studies. With\nrespect to the studies' conclusions, one art-\nicle did not recommend a shortened pre-\noperative fasting period based on the results\nof glucose metabolism. Others considered a\nshortened fasting time to be safe, reduce\npatient discomfort, improve insulin sensitiv-\nity and reduce postoperative stress reactions\n(Table 1). Three studies did not use a\nblinding method, and four studies used\ninappropriate blinding methods or the asses-\nsor was not blinded to the study group.\nOverall, the included studies had high-\nquality designs (Figure 2).\n24 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)\nMeta-analysis\nFor the operative risk and gastric volume\nindex, the fixed-effects model showed that a\nshortened fasting time reduced the operative\ndifference in the gastric volume between the\nshortened fasting and control groups (SMD,\nFor the subjective sensation index, pain\nassessment using a visual analogue scale\nshowed that a shortened fasting time signifi-\ncantly reduced postsurgical pain (SMD,\nwas no significant difference in operative\nnausea between the shortened fasting and\nFigure 1.

This type\nof surgical research could lead to promo-\ntion of a shortened fasting time in the\nclinical setting.\nThe present meta-analysis indicates that\noral carbohydrates taken 2 hours before\nsurgery do not affect the gastric volume.\nOne report even concluded that carbohy-\ndrates can reduce the gastric volume to a\ngreater extent than can routine fasting.\nOkabe et al.21 indicated that clear fluids,\norange juice, and non-human milk had no\nsignificant effect on gastric emptying,\nalthough the total calories were the main\ninfluencing factor.13 Oral carbohydrates\nsignificantly reduced postoperative pain,\nnausea and vomiting; one clinical trial of\nadenotonsillectomy had similar findings,\nalthough the results were not statistically\nsignificant.14 Postoperative insulin resistance\nrefers to the reduction in tissue sensitivity and\nreactivity after surgery. HOMA-IR, calcu-\nlated according to the formula blood glucose\nconcentration (mg/dl)\u00c2 blood insulin con-\ncentration (U/ml)/405, can be used to\nevaluate the level of insulin resistance.\nAbnormal glucose tolerance and insulin\nresistance lead to poor recovery after surgery.\nOur analysis showed that oral carbohydrates\nreduce insulin resistance and enhance sensi-\ntivity.

Cortisol, which is regulated by\nadrenocorticotrophic hormone and increases\nafter surgery, plays an important role in the\nimmune system.

Furthermore, oral carbohydrates\nsignificantly reduce the CRP concentration.\nA study involving gastrointestinal surgery\nshowed that oral carbohydrates taken 2\nhours before surgery significantly reduced\nthe postoperative inflammatory response and\nCRP/albumin ratio and shortened the hos-\npital stay.16 Volume intake was a source of\nheterogeneity.

First, we did not have specific\nindividual data for all of the trials; thus, our\nstatistical analysis could only be performed\nat the study level. Second, although sub-\ngroup analysis was performed, there was\nheterogeneity in several outcomes. This\nindicates that there are still unknown fac-\ntors that cause heterogeneity. Third, the\ngastric volume, glucose concentration, and\nHOMA-IR were likely sources of publica-\ntion bias.\nConclusions\nThe findings of our study suggest that the\npreoperative fasting time is associated with\nincreased postoperative comfort, improved\ninsulin resistance, and a reduced stress\nresponse in patients undergoing laparo-\nscopic cholecystectomy.
