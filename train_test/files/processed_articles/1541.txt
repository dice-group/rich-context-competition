The goal of the present\nstudy was to test the hypothesis that trace acrylamide exposure might be independently associ-\nated with both reduced blood insulin and reduced insulin resistance.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined 1,356 participants with reli-\nable measures of glucose homeostasis and Hb adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003\u00ad2004. Glucose homeostasis\nwas assessed by the measurement of plasma glucose, serum insulin, and the homeostasis model\nassessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).\nRESULTS -- In a linear regression model, a 1-unit increase in log HbAA was associated with\nin the fully adjusted models, the adjusted serum insulin level and HOMA-IR significantly de-\ncreased across quartiles of HbAA (Ptrend\n 0.001 for both). In subgroup analysis, the association\nof HbAA levels with HOMA-IR and insulin levels was stronger in subjects who were white or had\never smoked or in subjects with a lower education level or a BMI 25 or 30 kg/m2.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Acrylamide is associated with reduced serum insulin levels in adults.\nFurther clinical and animal studies are warranted to clarify the putative causal relationship.\nAcrylamide, a highly reactive ,-\nunsaturated carbonyl compound, is\nwidely used to synthesize polymers\nfor industrial applications such as soil\nconditioning, wastewater treatment, re-\nsearch applications, cosmetics, and the\npaper and textile industries (1). Besides\nindustrial and laboratory uses, acryl-\namide in foodstuffs has become a world-\nwide concern because of its generation in\na variety of fried and oven-baked foods\nduring cooking. Attention was drawn to\nthis fact initially by Tareke et al. (2) in\nysis showed that heating of free amino ac-\nids (asparagines) and sugars during food\nthe formation of acrylamide concentra-\ntions of up to 1 mg/kg food (3). According\nto recent data, the mean daily workplace\nbody wt (4), whereas human consumption\nvia food is about 1 g  kg body wt1 \nday1 in the general population and 4 g \nkg body wt1  day1 in high consumers\n(5). Moreover, acrylamide is a component\nof cigarette smoke. Its content has been es-\nclearly an important source of acrylamide\nexposure (6).\nThe majority of acrylamide is conju-\ngated with glutathione in the human\nbody, and some (about 15%) is activated\nepoxy compound, glycidamide. Glycid-\namide is subsequently metabolized by hy-\ndrolysis and conjugated with glutathione.\nAcrylamide and glycidamide form ad-\nducts with the NH2\n-terminal NH2\ngroup\nof the valine residue of Hb (7). Hb ad-\nducts reflect an integrated concentration\nover 4 months (8); therefore, these adducts\nare useful as predictors of toxicity. Hb ad-\nducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidam-\nide (HbGA) have been used as biomarkers\nof exposure and to estimate the internal\ndose from workplace exposure as well as in\nthe general population (9).\nThe biological consequences of acryl-\namide exposure have chiefly centered on\nneurotoxicity ever since this effect was\nobserved in humans exposed to this com-\npound in the workplace (9). Subse-\nquently, experimental exposure of\nrodents to acrylamide has shown im-\npaired development, reproductive toxic-\nity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity.\nHowever, epidemiological studies in the\nworkplace and general population have\nnot established an unambiguous link be-\ntween acrylamide exposure and human\ncancer (9\u00ad11). Acrylamide was classified\nby the International Agency for Research\non Cancer as a probable human carcino-\ngen (12). Given the lack of dose-response\ndata for human neurotoxicity, the risk as-\nsessment was based on rodent studies and\nsupported by primate studies of acryl-\namide neuropathy. Based on these data,\nconcluded that the \"no observed effect\nlevel\" for acrylamide neuropathy is 0.2\nmg  kg body wt1  day1 (5). This pro-\nvides a margin between exposure and the\nno observed effect level of 200. Therefore,\nit is not likely that acrylamide-induced\nneurotoxicity will be detected in the gen-\neral population.\nA recent study, using an animal\nmodel, showed both lower insulin and\ntriglyceride concentrations after continu-\nous intake of trace acrylamide in a dose of\n0.28 ppm similar to that for the general\npopulation (13). In another study, rats\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, En Chu Kong Hospital, Taipei County,\nTaiwan; the 2Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, National Taiwan University\nCollege of Public Health, Taipei, Taiwan; the 3School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei\nCounty, Taiwan; the 4Department of Pediatrics, Taipei City Hospital, Zhongxiao Branch, Taipei, Taiwan;\nand the 5Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, National Taiwan University Hospital,\nTaipei, Taiwan.\nCorresponding authors: Lian-Yu Lin, hspenos@yahoo.com.tw, and Pau-Chung Chen, pchen@ntu.edu.tw.\nC.-Y.L. and Y.-C.L. contributed equally to this study.\n\u00a9 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.

In a recent cross-\nsectional epidemiology study in Europe,\nHbAA was inversely associated with BMI\nin smokers (15). Based on these studies,\nwe hypothesized that trace acrylamide ex-\nposure might be independently associ-\nated with reduced insulin resistance and\nimproved serum lipid profiles. Because\nthe homeostasis model assessment for in-\nsulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a reliable\nsurrogate measure of insulin resistance\n(16), we can use fasting glucose and insu-\nlin concentrations to accurately estimate\ninsulin resistance status. The goal of the\npresent study was to test this hypothesis\nby examining data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nMETHODS -- Data were from NHANES\npopulation-based survey designed to\ncollect information on the health and nu-\ntrition of the U.S. household population\nand to obtain a representative sample of\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian U.S.\npopulation. The survey data are released\nevery 2 years. Detailed survey operations\nmanuals, consent documents, and bro-\navailable on the NHANES Web site (17).\nWe limited our analyses to the 6,990 par-\nticipants aged at least 20 years who had a\ntest for HbAA and HbGA. Among these\nsubjects, only 3,169 had a morning exam-\nination and measurements of fasting\nplasma glucose and serum insulin. Of\nthese participants, 1,356 subjects without\nmissing data were included in the final\nanalyses.\nAnthropometric and biochemical\ndata\nAccording to the statements on the\nNHANES Web site, data were collected at\nall study sites by trained personnel using\nstandardized procedures. Sociodemo-\ngraphic and medical information such as\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, education level,\nhousehold income, and medication usage\nwere collected during the household in-\nterview. Alcohol intake was recorded and\ndetermined by the questionnaire and cat-\negorized into three levels (12 drinks,\nSmoking status was categorized as active\nsmoker, former smoker, and nonsmoker\nby a questionnaire on smoking (18). We\nalso quantified smoking status by serum\nng/ml) in the same manner as in a previ-\nous study (19). BMI was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared. Waist circumference was\nmeasured at the iliac crest to the nearest\n0.1 cm. Laboratory measurements were\nperformed in a mobile examination cen-\nter. For serum markers, blood specimens\nwere collected by glass tubes (red-top Va-\ncutainer), whereas for plasma glucose,\nblood specimens were collected in a vac-\nuum tube containing sodium fluoride\n(gray-top Vacutainer). Blood specimens\nwere processed locally and then were\nstored and shipped to central laboratories\nfor analysis. Levels of serum total choles-\nterol and triglyceride were measured en-\nzymatically. Levels of HDL cholesterol\nwere measured after precipitation of other\nlipoproteins on a Hitachi model 704 ana-\nlyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,\nIN). Plasma glucose was measured by the\nhexokinase enzymatic method (Cobas\nMira Chemistry System; Roche Diagnos-\ntic Systems, Montclair, NJ). Serum C-\nreactive protein levels were measured by\nlatex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade Be-\nhring Nephelometer II Analyzer System;\nDade Behring Diagnostic, Somerville,\nNJ). Cotinine was measured in serum\nsamples using isotope-dilution high-\nperformance liquid chromatography/\natmospheric pressure chemical ionization\ntandem mass spectrometry (Hewlett-\nliquid chromatograph and PE-Sciex API\nIII triple quadrupole mass spectrometer)\n(20). GHb was measured by a boronate\naffinity high-performance liquid chroma-\ntography system and converted to A1C\nlevels (automated high-performance liq-\nuid chromatography system, model\nCLC330; Primus, Kansas City, MO.). Se-\nrum insulin was determined by immu-\nnoenzymatic assay with Tosoh AIA-PACK\nimmunoreactive insulin. The HOMA-IR,\nthe product of basal glucose and insulin\nlevels divided by 22.5, was used as a reli-\nable surrogate measure of insulin resis-\nAssessment of HbAA and HbGA\nHuman whole blood or erythrocytes were\nused to measure HbAA and HbGA. Spe-\ncifically, the reaction products with the\n-terminal valine of the Hb protein\nchains (N-[2-carbamoylethyl] valine and\nN-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine for\nacrylamide and glycidamide adducts, re-\nspectively) were measured. This method\nis based on a modified Edman reaction,\nwhich uses the formation of Edman prod-\nucts from N-alkylated amino acids in neu-\ntral or alkaline conditions rather than the\nacidic conditions required in the conven-\ntional Edman reaction (21). This opti-\nmized method was further refined and\nmodified to increase the sensitivity and\nenable automation. HbAA and HbGA\nwere quantified using octapeptides with\nthe same amino acid sequence as the\nterminus of the -chain of Hb and\nwith acrylamide and glycidamide at-\ntached at the valine residue (AA-\ncorresponding stable isotope-labeled\nas an internal standard. Total Hb was\nmeasured using calibrators provided\nwith the manufacturer's assay kit (22).\nThe limit of detection was 2 pmol/g Hb\nfor HbAA and 3 pmol/g Hb for HbGA.\nFor concentrations below the detection\nsamples, respectively), a value was as-\nsigned by NHANES that we used in our\nanalyses.\nStatistics\nData are expressed as means  SE. Con-\ntinuous variables were compared be-\ntween groups by an unpaired Student t\ntest, whereas categorical variables were\ncompared by a 2 test. The strength of the\nassociations between the concentrations\nof HbAA, HbGA, and plasma glucose ho-\nmeostatic markers was tested using linear\nregression models.\nFor linear regression models, we\nused an extended model approach for\ncovariates to adjust for potential con-\nfounders. Model 1 was adjusted for age,\nsex, and race; model 2 was adjusted for\nage, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol\nintake, education levels, household in-\ncome, BMI, A1C, and insulin/glucose/\nHOMA-IR. When the plasma glucose\nwas treated as an independent variable,\nserum insulin was entered as a depen-\ndent variable and vice versa. When the\nindependent variables were the deriva-\ntives of the plasma glucose and the se-\nrum insulin, both the plasma glucose\nand the serum insulin were not adjusted\nin the model. The HOMA-IR was ad-\njusted in the final model if the indepen-\ndent variable was not an arithmetic\ncombination of the plasma glucose and\nthe serum insulin. The relative contri-\nbution of each dependent variable to\npredict the variation of dependent vari-\nable was determined by partial R2. Log\ntransformation was performed for vari-\nLin and Associates\nables with significant deviation from a\nnormal distribution before further\nanalyses.\nWe performed three sets of sensitiv-\nity analyses to test the robustness of our\nfindings. First, to explore whether the\nassociations between certain serum\nmarkers and HbAA and HbGA might be\nmediated by different foods (e.g.,\ngreater consumption of high-fat, high-\ncalorie foods might result in high HbAA\nand HbGA and insulin resistance), we\nexamined the associations after includ-\ning daily nutrient intake (daily calories,\ncarbohydrate, total fat, cholesterol, and\nfiber) from NHANES dietary interview\ndata (23). Second, because medications\nsuch as antihyperglycemic, antihyper-\ntensive, and antihyperlipidemic agents\nmight confound associations between\nHbAA concentrations and other glucose\nhomeostatic markers, we performed our\nanalyses again, including data on self-\nreported current medication usage.\nThird, because smoking is a major\nsource of acrylamide exposure, we ad-\njusted the smoking status both by ques-\ntionnaire data and serum cotinine levels\nto avoid possible recall bias.\nSampling weights that account for\nunequal probabilities of selection, over-\nsampling, and nonresponse were applied\nfor all analyses using the Complex Sample\nSurvey module of SPSS (version 13.0 for\nWindows XP; SPSS, Chicago, IL).\nRESULTS -- The study sample in-\nThe weighted geometric mean HbAA\nconcentrations were adjusted for age,\nsex, and race/ethnicity.

The results were\nsimilar after subjects with diabetes were\nexcluded (data not shown).

In that study, male Wistar rats were\nfed with acrylamide, formed from frying\nThe amount of acrylamide ingested was\nestimated to be similar to daily human\nintake (0.28 ppm). All of the rats grew\nwell, and no gross abnormalities attribut-\nable to the experimental oil were ob-\nserved, except that the acrylamide-fed\nrats had significantly lower insulin and\ntriglyceride levels. These findings are in\naccord with ours, but the causal biochem-\nical mechanisms are not clear. Because\nchronic smoking is associated with insu-\nlin resistance and high insulin levels (24),\nit is interesting that acrylamide in ciga-\nrette smoke might counterbalance the ef-\nfect of smoking on glucose homeostasis.\nFrom subgroup analyses in the present\nstudy, increased acrylamide concentra-\ntions were generally associated with de-\ncreased serum insulin levels, particularly\nin subjects who were active smokers and\nhad a low education level and high BMI,\nall of which are associated with high in-\nsulin resistance. Perhaps the association\nbetween acrylamide and insulin is more\nobvious in subjects with high acrylamide\nor high insulin resistance.\nIn a recent animal study, rats treated\nwith acrylamide at doses of 5.0 mg  kg1 \nday1) showed measurable decrements\nof food-motivated behavior when tested\nat 6\u00ad12 weeks of age. The lack of a body\nweight difference between treatment\ngroups in these animals during the course\nof testing suggests that acrylamide may be\ncapable of producing a direct effect on\nappetitive motivation in rats (14). How-\never, the dosage used was far higher than\nexposure of the general human popula-\ntion. According to a recent cross-sectional\nepidemiology study in Europe, HbAA is\ninversely associated with BMI in smokers\nwithout adjustment for potential con-\nfounders (15). In our study, we also\nshowed that HbAA is inversely associated\nwith BMI and waist circumference with\nsimple adjustment. However, after ad-\njustment for smoking status, the associa-\ntion was not significant. Because smoking\nis an important source of acrylamide ex-\nposure and smoking could lead to weight\nloss, the association is probably con-\nfounded by smoking status.\nNutritional status, particularly amino\nacid balance, has an important effect on\nglutathione homeostasis (25), which may\nbe relevant in detoxification. The ade-\nquate provision of sulfur-containing\namino acids as well as glutamate and gly-\ncine is critical for the maximization of glu-\ntathione synthesis. Although there was no\ninformation about amino acid intake, the\ndaily caloric and protein intakes were es-\nunlikely to lead to glutathione deficiency\nand therefore have little or no effect on\nacrylamide conjugation.\nMeasurements of HbAA and HbGA\nare expensive and difficult but well estab-\nlished. The modified Edman reaction\nmethod used in NHANES was success-\nfully applied to adducts produced by\nacrylamide and glycidamide. This opti-\nmized method has been refined and mod-\nified in-house to increase sensitivity and\nenable automation. It has been widely\nused in several studies (8,21) and makes\nmeasurement of acrylamide exposure\npossible in population studies.\nFigure 1--Box and whisker plots of HOMA-IR (A) and adjusted serum insulin levels (B) across\nquartiles of the HbAA adducts in the fully adjusted model (age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol\nintake, education level, household income, BMI, and plasma glucose or serum insulin). The trends\nof plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR across quartiles of HbAA adducts were significant (P \nAcrylamide and glucose homeostasis\nOur study has several limitations.\nFirst, the cross-sectional design does not\npermit any causal inferences. Second, ex-\nposure to acrylamide also might be an in-\ndicator of exposure to multiple chemicals,\nincluding other endocrine disruptors in\nsmokers. If the associations reported here\nare confirmed in independent studies,\nmore work will be needed to identify the\nmechanisms of action linking long-term,\nlow-dose acrylamide exposure to health\noutcomes in humans.\nIn summary, we present the first re-\nport that acrylamide exposure is associ-\nated with both reduced blood insulin and\ninsulin resistance. Because exposure to\nacrylamide in foodstuffs and smoking has\nbecome a worldwide concern, further\nlongitudinal clinical and in vitro studies\nare urgently needed to elucidate the puta-\ntive causal relationship.\n"
