Data from\nity in the United States is 16.9% among all children ages\n2\u00ad19, and the prevalence has been reported as high as 29%\namong certain racial/ethnic groups (1). Obesity in child-\nhood is associated with an increased risk for many adverse\nphysical and psychosocial health outcomes (2). As a growth-\npromoting process that affects almost every organ system\nin the human body (3), obesity has been shown to affect\nthe timing of puberty in boys and girls (4). Before puberty,\noverweight children are significantly taller than their age-\nmatched peers (5). Given its association with accelerations\nin growth and maturation it is reasonable to hypothesize\nthat obesity affects the timing of tooth eruption.\nTooth eruption is the movement of a tooth from its position\nin the osseous crypt into the oral cavity. Although the exact\nmechanisms underlying this process are not entirely known,\nmany factors appear to play a role. Demographic factors, such\nas race, sex, and age may influence the process (6). Physiologic\nfactors thought to be involved include molecular signaling (7)\nand several hormones and mediators that affect growth (8).\nGrowth of the mandible is known to be influenced by pubertal\ntiming (9). Deciduous tooth eruption may be altered in con-\njunction with certain systemic disorders, such as diabetes mel-\nlitus and congenital abnormalities (10,11). Alterations in the\ntiming of tooth eruption can significantly impact oral health\ndue to its potential to cause malocclusion (the improper posi-\ntioning of the teeth and jaws) and/or crowding, which may in\nturn lead to poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease (12,13).\nIn addition, the length of time a tooth is present in the oral cav-\nity affects its risk for dental caries. Furthermore, sequencing of\neruption may impact occlusion which may have consequences\nfor periodontal and temporomandibular joint disorders.\nA relationship between the timing of a child's primary teeth\nhas been observed; however, few studies have been conducted\nto examine the effects of obesity on the timing of permanent\ntooth eruption. One longitudinal study conducted in Mexico\nCity found that among 110 children, obese children had more\nerupted teeth than nonobese children, after accounting for sex\nand age at baseline (19). A US study of 104 children found that\nobesity was associated with accelerated dental development\nThe Association Between Childhood Obesity\nand Tooth Eruption\nAviva Must1, Sarah M. Phillips1, David J. Tybor1, Keith Lividini2 and Catherine Hayes3\nObesity is a growth-promoting process as evidenced by its effect on the timing of puberty. Although studies are\nlimited, obesity has been shown to affect the timing of tooth eruption. Both the timing and sequence of tooth eruption\nare important to overall oral health. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between obesity and\ntooth eruption. Data were combined from three consecutive cycles (2001\u00ad2006) of the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) and analyzed to examine associations between the number of teeth erupted (NET)\nand obesity status (BMI z-score >95th percentile BMI relative to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) growth reference) among children 5 up to 14 years of age, controlling for potential confounding by age, gender,\nrace, and socioeconomic status (SES). Obesity is significantly associated with having a higher average NET during\nthe mixed dentition period. On average, teeth of obese children erupted earlier than nonobese children with obese\nchildren having on average 1.44 more teeth erupted than nonobese children, after adjusting for age, gender, and race/\nethnicity (P < 0.0001). SES was not a confounder of the observed associations. Obese children, on average, have\nsignificantly more teeth erupted than nonobese children after adjusting for gender, age, and race. These findings\nmay have clinical importance in the area of dental and orthodontic medicine both in terms of risk for dental caries\ndue to extended length of time exposed in the oral cavity and sequencing which may increase the likelihood of\nmalocclusions.\n1Department of Public Health & Community Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 2HarvestPlus/International Food Policy Research\nInstitute, Washington, DC, USA; 3Frances Stearns Nutrition Center, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Girls\nwho were classified as \"early maturers\" had more erupted per-\nmanent canines, premolars, and second molars compared to\n\"late maturers\" (23). These aforementioned studies were limited\nby the study of small nonrepresentative samples of children.\nThe purpose of the current study was to perform a cross-\n\nsectional analysis of the association between childhood obes-\nity and tooth eruption, accounting for age, sex, and race in a\nnationally representative data set, the NHANES. Differences\nin the average number of permanent teeth erupted (NET)\nbetween obese and nonobese children by age were examined.\nWe hypothesized that obesity would be associated with accel-\nerated tooth eruption, and that differences in age-specific tooth\neruption would differ by race/ethnicity and by gender.\nMethods and Procedures\nStudy population\nData were obtained from the NHANES, a continuing survey of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized US population (24). The oral health\nexamination in the NHANES is completed by a dentist who has under-\ngone extensive training, including a calibration phase in which the\ndegree of correlation between the dental examiners and a standard\nexaminer is assessed. Complete information on procedures and assess-\nment included in the oral health component can be found at http://\nwww.cdc.gov/ nchs/data/nhanes/oh-e.pdf. To achieve a sample size\nrequired for reliable estimates for testing differences between sub-\nsis were extracted from the demographic, body measures, and dental\nhealth publicly available data files, and merged based on the sequence\nnumber (SEQN) (ID) variable for each relevant cycle for this analysis\nOverall 31,509 participants comprise the combined data file. All analy-\nses were restricted to the 5,838 participants between 5 (the minimum age\nat the dental exam) up to 14 years of age (the end of the mixed dentition\nperiod). Excluded from the analytic data set were participants who were\nnot both interviewed and examined (n = 200), pregnant (n = 1), and\nthose who were missing data on tooth count or BMI (n = 203). After these\nexclusions, 5,434 participants remained for analysis.\nSelection of variables\nSeveral key variables were created for this analysis. The NET was calcu-\nlated by taking the sum of all permanent teeth erupted for each subject\n(excluding the 3rd molars). A permanent tooth was considered to be\nerupted if it was coded as a \"permanent tooth\" or a \"permanent dental\nroot fragment\" and considered to be non-erupted otherwise. Obesity sta-\ntuswasdefinedbasedonBMIz-scoreasbeinggreaterthanorequaltothe\n95th percentile (obesity) or between the 85th and 95th percentile (over-\nweight), based on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) growth charts (26). Age, race/ethnicity, gender, and the poverty\nincome ratio (PIR), were examined as independent predictors or con-\nfounders of the association between NET and obesity. Race/ethnicity\nwas categorized as other, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other\nHispanic, or non-Hispanic white. PIR is a measure of socioeconomic sta-\ntus(SES)andiscalculatedastheratioof\nhouseholdincometothepoverty\nthreshold after accounting for inflation and \nfamily size.\nDomain variables were created for subpopulation analyses and speci-\nfied the study population of interest while retaining all other observations\nfrom the data set. To incorporate the sample weighting in this study,\na new sample weight was calculated for the merged 6-year sample by\nmultiplying the 2-year examination sample weight by one-third (1/3),\nas recommended (27). This approach utilizes the sampling scheme in\nNHANES and properly estimates variance.\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses were accomplished using SAS (Version 9.2; SAS, Cary, NC).\nExploratory data analyses were performed by examination of visual repre-\nsentationsandsummarystatisticsforthevariablesofinterest.Comparisons\nof the two groups (obese and nonobese) were made using independent\nsamples t-test for continuous variables and 2 tests for categorical variables.\nWe also examined the relationship between NET and weight status using\nthree categories: normal weight (<85th percentile), overweight (85th and\n<95th percentile), and obese (95th percentile). Normal weight subjects\nwere used as the reference category in this secondary analysis.\nSimple linear regression was used to explore the association between\nthe NET and obesity. To assess secular trends across the three waves\nof data, a variable representing the cycle year was added to the model,\nincluding an interaction term for obesity and cycle year.\nThe association between the NET and each potential confounder (age,\ngender, race, and PIR) was evaluated using simple linear regression analy-\nsis. Each predictor was then added to a model that included obesity to\ncheck for confounding. All significant predictors and confounders were\nincluded in an adjusted model, and collinearity was examined. Effect\nmodification was evaluated by including all two-way interaction terms\nbetween obesity and age, gender, race, and PIR. An  of 0.05 was used to\ndeclare statistical significance.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the differences in sociodemographic character-\nistics between obese and nonobese children. Obese subjects\nhad a higher mean age than nonobese subjects. In addition,\nthere was a higher proportion of Mexican Americans in the\nobese group and a lower proportion of non-Hispanic white\nAmericans. Obese subjects also had a lower median PIR. There\nwas no significant difference in the proportion of males and\nfemales in the two groups.\nBivariate analyses revealed several differences in NET. NET\nwas significantly associated with obesity status (P < 0.0001).\nObese subjects had a higher median NET. NET was also\nsignificantly associated with being female (P < 0.0001) and\nrace/ethnicity (P < 0.0001). As expected, there was a strong\npositive correlation between NET and age (Pearson r = 0.93,\nP < 0.0001). NET was not significantly correlated with PIR\n(P = 0.30; Spearman correlation), however.\nTable 2 and Figure 1 show NET by age category and obes-\nity status at the mean and median, respectively. In all age cat-\negories from age 7 onward, obese subjects had significantly\ngreater mean NET than nonobese subjects. The greatest dif-\nferences in NET are seen at age 10 and age 11, with obese\nsubjects exceeding nonobese subjects by a mean of 2.7 and a\nmedian of six teeth.\nTable 3 shows the results of the linear regression analyses.\nIn an unadjusted analysis (model 1) obesity is significantly\nassociated with NET, and 1% of the variation in tooth erup-\ntion explained by this model. Cycle year was not significantly\nassociated with NET in the presence of obesity. When poten-\ntial confounders were examined independently, age, gender,\narticles\n \nand race/ethnicity were all significant confounders of the asso-\nciation between obesity and NET. PIR was not significantly\nassociated with NET in the presence of obesity. In a full model\nadjusting for significant confounders, age, gender and race/\nethnicity all remained statistically significant, with no evidence\nof collinearity, secular trend across the survey cycles, or other\ntwo-way interactions.\nThe final model is presented as model 2 in Table 3. On\naverage, obese subjects have 1.44 more teeth erupted than\nnonobese subjects after controlling for age, gender, and race/\nresents a significantly better fit compared to the unadjusted\nmodel. Racial differences in tooth eruption, after adjusting for\nobesity, were also observed. Participants classified as Mexican\nAmerican, non-Hispanic black, and of other race have signifi-\ncantly greater NET on average compared to participants classi-\nfied as non-Hispanic white.\nIn secondary analyses, overweight subjects had 0.52 more\nteeth erupted on average compared to normal weight subjects,\nafter adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity (P = 0.02).\nWith these same statistical adjustments, subjects classified\nas obese had 1.55 more teeth erupted than normal weight\n\nTable 2 Mean (s.e.m.) number of permanent teeth erupted by\nage category and obesity status (weighted estimates)\nAge category\nNonobese Obese\nN\nMean\n(s.e.m.) n\nMean\n(s.e.m.)

The predictive model that includes obesity status,\nage, gender, and race explains almost 85% of the variability in\nNET. Some variability may be attributable to characteristics\nnot included in the current analysis, such as nutrition, tempo-\nral variations, season of birth, climate, and/or developmental\nconditions such as Down's syndrome. We also found the NET\nwas elevated in association with overweight, but the magni-\ntude of the positive association was smaller.\nAn association between the timing of tooth eruption and\nBMI has been observed previously in nonrepresentative sam-\nples. A recent longitudinal study conducted over a 4-year\nperiod in 88 Mexican school children found a significant rela-\ntionship between BMI category and tooth eruption patterns\nthe overweight category had 4.29 more teeth erupted on aver-\nage than children classified as \"thin\" (BMI between the 5th and\nless than the 50th percentiles). Based on the results of a longi-\ntudinal mixed model, the overweight group had about 5 more\nteeth at age 11 than the thin group, after adjustment for age\nat baseline, sex, SES, and primary teeth present. This differ-\nence far exceeds the 1.44 difference in the NET observed in our\nanalysis; however, the reference category (children classified as\nthin) used for both the baseline and longitudinal analyses was\nvery different than the one used in our study. In a small cross-\nsectional study that assessed the difference between dental age\nand chronologic age in relation to BMI, dental age difference\nsignificantly increased with increases in BMI (mean (s.d.) den-\ntal age difference was 0.63 (1.31) for normal weight subjects,\nThe findings in this study have clinical importance in the area\nof caries risk and risk for malocclusion. Disturbances in the\ntiming of tooth eruption can affect new emerging teeth (28),\nwhich influences timing of treatment. Failure to treat early\nenough may lead to increased oral health problems such as\nmalocclusion, crowding, and impaired oral hygiene (10). Failed\nplanning in the timing of treatment may also necessitate addi-\ntional treatments later on. The results of this study indicate that\nteeth may be erupting sooner in obese children, underscoring\nthe need for comprehensive periodic oral evaluation.\nSeveral limitations to our study are noteworthy. First, during\nthe tooth count portion of the dental exam, teeth are coded\nas \"not present\" if they have not yet emerged. This is often\nthe situation for very young subjects. However, teeth are also\ncoded as not present if they have been extracted. This might\nbe the case for slightly older subjects who have had orthodon-\ntic surgery. This dual coding likely leads to misclassification\nfor subjects who have had teeth extracted. In addition, tooth\nemergence itself is a gradual process, with potential for some\nmisclassification in coding a tooth as erupted or not. Both of\nthese sources of error would be expected to be non-differential\n(similar by obesity status), and would attenuate the differences\nobserved. Furthermore, tooth extraction itself can lead to alter-\nations in the timing of tooth eruption (29). However, due to\nthe young age of the study population, the number of extracted\nteeth is likely very small and similar in both groups and thus\nwould not be expected to affect the results of this study. After\nrational timing, such as Tanner stage, which precluded our\nability to explore maturation as a mechanism for accelerated\neruption. The PIR has been criticized for its failure to include\ntax burden or account for regional differences in cost of living\n(30). Nonetheless, it remains the measure of choice in analyses\nof nationally representative data in the United States (31,32).\nIt is important to note that 404 participants (7% of the ana-\nlytic sample) missing values on one or more variables were not\nincluded in the linear regression analysis. These subjects were\nolder, were of higher SES, and included a higher proportion\nof whites and Hispanic Americans. Our analysis was able to\nexamine only the cross-sectional association between obes-\nity status and tooth eruption; it was not able to explore the\ntiming of the onset of obesity. Variations in this timing may\naffect this association and should be explored in future studies.\nAmong the study's strengths was the use of a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of US children whose dental examination\nfollowed a standardized research protocol. Obesity status was\nsimilarly based on a standardized anthropometric examina-\ntion with BMI defined based on the CDC growth reference.\nThe sample available for these analyses was large enough to\nexamine age-specific comparisons between obese and non-\nobese participants.\nOur results suggest that obese children's teeth erupt ear-\nlier than nonobese children's teeth. In this analysis, obesity\nwas shown to be significantly associated with the NET dur-\ning the mixed dentition period, independent of gender, age,\nand race/ethnicity. Differences in NET were greatest before\npuberty; the later onset of puberty among nonobese subjects\nmay provide time for them to \"catch-up\". On average, obese\nchildren had 1.44 more teeth erupted than nonobese children.\nTable 3Results from linear regression models predicting\nnumber of permanent teeth erupted (weighted estimates)\n (s.e.) P value R2 RMSE\nRMSE, root mean square error.\narticles\n \nThis difference is substantial and noteworthy because these\nfindings may have implications for the planning and timing\nof oral health care for obese children. It is not clear from this\nstudy whether the altered timing in tooth eruption affects\nthe oral health of obese children, but future studies should\nexplore this potential outcome. Future research should also\nexamine the timing of the onset of obesity with respect to\ntooth emergence to establish how incidence will affect this\nassociation. Finally, more research is needed to examine the\nassociation between obesity and the order of tooth emer-\ngence, as this may also impact oral health. These findings may\nhave implications for dental and orthodontic health care.\n"
