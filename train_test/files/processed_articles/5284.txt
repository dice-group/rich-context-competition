However,\nthey are not completely effective in preventing or reversing\nthe development of DN3,4, in part due to a compensatory\nincrease in plasma renin activity (PRA) and AngII, which\nmay potentially overrideARB blockade ofAT1R. Inhibition\nof renin, a rate-limiting step in the RAAS activation cas-\ncade, provides an additional approach and the potential for\nachieving a full blockade of RAAS activity by suppressing\nproduction of AngI and AngII; meanwhile, renin inhibition\nmay be also associated with reduced production of angio-\ntensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)], as a positive component in RAAS\ncascade, antagonizing effects of angiotensin II in the dia-\nbetic kidneys.\nAliskiren as a direct renin inhibitor through combination\nwith other RAAS blockade has shown protective renal and\ncardiac effects in human and animal diabetes.5\u00ad10 Work\nusing mouse models including a eNOS deficient model, db/\nProtective effects of aliskiren and valsartan\nin mice with diabetic nephropathy\nWeidong Wang1,2, Liru Qiu1, Allison Howard1, Nathaniel Solis1,\nChunling Li2, Xiaoxin Wang1, Jeffrey B.

Here we demonstrate that aliskiren\nhas equal efficacy as valsartan in ameliorating diabetic kid-\nney diseases, by decreasing fibrosis, inflammation, endo-\nplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lipid accumulation.\nCombination with aliskiren and valsartan in some, but not\nin all aspects, showed better nephroprotective effects in\ndiabetic kidneys compared with monotherapy.\nMethods and materials\nAnimals and treatments\nAll procedures were in accordance with institutional guide-\nlines for animal research. Eight week-old male DBA2/J\nmice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,\nME, USA). They were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark\ncycle. Mice were injected with freshly made STZ (Sigma-\nAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, 50 mmol/L sodium citrate\nbuffer pH 4.5) intraperitoneally (40 mg/kg) for 5 consecu-\ntive days, or with 50 mmol/l sodium citrate solution only.\nTail vein blood glucose levels were measured 1 week after\nthe last STZ injection, and mice with non-fasting glucose\nlevels >250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. To replicate\nthe hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia seen in subjects\nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus all mice were fed a high fat\nTeklad, Madison, WI, USA) after the onset of diabetes.19\nAnimal studies and relative protocols were approved by the\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at the University of\nColorado, Denver, USA.\nThe mice were assigned to five treatment groups (n=6\neach group). They were treated with vehicle (controls\n(CTL) and diabetes (DM)), aliskiren (25 mg/kg per day,\nD-Ali), valsartan (8 mg/kg per day, D-Val) and combina-\ntion (D-AV). Aliskiren was subcutaneously infused to mice\nviaALZETmicro-osmotic pump (DURECTCo., Cupertino,\nCA, USA). Valsartan was given to mice in drinking water.\nThe drug treatments were carried out for 6 weeks. A 24-h\nurine sample was collected from each mouse placed in indi-\nvidual metabolic cages to measure urinary albumin and\nnephrin excretion before sacrifice. Blood was taken from\nthe tail vein in mice for measurement of serum glucose con-\ncentration. After 6 weeks of drug treatment, all mice were\nanesthetized with pentobarbital and the kidneys were rap-\nidly excised from mice to perform biochemical and histo-\nlogical examinations, as described in following sections.\nValsartan and aliskiren were kindly provided by Novartis\n(Basel, Switzerland).\nBlood and urine chemistry\nThe serum concentration of glucose was measured by\nLabAssay Glucose Kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Urinary\nalbumin, nephrin and creatinine concentrations were deter-\nmined using kits from Exocell (Philadelphia, PA, USA).\nBlood pressure measurement\nMean blood pressure (MAP) was measured in conscious\nmice by tail-cuff sphygmomanometer (Visitech BP2000;\nApex, NC, USA). All animals were preconditioned for\nblood pressure measurements for 1 week before each\nexperiment.\nHistology\nSections (4-m thick) cut from 10% formalin-fixed, paraf-\nfin-embedded kidney samples were stained with periodic\nacid-Schiff (PAS). Thirty glomeruli were randomly selected\nfrom each mouse to perform the PAS analysis. Semi-\nquantitative scoring of glomerulosclerosis was performed\nusing a five-grade method described previously.19 Frozen\nsections were stained with oil red O, to identify neutral\nlipid deposits.\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nWe performed immunostaining for nephrin (mouse anti-\nbody, a gift from Dr. Larry Holzman, University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and synaptopodin\n(Sigma) and imaged with a laser scanning confocal micro-\nscope (Zeiss 510 NLO/META, Jena, Germany). The\n386 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nexpression level was quantified as the sum of pixel values\nper glomerular area using ImageJ (version 1.44) image\nanalysis software.\nRNA extraction and quantitative\nreal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from the kidney cortex using SV\nTotal RNA Isolation System from Promega (Madison, WI,\nUSA) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse tran-\nscriptase reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules,\nCA, USA). The mRNA level was quantified using Bio-Rad\niCyCler real-time PCR machine. Cyclophilin RNA was\nused as an internal control and the amount of RNA was\ncalculated by the comparative threshold cycle method as\nrecommended by the manufacturer.\nProtein electrophoresis andWestern blotting\nEqual amounts of protein samples from the kidney cortex\nwere subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitro-\ncellulose membranes. After being blocked with 5% fat-free\nmmol/l Tris\u00b7HCl and 150 mmol/l NaCl, pH 7.4), the blots\nwere incubated with antibodies against: 1) podocin (1:200;\nG20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), 2)\nsc-7160). Corresponding secondary antibodies were visual-\nized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Bradford,\nIL, USA). The signals were quantified with a chemilumi-\nnescence detector and the accompanying densitometry\nsoftware (UVP, Upland, CA, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nResults are presented as the means \u00b1 SE. Data were ana-\nlyzed by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test for mul-\ntiple comparisons. Statistical significance was accepted at\nResults\nTreatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren\nand/or valsartan on metabolic parameters\nAs shown in Table 1, the body weights of diabetic mice\nwere significantly decreased compared to control mice,\nwhereas the ratio of kidney weight/body weight was sig-\nnificantly increased in all groups of diabetic mice. Blood\nglucose levels in all diabetic groups were significantly\nhigher than non-diabetic control mice. Aliskiren or valsar-\ntan treatment had no effect on the blood glucose levels in\nthese mice. Therapy with aliskiren, valsartan and the com-\nbination all significantly reduced blood pressure in diabetic\nmice compared with non-treated diabetic mice.\nTreatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren\nand/or valsartan improved proteinuria and\nprevented podocyte injury and loss as well\nas mesangial expansion\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), diabetic mice treated with vehicle\ndeveloped moderate albuminuria. Monotherapy with\naliskiren and/or valsartan significantly and comparably\ndecreased urinary albumin excretion in diabetic mice.\nPodocyte injury results in increased podocyte excretion\ninto the urine. We therefore measured urinary nephrin\nexcretion as a marker of podocytes in the urine. Although\nboth aliskiren and valsartan treatment alone significantly\nreduced urinary nephrin excretion in diabetic mice, combi-\nnation therapy provided greater reduction in urinary nephrin\nexcretion than single treatment, indicating synergistic\neffects of aliskiren and valsartan on protection of podocyte\nintegrity in diabetes (Figure 1(b)). Consistent with reduced\nurinary nephrin excretion, reduced immunostaining of\nnephrin in glomeruli of diabetic mice was significantly pre-\nvented by both monotherapy and combination treatment\n(Figure 2(a) and 2(c)). Immunofluorescence microscopy\nshowed that both monotherapy and combination treatment\nalso prevented reduced expression of synaptopodin seen in\nmice with diabetes (Figure 2(b) and 2(c)). Western blots\nshowed that podocin protein abundance was 40% decreased\nTable 1.

Although\ncombination treatment was associated with higher expres-\nsion of podocin when compared to monotherapy, this\nincrease did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3(a)\nand 3(c)). Protein expression of WT1, a nuclear podocyte\nmarker, was also examined by Western blots (Figure 3(b)\nand 3(c)). The abundance of WT1 was significantly reduced\nto about 80% of control level in diabetic mice, whereas\nmonotherapy and combination treatment increased WT1\nexpression, suggesting podocyte loss seen in diabetic mice\nmay be prevented by the treatments.\nIn addition to podocyte injury, glomerular mesangial\nexpansion is also a hallmark of DN. PAS staining and semi-\nquantitative scoring was used to assess mesangial expan-\nsion. Compared with controls, diabetic mice with vehicle\ntreatment showed marked mesangial expansion and clearly\nincreased accumulation of extracellular matrix in the\nmesangium (Figure 4). Mesangial expansion was reduced\nby aliskiren or valsartan treatment alone, but combination\nwith aliskiren and valsartan had additional inhibitory\neffects (Figure 4). Vehicle treated mice showed the highest\nscore, and all drug treatments led to a reduction in the\nmesangial expansion, with combination treatment resulting\nin additional reduction (Figure 4).\nTreatment of diabetic mice with aliskiren\nand/or valsartan modulated renal fibrosis\nand inflammation\nRenal fibrosis and inflammation are important mediators of\nDN. To determine the effect of the treatments on profibrotic\nfactors, we measured the mRNA expression of transform-\ning growth factor- (TGF-), plasminogen activator inhibi-\ntor-1 (PAI-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)\nin the kidney. As shown in Figure 5, in non-treated diabetic\nmice gene expression of TGF-, PAI-1 and CTGF were all\nincreased compared with the non-diabetic control. The\nincreased mRNA level in these factors was significantly\nsuppressed by the treatments with monotherapy and combi-\nnation therapy. Combination therapy with aliskiren and val-\nsartan remarkably decreased mRNA expression of the\nproinflammatory chemokines monocyte chemotactic pro-\ntein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and inter-\nFigure 3.Aliskiren and/or valsartan treatment prevented reduction of podocin and WT1 protein abundance in the kidneys\nof diabetic mice.

The lipid accumulation was moderately\nreduced after aliskiren and valsartan treatment (Figure\n6(a)) and this was consistent with decreased mRNA\nexpression of adipophilin, a marker of lipid droplets\n(Figure 6(b)) after combination treatment. We examined\nthe expression of genes that mediate cholesterol and fatty\nacid/triglyceride synthesis. We found that there was a\n2-fold increase in acyl-coenzyme A diacylglycerol acyl-\ntransferases (DGAT1) and a 12-fold increase in HMG CoA\nFigure 5.Aliskiren and/or valsartan treatment prevented activation of profibrotic factors and proinflammatory factors in the\nkidneys of diabetic mice.Analysis of mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR for TGF, PAI-1, CTGF, MCP-1,TNF, and\nIL-1. *p<0.05 compared with controls (CTL); #p<0.05 compared with non-treated diabetic mice (DM), D-Ali: diabetes with aliskiren\ntreatment alone; D-Val: diabetes with valsartan treatment alone; D-AV: diabetes with aliskiren and valsartan treatment.\nFigure 4.Aliskiren and/or valsartan treatment improved morphological changes in the kidneys of diabetic mice.

In contrast to\nDGAT1, there were no changes in DGAT2 mRNA levels\n(not shown) among the groups.\nEffects of combination with aliskiren and\nvalsartan on ER stress\nDiabetic kidney disease is associated with activation of ER\nstress response; we therefore investigated protein expres-\nsion of two important markers of ER stress response: CHOP\n(C/EBP homologous protein) and XBP-1 (X-box binding\nprotein1). Western blots showed 1.5-fold increases of\nCHOP and XBP-1 protein expression in diabetic mice,\nwhich was completely suppressed by aliskiren, valsartan or\ncombination treatment at the same extent (Figure 7).\nEffects of combination with aliskiren and\nvalsartan on the RAAS\nAs shown in Table 2, intrarenal renin mRNA was dramati-\ncally induced in mice treated with aliskiren and/or valsartan,\ndue to disruption of the feedback loop, whereas (pro)renin\nreceptor expression was not significantly changed among\ngroups. We also examined the other components of the\nRAAS. The renal expression of ACE and ACE2 mRNA were\nsignificantly reduced in diabetic mice; combination treatment\nwas associated with recovery of their mRNA expression.\nInterestingly, Mas receptor mRNA and protein abundance\nwas significantly decreased in diabetic mice and combination\ntreatment with aliskiren and valsartan dramatically reversed\nMas receptor mRNA and protein abundance to non-diabetic\ncontrol level (Table 2 and Figure 8). Single treatment with\naliskiren or valsartan had no effects on Mas expression.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that aliskiren treat-\nment significantly ameliorated kidney injury in diabetic\nmice. Indeed, aliskiren was equally beneficial as valsartan\nin protecting kidney injury in diabetes, including improve-\nment of functional and structural changes and inhibition of\nfibrosis, inflammation, lipid accumulation and ER stress in\nthe kidney. Dual therapy with aliskiren and valsartan, in\nsome, but no in all aspects, produced additive and synergis-\ntic therapeutic effects in the treatment of DN.\nFigure 6.Aliskiren and or valsartan treatment prevented increase of lipid accumulation in the kidneys of diabetic mice.

There were decreases in podocyte abun-\ndance and distribution, and in slit diaphragm protein\nexpression, which were manifested by reduced expression\nof nephrin, synaptopodin, podocin and WT1 in diabetic\nanimals. Interestingly, monotherapy with aliskiren or vals-\nartan restored distribution and staining intensity of nephrin\nand synaptopodin and abundance of podocin and WT1 to a\nsimilar extent, suggesting a protective effect on structure of\npodocytes. Dual treatment with aliskiren and valsartan had\nbetter therapeutic effects on restoration of nephrin (glomer-\nular slit diaphragm) and synaptopodin (actin cytoskeleton)\nprotein expression, although it had no greater effect on\nalbuminuria.\nAlthough dual treatment was associated with a further\ndecrease of blood pressure when compared with either single\ntherapy group, animal studies in type II diabetic models (db/\ndb mice),9 STZ-induced diabetic rats5 and the AVOID clini-\ncal study24\u00ad26 have demonstrated that the anti-proteinuric\neffects of aliskiren with or without the AT1 receptor antago-\nnist were independent of its blood pressure lowering effect,\nsuggesting antagonism to the intra-renal RAAS with aliskiren\nor valsartan potentially playing an important role in kidney\nprotection. Functional expression of key components of the\nRAAS has been demonstrated in differentiated human podo-\ncytes27,28 and these podocytes are able to secrete AngII\nlocally. It is therefore likely that local RAAS blockade in the\nkidney may prevent AngII-induced damage of podocytes in\ndiabetic conditions.\nRenal damage in diabetes is associated with marked\nincreases in gene and protein expression of profibrotic and\nproinflammatory factors. TGF1 stimulates extracellular\nmatrix production and is a key growth factor in diabetic\nglomerulosclerosis.29,30 TGF1 is also a downstream target\nof AngII31 and can be up-regulated by renin in mesangial\ncells through the pro(renin) receptor independently of\nAngII.32\u00ad34 Treatments with aliskiren or valsartan signifi-\ncantly reduced the gene expression of TGF, CTGF and\nPAI-1 therefore preventing kidney injury in diabetes. In\naddition, at the doses used in this study aliskiren demon-\nstrated a better effect than valsartan in preventing increase\nof proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, MCP-1 and IL1-1\nin the kidneys of the diabetic mice. A recent study per-\nformed a dose-response curve of RAAS antagonism with\nFigure 7.Aliskiren and/or valsartan treatment prevented increased protein abundance of CHOP and XBP-1 in the kidney cortex\nof diabetic mice. *p<0.05 compared with controls (CTL); #p<0.05 compared with diabetic mice (DM), D-Ali: diabetes with aliskiren\ntreatment alone; D-Val: diabetes with valsartan treatment alone; D-AV: diabetes with aliskiren and valsartan treatment.\n392 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\naliskiren and losartan, and showed much higher doses of\naliskiren (50 mg/kg/day) and losartan (167mg/kg/day) than\nour studies, to yield equal RAAS inhibition.12 Due to such\na difference in dose response, we need to be cautious before\nwe can conclude if the two treatments have different effects\nor additive effects on target pathways.\nOne of novel findings in the present study is the improve-\nment in renal lipid accumulation by aliskiren and/or valsar-\ntan therapy. There is growing evidence for the role of\nabnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of renal dis-\nand proinflammatory cytokine production in the kidney\ncells, increase generation of reactive oxygen species and\nOil red O staining showed neutral lipid accumulation (cho-\nlesterol ester and triglycerides) in the diabetic kidney. The\nincrease in lipid staining was paralleled with increases in the\nmRNA level of DGAT1 that catalyzes terminal and the only\ncommitted step in triglyceride synthesis,38 and increased\nmRNAexpression of HMG CoAsynthase that is involved in\ncholesterol synthesis.39 Although aliskiren or valsartan pre-\nvented an increase of these two gene expression, dual treat-\nment with aliskiren and valsartan indeed induced\nimprovement in the alterations of renal lipid accumulation\n(oil red o staining) which is associated with reduced mRNA\nlevels in DGAT1 and HMG CoA synthase.

Aberrant meta-\nbolic conditions such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia\ncan affect ER trafficking, activate ER stress and corre-\nsponding three signaling pathways that generally relieve\nthe accumulation of misfolded or unfolded ER proteins.\nRecently, activation of ER stress response has been docu-\nmented in diabetic animals and patients with progressive\nDN (e.g. increased expression of CHOP and XBP-1).43\u00ad45\nAlthough the role of a classical marker of ER stress C/EBP\nhomologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor induces\napoptosis, in kidney injury is debatable,46 CHOP deficient\nmice were resistant to ER stress-induced cell death and\nDN,45 and consistent with this, expression of CHOP protein\nwas significantly increased in diabetic mice when com-\npared with controls. In the present study aliskiren with or\nwithout valsartan reduced CHOP and XBP-1 protein\nexpression, thus may attenuate ER stress response and pre-\nvent cells from injury and apoptosis in diabetic kidneys.\nHowever, how intracellular RAAS blockade by aliskiren or\nvalsartan and how renin or AngII was involved in ER stress\nin diabetic kidneys are still unknown. Interestingly, in con-\ntrast, tunicamycin induced-ER stress is associated with\nincreased activation of SREBP-2, a lipogenic transcription\nfactor, and increased do novo biosynthesis and accumula-\ntion of lipid in the proximal tubules.47 Further studies are\ntherefore warranted to clarify the complex, mechanistic\nlink between ER stress and lipid accumulation in the\nkidneys.\nIt is well known that angiotensin-converting-enzymes 2\n(ACE2) converts AngII to Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-7) exerts\nits effects on antagonizing AngII in the kidney through Mas\nreceptor.48,49 ACE2 gene deletion was recently found to\naccentuate diabetes-related glomerular damage50 whereas\nACE2 gene overexpression was found to ameliorate glo-\nmerular injury in DN.51 Interestingly, Ang-(1-7) improved\nlipid and glucose metabolism in transgenic rats with\nincreased circulating Ang-(1-7).52 In our studies single\ntreatment with aliskiren or valsartan did not prevent\ndecrease of Mas receptor expression in diabetic mice, but\ndual treatment with aliskiren and valsartan significantly\nincreased expression of Mas receptor mRNA and protein in\ndiabetic mice, indicating that dual or a more complete\nblockade of RAAS has an effect on activating the ACE2-\nAng-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. Although more complete\nblockade of the RAAS with renin inhibitor and ARBs have\nshown beneficial effects in renal protection in diabetes, in\nclinical practice, these were offset by a high risk of\nhyperkalemia and hypotension,53 which may be caused by\nsuppression of aldosterone and alteration of renal hemody-\nnamics. Whether the lack of protective components of\nRAAS cascade (such as ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor\naxis) is involved in such a consequence during dual block-\nade is still unknown. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren sup-\npresses production ofANG I (a substrate ofACE2) resulting\nin a decrease of Ang-(1-7), as seen in an experimental\nchronic allograft nephropathy.54 This showed better protec-\ntive effects of candesartan than aliskiren, which was likely\nto be due to lower generation of protective Ang-(1-7) in\nresponse to aliskiren when compared with candesartan.\nIncreased protein expression of Mas in dual treatments may\nbe a feedback to complete blockade of RAAS, but it may\nsuggest a potentially beneficial approach by combination\nwith activation of Ang-(1-7) and inhibition of AngII in dia-\nbetic kidney diseases.\nIn conclusion, the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren pro-\nvided a protective effect against renal damage in diabetic\nmice through inhibition of the profibrotic processes, inflam-\nmation and lipid accumulation, as well as prevention of the\nactivation of ER stress. Aliskiren showed equal therapeutic\nefficacy when compared with valsartan, and thus the poten-\ntial of aliskiren is at least comparable to that of valsartan in\nrenoprotection. For certain targets, dual blockade with\naliskiren and valsartan produced additive therapeutic\neffects in preventing the activation of cellular processes\nassociated with the pathogenesis and progression of DN.\n"
