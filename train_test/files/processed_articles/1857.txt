Youth who have low levels of physical activ-\nity and high levels of sedentary behavior are also more\nlikely to have lower cardiorespiratory fitness.\ncardiorespiratory fitness is in-\nversely associated with physi-\nologic risk factors for chronic\ndisease including high blood\npressure,1 hyperinsulinemia,2 fat mass,3\natherogenic lipid profile,4 insulin resis-\ntance,5 hemostaticandinflammatorymark-\ners,6 and clustering of metabolic risk fac-\ntors.7 Also, higher levels of fitness support\nparticipation in sports and other physi-\ncally demanding leisure activities.

The purpose of this article is to present findings\nof NHANES for youth between ages 12 and 19 years.\nAssociations between cardiorespiratory fitness and\ndemographic characteristics will be reported as well as\nassociations with select self-reported physical activity\nbehaviors.\nMETHODS\nThe NHANES is designed to monitor the health and nutri-\ntional status of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-\ntion. The surveys are conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention.20 Since 1999, a nationally representative sample has\nbeen selected annually using a stratified multistage probabil-\nity cluster sample design. Data are released in 2-year periods\ndividuals, adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, persons 60 years and\nolder, low-income white individuals, and pregnant women were\nfor these groups. This report is based on data from the 1999-\nproved by the National Center for Health Statistics institu-\ntional review board, and written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants 18 years and older. In addition to the con-\nsent provided by parents or guardians, written informed as-\nsent was also obtained for adolescents younger than 18 years.\nSUBJECTS\nThe NHANES protocol consists of a household interview fol-\nlowed by an examination at a mobile examination center. In\nviewed at home, and of these, 4732 individuals (97%) were ex-\namined at the mobile examination center. Of those, 522 (11%)\nwere excluded from the fitness test for a variety of reasons, in-\ncluding pregnancy, physical limitations, and cardiovascular and\nasthma conditions or symptoms.23 Of those eligible to partici-\npate in the fitness test, 923 (20%) did not have their fitness level\nestimated for a variety of reasons, including insufficient time\nto conduct the test, refusal, equipment problems, prematurely\nterminated tests because of safety concerns, and insufficient heart\nrate response to classify fitness level (ie, the change in heart\nrate between the 2 exercise stages was less than 8 beats/min).\nComplete fitness data on 3287 individuals (69%) are included\nin the present analyses. Sex, race/ethnicity, age, body mass in-\ndex (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height\nin meters squared), and activity levels of this analytic sample\nwere comparable with the overall sample that was examined\nin the mobile examination center (Table 1).\nCardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a submaximal tread-\nmill exercise test. The treadmill test consisted of a 2-minute\nwarm-up, followed by two 3-minute work stages, and a 2-minute\ncooldown period. Blood pressure, rating of perceived exer-\ntion,24 and heart rate were obtained during each of the stages.\nThe Jackson nonexercise test formula was used to predict each\nparticipant's fitness level prior to the treadmill test, based on\nhis or her age, sex, BMI, and self-reported physical activity level.25\nFrom this prediction, 1 of the 8 protocols was selected for each\nparticipant.23 The goal of the test was to elicit a heart rate that\nis approximately 80% of age-predicted maximum (220-age)\nby the end of the second exercise stage.23\nThe main outcome of the cardiorespiratory fitness test is es-\ntimated maximal oxygen uptake (V\n). It was estimated by\nextrapolation to an expected age-specific maximal heart rate us-\ning measured heart rate responses to the two 3-minute exercise\nstages.26 It was assumed that the relationship between heart rate\nand oxygen consumption is linear during treadmill exercise. Be-\ncause true V\nvalues greater than 75 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 are quite\nrare, we assumed such values to be overestimates and they were\nincluded a Quinton MedTrack ST65 Treadmill (Quinton, Deer-\nfield,Wis)andaColinSTBP-780AutomaticBloodPressureMoni-\ntor (Colin Medical Instruments Corp, San Antonio, Tex) to mea-\nsure heart rate and blood pressure.

Self-reported information on\nrace and ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and other. Because of the\nsmall sample size of the \"other\" group, no separate estimates\nwere presented for persons classified as \"other,\" but they are\nincluded in the total population estimates. Measured weight\nand height were used to calculate BMI. The 2000 Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention Growth Charts for the United\nStates were used to define normal weight, at risk for over-\nweight, and overweight.27 Normal weight is defined as less than\nthe 85th percentile of BMI for age, at risk for overweight is de-\nfined as at or higher than the 85th percentile but less than the\n95th percentile of BMI for age, and overweight is defined as at\nor higher than the 95th percentile of BMI for age.\nPhysical Activity Variables\nSelf-reported physical activity variables were dichotomized into\nyes or no for activities performed during the last 30 days. The\nactivities included walking or biking as part of getting to and\nfrom work, school, or errands; moderate-intensity physical ac-\ntivities performed for at least 10 minutes that cause light sweat-\ning or slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate;\nvigorous-intensity physical activities performed for at least 10\nminutes that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breath-\ning or heart rate; and physical activities specifically designed\nto strengthen muscles, such as lifting weights, push-ups, or sit-\nups. Additionally, participants were asked if their amount of\nactivity during the past 30 days was more, less, or about the\nsame as others of the same age and sex.\nSedentary activity questions differed by age group. Partici-\npants aged 16 to 19 years reported the amount of time on a typi-\ncal day during the past 30 days that they spent sitting and watch-\ning television or videos or using a computer outside of work.\nChildren aged 12 to 15 years were asked about television view-\ning and computer use/computer games separately, in refer-\nence to the previous day. The 2 questions were summed. Re-\nsponses were dichotomized into fewer than 3 hours and 3 or\nmore hours per day.\nParticipants were also asked to identify the type, frequency,\nand duration of moderate and vigorous physical activities they\nparticipatedinduringthepast30days.Allreportedactivitieswere\nassigned a MET (metabolic equivalent unit) (1 MET=3.5 mL\n\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) value based on reported intensity.28 The number\nof times an activity was performed was multiplied by the num-\nber of minutes and the MET value. The total MET score was then\ndivided by 30 to obtain MET minutes per day for each reported\nactivity. To correct for gross errors, reported frequency and du-\nration higher than the 99th percentile (90 times per 30 days and\nrespectively, for the analysis. MET minutes of moderate to vig-\norous physical activity (MVPA) were calculated by totaling ac-\ntivities with a MET value of 3 or more. MET minutes of vigorous\nphysical activity (VPA) were calculated by totaling the activities\nwith a MET value of 6 or more. Participants received a score of\nzero if they did not report any individual activity and responded\nno to participation in moderate physical activity or VPA during\nVPA). Participants were categorized into tertiles (low, interme-\ndiate, high) of MVPA and VPA for analyses.\nParticipants were classified into 2 fitness levels based on the\nFITNESSGRAM Standards for Healthy Fitness Zone.29,30 Males\nwere classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM standards. Girls\nrespectively, were classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM stan-\nor higher were classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM stan-\ndards.\nAll analyses were conducted separately for males and females.\nMeans and deciles of estimated V\nwere calculated for 4\nage groups. One-way analyses of variance using estimated V\nas the dependent variable were conducted for demographic,\nweight status, and physical activity variables and by tertiles of\nMET minutes of physical activity. The trends of V\nby ter-\ntiles of MET minutes of MVPA and VPA were also tested. Sample\nweights were used to account for differential probabilities of\nselection, noncoverage, and nonresponse to the examina-\ntion.31 Standard errors were calculated using the Taylor series\nlinearization method. Statistical significance was defined as\n=.05. Paired comparisons were done within each category\nwhen the testing for analysis of variance was significant. The\nBonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple compari-\nsons. Thus, for age group comparisons, =.008 was used and\nfor weight status, MVPA, and VPA, =.017 was used for sig-\nnificance level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS\nRESULTS\nPercentiles for estimated V\nare presented in Table 2\nby sex and age group. Generally, among males, older par-\nticipants had higher V\nvalues, while in females,\nyounger participants had higher values.\nEstimated V\nis presented by demographic groups,\nweight status, and FITNESSGRAM categories in Table 3.\nEstimated V\nwas higher in males than females. In\nmales, estimated V\nwas significantly lower in 12-\nand 13-year-olds than in the other age groups. Males in\nthe normal weight group had significantly higher esti-\nmated V\nthan those in the at risk for overweight and\noverweight groups, and a higher percentage of older males\nmet the FITNESSGRAM standards. In females, esti-\nmated V\nwas significantly lower in older females\nyears). Females in the normal weight group had higher\nestimated V\nthan the females in the at risk for over-\nweight and overweight groups. There were no differ-\nences among the age groups for females meeting the\nFITNESSGRAM standards.\nTable 4 shows the comparison of the estimated V\namong physical activity variable categories. Males who\ncommuted through walking or biking, participated in\nVPA, or did strengthening exercise during the past 30\ndays were fitter than males who did not report these ac-\ntivities.

An accepted criterion measure of car-\ndiorespiratory fitness is maximal oxygen consumption,\nV\n, measured by gas exchange during performance\nof exhaustive exercise. The submaximal treadmill test used\nin NHANES involves applying the slope of the heart rate\nresponse to submaximal exercise in estimating V\n,\na procedure that has been well validated.34 As such, the\ndata presented in this report provide a valid character-\nization of the cardiorespiratory fitness levels of contem-\nporary American youth. This information is important\nbecause it provides a basis for monitoring future trends\nin physical fitness in the population of 12- to 19-year-\nold youth in the United States. In addition, these data pro-\nvide population norms against which individuals and\ngroups of youth can be compared.\nNational population-based surveys in the United States\nRecent surveys have demonstrated a marked increase in\ndition, many have suggested that physical fitness has de-\nclined in American youth during this same period.38 Physi-\ncal fitness was surveyed in representative samples of\nAmerican youth on several occasions between the late\ndures used to measure physical fitness varied from sur-\nvey to survey, and none of the previous national surveys\nused controlled testing procedures such as those used in\nthe present survey. Consequently, it is not possible to de-\ntermine whether there have been population-level changes\nin fitness in American youth during the past several de-\ncades. However, the present study includes some infor-\nmation that may bear on this issue. As shown by the data\nin Table 3, weight status was associated with fitness, with\noverweight and at-risk-for-overweight males and fe-\nmales showing lower cardiorespiratory fitness than their\nnormal-weight peers. This suggests that population-\nlevel increases in the prevalence of obesity are likely to\nbeassociatedwithdecreasedcardiorespiratoryfitness.This\nwould be expected when fitness is measured with a\nweight-bearing task such as treadmill walking or run-\nning, because greater weight requires more energy to be\nexpended at any specified speed of movement. Nonethe-\nless, a clear demonstration of a secular decline in physi-\ncal fitness in American youth must await the result of fu-\nture surveys using methods comparable with those used\nin this and/or earlier surveys.\nOne method for interpreting physical fitness levels of\nyouth is to apply criterion-referenced standards that are\nTable 4.

Such an ap-\nproach is used by FITNESSGRAM, a fitness testing pro-\ngram that has been used by more than 18 000 schools\nand school districts nationally. The criterion-referenced\nstandards used by FITNESSGRAM were developed by an\nexpert panel, and for cardiorespiratory fitness, the stan-\ndards for maximal oxygen uptakes are 42 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1\nfor females.29 When these standards are applied to the\ngroup measured in this study, approximately 65% of both\nmales and females meet the standards. This indicates that\nroughly one third of US youth aged 12 to 19 years fail to\nmeet the levels of cardiorespiratory fitness deemed ap-\npropriate by experts.\nThe findings presented in this report confirm the fre-\nquently observed sex difference in cardiorespiratory en-\ndurance. Mean estimated V\nwas approximately 17%\nlower in girls than boys in the overall sample, and the\nsex difference increased with increasing age from about\n19-year-olds. These differences are comparable with those\nreported in previous surveys.14,39 The widening sex dif-\nference with increasing age was due to countervailing age-\nrelated differences in the 2 sexes. Fitness increased with\nage in males but decreased with age in females, and these\nchanges were statistically significant in both sexes. This\nmay be explained by physical developmental factors, such\nas sex-related changes in lean weight and fat weight dur-\ning puberty.40 However, some studies have shown that\nthe sex difference in physical activity levels widens dur-\ning adolescence, so it may be that rapidly declining physi-\ncal activity in females may partially explain the age-\nrelated trends in physical fitness.41,42\nIn this study, fitness did not differ across the 3 race/\nethnicity groups observed. Most previous national sur-\nveys of fitness in children and youth did not report data\nsurvey in the 1960s did find higher cardiorespiratory fit-\nness in black youth than white youth.14 That observa-\ntion is inconsistent with the findings of most studies using\nsmaller samples that were not nationally representative.\nSeveral of these studies have observed higher fitness in\nwhite than black adolescents.2,43 The present study is\nunique because the sampling protocol ensured that na-\ntionally representative samples of non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Mexican American males and\nfemales were included. The findings provide no indica-\ntion that cardiorespiratory fitness varied across those 3\nIn general, youth who reported higher levels of physi-\ncal activity had higher levels of cardiorespiratory fit-\nness. Those who reported participating in VPA during\nthe past 30 days and those who were in the upper tertile\nof MET minutes per day of MVPA and VPA were more\nfit than other participants. Although these findings sug-\ngest that higher levels of physical activity result in higher\nlevels of fitness, the data are cross-sectional and the di-\nrection of causality cannot be determined. It may be that\nyoung people who have higher cardiorespiratory fitness\nfind it easier or more enjoyable to participate in physi-\ncal activity. The only exception to the activity-fitness pat-\ntern was for moderate physical activity in the past 30 days;\nthose who reported participating in moderate physical\nactivity during the past 30 days did not have higher fit-\nness levels than those who did not report such activity.\nThis may be due to inaccuracies in the classification and\nreporting of moderate activity by children and youth or\nto the fact that VPA explains more of the variance in fit-\nness than moderate activity.44 In addition to a positive\nrelationship between physical activity and fitness, we also\nobserved a negative relationship between sedentary ac-\ntivity and fitness. Participants who reported 3 or more\nhours per day of television, video, and computer use had\nlower levels of fitness than those who reported less than\n3 hours of these activities. This finding differs from pre-\nvious studies that found no significant relationship be-\ntween television watching and fitness.45,46 The inclusion\nof other electronic media, in addition to television, in the\npresent study may provide a more accurate estimate of\nthe amount of time that children and youth spend in sed-\nentary activity.\nThe findings of this study suggest that one third of\nyouth aged 12 to 19 years in the United States has low\nlevels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Low cardiorespira-\ntory fitness, a strong and independent risk factor for car-\ndiovascular disease,47,48 is known to track from adoles-\ncence to adulthood.49,50 Further, it has been shown that\nlow cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence predicts adult\nbody fatness,51 large-artery stiffness,52 poor lipid pro-\nfiles,53,54 and low physical activity levels.55 Accordingly,\nbecause highly active youth tend to manifest higher lev-\nels of cardiorespiratory fitness, several expert panels have\nrecommended that physicians counsel pediatric and ado-\nlescent patients and their parents about the importance\nof meeting current physical activity guidelines.19,56,57 Iden-\ntifying youth who are at elevated risk for low cardiovas-\ncular fitness is important because fitness testing is im-\npractical in most clinical settings. The findings of this\nstudy suggest that youth who have high BMI, low levels\nof physical activity, and high levels of sedentary behav-\nior are likely to have low cardiorespiratory fitness.\nStrengths of this study include the large sample size,\nthe racial and ethnic diversity of the participants, and the\nuse of a standardized testing protocol. The use of a sub-\nmaximal exercise test for estimating V\nis a poten-\ntial weakness of this study, because submaximal tests are\nless accurate than maximal exercise tests. However, maxi-\nmal exercise tests are considered impractical for use in\npopulation-based studies. Another potential limitation\nis the response rate of 69%; however, as demonstrated\nin Table 1, youth included in our study sample were de-\nmographically comparable with the total sample exam-\nined in the mobile examination center.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, estimated V\nhigher in males than females and lower in overweight than\nnormal weight youth but not different across the 3 race/\nethnic groups observed (non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, non-Hispanic white).
