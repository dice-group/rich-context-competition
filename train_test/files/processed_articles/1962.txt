We hy-\npothesized that greater practice resources (including fewer\ntime pressures), the presence of care management sup-\nports, and indicators of more established referral net-\nworks and integration would be associated with greater\ncommunication regarding referrals and consultations. We\nwere particularly interested in 3 modifiable factors: ad-\nequacy of patient visit time (as a proxy for time for com-\nmunication and practice resources), use of HIT to com-\nmunicate regarding patients, and use of nonphysician staff\nto support care management.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed a national stratified random sample of 4720 phy-\nsicians from the 2008 Health System Change Health Tracking\nPhysician Survey. Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation, it is the fifth in a series of nationally representative phy-\nsician surveys conducted since 1996 by the Center for Study-\ning Health System Change.20 The sampling frame included active\nlicensed allopathic and osteopathic physicians and was drawn\nfrom the American Medical Association master file. The mail\nsurvey achieved a 61.9% response rate. Characteristics of phy-\nsicians who completed the survey and those who refused to par-\nticipate were similar.20 All survey items have been validated\nthrough successful use in other surveys or cognitive testing.\nRespondents must have completed their medical training\nand provide direct patient care for at least 20 hours per week.\nPhysicians with minimal direct patient contact (eg, radiolo-\ngists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists), federal employees,\nand temporarily licensed foreign medical graduates were in-\neligible. Additional background information is available at http:\n//www.hschange.org/CONTENT/1085/. An institutional re-\nview board approved the survey and procedures.\nThe PCPs included family practice, general practice, gen-\neral internal medicine, geriatric, internal medicine\u00adpediatric,\nand general pediatric physicians. Before combining all special-\nists within 1 group, we analyzed several subgroups separately\n(eg, types of surgeons with differing needs to communicate with\nPCPs and cognitive vs procedural specialists).\nCare coordination requires that PCPs referring patients to spe-\ncialists communicate timely, relevant patient information and\nthe reason for the referral and that specialists communicate find-\nings and recommendations back to the PCP.21 Equally impor-\ntant is the receipt and recognition of this information by the\nrespective parties.1 On the basis of primary care and chronic\ncare frameworks,1,22 we examined factors hypothesized to in-\nfluence these components of communication.\nWe used 4 questions adapted from the Primary Care\nAssessment Tool, Provider Survey.23 We asked PCPs, \"When\nreferring a patient to a specialist, how often do you send the\nspecialist notification of the patient's history and the reason\nfor consultation?\" and \"How often do you receive useful\ninformation about your referred patients from specialists?\"\nWe asked specialists, \"When you see a patient referred to you\nby a PCP, how often do you receive notification of the\npatient's medical history and reason for consultation?\" and\n\"For patients who were referred to you by a PCP, how often\ndo you send the PCP notification of the results of your con-\nsultation and advice to the patient?\" Response options were\n\"always,\" \"most of the time,\" \"sometimes,\" \"seldom or never,\"\nand \"not applicable.\"\nReports of communication receipt reflect other physicians'\nsending behavior and the receiving organization's ability to get\ncommunications to the appropriate physician when needed.\nThus, results regarding communication receipt may reflect the\ncharacteristics of physicians in the referral network and those\nof the receiving practice.\nIndependent variables of primary interest were organized con-\nceptually into the 3 areas related to our hypotheses. We recog-\nnizethatsome(eg,practicetypeandsize)mightfitintoall3areas.\nWe asked physicians about the extent to which they thought\nthey had adequate time to spend with their patients during of-\nfice visits (Likert scale responses ranging from \"agree strongly\"\nto \"disagree strongly\") and the practices' payer mix (percent-\nage of Medicare and Medicaid revenue). Because practices car-\ning for patients with more complex and comorbid conditions\nface greater coordination challenges, we assessed whether the\npractice cared for patients with 1 or more of 4 prevalent and\ncostly chronic conditions (eg, asthma, diabetes mellitus, de-\npression, and congestive heart failure) and the percentage of\nthe physician's patients with any chronic condition.\nOther independent variables relevant to practice resources\nand physician time pressures were practice type and size and\nphysician base compensation method. We also included phy-\nsician reports of the importance of quality measures, patient\nsatisfaction surveys, productivity, practice profiling, and prac-\ntice financial performance in determining compensation (mod-\nerately or very important vs somewhat or not important).\nPractice supports for patients with chronic conditions indi-\ncate a capacity for care management and are hypothesized to\nbe associated with communication in connection with consul-\ntations and referrals. These supports include (1) nonphysi-\ncian patient educators, (2) nurse care managers, and (3) the\nreceipt by the physician of quality reports regarding his/her pa-\ntients with chronic conditions.22-24 These items were asked of\nphysicians in practices treating any 1 of 4 prevalent chronic con-\nditions (eg, asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or de-\npression). In the logistic regression models, a dummy variable\nwas included to capture physicians in practices that did not pro-\nvide care for patients with any of these 4 conditions.\nWe also assessed the presence and use of HIT in the prac-\ntice, focusing on elements with the potential to support com-\nmunication and information sharing. After assessing them in-\ndividually, we created a summary measure of 3 HIT tools most\nrelevant to coordination: (1) whether the respondent's main\npractice uses an electronic medical record (EMR) (all paper,\n0; part electronic, 1; and all electronic, 2); (2) whether the phy-\nsician routinely used HIT for accessing patient notes, problem\nlists, and medication lists (no, 0; yes, 1); and (3) whether the\nphysician routinely used HIT to exchange clinical data with other\nphysicians (no, 0; yes, 1). We summed responses and then cat-\negorized them as high (3-4), partial (1-2), or none (0). The rate\nof e-mail use for communication with other physicians regard-\ning patients was too low to be included in the analysis.\nWe included proxy variables that helped capture the extent to\nwhich physicians have more vs less established referral net-\nworks with other physicians: physician years in practice (11,\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\n11-20, 20), based on prior findings that physicians in prac-\ntice longer have more established working relationships with\nother physicians; rural vs urban location; independent physi-\ncian ownership; practice type (group or staff model health main-\ntenance organization [HMO] vs community health center vs\nother practice types) and group practice size (number of phy-\nsicians); number of managed care contracts; and percentage of\npractice revenue under capitation.\nWe controlled for additional physician factors, including sex,\nboard certification, medical training location (United States or\nCanada vs elsewhere), and specialty.1,2,6,25 We also controlled\nfor geographic region, physicians' assessment of \"market com-\npetitiveness,\" and county ratio of PCP-to-specialist supply.\nWe examined univariate frequencies of all variables, correla-\ntions among independent variables, and the bivariate associa-\ntions between independent and outcome variables. Tests for mul-\ntiple comparisons of the bivariate proportions were conducted,\nand they did not differ significantly from the raw P values. On\nthe basis of these analyses and the clinical and policy relevance\nof particular factors within the primary care and chronic care con-\nceptual frameworks, we built logistic regression models. The goal\nof our multivariate logistic regressions was to examine the asso-\nciation between the key modifiable independent variables (eg, ad-\nequate time with patients) and each binary outcome (eg, sends\ninformation regarding a referral or consultation), adjusting for\nall other practice factors and potential confounders.\nA separate logistic regression model was created for each of\nthe 4 coordination outcome measures.

Specialist subgroup results were\nconsistent, with only minor differences in magnitude but not\nin direction of the associations; therefore, only combined spe-\ncialist results are given.\nWe determined present adjusted percentages from final par-\nsimonious models. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests indicated good fit\nof the data. Also, SUDAAN software, version 10.0 (Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) was\nused to analyze the data that were weighted for probability of\nselection and survey nonresponse. Unadjusted analyses were\nlargely consistent with the multivariate logistic regression re-\nsults and thus are not presented.\nFinally, we calculated the predicted increase in interspecialty\ncommunication as each of the 4 key practice supports (HIT use,\nadequatevisittime,qualityreportsregardingpatientswithchronic\nconditions, and a nurse care manager) is added for an average\nrespondent,holdingallothercovariatesattheirmeans.Thesesimu-\nlations are based on estimates from the multivariate logistic re-\ngression models.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the sample characteristics.

The PCPs and specialists who re-\nported not consistently receiving communications re-\ngarding referrals and consultations were significantly\nmore likely to report that their ability to provide high-\nquality care was threatened because of failure to receive\ntimely reports (Table 3). This finding suggests poor\ncommunication threatens quality of care and supports\nour outcome measures' content validity.\nFor PCPs and specialists, \"having adequate time to spend\nwith patients during the office visit\" was the factor with\nthe greatest positive association with each communica-\ntion outcome (Table 4 and Table 5). Although phy-\nsicians with higher proportions of patients with chronic\nconditions were more likely to report sending notifica-\ntion to their colleagues, they were also more likely to re-\nport that receipt of timely reports from other physicians\nwas a problem (data not shown).\nReceipt of quality reports regarding patients with chronic\nconditions was positively associated with 3 of 4 out-\ncomes (Table 4 and Table 5). The involvement of a nurse\nat the practice to help treat patients with chronic condi-\ntions was associated with greater receipt of communica-\ntion regarding referrals and consultations.

The PCPs\nand specialists reporting inconsistent receipt of commu-\nnications from other physicians were significantly more\nlikely to report that their ability to provide high-quality\ncare was threatened because of failure to receive timely\nreports.\nThe significant differences in PCPs' and specialists' per-\nceptions of the extent to which they communicate with\none another regarding referrals and consultations may\nhave various causes, including overstatement of send-\ning behaviors and understatement of receipt. Although\nour questions asked specifically about patients referred\nby PCPs, specialists may have misattributed some pa-\ntient self-referrals as PCP referrals. In addition, process\nfailures, such as late or misdirected reports and reports\nnot placed in the patient's record in a timely fashion at\nthe recipient practice, may affect responses regarding re-\nceipt despite timely sending.\nCOMMUNICATION\nPractice Resources and Time Pressures\nThe factor most consistently and strongly associated with\ninterspecialty communication was \"adequate time with a\npatientduringtheofficevisit.\"Inaddition,PCPsweremore\nlikely to believe that they do not have adequate time to\nspend with patients during office visits than were special-\nists. This likely occurred because of the complex nature\nof primary care, which involves longitudinal care over time\nand coordination of a patient's care across various condi-\ntions.1 Increased administrative burden (eg, health plan\nprior authorizations) and decreasing reimbursements\ncreate pressures for physicians to see more patients26 and\ndecrease the time available for effective communica-\ntions regarding referrals and consultations during and af-\nter the visit. The average primary care face-to-face visit\nmethod,27,28 and time pressures during the visit result in\nlower-quality care, including poorer patient and physi-\ncian care experiences.29,30 Our findings complement these\nprior studies. With more encounter time, the physician\nand staff can focus more completely on the patient's needs,\nwhich may include initiating referral and consultation\ncommunication and retrieving reports from other\nphysicians.\nOverall, payment factors, as measured by this sur-\nvey, had inconsistent and little association with inter-\nspecialty communication. Most current compensation\nmethods do not incentivize communication. Practice sup-\nports may be more important to facilitating interspe-\ncialty communication, at least in the predominant fee-\nfor-service environment.\nCare Management Supports\nThe positive association between receipt of quality reports\nregarding patients with chronic conditions and interspe-\ncialty communication regarding referrals and consulta-\ntions suggests the potential benefits of providing perfor-\nmance feedback to physicians. Such feedback may help\nidentify gaps in care and spur physicians to communicate\nwith others sharing care for patients. Practice environ-\nments where quality reports are generated may also have\ncultures or mechanisms to facilitate referral and consulta-\ntion reports or follow-up when communications are not\nreceived.\nIt is notable that significantly fewer specialists re-\nceived quality reports compared with PCPs for their pa-\ntients with chronic conditions. Given the positive asso-\nciation between quality report receipt and communication\nlevels between PCPs and specialists, increased attention\nto providing specialists with such quality reports might\nbeindicated.Inaddition,incorporatinginterphysiciancom-\nmunication measures into such reports might help im-\nprove coordination.\nThe association between having a nurse in the prac-\ntice help coordinate care for patients with chronic con-\nditions and greater receipt of interspecialty communi-\ncation may reflect efforts by the nurse to reach out to other\npractices to obtain referral or consultation letters. This\nis a particularly important function for overwhelmed prac-\ntices, although few have the resources to provide nurse\ncare managers and few payers compensate for this. Even\nin primary care practices that lack nurse care managers,\nthe presence of nonphysician staff to educate patients with\nchronic conditions was beneficially associated with the\nsending of reports from one practice to another.\nThe positive association between HIT use and send-\ning or receiving information among specialists, but not\namong PCPs, may reflect that specialists are more likely\nto work in large or institutional settings with available\nHIT.31 Use of HIT in this national sample was higher\nthan prior estimates,32 which used different measures of\nHIT use, but closer to a recent publication of data from\nthe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which\nfound that 41.5% of physicians reported using all or\npartial EMR systems.33 Outside large integrated health\ncare systems and large multispecialty groups, however,\nlack of interoperability, current EMR design, and lim-\nTable 3.

The survey also\nhad a high response rate for a physician survey, and we\ncontrolled for a wide range of physician, practice, and\nmarket characteristics.\nThe study's limitations include the use of physician\nself-reportdatathat,giventhestudy'snationalscope,could\nnot feasibly be validated by medical record reviews. We\nalso lack information on the accuracy, comprehensive-\nness, and timing of communication. However, our na-\ntional sample's self-reported rates of sending or receiv-\ning communication regarding referrals and consultations\nare within the range reported in the literature.2,6,10-13 Re-\ngardless, potential self-report bias (owing to social de-\nsirability) should not systematically affect the direction\nof associations. Finally, the cross-sectional design does\nnot permit causal attribution.\nAlthough we are unable to fully capture the con-\nstructs of practice resources and pressures and referral\nnetworks and integration, the individual items exam-\nined can help inform policy and clinical initiatives by iden-\ntifying how resources might be focused to improve com-\nmunication regarding referrals and consultations. Our\nresults suggest that supporting PCPs so that they, for ex-\nample, can afford nurse care managers may facilitate ad-\nequate communication with specialists.\nIMPLICATIONS\nEfforts to improve coordination should address the low\nrates of interspecialty communication regarding refer-\nrals and consultations. Current initiatives such as patient-\ncentered medical homes, HIT, and ACOs have the po-\ntential to strengthen financial incentives, structures, and\ncare processes to support communication. Combined with\nmedical home experiments, our findings can help in-\nform these initiatives, suggesting ways to focus re-\nsources to support infrastructure and measurement of in-\nterspecialty communication. Targeted support for\ncapabilities identified in this study as being associated\nwith good bilateral communication--adequate visit time\nwith patients, quality reports regarding patients with\nchronic conditions, and nurse support for coordination--\nmay help advance the communication that is critical to\ncare coordination and the success of policy efforts to im-\nprove it. Such input might also support larger organiza-\ntional efforts; for example, ACOs may help to define a\ntight referral network and shared accountability for pa-\ntients, whereas the patient-centered medical home within\nan ACO can focus on care management and serve as the\nhub of coordination efforts.\nIn conclusion, systematic structures, tools, and pro-\ncesses for information creation,36 transfer, receipt, and\nrecognition by the sending and receiving physicians are\nneeded to assist medical practices. Measures of \"mean-\ningful HIT use\"14 and coordination of care could in-\nclude items that support, track, and confirm comple-\ntion of each of these tasks.\nCorrespondence: Ann S.

A recent study4 found that in caring for 100\nMedicarepatients,theaveragePCPneedstocoordinatecare\nwith 99 other physicians working across 53 practices.\nO'Malley and Reschovsky use a large, nationally rep-\nresentative sample of physicians to rigorously confirm a\nproblem that previously has been reported in smaller, lo-\ncalized studies. Despite the wide recognition that PCP-\nspecialist communication is critical for high-quality pa-\ntient care, the authors found that communication between\nPCPs and specialists occurs inconsistently.
