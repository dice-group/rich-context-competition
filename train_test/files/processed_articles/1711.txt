Boys had a 2.4-fold higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than girls (95% CI\n1.3\u00ad4.3). Non-Hispanic blacks had a lower rate than non-Hispanic whites (PR 0.6, 95% CI\n0.4\u00ad0.9). Overweight adolescents had a 2.6-fold higher rate than those with normal weight\n(1.3\u00ad5.1). Adolescents with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors had a 2.7-fold higher rate\nthan those with none (1.5\u00ad4.8). Adolescents with hyperinsulinemia had a fourfold higher\nprevalence (2.2\u00ad7.4) than those without. Neither overweight nor number of cardiometabolic\nrisk factors was significantly associated with pre-diabetes after adjustment for hyperinsulinemia.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Pre-diabetes was highly prevalent among adolescents. Hyperinsulin-\nemia was independently associated with pre-diabetes and may account for the association of\noverweight and clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors with pre-diabetes.\nIndividuals with impaired fasting glu-\ncose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tol-\nerance (IGT) are at increased risk for\ndiabetes and cardiovascular-related death\n(1,2). The state of abnormal glucose me-\ntabolism characterized as IFG and/or IGT\nhas been referred to as \"pre-diabetes\" (3).\nPrevious studies of IGT among chil-\ndren and adolescents have been largely\nlimited to those with obesity, a family his-\ntory of diabetes, or multiple cardiometa-\nbolic risk factors. The prevalence\nestimates of IGT varied from 4 to 21% in\nprevious studies (4\u00ad7). Although IGT\nprevalence estimates among overweight\nadolescents is helpful in understanding\nthe absolute health risk associated with\nIGT in this special population, the relative\nhealth burden of IGT among overweight\nadolescents compared with that among\nadolescents of normal weight has not\nbeen established.

Pre-diabetes risk was\npositively associated with being male and\nhaving hyperinsulinemia and negatively\nassociated with being a non-Hispanic\nblack. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia ap-\npeared to account for the association of\nweight status and clustering of cardiovas-\ncular risk factors with pre-diabetes.\nThe prevalence of IGT has been found\nto be high among adolescents with obe-\nsity (21%) (5) or those with a positive\nfamily history of type 2 diabetes (25%) (6)\nand in particular among those with both\nobesity and a positive family history of\nseveral school-based studies have re-\nported a relatively low prevalence of IGT.\nIn Poland, the prevalence of IGT was\nfound to be 0.3% among all children and\namong those who were obese (8). The re-\nsults of the Studies to Treat or Prevent\nPediatric Type 2 Diabetes (STOPP-T2D)\nindicated that the prevalence of IGT was\n2.3% among all eighth graders in four\nmiddle schools of Southern California,\nTexas, and North Carolina but 4.1%\namong those who were overweight (9). In\nthe Princeton School District of Cincin-\nnati (10), IGT was detected among only\nthat sampling and geographic variations\nmay account for these low prevalences.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study is\nthe first report on the prevalence estimate\nof IGT using a nationally representative\nsample of U.S. adolescents. Our IGT prev-\nalence estimates among all adolescents\n(3.4%) and among overweight adoles-\ncents (9.5%) were lower than the rates\nreported in clinic-based studies but\nhigher than the rates reported in school-\nbased studies.\nOur estimated IFG prevalence of\n(11). Rapid increases in the prevalence of\ncentral obesity (19) among adolescents\nmay be a factor in the increased preva-\nlence of IFG. Our results indicated that\noverweight adolescents had a nearly two-\nfold higher prevalence of IFG than did\nthose with normal weight.\nIt is noteworthy that adolescents with\ntwo or more of the four cardiometabolic\nrisk factors (i.e., central obesity, high tri-\nglyceride, low HDL cholesterol, and ele-\nvated blood pressure) had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of pre-diabetes than\nthose with zero or one risk factor. These\nfindings, which were in agreement with\nthose from previous studies (6,7), have\nseveral clinical implications. The pres-\nence of two or more cardiometabolic risk\nfactors among adolescents may be an in-\ndication that their pre-diabetes status\nshould be assessed. Because pre-diabetes\nis an intermediate stage in the develop-\nment of type 2 diabetes and has been\nshown to be reversible through pharma-\ncological and lifestyle interventions (20),\nTable 2--Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios for pre-diabetes among nondiabetic U.S.\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nAge (years)\nWeight status\nNumber of cardiometabolic\nrisk factors\nHyperinsulinemia\u00a7\nData are prevalence ratios (95% CI).

In one previous study, insulin\nresistance was found to be the best pre-\ndictor of 2-h plasma glucose in an OGTT\namong obese adolescents (5). It has been\nproposed that insulin resistance is a major\nunderlying cause of type 2 diabetes (21),\nand intramyocellular and intra-abdominal\nlipid accumulation is highly associated\nwith the development of insulin resis-\ntance (22). Our results indicated that\nhyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance\nmay play an important role in the associ-\nation of obesity and clustering of cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors with pre-diabetes.\nThe prevalence of hyperinsulinemia has\nincreased by 35% in the past decade\namong U.S. adults (23). Therefore, early\nidentification and effective treatment\nof insulin resistance could prevent or\ndelay the occurrence of pre-diabetes and\ndiabetes among both adolescents and\nSimilar to the finding of a previous\nstudy (10), our results demonstrated that\nonly 2.9% of adolescents with glucose in-\ntolerance had both IFG and IGT. IFG and\nIGT may identify different populations at\nrisk of developing diabetes. It has been\nproposed that IFG and IGT represent dis-\ntinct metabolic abnormalities with differ-\nent etiological mechanisms, with IFG\nbeing caused by impaired basal insulin\nsecretion and IGT being caused primarily\nby peripheral insulin resistance (25). De-\nspite these etiological differences, how-\never, IFG and IGT have both been\nassociated with an increased risk of devel-\noping diabetes and subsequent cardiovas-\ncular disease (1\u00ad3), and, as we showed,\nboth are strongly associated with obesity\nand clustering of cardiometabolic risk fac-\ntors before adjustment for hyperinsulin-\nemia. Therefore, from a public health\npoint of view, it seems tenable to use the\nterm \"pre-diabetes\" to describe the condi-\ntion of IFG and/or IGT and to identify\nadolescents at increased risk for diabetes\nin later life.\nOur results are subject to two limita-\ntions. First, the cross-sectional design of\nthe NHANES study precluded a causal in-\nference among obesity, clustering of car-\ndiometabolic risk factors, insulin\nresistance, and pre-diabetes. Future stud-\nies with a longitudinal design are war-\nranted to identify the temporal sequence\namong these variables. Second, because\nof the low prevalence of IGT, we were\nunable to conduct separate analyses of\nfactors associated with IGT. Therefore,\nour results for pre-diabetes may be influ-\nenced mainly by IFG. However, because\nour study was focused on pre-diabetes\nprevalence estimates rather than its pre-\ndictors, interpretation of our results may\nnot be affected.\nIn summary, the high prevalence of\npre-diabetes among adolescents has\nraised public health concerns. Because\nadolescents with pre-diabetes usually\nhave no apparent clinical symptoms,\ngreat efforts may be needed to identify\nthem early and to intervene against the\nroot causes of insulin resistance such as\noverweight, physical inactivity, and un-\nhealthy diet in pediatric primary care and\nthrough public health services.\n"
