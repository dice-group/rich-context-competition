Seroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total U.S.\npopulation.\nResults: At the time of NHANES III, two thirds (68%) of the U.S.\npopulation 12 years and older had HSV-1 antibody. Prevalence in-\ncreased with age and varied by race/ethnicity; the majority of persons\nin all race/ethnic groups were HSV-1-seropositive by age 30. Overall,\nthe national seroprevalence of HSV-1 decreased nonsignificantly by\n2% in the years between NHANES II and III; decreases in HSV-1\nseroprevalence in some population subgroups were balanced by in-\ncreases in other groups.\nConclusions: There was no overall change in the seroprevalence of\nHSV-1 in the U.S. population between NHANES II and III.\nHERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 1 (HSV-1) infections are com-\nmon worldwide.1 Most infections are asymptomatic, or manifest as\nprimary gingivostomatitis or recurrent orolabial facial lesions;\nhowever, HSV-1 also causes severe infections of the eyes and\ncentral nervous system, and disseminated infection, especially\namong immunocompromised persons.2\u00ad4 In the United States and\nsome other countries, HSV-1 infections account for a substantial\nand increasing proportion of genital herpes infections.5\u00ad13 Genital\ninfections caused by HSV-1 are clinically indistinguishable from\nthose caused by the closely related herpes simplex virus type 2\n(HSV-2).14 However, because reactivation is more common with\nthe cause of genital herpes recurrences. Perinatal transmission of\ngenital HSV-1 or HSV-2 can result in neonatal herpes infections\nwith a similar spectrum of disease, and with high rates of morbid-\nity and mortality despite antiviral treatment.17\u00ad20 Recent reports\nthat HSV-1 may be an etiologic agent or serve as a cofactor for\ncertain chronic neurologic and cardiovascular diseases21,22 suggest\nthat the scope of disease attributable to HSV-1 may be broader\nthan has been previously appreciated.\nHSV-1 infection is transmitted by contact with virus-containing\nsecretions. Most infections are sporadic; however, outbreaks have\noccurred in settings where large numbers of susceptible children\nare congregated.4 Age, nonwhite race, female sex, lower educa-\ntional attainment, and lower socioeconomic status have been con-\nsistently associated with HSV-1 seropositivity23\u00ad28; however, few\nstudies have used multivariate methodologies to control for pos-\nsible confounding between these factors. Behavioral practices that\nmay increase risk for HSV-1 acquisition have been even less\nclearly delineated. Although measures of sexual activity (such as\nlifetime number of sex partners) have been examined in numerous\nhaviors that can transmit HSV-1 (kissing, orogenital contact),\noften precede sexual intercourse. Behavioral and childrearing prac-\ntices associated with childhood infection (such as an infant sharing\na bed with parents) have rarely been investigated and described.23\nThere are conflicting data concerning whether prior HSV-1\nhowever, preexisting HSV-1 antibody appears to increase the\nlikelihood that a subsequent HSV-2 infection will be subclini-\ndeclines in HSV-1 seroprevalence have been reported for some\npopulations,1,28 national trends in HSV-1 seroprevalence have not\nbeen examined in the United States.

The NHANES use a complex, stratified, multi-\nstage, probability-cluster design for sampling a population repre-\nsentative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the\nUnited States. Details of the survey methodology and data collec-\ntion have been published previously.39,40 In brief, survey partici-\npants were asked about family and individual demographics, and a\nmedical history was conducted during a household interview.\nSensitive questions related to sexual behavior and illicit drug use\nwere asked during a private interview at a mobile examination\ncenter, where participants underwent physical examination and\nspecimen collection for laboratory testing.\nsampled preschool children, older people, and people living below\nof age were sampled. Of these, 25,286 were interviewed and\nSerologic testing for HSV-1 was not included in the original\ndesign of NHANES II; sera were not available from all examined\nstudy participants for reasons that included unsuccessful venipunc-\nture and use of serum for other tests. There were 13,488 persons\naged 15 to 74 years of age examined, and serum specimens were\navailable for 9943 of these participants. The original number of\nserum specimens available for persons aged 12 to 14 years was not\ndocumented.41 An unequal probability sample of the available sera\nHSV-1 serologic testing. The sample included all the nonwhites\nand a random sample of 20% to 25% of the whites in each age\ngroup. Weighted seroprevalence estimates were calculated by mul-\ntiplying the original NHANES II examination weight by a second\nweight that reflected the subsampling procedure and poststratifi-\ncation by age, race, and sex.\nchildren under 5 years of age, persons 60 years and older, Mexican\nAmericans, and black Americans; there was no upper age limit for\nsurvey participants. A total of 39,695 persons were sampled for\nexamined for an overall examination response rate of 78%. Sera\nRace/ethnicity was defined differently for the 2 surveys. In\nNHANES II, race was defined by self-report as \"white,\" \"black,\"\nand \"other,\" and self-reported ancestry was used to ascribe eth-\nnicity. To permit comparisons between the 2 surveys, NHANES II\nparticipants who reported Hispanic ancestry were excluded from\nthe black and white race categories and included in the total\npopulation along with respondents of other races to create non-\nHispanic black and non-Hispanic white analytic categories. In\nNHANES III, race and ethnicity were ascertained separately, and\nanalytically recoded into race/ethnicity categories of \"non-His-\npanic black\" (NH-black), \"non-Hispanic white\" (NH-white),\n\"Mexican American,\" and \"other.\" The poverty index ratio was\ncalculated by dividing the total reported family income by the\npoverty threshold (adjusted for family size).42 Residence was\nclassified as urban if the county of residence was in a metropolitan\narea with a population of 1 million or more. Household crowding\nwas calculated by dividing household size by the number of rooms\nin the home not including the bathroom. A crowding index of 1.0\nindicates 1 person per room.\nDuring the interview portion of the NHANES III, questions\nrelated to daycare, sexual activity, and illicit drug use were asked\nonly of specific age groups. Prior daycare attendance was ascer-\ntained only for survey participants aged 12 to 16 (or their guard-\nian). Adolescents aged 15 and 16 were asked only if they had ever\nhad intercourse and age at first intercourse, whereas persons aged\n17 to 59 were asked whether they had ever had intercourse, age at\nfirst intercourse, lifetime number of sex partners, and whether they\nhad a history of genital herpes. Questions concerning marijuana\nand cocaine use were addressed to participants between the ages of\nSerologic Testing\nSerum samples were tested for antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2\nby immunodot tests using purified glycoprotein gG-1 of HSV-1\nand gG-2 of HSV-2, respectively, as the antigens for the assay. All\nspecimens were tested in the same laboratory using the same assay.\nThe type-specific immunodot assays used for this study can dif-\nferentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2 and have high\nsensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.43\u00ad45 Assay perfor-\nmance was monitored throughout the testing period by testing\npositive and negative controls derived from reference sera.\nStatistical Analyses\nSeroprevalence Estimates. Seroprevalence estimates for\nNHANES II and III were weighted to represent the total U.S. popu-\nlation at the time of each survey. Seropositivity rates for NHANES II\nwere calculated using available sera from 12 to 74 year olds; for\nNHANES III, seropositivity was calculated using sera from partici-\npants 12 and older. The weighting procedure accounted for oversam-\npling and nonresponse to the household and physical examination\nportions of the survey. Adjustments were also made for estimates of\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population\ntaken from the Current Population Survey adjusted for undercount-\ning.46,47 For both surveys, seroprevalence was calculated for sub-\ngroups defined by sex and race/ethnicity and for standard age groups.\nBecause NHANES II had an upper age limit of 74, the oldest age\ngroup for which seroprevalence could be estimated for that survey\nwas 70 to 74 year olds; for NHANES III, the oldest age group for\nwhich seroprevalence was estimated includes persons older than 74.\nEstimates of prevalence, standard errors, and all analyses were per-\nformed using SUDAAN software (release 7.5.2; Research Triangle\nInstitute).\nTrends. To permit comparisons between NHANES II and III,\ndata were age-adjusted by direct standardization to the 1980 U.S.\npopulation. Differences between NHANES II and NHANES III\nprevalence estimates were considered to be statistically significant\nif the 95% confidence intervals surrounding the prevalence esti-\nmate did not overlap. Because the upper and lower age limits\ndiffered for the 2 survey samples, comparisons between NHANES\nII and III are limited to persons aged 12 to 74 (NHANES II, n \nethnicities are included in the overall, national estimates of sero-\nprevalence, changes in seroprevalence could be assessed for NH-\nblacks and NH-whites, but not for Hispanic or Mexican Americans\nbecause ethnicity was defined and sampled differently for the 2\nsurveys, and not for persons in the \"other\" category.\nBivariate and Multivariate Analyses. Bivariate analyses were\nperformed to examine risk factors for infection at the time of the\nvariables of interest (regarding daycare attendance, sexual activity,\nand illicit drug use) were ascertained only among persons aged 12\nto 59, our analyses were limited to that age range. Variables were\nexamined if they described a characteristic with a plausible rela-\ntionship to the acquisition of HSV-1, or if significant associations\nwith HSV-1 or HSV-2 had been previously reported. Because\ncorrelates of HSV-1 infection could differ between adolescents\nand adults, analyses were performed separately for adolescents\nicantly associated with HSV-1 seropositivity in either of the age\ngroup-specific bivariate analyses were included in both multivar-\niate models. The models were adjusted for age and the square of\nage as continuous variables. Participants whose race/ethnicity cat-\negory was classified as \"other\" were excluded from analyses\nbecause there were too few to achieve stable measures of associ-\nation.\nResults\nSeroprevalence\nnational survey, two thirds (67.7%) of the U.S. population aged 12\nand older had antibody to HSV-1. The seroprevalence was signif-\nicantly higher among females (70.9%) than males (64.2%). Sero-\nprevalence increased with age and varied significantly by race/\nethnicity (Table 1).\nThe overall seroprevalence of HSV-1 was significantly higher\namong NH-whites (64.7%). Although sex differences were not\nsignificant, females had a slightly higher prevalence than males in\neach of the 3 defined race/ethnicity groups (Mexican American\nage group for which we had data, the seroprevalence among\n1.9 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than that among NH-whites\n(36.5%). Seroprevalence plateaued among NH-blacks and Mexi-\ncan Americans after age 39, whereas among NH-whites, the sero-\nprevalence continued to increase. Among persons 70 years and\n90.0% of NH-whites had antibody to HSV-1.\nTrends in Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Seropositivity Between\nOverall, there was no significant change in HSV-1 seropreva-\nfemales during both surveys; among males, the seroprevalence was\nwas a 6% decrease among NH-whites (10% among males and 3%\namong females) and a 7% decrease among NH-blacks (6% among\nmales and 8% among females); however, neither of these de-\ncreases was statistically significant. The prevalence of infection\nbetween the 2 surveys increased among persons in the other\nrace/ethnicity category; however, the composition of this category\ndiffered in NHANES II (77% Hispanic white, 0.1% Hispanic\nblack, 20% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 2.9% other) and\nAsian or Pacific Islander, and 11% other).\nTABLE 1.

The prevalence was lower\namong adolescents who had ever attended daycare (34.6% vs.\n46.4% among nonattenders) and higher among those who were\nforeign-born (61.5% vs. 39.8% among nonforeign-born). Of note,\n23% of 12- to 16-year-old Mexican Americans were foreign born,\ncompared with 3% of NH-black and 2% of NH-white Americans,\nwhereas more than half (58%) of persons classified as belonging to\n\"other racial/ethnic groups\" were foreign-born. HSV-1 seropreva-\nlence was 88.9% among adolescents who were HSV-2 antibody-\npositive, compared with 39.5% among those who were HSV-2-\nseronegative.\nAmong adults, HSV-1 seropositivity was significantly associated\nwith all of the demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables exam-\nined. Young age at first intercourse (less than age 16) was associated\nwith seropositivity, and persons with 1 lifetime sex partner were more\nlikely to be seropositive (65.2%) than persons who had not had\nintercourse (41.2%); however, seroprevalence did not increase with\npartners, 66.9%). Seroprevalence was lower among persons with\nhigher levels of educational attainment and among those who con-\nsumed more than 1 alcoholic drink per month, smoked tobacco, or\nsmoked marijuana. As was the case with adolescents, foreign-born\nstatus was associated with a higher prevalence of HSV-1 antibody.\nAmong persons 17 years and older, 53% of Mexican Americans were\nforeign-born, compared with 7% of NH-black and 5% of NH-white\nAmericans; the majority (79%) of persons classified as belonging to\n\"other racial/ethnic groups\" were foreign-born.\nMultivariate Analyses\nFor both adolescents and adults, the multivariate models con-\ntained the following variables: age, square of age, sex, race/\nethnicity, urban residence, poverty, household crowding, foreign-\nTABLE 2.

Daycare attendance\nwas added to the model for adolescents; educational attainment,\nmarital status, and age at first intercourse (\"sexual debut\") were\nincluded in the adult model only.\nAge and square of age were significant predictors of HSV-1\nseropositivity in both adolescents and adults. For adolescents,\nrace/ethnicity other than NH-white, nonurban residence, poverty,\nhousehold crowding, and HSV-2 seropositivity remained signifi-\ncantly associated with HSV-1 seropositivity, even after adjusting\nfor all other variables in the model; daycare attendance remained\nsignificant and had a protective effect (Table 3).\nIn the adult model, the following variables remained signifi-\ncantly associated with HSV-1: female sex, race/ethnicity other\nthan NH-white, nonurban residence, foreign-born status, and\nsmoking history (Table 3).

(B) Seroprevalence of\nherpes simplex virus type 1 in the United\nAmericans in the NHANES III survey suggests that in these\ngroups, most HSV-1 acquisition occurs during childhood or young\nadulthood. In contrast, the increasing age-specific prevalence\namong NH-whites suggests either a cohort effect or continued\nacquisition of HSV-1 in older age groups. Because a large pro-\nportion of NH-whites enter adulthood and middle age seronega-\ntive, they may continue to acquire HSV-1. Adults may acquire\nHSV-1 infection by means that differ from, or are in addition to,\nthose among children, and such exposures may be more common\namong NH-white adults than among adults in other race/ethnicity\ngroups. Such exposures could include childrearing practices\n(which may bring adults into contact with children's secretions),\npersonal behaviors (such as smoking), and sexual practices.50,51\nOverall, the national seroprevalence was unchanged between the\nTABLE 3.

Although HSV-1 seropositivity decreased among both\nthese decreases were effectively balanced by increases in sero-\nprevalence among the other race/ethnicity groups comprising the\nU.S. population at the time of the 2 surveys. Because the majority\nof persons classified as belonging to \"other\" race/ethnicity groups\nin the NHANES III sample were born outside the United States,\nthe increase in seroprevalence among persons in the \"other\" race/\nethnicity groups may represent in-migration from countries of\nhigher HSV-1 seroprevalence. It is difficult to interpret changes in\nage-specific seroprevalence across surveys; when comparing the\nseroprevalence among persons of the same age group from\nNHANES II and NHANES III, observed differences in seropreva-\nlence may reflect actual increases or decreases in transmission,\ncohort effects, or some combination of both of these factors.\nWe examined risk factors for infection separately among ado-\nlescents and adults because we hypothesized that transmission\ncould occur by predominantly different routes at different ages.\nOur multivariate analysis among 12 to 16 year olds suggests that\nage, race/ethnicity other than NH-white, nonurban residence, pov-\nerty, and household crowding were independently associated with\nHSV-1 seropositivity. The strong association between HSV-1 and\nHSV-2 seropositivity in adolescents suggests that sexual behaviors\nmay play an important role in acquisition among adolescents.\nHowever, because adolescents were not asked certain questions\nregarding sexual behavior, we were limited in our ability to ex-\namine the importance of sexual behavior as a risk factor for HSV-1\ninfection and were unable to compare the relative importance of\nsexual practices for adolescents compared with adults.\nWe identified multiple risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity\namong adults, including older age, female sex, and race/ethnicity\nother than NH-white. These findings are similar to those of 2\nprevious studies.24,26 Childrearing responsibilities and differences\nin sexual exposure between men and women may explain the\nhigher risk of HSV-1 among women. For adults, the association\nwe found between being born outside the United States (\"foreign-\nborn\") and HSV-1 infection is consistent with previous findings24\nand may be explained by the fact that the majority of foreign-born\nsurvey participants originate from countries with a high prevalence\nof HSV-1 infection. The importance of foreign-born status among\nadults, but not adolescents, may reflect the longer time that adults\nmay have spent in high-prevalence areas. Both smoking and mar-\nijuana use were independently associated with HSV-1 seropositiv-\nity in our survey, although it is difficult to postulate why one of\nthese behaviors (smoking tobacco) would increase risk and the\nother (smoking marijuana) reduce risk. The protective effect of\nolder age at sexual debut suggests that, as with adolescents, sexual\nbehavior may have a role in HSV-1 acquisition among adults.\nPoverty was a significant predictor of infection among adolescents\nbut was not predictive among adults in our survey. A single\nmeasure of socioeconomic status in adults probably has poor\ncorrelation with lifetime risk for infection, because the majority of\nHSV-1 transmission occurs among children, adolescents, and\nyoung adults.\nGenital HSV-1 infection cannot be distinguished from oral infec-\ntion using the serologic data available from the NHANES surveys.\nHowever, increases in the proportion of genital isolates typed as\nHSV-1 and recent studies identifying female sex and receptive oral\nsex as risk factors for culture-confirmed HSV-1 genital infection52\nsuggest that an increasing proportion of HSV-1-seropositive females\nacquire genital rather than an oral infection. In the AIDS era, with\nwidespread messages about the importance of safe sex, and docu-\nmented declines in the number of adolescents engaging in sexual\nintercourse,53,54 it is possible that intimate behaviors such as oral sex\nhave replaced insertive intercourse in certain age groups, leading to an\nincreased risk for orogenital transmission of HSV-1. Because there\nare few data available to describe trends in the practice of oral sex,55\nthis can only be hypothesized. Although HSV-1 is less likely to recur\nthan HSV-2, the likelihood of genital-to-genital transmission of\nHSV-1 may increase with increases in the proportion of genital\ninfections caused by HSV-1. In our analysis, NH-whites were approx-\nimately half as likely as NH-blacks to have HSV-1 antibodies by the\nage of sexual debut, making them more susceptible to primary genital\nHSV-1 infection.\nStrategies are needed to prevent genital herpes, whether caused by\nHSV-1 or HSV-2. It is well known that genital ulcer disease increases\nthe risk for acquisition and transmission of human immunodeficiency\nvirus56 and that genital herpes infection contributes substantially to the\nburden of genital ulcer diseases worldwide.57\u00ad59 It will be important to\ncontinue to monitor the prevalence of HSV-1 in the future, because\nchanges in HSV-1 prevalence and age at acquisition may be expected\nto alter the relative proportion of genital infections resulting from\nHSV-1 and HSV-2, the possible impact of candidate HSV-2 vaccines,\nthe probability of symptomatic genital infection, and the risk for\ninfection resulting in neonatal herpes or severe disseminated disease.\nReferences\n1.
