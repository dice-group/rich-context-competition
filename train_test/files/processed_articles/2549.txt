Introduction\nStudies conducted in Africa have demonstrated a significant association between family environment and the\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nsexual behaviour of adolescents. The family environment has been considered from various viewpoints such as\ntype of residential arrangement at time of survey or during childhood, parents alive, parents living together,\nparents' or guardians' marital status, living with grandparents, number of children in the household, and number\nof siblings. These variables were constructed from data collected in households of residence at time of survey.\nMost studies on this topic are characterized either by a limited definition of family environment or by leaving\naside mechanisms linking familial influence and the sexual behaviour of adolescents.\nIn several studies, only one variable, especially type of family (or type of household) is considered for family\nenvironment. Studies by Tambashe and Shapiro [1], Rwengu\u00e9 [2] and Diop-Sidib\u00e9 [3] looked at more than one\nvariable. In Sub-Saharan Africa, three main factors mark the socialization practices of adolescents: the house-\nhold's human configuration, the fostering of children, and whether or not parents are alive. Operationalized fam-\nily environments that do not take these specifications into account might underestimate the scope of the associa-\ntion that is likely to exist between family environment and adolescents' behaviour. This is the case for studies\ncarried out in Africa that focus essentially on comparing adolescents from two-parent families to those from\nbroken families, inspired by empirical studies conducted in the West [4] [5] that are based on theoretical ap-\nproaches developed in the contexts of these industrialized societies.\nSome studies that focus directly or indirectly on this issue [1]-[9] do not control for family mechanisms or\nprocesses through which household members influence sexual behaviour. Such mechanisms combine relation-\nship and communication between parents and adolescents with parental monitoring. However, since the early\n2000s, the trend has been to take these mechanisms into account [10]-[15]. This new direction in research is\npossible because of the availability of data on family processes.\nThe pertinence of our study rests on the extent of risky sexual behaviours among adolescents as well as asso-\nciated health problems and unwanted pregnancies. According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey\n(DHS) report for Burkina Faso, almost half of girls (48.4%) and more than a quarter of boys (26.2%) aged 15 to\n19 have already had their first sexual relations [16]. During the most recent sexual relations of adolescents who\nare single, 52.9% of girls and 38.6% of boys did not use condoms. Among adolescents who had had their first\nsexual relations, 3.9% of girls and 11.5% of boys acknowledged having had an STI or symptoms of these infec-\ntions. AIDS prevalence is 0.9% in girls and 0.7% in boys.\nThe high number of sexual health problems of Burkinabe adolescents is linked to the general context of lower\nage at puberty and higher age at marriage [17] [18]. The longer period between puberty and marriage increases\nthe time of individuals who are exposed to sex outside marriage and to the related health, psychological, social\nand economic consequences. In Burkina Faso, modern contraception is seldom chosen [19] [20], which does not\nhelp reduce the frequency of these consequences.\nAdolescence is also the period during which behavioural characteristics are developed and when it is possible\nfor adults to guide young people toward values that are socially acceptable [21] and that present fewer health\nrisks [22]. Parents, siblings and other relatives are mainly responsible for modeling behaviours. Hence, among\nBurkina Faso's ethnic groups, particularly the Mossi majority, children are taught about couple relationships,\nhousekeeping, how to take care of children, appropriate attitudes towards members of society, and other issues\n[23]-[25]. From early childhood, people are encouraged to internalize male or female values, attitudes and prac-\ntices. In Africa, gender-based socialization is a determinant of sexual behaviours presenting health risks and\nrisks of pregnancy [26]. For example, education given to girls results in their being passive and submissive when\nthey are involved in intimate relationships [18].\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the association between family environment and adolescents' sexual be-\nhaviour. In Burkina Faso, Akoto et al. [19] had previously recommended that such a study be undertaken.\nHowever, only more recently did Karibu and Ezeh [14] followed by Biddlecom et al. [15] take this concern into\nconsideration in their research on adolescents in Burkina Faso and three other African countries. The specificity\nof our study stems from the range of variables that we use to operationalize family environment and the fact that\nwe took family processes into consideration. Generally, empirical studies on this topic are based on three theo-\nretical approaches: socialization, parental control, and family or conjugal instability. The approach of socializa-\ntion considers adolescent behaviour to be dependent upon parent-child relationship and communication. In fami-\nlies, biological parents are not the only ones who socialize adolescents [18] [27] [28]. Siblings, other adults and\ngrandparents living in the household can also be involved. According to the approach of parental control, par-\nents' objectives are to be aware of adolescents attitudes and behaviours and to monitor their activities so they\ncan discipline adolescents who engage in socially unacceptable behaviour [29]. It is considered that in situations\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nwhere parents are not together (single-parent families) or have remarried (blended families), parents spend less\ntime with adolescents and consequently provide less supervision. The approach of conjugal or family instability\nemphasizes the situation of children in single-parent and blended families [30]. In these families, problems could\nnegatively affect parents' relationships with their children and their capacity to offer guidance and monitor ado-\nlescents' activities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is more relevant to associate the situation of orphaned or fostered\nadolescents with this theoretical perspective.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe 2004 National Survey of Adolescents (NSA) in Burkina Faso provides data for the study. It looks at the\nsexual and reproductive health of 12- to 19-year-old adolescents. The survey was organized by Institut National\nde la Statistique et de la D\u00e9mographie in collaboration with Macro International Inc. and The Alan Guttmacher\nInstitute [20]. It is part of a program of surveys conducted in three other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana,\nMalawi and Uganda.\nThe NSA is a nationally representative, stratified household survey. It included 5400 households taken from a\nsub-sample of the 2003 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) enumeration areas, and covered populations resid-\ning in ordinary households. All adolescents aged 12 to 19 living in regular households were eligible to partici-\nOur study focuses on the evaluation of premarital sexual behaviours adopted by adolescents experiencing so-\ncialization processes in family environments. To this end, the test sample does not consider adolescents who had\ntheir first sexual relations after marriage. Also excluded are adolescents who first had sex before marriage but\nlived with a partner at the time of the survey, and adolescents with the status of household caregivers. In the lat-\nter two cases, household of residence at survey would not correspond to socialization setting. In all, 7.2% of\nadolescents were excluded from the analyses. They are mostly girls (90%), uneducated teens (80.8%) and ado-\nhad sexual relations.\nSexual behaviours were measured by first premarital sex; among adolescents who had had premarital sexual\nexperiences, the behaviours measured were condom use at first sex, number of sex partners over the past 12\nmonths, and systematic condom use during this period.\nAn adolescent's status regarding first sex (sexual relations with vaginal penetration) was determined with the\nfollowing question: When did you have sex for the first time (if you have ever had sex)? Using the imputation\nmethod, data on age at first sex was defined for all adolescents who had initiated sex.\nTo assess condom use at first sex, the following question was asked: \"When you had sex for the first time, was\na male condom used?\" In the NSA questionnaire for adolescents, dozens of questions were asked regarding\nsexual relations, partners and circumstances under which sexual relations occurred, in the past 12 months and in\nthe past 3 months. The data collected for this purpose are summarized by \"number of sex partners\" and \"syste-\nmatic condom use\" in the past 12 months. Adolescents who used a condom during all reported sexual relations\nare considered as having used it systematically. The variable \"systematic condom use\" was constructed using\nsexual relations in the past 12 months for girls, and sexual relations in the past 12 and past 3 months for boys.\nData on context of sexual relations in the past 3 months were collected only from boys, to assess systematic\ncondom use and its effectiveness.\nA sexual behaviour presents a health risk when there is a greater likelihood of contracting sexually transmit-\nted infections or HIV, and of pregnancy at a young age and/or unwanted pregnancy. A sexual behaviour is risky\nwhen at least one of the following conditions is met: first premarital sex at an earlier age than other respondents;\nnot using condoms at first sex; having had at least two sex partners in the past 12 months; or not systematically\nusing a condom during sexual relations in the past 12 months.\nThe operational definition of risky sexual behaviour is based on the one used by UNAIDS for the monitoring\nand evaluation of national AIDS and sexually transmitted infections programs [31]. Categories for sexual be-\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nhaviours defined as \"risky\" are based on a public health principles, which endeavour to get populations to adopt\ndesirable behaviours through prevention initiatives [32].\n2.2.2. Independent and Control Variables\nThe definition and measurement of the concept of family environment include parents' reproductive and conju-\ngal path and history, which are difficult to collect; this could explain the lack of interest in such a measurement\nin standard survey operations that consider only household residence [33] [34]. Due to a lack of appropriate data,\nresearchers turn to household data. \"Household\" is defined according to residential unit and hierarchical links\namong individuals [35], whereas \"family\" is based on blood relationship or marriage [36]. The tendency to use\nhousehold data to understand the family environment is designed to facilitate measurement of the concept of\nfamily.\nFamily environment is represented by type of family household, parents alive, living with grandparents, and\nratio of people under 20 per adult in the household. Type of household of residence distinguishes people living\nin the same household as the mother and father from those living with only the father or mother, or without the\nparents. Parents alive are based on data pertaining to the biological mother or father still living. Cohabitation\nwith grand-parents refers to adolescents residing in households containing grand-parents and their grandchildren.\nThere can be one or several grandparents in a household. The ratio \"number of people under age 20 per adult in\nthe household\" indicates the availability of human resources for socialization of young people in a household.\nAdults are defined according to age criteria, that is, people aged 20 or over.\nFamily processes are measured by using parents' level of control and having discussed sexuality with family\nmembers. Parental level of control is an index constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to\nthe database on parents' or guardians' knowledge of adolescents' nighttime outings, what adolescents do with\ntheir free time, and who are the adolescents' friends.\nThere are three levels of parental control: low, medium and high. \"Low level of control\" includes mostly\nadolescents whose parents or guardians are unaware of at least two elements (night spots, leisure activities or\nfriends), and those whose parents may be aware of all three elements. \"High level of control\" essentially in-\ncludes adolescents who never go out and whose parents or guardians are aware of all leisure activities or know\ntheir friends, and adolescents whose parents or guardians are always aware of all three elements. Separate level\nof parental control variables are constructed for urban and rural settings.\nThe second family process variable captures the fact that an adolescent has discussed sexuality with family\nmembers, that is, mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, cousin, grandmother, grandfather, or other. The ex-\nact contents of this oral exchange on sexuality was not explored in NSA questions to adolescents.\nAdolescents' sexual behaviour can also be determined by extrafamilial environment; this includes people of\nall ages in the community who interact with the adolescent in community settings such as schools, religious or-\nganizations, social groups, social education and health centres, or simply neighbourhoods. It is a measure of the\nsocial capital available to adolescents from the community [37] and that allows them to access information, de-\nvelop knowledge, attitudes, values and behavioural models. It is measured from the perspective of the adoles-\ncent, according to level of education, participation in religious activities, belonging to social groups (association,\nyouth group or club), number of friends of the same sex, number of friends of the opposite sex, and having\ntalked about sexuality with someone from outside the family1.\nAnalyses in this study are controlled by a series of other variables: adolescent's ethnicity, place of residence,\nage at survey, household wealth index, and head of household's level of education. The household wealth index\nwas constructed with PCA [38] using data on characteristics of the home, and household members' and house-\nhold's assets, as well as facilities in the household. The variable is a proxy for the household's standard of living.\nIn analyses on sexually active adolescents' behaviour, many modalities of ethnicity and age at survey are reduc-\ned due to their small numbers.. Analysis pertaining to condom use at first sexual relation is controlled for age at\nthis event, without taking into account age at survey. Analysis of sexual behaviour in the past 12 months is con-\ntrolled for duration since initiation of sexual activity, which distinguishes adolescents who initiated sexual activ-\nity in the past 12 months from those who did so more than 12 months ago. The variable stems from the differ-\nence between an adolescent's age in months at time of survey and approximate age in months at first sex. Multi-\nplying age at first sexual relation by 12 yields this approximation.\n1It is the fact of having discussed sexuality with friends, boyfriends or girlfriends, teachers, health professionals, religious leaders, or others.\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\n\u00b7 A family environment comprised of both parents in the household, both parents alive, grandparents, or indi-\nviduals under age 20 fewer than adults in the household is less likely to be associated with risky sexual beha-\nviour.\n\u00b7 Having discussed sexuality with family members or greater parental (or guardian) control is less likely to be\nassociated with risky sexual behaviour.\n\u00b7 The relationship between family environment or family processes and sexual behaviour depend on the ado-\nlescent's gender.\nAnalyses were bivariate and multivariate. Cross-tabulations were used for bivariate analyses. Significance of\nassociations between variables was assessed using chi-squared test at a threshold value of 0.05. Multivariate\nanalyses were conducted according to three variants of logistic regression, based on dependent variable catego-\nries: discrete-time survival analysis using logistic regression (onset of premarital sexual relations), dichotomous\nlogistic regression (condom use at first sex and systematic use in the past 12 months), and ordered logistic re-\ngression (number of sex partners in the past 12 months). Availability of data on age at first sex determined the\nuse of discrete-time survival logistic regression to analyse first sex. To apply this method, the \"episode\" data file\nmust first be changed into a \"person-years\" data file. Weighted data were used for the analyses. Mulitivariate\nanalysis results are considered according to a maximum significance threshold of 0.10.\nThe NSA sample design consisted of interviewing a number of 12- to 19-year-olds living in households. Lo-\ngistic regression involved the assumption of adolescents' independence; this hypothesis cannot be verified in the\ncase of the behaviours of adolescents from a same household. The same applies to analyses of person-years,\nwhich are elements in an adolescent's history. To control the correlation of observations and improve the robust-\nness of standard errors, we used the \"cluster\" option in Stata for analyses involving two levels (adolescent and\nhousehold), and a multilevel analysis with a random intercept for cases involving three levels (person-years,\nadolescent and household) using Stata 10.0 with the command xtmelogit.\n3. Results\n3.1. Adolescents' Sexual Behaviour\nAn exploration of dependent variables by sex (Table 1) provides insight into the sexual behaviour of boys and\ngirls. Overall, 18.4% of Burkinabe adolescents reported having premarital sexual relations. Median age at first\nsex for boys and girls in our sample is 18.9 years, and was obtained from the survival table. According to adults\nin Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, it is more common these days for young people to have sex outside marriage\nthan when they were young themselves [39]. This point of view is consistent with the conclusions of scientific\nstudies that puberty occurs at a younger age and age at marriage is rising, and thus sexual initiation of adoles-\ncents is more likely to be premarital. Yet, in the values of most ethnic groups in Burkina Faso, sexual relations\nAmong sexually active adolescents, 34.5% reported using a condom the first time they had sexual relations.\nGirls were proportionately more numerous than boys to report using a condom at first sex (39.8% vs 30.9%).\nThe condom is the contraceptive [19] [20] Burkinabe adolescents were most familiar with and the one they used\nthe most. Its use at first sex was quite low, a reflection of several realities. Part of this finding can be explained\nby the trust partners had in each other, which justified their desire to have sexual relations. A second explanation\nis the cost and accessibility of condoms. Admittedly, the cost of condoms has gone down and its geographical\naccessibility has risen. But for a Burkinabe adolescent under 20 years of age with no source of income, it can be\ndifficult to find the 50 or 100 CFA francs needed to by a pack of four condoms. Even when there is money, they\nhave to be daring to go to a neighbourhood store to purchase condoms, and risk being judged by the shopkeeper\nand the entire neighbourhood.\nIn the past 12 months, 9% of adolescents who had initiated sex reported having had more than one sex partner,\nand 31.1% said they had systematically used a condom during sexual relations. Proportionately more boys than\ngirls reported having had more than one sex partner (12.9% of boys, 3% of girls). Conversely, fewer boys than\ngirls stated having systematically used condoms (27.5% vs 36.7%). In the Burkina Faso context of low condom\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nTable 1.

We can assume that numerous adolescents who had had more than one sex partner in the past 12 months\ndid not use condoms systematically.\nSexual behaviour varies significantly by gender, thus reflecting differences in the socialization processes of\nadolescents of both sexes. Girls are subject to significant control by family and community members, which\nlimits their propensity to initiate sexual activity at a young age. Such social control persists while girls remain in\na family environment under adult guardianship. They are constantly warned against out-of-wedlock pregnancies\nand the familial and social consequences that would ensue.\nOut-of-wedlock pregnancies are a major social problem in Africa [40] [41]. According to Burkinabe adults,\ncases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies are common among families [42]. Their consequences cause permanent\nconcerns for the families [21] [43]. Teen pregnancy can lead to dropping out of school, abortion, premature birth\nor to compromising a girl's prospects for marriage. A pregnant young girl can also be rejected by her family and\nsocially marginalized.\n3.2. Variables Associated with Adolescents' Sexual Behaviour\nTable 2 shows the results of multivariate analyses conducted by sex. These are estimated coefficients in regres-\nsion models for first premarital sex (columns 2 and 3), condom use at first sex (columns 4 and 5), systematic\ncondom use in the past 12 months (columns 6 and 7), and number of sex partners during this period (columns 8\nFamily environment is significantly associated with girls' first sex, through type of family household.

Behaviours of Adolescents Who Had Initiated Sexual Activity\nResults shown in Table 2 demonstrate a significant association between family environment and the behaviours\nof boys and girls who had initiated sexual relations. Boys who do not live with their parents are less likely to use\ncondoms at first sex, compared with boys in two-parent households. Girls in the latter type of household are\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nmore likely to use condoms at first sex. Among girls, living with their mothers is likely to be associated with\ncondom use at first sex, systematic condom use in the past 12 months, and having more than one sex partner\nduring this period. An increase in the number of individuals under 20 years old per adult in the household is\nmore likely to be associated with girls' condom use at first sex, and less likely to be associated with boys' sys-\ntematic condom use in the past 12 months.\nParental control is associated with boys' and girls' behaviours, whereas having discussed sexuality with fam-\nily members is only associated with girls' behaviours. High parental control over girls is associated with condom\nuse at first sex, whereas medium parental control is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use over\nthe past 12 months. Medium or high parental control over boys and medium control over girls is less likely to be\nassociated with having more than one sex partner. Girls who had discussed sexuality with family members were\nmore likely to report having used a condom at first sex.\nSignificant associations are observed between extrafamilial environment variables and the behaviour of ado-\nlescents who had initiated sexual relations. Boys and girls in high school are more likely to use condoms at first\nsex. Girls in elementary and high school are more likely to have systematically used condoms in the past 12\nmonths. For boys, going to high school is associated with a low probability of having more than one sex partner.\nBoys who do not adhere to a religion are less likely to use a condom at first sex; girls who participate in reli-\ngious activities are less likely to have systematically used condoms in the past 12 months. Among boys, an in-\ncrease in the number of friends of the same sex reduced the probability of having had more than one sex part-\nner over the past 12 months. An increase in the number of friends of the opposite sex is associated with syste-\nmatic condom use over the past 12 months among boys and girls, and, for boys, with having had more than one\nsex partner. Lastly, boys and girls who reported discussing sexuality with someone outside the family are more\nlikely to have had more than one sex partner in the past 12 months.\nAmong control variables, ethnicity is not significantly associated with girls' behaviours. Age at survey and\nhousehold wealth index are not significantly associated with boys' behaviours.\n4. Discussion\nAnalyses reveal a weak, sex-differentiated association between family environment and sexual behaviour. \"Par-\nents alive\" and \"living with grandparents\" are not associated with sexual behaviour indicators. No new results\nemerged from looking at the joint effects of the variables that operationalize family environment. Our results in-\ndicated that adolescents living with both parents did not have safer sexual behaviours than those living in other\ntypes of households.\nThe absence of both parents in the household is not systematically associated with risky sexual behaviours in\ngirls who lived with their mothers only or who did not live with their parents. Girls who lived with their mothers\nand without their fathers are more likely to have had several sex partners than their counterparts living with both\nparents. However, they had a greater propensity to use condoms at first sex and in the past 12 months. This re-\nsult runs somewhat counter to that of Biddlecom et al. [15]. These authors observed that Ghanaian girls living\nwith their mothers were less likely to have used a contraceptive method at most recent sexual relation. But that\nstudy focused on contraception in general, which limited the scope of comparison. Our study findings enable us\nto qualify the hypotheses that adolescents residing with their mothers are more likely to adopt risky sexual be-\nhaviours [44] [45]. At the very least, this hypothesis holds for having several sex partners. Mothers are closer to\ntheir daughters and more likely to listen to them and act as confidantes. This relationship of trust predisposes\ngirls to better internalize the advice given by their mothers on risks linked to sexuality. While girls in these\nhouseholds have more partners, a sign of having a certain amount of freedom, their tendency to use protection is\nan indication of their concerns regarding risks of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections.\nAnalyses demonstrate that girls who did not live in households with both their parents were more likely to\nengage in early first sex than their counterparts living in two-parent households. This result is similar to the\nfindings of Karim et al. [11] in their study in Ghana, where unmarried girls aged 12 to 24 who did not live with\nboth their parents were more inclined to initiate sexual relations. Girls who do not live with both parents are en-\ntrusted to somebody's care. Their propensity to have sexual intercourse at an early age is a consequence of the\nheads of households' discriminatory practices when caring for children they have taken in [46] [47]. Unlike the\nchildren of heads of households, these girls get very little emotional, material and financial support. They have\nmale companions to compensate for this lack of support. Results also show that a condom is more likely to be\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nused at first sex, indicating better knowledge of the health and social consequences of having unprotected sex.\nUnlike girls, boys living in this same type of household do not have such knowledge or, at the very least, such\nawareness. They are less likely to use a condom at first sex.\nAccording to social capital hypotheses [48], a higher number of children in a household reduce the attention\nand affection parents give to each child, and therefore are likely to be associated with risky sexual behaviours.\nResults for boys fit this hypothesis. An increase in the number of individuals under 20 years old per number of\nadults in the household is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use in the past 12 months. This is\nnot the case for girls. Girls who live in this type of household are more likely to use condoms at first sex. A\ngreater number of children and adolescents in a household is synonymous with greater proximity and better in-\nteraction among them [28] [49]. It is easier for girls who live most of their adolescence inside the household to\nfind someone among the other young people to talk about sexuality and its consequences. The inverse is ob-\nserved among boys. Such closeness encourages them to value unprotected sex.\nResults related to parental control support our study hypothesis. Parental control is associated with later first\nsex, with having fewer than two sex partners in the past 12 months for boys and girls, and with condom use at\nfirst sex for girls. These findings are in line with the results of other studies which have shown that parental con-\ntrol is less likely to be associated with sexual relations in the past months [13] [15] and more likely to be associ-\nated with using a condom at most recent sexual relation [50]. However, our study demonstrates that parental\ncontrol is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use in the past 12 months. This result can be ex-\nplained by an inverted relationship between parental control and sexual behaviour. It is likely that higher paren-\ntal control follows from adolescents' adoption of a type of behaviour.\nThe hypothesis of the protective effects of adolescents and family members discussing sexuality is partly\nborne out. The fact of having discussed sexuality is associated with girls' condom use at first sex. Similar to pa-\nrental control, the effects of the last variable also suggest inverse causality. A predisposition of household\nmembers or of adolescents to talk about sexuality could result from an adolescent's sexual activity. For instance,\nboys who initiated sex at an early age where more likely to report having talked about sexuality with family\nmembers. Babalola et al. [12], Kumi-Kyereme et al. [13] and Biddlecom et al. [15] obtained similar results.\nCompared with parental control, the variable operationalizing communication is nonetheless weakly associ-\nated with sexual behaviour. It is important to note the low accuracy of the data used to operationalize communi-\ncation. The indicator variable was constructed using answers to the following question: Did you talk about is-\nsues related to sexuality with any family members? If the answer was Yes, a second question was asked: With\nwhom did you talk about it? Results demonstrate that within households, monitoring adolescents and their ac-\ntivities is more commonly used by parents and guardians [20] [51]. Whether control is exercised prior or subse-\nquent to adolescents' adopting a behaviour, these results uphold the evidence indicating a preference for moni-\ntoring adolescents.\nThe relationship between type of family and sexual behaviour differs according to sex. This result can be\ncompared to those of Karim et al. [11] and Biddlecom et al. [15]. In the first study, there is an association be-\ntween type of family and first sex for girls. No significant association was observed between type of family and\nfirst sex for boys. In the second study, type of family is associated only with Ghanaian and Ugandan girls' sex-\nual behaviour. Sociocultural context explains the variations in results by gender. In Burkinabe societies, because\nof the importance given to girls' virginity before marriage and management of the consequences of out-of-wed-\nlock pregnancies, household members pay greater attention to girls' sexuality.\n5. Conclusions\nThe results support the hypothesis of a link between extrafamilial environment and sexual behaviour of adoles-\ncents. They highlight the importance of extrafamilial institutions, especially modern schools and religious de-\nnominations in adolescents' socialization. In Burkina Faso, parents recognize that adolescents are more predis-\nposed to listen to a teacher's advice rather than their own [23].\nDespite current ongoing economic crises and sociocultural mutations in Burkinabe societies, the family still\nplays a major role in adolescents' education. More discriminating aspects are the presence or absence of the fa-\nther and/or mother in the household and parents' or guardians' control over adolescents, with regard to sexual\nbehaviour. Fear of parental authority, advice and warnings, as well as psychological, emotional, financial and\nmaterial support from family members limit the propensity for early sex and unprotected sexual relations.\nM. Yode, T. LeGrand\nResults provide arguments that support using household data to examine the relationship between family en-\nvironment and adolescents' behaviours. They reinforce sexual and reproductive health programs that place par-\nents and family members at the centre of strategies [52]. The ease with which households can be located, com-\npared with families, makes it easier to operationalize these strategies.\nReferences\n[1] Tambashe, B.O. and Shapiro, D.
