The\nJIA was classified according to International\nLeague of Associations for Rheumatology\n(ILAR) criteria.16,17 Nutritional status of\neach child was assessed by the calculation\nof body mass index (BMI).18 Healthy, age-\nmatched subjects with BMI< 23kg/m2 were\nchosen for the control group.\nIn accordance with treatment guidelines,3\nchildren experiencing an acute course of JIA\n(i.e., symptoms from at least five affected\njoints and at least three joints affected by\nmobility dysfunction with accompanying\npain and sensitivity) were prescribed etaner-\ncept. The drug was given subcutaneously at\nDosing was twice weekly, the first dose was\nadministered on day zero and the second\ndose was given on days 3 or 4. Subsequent\ndoses were given in following weeks at 3 to\n4 day intervals.\nDuring the study, venous blood sam-\nples were taken from the children and\nwhite blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte\ncounts were assessed using the Mindray\nDiagnostics, MA, USA). Levels of serum\nleptin, total ghrelin, acyl ghrelin were\nassessed and the presence of antinuclear\nantibody (ANA)-HEp-2 determined Leptin\nwas measured using an enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (Human\nLeptin Elisa Kit, Millipore, Missouri, USA;\nHuman Leptin Receptor Elisa, BioVendor\nLaboratory Medicine, Inc, Czech Republic)\naccording to the manufacturer's advised\nmethodology. Total ghrelin and acyl ghrelin\nconcentrations were assessed using ELISA\ntests (Linco Research Inc., Missouri, USA).\nSerum levels of ANA\u00adHep2 antibodies\nwere detected under a fluorescent microscope\nusing the Colorzyme HEp-2 ANA test system\n(Immuno Concepts N.A.

Data\nanalyses were performed using STATISTICA\n(data analysis software system; version\n<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical\nsignificance.\nResults\nStudy population\nFifty children with JIA (34 girls and 16 boys)\nwere enrolled into the study. Eighteen chil-\nBMI<23 kg/m2 . Two children had systemic\nJIA, 17 had oligoarticular JIA and 31 had\npolyarticular JIA. Overall, 35 (70%) chil-\ndren with JIA received oral glucocorticos-\nteroids with approximately the same\nnumber in each treatment group. Clinical\ncharacteristics of the study groups are shown\nin Table 1. Twenty-five children received\netanercept and 25 conventional therapies\nfor JIA which included methotrexate. The\ncontrol group consisted of 16 healthy, age-\nmatched children (11 girls and 5 boys) all\nbodies were detected in 17 (68%) children in\nthe etanercept group, in 16 (64 %) children in\nthe conventional treatment group and none\nof the controls.\nFor all children with JIA and BMI\n< 23 kg/m2, the WBC count was statistically\nsignificantly higher compared with healthy\ncontrols (P < 0.05). The children in the\netanercept had statistically significant lower\nBMI measurements and higher WBC counts\ncompared with children in the control group\nLeptin results\nIn the control group, a moderately positive\ncorrelation was observed between leptin and\nacyl ghrelin (Kendall's ; P <\u00bc 0.03). This\ncorrelation was not detected in the two\ntreatment groups nor in the subgroup of\nJIA patients with BMI<23 kg/m2.\nIn the etanercept group, a moderately\npositive correlation was detected between\nleptin and BMI (Spearman's rank correl-\nation; P <\u00bc 0.001). Similarly, in the conven-\ntional treatment group, a strong positive\ncorrelation was observed between leptin and\nBMI (Spearman's rank correlation, P< 0.001).\nNo such correlation was observed in the\ncontrol group.\nChildren in the etanercept group with a\nlow BMI (n \u00bc 18) had statistically signifi-\ncantly lower levels of leptin compared with\nage matched controls (P < 0.05)\nGhrelin results\nIn all children with JIA, a strong positive\ncorrelation was found between BMI and\ntotal ghrelin (Pearson's linear correlation;\nP < \u00bc 0.03) and multiple regression analysis\nshowed a relationship between age and BMI\nwith total ghrelin as the dependent variable\nobserved in the control group.\nChildren in the etanercept group with a\nlow BMI (n \u00bc 18) showed a moderately\nnegative correlation between BMI and\nacyl ghrelin (Spearman's rank correlation;\nIn the etanercept group, a strong positive\ncorrelation between number of lymphocyte\nand total ghrelin was detected (Spearman's\nstrong positive correlation between number\nof lymphocyte and acyl ghrelin (Spearman's\nations were not found in the conventional\ntreatment group and controls.\nDifferences in types of JIA\nThe two children with systemic onset JIA\nhad high WBC counts and high CRP and\nleptin concentrations (Table 2).

These low leukocyte counts may\nhave been caused by the JIA or treatment\nwith glucocorticoids. 23 In addition, leptin\nlevels were significantly higher in the chil-\ndren with JIA who received oral glucocortic-\noids compared with those who did not.\nOverall, we found no difference in leptin\nor ghrelin levels between treatment groups\nand control subjects and no evidence of a\nrelationship between leptin and ghrelin in the\npatients with JIA. Both treatment groups\nexhibited positive correlations between leptin\nand BMI. However, compared with children\nin the conventional treatment group, children\nin the etanercept group showed a positive\ncorrelation between total ghrelin and BMI\nand those with a low BMI showed a negative\ncorrelation between acyl ghrelin and BMI. In\naddition, children in the etanercept group\nalso showed a positive correlation between\nWBC count and total and acyl ghrelin which\nwas not observed in the conventional treat-\nment group or in the control group.\nAlthough earlier studies examining leptin\nlevels in relation to BMI in patients with\nJIA have been negative, leptin levels may well\nbe a marker of nutritional status in these\npatients. 24,25 For example, studies in patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have shown\nthat serum leptin levels were directly related\nto percent body fat but not to disease activ-\nity.26,27 In our previous study, we showed that\nchildren with JIA and BMI< 23 kg/m2 had\nlower leptin concentrations compared with\nhealthy subjects and children with a short-\nterm disease (2\u00ad18 months) had a higher\ndiversification of leptin concentration per\nBMI unit compared with healthy controls.12\nSerum ghrelin levels and the possible associ-\nation with anti-TNF treatment have been\nexplored in a previous pilot study involving\n52 patients with JIA.13 The study showed that\nserum ghrelin was low in patients with JIA\nand following anti-TNF therapy values were\ncomparable with those in the control group.\nHowever, a relationship between BMI and\nghrelin was not observed. Interestingly, in this\npresent study we found a positive and signifi-\ncant correlation between BMI and total\nghrelin in all patients with JIA. In addition,\nwe also showed a negative correlation\nbetween BMI and acyl ghrelin in patients\nreceiving etanercept with BMI< 23kg/m2\nWhile our sample size was small, in this\ncurrent study, positive correlations were\nshown in the etanercept group between the\nnumber of lymphocytes and both total and\nacyl ghrelin. These correlations occurred\nirrespective of the differences in lymphocyte\ncounts and ghrelin concentrations between\nstudy and control groups. Although the role\nof lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of JIA\nhas been confirmed, 15 the finding of a\nrelationship between ghrelin concentrations\nand lymphocytes during anti-TNF treat-\nment encourages further studies in this\narea, particularly because ghrelin receptors\nhave been demonstrated in murine spleen T\nIn conclusion, no differences in leptin and\nghrelin concentrations were found between\npatients with JIA and control subjects or\nbetween those treated with etanercept and\nconventional treatment. Nevertheless, fur-\nther studies with a large sample size are\nrequired to confirm these results.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
