Interorganizational groups are becoming more com-\nmon in many work environments, from project management\nto disaster response. In these cases, people having disparate\nhistories and identities need to work together, but they do not\nnecessarily share interpersonal relationships and the trust\nthat could foster cooperation. If the people entering an inter-\norganizational environment do not trust their new colleagues\nto provide timely and useful support, cooperation is unlikely\nto occur. Therefore, we believe that it is important to under-\nstand how preexisting social identities and emerging profes-\nsional networks influence this particular aspect of trust\nwithin interorganizational settings.\nTrust in a colleague has been defined as the truster's will-\ningness to rely on the colleague, even when unable to moni-\ntor or control the trustee (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995;\nRousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). Recognizing that\nmany facets of trust can be relevant in organizations, we\nfocus this study particularly on willingness to rely on another\nperson when a rapid response is needed. This aspect of trust\nis especially important when interorganizational workforces\nconvene to address complex, dynamic situations, but it may\nalso affect day-to-day work flows in less-dynamic settings.\nFor example, Gilbert and Behnam (2013) argued that trust of\nparticipants and other stakeholders is a key precondition to\ncollaboration in the United Nations Global Compact, a\nGlobal Public Policy Network working in the areas of human\nrights, labor standards, environmental protection, and\nanticorruption.\nTrust can impact cooperation (Kollock, 1994) and perfor-\nknowledge-intensive settings (Lane, 1998). It also affects\nteamwork (Peters & Karren, 2009) and information sharing\n(Butler, 1999). As collaborative interorganizational networks\ncontinue to grow in prevalence and significance (Currall &\nJudge, 1995), the development of trust becomes increasingly\nimportant (Song, 2009). Prior research suggests that trust can\nbe influenced by social identities and by social networks. In\nthis study, we attempt to determine the direct and interactive\neffects of these crucial factors in the development of trust\nbetween individuals. Our model bridges a somewhat surpris-\ning gap between social identity and networks theories and\ntrust research. These areas of inquiry offer considerable\ninsight regarding social forces that underlie development of\ntrust, and our study combines these insights into a cogent\nmodel.\n1Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia\n2Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRoxanne Zolin, School of Management, Queensland University of\nTechnology, 9th Floor, Z Block, 2 George St., Brisbane, Queensland 4001,\nAustralia.\nEmail: r.zolin@qut.edu.au\nHow Emergent Roles and Structures\nCreate Trust in Hastily Formed\nInterorganizational Teams\nRoxanne Zolin1 and Deborah E.

By social identities, we mean people's self-\nconcepts as determined by their membership in salient\nsocial groups (Turner, Oakes, Haslam, & McGarty, 1994).\nBy social structures, we mean connections among people\nand the patterns that those connections form within a social\nenvironment. Specifically, we propose a theoretical model\nto explain how organizational identities, identity-based\nexpectations, emergent boundary-spanning roles, informal\nprofessional ties, and structural equivalence in the profes-\nsional network shape trust among colleagues in a multior-\nganizational setting. Our proposed model is depicted in\nTo test our theoretical model, we collected time-lagged\ndata from three cohorts of military officers who were begin-\nning a full-time MBA program at a military university. In\nthis defense-oriented environment, people's social identities\nare strongly linked to their membership in the Army, Navy,\nAir Force, or Marines. All of the participants had prior lead-\nership experience within their own organizations, but in this\nvenue, members of these distinct organizations were sud-\ndenly required to work together on time-sensitive organiza-\ntional analysis projects. This study used military identity,\nwillingness to rely on generic members of each organization\n(Army, Navy, etc.), professional relations, and network\nstructures to predict dyadic trust a few weeks after the par-\nticipants' initial meeting. The research makes three contri-\nbutions to the theory of trust development in\ninterorganizational performance settings. First, we distin-\nguish between the roles of organizational identities and per-\nceptions in development of professional ties and trust.\nSecond, we discern the roles of direct professional ties,\nboundary-spanning activity, and structural equivalence in\ncreating trust. Finally, we sort out the direct and mediated\neffects of the organizational and social factors as they impact\ntrust.\nFormation of Interpersonal Trust\nInterpersonal trust can be based on affect (positive feelings\ntoward another person), assessments of likely trustworthi-\nness (cognition-based trust; Frazier, Johnson, Gavin, Gooty,\nthe context (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003; Rousseau et\nal., 1998), the history of the relationship (Ferrin, Bligh, &\nZolin & Hinds, 2004), and even subliminal cues (Huang &\nMurnighan, 2010). Social identities and networks provide\nkey foundations for trust (or distrust) as they shape percep-\ntions and professional interactions.\nCharacteristic-based trust can result from perceived social\nsimilarity or from beliefs about particular social groups.\nNorms of obligation and cooperation based on social similar-\nity, such as shared organizational membership, may produce\ntrust (Zucker, 1986). Homophily--liking others whom we\nsee as similar to ourselves (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &\nCook, 2001)--may indirectly build trust by fostering inter-\npersonal relationships that produce trust (Krackhardt, 1992).\nWhether directly, through social identification, or indirectly\nthrough relation-building, people tend to trust others who\nshare the same social categories as themselves (Kramer,\n1999). In addition, people tend to develop generalized feel-\nings and expectations toward well-defined social groups,\nsuch that these attitudes may affect trust toward individual\nmembers of those groups. In the current study, we distin-\nguish shared organizational identities from identity-based\nexpectations as sources of trust, with attention to the poten-\ntial mediating role of interpersonal relationships.\nProcess-based trust arises through personal experiences\nof repeated exchanges between people (Zucker, 1986). These\nexchanges can create dyadic ties, emergent roles, and net-\nwork structures. For example, interactions that are required\nby an organization's formal structure can lead to develop-\nment of informal professional networks (Brass, 1981).\nWithin the network, people have professional ties to some\ncolleagues, but they may develop more complex structural\nTrust\nShared\nOrganizational\nIdentity\nRely on organization\nStructural\nEquivalence\nBoth Boundary\nSpanners\nProfessional\nTies\n(Mediation H5)\nFigure 1. Proposed model of trust development.\nZolin and Gibbons 3\nsimilarities with others. For example, two unconnected peo-\nple may play similar social roles or occupy similar positions\nwithin the network. These structural similarities could then\nlead them to interact with each other. Through these social\nprocesses, the outcomes of early trusting behavior affect sub-\nsequent perceptions of coworkers (Mayer et al., 1995), and\ntrusting relations can develop. In the current study, we\napproach process-based trust by examining the informal pro-\nfessional network and its effects on the formation of dyadic\ntrust.\nInterorganizational environments often bring together a\nvariety of people who lack knowledge of each others' histo-\nries and trustworthiness, but they usually do know which\norganization each person belongs to. In this situation, organi-\nzational identities and expectations are likely to influence the\ndevelopment of professional relationships, and thereby affect\ntrust. At the same time, we suspect that boundary-spanners\nwho are given to relation-building outside their own identity\ngroup (in this case, their organization) are more likely to\nmeet, appreciate each other, and to form dyadic ties that lead\nto trust. As the professional network grows, people who\ninteract with many of the same others are also more likely to\ndevelop interpersonal ties and trust. In the following pages,\nwe further explain our reasoning and formally hypothesize\nrelations between these social forces and trust.\nProfessional Ties, Structural Equivalence, and\nTrust\nSocial networks grow as people enter a new environment,\nbegin to interact, and build relationships. Over time, profes-\nsional relationships between coworkers accumulate and form\npatterns of interconnected ties. People who interact with the\nsame coworkers become structurally equivalent--occupying\nthe same position within the social network. These two types\nof relations, direct ties and structural equivalence, are often\nrelated, but they have been shown to exercise distinct influ-\nences on many outcomes (Gibbons & Olk, 2003). Their\npotentially discrepant roles in the development of trust, like-\nwise, can and should be distinguished as fundamental contri-\nbutions to existing research.\nAs a professional relationship grows stronger, it is likely\nto involve increasing trust in the partner. This process may be\niterative, such that a new professional relationship begins to\nbuild trust, and growing trust increases the strength of the\nprofessional relationship. Trust relationships are directed\n(Ferrin et al., 2007), such that the perceptions held by Alice\nabout her relationship with Bob and her trust for him may\ndiffer from Bob's perceptions of and trust toward Alice.\nThrough this directed relationship-forging and trust-building\nprocess, we expect to find that the perceived strength of a\nprofessional relationship with a colleague predicts the extent\nof trust toward that colleague.\nHypothesis 1a: The perceived strength of a professional\ntie to a colleague is positively associated with trust toward\nthat colleague.\nAs people begin to interact and develop connections, the\npattern of their relationships affects attitudes and behaviors.\nFor example, informal network position can contribute to a\ndyad's ability to establish a positive trust climate (Williams,\n2005), and the presence of many shared professional con-\ntacts is likely to create a feeling of mutual belonging. When\ntwo people are similarly related to many of the same col-\nleagues, they are subject to many of the same social influ-\nences and information flows. This structural equivalence can\nlead to the development of a direct tie as mutual contacts\nserve to bring the two people together (Heider, 1958).\nStructural equivalence may also provide an opportunity, dis-\ntinct from a direct tie, to develop trust. Shared ties to third\nparties have a positive effect on behavior within dyads, so\npeople who are connected to many of the same others might\nexpect reliable performance from each other (Ferrin, Dirks,\n& Shah, 2006). This could be reinforced through third-party\npolicing and reputational effects. Several studies have shown\nthat connections among one's ties increase trust (e.g., Burt,\nsuch that a dyad's embeddedness in a social network\nincreases the likelihood that the members will be willing to\nrely on each other. Ferrin et al. (2006) attributed this to the\nmediating effects of shared network ties on organizational\ncitizenship behaviors. The similarity of two people's posi-\ntions in the professional network, then, may distinctly affect\ntrust toward each other, and we propose that structural equiv-\nalence fosters direct professional ties while bolstering trust\nbetween individuals.\nHypothesis 1b: Structural equivalence in the professional\nnetwork is positively related to the strength of the profes-\nsional tie between colleagues.\nHypothesis 1c: Structural equivalence in the professional\nnetwork is positively related to trust between colleagues.\nSocial Identities, Perceptions, and Roles That\nBuild Professional Ties\nPeople are attracted to each other based on common attitudes\nand values, goals, and objectives (Newcomb, 1961). The\nmore activities people share, the more they will share infor-\nmation and opinions, and develop stronger sentiments toward\neach other (Homans, 1950). During this process, ideas about\none's contacts develop. Although formal organizational\nstructures can facilitate or even force the maintenance of pro-\nfessional relationships (Zucker, Darby, Brewer, & Peng,\nand instrumentality (Burt, 1992; Markovsky & Lawler,\n1994) are likely to contribute to relation-building in\n4 SAGE Open\ninterorganizational settings. In addition, we propose that\norganizational boundary-spanners will tend to find each\nother, develop professional ties, and build trust.\nShared organizational identity and the development of profes-\nsional ties and trust. Membership in a particular organization\nmay create an identity that draws people together, and\nimpressions about other organizations may influence their\nattitudes and behaviors toward others. Similarity between\npersons often fosters supportive relations (Feld, 1982; Mars-\nden, 1988), and people who see themselves as members of a\nparticular social group often prefer others who are members\nof the same social group (Brewer & Kramer, 1986). Organi-\nzational identity, including characteristics that members\nbelieve are central, distinctive, and enduring (Dutton, Duke-\nrich, & Harquail, 1994), serves to mediate how people think,\nfeel, and behave (Gecas, 1982). When viewed as a process of\nself-definition and self-categorization, organizational iden-\ntity can strengthen how individuals categorize themselves\nwithin their organization (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). When\norganization membership is very salient, as occurs in venues\nthat bring together known competitors, we can expect shared\nmembership to support the development of informal profes-\nsional ties between people. The reverse may also be true--\nwe can expect fewer and weaker ties to form between\nmembers of disparate organizations, even when the context\nsupports or demands equal interaction among individuals\nregardless of organizational membership.\nShared organizational identities are also likely to increase\ntrust. We are more inclined to trust people who share the\nsame social categories as ourselves (Kramer, 1999). Thus,\nattributions of trustworthiness can be based on shared orga-\nnizational identities. Belonging to the same organization also\ngives coworkers a shared organizational future, which can\ncreate the shadow of the future (Axelrod, 1984). This means\nthat dyads who are likely to meet again in the future are\nlikely to trust each other more, because betrayal or benevo-\nlence might be reciprocated at a later date. Hence, both\nshared identity and future expectations support greater trust\nbetween people from the same organization than between\npeople who identify with different organizations. Coming\nfrom different organizations reduces the expectation of\nfuture interactions and consequently reduces trust. For all of\nthese reasons, we anticipate that shared organizational iden-\ntity will increase the strength of direct professional ties and\nlevels of trust between people in a multiorganizational\nsetting.\nHypothesis 2a: Shared organizational identity increases\nthe strength of professional ties between colleagues.\nHypothesis 2b: Shared organizational identity increases\ntrust between colleagues.\nPreexisting opinions about organizations and the development of\nprofessional ties and trust.\nOpinions regarding social\ncollectives are often applied to members of those collectives\n(Ashforth & Mael, 1989). For example, if two people differ\nin their membership in a demographic group, each person's\nbeliefs about people from the other's group may shape their\nexpectations regarding each other. Stereotypes create both\npositive and negative expectations about the behavior of oth-\ners (Kramer, 1999). As a result, in interorganizational set-\ntings, relation-building and trust may be influenced by\norganizational stereotypes. The belief that an organization is\ncompetent is likely to increase the development of a profes-\nsional tie with a member of that organization, and low evalu-\nations of an organization's competence are likely to reduce\nrelation-building and trust toward members of that organiza-\ntion. In our study, we apply this to beliefs about various mili-\ntary organizations (e.g., Navy, Army, etc.) and civilians, and\nwe propose that an individual's preexisting willingness to\nrely on a particular organization will influence his or her\nrelation-building and trust toward specific members of that\norganization.\nHypothesis 3a: Willingness to rely on particular organi-\nzations is positively related to the strength of the profes-\nsional ties that develop with colleagues from those\norganizations.\nHypothesis 3b: Willingness to rely on particular organi-\nzations is positively related to the level of trust that devel-\nops toward colleagues from those organizations.\nBoundary-spanners and the development of professional ties and\ntrust.In multiorganizational settings, boundary-spanners--\npeople who build relationships with members of different\norganizations--may play crucial integrating roles that bring\nthem together. Organizational boundary-spanning in practice\nis a visible, and therefore salient, aspect of role performance\n(Levina & Vaast, 2005). The role of a boundary-spanner has\nlong been recognized as a valuable activity in organizations\nand teams (Keller, Holland, & Winford, 1975; Leifer & Del-\nbecq, 1978), and successful boundary-spanning can lead to\nbetter team performance (Druskat & Wheeler, 2003). While\nboundary-spanning roles are sometimes assigned, for exam-\nple, Purchasing Officer or Sales Representative, boundary-\nspanning roles also emerge and develop in practice (Levina\n& Vaast, 2005), because boundary-spanning activities are\nmore attractive to some than to others (Keller et al., 1975).\nBecause they naturally develop external relationships,\nboundary-spanners from different organizations may be\nmore likely to connect with each other. In addition, homoph-\nily may increase the attraction between boundary-spanners if\nthey recognize their propensity for interorganizational ties as\nan important similarity. Thus, we propose that two boundary-\nspanning colleagues are more likely to initiate a direct pro-\nfessional tie than if one of them was not a boundary-spanner.\nFor similar reasons, boundary-spanners may also be more\nlikely to trust each other as they recognize similarities in the\nway they behave and interact. For example, their intrinsic\nZolin and Gibbons 5\nopenness to social interaction with people from different\norganizations may lead them to trust each other more than\nthey would trust someone who maintains most of his or her\nties within one organization.\nHypothesis 4a: When two people are boundary-spanners\nin the same interorganizational setting, they are more\nlikely to develop stronger professional relationships than\nif they are not.\nHypothesis 4b: When two people are boundary-spanners\nin the same interorganizational setting, they are more\nlikely to develop greater trust toward each other than if\nthey are not.\nMediation of Social Influences on Trust\nAs we have discussed, professional relationships may be\nfounded partially on social identities, expectations, and\nroles. These social influences, while potentially affecting\ntrust directly, may be mediated or replaced over time by the\ninterpersonal relationships that they help to form. This\nnotion aligns with research showing that perceived risk is\nrelated to trust early in a working relationship but not later,\nwhen experience provides specific information about the\nother person's behavior (Mayer et al., 1995; Zolin, Hinds,\nFruchter, & Levitt, 2004). Similarly, interorganizational\nsocial identities, expectations, and roles may create general\nimpressions of trustworthiness, but their effects may be\nchanneled and adjusted through formation of professional\nrelationships. As Ben-Shalom, Lehrer, and Ben-Ari (2005)\nfound in their qualitative field study, early impressions\nbased on categorical information can foster interaction that\ncreates social structures that later develop trust. In an inter-\norganizational environment, we expect to find that organiza-\ntional identities, organizational expectations, and concurrent\nboundary-spanning all create opportunities for interaction.\nThese opportunities create professional ties that, in turn,\nsupport trust.\nHypothesis 5: The effects of organizational identities,\norganizational expectations, and concurrent boundary-\nspanning roles on trust are mediated by professional ties\nbetween the truster and the trustee.\nMethod\nThe hypothesized relationships were tested at the dyadic\nlevel in three cohorts of incoming master's students in a pro-\ngram that is designed for experienced military officers.\nParticipants included 81 active duty military officers from\nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, plus two civilians\nfrom government organizations. The military work context\nand maturity of students make this population a better data\nsource for work-related studies than is available in many\nuniversity settings (Zolin, Fruchter, & Levitt, 2003). Nearly\nall of the students had several years of work experience\nbetween the time that they received their bachelor's degrees\nand the time that they entered this program. Most of them\nheld highly responsible leadership positions, regularly over-\nseeing others' work in routine and crisis environments, and\nall had experienced the strong indoctrination that accompa-\nnies membership in a military organization. Performance in\nthe MBA program would affect their ability to gain future\npromotions, so development of effective working relation-\nships to support the successful completion of courses was\nimportant.\nThis population is particularly appropriate for testing our\ntheoretical model because of participants' very clear, salient,\nand comparable organizational identities. All of the students\nhad chosen long-term careers within their particular military\norganizations, and military membership was immediately\nrecognized by everyone in the cohort because students\nattended class in uniform every Tuesday. Alongside the\nstrong military identification, this population demonstrated a\ngenerally high need for achievement that may not represent\nthe general population. All three of the cohorts in this study\nincluded Air Force and Navy officers. Cohort 3 had no Army\nmembers and Cohort 1 had no Marine officers. Professional\ncomposition of the three cohorts appears in Table 1.\nData Collection Procedures\nIndividual and relational data were collected in three\nOrganizational Behavior classes with the primary purpose of\nteaching students to analyze social networks. Each person's\nwillingness to rely on members from each military organiza-\ntion (e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) was measured\nnear the beginning of the course. Professional relationships\nand dyadic trust were measured using a standard online net-\nwork survey in the sixth to seventh weeks. We also obtained\npermission from the university's institutional review board\nto use archival data from the courses for this study.\nWe controlled for nominal membership in the same proj-\nect team. Students formed project teams between the time of\nthe initial survey (about willingness to rely on members of\neach military organization) and the time of the network sur-\nvey. The project required students to analyze an organiza-\ntion's environment, culture, structure, motivation system,\nTable 1. Professional Composition of the Three Cohorts.\n6 SAGE Open\nleadership, power and influence issues, and anticipated\nthreats and opportunities, then make theoretically sound rec-\nommendations for organization leaders. The warm-up\nassignment was to select two similar organizations and com-\npare their cultures. Students accomplished this culture com-\nparison during the 6 weeks of our study, and they knew that\nthey would later be required to work together on the in-depth\norganizational analysis. It seems reasonable to expect that\nparticipation in the culture comparison and anticipation of\nthe upcoming project created opportunities for interaction\nthat could foster professional ties and trust.\nMeasures of Shared Organizational Membership\nand Reliance on Organization Members\nShared organizational membership. To measure shared orga-\nnizational membership in a military service, we matched\nindividuals within each cohort according to their service\nmembership, creating binary matrices in which a 0 at the\njunction of Alice's row and Bob's column indicates that they\nhave different membership and a 1 indicates that they have\nthe same membership.\nReliance on organization members.Willingness to rely on\nmembers of a particular organization was measured by ask-\ning participants to \"Imagine that you need to compose a\nrapid response team\" (a situation that is familiar to most\nmilitary officers), and then to rank each branch of military\nservice along with civilians in the order in which they would\nchoose to contact them. \"Rely on organization\" was con-\nverted to dyadic matrices in which each cell contains the\nranking ascribed by the row person to the military service of\nthe column person.\nRelationship Measures\nAll participants were asked to complete an online survey\nabout their relationships with others in their cohort in the\nsixth or seventh week. This exercise was not graded, and\nthere was no penalty for noncompliance. Participants were\nasked to select (from a list) the names of everyone from their\ncohort whom they knew. For each person whom they knew,\nthey were asked to indicate the extent to which they had a\nprofessional relationship with that person and the extent to\nwhich they were willing to rely on that person. After comple-\ntion of the survey, names were replaced with numbers.\nNetwork studies differ from individual-level studies in\nseveral regards. One difference is that we focus on the inten-\nsity and pattern of ties within each type of relation. To do\nthis, we describe the relation types that we want to measure,\nand we ask respondents to indicate the extent to which they\nhave each type of relation with each other person in the social\nsetting. It is customary when presenting lists of names to ask\nrespondents to skip names of people whom they do not know.\nOur survey was conducted online, and respondents used\nLikert-type scales to report the intensity of their professional\nrelations and willingness to rely on each person. Table 2\nshows the instructions and format for the relationship\nquestions.\nProfessional ties. Working with the list of names that they had\nchosen, participants used a 1 to 5 scale to indicate the extent\nto which they had \"a professional relationship with each of\nthe people\" they had selected, as follows: 1 = minimal rela-\ntionship, 3 = moderate relationship, 5 = extensive relation-\nship. All skipped names were coded as 0. When aggregated\nfor each cohort, these individual responses formed a matrix\nof directed professional relationships, with values ranging\nfrom 0 (no relationship) to 5. In keeping with standard net-\nwork measurement practices, this is a single-item measure.\nTrust.Respondents also indicated beside each name how\nwilling they would be \"to rely upon this person if a rapid\nresponse was required\" using a 1 to 7 rating scale in which\n1 = not at all willing, and 7 = completely willing. These data\nwere recoded by subtracting 4 from each value, such that a\nTable 2.

This allowed us to accurately code people whom the\nrespondent did not know with zeros to represent a neutral\nattitude. When aggregated for each cohort, these individual\nresponses formed a matrix of directed reliance relationships,\nwith values ranging from -3 (unwilling to rely on this per-\nson) through 0 (neutral) to 3 (completely willing to rely on\nthis person). In keeping with standard network measurement\npractices, this is a single-item measure.\nBoth boundary-spanners.We measured boundary-spanning\nacross military services using UCINET 6 (Borgatti, Everett,\n& Freeman, 2002). The routine that we selected (per Gould\n& Fernandez, 1989) indicates the extent to which a person's\nboundary-spanning activity falls below or above what would\nbe expected if group membership had no effect on interac-\ntion patterns. Those whose boundary-spanning activity\nexceeded the random expectation were coded with a 1, and\nall others were coded with a 0. This level of boundary-span-\nning activity is meaningful because, as we will see below,\norganizational membership had a strong positive effect on\nthe network, such that people were significantly more likely\nto have in-group ties than cross-group ties. We created a\nboundary-spanning matrix that includes a 1 at the intersec-\ntion of two boundary-spanners, and otherwise a 0.\nResults\nWe used chi-square tests to compare observed with random\ndistributions of ties among membership groups to determine\nwhether service membership influenced the pattern of ties\nwithin each of the three cohorts. All of the hypothesized rela-\ntionships were then tested using the quadratic assignment pro-\ncedure (QAP) in UCINET 6 (Borgatti et al., 2002). QAP is a\nnonparametric method for testing significance of correlation\nbetween two matrices. The procedure constructs a reference\ndistribution of random parameters that could have been derived\nfrom a data set with the same structure as the data set under\nevaluation. Then the significance of correlation between matri-\nces is determined by comparison with the random distribution.\nThe nonparametric testing is important because network data\ninclude autocorrelation among observations that biases ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) tests to the point that significance tests\nare nearly useless (Krackhardt, 1988). QAPdoes not depend on\nthe assumption of nondependence that underlies standard cor-\nrelation and linear regression procedures.\nSeveral QAP procedures have been developed for multi-\nple regression (MRQAP), including an approach that deals\nparticularly well with autocorrelation that occurs across the\nrows (outgoing relations of each originating person) and col-\numns (incoming relations received by each person) of a net-\nwork matrix (Dekker, Krackhardt, & Snijders, 2007). We\nused this procedure from the UCINET 6 analysis package to\ntest predicted effects on professional relations and trust.\nBecause the correlation between network variables and\nnonnetwork variables is limited by the structure of the matri-\nces (Krackhardt, 1988), the key statistic in QAP correlations\nand regressions is the p value, not the correlation value.\nSome correlations that seem small may be highly significant,\nand pairwise correlations of equal size may not be equally\nsignificant.\nStructural equivalence was calculated as the correlation of\nthe ties of each pair of people. Resulting values range from\n-1 if two people's ties are exactly opposite to 1 if their ties\nare identical.\nTo obtain a global test of our hypotheses, we converted\nthe matrices from all three cohorts into directed dyads. Each\ncohort yielded N \u00d7 (N - 1) dyads, which sum to 2,224\ndirected dyads. For each relation, we excerpted Alice's\nobservations of Bob and all other members of their cohort,\nBob's observations of Alice and all other members of their\ncohort, and so on. To address the autocorrelation that natu-\nrally occurs in network data, we used a fixed-effects regres-\nsion with a component to control for individual idiosyncrasies\n(Wooldridge, 2010) of the respondents across the observa-\ntions of cohort members. The fixed-effects regressions were\nintended as a second look at the data, to determine if we\nwould get similar results using an alternate analysis method.\nWhile we did control for the within-respondent autocorrela-\ntion that occurs because some people are more gregarious\nthan others, this method is not as robust against autocorrela-\ntion as the MRQAP, so it should be viewed as a secondary\nanalysis.\nPredicting Professional Ties and Trust in\nParticular Colleagues\nQAP correlations among dyadic variables for all three\ncohorts appear in Table 3.

The Army people had low density of professional\nties with all groups except the Air Force members. Trust ties\nin Cohort 2 were denser than random within two organiza-\ntions, and there was a general trend to trust fewer than ran-\ndom out-group members, except if they were from the Air\nForce. Professional ties were denser than random among\nmembers of two of the three organizations represented in\nCohort 3 (the lone civilian had no in-group). Trust ties in\nCohort 3 were also denser than random within all three\ngroups, but the pattern of ties to out-group members varied.\nHypothesis 2a was also supported by QAP regressions in\ntwo out of three cohorts (see Table 5, Cohort 1:  = -.018, ns;\nThis positive relationship between shared organizational\nidentity and professional ties was also significant in the\nfixed-effects regression analysis (Table 7, Model 3,  = .32,\np < .001), and thus Hypothesis 2a was supported.\nHypothesis 2b, which proposed that shared organizational\nidentity will be positively related to trust, was only supported\nof effects, however, was positive in all three cohorts, and the\nfixed-effects regression model found overall support for this\nHypothesis 3a, that individuals' willingness to rely on\nparticular organizations would predict professional ties with\nmembers of the groups, was not supported.

It was also significant in the fixed-effects\nHypothesis 4a.\nHypothesis 4b proposed that when both are boundary-\nspanners, there will be greater trust. This relationship was\nsignificant in two of the three cohorts (see Table 4, Cohort 1:\np < .01). This was also significant in the fixed-effects model\nsupported.\nHypothesis 5 proposed that the effects of shared organiza-\ntional identities, organizational expectations, and concurrent\nboundary-spanning on trust would be mediated by profes-\nsional ties. Because organizational expectations were not\nsignificantly related to trust (Hypothesis 3b), no mediation\nanalysis was conducted for that variable. Tests were con-\nducted, following Baron and Kenny (1996), to determine\nwhether professional ties mediated effects of shared organi-\nzational identity and boundary-spanning on trust.\nShared organizational identity (see Table 6: r = .08, p <\nwere significantly related to trust. Shared organizational\nidentity and professional ties were significantly related to\neach other (Table 6: r = .10, p < .001). Finally, when shared\norganizational identity and professional ties were both\nincluded in a model predicting trust, professional ties were\nsignificant in predicting trust (Table 7, Model 2:  = .55, p <\n.001), while shared organizational identity became nonsig-\nnificant (Table 7, Model 2:  = .09, ns). This reduction in\neffect of organizational identity on trust when professional\nties were included in the regression indicates that profes-\nsional ties mediate the relationship between shared organiza-\ntional identity and trust (Baron & Kenny, 1996).\nSimilarly, trust was significantly related to concurrent\nfessional ties (see Table 6: r = .65, p < .001), and concurrent\nboundary-spanning and professional ties were significantly\nrelated to each other (Table 6: r = .15, p < .001). When con-\ncurrent boundary-spanning and professional ties were both\ncombined in a model predicting trust, professional ties (Table\ntrust, while concurrent boundary-spanning became nonsig-\nnificant (Table 7, Model 2:  = -.07, ns). This reduction of\nsignificance indicates that professional ties mediate the rela-\ntionship between concurrent boundary-spanning and trust\n(Baron & Kenny, 1996), such that people who are both\nboundary-spanners are more likely to develop professional\nties to each other, and those professional ties lead them to\ngreater trust.\nSummary of Results\nAlthough there was a significant relationship between struc-\ntural equivalence and professional ties, these relationships\nTable 5.

Concurrent boundary-spanning was\nalso related to trust in two samples and in the full-sample\nanalysis, but this relationship was mediated by professional\nties. In summary, we found that shared organizational iden-\ntity and concurrent boundary-spanning roles affect profes-\nsional ties, which influence trust (see Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nWhen people from multiple organizations are brought\ntogether for a common purpose, individuals generally need\nto build new professional relationships and identify others on\nwhom they can rely for timely and useful support. We have\nasked how these professional and trusting relations develop\namong unknown actors in such interorganizational settings.\nTheory suggests that social identities, social expectations,\nand emerging network structures will affect development of\ntrust. We found positive effects of shared organizational\nidentities and emergent boundary-spanning roles on trust,\nmediated by the development of professional ties. The initial\nsocial identities and emergent structural factors seem to\nbring people together to form professional relationships,\nwhich develop into trust. This result aligns with Zucker's\n(1986) theory of process-based trust, as identity-based per-\nceptions, emergent roles, and shared professional networks\ntogether built trust.\nAs expected, organizational identities, which are strong\namong military people, resulted in greater relation-building\nand trust among members of the same service. It was surpris-\ning, then, that willingness to rely on particular organizations\ndid not affect professional ties or trust. We know from work-\ning with military officers that opinions about the various\nmilitary services are often strong and stable over time. Why\nwould military service identities create in-group preferences,\nwhile relative willingness to rely on the various services did\nnot transfer to people who were members of those services?\nIt is possible that working in an academic environment, the\nrespondents may have \"given the benefit of the doubt\" to\nmembers of less-respected organizations, perhaps viewing\nthem as exceptions to the stereotypes. Alternatively, profes-\nsional ties and trust may have arisen from positive affect\ntoward one's own group, without regard for more analytical\nprocesses. This finding hints at the possibility that feelings,\nnot cognition, played the major role.\nAn interesting contribution of this study is that, despite\nthe clear relationship between direct professional ties and\nstructural equivalence, only the direct ties affected trust. The\napparent positive correlation between structural equivalence\nand trust in all three cohorts disappeared completely when\nthe other variables were included in regressions predicting\ntrust. In fact, when controlling for direct ties, the relationship\nbetween structural equivalence and trust was negative and\nsignificant in one cohort, possibly indicating some suspicion\nintroduced to professional relationships by the structural\nequivalence between participants. This aligns with Burt's\ntion, but it does not align with theories of social monitoring\nas a guarantor of trustworthy behavior.\nWe began this study with three research goals. First, we\nexamined the roles of organizational identities and percep-\ntions in the early development of professional ties and trust.\nSecond, we differentiated the roles of direct ties and struc-\ntural equivalence in creating trust. Finally, we sorted out the\ndirect and mediating factors in trust-building in a multiorga-\nnizational context. This research contributes to theories of\ntrust development by showing how the development of pro-\nfessional ties mediates the effects of antecedent social identi-\nties and boundary-spanning roles on trust. The study\ncontributes to social network theory by showing that,\nalthough structural equivalence is related to direct ties, it is\nnot necessarily related to trust. This implies that social moni-\ntoring and shared information flows that are available to\nstructurally equivalent colleagues are not as relevant for trust\ndevelopment as are the short-term experience or budding\naffect that may be present in the direct tie.\nOne managerial implication of these findings is that when\nsetting up a new interorganizational group, attention to the\ndevelopment of professional ties will likely support the\nTrust\nShared\nOrganizational\nIdentity\nStructural\nEquivalence\nBoth Boundary\nSpanners\nProfessional\nTies\n(Mediation)\nFigure 2. Summary of results.\ndevelopment of trust. Organizational diversity could be even\nmore important than other forms of diversity in some interor-\nganizational contexts, so creation of new, shared identities\nmay be crucial for building a truly interorganizational pro-\nfessional network. A less intuitive implication is that greater\nrecognition and encouragement should also be given to\nemergent boundary-spanning activity. It is ironic that bound-\nary-spanners may trust each other more than other members\nof their own organizations. It is also interesting that the\nboundary-spanning roles in our study emerged spontane-\nously, leaving the possibility that individual attributes under-\nlay both the boundary-spanning and the increased trust\nbetween boundary-spanners.\nLimitations of the Study and Future Research\nThis research was limited to the study of three cohorts of\nmilitary officers in an educational context. Although this\ninterorganizational environment was suitable as a data source\nfor the present study, additional research in other contexts\nwith civilian participants is needed to determine generaliz-\nability of the findings. Military organizations endeavor to\ncreate strong social identities for their members, such that\nthe organization becomes a crucial part of members' self-\nimage. Because of this, participants in this study may have\nbeen more likely than members of many other organizations\nto evaluate people in terms of in-group and out-group sta-\ntuses with regard to organizational membership. We expect\nthat the findings generalize to settings in which people iden-\ntify strongly with their organizations, but the results could\ndiffer among people who are not socially integrated into their\norganizations.\nAlthough we found a positive relationship between shared\norganizational identity and trust, it was not significant in all\ncohorts. Furthermore, we did not attempt to discern whether\nshared identities built trust via homophily, the \"Shadow of the\nFuture,\" or another mechanism. A greater focus on this pro-\ncess in future research could expand our understanding of\nidentity-based trust. In addition, the discovery of greater tie-\nbuilding between boundary-spanners raises several interest-\ning questions. Do boundary-spanners develop ties with each\nother because of homophily or propinquity, as we hypothe-\nsized, or could there be some individual differences at play?\nFor example, a psychologist might argue that two people with\noutgoing personalities are more likely to become boundary-\nspanners and to meet each other than two people who are\nmore introverted. Our study did not distinguish between these\npossibilities, and we defer the question to future research.\nFinally, we believe that future studies could fruitfully investi-\ngate how the factors that we have identified in early trust for-\nmation continue to influence trust over the long term.\nConclusion\nWith a faster tempo in the formation of joint ventures and\nmultiorganization responses to disasters, leaders in\norganizations need a greater understanding of factors that\ndevelop professional ties and trust. Our study indicates that\ndyads who share organizational identity, boundary-spanning\nroles, and mutual professional contacts are more likely to\nhave a direct professional tie and greater trust. Despite the\npositive relationship between direct professional ties and\nstructural equivalence, however, only the direct ties increased\ntrust. It appears, therefore, that the familiarity and the experi-\nence of a direct relationship, rather than the social control\nintrinsic to structural equivalence, serve as a major catalyst\nfor trust. Greater attention should be paid to the development\nof professional ties and the support for emergent boundary-\nspanners in hastily formed teams, as these appear to be pre-\nconditions for the development of trust between colleagues.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nsupported by the Cebrowski Institute at the Naval Postgraduate\nReferences\nAshforth, B.
