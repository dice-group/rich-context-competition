Latin\nAmerica, specifically, has seen a marked increase in the\nnumber of homes headed by single female mothers, these\nconstituting more than a third of all households. This impacts\nthe lives of women who are already facing a limited job mar-\nket, reduced salaries, and the responsibility of single parent-\ning without family support, factors aggravated by a dramatic\nrise in poverty levels (Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9rica\n2000, the number of households headed by single female\nparents increased, in Latin America, from 10% to 12%. This\ngrowing tendency in recent years is principally due to the\nrising number of separated and divorced couples (Arriagada,\ncontributes to greater vulnerability, mainly in the Caribbean\nIn the past decade, in Colombia, for example, the number\nof households headed by single mothers was a very prevalent\nfactor in urban areas. This decade saw family organization and\nstructure undergo diverse changes, resulting from shifts in\nfemale heads of households, whether unmarried, separated, or\nwidowed women. Likewise, research about households\nheaded by single mothers in other developing countries has\n8.7% in Brazil, and 6.4% to 7.5% in Chile. This increase has\nimpacted not only the structure of the traditional family unit\nbut has also had a strong influence on the state of women in\nthe labor force where their presence has almost tripled, mak-\ning them not only the prime emotional but also economic\nwe take a global look at households. According to United\nNations Children's Fund (2007), toward the end of the\nheaded by single mothers. This compares to 24% as regards\nLatin American households.\n1University of Massachusetts Lowell, USA\n2SOS Children's Villages, Lima, Peru\nCorresponding Author:\nBeatriz Alvarado, Cultural Studies Department, University of\nMassachusetts Lowell, 850 Broadway Street, Coburn Hall, Lowell, MA\nEmail: beatriz_alvarado@uml.edu\nSingle, Divorced, or Separated? Factors\nThat Impact the Lives of Women Who\nAre Heads of Household in Lima, Peru\nBeatriz Alvarado1 and Rosa del Carmen Vilchez2\n Keywords\nsingle parent households, single mothers, Peru, divorced women, job market\n2 SAGE Open\nthe country's households were headed by women. Within this\ngroup, the reports present a division based on the condition of\npoverty. It was noted that in the group of homes not affected\nby poverty, a greater proportion of women were heads of\nhousehold, specifically 28 out of every 100. In poor house-\nholds, comparatively, 22 out of every 100 women were head\nof household (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica\n[INEI], 2014a). This would suggest that in the past several\nyears, there has been an increase in both poor and non-poor\nhouseholds headed by women. As regards education level,\nINEI's report also shows a higher rate of illiteracy in single-\nperson households and in extended single parent households:\ning to the type of home they belong to, 42.6% of heads of\ncomposite households, 29.7% of single-person households,\nholds had received higher education. These statistics corrobo-\nrate the studies focusing on one of the main causes of\nseparation and divorce among couples, namely, when wives\nhave a higher education level and greater economic indepen-\ndence than their spouses (Simonsson & Sandstrom, 2011).\nWith respect to marital status, INEI (2010) points out that\n22.6% of male/female heads of single parent nuclear family\nhouseholds and 17.4% of single parent extended family\nhouseholds are single, with no previous spouse. Divorced\nmen/women heads of household predominate in single parent\nnuclear family units (2.7%) and single parent extended family\nHowever, the last two decades have seen a dramatic\nincrease in the number of women on the job. This rose from\nation that the gap between jobs traditionally held by males\nversus females has narrowed (INEI, 2014b). Nevertheless,\nthese percentages tend to shift in cases of marital separation,\nwhich find women most affected due to the great difficulty\nthey face trying to hold down a job while managing a house-\nhold on their own. This problem ultimately results in a sub-\nstantially higher number of single mother-headed households\ncoping with the threat of poverty. Encuesta Nacional de\nHogares's (ENAHO) reports indicate that 23.3% of nuclear\nhouseholds headed by single mothers are at poverty level\nversus 19.4% that are headed by men (ENAHO & INEI,\nThe statistics vary considerably when we look at the\nentire region. According to CEPAL's analysis, female heads\nof household are not necessarily at a lower income level than\nmale heads of household. That is to say, there is no system-\natic difference in poverty levels of households headed by\nmen or women. Some homes headed by women have less\nprobability of operating at poverty level (CEPAL, 2003,\n2004). This group would correspond to an increasingly\ngreater number of economically independent young women\nfrom the region who are single parents.\nNotwithstanding this economic independence, a global,\ngender-focused look at women reveals that they is still the\ngroup that is hardest hit by marital dissolution. Even before\nthis separation, many women find themselves in a dependent\neconomic situation, with respect to their partners, due to\nhousehold and child-rearing duties either completely or par-\ntially preventing them from being wage earners. Likewise,\nits human capital gets hard hit in terms of greater access to\neducation and work opportunities. Faced with the option to\ndivorce or stay married, many women suffer through the for-\nmer \"because of the children,\" because to do the contrary\nwould result in having to divide their time between caring for\nchildren, home, working part or full time, and, in many cases,\nbeing the sole support of their family (Poortman, 2000;\nSorensen & Hill, 2004). Despite the serious emotional,\nsocial, and financial dilemmas that face the women on which\nthis study focuses, their resilience demonstrates their strength\nin coping with the realities of being single parents.\nFor these reasons, it is imperative to understand the social,\nlabor, and personal dynamic of households headed by single\nmothers in a way which also provides us with insight into\ntheir daily lives. There is a scarcity of studies that explore\nthese realities from this specific angle. The purpose of this\nstudy is to explore the experiences of 15 Peruvian women\nwho as a result of separation or divorce became the emo-\ntional, economic, and social mainstay of their children. This\nmultiplicity of roles also carried with it a series of obstacles\nand limitations, as detailed in the study's interviews and\nobservations, further ahead.\nA Look at Identity Theory From the\nStandpoint of Symbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism and identity theory provide the\nframework for this study. We analyzed the experiences of 15\nPeruvian women as heads of household. We use the term\nidentity in this study to mean the image that the participants\nhave of themselves, as separated or divorced mothers, pro-\nfessionals, and heads of household, among other roles. This\nself-image, whether positive or negative, is generated\nthrough behavior that starts developing as they being their\nconjugal separations, as well as society's reactions, to the\nsame transition. This involves, according to Burke (1980),\nsymbolic means as much for the individuals in question as\nfor the social group to which they belong. Individual behav-\nior will tend to adjust itself in accord with past and present\nexperiences, and also with that of the social group's expecta-\ntions (Hollander & Howard, 2000). These individual and col-\nlective experiences are strongly related to issues of power that\ninteractionists pay particular attention when it comes to\noppressive and abusive relationships. Thus, there is a signifi-\ncant correlation between domestic conflicts and structural\ncomponents of power, socio-economic situation, societal pres-\nsure, and the traditional patterns of beliefs that often influence\nAlvarado and Vilchez 3\nthe individual's decision-making ability (Dennis & Martin,\n(2009) states that symbolic interactionism leads us to exam-\nine conflict relationships from the individuals' experiences,\nand their struggles to make proper decisions when their sense\nof self and the situation are perceived as uncertain.\nThe construction of the self and identities happen through\ninteractions with others; in his analysis on human interac-\ntion, Charon (1992) argues that interactionism explains how\nsocial agents negotiate and construct meaning in specific con-\ntexts and social interactions with significant others and the\ngroup in general. It is also a context in which identities are\nnegotiated and influenced by conflicted relationships and sit-\nuations (Lempert, 1994). In their study on identity construc-\ntion and societal roles, Marks and MacDermid (1996) point\nout that we cannot reference a single type of identity; indi-\nviduals take on different roles and, for this reason, assume\nmultiple interacting and influential roles during their lives. If\nthese roles and identities are considered adequate for society,\nthey will be accepted and supported, if not, they will be\nrejected. In this way, according to the roles they exert, indi-\nviduals are affected both socially and personally. In the case\nof single mothers who are also heads of household, societal\nmessages are generally not very encouraging. It is hoped that\nwomen build a family consisting of paternal and maternal fig-\nures that play domestic and public roles. In this way, society\nforms the self that in turn assumes roles that represent diverse\naspects of the social process (Turner, 1991). When women\nabandon this role, their situation becomes doubly compli-\ncated on many levels, principally the financial and social.\nThrough personal and social roles, identity theory signals\nan important aspect to keep in mind, namely, agency. This\nrefers to the capacity of people to reach certain goals in spite\nof changes in their environment. When an individual pos-\nsesses a great capacity for agency, he or she can adapt and\novercome adverse situations. Social and cultural structures,\nhowever, also exert a strong influence over the attainment of\nan individual's goals (Tsushima & Burke, 1999). Thus,\nwithin a culture as strongly patriarchal as the Peruvian, sin-\ngle mothers that are heads of household encounter serious\ncultural and social patterns that, in many cases, limit the\ndevelopment of their goals.\nMethod\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of\n15 Peruvian woman who are single mothers, heads of house-\nhold, and residents of Lima. Descriptive phenomenology\nwas used as the best approach for critical and rigorous analy-\nsis of social groups. In accord with Streubert and Carpenter\n(2003), phenomenology helps us explain the essence of\nexperiences and realities, and the meaning of specific phe-\nnomena. Brink and Wood (1998) describe descriptive phe-\nnomenology as a three-stage process: intuition, analysis, and\ndescription; and those were the strategies used for this study.\nFurthermore, participants were encouraged to provide con-\ncrete examples of their experiences to support their state-\nments. The criteria used for the selection of the participants\nwere that they be professional women that resided in Lima;\nsingle, separated, or divorced; head of household; and have\nminor children living at home.\nWe used structured interviews, each of which lasted more\nthan an hour. This form of interview helped us to produce\nconsistent data that was compared across the participants.\nOur participants were selected using snowball sampling to\nidentify significant cases about our study topic.\nThe interviews were done in Spanish language and\nrecorded and transcribed for subsequent analysis (Strauss &\nCorbin, 1990). They were carried out in participants' work-\nplaces or homes. Following the initial demographic-based\nquestions, three emergent themes were explored: (a) devel-\nopment of the spousal relationship and motherhood, (b)\nimpact of the separation/divorce on the maternal role, and (c)\nexperiences in the single parent home.\nAnalysis and Discussion\nWe analyzed the experiences of 15 Peruvian women, all resi-\ndents of Peruvian urban centers, single mothers, and heads of\nhousehold, ranging in age from 26 to 61 years. All of the\nparticipants have higher education and work outside the\nhome in the area of administration, education, and health\ncare. All were separated or divorced at the time of the inter-\nviews, which took place between March and June 2014. The\nemerging themes that we opted to analyze, based on the\nexperiences related in the interviews, were (a) development\nof the previous spousal relationship and motherhood, (b)\nimpact of the separation/divorce on the maternal role, and (c)\nexperiences in the single parent home.\nDevelopment of the Spousal Relationship and\nMotherhood\nFor this theme, we decided to explore the beginning of the\nrelationship, initial conflicts, and development of the events\nthat led participants to end their conjugal relationship and\ncontinue life as single women.\nIn terms of participants' views on what constitutes family\nlife, all concurred about the importance of bonds of affection\nand mutual support. For the majority, traditional ideas of\nfamily persist: mother, father, and children as a goal to attain.\nFive of the 12 women interviewed maintain the traditional\nnotion of family: mother, father, and children. They define\nfamily as \"a united group\" of members who work for a com-\nmon ideal.\nMy parents raised me to believe that family is the most important\nthing, so when I got married I thought it would be forever and\nthat the two of us would work together to raise our children.\n4 SAGE Open\nI always dreamed of one day having the perfect family: Mom,\nDad, and kids. For me this was always very important. (Naty, 42)\nWhen we shift away from these ideals and explore the\nway participants themselves were raised, the women describe\na strong patriarchy, with their father as the main provider and\ndecision maker and their mother as the caregiver. They also\nrelate situations involving their parents'separations, infideli-\nties, and existence of \"parallel families,\" that is, of a father's\nmistress and the children born from this extramarital union.\nTwo participants described cases of sexual abuse and inap-\npropriate touching within the family. The participants whose\nparents separated affirm that they did not have the \"ideal\"\nfamily.\nMy family has always been dysfunctional; my Dad went after\nany woman who crossed his path . . . (Juana, 61)\nMom was more intelligent and educated, but Dad was a bully,\nand so the bully would win out . . . they didn't fight, but neither\ndid I see any love. (Ariadna, 47)\nHe (her former spouse) comes from the typical home where the\nMom is a submissive, but happy slave. (Ariadna, 47)\nThe strong patriarchal system within the nuclear family\nrepresses, in the words of Denner and Guzman (2006), the\nidentities of the women, situating them within the context of\na dominant culture that leaves little space for their own\nvoices. Products, for the most part, of repressive homes, the\nparticipants manifested two points to consider: five of them\nindicated that they got married after finding out they were\npregnant, and nine indicated that this was their first sexual\nexperience and that they decided to live with their partners to\navoid shame and criticism of their social group. They also\nindicated that the violent, hostile environment of their own\nhomes led them to make hasty decisions to escape these\nrealities.\nI fell in love and believed, like everybody, in the fairy tale. Back\nthen I was blinded by love, eyes closed, no Mom to give me\nadvice, and for Dad, all men were bad, \"Look at me,\" he'd say.\nI married my first boyfriend, a mistake. That's why I let my own\ndaughter get to know more people. (Chio, 39)\nI needed somebody by my side, so I wouldn't feel lonely,\nbecause at 19 nobody thinks about getting married or having\nkids or any of those things. In my case it was because we didn't\nlive with my Mom, we lived with some aunts, and we were\nmistreated. My sister took off with her boyfriend and I got\nFollowing the participants from one family nucleus into\nanother, we saw that the stories did not vary much. The brief\nromance lived gave way to long episodes of tense cohabita-\ntion. The women comment that they opted to initially con-\ntinue their conjugal relationship, justifying acts of violence\nto preserve the paternal image for their children. The marital\nbreak ensued when the justifications were no longer viable.\nThe continuity of abusive relationships at the hand of a dom-\ninating male figure provokes, according to Gage (2005), an\nincrease in violent situations that impact the physical and\nemotional stability of women and children. In spite of the\nserious irresponsibility of their partners with respect to the\ncare and upbringing of their children, these women thought\nthat time would change the situation. The opposite, in fact,\nhappened.\nThe indifference displayed by the women's ex-partners is\nmarkedly seen in the division of roles. All of the women indi-\ncated that they spent more time than their partners on house-\nwork and child care, which interfered with work outside the\nhome and generated much conflict. Four of the women in this\nstudy group were higher wage earners than their partners\nwhile married. They indicate that their work was hard and that\nthey did not have sufficient spousal support in this sense. This\ncorroborates studies that refer to the \"double day,\" that is to the\nsay, work performed by wives in and outside of the home, far\nsurpassing in hours that of the husband's workday. The impact\nthat this has on the wife's emotional and physical stability is\nThe participants expressed their frustration, recalling their\nexpectations at the onset of the relationship, that their part-\nners would provide economic support. As professionals,\nworking outside the home, the participants did not depend\neconomically on their partners; however, the women express\nthat not only were they alone responsible for the care of the\nchildren but also for the complete economic and day-to-day\nmanagement of the home.\nI took care of the home and also worked. I had to ask him to\nhelp, but it was a problem and just created more conflict.\nShare the housework? Nothing doing! I did everything, cared for\nthe house, worked outside the home. His function and role as a\nfather was minimal, and really bothered me. (Lucila, 47)\nMaking the decision to separate was a long process; the\nwomen looked (in the words of one participant) for \"justifi-\ncation to stay with him.\" Performing exhausting household\ntasks on top of submitting to acts of psychological violence,\nfrom the subtlest to the most explicit forms, are constants in\nthe interviews.\nCases of severe physical violence against the women and\nalso their children were documented. There was also a case\nof rape (that resulted in pregnancy) described by the wom-\nan's spouse as a normal occurrence between a couple\n(Bennice & Resick, 2003). The participants also related\ncases of infidelity by their partners that, amid other conflicts,\nsparked the decision to separate.\nPsychological abuse and jealousy were at the root of the\nworst conflicts for me. The insults and the jealousy, the fact that I\nAlvarado and Vilchez 5\nsupposedly did \"nothing for him,\" since I didn't iron his shirts or\nwash his clothes. I asked myself why I kept on in a relationship if\nhe didn't respect me and was with other women. (Eli, 26)\nHe went looking for problems, I couldn't speak or think. He\ndidn't want me to talk or express a thought, because he \"didn't\nwant noise.\" The aggressiveness was getting worse . . . Our\nyoungest was the result of rape. In the end, after many years, I\nreported him to the authorities. (Chio, 39)\nRaised, for the most part, in homes where their identities\nand voice were strongly repressed, the participants had cho-\nsen to live with men who continued the pattern violence that\nhad begun for them in childhood. This tendency echoes the\nanalysis concerning the exposure of children to acts of vio-\nlence during their formative years, and the impact of these\nexperiences on their adult lives (Early Intervention\nThe Impact of Separation or Divorce on the\nWoman, How It Affects Her Maternal Role, and\nIts Impact on the Extended Family\nAfter understanding the motives that led participants to end\ntheir relationships, we went on to explore the impact that this\nrupture had on their lives, as well as on their domestic and\npublic surroundings. One of the greatest concerns of the\nwomen was on the effect that their conjugal separation would\nhave on the lives of their children. Six of them initially\ndecided to continue the relationship so as not to \"shatter the\npaternal image,\" but over time, the women noticed that the\nchildren would be even more damaged if they did not bring\nthe relationship to an end. This feeling concurs with the find-\nings related to women's choices as to continuing or ending\nproblematic relationships for fear of leaving their children\nwithout a father (Afifi, Davis, Denes, & Merrill, 2013).\nI decided to seek a separation for my children. He tried to kill me\ntwice. He wanted to smother me with the pillow, wanted to\nabuse me. My kids witnessed the abuse. At first I thought that\nthey needed a father, but after I realized that this wasn't so.\nMy daughter took the separation well. My life was not easy with\nhim. She doesn't talk much but I feel that with the help of the\npsychologist she is starting to understand. (Ariadna, 42)\nMy daughter is the one that asked me not to go back to her\nfather. (MariEsther, 39)\nThe replies to the question about their emotions following\nthe separation are almost all the same. All describe feeling\nrelieved. In spite of feeling afraid of how to go forward with\ntheir lives, they feel freed from having to carry \"one less bur-\nden.\" Two of the participants expressed feeling guilty after\nthe separation. In this case, the women's immediate family\nplays an important role not only in an emotional but also a\nmaterial sense.\nI feel a sense of relief. I feel somewhat guilty as well, but I also\nfeel like a burden has been taken off of me. It's normal,\nwe women tend to always blame ourselves. In terms of work, I\nfeel less pressured than before, but my work is demanding.\nAt first I felt frustrated. Now I feel calm because I have\nthe support of my mother. If it weren't for her, I'd be afraid.\nIt's as though I'd shaken a gorilla off my back, I was lighter . . .\nI've gotten my strength back, my spirit, my happiness, dreams,\nand the time that I never seemed to have before. (Juana, 61)\nThe women indicate that their families and close friends\nwere an important factor at the moment of making the deci-\nsion to end their relationship. At this moment, in accord with\nCiabattari (2007), the individuals' social capital is funda-\nmental, as it will be in providing valuable support during the\ndifficult transitional stage.\nAs they started out on the path of single parenthood, the\nparticipants spoke of confronting a group of obstacles that\nwere not new for them. As mentioned previously, even when\nthey lived with their partners, they considered themselves as\nheads of household. During the interviews, we gave them a\nlist of factors as related to their new status: social, familial,\nlabor, economic, and emotional. All pointed out that their\nmajor concern, before making the decision to separate, was\nfinancial. Four participants indicated that they set about\norganizing their finances first. They also carefully organized\ntheir job schedule and then found assistance from family,\nfriends, or domestic workers to help care for the children.\nI made my financial plans before the separation; I calculated\ncosts and then told myself, \"Now I can go ahead and do it . . .\"\nFinancially it worked out better. I found work, I got the kids\nbetter organized. He only gives me child support when he feels\nMy siblings help me out with my kids when I get home late or\nwhen I need to travel. My friends and I help each other out\ntaking care of each other's daughters. I'm creating a network of\ngood friends. (Ariadna, 47)\nAfter the separation I had to support myself. A friend found me\na job. I had a young girl that helped me out. And on days that I\ndidn't have anybody, I took my son to work. (Naty, 42)\nIn participants' descriptions, reference to the ex-partner's\neconomic support is either absent, very limited, or given\nbecause of a court mandate. The participants, in general, also\nrefer to their partners' \"long-distance fathering,\" in which no\n6 SAGE Open\nreal effort is made to help with the care, education, or support\nof the children. This reality is a factor behind the high level\nof Latin American children that are growing up, according to\nAli, Cleland, and Shah (2003), without a father's presence in\ntheir lives. This absence potentially impacts scholastic devel-\nopment, family life, and the behavior of the child himself or\nherself. While for the participants conjugal separation repre-\nsented a \"relief\" and even an improvement in terms of their\nprofessional lives, for the children the breakup was processed\nin different ways: Some started to perform better at school,\nwhereas others grew sad, withdrawn, and began to act out.\nMy daughter has always been the top student at her school.\nMy daughter was upset by Father's Day celebrations that\nhappened at her school, they made her sad. This also happened\nat her birthday parties or Christmas celebrations when he wasn't\npresent. (MariEsther, 39)\nI'm always encouraging them, and they've been diligent\nstudents, they earn diplomas, first places. (Gabriela, 53)\nI always get congratulated about my daughter, I admire her and\nshe's a success; my son copies his sister. (Eli, 26)\nHowever, leaving child care in the hands of others has an\nemotional cost which at times can result in the loss of partici-\npants' control over their children.\nI sometimes feel that I'm losing control over them because I\ndon't see them, although we have created ground rules like\nalways letting each other know where we are. (Lucila, 47)\nFor the participants, getting organized at work following\nthe separation meant longer hours away from home due to the\nneed to work full time or take on tasks of greater responsibil-\nity. In this study, all of the women stated that they worked an\naverage of 8 to 12 hr per day that represents a great challenge\nin terms of finding a balance between work and family.\nAfter analyzing the impact of the separation on their lives\nand immediate environment, we interviewed the participants\nabout their identities, a term which, for Uhlmann (2004),\nrefers to emotions, feeling, beliefs, and desires of social\nagents, which are strongly influenced by sociocultural\ncontexts.\nTheir Experiences as Single Parents\nThe participants' decision to end their marriages indicates\ntheir will to exit violent, abusive relationships and wish to\nreconstruct their lives (Campbell, Woods, Chouaf, & Parker,\n2000). In spite of having to assume the challenge of taking\non greater responsibilities in terms of work and household\nmanagement, these women are determined to seek out new\nhorizons for themselves and their children.\nListening as they describe themselves as within this pro-\ncess of identity change (Burke, 1980; Marks & MacDermid,\n1996), we hear them use an array of adjectives in reference to\nthemselves: persevering, organized, responsible, depressed,\namong others.\nI am very complex, and my personality has many facets, from\nvery shy to extroverted. I'm an amalgam of thoughts and feelings.\nI'm not simple and I love not being simple. (Ariadna, 47)\nI feel brave and I feel cowardly. I can be a crybaby. I don't dare\ndo certain things, but the things that happen to me push me\nI'm resilient, and I've learned to get through very difficult\nsituations. I'm positive and I'm slow to react, but when I lose\nmy temper, watch out! (Juana, 61)\nI am too hard working. I get up early, cook lunch, pack the kids'\nlunch boxes, clean the house and then leave. I've always been\nlike this. (Gabriela, 53)\nI'm stubborn and tenacious and don't give up easily. I always\nfight for my objectives. I want to have my own home and my\npractice. (Lucila, 47)\nThe redefinition of participants' identities following the\nseparations, show women who faced with adversity, have the\nability to recover, acquire new skills (Flach, 1997), and cope\nwith their new realities, seeking a sense of personal and col-\nlective well-being. This sense of resilience was observed\nover the course of our conversations with these women. They\nadmit to feeling tired, but they agree that despite the added\nresponsibilities, they feel \"relieved and renewed.\"\nIn terms of social life, the time taken up by child care and\naccess to new work opportunities resulted, in the cases of six\nparticipants, in women feeling as though their social lives\nhad been put on hold. They do note, however, that as their\nchildren have grown up, they have had more freedom to\nrevisit their social circles. One interesting point raised during\nthe interviews was that of entering into a new romantic rela-\ntionship. The replies, in general, show that all hope this hap-\npens, although not necessarily right away or in terms of\nrepresenting a long-term relationship.\nThe phrase \"putting your life back together\" is one I don't like,\nbecause my life is an integral, not a broken one. I'd like to find\nsomeone, but it's not the time yet. (Ariadna, 47)\nYes, I'd like to be with another person, but I see it as complicated.\nIt's a question of putting my mind to it. I've gone out with other\npeople, and the truth is that they seemed worse than my ex. They\nwere egocentric guys, only into themselves. Right now I'm\ndating a guy who doesn't take anything seriously. (China, 34)\nYes, I'd like to meet someone new, but I don't want to make\nanother mistake. Time will tell. (Francisca, 46)\nAlvarado and Vilchez 7\nThe search and wish for a new relationship was another\nconstant in the women's conversations, who described the\nburden placed on them by a society that associates marital\nbreakup with failure. They talked about both men's and\nwomen's stereotypes concerning \"single women.\"\nMarried women are very jealous of divorc\u00e9es, they think if we\napproach their husbands, it's because we have ulterior motives.\nFirst of all, society looks at you as though you've failed at\nsomething. Men see you as alone and there's nobody to have sex\nwith you. I don't see it as a triumph to be married, but a failure\nto divorce. I didn't feel they thought of me this way at work,\nbecause they have only seen me alone there. (Ariadna, 47)\nYou know what happens when a man finds out you're a single\nwoman? They start hanging around you as if expecting\nsomething. They think you're there for the taking. Sometimes\nthey're really disrespectful! (China, 34)\nSince my separation I haven't gotten invited to any of their\nparties, my kids either. They think that because you're separated\nand you're smiling, they can treat you whatever way they want.\nIn her study on the problems that face divorced women in\nthe professional sphere, Fausto-Sterling (1992) points out a\nconstant struggle for them to reconstruct themselves in a soci-\nety where people treat them in a way that departs from what is\nsocially established. By \"ignoring looks and comments\"\n(China, 34; Chio, 39), these women are reacting against the\nandrocentric message of what is truly valid and permitted for a\nwoman: taking her place within the traditional family unit.\nThe participants are optimistic about their futures, which\nideally include a stable financial situation and the well-being\nof daughters and sons, whom the women hope to see grow up\nand live independent lives.\nIn the next 5 years I see myself going back to study and with my\nown apartment. (Eli, 26)\nI see myself as happy, with my daughter, financially well off. I\nlike thinking about the way I'll be from here to 5 years from\nnow, happy, peaceful, enjoying my achievements. (China, 34)\nIn 5 years, I see myself as involved with someone, but not living\nunder the same roof. I don't want to be wealthy; I want peace\nand time for myself. (Chio, 39)\nIn 5 years I see myself not working for somebody else. I don't\nwant to depend on a schedule, I want a more low key existence.\nI want my daughter to finish her degree, so that she won't be\nstuck in some job that runs her ragged. (Lucila, 47)\nBased on the experiences of their divorces, separations,\nteenage pregnancy (in the case of Eli, 26), domestic violence,\nand irresponsible partners, one of the participants' greatest\nfears is that these patterns continue in the lives of their sons\nand daughters. In their study dealing with the impact of\ndivorce on children, Cui, Fincham, and Durtschi (2010)\nshow that although there exists a high likelihood of divorce\nin the lives of the children of divorced parents, it is not a total\ngiven and their ultimate decision to dissolve their marriage\nwould depend on numerous factors. The mothers, in this\nstudy, are more determined to invest time and dedication to\ntheir own sons and daughters.\nI'm afraid. My fear is that the same thing will happen to my\ndaughter. I have to help her so that my own story is not repeated.\nThe subjects of this study--mother that are separated,\ndivorced, professional, residents of urban centers of the capi-\ntal city--ended their conjugal relationships and became sin-\ngle heads of household with the determination that their\ndecision represented the wisest path for their own lives, and\nthat of their children.\nConclusions and Implications for\nPractice\nThe interviews reveal that the participants' decisions to\nbecome single parents have carried with them a heavy men-\ntal and physical toll. The women, nevertheless, feel that their\nstatus as professionals provides substantial leverage and\nsolidity in terms of their economic independence, despite the\nlonger workdays. To this is added the determination to termi-\nnate situations of domestic conflict for the well-being of their\nchildren. The women also reference a vision of a traditional\nfamily unit where the ideal continues to be \"Mom, Dad, and\nthe kids.\" This notion, for many of those interviewed, caused\nthem to prolong conjugal ties despite their partner's infidel-\nity, violence, and--in some cases--financial dependence.\nThe decision to become responsible heads of household,\nnot only sole caregivers but also providers, brought with it a\nseries of difficult challenges described by the subjects of this\nstudy. The participants--products of patriarchal families\nwhere their voices and identities were constantly suppressed\nsince childhood, in great part--continued this pattern after\nbeginning their own relationship and forming families. In\nspite of this, when faced with their partner's irresponsibility\nand domestic abuse, the women made the decision to recon-\nstruct their lives through new identities and the redefinition\nof concepts about what it means to be separated or divorced\nin a powerfully androcentric society.\nThe goal of this study was to explore the experiences of\n15 women, residents of Peru's urban centers, in terms of their\ndecision to become single heads of household within a solid\npatriarchal system. No study, to date, has researched and pre-\nsented this theme through women's direct testimony. We feel\nthat this investigation will represent a valuable contribution\n8 SAGE Open\nfor future studies. It is also important to explore the conse-\nquences of single motherhood on women's physical and\nmental health. The subject of depression and illness prior to,\nand following, conjugal separations should be analyzed\nthrough a phenomenological focus, in which experiences and\ndirect testimony play a vital role.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAfifi, T., Davis, S., Denes, A., & Merrill, A.
