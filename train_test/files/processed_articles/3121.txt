A total of 258 twin pairs had information re-\ngarding H pylori status and history of peptic ulcer. Heli-\ncobacter pylori status was assessed as the presence of\nanti\u00adH pylori IgG.\nResults: The intraclass correlations for peptic ulcer dis-\nease for MZ twins reared apart and together and DZ twins\nrespectively, which indicates that genetic effects are im-\nportant for liability to peptic ulcer. The correlation co-\nefficient for MZ twins reared apart (0.67) provides the\nbest single estimate of the relative importance of genetic\neffects (heritability) for variation in liability to peptic ul-\ncer disease, and structural model fitting analyses con-\nfirmed this result (heritability, 62%). The cross-twin cross-\ntrait correlations for MZ and DZ twins were examined\nto determine whether genetic effects for peptic ulcer were\nshared with or independent of genetic influences for H\npylori. The cross-correlations for MZ and DZ twins were\ning that familial environmental rather than genetic in-\nfluences mediate the association between peptic ulcer dis-\nease and H pylori infection.\nConclusions: Genetic influences are of moderate im-\nportance for liability to peptic ulcer disease. Genetic in-\nfluences for peptic ulcer are independent of genetic in-\nfluences important for acquiring H pylori infection.\nDURING THE past 50 years,\nthe ability of investiga-\ntors to identify risk fac-\ntors associated with pep-\ntic ulcer has been ham-\npered by the heterogeneous nature of the\ndisease. The prevalence and incidence of\npeptic ulcer varies worldwide in relation\nto geographic, racial, and social circum-\nstances.1-4 There has also been some evi-\ndence that genetic factors play an impor-\ntant role in the etiology of peptic ulcer\ndisease.5-7 However, the pattern of inher-\nitance is not simple mendelian and the ge-\nnetic basis is multifactorial. Risk factors\nfor peptic ulcer include cigarette smok-\ning and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrug use.1,8 Additional potential risk fac-\ntors for peptic ulcer have been docu-\nmented, including age, sex, alcohol and\ncaffeine consumption, stress, and diet.1,8-12\nHowever, the results concerning environ-\nmental risk factors for peptic ulcer are not\nconclusive.\nDuring the past decade, an associa-\ntion between peptic ulcer disease and Heli-\ncobacter pylori infection was recog-\nnized.13-15 Because of the significant role\nof H pylori infection in peptic ulcer dis-\nease, there has been substantial interest in\nstudying genetic and environmental in-\nfluences (eg, socioeconomic status and\ncrowding) on acquiring the infection. It\nhas been reported previously16 that ge-\nnetic factors are important for acquiring\nH pylori infection. These influences may\nbe a source of genetic influences for de-\nveloping peptic ulcer disease.

We studied a sample of mono-\nzygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, reared together\n(MZT, DZT) or reared apart (MZA, DZA), who were par-\nticipants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging\n(SATSA).17 This sample allowed us to answer 2 major\nresearch questions: (1) What is the relative importance\nof genetic factors for liability to peptic ulcer disease?\nSAMPLE\nThe sample for this investigation was composed of twins\nfrom a subregistry of the Swedish Twin Registry, which in-\ncludes entries for about 25 000 like-sexed twin pairs born\nas SATSA, consists of a number of twins who indicated that\nthey had been separated before the age of 11 years and reared\napart and a sample of twins reared together, matched on\nthe basis of sex, age, and county of birth. When SATSA was\ninitiated in 1984 with a mail-out questionnaire, both mem-\nbers of 758 pairs responded to this questionnaire, of whom\n691 pairs had completed the questionnaire regarding his-\ntory of peptic ulcer. Two years later, a subset of reared-\ntogether and reared-apart pairs older than 50 years in which\nboth members responded to the questionnaire were in-\nvited to participate in an examination that included a health\nevaluation. The average age at the time of testing was 65.6\nyears (SD, 8.4 years).\nThe genetic analyses of peptic ulcer disease were based\non 758 pairs for whom questionnaire responses were avail-\nable on peptic ulcer history. Of these pairs, 270 had serum\nsamples available for evaluating H pylori status. Zygosity\nwas first determined on the basis of physical similarities\nand confirmed on the basis of serological assay. One pair\nwas excluded from the analyses because adequate cer-\ntainty of zygosity (98%) could not be obtained. The dis-\ntribution of age at separation is highly skewed: 52% of the\ntwins reared apart were separated before their first birth-\nday, 69% by their second birthday, 82% by the age of 5 years,\nand all by the age of 11 years.17 Reasons for separation var-\nied; the majority were separated because of the death of 1\nor both parents and/or economic hardship. Further de-\ntails of the procedures, sample, and design of SATSA are\ndescribed by Pedersen et al.17\nThe presence of anti\u00adH pylori IgG was assessed by means\nof a commercially available H pylori immunoassay test kit\n(HM-CAP; Enteric Products Inc, Stony Brook, NY). The test\nwas scored positive when the optical density was greater\nthan 2.0. The test has a sensitivity of more than 98% and a\nspecificity of more than 95%.18 Helicobacter pylori in-\nfection is chronic and even lifelong. After successful anti-\nmicrobial therapy, the antibody titer becomes undetect-\nable; however, the presence of serum antibody is a reliable\nindication of H pylori status.\nANALYSES\nThe primary aim of the analyses is to describe individual\ndifferences in liability to peptic ulcer by portioning these\ndifferences (total variance) into genetic and environmen-\ntal variance components. Quantitative genetic theory pos-\nits that total phenotypic variance is the sum of genetic vari-\nance, environmental variance, and twice the covariation of\ngenetic and environmental effects. Genetic variance can be\nfurther partitioned into additive genetic variance, reflect-\ning the effects of many segregating genes of equal effect,\nand nonadditive genetic variance caused by interactions\nwithin and among genetic loci. Environmental variance can\nbe partitioned into environmental effects shared by family\nmembers (causing familial similarity) and nonshared en-\nvironmental effects (causing differences among family mem-\nbers). An assumption of the present analyses, that there is\nno genotype-environment covariance, has been sup-\nported for most behavioral and biomedical phenotypes.19\nHeritability is defined as the proportion of total variance\nattributable to genetic variance. In these models, all vari-\nance that is not genetic is considered environmental. Thus,\nthe heritability statistic provides an estimate of the re-\nlative importance of genetic differences for individual\ndifferences in susceptibility to peptic ulcer in the popula-\ntion (relative to environmental effects). This statistic re-\nfers to the population and does not describe risk to an\nindividual.\nIntraclass correlations were calculated to measure the simi-\nlarities within the twin pairs before the phenotypic vari-\nance was decomposed into genetic and environmental com-\nponents. The intraclass correlations and their interpretation\nare as follows: (1) magnitude of MZA correlation: impor-\ntance of genetic effects; (2) MZ correlations greater than\nDZ correlations: importance of genetic effects; (3) twins\nreared together more similar than twins reared apart: im-\nportance of shared rearing environments; (4) no or little\ndifference of MZ and DZ correlations: importance of fa-\nmilial environmental effects; and (5) differences within MZ\npairs (1 - MZ correlation): nonshared environmental in-\nfluences. The intraclass correlation of MZA twins pro-\nvides a direct and unbiased estimate of heritability. Be-\ncause the phenotype, presence of peptic ulcer disease, is\ncategorical (0 or 1), tetrachoric intraclass correlations were\ncalculated by the PRELIS2 program (Scientific Software Inc,\nChicago, Ill) for each of the 4 rearing-by-zygosity groups.\nExamination of intraclass correlations provides valu-\nable insights regarding the relative importance of genetic\nand environmental factors. However, it is difficult to esti-\nmate the importance of several variables, eg, heritability,\nnonshared environment, shared rearing environment, and\nother forms of correlated environment, by separate com-\nparisons of pairs of correlations. Hence, structural models\nbased on quantitative genetic expectations of factors con-\ntributing to twin similarities and differences were fit to the\ndata.

Correlations for MZ and DZ\ntwins are also pooled over rearing groups to maintain rea-\nsonable sample sizes. This pattern of correlations indi-\ncates that genetic effects are of modest importance for\nliability to peptic ulcer disease. Consistent with the in-\ntraclass correlations, the MZ probandwise concordance\nrate (39%), pooled over rearing status, was significantly\ngreater than that for dizygotic pairs (15%) (P.001)\n(Table 1). Furthermore, because twins reared together\nwere not more similar than twins reared apart, there is\nno indication of shared rearing environments as a source\nof familial similarity for peptic ulcer. There were no sig-\nnificant sex differences in the intraclass correlations\n(Table 2), even though the prevalence rate was higher\namong men than women (7.5% and 5.3%, respectively).\nThe correlation coefficient for MZA twins (0.67) pro-\nvides the best single estimate of the relative importance\nof genetic effects (heritability) for liability to peptic ul-\ncer disease. By definition, the remaining variance (ap-\nproximately 35%) is nongenetic and indicates the role\nof environmental factors for developing peptic ulcer dis-\nease. Structural model fitting analyses confirmed this find-\ning. Heritability was estimated at 62%, and the remain-\ning variance (38%) represented individual-specific,\nnonshared environmental variance (2\nAkaike Information Criterion, -9.37).\nThe association between H pylori and peptic ulcer\nwas established in a case-control analysis and by tetra-\nchoric correlation. A total of 299 unrelated individuals\nrandomly selected from each twin pair had values for H\npylori and peptic ulcer. The relative risk of those with H\npylori and peptic ulcer was almost 2-fold that of those\nwho did not have H pylori infection (relative risk, 1.9;\nThe tetrachoric correlation between H pylori and peptic\nThe second question addressed by the analyses was\nthe extent to which there is genetic variance for peptic\nulcer independent of genetic effects on H pylori infec-\ntion. Possible genetic mediation of the association was\nevaluated by examining cross-twin cross-trait correla-\ntions, ie, ulcer in twin 1 with H pylori in twin 2. These\ncross-correlations can be interpreted in a fashion analo-\ngous to the intraclass correlations.19 If MZ cross-\ncorrelations are greater than DZ cross-correlations, the\nimportance of genetic influences for the association be-\ntween 2 traits is indicated. The correlations reported in\nTable 3 indicate that there is no genetic variation in com-\nmon between the 2 measures (peptic ulcer and H py-\nlori), because average MZ cross-twin correlations, 0.25,\nare not greater than average DZ cross-correlations, 0.29.\nThis pattern of correlations suggests that the associa-\ntion between H pylori infection and peptic ulcer can be\nascribed to familial environmental influences in com-\nmon to both measures. Structural model fitting con-\nfirmed this finding (results not shown).\nTable 1.

Although it is impossible to\nseparate entirely environmental factors from genetic in-\nfluences, early twin and family studies suggested a ge-\nnetic component for these diseases.5-7 The present re-\nsults showed that genetic effects are of moderate\nimportance for liability to peptic ulcer in our popula-\ntion (heritability, 0.62), and the remaining variation can\nbe explained by individual-specific environments. De-\nspite the greater prevalence of peptic ulcer in men than\nwomen, there are no sex differences in twin similarity\nfor peptic ulcer.\nPreviously, we established the importance of ge-\nnetic factors for susceptibility to H pylori infection.16 The\nheritability of liability to H pylori infection was 0.63. Heri-\ntability is the proportion of total variance for liability to\ndisease caused by genetic variance that describes the ex-\ntent to which differences in liability to disease in the popu-\nlation are caused by genetic differences. To the best of\nour knowledge, no published study has evaluated whether\ngenetic effects for developing peptic ulcer are indepen-\ndent of or shared with genetic effects important for ac-\nquiring H pylori infection. Comparisons of MZ and DZ\ncross-twin, cross-trait correlations and structural model\nfitting in the present study demonstrated that, despite the\nsimilarity in heritabilities for the 2 traits, the genetic in-\nfluences for liability to peptic ulcer disease are indepen-\ndent of such genetic effects for acquiring H pylori infec-\ntion. The relationship between H pylori and diseases such\nas peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer ap-\npears to be mediated by familial environmental factors,\nie, environmental experiences or situations that are shared\nby family members. Examples of familial environmen-\ntal factors that may mediate the association between H\npylori and peptic ulcer disease are diet, smoking, and al-\ncohol and coffee consumption.\nInitially, the strongest evidence of a genetic influ-\nence on peptic ulcer came from studies showing an in-\ncreased risk of duodenal ulcer in individuals with hy-\nperpepsinogenemia.21,22 Those results have been\nquestioned as it has become evident that elevated serum\npepsinogen I level is also a feature of H pylori infec-\ntion.22-25 The present results indicate that the associa-\ntion between peptic ulcer and H pylori reflects environ-\nmental rather than genetic mediation. Thus, envir-\nonmental influences leading to H pylori infection and el-\nevated serum levels of pepsinogen may result in peptic\nulcer in susceptible individuals.\nThe occurrence of peptic ulcer disease has de-\nclined remarkably in the United States and Europe dur-\ning the past 3 decades.26-28 Peptic ulcer was most preva-\nlent among those born around the turn of the century\nand has decreased in all subsequent generations.29,30 The\nrapid change in the pattern of peptic ulcer in successive\ngenerations (ie, birth cohorts) more likely results from\nchanges in environmental factors than changes in the\ngenes of the affected patients. Multiple risk factors iden-\ntified for peptic ulcer include family history, age, sex, race,\nsocial class, blood group, smoking, alcohol and coffee con-\nsumption, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nstress, season of the year, and H pylori infection.8-13 None\nof these factors can be considered universal of essential\ncharacteristics of duodenal ulcer disease with the excep-\ntion of H pylori\u00adinduced gastritis. Risk factors that are\nnot shared by family members, such as use of nonsteroi-\ndal anti-inflammatory drugs, may represent examples of\nthe individual-specific source of variance in liability to\nulcer found in the present results.\nInspiteofthecomprehensivedesignofourstudy,there\nmay be some potential methodological problems. Al-\nthough the results are interesting and informative, our data\nare based on self-reports, which could be subject to recall\nbias, resulting in overreporting or underreporting of the\ndisease. However, the total prevalence rates of peptic ul-\ncer disease among the Swedish population are 7.5% in men\nand 5.3% in women, which are comparable with those of\nother Scandinavian countries. On the basis of endoscopic\nfindings, one Norwegian study reported an overall preva-\nquency estimates for lifetime prevalence of verified ulcers\nwere found in an unselected Danish population initially\nidentified with self-reported ulcer (7.7% among men and\n3.6%amongwomen32).Anotherlargecross-sectionalques-\ntionnaire-based survey conducted in northern Norway re-\nported a 5.3% prevalence of peptic ulcer in men and 2.1%\ninwomen.33 Thus,theprevalenceofulcerfoundinthisstudy\nis comparable with that reported in the region.
