The most important component of physical attractiveness in humans is\nfacial appearance (Currie and Little, 2009; Peters et al., 2007). Research conducted in\nindustrial societies (mainly on people of European origin) showed that many features of the\nface, including geometric typicality, sex-typical characteristics, symmetry, skin condition,\nand fat amount, are cue to the individual's biological quality and influence its attractiveness\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nempirical research suggests that the relationship of facial characteristics with biological\nquality is not limited to a group of human populations and not even to humans (Andersson,\nthese grounds, one may suspect that attractiveness criteria and evaluations of facial appeal\nwould be universal across cultures (see Langlois et al., 2000).\nOn the other hand, several mechanisms can produce systematic inter-population\ndifferences in perception of facial attractiveness. First, if two human groups differ in facial\nproportions to some degree they will materialize the preference for typical facial\nproportions in a different way from each other (Symons, 1979; Jones, 1996). Second,\npreferences for some facial features may be adaptively related to ecological conditions,\ne.g., female preference for masculine male faces is stronger in populations of poor health\nand high threat of pathogens (DeBruine et al., 2010, 2012). Third, preferences of random\norigin can spread over a local population through social learning (Little et al., 2011b).\nMany studies reported high inter-racial and inter-cultural agreement in perception of\nfacial attractiveness (Langlois et al., 2000). However, most of the studies were conducted\namong populations highly exposed to Western culture. Such groups could have assimilated\nthe European standards of facial attractiveness through social learning (Little et al., 2011b)\nor thanks to visual experience with faces of White people (Little et al., 2011a). Indeed, the\nlevel of agreement with the standards in Black people (Martin, 1964), Koreans (Lim and\nGiddon, 1991) and Mexicans (Mejia-Maidl et al., 2005) depends on the degree of exposure\nto the Western culture. Black people (Martin, 1964), Asians (Maganzini et al., 2000; Choe\nraces that possess proportions typical for White individuals. Brazilians from cities inhabited\nmainly by dark-skinned people prefer facial proportions characteristic for Europeans rather\nthan natives (Jones and Hill, 1993). Non-White women endeavor to make appearance of\ntheir faces similar to faces of White women (Dobke et al., 2006; Sturm-O'Brien et al.,\n2010). And in the opposite direction, the longer a White man stays in a non-Western\nsociety, the stronger is attracted to physical features being typical for local people (Symons,\nIn light of above, studying facial preferences in populations isolated from Western\nculture is highly desired, though data are scarce. Jones and Hill (1993) found that\nassessments of facial attractiveness made by Ach\u00e9 (Paraguay) and Hiwi (Venezuela)\nIndians are poorly associated with those by Americans, Russians, and Brazilians (average r\n= .13). Zebrowitz et al. (2012) observed a moderate agreement between Tsiman\u00e9 Indians\n(Bolivia) and Americans (average r = .40). Somewhat higher agreement was found in\nstudies on less isolated populations: the correlation between assessments by Black people\nin Lagos (Nigeria) and Black and White individuals in USA averaged .54 (Martin, 1964),\nand correlation between assessments by peasants from south-western Senegal and\nStudies that concentrated on specific facial features showed that men from rural\nBorneo preferred feminine female faces (Scott et al., 2008), and Hadza, Tanzanian hunter-\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\ngatherers, preferred faces which were symmetric (Little et al., 2007) and possessed\nproportions typical for this population (Apicella et al., 2007). Additionally, women's\npreference for male-typical facial characteristics was affected by relationship context in\nMalaysians from Borneo (Scott et al., 2008) and in Matsigenka people from Peru (Yu et al.,\n2007). However, these studies do not examine the extent of inter-population agreement in\nperception of facial attractiveness.\nMore anecdotal evidence suggest that facial preferences may be universal to some\ndegree: e.g., Ford and Beach reviewed ethnographic data and concluded that \"a poor\ncomplexion is one feature that is considered sexually repulsive in a large number of\nsocieties\" (Ford and Beach, 1951, p. 89), and Darwin cited opinions of some travelers that\npeople worldwide agree with White people on who is attractive and who is not (Darwin,\n1874, p. 582). But, the need for further, systematic research on this topic is clear-cut.\nSurprisingly, existing literature has examined only cross-cultural differences in\nassessments of attractiveness. Meanwhile, the topic of unattractiveness has been neglected.\nTo our knowledge, only Boski (2009) suggested that inter-population similarity in\nperception of unattractiveness or ugliness might be higher than similarity in perception of\nattractiveness or beauty in human faces. He did not conduct systematic research on that\ntopic, but he observed that his Polish, Canadian and Nigerian students agreed more on\nunattractiveness of faces (Nigerian generals and politicians) than on their attractiveness.\nAt least two mechanisms can potentially explain higher agreement in the case of\nunattractiveness: one related to a preference for faces of a typical appearance and one\nrelated to a greater importance of low than high attractiveness.\nFirst, people seem to prefer faces of appearance typical for their population. On the\nbasis of previously seen faces they develop a mental prototype of a face which normally\nreflects a typical, or average, face (Tsao and Livingstone, 2008) and this prototype is then\nused to assess normality and attractiveness of subsequently seen faces. The preference for\ngeometrically average faces is well documented (Kociski, 2007; Little, 2011a; Rhodes,\n2006) and in multiracial societies a face's attractiveness is evaluated with regard to its\nproximity to the average face of its own race (Potter et al., 2007; Potter and Corneille,\n2008). Because different facial forms are typical for different human groups, the neural\nprototype will vary among the group as well. Therefore, leaving other attractiveness\ndeterminants aside, a face of a person from population A, which is similar to the average\nface for this population, would be regarded attractive by members of the population but\nrelatively unattractive by members of population B, if the latter is characterized by other\nfacial proportions than population A. However, a face of a person from population A, which\nstrongly departs from the average face for this population would probably substantially\ndiffer from the average face for population B as well. Then, again leaving other\nattractiveness determinants aside, an unattractive face for population A would usually be\nalso unattractive for population B. A face from population A could be attractive for people\nfrom population B only in a rare case when it resembles faces typical for population B (i.e.,\nit departs, in its shape, from the average face for population A just towards the average face\nfor population B); in this case, however, the face will not be attractive for members of\npopulation A. These considerations lead to the prediction that people from populations that\ndiffer from each other in facial geometry should agree more on which faces are unattractive\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nthan which are attractive.\nThe second mechanism is related to greater importance of low than high\nattractiveness. Facial attractiveness is associated with health and intelligence only within\nthe lower range of its variation (Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004) and therefore a better mating\ntactic is to avoid only lowly attractive candidates (not those moderately attractive) than to\naccept only highly attractive ones (Zebrowitz et al., 2003; Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004;\nZebrowitz, 2004). Negative stimuli, in general, impact on humans more strongly than\npositive (Baumeister et al., 2001) and physical attractiveness fall under this rule: low\nattractiveness elicits stronger arousal in observers (Mehrabian and Blum, 1997) and raises\nstronger attributions on scales of altruism and intelligence (Griffin and Langlois, 2006)\nthan high attractiveness. Analyses of evaluations of facial attractiveness suggest that\nobservers rather avoid lowly attractive mates than pursue those of high attractiveness (Park\net al., 2012) and attach more weight to the least attractive rather than most attractive feature\nof the face being assessed (Grammer et al., 2002). Whether attractiveness of a partner is\nlow or moderate is more important for people than whether it is high or moderate (Li et al.,\nsuccess is decreased by an individual's low attractiveness to a greater degree than they are\nincreased by high attractiveness, at least in men. Abovementioned findings suggest that\nreliable cues to biological quality and mate value, such as skin condition, symmetry, and\ndeformation, are more important for perception of low than high attractiveness.\nRecognition of faces as highly attractive may, in turn, depend to a greater degree on use of\ncriteria specific for the population (e.g., ecological conditions, DeBruine et al., 2010) or the\nindividual (e.g., own and parental appearance, Watkins et al., 2011). We then predict that\ninter-population similarity is higher in identifying lowly than highly attractive faces. It can\nbe also predicted that intra-population agreement of judges is higher for the former task as\nwell, but in this case the effect can arise only from factors specific for individuals, not for\npopulations.\nIn the present study, women and men from Poland and a Papuan tribe were asked to\nchoose the most attractive and unattractive face from a group of opposite-sex European\nfaces. The study aimed to test the following predictions: (1) There is some similarity\nbetween Poles and Papuans in perception of facial attractiveness. (2) The similarity is\nhigher for choosing the least than the most attractive face. (3) Intra-population agreement is\nhigher for choosing the least than the most attractive face. (4) Intra-population agreement is\nhigher among Polish than Papuan participants because of greater visual experience with\nfaces of White individuals in the former group.\nMaterials and Methods\nStimuli\nIn the first phase of the study, we took 50 female and 50 male facial pictures of\nrandomly selected people aged 19-24 from the university campuses (dormitories) in\nWroclaw (Poland). Only 2 approached people did not agree for their picture being taken.\nParticipants were familiarized with the aim of the research and they gave their informed,\nwritten consent for using their pictures in the subsequent part of the research. All the\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\npictures had plain, gray background. Participants were asked to maintain neutral facial\nexpression. In the pictures, the participants' hair was not altered, first, to maintain a natural\nappearance, and second, because hair is also an important element of facial attractiveness\n(Mesk\u00f3 and Bereczkei, 2004). In any case, hair color and style was lowly diversified\namong faces of a given sex, particularly in men. The presented faces did not have any\ndeformations or signs of serious diseases.\nscale (from 1 \u00ad very unattractive to 7 \u00ad very attractive). For the purpose of further study,\nwe ranked the faces according to the average obtained attractiveness (female and male\nfaces separately) and selected 4 faces of each sex: the most attractive face (further, A face),\nthe least attractive face (further, D face), and two moderately attractive faces (rank 25 and\n26, further, B and C faces). Mean ratings and their standard deviations for the selected faces\nParticipants\nThe research was conducted among the Yali tribe (Papua, Indonesian province\npreviously known as Irian Jaya). The Yali inhabit mountainous areas east of the Baliem\nvalley (3.92 S, 138.73 E from Wamena \u00ad central part of Baliem valley). The Yali are one of\nmany indigenous ethnic groups in Papua. Even though Christianity is present in this region,\nthe Yali have preserved their traditional lifestyle. They are polygamic (21% of males who\nparticipated in our study had more than one wife), men live together in a separate\nhousehold and wear traditional clothing (some wear only a koteka, which is a traditional\nwooden penis sheath). The Yali cultivate plots, hunt as well as breed pigs (which constitute\na marker of a man's wealth and social position).\nYali tribe can be described as a population with a minor contact with Western\nculture; due to the remote location of their dwellings and difficult access very few tourists\nhave visited their region (the only access routes to the Yali territory are via private or\nchartered aircraft or a several days long trek through the mountains). All the study sites\nwere located along a mountainous route (from South-East to North\u00adWest) surrounding the\nBaliem Valley from the East. As was indicated by the participants themselves, the villages\nwere visited by trekking groups from 10-15 trek groups yearly in Pilliam to approximately\n1-3 times during the last five years in small mountain villages (according to the estimates\nof the participants, on average they saw 9 tourist groups, SD = 4.8 during the period of 5\nyears before the day of the study).\nAll the inhabitants of the visited villages (except for children and the elderly) were\ninvited to take part in the study. The number of positive responses to the invitation was\napproximately 40\u00ad50%. In the end, 103 participants were recruited to participate in the\nstudy \u00ad 53 females and 50 males. The female participants were aged between 25 and 59\n7.6). The age was self-estimated \u00ad majority of the participants did not know their exact age\nand relied on rough estimates. The participants were interviewed by a Papuan assistant\n(from the Dani tribe) fluent in English and the local Yali dialect. All participants were\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nreimbursed for their participation by receiving the equivalent of 3USD.\nThe same research was conducted in Poland among 50 men and 49 women. The\nand were a diverse group recruited on bus and train terminals in Wroclaw (Poland). The\nstudy was conducted by one of the authors (P.S.). Poland is a country in Central Europe\nwith a GDP of about 20,000 US$ per capita and is part of the European Union. It is\nrepresentative of a modern industrialized society.\nProcedure\nPrior to the main experiment, each Yali participant was interviewed in order to\nmake sure that the experimental question and certain concepts were clear and easily\nunderstood. Each interview lasted relatively long, as participants were asked a series of\nquestions related to their concept of attractiveness (e.g., Sorokowski and Sorokowska,\n2012); that is why we are fairly sure that each participant understood the task correctly.\nEach participant was presented with 4 randomly arranged laminated images of\nopposite-sex faces, each sized 9x15 cm, and asked to choose the most attractive and,\nseparately, the unattractive face in their opinion. The participants were surveyed\nindividually. The procedure was easy and transparent to all participants \u00ad e.g., none of them\nindicated the same face as the most attractive and the most unattractive one. We repeated\nthe same procedure, with the same set of stimuli in the Polish group.\nAnalysis of choices\nTo verify the formulated hypotheses, we required a measure of agreement among\njudges from a given group and a measure of similarity between two groups of judges.\nBecause the variables of interest, i.e. the face that was chosen as the most attractive or\nunattractive, were categorical, popular measures of variation and association, like variance\nor coefficient of correlation, were not applicable here.\nTo assess the agreement level among judges from a group we used the Index of\nQualitative Variation (IQV), which equals 1 minus the sum of squared percentages across\ncategories, \nnegatively related to the judges' agreement, we introduced an Intra-group Agreement Index\n(IAI) equaling 1 \u00ad IQV, or simply  2\ni\np .\nTo assess similarity level between two groups of judges we applied the Morisita\nSimilarity Index (MSI). It is calculated as\n( )\n[ ]\n,\n,\n,\n,\n/\n/\nN\nN\nn\nN\nn\nn\nn i\ni\ni\ni\n\n\n\n+\n\n \n ,\nwhere \n= i\nj\ni\nn\nN ,\n, and nj,i\nBecause exact distributions of the applied indices are not known, we involved\nbootstrapping approach to establish the indices' distributions and then determining the\nstatistical significance (p-values) for hypotheses being tested.

Although it is one\nof the most complex indices of this sort, it is recommended in literature for its statistical\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nTo check whether agreement level among Polish judges was the same as for Papuan\n(for faces of given sex and the judged characteristic), resampling was conducted at each\nrepeat from the Polish and Papuan sample defined by numbers of choices of each face\n(from A to D). The value of IAI was determined for each of the two resamples and the\ndifference between the IAI values, IAI, was further analyzed. According to the null\nhypothesis, i.e., assuming the same agreement in each population, the expected value of\nIAI is 0. To determine p-value for this hypothesis, the number of cases where IAI\ncrossed 0 was divided by repeat count (10.000) and the resultant percentage multiplied by 2\nso to obtain a two-tailed p-value. The analysis was conducted four times, separately for\nchoices of the most attractive female or male face and choices of unattractive female or\nmale face.\nEquality of agreement levels between choices of the most attractive and unattractive\nface (for given facial sex and judges origin) was examined in a similar way. In this case,\nhowever, the compared variables were dependent (e.g. a judge could not choose the same\nface as the most attractive and unattractive). Hence, resampling was conducted on the\ncontingency table for these variables (the most attractive \u00d7 the unattractive face) rather than\nunivariate distributions. The analysis was carried out four times, separately for choices of\nfemale face by Poles or Papuans and choices of male face by Poles or Papuans.\nA hypothesis that no difference exists between choices made by Poles and Papuans\n(i.e. that they wholly agree with each other) was checked with the chi-squared test of\nindependence, separately for each facial sex and judged characteristic. In case of rejecting\nof the hypothesis, we checked whether a statistically significant similarity between Poles\nand Papuans exists at all. To this end, we first determined the value of MSI characteristic\nfor no agreement between groups (MSI0\n). Specifically, we established the MSI value for the\nactual distribution of choices made by Poles and a hypothetical, discrete uniform\ndistribution of choices by Papuans, which depicts random choices. Next, we run a bootstrap\nanalysis for actual choices by Poles and Papuans, separately for each facial sex and judged\ncharacteristic. The MSI value was calculated at each repeat, the number of cases where MSI\nexceeded MSI0\nwas divided by repeat count (10.000), and the resultant percentage\nmultiplied by 2 so to obtain a two-tailed p-value. In addition, we calculated percentage\ninter-population similarities, %MSI, taking MSI0\nThen, we checked whether the similarity level between Poles and Papuans was the\nsame for choices of the most attractive and unattractive face, separately for female and\nmale faces. The bootstrapping method was used again. Because choices of the most\nattractive and unattractive face were dependent, resampling was conducted on contingency\ntables for these variables, one table per judges' population. At each repeat the MSI value\nfor choices of the most attractive and unattractive face was calculated and the difference\nbetween both values, MSI, was then analyzed. According to the null hypothesis, i.e.\nassuming that inter-group similarity did not depend on which characteristic was assessed,\nthe expected value of MSI is 0. To determine p-value for this hypothesis, the number of\ncases where MSI crossed 0 was divided by repeat count (10.000) yielding a one-tailed p-\nvalue. The use of the one-tailed test was warranted here because several lines of reasoning\nsuggest inter-population similarity to be higher for perception of unattractiveness than\nas 0% and the theoretically maximum\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nattractiveness (see Introduction).\nThe above hypothesis was also tested on data for both sexes combined. To this end,\nthe bootstrap analysis was conducted simultaneously on data for female and male faces and\nat each repeat the average MSI value was calculated from values obtained for both sexes,\nseparately for choices of the most attractive and unattractive faces: MSIATTR\nFEMALE\n) / 2, and MSIUNATTR\nThe p-value was established on the basis of difference values, MSIUNATTR\nBecause tests for equality of inter-population similarity in choices of the most\nattractive and unattractive face are crucial for the present study, the respective bootstrap\nanalyses for female faces, male faces, and both sexes combined, was conducted 10 times\neach so to gen up on reliability of the obtained p-values.\n,\nFinally, we used the Fisher's exact test to compare frequencies of choice of a given\nface by Poles versus Papuans, separately in attractiveness and unattractiveness conditions.\nThe 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables were filled with frequencies for the face and for the other\nfaces pooled, as chosen by each group of judges.\nAnalysis of facial shape\nWe also ascertained whether geometrical proximity of the faces to a typical face of\nPoles or Yali influenced their attractiveness according to Polish and Papuan participants,\nrespectively. To this end, we measured 15 distances on digital images of faces in frontal\naspect using author-developed software (in Microsoft Visual Basic 6). Apart from the 8\nfaces used in the present study (the test faces), measurements were conducted on 192\nfemale and 158 male faces of Poles, and on 12 female and 9 male faces of Yali (the\nreference faces; they were taken from the authors' photograph collections). The measured\ndistances included the eye, nose, and mouth widths and heights, forehead height, eyebrow\nthickness, eyebrow-to-eye distance, interpupillary distance, facial width at levels of\ncheekbones and lips, chin height, nose-to-mouth distance, and horizontal distance from lip\ncorners to the face's contour. Points defining the distances were located in agreement with\nanthropometric standards (Farkas, 1994). The measured distances were then corrected for\nthe face's overall size, which was determined as the average distance of the points from\ntheir centroid.\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Statistica StatSoft 8.0. Examination of 4\nfacial groups, female/male \u00d7 Polish/Papuan reference faces, showed that the Mahalanobis\ndistances between sexes were much smaller (on average, 2.81 times) than those between\npopulations. Therefore, further analysis was conducted on faces of both sexes combined. A\ndiscriminant analysis was first run on two groups of reference faces (Polish and Papuan)\nand then the Mahalanobis distances of each of the 8 test faces from the typical Polish face\nand typical Yali face were established. The distances were then correlated with frequencies\nof choices of each face as the most attractive or unattractive by Polish and Papuan\nparticipants (the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied). We hypothesized that a\nface's distance to the typical Polish or Yali face would be negatively related to the\nfrequency of being chosen as the most attractive and positively related to the frequency of\nbeing chosen as unattractive by Polish and Yali participants, respectively. Because of very\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nsmall sample size (8 test faces) and non-independence of frequencies (they sum up to 1 for\neach sex) we did not perform a statistical test for the obtained correlations but only\nexamined whether their direction was as expected.\nResults\nTable 1 provides frequencies for choices of the most attractive and unattractive\nfemale and male face by Poles and Papuans; distributions of the choices are shown on\nFigure 1. The table also gives values for intra-group agreement index (IAI), inter-group\nsimilarity index (MSI), MSI characteristic for no agreement between groups (MSI0\n), and\npercentage similarity (%MSI).\nTable 1.

However, the former\ndifference correlated with the difference between frequencies of being chosen as the\nunattractive by Poles vs Papuans at \u00ad0.19, which was in the predicted direction.\nDiscussion\nAs we discussed in the Introduction, few studies examined facial preferences in\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\npopulations isolated from the Western culture and none compared perception of facial\nunattractiveness across cultures. In the presented study we found that Yali from Papua\nperceived attractiveness in a somewhat similar way as people from central Europe and the\nsimilarity was higher when they chose the least than when they chose the most attractive\nface. Below we discuss the results in detail.\nIntra-group agreement in perception of attractiveness\nJudges from Poland were more consistent than Papuans in the choice of the most\nattractive and unattractive face. This could have resulted from using only European faces,\nmore familiar to Poles than Papuans in the study. Rich visual experience that Poles had in\ntheir lives with faces of White individuals surely enhanced their efficiency in neural\nprocessing of such faces. Visual experience with faces is required for development of their\nefficient processing (Le Grand et al., 2001) and the efficiency is highest for faces of the\nrace that was seen most frequently (Sangrigoli et al., 2005; Pascalis et al., 2011). Poles'\nfacial processing can be superior also because they saw much more faces altogether than\nPapuans (Pascalis et al., 2011; Zebrowitz et al., 2012). Furthermore, Polish participants\nmight learn Western attractiveness standards for European faces from mass media and\nthrough other means of social learning (Little et al., 2011b). Low experience of Yali people\nwith faces of White people and ignorance of the attractiveness canons can explain their low\nconsistence in the present study.\nThe level of intra-group agreement in choice of the most attractive face did not\ndiffer significantly from agreement in choice of the unattractive one, irrespective of sex of\na face and the judges' group. No support was therefore obtained for the prediction that\npeople are more consistent in perception of low than high attractiveness. However, the\nreason for the null result could be that numeric attractiveness of D faces (selected as lowly\nattractive) was relatively close to the attractiveness of B and C faces (selected as\nmoderately attractive), whereas A faces obtained much higher evaluations (see Materials\nand Methods). This could make the choice of the unattractive face relatively difficult, and\nin consequence lower the intra-group consistence in this choice to the level characteristic\nfor choice of the most attractive face. Nevertheless, the observed independence of the\njudges' agreement level from the evaluated characteristic will be important for interpreting\nof inter-population similarities in perception of attractiveness (see below).\nInter-group similarity in perception of attractiveness\nIn the present study we found some similarity in perception of facial attractiveness\nbetween Europeans (Poles) and the Yali people isolated in mountains of Papua. This agrees\nwith results of previous studies conducted in societies that were highly (Jones and Hill,\nWestern culture. The similarity was high for choice of the unattractive female face and\nmoderate for choice of the most attractive female face and the unattractive male face; no\nsimilarity was however observed for choice of the most attractive man. The similarity\nbetween Poles and Papuans was greater for choice of the least than the most attractive face;\nwe were not however able to settle unambiguously whether the effect applied to faces of\nboth sexes or only to females.\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nBecause intra-group agreement in choice of the unattractive face was not higher\nthan for the most attractive face (see above), the reason of the greater inter-group similarity\nin choice of the unattractive than the most attractive face could not be an ease of identifying\nthe face of the worst look. To determine probable reasons of the observed effect, 4 people,\nincluding authors, examined faces involved in the present study for geometric averageness,\nmasculinity/femininity, symmetry, skin condition, fattiness, facial expression and makeup.\nThen, drawing on these observations, the quantitative analysis of the faces' shape and\nscientific knowledge about determinants of facial attractiveness, we endeavored to identify\nfeatures responsible for the judges' choices.\nOne observation proved clear-cut: the faces that were regarded the unattractive (D\nfaces) possessed the worst skin condition from faces of their sex, the skin had blemishes,\nerythema, and, in the man, some swellings. The faces were not characterized by any\nconspicuous asymmetry or disproportion and the female face had the most pleasant\nexpression, and yet, they were categorized as unattractive by judges from both populations.\nAlthough the male face had the nose of above-average size, this cannot be the reason for its\nlow attractiveness for Yali observers since Yali themselves possess huge noses. The\nfacialmetric analysis confirmed that the shape of D faces was not atypical when compared\neither to the average Polish or Yali face (Table 2). It appears, therefore, that cues to poor\nhealth present on skin has a decisive and negative influence on perceived attractiveness,\nirrespective of the observer's place of origin (compare Ford and Beach, 1951, p. 89).\nCriteria for choosing the most attractive faces are less clear. The A faces had nice\nskin but it was not unquestionably healthiest from all faces of their sex. According to\nPapuans, the most attractive male face was the B face, which had worse skin than faces A\nand C (a number of blemishes). It is not clear why Papuans did not prefer the C face, which\nwas quite similar to the B face with respect to geometry and hair but had a clean skin. The\nfacialmetric analysis did not show that similarity to the typical Papuan face increased the\nperceived attractiveness. What is more, the male face that was regarded the most attractive\nby Papuans (the B face) was the least similar in its shape to the typical Yali face (Table 2).\nThe male A face was clearly masculine: possessed a strong chin, prominent nose,\nand thick eyebrows. Because female preference for male-typical facial features is stronger\nin populations of poor health and high threat of pathogens (DeBruine et al., 2010, 2012),\nand the populations of New Guinea are examples of them (World Health Organization,\n2012), one might expect Yali women to prefer the A face, which however was not the case.\nUnlike the male B face, the A face was slightly asymmetric (slanting lips) and its\nappearance suggested a lower body fattiness as compared with the B face (see Coetzee et\nal., 2009). These properties might have contributed to the preference of the B face over A\nface by Papuans because symmetry (Little et al., 2007) and body fat (Brown and Konner,\n1987) are preferred more strongly in traditional than industrial populations.\nThe aforementioned characteristics do not explain why the most attractive female\nface was the A face and why this was particularly true for Polish judges. In comparison to\nB-D faces, it was not characterized by high geometric similarity to the typical Polish face or\nlow similarity to the typical Yali face (Table 2). The reason of its appeal could be that it\nwas decisively the most feminine female face. Because hard living conditions make men\nprefer relatively more masculine faces in women (Pettijohn and Jungeberg, 2004; Pettijohn\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\nand Tesser, 1999), the Papuan males might not be attracted to a conspicuous femininity.\nLimitations\nOne of the limitations of our research is the fact that it was conducted only with the\nuse of pictures of Polish participants, because, unfortunately, not enough Papuan\nrespondents agreed for their photographs being taken in order to conduct a replication of\nthis research in Europe. Another limitation of this study was also a simple methodology\n(choice of the most attractive and the most unattractive picture); however, during the\nexperiment we observed that the Yali were not able to assess attractiveness of provided\nfaces on a numeric scale (as it is commonly done in studies involving Western\npopulations). They are illiterate and not used to participation in scientific studies. This\nsimple methodology enabled us to collect more reliable data \u00ad it is possible that some\nPapuan participants would perform their task randomly if the procedure was too difficult.\nAdditionally, such methodology enabled us to polarize the assessments and examine the\nperception of attractiveness and unattractiveness.\nAnother limitation is a low number of photographs used in the study. A different set\nof faces might generate different levels of agreement. But, low number of faces made the\ntask much easier and more comprehensible for Yali people \u00ad too many faces could be too\nconfounding for them and might discourage them from participation in the study. Also, low\nnumber of photographs makes it harder to determine the influence of particular facial\nfeatures on general attractiveness. However, the primary aim of the study was to compare\nthe general assessments of attractiveness and unattractiveness in Polish and Papuan people.\nFurther studies could also test perception of facial attractiveness regardless of sex of\ntarget/judge. Such a methodology would help to examine perceptions of attractiveness\noutside of mating contexts.\nFinally, we compared results only from two cultures. This might not be enough to\ndraw a conclusion that perception of facial unattractiveness is culturally universal.\nConclusions\nIntra-group agreement in choice of the most attractive and unattractive female and\nmale face was higher for Europeans (Poles) than indigenous Papuans (Yali tribe), which\nprobably resulted from the scant visual experience of Papuans with European faces and\nignorance of Western standards of beauty. Despite these, Yali perceived attractiveness\nsomewhat similarly to the Polish judges and the similarity was higher for choice of the least\nthan the most attractive face. The latter finding cannot be attributed to a greater ease in\nchoosing the lowly than highly attractive face because intra-group agreement in choice of\nthe unattractive face was not higher than for the most attractive one.\nIt seems that skin condition indicative of a poor health is a cross-cultural criterion of\nlow attractiveness. It is understandable in light of the universal character of skin cues to\nhealth and disease (Fitzpatrick, Wolff, Johnson, and Suurmon, 2005) and importance of the\npartner's health for reproductive success of the choosing person (Buss, 1999). This claim\nconforms with Ford and Beach's analysis of ethnographic data that \"a poor complexion is\none feature that is considered sexually repulsive in a large number of societies\" (Ford and\nBeach, 1951, p. 89) and Symons' conjecture that \"tendencies to pay close attention to skin\nIs beauty in the eye of the beholder but ugliness culturally universal?\ncondition and to be attracted by a clear, clean complexion probably are innate human\ndispositions\" (Symons, 1979, p.187). Poor health status reflected in skin condition may\nhave a genetic origin (see the bad genes hypothesis, Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004) or result\nfrom non-genetic factors, like infections or diet (Tybur and Gangestad, 2011). On the other\nhand, criteria for recognizing highly attractive faces seem to be more complex, specific to\neach population, and dependent on the population's ecological conditions and\nmorphological characteristics (even though we found no empirical support for the latter\nfactor). Skin look may weigh less here than for perception of low attractiveness, which was\nevident for Papuan judges who strongly preferred a bad-skinned male face.\nFurther studies on perception of facial attractiveness in societies isolated from\nWestern culture are needed. The perception of unattractiveness also deserves greater\nscientific interest than has been shown thus far. We predict that the higher inter-group\nsimilarity in perception of low than high attractiveness can be replicated in studies on other\npopulations, both those culturally isolated from and those closer to the West, as well as on\ndifferent groups (e.g., age groups within one population). The effect may be even stronger\nif people are to assess a group of very attractive and very unattractive faces (e.g., those of\nbeauty contest winners and seriously ill individuals).\n"
