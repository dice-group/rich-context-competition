Gender differences in functioning among older adults have been well documented. Differential reporting\nof functional problems by men and women may contribute to this observed difference. The purpose of this study was to\nexamine the gender differences in functional ability by comparing self-reported function to observed performance of\nphysical tasks.\nMethods. In 1988, 1,458 men and women ages 71 and older from the New Haven site of the Established Populations\nfor the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) self-reported activities of daily living (ADL) disability and\nfunctional limitations. Subjects' ability to perform 7 tasks was observed. Gender differentials in \"accurate\" and\n\"inaccurate\" reporting were determined by examining comparable self-reports and performance measures. Logistic\nregression determined how much of the gender differential in self-reported function was explained by performance\nability.\nResults. More women than men reported disability and functional limitation, and women had poorer performance\nscores for every task. Compared to similar performance items, self-reports of function were accurate for the majority of\nmen and women. However, among those who inaccurately reported function, more men than women underreported\ndisability and more women than men overreported disability. Overall performance explains all of the gender difference in\nADL disability and most of the difference in functional limitation.\nConclusions. These results suggest that both men and women generally report their disability accurately, and women's\nhigher prevalence of reported functional problems is probably a reflection of true disability for most disability measures.\nGENDER differences in function among older adults are\nwell known, but not well understood. Women consis-\ntently report more functional problems than men (1-8).\nSeveral reasons for this gender difference have been hypoth-\nesized. One hypothesis posits that the gender difference in\nfunction is due to women's greater prevalence of nonfatal\nbut disabling conditions and diseases, such as arthritis and\nhave shown that more nonfatal conditions contribute to\nwomen's disability, whereas men's disability is associated\nwith life-threatening disease. Although chronic conditions\naccount for some of the gender differential in function, a\nsubstantial difference remains unexplained (12).\nAnother possible explanation for observed gender differ-\nences in function is differential reporting of functional prob-\nlems by men and women; in other words, reported functional\nproblems may inaccurately reflect real functional deficits.\nMost clinical and epidemiological studies of function among\nolder adults utilize patient or subject self-reports of func-\ntional status, such as activities of daily living (ADLs),\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and func-\ntional limitations. A number of investigators have hypothe-\nsized that women are more likely to interpret physical\ndiscomforts as symptoms and have a greater tendency to\nrecall and report those symptoms (2,13-15). Gender differ-\nences in reported morbidity and disability may stem from\ndifferential perceptions of symptoms between men and\nwomen (1-3,10). Women are typically more involved with\nhealth and health care all their lives than men; females are\ngenerally socialized to pay attention to and acknowledge\npain and discomfort, while males are socialized to ignore\nphysical discomfort (10). Tests of these hypotheses are\nsparse, and none have focused on disability.\nGuralnik et al. (16) suggest that the assessment of func-\ntional disability can be improved if researchers and clini-\ncians use objective physical performance measures to sup-\nplement the traditional self-reports of disability. They\nreviewed the few studies to date that made such comparisons\nand found good correlation between self-reports and perfor-\nmance. They note that performance tests can overcome some\nof the limitations of self-reports, such as respondent report-\ning bias due to perceptions of socially acceptable or appro-\npriate responses, and performance tests are less influenced\nby culture, language, and education level.\nA few recent studies have compared self-reports to perfor-\nmance of tasks, but none have addressed gender differences.\nFor example, Elam et al. (17) compared patients' self-\nreported ADL disability with family member and physician\nassessment of ADL and with performance of ADL tasks.\nPatients' self-reports were similar to their ability to perform\ntasks; however, compared to task performance, patients\nslightly overrated their ability. Defining performance as the\nstandard, the authors found that patients were most accurate\nin their assessment of disability, followed by family member\nand physician. Another study comparing self-reported ADL\ndisability with performed ADL tasks found that among\ndiscrepancies between the two measurements of ADL, 89%\nof the subjects ranked their disability greater than observed\nperformance indicated (18).\nThough the studies that have examined the correlation\nbetween self-reported functional status and performance mea-\nsures have found generally good agreement between mea-\nsures, there are some discrepancies. Examining those dis-\ncrepancies more closely provides a means to test the theory\nthat gender differences in the way functional problems are\nreported contribute to observed gender differences in func-\ntion. Specifically, when compared with performance mea-\nsures, women may overestimate and report more, while men\nmay underestimate and report fewer functional problems.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine gender differ-\nences in the reporting of functional problems. We examined\nself-reported ADL disability and functional limitation in\nrelation to actual performance measures. Three specific\nquestions are asked: Do women report more disability and\nhave poorer performance scores than men? Comparing re-\nported disability to specific performance tasks, do women\nhave higher false positives (overreporting of disability) than\nmen, and do men have higher false negatives (underreport-\ning of disability) than women? Do problems performing\nphysical tasks contribute to the reported gender differential\nin disability?\nMETHODS\nData. -- Data are drawn from the 1988 annual interview\nof the New Haven site of the National Institute on Aging's\nEstablished Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the\nElderly (EPESE). The New Haven EPESE is a community-\nbased sample of noninstitutionalized men and women aged\n65 and older who lived in the New Haven, Connecticut, area\nin 1982. The cohort is based on a stratified probability\nsample of three distinct housing strata: general community\nhousing, age-restricted private housing for the elderly, and\nage- and income-restricted public housing for the elderly.\nThe sampling design has been described in detail elsewhere\n(19). Weighted data from this sample, adjusted for oversam-\npling in the two age-restricted strata, provide population\nestimates for the noninstitutionalized elderly population of\nNew Haven. The analyses presented here are based on the\n1988 interview data, as it is the only wave of EPESE to\ninclude performance-based measures of function.\nview refusals, and 5 persons lost to follow-up), for a re-\nsponse rate of 83%. Thirty-three of the partially complete\ninterviews were missing both self-reported function and\nperformance data and thus were excluded from analyses.\nVariable measurement. -- Self-reported functional status\nis measured by activities of daily living (ADLs) and func-\ntional limitations. Ability in seven ADLs was ascertained\nusing a modified version of the Katz ADL (20). Respondents\nwere asked if they were able to bathe, groom, eat, dress,\nwalk across a room, use a toilet, and transfer from a bed to a\nchair without help. Each item is scored dichotomously: does\nnot need help, needs help, or is unable. A two-level ADL\nsummary disability measure is constructed: needs no help\nwith any ADL versus needs help with or is unable to do one\nor more ADLs. The ADL summary measure is dichotomized\nto represent ability or any disability in the realm of personal\ncare.\nFunctional limitations were ascertained in two ways: three\nitems were adopted from an instrument developed by Rosow\nand Breslau (21) and five items came from an instrument\ndeveloped by Nagi (22). For this study, the Rosow and\nBreslau items are defined as gross mobility limitations, and\nthe Nagi items are defined as range-of-motion limitations.\nGross mobility limitation items include ability to do heavy\nhousework, walk up and down stairs, and walk half a mile\nwithout help. Two-level variables indicate score for each\nitem: able, unable. A summary gross mobility limitation\nitem is categorized as no limitation for any item versus\ninability for one or more of these items. Range-of-motion\n(ROM) limitation is measured by respondent degree of\ndifficulty (none, a little, some, a lot, unable) to push or pull a\nlarge object, carry 10 pounds, raise arms above shoulders,\nwrite or handle small objects, and stoop, crouch, or kneel.\nEach item is scored dichotomously: has little or no difficulty,\nhas some or a lot of difficulty, or is unable. Summarized\nROM limitation is categorized as little or no difficulty with\nall items versus some or a lot of difficulty or inability with\none or more items. The gross mobility and ROM limitation\nsummary items represent ability or any disability in the\ngeneral functional areas of mobility and range of motion.\nRespondents were asked to perform a number of physical\ntasks related to balance, gait, and lower and upper extremity\nmovement. Balance comprised three measures. Respon-\ndents were first asked to hold a semi-tandem stand (i.e., ball\nof one foot to heel of other foot) for 10 seconds. If able to\nsuccessfully perform this task, they were asked to hold a\ntandem stand (i.e., ball of one foot to toe of other foot) for 10\nseconds. If respondents were unable to hold the semi-tandem\nstand for 10 seconds, they were asked to stand with their feet\nside by side for 10 seconds. Each balance measure was\ncoded dichotomously, indicating ability to hold each stand\nfor 10 seconds. Those who tried but were unable to hold a\nstand at all or who were not asked to attempt to hold a stand\nfor safety reasons were coded as unable. A balance summary\nmeasure adds the score of the 3 stands and ranges in value\n= ability to hold either the semi-tandem or the side-by-side\nstand for 10 seconds; and 2 = ability to hold both the semi-\ntandem and tandem stands for 10 seconds.\nRespondents were timed as they walked 8 feet and back,\nand allowed any aid (e.g., cane or walker) normally used, if\nneeded. Walking score is number of seconds to complete the\nwalk. For those who only walked one way (n = 2), walk is\nscored as number of seconds doubled plus an additional 10%\nof that time. A 3-level walking summary was constructed,\nranging in score from 0 to 2: 0 = inability to walk or walk\nnot attempted; 1 = slower walking times (> median time);\nand 2 = quicker times (=\u00a3 median time).\nLower extremity strength was assessed by ability to rise\nfrom a chair 5 consecutive times without use of arms; due to\nunavailability of a suitable chair, 102 respondents were not\nasked to perform this task. Initially, respondents were asked\nto stand once from a sitting position without using arms to\npush off. A dichotomous measure indicates ability to rise\nonce from a chair. If the single chair rise was successfully\ncompleted, respondents were timed while rising from the\nchair in the same manner 5 consecutive times. A 2-level\nmeasure distinguishes between ability to complete 5 rises\nand completing 4 or fewer rises. Time to complete consecu-\ntive rises represents overall score. A 3-level chair-rise sum-\nmary measure ranges from 0 to 2: 0 = inability to perform a\nsingle chair rise, performed 4 or fewer consecutive rises,\ntried but was unable, or did not attempt; 1 = slower chair\ntimes (> median time); and 2 = quicker times (^ median\ntime).\nUpper extremity dexterity was assessed by respondents'\nability to rotate their shoulders. Respondents placed both\nhands behind their head, at ear level, with fingers touching,\nand tried to raise their arms up parallel to the floor, pointing\nelbows out to the side. For each shoulder, performance is\nscored as completely able, partially able, or unable to per-\nform the task. Those who did not attempt are scored unable.\nCorrelation between scores for right and left shoulders is\nnearly perfect (R = .97). Thus, only one shoulder score (the\nhigher score) is utilized in analyses as a 3-level measure: 0\n= unable, 1 = partially complete rotation, 2 = complete\nrotation.\nAn overall summary measure of all performance tasks was\nconstructed by adding the four individual summary items.\nThe physical performance measure ranges in value from 0\n--\n8, with lower scores indicating poorer performance. While\nthis summary measure is based on the tasks performed, it\nmay also serve as a crude measure of general performance\nability (e.g., those with very low scores [trouble with all\ntasks] are likely to have trouble with other, untested tasks).\nRefusal rates for task performance (those who refuse may\nbe more disabled) and resulting potential bias are of concern.\nHowever, range of refusal rates among tasks is quite low:\ntribution of refusals over self-reported disability is reasona-\nbly even. Among both men and women who refused to\nperform tasks, slightly less than half reported ADL disabil-\nity, and slightly more than half reported gross mobility or\nROM limitation. Thus, resulting bias from these refusals is\nminimal.\nAnalytic strategy. -- Prevalence of reported functional\ndeficits and performance ability for men and women are\ndescribed; chi-square and Mests determine significance of\ngender differences.\nComparisons are made between 3 self-reported function\nmeasures and comparable tasks: (a) reported ability to walk\nacross a room (an ADL item) with ability to walk 8 feet and\nback; (b) reported difficulty stooping, crouching, or kneel-\ning (ROM limitation item) with ability to perform consecu-\ntive rises from chair; and (c) reported difficulty reaching or\nextending arms above head (ROM limitation item) with\nability to rotate shoulders. For these analyses, performance\nof task is considered the \"true positive\"; to determine\naccuracy of reported functional problems, sensitivity and\nspecificity (and, conversely, false negative and false positive\nproportions) are calculated for each comparison. Log-linear\nanalyses provide significance testing for gender differences\nin comparisons of self-reported function and performance\nmeasures. Since we are interested in the difference that\nexists between men and women for false negative and false\npositive reports of disability, this test of association is\nappropriate because it allows for the testing of all individual\nand interaction terms in the models. Significance of gender\ndifferences in the over- and underreporting of disability is\ndetermined by the significance of the interaction between\ngender, disability, and performance.\nLogistic regression is used to evaluate the association\nbetween performance and reported function in a different\nmanner. A series of regression models are analyzed for each\nof the three summarized self-reported function outcomes\n(ADL, gross mobility limitation, and ROM limitation). The\ninitial model determines the unadjusted gender differential\nin function. The second model assesses the effect of overall\nperformance (physical performance score) on the gender\ndifferential. In these analyses, observed performance serves\nas a proxy for actual, overall disability. Any remaining\ngender difference is interpreted as an inaccurate perception\nof true functional problems and may be explained by other\nfactors.\nAnalyses are conducted using the Survey Data Analyses\n(SUDAAN) software, which can account for the New Haven\nEPESE sampling design (multiple housing strata, oversam-\npling of men). Results reflect weighted data, though actual\nnumbers (ns) of subjects are presented.\nRESULTS\nDistributions of individual and summary ADL disability\nand functional limitations are presented in Table 1. Women\nreport more disability and functional limitations than men;\ngender differences are significant for all function items. The\ngender differentials are smallest for ADL disability and\nlargest for summarized ROM limitation. Gender differences\nfor summary measures of ADL disability, gross mobility\nlimitation, and ROM limitation are, respectively, 12%,\nTable 2 presents the distribution of performance measures\namong men and women. Women perform more poorly than\nmen for every measure. Significant gender differences are\nseen for the semi-tandem stand, full tandem stand, single\nrise from a chair, 8-foot walk, and shoulder rotation. Signi-\nficantly more women than men had poor scores for all\nsummary measures.\nComparison between reported ability to walk across a\nroom and actual ability to walk 8 feet and back is presented\nin Table 3. Specificity is quite high (.91 for men and .92 for\nwomen), indicating that reported ability to walk across a\nroom is accurate. Sensitivity is fairly high for both men and\nwomen (.71 and .82, respectively), indicating reported in-\nability to walk across a room is a good indicator of actual\ninability to walk a short distance. False negatives were fairly\nTable 1.

This 11% gender difference is\nmarginally significant (p < .07), but is in the predicted\ndirection for the hypothesized greater underreporting of\ndisability among men.\nThe top portion of Table 4 presents the comparison be-\ntween reported difficulty to stoop, crouch, or kneel and\nability to rise 5 consecutive times from a chair. Sensitivity\nand specificity are moderately high for both men and\nwomen, indicating fairly accurate reporting. However,\namong those who reported inaccurately, women have a\nhigher proportion of false positives (16% difference) and\nmen have a greater proportion of false negatives (5% differ-\nence). These gender differences are highly significant (p <\n.001) and are in the predicted direction for the hypothesized\nfemale overreporting and male underreporting of disability.\nBecause reported difficulty represents degree of difficulty\nrather than inability to stoop, crouch, or kneel, a second\ncomparison was made between reported difficulty in stoop-\ning and slow or quick times to rise from a chair; timing\nrepresents a graded measurement which is more comparable\nto graded degree of difficulty (Table 4, bottom half). Spe-\ncificity is high, but sensitivity is very low. The gender\ndifferences in false positive and negative proportions (11%\nMore women than men report difficulty but perform the task\nquickly; more men than women report no difficulty but\nperform the task slowly.\nThe top half of Table 5 presents the comparison between\ndifficulty reaching or extending arms above the head and\nability to rotate shoulders. Sensitivity is fairly high for men\nand women (.67 and .74, respectively), and specificity quite\nhigh (.92 and .86, respectively), indicating accurate report-\ning. The gender differences for false positive and false\nnegative proportions are significant atp < .03. Six percent\nmore women than men underreported and 4% more men than\nwomen overreported ability to extend their arms above their\nshoulders. Comparison of those reporting difficulty extend-\ning arms with partial or complete ability to rotate shoulders\nis presented in the bottom half of Table 5. Again, since\nreported difficulty is a graded measure, partial and complete\nability to rotate a shoulder allows comparison with a graded\nmeasure. For this comparison, sensitivity is very low and\nspecificity is very high. False positive proportions for men\ngender differential in false negatives (.85 vs .71) for those\nwho report no difficulty but are only partially able to rotate a\nshoulder is significant (p < .02).\nFor each of the comparisons, overreporting of disability is\nmore common than underreporting, and both men and\nwomen over- and underreport their ability; however, more\nwomen than men underreport ability and more men than\nwomen overreport ability. These differences in reporting\nmay explain all or some of the reported differences in self-\nreports of functional disability. A direct test of the effect of\ninaccurate reporting on the gender difference in reported\nfunction is not available. We can, however, assess the effect\non the gender difference in reported disability by adjusting\nfor performance in logistic regression models. In these\nregression models, the performance summary score is used\nas a proxy for \"true\" dysfunction.\nTable 6 presents the influence of physical performance on\nthe gender differential for summary ADL disability and\nfunctional limitations. For ADL disability, the unadjusted\nodds ratio for gender is 1.80. Adjusting for performance\nsummary score not only reduces the odds ratio to non-\nsignificance, but reverses the direction of the effect. This\nsuggests that women's greater reported ADL disability is\nreal. For gross mobility limitation, the unadjusted gender\nperformance to the model reduces the gender effect to 1.16,\nstatistically nonsignificant at a < .05. This suggests that\nwomen's greater reports of gross mobility limitation reflect\nan actual female excess in this type of functional limitation.\nFurther adjusting for age reduces the gender effect only\nslightly. For ROM limitation, the unadjusted gender odds\nratio is 2.57. Adjusting for performance reduces the gender\nting that inability to perform tasks explains some of the\nreported difference. When the model is further adjusted for\nage, the odds ratio for gender decreases to 1.72.\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose of this study was to examine gender differ-\nences in the reporting of functional problems. We evaluated\nthe accuracy of reported functional status for women and\nTable 2.

For all measures of ADL disability and functional\nlimitations, significantly more women than men reported\nfunctional problems. For all seven performance measures,\nwomen performed more poorly than did men. This in itself\nsuggests that women are truly more disabled than men, if\nperformance measures are assumed to reflect true ability. In\nother words, women's poorer performance of tasks may be\nattributed to their greater problems in functioning.\nTo assess differences in the reporting of disability, we\ncompared performance of three tasks to comparable self-\nreported items. In these data, while most self-reports of\nfunctional problems are quite accurate when compared to\nperformance (defined as the standard), there are genuine\ngender differences among those who inaccurately reported\ntheir functional status. Among the discrepancies, both men\nand women over- and underreported functional problems.\nHowever, more women overreported and more men under-\nreported these problems.\nThere are several possible explanations for these differ-\nences. Women may have a greater symptom sensitivity and\nreadiness to perceive physical sensations as symptoms of\nTable 3.

Typically, females are socialized\nto pay attention to and acknowledge pain and discomfort,\nwhile males are socialized to ignore physical discomfort (2).\nWhile the literature cited primarily focuses on symptoms and\nillness rather than disability, it is likely that the same mecha-\nnisms apply to disability since pain, discomfort, and weak-\nness are all associated with disability. Thus, women may be\nmore willing to report and talk about their symptoms or\ndysfunction, whereas men may be more hesitant to admit\nphysical limitations.\nPerceptual differences may exist for response categories,\nparticularly ordinal responses, such as the degree of dif-\nficulty scaling common to the range-of-motion limitation\nitems. One person's definition of \"a little'' difficulty may be\nanother's definition of \"some difficulty,\" and this percep-\ntual discrepancy may contribute to observed gender differ-\nences in reported function.\nOver- and underreports of disability are based on perfor-\nmance being defined as the standard for comparison pur-\nposes; however, performance measures may not truly repre-\nTable 5.

Performance items may not reflect\nusual daily activities, or study subjects may try harder to\nperform tasks than they would in normal daily life. Cogni-\ntively impaired subjects may not understand the task they are\nasked to perform. The chance of misunderstanding is greatly\nreduced, however, since the interviewer demonstrates each\ntask before asking the study subject to attempt it. Guralnik et\nal. (16) have suggested that use of performance measures\noffers a supplemental approach to obtaining valid data on\nphysical functioning in cognitively impaired persons. Sev-\neral studies indicatethe high correlation between self-reports\nand performance measures (e.g., 16,24); thus, while perfor-\nmance measures may not truly be the \"gold standard,\" they\nprovide a good means for comparison with reported ability.\nWe were unable to directly test the effect of inaccurate\nreporting on the gender effect for all disability measures as\nappropriate comparisons were available for only three func-\ntional measures. However, the effect of overall performance\n(a proxy for true disability) on the gender differences in\nfunction was assessed. Overall performance accounted for\nall the gender difference in ADL disability and gross mobil-\nity limitation, and some of the difference in ROM limitation,\nagain suggesting that functional problems women report\nreflect real functional deficits. The remaining gender differ-\nence in ROM limitation is likely due to differences in the\nperception of ability among men and women, detailed previ-\nously. In these data, while most self-reports of functional\nproblems are quite accurate when compared to performance,\nthere are genuine gender differences among those who\ninaccurately reported their functional status.\nA limitation of these analyses must be recognized. Not all\nthe performance measures assessed are the same activities\nqueried in functional status items. Few performance mea-\nsures, and fewer items that are comparable to ADL disability\nand functional limitation items, do not allow complete ex-\namination of gender differences in the reporting of func-\ntional status. Ideally, multiple and varied performed tasks\nshould replicate self-reported function items so that an in-\ncreased number of comparisons can be examined and so that\nself-reports and performance measures will be more compa-\nrable. Despite the limitation, this is the first study, to our\nknowledge, that has made such comparisons to provide\nanother way of examining the gender differences in func-\ntion. While there are significant gender differences in the\nway function is reported, these results suggest that men and\nwomen are generally accurate in their reported disability and\nthat women's higher prevalence of reported functional prob-\nlems is probably a reflection of true disability.\n"
