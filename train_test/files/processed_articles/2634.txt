[2].\nData on the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in LAC\nregion are limited, and the few studies available show significant\nvariation in the levels of prevalence. For instance, the CARMELA\nstudy, [3] conducted in seven major urban cities from LAC,\nreported markedly different hypertension levels. For instance,\nhypertension prevalence in Santiago (Chile), Buenos Aires\n(Argentina), and Barquisimeto (Venezuela), ranged from 24% to\n29%, whereas in Quito (Ecuador), Bogota\n\u00b4 (Colombia), Mexico\nCity (Mexico), and Lima (Peru) varied from 9% to 13%. Yet,\ndiabetes prevalence in these cities was similar to world's estimates,\naround 7%. [3] Differences in rural-urban residence, socioeco-\nnomic development, and internal migration patterns could partly\nexplain the contrasting profiles of cardiovascular risk factors, but\nknowledge on this regard is also very limited. This scarcity of data\non the distribution of risk factors and, in turn, on their impact on\nincidence and mortality hampers efforts to curtail the growing\nepidemic of cardiovascular disease in LAC. In fact, national and\nregional health policies have been customarily based on estimates\nof the burden of risk factors and disease that rely heavily on\ndemographic profiles. [4].\nHere we report the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors\nusing data from population-based studies from eight LAC\ncountries. We also compare the distribution of cardiovascular risk\nfactors in LAC and the US, as a way to illustrate the current stage\nof LAC in the process of the epidemiological transition. Insight\ninto the specific differences in the distribution of risk factors in the\nLAC and US populations is important to foresee future trends in\ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the region.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the Latin American Consortium of\nStudies in Obesity (LASO), [5] and from the US National Health\nstudies based on multi-stage random sampling and three studies\nbased on single-stage random sampling were pooled. Only\nindividuals $20 years old and non-pregnant women were\nincluded in our study.\nDetails on the LASO aims, methods and measurements have\nbeen previously published. [5,7] Briefly, population's size from the\neight LAC countries included were as follow: Argentina (urban\n(two studies, both urban samples, n = 4817), Costa Rica (national\nsample, n = 2826), Dominican Republic (national sample,\nVenezuela (state sample, n = 4778). Details of each individual\nstudy, including year of study, location, sample, age ranges and sex\ndistribution are available elsewhere [5]. Institutional Review\nBoards (IRB) in each country approved the individual studies\nand LASO was approved by IRB of the University of Wisconsin at\nMadison. All participants provided their informed consent.\nStanding height and weight were measured with the participants\nwearing light clothing and no shoes. Waist circumference (WC)\nwas measured at the umbilical level in three studies, [8,9,10] at the\nmidpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest in four studies,\nand was not measured in another. [16] Hip circumference was\nonly measured in six studies, at the maximum extension of the\nconducted at least twice in all but one study [12] following\nstandard recommendations. [17] Blood samples were obtained\nafter $8 hours of fast and serum glucose, total cholesterol, and\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured enzymatically\nby automated methods.\nIn NHANES, WC circumference was measured at the high\npoint of the iliac crest and hip circumference was measured at the\nmaximum extension of the buttocks. Three to four blood pressure\nmeasurements were taken following standard procedures [18,19]\nand fasting blood glucose and lipids were also measured by\nFollowing standard practice, hypertension was defined as\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) $140 mm Hg, diastolic blood\npressure (DBP) $90 mm Hg or self-reported current antihyper-\ntensive treatment. [22,23] Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting\ncurrent pharmacological treatment for diabetes, i.e. insulin, oral\nhypoglycemic agents or both. High total cholesterol was defined as\ndL), and low HDL-cholesterol as ,1.03 mmol/L (,40 mg/dL) in\nmen and ,1.28 mmol/L (,50 mg/dL) in women. Hypertriglyc-\neridemia was defined as a serum triglyceride level $1.69 mmol/L\n($150 mg/dL). [25] Current cigarette smokers were those who\nhad smoked $100 cigarettes over their lifetime and smoked at the\ntime of the interview in NHANES and two LASO studies, and\nthose who smoke at least one cigarette per day at the time of\ninterview in the remaining LASO studies. [11,14] Overall obesity\nwas defined as a body mass index (BMI) $30 kg/m2 and\nabdominal obesity as WC $88 cm in women and $102 cm in\nmen. [26] In addition, we used alternative definitions for overall\nobesity (BMI $27 kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (WC $94 cm in\nwomen and WC $91 cm in men) based on cut-offs previously\nderived by our group for the LAC population. [7].\nWe used multivariate-chained equations to impute missing data\nand minimize selection bias due to the exclusion of participants\nwith incomplete data in LASO (see Supplementary Materials S1).\n[27,28] The imputation model was stratified by gender and\nincluded post-stratification weights, sociodemographic variables,\nanthropometric indicators, cardiovascular risk factors, and medical\nhistory of cardiovascular events. Ten complete datasets were\ngenerated and the parameters of interest were averaged across the\nimputed datasets using Rubin's formula. [29].\nWe used post-stratification by age and gender distribution of the\nwhole population of LAC countries included in the analysis as a\nMajor Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Latin America\nway to lessen potential bias due to non-response and sampling\nframe under-coverage. [30] Post-stratification weights were\nconstructed using the gender-by-age (10-year groups) distribution\nof the year 2000 population totals in each country. Individuals in\nthe 70\u00ad79 and $80 years old strata were grouped together due to\nthe reduced number of observations. Population size data were\ntaken from the US Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov) for\nPuerto Rico and from the Centro Latinoamericano y Cariben\n~o de\nDemografi\n\u00b4a - CELADE (http://www.cepal.org.ar/Celade) for all\nother countries.\nWe used multiple weighted linear and log-binomial regressions,\nclustering by country, to estimate the average level and the\nprevalence of each risk factor, as well as age and gender mean\ndifferences and prevalence ratios (PR). We used censored normal\nregression to estimate average blood pressure, as a way to correct\nfor the bias that would have resulted from lower blood pressure\nlevels among individuals receiving antihypertensive treatment (9%\nof the whole population). [31] We also explored potential age-\ndependent gender differences in the distribution of risk factors and\nadjusted for study to account for potential differences in study\ndesign and methods. Finally, we estimated age- and gender-\nadjusted PRs for each risk factor to compare each country to the\nwhole LAC region.\nThe average level and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk\nfactors in the US population were estimated in NHANES\nparticipants who attended to the mobile examination. We used\nthe medical examination sampling weights to account for\ndifferential non-response and sampling frame under-coverage,\nand to adjust for over-sampling of some sociodemographic groups.\n[6] In order to compare the prevalence of risk factors in LAC and\nthe US, we standardized the estimates from LASO and NHANES\nby the direct method to the age and gender distribution (20\u00ad29 to\n$70 years) of the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the\nfrom the standardized estimates and CIs were estimated using\nsimulation. [32] Stata/MP 11 (Stata Corporation, College Station,\nTexas, US) was used for all analyses.\nResults\nOur study included 31,009 individuals from LASO (mean age\nDistribution of Major Cardiovascular Risk Factors in LAC\nwomen (p = 0.003).

When the definition of abdominal obesity was based on the\nethnic and gender specific cut points derived from LASO (WC\n$94 cm in women and WC $91 cm in men) [7] the prevalence\nwas higher in men than in women (37.1% vs. 22.8%) and the PR\ndid not change significantly by age (age-adjusted PR = 1.67; 95%\nComparison between Each Country and the LAC Region\nWhen compared to all the countries included in this analysis,\nArgentina showed similar prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol,\nand smoking, but significantly lower prevalence of hypertension\n(PR = 0.61; Table 2). Chile had significantly higher prevalence of\nhypertension (PR = 1.48) and smoking (PR = 1.82). Colombia and\nCosta Rica, had significantly higher prevalence of high total\ncholesterol (PRs: 1.67 and 1.86), but significantly lower prevalence\nof smoking (PRs: 0.65 and 0.76, respectively). In turn, Peru had\nsignificantly lower prevalence of hypertension (PR: 0.65) and\ndiabetes (PR: 0.41), while Puerto Rico had a significantly higher\nprevalence of diabetes (PR: 2.89). In general, the prevalence of\neach risk factor tended to be lower in Peru and higher in Chile\ncompared to the region.\nComparison between the LAC and the US Population\nAge-specific levels of SBP were slightly, but consistently higher\nin LAC than in US men and women (Figure 3). Interestingly,\nwhile in the US population SBP became higher in women than in\nmen around age 50, in the LAC population this cross-over\nhappened around age 60. This seems to be the result of a steeper\nage-related increase in SBP among US as compared to LAC\nwomen. DBP was also higher in LAC men and women for all age\ngroups. However, DBP declined significantly starting at age 40 in\nUS men and women, while in LAC men DBP flattened after age\n50 and continued to increase among LAC women. Nevertheless,\nage and gender adjusted prevalence of hypertension was similar in\nthe US and the LAC populations (Table 3).\nAge and gender-specific levels of total cholesterol were\nconsistently higher in the US population than in the LAC\npopulation (Figure 3). Also, the gender-specific patterns of age-\nrelated changes in total cholesterol were similar in both\npopulations. Accordingly, the age and gender-adjusted prevalence\nof high total cholesterol was about 25% lower in the LAC\npopulation (Table 3).\nRegardless of age, HDL cholesterol was higher in men and\nwomen from the US than in men and women from LAC (Figure 3).\nHDL cholesterol level was higher in women than in men in both\nthe US and the LAC populations, but the magnitude of this gender\ndifferences was considerably larger in the US. This was consistent\nwith an age and gender-adjusted 63% higher prevalence of low\nHDL cholesterol in the LAC population (Table 3).\nIn contrast, age-specific levels of blood glucose were higher in\nUS men, but lower in US women than in the corresponding LAC\ngroups. Also, the age and gender-adjusted prevalence of diabetes\nwas lower, but not significantly so, in the LAC population.\nMoreover, US men and women had higher BMI than LAC men\nand women, across all age groups (Figure 3). Accordingly, the age\nand gender-adjusted prevalence of overall obesity and abdominal\nobesity were significantly lower in the LAC population (PR: 0.58\nand 0.79, respectively). Finally, the prevalence of smoking was\nsimilar in both populations (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that the prevalence of major cardiovascular\nrisk factors in the LAC region is within the range observed in\ndeveloped countries, varying from 5% for diabetes to 30% for\noverall obesity. [33] We also found that after accounting for\ndifferences in the age distribution, the prevalence of hypertension,\ndiabetes, and smoking were similar in the LAC and the US\npopulations. [33] In contrast, the prevalence of obesity and high\ntotal cholesterol were significantly higher in the US, but the\nprevalence of low HDL cholesterol was significantly higher in the\nLAC population. We also found considerable between-country\nheterogeneity within the LAC region. The most striking depar-\ntures from regional averages were a higher prevalence of\nhypertension and smoking in Chile, a lower prevalence of all risk\nfactors in Peru, and a very high prevalence of diabetes in Puerto\nRico, as compared to the whole group of countries included in this\nanalysis.\nTable 2. Age- and gender-adjusted prevalence ratios for major cardiovascular risk comparing each country against all the\ncountries from Latin American and the Caribbean included in this study.\nCountry Hypertension Diabetes High total cholesterol Smoking\nMajor Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Latin America\nMajor Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Latin America\nIn general, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the\nLAC population was within the range of prevalence observed in\nthe US. Specifically, gender and age-adjusted prevalence of\nhypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and smoking were\nonly 10\u00ad20% lower in LAC, while the prevalence of total and high\nLDL-cholesterol, and abdominal obesity were 20\u00ad40% lower. The\nmost striking differences between these two populations were a\n42% lower prevalence of obesity and a 63% higher prevalence of\nlow HDL-cholesterol in Latin Americans. An additional important\nfinding was that despite very similar levels of SBP, LAC men and\nwomen had higher DBP levels than their US counterparts. Such\nfinding was most evident among participants $50 years old. A\nmarked age-related decline in DBP was observed in this age group\nin participants from the US but not in those from LAC; indeed,\nwomen from LAC demonstrated a continued increase in DBP\nafter age 50. These findings generalize previous observations from\na Peruvian population [34] to LAC and hint to important\ndifferences in the underlying hemodynamic determinants of blood\npressure between the US and LAC populations. However, due to\nthe cross-sectional nature of the data, it cannot be excluded that\nsurvival bias was at least partially responsible for these differences.\nThe cardiovascular implications of a different pattern of age-\nrelated changes in blood pressure in LAC need to be addressed in\nlongitudinal studies.\nThe prevalence of hypertension found in our study (20.2%) was\nsimilar to that reported by CARMELA (18%), [3] even though\nour study included individuals from non-urban settings. In\ncontrast, our estimate of the prevalence of hypertension was only\nhalf that from a worldwide study on the burden of hypertension,\nwomen). [35] The prevalence of diabetes mellitus estimated in our\nstudy (5%) was within the range of that found in CARMELA [3],\nas well as that reported by the International Diabetes Federation.\nLAC women, particularly those in older age groups, were found\nto have a worst profile than men for several risk factors. This was\nmost notorious for obesity-related traits such as overall and\nabdominal obesity indicators as well as low HDL-cholesterol.\nFurthermore, approximately one out of three post-menopausal\nwomen was obese, and prevalence of hypertension and low-HDL\nin older women were around 60%.\nIn age-adjusted analysis, despite the fact that overall and\nabdominal obesity were substantially less frequent in LAC than in\nthe US, the prevalence of obesity-related traits such as hyperten-\nsion and diabetes mellitus was similar in both populations, whereas\nthe prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol was much higher in LAC\n(53.3% vs. 33.7%). This finding is unlikely explained by differences\nin the use of statins, as these drugs have only a minor effect on\nHDL-cholesterol. These observations suggest that metabolic\ndisturbances associated with atherosclerosis arise at lower levels\nof adiposity in the LAC as opposed to the US population. Further\ninvestigation is required to ascertain whether genetic, environ-\nmental, or behavioural factors account for these differences,\nparticularly those in HDL-cholesterol levels.\nThe prevalence of smoking in LAC population was 25.8%\nhigher prevalence were observed in younger age groups, with a\ndecline seen after age 50. The LAC pattern of smoking clearly\ncontrasts with that observed in other low- and middle-income\ncountries such as India, where higher prevalence of smoking is\nseen with increasing age. [37] This finding may reflect a birth-\ncohort effect, and has important implications, as it points to the\nneed to develop and maintain anti-smoking campaigns that\nparticularly target younger age groups in the LAC region.\nRecent international reports have noted the limited availability\nof good quality surveillance data in most low- and middle-income\nsettings. [33,38,39] Given that some surveys take longer, or do not\nmake it to scientific reports, we had the advantage of collaborating\nclosely with our colleagues from LAC region to expand the\nFigure 3.

Indeed, about half (4/9) contributing studies to\nLASO published their results as local reports or publications in\nSpanish. We acknowledge that our findings may not apply to the\nwhole LAC region, since several LAC countries, with large\npopulations or with very unique set of prevention policies such as\nBrazil, Mexico and Uruguay, were not included in our study.\nNevertheless, ours is the most comprehensive and representative\nregional study to date.\nA particular strength of our study is the pooling of individual\ndata from thousands of subjects, obtained from similar studies\nbased on random samples of the population. Although the LASO\nstudies did not share the exact same protocol, methods to measure\nanthropometric indicators, blood pressure, and blood glucose and\nlipids were similar, and should be a minor source of variability,\nwhich was partly accounted for by adjusting for study in all\nanalyses. [5] By using multiple imputation we likely decreased the\npotential for selection bias and the loss of power that would have\nresulted from excluding from the analysis those individuals with\nmissing values in one or more study variables. [28] Moreover, by\npost-stratifying by age and gender we were able to obtain\nprevalence estimates that are more representative of the whole\npopulation of LAC. Although single country estimates are\ndesirable, they would have been unstable. Therefore, we gave\npreference to obtaining accurate regional estimates that should be\nuseful in characterizing global health status and defining regional\ncardiovascular health policies. This is one of the few studies that\nincluded rural population and, therefore, provides a better picture\nof the cardiovascular risk profile in the LAC population. [40].\nAlthough more detailed information is needed, particularly at\nthe country level, our results provide further insights into the\nspecific differences in the distribution of risk factors in the LAC\nand US populations. They should be useful for monitoring\nregional trends, as well as for defining and implementing more\neffective preventive strategies in the whole Americas region.\nSupporting Information\nMaterials S1 Description of the multiple imputation procedure\nin data from the Latin American Consortium of Studies in Obesity\n"
