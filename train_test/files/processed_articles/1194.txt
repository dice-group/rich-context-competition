Results The prevalence of ever smoking among adolescents with\nasthma was 56%. Among ever smokers with asthma, the prevalence of current smoking was\n48%, and the prevalence of current smokers having made a recent attempt to stop smoking was\n57%. Having parents who have smoked, exposure to friends who smoke, and depression were\nsignificant psychosocial risk factors for ever smoking. Asthma and exposure to friends who\nsmoke were significantly associated with current smoking, and attempts to stop smoking were\nsignificantly associated with asthma and depression. Conclusions Psychosocial risk factors\nfor smoking among adolescents with and without asthma appear similar. Research on the role\nof illness in tobacco control is warranted.\nKey words asthma; adolescents; psychosocial risk factors; tobacco.\nAll correspondence should be sent to Kenneth P\n. Tercyak, Cancer Control Program, Lombardi Cancer Center,\nGeorgetown University  , 2233 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Suite 317, Washington, District of Columbia\nTobacco use has been the leading preventable cause of\ndeath and disease in the United States for decades (McGin-\nnis & Foege, 1993; US Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2000). This risky behavior is often initiated dur-\ning childhood and adolescence, as more than 70% of adult\nsmokers report that they started smoking on a daily basis\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nnearly 64% of high school\u00adaged adolescents nationwide\nhave ever smoked, and almost 29% are current smokers\n(Grunbaum et al., 2002). These and other statistics have\nprompted the U.S. Public Health Service to adopt a youth-\ncentered tobacco control policy advocating increased to-\nbacco prevention and intervention programming at the\nnational, state, and local levels (Lynch & Bonnie, 1994).\nAlthough tobacco use is considered harmful to all\nchildren, adolescents, and adults, there are subgroups for\nwhom smoking is particularly risky. Included among these\nsubgroups are persons diagnosed with chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary diseases (COPDs), including asthma. Ac-\ncording to a 1997 report issued by the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Insti-\ntutes of Health, asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the\nairways resulting in frequent episodes of wheezing, breath-\nlessness, chest tightening, and coughing. These symptoms\nmost often begin in childhood, though they can develop\nthroughout life. In addition to medication, self-management\nstrategies can successfully control asthma, through such\nsteps as identifying and avoiding environmental irritants\nthat trigger or exacerbate asthma symptoms. As tobacco\nsmoke tops the list of potential irritants, the NHLBI rec-\nommends that persons with asthma not smoke or be ex-\nposed to tobacco smoke in their environment.\nUnfortunately, several studies have concluded that\nthe prevalence of smoking among persons with asthma\nis the same as the prevalence of smoking among persons\nwithout asthma (Backer, Nepper-Christensen, Ulrik, von\nBauman, Young, & Larkin, 1992; Martin, Landau, & Phe-\nlan, 1982), or in some instances higher (Forero, Bauman,\nYoung, Booth, & Nutbeam, 1996; Kaplan & Mascie-Taylor,\n1990). Though many possible explanations for this dis-\nturbing association exist, the topic has received surprisingly\nlittle empirical attention. In one of the few studies to di-\nrectly assess reasons why adolescents with asthma might\nbe drawn to smoking, Zbikowski, Klesges, Robinson, and\nAlfano (2002) examined smoking status and a host of\npsychosocial risk factors (approval of smoking, accessi-\nbility of cigarettes, value of smoking, rebelliousness, social\nsupport, sadness, stress) among 3,234 adolescents ranging\nof whom had a positive asthma history. In their sample, the\noverall prevalence of current smoking was 20%. Adoles-\ncents with asthma were significantly more likely to smoke\nFactors associated with an increased likelihood of smok-\ning did not differ between the two groups, leading to the\nconclusion that adolescents with or without asthma may\nsmoke for similar reasons.\nAmong the factors affecting the decision to smoke\nthat have consistently received support in the tobacco\ncontrol literature are: (a) one's level of exposure to smok-\ners in the social environment, (b) the degree of parental\noversight or adolescent autonomy in the parent-adolescent\nrelationship, and (c) an adolescent's level of psychological\ndistress. For example, exposure to smoking among family\nmembers and among friends has been shown to highly\ninfluence adolescent smoking practices, including initia-\ntion of smoking and progression to greater levels of smok-\ning (Chassin, Presson, Rose, & Sherman, 1996; Choi,\nPierce, Gilpin, Farkas, & Berry, 1997; Distefan, Gilpin,\nChoi, & Pierce, 1998; Tercyak, Goldman, Smith, &\nthat parental smoking was associated with a 30% increase\nin the likelihood of adolescents becoming current smok-\ners, and the number of friends who smoked was associated\nwith a 44% increase. Smoking among family members\nand friends may increase smoking acceptability and ciga-\nrette availability (Flay, 1993; Jackson, Henriksen, Dick-\ninson, Messer, & Robertson, 1998), thereby laying a foun-\ndation for the adoption of regular smoking.\nIn terms of autonomy, data suggest that adolescents\nwith less parental involvement in their day-to-day activi-\nties and thus more decision-making autonomy are more\nlikely to experiment with tobacco and other drugs (Baum-\n& LaBree, 1994; Griffin, Botvin, Scheier, Diaz, & Miller,\nfound that adolescents with unengaged parents (i.e., ado-\nlescents high in decision-making autonomy) experienced\nthe poorest adjustment as indexed by a number of factors\nincluding smoking. This relationship was particularly ro-\nbust, as it held up across ethnic, gender, and socioeco-\nnomic status groups.\nAlong with these social factors, psychological distress\nhas been associated with adolescent smoking as well\n(Brown, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Wagner, 1996; Covey &\ncommonly studied form of such distress, has been shown\nto be a predictor of smoking initiation (Escobedo, Kirch,\n& Anda, 1996), may be associated with nicotine depend-\nence in adolescents (Kassel, 2000), and can have a nega-\ntive impact on stopping smoking (Glassman et al., 1990).\nIn a study by Kandel and Davies (1986), it was found that\nlifetime and current smoking were significantly higher in\nyoung adults (ages 24\u00ad25 years) who had had elevated\ndepression symptoms as adolescents (ages 15\u00ad16 years).\nThis suggests that depression may make an individual\nvulnerable to initiating smoking and maintain his or her\nsmoking behavior over time. Indeed, nicotine contained in\ncigarettes is a stimulant and may induce feelings of eu-\nphoria and relaxation, which could ameliorate depression\nAs adolescents with asthma are strongly discouraged\nagainst smoking, and against being around others who\nsmoke, it remains unclear how these well-established\nsmoking risk factors might operate in this context. For\nexample, are adolescents with asthma just as likely as\ntheir peers without asthma to be exposed to parents who\nhave smoked and/or to socialize with friends who smoke?\nOr, are they less likely to experience these influences given\ntheir illness? Further, because self-management strategies\nare a critical element of asthma control, one might expect\nto see increased decision-making autonomy in the rela-\ntionships of adolescents with asthma with their parents.\nWhile some degree of autonomy is likely to be beneficial\nin terms of caring for asthma symptoms, the autonomy\nof these adolescents might also extend to other behav-\niors, including tobacco use, that are more risky. Adoles-\ncents with asthma often strive to maximize their autonomy\n(Randolph & Fraser, 1999), and smoking is viewed by\nadolescents as a means to achieve it (Grube, Rokeach, &\nGetzlaf, 1990; Nichter, Nichter, Vuckovic, Quintero, &\nRitenbaugh, 1997). And finally, since some adolescents\nwith asthma experience psychological distress related to\ntheir illness (Creer & Bender, 1995), this too might in\nturn affect their smoking risk.\nIn addition to these questions, there are uncertain-\nties about attempts to stop smoking made by adolescents\nwith asthma who currently smoke. Not all adolescents\nwho smoke wish to continue to do so, and many regret\nstarting. According to the 1989 Teenage Attitudes and\nPractices Survey, nearly three-quarters of youth who smoke\nhad seriously considered stopping smoking and almost\none-half made a recent attempt to stop (CDC, 1994,\nnationwide had tried to stop smoking within the past\nyear (Grunbaum et al., 2002). Data from adult current\nsmokers with asthma suggest that the prevalence of\ntheir recent attempts to stop smoking is similar to that\nof current smokers without asthma (Wakefield, Ruffin,\nCampbell, Roberts, & Wilson, 1995). But at present, no\ndata on the prevalence of attempts to stop smoking among\nadolescents with asthma are available. Further, it is un-\nknown how the psychosocial risk factors mentioned above\nmight deter or promote attempts to stop among adoles-\ncents with asthma relative to their peers without asthma.\nO'Byrne, Haddock, and Poston (2002) found autonomy in\nthe parent-adolescent relationship to be positively asso-\nciated with adolescents' attempts to stop smoking, sug-\ngesting that further research in this area is warranted.\nIn light of these issues, the goals of the present study\nwere to: (a) determine the prevalence of lifetime and cur-\nrent cigarette smoking and recent attempts to stop smok-\ning among adolescents with asthma, (b) compare these\nprevalence estimates with those of adolescents without\nasthma, and (c) explore potential psychosocial risk fac-\ntors for smoking in these youth, compared with adoles-\ncents without asthma. Consistent with the prior litera-\nture, it was hypothesized that adolescents with asthma\nwould be more likely to smoke relative to their peers with-\nout asthma despite the fact that smoking is strongly con-\ntraindicated among adolescents with asthma. It was further\nhypothesized that exposure to environmental cigarette\nsmoking (i.e., smoking among parents and friends), greater\ndecision-making autonomy, and greater symptoms of de-\npression would be positively associated with smoking and\nnegatively associated with recent attempts to stop smok-\ning, as they are key factors shown to be related to tobacco\nuse in prior literature.\nMethod\nAll data for this study were obtained through a contractual\narrangement with the proprietors of the National Longi-\ntudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave I\ndataset (Carolina Population Center, 1998). Some ado-\nlescents enrolled in the Add Health study and their parents\ncompleted extensive in-home interviews about adoles-\ncent health and well-being (Udry & Bearman, 1998). This\nincluded information about exercise and physical activ-\nity; drug, alcohol, and tobacco use; hereditary conditions\nof health; physical disabilities; mental health; and chronic\nhealth problems. As such, the Add Health study offers pe-\ndiatric psychology an unprecedented opportunity to iden-\ntify the prevalence of tobacco use and other health be-\nhaviors within a large and well-defined population of\nadolescents.\nParticipants\nDuring the parent in-home interview of Wave I (conducted\nported on a number of parent-, child-, and family-specific\nfactors, including whether the child was currently expe-\nriencing the health problem of asthma or emphysema\n(yes/no). Based upon parents' response to these questions,\n2,073 adolescents were identified. The in-home interview\ndid not distinguish between asthma and emphysema as\ndifferent forms of COPD. However, it is assumed that the\nmajority of affected adolescents were diagnosed with\nasthma and not emphysema, as emphysema usually de-\nvelops in adulthood, often after many years of exposure to\ncigarette smoke and other air pollutants.\nAdolescents included in the control sample were ran-\ndomly selected via a computer program from the Wave I\ndataset after the cases of adolescents with asthma had\nbeen identified. The computer program sought to exactly\nmatch controls to cases on four vital statistics: (a) gen-\nder (male or female), (b) race (Hispanic, black/African\nAmerican, Asian, Native American, other, white), (c) age\n(11 to 21 years), and (d) the U.S. census region in which\nthe school the adolescent attended was located (West,\ncases (99%) could be matched in this manner. Limita-\ntions in the Add Health study dataset prevented a complete\ndetermination of the health status of these controls, other\nthan that they did not have asthma. However, adolescents\nwith diabetes (n = 78) could be excluded prior to the se-\nlection of the sample of controls as the Wave I in-home\nparent interview asked parents to identify whether their\nadolescent was affected with diabetes.\nProcedure\nIn the Add Health study, the sampling frame included all\nhigh schools in the U.S. meeting certain eligibility criteria\nschools and 52 middle schools was then selected with un-\nequal probability of selection for participation. Incor-\nporating systematic sampling methods and implicit strat-\nification into the Add Health study design ensured that\nthe sample was representative of U.S. schools with respect\nTobacco Use Among Adolescents with Asthma 497\nto region of country, urbanicity, school type, ethnicity, and\nschool size. Overall, 79% of schools agreed to participate\nMeasures\nAll of the following variables/scales were extracted/\ncreated from the Wave I adolescent in-home interview.\nEnvironmental Smoking Exposure. As exposure to smok-\ning among family members and friends has been shown to\nbe strongly associated with adolescent cigarette experi-\nmentation and continued use, two items assessing resi-\ndent mother and resident father lifetime cigarette smoking\n(yes/no) and one item assessing the number of best friends\nwho smoke at least one cigarette per day (none, one, two,\nor three) were included in the analysis.\nDecision-making Autonomy. Greater autonomy in decision\nmaking has been shown to be positively related to tobacco,\nalcohol, and other drug use in community samples of ado-\nlescents. As such, a decision-making autonomy scale was\nconstructed from seven yes/no items that asked adoles-\ncents whether or not they viewed their parents as letting\nadolescents make their own decisions about curfew, friends,\nclothing, television watching, and daily routines. On this\nscale, higher scores indicated greater autonomy. The multi-\nitem scale creation process followed the example of Siev-\ning et al. (2001), which is recommended when using Add\nHeath data. The decision-making autonomy scale had an\ninternal consistency (Cronbach alpha) reliability of .63.\nDepression Symptoms. Resnick et al. (1997) created a\nreliable (Cronbach alpha .73) multi-item scale of psy-\nchological distress/depression symptoms over the pre-\nceding week for the Add Health dataset. This 19-item, 3-\npoint Likert scale (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = a\nlot of the time, 3 = most of the time or all of the time) is\nbased, in large part, on the Center for Epidemiologic Stud-\nies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), which is commonly\nused with adolescents (Myers & Winters, 2002); higher\nscores indicated greater depression symptoms. Items in-\nclude \"You felt depressed\" and \"You felt sad.\"\nTobacco Use. Adolescent tobacco use was assessed by a\nseries of standard epidemiological items regarding life-\ntime and current cigarette smoking and recent attempts to\nstop smoking. These items included: \"Have you ever tried\ncigarette smoking, even just 1 or 2 puffs?\" \"During the\npast 30 days, on how many days did you smoke ciga-\nrettes?\" \"During the past 6 months, have you tried to quit\nsmoking cigarettes?\"\nFor the purposes of the data analysis, three succes-\nsive tobacco-use outcome variables were created. The first\nvariable divided the entire sample into those adolescents\nwho either had or had not reported a positive lifetime his-\ntory of ever having tried cigarette smoking (\"ever smoker\").\nAmong those who reported they had ever smoked, these\nadolescents were further subdivided into those who were\ncurrent smokers (those who had smoked cigarettes on 5 or\nmore days within the past 30 days) and those who were\nnot. As there is no consensus in the published literature on\nthe most acceptable definition of adolescent current smok-\nRichardson, Papandonatos, Kazura, Stanton, & Niaura,\nrelatively stringent definition was applied. Finally, among\ncurrent smokers only, the 6-month prevalence of having\nmade at least one attempt to stop smoking was deter-\nmined by adolescents' responses to the single yes/no item.\nData Analysis\nThe first step in the data analysis was to describe the de-\nmographic characteristics of the sample (see Table I).\nNext, univariate analyses (frequency counts) were used\nto determine the prevalence of tobacco use outcomes (ever\nsmoking, current smoking, and recent stop-smoking at-\ntempt). Bivariate analyses (chi-square tests and Student t\ntests) tested for differences in these outcomes among the\nillness status, demographic, smoking exposure, auton-\nomy, and depression variables. In addition to illness status,\nvariables with significant (p < .05) associations at the bi-\nvariate level were then tested in a multivariate fashion us-\ning logistic regression. These equations generated odds\nratios (with 95% confidence intervals) in order to esti-\nmate the variable's influence on the likelihood of an ado-\nlescent being an ever smoker, a current smoker, and/or\nhaving made a recent attempt to stop smoking.\nResults\nUnivariate Analyses\nFifty-six percent of the total sample of adolescents was\nclassified as ever smokers; the prevalence of ever smoking\namong adolescents with and without asthma was identical.\nAmong ever smokers overall, 45% were classified as cur-\nrent smokers; the prevalence of current smoking was 48%\namong adolescents with asthma (42% among adolescents\nwithout asthma). Among current smokers overall, 53%\nhad made a recent stop-smoking attempt (57% among\ncurrent smokers with asthma, 49% among current smok-\ners without asthma) (see Table II).\nBivariate Analyses\nAs shown in Table II, older and white adolescents, t(3,\nlikely to be ever smokers than were younger and non-\nwhite adolescents. In addition, adolescents exposed to\nlevels of decision-making autonomy and depression, t(3,\nmore likely to be ever smokers compared with adoles-\ncents who had little or no exposure to these influences.\nIn terms of current smoking, a similar pattern of find-\nings to the ones noted above emerged, with the inclusion\nof adolescents with asthma being more likely to be current\nsmokers relative to adolescents without asthma, X2(1) = 5.5.\nWith respect to recent stop-smoking attempts, only ill-\nness status and depression yielded significant findings.\nSpecifically, adolescent current smokers with asthma were\nmore likely to have made at least one attempt to stop\nsmoking compared with adolescent current smokers with-\nout asthma, X2(1) = 5.0, and adolescent current smokers\nwith elevated levels of depression were more likely to have\nattempted to stop smoking compared with those with\nMultivariate Analyses\nThe results of the multivariate analyses of the tobacco use\noutcomes are presented in Table III. To ease their inter-\npretation in these models, the two parental smoking his-\ntory variables were combined into a single variable repre-\nsenting whether either the resident mother, father, or both\nparents were ever smokers (yes), and this was contrasted\nto cases where neither the mother nor the father ever\nsmoked (no). Similarly, exposure to smoking among friends\nwas dichotomized as 0 (no friends who smoke) versus 1\n(one or more friends who smoke). And finally, a median-\nsplit procedure was performed on the continuous scores of\nthe decision-making autonomy and depression scales to\nTobacco Use Among Adolescents with Asthma 499\nTable I.

Specifically, parental smoking was associated\nwith a 70% increase in the likelihood of being an ever\nsmoker, friends' smoking was associated with a threefold\nincrease, and high symptoms of depression was associ-\nated with a 40% increase. Among ever smokers, illness\nstatus and smoking among friends were strongly associated\nwith being a current smoker, after the effects of age and\nrace were controlled for; having asthma was associated\nwith a 30% increase in the likelihood of current smok-\ning, and exposure to one or more friends who smoked\nwas associated with a sevenfold increase in the likelihood\nof being a current smoker. With respect to current smok-\ners' attempts to stop smoking, adolescents with asthma\nwere 40% more likely to have made at least one attempt\nwithin the past 6 months, and adolescents with high\ndepression were 50% more likely to have made at least\none attempt. The interactions between illness status and\neach psychosocial risk factor tested in these models were\nnonsignificant.\nDiscussion\nStudy results suggest that the prevalence rate of ever smok-\ning among adolescents with asthma was 56%. Among ever\nsmokers with asthma, the prevalence rate of current smok-\ning was 48%. Comparable prevalence rates among ado-\nlescents enrolled in the Add Health study without asthma\nwere 56% for ever smoking and 42% for current smok-\ning.1 The data indicate that adolescents with asthma were\njust as likely to experiment with smoking in their life-\ntimes as were adolescents without asthma. The data also\nindicate that adolescents with asthma were significantly\nmore likely to be current smokers than their peers without\nasthma. While both of these findings are of concern, the\nlatter is perhaps more troubling, as it suggests that asthma,\nin and of itself, may be a risk factor for more advanced\nforms of tobacco use.\nThe results of multivariate analyses imply that the\npsychosocial risk factors for ever smoking were similar\namong adolescents with and without asthma. There are\nseveral possible explanations as to why these risk factors\nmay be operating in the observed manner. It might be\nthat adolescents with asthma are psychologically reacting\nagainst the self-management of their illness by engaging in\na risky behavior known to negatively impact their asthma\ncontrol. Other work has shown that risk taking and re-\nbelliousness are positively associated with current smok-\ning among adolescents with asthma (Zbikowski et al.,\nnonadherence to the pediatric asthma regimen can be as\nhigh as 70%, and that nonadherence among pediatric\nasthma patients has been viewed as an attempt to assume\ngreater control over their illness. Though these statements\nregarding nonadherence are meant to apply to medica-\ntion usage, when combined with the data on risk taking\nand rebelliousness, it might reflect a general tendency\nTable III.

Indeed,\nwhen Forero and colleagues (1996) reported on the health\nbehaviors of a large community-based sample of Aus-\ntralian adolescents with asthma, they found that both to-\nbacco and alcohol use were highest among adolescents\nwith asthma, and that these adolescents also reported el-\nevated psychological distress. Nevertheless, the results of\nthe present study do not support the relationship between\ndistress and tobacco use, as depression was not signifi-\ncantly related to an increased likelihood of current smok-\nthat adolescents with asthma smoked to relieve distress;\nonly adolescents without asthma were more likely to be\ncurrent smokers as a result of their beliefs that smoking\nwas relaxing. Also contrary to the hypothesis, the pres-\nent study did not find support for the relationship be-\ntween autonomy in decision making and tobacco use\nwhen other factors were controlled for.\nPerhaps the most intriguing finding pertains to at-\ntempts to stop smoking among current smokers. Both ill-\nness status and depression were positively associated with\nhaving made a recent attempt to stop. It is encouraging that\nadolescents with asthma were 40% more likely to try to\nstop smoking, but, given the addictiveness of tobacco, it is\nnot surprising to find that their attempts were unsuc-\ncessful. In the adult literature, there is little relation be-\ntween previous attempts to stop smoking and the proba-\nbility of success on a current attempt (Cohen et al., 1989);\nfor adolescents, multiple attempts are common and should\nbe viewed as beneficial in that they are likely to lead to\neventual success in remaining abstinent over time (Burt &\nInterestingly, the presence of high depression was\npositively associated with attempts to stop smoking. It is\npossible that adolescent smokers regretted having started\nsmoking, which partly gave rise to their distress and may\nhave motivated their stop attempt. However, as their at-\ntempt was unsuccessful, this distress may, in turn, have in-\nhibited their ability to stop. These data suggest that the role\nof depression in stopping smoking among adolescents is\ncomplex, possibly serving both motivational and inhibitory\nfunctions.\nRegarding the limitations of this work, it is important\nto keep in mind that the Add Health study did not distin-\nguish asthma from emphysema as different forms of COPD,\nand more detailed health and diagnostic information were\nunavailable. As such, the true extent of adolescents' asthma\nseverity cannot be determined. It was also assumed that\nparental reports of asthma diagnoses were reliable and\nvalid, and that the majority of affected adolescents were di-\nagnosed with asthma and not emphysema given the ill-\nnesses' trajectories, though this too could not be confirmed.\nFurther, though the multi-item scale creation process fol-\nlowed the example of Sieving et al. (2001), which is rec-\nommended when using Add Health data, the validity of the\ndecision-making autonomy and depression scales is lim-\nited. In addition, changing patterns in the prevalence of\nsmoking among U.S. high school students since the time\nthese data were collected in the mid-1990s also limit the\napplication of these findings. Finally, the cross-sectional na-\nture of this work limited the ability to draw conclusions\nabout the directional nature of the relationships observed.\nFor example, in this study it was not possible to deter-\nmine if asthma caused smoking or vice versa. However, it\nis more likely than not that the diagnosis of asthma pre-\nceded the onset of tobacco use. That is because asthma\nis most often first identified in childhood, whereas a ma-\njority of cigarette smoking occurs during adolescence\nrole of tobacco as a causal factor in the onset of asthma re-\nthe future, additional waves of Add Health data should\nbe able to answer these questions more fully.\nThe implications of this study for the control of to-\nbacco use among adolescents, especially those with asthma,\nare clear: All should be discouraged from smoking, and\nprofessional assistance in stopping smoking should be\nprovided to those who have started. Tobacco use is highly\ncontraindicated among adolescents with asthma (NHLBI,\n1997). Recommendations to educate and counsel patients\nwith asthma about the risks of smoking, and the benefits\nof stopping, have been included in several professional\ngroups' clinical practice guidelines and policy statements,\nincluding those of the American Academy of Pediatrics\n(AAP, 1998) and the Society for Adolescent Medicine\n(Rosen, Elster, Hedberg, & Paperny, 1997). In the con-\ntext of adolescent health care visits, such education and\ncounseling can be accomplished by incorporating into\nstandard care the \"5 A's for brief intervention\" (Commit-\nclude: asking all adolescents about tobacco use at every\nhealth care visit; advising all tobacco users to stop smok-\ning; assessing their willingness to make a stop-smoking\nattempt; assisting them in stopping (via behavioral coun-\nseling, pharmacotherapy, or both); and arranging follow-\nup. Klein, Levine, and Allan (2001) reported that the ma-\njority of adolescent health care providers ask their\nTobacco Use Among Adolescents with Asthma 501\nadolescent patients about smoking, and most assess ado-\nlescents' motivation to stop smoking. However, fewer\nprovide assistance or arrange follow-up. Preliminary data\nsuggest that pharmacotherapy can be safely provided to\nadolescent smokers (Smith et al., 1996), though addi-\ntional research is necessary. As behavioral counseling to\npromote stopping smoking among adolescents often in-\ncludes an emphasis on understanding the social influ-\nences of smoking, providing coping skills training, and\nidentifying other, healthier sources of reward (Sussman,\nLichtman, Ritt, & Pallonen, 1999), this mode of inter-\nvention seems particularly relevant for those with asthma\nin light of the psychosocial risk factors identified herein.\nThe results of this study confirm that adolescents\nwith asthma are at least as likely to be ever smokers as\nare adolescents without asthma, and are more likely to be\ncurrent smokers. Adolescents with asthma are more likely\nto attempt to stop smoking, and these tobacco outcomes\nare mediated by psychosocial risk factors. Hence, addi-\ntional research on the role of illness in tobacco control is\nnecessary, including ways to incorporate tobacco use pre-\nvention and intervention into the care of adolescents with\nasthma.\n"
