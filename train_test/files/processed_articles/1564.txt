The increase in risk for death in\nindividuals with serum 25OHD levels o15 ng/ml persisted\ndespite multivariate adjustment. Thus, compared with\nindividuals with serum 25OHD levels 430 ng/ml, a higher\nrisk for death persisted despite adjustments for stage of CKD\nand for potential confounders of cardiovascular disease\n(Table 2). This increased risk persisted despite additional\nadjustment for laboratory and socioeconomic variables\n(Table 2).\nIndividuals with serum 25OHD levels o15 ng/ml had a\nsignificantly higher risk for death in 15 of the 23 subgroups\nexamined compared with those with levels 430 ng/ml; the\nHR exceeded 1.0 in seven additional subgroups (Figure 1).\nTable 1 | Characteristics of the study participants with chronic kidney disease\n25-Hydroxy vitamin D levels (ng/ml)\nRace, weighted proportions (%)\nSerum C-reactive protein, % participants\nStage of chronic kidney disease, weighted proportion (%)\nchol, cholesterol; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.\naHistory of angina, heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, or angina.\nbMedian (interquartile range).\nResults are reported using sample weights provided by the National Center for Health Statistics.\noriginal article R Mehrotra et al.: CKD, hypovitaminosis D and mortality\nCompared with individuals with serum 25OHD levels\nwith a significantly higher risk for death in 4 of the 23\nsubgroups examined; the HRs exceeded 1.0 in 15 additional\nsubgroups (Figure 2).\nCause-specific mortality\nto cardiovascular causes and 535 were secondary to non-\ncardiovascular causes.

Individuals\nadjusted risk for all-cause mortality; the 1.2-fold higher risk\nfor death in individuals with 25OHD levels between 15 and\n30 ng/ml did not reach statistical significance.\nThe present findings are consistent with the results of\nseveral recent reports linking vitamin D status with\ncardiovascular risk in the general population.2\u00ad5 At least\nthree observational studies have analyzed the risk for death\nassociated with low serum 25OHD levels in CKD patients.\nLow serum 25OHD levels were associated with a higher risk\nfor death in 900 incident maintenance hemodialysis patients\nin the first 90 days of starting dialysis therapy; however, no\nsuch association was seen in patients treated with active\nvitamin D compounds.9 Similarly, lower serum 25OHD\nlevels were associated with an increased risk for cardiovas-\ncular events in 230 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients.4 In\nthe only study of non-dialysis-dependent CKD subjects, low\nserum 25OHD levels were associated with a higher risk for\nreaching a composite outcome of death or end-stage renal\nIn addition to extending the previously noted association\nof hypovitaminosis D with mortality in dialysis patients to\nnon-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, the level of serum\n25OHD at which a higher risk for all-cause mortality is\nevident seems to be similar to that previously reported in\ndialysis patients. In the two studies that evaluated association\nof serum 25OHD levels with mortality in dialysis patients, a\nhigher risk for death was seen with levels o10 ng/ml and\nprevalent peritoneal dialysis patients, respectively.9,10 There\nare several strengths of this study that significantly increase\nthe robustness of our findings. First, the sample size of our\nstudy cohort is larger than previously reported in any study\nof either dialysis dependent or pre-dialysis subjects with\nCKD. This allowed us to control for a variety of confounders,\nsuch as demographic, comorbid, laboratory, and socio-\neconomic factors, which could affect the risk for death.\nFurthermore, even though subjects with lower serum 25OHD\nlevels had a higher prevalence and/or greater severity of other\ncardiovascular risk factors, the HRs for death with vitamin D\ndeficiency and insufficiency changed only minimally even\nafter including all these risk factors in the multivariate\nmodels. This argues against the confounding with regard to\nthe observed risk with low 25OHD levels; however, in an\nobservational study of this kind, residual confounding cannot\nbe completely excluded. Second, but more importantly, the\nfindings of this study are readily generalizable to the entire\npopulation of CKD in the United States, as NHANES III was\na random sampling of the civilian, non-institutionalized\npopulation of the United States. Finally, the higher risk for\nall-cause mortality was confirmed in many of the subgroups\nstudied. Our inability to show a statistically significant higher\nrisk for death in each subgroup examined may have resulted\nfrom too few events (and hence limited power) for some of\nthe subgroup analyses.\n25-Hydroxy vitamin D is regarded as the best indicator of\nvitamin D status, but it must be converted by 25-hydroxy\nvitamin D-1a-hydroxylase (1-aOHase) to the biologically\nubiquity of the vitamin D receptor and tissue 1-hydroxylase\nprovides insights into several pathobiological pathways\nTable 3 | Adjusted hazards ratios for the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and cardiovascular and non-\ncardiovascular mortality in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort\nVitamin Da\nCardiovascular mortality\nNon-cardiovascular mortality\nCKD, chronic kidney disease; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.\naAdjusted for age, gender, and race.\nbAdjusted for age, gender, race, current smoking, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, family history, non-HDL cholesterol\nX160 mg per 100 ml, serum C-reactive protein, month of the year of test, and stage of CKD, and urine albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio.\ncAdjusted for age, gender, race, current smoking, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, family history, non-HDL cholesterol\nX160 mg per 100 ml, serum C-reactive protein, month of the year of test, stage of CKD, urine albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio, plasma hemoglobin, serum albumin and phosphorus,\nmedical insurance, education, income, and whether the participant went to a particular place for care.\noriginal article R Mehrotra et al.: CKD, hypovitaminosis D and mortality\nthrough which hypovitaminosis D may mediate a variety of\nother adverse health outcomes, including possible increased\nmortality risk.1 These include immunomodulatory effects,\nupregulation of cytokines, pro-fibrotic and pro-inflamma-\ntory pathways, and the renin\u00adangiotensin system.16\u00ad21\nAschenbrenner et al.22 reported that rats treated with 1,25-\ndihydroxy vitamin D had a significant reduction in renal\nexpression of transforming growth factor-b1; however, this\noccurred despite no change in the mRNA expression of either\ntransforming growth factor-b1 or vitamin D receptor,\nsuggesting that vitamin D may have important non-genomic\neffects. Treatment with paricalcitol, a vitamin D analog, in\nrats with salt-sensitive hypertension has been shown to\nattenuate the development of left ventricular hypertrophy.23\nConsistent with these pleiotropic effects, our analysis shows\nsimilar trend for increase in both cardiovascular and non-\ncardiovascular mortality with lower 25OHD levels.\nAlthough the results of this study from analysis of the\nNHANES III, a representative sample of the United States\npopulation, could have broad implications, it also has several\nlimitations. The timing of blood collections for NHANES\nparticipants occurs within communities at different latitudes.\nHowever, to minimize the impact of seasonal variation due to\nsunlight exposure on vitamin D levels the timing was\nstaggered, as northern samples were collected during the\nwarmer months when sunlight is more abundant.24 This\nstudy design had the potential to bias the results toward the\nnull hypothesis; the finding of a significant relationship,\ndespite this method of sampling, strengthens the validity of\nour findings. Although the NHANES III survey provides\nsome of the best available estimates of the prevalence and\ntreatment of chronic diseases in United States, its cross-\nsectional design does not allow for direct causal inference.\nOver two-thirds of the subjects had either stage 1 or 2 CKD,\nand thus, most of the participants had only mild CKD.\nHowever, subgroup analysis showed that the trends in\nsubjects with stage 3 and 4 CKD were similar to that seen\nin those with stage 1 and 2 CKD. The baseline 25OHD level\nwas a single measurement and there were no data available\nfor either serum parathyroid hormone or calcitriol levels;\nthus, we cannot determine whether the association between\n25OHD status and mortality risk was mediated, in part, by\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism or low calcitriol levels. An\nalternate explanation for the present findings is that vitamin\nD deficiency may be a marker of chronic nonspecific illness,\nidentifying individuals who are more ill, and are less likely to\ngo outdoors and get adequate exposure to sunlight. However,\nthe present investigation was restricted to ambulatory\nparticipants, which makes confounding by significant\nimmobility or chronic illness unlikely. Finally, data on\npolymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor were not available;\nthus, the effect of these genetic variations on circulating\n25OHD levels and the potential effect modification on\nmortality were not tested.\nIn summary, the results of this study suggest that there is a\ngraded relationship between serum 25OHD levels and\nmortality, with a statistically significant risk apparent when\nserum 25OHD levels are o15 ng/ml. The broad public health\nimplications of this finding cannot be overemphasized given\nthe high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among individuals\nwith CKD, and the ease, safety, and low cost of maintaining\nreplete vitamin D levels. Randomized trials are warranted to\nevaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing\nmortality in CKD patients with hypovitaminosis D.\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nparticipants were selected using a complex, multistage, stratified,\nand clustered probability sampling of the non-institutionalized\npopulation of the United States.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate,\nusing the abbreviated Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\nequation, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio were used to determine\nCKD.26 The creatinine measurements in the NHANES III study were\ncalibrated to the MDRD equation by subtracting 0.23mg per 100 ml,\nas previously described.27 CKD was defined as either estimated\nglomerular filtration rate o60ml/min/1.73 m2 or the presence of\nSerum 25OHD levels were measured using radioimmunoassay\n(DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA). Race/Ethnicity was self-described\nby the study participants. Current smokers were subjects who\ncurrently smoked and had consumed at least 100 cigarettes during\ntheir lifetime. Hypertension was defined as present if the subject was\ntaking anti-hypertensive medications or the measured blood\npressure was 4140/90 mm Hg. A patient was considered to have a\nhistory of cardiovascular disease if they had had heart attack,\ncongestive heart failure, stroke, or angina. Subjects were asked\nwhether their doctors had told them that they had had heart attack,\ncongestive heart failure, or stroke. History of angina was determined\nusing the Rose questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a\nhistory of diabetes, being treated with medications for diabetes, or\na dichotomous variable (o12 or X12 completed years of school-\ning). Patients were classified as having any health insurance or none.\nThe effect of income was assessed by determining whether the\nparticipant's household income was o or X200% of the federal\npoverty level. Non-HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, hemoglo-\nbin, calcium, and phosphorus were measured, as previously\ndescribed.8,28 Total serum calcium was corrected for serum albumin.\nDetermination of vital status\nDeath was determined by linking the baseline data to the National\nCenter for Health Statistics mortality follow-up file.29 Deaths were\nR Mehrotra et al.: CKD, hypovitaminosis D and mortality original article\nascertained by matching National Death Index screen or death\ncertificate or both, from the time of enrollment until 31 December\n2000.

Compared with the individuals in the\nhighest decile of serum 25OHD levels (X45 ng/ml), a consistent\nincrease in risk for death was apparent in all groups of individuals\nwith levels o28 ng/ml and a further increase in risk was apparent in\nindividuals with serum 25OHD levels p15 ng/ml. The same\nthreshold for consistent increase in death was identified when the\ndata were adjusted for differences in demographics, cardiovascular\nrisk factors, socioeconomic variables, and laboratory data. Given\nthe similarity of these thresholds to the categories of deficiency,\ninsufficiency, and sufficiency, as defined by the National Kidney\nFoundation, the latter categories were used for all analyses (serum\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using sample weights that account for\nunequal probability of selection, non-response, and planned over-\nsampling of elderly, Blacks, and Mexican Americans.

The relative risk for death in the latter\ntwo groups was estimated, using individuals with serum 25OHD\nlevels 430 ng/ml as a reference. Three different multivariate models\nwere specified a priori to test for independent effects of serum\n25OHD levels on mortality. The first model adjusted for\ndemographic variables- age, race, and gender, all subsequent models\nwere adjusted for month of the year when the sample was drawn.\nThe second model adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk\nfactors (current smoking, hypertension, history of cardiovascular\ndisease, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, family history, non-\nHDL cholesterol X160 mg per 100 ml, serum C-reactive protein,\nstage of CKD, and urine albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio); the third\nmodel adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular risk factors,\nsocioeconomic variables (medical insurance, education, income,\nand whether the subject went to a particular place for care)\nand laboratory measures (hemoglobin, serum albumin, and\nphosphorus).\nThe relative risk for death of patients with serum 25OHD levels\no15 ng/ml compared with those with levels 430 ng/ml, was tested\nin 23 pre-specified subgroups of age, gender, race, diabetes,\nhypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, non-HDL\ncholesterol levels, CKD, serum C-reactive protein levels, and body\nmass index. All subgroup analyses were adjusted for demographic\nvariables and cardiovascular risk factors, except for the variable used\nto stratify the study population.\nThe relationship of serum 25OHD levels with cardiovascular\nand non-cardiovascular mortality was ascertained. For the analysis\nof cardiovascular mortality, patients who died from non-cardio-\nvascular causes were censored on the date of death. Similarly, in the\nanalysis for non-cardiovascular mortality, patients who died from\ncardiovascular causes were censored on the date of death.\nTwo different sensitivity analyses for all-cause mortality were\nperformed, as described in the Results section of the article.
