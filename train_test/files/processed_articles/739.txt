[J Natl Cancer Inst\nAs more people seek effective cancer-\nscreening tests, have their cancer detected\nearly, and benefit from advances in cancer\ntreatment, the number of cancer survivors\ncan be expected to grow. Relatively little\nis known about the size and makeup of\nthis population or about the medical care\nexperience of and social implications for\npatients who have had a diagnosis of can-\ncer. In 1992, a nationally representative\nsample of individuals was interviewed as\npart of the National Health Interview Sur-\nvey (NHIS). Those reporting a diagnosis\nof cancer at some time in their past were\nasked about their experiences with cancer.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nThe NHIS is a principal source of information on\nthe health of the U.S. noninstitutionalized, civilian\npopulation (1). The NHIS is conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD,\nand provides national data on the incidence of illness\nand accidental injuries, the prevalence of chronic\nconditions and impairments, the extent of disability,\nand the utilization of health care services. The 1992\nNHIS included two cancer supplements, the Cancer\nControl Supplement and the Cancer Epidemiology\nSupplement, each of which included a Cancer Sur-\nholds selected for interviews, a sample adult respon-\ndent (18 years old) was selected to complete the\ncancer survivorship questions. Because of budgetary\nconstraints, cancer supplement interviews were\nstopped during the third quarter of the field period,\nCancer Survivorship Section. The overall response\nrates for the Cancer Control and Cancer Epidemiol-\nogy Supplements were 87% and 86%, respectively.\nFor purposes of the NHIS, cancer survivors in-\nclude respondents who reported ever having a diag-\nnosis of cancer, regardless of whether they currently\nhad symptoms of cancer. A total of 1553 respon-\ndents reported that a doctor had told them that they\nhad cancer. These respondents were asked how\nmany different kinds of cancer they had had, the\ntypes of cancer they had, when the first cancer was\ndiagnosed and at what age, and how the cancer was\nfirst detected. When more than one cancer had been\ndiagnosed, information on the most recently diag-\nnosed cancer was also reported (i.e., type of cancer,\nyear of diagnosis, and age at diagnosis). A total of\ncer they had. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer,\nthere were 1020 cancer survivors identified. Of\nthese, 656 individuals had been diagnosed with can-\ncer in the last 10 years (either a primary or a sub-\nsequent cancer) and were asked to provide informa-\ntion on their experiences around the time of\ndiagnosis and whether they had subsequent prob-\nlems with insurance coverage and employment.\nFor the assessment of the validity of survey-\nreported cancer prevalence, national estimates of\ncancer prevalence were calculated on the basis of\nConnecticut Tumor Registry prevalence rates, age\nadjusted by sex to the 1992 U.S. population with the\nuse of NHIS weights (adults only). In existence\nsince 1935, the Connecticut Tumor Registry is the\noldest population-based cancer registry in the United\nStates and has sufficient length of follow-up of re-\nported cases to generate accurate prevalence esti-\nmates (3). To make the registry-based estimates\ncomparable to self-reported cancers, we included in\nsitu diseases of the breast and cervix in the preva-\nlence estimates [special tabulations prepared by\nDavid Annett, Information Management Services,\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive statistics and logistic-regression mod-\nels are presented to assess whether cancer survivors'\ncharacteristics are associated with six dichotomous\noutcomes of interest: receipt of a second opinion,\nreceipt of counseling/participation in a support\ngroup, receipt of patient educational materials, con-\ntact with cancer organizations, participation in clini-\ncal research, and cancer-related problems in em-\nployment. The NHIS has a complex survey design\ninvolving stratification, clustering, and dispropor-\ntionate sampling. All proportions and population\ncounts presented are weighted to provide national\nestimates. Variance estimates for proportions and\nlogistic-regression model odds ratios (ORs) were\ncalculated by use of the Taylor series approximation\ntechnique, taking into account the complex design of\nthe survey [Stata Statistical Software (4)]. All P val-\nues are two-sided; if less than .05, they are consid-\nered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of Self-Reported Cancer\nAmericans, or 6.1% of the total adult\npopulation, had ever had cancer according\nto the NHIS. If skin cancers other than\nmelanoma are excluded, there were an es-\ntimated 7.2 million Americans with a his-\ntory of a cancer diagnosis, representing\n3.9% of the U.S. population (Table 1, A).\nComparisons of NHIS and cancer reg-\nistry prevalence estimates suggest that\ncancer was underreported in the NHIS\nand that men were less likely than women\nto report cancer (Table 1, B). For men, the\nsurvey's estimate of overall cancer preva-\nlence was 20.2% lower than the cancer\nAffiliations of authors: M. Hewitt, Institute of\nMedicine, Washington, DC; N.

The NHIS prevalence estimates ap-\npear to be especially low for cancers of\nthe larynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung\namong men (54.0% lower than cancer\nregistry estimates) and for colorectal can-\ncer among both men and women (40.3%\nand 36.8% lower, respectively) (Table 1,\nB). Female genital cancers are slightly\noverrepresented by self-report; survey esti-\nmates were 5.7% higher than registry data.\nCharacteristics of Cancer Survivors\ning types of self-reported cancer among\nall cancer survivors are female reproduc-\ntive cancers (e.g., uterine, including cer-\nvical) (27.8%), female breast cancer\n(20.4%), prostate and male reproductive\norgan cancers (9.5%), and colorectal can-\ncer (9.1%) (Table 2). Cancer survivors are\npredominantly women (69.8%), and\nolder. More than three quarters (76.4%)\nof cancer survivors were first diagnosed\nwith cancer at age 35 years or older; the\nmajority (52.4%) were diagnosed at ages\nlowing their diagnosis, and nearly one\ntenth (9.9%) have survived for more than\n25 years. Racial and ethnic minority\ngroups are underrepresented among can-\ncer survivors (11.7% of those with a his-\ntory of cancer versus 22.6% of those with-\nout a history of cancer are Hispanic,\nBlack, or other race). This result suggests\npoorer survival but could also be related\nto differential reporting or variation in in-\ncidence rates. More than one third\n(36.5%) of cancer survivors rate their\nhealth as excellent or very good. Fewer\nthan one third (32.2%) of survivors rate\ntheir health as fair or poor.\nDetection of Initial Cancer\nMost individuals reporting cancer\n(58.0%) said that their cancer was first\ndetected when they noticed something\nwrong and went to a doctor. Nearly one\nthird (29.8%) had no symptoms and had\nthe cancer detected during a routine\ncheckup. The remaining 12.2% had their\ncancer detected in some other way.

Among those who did not re-\nceive counseling, most (64.1%) felt that\nthey did not need it, 11.8% did not want\nit, and 9.4% did not know that it was\navailable. Another 14.7% said that they\ndid not get counseling for some other rea-\nson.

Another 7.0% did not\nget written information from a provider\nbut did pick the materials up themselves.\nApproximately one third of cancer survi-\nvors (35.0%) reported not having received\nwritten patient information materials. Ac-\ncording to multivariate analyses, indi-\nviduals with breast cancer relative to\nyears relative to older individuals (<35\nTable 2.

Therefore, the\nsample size was insufficient for multivari-\nate analyses.\nChange in Health or Life Insurance\nCoverage Because of Cancer\nRoughly one in nine (10.7%) cancer\nsurvivors reported having been denied\nhealth or life insurance coverage because\nof cancer. Relatively few individuals\n(6.8%) with private health insurance that\npaid for all or part of their cancer treat-\nment reported that their health insurance\nchanged because of cancer following their\ndiagnosis. Insurance cost increases were\nreported by 4.9% of cancer survivors.\nVery few (1.8%) reported that they were\nasked to waive coverage of their cancer in\norder to get health insurance.\nCancer-Related Problems With\nEmployment\nFewer than half (43.2%) of cancer sur-\nvivors worked before their diagnosis was\nmade. Nearly one quarter (24.0%) of can-\ncer survivors were 65 years old or older at\ndiagnosis, which may in part account for\nthis relatively low level of employment.\nIndividuals (n  291) who worked im-\nmediately before or after their cancer was\ndiagnosed but who were not self-\nemployed were asked a series of ques-\ntions about cancer-related employment\nproblems. Nearly one in five (18.2%) of\nthese cancer survivors reported at least\none of the following problems: felt that\nthey could not take a new job because of\na change in insurance related to cancer\n(13.2%), felt that they could not change\njobs because of cancer (7.8%), faced on-\nthe-job problems from an employer or su-\npervisor directly related to their cancer\n(4.5%), refrained from applying for a new\njob because they did not want their medi-\ncal records made public (4.4%), or were\nfired or laid off from their job because of\ntheir cancer (3.7%).\nDISCUSSION\ntistically significantly higher than an ear-\nThis growth in the share of the population\nthat has had experience with cancer could\nbe attributable to the aging of the popu-\nlation, increased cancer detection, or im-\nproved survival among patients with\nsome cancers.\nSeveral factors could account for the\ndifferences in survey- and registry-based\nestimates of cancer prevalence. Some de-\ngree of underascertainment of cancer by\nsurvey is expected because the NHIS in-\ncludes only the noninstitutional house-\nhold population. Individuals seriously ill\nwith cancer might not be included in the\nNHIS because they reside in hospices,\nnursing homes, or hospitals. Others might\nhave refused the interview because of\ntheir poor health.\nThe NHIS provides an estimate of can-\ncer prevalence based on individuals' self-\nreports and, therefore, would be expected\nto be less accurate than cancer registries\nthat rely on clinically documented cancer\ndiagnoses. The NHIS relies on accounts\nof diagnoses that may have occurred 30 or\nmore years ago; while a diagnosis of can-\ncer is likely a very salient event, evidence\nfrom the survey research literature sug-\ngests that the accuracy of recall declines\nmarkedly with time (6,7). Misunderstand-\ning of the survey question might also ex-\nplain some of the underreporting. Indi-\nviduals were asked to report whether a\nmedical doctor had ever told them that\nthey had cancer; however, some may have\nfailed to report their history of cancer if\nthey considered themselves cured of the\ndisease. Others may not have reported\ncancer to shorten the NHIS interview and\nto avoid further questions. The reluctance\nTable 4.

Certain cancers that may be subject\nto stigma (e.g., colorectal cancer among\nmen and women and lung cancer among\nmen) were prone to underreporting. A\nsimilar pattern of underreporting by can-\ncer site was evident in analyses of the\nWhatever the mechanism, underascer-\ntainment or underreporting appears to be\nmainly a problem among men. To the ex-\ntent that there may be a geographic varia-\ntion in cancer incidence or survival rates,\nthe U.S. sample may differ from the\npopulation represented in the Connecticut\nregistry. However, geographic variation\nin cancer incidence does not explain the\ndifference in prevalence as ascertained by\nsurvey and registry. During 1990 through\n1994, the total cancer incidence rate in\nConnecticut was lower than that for the\nnation for males but not for females (9).\nOther cancers (e.g., female genital can-\ncers) were overreported. This overreport-\ning could be explained if some women\nconfused positive screening tests with a\ndiagnosis of cancer. There is evidence of\nmisreporting cancer site, especially\namong women. This could be explained\nin part if individuals with recurrent cancer\nreported the site of a recurrent cancer\nwhen they were asked about the site of\ncancer that was first diagnosed.\nLong-term cancer survivors are likely\nto be those who were diagnosed at an\nearly stage of the disease and who expe-\nrienced successful treatment. According\nhave lived 5 or more years following their\ndiagnosis and more than one third rated\ntheir health as excellent or good. Even\nthough cancer survivors may not be simi-\nlar to all who have undergone treatment\nfor cancer, it is of interest to assess as-\npects of their care experience.\nThe majority of cancer survivors (di-\nagnosed within the last 10 years) had re-\nceived a second or multiple opinions\nregarding their treatment. Widely publi-\ncized treatment options for breast cancer\nmay account for higher rates of second\nopinions among women diagnosed with\nbreast cancer. Hispanics are less likely to\nhave health insurance and other resources\nto pay for care; therefore, it is surprising\nto find a threefold greater likelihood of\nuse of a second opinion among Hispanics.\nHealth insurance status at the time of di-\nagnosis is likely a strong predictor of use\nof a second opinion, but this variable was\nnot available for analysis. Perhaps the\npractice of seeking opinions from differ-\nent doctors was not well understood (e.g.,\nthe question asked whether more than one\nopinion was sought, without specifying\nthat it was the opinions of the doctors that\nwere germane).\nCancer patients may have multiple\ntreatment options to consider. Educational\nmaterials can provide information about\ncancer, its treatment, and community re-\nsources available to aid individuals and\ntheir families. Nearly 60% of cancer sur-\nvivors were given written patient infor-\nmation materials by their providers. Being\nunder age 65 years at diagnosis was pre-\ndictive of receipt of educational materials.\nIt is not clear whether providers are more\nlikely to give information to younger pa-\ntients or whether younger patients are\nmore likely to request information (or\nperhaps recall receiving information).\nOther research (10) suggests that seeking\ninformation from doctors and nurses de-\nclines with age. Cancer organizations,\nsuch as the American Cancer Society and\nthe National Cancer Institute, offer a\nwealth of information; however, accord-\ning to the NHIS, they appear to be under-\nutilized, with only 11% of cancer survi-\nvors contacting them following their\ndiagnosis.\nCancer takes a psychologic as well as a\nphysical toll, and it is therefore surprising\nthat fewer than 15% of cancer survivors\nhad received counseling or had partici-\npated in support groups. Most survivors\nsaid that they did not need or desire coun-\nseling or support services, but nearly one\nin 10 who did not receive these services\ndid not know that they were available.\nOther research also shows relatively low\nuse of formal support groups. In a survey\nof individuals treated at cancer facilities\nthroughout Texas, only 23% belonged to\na support group. Most respondents had\nnot been asked to join such a group (11).\nClinical trials and other research pro-\ngrams often provide the best possible care\nfor patients with certain types of cancer.\nOnly 5% of cancer survivors reported\nhaving participated in research studies.\nThere are few recent estimates of involve-\nment in cancer research to serve as a com-\nparison, but about 2% of adult cancer pa-\ntients enroll in National Cancer Institute-\nsponsored cooperative group clinical\ntrials (12). Patients may also participate in\nother government-sponsored (e.g., De-\npartment of Defense or Department of\nVeterans Affairs) or privately sponsored\n(e.g., pharmaceutical or biotechnology\ncompanies) cancer research.\nA diagnosis of cancer can limit access\nto health and life insurance because of\npre-existing condition clauses in policies.\nFurthermore, individuals with private\nhealth insurance coverage can experience\npremium rate increases or can be dropped\nfrom plans. The U.S. Congress tried to\nremedy this problem in 1996, enacting the\nHealth Insurance Portability and Ac-\ncountability Act (Kennedy\u00adKassebaum\nAct) to improve the portability and conti-\nnuity of health insurance coverage in pri-\nvate insurance markets and among em-\nployer-sponsored group health plans. The\nAct limits the ability of insurers to deny\nor discontinue coverage because of pre-\nexisting conditions such as cancer. The\nincreased cost of the premiums for por-\ntable insurance products and difficulties\nin implementing the law, however, have\nlimited the value of the new protections\nsurvivors reported that they had been de-\nnied health or life insurance coverage be-\ncause of cancer and just over one in 20\ncancer survivors with private health insur-\nance reported that their health insurance\ncoverage changed because of cancer fol-\nlowing their diagnosis.\nNearly one in five cancer survivors\nemployed around the time of their diag-\nnosis reported work-related problems\nstemming from their cancer diagnosis.\nMost of these related to \"job-lock,\" an\ninability to change jobs because of a fear\nof loss of insurance coverage or medical\nprivacy issues. This estimate is much\nlower than other surveys would suggest.\nIn a 1992 survey of cancer patients treated\nat an acute-care, comprehensive cancer\ncenter in Houston, TX, the majority\n(58%) said that they would not leave their\ncurrent position because of health insur-\nance (14). This survey's focus was dis-\ncrimination in employment, and those\nwith problems may have been more likely\nto participate. Patients treated at the com-\nprehensive cancer center may also have\nexperienced more problems than those\nrepresented in the survey because they\nhad more severe disease.\ncancer survivors experience workplace\ndiscrimination--4% reported having been\nfired or laid off from their job because of\ntheir cancer, and 5% said that they faced\non-the-job problems from their employer\nor supervisor directly related to their can-\ncer. Discriminatory practices have been\nreported more often in other surveys\nvaluable information on the medical care\nexperience and social implications of a\ndiagnosis of cancer. While there appears\nto be some degree of underreporting of\ncancer relative to estimates from cancer\nregistry data, the 1992 NHIS is one of the\nfew sources of information about cancer\nsurvivorship from a nationally represen-\ntative sample of U.S. households.
