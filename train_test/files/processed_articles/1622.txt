We assessed trends in and predictors of blood pressure control in 8829 adult National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey 1999\u00ad2006 participants with hypertension (self-report, measured blood pressure, or use\nof antihypertensive medications), without (n7178) and with (n1651) chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled blood\npressure was defined as follows: general definition, systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure\n90 mm Hg, and disease-specific definition, systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure\ndiabetes mellitus (self-report). Proportions with uncontrolled blood pressure in 1999\u00ad2006 were greater in those with\nchronic kidney disease versus those without chronic kidney disease (51.5% versus 48.7% [general definition: P0.122]\nand 68.8% versus 51.7% [disease-specific definition: P0.001]). In those with chronic kidney disease, there were\nsignificant decreases in uncontrolled blood pressure over time (55.9% to 47.8% [general definition: P0.011]). With\nadjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables, older age (P0.001) and lack of antihypertensive\ntreatment (P0.001) were associated with uncontrolled blood pressure, regardless of chronic kidney disease status;\nnonwhite race (P0.002) was associated in those without chronic kidney disease, whereas female sex (P0.030) was\nassociated in those with chronic kidney disease. Multiple medications (P0.001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (P0.001) were associated with less uncontrolled blood pressure. Although\nsome improvement has occurred over time, uncontrolled blood pressure remains highly prevalent, especially in subjects\nwith chronic kidney disease and in nonwhites, older persons, and women. Therapy appears suboptimal. (Hypertension.\n",

We also compared the estimates obtained using\nboth general and (more stringent) disease-specific guidelines\nfor defining BP control. In addition, we examined and\ncompared potential treatment and risk factors for uncon-\ntrolled BP by CKD status.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe NHANESs are currently conducted every 2 years by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics to examine disease prevalence\nand trends over time in representative samples of noninstitutional-\nized US civilian residents.12 The survey consists of a standardized\nin-home interview and a physical examination and blood and urine\ncollection at a mobile examination center (MEC), for which partic-\nipants give informed consent. The protocol was approved by an\ninstitutional review board.\n20 years old, underwent a MEC examination, and had hyperten-\nsion. Those participants without measured BP or with missing age,\nsex, race, or creatinine were excluded.\nMeasurements\nA standardized protocol17 for measurements of auscultatory BPs was\nexecuted during the MEC visit by a trained physician with a mercury\nsphygmomanometer using appropriate cuff sizes. Recorded systolic\nBP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) are the means of 3 measurements\nseparated by 30 seconds after a 5-minute rest period. Averages of 3\n(sometimes 4) recordings were used; individual pulse pressures were\ncalculated for each recording and averaged.\nSelf-reported information on demographics (age, sex, and race),\nsocioeconomic status (education, insurance, and income), health\nconditions (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), health behaviors\n(smoking and obesity), and routine site of health care were obtained\nduring the interview portions of the surveys. In addition, prescription\nmedication information was obtained during the interview, with the\ninterviewer recording the names of medications from the bottles\nprovided by the participant. Height and weight were measured\nduring the MEC examination. Random spot urine samples were\nobtained, and urine albumin and creatinine were measured using\nfrozen specimens. Urine albumin was measured using solid-phase\nfluorescence immunoassay; urine creatinine was measured using the\nmodified Jaffe kinetic method in the same laboratory. Serum\ncreatinine was measured by the modified kinetic method of Jaffe\nusing different analyzers in different survey years.\nDefinitions\nUncontrolled BP was defined in those with hypertension 2 ways, per\nJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) guidelines. By the general\ndefinition, BP was considered uncontrolled if SBP was\n140 mm Hg or DBP was 90 mm Hg. By the disease-specific\ndefinition, BP was considered uncontrolled in those with CKD or\ndiabetes mellitus if SBP was 130 mm Hg or DBP was 85\nVI2 and JNC-VII1 criteria, respectively, or, in those without these\nconditions, if SBP was 140 mm Hg or DBP was 90 mm Hg.\nHypertension was defined by self-reported hypertension, high\nmeasured BP, or use of antihypertensive medications. Self-reported\nhypertension was defined by an answer of \"yes\" to the question,\n\"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional\nthat you have hypertension, also called high blood pressure?\" SBP\n140 mm Hg or DBP 90 mm Hg was considered high measured\nBP. The use of hypertension medications was defined as any\nprescription for diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\ninhibitors, - and/or -blockers, calcium channel blockers, angio-\ntensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), central -2 agonists, aldosterone\nreceptor blockers, or direct vasodilators, prescribed either alone or in\ncombination.\nCKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 and\nDisease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines18). CKD was limited\nto stages 3 and 4 to avoid potential misclassification because of\nshort-term variability in microalbuminuria in stages 1 and 2.19\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated according to the\nmodified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation\nfor calibrated creatinine: estimated glomerular filtration rate175\n[(calibrated serum creatinine in milligrams per deciliter)1.154]\nwas calibrated for adherence to the Cleveland Clinic protocol for the\n\"yes\" to the question, \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other\nhealth professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?\"\nAlbuminuria was considered to be present at urinary albumin:creat-\n(macroalbuminuria).\nStatistical Methods\nThe proportion with uncontrolled BP was calculated by the general\nand disease-specific definitions and by CKD status. Variance of\nproportions was estimated with Taylor series linearization. The\nproportion with uncontrolled BP was also calculated by patient\ncharacteristics and by survey year. These characteristics were exam-\nined in logistic models predicting uncontrolled BP, with adjustment\nfor possible confounders, including demographics, socioeconomic\nstatus, diabetes mellitus, obesity, treatment with hypertension med-\nications, and survey years (before and after JNC-VII guidelines).\nOdds ratios and adjusted percentages were obtained from these\nmodels; only adjusted percentages are shown, because the odds\nratios are likely to overestimate the relative risk in the setting of a\ncondition as common as uncontrolled BP.\nAll of the analyses were performed using the svy commands in\nStata 10.0 (Stata Corp) to account for study design weights, strata,\nand pseudostrata. Appropriate NHANES 8-year MEC weights were\nused; 8-year weights were calculated as follows: 8-year weight1/\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics by CKD\nParticipants with hypertension who had CKD had higher SBP\nand lower DBP than those without CKD (Table 1). Those\nwith CKD were also significantly older; more likely to be\nfemale or white, to have a lower income, to have diabetes\nmellitus and albuminuria, and to be treated with antihyper-\ntensive medications; and less likely to have a high school\neducation and to be obese. Those with CKD were also more\nlikely to be on multiple medications and to be on ACE\ninhibitors/ARBs or diuretics than those without CKD. The\nproportions on ACE inhibitors/ARBs increased from 1999\u00ad\nproportion on other medications declined (3.6% to 2.2%;\nproportion of those with CKD (36.5%) were treated with\nACE inhibitors/ARBs compared with those without CKD\nbe on multiple antihypertensive medications (37.9% versus\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\n(Self-Reported Hypertension, High Measured BP, or Use of Antihypertensive Medications),\nby the Presence of CKD (Stages 3 and 4)\nCharacteristic No CKD CKD P\nSurvey year\nDemographics\nAge\nSex\nRace\nSocioeconomic status\nEducation\nHousehold income, $\nInsurance\nClinical status\nBMI\nDiabetes mellitus\nAlbuminuria\nTreatment status\nAny antihypertensive medication\n(Continued)\nPlantinga et al Blood Pressure Control and CKD 49\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nUncontrolled BP, SBP, and DBP by CKD Status\nWithout adjustment, uncontrolled BP was greater in those\nwith versus without CKD by the general and disease-specific\ndefinitions (Figure 1). These differences remained after\nadjustment for demographics, socioeconomic status, and\nclinical variables (Table 2; P0.001 for no CKD versus CKD\nby either definition). In a sensitivity analysis, with hyperten-\nsion defined only by self-report and measured BP, the\nproportions with uncontrolled BP were similar, 51.2% and\nwith CKD, by the general and disease-specific definitions.\nAmong the entire population (including those without hyper-\ntension), the proportions with BP exceeding the general and\nThe vast majority of uncontrolled BP could be attributed to\ndefinition) rather than high DBP, regardless of CKD status.\nThe distributions of age-adjusted BP among those with CKD\nwere more right skewed (Figure 2A and 2B), indicating that\nthese participants are more likely to have extremely high BPs\nthan those without CKD. The proportions of participants with\nCKD who had BPs above the thresholds were higher for SBP\nand lower for DBP, relative to those without CKD.\nTrends in Uncontrolled BP\nFor those without CKD, prevalence of uncontrolled BP by\n2006 (Figure 3); similar decreases were seen for those with\nCKD, although the trend did not reach statistical significance\nby the disease-specific definition. With adjustment, results\nwere similar (Table 2). Significant decreasing trends were\nalso seen for proportions with stage II uncontrolled BP\nPredictors of Uncontrolled BP\nDemographics\nAfter adjustment, participants who did not have CKD and\nwho were older and of non-Hispanic black race were signif-\nicantly more likely than their younger and white counterparts\nto have uncontrolled BP by the general definition (Table 2).\nThere was no difference by sex in those without CKD,\nregardless of adjustment. For those with CKD, older age and\nfemale sex were both associated with higher rates of uncon-\ntrolled BPs by the same definition, with or without adjust-\nment, whereas uncontrolled BP did not differ by race in those\nwith CKD, using the general definition. Interaction analyses\nshowed that, after adjustment, sex remained a possible effect\nmodifier of risk of uncontrolled BP by CKD status (P0.045\nand 0.061, general and disease-specific definitions, respec-\ntively). Regardless of CKD status, participants who were\n70 years of age had proportions of uncontrolled BP that\nwere 2-fold those in participants aged 20 to 39 by this\ndefinition.\nTable 1.

For those with CKD, there were\nno statistically significant socioeconomic predictors of un-\ncontrolled BP.\nClinical Factors\nParticipants without CKD who were not obese and had\ndiabetes mellitus were both significantly more likely than\ntheir counterparts to have uncontrolled BP by the general\ndefinition (Table 2); only diabetes mellitus status remained\nassociated after adjustment and showed evidence of signifi-\ngeneral and disease-specific definitions). By the disease-\nspecific definition, those without diabetes mellitus were more\nlikely to have uncontrolled BP. Albuminuria was associated\nwith greater prevalence of uncontrolled BP regardless of\nCKD status or definition used.\nTreatment Status\nRegardless of definition of uncontrolled BP or CKD status,\nuse of a single antihypertensive agent was associated with\nlower unadjusted rates of uncontrolled BP, whereas the use of\nmultiple medications was associated with slightly higher\nrates; however, with adjustment for potential confounders,\nuncontrolled BP decreased with increasing numbers of med-\nications used (Table 2). ACE inhibitors/ARBs were associ-\nated with lower rates of uncontrolled BP for all of the\nparticipants, whereas diuretics and other medications were\nsignificant only for those without CKD, using the general\ndefinition. Of those with CKD and uncontrolled BP (disease-\nspecific definition), 21.8% were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs\nand 23.1% were on multiple medications.

These estimates\nwere not substantially lower than the rates of uncontrolled BP\n(62% to 70%) reported in CKD stage 5 patients treated with\nThe substantially higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP in\nthose with CKD relative to those without CKD is likely\nattributed to difficulties associated with controlling BP in\nthose with CKD. The JNC-7 guidelines1 recommend that\npatients with CKD, the vast majority of whom have hyper-\ntension, receive aggressive management, including the use of\n3 medications at increasing doses; in fact, consensus\nevidence shows that an average of 3 medications is needed\nto control BP in CKD.26 We found that one third of those with\nCKD and hypertension were not treated with medications; of\nthose on treatment, only 37% and 28% of those with CKD\nand hypertension were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs and diuret-\nics, respectively. Moreover, despite their association with a\nlower likelihood of uncontrolled BP, only 22% of those with\nCKD and uncontrolled BP were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs.\nSimilarly, after adjustment, only 23% were on multiple\nmedications. This is despite our findings that uncontrolled BP\nrates in CKD were lowest in those on 2 agents, but only\nafter adjustment for factors contributing to the indication for\ntreatment (ie, factors associated with poor control requiring\nmultiple medications). Although this study was not conducted\nin a healthcare setting, these results suggest that there may be\nan educational deficit in the community with regard to\noptimal care of hypertension.\nBoth patient and provider factors could play a role in the\nlack of BP control among those with CKD. Patient factors\nthat may impede BP control in those with CKD include the\nFigure 2. Weighted, age-adjusted distributions of\nparticipants with hypertension, by CKD status.\nPlantinga et al Blood Pressure Control and CKD 53\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nlack of a primary care provider or nonadherence to medica-\ntions and dietary guidelines. Nonadherence may result from a\nlack of understanding of the importance of BP for preventing\nprogression and complications of CKD; cognitive difficulties\nassociated with CKD27; fear or intolerance of medication\nadverse effects; and the cost of medications, especially\nmultiple medications. Hypervolemia and/or increased arterial\nstiffness, suggested by the substantially higher pulse pressure\nthat we found in those with CKD, may also make BP control\nvery difficult among these patients, even with primary care\nand adherence.\nThe provider's role in controlling BP in CKD involves\nboth recognizing CKD and knowing and adhering to CKD-\nspecific guidelines. Previous surveys have shown that pri-\nmary care physicians may be unlikely to recognize some risk\nfactors28 and may only recognize CKD on testing at rates of\ntraining (internal medicine residents) selected a BP target of\nand 98% identified ACE inhibitors/ARBs as part of the\ntreatment plan, indicating that knowledge of CKD guidelines\nmay be improving.\nWe also found evidence that uncontrolled BP decreased in\nguidelines in 2003.1 This may be because of greater physician\nknowledge and adherence to the revised guidelines or a\ngreater availability of multiple medications for aggressive\ntreatment of BP in CKD. In fact, ACE inhibitors/ARBs were\nused more frequently in more recent survey years. However,\ndespite this evidence of a downward trend in uncontrolled\nBP, control remains poor, by any definition, in both the\nnon-CKD and CKD populations.\nWe also found that BP control was often associated with\ndemographic characteristics. As with previous studies,6,8,31\nwe found that older age (usually associated with arterial\nstiffness) was strongly associated with uncontrolled BP in\nthose with and without CKD, regardless of the definition\nused. Although a previous study using the NHANES\npopulation-based survey data showed an increased risk of\nuncontrolled BP in men in the general population,5 a more\nrecent study by Ostchega et al6 showed that women were\nmore likely to have uncontrolled BP. We found that women\nwith CKD were at greater risk for uncontrolled BP, in\nagreement with a previous study of volunteers with CKD,32\nbut only using the general definition. Nonwhites with CKD\nwere at greater risk for uncontrolled BP, which has been\nshown previously,5,6 possibly because of greater medication\nnonadherence and worry about hypertension.33\nSocioeconomic factors, including higher level of educa-\ntion, insured status, and high income, were not associated\nwith risk of uncontrolled BP after adjustment for demograph-\nics and clinical characteristics, suggesting that physiological\nfactors dominate socioeconomic influence on BP control in\nthe CKD population. This finding highlights the necessity of\nbetter professional and broad-based patient education in\nefforts to improve BP control. As expected, diabetes melli-\ntus34 was associated with uncontrolled BP in the non-CKD\npopulation but not in those with CKD. This is likely a\nreflection of the physiological mechanisms (eg, salt and water\nretention because of reduced kidney function, aldosterone\nexcess, or sympathetic overactivity) that lead to hypertension\nonce CKD develops, regardless of the underlying causes of\nthe disease. Interestingly, regardless of CKD status (ie,\nkidney function), presence of albuminuria was strongly asso-\nciated with increased prevalence of uncontrolled BP, as has\nbeen reported previously in CKD populations.8,35\nThere are some limitations of the study that deserve\nmention. First, although we chose to examine CKD stages 3\nand 4 only to minimize the error associated with single\nalbuminuria measurements, we almost certainly have some\nmisclassification of CKD stages 1 and 2 as \"non-CKD,\"\nwhich may have attenuated some of our comparisons between\nthe 2 populations. However, because these early stages are\ncurrently neither well-recognized nor universally accepted,36\nwe believe that many of these participants are likely to be\ntreated as \"non-CKD\" in the treatment of their hypertension.\nSecond, information on treatment nonadherence, which may\nbe differential by either CKD status or other patient charac-\nteristics (eg, age or race), was not available. In addition, we\ndid not have enough observations to examine various com-\nbinations of medications as predictors of uncontrolled BP.\nThird, as with any observational study, there may be un-\nknown or unmeasured factors that affect BP control for which\nwe could not account. For example, psychosocial reasons, eg,\nhopelessness, frustration with treatment, and anxiety, have\nbeen proposed as predisposing factors for poor BP control.37\nFourth, although the method of BP measurement (office BP at\na single point in time) in NHANES was the only practical\nmeans of assessing BP in a large national survey, it may not\nhave captured all of the uncontrolled BP in the population,\nparticularly in those with CKD whose BP may be elevated\noutside the clinic setting (eg, at home or during routine daily\nactivities), and could be captured with ambulatory BP mon-\n% with uncontrolled blood pressure\nno CKD\nCKD\nno CKD\nCKD\nGeneral Definition\nDisease-specific Definition\nmmHg, CKD/diabetes only\nhypertension who have uncontrolled blood pressure, by CKD\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nitoring. A recent study38 found that white-coat hypertension\nand masked hypertension, particularly, were prevalent among\nthose with CKD; this phenomenon may have further attenu-\nated the differences between participants with and without\nthat we observed here. Finally, changes in therapy or other\npatient characteristics cannot be assessed over time in a\ncross-sectional survey. In addition, provider knowledge of BP\ncontrol guidelines in CKD and the general population and\nquality of patient-provider communication may play signifi-\ncant roles in BP control and could not be ascertained here.\nPerspectives\nUncontrolled BP is common in the US CKD population,\nespecially using the newer (more stringent) BP control\nguidelines. We showed that, although there was improvement\nin rates of uncontrolled BP over time in those without and\nwith CKD, control remains poor overall. The use of ACE\ninhibitors/ARBs and multiple medications was associated\nwith better BP control, but these therapies may be underused\nin those with uncontrolled BP. Nonwhites, older persons,\nand women with CKD, who are most likely to have\nuncontrolled BP, should be targeted with more aggressive\nefforts to control BP.\n"
