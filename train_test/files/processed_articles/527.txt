Unfortunately, over time\nbacterial resistance develops when topical antibiotics are used as a\nsole treatment (2).\nGiven the problems of resistant bacteria and given the avail-\nability of many other treatment options, should topical antibiotics\never be prescribed as a monotherapy for acne? Topical antibiotics\ncan be administered concurrently with benzoyl peroxide to\ndecrease the rate of developing resistance, or other options\n(topical retinoids, other combination regimens) could be used\nto avoid the use of topical antibiotics alone (3). The purpose of\nthis study is to determine how frequently topical erythromycin\nand topical clindamycin are used as monotherapy for acne.\nMethods\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is a\nnationally representative database documenting physician visits,\ndiagnoses, and prescribing habits from physicians who are not\nfederally employed. The database was sampled in regards to visits\nin which the sole diagnosis of acne vulgaris (ICD-9-CM code\ncollected included physician specialty (dermatology vs. non-der-\nmatology) as well as medication prescribed (topical clindamycin\nor erythromycin monotherapy vs. other). The data were analyzed\nto determine the frequency of topical antibiotics as monotherapy\nfor acne vulgaris, the trends in prescribing of topical antibiotics\nwith or without benzoyl peroxide over the 18-year period, and\ndifferences in prescribing habits between dermatologists and non-\ndermatologists. We examined the use of topical antibiotics (clin-\ndamycin, erythromycin, sulfacetamide, or dapsone) together with\nor without benzoyl peroxide, either in a combination product or\nas separate products. All data analysis was performed using SAS\n9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and the study was declared exempt\nby the Wake Forest Baptist Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nAcne vulgaris was the sole diagnosis made in an estimated\n69 million visits. Of these visits, topical erythromycin or clin-\ndamycin was the sole prescribed medication in 560 000 visits\nfrequency of topical antibiotic monotherapy for acne vulgaris has\ndeclined (p < 0.001), while the frequency of topical antibiotic\ntherapy combined with benzoyl peroxide had increased (Figures 1\nDiscussion\nOver time, antibiotics become less effective as bacteria develop the\nmeans to evade destruction. As bacteria become resistant, they are\nable to induce resistance in other bacteria by transferring plasmids\ncontaining the resistance trait, rendering an antibiotic therapy\nineffective for more than just the initial condition (4,5). While\ntopical antibiotics were effective for acne in the past, the growing\ndevelopment of resistance is decreasing their effectiveness and\nraising concern that use for a common problem like acne could\nresult in more widespread resistance issues.\nCorrespondence: Scott A. Davis, MA, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC\nWhile P. acnes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acne\nvulgaris implying the need for antibiotics, recent data finds that\ninflammation plays a much larger role in acne than previously\nunderstood (1,4). For this reason, a treatment that focuses more\non combating inflammation rather than, or in addition to, a\nlimited antibiotic strategy should be considered (6).\nIf it is strongly felt, or preferred, by the physician for topical\nantibiotics to be a part of the treatment regimen for acne vulgaris,\nthe concurrent use of benzoyl peroxide decreases the risk of\nresistance development (7\u00ad9). Do we need topical antibiotic\nmonotherapy products? Topical benzoyl peroxide in a combina-\ntion treatment with a topical antibiotic is more effective at\neliminating P. acnes and treating acne vulgaris than treatment\nwith either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics alone\n(10,11). However, the potential reduction in adherence with the\nmore complex two-drug regimen could offset the potential ther-\napeutic gain. Given the potential for poor adherence in patients\nwith acne, use of combination topical benzoyl peroxide\u00adclinda-\nmycin as a single product (available as a generic) or use of a\nbenzoyl peroxide-retinoid product may be appropriate.\nGiven the development of resistance as well as the efficacies of\nother treatment options for acne, perhaps avoiding use topical\nantibiotic monotherapy in acne could be considered as a quality\nmetric for dermatology.\n"
