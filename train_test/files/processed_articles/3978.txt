This\nservice engagement can be seen as their partnering in larger\ndevelopment goals in an essentially resource-limited setting\nmain mission of faith-based organizations is to propagate\nfaith, and hence religious imagery accompanies the service\nmission (Ebaugh, Pipes, Chafetz, & Daniels, 2003). This in\nturn influences aspects of leadership in faith-based organiza-\ntions, practical functioning, finance, and policy issues (Cook,\n1997). The overall understanding is to cultivate a faith-based\ncontext for service (Kaplan, Calman, Golub, Ruddock, &\nThis faith-based service also generates a social capital\namong stakeholders, as it develops communes and associa-\ntions around faith institutions (Boix & Posner, 1998). Social\ncapital is defined by Putnam (1995) as \"features of social\norganization such as networks, norms and social trust that\nfacilitate co-ordination and co-operation for mutual benefit\"\n(p. 66). Viewed as an asset for mutually beneficial collective\naction, Putnam (2000) has further specified two types of\nsocial capital--bonding and bridging. Bonding social capital\nis more inward looking and tends to reenforce exclusive\nidentities and homogeneous groups. Bridging social capital\nis oriented toward external linkage to assets and information\ndiffusion and can generate broader identities and reciprocity.\nReligion and faith are instruments in promoting social capi-\ntal through varied institutional forms (Fukuyama, 1995).\nFaith-based service efforts in particular create a net of stake-\nholders, which take the shape of communes and habitus of\nadherents. In the case of social services (such as health, edu-\ncation, livelihood initiatives, and other social projects), there\nare project beneficiaries who align to these institutions.\nThe focus of this article is to look at the beneficiaries or\nrecipients of social service initiatives of a particular type of\nfaith-based organizations in India--broadly termed as Indic\nfaith-based organizations (IFBOs). According to Berger\n(2003), faith-based voluntary organizations can be defined as\nformal organizations whose identity and mission are self-\nconsciously derived from the teachings of one or more reli-\ngious or spiritual traditions and which operate on a nonprofit,\nindependent voluntary basis to promote and realize\n1Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India\nCorresponding Author:\nSamta P.

Although faith-based volun-\ntary organizations operate within the same legal and political\nframeworks of secular civil society institutions, their mis-\nsions and operations are guided by a concept of the divine\nand the recognition of the sacred nature of human life\n(Anhelm, 1999). In contrast to the rights-based approach of\nmany secular NGOs, the starting point of religious organiza-\ntions is the duty-oriented language of religion characterized\nby obligations toward the divine and others, by a belief in the\ntransformative capacities and a concern for justice and rec-\nfaith-based organizations specialize in or are particularly\nwell suited for certain kinds of social service activities such\nas holistic social service delivery that focuses on personal\ntransformation. This assumption is evident in the \"ur-text\" of\ncompassionate conservatism, and it is often made explicit by\nthose who advocate for an expanded role for faith-based\norganizations in the social welfare system. There are condi-\ntions that facilitate the flourishing of faith-based organiza-\ntions, which entail providing followers an access to the\nsacred at the deep level, engendering experiences of the\nsacred, breaking down the dichotomy between mind and\nbody in worship so as to experiment with worship styles\n(sometimes including music) and hence communicating with\nthe new generation, and giving credence to theology as\nemerging out of members' own experiences of the sacred\nThe origins of Indic faith-based voluntary organizations\ncan be traced to the 19th-century period of Hindu reform\nmovements. Similar to congregations in the United States,\nthese faith-based voluntary organizations have formed an\nintegral aspect of voluntary action/initiatives in the area of\nwelfare and development in the Indian context\ntheoretical support to this epistemic link comes from Weber's\nemphasis on faith as an independent causal element influenc-\ning action throughout history. In the Weberian sense, just like\nhow Calvinist modernity inspired political revolutions,\nwhich since the 17th century irreversibly transformed\nWestern feudal societies into bourgeoisie democratic nation-\nstates, the Indian version of Reformation (to use Talal Asad's\ncultural contextualization) was marked by the rediscovery,\nreinterpretation and public dissemination of Vedanta or the\nphilosophy of nonduality (Van Bijlert, 2003), which these\norganizations undertook on a grand scale.\nIFBOs are those aligning and adhering to tenets of Indic\nfaiths and syncretic tenets therein. Indic faiths are system-\natized faiths that have their origin in the Indian subcontinent\nand constitute the core subject matter of Indological studies\n(Madan, 2004). In terms of Indic faith-based voluntary orga-\nnizations, there is a further bifurcation--those aligning to the\ntenets of the theistic gnostic school inferring particularly\nfrom Vedic tenets, post-Vedic developments and contempo-\nrary strands within the purview of Hinduism. The stances\ncould be purist or syncretic depending upon the orientation\nof the charismatic leader/teacher (Copley, 2000). The other\ncategory is of those organizations adhering primarily to the\natheistic agnostic school--the Indic pragmatists aligning to\ntenets of Jainism, Buddhism, and the multifarious sects and\nMost of the organizations within the theistic gnostic realm\nare headed by teachers or gurus and/or their disciples, their\nideological leanings basically translating into the ideology,\nvision, or mission of the organizations. These are institution-\nalized religious structures that represent change of religion as\na social institution over time. They question hegemony and\nyet remain traditional in many ways, thereby characterizing\na soft revolution (because they do not take on issues directly\nbut do so by remaining within norms of tradition; Rustau,\nsignifying a simplification of traditional tenets. \"Hindu\nIndia\" (as the imagination of an ideal nation conceived by\nthem) herein is presented as an embodiment of the divine and\nthe focus is on \"service\" of the \"Hindu nation.\" Two ele-\nments that characterize these organizations are spiritual uni-\nversalism and cultural nationalism, that is, universality of the\nspiritual reality or Brahman and the cultural importance of\n\"one India\" (Heehs, 2003). These organizations answered\nchallenges posed by colonialism by the \"invention of tradi-\ntion\" and \"translation of carefully selected elements of the\nindigenous cultural repertoire of the orient vis-\u00e0-vis the occi-\ndent.\" However, in doing so, they also ended up confirming\nthe hegemonic claims of these alien categories (Fischer-Tine,\n2003). These organizations are in many ways \"Hinduizing\nagents\" popularizing the nationalist ideology of Hindutva\nproponents. However, the contemporary phenomenon is that\nof avatar gurus--important element in whose endeavor to\nfulfill the earthly missions is the setting up of institutional\norganizations. There are elaborate mechanics of institutional\nbuilding: ethics of seva (service) as crucial to the spirit of\ninstitution building. Thus, seva is panegyric, that is, it consti-\ntutes an expression of the Hindu topography of the self where\nthe prototypical act of worship is the glorification of the\nCharacteristically thus, IFBOs have an associate/adherent\nbase, undertake social initiatives and attempt to \"reach out\"\nand thereby also constitute a beneficiary base. The process is\na dual one--wherein at one level IFBOs attempt to \"serve\"\nand at another \"spread the normative-ideational message\"\nand thereby consolidate their base. With social projects as\nthe entry point, this article attempts to examine these IFBOs'\nbeneficiaries' profiles, service experiences, and perceived\nimplications for self and society. Through this profile map-\nping of IFBOs' social service projects beneficiaries, looking\nat their service experiences and the perceived implications of\nthis service for themselves and society at large, the attempt is\nto then broadly analyze the social stake of IFBOs. Social\nstake refers to understanding IFBOs as actors in civil society\nand as generators of social capital.\nFaith-Based Program Beneficiaries\nStudies have attempted to look at the effectiveness of pro-\ngrams administered by faith-based organizations. Primarily,\nthe focus has been on beneficiary/clientele satisfaction as a\nparameter for efficacy (Ferguson, Wu, Sprujit-Metz, &\nDyrness, 2007). Earlier studies are those of church-based\nprograms for prisoner beneficiaries (Johnson, 2002; Johnson,\nLarson, & Pitts, 1997; O'Connor, Su, Ryan, Parikh, &\nAlexander, 1997) and church/congregation-based health pro-\ngrams for larger beneficiary groups (Brudenell, 2003;\nCampbell et al., 2000; Fox, Stein, Gonsalez, Farrenkopf, &\nDellinger, 1998). Yet another genre is on church programs\nfor youth beneficiaries on areas of substance abuse and crime\nprevention (Berrien, McRoberts, & Winship, 2000; Hood,\n2000). Further beneficiaries of employment generation pro-\ngrams of churches/congregations have been studied\non church's work with youth and vulnerable families have\nalso been undertaken (Thompson, 1994; Winship &\nIn the Indian context in particular, there are a few studies\non \"devotees\" of faith-based organizations, with little focus\non faith-based organizations' social programs and the corre-\nsponding beneficiaries. Studies are largely descriptive\naccounts of socioreligious organizations highlighting their\nideological underpinnings, social outreach, and implications\nhave highlighted the involvement of these organizations with\n\"subaltern groups\" or \"people on the margins\" (Hardimann,\nefforts in the diaspora with beneficiaries of other nations\n(other than India) has received a mention in works of\nSquarcini and Crnic have studied the devotees of International\nSociety for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in the\nDiaspora and M. Wood has looked at the devotees of the\nJalaram Bapa (a 19th-century Gujarati saint) tradition in the\nUnited Kingdom. Further specific faith and spiritual tech-\nniques of Art of Living Foundation called the Sudarshan\nKriya and Pranayama (SK&P) and Integral Yoga (IY) of Sri\nAurobindo Ashram and Society, have received scientific\ntreatments. Other such practices are Integrated Meditation,\nTranscendental Meditation, and Raja Yoga. There is a body\nof systematic scientific literature examining the efficacy of\nSK&P procedure for health and well-being--such as effi-\ncacy for dysthymic patients and for patients of depression\nand melancholia (Gangadhar, Janakiramaiah, Sudarshan, &\non brain function, regulating blood cortisol or stress hor-\nmone, and for treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression has\nalso been studied. The effects of SK&P for improving the\nhealth and well-being of individuals with HIV/AIDS and\nsubstance abuse (Vedamurthachar et al., 2006) have also\nbeen examined as also in counseling postdisaster situations\n(Descilo et al., 2009). With respect to the IY technique, some\nof the interpretations available are that of reversal of con-\nsciousness (Dalal, 2001); and the alterations in the con-\nsciousness process (which in turn encompasses three\nfunctional subsystems--attention, awareness, and memory;\nNarayanan, 2001). Considering that IFBOs historically have\nengaged in social service activities, cumulative data on their\nsocial service project beneficiaries are required. An initial\neffort has been made in the present study.\nMethod\nThe objectives are to examine the (a) sociodemographic pro-\nfiles, (b) service experiences, (c) perceived self-society\nimplications of the beneficiaries, and (d) perceived distinc-\ntiveness from other social initiatives. A two-stage sampling\nprocedure was adopted. In the first stage, the range of IFBOs\nwas mapped and the universe of IFBOs (inferring from the\ntheistic gnostic school) was charted. With the core criteria of\nsocial engagements, the sampling frame was determined\nfrom which nine IFBOs were selected with the additional cri-\nteria of era of origin, core ideological orientation as in the\nvision\u00admission (primarily faith-oriented and spiritual or pri-\nmarily political) and size. Seven of the nine organizations\nselected qualify as faith-based movements with a global\nspread and two have intercountry branches and a different\nkind of translocal presence entailing a virtual export of the\ncharisma. Virtual export refers to online presence of the\nIFBO and its charismatic teacher. Two projects/social initia-\ntives per organization (total 18) were identified through con-\nvenience and selective sampling. Permissions were a key\ncomponent in determining which social projects would be\nselected. Three projects were on health issues (including out-\nreach programs and health support services), two on liveli-\nhoodissues,fiveonruraldevelopment,twoonecology-related\nissues (natural resource development) and one each on edu-\ncation, disaster management/rehabilitation, customized pro-\ngram, that is, training/outreach program backed by the\nIFBO's ideology, residential institution and services for the\nelderly, residential institution for children, economic empow-\nerment, and leadership skills/life skills development.\nIn the second stage, beneficiaries, that is, those availing of\nthe project services on record were identified through a mod-\nified version of probability proportional to size (PPS) sam-\npling. Herein the sites were preidentified as the 18 projects/\nprograms of the IFBOs. The cumulative total number of ben-\neficiaries for each project (as available in documented form)\nproject sites). One twentieth of the total (keeping in mind\ncost and time considerations) was the desired sample size,\nthat is, the sampling interval was fixed at 20 and random start\nat one. Starting from the first project to the 18th, every 20th\nbeneficiary was interviewed (with movement to next in\nrange in case of nonresponse). This ensured equivalent cov-\nerage across projects as also a random and representative\n4 SAGE Open\nsample considering the range of projects, issues covered,\ngeographical spread as also aspects of access, permission,\nand language. Defining the sampling universe by placing all\nproject beneficiaries in a single sequence and identifying the\nsample from the cumulative total of beneficiaries ensured a\n\"probability proportional to project beneficiary population\nsize\" sample. The total sample size for beneficiaries is 966,\nand the average response rate was 74.76%. Beneficiary data\nwere collected through a structured interview schedule.\nSpecific questions were on sociodemographic profile, dura-\ntion, and nature of service obtained, perceived influence of\nfaith on service delivery, familiarity with respective IFBOs'\nvision\u00admission as well as teachings and personnel contact\nduring service delivery. Semi-open-ended questions were\nposed in terms of perceived implications for self, society, and\nperceived differentials vis-\u00e0-vis other social initiatives.\nQualitative responses on perceived implications were coded\nusing the Atlas ti computer package prior to statistical proce-\ndures. The statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 15\ncomputer package. Univariate and bivariate analysis of data\nhas been undertaken with regression analysis of perceived\nimplications by beneficiaries for self and society at large. All\nthe predictor nominal variables were recoded into binary\n(dummy) or suitable contrast variables for the multiple linear\nregression procedures.\nMain Findings\nProject/Program Type and Background\nCharacteristics of Beneficiaries\nAs depicted in Table 1, the beneficiaries of the IFBOs under\nthe study sampled as per the PPS sampling strategy were dis-\ntributed as per the project/program type thus. Close to one\nfourth (26.7%) were beneficiaries of the rural development\nprograms of the IFBOs. About 17.1% were beneficiaries of\necology-related programs and 13.5% of the health projects.\nClose to one tenth (9.3%) benefited from the livelihood pro-\ngrams followed by economic empowerment and leadership\nskills/life skills development programs (7.3%). Other pro-\ngrams included disaster management, residential institutions,\nand services for the elderly, customized programs referring\nto group-specific projects (such as training of trainers and\nprison programs), and educational and residential institu-\ntions for children. Age distribution revealed that majority\nfifth of the beneficiaries (59.3%) resided in rural areas and\napproximately one fourth (26.1%) resided in semiurban set-\ntings. About 50.8% of the beneficiaries were women and\ntenth (9.5%) were never married, and close to one fourth\ntherestalignedtootherreligions(whichincludedChristianity,\nZoroastrianism, Sikhism, and Islam in small proportions). A\nthird (32.6%) belonged to the general category in terms of\nethnicity, about 30.4% belonged to backward classes, sched-\nIn terms of education level, one tenth of the beneficiaries\nwere graduates and 7.8% had no formal education. Close to\na fourth each had education up to primary school (23.2%), up\nto secondary school (24.9%), and up to higher secondary\nschool (26%). About 8% had postgraduate and professional-\nlevel qualifications. Majority (32.6%) were undertaking\nagricultural labor, two fifth (20.3%) undertook part-time\nwork, 16% were self-employed, and 12.3% were never\nemployed. About 9.1% were in service, 5.1% were retired,\nand 4.6% undertook some home-based work. Approximately\nhalf (51.6%) had a monthly per capita expenditure estimate\n(MPCE; in INR) of less than INR500. About one third\nHence, majority (81.7%) of the beneficiaries' had lower\nexpenditure levels and half were in the poverty bracket.\nService Experiences\nIn terms of duration of services obtained, as depicted in\nTable 2, more than two fifth (42.4%) had availed of project/\nprogram services of IFBOs for 2 years and more. About one\nfifth had obtained services for 6 months to 2 years (22.3%)\nand 3 to 6 months (19.2%), respectively. Hence majority\n(83.9%) had obtained services for 3 months and more. Nature\nof services obtained included approximately one third\n(29.9%) availing services entailing development of liveli-\nhood means. About 13.8% availed health-related services and\n12.3% used watershed and farm mechanism support. Other\nservices included renewable energy/natural resource develop-\nment programs (9.9%), listening to spiritual discourse for\nself-development (9.3%), education services (6.1%), housing\nsupport/reconstruction (6.2%), technical support for agro/cot-\ntage industry (6.5%), residential care (95.4%), and food relief\nand other modes of sustenance (0.5%).\nAbout two fifth (39.9%) of the beneficiaries did not see\nthe influence of faith in service delivery. Close to one third\n(34.8%) of them perceived the influence to some extent and\none fourth (25.4%) saw the influence to a large extent. In\nterms of familiarity/orientation to the organizational vision\u00ad\nmission, close to one fourth proposed that it happened at the\ntional vision\u00admission was not discussed. Few however said\nthat it was done occasionally (21%) or that periodic sessions\nwere held (20%). About one tenth of the beneficiaries pro-\nposed that such exercises were undertaken always. Majority\n(65%) of the beneficiaries were familiar with the teachings\nof the charismatic guru (the main teacher or seer to whom the\nfollowers have been attracted on the basis of their allure).\nClose to a third (32.2%) proposed that the personnel contact\nduring service was of the monastic order members. More\nthan two fifth (42.4%) proposed that staff contact was most\nduring service delivery and a tenth (10.4%) proposed that\nthey came in contact with senior member adherents.\nTable 1.

In terms of personnel contact dur-\ning service delivery, on the Pearson's chi-square test of\nsignificance, all the associations except religion were signifi-\ncant. This probably provides testimony to the fact that IFBOs\nundertake mass outreach through monastic order members,\nsenior adherents, staff, and volunteers and endeavor to cater\nto maximum possible beneficiaries irrespective of their reli-\ngion of origin. The idea could be to accumulate as much reli-\ngiosocial capital and brand building through bridging\npolicies.\nPerceived Implications for Self, Society, and\nDistinctiveness From Other Social Initiatives\nIn terms of implications for self, as depicted in Table 3,\napproximately half (49.9%) of the respondents proposed that\nIFBOs projects enabled meeting their livelihood needs and\nensured self-sufficiency. About 16.6% saw them as building\na camaraderie/communitas with the organization and 16.1%\nviewed them as enabling personal growth and self-develop-\nment. Close to one tenth (10.1%) perceived the implications\nfor themselves as providing spiritual/faith-oriented anchor\npoints and support and 7.2% perceived the social service\nprojects of the IFBOs as modes of enabling conscientization\non the organizational ideology. In terms of beneficiaries'per-\nceived implications of the IFBOs social service involve-\nments for the society, about two fifth (39.4%) saw the IFBOs\nTable 3.

A little more than one fifth (22.3%) proposed that\nsomething is unique in terms of orientation (i.e., they felt that\nsomething was different and distinct in their ideology and\napproach)--however, they could not articulate the exact\nnature of the difference. About 16.9% said that there was no\ndifference between IFBOs social initiatives and those of\nother organizations and an equal proportion (16.8%) said\nthat they could not say what the difference was. However,\nabout one tenth (11.8%) of the beneficiaries clearly proposed\nthat faith made the difference.\nOn the Pearson's chi-square test of significance, all the\nassociations between background characteristics as also\nintermediary service experiences variables and perceived\nimplications for self were significant. Similarly on the\nPearson's chi-square test of significance of association, all\nthe associations between the background variables, service\nexperience variables, and perceived implications\nfor society were significant.

However, in\nall the three regression models, the coefficient of variance for\nregression is greater than 10%, and hence they are not useful\nfor prediction purposes.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIFBOs' beneficiary respondents of the study aligned to a\nrange of programs, the core ones being rural development,\necology, health as also livelihood development, and economic\nempowerment projects. Residential services and customized\nprograms also featured on the list. From Wuthnow et al.'s\nfindings (2004), it can be concluded that the\nTable 5. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis for Perceived Implications for Society by Background Characteristics and Intermediary\nVariables (Coefficientsa).\nUnstandardized\ncoefficients\nStandardized\ncoefficients t p\nModel B SE  B SE\naDependent variable: Perceived implications for society.\nrecipients/beneficiary profiles of IFBO services resemble\nthose of general public welfare user profile in terms of finan-\ncial/economic status. However, contrary to global faith-based\norganizations that claim to attract a diverse constituency of\npeople with needs, the IFBOs under study had a different\ntake. Although they claim to cater to a cross-sectional benefi-\nciary group, in reality, the leaning is more toward majoritar-\nian/Hindu preferences. This takes the form of ethnoreligious\nnationalism, which asserts the primacy of Hindu worldview\n(which is the religion of the majority in India) and seeks to\nestablish a Hindu nation based upon conservative interpreta-\ntion of Hindu religious values (Hansen, 2009). Hence, vis-\u00e0-\nvis Putnam's bridging capital, what is probably seen in terms\nof IFBO beneficiary outreach is a selective-exclusive bridg-\ning--cross-sectional in principle but parochial in reality. This\ncould also be due to the faith paraphernalia that generally\naccompanies the service delivery package. Access/service\nattainment then automatically gets restricted to those for\nwhom the accompaniment is palatable (this is assuming that\nin a social service providing scenario with multiple choices,\nrecipients have the agency of informed decision making).\nFaith influence in service delivery and the degree of ben-\neficiaries' familiarity with respective IFBO ideologies and\nteachings of the charismatic guru shows the faith-embedded-\nness of IFBOs' service. Faith-embeddedness refers to the\nfact that all social service activities of these IFBOs have a\nstrong and ingrained component of faith in them. The idea is\nto bring faith in the public forum beyond rituals and toward\na community orientation (Isaac, 2003). This is what then the\nbeneficiaries tended to identify as an anchor. Sacredness as\npermeating into varied aspects of the social--diffusing but\nnever diminishing, becomes the operational protocol\n(McCorkle, Bohn, Hughes, & Kim, 2005). Although the\ncomprehension of IFBOs' social services is within certain\ncultural\u00adsocial\u00adeconomic\u00adpolitical contexts (see Bertrand,\n2005; Johnsdotter, Ingvarsdotter, \u00d6stman, & Carlbom,\n2011), faith revivifies the service story (see also Gilbert,\nse has an unblemished, puritan overtone with the modus ope-\nrandi belying a secularist feel, components of the IFBOs'\ncharacters seep into the beneficiary consciousness as well\n(see E. Wood, Watson, & Hayter, 2011). One of the ways this\nhappens is the recognition and acceptance of religiosity/spir-\nituality as an important psychosocial variable (see also\nPargament, Murray-Swank, & Tarakeshwar, 2005; Pesut,\nThis religiosity/spirituality, in relation to the \"beneficiary\nself,\" leads to virtue and cultural development (see also\nThe fourfold beneficiaries' perceived implications of self\ncan be grouped as (a) functional need fulfillment, (b) self-\nenhancement and actualization, (c) communitas develop-\nment, and (c) faith-embeddedness. Functional need\nfulfillment is generally seen as enhancing the quality of life,\nproviding social support and aiding coping and adjustment\nefforts, that is, sociocultural adaptation (see also Ai, Tice,\nTable 6. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis for Perceived Difference Vis-\u00e0-Vis Other Social Initiatives by Background Characteristics\nand Intermediary Variables (Coefficientsa).\nUnstandardized\ncoefficients\nStandardized\ncoefficients t p\nModel B SE  B SE\naDependent variable: Difference vis-\u00e0-vis other social initiatives.\nand actualization is viewed as a processual focus on con-\nsciousness--transcending the ego and cultivating an image\nof God in the psyche. A dual emphasis is thus placed on the\ntotality of the conscious and unconscious mind; and God\nimage as an object relational concept tending toward the\ndivine (see alsoAird, Scott, McGrath, Najman, &Al Mamun,\n2010; Schaap-Jonker, Eurelings-Bontekoe, Verhagen, &\nSweet (1999), it can be said that IFBOs mediate a mindful-\nness among the beneficiaries--of the faith orientation and\nthe charismatic guru. Most of them who are aware and famil-\niar with the teachings and IFBO vision\u00admission valorize\nthem and align to them--consciously and unconsciously.\nThere develops, among the beneficiary subset, a trajectory of\nrelational and contextual reasoning entailing recognition,\nreconciliation, and transcendence of contradiction (Blakeney,\nBlakeney, & Reich, 2005) toward a spiritual awakening of\nsorts. The beneficiary self is deemed to then move from an\nexistential split to a recovered integrity facilitated by the\nIFBOs (see also Tarakeshwar, Hansen, Kochman, &\nSikkema, 2005). Communitas development entails a subjec-\ntive social support through the faith-based program partici-\npation (see also Dulin, 2005). Faith-embeddedness is a\nmanifestation of salience and practice frequency and belief\nin the remedial capacities of divine intervention--something\nthat emerges out of faith-based program affiliation (see also\nFor IFBOs, the mandate is to bring faith back into the pub-\nlic realm. The service ideology is mediated actively by reli-\ngious\u00adcivil practices combining philanthropy and rituals.\nNorms of community organizing around the faith principle\nare created. Hence, in mapping the beneficiary contours of\nIFBOs, what also emerges is that apart from service provision\nand material need fulfillment, the mandate of ideational/ideo-\nlogical proliferation persists. Hence the social capital forma-\ntion and social outreach through the social service exercise\ndoes get colored to some extent with the \"faith agenda\" of the\nIFBOs. In the complexity of the fabric with the \"push of\nIFBO faith\" and the \"pull of larger socioeconomic needs,\"\ndrawing boundaries of mandate and determining the \"best fit\"\nservice package that does not impinge too hard ideationally\non the beneficiaries' belief systems remains a challenge.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research and/or authorship of this article: The author acknowl-\nedges the financial support received from Indian Council of Social\nScience Research (ICSSR), New Delhi, India, under the General\nPostdoctoral Fellowship, 2010, for the study, a part of which has\nbeen presented in this article.\nReferences\nAi, A.
