The article begins by\nintroducing two global initiatives, the Decade of Vaccines\nWorld Health Organization [WHO], 2012). The global initia-\ntives invite countries around the world to collectively con-\ntribute to immunization solutions to protect child health.\nNext, the Canadian publicly funded immunization approach\nis reviewed, along with two key practice guidelines. Three\nkey Canadian immunization competencies for health profes-\nsionals are then highlighted: communication with parents,\nincluding those who are experiencing vaccine hesitancy;\nadministration of immunizing agents; and documentation of\nimmunizations. The selected literature review informs the\nanalysis of the three immunization competencies. In conclu-\nsion, Canadian health professionals are encouraged to con-\nsider Canadian practice guidelines and scholarly evidence to\nensure evidence-informed immunization competencies are\ndeveloped that will protect child health in their home\ncommunities.\nThe selected literature review focuses on meta-analyses\nfrom the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search\nterms included communicating with parents about immuni-\nzations, vaccine hesitancy, administering child immuniza-\ntions, and documenting immunizations. Four meta-analyses\nwere identified. Additional select literature is included. As is\nwidespread in the literature, the terms vaccination and immu-\nnization are used interchangeably in this article, while\nacknowledging there are subtle differences (Kaufman et al.,\n2013). According to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC, 2012), vaccination refers to the injection\nof a weakened or killed disease organism to stimulate a pro-\ntective response and prevent future disease. Immunization\nrefers to a protective response process in a person that pro-\ntects them from a specific disease with immunizing agents\nWorld Health: Decade of Vaccines and\nGlobal Vaccine Action Plan\nas the \"Decade of Vaccines\" with a target of saving the lives\nof two million children (WHO, United Nations International\nChildren's Emergency Fund [UNICEF], & World Bank,\nannounced their support for the Decade of Vaccines at the\nWorld Economic Forum (Rappuoli, Mandl, Black, & De\nthe discovery, development, and delivery of vaccines to the\n1University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2Public Health Ontario, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nGeraldine Jody Macdonald, Senior Lecturer, Bloomberg Faculty of\nNursing, University of Toronto, 155 College St. Rm 162, Toronto,\nEmail: g.macdonald@utoronto.ca\nImmunizing Children: Current Canadian\nHealth Professional Competencies\nGeraldine Jody Macdonald1, Margaret A.

Other key collaborators included Global Alliance for\nVaccines and Immunization Alliance, WHO, U.S. National\nInstitute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, UNICEF, and\nthe African Leaders Malaria Alliance (WHO, 2012).\nThe GVAP (WHO, 2012) was subsequently adopted by\nthe WHO as a strategy to promote global health through vac-\ncinations. The GVAP builds on a prior global initiative that\ncreated ongoing collaborations between diverse arrays of\nstakeholders involved with immunizations (WHO, 2012).\nCollaborators include public and private sectors, manufac-\nturers and academics, civil society, and the media (WHO,\n2012). Key goals of the GVAP include meeting vaccine cov-\nerage targets worldwide, elimination of poliomyelitis, and\nreduction of child mortality (WHO, 2012; WHO, UNICEF,\nSix core principles guide the GVAP beginning with coun-\ntry ownership (WHO, 2012). Each country must take full\nresponsibility for developing and funding effective immuni-\nzation programs for all citizens. This will guide their contri-\nbution to the global \"Decade of Vaccines.\" Five additional\nguiding principles include shared responsibility between all\nstakeholders, equitable access to immunizations, integration\nof the immunization programs within the primary health care\nsystem, guarantee of sustainability of the immunization pro-\ngram, and support for innovation that will ensure ongoing\nquality improvement (WHO, 2012). Detailed goals, mea-\nsures of success, and objectives direct global/local imple-\nmentation of the GVAP (WHO, 2012). In Canada, health\nprofessionals contribute to child health through administer-\ning publicly funded immunizations.\nA Canadian Perspective: Publicly\nFunded Immunization\nCanada has a publicly funded health care system, although\nhealth care is the responsibility of the 10 provinces and three\nterritories. There are a few exceptions such as health care for\nFirst Nations and Inuit in Canada. First Nations and Inuit\nhealth care involves an intricate, inter-reliant health system\nthat is managed by First Nations and Inuit, federal, provin-\ncial, and territorial jurisdictions (Health Canada, 2012).\nCanada does not have a national immunization program.\nIn 2003, Canada adopted a National Immunization Strategy\n(NIS; Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], 2009). The\nNIS promotes the effectiveness and efficiency of immuniza-\ntion programs in Canada. Collaboration with federal, provin-\ncial, territorial, and other partners is essential. Childhood\nimmunization programs are publicly funded across Canada\nand delivered by a combination of public health profession-\nals and primary care practitioners. The NIS also identifies\n\"Immunization Competencies for Health Professionals\" to\nensure Canadians are optimally protected from vaccine-pre-\nCanada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization\n[NACI], a committee of experts, produces evidence-based\nnational immunization guidelines (Erickson, DeWals, &\nFarand, 2005). Individual provinces and territories decide\nwhich vaccine programs they will include in their publicly\nfunded immunization schedules. Health professionals need\nto keep up-to-date with their current provincial/territorial\nimmunization schedule.\nIn December 2012, \"The Canadian Immunization Guide\n(CIG)\u00adEvergreen Edition\" (NACI & PHAC, 2012) was\nlaunched. The CIG\u00adEvergreen Edition is an innovative,\nonline, best practices resource that provides up-to-date infor-\nmation that is readily available. The CIG\u00adEvergreen Edition\nis updated regularly by PHAC (2011) and, within it, specific\nprovincial/territorial immunization schedules can be\naccessed by health care professionals and parents. Canada's\nNACI reviews vaccine research on an ongoing basis to\nensure the national immunization guidelines are based on the\nbest available evidence.\nCanadian children who receive their publicly funded vac-\ncine series in infancy and childhood are protected from diph-\ntheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, Haemophilus influenzae\nType b (Hib), pneumococcal disease (childhood immuniza-\ntion protects against 13 of the most common serotypes of\npneumococcal disease), measles, mumps, rubella, and\nHepatitis B. All provinces and territories offer vaccines to\nprevent meningococcal serogroup C. Many provinces and\nterritories provide protection from four different meningo-\ncoccal serogroups, via the quadrivalent vaccine ACYW-135,\nin late childhood or early adolescence (PHAC, 2014). All\nprovinces and territories have single-dose varicella immuni-\nzation programs and currently, eight provinces have added a\nsecond dose for better varicella protection. Since 2011, five\nprovinces and two territories added rotavirus oral vaccine to\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine was approved in\nthrough school-based programs. Males do not have access to\npublicly funded HPV vaccine in Canada, with two excep-\ntions. Prince Edward Island expanded its HPV vaccine pro-\ngram to include males this past school year (PHAC, 2014).\nAlberta announced plans to include males in the upcoming\nschool year, beginning September 2014 (Alberta Health,\n2014). Advocating for access to publicly funded vaccines is\nan important role for Canadian health professionals.\nCanadian Health Professional\nCompetencies\nCanadian health professionals who immunize children are\nguided by the Canadian immunization competencies for\nhealth professionals (PHAC, 2009). Developing and main-\ntaining health professional immunization competencies link\nto the GVAP principle of promoting innovation and quality\nMacdonald et al. 3\nimprovement. Three immunization competencies are of par-\nticular interest to health professionals at this moment in time:\ncommunication with parents, including those who are expe-\nriencing vaccine hesitancy; administration of immunizing\nagents; and documentation of immunizations. The three\ncompetencies are addressed in this article by creating an\nanalysis of best practices based on the Immunization\nCompetencies for Health Professionals (PHAC, 2009), the\nCanadian Immunization Guide (NACI & PHAC, 2012), and\nfour meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of\nSystematic Reviews. Meta-analyses identify the best quality\nof scholarly evidence available. A number of additional arti-\ncles are integrated into this analysis including systematic lit-\nerature reviews, concepts/definitions, and emerging\ninnovative approaches of particular value that were known to\nthe authors.\nCommunication With Parents\nHealth professionals have an important role communicating\nwith parents about their children's vaccinations. Health pro-\nfessionals are aligned with the GVAP when dialoguing with\nparents about vaccine-preventable diseases in prenatal set-\ntings, well child visits, hospital settings, schools, daycares,\nhomes, workplaces, faith communities, and telephone hot\nlines. Ideally, parents are engaged partners in decisions\nregarding the health care of their children and they feel com-\nfortable bringing questions and concerns about immuniza-\ntions forward to health professionals (Austvoll-Dahlgren &\nHealth professionals who are aware of the influences of\nthe social determinants of health on parents'vaccine decision\nmaking will be in a position to offer supportive advice and to\nanticipate barriers to vaccination. Despite having a publicly\nfunded health care system, barriers remain in Canada.\nBarriers may include the lack of funds for transportation to\nthe clinics or an inability to take time off of work to bring\ntheir children to the clinic to receive publicly funded vacci-\nnations. Advocating with decision makers for resources for\nparents such as bus tickets or evening clinics will support\nboth vulnerable parents/families and the goals of the WHO's\n\"Decade of Vaccines.\" Such interventions link to Primary\nHealth Care [PHC] principles of health promotion, public\nparticipation, and appropriate technology and the PHC val-\nues of social justice and equity (Smith, Van Herk, &\nHowever, health professionals have more to learn about\nhow to be effective in their key role of communicating with\nparents about vaccinations. Kaufman et al. (2013) published\na Cochrane meta-analysis as one part of a 2-year multi-stage,\nglobal research project called \"communicate to vaccinate\"\n(Kaufman et al., 2013). The \"communicate to vaccinate\"\nglobal research project focuses on improving vaccine cover-\nage by systematically developing new knowledge and under-\nstanding about effective communication interventions in low\nand middle income countries (Kaufman et al., 2013).\nKaufman et al.'s (2013) meta-analysis is titled \"Face to face\ninterventions for informing or educating parents about early\nchildhood vaccinations.\" Face to face offers parents/consum-\ners an opportunity to talk with health care professionals in\neither one-to-one or group settings that facilitate questions\nand sharing of concerns and/or preferences (Kaufman et al.,\nThe authors began their review with a thorough search\nstrategy that yielded more than 9,000 articles (Kaufman et\nal., 2013). They ended up including just seven trials, six ran-\ndomized control trials [RCTs], and one cluster RCT in their\nanalysis (Kaufman et al., 2013). The combined seven trials\nies had high heterogeneity, which restricted the authors'abil-\nity to consider them together. While several studies found\nlimited positive responses to face to face interventions, col-\nlectively they did not.\nAs the authors state, \"The limited evidence available is\nlow quality and suggests that face to face interventions to\ninform or educate parents about childhood vaccination have\nlittle to no impact on immunization status, or knowledge or\nThere was not enough evidence, however, to suggest a\nchange in current face to face practices despite the lack of\naffirming data. Future research is recommended to determine\neffective face to face communication interventions (Kaufman\nA related study is underway, also part of the 2-year \"com-\nmunicate to vaccinate\" global research project (Kaufman,\n2013). This systematic review is titled, \"Community-directed\ninterventions informing and/or educating about early child-\nhood vaccination\" (Saeterdal, 2012, p. 1). Community inter-\nventions target populations or local community groups while\nface to face interventions target individuals. The meta-analy-\nsis is in protocol stage and the results are not yet available.\nThe findings will contribute a valuable perspective on the\neffectiveness of community interventions in communicating\nabout childhood immunizations, specifically linking knowl-\nedge and vaccination uptake.\nprovides vital insight into the potential significance of social\nnetworks in influencing first-time parental vaccine deci-\nsions. An imaginative social networking analysis was used to\nexamine how conforming and nonconforming first-time par-\nents used social networks, including the people and the\nsources they consult for guidance and information (Brunson,\n2013). Social relationships, including \"spouses/partners,\nwere found to have the most influence on first-time parent\nvaccine decision making. Brunson (2013) names these \"peo-\nple networks\" (p. 1399) and found \"people networks\" also\ninclude peers at work, parenting educators, and health\nprofessionals.\nThe most predictive factor in Brunson's (2013) study was,\nparadoxically, identified as first-time parents whose people\nnetworks advocated for nonconformity. First-time parents\n4 SAGE Open\nwho were advised not to follow recommended vaccination\nschedules by trusted family, partners, and friends were most\nlikely to be influenced by this advice, even if the advice chal-\nlenged personal perceptions (Brunson, 2013). Brunson\n(2013) concluded that social networks, particularly people\nnetworks, play a key role in shaping vaccine decisions for\nfirst-time parents. People networks were found to be more\ninfluential than source networks including television, celeb-\nrity reports, and social media via online sources (Brunson,\n2013). Future research is recommended to focus on commu-\nnity interventions that reach the diverse people whom par-\nents are most likely to consult prior to vaccine decision\nBrunson's (2013) study highlights the importance of\nhealth professionals engaging with first-time parents, becom-\ning part of their \"people networks,\" taking time to listen to\nparents' concerns and preferences, and exploring what par-\nents' \"people networks\" have advised them to do. Through\nforming trusting relationships with first-time parents, health\nprofessionals will have the opportunity to positively influ-\nence their decision making about child immunizations.\nAdditional research about the influence of social and \"people\nnetworks\" on parents with multiple children would provide\nvaluable guidance for health professionals who are hoping to\ninfluence experienced parents to make informed vaccine\ndecisions. Community social network intervention research\nmay offer an important approach as it has the potential to\nincrease awareness of people networks within an entire\ncommunity.\nCommunicating with parents who are vaccine hesitant.An\nemerging challenge for health professionals is communicat-\ning with parents who are reluctant to immunize their chil-\ndren. Although the concept is not new, vaccine hesitancy is a\nrelatively recent term that identifies less than ideal vaccine\nacceptance in a population despite accessible vaccination\nprograms (Larson, 2013). Another definition focuses on con-\nfidence, complacency, and convenience, as evidenced by the\nfollowing quote:\nVaccine hesitancy is a behavior, influenced by a number of\nfactors including issues of confidence (do not trust vaccine or\nprovider), complacency (do not perceive a need for a vaccine, do\nnot value the vaccine), and convenience (access). (WHO, 2013,\nEisenstein (2014), a journalist, insightfully suggests that\nparents are expected to give their child injections with bio-\nlogical matter that most people do not understand and pre-\nvent diseases that they have never seen, which can create a\nsense of hesitancy. Parents may be worried about potential\nside effects of vaccines, including minor swelling and, rarely,\nseizures and anaphylaxis (Eisenstein, 2014). They may also\nhave been scared by myths that are still circulating, such as\nthe discredited claim of a link between autism and measles\nmumps rubella vaccine known as MMR vaccination\n(Eisenstein, 2014).At the same time, parents may be unaware\nof the threat to their child's health from vaccine-preventable\ndiseases. Threats may include living through a serious illness\nsuch as pertussis/whooping cough, lifelong complications\nsuch as amputations, and even death (Eisenstein, 2014;\nRenowned photographer Anna Geddes (2014) released an\ne-book titled Protecting Our Tomorrows: Portraits of\nMeningococcal Disease, which includes haunting, posed\nphotographs of physical losses related to meningococcal dis-\nease. The images are supplemented by distressing yet resil-\nient stories shared by these survivors of meningococcal\ninfections. To view the images, press control and click on the\nfollowing link: http://protectingourtomorrows.tumblr.com\nGeddes's (2014) e-book highlights tragic complications\nrelated to meningococcal infection. The impact of this book\nis uncertain, but it is powerful and memorable. Anna Geddes\n(2014) hopes that her art will help parents recognize the\nvalue of immunizing their children and avoiding the heart-\nache that survivors and their families have endured. Research\nto study the impact of Geddes's (2014) approach would con-\ntribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of the arts in\ncommunicating with parents about the value of\nimmunization.\nSadaf, Richards, Glanz, Salmon, and Omer (2013) com-\npleted a Cochrane meta-analysis of interventions to reduce\nvaccine refusal and hesitancy including parent education,\nvaccine exemption policies, and state laws. Thirty studies\nwere reviewed. The authors concluded that there was a lack\nof strong evidence on effective interventions to reduce paren-\ntal refusal or hesitancy and recommended future research\n(Sadaf et al., 2013). The lack of strong evidence on effective\ninterventions to guide practice with hesitant parents is chal-\nlenging for health professionals.\nThe Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) is the\nprincipal advisory group to the WHO for vaccines and immu-\nnization. There is an earnestness to address vaccine hesitancy\nbecause the anticipated achievements of the \"Decade of\nVaccines\" and the \"GVAP\" cannot be realized without the\nco-operation of the global community of parents, as well as\nprofessionals, and organizations (WHO, 2012; WHO,\nUNICEF, & World Bank, 2009). SAGE recently completed a\nliterature review on vaccine hesitancy. This literature review\nassociates vaccine hesitancy with a complex set of factors,\nrelationships, and priorities (SAGE Working Group on\nVaccine Hesitancy 2013). To connect to the review, press\ncontrol and click on the following link: http://www.who.int/\nimmunization/sage/meetings/2013/april/2_Systematic-lit_\nReview.pdf . This literature review offers insights into hesi-\ntant parents that are of value to health professionals.\nConfidence in vaccines falls on a continuum from com-\nplete refusal to complete trust in the safety of vaccines and\nthe vaccine delivery system (SAGE Working Group on\nVaccine Hesitancy, 2013). Lack of confidence in vaccines\nMacdonald et al. 5\ncan result in total refusal, delay, or selective acceptance of\nchildhood vaccinations (SAGE Working Group on Vaccine\nHesitant Parents,\" Macdonald and Finlay (2013) suggest that\nmotivational interviewing and directed evidence-based\ninformation are most helpful in developing a working rela-\ntionship with hesitant parents. The NIS goals incorporate\nprofessional and public acceptance of vaccination programs\nas well as reassurance that optimal safety and effectiveness\nstrengthen confidence resulting in vaccine acceptance.\nVaccine complacency happens when parents are unable to\ndefine or recognize the risk of their child contracting a vac-\ncine-preventable disease (SAGE Working Group on Vaccine\nparental vaccination experience as it relates to ease of access\nand comfort (WHO, 2013). Time, place, comfort, and afford-\nability are all considerations for vaccine programs. The\nCIG\u00adEvergreen Edition (NACI & PHAC, 2012) notes that\npain and anxiety related to the injection are determinants of\nvaccine hesitancy. Health care providers have an important\nrole in addressing parental and child concerns.\nParental concerns about vaccinations for healthy children\nare different from parental concerns related to health care for\na child suffering from an illness or a condition (NACI &\nPHAC, 2012). Despite their overall positive uptake at a com-\nmunity level, 40% of Canadian parents surveyed express\nfears related to the safety of vaccines for their children\n(PHAC, 2011). Parents expect to understand the risks and\nbenefits associated with vaccinations, prior to making an\ninformed choice (Dube et al., 2013; Hagood & Herlithy,\nincreases confidence and is an important role for all health\ncare professionals, not just for health professionals who actu-\nally vaccinate children. It will take a collective effort to\nensure Canadians continue to enjoy positive child health out-\ncomes related to vaccination programs (Hagood & Herlithy,\nOpen and supportive communication between health pro-\nfessionals and parents is a key strategy to promote informed\nparental choices about childhood immunization (Austvoll-\nDahlgren & Helseth, 2010). Health professionals need to\ndevelop an excellent knowledge base to be able to skillfully\nfacilitate parents' learning about the complexity of child\nimmunizations, and they need to engage in a parent-centered\napproach (NACI & PHAC, 2012). This dialogue should\ninclude building on current client knowledge and referring to\nreputable websites for vaccine-preventable diseases\n(Austvoll-Dahlgren & Helseth, 2010; NACI & PHAC,\nAccurate evidence presented within a client-centered rela-\ntionship is currently identified as the most supportive\napproachtowork withthevaccine-hesitantparent(Macdonald\noften worry about the total number of vaccines their children\nreceive, through childhood immunizations. Taking the time to\nlisten to parents' concerns and clarify the science underlying\nimmunizations is an important health professional role. When\nparents learn that in the 1980s, 3 childhood immunizations\nexposed children to 3,044 antigens, while today, prevention\nagainst 16 diseases, via 14 vaccinations, exposes children to\nmake a more informed choice about vaccinating their\nchildren.\nParents today readily access the Internet and are able to\nlocate research articles, without necessarily having the skills\nto critically appraise the value of the research. They also hear\nhealth news via television and social media, which may\nreport on a new research study or a concerning experience\nrelated to vaccinations. Health professionals utilize commu-\nnication skills to discuss parental concerns that arise from\nsocial media, media, and published research. For instance, if\nparents read about a new vaccine for pregnant women that\nreduces newborn infection, they may seek advice from\ntrusted health professionals about its value. Health profes-\nsionals can listen to parental concerns, educate parents about\nthe complex process of expert review for new vaccines, and\nclarify whether the new immunization is on the approved\npublic health vaccination schedule.\nHealth professionals are expected to review the scholarly\nliterature and keep up-to-date with new developments so\nthey are ready to respond to questions from parents such as\nthose related to vaccinations in pregnancy. Two of the four\nretrieved Cochrane Collaboration meta-analyses examine\nthe outcomes of immunizing pregnant women against vac-\ncine-preventable diseases to prevent newborn infection.\nChaithongwongwatthana et al. (2012) reviewed pneumococ-\ncal vaccination during pregnancy and concluded that there\nwas inadequate evidence to assess the impact of maternal\nvaccination on infant infections. Currently, the CIG\u00ad\nEvergreen Edition states that pneumococcal vaccine is rec-\nommended for pregnant women with underlying conditions\nmaking them at risk of invasive disease (NACI & PHAC,\nChaithongwongwatthana et al. (2012) suggest that trials\nof neonatal pneumococcal immunization would be of value\nand might eliminate the need for further studies of pneumo-\ncoccal vaccination on pregnant women. A second meta-anal-\nysis by Sangkomkamhang, Lumbiganon, and Laopaiboon\n(2011) found insufficient evidence available to assess the\nimpact of immunizing pregnant women, with Hepatitis B\nvaccine, on infant infection; future RCTs were\nrecommended.\nIt is important that health professionals are up-to-date\nwith both the current scholarship on vaccinations and the\nexperts who guide care in their own health care contexts.\nSome country guidelines recommend pertussis vaccine dur-\ning pregnancy. Currently in Canada, experts do not routinely\nrecommend pertussis vaccine during pregnancy. Pertussis\ncontaining vaccine can be given post partum if the mother is\nnot already vaccinated to help protect the newborn or in\n6 SAGE Open\nparticular situations when benefits outweigh the risks in late\npregnancy (NACI & PHAC, 2012). Understandably, this can\nbe confusing for parents. Health professionals who are pre-\npared to respond to parental questions support the goals of\nthe GVAP.\nAdministration of Immunizing Agents\nPerhaps the biggest shift in immunization practice is the new\nurgency to reduce and manage immunization pain and anxi-\nety in children and youth, including educating parents about\npain management during injection (Taddio et al., 2012). By\nthe time a Canadian child reaches the age of 19 years,\ndepending on provincial/territorial programs, most will have\nreceived up to 26 immunization injections (Laroche & Diniz,\n2012). Research has established that immunization injec-\ntions are the most common reason for iatrogenic or proce-\ndure-induced pain in infants and children (Taddio et al.,\n2010). Pain from the shot or needle puncture has been noted\nas a common barrier to receiving vaccines and can lead to\nnonadherence to vaccine recommendations across the life\nspan, needle avoidance, vaccine hesitancy, and increased\nvaccine-preventable diseases (Taddio et al., 2012).\nAn effective pain management approach improves the\nimmunization experience of children, parents, and the immu-\nnizer, and promotes vaccine program acceptance (Taddio et\nal., 2010). One identified best practice for infants is com-\nbined analgesia, which produces approximately 10 minutes\nof analgesia. Combined anesthesia begins with establishing a\ngood latch and breastfeeding an infant for 1 minute prior to\ninjection, then continuing to breastfeed for several minutes\nfollowing the needle (Taddio et al., 2010). Cuddling, promot-\ning sucking, and a sweet taste work in combination to\nenhance the analgesic effect (Taddio et al., 2010). Other\ninfant analgesic methods advocated by Taddio et al. (2010)\ninclude offering babies unable to breastfeed under 1 year\nbetween 2 and 10 mL of a sugar\u00adwater mixture (one packet\nof sugar dissolved in 10 mL of water) using a small cup, oral\nsyringe, or pacifier.\nOther physical approaches to pain management include\nkeeping babies and children in an upright supported position\nand encouraging parents to cuddle during the injection, a\ncost-free approach to pain reduction (Taddio et al., 2010).\nFor 3-year old children, child led distractions such as blow-\ning bubbles or deep breathing are shown to be helpful. For a\nchild above 4 years, stroking the skin near the injection site\ncreates analgesia for injection (Taddio et al., 2010). Using\ntopical anesthesia creams designed for immunizations and\ngiving the more painful immunization injection last when\nadministering more than one vaccine at a visit are also known\nto provide pain control (Taddio et al., 2010). Advocating for\ngovernment procurement of vaccines, which cause less pain\nthan alternatives, is an important health professional and\npublic health policy role.\nIn the case of school-based childhood vaccination pro-\ngrams, one qualitative study found that participants, girls,\naged between 11 and 12 years, experience fear waiting to be\nvaccinated for HPV in the school (Cooper Robbins, Bernard,\nMcCaffery, & Skinner, 2010). Pain management was more\nreadily accepted when it followed education about the value\nof having the HPV vaccine (Cooper Robbins et al., 2010).\nDistraction methods of pain management such as listening to\nan iPod and peer support during immunization were used\neffectively in this age group (Cooper Robbins et al., 2010).\nHealth professionals are encouraged to integrate client\nfocused pain management techniques when vaccinating.\nStudies on the use of oral analgesics such as acetamino-\nphen, prior to vaccination, have shown no effect on pain at\nthe time of injection (Taddio et al., 2012). In addition, advis-\ning children that the needle will not hurt is ineffective and\nmay undermine a trusting relationship between the child and\nhealth care provider (NACI & PHAC, 2012; Taddio et al.,\nTo administer immunizations safely, health professionals\nneed to follow vaccine product delivery directions and up-to-\ndate immunization guidelines. Aspiration is no longer con-\nsidered a best practice for either subcutaneous or\nintramuscular injections of vaccines and immunization\n(Crawford & Johnson, 2012). There are no research data to\nsupport the use of aspiration, but there is evidence to show\nthat aspiration and slow prolonged injection time cause an\nincrease in pain in children (Crawford & Johnson, 2012;\nTaddio et al., 2010). Current best practices focus on injection\ntechnique, correct needle size, careful land-marking, and\nspeed of injection (Crawford & Johnson, 2012; Ipp, Taddio,\nVaccination administration best practice techniques that\nhealth professionals need to incorporate with subcutaneous\nwith a pinch of skin lifted from the muscle, and a 45\u00b0 angle\ninsertion (NACI & PHAC, 2012). Intramuscular injection\nbest practices include use of a 22- to 25-gauge needle, use of\na needle that is long enough to reach muscle, holding the skin\ntaut and a 90\u00b0 angle needle insertion, in addition to use of the\nvastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) in infants <1 year\nof age, and normally, using the deltoid muscle of anyone 1\nyear of age (NACI & PHAC, 2012). If two injections are\nbeing given, the use of two limbs is advised while for multi-\nple injections, more than one injection can be given in a sin-\ngle limb, as long as there is at least one inch between\ninjections and precise site documentation is completed\nDocumentation of Immunization\nNo meta-analyses were identified that review documenta-\ntion of immunizations. Current best practices are based on\nCanadian practice guidelines. Best practices confirm the\nneed for health professionals to record vaccines accurately\nand completely each time they give a vaccine (NACI &\nPHAC, 2012). The minimum data to be recorded in the cli-\nent's record include the name of the vaccine, the date (day,\nMacdonald et al. 7\nmonth, and year) and route of administration, the anatomical\nsite, the name of the vaccine manufacturer, the lot number,\nand the name and title of the person administering the vac-\ncine (NACI & PHAC, 2012). The completed document pro-\nvides a reference point in the uncommon event of an adverse\nevent following immunization (AEFI; NACI & PHAC,\nIn 2013, the CIG\u00adEvergreen Edition vaccine safety sec-\ntion was updated to further support Canadian practitioners'\nunderstanding of vaccine pharmacovigilance including iden-\ntification and reporting of AEFIs (NACI & PHAC, 2012).\nAn AEFI report includes a detailed description of the event,\nits duration, health care utilization, treatment, and the final\noutcome (NACI & PHAC, 2012). AEFI reports are analyzed\nto monitor vaccine safety and to detect possible vaccine\nsafety signals which may warrant further research, and might\nlead to an action, such as recalling a vaccine lot (NACI &\nPHAC, 2012). While we do not have mandatory reporting of\nAEFIs nationally, laws requiring health professionals to\nreport AEFIs have been enacted in some Canadian provinces\nand territories (Gahunia, Bigham, Konrad, & Snow, 2013).\nComplete and accurate documentation by those vaccinating\ncontributes to timely and thorough reporting of AEFIs and\nreassures the public about immunization safety.\nHealth professionals are encouraged to keep separate or\neasily retrievable summaries of vaccination records to expe-\ndite vaccine eligibility assessment when the client is in the\noffice (NACI & PHAC, 2012). In addition, depending on\nyour province/territory and the child's age, either the health\ncare provider or parent is required to ensure the local public\nhealth system is updated with the recent vaccines received by\nthe child (NACI & PHAC, 2012). This provides data for pub-\nlic health professionals to assess immunization coverage,\nplan and evaluate public health programs, as well as target\nvaccine promotion and programs for families in communi-\nties with lower vaccine coverage rates (NACI & PHAC,\nVaccine registries enable vaccine record keeping, and\nhave wide-ranging benefits. These information software\napplications have the capacity to issue recall/reminders if\noverdue for a vaccine, record immunization events, and\nnotify clients when immunizations are due (Laroche & Diniz,\n2012). At a population level, comprehensive vaccine regis-\ntries are the gold standard for the assessment of vaccine cov-\nerage, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine safety (Laroche &\nDiniz, 2012). The registry can include barcoding of vaccines\nwith a scan function to assist with data accuracy (Laroche &\nDiniz, 2012). An ongoing Canadian goal is to establish a\ncompatible comprehensive national immunization registry\nsimilar to Australia's (Laroche & Diniz, 2012).\nFollowing vaccine administration and recording, health\nprofessionals need to ensure that parents are prepared for\ntheir responsibilities. Health professionals provide each\nchild's parents with a personal copy of their child's vaccina-\ntion record card and remind parents to keep it in a safe place\nand have it updated whenever their child receives a vaccine\n(NACI & PHAC, 2012). Parents need to know that they are\nresponsible for providing a photocopy of the record when\nrequested for school entrance, camp enrolment, and other\nregistrations. Promoting safe keeping of and accurate child\nhealth records remains a challenge in Canada. Laroche and\nzation records, 15% report incomplete records, and 24% of\nrecords contain data entry errors. Technology may offer an\nimproved opportunity for parental record keeping.\nRecently, the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (2012)\ndeveloped a smart phone application (app) for recording\nimmunizations and reminding parents when the next vaccine\nis due. The iPhone app, \"ImmunizeON,\" was introduced in\nOntario for infants born after August, 2011. This new tech-\nnology is a welcome alternative to the traditional yellow\ncard, appealing to young parents who are technologically\nsavvy and utilize smart phone apps in many aspects of their\nlives. Parents have access to timely, reliable vaccine infor-\nmation, they are advised when immunizations are due, and\ntheir child's immunization status is tracked onto an elec-\ntronic yellow immunization card (Ottawa Hospital Research\nInstitute, 2012). This app has recently been released by\nImmunize Canada and is available for parents to use across\nCanada. The ImmunizeCA app is free and can be down-\nloaded from iTunes, GooglePlay, or BlackBerry World via\nhttp://www.immunize.ca/en/app.aspx\nCompleting an individual immunization record after each\nchild vaccine is administered will produce a record of all the\nvaccines a person has in infancy, childhood, and adoles-\ncence. This documentation contributes to health care\nthroughout the life span. For instance, a young adult present-\ning for medical care with symptoms of measles would be\nassessed based on his or her clinical, travel, and vaccination\nhistory. They would carry a lower index of suspicion if they\nhad received the recommended schedule of measles vaccina-\ntions. The efficacy of vaccination with two doses of MMR\nvaccine after the first birthday approaches 100% protection\nfrom measles infection (NACI & PHAC, 2012). In addition\nto vaccination status, the client assessment would include\nepidemiological links to confirmed measles cases, travel to\nmeasles endemic areas, and presenting symptoms.\nAnother instance where the lifetime vaccine record is\nneeded follows acceptance of employment in a health care\nsetting. These data ensure the health worker is protected\nfrom vaccine-preventable diseases at work and prevent the\nneed for costly reimmunizing or laboratory blood testing as\nproof of immunity for employment purposes.\nConclusion\nCanadian health professionals are encouraged to reflect on\nimmunization competencies and ensure evidence-based\npractices underpin vaccine delivery in their primary care set-\ntings. Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed through effective\n8 SAGE Open\ncommunication, including evidence-based discussion about\nvaccinations. Health professionals who communicate about\nimmunization using parent-centered approaches, provide\nchildren with adequate pain management when administer-\ning vaccinations, and rigorously document each vaccination,\nplay a key role in protecting child health in their communi-\nties. New research on effective approaches to respond to\nparental concerns and reduce vaccine refusal and hesitancy is\nneeded to increase vaccine acceptance in the future.\nCanadian health professionals contribute to achieving the\nvision of the WHO's \"Decade of Vaccines\" and GVAP by\nimmunizing Canadian children. Health professionals in other\ncountries contribute to the WHO's \"Decade of Vaccines\" and\nGVAP by immunizing children in their home countries.\nCollectively, we are protecting the health of the world's\nchildren.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlberta Health.
