Service trade has consistently grown at higher\nrates than goods trade and, today, commercial services account for roughly 20% of the total\nThis paper argues that the rise in international service trade cannot be fully understood\nwithout accounting for the role of tax havens: jurisdictions with extremely low e\u00a4ective tax\nrates often combined with low regulatory standards and legal institutions facilitating secrecy.\nWe substantiate this claim by showing that in all the OECD countries, for which a bilateral\nbreakdown of service trade \nows is available, the share of trade that is conducted with tax havens\nis substantially higher for services than for goods. Simple gravity models of aggregate trade\n\nows show that service trade with tax havens is around 6 times larger than with comparable\ncountries that are not tax havens whereas no such di\u00a4erence exists in goods trade.\nA priori there are at least two plausible explanations for the striking role of tax havens\nin international service trade. First, the speci...c institutions developed by tax havens may\ncreate a comparative advantage in services. For instance, bank secrecy and tax exemption\nof investment funds have spurred the development of a large ...nancial sector in Luxembourg,\nwhich trades a wide range of services on the global ...nancial market. Ship management on\nCyprus and reinsurance on Bermuda are other examples of genuine and highly specialized\nservice industries that have emerged in response to the tax and regulatory incentives o\u00a4ered\nby tax havens. Second, service trade may serve as a tax evasion strategy for multinational\n...rms. When tax haven entities sell overpriced services to a\u00a2 liated entities elsewhere, taxable\npro...ts are e\u00a4ectively shifted to tax havens with low or no taxation, which reduces the ...rm'\ns\nglobal tax bill. Anecdotally, multinational ...rms are known to operate tax haven entities such as\n\"patent boxes\" that own intellectual property and collect royalties and license fees from a\u00a2 liates;\n\"captive insurance companies\" that insure the risks of a\u00a2 liates in exchange for insurance fees;\nand \"headquarters\" that assist a\u00a2 liates with management, administration or advertising against\nservice fees. These transactions are all classi...ed as service trade in international trade statistics,\nbut typically have no or little real substance and serve no other purpose than tax evasion.\nThe rest of the paper explores the nature of the service trade with tax havens: does it re\nect\nreal agglomerations of service industries in tax havens or tax evasion by multinational ...rms?\nOur empirical strategy involves two steps. First, we break down the \"excess\" service trade with\ntax havens into trade between unrelated parties, which must re\nect genuine specialization in\nservice industries, and trade between related parties, which may re\nect tax-motivated pro...t\nshifting. Second, we study whether tax haven entities selling services to a\u00a2 liates exhibit \"ex-\ncess\" pro...tability, which would indicate that these transactions involve an element of pro...t\nshifting.\nTo conduct this analysis, it is necessary to go beyond aggregate trade statistics. Therefore,\nwe combine two German data sources to construct a ...rm-level dataset that contains information\nabout service trade as well as foreign direct investment. For each German ...rm, we observe the\nvalue of its service imports and exports by foreign counterpart country and service category as\nwell as the location and basic characteristics of its foreign a\u00a2 liates.\nOur baseline regression model explains the extensive margins of service trade with the fol-\nlowing three key variables: a dummy indicating whether the partner country in question is a tax\nhaven; a dummy indicating whether the ...rm in question has an a\u00a2 liate in the partner country;\nand the interaction between the tax haven and a\u00a2 liate dummies. In addition, we include stan-\ndard gravity controls as well as ...rm ...xed e\u00a4ects that absorb all ...rm-level determinants of trade\nsuch as ...rm age, size and sector. The tax haven dummy measures the probability of a German\n...rm trading with a haven in which it has no a\u00a2 liates over and above the probability of trading\nwith an otherwise similar non-tax haven in which it has no a\u00a2 liates; a measure of excess trade\nwith unrelated parties in tax havens. The interaction between the tax haven and subsidiary\ndummies measures the probability of a German ...rm trading with a tax haven in which it has\nan a\u00a2 liate over and above the probability of trading with an otherwise similar non-tax haven\nin which it has an a\u00a2 liate; a measure of excess trade with a\u00a2 liates in tax havens.\nWe ...nd strong evidence of excess trade with unrelated parties in tax havens across vir-\ntually all service categories. The excess probability that a given ...rm imports from a given\ntax haven where it has no a\u00a2 liates is between 0.1 and 1 percentage point depending on the\nservice category. Precisely because this ...nding applies to trade between unrelated parties, it\nimplies that tax havens sell more genuine services on the world market than can be explained\nby their fundamental economic and geographical characteristics, which we interpret as evidence\nof specialization in services. The excess probability that a ...rm exports to a tax haven where it\nhas no a\u00a2 liates is between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage points. This ...nding plausibly re\nects that\nservice agglomerations in tax havens rely on service inputs from foreign providers; for instance,\nLuxembourg banks may acquire ...nancial services on the world market just like Cypriot ship-\nping companies buy shipping-related services and Bermuda reinsurance companies purchase\ninsurance-related services from unrelated ...rms abroad.\nMoreover, for certain service categories often anecdotally associated with tax evasion, we\n...nd positive excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens, but negative excess exports. For ex-\nample, if a ...rm has an a\u00a2 liate in a foreign country, the probability of observing trade \nows\nrelated to intellectual property between the ...rm and the foreign country generally increases by\naround 5 percentage points for both imports and exports. However, if the foreign country is\na tax haven, the e\u00a4ect on imports is around 7.5 percentage points and the e\u00a4ect on exports\nonly around 2.5 percentage points. We ...nd evidence of positive excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in\ntax havens combined with negative excess exports in four major service categories: intellectual\nproperty (such as services related to patents and trademarks), headquarter services (such as ad-\nministration and management), information services and sea transport. The ...rst two categories\nare often considered to be especially prone to transfer mispricing because of the di\u00a2 culty of\nestablishing market prices for such services (e.g. OECD, 2013) while the latter is closely linked\nto tax havens by the extensive use of \nags of convenience.\nThe ...nding that a\u00a2 liate trade with tax havens is heavily skewed towards imports is clearly\nconsistent with pro...t shifting. It is precisely the pattern that should be expected if multinational\n...rms operate tax haven entities serving solely to sell mispriced or even purely ...ctitious services\nto a\u00a2 liates. However, the ...nding could also, in principle, re\nect that multinational ...rms\nallocate a disproportionate share of their genuine service production to a\u00a2 liates in tax havens\nwhile trading services internally at market prices. We therefore go beyond the analysis of trade\npatterns and study the pro...tability of foreign a\u00a2 liates directly.\nOur methodology e\u00a4ectively compares entities belonging to the same ...rm and selling the\nsame service to their German a\u00a2 liates. We ...nd that for certain service categories, notably\nintellectual property, headquarter services and sea transport where a\u00a2 liate trade with tax havens\nis signi...cantly skewed toward imports, tax haven a\u00a2 liates earn signi...cantly higher pro...ts than\nnon-haven a\u00a2 liates. The excess return of tax haven a\u00a2 liates is between 4 and 8 percentage\npoints depending on the service category, which compares to normal returns between 10 and\n15 percent in the comparison group of non-haven a\u00a2 liates. Relatedly, we show that patterns in\nservice trade correlate strongly with the intra-...rm allocation of pro...ts. Speci...cally, ...rms with\nless than 20% of total service imports coming from tax havens typically allocate below 30%\nof their foreign pro...ts to tax havens whereas ...rms importing 50% or more from tax havens\nallocate around 50% of their foreign pro...ts to tax havens. These results suggest that some\na\u00a2 liate trade is mispriced and has an economically signi...cant e\u00a4ect on the global allocation of\npro...ts within multinational ...rms.\nFinally, we present suggestive evidence that service trade between German ...rms and their\ntax haven a\u00a2 liates is funneled through entities in third countries; in particular the Netherlands,\nwhich has been identi...ed by other studies as the conduit country typically used by German\n...rms for holding purposes (e.g. Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010). Speci...cally, we show that\nexcess probabilities of imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates in service categories such as intellectual\nproperty and headquarter services are signi...cantly lower for German ...rms that have an a\u00a2 l-\niate in the Netherlands. This is consistent with services \nowing from tax havens through the\nNetherlands to Germany, which decreases observed imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates, but only\nfor ...rms that have an a\u00a2 liate in the Netherlands. The conduit trade may serve to circumvent\nwithholding taxes or other anti-avoidance measures that apply only to transactions with tax\nThe paper adds to a large literature studying how multinational ...rms shift pro...ts between\njurisdictions with the aim of reducing their global tax bill. A number of papers show that the\ntransformation of productive inputs into taxable pro...ts by multinational ...rms correlates with\ntax rates in ways that are suggestive of tax motivated pro...t shifting (e.g. Hines and Rice, 1994;\nHuizinga and Laeven, 2008). Other papers study the distinct channels through which pro...ts are\nshifted such as mispricing of goods traded inside the ...rm (e.g. Clausing, 2003; Bernard, Jensen\nand Schott, 2008; Christea and Nguyen, 2015); the allocation of debt within the ...rm (e.g. Desai,\nFoley and Hines, 2004; Huizinga, Laeven and Nicodeme, 2008); and the allocation of patents\nand other intangible assets within the ...rm (e.g. Dieschinger and Riedel, 2011; Karkinsky and\nows of royalties (e.g. Grubert, 1998). We are not aware\nof any existing papers studying trade in services as a mode of pro...t shifting.\nMoreover, the paper contributes to a broader empirical literature that investigates the trade\nboom in services in terms of its causes, for instance Jensen (2011) on enhanced tradability of\nservices and Francois and Hoekman (2010) on reduced non-tari\u00a4 barriers to trade; its conse-\nquences, for instance Haskel et al. (2012) on increased income inequality, Tre\non depressed earnings of domestic workers and Arnold, Javorcik, Mattoo (2011) on increased\nproductivity of downstream manufacturing ...rms; as well as its anatomy, for instance Breinlich\nand Criscuolo (2011) on the heterogeneity across service ...rms in the propensity to trade and\nKelle et al. (2013) on the relative importance of direct service exports and service sales through\nforeign a\u00a2 liates. To the best of our knowledge, no existing papers link the rise of international\nservice trade to tax and regulatory arbitrage.\nFinally, our ...ndings relate to a growing body of literature attempting to shed light on the\nuse of tax havens by multinational ...rms (Hines and Rice, 1994; Desai et al., 2006; Hebous\nThe paper proceeds in the following way. Section 2 presents evidence on the role of tax\nhavens in international trade based on aggregate trade \nows. Section 3 describes the German\n...rm-level data on service trade and foreign investment. Section 4 discusses the empirical strat-\negy. Section 5 reports the results. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks.\n2 Aggregate trade patterns\nThis section analyzes the role of tax havens in international trade using publicly available data\nfrom OECD trade statistics. Speci...cally, we rely on bilateral trade information from 2011,\nwhich is available for 34 countries for goods and 26 countries for services.\nIn a ...rst step, we show that tax havens play a far more prominent role in service trade than\ngoods trade by plotting the share of service trade that is conducted with tax havens against the\ncorresponding share in goods trade. Our list of tax havens follows Hines (2010) and includes 50\ncountries ranging from well-known tax havens like Switzerland, Singapore and Bermuda to more\nunknown jurisdictions like Anguilla, Andorra and Vanuatu. As shown in Figure 1, tax havens\nare more important partners in service trade than goods trade for all countries in the sample.\nIn Germany and France, for instance, tax havens account for around 15% of the service trade\nbut only a little more than 5% of goods trade; in the UK, tax havens account for almost 20% of\nthe service trade and roughly 10% of the goods trade; and, most extremely, in the Netherlands,\ntax havens account for almost 25% of the service trade and a mere 5% of the goods trade.\nFigure 1 somewhere around here\nIn a second step, we quantify the extent to which trade with tax havens exceeds trade with\ncomparable non-haven countries by estimating a standard gravity model augmented with tax\nvariables. The results are reported in Table 1; all standard errors are clustered by reporting\ncountry and by partner country. Column (1) shows that conditional on economic size, geography\nand other standard controls, a dummy for being a tax haven is a very strong predictor of service\ntrade. The coe\u00a2 cient of 1.79 implies that service trade is around 500% percent larger for country\npairs where at least one of the countries is a tax haven than for otherwise comparable country\npairs. Column (2) shows that this result does not extend to goods trade. The point estimate\nsuggests tax havens trade around 16% more goods than comparable non-havens, which is not\nstatistically distinguishable from zero.\nTable 1 somewhere around here\nThese patterns are very robust. For instance, the coe\u00a2 cient on the tax haven dummy barely\nchanges when we include higher-order terms of the GDP and distance variables to address the\nconcern that tax havens are systematically smaller than other countries, which could lead to\na biased coe\u00a2 cient on the tax haven dummy if trade is not log-linear in GDP conditional on\nany tax e\u00a4ects. The point estimate drops somewhat when the gravity equation is estimated on\nits multiplicative form as suggested by Silva and Tenreyro (2006), but still implies excess trade\nwith tax havens in services above 200%. By comparison, point estimates are consistently small\nand statistically insigni...cant in the goods equation.\nIn the baseline regression, we lumped together country pairs where only one country is a tax\nhaven and those where both countries are tax havens in a single tax haven dummy. Column (3)\nshows that the service trade e\u00a4ect is markedly di\u00a4erent in the two cases: the coe\u00a2 cient of 1.67\nfor country pairs with only one tax haven corresponds to a trade e\u00a4ect of around 430% whereas\nthe coe\u00a2 cient of 4.21 for country pairs with two tax havens corresponds to a trade e\u00a4ect of a\nstaggering 6600%. Column (4) shows that there is no signi...cant e\u00a4ect on goods trade in any\nof the two cases.\nThe very sizable trade in services between tax havens strongly suggests that simple pro...t\nshifting from high-tax to low-tax countries cannot fully account for the important role of tax\nhavens in international service trade. A possible explanation, which we will investigate further\nlater in the paper, is that services are traded through chains of entities belonging to the same\n...rm. In the tax planning employed by Microsoft, Google and other global ...rms, for instance, the\nright to exploit the ...rm'\ns intellectual property is licensed from a shell corporation in Bermuda\nto another shell corporation in the Netherlands, on to a corporation in Ireland and ...nally on\nto sales o\u00a2 ces in a number of di\u00a4erent countries (Kleinbard, 2011).1 Such structures generate\nservice trade \nows between tax havens that can be very large relative to the size of the tax\n1 The role of chains of entities is studied empirically by Mintz and Weichenrieder (2010) and Lewellen and\nhaven economies.\nWhile the aggregate trade statistics point to a prominent role of tax havens in international\nservice trade, they do not allow us to investigate this role further by considering trade between\nrelated and unrelated entities separately or analyzing individual service categories. In the\nremainder of the paper, we therefore turn to more disaggregated data.\n3 Firm-level data\nWe combine information from two ...rm-level datasets compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nFirst, we use information on service trade from the Statistics on international trade in services\ncollected for the purposes of the balance of payments statistics. In this dataset, we observe for\neach German corporation the value of its service imports and exports by counterpart country\nand service category.2 Second, we use information on foreign a\u00a2 liates from the Microdatabase\nDirect Investment (MIDI). In this dataset, we observe for each German corporation the basic\ncharacteristics of its foreign a\u00a2 liates, such as their turnover, pro...ts, equity and location, both\ndirectly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and parent companies.3 Merging these two data\nsources, we obtain a ...rm-level dataset on service trade and foreign a\u00a2 liates, which is augmented\nwith country-level variables such as GDP, tax haven status, distance to Germany and shared\nlanguage with Germany4.\nIt should be emphasized that the data do not allow us to distinguish trade between related\nand unrelated entities without error. First, when a ...rm trades with a country in which we\nobserve an a\u00a2 liate, this could very well be trade with the a\u00a2 liate, but might also be trade with\nanother unrelated entity. Second, trade with a country in which we do not observe an a\u00a2 liate is\nmost likely trade with an unrelated entity, but could in principle be trade with an a\u00a2 liate that\nwe do not observe in our dataset. That could happen if the trading partner is a subsidiary of a\nforeign parent (i.e., a foreign sister) for which there is no reporting requirement to the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nIn Table 2, we provide an overview of the aggregate patterns in our ...rm-level dataset. For\neach of the 11 broad service categories with aggregate trade exceeding e5 billion, we report\n3 Foreign subsidiaries are included if (i) the value of their total assets exceeds e3 million and (ii) the German\nparent holds a direct ownership share exceeding 10% or one of its subsidiaries holds a direct ownership share\nexceeding 50%. For a detailed description of the data, see Biewen et al. (2013) and Lipponer (2011).\n4 Information on GDP from World Development Indicators complemented with CIA factbook; on tax haven\nstatus from Hines (2010); and on geography, shared language and shared borders from the CEPII database.\nthe total value of German ...rms'imports and exports with breakdowns on whether the partner\ncountry is a tax haven or not and whether a foreign a\u00a2 liate is present in the partner country\nor not. The table establishes a number of interesting facts. First, Germany has a considerable\ntrade de...cit in services with imports around e250 billion and exports around e220 billion.\nThe largest service categories in terms of total trade are Sea transport, Intellectual property,\nAir transport and, most importantly, Other business services. Second, Germany has a small\ntrade surplus against tax havens with exports around e40 billion and imports slightly below\nthat. The share of tax havens in the service trade, however, varies widely across categories with\nparticularly high tax haven shares in Financial services, Sea transport, Information services and\nOther business services (20-30%) and low tax haven shares in Air transport and Road transport\n(5-7%). Third, trade with tax havens in which the trading ...rm has an a\u00a2 liate and which\nis therefore plausibly intra-...rm amounts to around e11 billion of imports and e8 of exports.\nThe intra-...rm share of tax haven imports also di\u00a4ers signi...cantly across services with high\nintra-...rm shares in Intellectual property and Other business services (30-50%) and a low share\nin Financial services and Construction (15-20%).\nIn Table 3, we report a breakdown of the two aggregate categories Intellectual property and\nOther business services, which are of particular interest in the context of pro...t shifting. The\nformer can be decomposed into Patents, Trademarks and Research and Development whereas\nthe latter most prominently contains Headquarter services, Technical services and Advertising\nas well as a number of smaller subcategories. The term Headquarter services is used for brevity\nand covers commercial, organizational, administrative and management services.\nThe aggregate patterns reported in Tables 2 and 3 can be used to gauge the magnitude of\npro...t shifting to tax havens occurring through trade in services. Under the extreme assumption\nthat all service imports from tax havens in which the importing ...rm has an a\u00a2 liate are purely\n...ctitious transactions where the acquired service has no actual value, these imports shift e11\nbillion of corporate tax base out of Germany. With a corporate tax rate around 30%, this gives\nan upper bound on the revenue loss due to intra-...rm service imports from tax havens of around\ne3 billion. To the extent that some of these imports represent genuine services with a positive\nmarket value, the revenue loss is proportionately smaller. This computation does not account\nfor the possibility that imports from tax havens are funneled through conduit countries and\nthus concealed as imports from other countries. Note, however, that even if a large share of\na\u00a2 liate imports from tax havens is completely ...ctitious and a signi...cant share of total a\u00a2 liate\nimports from tax havens pass through conduit entities outside tax havens, the total revenue\nloss is likely to be quite modest relative to the total German corporate tax revenue of around\n4 Empirical model\nThe baseline model used to study trade patterns is a linear probability model speci...ed in the\nfollowing way:\nTradeics = + 1\nHavenc + 2\nAffiliateic + 3\n(Affiliateic Havenc) + i\n+ Xc + \"ics (1)\nwhere Tradeics is a measure of trade in service s between ...rm i and country c; Affiliateic is a\ndummy indicating whether ...rm i has an a\u00a2 liate in country c; Havenc is a dummy indicating\nwhether country c is a tax haven; i\nare ...rm-level ...xed e\u00a4ects that absorb all ...rm characteristics\nsuch as size, sector and overall propensity to engage in cross-border transactions; and Xc is a\nvector of country-level gravity controls such as GDP and distance to Germany. We study\nthe two external margins of trade by varying the dependent variable: Importics is a dummy\nindicating whether ...rm i imports service s from country c and Exportics is a dummy variable\nindicating whether ...rm i exports service s to country c. The model is estimated for each of the\ntwo trade measures and for each service category separately.\nWe interpret the coe\u00a2 cients on the three key variables in the following way: First, the\ncoe\u00a2 cient on Tax Haven measures the average trade of a German ...rm with a tax haven in\nwhich it has no a\u00a2 liates over and above its trade with an otherwise similar non-tax haven\nin which it has no a\u00a2 liates. This is a measure of excess trade with unrelated parties in tax\nhavens. Second, the coe\u00a2 cient on Affiliate measures the average trade of a German ...rm with\na non-tax haven in which it has an a\u00a2 liate over and above its trade with an otherwise similar\nnon-tax haven in which it has no a\u00a2 liates. It is natural to interpret this as a measure of a\u00a2 liate\ntrade, but caution is warranted because the presence of a foreign a\u00a2 liate could also a\u00a4ect trade\nwith unrelated parties. For instance, a foreign a\u00a2 liate could promote transactions between its\nGerman parent and unrelated parties, in which case 2\noverestimates a\u00a2 liate trade, or replace\nthe German parent in transactions with unrelated parties, in which case it underestimates\na\u00a2 liate trade. Finally, the coe\u00a2 cient on the interaction between Tax Haven and Affiliate\nmeasures the average trade of a German ...rm with a tax haven in which it has an a\u00a2 liate\n5 Dhamarpala (2014) surveys the empirical literature on pro...t shifting and concludes that recent studies\nemploying rich ...rm-level data tend to ...nd less pro...t shifting than earlier studies.\nover and above its trade with an otherwise similar non-tax haven in which it has an a\u00a2 liate.\nThis is a measure of excess trade with a\u00a2 liates in tax havens. Note that even if 2\ndoes not\ncorrectly identify a\u00a2 liate trade because of the confounding e\u00a4ect of a\u00a2 liates on trade with\nrelated parties, 1\ncorrectly identify excess trade provided that this e\u00a4ect is the same\nin tax havens and other countries.\nIt should be noted that the presence of ...rm ...xed e\u00a4ects in the model implies that the\nvariables of interest are identi...ed exclusively from within-...rm comparisons. E\u00a4ectively, we are\ncomparing a ...rm'\ns trade with tax havens to the same ...rm'\ns trade with non-tax havens and a\n...rm'\ns trade with countries in which it has an a\u00a2 liate to the same ...rm'\ns trade with countries\nin which it has no a\u00a2 liates while holding constant country characteristics such as GDP and\ndistance to Germany.\nThe model allows us to test the following hypotheses. If multinational ...rms operate tax\nhaven entities that serve to sell mispriced or ...ctitious services to other a\u00a2 liates, we should\nexpect: a higher probability of observing imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens than from a\u00a2 liates\nin comparable countries ( 3\n> 0 in the imports equation) and a lower probability of observing\nexports ( 3\n< 0 in the exports equation). Moreover, if tax havens specialize in the production\nof real services, we should expect: a higher probability of observing imports from unrelated\nparties in tax havens than from unrelated parties in comparable countries ( 1\n> 0 in the\nimports equation). The probability of observing exports to unrelated parties in tax havens\ncould be lower than for other countries if local service sectors in tax havens tend to saturate\ntheir own domestic market ( 1\n< 0 in the export equation) or higher than for other countries\nif local service sectors in tax havens tend to rely on intra-industry inputs from foreign ...rms\n> 0 in the export equation). To be concrete, the large ...nancial sector in Luxembourg may\ncause purchases of ...nancial services from abroad to be smaller than in comparable countries\nbecause domestic ...rms have ample access to ...nancial services locally, or larger because the\ndomestic ...nancial sector relies relatively strongly on ...nancial service inputs, some of which are\npurchased abroad.\nMoreover, we specify the following model to estimate the excess pro...tability of tax haven\nentities selling services to a\u00a2 liates:\nProfitabilityics = + b1Havenc + i\n+ \"ics (2)\nwhere Profitabilityics is the book return on equity of an a\u00a2 liate belonging to ...rm i located in\ncountry c from which the ...rm imports service s; Havenc is a dummy indicating whether country\nc is a tax haven; and i\nare ...rm-level ...xed e\u00a4ects. The book return is winsorized conservatively\nat the 5% and 95% level. The model is estimated for each service category separately.\nIn each regression, the sample includes all foreign a\u00a2 liates located in a country from which\nthe German a\u00a2 liate imports a given service. The ...xed e\u00a4ects absorb ...rm-level di\u00a4erences in\npro...tability, so we are e\u00a4ectively identifying the excess pro...tability of tax haven entities selling\nservices to their German a\u00a2 liates by comparing to entities in other countries belonging to the\nsame ...rm selling the same service to their German a\u00a2 liates.\nIn the ...rst set of regressions, we estimate equation (1) for each of the 11 broad service categories\nand each of the two trade variables. Firms are included in the sample if they trade the speci...c\nservice category being studied from at least one foreign country, which implies that the sample\nsize di\u00a4ers somewhat across service categories. All regressions use a cross-section for the year\n2011. Standard errors are clustered at the ...rm-level unless reported otherwise.\nTable 4 reports the regression results with Imports as dependent variable. There are three\nsets of ...ndings. First, for all service categories there is a positive coe\u00a2 cient on Haven suggest-\ning excess imports from unrelated parties in tax havens. The point estimates range from 0.1\npercentage points to more than 1 percentage point depending on the speci...c service category.\nTo provide a sense of these magnitudes, we report the unconditional probability of trade with\nunrelated parties in non-havens at the bottom of the table. The comparison suggests that for\nmost services, the excess probability of imports from unrelated parties in an average tax haven\nis of roughly the same magnitude as the baseline probability of imports from unrelated parties\nin an average non-haven.\nSecond, for all service categories except Sea transport, there are positive coe\u00a2 cients on\nAffiliate, which provide rough measures of a\u00a2 liate trade (recall the caveat discussed in the\nprevious section). The point estimates suggest, for instance, that German ...rms import Air\ntransport services from less than 1 percent and Other business services from around 20 percent\nof its foreign a\u00a2 liates outside tax havens.\nThird, for the service categories Information services, Intellectual property, Other business\nservices, Financial services and Sea transport, there is a positive coe\u00a2 cient on the interaction\nbetween Haven and Affiliate suggesting excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens. The\nsigni...cant point estimates range from just below 1 percentage point to almost 3 percentage\npoints. Comparing the coe\u00a2 cients on Haven Affiliate to those on Affiliate suggests that\nexcess a\u00a2 liate imports range from 10% of normal a\u00a2 liate imports, in Other business services,\nto more than 60%, in Financial services. In the remaining categories the coe\u00a2 cient on the\ninteraction term is indistinguishable from zero, except for Construction where the coe\u00a2 cient\nis signi...cantly negative. The coe\u00a2 cients on the covariates are as expected: imports are more\nlikely when the foreign country is closer, larger and shares a border or an o\u00a2 cial language with\nGermany.\nTable 4 somewhere around here\nIn Table 5, we report the results obtained from estimating equation (1) with Exports as the\ndependent variable. The generally positive coe\u00a2 cients on Haven suggest that there are excess\nexports to unrelated parties in tax havens. The signi...cant point estimates range from less than\n0.1 percentage points to 0.4 percentage points and are smaller than in the imports regressions\nexcept in the case of Financial services. The generally positive coe\u00a2 cients on A\u00a2 liate are\nsuggestive of exports by German ...rms to a\u00a2 liates outside tax havens. For all service categories\nexcept Communication, Insurance services and Financial services, there is a negative coe\u00a2 cient\non the interaction between Haven and Affiliate suggesting that there are negative excess\nexports to a\u00a2 liates in tax havens. The coe\u00a2 cients on the covariates suggest that exports, just\nlike imports, are more likely when the foreign country is closer, larger and shares a border or\nan o\u00a2 cial language with Germany.\nTable 5 somewhere around here\nIn the remainder of the paper, we focus on the extensive import margin due to space con-\nstraints and the fact that imports from tax havens provide clearer and more easily interpretable\nevidence on both specialization and pro...t shifting.\nIn Table 6, we split the sample of ...rms into 3 industrial sectors and provide regression results\nfor each sector separately. Broadly, there is strong evidence of excess imports from unrelated\nparties in tax havens in all three sectors across almost all service categories. Interestingly,\nhowever, the excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens is concentrated among manufacturing\n...rms. Here, the interaction between Haven and Affiliate is positive in more than half of the\nservice categories and the estimated coe\u00a2 cients are considerably larger than in the full sample,\nboth in absolute terms and relative to the coe\u00a2 cient on Affiliate. The latter comparison\nimplies that excess a\u00a2 liate imports approaches or exceeds 100% of normal a\u00a2 liate imports in\neach of the categories information services, communication services, intellectual property and\nsea transport. By contrast, there is little evidence of excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens\namong service ...rms. The main exception to this broad pattern is ...nancial services where excess\nimports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates in the full sample appears to be driven primarily by service\n...rms.\nTable 6 somewhere around here\nFinally, in Table 7, we provide regression results for the narrow service categories underlying\nthe broader categories intellectual property and other business services. These categories are\nespecially interesting in this context, ...rstly because we have found evidence of trade with tax\nhaven a\u00a2 liates being skewed toward imports throughout all the speci...cations and, secondly,\nbecause they are both among the broad service categories that contain the most aggregate\ntrade. The consistently positive coe\u00a2 cients on Tax Haven are clear evidence of excess imports\nfrom unrelated parties in tax havens across all the narrow service categories. By contrast, the\ncoe\u00a2 cients on the interaction term indicate that excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens are\nconcentrated in trade with patents and trademarks within intellectual property, and in trade\nwith headquarter services and advertising within other business services.\nTable 7 somewhere around here\n5.2 Pro...tability of foreign a\u00a2 liates\nWhile the patterns of a\u00a2 liate trade are consistent with pro...t shifting to tax havens through\nthe sale of mispriced services, patterns of pro...tability across foreign a\u00a2 liates can potentially\nprovide more direct evidence on pro...t shifting. We therefore estimate equation (2) for each of\nthe 11 broad service categories.\nTable 8 shows that tax haven entities selling services to their German a\u00a2 liates have signi...-\ncantly higher book returns than other entities belonging to the same ...rm and selling the same\nservices to German a\u00a2 liates in 5 of the service categories. The excess returns range from around\n4 percentage points for Intellectual property to around 8 percentage points for Construction.\nBy comparison, the mean return of non-tax haven entities selling services to German a\u00a2 liates\n(reported at the bottom of the table) ranges from around 8 percent to around 15 percent.\nTable 8 somewhere around here\nThe ...nding that tax haven entities engaged in inter-a\u00a2 liate service trade earn excess returns\nis highly suggestive that these transactions involve a signi...cant element of pro...t shifting. The\nregressions, however, do not inform us about the e\u00a4ect of a\u00a2 liate service trade on the global\nallocation of pro...ts within the ...rm.\nTo shed light on this issue, Figure 2 displays a binned scatterplot of the ratio of tax haven\nservice imports to total service imports against the ratio of tax haven pro...ts to total foreign\npro...ts. Each blue dot represents the average ratio of tax haven pro...ts to total foreign pro...ts\nwithin a narrow range of ratios of tax haven service imports to total service imports. The\n...gure documents a strong correlation between service trade and the allocation of pro...ts with\nthe ...rm. Speci...cally, ...rms with less than 20% of service imports coming from tax havens\ntypically allocate below 30% of their foreign pro...ts to tax havens whereas ...rms with 50% or\nmore of service imports coming from tax havens allocate around 50% of their foreign pro...ts\nto tax havens. These results are suggestive that a\u00a2 liate trade in services is a quantitatively\nimportant channel through which ...rm pro...ts are shifted to tax havens.\nFigure 2 somewhere around here\nOur analysis may underestimate excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens if services are fun-\nneled through conduit entities in third countries. Firms may use conduit structures to avoid\nwithholding taxes on royalty payments applying to tax havens but not other countries or to\nmake service charges look more legitimate by letting the provider be a\u00a2 liates in respectable\nnon-tax havens. Tax motivated conduit structures to eliminate withholding taxes on dividend\npayments have been analyzed empirically (Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010) and discussed theo-\nretically in the context of interest payments (Johannesen, 2012) and hybrid ...nancial instruments\nThe main challenge associated with the study of conduit structures in service trade is that\nwhile we observe trade \nows between Germany and any partner country, we do not observe\ntrade \nows between other country pairs. Hence, we are constrained to base our inference on the\ncorrelation between trade \nows in and out of Germany and the location of foreign a\u00a2 liates of\nGerman ...rms. We focus on conduit trade \nows through the Netherlands, which has anecdotally\nbeen linked to conduit \nows related to intellectual property (Kleinbard, 2011) and which has\nbeen identi...ed as the main conduit country used by German ...rms for holding purposes by\nexisting academic studies (e.g. Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010). Speci...cally, we re-estimate\nour baseline model while allowing excess imports from a\u00a2 liates in tax havens to di\u00a4er between\n...rms that have an a\u00a2 liate in the Netherlands and ...rms that do not. If ...rms funnel service\nimports from tax havens through a\u00a2 liates in the Netherlands, we should expect these ...rms\nto have less excess imports directly from tax havens. We apply the model to each of the\nnarrow service categories within Intellectual property and Other business services where we\nhave consistently found evidence of mispriced trade.\nTable 9 reports the results from the baseline speci...cation where the coe\u00a2 cients of interest\nare interacted with NL affiliate, which is a dummy variable indicating whether the ...rm has\nan entity in the Netherlands. The coe\u00a2 cient on the interaction between Haven and Affiliates\nmeasures excess imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates for ...rms that are not present in the Nether-\nlands. The point estimates are qualitatively similar to the baseline estimates reported in Table\n7, but the estimated e\u00a4ects are larger. The coe\u00a2 cient on the triple interaction between Haven,\nAffiliate and NL affiliate measures how excess imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates di\u00a4ers\nbetween ...rms that are and ...rms that are not present in the Netherlands. In seven service cate-\ngories, including Patents and Trademarks within Intellectual property and Headquarter services\nand Advertising within Other business services, excess imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates are\nsigni...cantly smaller when ...rms have an a\u00a2 liate in Netherlands. Interestingly, in most of these\ncategories, excess imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates are close to zero for ...rms with a presence in\nthe Netherlands. In none of the service categories are excess imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates\nlarger for ...rms that are present in Netherlands than for those that are not.\nTable 9 somewhere around here\nTable 10 reports two robustness tests of the model estimated above. First, we estimate the\nbaseline speci...cation for imports with a logit model. As shown in Panel A, the results are very\nsimilar to the baseline results estimated with a linear probability model (reported in Table 4).\nWith the logit model, we ...nd excess trade with unrelated parties in tax havens in all service\ncategories except Construction. Moreover, we ...nd excess trade with a\u00a2 liates in tax havens\nin the service categories Information services, Intellectual property, Other business services,\nInsurance services and Financial services. The main di\u00a4erences are that excess trade with\na\u00a2 liates in tax havens becomes statistically signi...cant for Insurance services in the logit model\nwhereas it drops to bordeline statistical signi...cance for Sea transport.\nTable 10 somewhere around here\nSecond, we add country ...xed e\u00a4ects to the baseline linear probability model to account for\nall country characteristics that a\u00a4ect patterns of service trade. In this speci...cation, the tax\nhaven dummy as well as the country covariates are unidenti...ed, but we can still estimate the\nexcess probability of trade with tax haven a\u00a2 liates. As shown in Panel B, the results are again\nvery similar to the baseline results. The main di\u00a4erence is that excess trade with a\u00a2 liates in\ntax havens becomes statistically signi...cant at the 1% level rather than at the 10% level for\nCommunication services.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper has used aggregate trade data to show that tax havens play a prominent role in\ninternational trade with service trade and ...rm-level data to explore this role: does it re\nect\ngenuine specialization in services by tax havens or tax evasion by multinational ...rms? We\nshowed that ...rm-level patterns in service trade and foreign investment are consistent with both\ngenuine specialization and pro...t shifting and, further, that entity-level patterns in pro...tability\nsupport the notion that intra-...rm service trade serves to shift pro...ts to tax havens. Finally, we\nfound evidence suggestive of conduit service trade with tax haven a\u00a2 liates through a\u00a2 liates in\nthe Netherlands.\nWhile the evidence suggests that service imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates play a role in\ntax evasion, we argued that the implications for government revenue are likely to be modest.\nEven under the extreme assumption that all service imports from tax haven a\u00a2 liates are purely\n...ctitious transactions where the acquired service has no actual value, the implied revenue loss\nwould be around e3 billion or, equivalently, around 7% of the total German corporate tax\nrevenue. Our regression results suggested that excess service imports from haven a\u00a2 liates are\nrarely above 100% of normal imports and often much less than that. Taken at face value these\nresults imply that not more than half of the service imports from tax havens are tax motivated\nand, hence, that the government revenue loss is considerably smaller than the upper bound of\ne3 billion.\nThe latter ...nding speaks to contemporary debates about the revenue consequences of inter-\nnational tax planning by global ...rms. Based on information about the international allocation\nof pro...ts within U.S. ...rms, Zucman (2014) sets the annual revenue loss at a staggering $200\nbillion for the U.S. government alone. Hines (2014) use existing estimates of the tax sensitivity\nof reported pro...ts to arrive at an upper bound of the revenue loss of around 2-4% of the total\ncorporate tax revenue, or around $10-20 billion for the U.S. government. While our analysis\nonly covers one dimension of pro...t shifting, service trade with tax havens, and therefore cannot\nhope to bring de...nitive answers to this debate, our ...nding that the revenue losses resulting\nfrom service trade with tax havens are modest do suggest that the consequences of corporate\ntax avoidance are perhaps less serious than implied by the most pessimistic estimates.\nReferences\n[1] Andersen, J., Johannesen, N., Lassen, D., Paltseva, E., 2014.
