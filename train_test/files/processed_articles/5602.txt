Cities are important drivers of economic and cultural\ngrowth based on knowledge-driven ecosystems. As incuba-\ntors of creativity and the burgeoning cultural industries, cit-\nies attract the human capital of the music industry (Florida,\nis not only the capital of Victoria but also branded as the\nmusic capital of Australia (Melbourne confirmed as live\nmore than 4.5 million, Melbourne is currently the second\nlargest city in Australia after Sydney. By 2051, Melbourne is\npredicted to be Australia's most populated city (Savage,\n2014). This article highlights that Melbourne's music brand-\ning is primarily examined by applying a mathematical flow-\nchart of economic algorithms, which is \"a step-by-step\nprocedure of calculations\" (Sol\u00f3rzano, 2014, p. 1) used to\ndefine the value of music activity in an urban context.\nAlgorithm A (Economics) is associated with uncovering the\nfinancial impact of the music industry across revenue prof-\nits, employment figures, audience participation, and the\nnumber of music venues. However, as this article highlights,\nAlgorithm A, other algorithms such as Algorithm B (Four\nT's creative index) and Algorithm C (Heritage), used to\nassess music activity in urban areas, are associated with\nlimitations, and therefore paint a half picture about the\nthis analysis, the article is divided into three sections. The\nfirst section examines the three existing algorithms (A-C)\nand assesses their contributions to the definition of a music\ncity. The second section is a case study of how using\nAlgorithms A and B as an assessment tool to assess\nMelbourne's music capital status generates disputed claims.\nThe final section proposes a benchmark Algorithm D to\nassess music activity in the urban context and offers a com-\nprehensive definition of a music city.\nAlgorithms to Assess Music Cities\nAlgorithm A (Economics)\nAlgorithm A (Economics) is the current definer of music cit-\nies (Table 1).

There has been a significant amount\nof published academic work by economists about the cost\nassociated with the music industry such as concert tickets,\nproduction costs, and digital downloads and streaming\n(Cameron, 2016). However, Algorithm A, based on four key\nvariables (financial revenue, employment, audience partici-\npation, and the number of music venues), remains the\ndenominator to define music cities. In the case of Melbourne,\nindustry reports such as the 2011 Economic, Social and\nCultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria\n(also known as the Deloitte Report2) and the 2012 Victorian\nMusic Census (Newton, 2012) argue that Melbourne is the\nlive music capital of Australia for two main reasons: first,\nbecause Melbourne has more live music venues (465) than\nany other city in Australia, and second, because Victoria gen-\nerates more than Aus$1.04 billion in revenue annually. This\nis similar to the music revenue (US$1.06 billion) of Austin,\nthe capital of Texas, in the United States which is the self-\nproclaimed \"Live Music Capital of the World\" (Rowling,\nbecause the city had more live venues per capita (approxi-\nmately 250) than any other city in the United States (Terrill\nThe live music venue variable associated with\nAlgorithm A is also noted in the 2015 World Cities\nCultural Report (Table 3), which was first commissioned\nby the then Major of London, Johnson, in 2012 and con-\nreport examines thirty-one global cities,3 and Melbourne\nand Austin were included for the first time (Table 3;\nSimons, 2015). This report contends that Los Angeles\n(510) had the most live music venues, followed by New\nsupport music scholars Connell and Gibson's (2003, p.\n29) contention that the \"authenticity\" and \"credibility\" of\nmusic scenes are heavily linked to a \"live music\" culture.\nAs these scholars argue, if a city has a vibrant live music\nculture, then local musicians will base themselves there\nand have a \"home field advantage\" in the \"glocalisation\"\nThe 2015 World Cities Cultural Report also highlights\ntwo points in relation to music cities. First, the report's statis-\ntics support U.S. musicologist Lewis's (cited in Garrett &\nOja, 2011) view that the traditional location of the global\nmusic industry is \"a Euro-American construct\" (p.692) and\nlargely based in the \"superstar music cities\" (Florida, 2015,\np. 1) of New York City, Los Angeles, and London. Urban\neconomist Florida concurs with Lewis by contending that\nthese three cities can claim superstar status not only because\nTable 1.

For example, in regard to theAustralian music scene,\nthe world report contends that Sydney has more live music\nvenues than Melbourne. This differs from local reports, such\nas the Deloitte Report (Economic, Social and Cultural\nContribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011)\nand Victorian Live Music Census (Newton, 2012), which say\nthat Melbourne has more live music venues (465) than\nSydney (431). The world report also did not include Austin,\nthe Live Music Capital of the World, in its live music venues\ntable. However, as noted, Austin has more than 250 live\nmusic venues, which is higher than London (245) and Bogato\nfindings like this about music cities research are an issue that\nUnited Kingdom (UK). music entrepreneur Elbourne\nexpanded on during his biannual Global Music Cities con-\n(2013) previously noted, it is \"difficult to gain a clear picture\nof the music industry both here and around the world due to\na lack of comparable facts and figures\" (p. 15).\nLimitations. Limitations associated with usingAlgorithmAto\nassess music in an urban context are associated with two fac-\ntors: (a) music definitions and (b) narrow focus on econom-\nics. First, the term music has definitions irregularities and\ndiverse cultural practices (Cook & Eversit, 1999; Hesmond-\nhalgh & Negus, 2002). For example, the local reports about\nmusic cities such as Melbourne (Economic, Social and Cul-\ntural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,\nfocus on commercial, popular live music and the nighttime\neconomy. Admittedly, the early years of music studies were\ndominated by easily defined genres such as classical, fol-\nlowed by jazz and then rock. However, with newer urban\nmusic genres, such as hip hop, techno, electronic, dance, and\nworld music, music definitions began to blur within the\ndaytime and nighttime economies (Hesmondhalgh & Negus,\n2002). As a result, today there are \"many conflicting mean-\nings clustered\" around the terms \"music\" and \"culture.\"\nThe academy and the industry have long challenged the\ncultural distinction between music and nonmusic, live music\nand recorded music (Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002). These\nincomplete definitions reduce music to \"reductive and ste-\nreotypical representation\" and narratives (Cohen, 2007, p.\n53) associated with cities' musical sounds. It also feeds into\nthe \"commercially constructed strategic essentialism of\nTable 3.

For example, the City of Melbourne's\ndefinition of music because it includes\nany live or recorded musical performance by a singer,\ninstrumentalist, group, Disc Jockey (D.J), busker or street\nperformer, which takes place in a traditional venue such as a bar,\npub, theater, restaurant or club or in a non-traditional venue such\nas a warehouse, shop, car park or other outdoor public space.\nThis article acknowledges that it is often impossible for any\nreport examining a music landscape to identify all genres of\nmusic, but studies that do offer a more holistic picture of the\nnotes, the relationship between a city and music is \"not deter-\nministic,\" \"organic,\" or \"homological\" (p. 68). DeNora (2000)\nexpands on Cohen's point by noting that music is \"a way of\nhappening . . . over time and in particular ways\" (p. 158).\nSecond, studies about the economic impact of music cities\nhave overshadowed its social\u00adcultural impact, which, aca-\ncritical attention because it offers a wider perspective on the\ndynamics of consumption and production. As urban sociolo-\ngist Pratt (2009) contends, the \"culturalisation\" linkage to\n\"economization,\" while \"endemic in late capitalism,\" is limit-\ning because it is linked to a narrow approach (p. 4). Cultural\neconomists Hutter and Throsby (2008) concur with Pratt, by\narguing that the cultural turn in the economization of the arts\nhas reflected that there is a cultural value beyond a price tag.\nAnother cultural economist Jackson (2009) builds on these\nclaims by noting that an economic focus on cultural activity\noffers a narrow concept of cultural power and authority and\nfails to offer an evolutionary or historical view of the world.\nIn the case of Melbourne, branding the city as a music\ncapital of Australia has mainly been based on purely eco-\nnomic values. However, this approach has failed to account\nfor the social and cultural impact of urbanization such as\nhigh-density living, residential development, local planning,\nand regulation and licensing laws (Homan, 2014; Shaw &\ncontend, the focus on the economization of culture has\nresulted in the failure to draw on more holistic, social and\ncultural interpretative fields of qualitative investigation.\nfor navigating \"between neoclassical economics and the per-\nspective of political economy\" expands on this point by not-\ning that cultural economics needs to be \"flexible, open\nminded and receptive to the intellectual influence of other\ndisciplines in the social sciences and humanities.\" Throsby\nyears, \"cultural policy has broadened its scope\" to include\nconcepts such as the creative city, which the next section\ndetails.\nAlgorithm B (Four T's Creative Index)\nAlgorithm B is associated with what urban economist Florida\ncalls the four T's index of a creative city, which includes\nvariables such as technology, talent, tolerance, and territorial\nassets. Florida (2002) argues that the four T's are indicators\nof a city that are welcoming to the creative class such as\nthose from the music industry. In his 2002 groundbreaking\nbook, The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida argues that\nbranding your city a creative music hub generates income\nfrom tourism dollars, which stimulates the local economy\nand urban development. With concerns to the first T in the\nindex, technology, Florida argues that it fuels an entrepre-\nneurial culture, which sustains the information society.\nToday, the music link to Internet technology is critical. The\nsecond T in the index, Talent, is an ingredient based on edu-\ncated, skilled, and creative occupations, which can reflect a\nmusic population. The third T in the index, tolerance, is less\ntangible to measure and is linked to lifestyle choices and\nbased on a live and let live motto. To address criticism that\nFlorida's work fails to address issues of class, race, and\nthe Creative Class\u00adRevisited Florida added a fourth T, terri-\ntorial assets, which examines the quality and attractiveness\nof a city.\nData mining government statistical reports and occupa-\ntion indexes in relation to the first, three T's (technology, tol-\nerance, and talent) in 2002 Florida claimed that over one\nthird of the U.S. population were members of the creative\nclass. Derived from this research, Florida argues that Austin,\nthe self-proclaimed, Live Music Capital of the World, is also\nthe U.S. poster child of his three T's Creative Cities Index.\nHowever, Austin was barely a blip on the global music radar\nuntil the South by South West (SXSW, Inc.) music confer-\nence began in 1987, which has now evolved into the presti-\ngious, influential, and largest global music event. In 2012,\nAustin still ranked highly in Florida's revised Creative Cities\nIndex. As the first ever Austin Music Census, a Data Driven\nAssessment of Austin's Commercial Music Economy, pub-\nlished on June 1, 2015, noted, \"Austin has [long been] been\na leader among cities in presenting itself as a music city\"\n(Rowling, 2015, p.5). After visiting Austin and attending the\nSXSW, Inc., music festival in 2011, Music Victoria's chief\nexecutive officer, Patrick Donovan (2011), a former music\njournalist with the Melbourne-based masthead, The Age\nnewspaper, proclaimed that \"Melbourne is the Austin of the\nSouthern Hemisphere\" (p. 2). However, Melbourne is not\nmentioned in Florida's four T's creative index, but his final T\n(territorial assets) aligns with The Economist's Intelligence\nUnit's (EIU) Liveability Survey of 140 cities,5 where\nMelbourne has earned the EIU title as the most livable city in\nwithin the EIU ranking criteria is broadly defined and also\nincludes a city's \"arts [educational] and cultural infrastruc-\nture,\" which is \"often regarded as a significant reason for its\nLimitations.Limitations of Algorithm B are associated with\nthe failure to acknowledge the wider social\u00adcultural context.\nAs Pratt (2009) contends, Florida's creative class analysis of\npartly focusing on occupation fails to capture the social repro-\nduction of labor and knowledge in the cultural industries. He\nargues that Florida's conceptualization and definition of cre-\native occupation are narrow and unclear. In response to Flor-\nida's work, Pratt (2009) develops a statistical framework that\ndefines the breadth and depth of cultural practices known as\n\"cultural mapping\" (p. 7). This mapping exercise focuses on\nthe industry as a whole, rather than occupation, which is a\nfocus of Florida's work. Pratt's cultural mapping is a similar\napproach to what is used by United Nations Educational, Sci-\nentific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Creative Cit-\nies Network6 in their accreditation process of labeling Cities\nof Music, as the next section reflects.\nAlgorithm C (Heritage)\nAlgorithm C (Heritage) is tied UNESCO's City of Music\naccreditation process, a process which first began in 2006.\nFor a city to be awarded this UNESCO music title, it needs\nto illustrate six variables, the most obvious variable being\nmusic heritage, along with five other variables such as excel-\nlent background in music-making, education, community\ninvolvement, regular high-profile local music events, and\nCities of Music, and over half of them are in Europe and the\nUK such as Liverpool, which was awarded the status in 2014\n(Table 5).\nAs the birthplace of the 1960s pop group, The Beatles'\nmusical heritage of Liverpool in the United Kingdom was\nused as the backbone to the city's UNESCO City of Music\nsuccessful accreditation. Liverpool promotes The Beatles'\nmusic as their local culture harnessing and mobilizing it as a\ntourism board reported that The Beatles' legacy contributed\nabout \u00a382 million the local economy (\"The Beatles Add \u00a382\nMillion a Year to Liverpool Economy,\" 2016). These figures\nreflect that The Beatles' music is an expression of the city's\nsoul (Cohen, 2007) because their music played a role \"in the\nproduction of individual, collective and local identify\" of\nLiverpool (Cohen, 2007, p. 38). This local music identity is\nironic, given the success of the band was first in Hamburg\n(Germany) and then in London in the U.K (Cohen, 2007).\nHowever, as U.K musicologist Cohen (2007) contends,\nLiverpool is seen as the \"fifth Beatle\" because the band's\n\"haunting presence\" (p. 168) helped to \"re-image the city\";\n\"categorising\" \"claiming,\" and \"promoting\" their music as\nthe city's \"local culture\" (p. 5).\nLimitations.Limitations of algorithm C are associated with\nthe fact that the UNESCO's City of Music accreditation pro-\ncess does not allow dual rankings. For example, based on its\nmusic heritage alone, an argument could be made that Mel-\nbourne fulfills the UNESCO Music City status. However, in\n2008, Melbourne was designated the second city after Edin-\nburgh to secure a UNESCO City of Literature ranking.\nTherefore, Melbourne is unable to apply for the music cities\ntitle. This ruling signifies an artificial divide as there are\n\"many conflicting meanings clustered\" around the term \"cul-\nture\" and \"music\" (Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002, p. 2). As\nanthropologists and ethnomusicologists (Cook & Eversit,\nother cultural practices. For example, music is also often\nintertwined with literature such as songwriting. One only has\nto look at how American singer\u00adsongwriter and 1960s folk\nlegend Bob Dylan \"won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature,\nmarking the first time the prestigious award has been\nbestowed upon someone primarily seen as a musician\"\n(Lane, 2016)). This UNESCO singular ruling has also meant\nthat another city, Adelaide (South Australia), even though its\nmusic heritage is deemed less significant than Melbourne's,\nwas able to secure a UNESCO City of Music title in mid-\nExamining Melbourne, the Music\nCapital Using Algorithms A and B\nMelbourne's music scene using Algorithm A (Economics) or\nAlgorithm B (Four T's creative index), but rarely Algorithm C\n(Heritage).

The first six investigations reflect the\nlinkage between \"culturalisation\" and \"economisation\" (Pratt,\n2009, p. 4), which several economic sociologists oppose\n2010)) because of its reductionist view of cultural activity. The\nremaining industry report (Harris, 2014) adopted Florida's\n(2012, p. 38) \"creative class\" occupational index, which, as\nPratt (2009, p. 7) argues, fails to capture the wider social reality\nof the cultural industries.\nThe seven investigations differed in scope, methodology,\nand exploration of music genres, and therefore yield\nindustry reports with local or state government backing,\nwhile one study was conducted by the academy (University\nof Tasmania). Of the six industry reports, three were munici-\npal council reports, two reports focused on Melbourne, and\none report centered on Sydney. The academic study explores\nthe Australian music landscape. Concerning methodologies,\ntwo industry reports (Economic, Social and Cultural\nContribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011;\nNewton, 2012) use a \"mixed methods approach,\" which is\ndefined as a combination of quantitative and qualitative data\n(Creswell, 2009, p. 2). This approach supports the critical\n\"cultural turn\" (Pratt, 2009, p. 3) in the assessment of the\nmusic industry by favoring interpretive, qualitative method-\nologies (Throsby, 2010). These two reports contend that\nMelbourne is the music capital of Australia. The other four\ninvestigations (industry reports and academy study) used an\neconomically driven quantitative, \"reductivist\" or \"produc-\ntivist\" (Pratt, 2009, p. 3) approach and suggested that Sydney\nis the music capital of Australia.

Applying the talent vari-\nable of Algorithm B, the report found that Melbourne had the\nmost contemporary songwriters, in the categories of pop,\nrock, alternative music, jazz, and classical composers in\nAustralia. After Melbourne, Sydney had the second largest\nnumber of songwriters (Harris, 2014). Following the release\nof the 2014 report, principal APRA/AMCOS analyst Andrew\nHarris said the data confirmed that Melbourne was the music\ncapital of Australia. However, the APRA/AMCOS report\nwas associated with three limitations. First, other musicians,\nwho are not songwriters, were not included in this investiga-\ntion to validate Harris's claim. Second, individual APRA\nregistered songwriters have access to various catalogs in\nterms of number of songs, commercial release, and income\ngeneration, but this report also did not explore the activity\nand success levels among songwriters. Finally, industry\nreports, like the APRA and AMCOS one, need to be con-\nducted annually (not ad hoc) to assess the longitudinal trends\nand mobility of the Australian music population.\nVictorian Study: Algorithm A (Venue Location,\nEconomic Impact, Financial Profits, Employment,\nand Audience Participation) and Algorithm A\n(Four T's Creative Index)\nThe 2012 Victorian Live Music Census9 analyzed the local\nmusic scene according to Algorithm A (Economics) and\nAlgorithm B (Four T's creative index). In regard to\nAlgorithm A, the census reports that Melbourne and the\nsurrounding suburbs had 465 venues that offered live music\nat least two nights a week (Newton, 2012). Comparing\nthese figures with the 2015 World Cities Report (previously\nnoted) illustrates that Melbourne has the second most live\nmusic venues after the top ranked city, Los Angeles, which\nsupport Connell and Gibson's (2003) argument that\n\"authenticity\" of music scenes is heavily lined to a \"live\nmusic\" culture (p. 18). Concerning economic impact, the\n2012 Census also highlights that the live music scene (ven-\nues, concerts, festivals) generated Aus$1.04 billion annu-\nally (Newton, 2012). The census reports that the local live\nargument that the creative class fuels creative employment.\nThe 2012 Census of the Melbourne music industry also\nsupport Cohen's (2007) claim that music is a vibrant local\nresource (Table 6).\nAlgorithm B's Four T's creative index is reflected in the\ncensus survey results in three ways. First, surveying 258 live\nmusic performers the census found that the majority of per-\nformers were APRA members and had at least one commer-\ncial recording. This finding reflects Algorithm B's talent\nvariable. Second, the census reports that musicians promote\ntheir music via the street press or online, for example,\nSoundCloud or YouTube (Newton, 2012). This second find-\ning highlights Algorithm B's technology variable. As Florida\n(2002) claims, technology supports a creative city. Third, to\nmeasure audience participation and social and cultural\nimpacts from live music gigs, the census also surveyed 560\nmusic fans (Newton, 2012; Table 7). The census found that\nthe average music fan was a full-time worker or a university\nstudent, aged in their mid- to late-20s, who listened to rock\nmusic and sourced the music gig guide from the alternative\npresssuchascommunityradio(TripleR[RRR],10 Progressive\nfinding supports Algorithm B's territorial assets variable\n8 SAGE Open\nbecause it highlights that Melbourne music scene was asso-\nciated with a \"sense of place,\" and helped to create a music\nDespite having no comparable national or international\nempirical evidence, and making use of Algorithms A and B,\nin the Victorian census, Newton (2012) claims that\n\"Melbourne is Australia's centre of popular music live per-\nA precursor to the 2012 Census, the Economic, Social and\nCultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,\nwas released in June 2011 and conducted by Deloitte Access\nEconomics (Table 7). Similar to the 2012 Census, the report\napplied Algorithms A and B in its survey analysis but had\nAlgorithm A, the report was associated with three findings.\nFirst, in regard to economic values, it surveyed 103 venues\n(\"the intermediary\"), which were registered with APRA such\nas hotels, bars, cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs (Economic,\nSocial and Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music\nin Victoria, 2011, p. 4; Table 6). Despite the difference in sur-\nvey numbers, the Deloitte report (Economic, Social and\nCultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,\nMelbourne had about 465 venues, which play a crucial role in\ndeveloping music careers and incubating talent. Second,\nbuilding on the economic impact, the the Deloitte report said\nthat full-time employment figures increased by about 17,200\nstaff per year but did not provide original employment figures\nprior to that increase. Therefore, it is hard to compare its\nemployment figures with the 2012 Census, which stated that\nper year (Newton, 2012; Table 7). Finally, in relation to finan-\ncial profits, and like the census, the report says that the\nMelbourne music scene generated more than Aus$1 billion of\ngreat music cities such as Austin in Texas (Rowling, 2015).\nIn regard to Algorithm B, the 2011 Economic, Social and\nCultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria\nreport offers more insightful than the census because it\nundercovered three additional findings, which reflect\nFlorida's (2002) creative index of talent, tolerance, and ter-\nritorial assets. First, in regard to the talent and territorial\nassets variables, its survey of fifty-one live music perform-\ners, noted as \"the upstream supplier\" (p. 3) highlights that\nlive music venues nurture creativity by providing a space for\nmusicians to perform original music (p. 26). This finding\nreflects what Elbourne (2013) and Connell and Gibson\n(2003) say in regards to drawing and keeping musical talent\nare critical to any city's music status. As Connell and Gibson\n(2003) note, a city with a vibrant live music culture can serve\nas a \"cultural anchor\" for musicians (p. 29). It implies that\nMelbourne's live music scene possess territorial assets that\nare highly valued by musicians and others migrating to the\ncity from interstate. Second, extending on the territorial\nassets index, the report notes that a nurturing media (com-\nmunity radio such as RRR and PBS and the street press),\nlocal community cohesion, such as the Save Live Australian\nMusic (SLAM)13 rally in 2010 helps to protect the live music\nindustry (Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution of\nVenue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011). Finally, in\nregard to the tolerance variable, the report surveyed 427\nmusic fans, called \"the downstream consumers\" (p. 3) and\nfound that live music venues provide an opportunity for\nmusic fans to develop \"social connectedness\" and a \"sense of\nbelonging,\" particularly among young adults (pp. 38-39).\nThe report's findings linkage to Algorithm B suggest that\nmusic plays a role \"in the production of individual, collective\nThe two Victorian reports (Economic, Social and Cultural\nContribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011;\nNewton, 2012) suggest that music is an expression of\nMelbourne's urban life because it plays a key role \"in the\nproduction of individual, collective and local identify\" of the\ncity (Cohen, 2007, p. 2). The reports claim that no city in\nAustralia matched Melbourne's music activity, depth or\ndiversity. However, these proclamations are problematic\nbecause they are associated with two key limitations. First,\nsimilar to The Mastering of a Music City (Terrill et al., 2015)\nreport, the investigations fail to examine all genres of music\nYear Title of report Survey Venue Gigs Employment (full-time) Annual profit Aus$\nContribution of Venue-Based\nLive Music in Victoria\nno original figure was\ngiven)\nsongwriter, postcode\nSurvey of\npostcodes\nNote.

Second, they\nfail to make concrete national or international comparisons.\nmusic is affected by the ongoing economic and spatial\nrestructuring of the industry. However, these investigations\nalso acknowledge, \"The economic, social and cultural con-\ntribution of live music in Victoria\" is still in need of more\nin-depth study (Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution\nAnalysis of these two local investigations illustrates that\n\"music and cities . . . can mean different things to different\npeople,\" and are \"not impartial to crude generalizations\"\nCounterclaims to Melbourne's Live Music Capital\nTitle: Algorithm A (Live Music Activity, Financial\nProfits, Employment, and Audience Participation)\nFour investigations (one national academic study, 2015; two\nreport, 2013) exploring the Australian music landscape are\nbased on Algorithm A (Economics; Table 8). These reports\nsuggest that, based on the number of venues (live perfor-\nmance activity) and economic impact (financial profits,\nemployment, and audience participation), New South Wales\n(NSW), not Victoria, has the most music activity inAustralia.\nThe first investigation is a national academic study titled the\nEconomic and Cultural Value of Live Music in Australia\nfigures. It surveyed thirty-eight venues spread across six\nstates (NSW, Victoria, Queensland [QLD], South Australia,\nWestern Australia, and Tasmania) and two territories\n(Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory), and is\nassociated with two key findings. First, this 2015 study\nreports that NSW's live music scene (revenue, festivals, and\nattendance rates) had a marginally greater economic and cul-\ntural impact than Victoria (Economic and Cultural Value of\nLive Music in Australia, 2015). Second, it notes that NSW\nhad the highest live music attendance (35.9%) in Australia,\nwhile Victoria was second (31.3%) (Economic and Cultural\nThe second investigation is a national industry report by\nErnst and Young, titled Size and Scope of the Live\nand based on 2012 figures, it uncovers two key findings.\nFirst, the reports reveals that NSW has the highest number\n(38.4%) of live performance production and attendance\nwas third (2015; Table 8). Second, it highlights that the music\neconomic impact was greater than other aligned Australian\nindustries such as film, television, and digital games.\nThe third investigation, a city report from 2013 titled Live\nMusic Matters: Planning for Live Music and Performance in\nSydney, says that \"NSW was the largest contributor to the\nvenue-based live music industry\" in Australia because it\naccounted for 32% of the nation's music output (p. 7). These\nstatistics are derived from the fourth (and final) investiga-\ntion, a September 2011 report by Ernst and Young titled\nEconomic Contribution of the Venue-Based Live Music in\nAustralia, which contends that NSW had the most live music\nin Australia (32%), QLD came second (23.6%), while\nVictoria was third (22%). While these four investigations\ndispute the claim that Melbourne is the music capital of\nAustralia, they only paint a half picture of the music scene\nbecause they rely on the mathematical flowchart ofAlgorithm\nA (Economics). As scholars (Hutter & Throsby, 2008;\nture needs to give way to draw on more holistic, social and\ncultural interpretative investigation of the music landscape.\nBenchmark: Algorithm D (Music Cities\nDefinition)\nTables 6 to 8 illustrate that there are limitations, missing\ngaps, and discrepancies in the three algorithms (A-C) used to\nexamine music cities.

These discrepancies (and deficits reflect)\nthe need for a fourth (benchmark) algorithm, such as\nAlgorithm D (Music Cities definition), is needed to compre-\nhensively assess music activity in any urban context (Table\n1). Algorithm D has three main components in relation to\nmethodology, music genres, and scope. First, in regard to\nmethodology, its outcomes will be based on a \"mixed meth-\nods research,\" that is, a combination of quantitative and qual-\nitative data (Creswell, 2009, p. 2). Second, the algorithm\nassesses, a key variable, all music genres (live and recorded).\nFinally, concerning scope, it synergizes Algorithms A to C's\nthirteen variables, ranging from economics (financial impact,\nnumber of venues, and audience participation), Four T's cre-\native index (technology, tolerance, talent, territorial assets),\nand music heritage (background in music-making, educa-\ntion, community involvement, regular high-profile music\nevents of local and international importance) into one con-\nglomerate. In total, fourteen variables associated with\nAlgorithm D offer a more holistic definition of music cities\nbecause of two reasons. First, it emphasizes the importance\n\"of place (the physical environment through which we move)\nand space (the practice and lived experience of place)\" (Fink\nthat music cities are also influenced by \"cultures, economics,\npolitics, and technology of the changing structure and geog-\nraphies of music at local and global levels\" (Connell &\nConclusion\nThis article highlights that debates about whether\nMelbourne is Australia's music capital remain contestable\nbecause, for example, Algorithms A to C used to assess music\nactivity only paint a half picture of this \"music cities para-\norganizations commissioning various music investigations,\nthe article proposes a benchmark Algorithm D to review and\nanalyze music activity in an urban context.

In the case of Melbourne, if this city\nwants to claim its status as the music capital ofAustralia, con-\nsistent data mining using fourteen variables, outlined in\nAlgorithm D, offers a benchmark for further investigation.\nUntil then, ambient claims that Melbourne is Australia's\nmusic capital remains an abstract notion coined by cultural\ngroups that have a vested interest in pursuing a policy agenda,\nto sell their city as a national and global music city.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthor receivedfinancial support during a sabbatical from Monash\nUniversity for the research and authorship of this article.\nNotes\n 1.
