Oral health and welfare\nstate regimes: a cross-national analysis of European countries.\nby John Wiley & Sons Ltd\nVery little is known about the potential relationship between welfare state regimes\nand oral health. This study assessed the oral health of adults in a range of Euro-\npean countries clustered by welfare regimes according to Ferrera's typology and the\ncomplementary Eastern type. We analysed data from Eurobarometer wave 72.3, a\ncross-sectional survey of 31 European countries carried out in 2009. We evaluated\nthree self-reported oral health outcomes: edentulousness, no functional dentition\n(<20 natural teeth), and oral impacts on daily living. Age-standardized prevalence\nrates were estimated for each country and for each welfare state regime. The Scan-\ndinavian regime showed lower prevalence rates for all outcomes. For edentulousness\nand no functional dentition, there were higher prevalence rates in the Eastern\nregime but no significant differences between Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, and South-\nern regimes. The Southern regime presented a higher prevalence of oral impacts on\ndaily living. Results by country indicated that Sweden had the lowest prevalences\nfor edentulousness and no functional dentition, and Denmark had the lowest preva-\nlence for oral impacts. The results suggest that Scandinavian welfare states, with\nmore redistributive and universal welfare policies, had better population oral health.\nFuture research should provide further insights about the potential mechanisms\nthrough which welfare-state regimes would influence oral health.\nCarol C.

Macro-level\nsocial policies influence socio-economic inequality,\nsocial and cultural capital, and features of the health-\ncare system. They, in turn, have significant effects on\npsychosocial, material, and behavioural factors related\nto general and oral health (3, 8\u00ad13). In broad terms,\nwelfare state institutions and policies affect the distribu-\ntion of resources that are important to health, such as\nhousing, education, nutrition, and child and health care\n(14). There is a growing body of research on the associ-\nation between population health and welfare states (2,\nperformance for health indicators (e.g. infant mortality\nrates) in Scandinavian (social democratic) welfare states,\nwhich have more generous and universal welfare provi-\nsions, compared with other welfare regimes (2, 5, 6).\nTo analyse some of these issues, the welfare regimes\nframework has been instrumental as a theoretical per-\nspective. BAMBRA et al. (18) indicated that welfare state\nrefers to `a particular form of state or specific type of\nsociety' and usually alludes to the role played by the\nstate in social services and benefits, such as education,\nhealth, housing, poverty relief, and unemployment,\namong others. Although the emphasis is placed on the\nstate, other definitions also mention the market and the\nfamily. Welfare state is therefore defined as the combi-\nnation of market, state, and family in providing goods\nand services within a country (19). According to\nESPING-ANDERSEN (20), countries can be clustered in\nwelfare state regimes based on three principles: decom-\nmodification (the extent to which individuals and fami-\nlies can maintain a socially acceptable livelihood\nregardless of their market performance), social stratifi-\ncation (state commitment to maintain or break down\nsocial stratification) and the private\u00adpublic mix (institu-\ntional arrangements for assigning welfare functions to\nDiverse typologies of welfare state regimes have been\nproposed according to the type and content of welfare\npolicies (26). The typology most widely used was pro-\nthree types of welfare states: liberal (most welfare\ngoods and services are provided by the market), conser-\nvative (a key role is played by the family, and certain\nearnings-related welfare benefits are provided by the\nstate), and social-democratic (universal and comprehen-\nsive benefits are provided by the state and there is a\nhigh level of decommodification). However, some\nshortcomings of this typology, such as the range of\ncountries and regimes included, and the methodology\nused (29), have led to the development of alternative\nPrinted in Singapore.

Among these, Ferrera'S classification (30) is\nrecognized as one of the most accurate as it considers\nnot only the quantity of welfare provided but how wel-\nfare benefits are delivered (31\u00ad33). Ferrera identifies\nfour types of welfare states: Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,\nBismarckian, and Southern (30, 32). While the first\nthree types resemble the Esping-Andersen social-demo-\ncratic, liberal, and conservative groups, respectively, the\nadditional Southern type clusters countries with frag-\nmented welfare benefits. These are: generosity in certain\nprovisions, but weak in others; a marked public\u00adprivate\nmix in benefits and services; and some corruption in\nthe selective distribution of cash subsidies (30, 33).\nMore recently, the complementary Eastern European\nwelfare state type has been considered, in the social\npolicy literature, to account for specific features of\ncountries that have experienced dramatic changes from\na communist welfare state to systems characterized by\nmarketization and decentralization (21). As a result,\npublic health researchers have increasingly used five\nregime types within Europe: Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,\nAs stated earlier, populations living in social demo-\ncratic welfare states that have more generous and uni-\nversal welfare provisions have better health (2, 5, 6).\nHowever, only one relevant cross-national comparative\nstudy has considered how oral health varies by welfare\nregime. SANDERS et al. (36) assessed the relationship\nbetween welfare states and income inequalities in oral\nhealth-related quality of life (OHRQoL) using the Kor-\npi and Palme welfare typology that is based on the gen-\nerosity and coverage of two social programmes:\npensions, and sickness cash benefits. The study com-\npared four countries (Finland, the UK, Germany, and\nAustralia) and showed significantly lower income\ninequalities in OHRQoL in Germany, where the two\nsocial programmes have universal coverage and earn-\nings-related benefits, and larger inequalities in Austra-\nlia, where benefits are means-tested and the coverage is\nlimited to the low-income part of the population.\nTo our knowledge, no study has looked at the rela-\ntionship between welfare regimes and oral health,\nrather than oral health inequalities; none has used Fer-\nrera's typology to analyse oral health in European\ncountries; and none has included more than one coun-\ntry per welfare state regime. The objective of this study\nwas therefore to assess adults' oral health in a wide\nrange of European countries clustered by welfare state\nregime, according to Ferrera's typology and the com-\nplementary Eastern type.\nMaterial and methods\nData source and study sample\nWe used data from the Eurobarometer 72.3, a cross-sectional\nsurvey conducted in 2009 by TNS Opinion & Social at the\nrequest of the European Commission. The survey used a mul-\ntistage, random sampling design to provide representative\nsamples of the adult population in 31 European countries\n(the 27 Member States of the European Union, three candi-\ndate countries \u00ad Croatia, Turkey, and the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia \u00ad and the Turkish Cypriot Commu-\nnity). In each country, all administrative regional units were\nconsidered, and sampling points were selected with probabil-\nity proportional to population size and density. From the\nsampling points, households were randomly selected, and in\neach household, one respondent was randomly selected. Data\nwere obtained through face-to-face interviews based on a\nquestionnaire proposed by the European Global Oral Health\nIndicators Development project.\nThe survey included separate samples for Great Britain\nand Northern Ireland, as well as for East and West Ger-\nmany. We combined the first two as the United Kingdom\nand the last two as Germany. The total sample of 30,292\nindividuals,  15 yr of age, was used for analyses by\ncountry. As the focus was on welfare state regimes, 21\ncountries classified either in Ferrera's typology or in the\nEastern welfare state type were included in the analyses.\npeople, with sample sizes in individual countries ranging\nOral health outcomes\nWe considered two self-reported oral health measures: (i)\nthe number of natural teeth, and (ii) the frequency of\nimpacts of oral conditions on daily life. The number of\nnatural teeth was reported through a five-item scale: all;\nbinary variables were created: one for not having a\nfunctional dentition (fewer than 20 natural teeth) (37), and\nanother for edentulousness (no natural teeth). Only\nparticipants  45 yr of age were included in the analysis\nfor no functional dentition and edentulousness. In addi-\ntion, only dentate persons were considered for no func-\ntional dentition.\nThe impacts of oral conditions on quality of life referred\nto the frequency of the following seven items during the\nlast 12 months: difficulties eating food, difficulties in chew-\ning/biting foods, experiencing pain, feeling tense, feeling\nembarrassed, avoiding conversation, and reducing partici-\npation in social activities. Frequency was measured on an\nordinal scale: often, from time to time, rarely, or never.\nWe combined the first two (from time to time and often)\nand the last two (rarely and never) categories to create a\ndichotomous indicator for the prevalence of any impact.\nWelfare state regimes\nCountries were clustered according to Ferrera's welfare\nregime typology (Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian,\nand Southern) and the additional Eastern regime. This\nresulted in five welfare state regimes: Scandinavian (Sweden,\nFinland, and Denmark), Anglo-Saxon (the UK and Ire-\nland), Bismarckian (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,\nLuxemburg, and the Netherlands), Southern (Greece, Italy,\nPortugal, and Spain), and Eastern (Czech Republic, Esto-\nnia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia).\nAnalysis\nWe estimated the prevalence rates of oral-health outcomes\nfor each country and welfare state type. The prevalence\nrates were age-standardized by the direct method, using\nthe whole sample for the 31 countries as a standard popu-\nlation. A poststratification sample weighting (that accounts\nno et al.\nfor nonresponse) and a population-size weighting were used\nin the analyses to obtain population-based estimates.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the age-standardized prevalence rates\nof oral-health outcomes in the different countries.

On the other hand, Poland had the\nhighest prevalence of edentulousness (26.7%) and Hun-\ngary had the highest prevalence for no functional denti-\ntion (72.7%). Of the three oral-health outcomes\nconsidered, a larger variation in edentulousness existed\nbetween countries. There were also variations within\ngroupings of welfare regimes. For example, within the\nScandinavian welfare regime, the age-standardized\nprevalence of edentulousness ranged from 2.94% in\nSweden to 12% in Finland, and, in the Eastern regime,\nFigure 1 shows the prevalence rates of each oral\nhealth outcome by welfare state regime. For the two clin-\nical outcomes (edentulousness and no functional denti-\ntion), the Scandinavian regime had a significantly lower\nprevalence and the Eastern regime had a significantly\nhigher prevalence, when compared with the other welfare\nregimes. The prevalences of edentulousness and no func-\ntional dentition in the other three welfare regimes lay\nbetween those of the Scandinavian regime and the East-\nern regime, with the Anglo-Saxon regime tending to have\na higher prevalence of edentulousness, and a lower prev-\nalence of lack of functional dentition compared with the\nPrevalence of oral health outcomes in countries grouped by welfare state regime\nCountry n\nNo functional\ndentition (dentate participants\nEdentulousness\n(participants\nOne or more\nimpacts on daily life, `often'\nor `from time to time' (%)\nScandinavian (social democratic)\nAnglo-Saxon (liberal)\nBismarckian\nSouthern\nEastern\nNot classified\nThe prevalence of oral health outcomes was weighted and age-standardized by the direct method, using the whole sample for the\n31 countries as a standard population.\nCY-TCC, Turkish Cypriot Community; FYROM; former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\nOral health by welfare regimes in Europe 171\nBismarckian and Southern regimes.

The Scandinavian regime\nhad a significantly lower prevalence of oral impacts\nthan all other welfare regimes, except for the Bismarc-\nkian. Analyses by sex showed that women had a signifi-\ncantly higher prevalence of oral impacts compared with\nfare regimes. In the other welfare regimes, women also\ntended to have higher prevalence rates compared with\nmen, although the differences were not significant.\nAdditionally, we compared the prevalence rates of oral\nimpacts using different frequency thresholds. When\ncases were defined as those that reported `often' in at\nleast one oral impact, the general pattern was similar to\nthat observed in Fig. 1C, with the only exception being\nthe Bismarckian regime, which exhibited a slightly\nhigher estimate compared with the Anglo-Saxon\nregime. In this case, the prevalence rates ranged from\n4% in the Scandinavian welfare regime to 6.4% in the\nSouthern welfare regime. The proportion of people\nreporting `from time to time' in at least one impact ran-\nged from 16.8% in the Scandinavian and Bismarckian\nregimes to 28.4% in the Southern regime.\nDiscussion\nOur results support the idea that a welfare regime with\nmore redistributive and universal welfare policies would\nresult in better population oral health. Notably, we\nfound better performance for the Scandinavian welfare\nregime in all oral health outcomes considered. In addi-\ntion, complementary analyses, conducted as part of this\nstudy using other welfare state typologies (KORPI AND\nfound consistent results in terms of the Scandinavian\n(social democratic) countries, showing significantly\nlower prevalences for edentulousness and lack of func-\ntional dentition (results not shown). In contrast, the\nanalyses reported in this paper showed that the Eastern\nwelfare regime had the highest prevalence rates for\nthese two outcomes, whilst the respective prevalence\nrates did not vary significantly among the Anglo-\nSaxon, Bismarckian, and Southern regimes. The preva-\nlence of impacts of oral conditions on daily life was\nhighest in the Southern regime and lowest in the Scan-\ndinavian and Bismarckian regimes.\nOur findings are in line with previous studies show-\ning that the Scandinavian (social democratic) welfare\nence on health.

The consistency of our\nfindings with those for general health suggests that the\nmechanisms linking general health and broad social\ndeterminants are also relevant to oral health.

Further research with longitudinal\ndata from Eastern countries is needed to confirm this\nhypothesis. In addition, our findings showed a signifi-\ncantly higher prevalence of edentulousness among\nwomen than among men in the Eastern regime, which\nmight be partially explained by the marked intergender\ngap in life expectancy in Eastern countries (48).\nCultural differences could account for some of the\nvariation in the results between welfare regimes\nobserved in our analyses. For oral impacts on quality\nof life, cultural factors may partially explain why the\nSouthern regime showed the highest prevalence. It has\nbeen argued that higher levels of health complaints\nfound in southern European subjects could be related\nto cultural issues, such as greater expression of emo-\ntions, compared with subjects from other areas of\nEurope (13, 28). A previous study comparing oral impacts\non quality of life in people  65 yr of age in Britain and\nGreece indicated cultural effects in the perception of\nimpacts of oral conditions on quality of life (49). The\nother two oral health outcomes are less likely to differ\nbecause of cultural reasons as they are based on the num-\nber of natural teeth. However, it is still possible that these\nmeasures reveal some cultural differences in the value\nplaced on tooth retention, as reported in previous studies\n(50, 51). Moreover, variation in loss of natural teeth could\nalso be partly attributed to different approaches in dental\ncare practice.\nThis analysis has strengths worth mentioning. To our\nknowledge, it is the first study to analyse the effect of\ndifferent welfare state regimes on oral health status in a\nwide range of European countries. The macro compar-\native design, used in this analysis, allows us to assess\npolitical determinants that are usually homogeneous\nwithin nations (17). Also, by using the same source of\ninformation, this analysis has an advantage in terms of\nprecision and comparability as the surveys used the\nsame methodology and time lag for all countries. In\naddition, the oral health measures considered in our\nanalyses represent different dimensions of oral health.\nThe number of natural teeth can be considered as a\nmeasure of lifetime oral health because it captures the\ncumulative effect of different social determinants of oral\nhealth (45\u00ad47). On the other hand, the impacts on daily\nlife indicate how clinical oral health affects people phys-\nically, psychologically, and socially (52).\nThe study has limitations that should be considered\nwhen interpreting the results. First, the sample sizes are\nsimilar for countries with different populations. How-\never, the population size weighting factor used in all\nanalyses corrected for this, as each country is repre-\nsented in the analyses according to its population size.\nSecond, we do acknowledge that surveys of this nature\nwhich are carried out across many different countries\nare subject to varying measurement error, which may\npartly influence the results. Third, data for Norway\n(Scandinavian regime) and Switzerland (Bismarckian\nregime) were not available, which could have modified\nsome estimates. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the\ninclusion of data from these two countries would have\nconsiderably altered the general findings. Fourth, the\noral health outcomes were self-reported. It has been\nargued that differences in health perceptions could\nundermine the validity of cross-national comparisons\nwhich are based on self-reported measures (53, 54).\nHowever, the suitability of subjective health measures\nfor cross-national comparisons has been demonstrated\nsures are significantly associated with clinical dental\nmeasures and are considered to be valid indicators of\noral health (57\u00ad60). Finally, the study did not include\ndata on the use or need for prostheses, which would\nhave been a relevant variable considering the outcomes\nused. Apart from the aforementioned cultural influ-\nences, differences in oral impacts on quality of life can\npartly reflect variations in access and use of dental care\nservices.\nIt should also be acknowledged that there is no gen-\neral consensus about an `ideal' welfare regime typology.\nBased on the existing literature, we included, in the\nanalyses, only countries that have previously been clas-\nsified in one of the Ferrera's welfare regimes or the\nadditional Eastern type, thereby excluding countries\nnot classified under this typology. We used Ferrera's\ntypology because it accounts for theoretical and meth-\nodological weaknesses of previous classifications and it\ncategorizes countries based on different aspects of the\nwelfare provision, and therefore various recent studies\nhave used it to analyse variations in population health\nIn conclusion, we found significant differences in\nadults' oral health between welfare state regimes. Our\nresults suggest that characteristics of the Scandinavian\ncountries (particularly Sweden), such as the generosity\nand universalism of their welfare state benefits, appear\nto be linked to better oral health outcomes. Also, the\nEastern regime showed the highest prevalence rates for\nedentulousness and no functional dentition, and the\nSouthern regime showed the highest prevalence rate for\noral impacts. This is a descriptive study based on\nmacro-level international comparisons and it should be\nconsidered as an initial contribution to research on\npolitical factors and oral health. By including more\nsocial, economic, and political health-care system char-\nacteristic variables, future research could gain further\nunderstanding on the mechanisms by which welfare-\nstate types influence oral health.\nOral health by welfare regimes in Europe 173\nConflicts of interest \u00ad The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n1.
