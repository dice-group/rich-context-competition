    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence suggests that many physical, behavioral, and trait qualities can be detected solely from the sound of a person's voice,\nirrespective of the semantic information conveyed through speech. This study examined whether raters could accurately assess\nthe likelihood that a person has cheated on committed, romantic partners simply by hearing the speaker's voice. Independent\nraters heard voice samples of individuals who self-reported that they either cheated or had never cheated on their romantic\npartners. To control for aspects that may clue a listener to the speaker's mate value, we used voice samples that did not differ\nbetween these groups for voice attractiveness, age, voice pitch, and other acoustic measures. We found that participants indeed\nrated the voices of those who had a history of cheating as more likely to cheat. Male speakers were given higher ratings for\ncheating, while female raters were more likely to ascribe the likelihood to cheat to speakers. Additionally, we manipulated the\npitch of the voice samples, and for both sexes, the lower pitched versions were consistently rated to be from those who were\nmore likely to have cheated. Regardless of the pitch manipulation, speakers were able to assess actual history of infidelity; the one\nexception was that men's accuracy decreased when judging women whose voices were lowered. These findings expand upon the\nidea that the human voice may be of value as a cheater detection tool and very thin slices of vocal information are all that is needed\nto make certain assessments about others.\n",

Voice attractiveness has been\nlinked to greater bilateral body symmetry (Hughes, Harrison, &\nsymmetry (Abend, Pflu\n\u00a8ger, Koppensteiner, Coquerelle, &\nwomen and higher shoulder-to-hip ratio in men (Hughes, Dis-\npenza, & Gallup, 2004), and to the fertile phase of a woman's\nmenstrual cycle (Pipitone & Gallup, 2008). Additionally, sub-\njects can accurately match voice samples to a target's facial\nphotograph over 75% of the time (Krauss et al., 2002). Voice is\nalso used in clinical assessment for identifying certain neuro-\nlogical disorders such as motor neuron disease, conditions\naffecting the basal ganglia (Gamboa, Jimenez-Jimenez, Mate,\n& Cobeta, 2001), and for monitoring psychoactive drug effects\n1 Psychology Department, Albright College, Reading, PA, USA\n2 Psychology Program, Penn State Harrisburg, Middletown, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSusan M.

For instance, Apicella,\nFeinberg, and Marlowe (2007) found that men with lower voice\npitch have higher reproductive success (i.e., fathered more\nchildren). Likewise, Atkinson et al. (2012) found a direct rela-\ntionship between female fundamental frequency and several\nmeasures of genetic fitness among a group of indigenous\nwomen. There is also evidence showing that both sexes with\nvoices rated as sounding more attractive had first sexual inter-\ncourse at an earlier age, a greater number of sexual partners, a\ngreater number of extra-pair copulation (EPC) partners, and a\nhigher number of partners whom they had intercourse with who\nwere involved in another relationship (i.e., were themselves\nchosen as an EPC partner; Hughes et al., 2004).\nIt appears that listeners are unconsciously tuning into voice\npitch to ascribe infidelity risk to speakers. O'Connor, Re, and\nFeinberg (2011) manipulated the pitch of men's and women's\nvoices to test whether raters would make cheating ascriptions\nbased on voice pitch. Using a forced-choice paradigm, they\nfound that women, but not men, rated men with lower pitched\n(masculinized) voices as more likely to cheat. In contrast,\nmen, but not women, rated women with higher pitched (fem-\ninized) voices as more likely to cheat. O'Connor et al. (2011)\nattributed these results to listeners cuing in to the hormonal\nprofiles typically associated with opposite-sex infidelity risk.\nThat is, testosterone is associated with a lower pitched voice\nin men (Dabbs & Mallinger, 1999; Evans, Neave, Wakelin, &\nHamilton, 2008), and it has been positively associated with\nnumber of sex partners (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995). Indeed, it\nhas been shown that men's pitch was negatively correlated\nwith their reported number of sexual partners over the past\nOn the other hand, for women, estrogen is associated with\nhigher pitched voices (Abitbol, Abitbol, & Abitbol, 1999) and\nhas been positively associated with a greater likelihood to\nengage in flirting, kissing, or having serious affairs with some-\none other than a primary partner (Durante & Li, 2009). Further,\nwomen generally find lower pitched male voices as more\nattractive and prefer deeper voices to higher ones (Apicella,\ncially during the most fertile time of the menstrual cycle (Puts,\n2005). Men assess higher pitched female voices as sounding\nmore attractive (Collins & Missing, 2003; Feinberg, DeBruine,\nterm mating contexts (Puts, Barndt, Welling, Dawood, & Bur-\nriss, 2011). However, other studies have shown that when\nfemales lowered the pitch of their voice, men rated their voices\nas sounding \"sexier\" (Hughes, Farley, & Rhodes, 2010;\nHughes, Mogilski, & Harrison, 2014). Similarly, Babel,\nMcGuire, and King (2014) also found that female voices with\nslightly lower than average fundamental frequency (i.e., pitch)\nwere rated as more attractive by listeners. When Puts and col-\nleagues (2016) examined a large sample of female voices and\nstatistically controlled for several other acoustic parameters,\nthey found that pitch did not predict women's attractiveness\nfor either short- or long-term relationships. Despite the contra-\ndictory literature of what constitutes an attractive female voice,\nlisteners may simply have assumed that those with more attrac-\ntive voices were more likely to cheat simply due to increased\nsexual opportunity.\nThese findings raise the questions of whether voice can be\nused to determine whether another has engaged in sexual infi-\ndelity in actuality, and if this is possible, whether vocal signals\nof high mate value (e.g., voice attractiveness and attractive\npitch) are the only determinants used to assess if a speaker has\na history of infidelity. There may be subtle signals in the human\nvoice and/or the way in which a person speaks that can lead to\naccurate perceptions of a speaker's history of infidelity. This\nidea is in line with Ambady and Rosenthal's (1992) \"thin slice\"\ntheory that posits people can make reasonably accurate assess-\nments of others based on very minimal observations. As an\nexample, Rhodes, Morley, and Simmons (2013) showed that\nwomen could accurately judge an unfamiliar man's past unfaith-\nfulness from minimal facial cues, and women used masculinity\nas the valid cue to do so. People are also able to identify infide-\nlity in romantic relationships simply from brief observations of\nbehavior. Lambert, Mulder, and Fincham (2014) found that par-\nticipants could accurately detect which targets had cheated on\ntheir romantic partners by watching a short video clip of the pair\ninteracting. Lambert and colleagues determined that this detec-\ntion was mediated by ascriptions of commitment and trust-\nworthiness of the persons they were observing.\nResearch in evolutionary psychology has also routinely\nsupported this thin slice notion in the arena of vocal\nresearch (i.e., very brief voice samples can be used to pre-\ndict a myriad of physical and behavioral elements). For\ninstance, Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup (2009) showed that\nlisteners can select a speaker's body configuration at a\ndegree greater than chance from only hearing their voice.\nSpecifically, listeners were able to match a man's voice\nwith a silhouette approximating his shoulder-to-hip ratio,\nand listeners were able to match a woman's voice with a\nsilhouette approximating her waist-to-hip ratio. This ability\nmay be important in mate selection, as these ideal sex-\nspecific body configurations are a result of hormonal pro-\nfiles signaling mate quality (see Hughes et al., 2009).\nInfidelity Detection\nAside from using vocal cues, there seem to be other features\nthat individuals use for infidelity detection. Shackelford and\nBuss (1997) identified a long list of specific behavioral cues\nthat can lead people to suspect a partner's infidelity (whether\nthey were real or alleged) and included among them were\nobservations of partner engaging in changes in their normal\nroutines; exaggerated affection; a sudden increase in sexual\ninterest; emotional disengagement; passive rejection; being\noverly critical, argumentative, or apathetic; reluctance to\nspend time with one's partner; and reluctance to discuss a\nparticular individual.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nThe proclivity to cheat may also be revealed through per-\nsonality traits. As examined across 10 world nations, high\nextroversion strongly predicts infidelity (Nettle, 2005; Nettle\n& Clegg, 2008) while low agreeableness and conscientiousness\nis associated with infidelity (Schmitt, 2004). Therefore, it can\nbe argued that choosing a long-term mate with such traits may\nexpose oneself to a higher risk of infidelity.\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, it would be reproduc-\ntively advantageous for both men and women to assess\naccurately a partner's proclivity to cheat, especially consid-\nering that acts of infidelity occur at high rates. Wiederman\nadmitted to engaging in extradyadic (ED) dating activity\nand/or some form of ED sexual behavior (e.g., kissing,\nfondling, intercourse) while involved in a committed,\nromantic relationship. For a man, it is adaptive to be able\nto detect signs of infidelity because of the possibility of\ncuckoldry and investing in offspring who are not genetically\nrelated. For a woman, it is adaptive to be able to detect\nsigns of infidelity so as to avoid diversion of resources by\nher mate and/or avoid abandonment, which would have left\na woman and her offspring vulnerable in the ancestral envi-\nboth men and women have different but reproductively nec-\nessary reasons for detecting cheaters. Because of the inter-\npersonal and reproductive costs that men and women can\nincur from a partner's EPC (Shackelford, 1997), humans\nhave likely evolved strategies of detecting individuals that\nhave an increased likelihood of being unfaithful.\nPresumably, because the high cost of failing to detect a\npartner's infidelity places men at risk for cuckoldry, men's\ninfidelity detection system evolved to overestimate the likeli-\nhood of their partner's infidelity even more so than is the case\nfor women. This idea is in line with Haselton and Buss's (2000)\nerror management theory; the costs of a compromised paternity\nby failing to detect cues of sexual infidelity may cause men to\nerr by inferring infidelity even where none exists. As such,\nAndrews et al. (2008) documented that men were more likely\nthan women to generate false positives than false negatives\nwhen making judgments about their partner's past infidelities.\nSimilarly, Goetz and Causey (2009) found that despite the fact\nthat men were more likely than women to report that they\nthemselves would commit sexual infidelity in the future, they\nwere still more suspicious of their partner's future infidelity\nthan were women.\nDespite these sex differences in suspicion, when it comes to\nintrasexual competition, both sexes view rivals with a high\nmate value as particularly threatening (Buss, Shackelford,\nChoe, Buunk, & Dijkstra, 2000), especially when the rivals\nhave a more attractive body configuration (Buunk & Dijkstra,\nsar & Buunk, 2010). This is even the case with voice; men with\nmore masculine-sounding voices and women with more\nfeminine-sounding voices elicit greater jealousy responses and\nare perceived more frequently to be intrasexual threats and\nCurrent Study\nWe examined whether it was possible to determine whether an\nindividual had previously cheated on an exclusive, romantic\npartner by solely listening to that person's voice. First, we\nexpanded upon the procedures of O'Connor et al. (2011) by\nusing nonmanipulated, natural voices, and compared listen-\ners' ratings for likelihood to cheat with reports of speakers'\nactual history of infidelity. Because of the possibility that\nraters may assume that those with higher mate value were\nmore likely to cheat simply due to increased sexual opportu-\nnity, we aimed to control for aspects of the voice that may\ncontribute to the perception of a speaker's mate value, partic-\nularly voice attractiveness and vocal pitch. Therefore, we\nselected voice samples from a larger pool of speakers\nobtained from a previous study (see Hughes et al., 2004) as\nour stimuli that differed between groups on self-reported\ncheating history but matched for several attributes related to\nmate value. Second, in an attempt to replicate the findings of\nO'Connor et al. (2011), we also manipulated the voice sam-\nples for pitch to see whether raters ascribed cheating beha-\nviors more for the higher pitched female voices and lower\npitched male voices, and we examined how this may relate\nto actual records of infidelity. However, evidence regarding\nthe effect of a higher vocal pitch on perceptions of women's\nattractiveness is not conclusive in the literature, with several\nstudies demonstrating higher attractiveness ratings for low-\nered pitch female voices (Babel, McGuire, & King, 2014;\nmay relate to sexual intent and/or arousal by the female\nKarpf, 2006), we predicted that women with lowered pitched\nvoices may be evaluated as having a greater likelihood of\ncommitting infidelity.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne hundred fifty-two undergraduate students (64 men and 88\nwomen) from a small northeastern U.S. college served as\nindependent raters for this study. Their mean age was 20.01\nethnicities were as follows: 65% Caucasian/White, 23%\nAfrican-American/Black, 7% Hispanic/Latino, 4% Asian, and\n1% other. Only those who reported having a heterosexual\norientation were included in the analyses reported above.\nAdditionally, 45% reported currently being in an exclusive,\ncommitted, romantic relationship, while 55% reported that\nthey were not.\nParticipation in this study was voluntary, and all procedures\nwere approved by the local institutional review board. Partici-\npants who were enrolled in psychology courses at the college\nwere given the opportunity to receive extra credit as compen-\nsation for their participation, although some participants\nvolunteered for no remuneration.\nHughes and Harrison 3\nVocal Stimuli\nWe obtained voice samples from a larger data set (see Hughes\nspeakers were instructed to speak at a pace of approximately\none numeral per second. Following the procedures of O'Con-\nnor et al. (2011) who had used nine original male voices and\nnine original female voices, we selected 10 male voices and\n10 female voices for this study. Half of the speakers for each\nsex reported that they had sexual intercourse with a person\noutside of a previous or current, exclusive and committed\nromantic relationship at some point in their lives (i.e., were\n\"cheaters\"), and the other half reported never cheating on\ntheir partners. All voice samples were of individuals who\nreported being heterosexual, White, unmarried, and were cur-\nrently in a committed, exclusive relationship, thus assuring\nthat speakers had at least one relationship opportunity to cheat\nin their lives.\nIn an attempt to control for aspects of the voice that may\ncontribute to the perception of a speaker's mate value, we\nselected voice samples of speakers who matched between the\ncheater and noncheater groups on criteria related to mate value.\nAs shown in Table 1, there were no mean differences between\nthe cheater and noncheater voice samples in terms of the speak-\ner's age, independent voice attractiveness ratings made on a 5-\npoint rating scale (as described in Hughes et al., 2004), and\nvoice pitch for each sex, all of which may affect one's percep-\ntion of a speaker's mate value (Apicella & Feinberg, 2009;\nTable 1 also presents a comparison between speaker groups\nfor other acoustic measures that relate to the perception of\nvoice quality such as fundamental frequency SD, jitter, shim-\nmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), and voice sample dura-\ntion. Using Praat 5.3.70 software, five jitter measures were\ntaken (local, local absolute, relative average perturbation,\nTable 1.

A principal compo-\nnent factor analysis was performed for the jitter and shimmer\nmeasurements separately, resulting in one jitter factor (eigen-\nshimmer factor (eigenvalue: 5.911; Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin sam-\np < .001). Factor regression scores were compared between\ncheater and noncheater groups for each sex and are reported\nin Table 1. Our acoustic measures are similar to other reports of\nvoice measures in normal, young adults (Naufel de Felippe,\nFurther, since previous investigations have shown that voice\nis related to particular body measures (see Hughes et al., 2004,\nselected speakers between the two groups who showed no dif-\nference in their height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR),\nshoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), or body mass index (BMI), and\nreported measures of certain sexual behaviors (i.e., age of first\nmasturbation, age of first sexual intercourse, number of sexual\npartners throughout lifetime) for each sex, as shown in Table 1.\nPitch Manipulation\nIn addition to using natural voice samples, we created two\nversions of each voice recording, a raised pitch version, and\na lowered pitch version, using Pratt 5.3.70 software. Following\nthe procedures of O'Connor et al. (2011), voice pitch was\nfor a lower pitch from their baseline, allowing for the degree of\npitch manipulation to be perceived equivalently regardless of\nthe natural pitch. The manipulated pitches for female voices\nwere significantly different from normal pitch (M \u00bc 197.60 Hz,\nthe manipulated pitches for male voices were significantly dif-\nThe pitch of the raised male voices was not significantly\n0.14, p \u00bc .893, nor was the pitch for the lowered male voices\nSimilarly, there was no difference in pitch between cheater\nTo assure that our manipulated samples sounded natural,\nprior to the study, we conducted a perceptual manipulation\ncheck using independent raters (N \u00bc 7). Each of these raters\nwere asked to listen to each manipulated voice sample to deter-\nmine whether the voice sounded like a natural voice or manipu-\nlated voice sample, and all raters (100%) confirmed that each\nmanipulated voice had the quality and naturalness of a nonma-\nnipulated voice.\nIndependent Ratings\nWe tested participants either individually or in small groups in a\nprivate, quiet setting. After raters completed a brief demographic\nquestionnaire, they answered a set of questions designed to\ndetermine the degree to which they thought engaging in certain\nsexual behaviors with others when in an exclusive committed,\nromantic relationship was considered an \"act of cheating\" on\ntheir partner. Respondents were asked to rate different sexual\nacts using a 10-point scale ranging from 1 \u00bc not at all cheating\nto 10 \u00bc very much so cheating. The five sexual acts rated were\nkissing on the lips, kissing with tongue, intimate touching/fond-\nling, oral sex, and sexual intercourse. These questions were gen-\nerated by the research team to first gain a sense of what\nrespondents considered were acts of cheating since they were\nlater asked to assess how likely they believed speakers had\ncheated on their partners. The interrater reliability was relatively\nhigh for these items (Cronbach's a \u00bc .83).\nParticipants then listened to voice samples through stereo-\nphonic computer speakers and were asked, \"Using the follow-\ning scale, please rate how likely you think the person speaking\nhas `cheated' on their romantic partner with whom they are in\nan exclusive, committed relationship.\" They gave responses for\neach voice on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 \u00bc not at all likely\nto 10 \u00bc very likely. In contrast to the forced-choice paradigm\nthat O'Connor et al. (2011) used, we obtained interval scale\nmeasures to allow for greater variability in ratings and for\nparametric analyses.\nTo avoid fatigue effects, we did not ask raters to judge all 60\nvoice ratings (20 natural and 40 manipulated voices samples).\nRather, each participant rated 20 voice samples.

The within-subject fac-\ntors were the speaker cheater group and the speaker sex, as\nthese voice samples were heard by each rater, while the rater\nsex was the between-subject factor. Dependent measures were\ncalculated as mean values for each of the four vocal conditions\nheard by each rater: (1) male voices/cheater group, (2) male\nvoices/noncheater group, (3) female voices/cheater group, and\n(4) female voices/noncheater group.

Natural voices of female non-\ncheaters, manipulated, raised voices of male cheaters and\nnoncheaters, and manipulated, raised voices of female non-\ncheaters had infidelity ratings that fell significantly below\nchance value.\nDiscussion\nWhat Is Cheating?\nWe first wanted to gain a better understanding of which sexual\nacts our raters agreed had constituted cheating behaviors since\nthey were later asked to rate how likely a speaker was a cheater.\nWe found that although most behaviors (even fondling, touch-\ning, and kissing) were rated high on the scale as acts considered\nto be cheating, participants thought sexual intercourse and oral\nsex were the most likely behaviors to signify cheating. These\nfindings are in line with more comprehensive studies that have\ndocumented which sexual and erotic acts are perceived as\ncheating behaviors (Kruger et al., 2013; Yarab, Sensibaugh,\n& Allgeier, 1998). It is also worth noting that there were no\nsex differences in defining which behaviors represented cheat-\ning. Similarly, Kruger et al. found that men and women were in\nagreement as to which sexual or erotic acts are deemed cheat-\ning behaviors. However, these researchers addressed the pos-\nsibility that the data were limited by a ceiling effect, since both\nmen and women rated most acts as being highly indicative of\ncheating, as was the case in our study. Needless to say, the\nidentification of \"cheating\" behaviors was operationalized by\nour participants and revealed that engaging in a variety of sex-\nual acts was considered \"cheating.\"\nVoice and Cheater Detection\nWe found that individuals can use cues in a voice to determine\nwhether a speaker had cheated on their romantic partners. By\nsimply hearing a brief voice recording, raters judged actual\ncheaters as more likely to have cheated. These data provide\nfurther evidence that the human voice can be of value as a\ncheater detection tool. Since we controlled for voice attractive-\nness, voice pitch and other acoustic measures, and a variety of\nfeatures related to mate value (e.g., age, BMI, WHR, SHR,\ncertain sexual behaviors), this effect was not dependent upon\nobvious vocal cues that may signal a speaker's higher mate\nvalue or on features to suggest the person may have had more\nsexual opportunity to have affairs.\nThese findings also extend those of O'Connor et al. (2011)\nby showing that the sound of one's voice can be used as a\nmedium to assess a person's reported past history of infidelity.\nWhile O'Connor and colleagues' study showed how manipu-\nlating pitch plays a role in appraising a speaker's proclivity to\nbe unfaithful, our study demonstrated that perceptions of a\nspeaker's actual history of infidelity could, in fact, be deter-\nmined through voice alone. Further, these findings demonstrate\nthe validity of Ambady and Rosenthal's (1992) thin slice the-\nory, whereby one can make accurate assessments of another\nbased on merely brief observations. These data also suggest\nthat cognitive strategies have evolved to facilitate wise mate\nchoices, holding true even when only the auditory sensory\nmodality is operating.\nWe were unable to identify exactly which acoustic qualities\nwere driving the perception of cheating ascriptions, albeit a\ndetailed acoustical analysis beyond the aims and scope of this\nperceptual study. It is interesting, then, to speculate what\naspects of the human voice raters were using to make these\naccurate assessments because we eliminated differences\nbetween groups for the more conspicuous cues of a voice that\ncould be driving factors (i.e., variations in vocal attractiveness,\nvoice pitch, and other basic acoustic features). While evidence\nshows that a voice can be used to assess various traits and\nbehaviors, the acoustic parameters that allow for these various\nvoice assessments are largely unknown (Hughes et al., 2008).\nThere is also considerable debate about which exact properties\nof a voice allow for the perception of assessing an attractive-\nsounding voice (see Hughes & Gallup, 2008), and it may be a\nunique constellation of different acoustic features that contrib-\nute to perceived vocal attractiveness (Babel et al., 2014).\nThere could be a host of possible vocal parameters beyond\nthose measured in this study that may be responsible for\n\"leaking\" information about one's history of infidelity, as\ndemonstrated from studies examining vocal emotion expres-\nsion (see Patel, Scherer, Bjo\nvocal cues such as clarity of articulation may have also con-\ntributed to perceptions of infidelity. For example, masculine\nHughes and Harrison 7\nmen tend to display less clarity in their speech and show pho-\nnetic patterns indicative of masculinity, which in turn could be\nassociated with infidelity threat (Kempe, Puts, & Ca\n\u00b4rdenas,\n2013). However, as mentioned, a more detailed acoustic anal-\nysis of our voice samples was beyond the scope of this percep-\ntual study and would have required a far larger sample size of\nvocal stimuli to allow one to appropriately interpret such anal-\nyses. Further, because we used stimuli that were not intended\nfor a more detailed acoustic analysis (i.e., we did not have\nspeakers provide sustained vowel utterances), we were limited\nin the features we could accurately assess (Parsa & Jamieson,\n2001). As Parsa and Jamieson noted, analysis of continuous\nspeech can be more challenging than examining sustained\nvowels because of the inherent inconsistency of the signal and\nunvoiced silent regions of speech.\nIt may be the case that appraisal for the \"propensity for\ninfidelity\" is a reflection of personality traits that can be\nrevealed through the voice (Mairesse, Walker, Mehl, & Moore,\n2007). For instance, extroverts show greater variation in fun-\ndamental frequency, greater voice quality, and fewer silent\npauses (see Mairesse et al., 2007 for review), and high extro-\nversion strongly predicts infidelity (Nettle, 2005; Nettle &\nClegg, 2008). While our sample of voices was too small to\nappropriately make this sort of determination, it would be inter-\nesting to see whether particular speech patterns exist for those\nwho have been identified via voice as having a greater\nproclivity to cheat on their partners and if this relates to par-\nticular personality measures.\nIt could be argued that these results are a reflection of past\nexperience, and participants may have generalized attributes of\nvoices of previous partners they had known to have cheated in\norder to make these assessments. While there is evidence that\none can learn to better uncover deception and improve lie\ndetection accuracy through vocal cues, the effect only holds\ntrue for decoding practice with a particular target, and it does\nnot generalize to accuracy in detecting lies enacted by other\ndeceivers (Zuckerman, Koestner, & Alton, 1984). A high level\nof accuracy when detecting deceit through voice is also thought\nto occur when spoken deceptions involve emotion (Ekman,\nO'Sullivan, Friesen, & Scherer, 1991). However, it is important\nto realize that the voice samples used in this study were not\ncapturing a transient state of intentional deceit (as we had\nremoved any content and emotion from the vocal samples by\nusing a number count) but were revealing of more enduring\ntrait aspects of the voice.\nSex Differences in Cheating Detection\nThese findings also extend reports of sex differences in judging\na partner's faithfulness. Whereas the female raters in this study\nwere not necessarily more accurate in ascribing whether a male\nspeaker had actually cheated, they were more likely to suspect\nthat male speakers had cheated than did the male raters asses-\nsing female speakers, and this held true for both natural and for\nmanipulated male voices. This finding corroborates reports that\nboth male and female raters tend to think that men are more\nlikely to have cheated in their past (DeVries & Ajzen, 1971)\nand a large questionnaire study found that college women were\nmuch more likely to believe that all men cheat on a partner at\nleast once (Knox, Zusman, & McNeely, 2004). In addition, we\nfound that among the natural voices, male cheaters were the\nonly group whose mean infidelity ratings exceeded chance\nlevel, while female voices of noncheaters fell below chance\nlevel. Perhaps this sex difference can be explained by reports\nthat men are more likely to commit infidelity (Michael, Gag-\nnon, Laumann, & Kolata, 1995) and adultery (Kinsey,\nPomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard, 1953). Data from more recent\nstudies also substantiate the claim that men are more likely to\nengage in extradyadic sexual activity than are women (Allen &\nBaucom, 2004) and men were more likely than women to\nreport that they themselves would commit sexual infidelity in\nWhen it comes to sex differences in cheater detection, Ein-\nDor, Perry-Paldi, Hirschberger, Birnbaum, and Deutsch (2015)\nshowed that women displayed greater alertness to cues of a\npotential partner unfaithfulness than do men; however, while\nwomen were quicker and more accurate in detecting cues of\ninfidelity, they were not better at detecting actual threats from\nothers. Further, Rhodes et al. (2013) found that women could\naccurately judge a man's past infidelity simply from minimal\nfacial cues and used masculinity as the valid cue to do so,\nwhereas men were comparably less adept at this task. Andrews\net al. (2008) also found sex differences in making inferences\nabout a romantic partner's infidelity, but in their study, men\nmade more accurate inferences than women, as men's ratio of\npositive to negative errors was greater. These findings are con-\nsistent with the error management theory which posits that, for\nmen, the costs of failed pursuits (false positive errors) outweigh\nthe costs of missed sexual opportunities (false-negative errors;\nHaselton & Buss, 2000). More research is needed to elucidate\nsex differences in infidelity detection.\nVoice Pitch and Cheater Detection\nWhen manipulating pitch to determine its impact on percep-\ntions of speakers' infidelity, the effect of correct cheater iden-\ntification remained despite these changes in pitch; participants\nwere still attributing higher cheating ratings to those who had\nreported a history of cheating regardless of the manipulations\nin pitch. The one exception was that male raters could not\ndistinguish between cheaters and noncheaters for women with\nlower pitch voices.\nWe replicated O'Connor et al.'s (2011) finding that men\nwith manipulated lower pitched voices were more likely to\nbe ascribed as cheaters. Similarly, a subsequent study con-\nducted by O'Connor and Barclay (2017) also showed that lis-\nteners perceived higher pitched male voices as being more\ntrustworthy, less likely to commit infidelity, and less likely to\npoach another's romantic partner than lower pitched male\nvoices. O'Connor, Pisanski, Tigue, Fraccaro, and Feinberg\n(2014) found that the more likely a woman believed that men\nwith lower pitch voices engage in infidelity, the more likely she\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\npreferred men with low-pitch voices for short term as compared\nto long-term relationships. The authors suggested that this\nmechanism allows women to assess fitness and abandonment\ncosts associated with infidelity.\nSimilar to O'Connor and Barclay (2017), we were also\nunable to replicate the findings of O'Connor et al. (2011) with\nregard to perceptions of infidelity relating to women with\nvoices manipulated to be a higher pitch. Just as with male\nvoices, we documented that women with voices manipulated\nto have a lower pitch were also thought to be more likely to\nhave cheated than those with higher pitches. In fact, female\ncheaters whose voices were lowered were the only group of\nmanipulated voices whose mean infidelity ratings exceeded\nchance level. O'Connor and colleagues (2011) attributed their\nfindings to that fact that higher pitched female voices reflect\nhigher estrogen and mate value, and therefore these women\nmay have more opportunity to cheat. However, our findings\nsuggest that perhaps testosterone, which is linked to both lower\nGrisa et al., 2012) and sex drive, even in women (Abitbol et al.,\nboth sexes. Further, our findings are in line with evidence\nshowing that women tend to speak with deeper voices when\nconveying sexual interest to men (Hughes et al., 2010; Karpf,\n2006). In fact, when participants were asked to intentionally\ndisplay a \"sexy voice,\" women had decreased the pitch of their\nvoices even more than had men and showed greater success in\nbeing perceived as having a sexier voice (Hughes et al., 2014;\nTuomi, & Fisher, 1979). Therefore, it is possible that raters\nassociated a lower pitched female voice to women who were\nintentionally seeking casual sexual encounters such as affairs.\nIn this same vein, it has been shown that female voices with a\nbreathier voice quality were rated as more attractive (Babel\na woman displays a breathier voice, she is imitating a voice\nquality associated with arousal, and if a woman can manage to\nsound as though she is sexually aroused, she may be regarded\nas more desirable by men. In our study, manipulated lower\npitched female voices appeared to have made actual cheater\ndetection for men more difficult; men were unable to decipher\nwhich speakers were cheaters for the lower pitch voices but\nwere able to do so for the higher pitch female voices.\nAnother possible reason why our findings for manipulated\nfemale voices did not confirm those of O'Connor et al. (2011)\nmay be methodological differences. O'Connor et al. used a\ntwo-alternative, forced-choice paradigm to select which\nspeaker was more likely to cheat, whereas our study presented\nvoice samples individually and used interval rating scales to\ngenerate more variability in responses. Our study also utilized\nlonger vocal samples (i.e., a number count) as stimuli while\nO'Connor et al. used sustained vowel sounds. Studies examin-\ning how stimulus type affect voice attractiveness ratings have\nshown that word length samples tend to be rated as more attrac-\ntive to the opposite sex than vowel sounds taken from the same\ntargets (Ferdenzi et al., 2013), so perhaps the type of stimuli\nused in each study examining the detection of infidelity from\nvoice captured different percepts. Nonetheless, O'Connor and\nBarclay (2017) were also unable to replicate the findings of\nO'Connor et al. (2011) by failing to demonstrate that female\nvoice pitch had a significant effect on perceptions of infidelity.\nBecause the authors used similar stimuli and degree of pitch\nmanipulations as the previous investigation, they concluded\nthat their failure to replicate the findings of O'Connor et al.\n(2011) was unlikely due to methodological differences between\nthe two studies. Thus, additional work on how pitch contributes\nto the perception of infidelity of female voices is warranted.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThere were limitations to this study. Our data regarding infide-\nlity were based on self-report and may not have accurately\ndepicted participants' histories (i.e., because of social desirabi-\nlity, participants may have underreported their EPC history). It is\nalso possible that given our young sample of speakers, there may\nhave been less opportunity to cheat than in an older sample. In\naddition, we did not examine the cheating status of raters. Future\nstudies could account for whether raters' own history of infide-\nlity plays a role in their ability to determine another's infidelity,\nand this may better parse apart whether cheater detection apti-\ntude through voice is more of an inherent or experiential ability.\nMoreover, it would be interesting to replicate these findings\nwith those of different sexual orientations.\nBecause this was a perceptual study, we wanted to use con-\ntinuous speech as our stimuli since this is a better representa-\ntion of how perceptual judgments occur in \"the real world\" and\nwould allow for greater ecological validity. Unlike examining\nsustained vowels which have been used in other perceptual\nstudies, continuous speech can account for rapid voice onset\nand termination, variations in voice fundamental frequency and\namplitude, and voice breaks (Parsa & Jamieson, 2001). None-\ntheless, use of continuous speech stimuli comes at a cost in\nterms of acoustic analyses. When individual acoustic measures\nare considered in isolation, it has been shown that classification\nof voice quality is more accurate for measures derived from\nsustained vowels than for continuous speech samples (Parsa &\nJamieson, 2001). In particular, perturbation measures such as\nshimmer and jitter extracted from continuous speech samples\nare likely to be influenced by intonation and other modulation\neffects and reduce the identification of voice quality, thus mak-\ning it more challenging to examine objectively because of its\ndynamic signal.\nFuture work on this topic could also manipulate other fea-\ntures of the voice to assess what acoustic components are used\nto make this assessment outside of voice pitch. For instance,\nfuture investigations that utilize larger sample sizes of vocal\nstimuli could take into account how certain indexical features\nof speech may be revealing of personal information about the\nspeakers. As an example, both men and women judge a breath-\nier female voice to be more attractive, and this appears to\nindicate healthier, younger, more feminine larynges (Babel\net al., 2014). Future studies may wish to manipulate breathiness\nto determine effects on cheating ascriptions.\nHughes and Harrison 9\nIf pitch is a salient signal that impacts infidelity perceptions,\nmatching pitch between cheaters and noncheaters may have\nobscured performance accuracy. It is possible that judgment\nwould be influenced and even improved by allowing raters to\nhear naturally occurring pitch differences between speakers.\nTherefore, future investigations could also examine naturally\noccurring voices that are not matched in pitch to see if their\naccuracy to detect infidelity improves further with pitch\nvariation.\nConclusion\nIn sum, this study provides further evidence that voice may be\nused as a cue of mate infidelity. We were able to demonstrate\nthat is it possible to determine whether a person had cheated on\ntheir romantic partners from hearing their voice alone. By using\nnatural voice samples (i.e., those that were not experimentally\nmanipulated) and self-reports of an actual history of infidelity,\nwe were able to extend the external validity of previous inves-\ntigations (O'Connor, Re, & Feinberg, 2011) by showing how\nvoice can be used to uncover a speaker's actual history of\ninfidelity. While we cannot exactly pinpoint all the features\nabout a voice that our perceptual system is using to make this\nassessment, we know that pitch plays a role, but does not rep-\nresent the entire picture. We were able to replicate previous\nfindings showing that pitch seems to be of importance when\nmaking this assessment, albeit not a necessary component since\nraters were still able to identify cheaters regardless of pitch\nmanipulation (with the one exception of men's assessment\nof lower pitch female voices). In addition to the many other\ncheater detection mechanisms we hold in our mating strategy\nrepertoire, using voice to detect infidelity may have important\nimplications for our mating success as seen from an evolu-\ntionary standpoint.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbend, P., Pflu\n\u00a8ger, L.
