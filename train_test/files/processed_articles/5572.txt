The growth of the wireless telecom-\nmunications industry is due to the greater number of\nsubscribers and greater variety of services, namely,\nwireline services, wireless services (global system\nfor mobile communication [GSM] and code division\nmultiple access [CDMA]), internet services, public\nmobile radio trunked services, global mobile personal\ncommunication by satellite (GMPCS), very small aper-\nture terminals (VSATs), mobile value-added services,\netc., that are now offered. In the early stages of market\ngrowth, the emphasis was on acquiring new subscribers\nbut now as the market has matured, the significance of\nretaining current consumers has increased drastically.\nIndeed, acquiring new consumers is more difficult and\nexpensive than retaining the existing consumers, which\nis important for manufacturing and services sectors of\nan economy (Saeed, Hussain, & Riaz, 2011).\nTelecommunication sector is one of the technolog-\nically developed sectors of the Indian economy, as\nreported by the   Authority of India\n(TRAI). The total number of telephone subscribers\n1) (Cellular Operators Association of India, n.d.). The\nnumber of wireless subscribers reached 998 million\nin 2013, as consumers realized the utility of mobile\nservices in handling their day-to-day affairs (personal\nas well as professional). In response to the introduc-\ntion of mobile number portability (MNP), whereby\nconsumers can retain their mobile number even when\nswitching to another telecom operator, initially 1\nper cent (in 2011) applications were received, which\nper cent (in 2013) (Table 1). Since consumer switching\nhas become a critical issue facing mobile service firms,\nleading to the relationship dissolution, the debate to\nattract and retain consumers has resulted in the devel-\nopment of relationship marketing strategies. In this\nregard, Duck (1982) explained relationship dissolu-\ntion as the permanent dismembership, that is, migra-\ntion of users from one service provider to another. In\nmost services context, consumer switching is associ-\nated with negative consequences such as declining\nmarket share and poor profitability (Keaveney, 1995).\nAs switching has become a common practice among\nmobile users, it assumes additional significance in this\ncontext. To control switching, mobile service providers\nare increasingly relying on contracts that would\nlock-in consumers for a definite time period, but with\nchanging competitive dynamics, contracts are not\nbeing favoured by many users (Braff & Laogue, 2004).\nTherefore, it becomes important to understand the\nfundamental drivers of consumers' switching behav-\niour in the context of mobile services.\nMNP allows consumers to retain their telephone\nnumbers when switching from one service provider\nto another. The switching costs (SCs) associated with\nsubscriber identity module (SIM) have been abolished,\nwhich offers adequate opportunities for the consumers\nto choose the service provider that best suits their\ntelecom needs. MNP is important for telecom markets\nbecause besides removing the barrier to switching, it\nhas several additional advantages in the Indian context,\nwhere there is an oligopoly structure of telecommu-\nnication market and everyone is trying their best to\nimpress and satisfy immediate subscribers in order to\nmaintain the number of existing ones and also to attract\npotential customers. Therefore, with the introduction\nof MNP in India, subscribers can enjoy the freedom of\nchoice, thereby exiting bad network service provider, as\nthey can easily make comparison between the services\nof few or limited network operators and switch to the\none that best suits their need, without sacrificing their\nmobile numbers. However, the success of MNP is likely\nto depend on factors such as how simple and inexpen-\nsive the implementation of portability is.\nMNP as a percentage of wireless subscribers NA 1% 5% 6%\nSource: Cellular Operators Association of India (2015).\nSwitching cost reduces the consumers' incentives to\nchange their network providers, when they are not\nsatisfied with the existing services. MNP reduces the\ncost associated with network switching and thus\neases the burden of consumers, induces more compe-\ntition, and helps the new entrants (Armstrong, 1997).\nTherefore, it is possible that more and more consumers\nget involved in switching their service providers and\nthis switching behaviour of consumers significantly\naffects price competition and market share of network\nproviders in the wireless/mobile communication\nAs it is clear from Table 2, before MNP, the share of\nBharti Airtel was 28.09 per cent, followed by Vodafone\nMNP, most of the large network operators gained\nmarket share (e.g., Bharti Airtel 28.18%, Vodafone\nsmaller firms such as Videocon, Mahanagar Telephone\nNigam Limited (MTNL), and Loop mobile struggled\nto hold their current market position (Shi et al., 2006).\nConsumers who did not like the services of Videocon,\nMTNL, etc., switched to get the benefit from MNP.\nSeveral studies have been conducted to investigate the\ncosts and benefits of MNP, consumer adoption of MNP,\nand the effects of MNP on call rates and service quality\n(SQ) (Buehler, Dewenter, & Haucap, 2006; Dick & Basu,\n1994). With the exception of one study (Shin & Kim,\n2008), pertinent previous literature has not examined\nconsumers' switching intentions with MNP and if in the\npast they had intentions to switch their service provider,\nhow many of them actually switched and what were\nthe factors behind that switching. Therefore, the present\nstudy explores the factors causing switching intentions\nand analyses whether MNP has increased consumers'\nswitching intentions. The factors predicting consumers'\nswitching intentions include awareness about MNP\n(AAMNP), SQ, satisfaction, trust, commitment, price,\nreputation and image, attitude towards switching (ATS),\nperceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness\n(PU), and SCs.\nA review of extant pertinent literature reveals that\nnumerous studies have been conducted by eminent\nresearchers in the telecom sector but only limited\naspects of customer switching intentions have been\ncovered. For example, Gerpott, Rams, and Schindler\n(2001) demonstrated that overall customer satisfaction\n(CS) had a significant impact on customer loyalty (CL),\nwhich in turn influenced a customer's intention to\nterminate/extend the contractual relationship with his\nmobile cellular network operator. Further, the study\nfound that mobile service price and personal service\nbenefit perceptions were the supply-related variables\nwith the strongest effects on network operator.\nHowever, as the study was confined to CS and CL,\nfuture research can be pursued with customer-side\nvariables reflecting specific individual customer goals\nand motivations in using cellular services. Buehler and\nHaucap (2004) examined the consequences of MNP and\nrevealed that the ultimate effect of introducing MNP\nTable 2: Market Share of Network Providers in India\nS.\nNo.\nName of the Network\nProvider\n% of Market Share before\nMNP\n% of Market Share after\nMNP\n% of Net Increase/\nDecrease\nSource: http://www.coai.com/statistics/gsm-subscriber-figure-report\nwas the abolition of SCs, that is, the cost of changing\nSIM card. However, the study was conceptual in\nnature and it ignored the empirical effects of MNP\non consumers' switching behaviour. Aydin and Ozer\n(2005) suggested a significant relationship between CS,\nCL, trust, and SC's sub-constructs in the mobile phone\nmarket. The study tested cause\u00adeffect relationships\nsimultaneously between the variables on the basis of\ncorrelation; in future, these relationships should be\ntested by using structural equation modelling (SEM).\nShin and Kim (2008) found that CS, switching barriers,\nand demographics significantly affected subscribers'\nintention to switch. Among these factors, switching\nbarriers (positive) had the most significant influence.\nHowever, the study was confined only to the positive\nswitching barriers and was also limited to intentions;\ntherefore, future research needs to explore the actual\nstaying (AST) and switching behaviour of consumers.\nLyons (2009) examined the impact of MNP on mobile\ntelephonyretailpricesbyusinginternationaltime-series\ncross-section data and found that MNPreduced average\nprices when the switching process was rapid (less than\nfive days) but not when it was slower. However, the\nstudy is conceptual in nature. Rahman, Haque, and\nAhmad (2011) determined the factors (i.e., SQ, call rate,\nand brand image) of customers' perception towards an\noperator and suggested that price and SQ were more\nimportant factors influencing customers' choice of\nservice provider than brand image. As the study was\nconducted in Malaysia, it was felt that similar research\ncould be conducted in different cultural settings.\nThus, the previous studies were limited to either one\nor two aspects of customer switching in mobile phone\nservices. The proposed study intends to fill this research\ngap by examining all the dimensions of customer\nswitching intentions such as awareness of MNP appli-\ncation, SQ, relational quality (RQ), perceived price,\nreputation and image of the operator, ATS, PEOU,\nPU, and SCs. The study also proposes to find out the\neffects of MNP on customers' switching intentions,\nwhich have never been explored earlier. Besides this,\nan attempt shall be made to find factors influencing\ncustomers' actual switching (ASW) or AST in mobile\nphone services.\nKeaveney (1995) was the first to develop a model of\nconsumer switching behaviour for service incidents\nin which he identified eight incidents, that is, pricing,\ninconvenience, core service failures, employees'\nresponse to service failures, attraction by competitors,\nethical problems, involuntary switching, and seldom\nmentioned incidents.\nIn the mobile communication sector, which has\noligopoly characteristics, MNP has increased the\ncompetition, protected the consumers, allowed them\nto switch the service provider easier than ever before,\nand decreased the cost of changing the provider. In this\nregard, Durukan, Bozaci, and Dogan (2011) analysed\nthe relationship between awareness of MNP and\nconsumers' switching intentions on the basis of bene-\nfits, costs, quality, recent developments, and discounts,\nbut revealed that there was no relationship between\n`awareness of MNP' and `consumers' switching inten-\ntions'. Though awareness regarding MNP can assist\nconsumers in taking appropriate decisions regarding\nswitching the service provider, consumers shall also\nconsider economical, relational, technical, and func-\ntional factors before deciding in favour of switching\nthe current network operator. Awareness regarding\nMNP can generate understanding about the industry\nand help in differentiating between superior and low\nquality product so as to keep the market updated and\ncreate awareness of what is happening in the industry;\nhowever, the decision to exit a network operator shall\nnever solely depend on their awareness regarding MNP.\nHence, the following hypothesis can be formulated.\nConsumers' MNP awareness has no significant\nimpact on their switching intentions.\nSQ in the telecom industry is an important indicator\nto assess a firm's performance. Mobile subscribers\nwho perceive that operators differ in service levels are\nmore likely to switch than those who do not see any\ndifference among networks (Federal Communications\nCommission, 2005). In this context, Bansal and Taylor\n(1999) revealed that SQ was indirectly related to\nconsumers' switching intentions via ATS. Similarly,\nBansal, Taylor, and James (2005) asserted that consumers\nwould switch their existing service provider if they\nperceived low SQ. Chen and Wang (2009) analysed the\nrelationship between core SQ and consumer satisfaction\nin insurance sector and revealed that core SQ was a crit-\nical determinant of consumer satisfaction. The higher\nlevel of core SQ increases the level of consumers' satisfac-\ntion and decreases their intentions to switch. Also, Shin\nand Kim (2008) reported that SQ was indirectly related to\nswitching intentions via satisfaction and Khan, Ghouri,\nSiddqui, Shaikh, and Alam (2010) demonstrated that\nthere was a positive relationship between unfavourable\nSQ and consumers' switching a bank. Similarly, Anton,\nCamarero, and Carrero (2007) indicated that consumers'\nperception of poor SQ had a positive effect on termina-\ntion intentions. In addition, Hess, Ganesan, and Klein\n(2003) concluded that high quality could actually moti-\nvate consumers to strengthen the relationship with their\nservice provider. Further, Huang, Cheng, and Farn (2007)\nfound that quality helped in promoting consumers'\nloyalty and Bell, Auh, and Smalley (2005) indicated that\nboth technical and functional SQ were positively related\nto consumer loyalty. Thus, the following hypothesis can\nbe formulated.\nLower level of SQ significantly leads to higher\nconsumers' switching intentions.\nRQ is an overall construct, which is based on the\nprevious experiences and impressions the consumer\nhas with the service provider (Hennig-Thurau & Klee,\norganization as a second-order latent construct encom-\npassing satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Cronin and\nPatterson (2000) found that CS had a significant impact\non repurchase intentions in a wide range of services.\nAlso, Liang, Wang, and Farquhar (2009) provided\nempirical evidence that consumer satisfaction was\nsignificantly related to behavioural loyalty in financial\nservices industry. Trust--the consumer's feeling that\nthe seller will fulfil his promises--is also an antecedent\nof consumers' future behavioural intentions (Garbarino\nstrong predictor of commitment, which leads to repur-\nchase intentions (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, & Gremler,\nstyling and auto repair services, Bansal et al. (2005)\nfound a negative relationship between satisfaction,\ntrust, commitment, and consumers' switching of service\nprovider. Further, Wetzels, Ruyter, and Birgelen (1998)\nreported that commitment was a strong factor, which\nenhanced staying intentions. In addition, Lau and\nLee (1999) examined a significant positive association\nbetween customers' trust in brand and their loyalty and\nRanaweera and Prabhu (2003) confirmed that trust had\na significant positive impact on consumer retention.\nHence, the following hypothesis can be formulated.\nThe lower the satisfaction, trust, and commit-\nment towards the service provider, the higher the\nconsumers' switching intentions.\nThere are two tendencies with respect to consumers'\nperception of the price. The first maintains that\nconsumers regard high prices as a signal of high quality\nand vice versa (Dodds, Monroe, & Grewal, 1991); the\nsecond, in contrast, suggests that low prices can also\nfunction as a signal of good value for money (Kirmani\n& Rao, 2000). In either case, whether a low price is\nperceived as a low quality or a high price is perceived\nas uneconomical, when consumers are dissatisfied\nwith the value for money or perceive the price to be\nunfair, their intentions are stronger to switch the\nsupplier (Campbell, 1999). In this regard, Keaveney\n(1995) suggested that consumers voluntarily switched\nsuppliers because of their personal dissatisfaction with\nthe prices they paid. This dissatisfaction arose when\nthe consumers perceived the price to be unfair or exces-\nsively higher than alternative options. Also, Bansal\net al. (2005) indicated that among the reasons why\nconsumers switched suppliers, price-related issues\nwere important. Even Khan et al. (2010) concluded that\nprice positively influenced consumer switching behav-\niour. Similarly, Anton et al. (2007) demonstrated that\nconsumers' perception of paying an unfair price for\nthe service positively affected their intention to exit the\nrelationship. Therefore, the following hypothesis can\nbe formulated.\nUnfavourable perception of price has a positive\nimpact on consumers' switching intentions.\nReputation has been described as a social identity and\nan important intangible resource that can significantly\ncontribute to a firm's performance and its survival (Rao,\n1994). It is a key asset to firms, as it is valuable, distinc-\ntive, difficult to duplicate, non-substitutable, and it\nprovides the firm with a sustainable competitive advan-\ntage (Wang, Lo, & Hui, 2003). In this context, Muffatto\nand Panizzolo (1995) indicated that reputation played a\nkey role in measuring consumer satisfaction and thus, it\nwas identified as a key ingredient to retain consumers in\nthe services sector. Also, Wang et al. (2003) revealed that\nthe quality of product/service benefited not only by\nlowering costs but also by increasing competitiveness\nthrough the establishment of a good reputation and\nattraction and retention of consumers. Bloemer, Ruyter,\nand Peeters (1998) found that image was indirectly\nrelated to loyalty via perceived quality, whereas Awang\n(2010) demonstrated that corporate reputation was indi-\nrectly related to competitive advantage via perceived\nvalue and perceived quality of the service. Further,\nKhan et al. (2010) examined a positive relationship\nbetween unfavourable bank reputation and consumers'\nswitching of a bank. Thus, the following hypothesis can\nbe formulated.\nH5: Unfavourable reputation of service provider signifi-\ncantly influences consumers' switching intentions.\nThe role of one's ATS in predicting intentions to switch\nremains unexplored in mobile services or telecom\nsector. Generally, the more favourable the attitude is\nwith respect to the behaviour in question, the stronger\nis an individual's intention to perform that behav-\niour (Ajzen, 1999). In the context of mortgage services,\nBansal and Taylor (1999) revealed that ATS was the\nmost influential determinant of switching intentions,\nwhich was influenced by subjective norms, conse-\nquentially influencing consumers' switching inten-\nthat attitudes towards switching were associated\nwith consumers' switching intentions. Thus, a person\nholding favourable ATS will be more likely to switch\nhis current service provider (Desbarats, 1983). Hence,\nthe following hypothesis can be formulated.\nH6: Positive ATS significantly leads to strong switching\nintentions.\nPerceived usefulness is often regarded as a concept that\nincludes components such as effectiveness, efficiency,\navailability, sociability, reassurance, and instrumen-\ntality (Leung & Wei, 2000). PEOU refers to the degree\nof effort that consumers associate with using a mobile\nservice (Davis, 1989). In this regard, Hung, Ku, and\nChang (2003) revealed that PEOU influenced intentions\nto use mobile services. In addition, Nysveen, Pederson,\nand Thorbjornsen (2005) concluded that there was\na strong and direct effect of PU and PEOU on inten-\ntions to use goal-directed mobile services. Davis (1989)\nalso indicated that PEOU positively influenced PU,\nsuggesting that only if the mobile services were easy\nto use, the consumers would be able to take advantage\nof all the possible benefits of the goal-directed services.\nThus, PEOU and PU are important motivations for\nusing mobile services. Hence, the following hypothesis\ncan be formulated.\nPEOU and PU are significant factors determining\nconsumers' switching intentions.\nSwitching costs are defined as those costs that\nconsumers associate with the process of switching\nfrom one supplier to another (Burnham, Frels, &\nestablished a direct relationship between SCs and\nrepurchase intentions. Lee and Cunningham (2001)\nfound a significant impact of SC variables on service\nloyalty and concluded that service loyalty was not only\ndetermined by perceived SQ, but also by cost consid-\neration that arose from present transaction and future\nswitching possibilities. Burnham et al. (2003) affirmed\nthat SCs drove consumers' intention to stay with their\ncurrent service provider. If SCs are low, dissatisfac-\ntion with the SQ, price, or firm will motivate the inten-\ntion to switch suppliers (Bansal et al., 2005). Anton et\nal. (2007) also found that SCs are indirectly related to\nconsumers' switching intention via SQ, commitment,\nprice, and anger incidents. Bansal and Taylor (1999)\nrevealed that there is a direct relationship between SCs\nand consumers' switching intentions. More recently,\nShin and Kim (2008) indicated that switching barriers\nare the key factors in subscribers' switching intentions.\nThus, the following hypothesis can be formulated.\nThe lower the SCs, the higher the consumers'\nswitching intentions.\nA critical factor in the Theory of Planned Behaviour\n(TPB) is an individual's intention to perform a particular\nbehaviour. Behavioural intentions are considered to be\na critical factor in explaining consumers' actual behav-\niour, where an individual's strong intention to perform\ncertain behaviour is likely to result in its performance\n(Ajzen, 1991). The evidence for prediction of behaviour\nfrom intentions can be found in the applications of the\nTheory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and TPB in several\nIn this context, Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) insisted that\nmost individual's behaviour was predictably based on\nhis/her intentions. Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman\n(1996) also demonstrated that a favourable intention\nto switch predicted ASW. Further, Bansal and Taylor\n(1999) revealed that the stronger the consumers' inten-\ntion to switch the service provider, the more likely they\nwere to engage in switching behaviour. Hence, the\nfollowing hypothesis can be formulated.\nConsumers' switching intentions significantly\ninfluence their ASW.\nChanging consumer preferences and spending\npatterns influence consumers behaviour. For example,\nBeckett, Hewer, and Howcroft (2000) found that bank\nconsumers transferred their account to alternative\nprovidersbecauseofchangedlifestyle,suchasmarriage\nor shifting of house. Abratt and Russel (1999) showed\nthat price followed by trust, SQ, and firm, being avail-\nable at a time of crisis, were the most important criteria\nin the selection of a private bank. In contrast, Riggal\n(1980) confirmed that the convenience factor was most\nimportant for bank consumers followed by friends'\nsuggestions and low service charges. In addition,\nZeithaml et al. (1996) demonstrated the existence of a\npositive relationship between commitment and behav-\nioural intentions, which implied greater chances of\nAST behaviour. Moreover, consequences of relation-\nship efforts on consumers' behavioural intentions can\nbe viewed as signals of retention or defection (Liang\n& Wang, 2007). Thus, the following hypothesis can\nbe formulated.\nConsumers' switching intentions have a negative\nimpact on their AST.\nOne important source of constraints that consumers\nface in the case of switching-related behaviours\nis perceived SCs, which makes it costly for the\nconsumers to switch to another supplier (Fornell,\nand Taylor (1999) demonstrated that the lower the\nSCs, the more successfully consumers were predicted\nto engage in switching behaviour. In the context of\nbanks, Ghouri et al. (2010) analysed the relationship\nbetween unfavourable perceptions of price, unfa-\nvourable bank reputation, poor SQ, low SCs, and\nconsumers' switching, and found that there existed\na positive and significant relationship between these\nfactors and consumer's switching. Sathish, Kumar,\nNaveen, and Jeevanantham (2011) revealed that poor\nnetwork coverage, frequent network problems, high\ncall rates, and influence from family and friends were\nthe most important factors affecting switching behav-\niour of consumers. However, Durukan et al. (2011)\ndemonstrated that there was no relationship between\nthe awareness of consumers regarding MNP and their\nswitching. Bansal et al. (2005) asserted that service\nswitching was influenced less by consumer evalua-\ntion of service provider characteristics and service\nexperience than by alternative attractiveness as well\nas personal and social factors. Holloway, Wang, and\nBeatty (2009) found that following a failed service\nrecovery, consumers with high relationship quality\nwould experience a greater decline in their intentions\nto repurchase from the service provider in the future.\nKeaveney (1995) also publicized that core service\nfailures, service encounter failures, and inconvenience\ncaused consumers to switch services. Further, Shin and\nKim (2008) revealed that higher levels of perceived\nswitching barriers were associated with higher\nlevels of switching behaviour, whereas Wieringa and\nVerhoef (2007) found lower relationship quality to be\nsignificantly related to more switching. Therefore, the\nfollowing hypothesis can be formulated.\nVarious predictive switching factors (namely,\nawareness of MNP application, SQ, RQ,\nperceived price, reputation and image of the\noperator, ATS, PEOU, and PU and SCs) signifi-\ncantly influence ASW.\nCustomer loyalty is defined as consumer's intent to stay\nwith an organization (Zeithaml et al., 1996). Perceived\nSQ, CS, and loyalty have been identified as key factors\nin banking and other service industries (Dick & Basu,\nrevealed that image of a bank did not have a direct\npositive effect on loyalty while quality had a direct and\nindirect effect on loyalty, where the indirect influence\nwas via satisfaction. De Matos, Henrique, and Rosa\n(2009) found that SC was a significant antecedent of\nboth attitudinal and behavioural loyalty, with a strong\ninfluence on attitudinal loyalty. Yen (2010) showed that\nhigh perceived risk affected the relationship of SCs\nand consumer loyalty. Jones et al. (2000) observed that\nstronger interpersonal relationships were associated\nwith higher repurchase intentions. Bell et al. (2005)\nfound that the effect of technical SQ on consumer\nloyalty was much greater than the effect of func-\ntional SQ. Dongjin, Shenghui, and Kai (2008) stated\nthat perceived value positively influenced consumers'\nrepurchase intentions. Goala (2007) reported that calcu-\nlative commitment resisted switching when there were\ninappropriate employee responses to service failures,\na pricing problem, and a service encounter failure. In\naddition, Seo, Ranganathan, and Babad (2008) found\nthat more complex service plan, more sophisticated\nhandset, longer consumer association, and higher\nconnectivity quality of wireless were positively related\nto consumer retention behaviour. Hence, the following\nhypothesis can be formulated.\nVarious predictive switching factors (namely,\nawareness of MNP application, SQ, RQ,\nperceived price, reputation and image of the\noperator, ATS, PEOU, and PU and SCs) signifi-\ncantly influence AST.\nThe present study examines the factors that lead to\nconsumers' switching intentions from one mobile\nservice provider to another after the introduction of\nMNP. The data were collected through structured\ninstrument.Theitemsofvariousconstructsintheinstru-\nment, covering all the aspects of consumers switching\nintentions in mobile telecommunication services, were\nextracted from the previous literature (Exhibit 1).\nExhibit 1: Item Generation of Switching Factors\nS.

Attitude towards switching Bansal and Taylor (1999)\nSource: Literature survey.\nTo enhance the validity of the proposed model, a\npretest was conducted before the final survey. For pilot\ntesting, students of a North Indian university were\ncontacted on convenience basis. After analysing the\ndata collected through pilot survey, it was realized that\none item of SC, namely, `don't know what we will end\nup having to deal with while switching', was found\nambiguous and therefore not considered for final\nsurvey. Thereafter, the instrument was finalized, which\nconsisted of demographic profile, general information,\nand various aspects of consumer switching intentions.\nA 5-point Likert scale ranging from `strongly agree'\n(5) to `strongly disagree' (1) was employed for each\nitem. For the final survey, the respondents were the\nregular postgraduate students of the same university,\nconsidering that youngsters are always in search of\nnew services being introduced in the market, have\ncomplete awareness, and are adaptive about these\nnew services/offerings (Amin, Ahmad, & Huib, 2012).\nThey like creativity and innovation and easily move\nfrom one product to another. In fact, preferring new\nand innovative product is the core attribute associated\nwith youngsters (Stanton, Michael, & Bruce, 1994). On\nthe contrary, entrepreneurs, professionals, salaried\npersons, and senior citizens are less interested in new/\ninnovative/value-added services being introduced, as\nthey use their mobile phones mainly for professional\npurposes. These students were selected after obtaining\ndepartment-wise list of students from the nodal\nsection of the university and thereafter arranging all\nthe departments in an alphabetical order. According to\nthe list, the total number of regular students as on 31\nalphabetically, the sample size was calculated using the\nwere personally approached, 242 returned properly\nfilled-in instruments, thus providing a response rate of\nOutliers were detected and removed before analysing\nthe data. Normality of the data was also established,\nas normality is a pre-requisite for many statistical tests.\nIn order to find out the perceptual gap between two\ngroups of telecommunication consumers (i.e., male\nand female; prepaid and post-paid; consumers who\nswitched with MNP or without MNP), independent\nsamples t-test was applied. Confirmatory factor anal-\nysis (CFA) was used to test the adequacy of the meas-\nurement model (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The\nadequacy of the measurement model was evaluated\non the criteria of convergent validity, discriminant\nvalidity, and reliability. Finally, for testing the hypoth-\neses, SEM was used, which is a comprehensive statis-\ntical approach to test relationships among observed\nA preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the\nfinal sample consisted of 231 students (after removing\n11 outliers), out of which 36 per cent were males and\nremaining females; 29 per cent students were from pure\nsciences and 71 per cent from non-sciences. Further,\nconsidering previous qualification, 43 per cent had BA,\n37 per cent had BSc and 13 per cent BCom (Table 3).\nAmong these students, Airtel had the maximum\nnumber of subscribers (28%), followed by Aircel (22%),\nVodafone (21%), Reliance (10%), etc. The reasons\nfor being attached to their current service provider\nincluded better network coverage, low call rates,\nand low internet charges. About 88 per cent sampled\nstudents had prepaid connections and 44 per cent had\nalready switched their previous service provider--16\nper cent respondents switched from Airtel and among\nthem, only 5 per cent switched with MNP and 40 per\ncent without MNP. When asked about the reasons for\nnot adopting MNP, 28 per cent expressed unavaila-\nbility at that time, 17 per cent felt that the MNP process\nwas time-consuming, and 11 per cent did not adopt\nbecause of inconvenience caused by MNP and lack\nof information about it. Further, 29 per cent telecom\nusers wanted to switch their current service provider\nin the future and they intended to subscribe to the\nservices of BSNL (a government organization). Most\nof the respondents (71%) did not want to switch their\nservice provider (Khan, Shaikh, & Shah, 2012) just\nbecause they were content with their services, call\nrates, network coverage, etc.\nTable 3: Demographic Profile of Respondents\nRespondent Profile Number Percentage\nGender\nDepartment\nSemester\nPrevious Qualification\nFather's Occupation\nSource: Primary data collected from the customers of mobile\nservices.\nIn order to weed out the perceptual gap between two\ngroups, independent samples t-test was applied.

(2) * is used to specify the blank\nbox for items in Table 4 (i.e., where we constrained it as 1 in t-value calculations).\nTable 4 continued\nA CFA was conducted through AMOS (16.0), using\nmaximum-likelihood estimation (Joreskog & Sorbom,\n1993), on the major factors of consumers' switching\nintentions (Table 4). In order to assess the fitness of\nthe models, multiple fit indices have been reported,\nnamely, 2/df, goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted\ngoodness of fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index\n(CFI), normed-fit index (NFI), Tucker\u00adLewis index\n(TLI), Root Mean Square Residual (RMR), and root\nmean square error of approximation (RMSEA). All\nthese indices reveal that measurement models are\nreasonably consistent with the data, that is, 2/df is\nless than 5.00; GFI, AGFI, CFI, NFI, and TLI are more\nreliability of the measures were assessed through\nstandardized regression weights (SRWs) and variance\nextracted (Table 6). Construct validity of each construct\nwas calculated as it directly affected the substan-\ntive models being tested (Bagozzi & Edwards, 1998).\nFactor loadings above 0.50 are generally considered\nthe minimal level at which convergent validity could\nbe suggested (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988) and in the present\nstudy, convergent validity of each construct gets estab-\nlished, as majority of loadings are above 0.50 (Table\n6). Another criterion being used for assessing conver-\ngent validity is average variance extracted (AVE),\nwhich came out to be above 0.50 (Table 7). In addition\nto assessing the validity of the measure, reliability of\neach construct was assessed through Cronbach's alpha\nco-efficient and the value above 0.70 signifies that the\nTable 5: Fit Indices of Measurement Models\nRQ (Satisfaction, trust,\ncommitment)\nSource: Primary data collected from the customers of mobile services.\nNote: CMIN is the value of Chi-square or Minimum Discrepancy Chi-square.\nTable 6: Standardized Regression Weights\nRelationships SIs ASW AST\nSource: Primary data collected from the customers of mobile services.\nNote: SIs=  .\nTable 7: Reliability and Validity of Constructs\nConstructs Convergent\nValidity/AVE\nComposite\nReliability\nCronbach's\nAlpha\nSource: Primary data collected from the customers of mobile services.\nAnother way of establishing reliability is through\ncomposite reliability (CR), which came out to be above\n0.90, thus indicating the internal consistency of the\ndata (Table 7). Discriminant validity can be statistically\ndemonstrated using a Chi-square difference test to each\nof the possible pairs of the measurement scales. The\nresults of the test reveal that for all the pairs of construct,\nthe Chi-square values are significant at 0.05 level (2 >\n3.84, df = 1), thereby indicating discriminant validity\nof constructs in all possible pairings (Ahire, Golhar, &\nWaller, 1996). As the correlation matrix reveals a high\ndegree of relationship among the factors predicting\nconsumers' switching intentions, discriminant validity\ncould not be established by comparing AVE of the\nconstruct with the squared correlation between the\npair of constructs (Table 8). Since most of the correla-\ntion coefficients are above 0.50, theoretical restrictions\nin achieving discriminant validity are obvious.\nTable 8: Correlation Matrix of Predictive Switching Factors\nAAMNP Pearson correlation 1\nSig.

The\nresults reveal that the highest contributing variable\ntowards switching intentions and AST/ASW is trust (SI:\nservice provider plays a significant role in influencing\nnot only the switching intentions but also AST and ASW.\nTo test the hypothesized relationships in the model\n(Figure 1), SEM was conducted using AMOS (16.0). The\nstructural model was examined to test the hypotheses\ndepicting relationship among constructs (Table 9). It\nbecomes evident from the SEM results that consumers'\nawareness regarding MNP has no effect on their inten-\nRQS\nRQT\nRQC\nP\nRI\nATS\nPEOU\nPU\nSQ\nSC\nAAMNP\n \nASW\nAST\nFigure 1: Structural Model of Predictive Switching Factors for MNP\nSource: Literature survey.\nNotes:\nAAMNP--Awareness about mobile number portability; SQ--service quality; RQS--relational quality satisfaction; RQT--relational\nquality trust; RQC--relational quality commitment; P--price; RI--reputation and image; ATS--attitude towards switching; PEOU--\nperceived ease of use; PU--perceived usefulness; SC--switching costs; ASW--actual switching; and AST--actual staying.\nthus, H1 stands accepted. This implies that consumers\nwith complete information regarding MNP do not\nintend to switch current operator, possibly, because of\nswitching barriers (i.e., SCs). In this context, Durukan\net al. (2011) revealed that there was no meaningful\nrelationship between `awareness about MNP' and\n`switching intentions'. Besides the proposed model,\ntwo other models, namely, formative model and high-\norder formative model, were also tested. The fit indices\nreveal that the proposed model is the best fit model as\ncompared to the other two models (Table 9).\nTable 9: Overall Fitness of Structural Model\nSource: Primary data collected from the customers of mobile services.\nIt is again clear from the SEM results that lower SQ\nsignificantly influences consumers' switching inten-\nthis regard, Saeed et al. (2011) demonstrated a positive\nassociation between poor SQ and switching intentions.\nThe SEM analysis further reveals that low satisfaction (\n0.86) are the significant factors influencing consumers'\nswitching intentions. Hence, on the basis of these results,\nH3 stands accepted. The negative relationship between\nsatisfaction with a service provider and switching inten-\ntions is well established (e.g., Bansal & Taylor, 1999;\nCronin, Brady, & Hult, 2000). This signifies that if a\nconsumer is not satisfied with the services of his/her\nnetwork operator, then he/she may think of leaving that\nservice provider. Also, if consumers trust the products/\nservices of their current service provider, their inten-\ntion to switch that service provider is low. In this regard,\nAnton et al. (2007) revealed a significant relationship\nbetween low commitment towards service provider and\nswitching intentions. This explains that if consumers are\nhighly committed to their service provider, their inten-\ntion to leave that service provider is also low.\nThe direct effect of unfavourable prices on consumers'\nswitching intentions ( = 0.90) is significant and posi-\ntive, which also leads to the acceptance of this hypoth-\nesis (H4). Hence, when consumers are dissatisfied with\nthe value for money or perceive the price to be unfair,\ntheir intentions will be stronger to switch the service\nThe results of SEM analysis also depict that unfa-\nvourable reputation significantly affects consumers'\nswitching intentions ( = 0.91); therefore, H5 also\nstands accepted. Hence, consumers are more inclined\nto purchase the product/services of those companies\nwhom they perceive as having favourable reputation\namong their competitors (Nguyen & Leblanc, 2001).\nIt also becomes clear from SEM results that consumers'\npositiveATS significantly predicts their switching inten-\nof H6. This finds support from Bansal and Taylor (1999),\nwho stated that ATS was the most influential determi-\nnant of switching intentions. Hence, if a consumer is\nholding favourable ATS, he/she will be more likely to\nswitch his current service provider (Desbarats, 1983).\nThe model further explains that PEOU ( = 0.91) and\nPU ( = 0.86) significantly predict consumers' switching\nfrom one service provider to another, which supports\nH7. Thus, when consumers perceive the services of\ncurrent operator as easy to use, their intentions to\nleave the provider will be low and, in contrast, if they\nperceive that services are difficult to use, they intend to\nswitch current operator (Nysveen et al., 2005).\nThe SEM results also justify that lower SCs signifi-\ncantly lead to higher consumers' switching intentions\ndemonstrates that if SCs are low, consumers' switching\nintentions will be high. The direct effect of consumers'\nswitching intentions on ASW behaviour of consumers\nis also significant and positive ( = 0.59), which leads\nto the acceptance of H9. This implies that if consumers\nhave strong intention to leave their service provider,\nmay be because of low SQ, unfavourable prices, low\ncommitment, etc., they will definitely switch the current\noperator. The consequences of relationship efforts on\nconsumers' behavioural intentions can be viewed as\nsignals of retention or defection (Liang & Wang, 2007).\nAgain, it is clear from SEM analysis that consumers'\nswitching intentions negatively influence AST\nbehaviour of consumers or their loyalty with current\nacceptance of H10. If consumers are very much satisfied\nwith the quality and pricing of services, their intention\nto leave current operator decreases, which signifies\nconsumers' loyalty with their operator.\nHowever, SEM analysis depicts that except for\n`trust towards the service provider', other predic-\ntive switching factors do not significantly contribute\ntowards ASW and AST behaviour of consumers; hence\nH11a and H11b stand rejected. The results reveal that\npredictive switching factors do not have direct signif-\nicant effect on ASW or AST behaviour; this relation-\nship is fully mediated by the switching intentions\nof the consumers. On the contrary, Khan et al. (2010)\nstated that there was a significant relationship between\nunfavourable perception of price, unfavourable bank\nreputation, poor SQ, low SCs on the one hand and\nconsumers switching behaviour on the other. Further,\naccording to Holloway et al. (2009), following a failed\nservice recovery, consumers with high relationship\nquality would experience a greater decline in their\nintentions to repurchase from the service provider in\nthe future.\nAfter running SEM, it was found that the overall fit\nmeasures provided a good fit for the hypothesized\ncausal model (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988; Baumgartner &\nrange. The other indices like NFI, CFI, and TLI are all\nconcluded that the model exhibits a reasonable fit to\nthe data (Table 9).\nCONCLUSION\nThe availability of a number of subscriber options for\nconsumers and varied tariff rates of each player moti-\nvate the consumers to switch between service providers.\nMNP permits to switch operators without changing\nhis/her telephone number. The present study focuses\non consumers' switching intentions after the introduc-\ntion of MNP, factors affecting consumers' switching\nintentions, and also the relationship between switching\nintentions and ASW or AST behaviour of consumers.\nThe findings of the present study reveal that after the\nimplementation of MNP, consumers' switching inten-\ntions have not enhanced, as they appear to be satisfied\nwith the services of their current service provider; those\nwho have already switched, did so without MNP. Also,\nthe consumers, who intend to switch their operator in\nfuture, want to do so without MNP, as MNP involves\ntoo much cost, time, and effort.\nThe study findings also reveal that the factors such as\nSQ, RQ (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and commitment), price,\nreputation and image, ATS, PEOU and PU, and SCs\nsignificantly affect consumers' switching intentions\nPing, 1993). The study has also examined the relation-\nship between AAMNP application and switching inten-\ntions and the result finds no significant relationship\nbetween the two, a finding that is also supported by\nDurukan et al. (2011). Along with this, the study find-\nings demonstrate that various switching factors signif-\nicantly affect ASW and AST behaviour of consumers\nThe study suggests that consumers' switching intentions\npredict both ASW and AST behaviour of consumers.\nHowever, switching intentions better predict AST, that\nis, consumer loyalty, more than ASW behaviour. This\nimplies that even if consumers have intentions to switch\ntheir current operator, they would not switch because\nof SCs involved in terms of time, money, and effort.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Chuang (2011)\nwho found that SC was the most significant factor for\nretaining the subscribers. Thus, it can be concluded that\nwith the introduction of MNP, consumers' switching\nintentions have not increased and most of them want to\nremain with their current operator.\nIn order to develop socially desirable, legally justifiable,\nindustrially feasible, and economically viable policy,\nit is advised that regulators should not only enforce\nMNP, but they should try to reduce the switching\nbarriers and enhance consumers' awareness of MNP,\nso that subscribers can take advantage of this system.\nBy understanding consumers' switching intentions,\nregulators can ensure MNP's effective implementa-\ntion, which will also make it more convenient for end\nusers to switch current operator if the services do not\nmeet their expectations. Thus, government as well as\ntelecom operators should organize programmes, semi-\nnars, informative advertisements, and other commu-\nnication activities about the MNP system to help in\nshortening and simplifying the procedure of reaching\nthe MNP targets. The operators should open separate\ncounters in their retail outlets for providing informa-\ntion to each and every consumer about the benefits and\ncosts of MNP service.\nThe results of the study reveal that the factor contrib-\nuting more towards ASW is the `trust towards the\nservice provider'; therefore, the service provider\nshould extend consistent and reliable services so that\nthe consumers repose confidence in that network oper-\nator. Also these operators should resort to improving\nSQ, reducing prices (call rates), providing more value-\nadded services, etc., as a mechanism to retain the\ncurrent base of consumers. This shall also improve the\nfuture prospects of the service provider in the long run.\nDelaying tactics and other measures used by the operator\nto prevent the consumers from switching implies that he\nor she is not properly implementing the MNP services.\nThe government should issue show cause notice to these\noperators on violating the laws relating to MNP. TRAI\nshould identify some possible measures to improve\ncommunication between the parties involved in the\nMNP process. One way to improve this communication\nis to reduce the amount of messages being exchanged\nbetween the recipient and the donors, for example, by\ncombining execution and validation messages. The\nstudy also reveals that one reason why the consumers\nare not adopting MNP is the paper work involved that\nconsumes too much of their time. To avoid this problem,\nTRAI should define the stages in the porting process\nso that operators do not misuse their position to create\nunnecessary delays.At present, very few telecom compa-\nnies provide MNP services in India; hence, the govern-\nment should take necessary steps or frame strict policies\nregarding mandatory introduction of MNP. The adminis-\ntrative arrangement of the porting process should also be\ntaken up by the government, as administrative arrange-\nment is equally important like the technical arrangement,\nwhich includes porting time, porting charges, etc. Also\nthe poorly designed systems, which are very complex\nor easily abused, take away the benefits that the MNP\nis supposed to deliver. TRAI should also fix time limits\nfor the validation process, as majority of the respondents\nface problems because of the time-consuming process\ninvolved in porting. As the AAMNP is generated mainly\nthrough advertisements, friends, and relatives, it is advis-\nable that telecom operators should offer discounts and\nother incentives to the person who motivates his relatives\nand friends to avail MNP.\nThe present study demonstrates various factors\naffecting consumers' switching intentions; hence, the\noperators should attempt to strengthen these switching\nfactors in order to prevent customers from exiting.\nTelecom companies should train their sales personnel\nfor promoting new products or services, and educating\nand informing consumers about the new offerings so\nthat they can avail these services with proper informa-\ntion and knowledge.\nThe study is conducted with limited factors affecting\nconsumers' switching intentions, thereby excluding\nsome more factors, namely, attractiveness of alterna-\ntives, subjective norms, service affordability, promo-\ntional offers, etc. The results of the study indicate that\nmost of the consumers have switched from private\nnetwork operator to BSNL and would prefer to\nsubscribe to the services of BSNL in future. Therefore,\nresearch should be conducted to find out the reasons\nfor not trusting private network operators. Our current\nunderstanding of SCs is limited to the costs involved\nin switching from current service provider to the new\none. Future research should examine how costs associ-\nated with returning to the origin affect the decision to\nleave in the first place, especially in case of contractual\nagreements such as BSNL. The results also reveal that\nconsumers do not favour MNP for switching their oper-\nators because companies follow delaying tactics or do\nnot provide unique portability code. Therefore, another\nstudy should be conducted to investigate why compa-\nnies are not implementing MNP properly. The concept\nof portability has also been recently introduced in health\ninsurance sector. Therefore, all insurers issuing health\ninsurance policies will allow for credit gained by the\ninsured for pre-existing conditions in terms of waiting\nperiod when a policyholder switches from one insurer\nto another or from one plan to another, provided the\nprevious policy has been maintained without break.\nThus, future research can also be conducted in health\ninsurance sector.\nREFERENCES\nAaker, D.A., & Keller, K.L.
