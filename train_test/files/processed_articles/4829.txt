It is the Shepard tabletop illusion, in which the perspective view of\ntwo identical parallelograms as tabletops at different orientations gives a completely different\nsense of the aspect ratio of the implied rectangles in the two cases (Shepard 1990). In my\nversion of the illusion (figure 1) each tabletop is a 45 deg. parallelogram of equal height\nand width, as indicated by the rectangular boxes aligned with the corresponding sides; the\nboxes are all of the same size and shape. A parallel wood grain has been added to the two\nsurfaces, further enhancing the perceived discrepancy between the two shapes. \"The image\non the right was produced by a 45 deg clockwise rotation of the tabletop and the two boxes\nat left--but without rotating either the legs or the grain. The illusion is so strong that it is\nscarcely credible that the two tabletops are the same shape.\nFigure 1. The Shepard tabletop illusion, in which the two tabletops are parallelograms of exactly the\nsame shape at two different angles at 45 deg. to each other. The left-hand tabletop appears long and\nthin while the right-hand one appears approximately square, due to their perspective context. This\nillusion also has three previously unremarked aspects: the rear legs appear shorter than the front\nlegs (even though the backs appear wider than the fronts, especially when viewed close up), the two\ntabletops appear to slope down away from the center (even though the wood texture is parallel in the\ntwo surfaces), and the perceived depth is weak.\n2 Analysis\nNote that an incidental aspect of the Shepard tabletops is that the parallelogram construction\nmakes them subject to the well-known `inverse perspective illusion' of orthographic perspec-\ntive; although the oblique receding lines for the two sides are parallel, they appear to diverge\ninto the distance, giving the impression that the tabletops are getting wider as they recede in\ndepth. This widening occurs because the perspective context of the rest of the table gives the\nimpression that the tabletops are, indeed, horizontal receding surfaces, which generates the\nperceptual expectation that the sides should be converging to a single vanishing point. The\ndeviation from this expectation thus produces the impression of divergence, even though\nthe sides are actually parallel.\nInspection of figure 1 reveals three paradoxical properties of this illusion that have been\nunremarked both by Shepard and subsequent purveyors of the illusion.\n\u00b7 Paradoxical slant of the two tabletops.\n\u00b7 Paradoxical lack of perceived depth.\n\u00b7 Paradoxical distortion of the length of the rear legs.\nThe first paradox is that the two tabletops do not appear to be parallel horizontal surfaces.\nThe left-hand tabletop appears to be sloping down to the left, while the right-hand one\nappears to be sloping down somewhat to the right (especially when one focuses attention\nbetween the two tables). Thus, both tabletops seem to slope away from a high point of the\ncenter of the picture. Paradoxically, this effect is in the opposite direction from the classic\norientation induction of acute angle enlargement (Z\u00f6llner 1860; Blakemore et al 1970), in\nwhich the oblique edges would induce the horizontals to appear to slope up from the center.\nOne explanation for the primary illusion may be Gregory's (1963, 1990) concept of\nMisapplied Depth Constancy, which would take the form of the tabletop surfaces appearing\nlonger than their retinal projections because they are interpreted as surfaces receding in\ndepth, which would require that they were proportionately deeper in order to project to the\nphysical length of the obliques (which is 2 longer and 1/ 2 shorter than the front for the\nleft and right images, respectively). Since the right-hand table appears to be approximately\nsquare with a width of, say, 2 cm, the implication is that the depth angle of the table surface\nrequired to account for the illusory distortion is a rotation of about 45 deg. into the page,\nwhich in turn would imply that it has a perceived depth of 2\u00d7 2 = 2.928 cm. For the same\ndepth angle, the left-hand table would have a perceived depth of 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2 = 4 cm.\nThe second paradoxical aspect of the illusion is the apparent flatness of the appearance\nof the depictions. Although the table surfaces are seen as receding in depth, they do not do\nso to the logical extent of rectangular objects (whose physical depths would be about 4 and\n3 cm, respectively, for the left and right tables; see below). Instead, the perceived depth of\nthese images in real object terms is much flatter than this, and indeed may appear to be\nperfectly flat on the page to many observers. It seems curious, therefore, that the perspective\ndistortion seems so strong in the face of only a weak illusion of perceived depth.\nThus, the fundamental paradox of the perceived depth, and indeed of the Misapplied\nDepth Constancy theory in general, is that the illusory distortions seem to operate in a brain\nmodule independent of the one that delivers the sense of perceived depth. In many cases\nthe illusions explained by this theory have been susceptible to other explanations, with this\ndepth paradox weakening the explanatory power of the theory. In this case, however, the\nidentity of the surface shapes makes it difficult to argue for any other theory, so it seems that\nwe need to address the paradox head on.\nThere are several factors that might arguably mitigate the degree of depth perceived\nfrom the perspective implied by the oblique sides of the parallelograms, including the\nlack of convergence in their orthographic form of perspective, the invariance of the line\nParadoxes in the Shepard Illusion 139\nthickness, the uniformity of the overlaid texture, the flatness of the stereoscopic depth cues,\nthe knowledge that it is a printed image on a page, and so on. In the face of these cues,\ntherefore, it is more understandable that the perceived depth should be weak to nonexistent.\nThe paradox is that despite all these cues to flatness, the illusory distortion corresponds to a\ndepth angle as steep as 45 even without the corresponding depth percept.\nThe third paradoxical aspect of the Shepard illusion is that the rear legs of the tables\nappear to be shorter than the front legs. This effect seems to derive from a contrast with the\n`inverse perspective illusion' of the parallelogram shapes of the tabletops discussed above,\nmaking the tabletops appear wider at the back than at the front. Conversely, the rear legs\nof the tables appear shorter than the front legs, despite the fact that they are physically the\nsame length (and that they define similar parallelograms alongside those of the tabletops).\nThis apparent shortening of the rear legs seems to be induced in contrast with the apparent\nwidening of the back of the tabletop, despite the fact that the back is at the same perceived\ndistance as the rear legs. It is not obvious that this contrast should occur, since the bottoms\nof the legs are one edge of the vertical parallelogram defining the plane of the sides of the\ntables, which might be expected to show the same illusory expansion as the tabletop. One\nexplanation for the different perceptual treatment of the top and the sides may be that the\nillusory expansion depends on the presence of complete boundaries around the surfaces so\nthat the vertical parallelogram loses its effectiveness as a depth structure because the legs\nare seen as individual objects rather than components of a rectangular figure.\nFigure 2. Han Xi-zai Gives a Banquet (retouched sector of extended scroll); Gu Hong-zhong ( 950).\nSolid white construction lines reveal the strong dominance of parallelity within surfaces (orthographic\nperspective). Dashed white lines complete the implied surface where the chair and table legs meet\nthe floor. Though parallel between the two pairs of table legs, they show a pronounced lengthening of\nthe rear legs relative to the front legs in each case, violating the parallel requirement of orthographic\nperspective.\nAs mentioned, the parallel construction of Shepard's two tabletops implies that they are\nboth rendered in orthographic (`Chinese') perspective, which has been the dominant form\nof perspective representation in China (Osborne 1970), so we may expect to find similar\nillusions in Chinese paintings. A good example of the use of patches of oblique parallel\nperspective with angles is seen in the scroll Han Xi-zai Gives a Banquet ( ) by Gu\nHong-zhong ( ), (Five Dynasties period,  950). One section of the scroll (which\nhas been retouched for clarity in this reproduction) is shown in figure 2. The entire booth\nwith two seated personages and the long food table in front of it conform accurately to one\nset of parallels with no convergence. In fact, within any given surface, all the perspective\nlines in this painting conform to the principle of parallelity (solid white lines), including the\nimplied surface rectangles where the legs of tables or chairs meet the floor (dashed white\nlines).\nRemarkably, although the two sides of the foreground tabletop to the left are parallel, we\nfind that the legs are painted with a strong divergence of their parallels with respect to the\nones of the tabletop; the back legs are substantially longer than the front legs (as indicated by\nthe dashed white lines, which should be parallel to their counterparts in the corresponding\ntabletops). This is not just a lack of accuracy on the part of the painter, as the same effect is\nseen for the legs of both the chair in the foreground and the long table to the right. In each\ncase the back legs of the pair extend down further in the back than in the front, diverging\nfrom the angle of the tabletop. Somehow, Gu Hong-zhong must have seen this divergence\nbetween the leg angles and the top surface angle as the proper way to draw the perspective\nof a table (although I have not found any previous report of this effect in Chinese painting;\nNotice, however, that there is neither convergence nor divergence between the left and\nright pairs of legs of each table--these lateral obliques are perfectly parallel with each other\ndespite the divergence of the vertical angles. This distortion may be explained by the third\nunremarked aspect of the Shepard illusion--the induced shortening of the rear legs in\nopposition to the induced lengthening of the tabletop. Gu Hong-zhong's tendency to paint the\nrear legs of his tables longer than the front suggests that he is either intuitively painting them\nto look right visually without being aware of the rear-leg-shortening illusion or consciously\nlengthening them to counteract the illusion that he knows his viewers will perceive if all the\nlegs are painted the same length.\n3 Predictive Test\nAs with many illusory figures, this detailed analysis of the properties of the illusion reveals\na number of unremarked aspects of the perceived configuration, whose interpretation is\nsubject to further evaluation. The interpretation of the perceived shortening of the rear legs,\nand its (over)correction in the Chinese painting, for example, may be tested by replacing\nthe legs with solid sides. The prediction is that the solid sides should be subject to the same\nperceived expansion as the tabletops once the sides are completed into full parallelograms.\nThis prediction is tested in the depiction of the same table shapes from figure 1 as marble\nblocks in figure 3. The distortion effect of the horizontal surfaces remains just as strong in\nthis marble-block configuration, but it is immediately evident that the sides now also appear\nwider at the back than the front (the opposite effect from the shortening of the rear verticals\nwhen depicted as legs). Thus, we should expect that solid rectangular objects in Chinese\npaintings are not subject to the correction effect seen for the three tables, as is indeed the\ncase for the seating booth at the right in figure 2.\nFigure 3 also includes a verification that the primary illusion is not due to the orientation\nparallelogram of the top surfaces. The upper figure is a block-rotated version of the right-\nhand block with its surface parallelogram aligned with that of the left-hand block, showing\nthat the illusion persists even in the aligned orientation. This result verifies that the illusion\nis due to the perspective context of the other two sides.\n4 Conclusion\nIn summary, the interaction between the filled-in versus open forms of the parallelograms\nand the rear expansion of the orthographic perspective in the two versions of the Shepard\nillusion can explain the difference in treatment of the filled-in versus open forms in a Chinese\npainting from more than 1000 years ago. These results imply that the diverse aspects of the\nParadoxes in the Shepard Illusion 141\nFigure 3. This marble block version of the Shepard illusion is similarly subject to the perceived\ndifference between the horizontal surface shapes (compare left and right blocks) but reverses the\nshortening of the rear sides, which appear expanded at the rear once they are filled in as completed\nrectangles (especially when viewed close up). The upper figure is a block-rotated version of the right-\nhand block (red arrow) with its surface parallelogram aligned with that of the left-hand block (green\narrow), showing that the illusion persists even in the aligned orientation.\nillusion are not just attributable to the orientation relationships of the component lines but\nare significantly impacted by the degree to which the lines are incorporated into filled-in\nsurfaces.\nReferences\nBlakemore C, Carpenter R H, Georgeson M A, 1970 \"Lateral inhibition between orientation detectors\nGregory R L, 1990 \"How do we interpret images?\" in Images and Understanding Eds H B Barlow,\nC Blakemore, M Weston-Smith pp 310\u00ad330 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)\nOsborne H, 1970 The Oxford Companion to Art (Oxford: Oxford University Press)\nShepard R N, 1990 Mind Sights: Original Visual Illusions, Ambiguities, and other Anomalies (New\nYork: WH Freeman and Company)\nTyler C W, 2011 \"Chinese perspective as a rational system and its relationship to Panofsky's symbolic\nform\" Chinese Journal of Psychology\nZ\u00f6llner F, 1860 \"Ueber eine neue Art von Pseudoskopie und ihre Beziehungen zu den von Plateau\nPublished under a Creative Commons Licence\na Pion publication"
