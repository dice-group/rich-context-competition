We found that changes in macroeco-\nnomic conditions, rather than current conditions, affected harsh\nparenting, that declines in macroeconomic conditions had a stron-\nger impact on harsh parenting than improvements in conditions,\nand that mothers' responses to adverse economic conditions were\nmoderated by the DRD2 Taq1A genotype. We found no evidence\nof a moderating effect for two other, less well-studied SNPs from\nthe DRD4 and DAT1 genes.\nThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning,\nunjustified terror.\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt's opening\nremarks in his first inaugural address\ntraction in economic output in the United States since the\nGreat Depression. In this article, we examine the effects of the\nGreat Recession on harsh parenting, using data from the Fragile\nFamilies and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS). We extended prior\nwork by examining the effects of changes in macroeconomic\nconditions as well as current economic conditions, by examining\nboth declines and improvements in economic conditions, and by\ndetermining whether mothers' responses to economic conditions\nwere moderated by the DRD2 gene.\nThe family stress model, developed from studies of the Great\nDepression and the Iowa Farm Crisis, posits that economic\nhardship leads to stress, which, in turn, leads to deterioration of\nparental relationships, mental health, parenting quality, and,\nultimately, child wellbeing (1, 2). Associations consistent with the\nfamily stress model have been found in many other small samples\nthroughout the United States and Europe. Whereas most studies\nin this literature suffer from omitted variables bias--the effects\nof economic hardship are identified off differences between\nfamilies who do and do not experience large economic losses--\nmore recent studies have reported similar findings using more\nexogenous measures of economic conditions, e.g., plant closings\n(3, 4), changes in income transfer policy (5, 6), and unemploy-\nment rates (7, 8). We also used more exogenous measures and\nhypothesized that higher unemployment rates were associated\nwith higher levels of harsh parenting.\nStress may result not only from the actual experience of ad-\nversity but also from uncertainty and the anticipation of adver-\nsity. Mother monkeys parent less well--and their offspring do\nless well--when foraging in poor environments compared with\nrich environments. However, both mothers and offspring do\nworst when poor and rich environments are varied randomly,\nsuggesting that uncertainty or insecurity may be more stressful\nthan the actual experience of adversity (9, 10). Among humans,\nanticipation of adverse events with high salience is thought to\nelicit stress or anxiety as well as changes in decision making, risk\naversion, and aggression (11\u00ad14). Although the unemployment\nrate is a good indicator of the probability that an individual will\nbe unemployed, it may not fully capture the stress associated\nwith the anticipation of economic adversity. Hedonic adaptation\ntheory (15) suggests that the emotions elicited by any level of the\nunemployment rate depend upon the previous level. For exam-\nple, an unemployment rate of 8% will elicit hope and confidence\nif the previous rate was 10%, but fear and anxiety if the previous\nlevel was 6%. Similarly, an 8% rate will elicit greater fear and\nanxiety if the previous rate was 4% rather than 7% because the\nsize (or rate) of the change is much larger for the former than the\nlatter. Finally, research in behavioral economics demonstrates\nthat people's responses to losses are greater than their responses\nto gains of equal size (16, 17). Drawing on these ideas from the\nbehavioral sciences, we hypothesized that harsh parenting is as-\nsociated with both the direction and the rate of change in mac-\nroeconomic conditions and that declines in economic conditions\nhave larger effects on parenting than improvements in conditions.\nResearchers have long observed that individuals vary in their\nresponse to events such as job loss or worsening economic con-\nditions. Early psychological studies attributed such differences to\ntemperament or behavioral reactivity (18). More recently, the\nadvent of molecular genetics has allowed researchers to examine\ngenotypic variance to see whether individuals with certain ge-\nnetic profiles reacted more negatively than others when exposed\nto adverse environments (19). The concept of genetic vulnera-\nbility has recently been complemented by the concept of genetic\nsensitivity, which posits that individuals with certain genetic\nprofiles have worse outcomes in unfavorable social environments\nbut better outcomes in favorable environments (20\u00ad24). A com-\nmon criticism of this literature is that people may select their\nenvironments, meaning that gene-by-environment interactions\n(G \u00d7 E) may be due to gene-by-environment correlations (rGE)\nor gene-by-gene interactions (G \u00d7 G) (25). The Great Recession\nand changes in macroeconomic conditions more generally are\nbeyond the control of a particular individual and thereby provide\na more exogenous measure of the environment.\nThe dopaminergic system helps regulate emotional and be-\nhavioral responses to environmental threats and rewards. Low\nefficiency in this neural system has been shown to result in ag-\ngression, impulsivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(26\u00ad29). Of particular interest is the Taq1A single nucleotide\nUTR of the DRD2 gene. The T allele of this SNP eliminates the\nTaq1 site by replacing a cytosine base with a thymine base. Al-\nthough far from conclusive, research to date suggests that indi-\nviduals possessing at least one T allele have fewer D2 dopamine\nAuthor contributions: D.L., J.B.-G., S.S.M., D.N., and I.G. designed research; D.L., J.B.-G.,\nS.S.M., D.N., and I.G. performed research; D.L. and D.N. analyzed data; and D.L., J.B.-G.,\nS.S.M., D.N., and I.G. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Based on\nthese findings, we hypothesized that mothers' harsh parenting\nbehavior as a response to adverse macroeconomic conditions is\nmoderated by their DRD2 Taq1A genotype.\nThe FFS is a population-based, longitudinal birth cohort study\nand 2000 (31). By design, three fourths of the children in the\nstudy were born to unmarried mothers and one fourth to married\nmothers. Mothers were interviewed at birth and reinterviewed\nwhen the child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y old. Data on harsh parenting\nwere measured when the child was 3, 5, and 9 y old. In year 9, saliva\nDNA samples were collected from mothers using the Oragene\u00b7\nDNA sample collection kit (DNA Genotek) (details are available in\nSI Materials and Methods). The analytic sample with valid obser-\nvations on study variables contained 2,612 mothers (Table S1).\nMaternal harsh parenting was measured using 10 items from\nthe Conflict Tactics Scale (32). Five items measured psycholog-\nical harsh parenting, and five measured corporal punishment.\nSubscales were combined to construct a composite measure of\nmaternal harsh parenting (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75). Mothers'\nrisk of exposure to unemployment was measured by the city-level\nunemployment rates (UR). Anticipation of unemployment or\neconomic adversity was measured directly by the national con-\nsumer sentiment index (CSI) and indirectly by the rate and di-\nrection of change in UR and CSI. The national CSI is salient for\npredicting stress because of the ubiquity of television and other\nnational media. Further, because consumer sentiment is a lead-\ning indicator and unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of\nchanges in the business cycle, we included both indicators in our\nmodel. Levels of UR and CSI were measured at the time of in-\nterview and merged with the FFS data. The rate and direction of\nchange in UR and CSI were measured by computing the differ-\nence between the value at the time of interview and the 3-mo\nlagged value divided by the lagged value, and multiplied by 100.\nOrdinary least squares regression was used to estimate the\nassociation of maternal harsh parenting with macroeconomic\nconditions, DRD2 genotype, and their interactions. To test the\nhypothesis that declines in macroeconomic conditions have\na stronger impact on harsh parenting than improvements, we\nused a spline function, which allowed positive and negative\nchanges in each macroeconomic indicator to have their own\nslopes and converge at zero. We exploited multiyear variations in\nUR and CSI by pooling the FFS data from years 3, 5, and 9 (n =\n6,492 person-years). SEs were adjusted for within-individual\ncorrelation. All models controlled for age, race/ethnicity, immigra-\ntion status, educational attainment, poverty status, family structure,\nchild sex, and child age (in months) at the time of interview. We\nalso controlled for interview wave, quarter of interview month,\nand city of residence (analysis details are provided in Materials\nand Methods).\nResults\nTable 1 presents our main results. Column 1 shows the main\neffects of levels of and changes in macroeconomic conditions\n(Table S2). Deteriorations in macroeconomic conditions, indi-\ncated by positive changes in UR and negative changes in CSI,\nwere associated with increases in maternal harsh parenting. A\nten percent increase in UR led to a 1.6-unit increase in the\ndecrease in the CSI also led to a 1.3-unit increase in harsh\ncontrast, improvements in macroeconomic conditions, indicated\nby negative changes in UR and positive changes in CSI, were\nassociated with much smaller, statistically insignificant changes in\nharsh parenting (P = 0.83 and P = 0.43, respectively). Finally, the\nlevels of UR and CSI affected harsh parenting, but not in the\ndiscussed below, however, the level effects were not robust to\nmodel specification. In sum, harsh parenting was not positively\nassociated with high levels of unemployment but rather with\nincreases in the unemployment rate and declines in consumer\nsentiment, suggesting that the anticipation of adversity was a more\nimportant determinant of harsh parenting than actual exposure.\nColumns 2 and 3 of Table 1 present the full G \u00d7 E interaction\nmodel to test whether the association between macroeconomic\nindicators and harsh parenting varied by mothers' DRD2 Taq1A\ngenotype. The effect of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions\nwas more pronounced for mothers carrying a T allele than for\nmothers carrying the CC allele. For the T allele carriers, in-\ncreases in the UR and declines in the CSI strongly increased\nharsh parenting. A 10% increase in UR and decrease in CSI led\nP = 0.01, respectively). For the CC allele carriers, however, these\nchanges had inconsistent and insignificant effects. A 10% increase\nin UR and decrease in CSI were associated with a 0.8 increase and\nspectively). As a result, the effect of deteriorating macroeconomic\nconditions differed significantly between the T and CC allele\nTable 1.

Yes Yes Yes\nCity dummies? Yes Yes Yes\nCovariates? Yes Yes Yes\nBy contrast, the effect of improving macroeconomic con-\nditions on harsh parenting was less pronounced. For the T allele\ncarriers, improvements in UR and CSI reduced harsh parenting,\nbut the coefficients were smaller and not statistically significant\ncarriers, improvements in UR and CSI were associated with ei-\nther increases or decreases in harsh parenting, which were in-\nconsistent and insignificant (P = 0.15 and P = 0.63, respectively).\nOverall, these G \u00d7 E results lend support to our hypothesis. The\nfear of economic adversity, as indicated by deteriorating mac-\nroeconomic conditions, played a more critical role in parenting\nbehavior for mothers with a T allele of DRD2 Taq1A poly-\nmorphism than for mothers with the CC allele. We found no\nevidence of a moderating effect for two other, less well-studied\nSNPs from the DRD4 and DAT1 genes.\nBecause the results above were obtained by estimating the\neffects of changes in UR and CSI in the same model, it is difficult\nto interpret the model without considering all of the coefficients\nat once. In some situations, changes in UR and CSI could give\nconflicting signals about changes in the economy. To further\nexamine the implications of our G \u00d7 E model for genetic sen-\nsitivity, we used the coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 to\nsimulate the responses of mothers with a T allele and mothers\nwith the CC allele to unambiguous deteriorations and unambig-\nuous improvements in macroeconomic conditions. In Fig. 1,\npredicted harsh parenting is shown on the vertical axis and\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions are shown on the hori-\nzontal axis. Deteriorating and improving macroeconomic con-\nditions were measured (in percentile terms) as the distance from\nzero change (in the middle). Inspection of 95% confidence bands\nindicated that, for mothers with a T allele, harsh parenting clearly\nincreased as macroeconomic conditions worsened and decreased\nas macroeconomic conditions improved. By contrast, for mothers\nwith the CC allele, harsh parenting changed little if at all in re-\nsponse to changes in macroeconomic conditions. These results\nsuggest that the parenting behaviors of the T allele carriers were\nmore sensitive than those of the CC allele carriers to changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions.\nWe extended our analysis in nine ways. First, to further ex-\nplore heterogeneous effects by genotype, we reestimated our\nSI Materials and Methods). The effects of macroeconomic con-\nditions on harsh parenting did not vary by these two dopamine\nmarkers (Table S3 and Figs. S1 and S2).\nSecond, to the extent that the risk of experiencing unemploy-\nment is heterogeneous within the population and that individuals\nare aware of their differential risks, we should observe hetero-\ngeneity of response not only by genotype but also by differences\nin the risk or salience of adverse economic conditions across the\npopulation (33). Thus, we explored heterogeneity of response by\neducation, race/ethnicity, family structure, and child sex. For the\nfirst three characteristics, we found some evidence for hetero-\ngeneous responses, with responses being more negative for those\nmost likely to be adversely affected (Table S4).\nThird, the absence of a positive association between the level\nof the local UR and harsh parenting was surprising, and thus we\nextensively examined plausible alternative specifications to see\nwhether there was any evidence to support a positive and sig-\nnificant UR level effect (Table S5). With one minor exception,\nwe found no supporting evidence. Fourth, we investigated whether\nthe level effects of UR and CSI, which were in the unexpected\ndirection, were driven by their functional forms (Table S6). The\nlevel coefficients were indeed sensitive to alternative functional\nforms, suggesting that this effect should not be given much\nweight. Fifth, we examined whether the change coefficients were\nrobust to the exclusion of the UR and CSI level variables (Table\nS7). Excluding these variables did not alter our findings. Sixth,\nwe examined whether family income loss at the individual level\nwas associated with increases in harsh parenting and whether\ncontrolling for actual income loss affected our main results\n(Table S8). Although income loss at the individual level was\nassociated with increases in harsh parenting, especially for the T\nallele carriers, the association was puzzling, as larger losses did\nnot lead to harsher parenting. Seventh, we examined whether our\nresults might be strengthened if we used employment-population\nratios rather than unemployment rates (Table S9). The results\nwere consistent with, but a little weaker in significance than, those\nin Table 1. Eighth, we examined whether our results were sen-\nsitive to our treatment of mothers who moved to a different city\nduring the study (Table S10). Accounting for mothers' cross-city\nCC\nT\nFig. 1. Differential harsh parenting responses to deteriorating and improving macroeconomic conditions (measured as percentile changes) by the DRD2\nTaq1A polymorphism.\nmoves did not change the results. Ninth and lastly, we examined\npsychological harsh parenting and corporal punishment sepa-\nrately (Table S11). Both sets of results were consistent with those\nusing the composite measure of maternal harsh parenting.\nDiscussion\nThis paper extends prior work by examining the relationship\nbetween adverse macroeconomic conditions and maternal harsh\nparenting. Because the Great Recession and other more mod-\nerate changes in macroeconomic conditions are exogenous to the\nindividual, our approach allowed us to address shortcomings in\nthe literatures on both the family stress model and the genetic\nsensitivity model. We found that the rate and direction of change\nin macroeconomic conditions rather than actual conditions af-\nfected harsh parenting, and that declines in conditions had a\nstronger impact on parenting than improvements in conditions.\nWe also found that mothers' responses to changes in economic con-\nditions were moderated by their genetic profiles, such that mothers\nwith the \"sensitive\" genotype did worse than their counterparts in\na deteriorating economy and better in an improving economy.\nAlthough we found no evidence that the level of the local UR was\npositively associated with harsh parenting, caution is warranted in\ninterpreting this finding. Actual reductions in income between\ninterviews did result in greater harsh parenting. The strong effects\nfor the Taq1A polymorphism of the DRD2 gene should also be\ninterpreted with caution insofar as we found little effect for other\ndopamine genes that were plausible candidates. More research is\nneeded to disentangle the complex pathways through which a vari-\nety of genetic markers in the dopaminergic system operate together.\nFinally, although our findings are consistent with the argument that\nuncertainty and anticipation of adverse conditions are mechanism\nthrough which a deteriorating economy leads to aggressive par-\nenting, these constructs were not directly measured in this study.\nNonetheless, we provide strong evidence that changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions, rather than current conditions, af-\nfect harsh parenting, that declines in macroeconomic conditions\nhave a stronger impact on harsh parenting than improvements in\nconditions, and that mothers' responses to adverse economic\nconditions are moderated by the DRD2 Taq1A genotype. These\nfindings demonstrate the importance of attending to the non-\neconomic costs of macroeconomic changes, population hetero-\ngeneity in response to macroeconomic shocks, and exogenous\nmeasurement of environmental stressors in G \u00d7 E research.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe FFS is a national longitudinal birth cohort study that follows 4,898\nto unmarried parents (31). They represent children born in 20 large US cities\ninterviews were conducted shortly after the birth, with mothers interviewed\nin the hospital and fathers interviewed either in the hospital or wherever\nthey could be located. Follow-up surveys were conducted when the focal\nchild was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y of age. In year 9, saliva DNA samples were collected\nfrom mothers using the Oragene\u00b7 DNA sample collection kit (DNA Genotek)\nand retained at room temperature until DNA extraction (laboratory of D.N.,\nPrinceton University, Princeton, NJ) according to the protocol supplied by\nthe manufacturer. The analytic sample consisted of 2,612 mothers who (i)\nwere interviewed at least once during the years 3, 5, and 9 surveys, (ii)\nprovided usable saliva during the year 9 survey, and (iii) had valid obser-\nvations on study variables (details on variable construction and dopamine\ngenetic variation are provided in SI Materials and Methods). For access to the\nFFS data, visit www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/index.asp. The study pro-\ntocol was approved by the institutional review board of Princeton University\nand informed consent was obtained in line with the study protocol.\nWe conducted our analysis by estimating two models. The first model\nexamined the effect of macroeconomic conditions on harsh parenting. To test\nthe hypothesis that declines in macroeconomic conditions have a stronger\nimpact than improvements, we applied a spline function to the measures of\nchanges in the local UR and the CSI (34). It allowed deteriorating and im-\nproving changes in each macroeconomic indicator to have their own slopes\nand at the same time their effects to converge at zero. To exploit multiyear\nvariations in UR and CSI, we pooled the FFS data from years 3, 5, and 9 with\nSEs adjusted for within-individual correlation. The equation for the model\nis given by:\nCEit\nLEit\n+ cXit\n+ dWaveit\n+ eSeasonit\n+ fCityi\n+ \u00abit\nwhere MHPit\nis mother i's harsh parenting score in year t, CE denotes de-\nteriorating and improving changes in UR and CSI, LE denotes levels of UR\nand CSI, and X is a vector of the control variables described above. We in-\ncluded in the model interview wave-, season-, and city-fixed effects to rule\nout the possibility that periodic, seasonal, and geographical variations\ncould induce a spurious association between macroeconomic conditions\nand harsh parenting.\nThe second model examined the G \u00d7 E effect on harsh parenting of mac-\nroeconomic conditions and DRD2 Taq1A genotype. We used the full interaction\nG \u00d7 E model such that Eq. 1 was estimated separately for mothers carrying a T\nallele and for mothers carrying the CC allele. We found that the effect of de-\nteriorating macroeconomic conditions differed significantly between mothers\ndition, among mothers carrying a T allele, the effect of deteriorating macro-\neconomic conditions, indicated by positive changes in UR and negative changes\nin CSI, differed significantly from that of improving macroeconomic conditions,\nP = 0.001). However, among mothers carrying the CC allele, the effect of de-\nteriorating macroeconomic conditions did not differ significantly from that of\nThe simulation results in Fig. 1 were derived as follows. To calculate the\npredicted values of harsh parenting from our G \u00d7 E model in Table 1, levels\nof UR and CSI were set to their mean values and all covariates to their ob-\nserved values. To plot the predicted values when macroeconomic conditions\ndeclined, deteriorating changes in UR and CSI were assigned to their per-\ncentile values whereas improving changes in UR and CSI were assigned to\nzero. Conversely, to plot the predicted values when macroeconomic con-\nditions improved, improving changes in UR and CSI were assigned to their\npercentile values whereas deteriorating changes in UR and CSI were assigned\nto zero. We plotted these predicted values on harsh parenting against changes\nin macroeconomic conditions with 95% confidence bands.\n"
