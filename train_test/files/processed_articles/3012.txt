Jacobson, MD; Godfrey G. Griffiths, BComm(Hons); Cristina Varas, MD, MS;\nDouglas Gause, DrPH; Jennifer C. Y. Sung, PharmD; Christie M. Ballantyne, MD\nBackground: When the National Cholesterol Educa-\ntion Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) guide-\nlines were published, National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nestimate the number of Americans requiring lipid-\nlowering therapy based on ATP II cut points. However,\nthe guidelines recommend using clinical judgment to de-\ntermine whether to initiate drug therapy in individuals\nwhose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels re-\nmain above treatment goals with diet therapy but below\nthe initiation level for drug therapy.\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey III data, based\nestimate the numbers of American adults with an el-\nevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and re-\nquiring drug therapy using cut points vs clinical judg-\nment as specified in ATP II guidelines.\nResults: Assuming a 10% low-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol reduction with diet, an estimated 10.4 million\nAmerican adults require drug therapy based on ATP II\ncut points. If we include individuals for whom the guide-\nlines recommend clinical judgment, the estimate in-\ncreases to 28.4 million. The largest increase occurs in in-\ndividuals without known coronary heart disease but with\nhigh-risk individuals have low-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol concentrations similar to those in patients with\ncoronary heart disease.\nConclusions: Since the ATP II guidelines were pub-\nlished, clinical judgment has been informed by abun-\ndant clinical trial evidence establishing the safety\nand benefit of lipid-lowering therapy. The large number\nof individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease em-\nphasizes the need for cost-effective therapy to extend\ntreatment to the greatest number of individuals who may\nbenefit.\nWHEN THE second\nAdult Treatment\nPanel (ATP II) of\nthe US National\nCholesterol Educa-\ntion Program published its report1,2 in\nthe third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) were\nused to estimate the prevalence of hyper-\ncholesterolemia as defined in the revised\nguidelines,3 based on the ATP II cut points\nfor initiation of diet and drug therapy\n(Table 1).

To assess potential nonresponse bias for LDL-C level,\nthe weighted distributions of individuals in the selected\nsample, individuals in the interviewed sample, and indi-\nviduals with and without LDL-C values in the fasting morn-\ning subsample for various demographic and health-\nrelated factors were obtained.11 To estimate the total number\nof participants with an elevated cholesterol level who might\nrequire lipid-lowering drug therapy, we considered 4 sce-\nnarios in which dietary intervention would uniformly re-\nsistent with previous analyses conducted by Sempos et al.3\nIn addition, we examined the percentage reduction in LDL-C\nlevel required by individuals qualifying for drug therapy\naccording to the ATP II guidelines, assuming a 10% reduc-\ntion in LDL-C level with dietary therapy.

Since the ATP II guidelines and the\nprevious NHANES III report on prevalence of hypercho-\nlesterolemia were published in 1993, clinical trial data\nhave dramatically changed evidence-based clinical judg-\nment. When the guidelines were developed, most of the\npublished clinical trials of lipid-lowering drug therapy\nused agents with low efficacy and adverse effect profiles\nthat limited compliance; because these agents were not\nshown to improve total mortality, questions remained\nabout the relative benefit vs risk of using drug therapy\nto lower elevated LDL-C levels. Accordingly, the ATP II\nguidelines recommended the use of clinical judgment to\nweigh \"potential benefit, possible side effects, and costs\"\nin determining whether to initiate drug therapy in pa-\ntients with LDL-C levels between the cut points for diet\nand drug therapy.2(pO-8) Subsequently, however, the use\nof statin therapy has become widespread, and long-term\ndata have become available, establishing the safety and\nenhanced efficacy of the statins. In 5 major clinical event\ntrials enrolling almost 31 000 patients, the benefits of\nstatin therapy on CHD morbidity and mortality have\nbeen demonstrated in primary and secondary preven-\ntion in patients with a broad range of LDL-C levels be-\nfore therapy. Patients with severely elevated LDL-C\nlevels were examined in the secondary prevention Scan-\ndinavian Simvastatin Survival Study12 with simvastatin\nand in the primary prevention West of Scotland Coro-\nnary Prevention Study13 with pravastatin sodium. Pa-\ntients with mildly to moderately elevated LDL-C levels\nwere studied in the secondary prevention Cholesterol and\nRecurrent Events trial14 and in the Long-Term Interven-\ntion With Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease study,15 both\nwith pravastatin, and in the primary prevention Air Force/\nTexas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study16 with\nlovastatin. In all these studies, statin therapy produced\na consistent reduction in relative risk for coronary events\nwithout any significant increase in noncardiovascular\ndeath, cancer, myopathy, or transaminase elevations\ngreater than 3 times normal. Similarly, in angiographic\ntrials of statin therapy, CHD progression has been shown\nto be significantly reduced with therapy not only in pa-\ntients with severely elevated LDL-C levels but also in pa-\ntients whose LDL-C level was only mildly to moderately\nelevated.17 Taken together, these clinical trial results have\ndemonstrated that patients with a range of CHD risk pro-\nWithout CHD and\nWith <2 RFs\nWithout CHD and\nWith 2 RFs\nWith CHD Total\nBroad Application\nConservative Application\nFigure 2.

The present guidelines fo-\ncus heavily on LDL-C level rather than the absolute risk\nof the individual; after trichotomizing patients into 3 broad\nrisk categories, the ATP II guidelines use LDL-C level as\nthe basis for determining the initiation and monitoring\nthe effectiveness of treatment. However, the absolute risk\nfor a CHD event may be higher in an individual with 3\nrisk factors and an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL\n(4.14 mmol/L) than in an individual with no other risk\nmmol/L). In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention\nStudy, men aged 55 to 64 years without a previous myo-\ncardial infarction had CHD event rates of 1% or less per\nyear if they only had a high LDL-C level, whereas their\nevent rates were higher than 2% per year if they also had\nany one of the following risk factors: minor electrocar-\ndiographic abnormalities, preexisting vascular disease,\ncurrent smoking, HDL-C level less than 43 mg/dL (1.11\nmmol/L), hypertension, or family history of premature\nCHD.19 As we look ahead to ATP III, the inclusion of\nabsolute risk, as in other national20 and international21\nguidelines, may help identify high-risk patients.\nLimitations of the NHANES III data likely led to un-\nderestimation of the number of high-risk patients.

Furthermore, per-\nsons with CHD may have been misclassified in the ab-\nsence of a validating clinical diagnosis or if the presence\nof other atherosclerotic disease was not ascertained.24\nOverall, these biases likely resulted in an underestima-\ntion of the numbers of people in the higher-risk groups\nwho require therapy to lower LDL-C levels under the ATP\nII guidelines.\nAlthough the ATP II algorithm for primary preven-\ntion weights all risk factors equally, recent studies sug-\ngest that some risk factors, such as diabetes or low HDL-C\nlevel, may confer greater risk than other risk factors. Dia-\nbetic patients without known CHD have been reported\nto have the same incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocar-\ndial infarction as patients with known CHD.25 Among in-\ndividuals with 2 or more risk factors, a larger percent-\n(Table 4), and as noted the actual number of diabetic in-\ndividuals is likely higher than the estimates reported\nherein because individuals unable to provide a fasting\nblood sample have been excluded. In the Scandinavian\nSimvastatin Survival Study26 and the Cholesterol and Re-\ncurrent Events trial,27 patients with diabetes had the high-\nest absolute risk for CHD events, and lipid-lowering\ntherapy produced greater absolute risk reductionsforclini-\ncal events in diabetic patients than in patients overall.\nDespite the increased incidence of diabetes among Mexi-\ncan Americans, high-risk Mexican Americans, most of\n4.13 mmol/L) (Table 4), may be less likely to be recom-\nmended for drug therapy than other ethnic groups.

Par-\nticularly in individuals with a borderline LDL-C level, a\nlow HDL-C level may greatly increase the risk for CHD.\nIn the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study,29\nconducted in patients with CHD and a mildly to mod-\n4.91 mmol/L), patients with a baseline HDL-C level less\nthan 35 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L) had more angiographic\nprogression than patients with a higher HDL-C level; how-\never, patients with a low HDL-C level also had more ben-\nefit from lipid-lowering therapy with fluvastatin so-\ndium. In a number of trials that used diverse methods to\nidentify high-risk subgroups that may receive the most\nbenefit from therapy, including ultracentrifugation to mea-\nsure intermediate-density lipoprotein and very LDL,30 LDL\ndensity measurement,31 apolipoprotein and lipoprotein\nparticle assessment,32 and LDL-C cut points in patients\nwith hyperapolipoprotein B-100,33 the high-risk group\nwas also characterized by a lower HDL-C level. In the Air\nForce/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study,\nconducted in patients with below-average HDL-C levels\n[1.22 mmol/L] in women), benefit on first major coro-\nnary event was similar across all tertiles of baseline\nHDL-C level, although patients in the lowest tertile\nwere at the highest absolute risk; among patients as-\nsigned placebo, an estimated 6.7% with baseline HDL-C\nlevels of 34 mg/dL or less (0.89 mmol/L) had events\ncompared with 4.1% with HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or\ngreater (1.02 mmol/L).16 Although overall relative\nrisk reductions in the statin trials were impressive, the\nwide range of absolute risk reductions and numbers\nneeded to treat highlight the importance of treating pa-\ntients according to their absolute risk.34 Relatively\nsimple tools to assess the absolute risk for CHD are\navailable, such as the most recent Framingham algo-\nrithm, which includes categorical variables for age,\nblood pressure, and diabetes and smoking status, as\nwell as LDL-C and HDL-C levels.35 Targeting therapy to\nthose most likely to receive benefit would also allow for\nmore cost-effective treatment.\nWith the accumulation of clinical trial evidence, the\nissues surrounding lipid-lowering drug therapy have\nshifted from scientific questions regarding efficacy to cost-\neffectiveness concerns.36 With the increasing number of\nindividuals who may benefit from therapy comes the\ngrowing problem of allocation of resources. To extend\ntreatment to the largest number of individuals who might\nbenefit, algorithms have been devised to maximize cost-\neffectiveness by targeting high-risk patients, improving\ntreatment efficacy (including increased compliance to diet\nand exercise), and minimizing the cost of therapy.34 The\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is sponsoring\na large prospective study that should provide better in-\nformation not only on the predictive value of newer di-\nagnostic tests for detecting subclinical CHD but also on\nthe cost-effectiveness of these tests. Another important\nmeans of reducing the cost of treatment is to match\ntherapy to the patient by using less expensive agents when\nthey are sufficient to achieve LDL-C targets. The subset\nof individuals without known CHD but with multiple risk\nfactors and mildly to moderately elevated LDL-C levels\nrepresents the largest segment of the US adult popula-\ntion needing lipid-lowering therapy by either a broad or\na conservative application of clinical judgment. Most of\nthese patients need only moderate LDL-C reductions to\nachieve goal: based on the latest NHANES III data, 91%\nof patients with multiple risk factors but without docu-\nmented CHD could reach the ATP II goal with only a 30%\nor less reduction in LDL-C level. Advances in evidence-\nbased medicine, which extend the benefit of lipid-\nlowering therapy to patients with mildly to moderately\nelevated LDL-C levels, provide the necessary basis for in-\nformed clinical judgment as recommended in the ATP\nII guidelines.\nThis study was supported by an Established Investi-\ngator Award from the American Heart Association, Dallas,\nTex(DrBallantyne),andbyanonrestrictededucationalgrant\nfrom Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Ha-\nnover, NJ.\nWe thank Margaret D.
