This study is important because\nthe results of earlier studies concerning\nthe outcome of frozen shoulder in patients\nwith diabetes are very controversial.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nWe obtained permission to perform this\nstudy from the ethics committee of the\nstudy's hospital district and followed the\nguidelines of the Helsinki declaration. All\nparticipants provided written informed con-\nsent before participation. This research\nreceived no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-\nprofit sectors. The authors declare no con-\nflict of interest in preparing this article.\nPatients and study design\nTwo of the authors (M.V. and H.V.) retro-\nspectively identified 231 patients with spon-\ntaneous idiopathic frozen shoulder seen by\npathic frozen shoulders); 27 (15%) of these\npatients (29 shoulders) had diabetes. The\naverage follow-up time was 9.7 years (SD,\n7.1 years). The inclusion criteria were no\ntrauma or only very minor shoulder trauma,\nmarked loss of active and passive shoulder\nmotion (forward flexion 135, abduc-\ntion 135, restriction in external rotation),\nnormal findings in a true anteroposterior\nradiograph of the glenohumeral joint and no\nsuspicion of rotator cuff tear at the first\nconsultation. The exclusion criteria were\nintrinsic glenohumeral pathology, such as\nglenohumeral arthritis or rotator cuff tear; a\nhistory of substantial shoulder trauma; pre-\nvious or subsequent shoulder surgery; reflex\nsympathetic dystrophy of the ipsilateral\nhand; previous or subsequent fracture of\nthe same shoulder area; and insufficient\nmedical records (no degrees of ROM men-\ntioned). The patients' basic characteristics\nare shown in Table 1. Of the 27 patients,\nmellitus (17 shoulders) and 11 used no insulin,\nand 1 patient with diabetes used only dietary\ntreatment. The mean age of all patients at the\nyears) (with diabetes, 50 years; without dia-\nflexion of 135 while their shoulder was\nfrozen.\nunderwent MUA. The other 88 shoulders\nunderwent either conservative treatment or\nbilateral frozen shoulders (2 patients with\ndiabetes) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The\nright shoulder was involved in 43% of\ntheir onset of symptoms to some kind of\nprovocative action, such as throwing a rope.\nClinical evaluation\nInitial evaluation included a detailed\nmedical history, physical examination, and\nanteroposterior radiographs. Most patients\nhad already undergone shoulder radiographs\nbefore the first consultation. No subjective\nassessment occurred at this initial evaluation.\nEach of the 178 patients underwent a phys-\nical examination by an independent observer\n(H.V.) at the final follow-up similar to that in\nthe first consultation. The observer assessed\nshoulder function with the Constant\u00adMurley\nscore and shoulder strength by manual\nmuscle testing; strength in abduction was\nassessed using a Salter spring balance up to\nof a painful arc sign was indicated by ``yes''\nor ``no.'' Additionally, a true anteroposterior\nradiograph of the index shoulder was taken\nin external rotation.\nQuestionnaire survey\nPatients received questionnaires25 before the\nfinal follow-up. The questionnaires assessed\ndemographics and symptoms of the once-\nfrozen shoulder, including pain evaluation on\na visual analogue scale (VAS) (range, 0\u00ad10;\n0\u00bc no pain to 10\u00bc maximal imaginable\npain). Additionally, patients received the\nSimple Shoulder Test. The Ethics Committee\nof Helsinki University Hospital District\nStatistical analyses\nDifferences in age, follow-up time, and\nROM while the shoulder was frozen and\nduring follow-up between patients with\nand without diabetes and between patients\nwith insulin-dependent and non-insulin-\ndependent diabetes were determined using\na t-test; differences in dichotomous variables\nwere evaluated with Pearson's chi-square test.\nDifferences in shoulders between patients\nwith and without diabetes were assessed by\na paired-sample t-test. The statistical signifi-\ncance threshold was set at p < 0.05 (two-\ntailed). All statistical analyses were performed\nwith SPSS software (version 23.0; IBM Corp.,\nArmonk, NY, USA).\nResults\nROM\nROM while the shoulder was frozen at the\nsame mean disease stage (8 vs. 7 months\nfrom onset of symptoms) was not signifi-\ncantly different between the 29 shoulders in\npatients with diabetes and 169 shoulders in\npatients without diabetes (Table 2). At the\nfinal follow-up, ROM of the affected shoul-\nders in patients without diabetes improved\nto the contralateral healthy level, but ROM\nof the affected shoulders in patients with\ndiabetes remained below the contralateral\nlevel of patients without diabetes (p < 0.001\u00ad\nsignificantly different between the affected\nand contralateral unaffected shoulders in\npatients with diabetes. The mean difference\nbetween the ROM in the affected and\nunaffected shoulders in patients with dia-\nbetes was 5 in flexion, 5 in abduction, 1 in\nexternal rotation, and 0 (no difference) in\ninternal rotation.

However, they had\nsignificantly worse inferior external rotation\nat the follow-up (p \u00bc 0.035). Other outcomes\nwere similar between patients with insulin-\ndependent and non-insulin-dependent\ndiabetes.\nThree patients with diabetes (11%) had a\nfollow-up ROM (flexion \u00fe abduction \u00fe\n190); one of them had internal rotation to\nthe L4 level, and the other two had internal\nrotation only below the buttock.

Radiological\nfindings such as cystic degeneration or scler-\notic change at follow-up were not correlated\nwith diabetes.\nDiscussion\nMost of the findings in the present study\nsupport our hypothesis regarding the out-\ncome of frozen shoulder in patients with\ndiabetes. We hypothesized that their out-\ncome would be similar to that of patients\nwithout diabetes. While the shoulder was\n11 months from onset of symptoms, shoul-\nder ROM was similar between patients with\nand without diabetes. Likewise, Cinar et al.3\nfound no significant differences in the pre-\noperative functional scores between these\ngroups of patients with frozen shoulder.\nIn the present study, the follow-up ROM\nin patients with diabetes was inferior to that\nof patients without diabetes in all directions.\nAccording to Griggs et al., 4 diabetes in\npatients with frozen shoulder is associated\nwith worse outcomes in terms of ROM. The\nresults of arthroscopic capsular release for\nfrozen shoulder in patients with diabetes are\nalso worse in terms of ROM.3 Mehta et al.8\nreported significant improvement (p < 0.01)\nin the modified Constant scores following\narthroscopic release for frozen shoulder in 21\npatients with diabetes and 21 patients with-\nout diabetes. The patients with diabetes had\nsignificantly worse outcomes than those with-\nout diabetes 6 months postoperatively\n(p < 0.01) with a tendency toward persistent\nlimitation of movement 2 years postopera-\ntively. Patients with diabetes reportedly also\nhave inferior results after open surgical\nrelease.9 At follow-up in the present study,\nhowever, the ROM of our patients' once-\nfrozen shoulder reached the same level as their\nunaffected shoulder. The ROM in the frozen\nshoulder was not inferior to that in their own\nunaffected shoulder. This is the main finding\nin the present study that differs from the\nresults of other studies. We found no other\nstudies that compared the outcome ROM\nbetween the once-frozen and unaffected\nshoulder in the same patients with diabetes.\nMany studies have shown that diabetes is\nnot a risk factor affecting either the objective\nor subjective outcome of frozen shoulder\nDu\n\u00a8 zgu\n\u00a8 n et al.14 found no significant differ-\nences in ROM, functional activity status,\npain level or muscle strength before and\nafter rehabilitation between 12 frozen shoul-\nders in patients with diabetes and 38\nfrozen shoulders in patients without dia-\nbetes. In other studies, diabetes did not\naffect the outcome after arthroscopic capsu-\npatients treated operative and nonopera-\ntively.17 Some authors, however, report\nconflicting results.27,28 In the present study,\nthe ROM in patients with diabetes recovered\nto the ROM level of their own contralateral\nshoulder, but not to the ROM level of that in\npatients without diabetes.\nPatients with insulin-dependent diabetes\nare more likely to require arthroscopic\nrelease than are patients with non-insulin-\ndependent diabetes.29 In the present study,\ninsulin-dependence showed no effect on\nflexion or abduction while the shoulder\nwas frozen or on the outcome of pain or\nfunction; however, the outcome of external\nrotation was inferior. If a patient's history of\ninsulin-dependent diabetes is >10 years,\nonly about 25% of patients partially\nrespond to manipulation alone.30 However,\nthe duration of diabetes in the patients of the\npresent study is unknown.\nIn one study, pain was present in 26% of\npatients with diabetes but in no patients\nwithout diabetes.3 In another study, the\naverage VAS pain score was 4.3 among\npatients with diabetes and 1.1 among those\nwithout diabetes after open surgical release.9\nIn the present study, the outcome concerning\npain was similar between patients with and\nwithout diabetes at rest and during the night,\nbut was slightly worse during exertion.\nWith respect to function, one study\nshowed that the average Constant\u00adMurley\nscore was 82 in patients with diabetes and 94\nin patients without diabetes (p < 0.05).3\nOther studies showed average American\nShoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder\nThe Constant\u00adMurley scores in the present\nstudy were in accordance with our hypoth-\nesis. However, patients with diabetes self-\nevaluated their function as being inferior to\nthat of controls in the Simple Shoulder Test.\nFrozen shoulder (patients) with diabetes\nmellitus have a more severe course and more\nresistance to treatment compared to (general\nproportion of patients with diabetes was\nmuch greater than that of patients without\ndiabetes among those who developed recur-\nrence after MUA. One-half of the patients\nwith insulin-controlled diabetes and one-\nquarter of those with non-insulin-controlled\ndiabetes required a second MUA.11 The\noutcomes of MUA in the present study,\nhowever, do not support this. Patients with\ndiabetes also reportedly have inferior results\nafter open surgical release,9 and one study\nshowed that patients with diabetes had\nslower postoperative functional recovery\nduring the first 12 months following arthro-\nscopic capsular release.33\nWe acknowledge that the present study\nhas limitations. First, we did not obtain the\nConstant\u00adMurley scores or the Simple\nShoulder Test scores when the patients\nwere initially examined. However, ROM\nand strength measurements were available.\nSecond, we presented pooled data compris-\ning 45% patients not yet appearing in the\nliterature. We consider this adequate, how-\never, because the purpose of the earlier\npapers was not to compare patients with or\nwithout diabetes and because our study\nschedule was similar for all patients.\nThe mean follow-up time in the 12 studies\nthat showed no effect or a questionable\neffect of diabetes on the outcome of frozen\npatients per study. The 3 studies2,6,8 that\nreported inferior results of frozen shoulder in\nVastama\npatients with diabetes had a mean follow-up\ndiabetes. Our clinical follow-up time was\n9.9 years among 29 shoulders in patients\nwith diabetes. We found no studies exceed-\ning our clinical follow-up time or exceeding\nour number of frozen shoulders in patients\nwith diabetes. Jenkins et al.7 reported the\n3.4-year outcome for 22 diabetic patients\nwith frozen shoulder in a questionnaire\nstudy with a mean clinical follow-up time\nof only 3 weeks.\nIn terms of what this study adds to existing\nknowledge, we have shown that the follow-\nup ROM of the once-frozen shoulders in\npatients with diabetes reach the same level as\ntheir own unaffected shoulders. Additionally,\nwe have confirmed the results of some other\nauthors showing that there are otherwise no\ndifferences in outcomes in frozen shoulders\nbetween patients with and without diabetes.\nThis leads us to believe that frozen shoulder\nactually heals as well in patients with diabetes\nas in patients without; other diabetes-related\nfactors appear to cause joint mobility to\nworsen over time in this patient population.\n"
