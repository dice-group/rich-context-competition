Three different protocols were used to assess anxiety: (1) evaluation of the response\nto a human in the cat's home room (home room test); (2) analysis of the response to placement in an empty test\nroom (open-field test); and (3) analysis of the response to an unfamiliar human (human interaction test). All three\nprotocols were first run at baseline, and the results were used to assign the animals to control and test diet groups\nthat showed equivalent fear and anxiety. Both groups were retested on the three protocols after 2 weeks (test 1)\nand again after 4 weeks (test 2).\nResults The diet groups differed for two behavioral measures in the open-field test: inactivity duration and inactivity\nfrequency. The control group showed statistically significant increases in inactivity duration between baseline and\ntest 1 and baseline and test 2, while the group fed the test diet showed a marginally not significant decrease in\ninactivity duration between baseline and test 1 and a not significant decrease for test 2. There was also a significant\nincrease in inactivity frequency between baseline and test 1 in the test diet group and marginally not significant\ndecrease in the control group. There were no differences between groups in the approach of the cats toward people\nfor the home room test and the human interaction test.\nConclusions and relevance These results suggest that the test diet reduced the anxiety response to placement in\nan unfamiliar location, but that fear in the presence of an unfamiliar person was not counteracted by the diet.\n1CanCog Technologies, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2Royal Canin, Guelph, Ontario, Canada\n3Vivocore, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n*Current address: CanCog Technologies, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nGary Landsberg BSc, DVM, DACVB, DECAWBM-CA, Veterinary\nBehaviourist, CanCog Technologies, Toronto, Ontario, M5A 4K2,\nCanada\nEmail: garyl@cancog.com\nOriginal Article\nand lack of control that might be expressed as hyper-\nvigilance, restlessness, escape or avoidance, circling,\nyawning, lip licking and distress vocalization.1,2,4\nPharmacological therapy, in combination with envi-\nronmental and behavioral modification, is often indi-\ncated to deal with the problem and address the wellbeing\nof the pet. To date, however, no pharmacologic thera-\npeutics have been approved for the treatment of fear and\nanxiety in cats. While a variety of natural products claim\nto be effective in reducing anxiety, these claims have not\nbeen comprehensively assessed.\nRoyal Canin Feline Calm is an alpha(a)-casozepine\nand L-tryptophan supplemented balanced diet. Both\nnutrients have been reported to have anxiolytic effects.7\u00ad9\nTryptophan is an essential amino acid and the metabolic\nprecursor to melatonin and serotonin (5HT) that has been\nimplicated in the regulation of many behavioral pro-\ncesses, such as mood, aggression and susceptibility to\nstress.10\u00ad13 L-tryptophan has been evaluated in the treat-\nment of behavior disorders in cats including signs of\nrepetitive behavior, vocalization and agonistic behaviors.8\nHowever, supplementation with L-tryptophan alone may\nnot be effective, because of limitations in its ability to pass\nthrough the blood\u00adbrain barrier as it competes with other\nlarge neutral amino acids for a common transporter.\nTherefore a lowered level of large neutral amino acids in\nrelationship to tryptophan may increase tryptophan avail-\nability, leading to increased 5HT synthesis in the brain.13\na-casozepine is a bioactive peptide originating from a\nS1 casein, a protein in cow's milk, which has an affinity\nfor gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the\nbrain. It is reported to have an anxiolytic effect similar to\nbenzodiazepines, with none of the side effects such as\nincoordination and disinhibition of aggression.9,14,15\nBeata et al reported that fear of strangers, contact with\nfamiliars, general fears, fear-related aggressions and\nautonomic disorders were all significantly improved.9 In\na recent study, the `Calm' diet was found to reduce uri-\nnary cortisol and increase the plasma tryptophan/large\nneutral amino acid ratio; however, no behavioral changes\nwere observed. In that study, all enrolled cats were per-\nceived to be normal, which limited the possibility of\nobserving a reduction in stress.16\nThe purpose of the present study was to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the Royal Canin Feline Calm diet (test\ndiet) in reducing fear and anxiety in cats in an open-field\ntest (OFT) and a human interaction test (HIT). We have\npreviously demonstrated that cats that exhibit fear of\npeople show greater inactivity in an OFT than non-\nfearful cats, and that inactivity in cats with mild fear of\npeople is intermediate.6 In the HIT, non-fearful cats had\nsignificantly shorter and more frequent bouts of inactiv-\nity than either mildly fearful or highly fearful cats.\nTreatment with diazepam caused a reduction in inactiv-\nity in both the OFT and HIT.6 Therefore, in this study we\nselected cats that had been categorized as either fearful\nor mildly fearful.\nMaterials and methods\nExperimental design\nA parallel group design was used to evaluate the anxio-\nlytic effectiveness of the test diet. At baseline, physical\nexamination, complete blood count, biochemical profile\nand urinalysis were all within normal limits. Cats were\nfed twice daily in separate feeding cages. Each cat was\ngiven a measured amount of the prescribed food calcu-\nlated for its optimum weight. All cats were initially\nplaced on the control diet (Purina Cat Chow) for 2 weeks\nof adaptation, after which they were tested in the home\nroom, OFT and HIT over three consecutive days. These\nbaseline data were used to place subjects into two groups\nthat showed equivalent fear and anxiety. One group was\nthen switched to test diet and the other maintained on\ncontrol diet for the following 4 weeks. Subjects were\nretested on the three tasks after 2 and 4 weeks.\nAll procedures were approved by the animal use and\ncare committee and were conducted in accordance with\nthe guidelines set forth by the Canadian Council on\nAnimal Care. The facility is a licensed animal research\nfacility under the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Farms\nand Rural Affairs.\nSubjects\nThe subjects were 24 domestic shorthair cats (five males;\n19 females) from the Vivocore colony, ranging in age\nfrom 4\u00ad12 years. Cats were selected from the population\nof fearful and mildly fearful cats as described in our ini-\ntial study6 (Table 1).\nTest protocols\nThree different test protocols were conducted to assess\nmeasures of fear and anxiety. The first involved charac-\nterizing the cat's response to an unfamiliar person enter-\ning their home room (home room test).6 The second\n(OFT) examined the cat's response to placement in an\nempty test room. The final protocol examined the cat's\nresponse to placement in the test room with an unfamil-\niar person (HIT). Both the OFT and HIT have been previ-\nously described.6\nHome room test\nAll cats had been categorized using a home room test as\ndescribed in our model development study.6 Home room\nassessment was performed by the first author (GL), a vet-\nerinary behaviorist with whom the cats had minimal\nfamiliarity. Briefly, the cats classified as fearful had been\nobtained approximately 6 months earlier from a research\nfacility in which they had been identified as fearful. These\ncats were housed together and continued to actively\navoid their caregivers. In the home room test, they\nactively avoided and displayed threats if approached.\nThe other cats were intermixed in various housing rooms.\nThe cats were assessed as non-fearful if they would vol-\nuntarily approach or did not withdraw when approached\nand would solicit or accept physical contact (touch,\nstroke) without signs of fear or avoidance. Those cats that\nwould allow approach but would withdraw when con-\ntact was attempted were considered mildly fearful, and\nthose cats that actively avoided approach or displayed\nsigns of threats or aggression were considered fearful.\nNon-fearful cats were excluded from the study.\nOpen-field test\nThe OFT was conducted over 10 mins in a dedicated room\ncameras for recording movement, with one of the cameras\nset up to also record audio. The behavioral measures were\nrecorded with the use of a behavioral tracking system,\nEthoVision XT (Noldus). Behavioral measures included:\ndistance traveled; duration and frequency of inactivity,\ndefined as when an animal was sitting or lying down or not\nexhibiting any overt behavior; and vocalization frequency.\nHuman interaction test\nIn the HIT, a person unfamiliar to the cat was seated on\nthe floor in the center of the room before entry of the cat.\nFor each test a different person was used but the same\nperson was used for all cats at each test. The person was\ninstructed not to wear any perfume or cologne. During\nthe test the person was instructed not to move, look\ndirectly at the animals or make any attempt to elicit\nattention. The human interaction was conducted over\n10 mins and we recorded the same behavioral measures\nthat were assessed in the OFT. In addition, we quantified\nfrequency and time spent in proximity to the person\n(within 0.5 m) and in contact with the person.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Statistica\nversion 11.0 software package with significance set to\nP <0.05. Analysis of data obtained during the treatment\nphase for each measure for measures that were common\nto both the OFT and HIT was based on a repeated meas-\nures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with time of test\n(baseline, test 1 and test 2) and task (open field and\nhuman interaction) as within-subject variables and both\ngroup (control, treatment) and level of fear (mildly fear-\nful, fearful) as the between-subject variables. For all\nanalyses in which the tasks were compared, task (open\nfield vs human interaction) was added as a second\nwithin-subject variable. For the home room test data,\ntask was not included as a main effect in the RMANOVA.\nTable 1 Subjects and allocation\nIdentification Test group Age Sex (neuter status) Anxiety status\nHerman Control 5.45 M (n) Fearful\nKatniss Control 5.63 F (n) Fearful\nLarisa Control 4.56 F Mildly fearful\nLily Control 9.70 F (n) Mildly fearful\nMaddox Control 4.33 M (n) Mildly fearful\nMelanie Control 4.25 F Mildly fearful\nMimi Control 4.42 F Mildly fearful\nMina Control 5.86 F (n) Fearful\nMoon Control 4.25 F Mildly fearful\nPoppins Control 6.18 F Mildly fearful\nSlash Control 5.51 M (n) Fearful\nAndrew Treatment 4.38 M (n) Mildly fearful\nAya Treatment 5.51 F (n) Fearful\nDelta Treatment 4.30 F (n) Mildly fearful\nGael Treatment 5.45 M (n) Fearful\nIris Treatment 5.53 F (n) Fearful\nJackie Treatment 6.18 F (n) Mildly fearful\nLacey Treatment 6.17 F Mildly fearful\nMarissa Treatment 4.42 F Mildly fearful\nMasha Treatment 6.17 F Mildly fearful\nMilly Treatment 4.42 F Mildly fearful\nPrudence Treatment 5.51 F (n) Fearful\nRuby Treatment 4.42 F Mildly fearful\nn = neutered\nPost-hoc analyses were carried out using Fisher's least\nsignificant difference test.

We then\nused the Dunnett test to compare baseline with test\nsessions for both the control and treatment group. The\nanalysis revealed a statistically significant decrease\nbetween baseline and test 1 (P = 0.05) and a marginally\nnot significant decrease between baseline and test 2\n(P <0.09) for the animals on the control diet, and a non-\nsignificant increase for the animals on the test diet. Figure 1\nshows that these results reflect reduced activity with\nrepeated testing in control group, but not in the group with\nthe test diet. In the HIT there were no significant changes.\nInactivity duration\nThere were two significant effects. The first was a signifi-\nP <0.01) and the second was a significant three-way\ninteraction between time of test, task and group\ndue to a significantly (P <0.01) lower overall inactivity\nTable 2 Home room measures\nGroup  Time of testing\nBaseline Test 1 Test 2\nTable 3 Open-field measures\nTime of testing Group  Distance Inactivity Vocalization\n(m) Duration (s) Frequency Frequency\nduration in the mildly fearful animals (M = 474.11, SEM\n= 22.707). The origins of the three-way interaction were\ndue to open-field inactivity decreasing on the first test\nsession in the test diet group, but increasing in the con-\ntrol group. In the HIT, inactivity went down in both\ngroups on test session 1.\nTo further analyze the data we then looked at the OFT\nseparately using an RMANOVA comparing the groups\nat each of the three time points. There was a significant\nsignificant time of test by group interaction (F[2,42] =\ntest revealed that the anxiety effect in the open field was\ndue to fearful cats having a greater inactivity duration\ncompared with mildly fearful (P <0.05).\nTo assess the origins of the interaction we first looked\nat the Tukey HSD test and compared each score with\nevery other score. None of the differences achieved sta-\ntistical significance. In order to assess potential trends,\nwe then examined the data using the Fisher multiple\ncomparison test. This revealed statistically significant\nincreases in inactivity duration between baseline and\ntest 1 for the control animals (P <0.05). By contrast, the\ntest diet group showed a marginally not significant\ndecrease between baseline and test 1 (P <0.07). For test 2\nthere was a significant increase from baseline in\ninactivity in the control group (P <0.05) while the test\ndiet group maintained a non-significant decrease in\ninactivity (Figure 2).\nInactivity frequency\nThe results of the analysis of inactivity frequency revealed\na statistically significant effect of level of fear (F[1, 21] =\ninteraction between time of test, task and group (F[2,42] =\ntion we compared inactivity frequencies separately in the\nOFT and HIT using an RMANOVA. The results of the\nANOVA in the OFT demonstrated a significant effect of\ninteraction between time of test and group (F[2,42] =\nthat the anxiety effect in the open field was due to mildly\nfearful cats having a greater inactivity frequency com-\npared with fearful cats (P <0.05). For post-hoc analysis of\ngroup effects, we first compared means for each of the\ngroups at each time point using the Tukey HSD test,\nwhich did not reveal any statistically significant differ-\nences. Next, to determine whether there were any clear\ntrends we used the Fisher LSD test; the group effect due to\nan increase in inactivity frequency between baseline and\ntest 1 for the test diet group was P <0.05 and was non-\nsignificant for test 2, while the control group showed a\nmarginally not significant decrease at test 1 P <0.08 and\nnon-significant decrease at test 2 (Figure 3). For the HIT,\nthere were no significant differences.\nVocalization frequency\nThe results revealed a significant main effect of task\nFigure 1 Distance traveled in open-field task as a function of treatment and session. On the control diet there was a statistically\nsignificant decrease (P <0.05) between baseline and test 1 and a marginally not significant decrease (P <0.09) between\nbaseline and test 2. By contrast, cats on the test diet showed a non-significant increase\nmain effects or interactions. Figure 4 shows that the task\neffect reflected greater vocalization in the OFT than in\nthe HIT, which is consistent with the findings in our\nmodel development study.6\nFigure 3 Inactivity frequency in open-field task as a function of treatment and session. Inactivity frequency was significantly\nincreased (P <0.05) in test 1 and non-significantly in test 2 for the test diet, while the control diet had a marginally not\nsignificant decrease (P <0.08) at test 1 and a non-significant decrease at test 2\nFigure 2 Inactivity duration in open-field task as a function of treatment and session. Inactivity duration significantly (P <0.05)\nincreased from baseline to test 1 in control cats while test diet cats showed a marginally not significant decrease (P = 0.07).\nFor test 2 there was a significant increase (P <0.05) from baseline in the control group and a non-significant decrease in the\ntest diet group\nAdditional measures for the human interaction test\nFor each of the HIT sessions, there were four measures\nrelated to frequency and duration of approach and con-\ntact. For each of the measures, the data were negatively\nskewed because a large percentage of animals in both\ngroups showed no contact and no approach (4/12 con-\ntrol and 6/12 treatment) (Table 4). Since the score distri-\nbutions violated the assumptions necessary for use of\nparametric statistics, the group comparisons were made\nwith the Mann\u00adWhitney U-Test, which did not reveal\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the effective-\nness of a diet supplemented with L-tryptophan and\n-casozepine (Royal Canin Feline Calm diet) with a\ncontrol diet in reducing fear and anxiety in cats that\nshowed fearfulness to people.6 We looked at three\ndifferent test protocols: (1) response to an unfamiliar\nenvironment (OFT); (2) response to an unfamiliar person\n(HIT); and (3) assessment of fear in the home room\n(home room test).\nBehavioral measures of fear and anxiety were based\non activity, inactivity and vocalization, which were\nquantified using a behavioral tracking system. In the\nHIT, we also monitored time spent close to and in con-\ntact with the person.\nFor the inactivity measures in the OFT, the group on\nthe control diet showed increases in inactivity compared\nwith baseline while the group on the test diet showed\ndecreases, which resulted in significant interactions\nbetween group and time of test. Although the paired\ncomparisons using the more conservative Tukey HSD\ntest did not reveal statistically significant differences\nfrom baseline, the Fisher multiple comparison test found\na statistically significant increase over baseline on both\nthe first and second treatment test in the control group.\nBy contrast, the group fed the test diet showed a margin-\nally not significant decrease between baseline and the\nfirst OFT and a non-significant decrease in test 2.\nSimilarly, for distance traveled there was a significant\ndecrease in distance traveled at test 1 in the control group\nand a non-significant increase in the test diet group.\nThe other measure that showed sensitivity to the test\ndiet in the OFT was inactivity frequency. This is a meas-\nure of the number of times that an animal stops moving\nand then restarts; the results parallel the inactivity dura-\ntion data, with the test diet group showing a significant\nincrease in inactivity frequency over baseline at test 1\nand the control group a marginally not significant\ndecrease.\nGiven the link between inactivity in an unfamiliar\nenvironment and anxiety, these results provide potential\nevidence of the anxiolytic effectiveness of the test diet.\nThese findings are consistent with the effects seen with\ndiazepam treatment in our previous study, in which\ninactivity duration was significantly decreased and inac-\ntivity frequency increased6 (Figure 5).\nThere were no significant effects of diet in the HIT.\nGiven the results from the OFT, this absence of signifi-\ncant effects in the HIT may reflect a selective benefit of\nthe test diet in reducing anxiety, but not fear. Similarly,\nFigure 4 Vocalization frequency in open-field and human interaction tests. Vocalization frequency was significantly greater\n(P <0.005) in the open-field test than the human interaction test\nwe have previously shown that in the HIT, the anxiolytic\ndrug diazepam did not promote approach to humans in\nfearful cats.6\nThe decline in vocalization frequency from the OFT to\nthe HIT in both groups is consistent with our previous\nstudy, in which much higher levels of vocalization were\nseen in the OFT than the HIT. One possible interpreta-\ntion is that the presence of the person increased fear,\nwhich reduced vocalization.6\nWe also found differences in fear level with mildly\nfearful cats when compared with fearful cats, showing a\ndecrease in distance traveled and inactivity duration,\nand greater inactivity frequency. This result replicates\nour previous observation in which fearful cats were\nmore inactive than non-fearful cats, with mildly fearful\ncats intermediate.6\nWe interpret these results to indicate that the effec-\ntiveness of the test diet in reducing overall anxiety is\nprobably limited to moderate anxiety-provoking situa-\ntions. The absence of an effect on the fear response in\nthe presence of an unfamiliar person may indicate a\ndissociation between reducing anxiety associated with\nan unfamiliar location but not in reducing the fear\ntoward an animate stimulus. Another possibility is that\nthe cats used in this study, which were pre-selected\nbased on a fearful response to people, may have been\ntoo fearful for the diet to effect any improvement.\nSimilarly, in our previous study fearful cats given diaz-\nepam spent the greatest time away from an unfamiliar\nperson. Therefore a future study might be designed\nto evaluate a greater number of cats using cats that\nare minimally fearful or non-fearful in the home room\nTable 4 Human interaction test measures\nTime of testing Group  Proximity to person Contact with person\nDuration (s) Frequency Duration (s) Frequency\nFigure 5 Comparison of effects of diazepam and Royal Canin Feline Calm diet on open-field inactivity duration. Inactivity\nduration showed a marginally not significant decrease (P = 0.07) after 2-week treatment with test diet while the control group\nsignificantly increased (P <0.05) (left). Similarly, inactivity duration decreased significantly after diazepam therapy (right)\nassessment. In addition, as a previous study with\na-casozepine found that some cats improved in the sec-\nond month of treatment, further studies might consider\na longer course of therapy.8\nAs the test diet is supplemented with both a-casozepine\nand L-tryptophan, the present results do not distinguish\nwhether the beneficial effects are a result of either of\nthese alone, or the two in combination.\nConclusions\nThese results are suggestive of an anxiolytic effect of the\nRoyal Canin Feline Calm diet to placement in an unfa-\nmiliar location based on a reduction in inactivity dura-\ntion and increased inactivity frequency in the Calm diet\ncompared with an increase in inactivity duration and\ndecreased inactivity frequency in the control diet. Future\nstudies of longer duration might further confirm the\neffect of the diet on fear and anxiety.\nSupplementary material Raw data for the open-field test-\ning from which Table 3 was compiled.\nConflict of interest Gary Landsberg, Dr Milgram, Christina\nde Rivera and Stephanie Kelly do not have any potential con-\nflicts of interest to declare other than providing the research for\nthis study as contracted by Royal Canin.
