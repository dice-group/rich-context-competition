The propor-\ntion of people with diabetes with poorly\ncontrolled BP declined considerably be-\never, in recent studies using the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nveys (NHANES) data, no improvements\nin BP levels among adults with diabetes\nupdated prior studies with the most re-\nlevels among U.S. adults with diagnosed\ndiabetes.\nMETHODS--We analyzed data from\n20 years or older with self-reported diag-\nnosed diabetes (regardless of hyperten-\nsion status). We used an average of up\nto three BP readings to determine an\nindividual's BP level. After excluding peo-\nple with missing BP values (n = 192),\n3,255 people were included in final anal-\nysis.\nOur outcome measures included BP\ndistributions, mean systolic BP (SBP) and\ndiastolic BP (DBP), and the proportion\ndefine categories for BP distributions, we\nadopted a method applied by Cheng et al.\nBP distribution of the study population;\nnext, we equally divided the BP values\ninto nine intervals; we then conducted\nmultiple categorical logistic regression to\nobtain the predicted percentage in each\nBP category for each study period adjust-\ning for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.\nHypertension was defined as SBP\nself-reporting of taking antihypertensive\nmedications. Among those with hyperten-\nsion, participants were considered aware of\nhypertension status if they answered\nthat they had been told that they had hy-\npertension; those who reported taking\nantihypertensive medications were con-\nsidered under treatment, and those with\nwere considered to have BP in control.\nData analyses were performed using\nand hypertension prevalence, awareness,\ntreatment,andcontrolratewereage-adjusted\nlation. We used t tests to assess differences\nin means and rates between time periods.\nA P value , 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nRESULTS--Figure 1 depicts shifts in\nboth SBP and DBP distributions toward\ncentage in either period had DBP $90\nmmHg.\nc c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c\nFrom the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Diabetes\nTranslation, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nCorresponding author: Jing Wang, zrr4@cdc.gov.\nThis article contains Supplementary Data online at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official\nposition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u00a9 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

Several\nfactors could explain the poor levels of\ncontrol in younger patients, including a\nlower adherence to medications (13); a\nlower tendency to receive treatment in-\ntensification (14); and less optimal care\nfor hypertension, i.e., delayed initiation\nof pharmacotherapy when lifestyle inter-\nLimitations of our study include the\nrelative small samplesizes for young adults,\nwhich may limit our ability to detect small\nchanges.
