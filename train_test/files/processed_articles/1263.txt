Studies show that remaining socially integrated\nthrough life course challenges has substantial health bene-\nfits. These benefits have been attributed to a range of pro-\ncesses, from the provision of social support to a sense of\nbelonging and self-esteem (Berkman & Glass, 2000; House,\ntologists therefore stress the importance of continued social\nintegration via volunteering, religious participation, group\ninvolvement, family relations, and social network connect-\nedness (Adams & Blieszner, 1995; Antonucci & Akiyama,\nOf the many forms of social integration that scientists can\nconsider, social network connectedness--a concept which\nencompasses many structural features--may be the most\ndifficult to measure thoroughly. It requires consideration\nnot only of one's connectedness to other people but also of\nthose persons' connectedness to each other. Unfortunately,\nthere is a lack of such social network data from representa-\ntive samples of older adults.\nThis paper describes the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project's (NSHAP) social network module and\nthe resulting data. In-home interviews were conducted by\na nationally representative sample of 3,005 community-\ndwelling adults between the ages of 57 and 85 years. The\nsample was selected using a multistage area probability de-\nsign, with oversampling among older men, Blacks, and His-\npanics. The weighted response rate was 75.5%. (For a\ncomplete description of the NSHAP sample design, see the\npaper by O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, & Smith [in press].)\nHere, we outline the rationale behind the types of social net-\nwork data the NSHAP study collected and the procedures\nused to collect them, describe key features of social net-\nworks which are likely to be relevant to aging and health,\nand present some preliminary findings regarding features of\nolder adults' social networks.\nMeasuring Social Networks in a National\nSurvey\nThe first step in collecting social network data is to iden-\ntify--for each respondent (referred to as ego)--the relevant\nset of individuals (referred to as alters) and the types of re-\nlationships that connect them (Laumann, Marsden, &\nPrensky, 1983). Many researchers who wish to study social\nnetworks begin with a preidentified set of roles (e.g., family,\nfriends) and assume that the people occupying those roles\nrelative to ego are the most relevant. For example, a com-\nmon approach in the health literature is to count the number\nof people occupying such roles, often restricting attention to\nindividuals with whom ego interacts frequently face-to-face\nSocial Networks in the NSHAP Study: Rationale,\nMeasurement, and Preliminary Findings\nBenjamin Cornwell,1 L. Philip Schumm,2 Edward O. Laumann,3 and Jessica Graber4\n1Department of Sociology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.\n2Department of Health Studies and 3Department of Sociology, University of Chicago, Illinois.\n4National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland.\nObjectives. This paper describes the rationale behind the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project's (NSHAP)\nsocial networks module, data collection procedures, and the measurement of several egocentric network properties. This\nincludes a discussion of network size, composition, volume of contact with network members, density, and bridging po-\ntential. Data on the extent to which older adults involve network members in personal health matters are also discussed.\nMethods. Descriptive statistics are presented for key network measures. Sociodemographic distributions of these mea-\nsures are presented. Older adults' likelihood of discussing health with network members is also broken down by network\nmember characteristics.\nResults. Older adults tended to have large, kin-centered, dense networks, with some bridging potential. Network\ncharacteristics were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and health. Older adults tended to be very likely to\ninvolve network members (especially close ties) in health discussions and medical decision making.\nDiscussion. The data reiterate the relevance of social networks to older adults' health. We close by discussing how the\nNSHAP measures might be employed in future analyses of health.\nKey Words: Aging--Health--Medical decision making--Social integration--Social networks.\n(e.g., Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, & Gwaltney, 1997;\nsee also the description of this approach in Berkman and\nKawachi, 2000). However, there are two serious limitations\nto this approach. First, it does not allow ego to specify the\nkinds of contacts that are most important to him or her. Sec-\nond, measures of network connectedness that are collected\nin this manner are sensitive to more general forms of social\nintegration. For example, if coworkers are counted in a so-\ncial network index, employed individuals will automatically\nhave larger networks. This makes it difficult to discern the\nunique impact of social network connectedness specifically,\nas opposed to broader aspects of social integration.\nIn order to avoid these limitations, NSHAP utilized a\nmodule that permits each respondent to identify several net-\nwork members of relevance to him or her and obtains infor-\nmation about these people and the relationships among\nthem. In the case of a national survey with tiny sampling\nfraction, individual respondents are unlikely to be directly\nconnected to each other, and it would therefore be of little\nvalue (not to mention impractical) to collect \"sociocentric\"\nnetwork data describing respondents' network connections\nto each other (e.g., Christakis & Fowler, 2007). Rather, the\ntask becomes to identify a set of persons around each re-\nspondent and describe the relationships that link them to the\nrespondent and to each together. This provides a \"local\"\nsample from the larger social network that encompasses\nego. Network data collected in this way are referred to as\negocentric. An egocentric network consists of k actors, in-\ncluding ego and a set of k - 1 alters. The network can be\nrepresented by a k \u00d7 k matrix in which the element in the rth\nrow and cth column describes the relationship from indi-\nvidual r to individual c. Further discussion of issues in-\nvolved in measuring social networks in the context of\nsurveys can be found in Laumann and Schumm (1997).\nThe NSHAP Social Networks Module\nTo collect egocentric network data, NSHAP adopted an\napproach developed by social network researchers which\ninvolves using questions called name generators to permit\nthe respondent to enumerate relevant alters (for a review of\nresearch using this approach, see Marsden [1990]). The NS-\nHAP networks module was located at the beginning of the\nin-home interview. (For more information on the structure\nof the interview, see the discussion of the interview of Smith\net al. [in press]. The questionnaire [along with the data] may\nbe obtained from the National Archive of Computerized\nData on Aging [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACDA/].)\nThe networks module was introduced to respondents in\nthe following way: \"Now we are going to ask you some\nquestions about your relationships with other people. We\nwill begin by identifying some of the people you interact\nwith on a regular basis.\" Because NSHAP was interested in\nassessing several types of network members, there were\nfour \"rosters,\" or lists of people, in the networks module: A,\nB, C, and D. Roster A was focused on collecting data on\nrespondents' core confidantes. To this end, following the\nterviewers asked respondents to list people with whom they\ndiscuss \"important matters.\"\n\"From time to time, most people discuss things that are\nimportant to them with others. For example, these may in-\nclude good or bad things that happen to you, problems you\nare having, or important concerns you may have. Looking\nback over the last 12 months, who are the people with whom\nyou most often discussed things that were important to you?\n(Prompt if do not know: This could be a person you tend to\ntalk to about things that are important to you.)\"\nRespondents could name up to five people; those who\nnamed five were then asked if there were any others. Thus,\nwe can discern if their networks contain anywhere from\nzero to \"six or more\" contacts.\nThe \"important matters\" item is a well-established name\ngenerator for network studies in sociology. It elicits names\nof strong, frequently accessed, long-term confidantes (see\npressures and social influence are likely to operate. Studies\nbased on this question have yielded important insights about\nsocial contacts who are particularly influential in adults'\nRosters B, C, and D capture other potentially important\nnetwork members. When respondents who had a spouse or\nromantic partner did not include that person in Roster A,\nthat individual was then recorded in Roster B. Following\nthis, respondents were asked: \"(Besides the people you al-\nready listed), is there anyone (else) who is very important to\nyou, perhaps someone with whom you feel especially\nclose?\" If such an individual was identified, he or she was\nrecorded in Roster C. This item was added to ensure inclu-\nsion of important social contacts that may not have been\ncaptured by the main name generator. Finally, any remain-\ning household members not captured in Roster A, B, or C\nwere added to Roster D. The NSHAP network data are pro-\nvided in a dyad-level file in which each row contains infor-\nmation about a specific network member for a given\nrespondent (i.e., multiple rows per respondent).\nTable 1 displays the distributions of the number of alters\nidentified in each of the rosters. All together, there are\nters from Roster A. About 15% of the sample (455 respon-\ndents) added a spouse or partner in Roster B. Over half of\nthe sample (1,633 respondents) claimed to have at least one\nother person to whom they are \"especially close,\" beyond\nthe network members already mentioned. The final column\nshows that 85% of respondents reported no additional\nhousehold members beyond those named in preceding ros-\nters. The remaining 15% added a total of 848 household\nmembers in Roster D. Only 28% of respondents reported\nliving alone.\nIt is important to note that the social networks module\nwas incorporated into the NSHAP interview in such a way\nas to avoid a potential deficiency in the General Social Sur-\nvey (GSS) network data. Marsden (2003) found substantial\nbetween-interviewer variation in the number of alters\nnamed by GSS respondents--as large as or larger than dif-\nferences associated with respondent characteristics. This\nhigh degree of between-interviewer variability may have\nbeen partly due to the fact that the GSS networks module\nappeared in the middle of the interview. Differences be-\ntween interviewers in the manner in which the module was\npresented (e.g., the extent to which it was rushed, the will-\ningness to clarify or probe, etc.) combined with factors\nsuch as respondent fatigue may have reduced the number of\nalters cited by some respondents. Furthermore, survey con-\ntent which precedes questions about alters can affect inter-\npretations of the name generator (Bailey & Marsden, 1999;\nfecting the number of alters named. The NSHAP networks\nmodule was positioned at the beginning of the interview to\navoid these problems.\nFollowing the enumeration of alters, NSHAP collected sev-\neral pieces of information about each alter from respondents\n(such items are known as name interpreters). First, following\nthe GSS and many other egocentric studies, we asked the\nrespondent to describe his or her relationship to each alter\n(e.g., kin, friend) and the alter's gender. For alters in Rosters\nA\u00adC, we recorded whether the alter lives with ego (to permit\nconstruction of a complete household roster), ego's frequency\nof contact with and emotional closeness to alter, ego's likeli-\nhood of discussing health matters with alter, and the alter's\nfrequency of contact with each of the other alters listed in\nRosters A\u00adC (this provides a basis for assigning values to the\nelements in the egocentric network matrix described earlier).\nWe also asked the age of all alters who live with ego. This in-\nformation is summarized in Table 2; we now consider each\nitem in greater detail.\nSocial Network Measures\nIt is important to consider a variety of measures of social\nnetwork connectedness as both structural and emotional\naspects of networks are likely to be associated with health\nat older ages. In the following sections, we discuss several\naspects of network connectedness that may be related to\nolder adults' health. Descriptive statistics for each measure\nare presented in Table 3 separately according to several so-\nciodemographic characteristics. Trend tests were conducted\nto assess whether the distribution of each network\ncharacteristic was uniform across groups. (Each network\nTable 1.

All estimates and models include weights to\naccount for differential probabilities of selection with post-\nstratification adjustments for nonresponse and take into ac-\ncount the clustering and stratification of the sample design.)\nPairwise correlations among the network measures are\npresented in Table 4.\nTable 3.

All\nelse equal, individuals who have larger social networks have\ngreater access to social resources like instrumental and so-\ncioemotional support. Because NSHAP used a variation of\nthe \"important matters\" name generator, a measure of net-\nwork size derived from these data captures the extent to\nwhich a person has the strong types of social ties that are\nmost likely to provide social support.\nThe findings from Roster A deserve particular attention\ngiven the importance of discussion networks to social influ-\nence and support. Few respondents reported having no con-\nfidantes. In fact, the modal number reported by NSHAP\nrespondents was five, with over one third of the sample re-\nporting that they have five or more confidantes. As shown\nin Table 3, women, Whites, higher educated people, and\nhealthier respondents reported having larger confidante\nnetworks.\nNetwork Composition\nNetwork composition refers to the types of contacts ego\nmaintains. Network composition can be defined in various\nways, such as the prevalence of specific types of tie (e.g.,\nfriends) in the network or the overall diversity of ties within\nit. Many researchers in medical sociology and social geron-\ntology focus on the proportion of kin because kin relations\nare the most likely to provide unconditional support in the\nface of health crises (Antonucci &Akiyama, 1987; Hurlbert,\nTo make it possible to identify a wider variety of rela-\ntionship types in older adults' networks, NSHAP asked\nrespondents to characterize their relationship with each\nalter as 1 of the following 18 types: spouse, ex-spouse,\nromantic/sexual partner, parent, parent-in-law, child,\nstepchild, sibling, other relative, other in-law, friend,\nneighbor, coworker or boss, minister/priest/other clergy,\npsychiatrist/psychologist/counselor/therapist, caseworker/\nsocial worker, housekeeper/home health care provider, or\nother. As seen from Table 3, older adults' networks are\nmainly kin centered. However, there are some differences\nin network composition across demographic groups. Lati-\nnos tended to report more kin-centered networks than\nWhites. About two thirds of Whites' and Blacks' networks\ncomprised kin compared with nearly 80% of Latinos'\nnetworks. People with less formal education also reported\nnetworks with a higher proportion of kin. With respect to\nother aspects of network composition, men reported hav-\ning fewer female confidantes, as did Whites (compared\nwith Blacks) and more highly educated people. About one\nfourth of network members lived with the respondent.\n(About 80% of coresident network members were the\nrespondent's spouse or current partner.) Older respondents,\nwomen, and Whites (compared with Latinos) reported\nfewer coresident alters.\nEmotional Closeness to Network Members\nThe subjective, emotional quality of relationships has\nbeen linked to well-being (Wellman & Wortley, 1990) and\nmay modulate the effect of other network features on well-\nbeing (Fiori, Antonucci, & Cortina, 2006). High-quality re-\nlationships are the most likely to provide individuals with a\nsense of belonging and self-esteem. Unlike studies that con-\nceptualize emotional closeness in terms of relationship type\n(e.g., automatically assuming that kin ties are closer),\nNSHAP measured relationship quality directly by asking\nrespondents: \"How close do you feel is your relationship\nwith [name]?\" Possible responses included \"not very close,\"\n\"somewhat close,\" \"very close,\" or \"extremely close\" (in\nthat order). This item was modeled after an item in the GSS\nnetworks module. Emotional closeness is summarized in\nTable 3 using the average closeness rating (coded 1\u00ad4)\nacross alters. Most older adults maintain close contacts.\nHowever, the oldest adults, men, and those who are in poorer\nhealth reported being less close to their network members.\nVolume of Contact With Network Members\nAll else equal, more contact with alters means more ac-\ncess to resources and social support (Lin, Woelfel, & Light,\nvolume therefore affects the potential impact of networks on\nhealth (Seeman & Berkman, 1988; Terhell, van Groenou, &\nvan Tilburg, 2007). NSHAP respondents reported how of-\nten they talk to each alter on an 8-point scale, ranging from\n\"every day\" to \"less than once per year.\" One can score\nthese responses according to the approximate number of\ntimes per year ego interacts with alter (e.g., \"once a\nmonth\"=12; \"every day\"=365) and sum these scores across\nall alters in Roster A to obtain a measure of overall volume\nof contact with alters. This measure depends both on aver-\nage frequency of interaction with each network member and\non network size, so it is closely related to both (Table 4).\nThe findings presented in Table 3 show that on average,\nolder adults report nearly two contacts per day with a close\nconfidante. The oldest adults in the sample and men re-\nported fewer contacts per year than younger adults and\nwomen, respectively.\nNetwork Density\nIn addition to the relationships between ego and alter, it is\nalso important to consider the presence and nature of rela-\ntionships among alters. One way to address this is through\nthe concept of network density, defined as the proportion of\nall possible pairs among the alters in which the two indi-\nviduals know each other. High-density networks constitute\nclose-knit social contexts in which alters can share and\ncompare information, coordinate caregiving duties, and\npool resources. Thus, high network density is associated\nwith more reliable and more frequent activation of informal\nsupport (Haines, Hurlbert, & Beggs, 1996; Hurlbert et al.,\n2000). Consider, for example, a widowed woman who is\nrecovering from heart surgery. If her children and her clos-\nest friends know each other well, they can arrange to moni-\ntor and care for her in shifts during her recovery at home.\nThe relationship of this aspect of network structure to health\nhas not been explored in depth, though there are some\nexceptions (e.g., Kelley-Moore, Schumacher, Kahana, &\nNSHAP respondents were asked to indicate how often\neach alter talks to each of the other alters. The response set\nwas the same as that used for the relationship between ego\nand alter, with the additional response \"have never spoken\nto each other.\" Although weighted measures of density are\navailable which take into account the frequency of contact\namong alters, for simplicity, we present here an unweighted\nmeasure, calculated as the proportion of k(k - 1)/2 pairs in\nwhich the two individuals merely know each other. Table 3\nshows that older adults' networks are quite dense, with 85%\nof all possible ties among alters being present, on average.\nMen, Latinos, and those in the \"other\" racial/ethnic cate-\ngory, and less educated respondents tended to report more\ndense networks.\nNetwork Bridging Potential\nA concept that is even more rarely considered in the con-\ntext of health research is that of bridging. Bridging occurs\nwhen ego maintains connections with at least two alters\nwho, without ego, would not be connected to each other.\nServing as a bridge can be useful to individuals for a variety\nof reasons. For one, it yields brokerage potential because\nthose who occupy bridging positions can gain power from\nthe mediation of exchange and transfer of resources and in-\nBridging increases access to separate pools of information\nand resources (Granovetter, 1973), a valuable option when\none seeks advice from numerous sources. Finally, those\nwho maintain separate circles of close contacts tend to ex-\nhibit greater individuality and have more independence\nLike network density, bridging potential is evaluated us-\ning information on the presence or absence of relationships\namong alters. A person has bridging potential whenever two\nalters are unconnected to each other. Therefore, a person's\nbridging potential could be quantified as the number of pairs\nof alters in his or her network who are not directly con-\nnected to each other--the number that reportedly \"have\nnever spoken to each other.\" However, it is important to rec-\nognize that some other individual apart from ego could\nserve as an indirect link between the unconnected pair. This\nis not likely to be the case for alters who have had no con-\ntact with any of ego's other alters. Therefore, we operation-\nalize bridging potential as a dichotomous indicator of\nwhether there is any alter in ego's network who is uncon-\nnected to all the other alters (Cornwell, 2009). In such cases,\nego constitutes the sole bridge between this alter and the\nothers--at least within his or her egocentric network (other\nbridges may exist which involve individuals outside the re-\nspondent's egocentric network). All else equal, those who\nhave low network density will have the most bridging po-\ntential of this kind as density and bridging are inversely re-\nlated (see Table 4). Therefore, it is not surprising that men,\nLatinos, and those in the \"other\" racial/ethnic category ex-\nhibited significantly less bridging potential.\nAssessing Network Members' Involvement in\nHealth-Related Decisions\nThe NSHAP study was particularly interested in the rela-\ntionship between aspects of social connectedness and health.\nMuch research has examined the link between older adults'\nnetwork connectedness and health. However, little is known\nabout the extent to which older adults include their alters\ndirectly in discussions about their health or involve them in\ndecisions regarding medical treatment. This is a potentially\nimportant mechanism by which network connectedness\nmay affect health (and vice versa). In this section, we de-\nscribe two additional items included in NSHAP that permit\none to address this issue.\nNetwork Members in Health Discussions\nThe health benefits of being socially connected may de-\npend on open communication with one's network members,\nincluding the candid exchange of health-related concerns.\nWhen health is discussed openly, alters may be better able\nto identify and deliver the kind of support, care, and other\nresources a person needs. With this in mind, NSHAP asked\nrespondents about the prospects of health-related discus-\nsions with each of the alters they listed in Rosters A, B, and\nC. The question was: \"Suppose you had a health problem\nthat you were concerned about, or needed to make an im-\nportant decision about your own medical treatment. How\nlikely is it that you would talk with [name] about this: Would\nyou say very likely, somewhat likely, or not likely\"? This\nquestion was designed by the NSHAP team, but it was in-\nformed by items used in Lin, Dean, and Ensel (1986).\nWhat features of older adults' relationships with alters\nare associated with the likelihood that they discuss health\nopenly with them? This question can be easily examined\nusing the dyad-level network file supplied with the NSHAP\ndata set (described earlier) which includes data on respon-\ndents' level of openness in health-related discussions with\nthe likelihood of including alters in discussions about health\nissues or medical decisions is related to the characteristics\nof the alters themselves and the nature of their relationships\nwith ego.\nSeveral items are worth noting. First, older adults are in\ngeneral very open to discussing health matters with their\nalters, reporting that they were \"very likely\" to discuss\nhealth with two thirds of their alters. However, whether they\nare likely to discuss important health matters with a given\nalter does appear to be associated with the nature of the re-\nlationship. More older adults say that they are \"very likely\"\nto discuss health with their spouse than with any other indi-\nvidual, followed by children, siblings, romantic partners,\nthen other relatives, friends, and other nonrelatives. Like-\nwise, health discussions are strongly associated with rela-\ntionship strength; older adults are more likely to discuss\nhealth with those alters with whom they feel close and with\nwhom they have frequent contact. Respondents were also\nmore likely to discuss health with female alters and with\nthose who are coresident.\nNetwork Members in Medical Decision Making\nApart from the inclusion of social network members in\nhealth discussions, it is also useful to examine older adults'\nconsideration of alters as proxy medical decision makers.\nAn increasing number of people are establishing advanced\ndirectives, such as durable powers of attorney for health\ncare (DPAHC), to help extend their control over future med-\nical treatments. Research suggests that most older adults\ntrust someone to make medical decisions on their behalf. In\ngeneral, preferences for medical decision makers are hierar-\nchically ordered as follows: spouse, children, other rela-\ntives, and then nonkin (Carr & Khodyakov, 2007; Hopp,\nTo assess the role played by alters in proxy medical deci-\nsion making, we asked respondents: \"Do you have someone\nwho you would like to make medical decisions for you if\nyou were unable, as for example if you were seriously in-\njured or very sick?\" If so, we then assessed this person's\nrole in the respondent's social network by asking: \"Is this\nperson one of the people you identified earlier?\" If so, they\nwere asked to identify this person from the network roster.\nIn order to save time during the interview, these questions\nwere asked of a randomly selected two thirds of the sample\nduring the in-person interview, whereas the remainder re-\nceived it in the leave-behind questionnaire. Because the\ncompleted rosters were not left behind for respondents' ref-\nerence, the follow-up question about whether medical deci-\nsion makers were in the network was only asked of those\nwho were administered these items during the interview.\nA vast majority of respondents (92%) had designated a\nmedical decision maker. Of these, 94% indicated that their\ndesignee was one of the people they had named in one of\nthe network rosters. Nearly all (96%) the alters identified as\nmedical decision makers were kin (usually the spouse or a\nchild). These findings are similar to those reported by Carr\ntheir study who appointed a DPAHC named a family mem-\nber. The egocentric network is also relevant for those few\nrespondents who had no spouse, partner, or children and\nwho reported that they had a medical decision maker\n(n=72). Among these respondents, 89% reported that their\nmedical decision maker was a social network member.\nOverall, these results suggest that older adults' see social\nnetwork members as playing a key role in their long-term\nmedical treatment.\nConclusions\nThe NSHAP study affords researchers the opportunity to\ndevelop a comprehensive picture of older adults' social\nnetworks. The findings presented here suggest that older\nadults are well connected socially. They have relatively\nlarge core discussion networks and access to a variety of\ntypes of social contacts. Analysis of basic measures of net-\nwork structure--including size, composition, density, and\nbridging-- reveals several differences between sociodemo-\ngraphic subgroups which deserve closer scrutiny in future\nresearch by medical sociologists and social gerontologists.\nThe NSHAP network data make it possible to explore\nseveral links between health and social life, which are thus\nfar poorly understood. We know that older adults' social\nnetwork members are central to medical decision-making\nprocesses. An issue that calls for more research, though, is\nolder adults' openness about personal health issues with\ntheir social network members. The free exchange of health-\nrelated information may make older adults' networks more\nTable 5.
