Despite including\nhigh profile targets, the BBC News reported that:\nsoms, according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being\nmachines infected, it's a terrible return' (http://www.\npossible explanations for this. However, part of the\njigsaw of reasons why people and organisations\nwould not bother paying a ransom could simply be\nbecause they never thought their data was particularly\nsecure anyway. For instance, Chris, a technology devel-\noper who participated in our research explained how\nfor the drone development team he worked with, data\ncould always be lost. As he described it: `You try and\nsort of mitigate those circumstances by having some\nredundancy and having some backups written into\nthe projects you are doing', but he emphasised that,\n`no matter how many precautions you take', data\ncould be lost. Almost everyone we interviewed knew\nor knew of someone who had lost significant digital\ndata in some way, such as due to hardware failure,\nlosing or forgetting passwords, or online platforms\nclosing down. Digital data is rarely thought of by its\neveryday users as safe, easy to access or manage, or, in\nthe case of personal data, necessarily accurate. There is\na growing academic interest in anxieties about data\nsecurity, surveillance and power (e.g. Barassi, 2017;\nDencik et al., 2017) and in how people use and experi-\nence self-tracking technologies (Lupton, 2016; Pink and\n2016). This literature provides insights into how per-\nsonal data is created, and used by individuals and\norganisations. However we still know very little about\nhow everyday data producers and users experience the\nsafety of data storage techniques and technologies in\neveryday life, what uncertainties, anxieties and con-\ncerns, or hopes and forms of trust their relations with\ndata entail, or how these are dealt with.\n1RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia\n2RMIT University, Barcelona, Spain\n3University of Sydney, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nSarah Pink, College of Design and Social Context, RMIT University,\nEmail: sarah.pink@rmit.edu.au\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction\nand distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/bds\nIn this article we take a design anthropological\napproach that accounts for the emergent circumstances\nof everyday life (Pink et al., 2016; Smith and Otto,\n2016) to examine how people improvise to keep their\ndata safe in mundane everyday working, personal and\ncommunity or technology meetup activities. For\nanthropologists Tim Ingold and Elizabeth Hallam,\nimprovisation is `a necessary condition because there\nis no existing template that instructs us in how to deal\nwith the continually changing contingencies of life'\nfrom our performative engagements with the materials\nthat surround us' (Ingold and Hallam, 2007: 3). As\ndesign anthropologists Wendy Gunn and Christian\nClausen express it, by improvising people `find ways\nwith how people experience living with data, the antici-\npatory modes this entails, and how in proceeding\nthrough their everyday work or personal activity they\nimprovise to reduce, obscure or alleviate anxieties\nabout data storage and safety. This involves getting\nunder the surface of what data might initially appear\nto be and encountering the messiness of activities and\nfeelings that surround data. Based on our ethnographic\nresearch and interviews in Melbourne, Australia and\nBarcelona, Spain, which focused upon the value of\neveryday data in the lives of people who worked with\ndigital technologies in different ways, we advance an\nunderstanding of data as incomplete, often dispersed,\nand saved or stored according to contingent actions\nand logics. In doing so we highlight the everyday anxi-\neties associated with data. These anxieties relate to how\npeople experience the realities of the messiness of digital\ndata, their uncertainties about how data might be used\nor accessed in the future, and anticipation around its\nloss.\nTo develop our argument we begin by outlining\nwhat we mean by data anxiety, and the associated\nanticipatory terms of trust, and by contrast, hope,\nthrough which these anxieties are eased. In doing so\nwe propose a theory of what it feels like to live with\ndata, which informs the discussion in this article. We\nthen provide further details of the ethnographic\nresearch sites and processes that enabled us to unravel\nhow people improvise to feel comfortable with data\nthrough practices such as creating redundancy and\ntransparency. We conclude by arguing for greater\nattention to these temporalities of data, and reflecting\nupon the implications of such work for visions of the\nfuture of technologies and data.\nData, anxiety and trust\nDigital data is an increasing and continual presence\nacross the sites, activities and relationships of everyday\nout technology is not simple, but involves the `mess' of\nits constituent or related parts, as well as that of the\ninstitutions, power relations that govern its use, and the\nconflicting discourses that define it. Data also exists\nwithin this messy world. For social scientists (digital)\ndata is a critical category rather than a self-evident or\ncalled the datafication of our everyday lives and worlds\n\u00ad defined as `the ability to render into data many\naspects of the world that have not been quantified\nbefore' (Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger, 2013), has\nbeen discussed across many domains of everyday\nexperience including health (Ruckenstein and Dow\nSchu\n\u00a8 ll, 2017), regulatory and preventative governance\nand policing (Dencik et al., 2017; Smith and O'Malley,\n(Millington and Millington, 2015). Whereas these dis-\ncussions of data reveal important dimensions of the\nmeaning of how different populations and domains\nare using data, we focus our attention on how people\nfeel about the safety of their data.\nWe take as our starting point the impossibility of\nknowing our futures (Pink and Salazar, 2017) and the\nneed to recognise that `our futures are contingent\nbecause our present is as well' (Bessire and Bond,\nanticipated has become increasingly embedded in con-\ntemporary research agendas. As Adams et al. (2009)\nnote, `one defining quality of our current moment is\nits characteristic state of anticipation, of thinking and\nliving toward the future' (246). Existing research has\ncritically examined the anticipatory modes of digital\ndata use in social media data for predictive measures\nsuch as policing (e.g. Dencik et al., 2017), which is char-\nacteristic of the risk averse and audit based cultures of\nneoliberal states, as demonstrated by research into civil\ncontingencies (Anderson, 2010), safety (Pink et al.,\napproaches everyday life circumstances as emergent\nhow people improvise to fill in the gaps between what\nthey think they know and the inevitable uncertainties\nthat actions entail. In these everyday life contexts future\nfocused data practices are central; however, in contrast\nto the risk mitigation strategies of regulatory govern-\nance, they are idiosyncratic and improvisatory. We\nengage the concept of data anxiety and the related con-\ncept of trust to demonstrate how everyday improvisa-\ntory actions enabled participants in our research to feel\ncomfortable in this anticipatory mode.\nWhile there is an existing body of scholarship about\ntrust in the social sciences and humanities, it has not\ndeveloped as a central or mainstream concern for most\n2 Big Data & Society\nacademic disciplines. Nevertheless, in an increasingly\ninterdisciplinary context questions about digital\ntrust are frequently foregrounded particularly in organ-\nisation studies and in the human\u00adcomputer interaction\n(HCI) research field, with particular reference to\nhow and if people will trust new technologies, inter-\nfaces, forms of automation and artificial intelligence\n(e.g. Harper, 2014). Trust, as experienced by our\nresearch participants, was coherent with our focus on\nprocess, emergence and (im)possible rather than\npredictable futures. This therefore involves approach-\ning the concept of trust as a feeling that specifically\nrefers to the ability to be able to move on and do some-\nthing in the immediate future. It need not involve abso-\nlute certainty, but entails feeling and knowing enough\nto be able to take the next step. Hope, in contrast to\ntrust, tends to be related to the aspirational dimensions\nof how we imagine futures. Pedersen and Liisberg\ndiscuss the `imaginary anticipation' of both hope\nand trust since `They concern future states that exceed\nthe immediate control of the person trusting or hoping'.\nThey suggest that `whereas trust typically concerns near\nand probable futures that mostly meet our expect-\nations, hope may well paint a scenario of a possible\nand radically different future' (Pedersen and Liisberg,\ntrust, and its relatedness to the activities of\nimprovisation that enable us to step forward in uncer-\ntain circumstances (Gunn and Clausen, 2013). Trust is\nthe element of this in which we feel sufficiently\nconfident to be able to act, whereby `Confidence\nbased on familiarity is the foundation of getting\ninvolved in a situation' and differentiates trust from\nFollowing this argument, humans trust when we feel\nconfident enough that any improvisatory action is suf-\nficiently cushioned by the familiarity of process or\nplace. This might not be a cognitive decision but\nrather a sensory experience of feeling or disposition\ntowards something. However, the sense of familiarity\nis a key. Familiarity is associated with routine.\nRoutines are not always repeated in exactly the same\nway every time, since nothing can ever be done in the\nsame way more than once. Rather routines are similar\nenough to be recognised by people as being repeats of\nprevious actions, thoughts and embodied sensory feel-\nings. Thus, people feel comfortable in routines and they\nfeel accomplished when they have completed them\n(Pink et al., 2017b). It has long since been understood\nin the social sciences that routines are associated with\nfeelings of what Giddens (1991) called `ontological\nsecurity'. As the examples discussed below highlight,\neven when such security and familiarity is felt, it does\nnot mean that the immediate or far futures are secured.\nRather trust is a feeling that is part of a mode of living\nin a world of uncertainties that `feels right', a sense of\ncontrol in a space of uncertainty.\nTrust is thus part of how we live with data. This\nframing of data contextualises its use and the way it\nis experienced within the everyday uncertainties that\npeople ongoingly have to cope with as they navigate\ntheir ways through the contingencies of life. Living\nwith and having to take responsibility for data mani-\nfests itself in the form of mundane and often small but\nrelevant anxieties, which might be experienced as more\nexplicit worries, niggles and sometimes feelings of con-\nfusion. Yet, people improvise as they go about quash-\ning or suppressing the uncertainties that give rise to\nanxieties, through taking improvisatory steps in every-\nday familiar routines or adhering to convincing (for\nthem) logics. These, modes of dealing with everyday\nanxieties we argue generate forms of trust which\nenable people to proceed in everyday life and moreover\nto imagine and work towards everyday futures.\nUnderstanding this fills an important gap in our\nknowledge about how people live with data in the\npresent, and can help us subsequently to think\nabout how people will continue to live with data in\nan as-yet-unknown and uncertain future.\nThe anticipatory states most discussed in recent lit-\nerature on data refer to the anxieties that are experi-\nenced, expressed and imagined both in the datafied\npresent and as yet unknown datafied futures have\nmainly been researched and reported on in relation to\nquestions of security, privacy, and fears about the\nfuture implications of what other people, organisations\nor governance systems might do with data in the future.\nFor example Kate Crawford (2016) proposed that\n`Already, the lived reality of Big Data is suffused with\na kind of surveillant anxiety \u00ad the fear that all the data\nwe are shedding every day is too revealing of our intim-\nate selves but may also misrepresent us', which she sug-\ngested is coupled with the anxiety of the surveillers\nfuelled by their awareness that their data will always\nbe incomplete and insufficient. More recent studies\nhave revealed that there certainty are public concerns\nabout data and privacy, such as in fields focused upon\ngovernance and security (e.g. Chan and Bennett Moses,\n2017). Sometimes this has led to forms of activism, for\ninstance against data driven crime prevention (Smith\nand O'Malley, 2017), health monitoring (for an exam-\nple see http://www.unfitbits.com/) and of course actions\nlike that of Edward Snowden (see also Crawford, 2016).\nWhile these sets of anxieties and the activist and pro-\ngressive stances they invoke form an important, and\nindeed inescapable backdrop to the questions we dis-\ncuss in this article, data anxieties are not only about the\npublic and more `spectacular' spheres of life, like public\nactivism and the surveillant modes of large organisa-\ntions. They are moreover not only related to questions\nPink et al. 3\nof Big Data, datafication and their impact of our lives.\nTherefore, while we acknowledge that questions\nrelating to power and privacy are also integral to the\neveryday data management, our objective here is intro-\nduce another element of data anxieties. In the follow-\ning two sections, we draw attention to another,\nequally prevalent but less visible and little discussed\nelement of data anxiety: the anxieties associated with\nthe kinds of everyday data that people handle in the\ncourse of their mundane daily routines of home\nand work life, and which indeed are part of how these\ntwo domains sometimes become inseparable from\neach other.\nThe ethnographic context\nThe original impetus for the study emerged from a pro-\ngramme of research with an industry partner that\nfocused on futures and forms of value in relation to\ndigital technologies, data and design. Within this we\nundertook fieldwork for six months, between\nand Melbourne (Australia), while drawing on several\nyears of previous fieldwork in Barcelona. The theme\nof data anxieties discussed in this article emerged\nfrom and was explored within this project.\nBarcelona and Melbourne present ideal opportu-\nnities for an international study. The two cities belong\nto different national economies, one of which is rela-\ntively affluent (Melbourne) and the other which is in the\nthroes of an economic crisis (Barcelona). However, in\nspite of this difference they are both global cities of\nsimilar population sizes (Barcelona 4.6 m1, and\nMelbourne over 4.5 m2), and comprise international\ncommunities of people involved in technology design.\nThe participants in our research were all selected\nbecause they already used digital data extensively in\ntheir everyday and working lives. Most of the partici-\npants had a strong interest in technology making,\ndesign and digital fabrication and either worked in\nthe technology field currently or had a background in\ntechnology. However they represented a spectrum of\nskills in this field, with some being highly skilled in\ntechnology design while the skills of others were\nfocused across digital archiving, marketing, events\nmanagement and technological forums. Participants\nwere aged between 20 to 60 years, with an equal\ngender division amongst younger participants. Older\nparticipants were mostly men.\nWe undertook ethnographic fieldwork across a series\nof sites considered relevant due to their focus on emer-\nging technologies: FabLab Barcelona, which houses\nmany digital technology research, development and\neducation programmes, principally with community,\neducational and non-profit organisations. Launchpad,\na coworking and business accelerator located in the\nsuburb of Richmond in Melbourne, where technology\nmeetups and events occurred regularly making it a\nfocus point for the technology start-up community;\nMake Create, the first makerspace established in\nMelbourne where groups of technology designers\nmeet to share knowhow and collaborate in technology\nprojects; and the Bitcoin/Blockchain Center in\nMelbourne. Bitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency\nwhich allows its users to make transactions without\ngoing through third party (such as a bank).\nBlockchain is the technology makes these transactions\npossible and visible (for Bitcoin and other transac-\ntions), through a dispersed leger system that involves\nmultiple computers, rather than a centralised system.3\nOur fieldwork consisted of a series of encounters where\nwe attended and participated in events and meetups of\ndifferent sizes (from just a handful of people at a small\nmeet-up to over 100 at Launchpad events) using visual\nand sensory ethnography research techniques in these\ntiation with the participants and organisations. We\nconducted ethnographic interviews, participant obser-\nvation, ethnographic workshops and tours (Maddox\net al., 2016). We video recorded at events and during\ninterviews, especially when we asked them to show us\nhow they enacted and experienced certain data related\nactivities. In all instances our approach to ethnography\nengaged participants in co-producing ways of knowing\nwith us within the research process and in receiving our\nfeedback about what we had learned with them and\nbecause participants worked in the technology field\nthey were interested in our research. In this particular\narticle we discuss how participants saved, moved and\nstored their data, how they made sure it was safe or\nsecure, and how and why they believed it would be safe\nin those particular circumstances.\nThe data anxieties and the activities people engage in\nto quell them represented a particular strand of the\nresearch that referred to something that was not visible\nthrough conventional ethnography for two reasons.\nFirst, the routines and activities we became interested\nin were practices that we discovered were used to\nrepress the feelings of anxiety around data. These feel-\nings were rarely expressed or articulated by participants\nprior to this work. Thus, it did not necessarily exist in\nthe moment that we researched it but needed to be\nrecalled. Data anxieties are real, and felt, but they are\nephemeral. They refer to feelings experienced during\nthe flow of everyday life, about a lingering future pos-\nsibility rather than an explicit state of affairs that has\ncome about in the present. For this reason we sought to\nresearch a feeling that we could not locate or witness\nthrough observation, and which participants them-\nselves often could not find, until we focused discussions\n4 Big Data & Society\nwith them on particular memories of experiences where\nit had surfaced.\nSecond, our research subject was elusive because the\npractical manifestations of data anxieties that might be\nwitnessed ethnographically involved very mundane\neveryday routines that participants rarely shared with\nothers, and usually performed when alone. Therefore\nethnographic fieldwork in workplace localities and par-\nticipation in events enabled us to observe the visible\ndimensions of data use and, as shown below to some-\ntimes witness the moments when collective data anxi-\neties were revealed. However, to go under the surface\nmore systematically we collaborated more deliberately\nwith participants by focusing with them in video rec-\norded interviews usually held at the fieldwork locations,\nand in the workshop. Wherever possible during the\ninterviews participants used and referred to their tech-\nnologies, showing us how they used them or using them\nas memory prompts regarding their data activities.\nThus in the interview encounters and the workshop\nwe could follow up on moments and hunches, when\nquestions around data anxieties and routines were\nimplied that had emerged during our ethnographic\nfieldwork.\nStrategies for managing data and\nuncertainty\nIn the final stages of our research we invited a small\ngroup of key participants involved in the Blockchain,\ntech design and maker environments in Melbourne to\nthe workshop mentioned in the previous section. At the\nworkshop we collaborated with the participants to co-\ncreate a hierarchy of what technologies were most\ntrusted and why. While we had in mind a possible dis-\ncussion of devices, platforms, apps, software, hardware\nand forms of certification, the participants collectively\ninsisted that the most trustworthy technologies were\npen and paper. The discussion explicitly acknowledged\nthat the participants did not regard digital technologies\nand data as reliable and trustworthy, even though they\ndepended on them for their livelihoods. This might not\nbe a surprising finding for people who work in technol-\nogy design and development, however, its significance is\nthat it reiterates the point that living with data is coter-\nminous with living with uncertainty. In this section we\ndiscuss two modes of coping with the data anxieties\nassociated with uncertainty and forms of trust that\nare implicated in these: redundancy and transparency.\nRedundancy\nAs we have emphasised, all our participants acknowl-\nedged that their data could be lost, stolen, deleted or in\nsome other way become inaccessible to them. They all\nknew someone who had lost a substantial amount of\ndigital data, or had lost data themselves, and remem-\nbered and consistently recounted stories about this. The\nstories differed in terms of how data was lost and the\nsoftware and hardware involved. For example, one par-\nticipant had lost bitcoin investments in the wake of a\npoorly designed system, another feared that the plat-\nform where she archived her PhD notes would close\ndown without her being able to transfer her materials.\nThese narratives demonstrated how data could be lost\nin any imaginable configuration of hardware and soft-\nware, but that this might not always matter, or was\nsomething that people always knew was possible.\nThus participants did not trust their technologies as\nfailsafe devices for securing their data. Yet simultan-\neously found ways of dissipating any anxieties around\nthis. Indeed sometimes people's experiences of loss or\npossible loss appeared not to correspond with their use\nof their technologies. For instance, another participant\ndid not bother creating a password on her smartphone,\nyet in the same interview described how she had spent a\nseries of days waiting worriedly while her boyfriend\nfixed her broken laptop with the help of YouTube\nvideos, leaving it in pieces on their dining table\nduring the process. Other participants described data\nthat they considered to be desirable to keep but not\nworth the level of care and curation required to\nensure that it was either duplicated or even easily\naccessible. Many participants discussed with us how\nthey managed their multiple email accounts and the\ndata (files, messages) that they contained. Data kept\nin email archives was not necessarily considered to be\ndata that would be accessed again but that it was good\nto keep, it formed what we refer to as data presence,\ncreating a sense of security that files that were in it\ncould be potentially searched and retrieved, even if it\nwas unlikely this would ever happen, and would pos-\nsibly be difficult to locate through search functions.\nDepending on the logics of loss and access through\nwhich they understood data and performed their own\nmundane everyday improvisatory activities with data,\nparticipants variously felt that they could sufficiently\ntrust different configurations of software and hardware.\nFor example, one Melbourne based participant Julien,\nhad previously worked providing technology expertise in\na company, and recently left his role to set up a drone\nstart-up with a group of colleagues. Julien had encoun-\ntered people who had lost access to their data very fre-\nquently when in his former role and was keen to stress that\nhe felt data was never safe, and that you can never guar-\nantee or be completely confident that it will not be lost,\neven if individual knowhow could be a key factor in rela-\ntion to if data retrieval. In anticipation of this potential\nloss, he tried to ensure a certain level of duplication in his\ndata archiving, keeping, for example, one copy in the\nPink et al. 5\ncloud, another easily accessible on an networked device he\nused on a daily basis, and another copy saved at home on a\nnon-networked device. Each of these forms of storage\ncould fail, but from his perspective duplication increased\nthe safety of the data, and thus through his routines of\nduplication he created a familiar process that enabled him\nto trust that data would probably not be lost. Another\nparticipant, Marc, similarly improvised his techniques\nbased on a particular logic through which to understand\nhow duplication or `redundancy' on different types of\nplatforms and technologies, would reduce the likelihood\nof his data becoming lost or inaccessible.\nDuplication or redundancy of different forms also\nemerged in our Barcelona research. For instance,\nLaura worked as a freelancer, across arts and other\nevents. Because she worked in the field of digital arts,\nshe frequently used an iPhone4 and an iMac and\nworked with data archives and social media campaigns.\nShe was concerned about losing her data and like other\nparticipants, had everyday routines for saving, copying\nand archiving data in hardware, which did not neces-\nsarily make the data `safer' but meant they felt secure\nabout the data in contexts of actual uncertainty and\ninstability. Laura used complex saving routines based\nin her faith in the robustness of hardware. For example,\nshe described how one organisation she worked for\nkept everything in Dropbox, so from each of the\nthree years she worked on their project she had a\nfolder. These folders, she explained, were kept in vari-\nous places \u00ad on the hard drive in the organisation's\noffice; in the Dropbox cloud; and on her own iMac \u00ad\nand they were synced from the iMac to an external\ndrive (Time Machine). She was also asked to make a\ncopy and store this on the organisation's server. She\ndescribed the routines through which this was achieved:\nLaura: When I finish working I copy it all and that's it.\nDebora: Does it worry you if you finish work for the\nday and you haven't saved it on their server?\nLaura: No, I don't save it on their server. But yes I do\nalways make sure that I copy it onto my own com-\nputer . . . if it's only in Dropbox I don't feel\ncomfortable. . . . I have Dropbox installed on my com-\nputer but I feel that even there, it's as if it could fail, so\nI copy the contents to another place. I put it in a folder\nand I duplicate it. . . . normally I copy the whole folder\nand replace the previous one with it\nThe logic of these routines were driven by the partici-\npant's own convictions about what she believed was\nnecessary for the data to be safe, her trust in the robust-\nness of the hardware, and were designed to ensure that\nshe personally did not feel anxious about its safety.\nAs such, she did not follow the framework expected\nby the organisation, but instead relied on her own\nimprovised routines of duplication. She was not con-\ncerned about the possibility of the external hard drive\nbeing stolen from her home, or if it could break. In fact,\nshe did not even know if it was actually copying the\ndata, since she had never checked to see what was on it.\nYet by following the routines of duplication that she\ndescribed she felt reassured that the data was safe\nenough. The use of daily or otherwise regular routines\nof saving and uploading data was a common way that\nparticipants in this and other projects (for instance in\nstudies of self-tracking, Pink et al., 2017b).\nThere was also an emphasis on established process\nand routine in our other ethnographic sites, relating to\ncollective and shared data. In the makerspace this was\nevident in the management of data produced within\nmembers' personal and collective projects. For\ninstance, Dillon and Ahmed, the two founders and cur-\nrent managers, were making a video featuring their\ndrone project, in order to participate in an accelerator\nprogramme. We arrived at the makerspace at about\n7 p.m., on a Tuesday when as usual Dillon and\nAhmed started to collect cash for a shared pizza\norder from those members who were staying for\ndinner. This was usually a relaxed point in the evening\nwhen members discussed what they had done and\nlearned that day over a beer while waiting for the\npizza delivery. However this Tuesday the atmosphere\nwas different. A group of members were clustered\naround the corner of the long table, which was covered\nwith cables, hardware, and tools, with their almost\nsilent attention focused on one of three laptops.\nAhmed was very tense, looking up from the desk he\nshared with Dillon, he was telling them `I don't know\nwhat I did'. Turning to us he explained that he had\nbeen uploading the video to Alex's computer (Alex is\na sound technician who was editing the video), but\nwhen he had simultaneously started to transfer the file\nto Vimeo, if had just disappeared. Almost before\nAhmed finished speaking, Dillon began to outline\nhow the process should be performed. First, he told\nus, he would have downloaded the video from the\ncamera to Alex's computer and sent it by wire to his\nown computer, commenting that he would never use\nbluetooth for this procedure. Only on having completed\nthese two steps would he then upload the video to\nVimeo. While Dillon seemed to implicitly accuse\nAhmed of losing the video because he had not followed\nthe correct routine, at the same time Ahmed's kno-\nwhow came into the discussion, since Alex answered\nfrom the crowded corner, pointing out that Ahmed\nwas an engineer and suggesting there was probably\n`something wrong with the software'. The group then\nmoved over to the table and unsuccessfully tried to\n6 Big Data & Society\nunravel what had happened. The pizza arrived and\nafter what was a silent and quite tense dinner, Dillon\nbetween sips of beer, and more relaxed reflected that\n`The video was almost done' and that fortunately they\nhad old versions of it in the editing software, on Alex's\ncomputer and on vimeo. Therefore, not only had they\nan established routine for ensuring the safety of data,\nbut they also made the safety of the video files a col-\nlective concern, secured in part through sharing, which\nwe reflect on further in the next section.\nIn effect, participants reduced their anxiety about\npossible loss by improvising to establish trusted rou-\ntines to ensure that data is saved as soon as possible.\nHere trust is invested in the routine, or a sense of trust\nis gained through the familiarity of the routine.\nTransparency and know-how\nFor many participants in our study data needed to be\nsaved in proprietary ways, and its security was based in\nits not being visible to others or only being visible to\nselected others. However other participants felt that the\nsafety of their data was increased through making it\nvisible and, in turn, transparent. Particularly amongst\ntechnology designers, rather than saving data on a\nclosed hard drive, it was felt that data would be safer\non an open platform or sharing context. Thus anxieties\nabout data loss were quelled through sharing. This is\ndemonstrated through our research with Smart Citizen\ndesigners and users. Smart Citizen (Figures 1 and 2),\nlocated online here https://smartcitizen.me, consists of\na platform, a kit and its user community which is neces-\nsary for it to be operational. It is defined on its web site:\n`Smart Citizen is a platform to generate participatory\nprocesses of people in the cities. Connecting data,\npeople and knowledge, the objective of the platform\nis to serve as a node for building productive and open\nindicators, and distributed tools, and thereafter the col-\nlective construction of the city for its own inhabitants'\nThe platform connects people, data and knowledge\nrelated to urban environments. It consists of open\nsource software and hardware developed by and for\nthe community, and which generates indicators about\nthe quality of the air we breathe, the noise we produce\nand other environmental agents that surrounded us.\nSmart Citizen is constituted by the data that each of\nits users generates and shares within the community.4\nFor example Gerard, a tech designer explained that\nbecause the code and software used for the Smart\nCitizen platform is open and not proprietary, it is\nlikely that the code would already have been shared\nor used elsewhere. Because people use their code to\nbuild their own platforms for using Smart Citizen sen-\nsors, they can manipulate the data themselves.\nAs one of the Directors of Smart Citizen in the\nBarcelona FabLab described,\nFigure 1. The smart citizen device is used in homes and workplaces.\nPink et al. 7\n`There are 2 things here, our platform is not distribu-\nted, we could do it, . . . it is happening with various\ntechnologies,. . . so if we close tomorrow, the data\nwould be locked in there. The difference is that as\nthere is a community around this who has developed\nthe project, there would a process to make the data\navailable'\nHe further explained that, `The platform is opensource,\nso you could set it up again with other servers and\ncould ask them for all the data and it could be repro-\nduced'. Since the code for this platform is open, some\nusers already publish their data on their own platforms\nthat they develop (Maddox et al., 2016). For many of\nour tech designer participants, sharing data \u00ad and main-\ntaining the know how to use it \u00ad was often a trusted\nmeans of keeping it safe. In this example we see trust\ninvested in the routine process of sharing and creating\ntransparency.\nA second example emerged in our research with the\nBlockchain Centre in Melbourne (Figures 3 and 4). The\ncentre's work is based in a context where the `Bitcoin\nand Blockchain ecosystem' has recently rapidly grown\nin Australia, and `has relied on industry participants\neducating customers and members of the public on\nthe technology' and in response to what Bitcoin and\nBlockchain advocates see as `a need for knowledge\nhubs, community centres and impartial not for profit\nadvocacy groups and organisations' (http://blockchain-\ncentre.com.au/).\nWe were interested in Blockchain and Bitcoin\nbecause they represent a form of value which is outside\nthe `system', as participants put it. We attended meet-\nups in Melbourne's Blockchain centre and interviewed\npeople involved in advocating for Blockchain, who had\ninvested in it personally, were interested in it from a\nbusiness perspective and for whom passion and advo-\ncacy for the technology spilled over between their per-\nsonal and working/business life.\nParticipants at the Blockchain Centre told us that\nmaking your bitcoin wallet and transactions public\nwas an advantage, since as one participant [name]\ndescribed:\n`No one can access it without a private key . . . but any-\nbody can look in your account and in your wallet, all\nthe wallets are online, you can go and check any wallet\nand see what's in it, you don't know who owns it,\nyou can go and track that down if you want, bitcoin's\npseudonymous it's not anonymous you can track down\nthe owner of an account if you try hard enough, but\nthat's the beauty of it, if I know the wallet . . . that\nyou're using I can go and look at it and see how\nmuch is in there, I can't take any of it out . . .'\nWe asked him he felt Bitcoin made money safer because\nthe transactions and amounts are transparent rather\nthan hidden behind the walls of a bank. He responded\nby explaining, `Because . . . you can go to a wal-\nlet, . . . and see when they were last moved and things\nlike that, I think it does make it safer, if we all know\nFigure 2. At the FabLab Barcelona.\n8 Big Data & Society\nwhat's going on it's harder to dupe people about what\nmight have happened'\nYet, as Kelty (2014) and others have observed with\nrespect to open access, making transactions and\naccounts transparent does not necessarily mean that\nBitcoin and accessing digital data is accessible. As\nMartin, the manager of the Blockchain Centre\nMelbourne described, using Bitcoin is not simple,\nsince, `It is a hazard for people to use the system',\nand can be `scary' to learn. The disadvantage of not\nFigure 4. Martin gives the research team a key blockchain email that he printed off for us.\nFigure 3. An exhibit from the history of Blockchain at the Blockchain centre in Melbourne.\nPink et al. 9\nlearning is that `you have a custodian instead . . . then\nthey have control over your bitcoins . . .'. To access and\ntrade with bitcoins you must remember a complicated\npersonal key and learn the know-how to use the tech-\nnology. While bitcoin and Blockchain provide control\nand freedom, they entail a series of risks which require\naction so that their users can feel assured of their safety.\nIf you lose your personal key you will lose the bitcoins\nforever. However, this in itself requires a routine series\nof safeguards. Martin told us that to be secure, bitcoins\nshould be stored on something with a clean operating\nsystem, avoiding connected devices where they could be\nhacked. The documents that are evidence of Bitcoin\nshould be printed on a printer with no memory so it\ncannot keep the information, and should be kept in a\nbank safe.\nThis know-how and the meticulous organisation\nthat was required to be able to safely use Bitcoins is a\nstark contrast to how participants with less techno-\nlogical know-how coped with digital data. As Sam, a\nless tech savvy participant described:\n`I would be really upset if I lost my Instagram because\nit's a kind of memory . . . another one I use is a biblio-\ngraphic cataloguing platform and I am really scared\nabout that . . . I have all my notes there, that would be\nreally bad, . . . [if they commercialize it] or if they close\ndown. I have lots of texts with lots of notes and I\nalways think ``I've got to copy everything'', . . . but as\nthere isn't a way to do it, and I'm too lazy to copy and\npaste it, and it's all so disorganized, now that I'm tell-\ning you about it I feel pressured about it.'\nIn contrast with the confidence that tech designers\nderived from keeping their data visible and transparent\non platforms, less knowledgeable users had anxieties\nabout saving digital materials on platforms, platforms\nclosing, not having time or know-how to transfer data,\nor not having a system of organisation.\nTrust and uncertainty: Navigating the\ntemporalities of data\nThe presence of Big Data in our lives has been influen-\ntial in recent thinking since it has invited us to re-think\nthe temporalities of data. This has involved conceptua-\nlising data beyond the idea of an archive of un-altering\nor `stopped' pieces of information that cut through\nthe world, towards seeing data archives as dynamic,\npotentially `real-time', moving and changing (mis)rep-\nresentations of everyday realities (Kitchin, 2014). As\ndemonstrated in the previous section, the everyday digi-\ntal data we are concerned with in this article is equally\nongoingly produced and made. By this we do not\nsimply mean that all individual files or data or other\ndigital objects are continually modified by their users,\nbut that the bodies of data to which they belong or with\nwhich they are archived are incrementally being mod-\nified, usually because they are being added to on a regu-\nlar basis.\nAs we see through the examples of duplication and\nredundancy, digital data is part of ongoing everyday\nprocesses of work and leisure. This can be seen in\nother domains such as self-tracking (see Lupton,\n2017b), where personal data is added to continually\nand automatically (with varying degrees of human\nintervention); everyday file making and archiving in\ncontexts of digital labour or personal archiving\nwhereby new files with particular content are made or\nmodified and added to archives; data ongoingly pro-\nduced by user communities and shared on online plat-\nforms; and other forms of data that are not necessarily\nbeing modified electronically as individual files are\nnevertheless changing, such as Bitcoin accounts which\nare always part of a wider ecology of other Bitcoin\naccounts, and can have changing market value even if\nthe data itself is not changed.\nThe temporalities of data we focus on here are also\nbound up with what we call their `digital materiality'\n(Pink et al., 2016) whereby the digital and material are\npart of the same thing, and continually emerging in new\nforms. The materiality of data has been emphasised by\nDourish in his discussion of emulation (2016) and by\nSTS researchers (Tanweer et al., 2016) with reference to\nboth software and hardware (Star, 1999). This is sig-\nnificant since it is refers to how people constitute rela-\ntionships between software and hardware as they\nimprovise to make sense of data. As we showed in the\ndiscussion of tech design and Bitcoin, there are also\npatterns in how different logics of software-hardware\nand proprietary and nonproprietary relationships\ninform the ways people engage with data. These digital\nmaterialities are therefore not fixed in either software or\nin the ongoingly emergent relationship between the\ntwo as they become part of the same digital-material\nthing. The examples of duplication and redundancy can\nbe seen as the digital-material manifestations of data\nanxieties.\nA second element of the temporality of everyday\ndata refers specifically to the temporality through\nwhich it is experienced by people. As we have noted\nalready, anxiety is an anticipatory concept that has\nbeen associated specifically with Big Data by other\nresearchers. However, we argue that everyday data\nalso needs to be understood in relation to an anticipa-\ntory temporality, in that saving data indicates that data\nneeds to exist in an as-yet-unknown but imagined\nfuture. As the above examples suggest, this future\n10 Big Data & Society\nmight be quite immediate, for instance the next day\nwhen files or archives might be used, or it could be in\nthe more distant future, such as in plans for using a\nbitcoin pension investment. Whatever the case, there\nis a sense that we need to save digital data specifically\nin relation to something that might happen next, and to\nunderstand this we return to the concept of trust.\nWhile routines govern how people cope with digital\ndata, it is also clear through our ethnographic material\nthat data is something that is continuously produced\nand, and since it does not `stop' or become fixed in\nany way, it needs to continually be coped with. It there-\nfore needs to be understood in research as a processual\nelement of the everyday. This ongoingness of data is\nalso part of people's modes of everyday knowing\nabout data, and way of sensing its presence. For\nsome people everyday storage of data was partly a\nmanual process. For instance whereby one participant\nintervened to save her folders a second time on her hard\ndrive, while other aspects of this duplication process\nwere automated and saved in Dropbox and on an exter-\nnal hard drive. In this sense, data and life are ongoing\ntogether and all are impacted by the contingent circum-\nstances of the present. In these situations of automation\npeople are not always fully conscious or aware of what\nis happening in relation to their data. For instance our\nparticipant did not know if her data was really being\nsaved on the external drive because she had never\nchecked, but she lived with this uncertainty because\nshe invested trust in both the hardware itself and the\nroutines she followed for saving the data. Another par-\nticipant did not know how the value of his bitcoins\nwould change but had invested trust in the process\nthrough which he had stored them, and had been\npleased when they dramatically increased in value.\nThe drone-making team did not know if they would\nlose their Drone's GPS data or not, but were not espe-\ncially worried since they trusted that by repeating the\nprocess they could always recover enough of the flight\npath for the experience to be meaningful. The example\nof Bitcoin is worth reiterating and considering in rela-\ntion to losing access as well as losing the asset. There is\nalso an ambiguity and twist, since in this case loss for\nsome means value for others: a Bitcoin is worth nothing\nunless you have a digital key to access and trade with it\nand a percentage of existing bitcoin keys have been lost\nfor ever. While this is digital loss for individuals who\nlose their keys, it is not necessarily seen as negative by\nthe wider bitcoin user-community since it means that\nthe currency is strengthened because it reduces the\nnumber of bitcoins in circulation. In this case trust in\nthe processes through which a key is kept safe is central\nto evade anxieties about losing data. As we have shown,\nhere trust was produced through the familiar technolo-\ngies of pen and paper documentation.\nTherefore, what happens with data as it becomes\nembedded in and produced through everyday life activ-\nities, and somehow familiarised and domesticated into\nthe everyday through routines that manage it (even if\nnot in the most efficient ways as they would be defined\nby information technology experts), is contingent and\noften involves improvisatory responses. If this necessi-\ntates `the recognition that our futures are contingent\nbecause our present is as well' (Bessire and Bond,\nare just as likely as the present circumstances described\nby our participants, to be messy, throw up surprises for\nus, and thus be just as uncertain. Living with data\ninvolves a temporality that is known through the\nongoing sense of uncertainty about future accessibility,\npresence and use of data. Routines such as creating\nredundancy or engaging in transparency and maintain-\ning the skills, or know-how, to navigate complex\ntechnological systems in our everyday lives are ways\nof creating processes in which to trust and to reduce\nthe anxiety associated with uncertainty. By trusting in\nfamiliar routine, participants were able to `feel alright'\nas they lived with the uncertainty of data.\nData futures are imagined rather than predictable\nand to understand them we need to acknowledge\nwhat Irving refers to as `the radical contingency of\nthe future, including futures that we do not and will\ngency and uncertainty about what will happen next that\ninformed the experiences and imaginaries of our\nresearch participants, which were riddled with stories,\nexpectations and anxieties that data could be lost,\nstolen or otherwise disappear or be compromised.\nMoreover, there have been no design solutions that\nmake data completely secure. Instead our ethnography\nshowed how participants in our research engaged with\nnew technological possibilities in improvisatory ways to\nenable themselves to feel comfortable enough to trust in\nthe continued accessibility and safety of their data. Yet\nas we have also shown, depending on their techno-\nlogical know-how or lack of it people pursue different\nlogics and ways of making themselves feel comfortable\nabout their data, investing their trust in hardware, soft-\nware, and in the familiar feel of the routines through\nwhich they use various devices, platforms and apps.\nConclusion\nWe have been concerned in this article with not just\nthe anxieties that surround everyday data, but how\nthese are experienced and articulated, what measures,\ntrade-offs, and tricks people undertake to cope with or\ndisperse anxieties, and how they are subsequently able\nto trust that their data will be sufficiently safe. In doing\nso we have advanced a processual theory of trust that\nmaps out how people cope with the inevitable uncer-\ntainty and contingency of the emergent circumstances\nof everyday life. We have proposed that humans cope\nwith uncertainty by building familiar routines of activ-\nity. It is these circumstances that create situations in\nwhich they can trust, and as such are able to evade\nfeelings of anxiety about what will happen next and\nhave sufficient confident to improvise to fill in the\ngaps as they move forward. Our findings regarding\nhow people feel about their data and the technologies\nthey use, and how trust is part of this configuration,\ndemonstrate how this works in practice and as such\nestablishes the theory of how people live with data\nthat we proposed at the beginning of this article.\nThis has implications for how we understand what is\nof value to people in their dealings with data, because it\nhighlights what people need to do or have in order to\nfeel comfortable living out their everyday lives with\ndata. Importantly, our findings show that the HCI\nendeavour to understand human trust in technologies\nor interfaces is not sufficient, and can be usefully\nexpanded through a design anthropological theory\nthat locates trust as a constitutive part of the circum-\nstances that configure to generate the human confi-\ndence needed to improvise. This focus on existing\neveryday life engagements with data, moreover implies\nhow we might start to think differently about datafied\nfutures. This is because, if we can understand how\npeople are already finding ways to live comfortably\nwith digital data and the uncertainties that are asso-\nciated with it, then this has implications for how we\nmight design appropriate ways to live with data in the\nfuture. Knowing how people manage their lives with\ndata in the present, helps us to consider how the pos-\nsibilities presented by smart home, smart city and other\ntechnological visions might actually play out in a world\nthat social science research has shown clearly is char-\nacterised by digital `mess' (Dourish and Bell, 2011) and\nwill not approximate anything like that advanced by\nsmooth visions of technological innovation accompa-\nnied by predictable social change.\nTo consider futures we also need to attend to the\nspecificities of locality. All of our research sites had a\ncombination of local and international participants,\nand considered themselves active members of inter-\nnational communities of technology designers. Many\nof our participants spent time in online design commu-\nnities, shared code and strategies with other members of\nthese communities and were influenced and inspired by\nBitcoin, Blockchain and maker movements around the\nIn that sense they were as much part of these online\ntechnology communities as they were their local com-\nmunities in Barcelona and Melbourne. However, a\ncomparative perspective is also useful in showing up\nwhy global situatedness can matter. In Barcelona our\nfieldsite was focused in the FabLab where many organ-\nisations are based, but in Melbourne such groups are\ndispersed across the city. The two sites were also differ-\nently supported and/or impacted by national and regio-\nnal (e.g. European) funding structures and\nopportunities. For example, in Barcelona the initiatives\nwe researched tended to be publicly funded whereas in\nMelbourne there was a higher degree of private invest-\nment; and Barcelona was generally seen as more central\nto the global technology innovation scene than\nMelbourne which had a sense of being more peripheral\ndespite its reputation as a global centre of design. As a\nresult, Barcelona participants had a stronger sense of\nconfidence with reference to the safety of their data, in\npart because they felt confident in their knowhow and\nin part because they lived with their data in ways that\nblurred the distinctions between personal and work\nlives. In contrast Melbourne participants were more\nconcerned with maintaining data privacy and often\nkept a clearer division between their professional and\nprivate lives. But at the day-to-day level, much of what\nwe observed at various meetings and in the workplace\nlooked very similar and many of the attitudes and\naspirations towards the promise of their activities\nrevealed what Tom Boellstorff (2012) describes as the\npolitics of similitude rather than national cultural\ndisjuncture.\nAs we have shown, we live in a world where people\ndo not usually feel sure that their data is secure, could\nnot be lost, stolen or somehow compromised. That is,\nliving with data means living in a world of uncertainty,\nwhere this vulnerability is taken for granted, and the\nbest that can be done is to devise a way of living with\ndata that pushes aside anxieties and feels `alright'.\nWhat feels alright for different individuals varies and\nthere is no single template, logic or set of principles that\nis universally followed. Often people are chaotic and\nidiosyncratic in the ways they make, accumulate, look\nafter, or fail to look after digital data. Thus, data do\nnot tend to be organised by people in discrete and com-\nplete ways that are coherent with the understandings\nthat software designers have of computer systems,\nand do not necessarily fit with processes of audit and\ngovernance. Moreover, as is well established in critical\nwith objective meanings that can be stolen. Rather it\nis contingent, in its meanings and in the ways that it is\norganised. In this sense, when we take as our example\nthe kinds of data that ordinary people store on their\npersonal and work computers, such materials cannot\nreally exist as a solid target for a cyber attack, indeed\nit difficult for such a dispersed target to be attacked at\nall. Instead, we can better understand cyber attacks not\n12 Big Data & Society\nas attacking data but as targeting the services and sys-\ntems that exist for storing and accessing data. It is these\nmeans for keeping and accessing data that give data its\nvalue because they enable us to use it. However, mas-\nsive scale cyber attacks are not the only, or the primary,\nthreats to our access to and the security of data. In this\narticle we have started to investigate the question of\nhow people live with data and create their own ways\nof experiencing it as relatively secure. This, we argue is\nimportant to know, since without an understanding of\nhow people actually use, improvise with and feel about\neveryday mundane data, and what they already do to\ncreate the circumstances in which they can trust that it\nis `safe enough' we will not have the background under-\nstandings that are needed for us to design for possible\nbetter data futures.\n"
