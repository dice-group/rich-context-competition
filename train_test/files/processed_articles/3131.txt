The percent\nshould be corrected from 70% to 45%, and the word \"street\" immediately prior to dealers should be\nremoved, as some dealers were students. The correct sentence is \"In addition, 45% of the Delaware\n11th graders and 31% of the sex workers interviewed purchased prescription drugs from dealers.\""
