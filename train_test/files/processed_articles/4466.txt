Graham and\nBailey (2007) claimed that appropriate support systems for\nisolated families are not yet available, and a recent report has\nidentified that there is a lack of services in rural and remote\nareas and suggested that the distance and costs involved in\ntravel to access services in the city compound the already\nconsiderable effects of isolation (DET, 2010). The current\nstudy reports on a pilot investigation of the effectiveness and\nfeasibility of using Voice Over the Internet Protocol (VoIP)\nto deliver reading intervention services to children in rural\nand remote regions.\nVoIP is an Internet-based protocol that allows two or more\nindividuals to videoconference from remote locations. It is\nusually freely available for users (e.g., Skype) or comes bun-\ndled with computer operating systems (e.g., the Apple\nMacintosh iChat software) and can be used, usually without\ndifficulty, by anyone with an Internet connection, a micro-\nphone, and a webcam.

Screen sharing also allows the teacher to provide\nprompts (e.g., by highlighting parts of words using the\nmouse), to make modifications to words (e.g., such as in\nletter\u00adsound manipulation games--changing sit to sat to pat\nto pit and so on), and to use a blank document to present new\n1Griffith University, Southport, Queensland,Australia\n2Understanding Minds, Mermaid Beach, Queensland,Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nCraig Wright, Griffith University, Parklands Drive, Southport, Queensland\nEmail: c.wright@griffith.edu.au\nVoice Over the Internet Protocol\nas a Medium for Delivering Reading\nIntervention: Evidence From\na Single Case\nCraig Wright1, 2, Elizabeth G.

First, there\nare benefits to parents and children in terms of improving\naccess to quality services and reducing costs. Second, there\nare potential advantages for the state and economy due to the\npossibility of centering instruction services around centers of\nexcellence rather than having intervention services spread\nthroughout a state or the nation. It is expected that VoIP\ninstruction would represent a third tier of intervention for chil-\ndren with refractory reading weaknesses. Third-tier interven-\ntions are the most intensive in a response-to-intervention\nmodel and are implemented when students have not responded\nto ideal class instruction and to evidence-based, small-group\ninstruction within the school setting (Fuchs, 2003).\nCharacteristics of Effective Reading\nPrograms\nChildren with refractory reading difficulties (RD) are likely\nto require intensive interventions that specifically target\nweaknesses within reading subsystems (e.g., Wright &\nConlon, 2009). It is generally held that students with RD\nwill require instruction that targets one or more of the fol-\nlowing: phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, fluency,\nspelling, teaching of high-frequency irregular words, and\nvocabulary and comprehension strategies (e.g., Bowey,\nScience and Training, 2005; National Institute of Child\nHealth and Human Development, 2000; Reynolds, Wheldall,\nstudy will use Understanding Words (Wright, 2011) to\ndeliver reading instruction. The program allows the teacher\nto provide targeted and systematic instruction in any of the\nseven elements of reading instruction noted above. There is\nevidence that the program produces clinically meaningful\ngains in reading skills in complex populations (Wright &\nStudy Design and Hypotheses\nThis study used a single-case research design with a\nfollow-up. It was predicted that growth would be negligi-\nble during baseline and that introduction of treatment\nwould covary with positive growth in reading ability.\nFinally, it was predicted that reading growth would be less\nmarked when formal treatment was removed during the\nmaintenance period.\nMethod\nParticipant\nBM was a 10-year-old, right-handed male who was in Grade\n4 at a rural school. There is a history of learning difficulties\nand nonspecific learning support. He was referred to a pri-\nvate development psychology clinic for assessment and\ntreatment of reading problems.\nPretreatment Assessment\nIntelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children\u00adFourth Edition (Wechsler, 2003). BM's\nfull-scale IQ was in the average range. Full-scale IQ is\nshown in Table 1.\nOral language. Oral language skills were assessed using\nthe Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (Semel,\nWiig, & Secord, 2003), the Test of Narrative Language (Gil-\nlam & Pearson, 2004), and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary\nTest (Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Table 1 shows BM's scores on\nthese tests. In summary, BM had mild expressive language\nweaknesses. His receptive language skills were normal.\nMathematics. The Numerical Operations subtest from the\nWechsler Individual Achievement Test\u00adSecond Edition\n(Wechsler, 2003) was used to assess skill in mathematics.\nBM's score was in the average range (standard score = 99),\nindicating that the weaknesses in reading and language did\nnot extend to maths.\nAttention. The Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS;\nBarkley & Murphy, 2006) was used to screen for attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The DBRS includes\ntwo forms for parent and teacher report. Each form assesses\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th\ned.; DSM-IV;American Psychiatric association, 1994) symp-\ntoms of ADHD. Symptoms are rated on a 4-point scale\n(never/rarely, sometimes, often, and very often). Items rated\nas often or very often were scored as positive symptoms and\nitems rated as sometimes or never/rarely were scored as neg-\native symptoms (Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, &\nTable 1.

Ratings were obtained from BM's mother,\nhis current teacher, and his teacher from the previous school\nyear. In summary, none of the raters reported significant\nsymptoms of ADHD.\nOutcome Measures\nWord-Level Reading Skills. Four different tests of word-\nlevel reading skills were used. These were the Castles\nand Coltheart regular-, irregular-, and nonword lists (CC2;\nCastles et al., 2009) and a curriculum-based measure of non-\nword decoding.\nCastles and Coltheart word lists. The revised version of the\nCC2 (Castles et al., 2009) was used to assess word-level\nreading skills. The CC2 includes three word lists each of 40\nwords: regular-, irregular-, and nonwords. The test is avail-\nable in two formats: a web-based version and a pencil-and-\npaper PDF version (see http://www.motif.org.au). The web\nversion was used in the current study and was administered\nface-to-face. The child is presented with the items for read-\ning aloud, one at a time, until he or she makes five consecu-\ntive errors on any single item type.At that point, presentation\nof that type of word list is ceased. Testing proceeds until the\nchild makes five consecutive errors on the final item type.\nCurriculum-based nonword reading test. A curriculum-based\nnonword reading test (hereafter referred to as CBM Non-\nwords) was constructed. The participants read 88 nonwords\nconstructed from each of the grapheme-to-phoneme conver-\nsion (GPC) rules taught in Level A of the intervention pro-\ngram (program name and reference removed to enable blind\nreview). The items were presented on a 13.3-inch Apple\nMacintosh Macbook computer using Mac OS X v10.6 oper-\nating software. Each word was embedded in a Microsoft\nPower Point file in 48-point Comic Sans font. The words\nwere presented to BM in slide show mode where the assessor\npressed an arrow key to introduce subsequent words after the\nfirst word had been attempted. No feedback was provided.\nReading Comprehension. The Neale Analysis of Reading\nAbility--Third Edition (NARA-III) (Neale, 1999) was admin-\nistered as a measure of reading comprehension. Form 1 was\nused at the initial assessment and Form 2 at the conclusion of\nthe 10-week treatment (r\nxx\n= .71 for internal consistency for\nForm 1 and r\nxx\n= .81 for Form 2; parallel form reliability r =\n.86; maximum raw score = 44). There are four questions for\nthe first passage and eight for each passage thereafter.\nText Reading Accuracy. The NARA-III (Neale, 1999) was\nused to assess text reading accuracy. Form 1 was used at the\ninitial assessment and Form 2 at the conclusion of the\n10-week treatment (r\nxx\n= .95 for internal consistency for\nForms 1 and 2; parallel form reliability r = .98; maximum\nProcedure\nThe study was conducted under the auspices of a private\nclinic, and use of the data was authorized via University\nHuman Research Ethics Committee arrangements. Following\nthe initial assessment, the family was invited to participate\nin a pilot program that had the stated aim of investigating\nwhether VoIP could be used to deliver reading intervention\nfor children with RD. Following their consent, all services\nwere provided gratis.\nAll measures were administered at initial assessment. The\nCBM Nonwords were administered weekly. The first author\ndelivered the treatment. The initial three sessions occurred\nface-to-face, and thereafter, all sessions were run remotely\nusing VoIP. Sessions occurred 4 times weekly and ran for ~40\nmin (43 sessions in total). All assessments occurred face-to-\nface with the exception of the weekly CBM Nonwords,\nwhich were tested using the iChat VoIP medium.\nIntervention Procedures\nTeaching Program. Understanding Words (Wright, 2010)\nwas used to deliver reading intervention. The effectiveness\nof the program for improving reading skills has been demon-\nstrated previously in traditional face-to-face format (Wright\ncurriculum of Understanding Words contains seven strands:\nphonological awareness, phonics, spelling, fluency, irregular\nwords, vocabulary, and comprehension strategies. A brief\nsummary of the types of activities used in each strand is pro-\nvided below.\nPhonological awareness. Understanding Words teaches\nphonological awareness until the student can identify initial,\nmedial, and final phonemes in cvc, ccvc, and cvcc words and\nwhen the student can blend and segment phonemes in vc,\ncvc, ccvc, cvcc, and ccvcc words. As BM had mastered all\nskills, the phonological awareness strand did not form part of\nthe current treatment.\nPhonics. Approximately 10 min of each session was\ndevoted to phonics. A maximum of one new GPC rule was\nintroduced per session. BM was explicitly taught the new\nGPC, and the act of phonological decoding was reinforced\nvia reading of words lists. The words in each list consisted of\nthe new GPC and GPCs previously mastered. The grapheme\nsequence in Level A of the program is as follows: t, a, s, p, i,\nn, d, o, ck, e, m, r, h, u, f, l, b, g, ai, j, oa, w, ay, ch, tch, sh, th,\nqu, final \"e,\" ng, oo, ee, x, or, igh.\nIrregular words. Approximately 2 to 3 min of each session\nwas devoted to high-frequency irregular words (those that\ncannot be or can only partially be identified using phonologi-\ncal decoding strategies, for example, \"put\"). The words were\nselected from the Children's Printed Word Database (Mas-\nterton, Stuart, Dixon, & Lovejoy, 2003) and were taught\n4 SAGE Open\nusing a combination of flashcards and spelling--methods\nthat have been shown to be effective in improving lexical\nprocessing in single cases (e.g., Kohnen, Nickels, Brunsdon,\nSpelling. Spelling activities occupied up to 5 min. Spelling\nserved two purposes. First, spelling was used to reinforce\nnew and old GPCs. When a new GPC was introduced, BM\nwas asked to spell unfamiliar regular words that included the\nnew GPC and previously mastered GPCs. Second, spelling\nwas used to reinforce the orthographic patterns in irregular\nwords (see above).\nFluency. Repeated oral reading of sentences and stories\nwas used to address fluency. The sentences and stories were\nall part of the program. The sentences and stories were writ-\nten to be as decodable as possible and to contain as many of\nthe irregular words as possible. For example, if BM had\nlearned all of the single-letter sounds, that the digraph \"ai\"\nrepresents/ae/and the irregular word \"put,\" he might read the\nsentence: \"Ted put his bag on the train.\" These activities\ncomprised 5 to 10 min of session time.\nVocabulary. Understanding Words (Wright, 2010) uses a\nmethod for teaching vocabulary that borrows from Correc-\ntive Reading (e.g., Engelmann, Osborn, & Hanner, 1999)\nand the rich vocabulary approach (e.g., McKeown & Beck,\n2004). BM was taught that many English words can have\nmultiple meanings depending on context and that the best\nclues to the meaning of a novel word can be found in sen-\ntence context. The teacher then presents a target word (pro-\nduce) in a sentence (e.g., Maggie helped her Mum produce a\nchocolate cake). BM was asked to use the context to identify\nthe meaning of the target produce. The activity continues\nwith a discussion of things BM has produced himself or\nthings he owns that have been produced by others. Finally,\nthe target produce was placed in oral sentences, and BM had\nto repeat the sentence using a synonym (e.g., Maggie helped\nher Mum produce a chocolate cake).\nOral sentence comprehension. The student engages in oral\ncomprehension of simple and then complex sentences. For\nexample, the activities begin with simple subject\u00adverb sen-\ntences (Dad drove) and BM was asked questions that had to\nbe answered specifically (e.g., Who drove [Dad]; What did\nDad do? [Drove]). Later activities present subject\u00adpredicate\nsentences (Dad drove to work; What did Dad do? [Drove];\nWho drove? [Dad]; Where did Dad drive? [To work]) and\ncomplex sentences (Dad drove to work because he was lazy;\nWhat did Dad do? [Drove]; Who drove? [Dad]; Where did\nDad drive? [To work]; Why did Dad drive to work? [Because\nhe was lazy]; Who is lazy? [Dad]). BM was taught similar\nstrategies for \"understanding\" passive sentences and how\nwords such as before, after, as, during, when, then, during,\nunder, over, above, below, first, and next contribute to sen-\ntence meaning.\nInference activities. Inference activities begin by teaching\nthat sentences do not always include all the information we\nmight need for comprehension. For example, BM repeated\nthe sentence \"Kate hates eating toast at breakfast\" and was\nasked specific questions about sentence meaning (see sen-\ntence comprehension above). He was then asked whether the\nsentence tells why Kate hates toast and whether Kate eats\ncereal for breakfast (the answer being no to both). The\nteacher then explained that sentences provide facts but that\nsometimes we have to go beyond what the sentence tells us\ndirectly to help with comprehension. BM then learned how\nto play a \"Yes, No, Maybe\" game in which he repeated a\nsentence (e.g., Jack ate all his lunch) and was then asked\nquestions to which he had to answer yes, no, or maybe. The\nmaybe questions (e.g., Did Jack have yoghurt for lunch?) tap\ninformation that is not contained in the sentence. The notion\nof drawing an inference is then introduced by using words\nsuch as all, some, always, and sometimes. For example, BM\nmight repeat \"Jack ate all his lunch\" and was then asked\n\"Was there anything left in his lunchbox?\" (No). BM then\nbegan to make cohesive inferences by providing him with\ntwo facts (e.g., All cats are black; Snowy is a cat) and requir-\ning him to answer a question that required an inference based\non the facts (e.g., What else do we know about Snowy? She/\nHe is . . . black).\nReading comprehension. The oral sentence comprehension\nmethod described above is carried into reading after the oral\nmethod is mastered. BM read sentences (e.g., The dog dug a\nhole in the backyard) and then read and answered questions\nthat required specific answers: \"What dug?\" (The dog),\n\"What did the dog do?\" (Dug), \"What did the dog dig?\" (A\nhole), Where did the dog dig a hole? (In the backyard), and\n\"What did the dog do in the backyard?\" (Dug a hole).\nTreatment delivery. The study used an Apple Macintosh\nplatform with the Mac OS X operating system. Videoconfer-\nencing and screen sharing was accomplished with the iChat\nAV v.3 (Apple Computer, Inc., 2004), a software program\nResults\nBM's scores in the baseline period, after the 10-week inter-\nvention, and at 10-week follow-up are shown in Figures 1\nBaseline Data and Reading Growth\nBM had poor lexical and nonlexical reading skills. His z\nscore on the CC2 irregular-word test was -2.17 (second\npercentile). His nonword reading score from the CC2 was\n-2.68 (lesser than first percentile). Text-reading accuracy\nfrom the NARA-III was in the first percentile and reading\ncomprehension in the second percentile.\nGrowth on the CBM Nonwords measure over each of the\nthree 10-week stages of the study (baseline, treatment, and\nmaintenance) is shown graphically in Figure 1. Little growth\nin nonword reading occurred during baseline. In contrast,\nsubstantial improvement occurred over the treatment period.\nWright et al. 5\nThere was also an upward trend in the maintenance period;\nhowever, the growth slope was substantially shallower than\nwhen formal treatment was being provided.\nFigure 2 shows gains made on the CC2 word-reading lists\nover the three 10-week stages of the study. There was little\ngrowth in any of the different types of word-reading skills\nacross baseline. In contrast, sharp improvements can be seen\nduring the treatment period on the CC2 regular- and non-\nword-reading measures. These gains were maintained at the\nconclusion of the 10-week maintenance period. There was\nno obvious trend for gains in irregular-word reading at any\nstage of the study.\nQuantitative Analysis of Reading Gains\nTo assess BM's reading gains quantitatively, it was neces-\nsary to adopt a rule of thumb against which the clinical\nsignificance of changes could be compared. Some studies\nhave used posttreatment status (e.g., a posttest standard\nscore of 90) as a benchmark for clinically significant\nresponse to intervention (Torgesen, 2000; Torgesen et al.,\n2001). However, this method may obscure the amount of\nreading growth in response to intervention (Fuchs, 2003). To\nassess the clinical significance of BM's reading growth, we\nobtained the standard deviation of the relevant raw score\ndistribution for the CC2 word-reading tests (Castles et al.,\n2009) and the NARA-III text-reading accuracy and reading\ncomprehension tests (Neale, 1999). These data were obtained\nfrom the test manuals. The CC2 SD was based on a 10- to\n10.5-years-aged cohort, and the NARA-III SD was based on\na grade-level cohort.\nThe criterion then required BM to make change of 0.8 of\na standard deviation from the highest of the two baseline\nmeasures to posttreatment. The 0.8 standard deviations rule\nof thumb was selected because it represents a large effect\nBM made >0.8 of a standard deviation change from base-\nline to posttreatment on all measures except the CC2 irregu-\nlar-word list. The amount of change on each measure with\nthe exception of CC2 irregular-words list was equivalent to a\nPosttreatment Reading Status\nAt 10-week maintenance, BM's z score on the CC2 regular-\nword test was -1.32 (9th percentile). His z score on the\nirregular-word test was -2.48 (1st percentile). His nonword\nreading score from the CC2 was -1.4 (8th percentile). Text-\nreading accuracy from the NARA-III was in the 4th percen-\ntile and reading comprehension in the 10th percentile at\nposttreatment.\nTreatment Satisfaction\nBM's mother indicated being satisfied with his response dur-\ning the treatment. She also indicated that she was very satis-\nfied withVoIPas a platform for delivering reading instruction.\nShe identified that it allowed BM to access services to which\nhe might not otherwise have had access. She also identified\ncosts savings in terms of travel and savings in time because\nthe instruction was delivered within the home.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to provide a pilot investiga-\ntion of whether VoIP provides a platform via which effective\nreading instruction can be delivered to students in rural and\nremote regions. The preliminary answer is yes. The inter-\nvention covaried with substantial gains in the ability to rec-\nognize and/or phonologically decode novel words. Gains\nin regular- and nonword reading also covaried with substan-\ntial improvements in text-reading accuracy and reading\ncomprehension.\nCBM Nonwords raw score\nWeek and Stage of Study\nCBM Nonwords\nFigure 1.

Indeed, single-case research is con-\nsidered a rigorous scientific method that can form part of the\nprocess of establishing evidence-based practices (Horner et\nal., 2005). In single-case research, an independent variable\n(e.g., reading intervention) is systematically varied to docu-\nment a functional relationship between independent and\ndependent variables. Performance during treatment is con-\ntrasted with performance during, preferably, multiple base-\nlines and untreated periods. An experimental effect is\ndemonstrated when predicted change in a dependent vari-\nable (e.g., improvements in reading) covaries with manipu-\nlation of the independent variable (onset and/or cessation of\nIn this study, little growth was seen during the no-treat-\nment baseline. In contrast, substantial growth in regular- and\nnonword reading was seen in the 10-week treatment phase.\nFurthermore, removing treatment during the maintenance\nsubstantially slowed growth in all word-level skills. This\ncovariation of treatment onset and removal with growth and\nnongrowth in reading therefore provides evidence that the\neffects were due to the treatment itself and not due to some\nother psychosocial variable.\nWhile a single case on its own cannot be considered to\nprovide strong support for evidence-based practice, this\nstudy at least provides preliminary evidence that VoIP-based\ninstruction can be effective. Furthermore, the current results\nindicate that VoIP-based instruction is an important area for\nfuture investigation.\nDifferentTypes of Reading Improvement\nThe principle gains seen in this study were in regular- and\nnonword reading. This is unsurprising given the emphasis on\nphonics. In contrast, irregular-word reading remained static\nthroughout the three phases of the study. The simple expla-\nnation for this is that while irregular words were taught in\nthe intervention program, they were not the same words as\non the CC2 test. By their very nature, irregular words cannot\nbe decoded using phonological information (at least not\ncompletely), and irregular-word training may not generalize\nto untaught words (Broom & Doctor, 1995).\nGains were seen in text-reading accuracy and reading\ncomprehension that were equivalent to a strong effect size\n(Cohen, 1992). However, conclusions about these skills must\nbe tempered by the fact that only pre\u00adpost measures of these\nskills were acquired. There is therefore less evidence for\ntheir covariation with onset and removal of treatment than\nthere is for the word-level skills discussed above.\nNevertheless, they at least provide preliminary hope that\nVoIP-based instruction can also deliver meaningful gains in\ntext-reading and comprehension.\nAdvantages ofVoIP\nIt is unlikely that VoIP will produce better gains than tradi-\ntional face-to-face teaching or therapy (although it may\nproduce comparable gains). However, where such services\nare unavailable, it may represent an effective alternative. Its\nadvantages seem to lie mainly in ease of access and lower\ncosts. The treatment in this study was delivered from a num-\nber of remote locations--the first author ran teaching ses-\nsions from his office, from home, and in other locations\nwhile away on business. BM was able to videoconference\nfrom a room at his school, at home, and when away on a\nfamily trip. It was time-effective in that there was no travel\nto a mutual venue for either teacher or student. The sessions\nsimply involved logging onto iChat using an Internet con-\nnection. This ease of use may represent advantages for\nfuture government and nongovernment projects because\nteaching can be delivered from anywhere, thus reducing\ncosts. Second, while some children who have RD will\nrespond quickly to an outreach service such as that mooted\nby the New South Wales (NSW) Centre for Effective\nReading, there will remain a significant minority who will\nhave refractory reading problems. These children will\nrequire significant and intensive intervention and support\nfrom their parent school and possibly from private bodies\noutside of school. Unfortunately, this intervention and sup-\nport is not always available in many rural and remote loca-\ntions. While the recent DET review associated with the\nNSW Centre for Effective Reading (DET, 2010) has noted\nthe need for effective professional development and for\ntraining young teachers in evidence-based practices, there is\nstill no guarantee that sufficient skill or the time and finan-\ncial resources to deploy that skill effectively will be avail-\nable \"at the coalface\" in rural and remote schools. If VoIP\nproves effective in larger studies, it may allow government\nor nongovernment organizations to concentrate teaching\nassets in one or several locations and thus ensure that quality\nteaching services are provided to children in rural and\nremote regions. Finally, VoIP could also be a useful tool in\nan urban area to reduce travel time and costs for parents. It\nwould allow reading specialists to provide services to a\nlarger client base due to reduced travel time.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe principle limitation is inherent in the single-case design.\nIt is not clear from a single case just how far the results will\ngeneralize. Future research will be required using students\nwho have a range of characteristics to determine which chil-\ndren respond best to this novel treatment delivery format.\nFor example, it may be that students who have ADHD may\nnot respond as well because VoIP makes it more difficult,\nrelative to face-to-face teaching, to manage inattentive and/\nor challenging behavior. This could be accomplished using a\nmultiple case-series design. Studies should also investigate\nWright et al. 7\nthe characteristics of teachers who provide the best instruc-\ntion via VoIP. Future research should also use control group\ndesigns to investigate whether VoIP has comparable efficacy\nto face-to-face teaching. Finally, the intensity of the current\nintervention delivered by a skilled teacher will not be easy\nto replicate in the real world. It is more likely that students\nwill receive a less intensive intervention (e.g., one to two\nsessions per week). Future studies should seek to determine\nthe minimum intensity required to make meaningful change.\nStudies should also investigate whether parents are capable\nof increasing the intensity of therapist-led intervention by\nadministering treatment between therapist sessions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
