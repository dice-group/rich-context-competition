    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nObjective To count and characterise injuries resulting\nfrom legal intervention by US law enforcement personnel\nand injury ratios per 10 000 arrests or police stops, thus\nexpanding discussion of excessive force by police beyond\nfatalities.\nDesign Ecological.\nPopulation Those injured during US legal police\nintervention as recorded in 2012 Vital Statistics mortality\ncensus, 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project\nnationwide inpatient and emergency department\nsamples, and two 2015 newspaper censuses of deaths.\nof Investigation data adjusted for non-reporting\njurisdictions; street stops and traffic stops that involved\nvehicle or occupant searches, without arrest, from the\n2011 Police Public Contact Survey (PPCS), with the\npercentage breakdown by race computed from pooled\ncounts.\nResults US police killed or injured an estimated 55 400\ncoded as police involved). Blacks, Native Americans and\npopulation than white non-Hispanics and Asians. On\naverage, an estimated 1 in 291 stops/arrests resulted in\nhospital-treated injury or death of a suspect or\nbystander. Ratios of admitted and fatal injury due to\nlegal police intervention per 10 000 stops/arrests did not\ndiffer significantly between racial/ethnic groups. Ratios\nrose with age, and were higher for men than women.\nConclusions Healthcare administrative data sets can\ninform public debate about injuries resulting from legal\npolice intervention. Excess per capita death rates among\nblacks and youth at police hands are reflections of\nexcess exposure. International Classification of Diseases\nlegal intervention coding needs revision.\nBACKGROUND\nOf necessity, police sometimes injure or kill a felon\nto protect the public or themselves. Police use of\nundue force is an enduring tinderbox issue in\nAmerica.1\u00ad4 In the aftermath of the Civil War,\nadoption of the 14th Amendment to the\ntections against police use of excessive force or\nother punishment without due process of law.\nA unanimous US Supreme Court affirmed the\napplicability of these protections to the police-\nabetted murder of civil rights workers Schwerner,\nPolice instructors often teach officers about force\ncontinuums where police response progressively\nadjusts to match the changing level of suspect\nresistance.6\u00ad8 Some have started teaching\nde-escalation techniques.9\nLegal protections and training, however, cannot\nprevent every abuse of power or police loss of\ncontrol out of anger or fear. Recently, US press and\npublic outcry protested police shootings of\nunarmed citizens and potentially negligent deaths\nin police custody.10 Discussion has focused almost\nexclusively on fatalities, driven by Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI)11 statistics on deaths due to\nlegal intervention by law enforcement personnel\n(hereafter called legal police intervention), and by\nnewspaper-compiled censuses that reveal the FBI\nreports omit half the fatalities.12 13 Periodic Police\nPublic Contact Surveys (PPCS) also find that blacks\nare more likely than whites or Hispanics to experi-\nence physical force during a police-initiated stop.14\nVital statistics and healthcare claims\nadministrative data sets contain a wealth of\nuntapped information about the extent and nature\nof suspect/bystander injury resulting from legal\npolice intervention. The International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD), 9th and 10th revisions, define\nlegal intervention as `injuries inflicted by the police\nor other law-enforcing agents ... in the course of\narresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, sup-\npressing disturbances, maintaining order, and other\nlegal actions'. Some of these injuries involve undue\nforce.\nThis article uses ICD-coded national data to close\ninformation gaps. It estimates non-fatal injuries\nresulting from legal police intervention. It adds\ninsights by comparing injuries from legal police\nintervention versus assault and using police arrest\nand stop counts as denominators to compute injury\nratios.\nMETHODS\nWe used SAS V\non non-fatal injury from the Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient\nSample (NIS) and Nationwide Emergency\nDepartment Sample (NEDS).15 16 We extracted and\ncleaned injury cases from NIS and NEDS following\npublished procedures,17 and coded the injuries by\nbody region and by Abbreviated Injury Severity\nthreat to life using ICDmap90 software.18 Legal\npolice intervention cases were identified by ICD,\n9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM)\ninjuries, we searched for an electroshock diagnosis\nmated lifetime medical costs for each case using\nmethods and cost factors from the online\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nWISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting\ncode intent separately from mechanism. Multiyear WISQARS\ncounts had wide CIs and were too thin to provide stable esti-\nmates by demographics or for many mechanisms. They did\nyield insight into mechanisms where the ICD10-CM coding\nsystem that replaced ICD9\u00adCM in 2015 inappropriately lacks\nlegal police intervention codes.\nFatalities\nDeaths from legal police intervention are underidentified or\nundercounted in US Vital Statistics, FBI Supplemental Homicide\nReports, and Bureau of Justice Statistics Arrest-Related Deaths\nprogramme data.21\u00ad24 A modified capture-recapture modelling\nwhile comparisons with National Violent Death Reporting\ncapture.24 The Washington Post used daily press searches and sup-\nplemental crowdsourcing to track US firearm deaths due to police\naction during 2015, verifying and detailing each identified\ndeath.12 The Guardian25 compiled a similar list that added non-\nfirearm deaths, as well as deaths in custody and deaths in crashes\nwhere police vehicles were at fault.13 Consistent with the capture-\nrecapture models, both found about twice as many legal police\nintervention incidents as the three national reporting systems.\nSeveral epidemiological studies found systematically searched\nnewspaper accounts a credible injury data source.26\u00ad30 We there-\nfore relied primarily on homicide estimates by demographic\ngroup from the Guardian data,25 excluding 41 deaths in custody\n(primarily cardiovascular or other health crises) and 33 in\ncrashes. For half of the 24 cases with missing demographic data,\nwe back-filled this information from the Washington Post listing.\nDemographic tabulations\nWe tabulated data by victim age group, sex, race and Hispanic\nethnicity, rurality, mechanism (eg, firearm), and, for hospital\nadmissions, by alcohol and drug involvement of the person\ninjured. All tables were run in SAS V\n.9.4., applying sample\nweights to the HCUP data, which are public use samples of\napproximately 20% of all US discharges.\nData deficits limited our analysis of race-ethnicity. NEDS\ncannot supply nationally representative race-ethnicity estimates\nbecause many states do not either identify race and ethnicity or\ncollect emergency department (ED) data centrally. We therefore\nrestricted the race-ethnicity analysis to fatal and\nhospital-admitted injuries.\nDenominators\nAs denominators for producing injury ratios, we used the sum\nof FBI-tabulated arrest data, adjusted for non-reporting,31 and\n2011 PPCS-based national estimates (which we computed using\n.11) of police street stops without arrest and of traffic\nstops where a person or vehicle was searched but the person\nstopped was not arrested.32 In 2012, FBI arrest data largely\nexcluded Alabama, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois\n(except Chicago and Rockford) and New York City, and lacked\ndemographic detail for Florida. Online search provided arrest\ndata that we manually added for three of these jurisdictions:\nremaining FBI-reported data to US estimates under the assump-\ntion that arrest rates by region for the 82% of the US population\ncovered by the FBI data and our supplements were representa-\ntive of arrest rates in those regions in frequency and demograph-\nics. The FBI only began collecting Hispanic origin in 2013\narrest data, with reporting much more complete in 2014 than\nfor New York City.37 38 Our analyses classified all minority\nHispanics (eg, five of the deceased) by their minority race. We\nassumed white Hispanics would constitute the same 28.6% of\ncounts, because 2011 PPCS data were sparse for some racial\ngroups, we distributed them using an average percentage break-\ncomputed pairwise bivariate CIs between related demographic\ncategories (eg, male vs female).\nRESULTS\nWashington Post40 firearm death count was 990 and Bureau of\nLabor Statistics capture-recapture modelling estimated annual\ntreated in legal police intervention incidents (table 1, 95% CI\nwere treated in the ED and released. Firearms accounted for\n95% of fatalities and 23% of hospital admissions. Virtually all\nother fatalities involved electromuscular disruption by tasers,\nwith most of these deaths not immediate. Of more than 1700\nTable 1 Number of people treated in hospitals or killed annually due to legal police intervention by mechanism of injury, USA\nMechanism ED ED, also tasered* Admitted Fatal Total % admitted % fatal\nSource: Adjusted 2015 fatality count from The Guardian, injury counts from 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.\n*Cases in this column also are counted in the ED column.\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\ntaser-involved incidents, an estimated 65 resulted in hospital\nadmission and 48 were lethal. Medicolegal investigations,\nhowever, concluded that the large majority of these deaths were\nnot caused by the taser. A 2011 blue-ribbon medical panel\nreview of medicolegal findings on deaths after electromuscular\ndisruption suggests those determinations probably were\nPolice use of tear gas, mace or pepper spray rarely resulted in\nhospital admission. The large majority of non-fatal injuries\nstemmed from blows or blunt objects. Cases involving sharp\nobjects generally would involve police wounding someone while\nseizing his or her weapon. Because the ICD lacks an appropriate\ncause code, these figures exclude both people bitten by police\ninjuries by mechanisms where WISQARS could not provide\nstable counts. WISQARS data also suggested HCUP might be\nunderascertaining struck by/against injuries, but the WISQARS\nsample includes just 66 hospitals.\nEstimated lifetime medical costs for injuries from legal police\ntabulated). Modelled lifetime medical costs averaged $9550 for\npatient treated in the ED and released.\nIn every age group, the estimated probability of hospital\nadmission among legal police intervention injuries (5.0%) was\nlower than among other assault injuries (7.5%, not tabulated) in\n2012. The AIS threat-to-life profile for legal police intervention\nwas lower than for assaults. Among patients coded as\nhospital-admitted survivors of legal police intervention, 43%\nfaced only a minor threat to life (AIS-1) and 23% a moderate\nthreat (AIS-2). Hospital admissions for assault and legal police\nintervention, however, had similar injury profiles and virtually\nidentical modelled lifetime medical costs per case. Gunshot\nwounds were significantly more likely to be lethal if they\nresulted from legal police intervention than from assault (40%\nAmong patients coded as hospital-admitted survivors of legal\npolice intervention in 2012, 49% tested positive for alcohol,\ndrugs or both (not tabulated). The remainder either was not\ntested or tested negative.\nExposure and ratios of injury to exposure\nAs table 2 shows, in 2012, arrests accounted for an estimated\n12.3 million (76%) police interventions with a substantial\npotential for violence, street stops for 2.8 million (18%) and\ntraffic stops involving searches for 1.0 million (6%). The people\nwho were least likely to be arrested when stopped were over age\n65 years, Asian/Pacific Islander or living in non-metropolitan\nareas. Those with the highest arrest rates per 10 000 population\nwere ages 15\u00ad29 years, black or Native American.\nTable 3 provides demographic breakdowns of injury counts\nand ratios per 10 000 police stops/arrests. The differences in\nfatal plus non-fatal injury ratios by sex and by age group are sig-\nnificant at the 95% confidence level. An estimated 1 in every\n291 stops/arrests resulted in a death or medically treated injury\narrests. The coding does not differentiate bystanders from sus-\npects. The male injury ratio per 10 000 stops/arrests was more\nthan twice the female ratio, with even larger differentials for\nhospital-admitted and especially for fatal injuries. The estimated\ninjury ratio rose initially with age, peaked at ages 30\u00ad44 years,\nthen declined. The estimated hospital-admitted injury ratio rose\nsteadily with age, while the estimated fatality ratio rose through\nage 30 years, then plateaued. Those aged 65 years and over had\nthe highest probability of dying if injured during a stop/arrest.\nThe injury ratio was almost three times as high in metropolitan\nas in non-metropolitan counties.\nBoth estimated hospital-admitted and fatal injury ratios per\n10 000 stops/arrests did not differ significantly between racial/\nethnic groups. The low hospitalisation ratio for Native\nAmericans suggests that HCUP coding of this racial group is\nincomplete, with many mixed race individuals probably folded\ninto Other Race.\nUncertainty of the estimates\nThe estimates reported here are far from exact. The non-fatal\nincident counts are constrained by identification error resulting\nfrom faulty cause coding, but SEs for these HCUP counts as\ncoded are just 5\u00ad8% of the mean. Our denominator estimates\nof arrests and stops without arrest, however, have wide uncer-\ntainty ranges. SEs for the PPCS estimates in table 2 are about\nonly guess at the uncertainty in the arrest count because that\nuncertainty results from (1) lack of reporting by some jurisdic-\ntions, even entire states, with estimating their data unavoidably\nrequiring the questionable assumption that their arrest rates by\ndemographics are similar to rates in jurisdictions that chose to\nreport, and (2) an unknown amount of undercounting by some\njurisdictions that did report.42\nDISCUSSION\nOn average, an estimated 34 people were killed or medically\ntreated for injury by law enforcement per 10 000 stops/arrests.\nThat ratio is surprisingly consistent by race/ethnicity. Blacks have\nhigh arrest and stop rates,43 44 and per capita are much more\nlikely than whites to die at the hands of police.40 However,\nwhen blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely\nthan whites to be injured or die during that incident.\nConsistent with our findings, simulation studies find police\nare no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed\nwhites,45 and high rates of black speeding citations per capita\nresult from high violation rates.46\u00ad48 A systematic review identi-\nfied 10 studies that found suspect race/ethnicity did not predict\nuse of force or its escalation.6 However, one study found blacks\nwere more likely than whites to face force during compliance\nchecks.7 The PPCS survey also found that blacks were more\nlikely to experience physical force and to perceive the threat of\nforce during a stop, although few respondents actually were\ninjured by the force applied.14 The large majority of incidents\nthat those stopped perceived as undue force was stops where\nofficers shouted at or threatened people, presumably to deter\nresistance.\nFrequent police stops of young men have caused many black\nand some Hispanic mothers to teach their sons where to put\ntheir hands if approached by an officer, how to move and not\nmove, to ask permission before reaching for their wallet, and to\nrespond to police rudeness with respect.49 Those talks may have\nprotective effects.\nHigh severity among the elderly\nThe high hospital admission and death ratios among the injured\nelderly are consistent with their broader injury patterns.50 They\nmay result from brittle bones that are vulnerable in a police\nscuffle. Some deaths also may represent suicidal situations where\nsomeone deliberately forces an officer to pull the trigger or an\nofficer acts to stop a domestic murder-suicide.12 More research\nOriginal article\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nclearly is needed on police handling of elderly stops/arrests, and\non why they often lead to serious injury or death.\nJudicious use of force\nA core police role has long been considered judicious but not\nundue use of psychological and physical force to maintain\norder.4 51\u00ad54 Police also are trained to survive. The statistics\nsuggest that their training is largely protective, but violence\noccasionally escalates.55 We found that in 2012, legal police\nintervention resulted in an estimated 54 300 people being med-\nan estimated 67 000 law enforcement personnel were assaulted,\nnon-reporting jurisdictions).\nExcept in firearm incidents, injuries from legal police inter-\nvention posed a lower threat to life compared with medically\ntreated assault injuries. This finding suggests the police usually\nArrests Street stops Traffic stops with search Total % arrested Arrests Stops and arrests\nAge, years\nSource: Stops tabulated from 2011 Police Public Contact Survey, arrests from 2012 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data supplemented with local 2012 data; 2012 population\ncounts from US Census Bureau.\nTable 3 Number of people treated in hospitals or killed due to legal police intervention, injury ratios per 10 000 stops/arrests and percentages\nof injuries that were fatal by demographics, USA\n% Fatal\nED only Admitted Fatal ED only Admitted Fatal Total\nAge, years\nSource: Adjusted 2015 fatality count from The Guardian, 2012 injury counts from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and 2011 stops and 2012 arrests from table 2.

The Washington Post census of people killed by police\nestimated 74 per cent of victims were actively shooting at,\naiming weapons at, or (sometimes unarmed) attacking the\npolice.40 Still, 1 in 11 people who died due to law enforcement\naction in 2015 were unarmed. As case studies indicate,56 steps\nsuch as community-oriented policing, body cameras and inci-\ndent investigation using surveillance methods drawn from public\nhealth may de-escalate the violence.\nProblems with administrative data coding and multistate\nanalyses of firearm homicide\nCounts of Vital Statistics firearm mortality from legal police\nintervention are undercounts, as the newspaper enumerations\nshowed. Vital Statistics legal police intervention appropriately\nexcluded cases where police had been convicted, or remained\nunder investigation, for use of excessive force (coded, respect-\nively, as homicide and undetermined intent). They also failed to\ncode police involvement in an estimated 450 shootings annually.\nIf those deaths incorrectly were registered as homicides, they\nwould artificially inflate firearm homicide counts by 4%. Since\nmisreporting rates vary widely between states,21 and may be\nsubstantially lower in NVDRS states, this problem may have\nskewed all recent cross-sectional time series analyses of firearm\nhomicides. Research is urgently needed to determine the intent\nlogged for these firearm deaths, including extending the recent\ncapture-recapture modelling effort21 to incorporate Vital\nStatistics data.\nOur taser counts are tenuous because neither morbidity nor\nmortality coding assigns a code exclusively to taser. WISQARS\nsuggests legal police intervention was not codable for perhaps\n10 000 injuries, primarily from dog bites, falls or foreign\nbodies. Consistent with that estimate, dog bites accounted for\none-eighth of all reported injuries from legal police intervention\nin Miami-Dade county, Florida and Richland county, South\nCarolina.57 The injury coding also leaves ambiguities in the\nunknown number of cases where police only inflicted a portion\nof the person's injuries. For example, if police broke up a fight\nby tasering a brawler who already had suffered a knife wound\nand a broken nose, the medical record would simply catalogue\nthe electroshock and physical injuries, and report that they\noccurred in a legal police intervention incident.\nOther limitations\nThe available arrest data are incomplete, especially information\nabout Hispanic origin. This deficit forces us to make the imper-\nfect assumption that available data are representative. Similarly,\nthe sample is thin on the racial distribution of traffic stops, so\nthe Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American estimates are\nunstable. ED data were not coded by race, and the coding of\nNative Americans was suspect in the inpatient data.\nHealthcare administrative data sets clearly have value in inform-\ning public debate about injuries resulting from law enforcement.\nDrilling further into the data, especially with discharge censuses\nrather than a national sample, linking discharges to unit record\ndata on arrests, and possibly applying capture-recapture model-\nling, would detail the picture sketched here. Available state data\nurgently need to be tapped.\nGiven the frequency and potential lethality of these cases, the\nUS clinical modification to ICD10,58 and ideally ICD10 itself,\nshould add a code for legal intervention by taser. Legal interven-\ntion also should be a codable intent for dog bites, human bites,\nfalls (as the PPCS finds the most common physical contact with\npolice is a push), foreign bodies and transport.\nFBI arrest data are incomplete due to late or incomplete\npolice department reporting or refusal to report. Using local\ndata posted to the internet, we were able to add unreported\ndata from Alabama, Hawaii and New York City, and saw indica-\ntions that the District of Columbia had the missing data in its\ninformation system. To support accurate research, on injury risk\nduring arrest and on number of people arrested, we urge man-\ndatory reporting of arrests to the FBI. Moreover, we strongly\nsuggest that the FBI update its arrest data tables a year after the\noriginal closing date, in order to incorporate reports received\nafter its deadline.\nGiven a national history of racism, the excess per capita death\nrate of blacks from US police action rightly concerns policy ana-\nlysts, advocates and the press. The excess appears to reflect\nexposure. Blacks are arrested more often than whites, and youth\nmore often than the elderly. However, blacks are not more\nlikely than non-Hispanic whites to be killed or injured during a\nstop/arrest, and youth have the lowest injury ratios. Ratios aside,\neven one person unnecessarily killed or injured by the police is\none too many, and every racial/ethnic group has mourned losses\nfrom undue force. As the US struggles to reduce citizen injuries\nduring police contacts, it would seem prudent to train at-risk\ngroups about appropriate behaviour during police stops.\nWhat is already known on this subject?\n Minorities have a higher chance of being stopped by police,\narrested and being killed by police than non-Hispanic\nwhites.\n Untapped health data describe non-fatal injuries inflicted\nduring legal intervention by police.\n Injury risk for those stopped or arrested by police has not\nbeen analysed.\nWhat this study adds?\npeople, with an estimated 54 300 surviving hospital-treated\ninjuries.\n Estimated injury risk was 1 per 291 stops/arrests.\n While minorities were more likely to be stopped/arrested by\npolice, the probability of being killed/injured during a stop/\narrest did not vary by race.\nContributors TRM and BAL led study conceptualisation with inputs from the other\nauthors.
