    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article explores three ways intersubjectivity is implicated in an ethnography of the lived experience of members of\nan interfaith and labor coalition. First challenging dualistic thinking and the strict application of typologies, I emphasize the\nimportance of understanding faith practices through the study of lived experience. When one studies lived experience,\nseveral layers of intersubjectivity are at play. Because I grew up in a religious, working-class family, aspects of my life\nnow serve as cultural capital in understanding the daily challenges of coalition participants who redefine the institutional\nboundaries between religion and work. Furthermore, field interactions between the researcher and participants affect\nmembers' explanations of their activism. Finally, the life of the ethnographer is affected by the overall experience of fieldwork.\n",

The project locates\nreligious experiences within the everyday lives of practitio-\nners as they go to work, spend time with their families, and\ncare for others in their communities. I investigate these\ndimensions by illuminating areas of social life in which the\nboundaries of the sacred and the secular are being pushed\nand negotiated through interfaith labor activism.\nInterfaith Worker Justice of Greater Kansas City (IWJ-\nGKC), at the time of the study, was a diverse coalition of\nreligious practitioners and labor union members that mobi-\nlized to promote worker justice. They worked to fight eco-\nnomic, racial, and gender inequalities through the support of\nunionization, fair wages, keeping immigrant families united,\nand equal access to health care and jobs. Interfaith Worker\nJustice (IWJ)--the national organization located in Chicago\nof which IWJ-GKC became an affiliate--is currently focused\non mobilizing congregation-based and interfaith coalitions\nfor the fight against economic inequality. At the local level,\nactivists are challenged by the effort to push the cultures of\ntheir faith communities from mercy and service work to cul-\ntures focused on activism based on a moral responsibility to\nprinciples of human rights and social justice.\nIn this work, I not only look to understand lived religion\nbut also how lived religion interplays with lived labor activ-\nism and class in everyday experiences. IWJ-GKC partici-\npants claimed work and activism as realms of the sacred,\nimbued with religious meaning and inhabited by forms of\nreligious practice. By organizing low-wage workers, meet-\ning with union and company representatives, passing out fli-\ners, and raising a billboard on I-70 which read \"Love the\nImmigrant as Yourself,\" members of IWJ-GKC engaged\npractices that are at the same time religious as they are politi-\ncal and oriented toward class consciousness. In so doing,\nthey not only engaged forms of religious practice that carried\ninto everyday lived experience, through their struggles and\ninteractions they built new varieties of institutional ties,\nthereby transforming the American religious scene.\nThe present article is not about the ethnography and its find-\nings. Rather, it is a reflection on the experience of doing the\nethnography and treats the research process and its results as\nthe media through which to consider important theoretical and\nconceptual positionings. I draw on my experiences of studying\nlived religion to explore three levels of intersubjectivity\nimplicated in the process of doing research with religious\npersons who view religious--and other institutional--bound-\naries as permeable. When entering the field, the ethnographer's\npast, present, and future are implicated in the relationships one\ndevelops with research participants and subsequently affect the\nkinds of data gathered. In lived reality--that which treats the\nresearcher as a part of the lived experiences of others--the\nlives of the researcher and the researched become intricately\n1Kalamazoo College, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAmy M.

While it is possible to use aspects of one's own lived\nexperience to understand and engage others, the lived experi-\nences of the researcher can also serve as the media through\nwhich people of faith daily negotiate their own forms of reli-\ngious practice. In taking these processes and interactions\nseriously, the lived reality of the ethnographer himself or her-\nself may be changed. These intersubjective processes are\nillustrated below by connections to the ethnographic experi-\nence and the resultant data derived from my study with\nFirst, however, to contextualize the significance of inter-\nsubjectivity in the research process, I briefly discuss the limi-\ntations of dualistic thinking and the application of rigid\ntypologies. Viewing ethnographic work through the lens of\nintersubjectivity challenges these ways of categorizing the\nsocial world, and thereby the ethnographer gets closer to the\nlived experience of research participants. This closeness to\nlived experience, through the interactive intersections of\nintersubjectivity, provides a deeper look into the ways cul-\nture and structure penetrate human lives through their every-\nday practice.\nLiterature Review\nDeposing Dualisms\nThe explanatory power of studying from the perspective of\nlived experience means that all human action can be viewed\nwithout the risk of dismissal through the use of categories\nrooted in the biases of classical Western philosophy and\nsocial science. Much of this dismissal is due to dualistic\nthinking which placed \"reason\" in the realm of the \"mind\"\nand therefore it transcended lived experiences (Alcoff, 2000).\nSimilarly, much of classical sociology was based on this\ndualism and therefore pitted the \"subjective\" against the\n\"objective.\" Because lived experience was viewed as a mat-\nter of the body--and not reason--\"experiential qualities\n[were submerged] in the psyche [and] sociology has tended\nto argue that explorations of experience cannot be based on\nempirical evidence, only `on nondemonstrable intuitions\nabout the \"inner\" content of mental states'\" (Ostrow, 1990,\nAlcoff (2000) points out that the \"mind-body dualism\"\nwhich permeates Western thinking can be traced \"as far back\nas Plato\"; this dualism assumed that lived experience rested\nin the body--primarily experienced by women--whereas\nreason--primarily belonging to men--inhabited the mind\n(p. 41). Alcoff argues simply moving women into the realm\nof the mind while maintaining the mind\u00adbody dualism is not\nthe solution because this move effectively disregards the\nlived experiences that are central to human life and maintains\nthe masculinist notion that mind and body are always sepa-\nrate. What we need, instead, is to bring theory and experi-\nence closer together, understanding that theory--also\ndiscourse--and experience are \"imperfectly aligned, with\nlocations of disjuncture\" (Alcoff, 2000, p. 47). Weber under-\nstood this, as Ostrow (1990) argues. Even while proposing\nideal types, Weber emphasized the importance of under-\nstanding lived experience through his concept Verstehen.\nFrom Weber's perspective, this understanding of lived expe-\nrience was \"an absolute prerequisite for the articulation of\nDeposing Typologies\nBy emphasizing the intersubjective nature of social life and\nthe importance of investigating lived experience, typolo-\ngies--rigidly applied--become problematic. While, as\nJackson (1998) asserts, any individual \"universalizes and\nobjectifies his or her epoch . . . the singular I cannot be\nreduced to this otherness\"; through lived experience, an indi-\nvidual subjects \"objective\" forms--such as class, gender,\nrace, and history--to her \"will\" (p. 8). Furthermore, \"though\nindividuals speak, act, and work toward belonging in a world\nof others, they simultaneously strive to experience them-\nselves as world makers\" (Jackson, 1998, p. 8). This kind of\nexplanation of the experience of \"existence\" raises the ques-\ntion of how, as social scientists, we use typologies.\nIn Tricks of the Trade, one of Becker's (1998) \"tricks\" is\nto turn \"types\" of people into \"activities\" (p. 44). Jackson\n(1998), like Becker, argues that in many ways, reducing indi-\nviduals to objective categories devalues them as human\nbeings. By imposing rigid typologies on persons we observe\nand study, we run the risk of devaluing them and rendering\ntheir lived experiences insignificant. Munson (2007) brings\nthis insight into the study of lived religion by suggesting that\nresearchers pay attention to the \"polysemy\" of social life to\nnotice that \"religious beliefs, rituals, experiences, and expec-\ntations overlap other domains of life. But why is this impor-\ntant?\" (p. 127). He argues that \"the polysemy of social\nsituations . . . is a key concept in understanding social\nchange\" (p. 128). Viewing social action in this way chal-\nlenges rigid understandings of \"types.\"\nSeating Lived Experience: Lived Religion and\nIntersubjectivity\nEmphasizing lived experience as analytically important\nmeans that we gain a better understanding of how religious\npractitioners live their faiths and consequently, also gain a\nfuller knowledge of religion in society. First, what consti-\ntutes \"religious experience\"? Nelson (1997) asserts that reli-\ngion \"is a way of experiencing the world\" (p. 5). Religious\nexperiences are, first, those experiences described as reli-\ngious by people who live them (Nelson, 1997, p. 7). Nelson\n(1997) argues further that all experiences, \"no matter how\nordinary or mundane,\" can be considered religious experi-\nences if the practitioner describes them as such (p. 8).\nCallahan (2008) likewise points out that the significance of\neveryday life is frequently dismissed in studying religion for\nthe very fact that it is \"mundane\"; this dismissal is based on\ndualistic thinking which places lived experience in the realm\nof the \"profane\" while that which is considered extraordi-\nnary--or religious--is purely \"sacred\" (p. 9). However, reli-\ngion is lived through daily experiences and by focusing on\nthese experiences, scholars necessarily depose dualities and\ntypologies. Moving away from dualities and rigid applica-\ntions of religious types involves intersubjective processes\nand expands understandings of the workings of religions.\nBecause individuals construct faith through interactions\nwith religious histories and with religious others (Bender &\nCadge, 2006), intersubjectivity becomes a significant com-\nponent to understanding lived religion. Alcoff (2000) points\nout that lived experience and intersubjectivity go hand-in-\nhand. Furthermore, because we always exist in the world\nrather than separate from the world, \"lived experience is\nopen-ended, plural, fragmented, and shifting not because of\nthe limitations of language, but because of the nature of\nembodied, temporal existence\" (p. 49).\nThis assertion does not mean that history and culture are\nignored; rather, they are a part of the inhabited world which\nis lived through embodiment and the inseparability of reason\nand experience. Furthermore, structure is revealed, \"Neither\nin the hidden recesses of the psyche nor in the transpersonal\nfield of history and culture, but in the forms of encounter,\ninteraction, exchange, and dialogue of everyday life\"\nIt is in this way that Alcoff (2000)--drawing on Merleau-\nPonty's work--brings theory and discourse closer to lived\nexperience. Experience can therefore be treated as worthy of\nanalysis because by erasing the mind\u00adbody dualism, we also\naccept that understanding subjective realities and experi-\nences is as analytically significant as \"objective\" categoriza-\ntion.1 Intersubjectivity--the notion that what is significant\nabout social life is that it is only made meaningful through\nthe mutual, embodied experiences of the world2--is central\nto the study of lived experience, and therefore lived religion\nbecause, to go back to Nelson (1997), religion is more than a\nset of doctrines and institutions; it is a way of experiencing\nthe world.\nRobert Orsi (2003) points out that intersubjectivity is cen-\ntral to the study of lived religion on two levels: \"First, it rec-\nognizes the intersubjective nature of individual, social,\ncultural, and religious identities and indeed of reality itself\"\n(p. 174). This means that to understand how faith is lived by\ncontemporary persons and how the resources of faith com-\nmunities are brought closer to lived experience, a project\nmustbesituatedwithinthecorridorsofdailylife(Ammerman,\nSimilarly applied to lived class, Fantasia (1988) points out\nthat within a capitalist system, the overall structure is set up\nin such a way as to discourage workers from organizing.\nTherefore,\nTo understand the dynamics of worker mobilization and\ncollective action, it is necessary to peer into the interstices of the\nroutinized collective bargaining system, where, in order to\nrealize their collective power against a wall of opposition,\nworkers are often forced to act independently of that system.\nThis first level of intersubjectivity points to the impor-\ntance of investigating lived experience whether studying\nreligion, labor activism, or some combination of the two.\nA second way intersubjectivity is central to studies of\nlived religion and lived class is by recognizing \"the intersub-\nLikewise, Jackson (1998) argues, \"Some part of the ethnog-\nrapher's own life experience always forms the basis for\napproaching the other, just as the other must see something\nof himself or herself in the ethnographer's actions, reactions,\nand comportment\" (p. 109); there is never \"complete over-\nlap\" but there has to \"be some recognition of common iden-\ntity if any kind of interaction--self-interested or\notherwise--is to proceed\" (p. 109).\nMethod\nmonthly meetings of the general membership of IWJ-GKC\nand meetings of the governing board and action committees,\nalong with fundraising events, rallies, religious services at\nmembers' congregations, and group retreats. On these occa-\nsions, I kept detailed notes in the moment as circumstances\nallowed. At other times, such as during rallies or pickets\nwhen my physical presence was centered in the experience, I\nvoice recorded reflections immediately following the events\nand wrote field notes later.\nI conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with\nactive members, had numerous conversations while in the\nfield, and had several telephone and email discussions. By\nthe end of the study, I was able to interview 10 core members\nin depth. I used a non-rigid set of open interview questions to\nget at core concepts and ideas, particularly related to the\nmeanings of faith in everyday experience. During the inter-\nviews, respondents told life and faith history narratives in the\nways they understood them. I used my interview schedule to\nprompt interviewees to reflect on specific topics throughout\nour conversations. The interviews were digitally recorded\nand transcribed word-for-word. Furthermore, my fieldwork\nand interviews were supplemented with national and local\nnews media resources to fill in and elaborate contextual\ndetails. Overall, I found useful source material from media\nresources from Kansas City, the state of Missouri, and\nnational sources.\nBecause I worked with a variety of data, I also used a\nvariety of techniques to make sense of the data. I used a com-\nbination of deductive and inductive coding (LeCompte &\nSchensul, 1999) to organize the data. My coding was par-\ntially deductive (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999), in that some\ncodes came from the research questions that were informed\nby the literature especially that which related to lived\n4 SAGE Open\nreligion as described above. However, other codes were\nformed inductively, in that I looked for items, patterns, and\nstructures in the data (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999). Finally,\nthroughout the coding process, following the advice of\nLeCompte and Schensul (1999), I constantly referred back to\nthe research questions and the working outline of my project\nto \"check\" that the coding process was not proceeding\ncircuitously.\nRecognizing that my overall ethnographic work with its\nfocus on lived religion relates to Orsi's initial level of inter-\nsubjectivity as described above, I move forward to expand\nupon Orsi's three-tiered, second-level of intersubjectivity. I\nfirst discuss how the intersubjective nature of research and\nreligion implicated aspects of my (past\u00adpresent) working-\nclass, (past) evangelical identity and how they surprisingly\nbecame media through which relationships formed and\nthrough which I engaged the worlds of IWJ-GKC members.\nSecond, I elaborate ways in which my lived experiences not\nonly helped in the formation of trusting relationships in the\nfield, they also fed back into IWJ-GKC members' interpreta-\ntions of their own religious realities. Recognizing the dialec-\ntical nature of relationships, I conclude by discussing how\nmy fieldwork was in dialogue with aspects of my lived real-\nity outside of the field.\nIntersubjectivity: Biography as Capital\nin the Field\nThe title of this article speaks from two past locations inter-\nsubjectively woven into my research. In the good, old evan-\ngelical tradition of giving testimony I stake out claim to a\nportion of my past implicated in researching an interfaith\ncoalition. As an evangelical, I was taught what \"real reli-\ngion\" looks like. As an academic, I have been seeking to\nunderstand what religion looks like in everyday life in the\ncontext of the United States. The two are not incompatible.\nRespecting people of faith also comes from my upbring-\ning. It was this respect that fostered openness to understand-\ning a complicated and complex relationship between\nreligious institutions and labor organizations throughout\nU.S. labor history. It is also a position that does not view all\nreligion as incompatible with ideals of equality and justice.\nAs a person once committed to a particular brand of faith, I\nhave always known that religion happens not only in the\nobvious places and in evident ways; rather, much of what\ncounts as faith practice to the faithful \"cannot be neatly sepa-\nrated from the other practices of everyday life, from the ways\nthat human beings work on the landscape\" (Orsi, 1997, p. 7).\nWhen I first started to engage the group by attending\nmonthly meetings, exchanging emails and phone calls, one\nof the first questions asked of me was whether I am a person\nof faith. I wanted to explain briefly my religious history\nbecause there was initially a little tension over my role as an\nacademic researcher. Growing up in a faith context meant to\nparticipants that I could at least \"get\" a portion of what they\nwere talking about. Interestingly, several people were excited\nthat as a past evangelical I had come to be interested in\nsocial justice because they were looking to extend and diver-\nsify the religious base of the organization. They thought that\nmaybe I could offer some insights into how to frame issues\nto appeal to that crowd.\nThe title of this article is derived from a second location\nbased on a proclamation of class identity through class con-\nsciousness. This class location invokes memories of picket\nlines, United Automobile Workers (UAW) banners, and\nunion halls amidst the factory-dotted landscape in Flint,\nMichigan. This is not an uncomplicated identity. Because I\nhave completed a PhD, I recognize the emergent difficulty of\nany longer locating myself within the working class. But, as\ncultural studies scholar Andy Medhurst (2000) notes, \"My\nown class history is central to my understanding of how cul-\nture works, and it would be disingenuous to pretend other-\nwise\" (p. 21). Reflections on the sometimes thorny paths\ntraveled by working-class kids transitioning into the aca-\ndemic world are not new (e.g., Mahony & Zmroczek, 1997;\nclass and class-ist dialogues within the university setting\nsuggests the need for further reflections on the ways class-\noriented assumptions are made within the very structure of\nacademic departments. Class is just as much about cultural\npractices, performances, languages, and ideologies as it is\nabout occupation and materiality. Personal accounts of expe-\nriencing an in-between class identity do not always attest to\nthe liberatory quality of fluidity and multiplicity.As Medhurst\n(2000) points out, \"Those triumphalist celebrations of fluid-\nity always overlook the fact that being unfixed, mobile, in-\nbetween, can distress as much as it liberates. So my sense of\nclass identity is uncertain, torn and oscillating--caught on a\ncultural cusp\" (p. 20).\nBefore doing fieldwork, I knew that there was something\na little more difficult about my trek through the academy in\ncomparison with some of my colleagues. As such, I was not\nnaive about my class location; rather, it did not bubble to the\nsurface until my conversations in the field with working-\nclass women and men disentangled the piece of my identity I\nhad been hammering away at for several years through what\nwe call \"professional socialization.\" In the field, that occa-\nsional roadblock to academic success has become a form of\ncurrency. Working-class culture is rarely viewed as cultural\ncapital. Its exchange value is devalued next to the pieces of\nculture held and cultivated by the rapidly shrinking middle-\nto-upper middle class in the United States. For the first time,\nit did not count against me that my dad worked for General\nMotors (GM) or that my mom moved in and out of jobs for\nmost of my life. No longer just \"the university student here\nto study us,\" I came to be seen as an active, supporting mem-\nber of an interfaith and labor coalition fighting for worker\njustice.\nWhat came as a greater surprise was how class came to be\nthe most important role played in becoming accepted as\nmore of an insider. For about 6 months, I attended meetings\nand events. In the fall of 2006, a fundraiser was held for one\nof IWJ-GKC's primary programs \"Building Bridges.\" This is\na training program for low-income, minority women and\nmen to gain the necessary skills to be able to pass the initial\nexams required for entering the building and trades profes-\nsions. I sat at a table with seven active members of the group\nand over dinner, they began to ask me about my life: where I\ngrew up, what my parents did, and so on. When I started to\ntalk about Flint, one of the women said, \"Well, then. You do\nget it! You know what we're talking about.\"\nOnce my class location was \"exposed,\" people began to\ntalk to me differently. They shared their stories more openly.\nThey came to care about me as one of their own. My iden-\ntity--person of faith/working class--is what made the proj-\nect make sense. It explained why I was there. Being able to\nplace me comfortably within a narrative construction of how\nI came to be interested in labor and religion, my presence at\nevents and meetings became more \"natural.\" I was later\nasked to tell my story to new members of the group who\nentered about 1 year later, so that they too could understand\nwhy I was there. For once, growing up in Flint, Michigan,\ndid not count against me.\nIntersubjectivity: The Interview\nContext and the Co-Construction of\nReligious Realities\nI secondly describe a way in which a lived experience in the\npreliminary stages of my research influenced how two mem-\nbers of IWJ-GKC interpreted their roles as religious persons\nin the fight for worker justice. If, as researchers, we recog-\nnize that interviews are \"reality-constructing, meaning-\nmaking occasions\" (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995, p. 4), it is\nalso important to point out that the meanings constructed\nwithin the context of interviews can also become available in\nother life-contexts. In keeping with my position that institu-\ntional boundaries are fluid, some interview contexts become\nlocations in which respondents can work out interpretations\nand meanings of their own social actions and subsequently\nutilize these meanings in other contexts. In the interview,\nreligious and other realities can be co-constructed because of\nthe intersubjective nature of social life.\nBefore discovering IWJ-GKC, I conducted an exploratory\ninterview in St. Louis, Missouri, with an Episcopal minister\nactive in the coalition Jobs with Justice. She characterized\nher work in the labor movement as moving beyond mercy\nand service work and moving into activism. Mercy work is\nwhat she said most clergy and lay people are comfortable\ndoing: collecting food for the food pantry, visiting the sick\nand the elderly, working in a soup kitchen. She said, \"Sure\nthis work is important, but God calls us to enact justice in this\nworld and therefore activism must be a part of our faith.\"\nAfter having spent several months with IWJ-GKC, I\nstarted to schedule interviews. In those interviews, I used the\nminister's story to elicit reflections from IWJ-GKC members\non how they characterize their justice work. Interestingly,\nthis minister's story had an influence on two of my respon-\ndents'conceptions of their justice work.Acouple weeks after\nthe interview in which I used this story, the phrase--from\nmercy to activism--surfaced at a monthly meeting of the\ngeneral membership during the opening \"reflection\" con-\nducted by a woman I had just interviewed. She intermingled\nthis characterization of their justice work with a call to action\non increasing the minimum wage in the state of Missouri. I\nhad not previously heard this characterization used in the\ncontext of an IWJ-GKC meeting.\nEarlier in the summer of 2007, I interviewed a retired\nUnited Methodist minister who also described her work with\nthe labor movement as beyond mercy work. She illustrated\nthis point with a story from the life of Moses. She told me the\nfact that Pharaoh's daughter lifted Moses from the river was\nan act of mercy. But what we are called to do is to go up that\nriver, see what is happening there that made the situation so\nbad that Moses was put in the river in the first place and stop\nit from happening. That is justice. The Reverend had clearly\nalready been thinking about her work as moving from mercy\nto activism, but once discussed openly in the interview, she\nalso came to use the phrase during moments of reflection at\nmonthly meetings. In the interview context, when asked to\nreflect on the meanings of justice work and service, she\npointed out that highlighting distinctions between the two\nforms of action is a powerful way to describe the work and\nfaith-orientations of IWJ-GKC members.\nRather than looking at these moments as contaminating\nthe research context, I am more aware of the intersubjective\nnature of doing fieldwork and interviews. I have viewed this\nphrase as a useful analytical tool. Members of IWJ-GKC saw\nit as a catchy phase to understand the work they are daily\ncarrying out in their communities. Transferred from one con-\ntext to another, this experience further attests to the permea-\nbility of institutional boundaries. As Munson (2007) argues,\nwhen we think about agency we need to see that it \"can be\nlocated in the spaces where multiple meanings overlap\"\nIntersubjectivity: The Lived Reality of\nthe Researcher\nA third way intersubjectivity has been enacted through this\nproject is in the dialogue with my own life, influenced by the\nintersubjective experience of doing fieldwork. In some ways,\nmy past has been resurrected through my engagement with\nmembers of IWJ-GKC. The implication of the resurrection\nstory is not that the same old thing has risen again, but that\nsomething new is born out of the old. First, I finally got to\nput to rest the evangelical \"demons.\" I have been able to rec-\nognize the positive aspects of my faith upbringing and to\ndivorce them from the negative carryovers best illustrated by\nthose typical stories of oppression of women and sexuality\n6 SAGE Open\nalong with the ever-present fear of hell. I had to exorcise this\ndemon because it bore direct implications on my fieldwork.\nIn the church where I grew up, on a typical Sunday morn-\ning, testimonies from members of the congregation would\nfollow rounds of choruses and hymns. We might hold hands\nduring songs or prayer, expressing a sense of unity. McGuire\n(2008), drawing onAlfred Schutz's metaphor \"making music\ntogether,\" points out how in song, people have an intersub-\njective experience that produces \"an experiential sense of\ntogetherness\" (p. 112). These moments, while meaningful\nand even beautiful, were called to mind in a way that led me\nto resist engagement in some aspects of my fieldwork, early\non. When IWJ-GKC members held hands or sang songs\ntogether--especially the same songs I sang as a youth--I\nresisted full engagement. Because I wanted to be \"present\"\nin my fieldwork in a way that I could hopefully come to\ngrasp the lived experience of interfaith labor activism, I\nsought to quickly resolve my old hang-ups. Ruth Frankenberg\nEthnography immerses one in the subject--the line between\nacademy and religion/spirituality, between the rational and\nirrational, believer and skeptic becomes blurred, so that\naccounting for one's place in the field--reflexivity--helps to\n\"undo\" some of the compartmentalization. (pp. 14-15)\nThe intersubjective experiences of religious expression in\nthe field helped me to gain a new understanding of my per-\nsonal faith and further convinced me of the necessity to\nunderstand religion as lived experience. Reflecting on years\nof studying Buddhism, Liberman (2001) asks whether it is\nproblematic for the academic to become transformed by\npractices observed in the field. He responds by asserting that\nto be a dispassionate observer is to run the risk of missing\nimportant religious practices and failing as an ethnographer.\nMost interesting to me now, however, is the weight of class\non my conscious mind and how this intermingles with reflec-\ntions on my upbringing and my relationship with my parents.\nBecause of this project, I have resurrected several memories\nand I have come to appreciate my parents more. During my\nfieldwork, I found myself talking more about my parents than\nI had in a long while. The fact that my class and religious\nbackgrounds served as cultural capital meant that members of\nIWJ-GKC asked about my family often. They were curious\nabout my experience growing up in Flint and consequently,\nmy parents' experiences working in Flint. As I listened to\nmembers' stories in the field and recorded their narratives in\nthe interview context, though my parents were states away,\nthey were virtually present with me through these intersubjec-\ntive experiences in the field. Jackson (1998) argues, \"The life\nstories that individuals bring to a relationship are metamor-\nphosed in the course of that relationship. They are thus in a\nvery real sense, authored not by autonomous subjects but by\nthe dynamics of intersubjectivity . . . \" (p. 23).\nI did not spend a lot of time thinking deeply about Flint's\neconomic circumstances while growing up, but even a young\nperson tunes into the discourses of strikes, layoffs, forced\nretirements, and those late-night talks of how the parents\nwere going to make the next mortgage payment. When I was\nin elementary school, one of our class field trips was to the\nGM Truck and Bus plant where my dad worked. Looking\nback I ask why a \"career-day\" field trip took us to that fac-\ntory instead of one of the two major hospitals in town. Later,\nI read in Rivethead (Hamper, 1991)--a novel/autobiography\nby former GM employee Ben Hamper about working at a\nChevy plant--that executives at GM saw these field trips for\nthe kids of workers as an act of goodwill toward the\ncommunity.\nStill, somewhat startled by the roar of machinery when we\nwalked through those doors, I was proud to see my dad wait-\ning to give me a hug and hand me a pair of earplugs. Before\ngoing there, I figured it just made sense my dad would wear\nearplugs to work. He was a quiet man. I assumed that he did\nnot feel like listening to or talking to his co-workers. I did not\nknow until then his everyday world--from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m.--\nwas cluttered by such peace-shattering noise. The smell of\nhot oil, sweat, and grime; rough hands; and dirty fingernails\nwere my dad's \"signature.\" Only there for an hour or so, we\nkids walked out smelling like our parents and happy to\nbreathe the fresh air. Looking back now, I can recall how I\nknew my dad differently then. Even as a child, something\nchanges when you realize your dad goes to \"the hole\" every-\nday just to keep you alive.\nIn June, 2008, my dad passed away. At his funeral, my\nbrother--an evangelical minister--told his story about going\nto the factory on a school field trip. He was similarly greeted\nby my dad. One of my dad's co-workers reached over and,\njostling my brother's shoulder a bit, asked, \"Are you gonna\nwork here too just like your dad?\" Before John could speak\nup, my dad said, \"No. He's going to college.\" At the funeral,\nJohn also read a note from my dad that was written on the\nday my brother left home to be married. In the letter, my dad\napologized for never being a talkative or intellectual man:\n\"Your mother is much better with things like that,\" he wrote.\nThough I remember my childhood as being infused with\nmy dad's love and his presence, he said that he wished he\ncould have been around more, but that working in the factory\novertime meant we would not have to do the same thing\nwhen we grew up. Though quiet and perhaps not an intel-\nlectual, he worked his whole adult life in a place he never\nwanted his kids to have to set foot inside. But we did see the\ninside, thanks to the outreach programs of GM. Today I am\nthankful for that memory as I was on the morning I last\nhugged him and told him I would be back to see him in\nAugust. He said, \"Ok babe. I love you\" and I heard from my\nsister the following morning at 4 a.m. that he had passed\naway.\nDiscussion\nThinking seriously about the intersubjective nature of ethno-\ngraphic work calls into question both the dualism and the\ntypologizing that has permeated not only Western philoso-\nphy, but Western social science as well. Dualistic thinking\npits the objective against the subjective, glorifying the for-\nmer as the primary means through which to engage science.\nHowever, Jackson (1998) points out that the two do not in\nlived reality exist in opposition; rather, they are dialectically\nrelated. Furthermore, returning to the foundational ideal that\ntypologies were not meant to be rigidly applied, typologies\ninstead are tools for thinking, always meant to be placed\nwithin the context and enriched by experience (Ostrow,\n1990). Setting forth these challenges frees the researcher to\npositively view and value areas of intersubjectivity in the\nprocesses and relationships developed in the course of\nresearching human beings whose lived realities are consti-\ntuted through intersubjective processes (Alcoff, 2000;\nFirst, the ethnographer's biography can serve as cultural\ncapital in the field. I have described one aspect of my biogra-\nphy that intersected with my research participants' and\nanother aspect that posed a potential challenge to partici-\npants' understandings of religious types, but one which they\nturned into a useable resource. My class location growing up\nindicated I understood the struggles for working-class social\njustice, which allowed me to become a cared-for member of\nthe IWJ-GKC community. This aspect of intersubjectivity\nnecessarily intersects with the third level of intersubjectivity\nin which the life of the researcher can change. As indicated\nabove, my class location finally became something I did not\nhave to struggle against or hide. Furthermore, the research\nparticipants saw that aspect of my biography enmeshed in\nevangelicalism to be a resource asking questions about how\nto frame workers' rights issues in such a way as to resonate\nwith the evangelical religious worldview. In this, a further\nintersecting reality of intersubjectivity rises to the surface in\nthe process of the co-construction of lived reality. Just as the\ninterview context begs reflection on its meaning-making\nquality (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995), researchers' biogra-\nphies also trickle into the second level of intersubjectivity.\nOur understandings of the workings of human social life are\ndeepened when this aspect is treated as an important--even\nobservable--part of the research process.\nFinally, the intersubjective experiences in the field made\npoignant my (past) evangelical identity and my (past\u00ad\npresent) class identity and thereby made my parents--espe-\ncially my dad--virtually present for me on a day-to-day\nbasis through the stories I shared about him with people in\nthe field. Jackson (1998) points out that when people tell sto-\nries at funerals about those passed, those stories are often\ntold not to \"preserve an exact record,\" but to \"remaster expe-\nrience\" (p. 24). The effect on meaning is such that human\nbeings also experience--intersubjectively--the stories they\nconstruct. He asserts that it matters little whether the stories\nare exact records of life experiences because, \"It is, there-\nfore, not what they apparently do that wholly defines their\nhumanity--or would suffice as a scientific description of\ntheir nature--but what they virtually experience in the course\nof their actual lives\" (p. 25). The stories I told in the field\nsomehow prepared me for my dad's death. Not in such a way\nthat they eased my distress; rather, in that by cultivating his\nvirtual presence through the intersubjective experience of\ntelling stories about him in the field, his virtual presence can\nstill remain as a comfort to me. Jackson (1998) strikingly\nargues, \"That we exist solely in relation to others is dramati-\ncally borne out by studies of human responses to loss\" (p.\n75); when a significant other passes away, we \"in reality\n[experience] a rupture in intersubjective life\" (p. 76).\nConclusion\nIn this article, I have argued that to more fully understand\nlived experience and therefore lived religion and lived class,\nethnographers must challenge dualistic thinking and explore\nthe possible limitations of the rigid applications of typolo-\ngies. Doing so means that one engages with processual think-\ning and is invited to consider how the researcher, the\nresearched, and the research process are engaged intersub-\njectively, enlivening not only the ethnography, but poten-\ntially the ethnographer as well.\nThis processual thinking led to the discovery of three lev-\nels of intersubjectivity (Orsi, 2003) interwoven into my\nfieldwork experience with an interfaith and labor coalition in\nKansas City, Missouri. First, the biographies of researchers\nhave the potential to serve as cultural capital in ethnographic\nfieldwork. Second, sometimes the stories we tell in the field\ncome to be incorporated into the everyday narratives of our\nresearch participants. Third, the subjective life of the\nresearcher can be changed in unexpected ways through the\nintersubjective nature of the lived experience of doing field-\nwork. Rather than viewing these intersubjective processes as\nresearch \"contaminants,\" they were discussed as aspects of a\nco-constructed, lived reality: The recognition of which places\na more human face on our ethnographies and brings under-\nstandings gleaned from research closer to the lived experi-\nences discovered in the field.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. I use \"objective\"--emphasizing the quotation marks--to indi-\ncate that objective categories are intersubjectively constituted.\nOstrow (1990) suggests this intersubjective constitution means\nthat we can \"escape from the division between `subjective'and\n8 SAGE Open\n`objective'orders of existence that has dominated Western phi-\nlosophy\" (p. 3). Similarly, Jackson (1998) emphasizes that the\ntwo are always dialectically related.\n2. The notion of embodied experiences as central to intersub-\njectivity comes from the work of Merleau-Ponty (1962), who\nunlike Husserl (e.g., Crossley, 1996) and Schutz (e.g., Ostrow,\n1990) did not separate reason/mind (consciousness) from\nbody/subject (perception); consciousness and perception form\na \"gestalt structure,\" which means \"that all meanings and ideas\nmust be embodied (e.g. in words, gestures, artefacts, rituals,\nReferences\nAlcoff, L.
