The\ncapitellum of the immature elbow has a tenuous vascu-\nlar supply consisting of one or two posterior vessels.\nThere is no metaphyseal blood supply until the physis\ncloses.1,2 This makes the capitellum vulnerable to\nrepetitive microtrauma in overhead athletes.\nDuring overhead sports, such as baseball, gymnas-\ntics, volleyball, javelin throwing and tennis, tremendous\nvalgus forces are generated across the elbow joint.3,4\nThese valgus forces result in attenuation on the\nmedial side and compression of the lateral side.\nThese compression forces can lead to injury of the\npoorly vascularized growth plate of the capitellum.5\u00ad9\nThis is why OCD most commonly occurs in the adoles-\ncent age.\nThe onset of symptoms is insidious and many ath-\nletes will initially only complain of inexplicit lateral-\n1Upper Limb Unit, Amphia Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands\n2Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n3Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, The Netherlands\n4Shoulder and Elbow Unit, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands\n5Shoulder and Elbow Unit, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The\nNetherlands\nCorresponding author:\nKimberly I.

As signs and symptoms are vague\nprimarily, obtaining the definite diagnosis in these\nyoung athletes is delayed for months or even years.\nSymptoms average 1\u00ad2 years before an appropriate\ntreatment takes place.8\nTreatment is conservative or operative, depending\non type, stage and stability of the lesion.9,10 Early rec-\nognition and appropriate intervention may protect\nthem from fragmentation of the OCD lesion and\ndeveloping irreversible cartilage damage.7,8\nImaging usually starts with standard anteroposterior\n(AP) and lateral plain radiographs; however, plain\nradiographs lack sensitivity, which is approximately\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed\ntomography (CT) scans are probably more sensitive.\nThere are some reports on the sensitivity and specificity\nof MRI versus X-rays. Satake et al.12 found a MRI\nity and 80% specificity for diagnosing OCD on MRI.\nJans et al.14 reported a sensitivity of 100% on MRI,\nonly when using all kinds of characteristics of an\nunstable elbow OCD lesion together. None of the char-\nacteristics was sensitive by itself. No data exist on the\ncomparison of all three imaging techniques: standard\nX-ray, MRI and CT scans.\nIt is important to classify the lesion to determine\nwhether it is stable or unstable. This will determine the\ntype of treatment and is closely related to the prognosis.\nA stable lesion will most likely heal naturally with rest of\nthe elbow but, when a lesion has become unstable, sur-\ngery provides significantly better results.8,9,12\nThe aim of the present study was to determine which\nradiological technique is preferred for the identification\nof OCD of the young elbow joint and to classify the\nOCD lesion.\nMaterials and methods\nWe retrospectively identified patients who underwent\narthroscopy of the elbow because of a symptomatic\narthroscopies were performed by a single orthopedic\nsurgeon (DE). Most patients were referred to us from\nother hospitals, whereas others came directly to our\nclinic. Therefore, patients had variable imaging modal-\nities performed. Most patients had a pre-operative\nX-ray and MRI or a pre-operative X-ray and a CT\nscan. Some of these patients had undergone all three\nimaging modalities, mostly because they had been seen\nby several different doctors. We included just this last\ngroup of patients, who had pre-operative radiographs,\nMRI and a CT scan available, aiming to achieve a\ndirect comparison of the imaging studies within one\npatient (Figures 1 to 3). Therefore, all patients missing\none or more of these pre-operative imaging modalities\nwere excluded.\nAll three imaging studies were reviewed by two\nexperienced elbow and sports orthopedic surgeons\n(DE and MvdB). Both assessed independently whether\nor not the osteochondral lesion could be identified\nusing the various imaging modalities. Any discrepan-\ncies were resolved by a consensus discussion.\nAll lesions were classified according to the classi-\nfications of Minami et al.,15 Clanton and DeLee,16\nand Itsubo et al.13 for X-ray, CT and MRI, respect-\nively (Table 1). There is no verified classification of\nOCD of the elbow for CT images; therefore we used\nthe classification of Clanton and DeLee16 for osteo-\nchondritis dissecans of the knee. This is a well-\nknown and validated classification system for OCD\nThe location of the OCD lesion was described in the\nsagittal and coronal plane. The sagittal plane of the\nFigure 1.

The coronal plane of the\ncapitellum was also equally divided into three parts:\nlateral, central and medial.\nA stable lesion was determined by the following clas-\nsifications: Minami grade I, Itsubo stages 1 and 2, and\nClanton and DeLee stages 1 and 2. An unstable lesion\nwas in its turn classified by Minami grades II and III,\nFigure 2. Magnetic resonance images of an elbow affected with osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum.

All\nlesions were defined as stable or unstable intra-\noperatively.\nPatient records provided information on patients'\nsex, age at the time of surgery, hand dominance, ath-\nletic activity, and time between onset of symptoms and\ndiagnosis.\nResults\nPatient demographics\nOf the 106 patients who underwent arthroscopy of the\nelbow because of symptomatic OCD of the capitellum,\n25 patients had pre-operative radiographs as well as a\nCT scan and MRI available. The average age was 17\nyears, ranging from 12 years to 23 years. Thirteen\npatients were male and 12 were female. In 18 patients,\nthe right elbow was affected and, in seven patients, the\nleft elbow was affected. This was the dominant arm in\n17 patients. All patients participated in at least one\nsport. Half of them were either gymnasts or tennis\nplayers (Table 2). The median period between onset\nof symptoms and diagnosis was 24 months, ranging\nfrom 1 month to 192 months. Patients all complained\nof vague lateral elbow pain with loading of the elbow\nthat worsened with activity. Some also showed loss of\nmotion or locking symptoms. Six of the 25 patients\nreported an acute trauma to their elbow.\nPre-operative imaging\nThe OCD lesion was visible on X-ray in 19 of the 25\nelbows. It was seen on nine X-rays only on the AP\nradiograph and, on 10 X-rays, the lesion was seen on\nboth AP and lateral views. Grading of all OCD lesions\nis presented in Table 3. The radiographic grading did\nnot correspond to either the MRI or CT grading.\nOne lesion that was not observed on X-ray was also\nnot seen on MRI. The other lesions were all visible on\nMRI. All lesions were diagnosed on CT. The sagittal\nviews appeared to be most sensitive; the OCD lesion\nThe coronal views showed the lesion in 21 of 25 MRIs\nTable 1.

Unfortunately, there is\nstill a serious delay in diagnosis and treatment. It\nis noteworthy that the average age of our patients\nis fairly high at 17 years, ranging up to 23 years, as a\nresult of a missed or delayed diagnosis. One patient\nwas, in fact, symptomatic for 16 years.\nEarly recognition and appropriate intervention may\nprotect adolescents from fragmentation of the OCD\nlesion and developing irreversible cartilage damage.\nTreatment depends on type, stage and stability of the\nlesion. In the present study, CT of the elbow is the best\nradiological technique for identifying and classifying\ncapitellar OCD.\nSatake et al.12 also compared radiographs, CT scans\nand MRIs with intra-operative findings, although their\npatients did not all have CT and MRI studies for a\ndirect comparison. It was found that pre-operative\nradiographs correlated with an intra-operative diagno-\nsis of unstable lesions in 44% of cases when using the\nTable 3.

The\nnumber of lesions (and their percentage) is stated in the parts\nwhere they were localized according to the CT scan.\nE Shoulder & Elbow 0(0)\nMinami classification. When specifically looking at\nclosure of the capitellar epiphyseal line on X-ray, a sen-\nsitivity of 88% of detecting was found for an unstable\nlesion. Articular irregularity and T2 high signal inten-\nsity interface on MRI correlated with the intra-opera-\ntive finding of whether the lesion was stable or unstable,\nJans et al.14 looked at specific findings of an unstable\nOCD lesion of the elbow on MRI: high T2 signal inten-\nsity rim, cysts, high T2 signal intensity fracture line\nextending through the articular cartilage overlying an\nOCD lesion, and a fluid-filled OCD. A sensitivity of\n100% was reported when using all criteria together.\nNone of these criteria was sensitive by itself.14\nTo our knowledge, there are no studies describing the\nsensitivity of CT in OCD of the elbow. One reason for\nthis could be that, in clinical practice, CT scans might not\nbe used as much as MRI for detecting OCD lesions.\nHowever, CT can accurately identify and localize a\nlesion at the same time as defining its extent.\nFurthermore, CT had the advantage of a wider availabil-\nity and a shorter acquisition time compared to MRI.18\nOf course, hazards of radiation exposure must\nalways be weighed against their clinical utility when\nordering imaging studies, especially when delivered to\na largely skeletally immature population. Nevertheless,\nit is good to keep in mind that the effective dose for a CT\nscan of the elbow is only 0.14 mSv. In comparison, the\neffective doses of CT scans of the shoulder and thoracic\nbackground dose as a result of natural radiation expos-\nure is approximately 3 mSv per person per year.19\nIn the present study, localization of the OCD lesion\nwas determined by CT. It is our opinion that defining\nlocalization of the lesion during surgery is not suffiently\naccurate and reliable. It also shows a great discrepancy\ncompared to a CT scan. Kimball et al.2 showed a pre-\ndominant posterior blood supply to the distal lateral\nhumerus and a relative watershed area on the medial\nside. This is not coherent with the localizations of the\nlesions in the present study. Therefore, this probably is\nnot the only issue concerning the development of capi-\ntellar OCD.\nThe strengths of the present study include the rela-\ntive large group of patients who all had pre-operative\nX-ray as well as MRI and CT scans of their elbow. To\nour knowledge, this is the first study comparing all\nthree pre-operative imaging techniques with the surgi-\ncal findings of OCD of the humeral capitellum. In the\npresent study, well known, validated, classification sys-\nWe acknowledge limitations to the present study.\nFirst, it is a retrospective study in which all patients\nhad already undergone surgery for symptomatic OCD\nof the elbow. We did not include a control group of\npatients without OCD when assessing radiographs,\nMRI and CT scans. Nevertheless, it shows how many\nOCD lesions are missed on standard radiographs.\nSecond, the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility\nof the findings of the three imaging techniques was not\nassessed. Both orthopedic surgeons reviewed all images\nindependently. However, any discrepancies were\nresolved by a consensus discussion. When looking at\ngrading the OCD lesions, Claessen et al.20 demonstrate\nthat the inter-observer reliability of the currently used\nclassification systems for OCD of the humeral capitel-\nlum is poor to fair. The Minami classification was sig-\nnificantly the most reliable when classifying the\ndifferent stages of OCD of the humeral capitellum,\nalthough still with only fair agreement.20\nThird, Takahara et al.8 suggest using an anterior\nimage of the elbow in 45 flexion because OCD lesions\nmay be underdiagnosed on the basis of AP radiographs\nof the elbow in extension. In the present study, none of\nthe patients had AP radiographs taken in 45 of elbow\nflexion. Changing that protocol might improve the sen-\nsitivity of radiographic imaging of OCD. Fourth, the\nquality of the MRI was variable. Referring hospitals do\nnot all use the same resolution power. Next to that, our\npatients are younger and more active, which might have\nresulted in more body movement. This has a greater\neffect on MRIs than on CT.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, based on the findings in the present\nstudy, it appears that a CT of the elbow is the best\nimaging technique for confirming the diagnosis of\nOCD, especially in the unstable stage. An OCD lesion\nof the capitellum is not always visible on X-ray and\nloose bodies are often missed on standard X-rays and\nby MRI.\nA young patient with lateral elbow pain has OCD\nuntil proven otherwise. To prevent delay in diagnosis,\nwe strongly recommend additional imaging studies,\npreferably CT.\n"
