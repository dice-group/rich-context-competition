Hayward,2 and Yasuhiko Saito3\n'Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California.\nPopulation Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University.\n'Center for Information Networking, Nihon University, Japan.\nThis study clarifies the process by which mortality and disability interact to determine differences in active life\nexpectancy by age, sex, race, and education for the U.S. population 70 years of age and over. The analysis is\nperformed using datafrom the Longitudinal Study of Aging and multistate life tables constructed using the results of\nhazard models. Women spend more years than men both active and inactive at every age; however, the proportion of\nlife that is expected to be active is smaller for women. These differences are largely due to mortality differences\nfavoring women. Persons with less than a high school education have shorter total and active life expectancies but\nsimilar expected lengths of inactive life compared to those with more than a high school education. There are no sig-\nnificant race differences in total life expectancy for race-education groups of the older population; but Blacks have\nlower expected active life than non-Blacks because of worse functioning.\nTHE fact that elderly Americans differ greatly in their life\nchances is well established. Women live longer than\nmen (Verbrugge, 1989). Persons of higher socioeconomic\nstatus live longer than those less fortunate (Rogot, Sorlie,\nand Johnson, 1992). And, Whites generally live longer than\nBlacks. Increasing evidence shows parallel diversity in the\nhealth and disability status of elderly Americans. Women,\nBlacks, and those who are poor and less educated are more\nlikely to have worse health and functioning.\nWhat is less clear is how mortality and disability experi-\nences interact over the life cycle to determine differences in\nactive life expectancy in the population. Active life expect-\nancy defines the period of life individuals can expect to live\nwithout chronic disability. The present study examines how\ndisability, recovery, and mortality interact to determine\nactive life expectancy across sex, race, and education sub-\ngroups of the older population. A multivariate, multistate\nlife-table modeling approach is used to estimate active life\nexpectancy for the major population subgroups. A key\nadvantage of this approach over more traditional life-table\nmodels is that we gain some leverage on differentiating the\nbiological sources of active life expectancy from socially\nstructured causes. This complements prior research docu-\nmenting the sex and socioeconomic status gradients of mor-\ntality by showing how longer (or shorter) life is accompanied\nby better (or worse) health.\nThe multivariate, multistate model is based on hazard\nmodels determining the associations between sex, race, and\neducation and the disability and mortality transitions among\npersons 70 years of age and older in the United States. The\nmodels' results for each transition are combined using a\nmultistate life-table model to derive the implications of these\nrates for total and active life expectancy and for the preva-\nlence of disability across sex, race, and education sub-\ngroups. This approach is useful, because it can document\nhow specific types of health changes affect active life expect-\nancy for a particular population subgroup. Moreover, the\nmultistate approach allows us to document how cross-\nsectional prevalence measures of disability status for a stand-\nard population are determined by transitions into and out of\nvarious health states.\nBackground\nDifferences in active life may arise because of differences\nin mortality, the onset of disability, the recovery from\ndisability, or some combination of these experiences (Crim-\nmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). Results from recent\nManton, Stallard, and Liu, 1993) suggest, for example, that\nwomen have a longer active life expectancy than men.\nHypothetically, this could be due simply to women living\nlonger than men and accumulating more years in both\ndisabled and nondisabled states as they age. It also could be\ndue to sex differences in the rate of onset of (and perhaps\nrecovery from) disability. Perhaps due to the variety of\ndefinitions of disability and samples of the older population,\nprior research is ambiguous on this point. Manton (1988)\nreports that sex is unrelated to functional change among\nelderly persons; Land, Guralnik, and Blazer (1994) report\nthat sex is not related to the onset of disability but that\nfemales are more likely to recover from disability, whereas\nRogers, Rogers, and Belanger (1992) report that males were\nmore likely to experience the occurrence of a disability.\nHow differences in rates of mortality and disability onset\nand recovery are related to the prevalence of disability also\nis unclear. One of the real paradoxes of the aging process is\nthe longer life but worse health of women. While women's\ntotal and active life expectancy are greater compared to\nmen, they also have a higher prevalence of disability and\nworse self-rated health (Verbrugge, 1989). Sex differences\nin the diseases underlying the disability process almost\nSI\ncertainly play a role in explaining this paradox. Verbrugge\n(1989) has documented a higher prevalence of fatal dis-\neases, such as heart disease, among men and a higher\nprevalence of nonfatal chronic conditions, such as arthritis,\namong women. If men suffer from diseases that are more\nlikely to kill them and women from diseases that are more\nlikely to disable them, this could result in longer life with\nmore disability for women.\nIn contrast to the association between active and total life\nexpectancy for men and women, current evidence on mortal-\nity and disability differences by education suggests that active\nlife expectancy varies by socioeconomic status in much the\nsame way as mortality. Older persons of lower socioeco-\nnomic status have been shown to have both higher mortality\nand a higher prevalence of functioning problems (Guralnik et\nfound older persons of lower socioeconomic status to have\nhigher rates of functioning decline and mortality (Rogers,\nRogers, and Belanger, 1992), but whether socioeconomic\nstatus is related to recovery is less clear (Crimmins and Saito,\nConsiderable ambiguity surrounds race differences in the\nassociation between active and total life expectancy, in part\nbecause of the inconsistency of the mortality and morbidity\nestimates. Up to the oldest ages, mortality among Whites is\nlower than that for African Americans; after age 80, the\ndifferential is less clear. Mortality rates estimated from vital\nstatistics and population data usually show that a crossover\nfrom higher Black to higher White mortality occurs at about\nby Preston and colleagues (1995), however, concludes that\nthe observed crossover results from an understatement of age\non death certificates for African Americans. When age at\ndeath is corrected, no crossover occurs and White mortality\nis lower than that for African Americans throughout the age\ncrossovers in mortality rates also have been observed in a\nvariety of longitudinally followed samples of the elderly\n(Gibson, 1994), although not all longitudinally followed\npopulations have different mortality by race or a race cross-\nover (Berkman, Singer, and Manton, 1989). Recently, re-\nsearchers using data from the Piedmont region of North\nCarolina found that above age 74, active and total life\nexpectancy for African Americans exceeded by a consider-\nable margin that of Whites (Guralnik et al., 1993).\nDifferentials in disability prevalence reported for the older\npopulation by race generally favor Whites (Clark, Maddox,\nand Steinhauser, 1993), although some evidence suggests\nthat this difference exists only below age 75 and that there is\na crossover in morbidity as well as mortality (Gibson, 1991,\n1994). When socioeconomic status is controlled, however,\nmost investigators do not find race differences in functioning\nchange or mortality (Clark, Maddox, and Steinhauser, 1993;\nalthough there are exceptions to this (Berkman, Singer, and\nResearchers interested in the health effects of social and\neconomic factors typically have examined mortality and\ndisability singly without considering how these health out-\ncomes might interact. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is\nconsiderable ambiguity in our understanding of how these\nfactors are associated with the decline in health status over\nthe life span and how they relate to expected health events in\nindividuals' lives. Active life expectancy provides a succinct\nmeasure of how individuals' lives can be apportioned into\nyears with and without disability or functioning difficulties,\nand the multivariate, multistate life table model allows us to\nexamine the source of these differences. The ability to\nidentify the independent effects of sex, race, and educational\ndifferences in active life expectancy is important because\nsuch differences reflect the underlying aging processes char-\nacteristic of subgroups in the U.S. population.\nDefinitions of States of Active and Inactive Life\nand Types of Transitions\nActive life expectancy in this analysis is life when one is\nable to perform the functions necessary for personal care and\nindependent living; inactive life is time when one is unable\nto perform these functions or would be dependent upon\nothers for their performance. Most analyses of active life\nhave divided life into only two states, one active and the\nother inactive based on the ability to perform personal care\nfunctions or activities of daily living (ADLs; Branch et al.,\n1991) redress this lack of attention to other forms of disabil-\nity by incorporating measures of ability to perform tasks\nnecessary for independent living or instrumental activities of\ndaily living (IADLs) in the evaluation of active life. Building\non this work, we differentiate inactive or disabled life\naccording to the ability to perform ADL functions and the\nability to perform IADL functions given ADL ability. In\norder to examine differentials in functioning change at\nhigher levels of functioning ability, we differentiate active\nlife into years with some functioning difficulties and years\nwith no reported difficulties. These definitions allow us to\nclassify persons in one of four functioning states, ranging\nfrom no functioning problems to inability to perform per-\nsonal care functions. The expanded \"state space\" allows us\nto assess whether demographic and socioeconomic differen-\ntials are similar across the full range of functioning experi-\nenced by the older population -- not simply in terms of\nsevere functioning problems.\nThe operational definitions of each of the four functioning\nstates are as follows:\n(1) Unable (because of health) to perform by oneself and\nwithout aids one or more of the following ADL functions:\nbathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed, toileting;\nor, residence in an institution;\n(2) Able to perform all of the above (but perhaps with\nsome difficulty) but unable to perform one or more of the\nfollowing IADL functions: preparing own meal, shopping\nfor personal items, managing money, using the telephone,\ndoing light housework;\n(3) Able to perform all of the above functions although\nperhaps with difficulty and/or has difficulty in one of the\nfollowing functions indicating stamina and mobility: walk-\ning one-quarter of a mile, walking up 10 steps without rest,\nstanding or being on feet for 2 hours, sitting for 2 hours,\nstooping/crouching/kneeling, lifting or carrying 10 pounds;\n(4) No difficulty in any of the 16 tasks used in the above\ndefinitions.\nThese states are assumed to represent a rough hierarchical\nscale of functioning ability, and empirical evidence from the\ndata support this assumption (Crimmins, Hayward, and\nSaito, 1994). The first two functioning states as defined\nabove are viewed as inactive life or disability; the last two\nstates are considered active life. Estimates of active and\ninactive life expectancy are derived from age-specific transi-\ntion rates for the 16 types of health events that can occur with\nfour states of life and death defining the state space. Four of\nthese are deaths from each of the functioning states. Six\ntransitions reflect movements to better functioning, while\nthe remaining six transitions denote movements to worse\nfunctioning.\nThe Data\nThe Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) is the data set\nutilized for this analysis. This study began in 1984 with\ninterviews of 7,527 individuals who were a representative\nsample of the noninstitutionalized population 70 years of\nage and over. A subset of the panel (5,151 respondents) was\nchosen for reinterview in 1986. Interviews were attempted\nTransition rates are estimated from the changes in function-\n90. For this analysis, the observations are pooled over the\nthree intervals in order to maximize the number of transi-\ntions of each type. In pooling we assume a Markov process\nand no period effects. The analysis is based on a total of\n15,450 person-intervals. An extensive description of this\ndata set including the sampling, exact wording of the\nquestions, and response rates can be found in Kovar, Fitti,\nThree important adjustments to the basic data were per-\nformed before proceeding with the analysis of active life\nexpectancy. Because the institutional population is initially\nomitted from the LSOA sample and only gradually enters the\nsample, the data underrepresent this segment of the older\npopulation. Information on the percent institutionalized by\nage and sex from the National Long Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS) is used to adjust the weight for the LSOA institu-\ntionalized respondents in order to better represent the func-\ntioning transitions of the entire older population. Because in\nour analysis all of the institutional sample is in the ADL-\nimpaired group, only the transitions observed for this group\nare influenced by the reweighting. The reweighting assures\nthat the institutional and noninstitutional segments of the\nADL-impaired population are correctly represented.\nAs with any longitudinal data set, attrition is a problem in\nthe LSOA. Because attrition for this sample is likely to be\nrelated to the mortality and disability outcomes of interest, it\ncannot be ignored. A combination of imputation and an\nadditional weighting adjustment was used to adjust for sam-\nple attrition to eliminate bias caused by sample loss (for\ndetails see Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). Our analy-\nsis is somewhat sensitive to these procedures. Four coef-\nficients become significant that would not be without the\nadjustments. Three of these involve change to better function-\ning among the group, including the institutional population.\nFinally, the fact that intervals between interviews differ\nslightly in length has also been taken into account. This has\nbeen done by adjusting the exposure interval in computing\nthe hazard rates.\nThe characteristics of the weighted pooled observations\nare shown in Table 1. Functioning change is observed for\nof the observations, and African Americans contribute 8\npercent of the observations. The observations contributed\nby education category are almost equal: persons with 0-11\nyears of education contribute 56 percent of the observa-\ntions, with 44 percent coming from persons with 12 or more\nyears. The distribution of observations by initial function-\ning state indicates that sample members are most likely to\nbegin the observation period with some functioning prob-\nlems (45%) and least likely to be unable to provide indepen-\ndent living (9%).\nMETHODS\nEstimation of mortality rates and the rates of entering and\nleaving functioning states for each subgroup of interest is the\nfirst step in our analysis. Multivariate hazard models are\nused to derive the subgroup specific transition rates which\nare used to calculate the multistate life tables. Because the\nLSOA does not provide complete histories of functioning\nchange over the 2-year intervals, we compare the respon-\ndent's status across 2-year observation intervals to identify\nfunctioning change and mortality events. Implicitly, the data\nstructure forces us to assume that only one transition occurs\nwithin any interval. This, of course, results in many unob-\nserved transitions. We also assume that all events, including\ncensoring, occur in mid-interval. Movements between states\nare characterized by conditional hazard rates adopting a\ndiscrete-time hazard modeling approach. This produces cen-\ntral transition rates similar to a standard life table.\nThe first model to be estimated includes only age and sex\nas covariates;\nlnhB\n(x) = pij0\n+ p(jl\nwhere hti\ndenotes the transition rate from state i to state j in\nTable 1.

Statistical significance of the\nestimated coefficients is examined to address the question of\nwhether there are differentials between groups in the risk of\nmaking certain health changes. A hierarchical-modeling\nstrategy is used to obtain best-fitting models. Beginning with\na main-effects \"full\" model, if an estimated coefficient for a\ngiven transition is not significant, the covariate is eliminated\nfrom the model and the model is reestimated using only sig-\nnificant covariates. Thus, in the multistate life table, transi-\ntion rates for covariate strata are not different unless the\nestimated coefficient in the hazard model is significant.\nDifferences in the estimates from the multistate life table\nthus reflect statistically significant differences for specific\ntypes of transitions. If we included insignificant coefficients,\nwe would be causing differences in life expectancy that were\nbased on insignificant differences. We also tested for a\nvariety of functional forms of age dependence for the 16\ntransitions in the model. In no instance did a more complex\nfunctional form improve the model's fit, compared to a\nmodel where the age effect was specified as linear.\nOur second set of models includes race and education as\ncovariates. Thus, for each transition we estimated the net\neffects of sex, race, and education.\nEducation is a dummy variable indicating 0 to 11 years of\nschooling, and its effect is measured relative to 12 or more\nyears. Equation (2) also was estimated with age-race interac-\ntion terms to investigate the existence of race crossovers in\nthe transition schedules (i.e., nonproportionality).\nResults of the above models are used to construct one-year\nage-sex-state and age-sex-race-education-state specific\nschedules of transition rates. The multistate life table is\nestimated by first transforming the transition rates into a\nmatrix of transition probabilities from which all other life-\ntable functions are derived. Details of the methods for\nderiving the life-table measures are available in a number of\nsources (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994; Hayward\n1980). In our analysis we use population-based rather than\nstatus-based multistate life tables because of our interest in\nhow the transition rates determine the prevalence of disabil-\nity in the life-table population. To estimate population-based\ntables, we initially distributed the radix population\nthe functioning states for the U.S. population 70 years of age\nso that only the effect of differing mortality and rates of\nfunctioning change is shown in the tables. Later in the\nanalysis we tested for the effect of subgroup differences in\nthe initial distribution of functioning status on outcomes.\nHowever, previous work has shown that radix differences\nhave negligible effects on life-table functions after only a\nfew years of age (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994;\nPopulation-based tables allow us to compute the implied\nage-specific prevalence of functioning states in the life-table\npopulation. These prevalence measures indicate the effects\nof differential rates of functioning change and mortality on\nthe disability and functioning structure of the population.\nThe prevalence rates of disability and functioning status are a\nconsequence of flows both into and out of the various\nfunctioning states and of the stock of persons in each status.\nFurther details on the methods employed are provided in\nRESULTS\nAge-Sex Differences\nResults of the hazards model analyses indicating the effects\nof age and sex on functioning status changes are shown in\nTable 2. Table 2 presents the antilogs of the parameter\nestimates showing the relative risk of making a transition\n(numbers above 1.0 indicate positive effects; numbers less\nthan 1.0 indicate negative effects). The transitions are sepa-\nrated in the table into those where the change is in the\ndirection of better functioning, worse functioning, and death.\nPrior research has documented that age is associated with\nbeing in poor health. The results in Table 2 show that age\ngenerally affects functioning changes regardless of individ-\nuals' initial and subsequent health statuses. Older persons,\nfor example, are more likely to die from any initial function-\ning state and to experience worsening ability to function. A\nyear of age increases the relative likelihood of death by 3\npercent in the inactive states and by 5 to 10 percent in the\nactive states. A year of age increases the relative risk of\ngoing from no functioning problems to an inactive state by\n11 to 15 percent. Younger persons are more likely to experi-\nence improved functioning. The one transition unaffected by\nage, from inability to provide personal care to inability to\nprovide independent living, is a transition with very low\nfrequency.\nMales across all levels of disability are more likely to die\nthan are females. This means that male-female life expect-\nancy differences result from greater male frailty across the\nrange of functioning. In the states of life that are active, at a\ngiven age a female is about half as likely to die as a male; in\ninactive states, women are 33 percent less likely to die. The\nincrease in chronic health problems appears to attenuate the\nsex effect somewhat. While sex does not affect the risk of all\nfunctioning transitions, where there are significant relation-\nships, men are more likely to experience improving func-\ntioning and women are more likely to experience deteriorat-\ning functioning. Thus, sex affects mortality and disability in\nthe opposite direction: Males experience higher mortality,\nand females experience worse functioning change.\nIn order to clarify the absolute effect of the age-sex\ncovariates on mortality, the one-year age-specific mortality\nrates from each functioning state by sex are calculated using\nthe results of the hazards models and are shown in Figures\n1A and IB. In general, as functioning deteriorates, mortality\nincreases for each sex although there is a crossover in\nmortality at the upper ages between those with some func-\ntioning problems and those with no problems. In fact, the\nmortality differences between the two active states are fairly\nsmall at all ages. Males have higher mortality rates from all\nfunctioning states, as would be expected from the estimated\ncoefficients.\nThe effect of the differing transition rates for men's and\nwomen's expected life in these functioning states is shown in\nTable\nFrom\n2.

Estimated mortality rates by functioning state for males 70\nFigure IB. Estimated mortality rates by functioning state for females 70\nand 13.9 years for females. Females have longer total\nexpected life and life in every state than males at age 70. The\nexpected length of inactive life for females is twice that for\nmales: 2.8 years for females and 1.4 years for males. For\nfemales, about two-thirds of inactive life (1.8 years) would\nbe a time when one would be unable to provide personal\ncare; for males, about half of inactive life (.8 years) is in this\nmost severely disabled category.\nThe percentage of life expected to be inactive is higher at\nevery age for females, but for both sexes it increases rapidly\nwith age. This is because the expected length of inactive life\nstays fairly constant with age, but the length of active life\ndecreases markedly for each sex. At age 80, females expect\nto spend more years in all of the states with functioning\nproblems than males, but the expected years with no func-\ntioning problems are similar for both sexes. Thus, women's\ngreater life expectancy at the highest ages compared to\nmen's is due to the greater number of years women live with\nfunctioning problems.\nMost of the difference in male-female active life expect-\nancy arises from the higher mortality of males in every\nfunctioning state rather than differences in the onset of\ndisability. Females gain inactive years through their longer\nsurvival in the inactive states. If males and females differed\nonly in mortality rates and not in functioning transition rates,\nthe sex difference in active life expectancy would be larger\nAge\nFemales\nMales\nTotal\nExpected\nLife\nTotal\nExpected Active Life\nNo\nFunctioning\nProblems\nSome\nFunctioning\nProblems\nTotal\nExpected Inactive Life\nUnable To Provide\nIndependent\nLiving\nUnable To Provide\nPersonal\nCare\n%\nInactive\nNote: Figures may not add to totals because of rounding.\nmales and females differed only in the functioning transi-\ntions and not in mortality, there would be very little sex\ndifference in either life expectancy or active life expectancy\nThe prevalence of functioning problems among men and\nwomen in the life-table population also is affected by the\ndifferent risks of dying and changing functioning status. At\nany age above the radix, women have a greater prevalence of\ndisability. Even though the model begins at age 70 with the\nsame distribution of functioning status for each sex, by age\n80 the odds of females being unable to provide personal care\nare 1.3 times those for men (Figure 2).\nDifferences in the likelihood of making health transitions\naffect both the life and death experiences of men and\n70 with similar levels of functioning but experience the age-\nsex transition schedules of this multistate life table, females\nwill experience almost 65 percent more transitions from an\nactive to an inactive state during their expected lives (55,813\nvs 34,022; data not shown). By definition, each one of these\ntransitions is from an independent to a dependent state when\nhelp from another person would be needed for independent\nliving and/or personal care. Examination of the transitions in\nthe multistate life table also indicates that females are more\nlikely to die after a period of dependency. About half of\nfemales (49%) die from a state of dependent life, while this\nis true of less than one-third of males (31%). These figures\nhave significant implications for the differential care re-\nquired by sex in the last years of life.\nThe above analysis assumes that males and females enter\nage 70 in similar functioning states and differ at this age and\nolder in their mortality rates, disability rates, and recovery\nrates. If the radix of the multistate life table is adjusted to\nrepresent the observed higher prevalence of poor functioning\nfor females than males at age 70, the results of the analysis\nare virtually unchanged. Female total life expectancy and\nlife expectancy in each of the active states would drop by . 1\nyear, whereas male life expectancy and life expectancy with\nno functioning problems would increase by . 1 year. These\nresults demonstrate that differences in the initial distribution\nof functioning state for an older age population are quickly\nextinguished by current rates of functioning state change.\nuu -\no-\n-D-\n+\n*\n*\n% Inactive: F\n% Inactive: M\n% Need Personal Care\n% Need Personal Care.\nF />\nM / /\nAge Group\nFigure 2. Percent of multistate life-table population inactive and unable\nto provide personal care for males and females 70 + .\nRace and Education\nIn our next analysis we introduce race and education into\nthe equations. When functioning status and education are\ncontrolled, race has relatively few effects on the risks that an\nolder individual will either die or change functioning state\n(Table 4). The one exception among the mortality transitions\nis the effect of race among persons unable to provide inde-\npendent living. Non-Blacks who are unable to provide inde-\npendent living are more likely to die than Blacks with similar\nfunctioning status. Race has a significant net effect for only 3\nof the 12 functioning transitions. In each case the coef-\nficients indicate that Blacks are less likely to recover and\nmore likely to experience declines in functioning ability\ncompared to non-Blacks. Thus, there is some evidence that\nAfrican Americans are more vulnerable than non-Blacks to\ndisability even with education and the initial disability state\ncontrolled. There is no evidence of worse mortality condi-\ntions for Blacks within functioning state.\nThe generally insignificant race effect on mortality is not\ndue to the fact that education is controlled. The results from\nhazard models excluding education are the same. Nor is the\nresult due to the fact that health status is controlled. Race\ndoes not affect mortality if observations are grouped into two\nTable 4.

The interaction and the main\neffect are significant in the transition from the state of no\nproblem functioning to death, but no other race or age-race\ninteraction terms are significant. This means that our lack of\nobserved racial effects in Table 4 is not due to a pattern of\nage-race crossovers in transition rates. Including the signifi-\ncant interaction terms into calculation of the transition rates\nhad only a negligible effect on the multistate life table\nestimates. Therefore, we proceed with our analysis without\nincorporating interaction terms.\nWithin functioning status groups, education is related to\nthe likelihood of death from the state of best functioning.\nAmong persons who have no functioning problems, those\nwith less than a complete high school education are more\nlikely than those with higher education to die. This may\nreflect a lack of diagnosis of conditions with no functioning\nconsequences such as some types of heart disease and high\nblood pressure among those with lower status and less\npreventative health care usage. Alternatively, higher status\npersons may delay death from this state by the medical\nmanagement of disease. Once functioning problems occur,\nour results are consistent with the idea that those with worse\neducation have their conditions diagnosed and treated so that\nhealth then is not differentiated by education.\nLower socioeconomic status also increases the chances of\nexperiencing the onset of mild disability and then progres-\nsion to the inability to provide independent living. On the\nother hand, among persons experiencing the most severe\nforms of disability, better-educated persons are more likely\nto recoup functioning. These transitions include moves out\nof an institution, and, as such, may include effects of both\ndifferential functioning change and differential ability to\nafford certain kinds of care. It is possible that higher status\npersons have alternatives to institutional care, or they may be\nrequired to find such alternatives because they are not eligi-\nble for Medicaid-provided institutional care.\nThese socioeconomic differences in mortality and func-\ntioning transitions result in differences in total and active life\nexpectancy by education (Table 5). Those with low educa-\ntion have about .7 fewer years of total life expectancy at age\n70 than those with at least a high school education in the\nsame race-sex group. Differences in the length of expected\nactive life are the primary cause of differences in total life\nexpectancy; active life expectancy for higher education\ngroups is one year longer than that for lower education race-\nsex groups. Differences in the length of inactive life are\nsmaller (.3 years for Black females is the widest range);\nthose with lower education have more years of inactive life.\nThis means that the proportion of expected inactive life is\nsomewhat higher for those with less education.\nThe total years of expected life is very similar for sex-\neducation groups of the two race groups. This is obviously\nderived from the fact that there was little race difference in\nmortality. The implication of race differences in the health\nstatus transition rates is that non-Blacks of both sexes expect\nsomewhat fewer years of inactive life and more years of\nactive life. This results in a smaller percentage of inactive\nlife for non-Blacks. The advantages non-Blacks have in\nactive life expectancy thus are due to race differences in the\nlikelihood of making disability transitions. The race differ-\nences are such that 23 percent of expected life is inactive for\nAfrican American women with higher education at age 70,\nSex\nFemale\nMale\nRace\nBlack\nNon-Black\nBlack\nNon-Black\nEducation\nTotal\nExpected\nLife\nTotal\nExpected Active Life\nNo\nFunctioning\nProblems\nSome\nFunctioning\nProblems\nTotal\nExpected Inactive Life\nUnable To\nProvide\nIndependent\nLiving\nUnable To\nProvide\nPersonal\nCare\n%\nInactive\nNote: Figures may not add to totals because of rounding.\nAge Group\nFigure 3A. Percent inactive by race and years of education: males.\nFigure 3B. Percent inactive by race and years of education: females.\nwhereas the figure for non-Black women is only 18 percent.\nThe size of the difference is similar for men.\nThe implication of the transition rates for the prevalence\nof disability among the life-table populations for sex-race-\neducation subgroups is shown in Figures 3A and 3B. By age\n80 the lower education groups of both Black and non-Black\nmales would expect to have about 40 percent more inactive\nor dependent people than the higher education group. For\nBlack females at this age the proportion dependent is about\none-third larger in the lowest status group; for non-Black\nwomen, the lower group has about one-fourth more depen-\ndent persons. For all sex-education groups in the life-table\npopulation, the proportion of the population that is depen-\ndent is higher in the Black population than the non-Black\npopulation.\nDISCUSSION\nThe large and consistent mortality differential between\nmen and women at all levels of functioning leads to substan-\ntially higher total and active life expectancy for women and\nto the larger sex difference in total compared to active life\nexpectancy. While women over age 70 experience more\ndisability events compared to men, this difference only\nreduces slightly the excess years of female active life. Even\nthis effect may be overestimated. Some of the observed sex\ndifferences in functioning transitions may not, in fact, reflect\ndifferences in ability to function but may be due to differ-\nences in the likelihood of institutionalization. Two of the\nfour significant sex differences in functioning reflected\nchanges into and out of the category containing the institu-\ntional population. Because we know that institutionalization\nis affected by one's support network as well as one's func-\ntioning ability, this may reflect sex differences in the support\nnetwork in old age. Because of the sex difference in mortal-\nity, older women are more likely than older men to be\nwidowed and then institutionalized because they have no\ncaregiving spouse. Thus, higher male mortality could be the\ncause of some of the greater likelihood for what appears to be\nfunctioning decline among women.\nOn the other hand, the differences in male and female\ndisability transitions may reflect sex differences in the dis-\neases causing disability (Verbrugge, 1989) as well as in the\npatterns and progression of certain diseases and conditions\nsample, women were more likely than men to report the\npresence of conditions such as osteoporosis (5.7 vs 0.6%)\nand arthritis (60.6 vs 45%). Both of these are non-mortal\nconditions which may be related to higher onset and lack of\nrecovery from disability. Men, on the other hand, are more\nlikely to report that they have heart disease (20.0 vs 15.0%),\nwhich is the major cause of death in this age range and is\ncertainly related to their higher mortality. Many who die\nfrom heart disease do so with little or no warning. Males are\nknown to have higher death rates from heart disease as well\nas other mortal conditions. This means that females are more\nlikely to survive these conditions and then acquire the\nnonfatal conditions more prominent among women.\nWomen's expectations for a longer inactive life, a greater\nlikelihood of experiencing disabling events, and a greater\nlikelihood of dying from the disabled state need to be\nincorporated into life cycle planning until there is a greater\nsimilarity in mortality between the sexes. Older women's as\nwell as men's lives would be very positively affected by a\ndecrease in male mortality that brought their rates closer to\nthose of women. Such a decrease would provide more\ncaregivers for women in their years of disability.\nEven at the oldest ages, life differs for those of different\nsocioeconomic backgrounds. Those of higher status are\nmore likely to survive to old age and they are more likely to\nsurvive old age better. Because there are stronger socioeco-\nnomic effects on functioning change than mortality, socio-\neconomic differentials in active life expectancy exceed those\nfor total life expectancy. Within race groups, persons of\nlower education live shorter total and active lives.\nBecause Black and non-Black mortality are the same in\nthree states of functioning, there are no significant race\ndifferences in total life expectancy estimated for race-\neducation subgroups. However, non-Blacks live fewer years\nof life inactive and more active. Socioeconomic differences\nin disability onset and recovery lead to higher prevalences of\ndisability among those who are Black and of low education.\nThis results in a more difficult life for both these groups and\ntheir families, who are likely to be called on to serve as\ncaregivers.\nThe similarity of mortality between African American and\nother persons in this sample replicates the findings of other\nlongitudinal studies of the older population (Berkman,\nSinger, and Manton, 1989). If the racial crossover in mortal-\nity found in almost all data generated from vital statistics is\ndue to errors on the death certificate, as suggested by Preston\net al. (1995), a crossover is less likely to occur in sample\nsurveys where the deceased reports his or her own age while\nstill living. Investigation of the race patterns of differences\nbetween ages reported in sample surveys and on death\ncertificates of sample members would be enlightening on\nthis score.\n"
