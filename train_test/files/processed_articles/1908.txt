We examined\nwhether they also suffer disproportionate school and criminal-justice\nsanctions.\nMETHODS: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health fol-\nlowed a nationally representative sample of adolescents who were in\nused to assess nonheterosexuality: same-sex attraction, same-sex ro-\nmantic relationships, and lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) self-\nidentification. Six outcomes were assessed: school expulsion; police\nstops; juvenile arrest; juvenile conviction; adult arrest; and adult con-\nviction. Multivariate analyses controlled for adolescents' sociodemo-\ngraphics and behaviors, including illegal conduct.\nRESULTS: Nonheterosexuality consistently predicted a higher risk for\nsanctions. For example, in multivariate analyses, nonheterosexual ad-\nolescents had greater odds of being stopped by the police (odds ratio:\nself-identification). Similar trends were observed for school expulsion,\njuvenile arrest and conviction, and adult conviction. Nonheterosexual\ngirls were at particularly high risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonheterosexual youth suffer disproportionate ed-\nucational and criminal-justice punishments that are not explained\nby greater engagement in illegal or transgressive behaviors.

Nonheterosexual youth also\nare more likely than their peers to be\nreferred to courts by their families\nthrough PINS (Person in Need of Super-\nvision) or CHINS (Child in Need of Su-\npervision) petitions.8 In addition, con-\nsensual same-sex sexual acts more\noften trigger punishments than equiv-\nruling in Lawrence et al v Texas,20\nstates could legally prosecute same-\nsex couples for consensual sexual\nacts. Anecdotal reports5,21 have sug-\ngested that nonheterosexual girls may\nbe particularly overrepresented in\nthe juvenile-justice system. Scholars\nhave suggested that the overrepresen-\ntation of nonheterosexual girls may re-\nlate to the historical role of the\njuvenile-justice system in policing\ngirls' sexuality,22 as well as a height-\nened juvenile-justice system and me-\ndia opprobrium directed at girls with\n\"aggressive\" or \"masculine\" gender\nTo our knowledge, no previous studies\nhave examined whether nonhetero-\nsexual youth are overrepresented\namong those who have received\nschool and criminal-justice sanctions\nnationally. Using data from the Na-\ntional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health), we examined this\nquestion after controlling for trans-\ngressive and illegal behaviors.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Sample\nAdd Health, conducted by the Caro-\nlina Population Center, consists of\nrepeated surveys of a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of youth who\nwere in grades 7 through 12 during\npling frame was school based; all\nstudents who were listed on selected\nschool rosters were eligible, and\nthere was oversampling of some\nparticipated in the wave 1 in-home\ninterviews. Special techniques, in-\ncluding the use of individual head-\nsets and direct entry of answers into\nlaptop computers, were developed to\nwave 1 participants.\nWave 3 of Add Health, conducted in\nto questions originally asked during\nwave 1, wave 3 respondents were\nasked about their criminal-justice con-\ntacts. Wave 3 excluded subjects who\nwere outside the United States, but ef-\nforts were made to recontact incarcer-\nated subjects. Our analysis included\nwere performed only using data on ado-\nlescents who participated in waves 1\nthrough 3. Yale University's institutional\nreview board approved this research.\nMeasures: Predictor Variables\nResearchers commonly recognize at-\ntraction, behavior, and identity as 3\ncomponents of sexual orientation and\nhave noted the importance of examin-\nof desires and fantasies; behavior con-\nsists of sexual activities that involve\nphysical contact and sexual arousal;\nand identity involves the labels and\nmeanings that individuals attach to\ntheir own sexualities.27\nThe Add Health surveys included ques-\ntions that assess all 3 components. In\nall waves participants were asked,\n\"Have you ever had a romantic attrac-\ntion to a male?\" and \"Have you ever had\na romantic attraction to a female?\" Re-\nspondents who reported an attraction\nto a person of their own gender in ei-\nther wave were considered to have ex-\nperienced same-sex attraction. In addi-\ntion, participants in all 3 waves were\nasked to describe their romantic and\nsexual relationships, including their\npartners' genders. Respondents who\nlisted a same-sex relationship in either\nstudy wave were considered to have\nhad a same-sex relationship. In wave\n3 only, respondents were asked,\n\"Choose the description that best fits\nhow you think about yourself\" (re-\nsponse options: 100% heterosexual\n[straight], mostly heterosexual\n[straight] but somewhat attracted to\npeople of your own gender, bisexual--\nthat is, attracted to men and women\nequally, mostly homosexual [gay] but\nsomewhat attracted to people of the\nopposite gender, 100% homosexual\n[gay], and not sexually attracted to ei-\nther males or females [the few adoles-\ncents who selected this last option\nwere excluded]). For the main analy-\nses, sample-size considerations dic-\ntated that self-identification be\nspecified dichotomously as 100% het-\nerosexual versus other than 100% het-\nerosexual. In this article we refer to all\nyouth in the latter category as lesbian,\ngay, or bisexual (LGB). The broader\nterm \"nonheterosexual\" is used to in-\ndicate any youth who self-identified as\nLGB or who affirmed a same-sex at-\ntraction or relationship.\nThe variety of answers given to these\nquestions illustrates the complexity\nand fluidity of adolescents' sexual ori-\nentations.28 Of Add Health respondents\nwho indicated same-sex attraction in\nwave 1, only 27% reported such attrac-\ntion in wave 3. In wave 1, only 9% of\nrespondents who indicated a same-sex\nattraction reported a same-sex rela-\ntionship. In addition, 28% of respon-\ndents who experienced a same-sex re-\nlationship self-identified as entirely\nheterosexual. For this analysis, each\ncomponent (attraction, relationship,\nand self-identification) was modeled\nseparately. In addition, supplemental\nbivariate models were created to ex-\namine adolescents who might be\n\"questioning,\" as defined by self-\nreporting same-sex attraction while\nself-identifying as 100% heterosexual.\nWith other supplemental bivariate\nmodels we examined each self-\nidentification category separately.\nTransgressive Behavior and Other\nControl Variables\nBecause nonheterosexual adolescents\nengage in high rates of some trans-\ngressive behaviors, and each instance\nof such behaviors represents an expo-\nsure to the risk of sanction, control for\nthese behaviors was necessary to elu-\ncidate the impact of sexual orientation,\nper se. Add Health asked questions\nabout behaviors in the following form:\n\"In the past 12 months, how often did\nyou X?\" Responses were coded as 0 for\ntimes, and 3 for 5 or more times.\nFor the current analysis, 3 indices\nwere created to summarize transgres-\nsive behaviors. One index, \"minor\ntransgressions,\" summed responses\nto questions regarding low-risk misbe-\nhaviors such as running away, lying to\nparents about whereabouts, shoplift-\ning, getting drunk, graffiti-writing, van-\ndalism, and public rowdiness. The re-\nsulting index ranged from 0 to 21. A\nsecond index, \"moderate transgres-\nsions,\" was based on responses to 5\nquestions regarding stealing objects\nworth less or more than $50, selling\ndrugs, driving a car without the own-\ner's permission, and burglary. The re-\nsulting index ranged from 0 to 15. A\nfinal index, \"violent behavior,\" summed\nresponses regarding physical fighting,\ninjuring someone, using or threaten-\ning someone with a weapon, and par-\nticipating in a group fight. The result-\ning index ranged from 0 to 12. In total, 9\ntransgressive-behavior indices were\ncreated, 3 for each study wave. The\nmain models included only wave 1 indi-\nces to minimize endogeneity (ie, the ten-\ndency of sanctions to worsen an adoles-\ncent's behavior); sensitivity analyses\nincluded all 9 indices in the models.\nIn addition to behavior, models con-\ntrolled for age, gender, self-identified\nrace/ethnicity (white, black, Latino,\nand other) and family socioeconomic\nstatus, as modeled by a 10-level com-\nposite index based on income, occupa-\ntion, and parental education.29\nOutcomes: Institutional Sanctions\nAdd Health included detailed questions\nabout school expulsions and criminal-\njustice contacts, which were summa-\nrized into 6 outcomes:\n1. ever expelled from school;\n2. ever stopped by police;\n3. ever arrested before the age of 18;\n4. ever convicted (or pled guilty) in ju-\nvenile court;\n5. ever arrested after turning 18; and\n6. ever convicted (or pled guilty) in\nadult court.\nAlthough Add Health attempted to lo-\ncate wave 1 participants who were in-\ncarcerated during wave 3, it seems\nlikely (on the basis of the low reported\nincarceration rate) that incarcerated\nyouth were undersampled.30 Table 1\nsummarizes all variables modeled.\nStatistical Analysis\nStata/SE 10 for Windows, was used for\nall analyses.31 Bivariate relationships\nbetween the 3 measures of nonhetero-\nsexuality (attraction, relationship, and\nLGB self-identification) and the 6 insti-\ntutional sanctions were examined by\nusing 2 tests.\nEighteen sets of logistic regression\nmodels were constructed to examine\nthe relationships between each of the\n3 measures of nonheterosexuality and\neach of the 6 sanctions while control-\nling for sociodemographic factors and\nmisbehaviors. Each set of models was\nconstructed first for the entire sample\nand then according to gender. Sepa-\nrate models were not constructed for\nrace or socioeconomic status sub-\ngroups because of sample size. All\nanalyses were corrected for sampling\nprobabilities and clustering. Because\nof multiple testing, findings with P val-\nscribed as showing a trend and should\nbe interpreted cautiously; only find-\nings with a P value of .001 were\ndeemed statistically significant. Re-\nsults for cells that contained fewer\nthan 10 respondents are not reported.\nRESULTS\ndata for both the wave 1 and 3 surveys,\nspondents reported same-sex attrac-\nrespondents reported same-sex rela-\nof female respondents self-identified\nas LGB (ie, other than 100% heterosex-\nual). Male subjects were more likely to\nrespond that they were either 100%\nhomosexual or 100% heterosexual,\nARTICLES\nwhereas female subjects more often\nself-identified in middle categories.\nTransgressive behavior was common\namong all respondents; 76% reported\nminor transgressions, 30% reported\nmoderate transgressions, and 41% re-\nported violent behavior. Nonhetero-\nsexual adolescents engaged in more\nminor and moderate transgressions\nbut not violence. Adolescents who\nwere attracted to the same sex aver-\naged 3.60 on the minor-transgression\nscale (vs 2.84 for other adolescents;\ntransgression scale (vs 0.71 for other\nthe violence scale (vs 0.98 for other ad-\nolescents; P  .11). Respondents who\nwere involved in same-sex relation-\nships tended to report more minor\ntransgressions (scaled score: 3.72 vs\nbut not more moderate transgres-\nspondents who self-identified as LGB\naveraged higher on the minor-\nmoderate-transgression scale (1.00 vs\n.02). Supplemental models of misbe-\nhaviors according to detailed self-\nidentification category appear in Ap-\npendix 1. As seen in previous studies,32\nmale adolescents exhibited more\ntransgressive behaviors than female\nadolescents (details available from the\nauthors).\nBivariate Results\nTable 2 presents bivariate relation-\nships between the 3 nonheterosexual-\nity indicators and the 6 sanctions.\nYouth who indicated same-sex attrac-\ntion or relationships showed a trend\ncomparisons. In contrast, sanction\nrates among self-identified LGB youth\ndiffered according to gender. Only self-\nidentified LGB female subjects consis-\ntently experienced significantly more\nsanctions, and LGB male subjects\nshowed a trend toward lower rates\nof school expulsion.\nUsing supplemental bivariate analyses\nwe explored alternative specifications\nof the self-identification variable. First,\neach detailed self-identification cate-\ngory was analyzed and gave varying re-\nsults for different sanctions (Appendix\n2). Then, the definition of LGB was iter-\natively expanded from 100% homosex-\nual by adding each of the 3 middle cat-\negories between 100% homosexual\nand 100% heterosexual (data not\nshown). The trend of these iterative\nanalyses was consistent: LGB identity\npredicted greater sanctions relative to\nmodels (P  .05). Finally, to explore\nquestioning, data from adolescents\nwho reported a same-sex attraction\nbut self-identified as 100% hetero-\nsexual were analyzed (Appendix 3);\nthese youth seemed to be at elevated\nrisk of all sanctions except adult\narrest. Because of the sample size,\nneither multivariate nor gender-\nstratified models were possible for\nalternate specifications of the self-\nidentification variable.\nMultivariate Results\nThe association between nonhetero-\nsexuality and elevated risk of sanc-\ntions persisted in the multivariate\nmodels (Table 3). In all 18 primary\nmodels, the odds ratio (OR) for each\nindicator of nonheterosexuality (at-\ntraction, relationship, and self-\nidentification) exceeded 1.0, al-\nthough many of these ORs were\nnonsignificant.\nBoth same-sex attraction and LGB\nself-identification were significantly\nassociated with police stops,\nwhereas same-sex relationship\nshowed a similar trend. In addition,\nyouth who experienced same-sex at-\ntraction showed a trend toward\nmore school expulsion and adult con-\nTABLE 1 Descriptive Statistics for Analysis Variables\nOutcome Variable (Sanction) Wave\nMeasured\nn Mean  SD\nor % (SE)a\nIndependent variables (indicators of\nnonheterosexuality)\nSelf-identified as LGB (anything other than 100%\nheterosexual)\nControl variables\na Mean  SD and % (SE) are for wave 3 respondents.\nSelf-identification as LGB showed a\ntrend toward higher odds of all sanc-\ntions except school expulsion and\nadult arrest. This result was surpris-\ning, because of the 3 nonheterosexual-\nity indicators, LGB self-identification\nshowed the weakest bivariate relation-\nship with sanctions. The stronger\nmultivariate association may have\nemerged because of control for violent\nbehavior.\nAs in the bivariate models, there were\nsome gender differences. Nonhetero-\nsexuality showed a trend toward\nhigher odds of sanctions in 8 of 18\nstratified models for female subjects\nbut in only 2 of 18 for male subjects.\nThe association between same-sex at-\ntraction and sanctions seemed stron-\nger for female subjects (ORs often\nTABLE 2 Nonheterosexuality and Institutional Sanctions: Bivariate Analysis\nSame-Sex Attraction Same-Sex Relationship Nonheterosexual Self-identification\nExperienced\nSame-Sex Attraction\nNever Experienced\nSame-Sex Attraction\nReported Same-\nSex Relationship\nDid Not Report\nSame-Sex\nRelationship\nIdentified as LGB\nHeterosexual)\nIdentified as\na Numbers in parentheses represent the P value compared with heterosexual youth, defined by the absence of the given indicator of nonheterosexual status.\nTABLE 3 Multivariate ORs for Institutional Sanctions Associated With Nonheterosexual Status\nSame-Sex Attraction,\nOR (P)\nSame-Sex Relationship,\nOR (P)\nLGB Self-identification,\nOR (P)\nOR (P) n OR (P) n OR (P) n\nData were controlled for age, race, behavior, and socioeconomic status.\nARTICLES\napproached 2.0). The association be-\ntween same-sex relationships and\nsanctions did not vary according to\ngender. Self-identification as LGB\nshowed the same gendered associa-\ntion with sanctions as those in the bi-\nvariate models. Female subjects, but\nnot male subjects, who self-identified\nas LGB had very high odds of experi-\nencing most sanctions.\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings suggest that nonhetero-\nsexual adolescents, particularly girls,\nsuffer punishments by school and\ncriminal-justice authorities that are\ndisproportionate to their rates of\ntransgressive behavior. Although the\nresults of some small surveys and eth-\nnographic studies have suggested\nan overrepresentation of nonhetero-\nsexual adolescents among those who\nours is the first documentation of this\nphenomenon in a nationally represen-\ntative, population-based sample.\nOverall, nonheterosexual adolescents\nodds than their heterosexual peers of\nexperiencing sanction, depending on\nthe indicator of nonheterosexuality\nand the sanction examined. This ele-\nvated risk was present for boys and\ngirls who indicated same-sex attrac-\ntion and same-sex relationships and\nfor girls who self-identified as LGB,\neven after controlling for nonhetero-\nsexual youths' greater engagement in\nminor and moderate transgressive be-\nhaviors (nonheterosexual youth do not\nengage in more violent behaviors than\ntheir peers).\nAs in other studies,33 self-identification\npatterns differed according to gender;\nmore male subjects identified as 100%\nheterosexual or 100% homosexual,\nwhereas more female subjects se-\nlected middle categories. The re-\nsponse patterns of female study par-\nticipants were concordant with\nyoung women's sexualities are fluid\nand not amenable to rigid classifica-\ntion. The current analysis revealed\nadditional gender differences in\nsanction disparities; nonhetero-\nsexual girls were at particularly high\nrisk. In addition, it seems that youth\nwho question their sexuality may be\nat especially high risk for sanctions,\nalthough sample-size limitations\nprecluded detailed exploration of\nthis hypothesis.\nThere are several potential explana-\ntions for our findings. Institutional\ndecision-makers may focus on nonhet-\nerosexual youth for punishment for\nsexual or other behaviors or be less\nlikely to consider mitigating factors\nsuch as immaturity or self-defense. In-\ndeed, teachers often overlook harass-\nment of nonheterosexual students by\ntheir peers, and youth who report such\nabuse are frequently ignored or\nblamed for their victimization.3,6,10 In\naddition, nonheterosexual youth some-\ntimes encounter homophobia in health\nThus, nonheterosexual youth who are\nharassed or engage in risky behaviors\nmay find that instead of support, ther-\napy, or services, their behaviors elicit\npunishment.\nAlternatively, unmeasured confound-\ners, such as misbehaviors not cap-\ntured in Add Health, might drive the ob-\nserved associations. Of particular\nconcern are youth who might report\nnonheterosexuality as part of a broad\npattern of defiant behavior. Although\npossible, such confounding seems un-\nlikely. Multivariate models controlled\nfor a variety of transgressive behav-\niors, including those in which nonhet-\nerosexual youth tend to engage. More-\nover, in sensitivity analyses that\nincluded additional behavior controls\nconstructed from waves 2 and 3, ORs\nclosely resembled those in the princi-\npal analyses, although missing data\nreduced the sample size by 27%, which\nprecluded subgroup analysis (results\navailable from the authors).\nResidual confounding according to be-\nhavior might occur if nonheterosexual\nrespondents were more reluctant\nthan others to report transgressive\nbehaviors. However, because nonhet-\nerosexuality was determined accord-\ning to self-report, youth who self-\nidentified as nonheterosexual were, by\ndefinition, willing to report at least\nsome sensitive personal information.\nA similar willingness among other re-\nspondents cannot be assumed. Al-\nthough incarceration might be thought\nto encourage same-sex sexual behav-\nior, incarceration was much too rare\nin the sample to explain the results.\nThe broad definition of nonheterosexu-\nality captured adolescents who self-\nidentified as heterosexual but experi-\nenced occasional same-sex attraction\nor relationships. Arguably, however,\nthis makes the findings stronger be-\ncause of the suggestion that mere ex-\nploration of nonheterosexuality, re-\ngardless of self-identification, places\nyouth at risk for sanctions.\nThe fact that nonheterosexual youth\nare more likely than other adolescents\nto run away from home2 suggests that\nthey may be overrepresented among\nbetween waves 1 and 3. If runaway\nyouth are more likely to experience\nsanctions, the lost subjects may have\nmade the conclusions of this analysis\noverly conservative. College atten-\ndance is another possible confounder;\nsome, but not all, reports have sug-\ngested that low education attainment\nis associated with heterosexuality.38\nHowever, Add Health's methods make\nit unlikely that college students would\nbe selectively lost to follow-up.\nA final limitation is the distortion that\nmay have resulted from multiple test-\ning. However, the number of ORs with a\nthe overall population), and many\nfindings were significant at P  .001\nor greater. In addition, although the\noverall sample size was large\ntion), the relatively small numbers of\nrespondents who experienced sanc-\ntions and indicated nonheterosexu-\nality limited the study power.\nSample-size limitations also pre-\ncluded the analysis of racial sub-\ngroups; nonwhite adolescents repre-\nsent an important group for future\nstudy, given their overrepresen-\ntation among those receiving\nAdd Health lacks reliable information\nabout gender identity. The wave 3 sur-\nvey included questions from the Bem\nSex-Role Inventory, which was de-\nsigned to elicit gender identity by ask-\ning respondents to affirm statements\nsuch as \"I love children.\" Unfortu-\nnately, the Bem Inventory correlates\npoorly with gender self-identification40\nand, hence, was not analyzed. Because\nmany nonheterosexual people are\ngender-nonconforming,41 however, the\nresults of this study suggest that non-\nnormative gender identity might con-\ntribute to sanction disparities. Indeed,\nresults of qualitative studies have sug-\ngested that transgendered individuals\nare at particular risk of discrimination\nand victimization within the school and\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings indicate that nonhetero-\nsexual adolescents suffer dispropor-\ntionate punishments by schools and\nthe criminal-justice system, which im-\nplicates not only schools, police, and\ncourts but also other youth-serving\nhealth and welfare systems that often\nfail to meet the needs of nonhetero-\nsexual adolescents. Thus, our results\nsuggest an urgent need for all child-\nserving professionals to reflect on\nstrategies to reduce the criminaliza-\ntion of nonheterosexual youth as they\nnavigate adolescence in an often hos-\ntile society.\n"
