The issue is\nreaddressed in the context with the expected enlargement. Probably more so than\nregions in large economies, countries in a currency union may be characterised by\ndifferent business cycles and monetary transmission processes that may converge over\ntime. Besides, nations may differ in their ideas about a desirable inflation rate and\noutput targets. In a monetary union, the supranational central bank can pursue only one\nmonetary policy and it should be designed to reach an optimum for the currency area as\na whole. The European Central Bank is expected to cope with this task. Its design\nintegrates both the members of the executive board and the national central-bank\npresidents into the central-bank council where everyone has one vote. Besides, the\nstatutes require the national central-bank presidents to look at the currency area as a\nwhole. By contrast, a supranational central-bank council with national central-bank\npresidents that put the interests of their respective countries first might lead to a\ndifferent monetary policy outcome. The weighting of the central-bank board and the\ngroup of national central-bank presidents within the council then has monetary policy\nimplications and is therefore crucial for the member countries, especially if they differ\nin size. The study addresses this issue in detail. In this context, it deals with the aspects\nof asymmetric shock scenarios, different monetary transmission processes and divergent\noutput preferences and shows that the more varied these issues are across the members,\nthe more countries of different sizes have preferences for a particular composition of the\ncentral-bank council. A small country often favours the group of national central-bank\npresidents, which attributes the same weight to each president, being in a strong position\nwhile a large country is better off under the decisions of a central-bank board as the\nboard takes the relative country sizes of the members of the monetary union into\naccount. These preferences diminish or disappear when the labour forces within the\nmonetary union migrate since, through migration, the economic differences between the\ncountries are reduced or even offset. Furthermore, in the case of output persistence in\nconjunction with labour migration, monetary policy by a small country within the group\nof national presidents may adversely affect its future welfare.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nSeit der Schaffung der Europ\u00e4ischen W\u00e4hrungsunion hat die Frage der Ausgestaltung\neines Zentralbankrats f\u00fcr einen W\u00e4hrungsraum, der mehrere L\u00e4nder umfasst, eine\npraktische Bedeutung erlangt. Sie ist im Zusammenhang mit der erwarteten Erweiterung\nerneut in den Blick ger\u00fcckt. Wahrscheinlich st\u00e4rker als Regionen in einer gro\u00dfen\nVolkswirtschaft sind die L\u00e4nder einer W\u00e4hrungsunion durch unterschiedliche\nKonjunkturverl\u00e4ufe und unterschiedliche monet\u00e4re Transmissionsmechanismen\ngepr\u00e4gt, die sich ggf. jedoch im Laufe der Zeit angleichen. Au\u00dferdem k\u00f6nnen\nunterschiedliche Vorstellungen der einzelnen Mitgliedsl\u00e4nder zu einer\nw\u00fcnschenswerten Inflationsrate und zu einem w\u00fcnschenswerten Outputvolumen f\u00fcr das\nW\u00e4hrungsgebiet vorliegen. In einer W\u00e4hrungsunion kann die supranationale\nZentralbank nur eine Geldpolitik betreiben, die optimal in Hinblick auf den gesamten\nW\u00e4hrungsraum sein sollte. Die Statuten der Europ\u00e4ischen Zentralbank sind auf diese\nErfordernisse ausgerichtet worden. Das Entscheidungsgremium der EZB setzt sich aus\nden Mitgliedern ihres Direktoriums und den nationalen Zentralbankpr\u00e4sidenten des\nW\u00e4hrungsraums zusammen. Dabei hat jedes Gremiumsmitglied eine Stimme im\nAbstimmungsprozess. Ferner verpflichten die Statuten der EZB die nationalen\nPr\u00e4sidenten darauf, bei ihren Entscheidungen das Wohl des gesamten W\u00e4hrungsraums\nzu verfolgen. Hingegen w\u00fcrde ein supranationaler Zentralbankrat mit\nZentralbankpr\u00e4sidenten der Mitgliedsl\u00e4nder, die vorrangig die Interessen ihrer L\u00e4nder\nvertreten, zu anderen geldpolitischen Entscheidungen gelangen. In diesem Fall h\u00e4tte die\nGewichtung des Direktoriums, das den gesamten W\u00e4hrungsraum im Blick hat, und die\nder Gruppe der nationalen Pr\u00e4sidenten im Zentralbankrat Auswirkungen auf die\nGeldpolitik. Sie w\u00e4re vor allem dann von Relevanz f\u00fcr die einzelnen Mitgliedsl\u00e4nder,\nwenn diese sich in ihrer Gr\u00f6\u00dfe unterschieden. Auf diesen Punkt geht das vorliegende\nArbeitspapier n\u00e4her ein. Darauf abgestellt werden die Bedeutung asymmetrischer\nSchocks, unterschiedlicher monet\u00e4rer Transmissionsmechanismen und\nunterschiedlicher relativer Outputpr\u00e4ferenzen aufgegriffen. Bei der Vorlage von\nnationalen Asymmetrien w\u00fcrde ein kleines Land eine starke Position der Gruppe der\nnationalen Pr\u00e4sidenten, in der jedem Pr\u00e4sidenten unabh\u00e4ngig von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Landes,\ndem er vorsteht, die gleiche Bedeutung beigemessen wird, bevorzugen. Hingegen w\u00fcrde\nein gro\u00dfes Land in diesem Fall Entscheidungen, die von dem Zentralbankdirektorium\ngetroffen werden, begr\u00fc\u00dfen.

In 1992 the members of the\nEuropean Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, which set out the schedule for\nestablishing EMU. In January 1998 the single European currency was introduced in 11\ncountries. Latest, the expected enlargement lead to a rise in the interest in this field.\nThe establishment of a currency union brings about the abolition of national currencies,\nwhich are strong national symbols (see Buiter (1999, p 297)); however, the loss of\nsovereign national policies did not occur as a result of the launch of EMU; this had\nalready happened to some extent with the European Monetary System (EMS). Under\nthe EMS, Germany set its own monetary policy, and many other European countries\nadopted the German policy in order to remain within the EMS. By contrast, the\nEuropean Central Bank should conduct the policy that is most appropriate for the\ncurrency area as a whole (see OECD (1999, p 11)). Topics related to EMU, ie the euro\narea, are highly relevant not only to Europe but also to the world as a whole. The euro\narea is one of the largest economic regions of the world with 307.8 million inhabitants\nin 2002. In comparison, 288.2 million people lived in the USA. Euro-area GDP reached\nBesides this study, there are already a large number of articles that treat the relevance of\nthe optimum-currency-area criteria. In particular, Aksoy, de Grauwe and Dewachter\n(2002) already deal with several of the aspects that are taken up in a different way\n I am indebted to the participants of the ESEM conference 2001 in Lausanne (Switzerland) and the\nresearch seminar at the University of Helsinki in December 2001 for comments on the first part of the\npaper. Besides, the paper benefited from discussion in the research seminar at the Deutsche Bundesbank\nin April 2004. In particular, I am very grateful to Falko Fecht, Heinz Herrmann, Seppo Honkapohja,\nThomas Knetsch, Michael Rauscher and Ulf von Kalckreuth for constructive criticisms.\n Deutsche Bundesbank, Economics Department, email: rainer.frey@bundesbank.de. The paper\nrepresents the authors` personal opinions and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Bundesbank.\nbelow. As in this study, they consider different preferences in the various euro-area\ncountries, different national monetary transmission processes and asymmetric shocks.\nThe objective of the central bank is to minimise the expected loss caused by deviations\nof the inflation rate from an inflation target and of the output level from an output-gap\ntarget, and by interest-rate changes. Aksoy et al distinguish between three voting\nprocedures: consensus rule in the Governing Council of the ECB, ECB rule with some\nnational considerations, and a rule in which each representative takes a national view.\nThey find that within EMU, the existing asymmetries are not strong enough to make the\npolicy decisions under these two types of voting procedure diverge to a significant\nextent. As in this study, de Grauwe (2000) formally addresses the relevance of\nasymmetric shocks and differences in the monetary transmission processes. In decision-\nmaking either the member countries have the same weight or euro-wide aggregates are\nconsidered. Similarly, Gros and Hefeker (2002) question whether the supranational\ncentral bank of a monetary union should look at the euro-area aggregates or if it were\nbetter to minimise the average of national losses. Von Hagen (2000a and 2000b) also\nconsiders the relevance of the composition of the Governing Council to the decisions of\nthe ECB. Von Hagen shows that, since decisions in the ECB Governing Council are\ntaken by majority vote, the mean voter gets his preferred inflation rate. As below, Dixit\n(2001) also considers a central bank that commits itself to a weighted average of the\nmost preferred policy rules of the member countries. In Gruner (1999), if the central\nbank considers aggregate variables of the currency area, a symmetric subgame-perfect\nNash equilibrium arises. Provided the monetary decisions are taken by majority vote,\nthe monetary decisions are taken by national central-bank presidents with national\ninterests, and two equilibria emerge. Either all wages in all countries rise by the same\nrate or half of the countries are high-wage countries and half of the countries are low-\nwage countries. Von Hagen and S\u00fcppel (1994) consider the relationship between\ncentral-bank decisions and elections in the member countries. They find that elections\nshould not occur in more than half of the member countries at one time; otherwise, the\nmedian voter of the central-bank council might take into account the political aspects of\nhis own home country. Additionally, von Hagen and S\u00fcppel see a conflict between the\nefficient stabilisation of the real economy and long-run price stability. They propose\nthat the group of national presidents should address the long-run course while the\ncentral-bank council should be responsible for the stabilisation of the real economy.\nBelow, great weight is put on the relevance of the design of the objective function of the\nsupranational central bank. The model allows for a flexible weighting of the central-\nbank board and of the group of national central-bank presidents within the central-bank\ncouncil. Besides, the consideration of the relative sizes of the member countries, the\ndegree of labour mobility and of output persistence are issues that have been neglected\nin large parts of the existing literature in this field. However, these aspects have\nimportant implications as they make the composition of the central-bank council crucial\nfor the welfare of the member countries of the currency area as a whole. Starting out\nfrom this framework, the conduct monetary policy is readdressed for several output-\nshock scenarios. This is also done for different monetary-transmission processes and\ndifferent relative preferences for the output objective across the member countries.1\nLike quite a number of articles addressing central-bank policy, this paper is based on the\napproach provided by Barro and Gordon (1983). The starting point of the analysis is a\nquadratic social loss function with the inflation rate and the output level as its\narguments. According to Svensson (2000), a `symmetric inflation target' as reflected in\nthe loss function by the squared deviation of the inflation rate from its desirable value is\nimportant to fight both inflation and deflation. Additionally, the central bank pursues an\noutput target to moderate business cycles.2 Like the supranational-central bank, both\nmember countries are assumed to minimise their loss functions that are squared in the\noutput levels and in the inflation rates at home. Minimising the loss function, the central\nbank has to consider the constraint given by the inflation-output trade-off, the Phillips\ncurve (Phillips (1958) and Lucas (1976)). In this connection, output persistence may be\nconsidered (see Lockwood, Miller and Zhang (1998)).\n1 Though this study takes up quite a lot of issues of the optimum-currency-area literature, it is still far way\nfrom a complete analysis. Credibility aspects and microeconomic issues in particular are dropped, e.g.\ndynamic efficiency gains of a currency union. Also within the Barro-Gordon framework, some of the\nissues above are investigated for the regimes of flexible and fixed exchange rates in Frey (2004).\n2 Empirically, Clarida and Gertler (1996) found the Bundesbank to pursue output targets: \" ... we find\nthat the performance of the real economy also influences its [of the Bundesbank] decision making. It\nadopts a gradualist approach to disinflating and it does ease when the real economy weakens.\" Clarida\nThis paper is organised as follows. The structure of the model is presented in Section 2.\nSection 3 presents the optimal inflation-rate rules depending on the composition of the\ncentral-bank council. With different shock scenarios, Section 4 derives welfare\nimplications considering the relevance of the composition of the central-bank council,\nthe monetary transmission processes of the two countries, differences in the preference\nparameters in the loss functions across the member countries, the relative sizes of the\nmember countries and the degree of labour mobility. Section 5 concludes.\n2 The model\n2.1 The objective functions of the member countries\nA currency union composed of two countries that are allowed to differ in size is\naddressed. Since the member countries assess the currency union with respect to, first,\nthe national welfare criteria, the objective functions of the two member countries are\nintroduced. These loss functions include the squared deviations of inflation and of\noutput from their national targets.3 In the following, the targets are the same in the loss\nfunctions of the two countries and in that of the supranational central bank below: 4\n( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n*\ny\ny\nb\nL\nt\nd\nt\nt\n-\n+\n-\n= \n( )( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n*\ny\ny\nd\nd\nb\nL a\nt\nd\nt\na\nt\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n= \nwhere\nt\nL and a\nt\nL are the losses of the domestic and foreign country, d\nt\n is the union-\nwide inflation rate (the difference of the price levels in logarithms in period t and in\nperiod t \u00ad1 ),\nt\ny ( a\nt\ny ) is the logarithm of the domestic (foreign) output level in period t,\n*\n and y* are the socially desired levels of these variables, and b (d) is the domestic\n(foreign) weighting parameter reflecting the preference of the domestic (foreign) society\nfor the output objective vis-\u00e0-vis the inflation objective with b0 and 0d1+b.\n3 In contrast to the study below, in Tarkka (1997) the common monetary policy is addressed in the light of\nan external transfer system. Thus, in the loss function, the argument of transfers is added to the arguments\nof inflation and output.\n4 Horowitz (1987) addresses the properties of the quadratic social loss function.\nIf d equals b, both countries have the same relative output preferences. If d exceeds b,\nthe foreign country is more concerned about output than the domestic country.5\n2.2 The objective function of the supranational central bank\nIt is assumed that the central-bank council consists of a central-bank board and a group\nof national central-bank presidents. For the loss in period t, the loss function of the\nsupranational central bank is the weighted sum of those of the board and of the group of\npresidents; the importance of the board vis-\u00e0-vis the national presidents is reflected by\nthe parameter k:\npres\nt\nboard\nt\ncb\nt\nL\nk\nkL\nL )\n( -\n+\nwhere k is the weight of the loss suffered by the central-bank board, board\nt\nL , and )\n( k\n-\nthat to of the losses of the national central-bank presidents, pres\nt\nL , with ]\n;\n[\n\nk .\nThe members of the central-bank board are assumed to observe the economic conditions\nof the currency area as a whole. They address the weighted sum of the losses that occur\nin the member countries and with respect to period t, we can write:6 7\n( ) ( )\n[ ] ( ) ( )\n[ ]\n[ ]\n*\n)\n(\n*\n* y\ny\nb\nb\nn\ny\ny\nb\nb\nn\nL a\nt\ncb\ny\nd\nt\ncb\nt\ncb\ny\nd\nt\ncb\nboard\nt\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n= \n\n\n\n\n\nwith )\n)(\n( d\nb\nn\nn\nbcb -\n+\n-\n+\n=\n\nand d\nn\nnb\nbcb\ny\n)\n( -\n+\n= ,\nand where cb\nb\nand cb\ny\nb are the weights the central bank attaches to the inflation and to\nthe output objectives. )\n;\n(\n\nn is the size of the home country relative to the size of\nboth countries together and )\n( n\n- is the relative size of the foreign country.8\n5 Since the conduct of monetary policy and the assessment of the monetary regimes are based on the\nnational loss functions, it is necessary to impose restrictions on the loss functions to avoid biased results\nin favour of one country. Therefore, the sum of the weights to the output and inflation objectives equals\n1 + b for each country. Thus, an increase in the parameter d not only stands for an increase in the foreign\nweight to the output objective but also for a decrease in the weight to inflation.\n6 Besides, the board may consider a loss function including the aggregate values of inflation and output of\nthe currency area.\n7 The loss faced by the board may also be interpreted as a welfare measure of the currency area as a\nwhole.\nThe weight of the data on a country in the central-bank board corresponds to the relative\neconomic size of the country, n, as the establishment of a currency union is a decision\ntaken for a long time horizon. Most probably, countries like to join a monetary union\nonly if their weights are at least as high as their relative sizes in the union.9\nThe national central-bank presidents are assumed to be interested only in their home\neconomies and try to minimise the deviations of the national economic variables from\ntheir desired targets. They have equal weight in the decision-taking regardless of the\nrelative sizes of the countries they represent:\na\nt\nt\npres\nt\nL\nL\nL\n2.3 The monetary transmission processes in the member countries and labour\nmobility\nThe transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is described by the Phillips-\ncurve relationship. The Phillips curve may be characterised by output persistence. Thus,\nwe first address the case of the absence of output persistence before we turn to the\nscenario of output persistence.\nNo output persistence\nIn the two countries the Lucas-type supply functions are given by\n( )\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\nt\ny \n\n\n +\n-\n( ) a\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\na\na\nt\ny \n\n\n +\n-\nwith\n\n c\nwhere de\nt\n is the union-wide inflation rate that is expected in period t \u00ad1 for period t,\nand t\n( a\nt\n ) is the effect of an iid supply shock with mean 0 and variance 2 ( 2\n)\n( a\n ) at\nhome (abroad).  and a\n are the domestic and foreign sacrifice ratios of variations in\n8 Dixit's country weights are chosen according to relative economic sizes and political powers (see Dixit\n9 By contrast, one may think of a situation in which one country is permanently more often affected by\nshocks then the other country may only agree with the establishment of a currency union when it is\nattributed more weight in decision taking.\nsurprise inflation to variations in output. 0\n>\nc reflects potential differences in the\nmonetary transmission processes between the domestic and foreign country.\nOutput-inflation trade-offs may differ in the two countries; this is reflected by a value of\nc that is different from 1. 1\n>\nc ) means that monetary policy abroad is less\neffective (more effective) than at home.10\nAs in Svensson (1997), the natural output levels in the two countries are the\nunconditional means of the output levels, )\n(\nt\ny\nE and )\n( a\nt\ny\nE .

To deduce the\nimplications of labour mobility for the economies and the national welfare levels it is\nnecessary to explain how the labour market is related to the goods market. It is assumed\nthat long-term output supply is accompanied by full employment. Consequently,\nnegative output-supply shocks cause unemployment while positive supply shocks result\nin excess-labour demand. Migration relieves the labour market of the country in which a\nnegative output shock occurs. Of course, if the effect of migration is positive for the\ncountry in which the negative supply shock occurs, there is a transfer of negative effects\nto the neighbouring country that has previously not suffered from output shocks. If there\n10 Dornbusch, Favero and Giavazzi (1998) attribute differences in the inflation-output trade-offs between\nthe euro-area countries to differences in wage bargaining, in particular.\n11 According to Evans and Honkapohja (2000), optimal monetary policy should not assume rational\nexpectations. The central bank should consider observed private expectations in its policy rule. In Evans's\nand Honkapohja's model, both the learning behaviour of the central bank about structural parameters and\nthe private-agents' learning behaviour are considered.\nwas full employment in the other country before, then the inflow of migrants would\ncreate unemployment provided wages were rigid.12\nIt is assumed below that the degree of labour mobility is the same in both countries. In\nthe event of labour mobility the effects of the supply shocks that the countries face after\nthe completion of the migration process are the relocated effects of the initially national\n( )\n( ) ( ) '\n'\nt\nt\nt\nn\nu\nu\nun \n\n -\n+\n-\n+\n( ) ( )\n( ) '\n'\nt\na\nt\na\nt\nun\nu\nn\nu \n\n +\n-\n+\n-\nwhere\nt\n ( a\nt\n ) is the effect of supply shocks at home (abroad) after migration has\nfinished, '\nt\n ( '\na\nt\n ) is the supply shock that initially occurs at home (abroad), and\n]\n;\n[\n\nu is the degree of labour mobility: 0\n=\nu stands for no labour mobility and 1\n=\nu\nmeans perfect labour mobility.\nIn equations (10) and (11) the parameter u reflects the degree of labour mobility. In the\ncase of perfect labour mobility (u = 1) the negative effects of the shocks that initially\noccur in one country are relocated in proportion to the relative country sizes to both\ncountries. Thus, in the absence of output persistence, the effects of labour mobility\nalready happen within the period in which the shock occurs. When there is no labour\nmobility (u = 0), then the countries are solely confronted with the shocks that arise at\nhome. The shock terms of the two equations above enter equations (6) and (7).\nOutput persistence\nAbove, it is assumed that output disequilibria in one period do not affect the output\nlevels in the successive periods. However, we often observe that a boom or a recession\n12 The issue that migration can ameliorate the situation in one country while the other country is\nnegatively affected is captured in a simulation model by Beine and Docquier (1998, p 241 f).\n13 The presentation is similar to that of Bayoumi (1994). However, Bayoumi does not consider the\nrelative sizes of the countries. In Bayoumi, the immigration of labour increases the output level in the\nregion with excess demand for labour but labour-force emigration does not affect the output level in the\ncountry that faces unemployment. Since, in his analysis, welfare depends on consumption, immigration\nincreases the welfare of the first country but the welfare of the second country is unchanged by the\nemigration of parts of the labour force.\nprevails for several periods.14 Thus, it makes sense to allow for output persistence in our\nspecification.\nThe consideration of output persistence means that we have to include the lagged output\nlevel on the right-hand side of the output-supply equations at home and abroad,\n=\nt\ny\n)\n( -\n+\n-\nt\nry\ny\nr\n( ) '\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\n\n\n\n +\n-\n=\na\nt\ny a\nt\na\na\na y\nr\ny\nr\n)\n( -\n+\n- ( ) '\na\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\na \n\n\n +\n-\nwhere r ( a\nr ) )\n;\n(\n is the degree of output persistence at home (abroad), and y ( a\ny ) is\nthe natural level of output at home (abroad).\nIn the case of labour mobility, the economy facing a shock is relieved while the other\ncountry is confronted with a spill-over effect that results in some destabilisation. Here,\nthe framework with output persistence allows us to model the occurrence of labour\nmigration with a delay and only that share of the effect of the shock which persists is\npartly spilled over to the neighbouring country by migration:\n=\nt\ny\n))\n(\n(\n))\n(\n))\n(\n(\n( -\n-\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n+\n-\nt\na y\nu\nun\nr\ny\nn\nu\nr\nu\nun\nr a\nt\na y\nn\nu\nr\n)\n( -\n-\n+\n( ) '\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\n\n\n\n +\n-\n=\na\nt\ny a\nt\na\na\na y\nu\nn\nu\nr\ny\nrun\nu\nn\nu\nr\n))\n(\n)\n(\n(\n)\n))\n(\n)\n(\n(\n(\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n+\nt\nruny\n( ) '\na\nt\nde\nt\nd\nt\na \n\n\n +\n-\nAgain, we can see that the relevance of the spill-over effects depends on the degree of\nlabour mobility, u, and the relative sizes of the two member countries, n and 1 \u00ad n. In\naddition, the degree of output persistence, r or a\nr , has an impact on the transmission of\nthe effects of the shocks to the other country.\n14 Levy and Dezhbakhsh (2003) find empirical evidence that output shock persistence varies across\ncountries.\n3 Monetary policy without output persistence\nHere, only the scenario of central-bank commitment to an optimal policy rule is\nconsidered, and as the central bank takes the formation of expectations by the private\nsector into account, no inflation bias arises. Thus, the expected loss is minimised with\nrespect to the actual and expected inflation rates. As output persistence is dropped at\nthis place, a static minimisation problem arises:16\n( )\ncb\nt\nL\nE\nde\nt\nd\nt\n\n ,\nThe first-order conditions are\n( )\n( )( )\n*\n)\n(\n.\n)\n( \n\n\n-\n-\n+\n+\n-\n+ d\nt\ncb d\nb\nk\nkb\n( ) ( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n* y\ny\nb\nn\ny\ny\nnb\nk a\nt\na\ncb\ny\nt\ncb\ny\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+ \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n*\n*\n.\n=\n+\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\nt\na\nt\na\nt\ny\ny\nd\ny\ny\nb\nk \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n*\ny\ny\nb\nn\ny\ny\nnb\nkE a\nt\na\ncb\ny\nt\ncb\ny\nt\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n*\n*\n.\n=\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n- t\na\nt\na\nt\nt\ny\ny\nd\ny\ny\nb\nE\nk \n\nwhere\n-\nt\n is the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint d\nt\nt\nde\nt\nE \n\n-\n= .\nBy inserting equation (17) into equation (18), we obtain:\n( )\n( )( )\n*\n)\n(\n.\n)\n( \n\n\n-\n-\n+\n+\n-\n+ d\nt\ncb d\nb\nk\nkb\n( ) ( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n* y\ny\nb\nn\ny\ny\nnb\nk a\nt\na\ncb\ny\nt\ncb\ny\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+ \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n*\n*\n.\ny\nd\ny\ny\nb\nk a\nt\na\nt\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+ \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n[ ]\n*\n*\ny\ny\nb\nn\ny\ny\nnb\nkE a\nt\na\ncb\ny\nt\ncb\ny\nt\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n*\n*\n.\n=\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\ny\ny\nd\ny\ny\nb\nE\nk a\nt\na\nt\nt\n\n16 The group of central-bank presidents takes decisions by the minimisation of the sum of the loss\nfunctions of the member countries.

However, output\npersistence requires the consideration of dynamic aspects by the central bank. For a\nsupranational central bank confronted with output persistence, it is no longer sufficient\nto focus solely on the welfare arising in the period in which the shock arises: it also has\nto take into account the welfare implications of both the effects of the shock and its\npolicy for the successive periods. Therefore, in this section, the central bank council\nminimises the sum of the present and time-discounted future losses. As the central bank\nmay be interested in the near future in particular, we may assume a finite time horizon\nfor its optimisation.17\nBesides, since the central bank tries to avoid an inflationary bias, monetary policy is\nsolely conducted in the period with the shock, period t. The reason is that, after period t,\nno monetary surprises are possible in equilibrium: A conflict of persisting output\ndisequilibria across the periods would affect the expectations of the private sector and,\nowing to this, would result in an inflation bias only.\nAgain, the objective function of the central- bank council is composed of that of the\ncentral-bank board and that of the group of the national central-bank presidents, who are\ninterested in the losses over a particular time horizon from periods t to T:\nT\npres\nt\nT\nboard\nt\nT\ncb\nt\nL\nk\nkL\nL ,\n,\n, )\n( -\n+\nwhere cb,T\nt\nL , T\nboard\nt\nL , and T\npres\nt\nL , are the losses faced by the central bank council, the\nboard and the group of national presidents over the time horizon from periods t to T.\nThe loss of the group of national presidents is the sum of those of the presidents who are\nattributed equal weight:\nT\na\nt\nT\nt\nT\npres\nt\nL\nL\nL ,\n, +\nwhere T\nt\nL and T\na\nt\nL , are the losses of the presidents at home and abroad for the periods t\nto T.\nThe sums of the time-discounted period losses can be written as:\n( )\n\u00e5\n-\n=\n+\n=\n, )\n(\nT\no\ni\nboard\ni\nt\ni\nboard\nT\nboard\nt\nL\ns\n( )\n\u00e5\n-\n=\n+\n=\nT\ni\ni\nt\ni\nT\nt\nL\ns\n17 There may be a link between the degree of output persistence and the time horizon addressed by the\ncentral-bank council: The more shocks persist, the more the central bank should look into the future.\n( )\n\u00e5\n-\n=\n+\n=\n, )\n(\nT\no\ni\na\ni\nt\ni\na\nT\na\nt\nL\ns\nwhere [ ]\n;\n,\n, \na\nboard s\ns\ns are the discount factors of time of the central-bank board and\nthe domestic and foreign central-bank presidents.\nThus, we can write the optimisation approach of the central-bank council in the case of\noutput persistence in the following way:\n( )\nT\ncb\nt\nL\nE\nde\nt\nd\nt\n,\n,\nmin\n\n\nAs the minimisation leads to rather complex results, the policy rules are not explicitly\ncalculated and the analysis is restricted to the simulated welfare effects below.\n5 Welfare analyses for different shock scenarios\nHere, the losses are caused by output-supply shocks at home and abroad, which lead to\ndeviations of the output level and of the inflation rate from their desirable targets; by\ncontrast, no losses occur, and the welfare is at a maximum in the absence of shocks as\nwe consider the case of central-bank commitment to an optimal policy rule. The\nexpected loss depends on the future behaviour of the shocks. Because the central bank\nconducts stabilisation policy, any assessment of the design of a currency union must\ninclude consideration of the expected indirect loss, which implies central-bank policy\nactions. This means that the optimal inflation-rate rule, which is linear in the random\nvariables, is plugged into the expected loss function, and the expected indirect loss is a\nlinear function of the variances of the output shocks at home and abroad.\nThe welfare considerations rely on the derivatives of the expected indirect loss function\nwith respect to the variance terms.18\n18 As the expected indirect loss is linear in the variances of the shocks, the effects of changes in the\nvariances on the expected loss no longer depends on the variances.\nThe analytical results are given where their level of complexity allows presentation and\ninterpretation. Otherwise, the presentation is limited to three-dimensional graphs. The\nvisualisation of the results in graphs requires the fixing of parameter values. Below, we\nfirst turn to the case of no output persistence. Here, 5\n.\n=\n=\n.\n=\nb means\nthat the central bank at home attributes half the weight of the inflation objective to the\n=\n expresses the assumed inflation-output trade-off in the home\ncountry: A 1% increase in domestic surprise inflation makes the domestic output level\nincrease by 3%.20 In the initial sections below it is assumed that the preference\nparameters of the member countries are the same ( cb\ny\nb\nd\nb =\n= ) and, additionally, that\nthe national monetary transmission processes do not differ ( d\na \n\n =\n= ). These\nassumptions are relaxed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.\nIn the scenario with output persistence more parameters have to be fixed as new ones\nare introduced. Here, we assume that the domestic country is relatively small 1\n.\n=\nn\nand the time preferences of the foreign country and the central-bank board are relatively\nlow with discount factors of 9\n.\n=\n= board\na s\ns . The time horizon contains five periods,\nthus T is set 5. This is probably a fairly realistic assumption: The central bank looks\nahead but there is a limit as, with the passage of time, new events may gain more\nrelevance than the parts of the effects that persist. Besides, the national natural output\nlevels equal zero: 0\n=\n= a\ny\ny . The other parameters are kept at the levels also assumed\nfor most of the other sections: 3\n=\n= a\n\n=\n=\n= cb\na b\nb\nb \n\n\n.\n=\n=\n= cb\na b\nb\nb .\n5.2 Welfare implications of the design of the objective function of the central\nbank (no output persistence)\nIn what follows, monetary policy is conducted by a central-bank council that may be\ncomposed of a central-bank board and a group of national presidents. Two output-shock\nscenarios are analysed: output shocks at home and negatively correlated output shocks.\nThe welfare implications are derived for no labour mobility and labour mobility.\n19 These values for the output-preference parameters are also chosen by Aksoy, de Grauwe and\nDewachter (2002) in their euro-area simulation model. Broadbent and Barro (1997) found this to be\nOutput shocks in the home country\na) Variations in the expected loss of the central bank without labour mobility\nThese variations are presented by equations (29) and (30) and by Figure 1.\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt n\nVar\nL\nE\n\n)\n)\n(\n(\n.\n\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nb\nn\nk\nb\nbk\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt k\nVar\nL\nE\n\n)\n)(\n)\n(\n(\n.\n\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nb\nn\nn\nk\nb\nIf the central-bank council is composed of only national central-bank presidents, 0\n=\nk ,\nthe expected loss of the central bank is highest. Since each national president has the\nsame voting power in the monetary-policy-decision process, differences in the relative\nsizes of the member countries are not reflected in the monetary-stabilisation policy of\nthe group of national presidents. Provided the two countries have the same size, the\nobjective function of the board equals that of the group of national presidents, and the\nboard and the group of national presidents take the same monetary-policy decisions. If\nthe countries differ in size, however, the board considers the relative economic\nimportance of the member countries with respect to the currency area as a whole, and\nthe expected loss of the board and, with it, that of the central-bank council are reduced.\nProvided the home country is the small country, the expected loss of the board, 1\n=\nk , is\nlow as a result of the low relevance of the home country and its output shock. If the\n3% increase in the output level and a 1 percentage point reduction in the unemployment rate.

This is not the case in the central-bank board. Thus, the small\ncountry favours central-bank policy conducted by the group of national presidents. The\npreference of the large country is the opposite. This issue is illustrated by Figure 2,\nwhich presents the expected loss of the home country:\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\ncb\nt\nt\nt n\nVar\nL\nE\n\n)\n(\n.\n+\n-\n+\n-\n\n\nb\nkn\nk\nk\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\ncb\nt\nt\nt k\nVar\nL\nE\n\n)\n)(\n(\n.\n+\n-\n+\n-\n\n\nb\nkn\nk\nn\nc) Variations in the expected losses of the central bank and of the home country with\nlabour mobility\nHere, again, the relative size of the country hit by shocks plays a part since it reflects\nhow relevant the shocks affect the currency area as a whole (see equation (33) and\nFigure 3).

Then, since the stabilisation of the economy of\none country is accompanied by a further destabilisation of the other and since the\nconcerns of the two countries play the same role in the monetary decision-making\nprocess, the optimum course for the central-bank board and for the group of national\ncentral-bank presidents is to conduct no stabilisation policy. If the two countries differ\nin size, the central-bank board concentrates on the concerns of the larger country. In this\nway the loss of the central-bank board can be reduced.\nb) Variations in the expected loss of the home country without labour mobility\nHowever, Figure 5 shows that, under negatively correlated output shocks, as in cases\nwhere output shocks occur solely in one member country, the expected loss of a small\nmember country is smaller the greater the weight of the group of national central-bank\npresidents in the decision-making process. If the monetary decisions are taken by the\nboard, the maximum loss of a small country is larger than in the case of output shocks\nlimited to one country since the small country is not only negatively affected by the\neffects of the shocks at home but also by central-bank policy that focuses on the\ncontrasting stabilisation interests of the large neighbouring country (see equations (37)\n,\n'\n'\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\n=\n-\n,\n'\n'\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\ncb\nt\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nn\nVar\nL\nE\n\n\n\n)\n(\n\n+\n-\n+\n-\n\n\nb\nkn\nk\nk\nb\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\n=\n-\n=\n-\n,\n'\n'\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\nu\ncb\nt\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nk\nVar\nL\nE\n\n\n\n)\n)(\n(\n\n+\n-\n+\n-\n\n\nb\nkn\nk\nn\nb\nc) Variations in the expected losses of the central bank and of the home country with\nlabour mobility\nUnder labour mobility, as in the scenarios characterised by the incidence of shocks in\none of the member countries, it does not matter if the central-bank board or the national\npresidents take the monetary policy decisions. Both groups in the central-bank council\nhave the same interests and would like to conduct the same monetary policies. If the\ntwo countries differ in size, the effects of the shock originating in the larger country also\ndominate the economic conditions in the smaller country. This means, for example, that,\nif there is a negative output shock in the large country while the small country is hit by a\npositive output shock, migration not only provides the workers needed by the small\ncountry to stabilise its economy but also that labour forces immigrate into the small\ncountry as long as the unemployment rates differ between the two countries.

However, as introduced in Section 2.3, in the two member countries of the\ncurrency union, the impact of monetary policy on the output levels may be different. If,\nin equation (8), c is greater (less) than one, the monetary transmission coefficient is\nlarger (smaller) abroad than that at home, ie a\n\n )\n(>\n< , and monetary policy abroad is\nmore (less) efficient than at home.21\nSince, in this section, the monetary transmission coefficient is allowed to change and\nsince we continue to present the results in three-dimensional graphs, one parameter that\nhas been free until now has to be fixed. Thus, consideration of the composition of the\ncentral-bank council is limited to the two extremes in the following: a central-bank\ncouncil that consists entirely of a central-bank board and a central-bank council that is\nformed entirely of national central-bank presidents.\nOwing to the complexity of the analytical results, only the graphical presentation of the\nresults is provided.\n21 Here, the parameter c is restricted to the interval c  [0.5; 2].\n,\n'\n'\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n\n\nOutput shocks in the home country\na) Variations in the expected loss of the central bank without labour mobility\nFigure 7 shows the expected loss of the central-bank board if the monetary decisions are\ntaken by the board itself. In Figure 8, by contrast, the expected loss of the group of\nnational presidents is presented for the case where monetary policy is determined solely\nby the group of national presidents.\nWe see that the expected losses of the two types of central-bank council increase in the\ninflation-output trade-off parameter abroad, c. The stabilisation of the domestic\neconomy, which is hit by output shocks, is at the expense of some destabilisation of the\nforeign economy. The higher the trade-off parameter abroad, the more costly is\nstabilisation of the home economy. In the end an increase in c is accompanied by less\ncentral-bank stabilisation policy and a greater expected loss by the central bank.\nb) Variations in the expected loss of the home country without labour mobility\nIn Figures 9 and 10 it can be seen that the expected loss of the home country increases\nin the foreign inflation-output trade-off parameter. Then, the central bank reduces its\nefforts to stabilise the domestic economy since the cost of this policy, the destabilisation\nof the foreign country, increases.

This is valid both in the case of a central-bank council composed of a\ncentral-bank board and in the case of monetary policy decisions taken by the group of\nnational presidents (see Figures 13 and 14). Then, the conduct of monetary policy is\noptimal with respect to the home country.\n5.4 Welfare implications of different output preferences in the member countries\n(no output persistence)\nIn this section we investigate differences in the output and inflation preferences of the\nmember countries of a currency union. In its loss function, the foreign country may\nattach more or less weight to the output objective than the home country, d\nb < or\nd\nb > in equations (1) and (2). These national differences affect the decisions of the\nsupranational central-bank council since the national loss functions are fundamental to\nthe central-bank objective function. The preference parameters in the loss function of\nthe central-bank board are the country-size-weighted sums of the preference parameters\nof the two member countries. Besides this, the national central-bank presidents consider\nthe loss functions of their home countries, which include the national preference\nparameters. As in the section above, output shocks at home are investigated, and\nmonetary decisions are taken either by the central-bank board or by the group of\nnational central-bank presidents.\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\nOutput shocks in the home country\na) Variations in the expected loss of the central bank without labour mobility\nThe expected losses of the central-bank board (see Figure 15) and of the group of\nnational presidents (see Figure 16) are greater the higher the foreign preference for the\noutput objective. This issue is especially relevant to the central-bank board if the foreign\ncountry is relatively large, which means that n is relatively small.\nThe conduct of stabilisation policy with respect to the domestic economy hit by shocks\nis at the expense of some destabilisation of the foreign economy. Although an increase\nin the foreign output-preference parameter is accompanied by a decrease in the inflation\npreference abroad, the shift in the weighting of the preference parameters results in a\nlarger expected loss in the foreign country and, consequently, in a larger expected loss\nby the central bank.\nb) Variations in the expected loss of the home country without labour mobility\nIf the central-bank board takes monetary decisions (see Figure 17), the expected\ndomestic loss is smaller the higher the output preference abroad. This outcome does not\ncome as a surprise since, in the case of a higher output preference abroad, the output\npreference of the central-bank board, which is the relative size-weighted sum of the\noutput-preference parameters of the member countries, is also higher. Thus, the board\nincreases its efforts to stabilise the domestic economy hit by output shocks even though\nthe deviations from the targets abroad increase. The result differs if the group of\nnational presidents takes the monetary decisions (see Figure 18). Here, the higher output\n,\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\npreference of the foreign central-bank president results in a larger expected loss in the\nhome country. The higher the output preference abroad, the larger the expected loss of\nthe foreign country due to some destabilisation of its economy, and therefore the group\nof national presidents decides to conduct less stabilisation policy with respect to the\ndomestic economy.\nc) Variations in the expected loss of the central bank with labour mobility\nUnder labour mobility, the foreign country is also directly affected by the shocks\noriginating at home. In this case, both the expected loss of the board and the expected\nloss of the group of national presidents first increase before they decrease in a higher\noutput preference of the foreign country (see Figures 19 and 20). First, an increase in\nthe output preference abroad is accompanied by higher losses as this makes the board\nand the foreign central-bank president suffer more from deviations from the output\ntargets. Afterwards, a further increase in d leads to a decrease in the expected losses of\nthe two types of central-bank council owing to the greater stabilisation efforts of the\ncentral bank with respect to both economies while the further increase in the losses\ncaused by larger deviations from the inflation target is relatively moderate.\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\nd) Variations in the expected loss of the home country with labour mobility\nIn Figures 21 and 22 below we can see that, with both the decisions of a central-bank\nboard and of a group of national central-bank presidents, the expected losses of the\nhome country decrease if the output preference abroad increases. This is due to the\nincrease in the efforts of the central bank with respect to the stabilisation of the two\neconomies and due to the constant output preference abroad.\n5.5 Welfare implications of output persistence\nIn the sections above, we were able see the clear result that a small country is best off\nwhen the central bank decisions are taken by the group of national presidents. Now, the\nquestion arises as to whether this result is preserved under output persistence.\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\n,\nmin\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n\n\nk\nu\nt\ncb\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\n\nIn the figures below, we look at the small domestic country in the case of output shocks\nat home and in the case of negatively correlated output shocks across the two countries.\nAs we address the relative attractiveness of the monetary decisions taken by the group\nof national presidents vis-\u00e0-vis those of the central-bank board and as the figures with\nthe losses may not deviate much from each other, we here choose the figures that\ndisplay the differences between the domestic losses arising for the two types of central-\nbank councils. In the figures below, a negative value indicates that the policy through\nthe national presidents is more favourable to the small domestic country.\nOutput shocks in the home country\nFirst, we look at the difference in the sum of the domestic losses for the decisions of the\ntwo types of central-bank councils over the five periods of concern. In Figure 23, this is\ndone for shocks at home in the case of labour mobility.\nAs revealed by the negative values on the vertical axis, here the small domestic country\nis better off if monetary policy is conducted by the group of national central-bank\npresidents. We can see that the attractiveness of decisions by the national presidents\ndecreases with an increase in output persistence and with an increase in the discount\nfactor of time at home, s. The higher the output persistence and thus labour migration,\nthe more the country is affected by spill-over effects in the successive periods: On the\none hand, it is relieved by the spill over of parts of the effects of the domestic shock that\npersist. On the other hand, it suffers from effects transmitted from the large economy.\nThe large country is in disequilibrium as it is, to some extent, destabilised in period t by\nthe monetary policy that is conducted with respect to the small domestic country. Thus,\nthe international linkages make the national economic situations and, by extension, the\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\ninterests of the national presidents and the board approach each other. Moreover, the\ngreater domestic weight on future losses expressed by a higher discount factor s is\naccompanied by stronger emphasis on the spill-over effects from and to the foreign\ncountry. This also makes the policy proposals of the board and the group of national\npresidents more similar.\nWhen we consider this shock scenario in the absence of labour mobility, the policy\ndecisions taken by the group of national central-bank presidents are again more\nadvantageous to the small domestic country than are those of the board. However, here\nthe discrepancies between the sums of the domestic losses under decisions of the\nnational presidents and of the board are more pronounced, the higher the degree of\noutput persistence is and the higher the weight on future losses at home. The reason for\nthis is that the monetary policy of the board, which focuses on the concerns of the large\nforeign country, leads to the stabilisation efforts desired by the small domestic country\nto a smaller extent than is the case for the monetary policy of the group of national\npresidents. This is attributed to the fact that the board puts the potential accompanying\ndestabilisation of the large country in first place by design. The situation for the small\ndomestic country becomes even worse with output persistence. Then, the disequilibrium\nat home would be maintained over some periods. By a higher weight on the future\ndomestic losses, a higher s, the persisting disequilibria gain importance for the small\ndomestic country, which also results in a larger difference between decisions of the\ngroup of national presidents and the board owing to the different stabilisation efforts\nwith respect to the small country.\nLast, the differences in the losses of the domestic country suffered just in period t + 1\nfor labour mobility are considered (see Figure 25). Again, monetary-policy decisions\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\nconsider a time horizon of five periods. By the positive values on the vertical axis, we\ncan see here that decisions taken by the central-bank board are preferable for the small\ncountry. Thus, while the sum of the domestic losses over five periods is higher for board\ndecisions, the board decision reduces the expected loss in period t + 1.\nAs the board attaches great importance to the concerns of the large foreign country, it\npays much attention to the avoidance of high destabilisation of the foreign country in\nperiod t. By doing this, the spill-over effects from the large foreign country to the small\ndomestic country via labour migration in the successive periods are reduced. By\ncontrast, the group of national presidents focuses on the stabilisation of the domestic\ncountry in period t to a greater extent and therefore allows higher negative spill-over\neffects from abroad in the following periods. The successive spill-over effects are\nneglected more by the group of presidents, the smaller is the discount factor of time of\nthe domestic national president, s.\nBy contrast, in the absence of labour mobility, no spill-over effects arise in the\nfollowing periods and the small domestic country has no incentive to consider the\nimpact of the monetary policy decisions on the other country. As only the small\ndomestic country is negatively affected by the output shock, it prefers a strong position\nof the group of national presidents in decision-taking. The higher the output persistence\nis, the more it is affected by disequilibria in the future as well, which increases its desire\nfor decisions by the group of presidents, which gives greater consideration to the small\ncountry. The same applies if the small country places greater weight on the welfare of\nthe future periods, a higher s.\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n+\n-\n=\n+\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nk\nt\nt\nk\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\nNegatively correlated output shocks\nAgain, we first concentrate on the difference between the time-discounted sums of the\nlosses of the domestic country for monetary policies conducted by the group of national\npresidents and by the central-bank board. As above, we can see that, for the scenarios of\nnegatively correlated output shocks and labour mobility, the more output persistence\nexists, the less the decisions are dependent on the composition of the central-bank\ncouncil. Output persistence in conjunction with labour mobility is accompanied by\ninternational spill-over effects that make the member countries suffer in a more similar\nway and thus, their policy interests approach each other. Besides, the difference in the\nsums of the losses decreases with an increase in the time-discount factor of the domestic\ncountry. As a low discount factor implies a relatively strong weight on the current\nperiod and the near future and as in period t, one country suffers a negative output shock\nwhile the other is hit by a positive one, which implies conflicting policy needs: a small\ncountry that concentrates on the current period and neglects the spill-over effects in the\nsuccessive periods has a strong preference for decisions by the group of national\npresidents, which provides it with more voting power.\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n+\n-\n=\n+\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nk\nt\nt\nk\nt\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\n,\n'\n'\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\n\n\nFor negatively correlated output shocks and the absence of labour mobility, there is no\nstabilisation mechanism beside monetary policy that moderates the divergent policy\nneeds over time. Thus, the small country favours a monetary policy conducted by the\ngroup of national presidents, where its concerns have more relevance, and the\npreferences increases with the time-discount factor and the degree of output persistence\nNext, in Figure 29, we turn to the loss suffered by the small domestic country just in\nperiod t + 1 in the case of labour mobility. Output persistence means that the effects of\nthe shocks last over periods and thus, welfare losses arise in period t + 1. Here, policy\ndecisions through the board reduce the loss suffered at home in period t + 1. Since the\nboard concentrates its policy measures on the large other country, it combats, in\nparticular, the effects of the shock that initially occurs abroad. The shock abroad also\ndominates the small domestic economy over their spill-over effects in the following\nperiods.\nBy contrast, if the labour forces cannot migrate, the small country would be affected by\nunfavourable policy decisions of the board not only in period t but, owing to output\n,\n'\n'\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nT\nk\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\n\n\n,\n'\n'\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n=\n+\n-\n=\n+\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nk\nt\nt\nk\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\n\n\npersistence, the economy would destabilised in the successive periods, too. Moreover,\nthe higher the time-discount factor of the domestic country is, the more it would like to\nopt for decisions taken by the group of national presidents (see Figure 30).\n6 Conclusions\nThe welfare implications of the design of a monetary union have been deduced under\ndifferent output-shock scenarios. First, the aspect of output persistence is left aside and\nwe begin by turning to a central-bank council consisting of both a central-bank board\nand a group of national central-bank presidents, where the national presidents are\nassumed to be interested only in their home economies. For all output-shock scenarios\nin the absence of labour mobility, the expected loss of the central-bank council is\ngreatest in two cases. First, the loss is maximised if the two member countries of the\ncurrency union are of the same size and this is independent from the composition of the\ncouncil. Then, little policy action is taken by the central bank. Second, in the case of a\ncentral-bank council composed solely of a group of national presidents, again little\nstabilisation policy is conducted owing to the equal weighting of the welfare of the two\ncountries in the central-bank loss function. Next, in all output-shock scenarios, a small\ncountry prefers decisions to be taken by a group of national presidents while a large\ncountry favours monetary-policy decisions to be taken by the central-bank board. The\nsmall country opts for a strong position for the group of national presidents in the\ncentral-bank council since the more important the group of national presidents the more\nimpact the small country has on the monetary decision process. In the case of the board\nthe greater importance of the large country to the currency union as a whole is reflected\nin its large weight in the monetary decision-taking process.\n,\n'\n'\n,\n,\n))\n'\n(\n(\n)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n=\n+\n-\n=\n+\n-\n\n-\n\nu\nt\nk\nt\nt\nk\nt\nt\nt\na\nt\nVar\nL\nE\nL\nE\n\n\n\nThe analysis above reveals that the composition of the central-bank council is the less\nrelevant to the member countries the higher the degree of labour mobility. An increase\nin the degree of labour mobility makes the differences in the adequate stabilisation\npolicies between the countries vanish. Under perfect labour mobility, and with the same\nnational monetary transmission processes and relative output preferences, the central-\nbank board and the national central-bank presidents agree on their favoured policy\nactions. But the relative size of the country in which the shock originates is still relevant\nto the expected losses in the member countries. If the shock occurs in the large country,\nowing to migration, it strongly affects the economies of the currency area. In the case of\nnegatively correlated output shocks, the expected losses of the countries are the lower\nthe more similar the two countries are in size. According to Bayoumi (1994), perfect\nlabour mobility even prevents the output costs associated with the formation of a\ncurrency union.\nIn addition, the analysis considers differences in the national monetary transmission\nprocesses. In the case of output shocks originating in one country and the absence of\nlabour mobility, the central-bank board and the group of national presidents are\nconfronted with lower expected losses if the monetary transmission process is more\nefficient in the country in which the shock occurs. If perfect labour mobility is assumed,\nthe central-bank board and the group of national central-bank presidents suffer low\nlosses if the monetary transmission coefficients in both countries are high and if they\ndeviate somewhat. By contrast, the member countries of a currency union are best off\nwhen their transmission coefficients are high and equal each other. Thus, the model\nabove could show the relationships verbally described by Dornbusch, Favero and\nGiavazzi (1998, p 22): A supranational central bank that cares about the aggregate\nvariables of the currency area responds all the more to country-specific shocks the more\nimportant the country of origin, the lower the impact of the union-wide monetary policy\non the economy of this country and the less the economy of the other country is affected\nby the monetary policy actions.\nNext, we return to equal national transmission processes and bring to the fore the\ndifferent relative output preferences of the member countries. In the absence of labour\nmobility, the expected losses of both types of central-bank council increase with a\nhigher weight to the output objective abroad. Provided monetary decisions are taken by\na group of national presidents, with a higher output preference, a country benefits from\nthe central bank's greater stabilisation efforts to respond to its concerns or from the\nlesser degree of stabilisation policy with respect to the neighbouring country. Under\nperfect labour mobility, and output shocks in one member country, the central-bank\nboard and the group of national presidents first face larger expected losses before a\nfurther increase in one country's output preference makes the losses decrease again. The\nlosses of the countries decrease if one country increases its output preference.\nIn the final section, output persistence is introduced. The investigation is done for a\nrelatively small domestic country when output shocks occur at home and when there are\nnegatively correlated shocks in both countries. For a time horizon of the central bank\nand of the two countries of five periods, a small country is again better off with respect\nto this time horizon if the decisions are taken by the group of national central-bank\npresidents. With labour mobility that is linked to output persistence in this section, the\ncomposition of the central-bank council becomes less relevant for the small domestic\ncountry, the higher the degree of output persistence is and the higher the time-discount\nfactor at home. Then, the economic situation of the large foreign country plays a great\npart for both countries and the policy proposals of the board and of the group of national\npresidents approach each other. Here, it has to be taken into account that stabilisation\npolicy with respect to the small domestic country is accompanied by persuasive effects\non the foreign economy. With the international spill-over effects in the case of output\npersistence and labour mobility, these effects become relevant to the small domestic\ncountry. If we just take the period after the shock, decisions of the board are even\npreferable for the small country owing to the major importance of transmitted effects\nfrom the foreign country to the small domestic country. However, in the absence of\nlabour mobility, for more output persistence and a higher time-discount factor, the\neconomic situation at home is aggravated if the decisions are taken by the board; the\ndomestic country is then unconcerned about spill-over effects in the successive periods\nand does not welcome stabilisation measures with respect to the large foreign country.\nThus, the optimum design of a central bank with respect to the member countries of the\ncurrency union depends on a variety of aspects. Since these aspects may vary over time,\nthe optimum constitution of a monetary union should allow for amendments (see also von\nHayen and S\u00fcppel (1994)). Besides, a change in shock behaviour or in the correlation of\nnational business cycles can be caused by a currency-regime shift. Thus, these criteria/scen-\narios do not have to be exogenous to the analysis (see Frankel and Rose (1997 and 1998)).\nReferences\nAksoy, Yunus; de Grauwe, Paul and Dewachter, Hans: Do Asymmetries Matter for\nEuropean Monetary Policy?, in: The European Economic Review, Vol 46, 2002, pp\nBarro, Robert and Gordon, David: A Positive Theory of Monetary Policy in a Natural\nBayoumi, Tamim: A Formal Model of Optimum Currency Areas, in: IMF Staff Papers,\nBeine, Michel and Docquier, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric: A Stochastic Simulation Model of an Optimum\nBroadbent, Ben and Barro, Robert J.: Central Bank Preferences and Macroeconomic\nBuiter, Willem H.: The EMU and the NAMU: What is the Case for North American\nClarida, Richard and Gertler, Mark: How the Bundesbank Conducts Monetary Policy,\nDe Grauwe: Monetary Policies in the Presence of Asymmetries, in: Journal of Common\nDixit, Avinash: Games of Monetary and Fiscal Interactions in the EMU, in: European\nDornbusch, Rudiger; Favero, Carlo and Giavazzi, Francesco: The Immediate\nChallenges for the European Central Bank, in: NBER Working Papers Series,\nECB: Statistics Pocket Book, Frankfurt am Main, July 2004\nEvans, George W. and Honkapohja, Seppo: Expectations and the Stability Problem for\nOptimal Monetary Policies, in: Discussion Paper of the Economic Research\nFrankel, Jeffrey A and Rose, Andrew K: Is EMU more Justifiable ex post than ex ante?,\nFrankel, Jeffrey A and Rose, Andrew K: The Endogeneity of the Optimal Currency Area\nFrey, Rainer: Flexible Exchange Rates, Fixed Exchange Rates, or a Currency Union?
