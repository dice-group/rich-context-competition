Thus, the previously reported serum 25(OH)D\nconcentrations and prevalence of low vitamin D status using the\nunadjusted serum 25(OH)D data were inadvertently either over-\nor underestimated (3\u00ad6).\nA serum 25(OH)D concentration is a widely used marker of\nvitamin D status, because it is considered to be a reasonable\nreflection of total body exposure to vitamin D. At this time, the\nserum 25(OH)D measurement is the best estimator of vitamin D\nstatus. Circulating 25(OH)D represents both endogenous vitamin\nD synthesis in the skin upon exposure to UV-B light and dietary\nintake of limited foods containing vitamin D. Serum 25(OH)D is\ninfluenced by several other factors such as sex, age, race, behavior,\noutdoor activity, adiposity, and geographical location (1, 7, 8). The\nrole of vitamin D in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis is well\nknown (8). Recently, there has been considerable interest in the\npossibility of an expanded role for vitamin D in various infirmities\nsuch as depression (9), autoimmune disease (10), metabolic\ncancer (21,22). However, strong evidence is lacking for outcomes\nbeyond bone health (23).\nThere is no consensus for what is considered an appropriate\ncutoff for optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Different cut\npoints have been used to define hypovitaminosis D, resulting in\ndifferent prevalences of hypovitaminosis D being reported. The\nprevalence of hypovitaminosis D has been reported to range from\n1 Author disclosures: V. Ganji, X. Zhang, and V.

In this study, we\nreport: 1) the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D using for various\ncutoffs for serum 25(OH)D values, including optimal concen-\ntration recommended by the IOM; 2) differences in mean serum\n25(OH)D and the change in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D\nvarious subset populations, including children, adolescents, and\nolder adults; 3) the geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concen-\nbecause the data were skewed; and 4) the serum 25(OH)D from\nin order to increase the precision of the serum 25(OH)D estimate\ndue to a larger sample size. The overall aim of this study was to\ninvestigate changes in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations and\nthe prevalence of hypovitaminosis D over time using the recently\nvarious demographic characteristics of the U.S. population.\nBecause there has been no universal consensus on the optimal\nconcentrations for serum 25(OH)D for estimating prevalence of\nhypovitaminosis D, we present several cut points for the purpose\nof comparison and clarity in this report.\nMethods\nDescription of surveys. The NCHS conducts large, nationally repre-\nsentative, sample surveys known as NHANES on the civilian, noninsti-\ntutionalized U.S. population, using a stratified, multistage, probability\nsample survey design. Data on demographic characteristics, diet, and\nhealth were collected from personal interviews. Physical examinations\nand collection of blood and urine samples are performed in a MEC.\nCertain groups such as low-income persons, adolescents, persons $60 y\nold, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics/Mexican Americans were\noversampled to yield reliable estimates for these groups. The NHANES\nprotocols were reviewed and approved by the NCHS Institutional\nReview Board. All survey participants signed informed consent before\nparticipating in NHANES.\nBeginning 1999, NHANES were conducted as annual surveys and\ndata are released in 2-y cycles for public use. Prior to 1999, NHANES\nthis study, we used publically available data from 4 surveys: NHANES\nsurvey methodologies and analytic guidelines was previously reported\nexamined in MEC, and 493 were examined in their home, because\nindividuals (all were home-interviewed; 10,477 were examined in\nfor the household interview component and 78% for the examination\ncomponent, whereas the survey response rates for the examination\nPeriodically, NHANES data files are updated by the NCHS, re-\nplacing previous data files. One such update occurred very recently in\ndrifts in serum 25(OH)D assay over time. Based on the quality control\nanalysis conducted on surplus sera, the CDC observed shifts in the\nmeans of serum 25(OH)D concentrations over a period of time for\nserum 25(OH)D was most likely due to method variation that resulted\nfrom reagent and calibration lot-to-lot variation. Also, the NCHS\nresults to the level of the reformulated assay used in NHANES 2000\u00ad\n2006.

However, these data are not\navailable publically because of a disclosure risk of confidential informa-\ntion. Thus, we were unable to include serum 25(OH)D data from the\n,12 y old.

Of the remaining\nvalues for serum 25(OH)D, BMI, and supplement use, respectively.\nconsisted of 23,424 persons (representative of the U.S. population,\nSeveral variables that are known to affect serum 25(OH)D concen-\ntrations were included in the data analysis (1,7,8) . These were sex, race-\nethnicity, age, PIR, season of examination, use of supplements, and BMI.\nthe serum 25(OH)D concentration was not measured in children ,12 y\nage. Race-ethnicity was self-reported as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Hispanic/Mexican, and others. The \"other\" category\nincluded persons of mixed race-ethnicity and persons who reported their\nrace-ethnicity as other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nand Hispanic/Mexican. PIR is the ratio of income to the family's\nappropriate poverty threshold (33). PIR values were categorized as\nbelow poverty (,1.0), middle income (1.0\u00ad3.0), and higher income\n(.3.0). Persons who had missing data for the PIR was categorized as\n\"not reported.\" To avoid damage to MEC, in all NHANES, data were\ncollected during summer (May 1\u00adOctober 31) in the North and winter\n(November 1\u00adApril 30) in the South. BMI was categorized into quintiles,\nbecause this classification yielded relatively uniform sample sizes across\nthe quintiles.\nTo explore the possible causes for change in vitamin D status from\nconsumption, and physical activity, because these variables are known\nto affect vitamin D status (1). Because BMI is inversely related to vitamin\nD status (34), we used BMI as a modifier of serum 25(OH)D. BMI was\ncalculated based on weight and height measurements. Because milk is a\ncommonly consumed vitamin D-fortified food and because physical\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nactivity may be a surrogate marker of outdoor activity and sun exposure,\nwe used these two variables as potential modifiers of serum 25(OH)D\nused milk consumption as a surrogate marker for dietary vitamin D\nintake. The detailed description of dietary intake methodology was\ndescribed elsewhere (1). In the data analysis, persons who consumed\nmilk at least 1 time/d were regarded as milk drinkers. Milk consumption\nincluded all milks (whole, 2%, 1%, nonfat, and chocolate) and milk used\nwith cereal. Participants self-reported their physical activity compared\nwith their peers of same age and sex. Data were recorded as more, less,\nand same. In this study, we used proportion of people who reported that\ntheir physical activity was \"more\" than the others of the same age and\nsex as a marker of physical activity.\nDescription of vitamin D measurement.

We looked to see\nwhether this decline in hypovitaminosis D remains consistent with\nthese assay-adjusted serum 25(OH)D data reported here for\nvarious subsets of the U.S. population. Previously, using two cycles\nprevalence of hypovitaminosis D [serum 25(OH)D ,25 nmol/L]\naccount, we report, based on a cut point of serum 25(OH)D ,25\nnmol/L, an increase in the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D of ;1\noverall prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (serum 25(OH)D ,25\nnmol/L) was overestimated by 1-fold in Ginde et al.'s (3) study.\nAlso, use of unadjusted vitamin D data from NHANES 1988\u00ad\n1994 overestimated the prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency as\nstudy vs. 45% in Ginde et al.'s (3) study] (data not shown). Thus,\nthe decline in vitamin D status remains, but that is not as dramatic\nas in previous reports using unadjusted serum 25(OH)D data.\nMost recently, the IOM of the National Academies issued\nDRI for vitamin D. The IOM reported that the risk of rickets,\nfractures, and other skeletal abnormalities is higher in persons\nwith a serum 25(OH)D concentration ,30 nmol/L. The IOM\nestimated that a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 40 nmol/L\nwas the target for a median dietary requirement for children and\nadults.

The\nIOM proposed that an intake of vitamin D of 600 IU/d achieves a\nserum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L under the condi-\ntions of minimum sun exposure. Therefore, the IOM set this\nintake level for vitamin D as the RDA (23).\nIn our study, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L\nis almost one-third (;32%) of the U.S. population (NHANES\nFIGURE 3 Percent increase in the\nprevalence of hypovitaminosis D from\nPIR, season of examination, supple-\nment use, and BMI for serum 25(OH)\nD concentration of ,25 nmol/L and\nprevalence estimates that are signifi-\ncant between 2 survey periods.

A potential explanation for this is increased\nprevalence of overweight and obesity in the U.S.. In this study,\nwe confirm that the mean population BMI significantly in-\nthat vitamin D is sequestered in adipose tissue, making it less\navailable (44). Additionally, overweight and obese children\ngenerally engage in less outdoor activity, leading to less exposure\nto UV-B radiation (44). We further explored whether the changes\nin vitamin D status was due to declining milk consumption in the\nU.S.. Surprisingly, we found that milk consumption did not\ndecrease in all subpopulations studied.

(1) reported that sun protection was one of\nthe contributing factors for declining vitamin D status in the U.S.\npopulation in the past 10\u00ad15 y. We are unable to ascertain\nwhether increased sun protection behavior is a potential\nexplanation for decreased vitamin D status due to lack of data\nIn conclusion, this study presents the most accurate preva-\nlence estimates for hypovitaminosis D using the newly assay-\nadjusted serum 25(OH)D for a variety of cut points to define\nhypovitaminosis D (3\u00ad6). To date, this is the most comprehensive\nstudy that reports the changes in vitamin D status in various\nsubsets of the U.S. population. Our intent in this study is not to\nendorse any one specific serum 25(OH)D cut point in defining\nhypovitaminosis D but rather to present data for various serum\n25(OH)D cut points for comparison and highlight the impact of\nthe assay adjustment on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.\nDue to lack of consensus over the optimal serum 25(OH)D\nconcentration, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D varies by the\ncut point of serum 25(OH)D. Due to the cross-sectional nature of\nthe data, the results of this study should not be viewed in terms of a\ncause and effect relationship. Although the vitamin D status\ndramatic as originally reported using unadjusted serum 25(OH)D\ndata. Given the widespread prevalence of hypovitaminosis D, the\nlifestyle changes leading to decreased exposure of UV-B radiation\nfrom sunlight, and the limited presence of vitamin D in foods,\nconsideration should be given for supplementation of vitamin D\nand/or targeted fortification of foods with vitamin D for popula-\ntions who are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency.\n"
