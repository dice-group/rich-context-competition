The \"confirmed PA group\" included APA patients and patients from the possible PA\ngroup showing both high ARR and hypokalemia. One case was diagnosed as a metastasis.\nResults: Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of ACTH test was not\nvery effective in differentiating between APA patients and possible PA and non-PA patients. The optimal cut-off value\nof maximal plasma aldosterone concentration for differentiating between patient in the confirmed PA group and other\npatients showed moderate accuracy.\nConclusions: The ACTH test may not be useful as a screening or confirmatory test, but the test may be useful for\ndifferentiating between patients with confirmed PA and the rest of the cohort. The positive finding of the ACTH test\nmay at least support a higher likelihood of lateralizing on adrenal venous sampling.\n",

A\nconclusive diagnosis of PA is based on at least one positive\ntest result.3 The Japan Endocrine Society and the Japanese\nSociety of Hypertension each have guidelines for the diag-\nnosis of PA, both proposing the use of the same three\nconfirmatory tests (CCT, SIT, and FUT).

They\nreported that a cut-off value of maximal plasma aldoster-\none concentration (Max PAC, ng/dl) to cortisol ratio of\n0.85 or greater was useful for the diagnosis of PA.8\nSubsequently, the ACTH stimulation test has been exten-\nsively used for the diagnosis of PA in Japan. The test is\nroutine in our hospital. Nevertheless, no validation study\nhas been performed thus far, and the diagnostic power of\nthe ACTH stimulation test remains generally unknown.\nThe present study aimed to examine whether theACTH\nstimulation test shows the same diagnostic power as other\nconfirmatory tests between PA patients and non-PA hyper-\ntensive patients and whether the test is useful in the diag-\nnosis of APA in patients with suspected PA. To address\nthis hypothesis, we determined the best cut-off value to\nevaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the ACTH stimulation\ntest in patients with PA and those with APA.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nWe retrospectively analyzed hypertensive patients with\nelevated ARR (>20; PAC in ng/dl and plasma renin activ-\nity (PRA) in ng/ml/h) (n=158) who were admitted to the\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Infectious\nDiseases of Hirosaki University School of Medicine and\nregistered as an institutional case-notes review at the\nInstitutional Review Board of Hirosaki University School\nBefore the determination of ARR, mineralocorticoid\nreceptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers,\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or angio-\ntensin receptor blockers were withheld for at least two\nweeks. Only calcium channel blockers and/or alpha-\nadrenergic blockers were used as antihypertensive therapy.\nAccording to the Japanese guidelines, all of the patients\nunderwent at least two of the three confirmatory tests for\nthe diagnosis of PA (CCT, SIT, or FUT) on different days.\nOverall, 73 patients had at least two positive test\nresults and 66 had only one positive test result, while 19\nhad negative results for all two or three tests (non-PA\ngroup). Of the 73 patients with two positive test results,\n60 underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS), while the\nremaining 13 did not undergo AVS because they opted\nagainst surgery. Of the 66 patients with one positive test\nresult, 35 desired and underwent AVS. Finally, 38 patients\nwere diagnosed by AVS with a unilateral adrenal lesion,\nand all of these patients underwent surgical treatment.\nFurther, 57 patients were diagnosed with bilateral adrenal\nlesions. Because of the presence of a large adrenal tumor,\nfour patients underwent surgery without AVS being per-\nformed. Postoperatively, 41 lesions were diagnosed as\nadrenocortical adenoma by light microscopic examination\n(APA group), and one lesion was diagnosed as a metastasis\nfrom renal cell carcinoma. After surgery, hypertension in\n41 patients improved with normalization of ARR. Further,\n97 patients (possible PA group) had at least one positive\ntest result but did not undergo any surgery (Figure 1).\nConfirmatory testing\n1. CCT: During the test, patients remained in the\nsupine position, and PAC and PRA were measured\nat 0, 60, and 90 min after the oral administration of\ncaptopril (50 mg). The CCT was considered to be\npositive if the ARR at 60 or 90 min after captopril\n2. SIT: Patients were administered an intravenous\ndrip infusion of 2 l of 0.9% NaCl over 4 h. After\ninfusion, PAC was measured. The SIT was consid-\nFigure 1. Diagnostic flowchart.

FUT: After maintaining a supine position for at\nleast 30 min, venipuncture was performed for the\nmeasurement of basal PRA. A bolus injection of 40\nmg furosemide was administered to each patient.\nPatients maintained an upright posture during the\ntest. At 2 h after furosemide administration, PRA\nwas measured. The FUT was regarded as positive\ntest as a routine examination. After maintaining a supine\nposition for at least 30 min, a bolus injection of 250 \u00b5g\ncosyntropin (synthetic (1\u00ad24) ACTH produced by Daiichi\nSankyo Co.) was administered to each patient. PAC and\nplasma cortisol were measured at 0, 30, and 60 min after\nthe injection.\nAVS\nAVS was performed by expert radiologists to diagnose\nwhether unilateral or bilateral aldosterone-producing\nlesions was present. AVS was performed with cosyntropin,\nas previously reported.4,10,11 When the lateralized ratio\n(adrenal venous blood aldosterone/cortisol ratio on the\nhigh-value side)/(adrenal venous blood aldosterone/\ncortisol ratio on the low-value side) was at least 2.6 after\nACTH administration, a unilateral lesion was considered\nto be present on the high-value side.\nStatistical analysis\nAll the data are presented as medians with interquartile\nranges. We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nfollowed by post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls-Test to\ncompare means between groups. Values of p<0.05 were\nconsidered to indicate statistical significance.\nReceiver-operating characteristic (ROC)\ncurve analysis\nThe diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH stimulation test was\nassessed with a ROC curve and the area under the ROC\ncurve (AUCROC\n). First, we analyzed the diagnostic accu-\nracy of the ACTH test for differentiating between non-PA\npatients and PA patients diagnosed by confirmatory tests\n(including both APA and possible PA groups). Second, we\nanalyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test in dif-\nferentiating between APA patients and possible PA and\nnon-PA patients. Because some patients in the possible PA\ngroup were expected to have APA, we defined the \"con-\nfirmed PA group\" to include patients from the APA group\nand those from the possible PA group who showed both\nhigh ARR (>40) and hypokalemia (serum potassium<3.5\nmEq/l) (Figure 1). Finally, we analyzed the diagnostic\naccuracy of the ACTH test for differentiating between the\nconfirmed PA group and the rest of the cohort.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study population\nThe clinical characteristics of each group are summarized in\nTable 1. Body weight of the APA patients differed signifi-\ncantly from that of the possible PApatients.Age, height, and\nbody mass index did not differ among the groups. Patients\nin the APA group showed significantly lower serum potas-\nsium levels compared with the patients in the other groups.\nFurther, basal PAC levels and ARR in the APA group were\nhigher than those in the possible PA and non-PA groups.\nPositive rates for the three confirmatory tests\nThe positive rates for CCT and FUT were more than 94%\nand 97% in the APA group, respectively, while the positive\nrate for SIT was only about 70%. In the possible PA group,\nthe positive rate of SIT was only 46% (Table 2).\nTable 1.

In the APA\ngroup, the PAC values at 30 min and 60 min were signifi-\ncantly higher compared with those in the other two groups.\nMax PAC values, Max PAC to cortisol at the same time\nratio (Max PAC/CS), and delta PAC values in the APA\ngroup were significantly higher than the corresponding\nvalues in the other two groups. Further, the Max PAC val-\nues and delta PAC values in the possible PA group were\nsignificantly higher than those in the non-PA group. The\ndifferences in the Max PAC/CS values between the possi-\nble PA and non-PA groups were not significantly different\n(Table 3). In addition, the Max PAC value in the APA\ngroup was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that in the\npossible PA and non-PA groups, and the Max PAC value in\nthe possible PA group was significantly higher (p<0.05)\nthan that in the non-PA group (Figure 2).\nDiagnostic accuracy of the ACTH stimulation test\nWe analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test for\ndifferentiating between non-PA patients and PA patients\ndiagnosed by confirmatory tests (APA and possible PA\ngroups). The AUCROC\nof Max PAC was about 0.70, and the\noptimal cut-off value of Max PAC was >28.8 ng/dl. These\nresults corresponded to a sensitivity and specificity of 64%\nand 74%, respectively (Figure 3(a)). The Youden-\nindex-based optimal cut-off was the same as above. We\nanalyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test for dif-\nferentiating between APA group and possible PA and non-\nPA groups. The AUCROC\nof Max PAC was about 0.73, and\nthe optimal cut-off value of Max PAC was >36.8 ng/dl.\nThese results corresponded to a sensitivity and specificity\nof 61% and 75%, respectively (Figure 3(b)). The Youden-\nindex-based optimal cut-off was 41.7 ng/dl, with a sensi-\ntivity and specificity of 56% and 82%, respectively.\nFinally, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the\nACTH test for identifying the confirmed PA group. The\nAUCROC\nof Max PAC was about 0.77, and the optimal\ncut-off value of Max PAC was >33.3 ng/dl. These results\ncorresponded to a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and\n70%, respectively (Figure 3(c)). The Youden-index-based\noptimal cut-off of Max PAC was 36.8 ng/dl, with a sensi-\ntivity and specificity of 65% and 81%, respectively. The\nvalue corresponded to a sensitivity of 32%.\nDiscussion\nThe diagnosis of PA is a challenging problem in this field.\nAlthough medical societies have advocated five tests for\ndiagnosis, there is no consensus as to a single, optimal\nconfirmatory test for PA. Nanba et al. investigated the\ndiagnostic significance of confirmatory tests in Japanese\nTable 2.

Our findings are in agreement\nwith their results. Therefore, both CCT and FUT may be\nconsidered as optimal tests for diagnosing PA.\nThe present study was performed to test whether the\nACTH stimulation test was useful for differentiating\nbetween PA and non-PA hypertensive patients. Some stud-\nies have reported that the ACTH stimulation test is useful\nfor diagnosing PA. For example, Kem et al. reported that\nPAC levels after ACTH infusion in patients with PA were\nsignificantly higher compared with those in patients with\nessential hypertension.12 In a clinical review paper, Omura\nand Nishikawa proposed a cut-off value of Max PAC/CS\n0.85 for diagnosing PA.8 In our study, no significant dif-\nference was noted for Max PAC/CS between the possible\nPA and non-PA groups, as shown in Table 3. On the other\nhand, Max PAC appeared to be more useful for differential\ndiagnosis than Max PAC/CS. However, in the present\nstudy, the optimal cut-off value of Max PAC (>28.8 ng/dl)\nshowed a low accuracy. Thus, the ACTH stimulation test\nwas not adequately sensitive or specific for differentiating\nbetween PA and non-PA hypertensive patients.\nThe two major subtypes of PA are APA and idiopathic\nhyperaldosteronism (IHA).11 After diagnosing PA, the sub-\ntype needs to be identified. In IHA patients, hypersecretion\nof aldosterone usually occurs from both adrenal glands.\nCurrently, AVS is the only \"gold standard\" test to distin-\nguish between unilateral and bilateral PA.7,13 In order to\nidentify PA patients, AVS is a reliable test, but it is an inva-\nsive, risky, and costly procedure.7 Therefore, alternative\nmethods of diagnosis are required. Reincke et al. reported\nthat APA is generally more sensitive to ACTH compared\nwith IHA owing to the expression of ACTH receptors on\nAPA.14 Several reports, however, have demonstrated that\nACTH stimulation leads to an increase in PAC values in\nsome cases of IHA.11 Dexamethasone (Dex) is used in order\nto eliminate the action of endogenous ACTH. Sonoyama\net al. reported that by combining it with 1 mg Dex suppres-\nsion, the ACTH stimulation test was useful in the diagnosis\nof APA among hypertensive patients with suspected PA,\nwith the optimal cut-off value of PAC being >37.9 ng/dl at\n90 min after ACTH injection.7 Recently, Jiang et al. also\nreported that the ACTH stimulation test with 1 mg Dex\nsuppression was useful for differentiating patients with\nunilateral PA from patients with bilateral PA, with the opti-\nafter ACTH injection.15 In these two studies, 1 mg Dex\nFigure 2.

AUC: area under the curve.\n6 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nwas used to eliminate the action of endogenous ACTH.\nHowever, the authors could not clarify whether Dex sup-\npression was absolutely necessary for such differentiation.\nTherefore, in our study, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy\nof the ACTH stimulation test without Dex suppression for\ndifferentiating between APA patients and other patients.\nIn our study, the optimal cut-off value of Max PAC for dif-\nferentiating between the APA group and other patients was\n>36.8 ng/dl, showing moderate accuracy.\nWhile computed tomography (CT) is used for diag-\nnosing adrenal tumors, it often falls to diagnose these\nlesions10,16 because APAs frequently measure less than 1\ncm in diameter. Furthermore, it is very difficult to differ-\nentiate between bilateral APA patients and bilateral IHA\npatients. In the present study, it was likely that some\npatients from the possible PA group may have had APAs.\nIf such patients can be accurately excluded from the possi-\nble PA group and included in the APA group, the diagnos-\ntic power between the APA group and other patients might\nshow higher accuracy. We therefore defined a \"confirmed\nPA group\" that included patients from the APA group and\npatients from the possible PA group with both high ARR\nand hypokalemia. With this classification, the optimal\ncut-off value of Max PAC was >33.3 ng/dl and showed\nmoderate accuracy. Thus, the (1\u00ad24) ACTH stimulation\ntest without combined Dex administration showed moder-\nate diagnostic power compared with the test with Dex.\nwhile this value will show a poor sensitivity of 32%\n(Figure 3(c)). Therefore, the ACTH test would not be\nuseful for a part of routine screening tests. The positive\nfinding of the ACTH test may at least support a higher\nlikelihood of lateralizing on AVS, and it might be per-\nformed in limited patients, for example, the patients who\nreally would not like to have AVS.\nSome limitations of our study should be mentioned.\nThis study was a retrospective analysis, and recall bias\ncannot be excluded. We also used the diagnostic criteria of\nJapanese guidelines in Japanese patients. Additional stud-\nies are needed for clarifying the usefulness of the ACTH\nstimulation test in other populations.\nIn conclusion, both CCT and FUT may be considered\nas optimal tests for diagnosing PA, while the ACTH stimu-\nlation test was not adequately sensitive or specific as a\nscreening or confirmatory test for PA. In contrast, the\nACTH stimulation test may be useful for differentiating\nbetween patients with confirmed PA and the rest of the\ncohort. The positive finding of the ACTH test may at least\nsupport a higher likelihood of lateralizing on AVS, and it\nmight be performed in limited patients.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
