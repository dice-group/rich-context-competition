Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the\naccuracy of ADRR.\nMethods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library published between\nApril 1971\u00adFebruary 2016. Studies focusing on the accuracy of ADRR for PA screening were included. Two authors\nindependently extracted information regarding patient characteristics, antihypertensives status, true positives, true\nnegatives, false positives, and false negatives. The random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Heterogeneity\nwas explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression.\nResults: Nine studies involving 974 patients were included. The overall sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and\n324 respectively, with substantial heterogeneity. Meta-regression showed that antihypertensive status affects the ADRR\nand may account for the heterogeneity (p=0.03). Subgroup analysis of patients who discontinued the antihypertensives\nConclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of ADRR as a screening test for PA. However, as antihypertensive\ndrugs can interfere with the interpretation of ADRR, it is recommended to interrupt therapy or at least replace with\nanalogues that do not significantly affect the ADRR value.\n",

The prevalence of PA is more than 10% in\nhypertensive patients.2 Moreover, PA patients tend to\nexperience more cardiovascular events than those with\nessential hypertension (EH).3 Consequently, an accurate\nand early diagnosis of PA is essential, as specific treatment\ncan alleviate its impact on mortality. As recommended by\nthe guidelines, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is cur-\nrently used for PA screening.2 An elevated ARR indicates\nthe possibility of PA but further confirmatory testing is\nrequired. Conventionally, the plasma aldosterone concen-\ntration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) are meas-\nured to calculate ARR (PAC/PRA). However, PRA\nmeasurement is influenced by various factors, e.g. angio-\ntensinogen concentration, incubation conditions, pH value,\nand it shows poor inter-laboratory reproducibility.4 To\navoid these issues, the measurement of direct renin con-\ncentration (DRC) is appropriate to determine ARR (PAC/\nAldosterone/direct renin concentration\nratio as a screening test for primary\naldosteronism: A meta-analysis\nXiyue Li*, Richa Goswami*, Shumin Yang and Qifu Li\n Keywords\nPrimary aldosteronism, direct renin concentration, aldosterone-to-renin ratio, aldosterone/direct renin concentration,\nscreening test\nDepartment of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of\nChongqing Medical University, China\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nQifu Li, Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of\nChongqing Medical University, No. 1 Youyi Street, Yuzhong District,\nChongqing, China.\nEmail: liqifu@yeah.net\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nDRC). The DRC assay provides several advantages com-\npared with PRA, e.g. specimen handing, shorter turn\naround time, better reproducibility, and easier standardiza-\ntion.5 Correlation between DRC and PRA is generally\ngood except when concentration of PRA is below 1 ng/\nml/h.5,6 Meanwhile, the diagnostic efficiency of plasma\naldosterone/direct renin concentration ratio (ADRR, PAC/\nDRC) was varied in studies,7\u00ad19 and no general consensus\nregarding the impact of antihypertensives on the measured\nADRR value is available.\nAccordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess\nthe accuracy of ADRR, and the impact of antihyperten-\nsives on PA screening.\nMethods\nSearch strategy and study criteria\nThe electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the\nCochrane library were screened for the following keywords:\n\"primary aldosteronism,\" \"primary hyperaldosteronism,\"\nand \"renin concentration.\"- The search was limited to publi-\ncations in English on human subjects. The period fromApril\nbibliographies were screened for relevant additional studies.\nThe abstracts of the studies were independently evaluated\naccording to the inclusion criteria by two authors (XL and\nRG). Studies were included when fulfilling the following\npoints: (a) studies using at least one of the four confirmatory\ntests (oral sodium loading test, saline infusion test, fludro-\ncortisones suppression test, and captopril challenge test)\nrecommended by guidelines2 or if a histopathological diag-\nnosis for PA was made; (b) studies discussing the accuracy\nof diagnosis forADRR in PAscreening and a 2\u00d72 table with\na certain cut-off could be constructed; and (c) the availabil-\nity of a full text publication.\nData extraction\nTwo reviewers (XL and RG) independently performed the\ndata extraction of all selected studies. The extracted data\nconsisted of information about the first author, year of\npublication, sample size, gender, original cut-off for a pos-\nitive result, antihypertensives status, blood sampling con-\nditions, potassium concentration, and a 2\u00d72 table of true\npositives, true negatives, false positives, and false nega-\ntives. For a better comparison the ADRR units (pmol/l)/\n(mU/l) were divided by 1.76 to convert to (ng/l)/(ng/l) as\nper the guidelines.2 Disagreements were resolved by dis-\ncussion until consensus was reached. Authors were con-\ntacted for additional information if the required data were\nunclear or were not presented in the full article.\nQuality assessment\nThe Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\n(QUADAS-2) criteria recommended by the Cochrane\nCollaboration was used to evaluate the methodological\nquality of each included study.20 QUADAS-2 criteria con-\nsist of four key domains: the patient selection, the index\ntest, the reference standard, and the flow and timing of\nsamples/patients along the study. Each is assessed in terms\nof risk of bias and the first three in terms of concerns\nregarding applicability. Each key domain was graded as\n\"low,\" \"high,\" or \"unclear,\" if information for accurate\njudgment was lacking.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, the threshold effect was evaluated by the Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient. Meanwhile, I\u00b2 was used to evaluate\nthe influence of heterogeneity between studies caused by\ninconsistencies instead of chance. The quantity I\u00b2 ranges\nfrom 0\u00ad100%, where 0% indicates the unobserved hetero-\ngeneity and more than 50% may represent substantial het-\nerogeneity. The random effects model was used when I\u00b2\nwas more than 30%. Pooled sensitivity and specificity esti-\nmation points with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were\ncalculated for PA screening. Forest plots were used to dis-\nplay sensitivity and specificity in this study. For each out-\ncome, the summary receiving operation characteristic\ncurves and the respective area under the curve (AUC) were\nconstructed for accuracy. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR)\nis the ratio of the odds of a positive test result in a patient\nwith disease compared with the odds of a positive test result\nin a patient without disease. It is the best indicator of test\nperformance. To explore the causes of heterogeneity among\nthe studies, meta-regression as well as subgroup analysis\nwas performed. More than four studies in a subgroup were\nselected to achieve more credible results. For meta-regres-\nsion, the residual maximum likelihood method was used to\nestimate between\u00adstudy variance, and the discontinuation\nof antihypertensives was included as a covariate. Funnel\nplots were constructed to allow visual inspection for poten-\ntial publication bias.21 All analyses were performed with\nMeta-Disc version 1.4. The funnel plots were constructed\nby STATAversion 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station,\nTexas, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, with a p\nvalue of 0.05 denoting statistical significance.\nResults\nThe literature search identified 1043 articles (Figure 1).\nThe titles and abstracts of all articles were screened.\nTwenty-one articles were retrieved for full text evaluation.\nNine articles7\u00ad15 of these, met our inclusion criteria for\nfinal meta-analysis as summarized in Table 1. From all\nreviewed studies, the most common reasons for exclusion\nwere the following: (a) the study was unable provide the\nbasis for a 2\u00d72 table with a specific cut-off (n=6); (b) the\nstudy did not use any confirmatory tests in diagnosing PA\n(n=5); and (c) the study used the post-captopril DRC\n(n=1). In total, nine studies including 974 subjects were\nselected; PA patients were recruited as patient groups in all\nLi et al. 3\nof the studies whereas one study included only patients\nwith aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), a subtype of\nPA, as their patient group. However, the definition of con-\ntrol group varied in the studies. EH patients were\nand EH subjects were recruited as controls in the study\nconducted by Corbin et al.8 Normotensive subjects were\nalso used as controls in the study conducted by Perschel\net al.11 Lastly, in the study by Tzanela et al.,12 the control\nset comprised 79 subjects without suspected adrenal dis-\neases, 27 members were hypertensive and the other 52\nwere normotensive. The cut-off of ADRR ranged from\nfrom three days to six weeks, before blood sampling. An\nupright posture was used for blood sampling in most stud-\nlected in the supine position.10\nRisk of bias and applicability judgments\nThe risk of bias is shown in Table 2. In the risk of bias,\nonly one study used normotensives as a control group and\nthus had a high risk of bias in the selection of patients. As\nto the index test, most studies had high risk, as they did not\npre-specify the cut-off values for ADRR. Regarding the\nreference standard as well as flow and timing, none of the\nstudies showed a high risk. In applicability bias, a high risk\nof bias was not found in applicability except for one study,\nwhich recruited normotensive subjects as its control group.\nOverall analyses and publication bias\nThere was no threshold effect because the Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient showed no correlations between\nsensitivity and specificity of the studies overall were 0.89\ntively (Figure 2(a)). The I\u00b2 for sensitivity (90.1%) and\nspecificity (90.6%) was more than 50%, representing a\nhigh level of inconsistency among studies. In the random\neffects model, the symmetric area under the curve (SAUC)\nof nine studies was 0.985 (Figure 2(b)). In addition, the\nNo evidence of publication bias was found (p=0.195),\nas shown in Figure 3.\nMeta-regression and subgroup analysis\nThe meta-regression analysis showed that the status of\nantihypertensives had a significant influence on heteroge-\nneity (p=0.03). Five studies regarding discontinuation of\nantihypertensives were analyzed to evaluate the impact of\ndiscontinuing antihypertensives on the diagnostic accu-\nracy of ADRR. The pooled sensitivity increased to 0.99\naddition, the I\u00b2 of sensitivity and specificity decreased to\n32% and 81%, respectively. The SAUC showed an\nenhanced accuracy (SAUC=0.993). However, pooled sen-\nsitivity and specificity of the four studies where antihy-\npertensives were not discontinued decreased to 0.73 (95%\n(Figure 4(b)). Six studies that set EH patients as the con-\ntrol group showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI\n(Figure 4(c)).\nDiscussion\nThe reported accuracy of ADRR in the screening of PA was\nFigure 1.

Various reasons clarify this high\ndegree of variability. Firstly, the cut-off of nine studies was\n((ng/l)/(ng/l)), which may be due to different populations,\nconfirmatory criteria, and approach to cut-off decisions.\nSecondly, the control selection might induce heterogeneity.\nRegarding inclusion criteria of the control groups, one\nstudy included normotensive people whose average ADRR\nwas lower than that of EH patients,11 which inevitably led\nto an overestimated diagnostic accuracy, with elevated sen-\nsitivity and specificity. As our study showed, the pooled\nsensitivity and specificity of the six studies that used EH\npatients as controls were decreased compared with the total\npooled sensitivity and specificity. Thirdly, regarding the\npatient groups, there were several inconsistent factors such\nas age, gender, confirmatory test, subtype of PA, and con-\ncentration of potassium, which might also induce hetero-\ngeneity. The influence of potassium on aldosterone and\nvice versa cannot be ignored.22 Moreover, the potassium\nlevels of PA subjects were low in most studies, leading to\ninhibition of aldosterone secretion and low PAC levels.\nLastly, the status of antihypertensive drugs and blood sam-\npling positions varied among the nine studies. Yin et al.\nshowed that the accuracy of ARR fluctuated with the dif-\nferent blood sampling positions.23 Consequently, it can be\neasily inferred that ADRR accuracy varied with changes of\nblood drawing position as ARR did. However, studies on\nthis issue are rare.\nFurthermore, discontinuation of antihypertensives and\ncut-off selection might be possible interpretations for the\nFigure 4.

Funnel plots of publication bias in nine included studies.\nESS: effective sample size.\nLi et al. 7\noutliers of the forest plots. Jansen et al. enrolled persistent\nhypertensive patients on several antihypertensives, and the\nproportion of diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers,\nand calcium channel blocker nearly reached 80% in PA and\nEH groups, which resulted in a relatively lower sensitivity.14\nFischer et al. selected 31.54 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) as the cut-off,\nwhich might lead to a relatively lower specificity.15\nThere are some studies that discuss the effects of anti-\nlead to a significant suppression of renin and less signifi-\ncantly altered aldosterone, which results in an elevated\nADRR. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nand angiotensin II receptor blockers increase renin levels\nand decrease aldosterone concentration. It is well known\nthat these molecules increase the ADRR, yet their effects\nin terms of influence on the AUC and the cut-off are still\nunder investigation.14,24,28 In addition, it is dangerous to\nstop antihypertensives in PA patients who have various\ncomplications or severe hypertension. In this study, ADRR\nin subjects who discontinued antihypertensives had sig-\nnificantly increased sensitivity (0.99 vs 0.72) and specific-\nantihypertensives. It is highly recommended to stop anti-\nhypertensives before PA screening or at least substitute the\ndrugs with less interfering ones as per recommendations of\nthe screening test.\natory criteria not recommended in the guidelines.2 They\n100 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) in cases of blood sampling in the supine\nposition, and 164 ((ng/l)/(ng/l)) in cases where subjects\nwere ambulant,16 respectively. The sensitivity ranged from\nThe poor sensitivity of 0.60 is probably due to the continu-\nation of antihypertensives, the inappropriate cut-off, the\nimproper confirmatory criteria, and the incorrect measure-\nment procedure. It should be noted that two studies com-\nbining ADRR with aldosterone concentration are more\naccurate,18,19 which requires further research. One study\nwas excluded due to measurement of ADRR after the use\nof captopril, it showed a sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity\nThis analysis has several limitations. The lack of a\ngolden standard for PA diagnosis and consistent study\ndesign lowered the power of this study. The fact that we\nused the sensitivity and specificity rather than positive and\nnegative likelihood ratios as main outcome measures is a\nlimitation, strictly, due to the various cut-offs used.\nHowever, sensitivity and specificity are easy to understand\nand widely used by clinicians.\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that ADRR\nthat the determination of ADRR is an effective and con-\nvenient screening tool for PA. The discontinuation of anti-\nhypertensives is necessary when using ADRR for PA\nscreening, and further clinical investigation is required.\nOver all, DRC may be widely used due to its easy meas-\nurement and standardization.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial\nsupport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: This research was supported by the National Key\nClinical Specialties Construction Program of China, the\nThe Fundamental Science and Advanced Technology Research\nReferences\n1.
