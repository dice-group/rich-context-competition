In most appli-\ncations, the goal of the researcher is to examine changes over\ntime on a single variable. For instance, a clinical psycholo-\ngist may examine the long-term effectiveness of a therapeu-\ntic intervention by acquiring scores from a depression\ninventory on three different occasions: (a) 1 hr prior to the\nintervention, (b) 1 month post intervention, and (c) 1 year\npost intervention. By using repeated measures ANOVA, the\nresearcher can assess the equivalence of mean levels of\ndepression across the three measurement occasions. Of\ncourse, repeated measures ANOVA can also be used to\naddress a much wider and more complex array of questions,\nespecially when additional variables are assessed over time\nor when grouping variables are also examined. Researchers\nunderstand, nonetheless, that even for a simple study design,\nconducting a repeated measures ANOVA can be tricky busi-\nness. One must worry about outliers, missing data, and a\nvariety of assumptions (e.g., continuity, normality, homoge-\nneity, and particularly sphericity). A choice must also be\nmade between the traditional univariate, multivariate, and\nmixed-model approaches toward the analysis (Misangyi,\nLePine, Algina, & Goeddeke, 2006), and with this choice\ncome additional concerns regarding corrections for Type I\nerror inflation and the potential loss of statistical power (see\nIn this article, we introduce a simple alternative to\nrepeated measures ANOVA that requires fewer assumptions,\nis immune to outliers, and allows researchers to focus on the\nobservations in hand rather than on the estimation of abstract\npopulation parameters. Researchers can also focus on assess-\ning the accuracy of predicted patterns within the data rather\nthan on the computation and interpretation of means and\nvariances. Consequently, the issues underlying the choice\nbetween the univariate, multivariate, and mixed-model\napproaches to repeated measures ANOVA are completely\neschewed.

For the first six recorded\nvisits, the bees were permitted to consume the sucrose solu-\ntion and freely fly from the flower to return to the hive.

Abramson1\n Keywords\nObservation Oriented Modeling, Ordinal Pattern Analysis, individual analysis, repeated measures ANOVA, honeybee\n2 SAGE Open\non simple laws of learning, the bees were expected to return\nto the mechanical flower (an excellent source of food) at\nshorter and shorter intervals from the first visit to the sixth.\nThe intervals between visits were referred to as Inter-Visit-\nIntervals, or IVIs. The bees were then \"frustrated\" for six\nconsecutive visits by trapping them for several minutes in the\nmechanical flower after they had consumed the sucrose solu-\ntion, thus delaying their return to the hive. For these trials,\nthe bees were expected to return to the flower at longer and\nlonger intervals as the \"frustration\" of being trapped in the\nflower affected their behavior.\nIVI measurements, reported in seconds, for 10 bees across\nthe 12 trials are presented in Table 1. The maximum interval\nfor a bee to return to the mechanical flower was set at 60 min\n(3,600 s), and all subsequent trials were treated as missing data\nif the bee returned several hours later, failed to return at all, or\nwas observed foraging at a nearby open feeder with a less\nattractive source of sucrose (note Bees 7, 8, and 10 in Table 1).\nThe recorded IVIs are considered independent between bees\nbut dependent across trials and are thus suitable for analysis\nusing a repeated measuresANOVA.As can be seen in Table 1,\nhowever, several features of the data are alarming. First, the\n3,600 values are problematic because, although they fulfill a\nuseful data management function, they represent extreme\ncases that could unduly affect the means for any given trial.\nSecond, a single missing value on any one of the 12 trials\ncould result in that bee being omitted depending on the type of\nanalysis chosen. Finally, extreme times other than the 3,600\nvalues may unduly influence the mean for any particular trial\nand consequently affect the ANOVA results as well. Indeed,\nthe means and standard errors plotted in Figure 1 show the\nAs might be expected, the results from the omnibus\nANOVA with all of the extreme values included yielded a\nhighly significant univariate omnibus F value, F(11, 88) =\nraise concerns about this result. Because the data were ana-\nlyzed in SPSS using the General Linear Model option (i.e.,\nthe traditional univariate approach to repeated measures\nANOVA), all of the data for the seventh honeybee were\nexcluded automatically from the analysis. Should the miss-\ning data be replaced with estimated IVI times? Replacing\nmissing data routinely rests on the Missing at Random or\nmore restrictive Missing Completely at Random assumptions\n(see Fox-Wasylyshyn & El-Masri, 2005, for a pithy review),\nwhich may not be the case for these data. However, no matter\nhow the missing data are finally handled, the extreme 3,600\nvalues and other outliers are still present. Perhaps these val-\nues should be deleted and replaced as well, or perhaps some\ntype of transformation should be applied to the data.\nMatters are made more difficult by the small number of\nhoneybees relative to the number of trials. Even with a com-\nplete set of observations, the data could not be analyzed with\nthe mixed-models approach (e.g., using the Mixed Model\nTable 1. Intervals (in Seconds) Between Visits to the Mechanical Flower.\nTrials\nFigure 1. Inter-Visit-Interval means and standard errors for the\n12 trials with and without extreme cases.\nGrice et al. 3\noption in SPSS on restructured data; see Little, Milliken,\nStroup, Wolfinger, & Schabenberger, 2006; Pinheiro &\nBates, 2000, for discussions of mixed-model ANOVA), and\nthe multivariate F value using the General Linear Model\noption in SPSS could not be computed due to insufficient\ndegrees of freedom. The traditional univariate approach to\nrepeated measures ANOVA was therefore the only option for\ntesting the omnibus null hypothesis (as stated below), and\nthis approach routinely requires an adjustment for violation\nof the sphericity assumption. When the Greenhouse\u00adGeisser\ncorrection is applied, the degrees of freedom decrease to 1.46\nyielding a p value of .034. Finally, the lower-bound correc-\ntion reduces the degrees of freedom to 1 and 8, yielding a\nnon-significant p value of .064. It is widely recommended\nthat researchers use one of these corrections to the univariate\nF value due to its sensitivity to violations of the sphericity\nassumption (Maxwell & Delaney, 2004). Which correction\nshould be chosen here, and what of the other assumptions\nunderlying the accuracy of the p value? Are additional trans-\nformations to the data or statistical adjustments necessary?\nWith this question for these troublesome data, and without\neven arriving at more interesting specific mean comparisons,\nit should be clear that Frankenstein's monster is potentially at\nhand . . . and he will be all too willing to lead his creator into\nmisguided interpretations and conclusions.\nObservation Oriented Modeling\nWhat is needed for these types of \"difficult\" data is an\nOrdinal Pattern Analysis (OPA), which is simple, relatively\nfree of assumptions, and yields results that are transparent\nand easily interpretable (Thorngate & Edmonds, 2013).\nConducted within the wider context of Observation Oriented\nModeling (Grice, 2011), this analysis also prompts an overall\nshift in perspective. Traditional statistics, such as theANOVA\nexample above, represent what Breiman (2001) refers to as\nthe modeling approach to data. This approach regards data to\nbe the result of stochastic processes, and analyses are cen-\ntered on model fitting and parameter estimation. Binary deci-\nsions are also often made with regard to the fitted models\n(e.g., \"the linear model was statistically significant\") and\nestimated parameters (\"the null hypothesis, \u00b5 = 0, was\nrejected\").\nIn contrast, the observation oriented modeler regards data\nto be the result of a generative causal mechanism. In the ideal\ncase, the researcher will in fact construct an iconic model\ndescribing the structures and processes underlying the data\n(e.g., Grice, 2015; Grice, Barrett, Schlimgen, & Abramson,\n2012). The goal of the analysis is therefore to identify theo-\nretically meaningful and robust patterns with the given obser-\nvations (data), which is more akin to what Breiman (2001)\nreferred to as algorithmic modeling. Because patterns are\nsought, the computation of means, variances, covariances,\nand so on, is unnecessary, nor is it necessary to use a particu-\nlar statistical model (e.g., the General Linear Model). The\nentire null hypothesis significance testing paradigm, which\nunderlies the binary decisions in traditional statistics, is also\nreplaced by analyses that (a) involve careful visual examina-\ntion of data using the \"eye test\" (or \"interocular traumatic\ntest,\" Edwards, Lindman, & Savage, 1963) and (b) provide\nthe tools necessary for determining which observations are\nconsistent with the theoretically meaningful pattern.\nDetermining the overall accuracy of the explanatory model is\ntherefore tantamount, leading to an increase or decrease of\nconfidence in the model.\nTo demonstrate the shift in perspective from data model-\ning and repeated measures ANOVA to Observation Oriented\nModeling and OPA, we reanalyzed portions of Craig et al.'s\n(2012) original data. The complete design of Craig et al.'s\nstudy was quite complex, including 23 IVIs and 3 experi-\nmental and 1 control group of honeybees (total N = 50). For\nthe purposes of demonstrating OPA and comparing it with\nANOVA, we examined only the first 12 IVIs and only 2\ngroups of honeybees. This subset of the original data was\nsufficient to demonstrate the occurrence of learning in the\nhoneybees (OPAresults for the complete design can be found\nin Craig et al.), and it facilitated the presentation of various\npredicted patterns (via simpler graphs) as well as the explo-\nration of novel analyses not reported by Craig et al. (viz.,\nanalyses involving predicted stability of IVIs).\nTesting Patterns\nAs demonstrated in Craig et al.'s article, the shift in perspec-\ntive from data modeling to Observation Oriented Modeling\nstarts at the beginning, that is, with the hypotheses. With a\nrepeated measures ANOVA, the goal is to estimate popula-\ntion parameters from the observed data, and in the frame-\nwork of null hypothesis significance testing the null\nhypothesis is stated as follows:\nH\n: \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\n= \u00b5\nIn other words, all 12 population means are hypothesized\nto be equal. The omnibus alternative hypothesis is that 2 or\nmore of these 12 population means are not equal. More spe-\ncific alternative hypotheses could be advanced contrasting\npairs or groups of population means.\nGiven these hypotheses, however, it is important to real-\nize that Craig et al. (2012) had no interest in estimating popu-\nlation parameters. Indeed, it is not clear what honeybees\nwould constitute the imaginary population. Would the popu-\nlation only include forager honeybees (Apis mellifera ligus-\ntica) of approximately 3 to 6 weeks of age from the two hives\nthat were sampled in the study, or would the population\ninclude nurse bees, drones, and the queens of the two hives?\nShould the population instead equal the global population of\n4 SAGE Open\nApis mellifera ligustica, or should it include all subspecies of\nApis mellifera in the world? How far, exactly, should the\nsample be generalized? Unfortunately, there is simply no\nway to answer these questions in a non-arbitrary manner,\nwhich is not to suggest that populations are always defined\narbitrarily or that estimating population parameters is never\nworthwhile. In political polling, games of chance, and\nresearch in which a random or representative sample can be\ndrawn from a clearly specified population, for example,\nparameter estimation can prove fruitful; but none of these\ninstances covers Craig et al.'s study, nor are they representa-\ntive of the authors' scientific goals.\nLike the majority of behavioral researchers, Craig et al.\n(2012) were instead attempting to explain the behavior of\nhoneybees. In other words, they were interested in making an\nabductive inference (Douven, 2011) to the causes underlying\nhoneybee behavior rather than making a statistical inference\nAbductive inference\ninvolves reasoning from claims about phenomena, understood\nas presumed effects, to their theoretical explanation in terms of\nunderlying causal mechanisms. Upon positive judgments of the\ninitial plausibility of these explanatory theories, attempts are\nmade to elaborate on the nature of the causal mechanisms in\nAbduction is also consistent with the philosophical real-\nism underlying Observation Oriented Modeling, which\nencourages scientists to develop integrated, causal models\nthat explain the observations made in a given study (see\nTurning one's focus to abduction rather than statistical infer-\nence leads to a number of startling and liberating realiza-\ntions. First, because population parameters are not necessarily\nbeing estimated, issues such as inferential errors (Type I, II,\nor III; Harris, 1997), statistical power, and parameter bias\ncan fall by the wayside. As will be made explicit below, the\ngoal in Observation Oriented Modeling is to identify mean-\ningful and improbable patterns of observations (i.e., behav-\niors) of individual honeybees. Second, aggregate statistics\nsuch as means, variances, and covariances can be avoided\nnot only as population parameters, but avoided in the analy-\nses altogether. Causes operate at the level of the individuals\nand serve as the necessary conditions for each bee's behav-\nior. Causes do not affect means or other aggregate statistics\ndirectly, and hence the traditional, Galtonian/Fisherian/\nPearsonian ways of thinking about data are not required. The\nObservation Oriented Modeler is thus not restricted to the\nuse of inferential statistical methods and traditional mean-\nand variance-based analyses, and is instead ready to approach\nthe order of nature in novel ways.\nAs mentioned above, in Observation Oriented Modeling,\nthe focus is placed on patterns of observations. Craig et al.\n(2012) clearly expected a particular pattern in the recorded\nIVIs based on their understanding of the laws of learning.\nThe pattern they expected and tested is ordinal, and it is a\npattern that should match the observed values for every hon-\neybee in their sample; hence, the proper level of analysis (see\nTrafimow, 2014) is the recorded IVI times for each bee. With\nthis in mind, the expected pattern of ordinal relations can be\ndefined in the OOM software as shown in Figure 2. As can\nbe seen, the matrix in the figure is comprised of 12 rows,\nwith the top and bottom rows labeled as \"Highest\" and\n\"Lowest,\" respectively. The columns are comprised of the 12\ntrials, and the shaded cells indicate the expected pattern of\nordinal relations among the observed IVI times.As described\nabove, each bee was expected to return to the mechanical\nflower faster and faster from Trials 1 through 6 (i.e., the IVIs\nwere expected to decrease).After being \"frustrated\" by being\ntrapped in the flower, each bee was then expected to take\nincreasingly longer times to return to the flower (i.e., the\nIVIs were expected to increase). Moreover, the longest time\nfor Trials 1 through 6 was expected to be shorter than the\nshortest time for Trials 7 through 12; in other words, every\nIVI for Trials 1 to 6 was expected to be shorter than every\nWiththeexpectedpatterndeterminedbasedontheresearch-\ners' understanding of the causes behind the data, the observa-\ntions for each honeybee can be examined. Figure 3 shows the\nresults for the sixth bee in Table 1.As can be seen, her recorded\nIVI times matched the ordinal pattern closely. In OOM, there\nare two ways to quantify the fit between the observations and\nthe expected ordinal pattern. First, only adjacent trials (i.e., the\ncolumns in Figure 3) can be considered, namely, 1 versus 2, 3\npairs of adjacent trials. If the ordinal relation for a bee's\nFigure 2. Expected ordinal pattern for IVI times for each\nhoneybee across the 12 trials.\nNote. IVI = Inter-Visit-Interval.\nGrice et al. 5\nobservations matches the expected ordinal relation for any\npair of adjacent trials, then the pair of observations is consid-\nered as \"correctly classified.\" Using this adjacent counting\nmethod, the honeybee in Figure 3 produced eight correctly\nclassified pairs of observations. Converting this result to a per-\ncentage yields the Percent Correct Classification (PCC) index\nfor this honeybee, which is the primary numerical value to be\nobtained from analyses in OOM. For this bee, the PCC index\nSecond, all possible pairs of observations can be consid-\ntrials, there are 66 (\nC\n= 66) pairs of observations that can\nbe classified as correctly matching the ordinal pattern. The\nnumber of correct classifications for the honeybee in Figure\n3 using this more stringent criterion is 54, yielding a PCC\nindex equal to 81.82%, an impressive result. This second\napproach for classifying pairs of observations is said to be\nmore stringent because it takes into account the entire pat-\ntern rather than only adjacent pairs of observations. The\nhypothetical data in Figure 4, for instance, fit the expected\npattern perfectly (PCC = 100%) when considering only\nadjacent observations, but only 36 of the 66 pairs of obser-\nvations (PCC = 54.55%) are correctly classified if the entire\npattern is considered. The decision to use either method\nwould ideally be driven by a causal, integrated model\n(Grice, 2011), but as will be shown below, using both meth-\nods for computing the PCC values for the same data may be\npragmatically beneficial.\nUsing the option to match the entire pattern, the results for\neach honeybee are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, the\nnumber of correctly classified pairs of observations is tallied\nand converted to the PCC index. Obviously, the PCC index\nranges from 0 to 100, and the expectation here is that each\nvalue will equal 100, indicating perfect accuracy for the ordi-\nnal pattern. Not a single honeybee matched the pattern per-\nfectly, all but one yielded PCC indices of at least 60%, whereas\nfour bees' PCC indices were at least 80%, which is fairly\nimpressive given the strict method of attempting to match the\nentire pattern.\nA probability statistic, referred to as a c-value (or chance\nvalue), is also reported in Table 2 for each honeybee. It was\ncomputed by first randomizing the data within trials for each\nbee. Consider, for example, values for a single bee from three\nnext computed for the randomized data on the basis of the\nexpected ordinal pattern, and the process is repeated for a set\nnumber of times (1,000 randomized trials for the current anal-\nysis). The PCC indices are recorded, and the number of times\nthe actual observed PCC index is equaled or exceeded for\neach honeybee is tallied and converted to a proportion. Ahigh\nc-value near one therefore indicates that randomized versions\nof the same data routinely yielded PCC values as high or\nhigher than the actual PCC value. In other words, the observed\nPCC index was not unusual. A low c-value near zero, on the\nother hand, indicates that the observed PCC index was rather\nunusual because it was not readily equaled or exceeded by\nPCC indices from randomized versions of the actual data. The\nchance value is therefore a randomization test, and it is\nreported as a \"c-value\" rather than a \"p value\" to remind\nresearchers that it is an assumption-free probability derived\nfrom repeated randomizations of the actual data (e.g., no\nassumptions of normality, homogeneity, and so on, are made;\nFigure 3. Expected (shaded cells) and observed (1s) ordinal\nrelations for the sixth frustrated honeybee's IVI times across the\nNote. Although the 1s are not plotted within the shaded cells, their\nrelative pattern closely matches the pattern of shaded cells, thus indicating\nhigh agreement between the expected and observed patterns.\nFigure 4. Hypothetical data for which the PCC index equals\n100% when considering only adjacent observations, but equals\nonly 54.55% when considering all pairs of observations.\nNote. PCC = Percent Correct Classification.\n6 SAGE Open\nsee Winch & Campbell, 1969, for an early discussion of ran-\ndomization tests; see Edgington & Onghena, 2007; Manly,\nExamination of the c-values in Table 2 reveals that the\nobserved results were highly improbable for all but the fifth\nhoneybee. The PCC index for this bee was only 39.39, and\nher results in Figure 5 show that, for some unknown reason,\nher IVIs were often shorter (indicating faster returns to the\nflower) after being trapped in the flower. No other informa-\ntion about this particular bee helped to explain her unex-\npected behavior, but it is clear OOM provides the tools\nnecessary for focusing on the individual honeybees rather\nthan on means or the estimation of abstract population\nparameters.\nTable 2 also shows that missing data can be handled at the\nlevel of the individual bees. IVI times were not recorded for\nTrials 10 to 12 for the seventh bee. The number of possible\npairs of observations was thus reduced from 66 to 36, and the\nPCC index was computed on the basis of the 36 possible cor-\nrect classifications. The result was impressive (83.33%) for\nthe seventh honeybee, and the c-value (.01) again indicated\nthat the result was improbable. As another option for han-\ndling missing data, the PCC index can be computed on the\nbasis of the original possible pairs of observations, 66 in this\ncase. Using this option for the seventh honeybee, the PCC\nthus indicating the impact of the missing data. In addition to\nthe missing data, the extreme values in the data set (see Table 1)\nposed no problems for the analysis because it is based on\nordinal relations much like other non-parametric statistical\nprocedures (see Cliff, 1996). No adjustments were necessary\nto the data themselves nor to the analysis itself.\nThe results for all of the bees considered together can also\nbe examined. These results are printed in the OOM software\nas follows:\nClassification Results : All Observations\n Ordinal Relations between Pairs of\n\nObservations Classified According to the\nDefined Pattern(s)\nClassifiable Pairs of Observations : 630\nClassifiable Complete Cases : 9\nCorrectly Classified Complete Cases : 0\nPercent Correct Classified Cases : 0.00\nRandomization Results : All Observations\nObserved Percent Correct Classifications : 69.52\nValues >= Observed Percent Correct : 0\nModel c-value : less\nObserved Percent Correct Classified Cases : 0.00\nTable 2.

The value here, 630, equals the sum of the\nClassifiable Pairs of Observations reported in Table 2, and it\ncan be seen that the missing pairs of observations for the sev-\nenth bee have been excluded. Of the 630 non-missing pairs\nacross all of the bees and all of the trials, 438 were consistent\nwith the ordinal pattern in Figure 2 and reported as Correct\nClassifications, yielding a fairly impressive PCC index of\ntest show that not a single PCC index from 1,000 randomized\nmax = 60.16) the observed PCC index. The c-value is thus less\ntions of the data, a PCC value of at least 69.52 could still be\nobserved. Finally, the Correctly Classified Complete Cases in\nthe output above shows that not one of the nine honeybees (or\ncases) with non-missing data fit the entire pattern perfectly;\nPCC = 0, with a c-value necessarily equal to 1.\nThe results for all 10 honeybees are arguably good with\nthe overall PCC index equal to 69.52% and most of the indi-\nvidual bee PCC indices greater than 60%. Still, as with an\nomnibus ANOVA, a question to ask of the current analysis is\nwhether or not most of the correct classifications are a result\nof comparing the trials prior to and after trapping the bees in\nthe artificial flower. It may be the case, for instance, that the\nobservations (recorded IVI times) do not fit the pattern in\nFigure 2 very well for Trials 1 to 6 nor for Trials 7 to 12, but\nthat the first 6 IVIs are generally lower than the 6 IVIs after\nthe bees were trapped in the flower. To address this possibil-\nity, the IVIs were analyzed for only the first six trials and\nusing the expected decreasing ordinal pattern for only those\ntrials. The overall PCC index was low (PCC = 42.67%,\nc-value = .90), and the PCC indices for 8 of the 10 bees were\nand 60.00%. Next, the last six trials were analyzed, again\nusing the expected increasing ordinal pattern for those trials.\nThe overall PCC index was higher (PCC = 73.19%, c-value\n< .001), and the PCC indices for all but one of the bees (the\nfourth bee) were greater than 65%, with four values equal to\nor greater than 80%. These results, considered with those for\nthe complete pattern above, indicate that the IVIs did not\ngenerally decrease from the first to sixth trials, but the times\nTable 3. PCC Indices and c-Values for Predicted Ordinal Pairwise Comparisons of IVI Times.\nNote. IVI = Inter-Visit-Interval; PCC = Percent Correct Classification.\n8 SAGE Open\nwere greater for Trials 7 through 12 while also increasing in\na monotonic rate for all but one bee.\nLast, much like pairwise comparisons following an omni-\nbus repeated measuresANOVA, all pairs of IVI values across\nall 12 trials can be examined in a manner consistent with the\nexpected ordinal relations shown in Figure 2. Table 3 reports\nthe results from these analyses, which clearly show the ordi-\nnal predictions for the first 6 trials do not fit the observations\nvery well. Most PCC indices for these pairwise comparisons\nwere 50% or lower, again indicating that the IVI times did\nnot decrease in a monotonic fashion. When comparing IVI\nvalues from Trials 1 to 6 with Trials 7 to 12 in pairwise fash-\nion, the PCC indices were all quite high. Most percentages\nwere 80% or higher, and five values were 100%. Consistent\nwith the conclusions above, trapping the honeybees in the\nmechanical flower led to higher IVI values. Last, pairwise\ncomparisons for the last six trials showed the IVI values to be\nincreasing in a somewhat monotonic fashion, with most PCC\nindices equal to or greater than 66%.\nTesting Equivalence\n(see Table 4) who were allowed to fly freely from the\nmechanical flower for all 12 trials. These bees were not\nexpected to demonstrate learned \"frustration\" like the other\nbees. Craig et al.'s analysis of the observed IVI times for\nthese bees indeed revealed remarkably poor fit to the ordinal\npattern in Figure 5. For the sake of demonstration in this\narticle, let us now suppose that the IVI times were not\nexpected to change substantially from trial to trial. Indeed, if\nthe times for each bee were expected to be exactly equal\nacross all trials, then the predicted ordinal pattern would be\ndefined as shown in Figure 6. It would of course be unrealis-\ntic to expect perfect equality for each bee in this study.\nNumerous other causes are at work influencing the bees'\nbehavior, including activity in the hive, fatigue, weather con-\nditions, and temperature. Consequently, the pattern in Figure\n6 is tested in the OOM software using an imprecision setting.\nIdeally, such a setting would be based on previous observa-\ntions, studies, or precise theory, but here it will be set in a\nsomewhat arbitrary fashion. Specifically, it is reasonable to\nexpect each honeybee to return to the flower within 2 min of\neach trial given the proximity of the hive to the mechanical\nflower and the sorts of delays any given bee might encounter\nwhen flying, entering the hive, and unloading her social crop.\nThe question then is, given a range of \u00b1120 s, will the IVI\ntimes match the ordinal pattern in Figure 6? In other words,\nwill each bee return to the mechanical flower within 2 min\neach time, from the first trial to the last?\nThe results from the OOM software for the individual\nhoneybees are shown in Table 5 and indicate an impressive\ndegree of conformity between the observations and the\nexpected pattern with the \u00b1120 s imprecision setting. The\nPCC index was equal to 100% for the fourth bee, and the\nTable 4. Intervals (in Seconds) Between Visits to the Mechanical Flower.\nTrials\nFigure 6. Predicted pattern of equal IVI times for each honeybee\nacross the 12 trials.\nNote. The vertical position (i.e., the row) of the shaded line of cells is\narbitrary. IVI = Inter-Visit-Intervals.\nGrice et al. 9\nindices for four other bees were more than 80%. Only the IVI\ntimes for the 10th bee revealed very poor agreement with the\nexpected ordinal pattern. As can be seen in Table 4, her IVIs\ntern across the 12 trials. The magnitudes of her times were\ngenerally high when compared with the other 9 bees, but no\nexplanation could be found for why she was slow and for the\nvariable in her IVI times.\nWhen equivalent patterns such as the one shown in Figure\n6 are examined, the c-values will always equal 1 if all pairs\nof observations are being compared and the data are random-\nized as described above. Imagine, for example, IVI times for\nbetween all possible pairs of the original observations will\nequal the differences for the randomized values, namely, 25,\n15, and 10. No matter how many times the IVI observations\nare randomized, this equality will always result, yielding the\nsame PCC index in every case and a c-value of 1.\nConsequently, a randomization method that randomizes\nacross (not just within) the bees is necessary for these types\nof patterns. For these data, we randomized both within all 12\nIVI trials and across all 10 honeybees to compute the c-val-\nues reported in Table 5. As can be seen, 6 of the 10 values\nwere .20 or lower, indicating improbable PCC indices. Not\nsurprisingly, the c-value for the 10th bee was high (1.0 for\nFinally, as with the original analyses above, OOM permits\nthe researcher to focus on the individual bees under investi-\ngation as well as allows the researcher to examine the overall\ndata, even with this type of pattern. The results for all 10 bees\nyielded an impressive PCC index of 75.45% when compar-\ning all possible pairs of IVI times for the 12 trials. The\naccompanying c-value was also impressively low (<.001).\nComparative ordinal patterns can also be constructed and\nevaluated to support the equality pattern shown in Figure 6.\nFor instance, a monotonically decreasing pattern from Trials\n1 through 12, with the imprecision setting of \u00b1120 s, yielded\nTellingly, not one randomized PCC value equaled or\nexceeded 75.45%, the result for the equivalence pattern in\nFigure 6. Moreover, the individual PCC indices were below\nbelow 30%. Similarly dismal results were obtained when\nexamining a monotonically increasing pattern across the 12\ntrials (overall PCC = 11.36, c-value = .69). In summary, the\nIVI times for the free-flying (non-frustrated) honeybees con-\nformed well to the ordinal pattern of equivalence in Figure 6\nwith the imprecision setting of \u00b1120 s. Data for only 1 of the\n10 bees clearly did not fit this pattern. All other individual\nPCC indices were 59% or higher, and five were at least 80%\n(see Table 5).\nComparing Groups\nData from repeated measures and between-participants\nexperimental designs can be combined in one analysis com-\nmonly referred to as a split-plot ANOVA, although it is\nsometimes referred to as a mixed-design ANOVA (Maxwell\nferent groups of honeybees, and when compared across the\n12 trials, constitute a 2 \u00d7 (12) split-plot, factorial design. The\nprimary reason for creating a factorial design is to assess the\ninteraction between the two variables. The main effects may\nalso be of interest but are often considered secondary and\nmust be interpreted in the context of the interaction. With\nANOVA, a statistically significant interaction is followed by\neither a simple-main-effects breakdown or the construction\nof interaction contrasts to understand the exact nature of the\neffect. Simple-main-effect breakdowns are more prevalent in\nthe literature, but they conflate the variance of the interaction\nwith the variance from one of the main effects. Interaction\ncontrasts, by comparison, are \"pure\" follow-up tests of the\ninteraction and have consequently been endorsed by a num-\nber of prominent methodologists (Harris, 1994; Rosnow &\nRosenthal, 1995). An interaction contrast essentially\nTable 5.

PCC = Percent Correct Classification.\ndescribes how the pattern of means for one of the indepen-\ndent variables differs across levels of the other independent\nvariable. For example, for Craig et al.'s data, a positive linear\ntrend in the IVI means across all 12 trials for the frustrated\nhoneybees could be contrasted with a negative linear trend\nfor the free-flying bees.\nAnalysis of split-plot designs in Observation Oriented\nModeling and the OOM software is akin to testing an interac-\ntion contrast, except the analysis is not based on means and\nvariances and does not involve the estimation of population\nparameters. As with the OOM analyses above, ordinal pat-\nterns are constructed and then evaluated against the observa-\ntions themselves. Beginning with free-flying bees, recall the\nordinal pattern in Figure 6 (with the \u00b1120 s imprecision set-\nting) was a fairly accurate representation of the IVI times:\nconformed to this pattern at least reasonably well. In the spirit\nof an interaction contrast, how well does this pattern fit the\nIVI times for the frustrated honeybees? The results indicated\nalthough the IVI times for the fifth frustrated honeybee (see\nIVI times from three other frustrated honeybees were also\nsomewhat consistent with the pattern (PCCs = 61%-68%),\nbut a small majority nonetheless were not consistent with the\npattern (i.e., six frustrated bees with PCCs < 50%).\nDrawing on the original analyses above for the frustrated\nbees, an alternative competing pattern is shown in Figure 7.As\ncan be seen, the IVI times are expected to be relatively stable\nacross the first six trials and then increase monotonically from\nTrials 7 through 12. Again, the imprecision setting can be\nused, and for this analysis, any increases in IVI times for the\nlast 6 trials must therefore exceed 120 s to be considered as\ncorrect classifications. The overall results for the frustrated\nhoneybees using this ordinal pattern were good, but not highly\nand sixth bees' IVI times (see Table 1) did not fit the pattern\nvery well (PCCs < 52%), whereas the remaining majority of\nindividual IVI times yielded PCC indices that exceeded 60%.\nEvaluating the IVI times for the free-flying honeybees on\nthe basis of the predicted ordinal pattern in Figure 7 yielded\nPCC indices for the 10 free-flying bees were all below 50%,\nwith seven values below 30%. Comparing the two distribu-\ntions of overall PCC indices from the randomization test of\neach analysis furthermore revealed that an absolute differ-\nbetween the overall PCC indices for the frustrated and free-\nflying bees was thus less than .001.\nIn summary, the free-flying honeybees returned to the\nmechanical flower at a fairly steady rate (\u00b1120 s), as mea-\nsured by their IVI times. Only one bee showed a high degree\nof variability in her IVI times, and no discernable pattern was\nnoticeable in her observations. A slight majority of the frus-\ntrated honeybees did not conform to the equivalent ordinal\npattern (see Figure 6) that captured the free-flying bees so\nwell. The ordinal pattern in Figure 7 offered a better explana-\ntion of the observations for these bees as it demarcated when\nthey were frustrated by being trapped in the flower after the\nsixth trial. The IVI times for a slight majority of the bees (6\nof the 10 bees) conformed to this predicted pattern with an\nimprecision setting of \u00b1120 s. By successfully contrasting\nthe patterns of observations for the free-flying and frus-\ntrated honeybees, results from these analyses support Craig\net al.'s theoretical goal of demonstrating the occurrence of\nlearning.\nDiscussion\nComparing parametric ANOVA with OPA in the novel analy-\nsis of data from Craig et al.'s (2012) study revealed a number\nof distinct advantages for the latter approach. First and fore-\nmost was the relative ease of conducting the analyses. When\nperforming a repeated measures ANOVA, a seemingly\nambiguous choice must be made between the traditional uni-\nvariate, multivariate, and mixed-model approaches toward\nanalyzing the data. Interestingly, this choice was made aca-\ndemic for Craig et al.'s data because of insufficient degrees of\nfreedom for computing the omnibus test statistics for the mul-\ntivariate and mixed-model approaches. Despite its many limi-\ntations, the traditional univariate approach therefore had to be\nused and one of the adjustments for Type I error inflation\n(e.g., Greenhouse\u00adGeiger) chosen and applied. The necessity\nof these adjustments in turn points to the sensitivity of the\nunivariate F test to violations of assumptions, particularly the\nFigure 7. Predicted pattern of IVI times for each honeybee\nacross the 12 trials.\nNote. IVI times are expected to be relatively stable across the first six\ntrials and then increase monotonically across the final six trials.\nIVI = Inter-Visit-Intervals.\nsphericity assumption. Moreover, the analysis ignored the\nmissing data problem, the 3,600 values, and the numerous\ninfluential IVI times. Addressing these issues would require\ndifficult and sometimes assumption-laden decisions to make\nthe data more suitable for analysis, including analyses involv-\ning more specific hypotheses about the 12 means. The con-\nclusion is that conducting a repeated measures ANOVA for\neven a straightforward experimental design such as Craig\net al.'s can be a complicated statistical affair.\nBy comparison, the analyses in the OOM software were\nsimple and unambiguous. The expected pattern of ordinal\nrelations was defined for the group of honeybees being ana-\nlyzed, and the conformity between the actual observations\nand pattern for each bee was summarized with the PCC\nindex. A simple, assumption-free and distribution-free ran-\ndomization test was used in an entirely secondary role to\nhelp evaluate each individual and group-level PCC index.\nThe homogeneity of treatment-difference population vari-\nances (sphericity) assumption and other assumptions under-\nlying repeated measures ANOVA were therefore avoided\nentirely. The PCC index itself is transparent and readily\ninterpretable by scientists and lay people alike. The 2 value\nfor the first group of honeybees analyzed above (the \"frus-\ntrated\" group) was equal to .37, indicating 37% overlap\nbetween the trials (the independent variable) and the IVI\ntimes (the dependent variable). It is difficult to interpret\nexactly what this measure of effect size means without the\naid of arbitrary conventions (e.g., Cohen's, 1988; Ferguson,\n2009), and it is impossible to apply this effect size to any\ngiven bee in the sample. The individual PCC indices, how-\never, are clearly interpretable, ranging from 0% to 100%, and\nindicate how well a bee's IVI times matched the predicted\nordinal pattern. All that is needed is the predicted pattern and\nthe options chosen to compute the PCC index (i.e., the adja-\ncent or complete options, and the imprecision value); other-\nwise, it requires no special knowledge or conventions to be\ninterpreted and conveyed to a lay person. Its meaning can be\nmade even more obvious when presented with a graphic like\nFigure 3. Recent scholarship (Kazdin, 1999; Thompson,\n2002) points to the importance of transparent indices of prac-\ntical and clinical \"significance\" (or relevance), and the PCC\nindex and visual features of OPA are well suited for convey-\ning such information.\nThe capability of examining all of the honeybees' IVI\ntimes as a group as well as examining each individual bee is\nanother advantage of the Observation Oriented Modeling\napproach. This is particularly important for Craig et al.\nbecause their goal, like most scientists, was abduction rather\nthan statistical inference. The predicted ordinal patterns were\nbased on simple laws of learning derived from other species\n(e.g., decreasing run times for a rat in a maze across trials;\nGreenough, Madden, & Fleischmann, 1972). The laws are\ngeneral in the sense that they should apply to any given hon-\neybee, not because they are descriptions of population\nparameters. In other words, the laws are causal, and the\ncauses inhere in the honeybees themselves, not in abstract\npopulation parameters. Another way to understand the point\nbeing made here is that in repeated measures ANOVA, the\ngoal is to describe patterns of sample and inferred population\nmeans, and these patterns may not match a single honeybee's\npattern of IVI times. For Craig et al., the proper level of anal-\nysis (Trafimow, 2014) is the individual bee, lest in describing\nthe average, they end up describing \"nobody in particular\"\nSeeking an inference to best explanation (i.e., abduction),\nit is noteworthy an alternative predicted pattern for the frus-\ntrated group of bees was constructed. Specifically, the origi-\nnal predicted decline in IVI times for the first six trials was\nreplaced by an unchanging ordinal pattern (\u00b1120 s), and then\nthe frustrated and free-flying bees were compared with regard\nto the new pattern. The unchanging part of the pattern can be\nexplained sufficiently when considering the study more\nclosely. There is a limit to how fast honeybees can fly, and\neach bee must make her way through the active hive to unload\nher crop. Such factors may essentially cancel out any\ndecreases in IVI times across the first six trials due to learn-\ning. In addition, prior to data collection, Craig et al. were\nobliged to shape multiple participants' responding in the arti-\nficial flower. After participants learned to reliably respond,\ntwo participants were concurrently run and the remaining\ntrained participants were allowed to revisit the artificial\nflower before the next two participants' data collection com-\nmenced. In short, the amount of pre-training was not con-\ntrolledbetweenparticipants,norwasthenumberofreinforcers\nand returns to the artificial flower. Consequently, the bees\nmay have had sufficient pre-training such that decreases in\nIVI times across the first six trials would be minimal, at best,\na conjecture supported by the relatively stable IVI times for\nthe free-flying bees. Additional experimental work would be\nrequired to fully support these explanations, but the point is\nclear: In Observation Oriented Modeling, traditional statisti-\ncal concerns are minimized, whereas efforts to seek theoreti-\ncal explanations are magnified.\nAnother statistical issue that was eschewed in the OOM\nsoftware was the influence of outliers in Craig et al.'s data.\nThe analyses reported above were based on ordinal rela-\ntions between trials and could therefore be regarded as a\ntype of nonparametric statistical analysis, without the\nnecessity of estimating population parameters. When con-\nsidering the bees individually or all together in the context\nof the predicted ordinal pattern, it is difficult to relate the\nordinal analysis to any specific nonparametric technique.\nFriedman's Test and Kendall's W (Siegel, 1956), for\ninstance, are nonparametric alternatives to repeated mea-\nsures ANOVA, but they are based on analysis of ranks and\ndo not provide the means for assessing predicted ordinal\npatterns such as those posited by Craig et al. Nonetheless, it\nis well known that nonparametric statistics are generally\nless restricted by assumptions and are relatively immune to\nOOM software shares these advantages as it provides a\nflexible method for testing complex ordinal patterns that\ncan be defined and assessed visually (e.g., see Figure 3) and\nnumerically (viz., the PCC indices) for each case or for all\nthe cases combined. Thorngate and Carroll (1986) long ago\ndescribed and called for such ordinal methods they hoped\nwould return the emphasis of theory and analysis to indi-\nviduals and away from aggregate statistics and the estima-\ntion of abstract population parameters. Thorngate and\nEdmonds (2013) provide more recent examples of how\ntheir own OPA technique can be used to model crime rates\nand ratings of happiness.\nIt should be mentioned in closing that OPA can be used\nto test predicted parametric patterns, such as linear or qua-\ndratic functions. Describing how this is done is beyond the\nscope of this article, but it entails testing ordinal patterns\nfor difference scores (assuming equal intervals between\nobservations) using the imprecision option if necessary.\nSpecific parametric predictions can moreover be tested. For\ninstance, suppose Craig et al. possessed sufficient experi-\nmental control and theoretical power to predict the exact\nIVI values for each honeybee. The predicted values could\nbe compared with the actual values across all 12 trials either\nexactly or within a set range (e.g., \u00b110 s) to obtain the PCC\nindices and c-values for each bee and for all of the observa-\ntions combined. The techniques demonstrated in this article\nare thus flexible and capable of modeling different types of\ndata and a wide array of patterns. These techniques are also\neasy to use and yield results that are transparent and readily\ninterpretable.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
