Familial risk of diabetes was\nclassified as average, moderate, or high. The prevalence and the odds of having diabetes were\nestimated for each risk class after accounting for other risk factors.\nRESULTS -- Overall, 69.8% of the U.S. adults were in the average, 22.7% in the moderate,\nand 7.5% in the high familial risk for diabetes. The crude prevalence of diabetes for each risk class\nwas 5.9, 14.8, and 30%, respectively. The graded association between familial risk and preva-\nlence of diabetes remained even after accounting for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, hypertension,\nincome, and education. Versus people in the average risk class, independently of other risk\nfactors considered, the odds of having diabetes for people in the moderate and high familial risk\ncategories were, respectively, 2.3 and 5.5 times higher.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S. population, family history of diabetes has a significant,\nindependent, and graded association with the prevalence of diabetes. This association not only\nhighlights the importance of shared genes and environment in diabetes but also opens the\npossibility of formally adding family history to public health strategies aimed at detecting and\npreventing the disease.\nDiabetes is a complex metabolic dis-\nease characterized by persistently\nelevated concentrations of glucose\nin the blood caused by the autoimmune\ndestruction of the pancreatic -cells (type\n1) or by insulin resistance coupled with\nrelative insulin deficiency (type 2).

The total\ncost of diabetes in the U.S. for 2002 was\nEnvironments with plentiful food and\nscarce opportunities for physical activity\nare well suited for the development of\nobesity and ultimately type 2 diabetes.\nNevertheless, the development of type 2\ndiabetes in such environments also re-\nquires a permissive genetic component.\nIn this regard, several genetic variants re-\nlated to the risk for diabetes have been\nreported, but their use to estimate diabe-\ntes risk in populations is limited (5\u00ad7).\nEven so, the accumulation of genetic in-\nformation relative to diabetes has the po-\ntential to become a very effective public\nhealth tool in the near future. Meanwhile,\nwe must rely on the use of family history\nas a basic approach that clearly hints at\nsuch public health potential (8,9). Family\nhistory is relatively easy to obtain and\nconveniently conveys information on\ngenes and environment shared by close\nThe association between family his-\ntory of diabetes and risk for the disease\ncent studies have shown the graded and\nindependent contribution of a positive\nfamily history to the increasing risk for\ndiabetes in the U.S. population (13\u00ad15).\nQuestions remain, however, on the pub-\nlic health applications of this knowledge:\n1) What is the best way to incorporate\nfamily history into the already populated\nlist of risk factors for diabetes? 2) Can\nfamily history be used effectively to im-\nprove the detection and prevention of di-\nabetes in the U.S. population? The\nanswers to these questions would benefit\ngreatly from a thorough analysis of the\nassociation between family history and the\nprevalence of diabetes using a large repre-\nsentative sample of the U.S. population.\nIn this study, we provide a brief but\ndetailed analysis of the association be-\ntween family history of diabetes and the\nprevalence of the disease in the U.S. adult\npopulation. Our objective is to test the\nrelative strength and independence of this\nassociation after accounting for well-\nknown risk factors for diabetes. In partic-\nular, we examine the effect of family\nhistory on the prevalence of diabetes\nalong a broad range of variation of two\nwell-established risk factors: age and BMI.\n                                                \nFrom the National Office of Public Health Genomics, Coordinating Center for Health Promotion, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Rodolfo Valdez, PhD, National Office of Public Health\nGenomics, Coordinating Center for Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nBuford Hwy., NE, Mailstop K-89, Atlanta, GA 30341.

People selected for\nthe survey are invited to a home interview\nand those who complete the interview are\nthen invited to a mobile clinic for a series\nof physical and laboratory examinations\n(assignment to morning or afternoon vis-\nits to the clinic is random) (16).\nSample and study population\nalso received a physical examination,\nined in the morning. The morning sample\nis important for conditions such as diabe-\ntes, for which assessment requires an\novernight fasting period. The design of\nthe study, through the use of sample\nweights, allows for the calculation of na-\ntional estimates from both the entire in-\nterview sample and the morning sample.\nThese estimates are for a typical year\nwithin the 6-year period.\nMain variables\nDiabetes cases were classified as diag-\nnosed (participant reported receiving a\ndiagnosis of diabetes from a health care\nprofessional) or undiagnosed (examina-\ntion from NHANES revealed a fasting glu-\ncose 126 mg/dl in people who reported\nno previous diagnosis of diabetes) (1).\nThe diabetes status of women who re-\nported just a previous diagnosis of gesta-\ntional diabetes was determined by their\nblood fasting glucose. The total number of\ncases of diabetes was calculated by adding\nthe previously diagnosed cases to the newly\ndetected cases from the morning sample.\nThere were no attempts to distinguish be-\nTable 1--Crude prevalence of diabetes according to diagnosis status and selected variables (NHANES, 1999\u00ad2004)\nPrevalence (%)\nn (%)\nDiagnosed\nUndiagnosed\nTotal\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nHypertension\nEducation\nHousehold income\nFamilial risk\n*Number of adults (aged 18 years) interviewed.

If the\nanswer was \"yes,\" then they were asked,\nwhich family member? The possible an-\nswers by multiple-choice were mother,\nfather, mother's mother, mother's father,\nfather's mother, father's father, brother,\nsister, other, refused, or don't know. The\nrisk of diabetes according to family his-\ntory was stratified in three levels as fol-\nlows: 1) high: at least two first-degree\nrelatives or one first-degree and at least\ntwo second-degree relatives with diabetes\nfrom the same lineage; 2) moderate: just\none first-degree and one second-degree\nrelative with diabetes, or only one first-\ndegree relative with diabetes, or at least\ntwo second-degree relatives with diabetes\nfrom the same maternal or paternal line;\nor 3) average: no family history of diabetes\nor, at most, one second-degree relative\nCovariates\nStanding height was measured, to the\nnearest millimeter, with a fixed stadiom-\neter. Weight was measured in pounds\nwith a digital scale and converted to kilo-\ngrams. BMI was calculated as weight in\nkilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared. Blood pressure (systolic or dia-\nstolic) was measured three and sometimes\nfour times, after a 5-min rest. The first\nreading was ignored and the average of\nthe last two or three determinations was\nrecorded as the blood pressure (16). Hy-\npertension was defined as a diastolic\nblood pressure 90 mmHg or a systolic\nblood pressure 140 mmHg or the ac-\nknowledgment of treatment for high\nblood pressure (18).\nThis study reports the prevalence of\nracial groups: non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American\n(the only Hispanic group nationally rep-\nresented in NHANES); four levels of edu-\ncation: less than high school, high school,\nmore than high school, and unknown;\nknown; and two categories for blood pres-\nsure: hypertensive and nonhypertensive.\nExclusions\nIn addition to excluding participants\nyounger than 18 years, we excluded people\nwiththefollowingcharacteristics:pregnant,\nunknown diabetes status, unmeasured\nheightorweight,fastingperiodunder8hor\nover 24 h, or a missing family history of\ndiabetes. The net sample for this study was\nparticipants with valid glucose data from\nthe morning physical examination.\nAnalyses\nThe data were handled using SAS version\n9.1 (19), and the analyses were performed\nusing SUDAAN version 9 (20). All analy-\nses followed a methodology that was spe-\ncific for complex surveys. In complex\nsurveys like NHANES, participants are se-\nlected at random, but the probability of\nselection is not the same for all partici-\npants. To account for the differences in\nthe probability of selection and the design\nof the survey, each participant is assigned\na statistical weight that must be included\nin all analyses to obtain unbiased esti-\nmates. In this study, the prevalence of di-\nagnosed diabetes was estimated among all\nparticipants with an assigned interview\nweight; the prevalence of undiagnosed di-\nabetes was estimated only among partici-\npants with assigned morning weights;\nand the total prevalence of diabetes was\nestimated by combining participants with\ndiagnosed diabetes (interview weights)\nand all participants in the morning sam-\nple whose diabetes status was assessed at\nthe Mobile Exam Center under fasting\nconditions (morning weights).\nAdjusted odd ratios were obtained\nby multiple logistic regression models.\nAge in years\nPercent\nBMI\nPercent\nA\nB\nFigure 1--Adjusted prevalence (predicted marginals) for diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes by\nage (A: controlling for BMI, sex, ethnicity, and education) and BMI (B: controlling for age, sex,\nethnicity, and education) (NHANES, 1999\u00ad2004). There were no participants in the lowest BMI\ncategory with a high familial risk. f, High familial risk; , moderate familial risk; E, average\nfamilial risk (see text for statistical significance).\nFamily history and prevalence of diabetes\nAdjusted prevalence data were obtained\nby predicted marginals (multivariate-\nadjusted rates expressed as a percent-\nage) (21). Age and BMI were included in\nall regression models as continuous\nvariables.\nRESULTS -- The crude prevalence of\ndiabetes (diagnosed, undiagnosed, and\ncombined) is shown in Table 1 by several\ndemographic and socioeconomic vari-\nables, BMI, hypertension, and familial\nrisk of diabetes. In each category, the\ncrude prevalence of diabetes displayed\nwell-established trends: It increased with\nage, it showed minor sex differences and\nmajor racial/ethnic differences (non-\nHispanic whites and Mexican Americans\nshowed similar prevalence, but the latter\nwere a much younger population), it de-\ncreased as education and income in-\ncreased, it increased with BMI, and it\nwas much more prevalent among the\nhypertensive.\nOverall, the weighted distribution of\nthe U.S. population according to familial\nrisk of diabetes was as follows: 22.7%\nwere in the moderate and 7.5% in the\nhigh familial risk category. The rest were\nin the average familial risk category (not\nshown in tables). These weighted propor-\ntions varied slightly for adult non-\nHispanic whites: 22.1% in the moderate\nand 6.3% in the high-risk category. These\nproportions increased to 25.4% for mod-\nerate and 11.5% for high familial risk in\nadult non-Hispanic blacks and to 25.7%\nfor moderate and 10.3% for high familial\nrisk among adult Mexican Americans.\nThus, there was a high familial risk in 1 of\n16 non-Hispanic white adults and in 1 of\n10 non-Hispanic black or Mexican Amer-\nican adults.\nThe crude prevalence of diabetes is\nshown in Table 2 across the same vari-\nables included in Table 1, but this time,\neach category of diabetes status was sub-\ndivided into the three categories for famil-\nial risk. Except for a few instances of no\ndata in the low BMI category, probably\ndue to the small number of participants,\nthe prevalence of diabetes increased with\nfamilial risk within each stratum for each\nvariable. Overall, the crude prevalence of\ndiagnosed diabetes was 3.8% in the group\nwith average risk, but it increased to\n24.3% in the group with high risk. Simi-\nlarly, the crude total prevalence of diabe-\ntes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) increased\nthird level of family risk.\nGiven the strong influences of age and\nBMI on the prevalence of diabetes, we\ntested separately the influence of familial\nrisk stratification on the prevalence of di-\nabetes across commonly used age and\nBMI categories, while controlling for\nother key variables (Fig. 1). In virtually\nevery stratum of age (Fig. 1A) and BMI\n(Fig. 1B), there was a clear stratification of\nrisk for diabetes according to family his-\ntory. Versus the average-risk category, the\nadjusted overall prevalence of diabetes in\neach case was significantly higher for the\nhigh and the moderate familial risk cate-\nFinally, unadjusted and sequentially\nadjusted odd ratios for diabetes are shown\nin Fig. 2. According to this figure, people\nwith moderate familial risk, indepen-\ndently of several important covariates,\nhad between two and three times the odds\nof having diabetes as did people whose\nfamilial risk was average. In contrast, de-\npending on the factors accounted for,\npeople with high familial risk had five to\nseven times the odds of having diabetes as\npeople with average familial risk.\nCONCLUSIONS -- This study has\nshown in detail that family history of dia-\nbeteshasagradedassociationwiththeprev-\nalence of diabetes in the U.S. population\nand that this association is detectable within\nstrata of several well-established risk factors\nfor diabetes. Moreover, the risk of diabetes\nimposed by family history is evident along a\nbroad range of adult ages and BMI, even\nafter adjusting for relevant covariates. With\nthese results, this study provides 1) defini-\ntive evidence of the independence and sig-\nnificance of the association between family\nhistory and the prevalence of diabetes in the\nU.S. population and 2) reliable estimates of\nthe prevalence of familial risk of diabetes in\nthe U.S. population: about 1 of every 3\nadultshasamoderatetohighriskandabout\n1 of every 13 adults has a high risk as deter-\nmined by the algorithm we used\ncould be expanded to include other first-\nand second-degree relatives (sons, daugh-\nters, aunts, and uncles).\nPrevious studies have indicated that,\nversus people without a family history of\ndiabetes, those who have a family history\nof diabetes are two to six times as likely to\nhave type 2 diabetes (9). More specifi-\ncally, a recent study based on NHANES\ndata found that 1) family history of diabe-\ntes was significantly and independently\nassociated with diabetes in U.S. adults\n(based on self-reports) and 2) the strength\nof the association was related to the type\nand number of relatives involved (13).\nEven though the definitions of family his-\ntory are not comparable, our study is in\nagreement with this previous study. Our\nresults add the information that a strati-\nfied familial risk of diabetes can be linked\nnot only to the prevalence of diabetes de-\ntected from self-reports, but also to the\nprevalence of undiagnosed and diagnosed\nOdds Ratio\nFigure 2--Adjusted odds ratios for diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) according to familial\njusted); Model 2 (sex); Model 3 (sex, race/ethnicity); Model 4 (sex, race/ethnicity, age); Model 5\n(sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI); Model 6 (sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, hypertension); Model 7\n(sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, hypertension, education); Model 8 (sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI,\nhypertension, household income). f, High familial risk; , moderate familial risk; continuous\nline, average familial risk (reference).\nValdez and Associates\ndiabetes, separately or combined. This\nsuggests that the association between\nfamily history of diabetes and the preva-\nlence is not due to recall bias among those\nwho already know that they have the dis-\nease. It cannot be proven because NHANES\ncontains no information on whether or\nnot the knowledge of family history pre-\nceded the diagnosis of diabetes. However,\nour results (Table 1) indicate that family\nhistory might influence the knowledge of\nhaving diabetes. Overall, undiagnosed\ncases constituted about one-third of the\ntotal cases of diabetes. This proportion di-\nminished to about one-fourth among the\nmoderate and high familial risk catego-\nries. In other words, people with diabetes\nare more likely to know that they have the\ndisease when they are at an elevated famil-\nial risk.\nA previous NHANES-based study an-\nticipated the findings of the present study\n(14), but this earlier study was not de-\nsigned to be a direct test of the indepen-\ndence of the association between family\nhistory and prevalence of diabetes.\nRather, it was designed to test the use of\nfamily history and BMI as screening tools\nfor undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. pop-\nulation. Nevertheless, with the same risk\nstratification, this previous study showed\nthat the prevalence of diabetes (diagnosed\nor undiagnosed) is positively associated\nwith familial risk. Our study has con-\nfirmed these results and has provided a\ndetailed account of the strength and inde-\npendence of the association between fa-\nmilial risk and the prevalence of diabetes\n(diagnosed, undiagnosed, and combined)\nin the U.S. population.\nIn conclusion, having demonstrated\nthat family history of diabetes is indeed a\npowerful independent risk factor for the\ndisease, our efforts should now be di-\nrected toward translating this knowledge\nfor use in public health programs de-\nsigned to detect and prevent diabetes. For\nthat translation to occur, however, further\nresearch is needed to give the use of family\nhistory a place as a public health strategy\nagainst diabetes: First, the use of family\nhistory as a predictor should be tested\nmore often in large prospective studies,\njust to be certain that the ascertainment of\nthe familial risk actually precedes the dis-\nease status. Second, family history of dia-\nbetes should be considered not as a\ndichotomous variable (present/absent)\nbut rather as a variable whose influence\non the disease is graded. Third, a univer-\nsally agreed-upon definition of family his-\ntory of diabetes that is also simple to\ncollect would be necessary to establish\nand compare familial risk across a variety\nof populations. Fourth, our results show\nthat stratified familial risk, combined with\nother readily available indicators of diabe-\ntes risk, could be a great tool to identify\nsegments of the population at high risk for\nthe disease. The incorporation of family\nhistory into screening and prevention\nprograms for diabetes, however, needs to\nbe accomplished as rigorously as possible.\nThat is, the value added by family history to\nthese programs must be evaluated and\nfound to be significant and cost-effective\nReferences\n1.
