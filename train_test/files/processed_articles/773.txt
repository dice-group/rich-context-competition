    "abstract": "Abstract: This paper reviews the economic implications of employer and individual health insurance\nmandates. Although the cost of meeting an employer mandate is nominally paid by employers, in the\nlong run much of the cost may be shifted backward to employees in the form of lower wages. We also\ncompare the consequences of hypothetical employer and individual health insurance mandates for\nfamilies with different income levels. Depending on their structure, an employer mandate may be\nmore or less progressive than an individual mandate.\nCurrent efforts to reform the American health care system have two\nmajor objectives. First, all Americans are to have adequate health\ninsurance coverage, a goal commonly defined as universal coverage.\nSecond, the delivery of health care is to be rearranged to make it more\nefficient; that is, the appropriate health care, and only the appropriate care,\nis to be given to patients at the lowest feasible cost.\nBoth of these objectives are to be achieved by rearranging the way\nAmerican health care is financed. When exasperated commentators la-\nment that our current debate on health reform is \"all about money,\" they\nare literally correct, but they miss the mark. A restructuring of our vast\nhealth care delivery system cannot be achieved through direct government\nedict in this country. That restructuring will be sought as a natural response\nto the new financial incentives inherent in a rearranged flow of money.\nThat flow of money can be broken down into two major streams. First,\nmoney must be collected into one or several privately or publicly adminis-\ntered insurance funds. Second, money must be disbursed from those collec-\ntive insurance funds to the providers of health care. The first facet is\ngenerally referred to as the financing of health care. The second embraces\nthe issues of reimbursement and cost control.\nThis paper focuses on the financing of health care. We begin our discus-\nsion with some remarks on certain basic facts of life regarding health care\nfinancing--facts that are widely perceived as troublesome and often\navoided. In the next section we explore in some depth the economist's\nstandard view of one highly controversial method of financing health care:\na mandate upon employers to procure health insurance for their employees\nand their dependents. Next we present several simulations that compare\nthe effects of a hypothetical employer mandate with a hypothetical individ-\nual mandate on U.S. households. Finally, we recommend a compromise\nbetween an employer and an individual mandate: premiums calculated as a\nflat percentage levy on the gross wages of the individual employee but\ncollected at the nexus of the payroll.\nFacts Of Life In Health Care Financing\nPoliticians contemplating the reform of our health care system cannot\nrun away from certain basic facts of life that are so obvious that they seem\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Government and business are\nmere intermediaries in this flow. (2) If there is to be universal health\ninsurance coverage, substantial additional transfers of funds must be made\nfrom households in the upper half of the nation's income distribution to\nhouseholds in the lower half. (3) To achieve truly universal health insur-\nance coverage, households must be mandated to procure that coverage or\nemployers must be mandated to procure it on behalf of households.\nExtracting money from households. The transfer of money from pri-\nvate households to the providers of health care can be achieved by three\ndistinct methods, which span the set of feasible approaches.\nUnder the first approach, individual households purchase individual\ninsurance policies directly from private insurance carriers or seek individual\ncoverage through group policies procured by some private association,\npossibly with the support of public subsidies. Less than 10 percent of the\nnonelderly U.S. population currently procures private health insurance this\nway, so far without any public subsidy whatsoever.1 In fact, nowhere in the\nworld is this the predominant mode of health care financing.\nUnder the second approach, government taxes private households and\nfunnels these taxes to an insurance fund. This approach is favored in\nCanada and in many European countries. But even in the United States\nmore than 42 percent of all national health spending now follows this\nroute, covering some sixty-three million Americans, or 25 percent of the\npopulation. This public system includes Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid\nfor the poor, the purely socialized health systems of the Department of\nVeterans Affairs, and sundry delivery systems of the Public Health Service.\nFinally, under the third approach, private and public employers procure\ninsurance coverage from private or public insurance carriers. This employ-\nment-based approach is the backbone of the social insurance systems of\nEurope, Latin America, and Asia, where the employer's participation in\nhealth care financing has long been mandatory. In the United States about\n71 percent of the nonelderly population obtains insurance coverage by this\nindirect route, although not so far on a mandatory basis nor in a way that\nmakes the insurance portable (as it is under social insurance). Of course,\nwhen employers finance health care, they always recoup their outlays,\ndollar for dollar, either in the form of higher prices for consumption goods\nor through reductions in take-home pay to employees, or both. It follows\nthat an outright mandate on business to act as this sort of pumping station\nindirectly imposes fiscal levies on private households as well. The empirical\nquestion, to be explored further in this paper, is which households are made\nto bear what share of the burden.\nIf one surveyed economists on the question of which of these three\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As a matter of principle, economists advocate arrangements\nunder which consumers, producers, and politicians make decisions based on\nincentives that meet two criteria: (1) the incentives are distorted as little as\npossible by taxation, and (2) the parties involved are as aware of the\nincentives as they can possibly be. It follows from this principle that\nindividual households should purchase their own health insurance using\ntheir after-tax income and that families with insufficient means to purchase\ncoverage on their own be subsidized by highly visible, tax-financed public\nsubsidies that reflect the general public's charitable sentiments.\nSubsidizing poor households. Unfortunately, the public subsidies re-\nquired to help poor households buy coverage would not be trivial. A typical\nhealth insurance policy now costs around $2,200 for an individual and close\nto $5,000 for a family of four or more, even ifpurchased at community-rated\npremiums established for large groups of insured people. As the distribution\nof family income in the United States indicates, possibly as many as 20\npercent of American households--and certainly the bottom 15 percent--\nwould have great difficulty absorbing such a premium in their relatively\nmeager budget (Exhibit 1).\nJust where one sets the threshold at which public assistance needs to be\ngiven is, of course, a purely subjective matter. It lies at the heart of our\ncurrent debate on health policy. Commenting on Rep. Jim Cooper's (D-\nTN) well-known reform plan, for example, The New York Times recently\nopined in its lead editorial:\nPercentage Of American Families In Income Categories, 1990\nIncome category\nPercent of families\nCumulative percent\nSource: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-60, no. 174 (1991); cited in J.R.

But that could still mean a family\nuniversal access; we call it merciless.2\nThe New York Times's notion of \"merciful\" health reform implies that\nthe health insurance coverage of close to the entire bottom half of the U.S.\nincome distribution be partially or fully subsidized by the upper half. The\ntotal flow of such subsidies could easily exceed $100 billion, depending\nupon the generosity of the benefit package covered by the insurance, the\ndegree of cost control imposed on providers, and the precise cutoff line for\nthe subsidies. Of course, many such cross-subsidies are already being made\nby our current health system, albeit in a pattern that does not fit any known\nsocial ethic. These subsidies flow helter-skelter, in all directions.\nThe twenty-nine million low-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid\nevidently are beneficiaries of a top-to-bottom income redistribution. So are\nmany low-income elderly Americans enrolled in both Medicare and Medic-\naid. But there are also many well-to-do elderly who extract from Medicare\nmuch more than they deposited in it during their work years and who now\nfind themselves the happy recipients of billions of dollars in outright charity\nfrom below.3 To these subsidized, well-to-do elderly should be added the\nlucky millions of high-income employees whose companies purchase for\nthem health insurance out of pretax income. This is a tax shelter known to\nbestow the bulk of the implied \"tax expenditure\" on the upper-income\ngroups. To families in low tax brackets, this tax shelter means only a\nhandful of dollars; to families in the upper-income groups, it can mean\n$2,000 tax savings toward the purchase of health insurance. According to\ntaxes avoided through this shelter went to families earning $75,000 or\nOne of the common arguments against health reform is that this country\nsimply cannot \"afford\" to subsidize with public funds further millions of\nuninsured low-income Americans. Those who make this argument, how-\never, must somehow come to grips with the fact that for years Congress has\nfunneled to the upper levels of the income distribution more funds in\noutright subsidies or tax expenditures than it would take to subsidize gener-\nously the insurance coverage of all low-income uninsured Americans. Thus,\nthe proposition that we just cannot \"afford\" to fold all of the uninsured\nquickly into mainstream American health insurance is unconvincing. A\nmore accurate statement would be that America's middle and upper classes\nare not now willing to redistribute any more funds to lower-income groups,\nalthough the better-off have no objections to a myriad of hidden cross-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

If policymakers wish all Ameri-\ncans to have portable health insurance coverage, they must mandate that\ncoverage. This is the third basic fact of life in health care reform. Absent a\nmandate, millions of American families would simply choose to remain\nuninsured, even if they could afford to buy insurance with some subsidies\nand some belt tightening. A strategy to remain uninsured is not completely\nreckless, because this nation already has a more or less universal cata-\nstrophic health insurance system: the hospital emergency rooms that are\nobligated to treat all comers, and the hospitals attached to these emergency\nrooms. Although this safety net is neither perfect nor comfortable, its\nexistence is an open invitation to free riding in health care.\nThe simplest but also the most controversial form of such a mandate\nwould be to bestow upon all Americans tax-financed health insurance, say,\non the Medicare model or on the Canadian model. This approach is now\nsaid to be \"off the table,\" because the American public presumably does not\nlike it. Although this may be the case, it takes effort to reconcile that\nperception with the fierce way America's usually rather conservative elderly\nprotect their government-financed, government-run Medicare program. So\njealously is that public program guarded by the elderly that no politician\ndares touch it. Perhaps there is more latent support for such a system for the\nbroader U.S. population than seems apparent, possibly because government\nprograms are more stable and more reliable than private insurance over\ntime. In part, of course, this loyalty to government-run insurance may\nsimply show that the elderly know a good deal when they see one.\nThe only alternatives to mandated, government-financed health insur-\nance for all are (1) a mandate on employers to provide adequate private\ncoverage for all workers (the \"employer mandate\"), or (2) a mandate on\nhouseholds to procure adequate private insurance coverage, either through\npurchase of an individual insurance policy directly from a private carrier or\nthrough a group policy voluntarily made available by an employer or any\nother association of private individuals (the \"individual mandate\").\nThose who would mandate all employers to provide all employees with\nhealth insurance do not do so on the basis of economic principles or on the\nnotion that the losers under a public policy should be fully and explicitly\ninformed of their fate. More probably, these advocates advance the pro-\nposal simply as a political expedient. These experts, such as Alain\nEnthoven, Richard Kronick, and the Jackson Hole Group, can claim to be\nbuilding upon the American tradition of financing health care through the\nworkplace. There is something to that argument. But it is probable as well\nthat these astute students of American health politics found it preferable to\nerect their health reform plan upon a financing scheme that camouflages\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The political theory here seems to\nbe that if the true impact were known to the body politic, health reform\nwould be dead on arrival A similarly pragmatic theory, one must suppose,\nlies at the heart of President Clinton's reliance on the employer mandate,\nwhose basic structure, incidentally, seems to have been copied verbatim\nfrom the dicta of the Jackson Hole Group.\nThose who propose the individual mandate as a means to universal\ncoverage can claim to be inspired by sound economic principles and a\nvision of democracy that would like to see all income transfers among\neconomic classes made highly visible. Unfortunately, that very visibility is\nlikely to create a political barrier to universal coverage. On the one hand,\ncitizens who would be summoned to the cashier's window would be more\nlikely to object if they were taxed explicitly. On the other hand, if low-\nincome American households were required to pay directly for their health\ninsurance coverage, they probably would be much more vocal in their quest\nfor government subsidies than they would be if they were made to pay for\ntheir own health insurance coverage implicitly, through gradual reductions\nin pay raises over time--which is the chief mechanism by which an em-\nployer mandate would most likely be financed in the longer run.\nThe individual mandate triggers the added problem of confronting low-\nincome families with relatively high losses in incremental disposable in-\ncome as earned income rises. For example, suppose insurance for families at\nor below the official poverty line were fully subsidized by the government\nand that subsidy were completely phased out at 200 percent of the poverty\nlevel. Then a family of four would lose a subsidy of about $5,000 (the\ntypical health insurance premium for such a family) as its income rose from\nsubsidy is equivalent to a marginal income tax rate for the loss of health\nAdded to federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, and the phaseout of\nthe earned income credit, the individual mandate thus would present\nmillions of low-income American families with total marginal tax rates in\nexcess of 75 percent. Such high marginal tax rates may well make unem-\nployment and welfare an attractive alternative to working. It would be the\nantithesis to supply-side economics.\nFinally, those who espouse the individual mandate and a speedy move\ntoward universal health insurance coverage must be willing to countenance\na sizable transfer of vouchers to low-income families--on the order of at\nleast $50 billion to $80 billion a year--if universal coverage were to be\nrealized within the next few years. On the other hand, if transfers of this\nmagnitude are not contemplated in connection with an individual man-\ndate, then one implicitly countenances a lengthy and possibly permanent\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Economists find this theory so plausible that they\nrarely seek to explain it to noneconomists, who, alas, typically find the\ntheory quite implausible. As we point out, this divergence of perception\nappears to stem mainly from the length of the time period contemplated.\nBusiness people of the so-called real world tend to posit short time frames in\npredicting their reactions to changes in public policy. In the process they\ntend to abstract unduly from longer-run effects. Economists, on the other\nhand, tend to conduct their inquiries with a method they call \"comparative\nstatics,\" that is, an examination of the changes a public policy stimulus--\nsuch as the imposition of an employer mandate--has triggered in a market\nafter the market has fully adjusted to the new policy, over the longer run.\nEconomists tend to abstract unduly from the short-run dynamics by which\nmarkets actually move from one steady state to the next. The confusion\nsurrounding the debate on employer mandates, and the apparent divide\nbetween economists and noneconomists over the issue, is a result of these\npredilections on the part of both camps.\nThe Economic Theory Of Employer Mandates\nThe economic theory of employer mandates is best understood if one\nimagines a highly competitive labor market in which workers of a given\nlevel of skill sell some of their time in return for wages.

Although this\ngraph may evoke unpleasant memories of college days, practical readers\nfrom the so-called real world may find it worthwhile to invest some time in\nmastering this analytic apparatus. First, it provides clues to the mystery of\nwhy there are so many varying estimates of the \"job loss\" associated with an\nemployer mandate. Second, it also can help to explain why the magnitude\nof the employment effect can sometimes be predicted simply by the politi-\ncal allegiance of the academic or the think tank making the estimate.\nThe vertical axis in Exhibit 2 represents W, the annual wage paid to\nworkers in this market. The horizontal axis represents the total number of\nfull-time-equivalent workers (FTEs) per year offered or sought in this\nmarket. We assume initially that the firms here do not offer their employees\nany fringe benefits at all, so that total debits also represent employees' total\ntake-home pay. Although that assumption is not realistic, no major insights\nare lost by making it, and much ease of graphic exposition is gained.\nIt seems plausible to assume that the market's demand for labor is\ndownward-sloping to the right--that more FTEs will be hired by the\nindustry as total annual wage per FTE falls. The precise shape and position\nof this demand curve depends primarily on two factors. First, other things\nbeing equal, the easier employers in this market find it to substitute labor-\nsaving capital for labor in the production of output, the flatter (the more\nwage-sensitive or \"wage-elastic\") will be the demand curve for labor.5\nSecond, the more price-sensitive is consumers' demand for the products\nproduced by the employers hiring labor in this market, the flatter (the more\nwage-sensitive) will be the employers' demand curve for labor.\nSimilarly, it seems plausible to posit an upward slope for the supply of\nlabor to this market. The higher the wage offered by employers in this\nindustry, the more likely will individuals seek gainful employment in it.\nThe flatter the curve is (the more wage-sensitive), the easier it is to find\nroughly equally lucrative employment elsewhere in the economy, or the\nmore attractive it is simply to stay out of the labor force altogether, perhaps\nbecause good unemployment benefits or welfare support is available.\nSuppose the solid demand and supply curves shown in Exhibit 2 repre-\nsented the behavior of employers and potential employees in this market\nprior to the imposition of an employer mandate. Given the demand and\nsupply curves depicting that behavior, that market would settle down at a\nmarket-clearing wage of W0\n, at which L0\nFTEs would be employed. Econo-\nmists call this situation \"equilibrium.\"\nNow suppose government mandated all employers in the economy to\npurchase for their employees a comprehensive health insurance policy.\nSuppose further that this insurance cost $H per FTE per year. To keep\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Finally, let us assume that the workers supplying\nlabor to this market do not value this mandated fringe benefit as something\ninherent in the job, perhaps because they would be granted an equally good,\ntax-financed package free of charge if they were unemployed.\nOn these assumptions, how would such a mandate alter the market-\nclearing equilibrium in the labor market modeled in Exhibit 2 in the long\nrun, after the market had ample time to adjust fully to the mandate? As\nillustrated, the demand curve in this market would eventually shift down\nvertically by precisely the magnitude of the health insurance premium, $H.\nThis downward shift implies that employers' reaction to the mandate would\nbe an attempt simply to cut the take-home pay per FTE by exactly $H, so\nthat at any given level of employment (L), total compensation, including\nthe premium $H, would be what total compensation had been at that\nemployment level prior to the mandate.\nSome workers employed prior to the mandate would not take this at-\ntempted wage cut lying down. As many as L0\nof them would exit this\nlabor market and possibly quit working altogether. That is what is meant in\nthe media and in Congress by the so-called employment effect or job loss\neffect. As a result of this job loss effect, the new market-clearing take-home\nwage actually would not fall from the original W0\nby the entire amount of\nthe premium, that is, by the full $H. Instead, it would fall only to Wl\n, by an\namount smaller than the premium $H. The explanation for this phenome-\nnon is that part of the premium shock would be absorbed by a reduction in\nemployment rather than a cut in take-home wages.6\nNoneconomists, and particularly business people from the so-called real\nworld, usually do not believe the story implied by Exhibit 2. Few business\npeople would admit that in the face of an employer mandate costing, say,\n$3,000 per employee they would even attempt to cut their workers' wages\nby that amount. Most of them would argue that a good portion of the cost\nwould simply be absorbed by the owners in the form of lower profits or by\nworkers who would be laid off, and many of them would argue that they\nwould simply close their business. Economists should have sympathy for\nthese tales from the real world, but they should not concede too easily.\nFirst, it is not clear how many firms would actually close if all of them\nwere saddled with exactly the same additional cost per employee. This is an\nimportant point. More often than not, the stories of business closings\npresented to policymakers by concerned business people seem to spring\nfrom an imagined scenario in which one firm in the market is saddled with\nthe additional labor cost of an employer mandate, while all other firms in\nthe market remain unscathed. But if all firms in the market were made to\nbear the same additional labor costs, the bulk of them probably would\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In other words, in the longer run\nthe cost of the employer mandate most likely will be shifted backward to\nemployees in a gradual manner that many of them may not even notice.\nSo much for the economic theory of employer mandates. Even at this\nrudimentary level, it becomes obvious why the empirical estimates of the\nemployment effects attributed to the president's employer mandate range\nall over the map: The magnitude of that effect depends crucially on the\nassumed shape of the labor demand and supply curves--on the assumed\nwage-sensitivity (wage-elasticity) of these curves. To gain some insight into\nthis proposition, the reader may wish to retrace Exhibit 2 with the same\ndemand curve, but with a much steeper (wage-insensitive) supply curve\nthat cuts the demand curve at the original equilibrium point. A wage-\ninsensitive (wage-inelastic) supply curve signifies that most workers in this\nmarket would keep on working even after a large cut in take-home pay,\nsimply because working elsewhere or not working at all would remain\nrelatively unattractive. If that assumption is made, it will be seen that the\nsame employer mandate will cause a relatively larger cut in take-home pay\nbut a much more modest job loss, even if the labor supply curve did not shift\noutward.\nOn the other hand, suppose the supply of labor in this market were very\nwage-sensitive (wage-elastic). Here the reader would retrace Exhibit 2 but\nimpose on it a very flat supply curve. It would be found that, in this case, the\nsame employer mandate would cause only a relatively modest cut in take-\nhome pay but a rather large cut in employment. Workers would quickly\nbecome disillusioned and quit this labor market (and perhaps quit working\naltogether), as employers tried to cut their take-home pay. At the extreme,\nif these employees were paid the minimum wage, not a penny of the\npremium $H could be shifted backward.7 The entire effect of the mandate\nwould show up in unemployment or increased total compensation per FTE\n(and, therefore, increased product prices).\nSimilarly, if one retraced Exhibit 2, leaving the supply curve as it is but\npositing a very flat (wage-sensitive) initial labor demand curve (perhaps\none close to being horizontal), then one would discover that the mandate\nwould cause a relatively large cut in both take-home wages and employ-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Employers hiring in this\nlabor market would not tolerate any significant increase in total compensa-\ntion per FTE. Instead, they might simply cut back drastically on production\n(some might even shut down) or switch to labor-saving capital. In that\nsituation, postmandate take-home pay would have declined by virtually the\nentire amount $H; the cost of the mandate would have been fully shifted\nbackward to employees.\nFinally, if the demand for labor were extremely wage-insensitive (very\nsteep), then the wage and employment cuts caused by an employer mandate\nwould be relatively small. In this case, employers could not easily substitute\nlabor-saving capital for labor, or they would lose relatively little sales\nvolume if they raised the prices of their output, or both.\nThe important public policy insight one gains from exercising the model\nin this way is that the estimated wage and job effects attributed to an\nemployer mandate are powerfully driven by the wage-sensitivity posited for\nboth the labor demand and the labor supply curves in U.S. labor markets.\nUnfortunately, the available empirical literature has yielded wide ranges for\nthese wage-sensitivities, which permits analysts to pick and choose, within\nlimits, among the available estimates. In the process, assumptions drive\nconclusions.\nThe preceding model also helps to nail down precisely what economists\nmight mean by \"backward\" or \"forward\" shifting of employer mandates.\nEconomists assume, correctly in most cases, that when employers bargain\nwith workers or their union representatives, the \"price\" employers have in\nmind is always total compensation, which one might define as all of the\ndebits employers must make to the payroll expense account per year and per\nFTE. Strictly in terms of accounting, at any market-clearing equilibrium\n\"price\" for labor it must therefore be tautologically true that take-home pay\nequals total compensation minus the cost (to the employer) of all fringe\nbenefits (mandated or voluntary). In an accounting sense, then, it is always\ntautologically true that, at any point in time, 100 percent of the cost of\nfringe benefits is shifted \"backward\" to employees in the form of lower\ntake-home pay. That is not quite the definition of cost shifting that econo-\nmists have in mind when they discuss the incidence of a new fringe benefit\nmandated on employers. Here economists start with the premandate equi-\nlibrium wage and employment levels and inquire whether, at the new\npostmandate equilibrium, employees' take-home pay has decreased by the\nfull cost of the mandated benefit or by less.\nSeveral other analytic observations should be made about employer\nmandates before we leave this topic. First, the labor supply curves of\nindividual industries are much more wage-sensitive than is the labor supply\ncurve for the economy as a whole. This is nothing but common sense,\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The labor supply\ncurve of that industry is relatively flat. On the other hand, when wages fall\nin every industry in the economy, then there is really no place for workers\nto go but the unemployment line. It follows that the entire economy's labor\nsupply curve will be much steeper--much more wage-inelastic. The practi-\ncal implication is that one should never assess the effect of an employer\nmandate by imagining one single firm, as is so often done in the media or in\ntestimony before Congress. An employer mandate imposed upon only one\nfirm in a town and not on that firm's competitors could easily cause that\none firm to shut down. But to reason thus is to succumb to the famous\nfallacy of composition, that is, the fact that what is true for a single part of a\nsystem may not be true for the system as a whole.\nSecond, what has been illustrated above for an industry that does not\noffer its employees any health insurance also can help us understand what\nan employer mandate would do for an industry that already does offer\nemployees health insurance voluntarily. In a nutshell, if the cost of the\nmandate to employers were identical to the cost already booked by them for\nthe voluntary program, then the mandate would have no impact on that\nindustry. On the other hand, as President Clinton claims, an employer\nmandate might substantially reduce the cost of health insurance per FTE for\nfirms that now provide health insurance. This reduction is to be achieved\nthrough general cost controls on the entire health sector and through the\nelimination of the cost shift by which insured firms now pay for the health\ncare of uninsured Americans. But within the pool of firms that now do\ninsure their employees there would be a redistribution of costs through the\nmechanism of community-rated premiums, which would redistribute\nhealth insurance costs from firms with relatively older or sicker employees\nto firms with a relatively younger and healthier work force.\nFor firms or industries experiencing major reductions in health insurance\ncost per FTE, the demand curve for labor should shift up. If one traced that\neffect in a diagram such as Exhibit 2, one would see both take-home pay\nand employment rise as a result of these labor-cost reductions. Some ana-\nlysts now commenting on the president's health plan have, indeed, factored\nthese positive job and wage effects into their estimates of the overall\nemployment gains or losses associated with the proposed employer man-\ndate. Others have excluded that effect. Their assumption seems to be that\nthe president's cost-control program would in all likelihood fail or that, in\nany event, the premiums paid by industries now insuring their workers\nprobably would not fall significantly. Whatever the rationale or motive for\nsuch inclusions and exclusions in particular studies, we have here yet\nanother source of uncertainty that drives the high variance of job loss\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

A relatively small number of studies have exam-\nined the effects of employment-based government mandates on wages and\nemployment.8 Most support a conclusion that the incidence of an employ-\nment-based mandate falls mainly on employees. In other words, wages tend\nto decline in response to increased mandated benefits by almost the full cost\nof the benefit. The reduction in wages tends to lessen any adverse effect on\nemployment.\nDistributional Effects Of Mandates: A Simulation\nA key issue is how the burden of paying for an employer or an individual\nmandate falls across families with different income levels. To examine the\ndistributional effects, we construct a hypothetical employer mandate and\nan individual mandate and evaluate how they affect the family income\ndistribution. Because our goal here is to illustrate the general distributional\nfeatures of employer and individual mandates, we have constructed hypo-\nthetical mandates that are easy to model with available data, rather than\nones that closely correspond to particular reform proposals.\nThe employer mandate that we examine is similar to the financing\nscheme used for Social Security. We assume that employers and employees\ncontribute a combined total of 9.8 percent of each employee's earnings\ntoward health benefits, subject to maximum earnings of $55,000. The\nmaximum is set at the worker level, rather than an average firm level or a\nfamily level. We assume that the employment-based mandate only applies\nto workers over age eighteen, who work more than ten hours per week, and\nwho are not full-time students. We assume that the incidence of the\nemployment-based mandate falls entirely on workers.\nThe hypothetical individual mandate works as follows. Families are\nrequired to purchase health insurance. We use four family types to deter-\nmine insurance premiums (single individuals, single-parent families, mar-\nried couples without children, and married couples with children). We use\nthe Clinton administration's estimates of the cost of these insurance poli-\ncies.9 Families that have income below the poverty level receive a voucher\nthat covers 80 percent of the cost of their insurance; they are responsible for\ncontributing the remaining 20 percent. To pay for the vouchers, we add a 9\npercent surcharge to the premium contributions for families above the\npoverty level. We have set the parameters of the individual and employer\nmandates so that they raise the same level of revenue. The average contri-\nbution per family with each of these plans is $3,570.\nFor our estimates of the distributional impact of hypothetical employer\nand individual mandates, we base our calculations on the March 1993\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The sample consists of working families whose mem-\nbers are under age sixty-five. From these data we calculate the net benefit\n(benefit minus contribution), average contribution divided by average fam-\nily income, and average net benefit divided by average family income.\nThere are several ways to measure the progressivity of the mandates.\nPremium contributions relative to income provide one indication of the\n\"tax\" burden faced by each income class. But since premium contributions\nare used to provide health benefits, one should take into account the value\nof benefits as well.10 If we value the benefits at the estimated cost of\nproviding them, then the net benefit relative to income provides a broader\nmeasure of the progressivity of the entire program. Exhibits 3 and 4 illus-\ntrate the distributional effects of the programs.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the results of this simulation reveal the employer\nmandate to be more progressive than the individual mandate for these\nhypothetical plans. For example, the bottom decile of the family income\ndistribution would contribute 8 percent of family income ($612) under the\nemployer mandate, and 18 percent of family income ($1,602) under the\nindividual mandate. The main reason for this disparity is that low-income\nfamilies tend to have low labor earnings and thus make relatively low\ncontributions under the employer mandate. With an individual mandate,\nlow-income families that are not in poverty will pay a substantial share of\ntheir income toward health care benefits. On the other hand, under the\nassumed plans high-income families pay substantially more for benefits\nunder the employer mandate than under the individual mandate.\nThe individual and employer mandates look quite similar if the compari-\nDistributional Effects Of Employer And Individual Mandates, By Percentage Of\nFamily Income Paid In Insurance Premiums\nSource: Authors' calculations; see text for details.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These results are more similar than the decile-level\nanalysis because several of the bottom-decile families are not in poverty (for\nexample, many of those composed of single persons).\nTo show that an individual mandate could be made more progressive\nthan an employer mandate, we constructed a second hypothetical individ-\nual mandate. In this scenario we assume that families below the poverty\nlevel receive a subsidy that covers 100 percent of their health insurance\ncosts. This subsidy is gradually phased out for families earning up to 250\npercent of the poverty level.11 Families earning over this amount pay their\nfull premium costs. To pay for the subsidies to low-income families, families\nearning above 250 percent of the poverty level are required to pay a\nsurcharge ranging from 1 percent of income for families with income under\n$70,000 to 5 percent of income for families with income exceeding\n$100,000. It turns out that this hypothetical individual mandate is more\nprogressive than the employer mandate described above. For example,\nbottom-decile families would contribute only 2 percent of family income\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Families in the top 10 percent of the income\ndistribution would contribute 8 percent of income toward their own health\ninsurance and for subsidies for the poor. By contrast, our hypothetical\nemployer mandate would average 8 percent of income for the two bottom\ndeciles, and 6.7 percent for the top decile of the income distribution.\nThe Clinton proposal for an employer mandate, and the various propos-\nals for an individual mandate, no doubt would have distributional effects\ndifferent from the hypothetical plans we have sketched here. The Clinton\nproposal differs from our hypothetical employer mandate in two important\nrespects: (1) the cap is set at the average firm level, rather than the worker\nlevel; and (2) employer contributions are capped at 80 percent of the\nweighted average premium level for families of its workers' type in the\nregion. Both of these features serve to make the Clinton proposal less\nprogressive than our hypothetical employer mandate.\nAny workable individual mandate will differ from the first plan we have\nsketched because the voucher will likely be phased out over a certain\nincome range. Our first hypothetical plan would give a substantial voucher\nto families just under the poverty threshold, but no assistance to families\njust above the threshold. This feature obviously would encourage families\nearning just above the poverty threshold to cut back on their labor supply\nto qualify for a voucher. A common approach to this problem is to gradually\nreduce the value of the voucher as family income rises. But if the voucher\nwere smoothly phased out to avoid labor supply disincentives, it will have\nto be offered to a much higher segment of the income distribution, similar\nto proposed negative income tax plans. This feature would raise the cost of\nan individual mandate while making it more progressive.\nConcluding Observations\nThe main conclusion we draw from these simulations is that the distribu-\ntional consequences of an employer mandate are not necessarily worse than\nthose of an individual mandate, or vice versa. The question therefore arises\nwhether this particular reform feature deserves the center stage that it now\noccupies, and whether reform should be allowed to stumble over a deadlock\non this particular issue. Is there a pragmatic compromise on the matter?\nAlthough American policymakers seem reluctant to look abroad for\ninsights on American health policy, it really is instructive to examine how\nother nations finance their health systems. Unbeknownst apparently to\nmany American politicians and business executives, who claim that health\nspending makes American business uncompetitive in world markets, many\nother nations also finance their health care chiefly through the workplace.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

All of these nations, however, have avoided two\nmajor pitfalls of the current U.S. employment-based system. First, they do\nnot tie an insured family's health insurance to a particular job in a particular\ncompany in a way that makes the family lose that coverage with that\nparticular job. Second, these insurance schemes do not levy flat insurance\npremiums per individual or household, an approach that necessitates the\ncumbersome system of subsidies now built into the president's scheme.\nInstead, these nations extract at the nexus of the payroll merely a flat\npercentage of the individual worker's gross pay. By so doing, these nations\nhave effectively fudged the politically charged dichotomy of \"individual\"\nversus \"employer\" mandates, for their approach could be interpreted as\neither of the two.\nGermany was the first to use that approach; it was introduced there by\nChancellor Bismarck in the late nineteenth century.12 Since that time the\napproach has been copied with minor variations by many nations in\nEurope, Asia (including Japan), and Latin America. This approach should\nnot be dismissed as easily as it has been in our health reform debate simply\nbecause it may look to some people like a payroll tax.\nIndeed, none of the nations using payroll-based financing of health care\ncall these levies payroll taxes. In Germany, for example, the levy has always\nbeen called the Beitragssatz, which literally means contribution rate, as\ndistinct from Steuern, the German word for taxes. In France, the levy is\ncalled Cotisation Sociale, which also means contribution rate and once again\nis distinct from impot, the French word for tax. These nations are neither\nstupid, nor sloppy or cynical in their use of language. Instead, they appreci-\nate the significant economic, administrative, and political differences be-\ntween such contribution rates and genuine taxes. Furthermore, these na-\ntions do not let these payroll-based levies flow into the general government\nbudget, there to be pitted against any other program and possibly to be\ndiverted to other programs. Rather, the levies flow into special, autono-\nmous, and often semiprivate trust funds established solely to finance the\nfunction for which the levy is made. In their national accounts, these funds\nare not shown as an integral part of the government sector. They are shown\nseparately as part of the social budget.\nIf the employer mandate proposed in the president's health plan were\nconverted into one more closely resembling the social insurance approach,\nmany of the distortive notch effects now in the president's plan would\ndisappear.13 This is so because neither the size of the firm nor the average\npayroll per employee for the firm would become parameters that determine\nthe flow of subsidies. If these subsidies were pegged on the individual's gross\npay, they could be targeted much more precisely onto truly poor house-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In\neffect, the firm-based parameters in the president's plan convert these\nsubsidies into a scatter shot that wastes many public subsidy bullets on\nmiddle- and upper-income households.\nFinally, and very importantly, the social insurance approach makes it\neasier to communicate to employees precisely what their health care costs\nthem individually. While in other countries employers and employees often\nshare the contribution rate fifty-fifty, in fact, the public discussions on them\nare always based on the total. When European workers learn that this total\nis X percent of their gross wages, they probably think of that X percent as\ntheir own money. Will American workers think likewise when they are told\nthat their \"company\" pays 80 percent of their health insurance premium?\nOr will they continue to think of health care as an almost free lunch?\nNOTES\n1. According to data published by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), in\n1992 about 138 million nonelderly Americans obtained their health insurance cover'\nage from their employer. Only about nineteen million nonelderly persons had \"other\nprivate coverage,\" much of it probably purchased individually. About thirty-four\nmillion elderly Americans were insured primarily by Medicare (although many of them\nhad private supplementary coverage or Medicaid coverage), and about twenty-six\nmillion low-income nonelderly Americans were covered by Medicaid. The Depart-\nments of Defense and Veterans Affairs covered seven million Americans. About 38.9\nmillion Americans were classified as \"uninsured.\" EBRI, Sources ofHealth Insurance and\nCharacteristics of the Uninsured (Washington: EBRI, January 1994), 5, Table 1.\n3. S.

Exhibit 2 may not tell the full story. That diagram is based on the assumption that\nworkers do not assign any value to the health insurance policy that is tied to the job.\nIf employees attached positive value to job-related insurance, the employer mandate\nwould serve to shift out the labor supply curve, which would mitigate the job loss effect.\n7.

Reinhardt\nPrologue: America's belief in solving large problems through\nprivate/public collaboration has not guaranteed a solution to\nPresident Clinton's quest for universal health insurance cover-\nage. The administration's proposed requirement that all employ-\ners provide their workers with health insurance coverage has\nbeen attacked by the small-business community and most Re-\npublicans as too regulatory for the American appetite. The ad-\nministration's plan also would require that unemployed and self-\nemployed persons be subjected to a coverage mandate. In this\npaper economists Alan Krueger and Uwe Reinhardt argue: \"If\npolicymakers wish all Americans to have portable health insur-\nance coverage, they must mandate that coverage. . . . Absent a\nmandate, millions of American families would simply choose to\nremain uninsured.\" Krueger and Reinhardt, both of whom are\nprofessors of economics at Princeton University, discuss the fi-\nnancing of health care, explaining how most practitioners of\ntheir discipline view a mandate on employers to provide health\ninsurance to their workers. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor\nof Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton's Woodrow\nWilson School. He is coeditor of the Journal of Economic Per-\nspectives and has published widely on labor market issues. He\nreceived his doctorate in economics from Harvard. Reinhardt is\na well-known figure in health policy circles in the United States\nand abroad. A born teacher and a naturalized American,\nReinhardt spent his early years in Germany, but he took his uni-\nversity training in Canada and at Yale University, from which\nhe earned a doctorate in economics. Reinhardt has eclectic intel-\nlectual tastes. While a strong believer in markets, he also recog-\nnizes Canada's tax-financed health care system and Germany's\nsocial insurance scheme as approaches that provide their popula-\ntions equitable protection against the uncertain nature of illness.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
