    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe studied temporal order judgements (TOJs) of gaze shift behaviours and evaluated the impact of\ngaze direction (direct and averted gaze) and face context information (both eyes set within a single\nface or each eye within two adjacent hemifaces) on TOJ performance measures. Avatar faces\ninitially gazed leftwards or rightwards (Starting Gaze Direction). This was followed by sequential\nand independent left and right eye gaze shifts with various amounts of stimulus onset asynchrony.\nGaze shifts could be either Matching (both eyes end up pointing direct or averted) or Mismatching\n(one eye ends up pointing direct, the other averted). Matching shifts revealed an attentional cueing\nmechanism, where TOJs were biased in favour of the eye lying in the hemispace cued by the\navatar's Starting Gaze Direction. For example, the left eye was more likely to be judged as shifting\nfirst when the avatar initially gazed toward the left side of the screen. Mismatching shifts showed\nbiased TOJs in favour of the eye performing the averted shift, but only in the context of two\nseparate hemifaces that does not violate expectations of directional gaze shift congruency. This\nsuggests a postdictive inferential strategy that prioritises eye movements based on the type of gaze\nshift, independently of where attention is initially allocated. Averted shifts are prioritised over\ndirect, as these might signal the presence of behaviourally relevant information in the environment.\nCorresponding author:\nNicola Binetti, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1N 0AP,\nEmail: nicolabinetti@gmail.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\n",

People invest more time looking at the eyes compared\nwith other facial attributes (Janik, Wellens, Goldberg, & Dell'Osso, 1978; Morton &\nJohnson, 1991), a preference that emerges at early developmental stages (Driver et al.,\n1999; Klin, Lin, Gorrindo, Ramsay, & Jones, 2009). Direct (or forward--when someone\nlooks straight at us) and averted (when someone is looking away) gaze behaviours deliver\ninformation pertinent to different aspects of social communication. Direct gaze is a precursor\nto most interactions and can be an expression of interest or hostility (Kleinke, 1986). On the\nother hand, other's averted gaze can signal the presence of potentially rewarding or\nthreatening stimuli in the environment, providing a basis for joint attention (Frischen,\nBeing able to adequately classify direct and averted gaze signals requires mechanisms for\nprocessing directional gaze information (Ewbank, Jennings, & Calder, 2009; Mareschal,\nCalder, Dadds, & Clifford, 2013). Imaging and electrophysiological data provide evidence of\ndedicated neural systems for gaze direction processing in the primate and human brain. Human\nfunctional imaging studies have documented posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS)\nactivation in gaze processing (Hoffman & Haxby, 2000; Pelphrey, Morris, & McCarthy,\n2005) and distinct neural populations in the anterior STS and inferior temporal lobule tuned\nto different gaze shift directions (Calder et al., 2007). Electroencephalographic evidence has\nindicated differences in brain activity when observing direct opposed to averted gaze (Conty,\nN'Diaye, Tijus, & George, 2007; McCarthy, Puce, Belger, & Allison, 1999). In vivo recordings\nin the anterior STS of macaque monkeys have identified cell populations which selectively\nrespond to direct and averted gaze stimuli (Perrett & Emery, 1994; Perrett et al., 1985).\nDirect and averted signals are however embedded within dynamic gaze behaviours; evaluating\ndirectional information is equally important to determining when shifts occur, in what order and\nhow long they last. In previous studies, we have addressed the mechanisms through which people\nestimate the duration of gaze behaviours. In a 500-participant sample, covering a wide range of\nages and nationalities, we measured what duration constitutes a `normal' amount of eye contact\nand related individual preferences in gaze duration to changes in pupil dilation (a proxy for\nphysiological arousal; Binetti, Harrison, Coutrot, Johnston, & Mareschal, 2016). This revealed a\nperiod of roughly 3 seconds as a comfortable amount of eye contact which was largely\nindependent of participant demographic and personality variables. We also found that the\nrate at which pupil size increases predicts people's preferred eye contact duration: Participants\nwho preferred longer periods of eye contact exhibited faster rates of pupil increase. In a\nmore recent study, we have shown with pupil response measures that people exploit internal\narousal signals to time gaze behaviours in others (Binetti et al., 2017). This was not observed\nwhen participants evaluated the duration of equivalent neutral spatial displacements (Gabor\nshifts), thus providing the first evidence of dedicated timing machinery for estimating the\nduration of gaze behaviours.\nIn the present study, we investigate the mechanisms that inform temporal order\njudgements (TOJ) of dynamic gaze shifts performed by avatar face stimuli. Avatars initially\nlooked toward the left or right side of the screen and after a variable delay performed Matching\n2 i-Perception\ndirect or averted gaze shifts (both eyes end up pointing direct or averted) or Mismatching shifts\n(one eye shifts to a direct direction, the other to an averted direction). We introduced an\nasynchrony between the left and right eye shifts, and asked participants to indicate which\neye shifted earlier (TOJ). We assessed how TOJs were modulated by directional cue\ninformation prior to the avatar's gaze shifts (starting gaze direction), by the type of gaze\nshifts the avatars performed (direct or averted shifts) and by the face context within which\nthese shifts were set (left and right eyes set within a single face or each eye set within one of two\nadjacent hemifaces). We manipulated starting gaze direction to study the effect of attentional\nconstraints on gaze shift TOJs. Prior research has shown that starting gaze provides a strong\nform of attentional cueing (Driver et al., 1999; Schneider & Bavelier, 2003): attention is\nautomatically drawn in the direction the eyes are pointing. Since spatial attention biases\nTOJs (i.e. the object of attention appears to occur first, i.e. `prior entry'), we expect on the\nbasis of this that eye shift TOJs will be biased in favour of the eye lying in the hemispace cued\nby the avatar's starting gaze direction. For example, participants might have a tendency to\nreport the left eye as shifting earlier when the avatar is initially looking toward the left side of\nthe screen (drawing attention toward the left hemispace). We also manipulated gaze shift\ndirection to evaluate how TOJs are affected by the directional content of left and right eye\nshifts. Several studies have highlighted asymmetries in the processing of direct and averted\nstimuli. Direct gaze is known to enhance attention and cognition (Conty et al., 2007; Senju &\nHasegawa, 2005). We evaluated four gaze shift combinations: two directionally Matching\nshifts, where both eyes shift to direct (DD) or both shift to averted (AA); and two\ndirectionally Mismatching shifts, where the left eye shifts to direct and the right to averted\n(DA) or the left eye shifts to averted and the right to direct (AD). When eyes perform Matching\nshifts, we expect that direct shifts (DD) will lead to improved TOJ performance relative to\naverted shifts (AA), that is, greater precision and sensitivity to differences in TOJs. When eyes\nperform Mismatching shifts, where direct and averted both occur within the same trial, we\npredict that TOJs will be biased toward the eye performing the direct shift, that is, leftward bias\nin DA trials and rightward bias in AD trials. Finally, we manipulated face context information\nto examine potential benefits in temporal order processing of features belonging to a single\nobject or to two separate objects. One might expect on the grounds of object-based attention\n(Duncan, 1984; Kimchi, Yeshurun, & Cohen-Savransky, 2007), and the appreciation that eye\nmovements are coordinated within a face rather than between faces, some facilitation of TOJs\nin the case of movements of the eyes with the same face as compared with across faces.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTen participants were recruited in the study (five Female; age \u00bc 33.5 \u00c6 11.5 years, range \u00bc 25\u00ad\n61 years). The sample size was based on comparable number of participants tested in\nprevious TOJ studies (Driver et al., 1999; Schneider & Bavelier, 2003; Shore, Spence, &\nKlein, 2001). All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. Informed consent\nwas obtained from all participants prior to starting the experiment. The study was approved\nby the University College London Research ethics committee and was in agreement with the\nUniversity College London research guidelines and regulations.\nApparatus\nThe study was conducted in a dimly lit testing environment. A chinrest restrained head\nposition and stimuli were displayed on a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 250SB CRT monitor\nBinetti et al. 3\nresponse collection were implemented on MATLAB 2013a (Mathworks), with the\nPsychtoolbox 3 library running on a DELL precision T3500. Avatar stimuli were created\nwith Poser 9 Pro (SmithMicro Software).\nTask and Stimuli\nAt the beginning of each trial, a circular fixation point was displayed on the screen. Following\na 750-ms delay, the avatar face stimuli (one face or two adjacent hemifaces) were presented\non the screen with left and right eyes pointing either leftwards (toward the left side of the\nscreen, from the participant's perspective) or rightwards (toward the right side of the screen,\nfrom the participant's perspective; Figure 1(a)). A black fixation point was level with the\nnasion region (i.e. on the nasion region in the one face condition or in between nasion regions\nin the two hemiface condition). Avatar stimuli measured approximately 7 cm (Width) \u00c2 11 cm\n(Height), with the eye stimuli set 3.7 cm apart (distance measured from the centre of each\neye). The two hemiface stimulus was constructed by swapping the left and right sides of the\none face stimulus while ensuring that the distance between eyes remained constant. The initial\ngaze direction of the avatar stimulus was counterbalanced across blocks. After a variable 470-\nto 1412-ms delay (sampled from a uniform distribution), the left and right eyes performed\ngaze shifts (direct or averted) in the direction opposite to the starting gaze direction. The\ntemporal order between left and right eye shifts was varied across seven possible levels of\nFigure 1. (a) Time course of events in trial. In this specific example, the one face avatar stimulus is selected\nwith a leftward starting gaze direction and both eyes perform a direct gaze shift (the left eye shifts before the\nright). (b) Psychometric fit of one participant's responses as a function of SOA. Point of Subjective\nSimultaneity (PSS), measured in ms: SOA required for the left eye and right eye shifts to appear simultaneous.\nPSS values > 0 indicate that Temporal Order Judgements (TOJs) are biased in favour of the left eye (the right\neye has to shift earlier to generate a percept of simultaneity) while PSS values < 0 indicate that TOJs are\nbiased in favour of the right eye (the left eye has to shift earlier to generate a percept of simultaneity).\n4 i-Perception\nwithin each trial. Negative SOA values correspond to the left eye shifting first (Figure 1(b)). A\nbrief 100-ms full-screen random noise mask, smoothed with a Gaussian filter, was presented\n250 ms after the presentation of the second gaze shift. The mask was used to minimise the\npersistence of afterimages. Participants were then required to indicate with an unspeeded\nbutton press on the keyboard which eye, left or right (`a' or `l' keys, respectively), shifted\nearlier (TOJ). The next trial started immediately after the participant's button press. The\nposition of the stimulus on the screen varied across trials, requiring participants to saccade on\neach occasion to the repositioned fixation cross. The stimuli were randomly displaced within\na 50 \u00c2 50 pixel area relative to the centre of the screen. This was included to `refresh' stimulus\npresentation across successive trials, avoiding the emergence of habituation effects that might\nhinder the processing of the avatar's face information. We used a single male avatar face\nthroughout, presented on a mid-grey background.\nOn each trial, the eyes either performed Matching gaze shifts (both eyes final pointing\ndirection is direct or averted) or Mismatching shifts (the left eye's final pointing direction is\ndirect and the right eye's final direction is averted, or, the left eye ends up pointing away and\nthe right eye points direct). Participants performed 20 repetitions for each combination of\navatar Starting Gaze Direction (avatars start gazing leftwards or rightwards), Face Contexts\n(one face/two hemifaces), Gaze Shift combination (Matching: Left Direct & Right Direct,\nLeft Averted & Right Averted; Mismatching: Left Direct & Right Averted, Left Averted &\nFigure 2. Experimental conditions based on the combinations of Starting Gaze Direction (Leftward or\nRightward), Face context (One face or Two hemifaces) and Gaze shifts (Matching: both eyes direct or both\neyes averted; Mismatching: one eye performs a direct shift, the other an averted shift). `Start' indicates the\navatar's left/right eye gaze direction prior to the gaze shifts and `End' indicates the avatar's left/right eye gaze\ndirection after the gaze shifts have taken place. The SOA values determine in what order and with what\nrelative latency these gaze shifts occur (not depicted in the figure).\nBinetti et al. 5\nAnalysis\nWe fit participants' proportion of `right eye shifted first' responses as a function of SOA with\na cumulative Gaussian. The 50% point of this function yielded an estimate of the\nparticipant's Point of Subjective Simultaneity (PSS), that is, the amount of asynchrony\nbetween left eye and right eye gaze shifts required for these events to be perceived as\nsynchronous (Figure 1(b)). The sign of PSS values reveal biased TOJ in favour of the left\nor right eye. For example, if the PSS is 50 ms, this means that the right eye shift has to precede\nthe left eye shift by 50 ms in order for the two events to appear synchronous, thus revealing a\nbias to perceive the left eye as having shifted first. We also calculated the standard deviation\n(SD) of the Gaussian fit as an index of participant sensitivity to variations in SOA. Based on\nour predictions, we assessed variations in PSS and SD separately for Matching and\nMismatching conditions. This was aimed at testing differences between DD and AA trials\n(with congruent directional information), or between DA and AD trials (with conflicting\ndirectional information), as a function of starting gaze direction and face context.\nMatching condition. We submitted the PSS and SD values to a repeated measures analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA), with avatar Starting Gaze Direction (avatars start gazing toward left or\nright side of screen) \u00c2 Face Context (one face / two hemifaces) \u00c2 Gaze Shift (DD: both eyes\ndirect, or AA: both averted) as factors.\nMismatching condition. We submitted PSS and SD values to a repeated measures ANOVA,\nwith avatar Starting Gaze Direction (avatars start gazing toward left or right side of\nscreen) \u00c2 Face Context (one face / two hemifaces) \u00c2 Gaze Shift (DA: left eye direct / right\neye averted, or AD: left eye averted / right eye direct) as factors.\nResults\nMatching Condition\nA 2 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 2 repeated measures ANOVA run on PSS values only revealed a main effect of\n2 \u00bc .41. PSS signs were modulated by the\ninitial gaze direction of the avatar stimuli. When the avatars initially gazed toward the left\nside of the screen, TOJs were biased in favour of perceiving the left eye as having shifted first\n(positive PSS values), while conversely, when the avatars initially gazed toward the right side\nof the screen, TOJs were biased in favour of the right eye having shifted first (negative PSS\nvalues; Figure 3(a)).

TOJs are biased in favour of the eye performing an averted gaze shift (the right eye in\nDA trials; the left eye in AD trials). This is only observed in the two hemiface context.\nBinetti et al. 7\nWhen the left and right eyes, respectively, performed an averted and direct gaze shift, TOJs\nwere biased in favour of the left eye (positive PSS value), while conversely, when the left and\nright eyes, respectively, performed a direct and averted shift, TOJs were biased in favour of\nthe right eye (negative PSS values; Figure 3(d)).

A nonsignificant Starting Gaze Direction versus Match/\nMismatch interaction, F(1, 9) \u00bc .24, p \u00bc .64, revealed that the influence of Starting Gaze\nDirection was not significantly stronger in Matching opposed to Mismatching trials.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we examined how people evaluate the temporal order of asynchronous gaze\nshifts performed by avatars. We assessed how TOJs were modulated by directional cue\ninformation prior to gaze shifts, by the type of gaze shifts the avatars performed (direct or\naverted), and by the face context within which these shifts were set. When avatars performed\nMatching gaze shifts (both eyes performed direct or averted shifts), we found that TOJs were\nbiased in favour of the eye lying in the hemispace cued by the avatar's initial gaze direction,\nwhich suggests an attentional cuing phenomenon. For example, if the avatar initially gazed\ntoward the left side of the screen, it was more likely for participants to report the left eye gaze\nshift as occurring earlier than the right eye shift. We observed a similar, but nonsignificant\ntrend in the Mismatching conditions (one eye performed a direct shift, the other averted).\nMismatching shifts also revealed that eye behaviours were prioritised based on the type of\ngaze shift performed: contrary to our initial prediction, we found that averted shifts appeared\nto temporally precede direct shift behaviours. This only occurred when gaze shifts were set\nwithin the two hemiface context. Most importantly, this was independent of where attention\nwas initially allocated, thus suggesting that a retrospective appraisal of the directional\ncontent of eye shifts informs TOJs of gaze behaviour.\nThe determinants of temporal order perception have been investigated across crossmodal\nNicholls, 2009) and saccadic suppression studies (Binda, Cicchini, Burr, & Morrone, 2009;\nMorrone, Ross, & Burr, 2005). These studies reveal that TOJs are based on information\npooled from a variety of different sources (Kresevic, Marinovic, Johnston, & Arnold, 2016;\nMatthews, Welch, Achtman, Fenton, & FitzGerald, 2016). A first determinant is clearly\nrepresented by the times at which sensory signals reach the cortex (Arnold & Wilcock,\n8 i-Perception\nattentional gating mechanisms, where TOJs are biased in favour of attended stimuli. This is\nformalised in Titchener's (1908) law of prior entry, which states that `the object of attention\ncomes to consciousness more quickly than the objects which we are not attending to' p.251.\nThis implies that an attended stimulus should be presented later in time with respect to an\nunattended stimulus in order to generate a perception of simultaneity (summarised by PSS\nvalues; Spence & Parise, 2010). Several studies have reported asymmetries in perceptual and/\nor attentional processing between right and left visual hemifields (Battelli, Pascual-Leone, &\n\u00b4 migasiewicz & Mo\n\u00a8 ller, 2011): Stimuli lying in the left\nhemifield are frequently processed faster (Forster, Corballis, & Corballis, 2000; Woo, Kim, &\nstimuli in the right hemifield. We observed, at least in the Mismatching conditions\n(Figure 3(c) and (d)), a left-eye bias trend (the avatar's left eye, from the participant's\nperspective): mean PSS values (i.e. the mean PSS of Start Left and Start Right trials in\nFigure 3(c); the mean PSS of DA and AD trials within one face and two hemiface\ncontexts in Figure 3(d)) lie above the point of physical simultaneity (mean PSS > 0 ms).\nCuriously, this pattern was not observed in the Matching conditions (Figure 3(a) and (b)).\nStudies have also shown that both exogenous (automatic) and endogenous (voluntary)\nspatial shifts of attention can determine prior entry effects (Shore et al., 2001; Yates &\nNicholls, 2009). Exogenous cues (e.g. a peripheral flash) modulate TOJs by automatically\ndrawing attention and priming sensory processing at cued spatial locations. On the other\nhand, endogenous cues (e.g. a centrally presented arrow) can be used to voluntarily direct\nattention toward spatial locations where an impending critical stimulus is likely to occur (or\ncan be ignored when the cue proves uninformative). Direct comparisons of these two\nattentional cueing mechanisms show stronger prior entry effects with exogenous cues\nAverted gaze stimuli have been observed to induce strong cueing effects (Frischen et al.,\n2007). Yet, they fall under a unique category: while generally presented centrally in\nattentional orienting and TOJ paradigms (just like an arrow), they are known to elicit\nstrong overt (Mansfield, Farroni, & Johnson, 2003; Ricciardelli, Bricolo, Aglioti, &\nwhich are typically expected in response to peripheral exogenous cues. For example,\nenhanced discrimination has been observed for stimuli that lie in the spatial location cued\nby an avatar's gaze direction (Driver et al., 1999). This was observed independently of the\npredictive nature of the gaze stimulus: attention was automatically drawn in the direction of\nthe avatar's gaze when it was noninformative, or even falsely informative, of the stimulus'\nlocation. Similarly, gaze cueing has previously been observed to induce strong prior entry\neffects in TOJ tasks: PSS of peripheral visual transients are modulated by the gaze direction\nheld by a centrally presented avatar stimulus (Schneider & Bavelier, 2003). Our task differs\nfrom this previous example since the avatar's eyes both offer directional cues at the beginning\nof the trial as well as provide the transients (gaze shifts) that participants must classify as\noccurring first or second. Nonetheless, our Matching condition results are consistent with\nthese previous reports (Schneider & Bavelier, 2003). Attention was automatically drawn\ntoward the hemispace cued by the avatar's initial gaze direction. This in turn biased TOJs\nin favour of the eye lying within this cued spatial location. Our Mismatching condition\nhowever also revealed that averted shifts were prioritised over direct (in the context of two\nhemifaces), independently of where attention was initially allocated. This implies that TOJs\nwere not purely driven by attentional constraints and that gaze direction information was\nfactored into the decisional process.\nBinetti et al. 9\nThus, the determinants of TOJs can also lie in latter stages of the decisional pipeline.\nPrevious studies have shown that under conditions of sensory uncertainty caused by\nsaccadic suppression, some participants rely on a retrospective inferential strategy to\nclassify the temporal order of brief visual transients (Kresevic et al., 2016). When the\nsecond of two transients coincides with a saccade, which hinders its sensory processing,\nthis subset of participants arbitrarily evaluates the second stimulus as occurring first. The\nfact that only a subset of participants exhibits a temporal order reversal under these specific\ncircumstances, while saccades impair sensory processing across the whole sample, reveals\nthat participants default to a retrospective inference strategy when dealing with unreliable\nsensory information. In our study, we manipulated SOAs, thus sensory uncertainty was\nrelated to task difficulty (greater uncertainty with smaller SOAs). Our Mismatching\ncondition revealed that, independently of where attention was initially allocated (no main\neffect, or interaction involving Starting Gaze Direction), the averted shifts were prioritised\nover direct shifts, thus suggesting that TOJs were informed by a retrospective inferential\nstrategy based on the type (direct or averted) of eye shift performed. This leads to the\nquestion of what specific feature of these gaze shifts was the inference based on. One\npossibility is that of a velocity based criterion; averted shifts involved larger angular\ndisplacements than direct shifts. All trials began with both eyes holding averted leftward\nor rightward gaze: averted shifts (from the initial averted to averted in the opposite\ndirection after the shift) were larger than direct shifts (from initial averted to direct).\nAverted shifts were however prioritised over direct only within a specific face context\n(two hemifaces), which implies that gaze information was integrated with other facial\nfeature information. This interaction suggests that the retrospective judgements were\ndriven by a gaze direction-based criterion as the one face/two hemiface contexts impose\ndifferent constraints on directional congruency between left and right eye behaviours. While\ndirectionally mismatching behaviours are rarely observed within a single face (i.e.\nstrabismus), they frequently occur when gaze shifts occur across faces of different\nindividuals. Also, the prioritisation of averted shifts was not accompanied by\nimprovements in TOJ discrimination (no reduction of SD values), further suggesting a\npostdictive strategy that operates independently of early sensory processing stages.\nDespite being both relevant to social communication, several studies highlight\nasymmetries in the processing of direct and averted stimuli. Imaging studies have shown\nenhanced responses in the fusiform gyrus and amygdala for direct opposed to averted gaze\n(George, Driver, & Dolan, 2001; Kawashima et al., 1999), and behavioural studies have\nrevealed a prior for direct gaze in conditions of uncertainty (Mareschal, Calder, &\nClifford, 2013). When compared with averted, direct gaze is also known to enhance\nattention and cognition, that is, the so-called eye-contact effect (Senju & Johnson, 2009),\nand using a continuous flash suppression technique, direct gaze has been found to break\nthrough suppression faster than averted gaze (Stein, Senju, Peelen, & Sterzer, 2011). Gaze\ncontact also improves face recognition (Hood, Macrae, Cole-Davies, & Dias, 2003;\nVuilleumier, George, Lister, Armony, & Driver, 2005) and gender categorisation (Macrae,\nHood, Milne, Rowe, & Mason, 2002). These asymmetries are reflected in the detection of\ndirect and averted gaze stimuli. Visual search studies have highlighted that direct stimuli are\nprocessed faster and more accurately than averted (Conty, Tijus, Hugueville, Coelho, &\nvon Gru\n\u00a8 nau & Anston, 1995). We showed that, despite being processed slower, averted\nstimuli might be prioritised over direct when specific face context conditions are met.\nAverted shifts could determine prior entry effects, as these can potentially signal the\npresence of behaviourally relevant information in the environment. Given, however, the\npostdictive nature of this strategy, an alternative possibility is that direct gaze stimuli stand\nout more than averted stimuli, leading to a longer persistence of the former in iconic memory.\nThis longer persistence might in turn bias judgements of temporal order where direct gaze\nshifts are perceived as occurring more recently (i.e. after) than the averted shifts.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we identified the determinants of TOJs of gaze shift behaviours. By manipulating\ngaze directional cueing information (that occur prior to gaze shifts), the directional\ncongruency between left and right eye behaviours (after the gaze shifts) and the relationship\nbetween gaze shifts and face contextual information, we isolated two mechanisms that\ninfluence gaze shift TOJs. The first involved a reflexive attentional shift induced by the\navatar's fixation direction prior to the onset of the left and right eye gaze shifts. TOJs were\nbiased in favour of the eye lying in the hemispace (left or right) cued by the avatar's initial gaze\ndirection (leftward or rightward). The second involved a retrospective evaluation of temporal\norder where priority was assigned to a gaze shift based on its directional content and\nindependently of where attention was initially allocated.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This study was funded by a Leverhulme trust grant (RPG-2013-218) to AJ\nand IM.\nReferences\nArnold, D.
