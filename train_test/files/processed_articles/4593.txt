    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite the existence of several policies and programs, anemia among pregnant and lactating women continues to be\na serious concern for public health policy in India. The main objective of this study is to examine the prevalence and\ndeterminants of anemia among pregnant and lactating versus nonpregnant nonlactating (NP-NL) women for priority setting\nin health policies of the country. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS3) conducted in 2005-2006 has been\nused for the analyses of this study. The results revealed that the prevalence of anemia was higher among lactating women\n(63%), followed by pregnant women (59%) than NP-NL women (53%). Younger lactating (71%) and older pregnant women\n(67%) had a higher burden of anemia. Along with socioeconomic factors, demographic indicators such as children ever born\nand program factors like nutrition advice and supplementary nutrition during anti natal care and postnatal care emerged\nas significant predictors in the case of anemia among both pregnant and lactating women, while socioeconomic indicators\nemerged as critical factors in the case of anemia among NP-NL women. Hence, targeting demographic and program factors,\nalong with key socioeconomic and demographic factors in public health policy, is critical in reducing anemia among lactating\nand pregnant women, while targeting significant socioeconomic factors is the key for reducing anemia among NP-NL women.\n",

Within the\npregnant and lactating women, the anemia prevalence gap\nbetween developed and developing countries is large. For\ninstance, it is only 14% in developed countries, while it is\nmuch higher in developing countries (51%). Among the\ndeveloping regions, it is highest in Central and West Africa\n(56% among pregnant and 48% among nonpregnant) fol-\nlowed by South Asia (52% among pregnant and 47% among\n2016). Also, maternal deaths due to anemia were also\nreported to be highest in developing countries (Balarajan\nticularly in countries like India, it is as high as 60% to 70%\nThe prevalence of anemia also varies considerably by\npopulation characteristics like age, sex, socioeconomic sta-\ntus and biodemographic factors like pregnancy and lactation\nage group are more vulnerable to iron deficiency resulting in\nanemia, especially during pregnancy and lactation as they\nare physiologically and nutritionally at a higher risk (Brooker,\nSimilarly, a lactating mother requires highly nutritious food\nto accumulate calories for the production of adequate quan-\ntity of milk without deteriorating her health (Picciano, 2003;\nRaman, Primala, Bhalla, Venkateshwar, & Iyengar, 2001).\nYet women in developing countries often fail to consume\nadditional food and supplements required to meet the\ndemands during pregnancy and lactation because of fetal\ngrowth, alterations in maternal tissues, metabolism, and\nbreast feeding (Aikawa, Khan, Sasaki, & Binns, 2006; Baig-\nInspite of significance of the problem, anemia among\npregnant and lactating women has not received the requisite\nattention from public health policy in developing countries.\nIn India, the previous study on the prevalence and complica-\nscale National Family Health Survey (NFHS). This study\nhighlights the maternal anemia contribution to an intergen-\nerational cycle of poor growth of the foetus and low birth\nweight (Kalaivani, 2009). The focus of other recent studies\non this subject was restricted to either small-scale field or\nhospital-based surveys with limited geographical coverage\n(Lokare, Karanjekar, Gattani, & Kulkarni, 2012; Sharma\nmine the prevalence of anemia levels and factors associated\nwith it among pregnant and lactating women vis-\u00e0-vis\nNP-NL women in India, a setting where a substantial propor-\ntion of the population suffers from food insecurity and a poor\nsocial security mechanism (Siddiqui, Goli, Reja, & Shruti,\n2017). In particular, through a comparative assessment of\nlevels and factors associated with anemia among pregnant\nand lactating women vis-\u00e0-vis NP-NL women, we have\ninvestigated two objectives: first, to highlight the level of\nphysiological disadvantage of pregnant and lactating women\ncompared with NP-NL women in India; second, to identify\nthe factors affecting anemia among pregnant and lactating\nwomen vis-\u00e0-vis NP-NL women to prioritise specific targets\nin the policy for these categories of women.\nData and Methods\nData Source and Study Population\nthe International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS),\nMumbai, under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health\nand Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. The\nglobal Demographic Health Survey (DHS). It was a nation-\ninformation on fertility, mortality, morbidity, and maternal\nand child health, this is the only major survey in India that\nhas collected a comprehensive nutrition data with represen-\ntative samples from all the 29 states of India, covering more\nthan 99% of the national population. The samples of preg-\n97,418) women are adequate to carry out the robust statisti-\ncal analysis.\nOutcome Variable\nThe outcome variable in the study is the presence of any ane-\nmia (yes = 1/no = 0). The NFHS used HemoCue blood test to\nestimate the hemoglobin level in grams per deciliter blood.\nThe anemia status of the surveyed women was classified into\nsevere, moderate, mild, and any anemia based on WHO\nguidelines (WHO, 2011). Severe anemia level was defined\nas hemoglobin <7.0 g/dL for both pregnant and lactating\nwomen, and <8.0 g/dL among NP-NL women. Moderate\nanemia was defined as 7.0 to 9.9 g/dL for pregnant and lac-\ntating women, and 8.0 to 10.9 g/dL among NP-NL women.\nwomen. Any anemia was defined as the hemoglobin level\nbelow 11.0 g/dL in pregnant and lactating women, whereas\nPredictor Variables\nBased on an extensive review of existing literature\n(Kalaivani, 2009; Lokare, Karanjekar, Gattani, & Kulkarni,\nSiddiqui et al. 3\nsocioeconomic and demographic factors such as duration\nyears), total children ever born (no child/one to two/more\nthan two), place of residence (rural/urban), religion (hindu/\nmuslims/others), caste (sc/st/obc/others), education (no\neducation/primary/secondary&above), mass media expo-\nsure (no/any), partner's education (no education/primary/\nsecondary&above), and wealth quintile (poorest/poorer/\nmiddle/richer/richest) as demand-side predictors of anemia\nand pregnancy registration with ANM (Auxiliary Nurse\nMidwife; yes/no), recieved nutrition advice at least once\n(yes/no) and receipt of any supplementary nutrition (yes/\nno) as supply-side predictors of anemia.\nStatistical Analyses\nBivariate analyses were carried out to assess the level of ane-\nmia among pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL women by socio-\neconomic and demographic characteristics of women by\napplying appropriate sampling weights. Chi-square test was\nused to test the statistical significance of bivariate differ-\nences in anemia prevalence across the socioeconomic and\ndemographic characteristics. Furthermore, binary logistic\nregression models were used to assess the net effects of sev-\neral confounding factors associated with the occurrence of\nanemia among pregnant and lactating vis-\u00e0-vis NP-NL\nwomen. Alpha level was set at 0.05 to determine the statisti-\ncal significance of variation in the prevalence of any anemia\nestimated as an adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence\ninterval across the categories of the predictor variables. All\nanalyses of this study were carried out using STATA 13.\nResults\nSample Distribution of Study Population\nTable 1 presents the distribution of women by outcome and\npredictor variables. Out of the total sample of currently mar-\nried women in the age group 15 to 49 years, around 4% were\npregnant while 18% lactating and 78% were NP-NL at the\ntime of the survey. The distribution of women by socioeco-\nnomic and demographic profile shows that the majority of\nwomen in all three samples were Hindus (81% pregnant,\nto 34 years (66%), and lived in rural areas (76%). By social\ngroup, the results revealed that 40% to 41% of total women\nin pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL categories belonged to\nother backward class. Furthermore, the results also show that\n46% of total pregnant women had no education, while this\nfigure was 51% and 38% for lactating and NP-NL women,\nrespectively. Around half of pregnant and lactating women\nhad exposure to any form of mass media. The occupation-\nwise stratification suggested that 23% of the pregnant\nwomen, 28% of lactating women, and 39% of NP-NL women\nwere employed at the time of the survey. In terms of health\nTable 1.

Older pregnant women have a higher burden of\nanemia than younger ones. The prevalence of anemia among\nand then showed a decreasing trend up to the age of 20 to 22\nyears (59%), followed by a steady increase. The prevalence\nof anemia among these women peaked after age 38 years\n(70%). Lactating women showed a higher burden of anemia\nat younger ages, while the prevalence of anemia was steady\nand varying between 50% and 55% throughout the reproduc-\ntive span among NP-NL women. Furthermore, on grouping\nthe age into broad categories, the results revealed that older\npregnant women (aged >35 years) had a greater prevalence\nof moderate and severe anemia than middle age or younger\nwomen. Lactating women of younger ages (15-24) were\nfound to have a higher burden of mild (48%) and moderate\n(21%) anemia. Thus, the prevalence of anemia gradually\nincreased with the increase in duration of pregnancy among\npregnant and lactating women. It was found to be higher\namong women in the third trimester of gestation.\nThe overall distribution of women in different categories\nby anemia levels showed that pregnant women had a higher\nprevalence of severe anemia (2.2%) compared with lactating\n(1.7%) and NP-NL (1.8%). However, the prevalence of any\nanemia was higher in lactating women (62.9%) than preg-\ngories (pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL women), the\nrural\u00adurban differences in the prevalence of anemia persist.\nHowever, the rural\u00adurban difference in the prevalence of\nBackground\ncharacteristics\nPregnant\nwomen\nLactating\nwomen\n(n =\nNonpregnant-\nNonlactating\nwomen\nPregnancy registered with ANM\nTaken nutrition advice (at least once)\nReceived any supplementary nutrition\nTable 1. (continued) severe anemia was more pronounced in pregnant women\nWomen belonging to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe\nhad a significantly higher burden of anemia than other back-\nward classes and Others in all three types of anemia mea-\nsures. In the case of severe anemia, the caste differences in\nanemia risk among pregnant women were much greater than\nlactating and NP-NL women. Differences in the prevalence\nof any anemia were also observed among different educa-\ntional subgroups across pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL\nwomen. These differences were observed to be higher among\npregnant women (2.3%) than lactating (1%) and NP-NL\nwomen (0.5%). Likewise, the same pattern was found regard-\ning partner's education. Furthermore, the proportion of\nwomen in all categories who were exposed to mass media\nhad a lower burden of any anemia than those who did not\nhave any exposure. However, these differences were much\nhigher in the case of severe anemia among pregnant women\nthan lactating and NP-NL women.\nDifferences in prevalence of anemia by employment sta-\ntus were observed across all three categories of women.\nHowever, the volume of difference was not uniform across\nthe three groups of women. For instance, a higher percentage\nof anemia was found among pregnant and lactating women\nthan NP-NL women in currently employed category. Among\nthose suffering from severe anemia, the educational differ-\nences were greater in pregnant women compared with lactat-\ning and NP-NL women. Although the rich\u00adpoor gap in the\nprevalence of anemia was substantial across the women in all\nthe categories, it was quite substantial in pregnant and lactat-\ning women than NP-NL women.\nFurthermore, the results on the prevalence of anemia by\nsupply-side factors showed that women who registered their\npregnancy with ANM had better hemoglobin levels than\ntheir counterparts, although the differences were not signifi-\ncant. However, women who had taken nutrition advice and\nsupplementary nutrition from ANM had lower hemoglobin\nlevels compared with their counterparts (Table 2).\nAdjusted Odds Ratio of Anemia Prevalence and\nIts Determinants\nTable 3 presents the results of logistic regression analysis of\nanemia prevalence among pregnant, lactating, and NP-NL\nwomen while controlling for background characteristics.\nThe adjusted odds of anemia prevalence was found to be\nhigher among multigravida pregnant women (odds ratio\n[OR] = 1.4, p < .01) than in primigravida pregnant women\n(OR = 1). The odds of women having anemia were higher\namong pregnant women who were employed (OR = 1.33, p\n< .01) compared with their unemployed counterparts (OR =\n1). However, with reference to the women whose husbands\nwere not educated, pregnant and lactating women with edu-\ncated partners were less likely to be anemic. The possibility\nSiddiqui et al. 5\nof having anemia was less among pregnant women in the\nrichest households (OR = 0.65, p < .05), richer households\n.05) compared with poorest households (OR = 1).\nFurthermore, the results revealed that women who registered\ntheir pregnancy with ANM were less likely to be anemic.\nLikewise, the results also show that pregnant (OR = 1.26, p\nnutrition advice at least once during their pregnancy were\nmore likely to be anemic compared with those women who\ntook no advice during their pregnancy (OR = 1). Similarly,\nthe results also showed that pregnant women who had\nreceived any supplementary nutrition from Anganwadi were\nmore likely to be anemic (OR = 1.25, p < .05) compared with\nthose women who had not received any other supplementary\nnutrition during pregnancy (OR = 1).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nDespite the fact that India was the first developing country to\nimplement a national program to prevent anemia with nota-\nble attention to control anemia during pregnancy and lacta-\ntion, the severity of the problem remains. Anemia is still a\nmajor public health issue of greater magnitude for the coun-\ntry. The recently published fact sheets based on NFHS-4\ninformation from IIPS and MoHFW (2017) suggest that,\ndespite the rigorous efforts of government to reduce the\nprevalence of anemia in terms of free distribution of Iron\nFolic Acid (IFA) tablets and free advice on the nutritional\nrequirements during pregnancy and lactation, the prevalence\nof anemia (50.3%) in India remains one of the highest in the\nworld. The prevalence of anemia among NP-NL women (15-\nof anemia in post-2006 is not available in public domain to\ncarry out detailed analyses.\nNevertheless, the unit level analyses based on NFHS-3\ndata suggest that anemia is not uniformly distributed, rather\nit is heavily skewed toward disadvantaged group of women.\nFor instance, pregnant and lactating, and NP-NL women liv-\ning in rural areas, those belonging to a younger age group,\nand scheduled caste and scheduled tribe are at greater risk of\nhaving anemia. These women suffer more because of demand\nside factors. They have less purchasing power to obtain\nrequired levels of supplements, protein, and vitamins during\npregnancy and lactation (Agarwal et al. 2006; Goli,\n2003). In addition to disadvantaged socioeconomic status,\nwomen in vulnerable demographic status such as younger\nlactating and older pregnant women are also at an increased\nrisk of anemia. Akin to previous studies in other countries\nstudy supports that the later stage of pregnancy, concurrent\nlactation, and higher parity are associated with higher risk of\nanemia among lactating and pregnant women. However,\npregnant women in their first trimester have a lower risk of\nFigure 1.

Anemia is found to be more\namong those who received program benefits as compared\nwith others. It may be because nutrition advice and supple-\nmentary nutrition provided by frontline health workers under\nIntegrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) is targeted\ntoward disadvantaged women who are already suffering\nfrom anemia. Women from better-off households seek nutri-\ntion advice and supplementary nutrition from private health\ncare. Nevertheless, these findings give a strong message that\nthe program interventions are ineffective to bring them out of\nvicious cycle of anemia.\nOverall, based on the findings of this study, we emphasize\non the importance of varying effects of sociodemographic\nfactors in predicting anemia levels in pregnant and lactating\nwomen. In particularly, in a country where the fertility rate is\nstill reasonably high, sociodemographic factors plays a major\nrole in the depletion of women's iron stores during preg-\nnancy and lactation and lead to anemia Bentley & Griffiths,\n2012). Thus, the central point as reiterated in the study is that\nthe factors affecting anemia are multifactorial, ranging from\ndisadvantaged socioeconomic and demographic status (poor\neconomic status, no education, early marriage and childbirth,\nand higher parity) to unavailability of health care provision\nsuch as access to free nutritional supplements and dietary\nstudy also indicate that the factors associated with anemia\namong pregnant and lactating women may not be the same as\nfactors associated with anemia prevalence among NP-NL\nwomen. While improving socioeconomic factors are the key\nstrategy for reducing the prevalence of anemia among\nNP-NL women, but improvements in both sociodemographic\nand supply-side factors related to health care programs are\ncrucial to reduce prevalence of anemia in pregnant and lac-\ntating women.\nIn the context, where the successive NFHS (1-4) rounds\nshow that anemia in pregnant and lactating women has\nwork around the suggestive measures arising from this\nstudy. In particular, strengthening and monitoring the exist-\ning programs (e.g., ICDS, Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya\nKaryakram [RKSK]; Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram\n[JSSK]; Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and\nAdolescent Health [RMNC-A]; National Food Security Act\n[NFSA]), removing bottlenecks in accessing to programs by\npromoting awareness and health knowledge among women\nregarding nutrition and health care is critical for improving\nanemia among women in India. Anemia as a public health\nissue in developing country like India can not be eradicated\nwithout interventions right form childhood-to-adolescence\nto reproductive ages rather than targeted programmes at the\ntime of pregnancy and lactation (Goli, Rammohan & Singh,\n2015). Moreover, addressing the specific needs of pregnant,\nlactating, and NP-NL women through effective health care\ndelivery system would help in reducing the prevalence of\nanemia in India. Increased outreach of health services, train-\ning, and motivating frontline health workers not only for\npregnancy registration but also for promoting knowledge\nabout balanced nutrition, nutrition rich food, dietary diver-\nsity and provision of supplementary nutrition is crucial to\nprevent anemia among pregnant and lactating women.\nSimilarly, ensuring women's access to information on risks\nof early childbirths, lower birth intervals, and higher parities\nand engaging in risky occupations during pregnancy are\nalso important to reduce anemia among pregnant and lactat-\ning women. The government must take proactive efforts to\nprevent anemia through effective campaign for motivating\nwomen to take iron tablets according to the prescribed\nBackground characteristics\nPregnant women Lactating women Nonpregnant-Nonlactating women\nOdds ratios\n95% confidence interval\nOdds ratios\n95% confidence interval\nOdds ratios\n95% confidence interval\nLower limit Upper limit Lower limit Upper limit Lower limit Upper limit\nTaken nutrition advice (at once)\nNoa \nReceived any supplementary nutrition (from Anganwadi)\nNoa \naReference category.\nTable 3. (continued)\nSiddiqui et al. 9\nschedule. Also, tracking anemic children from schools and\nmaking interventions will help girls to improve their nutri-\ntional status and reduce anemia during pregnancy and lacta-\ntion. Furthermore, to reduce the burden of maternal anemia,\nthe government should target disadvantageous areas and\nsocial groups where the purchasing power, knowledge, and\naccess to health care facilities are minimal. The health care\npolicies must remove bottlenecks and restructure existing\ninterventions to consider the heterogeneous groups of\nwomen and their specific nutritional needs. Government has\nto remove financial barriers in purchasing nutrition-rich\nfood during pregnancy by implementing the NFSA, 2013 in\nits full spirit. Similarly, different programs aimed at improv-\ning the socioeconomic status of the households should also\nbe integrated into the policies of reproductive and adoles-\ncent health care to reduce iron deficiency and anemia among\nwomen in general and the lactating and pregnant women in\nparticular. The policies aiming to enhance the planning of\nbirths by appropriate timing of births, improvement in birth\nspacing, and avoid unwanted or higher order births through\nfamily planning are critical to avoid depletion of maternal\nfat and tissues in women which make them more vulnerable\nto anemia.\nAuthors' Note\nThis article is based on the preliminary analysis carried out while\nconceptualizing and drafting the project \"Understanding Pregnancy\nNutrition and Health Care among women in rural areas and urban\nslums of Uttar Pradesh: A Longitudinal study.\" The authors would\nlike to thank other team members of the project.\nAuthor Contributions\nS.G., M.Z.S., and T.R. conceived and design the experiments.
