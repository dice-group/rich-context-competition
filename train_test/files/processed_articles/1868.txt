An additional\n26.0% had IFG, totaling 35.3% (73.3 million) with either diabetes or IFG. The prevalence of total\ndiabetes rose with age, reaching 21.6% for those aged 65 years. The prevalence of diagnosed\ndiabetes was twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites (both P  0.00001), whereas the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was\nsimilar by race/ethnicity, adjusted for age and sex. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was\nsimilar by sex, but prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and IFG were significantly higher in\nto 2.8%) and IFG (from 24.7 to 26.0%). Results were similar after adjustment for age and sex.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Although the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes has increased signifi-\ncantly over the last decade, the prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and IFG have remained\nrelatively stable. Minority groups remain disproportionately affected.\nDiabetes and its complications are\nmajor causes of morbidity and mor-\ntality in the U.S. (1). The economic\ncost of diabetes in medical expenditures\nand lost productivity was estimated to be\ntionally the prevalence of self-reported di-\nagnosed diabetes has steadily increased\nover time (3), but the extent to which this\nincrease is due to enhanced detection is\nuncertain. Undiagnosed diabetes and im-\npaired fasting glucose (IFG) also have im-\nportant health consequences (4,5). Only\none nationally representative survey, The\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES), examines both\ndiagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed dia-\nbetes. This survey showed that from 1988\napproximately one-third of total diabetes\n(diagnosed and undiagnosed) in U.S.\nadults (6). The prevalence of IFG was\nnearly as high as the prevalence of total\ncontinuous annual survey with data re-\nleased every 2 years, and we reported the\nprevalence of diagnosed diabetes, undiag-\nnosed diabetes, and IFG in adults based\nited sample size in these 2 years, however,\nrestricted the detail and reliability of our\nanalyses. New criteria for defining IFG\nhave since been adopted (8,9), and only\nlimited estimates of the prevalence of IFG\nbased on this new definition have been\nreported using the 2 years of data from\nIn this report, we analyze the preva-\nlence of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed\ndiabetes, and IFG in adults in the U.S.\nusing 4 years of the NHANES data\ndetail according to age, sex, and race/\nethnicity.

Questions covered demo-\ngraphic characteristics and medical con-\nditions, including a history of diabetes.\nSpecifically, individuals were asked if,\nother than during pregnancy for women,\na doctor or health care professional had\never told them they had diabetes. Based\non this question, 991 individuals aged\n20 years were classified as having diag-\nnosed diabetes. Three additional individ-\nuals were excluded from analyses because\nof missing diabetes information.\nEach household was randomly as-\nsigned to either a morning or afternoon/\nevening examination session. There were\nout diagnosed diabetes who were as-\nsigned to a morning session, and plasma\n(88.3%) of them after they fasted for 8 to\n24 h. This group is subsequently re-\nferred to as the plasma glucose sub-\nsample. Recommendations for the\ndiagnosis of diabetes are based on studies\nof plasma glucose measured after an over-\nwere included, and none had undiagnosed\ndiabetes based on their fasting plasma glu-\ncose (FPG) values. Plasma glucose values\nwere not analyzed for 420 people with in-\nvalid or unknown fasting times and 81 peo-\nple with unknown glucose values.\nThe procedures for blood collection\nand processing are described elsewhere\n(11). Plasma glucose was measured at a\ncentral laboratory using a hexokinase en-\nzymatic method, with a coefficient of vari-\nation of 3% during the 4 years of the\nsurvey. Standard diagnostic criteria were\nused to categorize people without diag-\nnosed diabetes as to whether they had un-\ndiagnosed diabetes (FPG 7.0 mmol/l)\nRace/ethnicity was categorized according\nto NHANES guidelines to allow compar-\nison across the surveys (11).

For the\ndiagnosed diabetes from the entire inter-\nviewed sample were combined with indi-\nviduals without diagnosed diabetes from\nthe plasma glucose subsample.

This difference in\nrequired because the plasma glucose sub-\nsample weights for that survey did not\naccount for some individuals having in-\nvalid or unknown fasting times or un-\nknown plasma glucose values.\nTo account for different age and sex\ndistributions between groups and over\ntime, we derived estimates that were age-\nCensus population using the direct\nwas used to calculate SEs in the NHANES\nlinearization method (14).

A\none-sample t test was used for testing\nwhether differences between subgroups\nzero. Two-sample t tests were used to test\ndifferences in proportions between the\ntwo surveys.

Similar results were found\nusing standardized prevalences.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes affects a\nsubstantial proportion of the U.S. popu-\nlation. Based on data from the NHANES\nyears had either diagnosed or undiag-\nnosed diabetes, representing an estimated\nyears. About one-third (30.1%) of diabe-\ntes was undiagnosed. An additional\n26.0% of adults had IFG, a condition that\nincreases the risk for diabetes and is asso-\nciated with other cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors (5). Thus, a combined total of 35.3%\nof the adult U.S. population (73.3 million\npersons) had diabetes or IFG. The preva-\nlence of diagnosed diabetes has increased\n2002, yet prevalences of undiagnosed di-\nabetes and IFG have remained relatively\nstable. Considerable variation by race/\nethnicity and sex in the prevalences of di-\nabetes and IFG continues to exist, once\nadjustments are made for differing age/\nsex distributions.\nOur point estimates, which are based\non 4 years of data, are more precise than\nthe preliminary estimates, which were\npreviously reported based on 2 years of\ndata (7,10). Nevertheless, some of the es-\ntimates we report here for subgroups de-\nfined simultaneously by age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity are unreliable, particularly\nfor the prevalence of undiagnosed diabe-\ntes. CI have been provided, however, to\nassist reader interpretation.\nThe FPG value is currently recom-\nmended for screening for diabetes and\nIFG because it is quick, easy to obtain,\nand acceptable to patients in clinical set-\ntings. Oral glucose tolerance tests were\n2002; consequently, additional individu-\nals with abnormal postload glucose\ntolerance and normal fasting glucose lev-\nels have not been identified. Although this\ngroup is unlikely to affect prevalence of\ndiabetes substantially (8), the addition of\nimpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) would\nsignificantly increase estimates of total\nAge (years)\nData are % (95% CI). IFG is defined as fasting plasma glucose 5.6\u00ad7.0 mmol/l. Values for the total population and for men and women include those of race/ethnic\ngroups not listed separately. All CIs were logit transformed. *Standardized to the 2000 U.S. Census population by age and sex for the total population and race/ethnic\ngroups and by age for sex-groups.\nPrevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose\nshould also be noted that determination\nof undiagnosed diabetes and IFG in the\nNHANES was based on a single plasma\nglucose reading from subjects who self-\nreported that they fasted appropriately;\nthis result may not be duplicated upon\nretesting as suggested for diagnosis in a\nclinical setting. Consequently, some of\nthe prevalence estimates may be over-\nstated. There are no better surveys, how-\never, for a national assessment of diabetes\nand pre-diabetes using current diagnostic\ncriteria.\nAlthough the increase in total diabe-\ntes over the last decade was not statisti-\ncally significant, the prevalence did rise\nsignificantly in men and in non-Hispanic\nblacks. Overweight and obesity have also\nrisen over the last decade (18). Available\ndata are not sufficient to investigate\nwhether this association might be causal.\nCurrently, non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans have almost twice the\nstandardized prevalence of total diabetes\nof non-Hispanic whites, and no evidence\nindicates that this differential has de-\nclined over the last decade. Clearly, how-\never, the proportion of total diabetes that\nis undiagnosed is no greater in non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans\nthan in non-Hispanic whites. In fact, the\ndata suggest the possibility that the pro-\nportion that is undiagnosed in these\ngroups has decreased over the last decade.\nPossible explanations for such a decrease\nare lacking. Decreases over the past sev-\neral decades in the proportion of diabetes\nthat is undiagnosed have occurred only\namong the most obese (19).\nWe found a higher prevalence of both\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in\nmen than in women among non-Hispanic\nwhites, but a similar prevalence by sex\namong non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans.

This finding\nalso merits further research.\nLifestyle modification such as weight\nmanagement and increased physical ac-\ntivity reduces the risk of diabetes among\npersons with IGT (20). However, there\nare no signs that obesity is abating (18),\nand features of insulin resistance are evi-\ndent in adolescents with IFG (21). The\nprevalence of diagnosed diabetes has in-\ncreased significantly over the last decade.\nAlthough the prevalences of undiagnosed\ndiabetes and IFG have remained relatively\nstable, the current prevalences of total di-\nabetes and IFG are excessive relative to\nnational health objectives (22), particu-\nlarly in minority groups.\nReferences\n1.
