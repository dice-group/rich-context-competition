Wortman, PhD3\nPurpose: This study evaluated how levels of social partic-\nipation change as a result of late-life widowhood. Social\nparticipation is a multidimensional construct incorporat-\ning both formal (e.g., meeting attendance, religious par-\nticipation, and volunteer obligations) and informal (e.g.,\ntelephone contact and social interactions with friends) social\nroles. Design and Methods: Using data from the Chang-\ning Lives of Older Couples study, analyses compared wid-\nowed persons to continuously married control participants\nto evaluate whether widowhood affects older adults' levels\nof social participation. Results: Widowed persons had\nhigher levels of informal social participation than nonwid-\nowed persons, whereas formal social participation levels\nwere comparable between the two groups. Social partici-\npation levels decrease before the death of a spouse, prima-\nrily because of poor spousal health, and increase following\nthe loss, because of increased support from friends and\nrelatives. Implications: Maintaining continuity in the realm\nof social participation is a strategy older adults use to\ncope with spousal loss; however, not all widowed per-\nsons have the same resources to alter their levels of social\nparticipation.\nKey Words: Social integration, Social support, Formal\nand informal social roles, Spousal bereavement\nPast research has claimed that widowhood is\namong the most stressful of all life events and requires\nmore psychological and behavioral adjustment than\nany other life transition (Barrett & Schneweis, 1980\u00ad\nGallagher, & Peterson, 1984). To date, bereavement\nstudies have focused primarily on the emotional and\npsychological responses to widowhood (see Stroebe,\nHansson, Stroebe, & Schut, 2001, for review). In con-\ntrast, this article explores the social and behavioral\nimplications of spousal loss. Because older adults\nhave solidified and internalized a lifetime of habits,\nbehaviors, and attitudes (Atchley, 1989), the behav-\nioral adjustments associated with late-life bereave-\nment may be one of the most difficult challenges an el-\nderly person faces. Upon widowhood, the survivor\nmust relinquish the status of married person and as-\nsume the identity of widow(er). In response to this\nidentity transition, bereaved persons may realign\ntheir social networks or alter their social activities.\nSocial interactions outside of the marital relationship\nmay become increasingly salient, thereby increasing\nbereaved persons' level of social involvement. Alter-\nnatively, social relationships may become strained if\nwidow(er)s feel like a \"fifth wheel\" among married\nfriends, thereby decreasing the bereaved persons'\nlevel of social engagement. Using the Changing Lives\nof Older Couples study (CLOC), we explored how\nthe formal and informal social participation of older\nmarried and widowed persons changes over time and\nwhether theoretical explanations from social geron-\ntology are useful in explaining the patterns of change.\nDefining Social Participation\nAccording to Rowe and Kahn (1997), active and\nproductive engagement in society is a central compo-\nnent of successful aging. Applied to bereavement, sus-\ntained social engagement could also be a critical com-\nponent of successful adaptation or coping. A positive\nrelationship between social activity and well-being\nis well documented (Lowenthal & Haven, 1968).\nHigher levels of social participation are associated\nThe Changing Lives of Older Couples study was supported by National\nRebecca Utz's participation was supported by an NIA predoctoral trainee-\nship.

In\nthis study, we defined social participation as social in-\nteraction with persons other than a spouse. The term\nsocial participation as used here loosely describes\nwhat other researchers have termed organizational\naffiliations, friendship ties, kinship networks, social\nconnectedness, social support, or social integration\nparticipation is a multidimensional construct incor-\nporating both formal (e.g., meeting attendance, reli-\ngious participation, and volunteer obligations) and\ninformal (e.g., telephone contact and social interac-\ntions with friends) social roles.\nThe Effect of Widowhood on Social Participation\nThe bereavement literature has generally agreed\nthat widowed persons who have higher levels of social\nsupport also have higher levels of well-being and life\nThese findings suggest that the more active one is\nafter widowhood, the easier the adjustment process\nmay be. Widowed persons often have increased con-\ntact with friends and family during the initial funeral\nand mourning period (Lopata, 1996). However, it is\nunknown whether widowhood creates only a tempo-\nrary or a more enduring change in widowed persons'\nThe current study explores older adults' level of social\nparticipation 6 months after the loss of their spouses.\nIt compares widowed persons with continuously mar-\nried control participants to see if changes in social\nparticipation among older adults are due specifically\nto the event of widowhood or generally to the effect\nof age or the passage of time.\nTheoretical Explanations: Activity, Disengagement,\nand Continuity Theories\nFor purposes of this analysis, we have adapted\nthree prominent theories from social gerontology to\nproffer specific hypotheses regarding the effect of late-\nlife widowhood on social participation. First, activity\ntheory (Cavan, Burgess, Havinghurst, & Goldham-\nmer, 1949) claims that as one experiences disability\nand other age-related declines, social roles may be-\ncome unattainable. As a way to preserve their self-\nidentity in the face of these deficits, aging adults will\nreplace lost social roles with new, compensatory activ-\nities. Thus, activity theory offers the following hypoth-\nesis: Although both widowed persons and controls will\nincrease their social participation over time in re-\nsponse to age-related deficits and losses, widowed\npersons will exhibit higher levels of social participa-\ntion compared with nonwidowed persons because of\nsimultaneously losing the multiple social roles that\nwere tied to the marriage or the spouse.\nSecond, disengagement theory (Cumming & Henry,\n1961) posits that aging adults will withdraw from soci-\nety and vice versa. The mutual process of disengagement\nmakes room for younger generations and prevents un-\nnecessary disruptions in the social system caused by\ndeaths among the older population. In the context of\nthis analysis, disengagement theory offers the following\nhypothesis: Although both widowed persons and con-\ntrols will slowly disengage from social activities as they\nage, widowed persons will exhibit lower levels of social\nparticipation when compared with similarly aged mar-\nried persons because the experience of losing a spouse\nserves as a striking reminder of one's own mortality and\nhow disruptive death can be for survivors.\nThird, continuity theory (Atchley, 1989) rests on\nthe assumption that individuals seek to maintain role\nstability throughout the life course. Although the ag-\ning process may present an individual with changing\nnormative expectations or possible disruptions in the\navailability of social roles, older adults will attempt to\npreserve continuity of attitudes, dispositions, prefer-\nences, and behaviors throughout their life course.\nThus, prior behaviors and attitudes are often the sin-\ngle most significant predictors of present or future be-\nhaviors. In terms of widowhood, the most successful\nwidow(er) would be the individual who is most effec-\ntive in maintaining the lifestyle he or she developed\nearlier in life. The specific hypothesis generated from\ncontinuity theory suggests that widows and nonwid-\nows will not necessarily differ in terms of social par-\nticipation; rather, prior levels of social participation\nwill determine current levels of social participation.\nGerontologists have debated the explanatory power\nof these theories since their inception (see Bengston &\nSchaie, 1999, for review). Critics of continuity theory\nsuggest that continuity of lifestyle and role stability is\nnearly impossible considering the inevitability of role\nloss through events such as retirement, death of loved\nones, and the emptying of the familial nest (Matras,\n1990). Disengagement and activity theories are criti-\ncized for being far too simplistic in their explanations--\ncan one variable really explain why older adults adapt\nto the aging process in the way they do (Quadagno &\nStreet, 1996)? Despite the considerable criticisms that\nthese theories have garnered, the hypotheses stated\nabove offer a theoretical springboard for the proposed\nanalyses while offering a unique opportunity to empir-\nically evaluate the utility of these theories.\nPrior Research and its Methodological Limitations\nGiven the criticisms related to the three theories, it\nshould not be surprising that the empirical evidence is\nalso inconclusive. Chambre (1984) found support for\ncontinuity theory, showing that people maintain sim-\nden Hoonard (1998) found support for disengage-\nment theory, suggesting that widows and widowers\nspend less time participating in recreational activities\nthan before. S. K. Gallagher and Gerstel (1993) found\nsupport for activity theory, showing that widowed\nwomen spend significantly more time with a larger\nnumber of friends compared with married women. In\na small-sample analysis of widows and widowers,\nHollstein (1998) identified three typical patterns of\nchange in social networks, with each pattern roughly\nequivalent to one of the three theories. Ward, Logan,\nand Spitze (1992) also found that patterns of social\ninvolvement vary by marital status, suggesting that\nmarried couples may not need additional forms of\nsocial support, whereas widow(er)s may seek addi-\ntional social support to compensate for the loss of\nspousal intimacy. Given these disparate findings, the role\nof marital status and the effect of marital transitions in\ndetermining older adults' activity levels are unclear.\nWe believe the empirical literature is inconclusive\nfor four reasons. First, findings across studies may not\nbe comparable because analyses are based on very dif-\nferent types of social participation. Widowhood may\naffect involvement with particular types of activities\nand not others. Second, bereavement studies are often\nbased on female-only samples, making it impossible to\nassess whether adjustment patterns vary by gender.\nGiven the wives' predilection to maintain social net-\nworks and kinship ties for the marital couple (Gold-\nGallagher, 2000), men and women may exhibit mark-\nedly different behavioral and emotional outcomes in\nresponse to widowhood (Miller & Wortman, in press;\nUmberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Third, most\nresearch has relied on retrospective accounts of one's\nsocial involvement before widowhood. Retrospective\naccounts reflect the survivors' reinterpretation of\ntheir previous life, thus biasing the true levels of activ-\nity before the loss. Fourth, empirical analyses related\nto widowhood and social support rarely use a control\ngroup from which to differentiate the effects of wid-\nowhood from the effects of advancing age or the pas-\nsage of time. Given that widowed samples are often\nolder, sicker, and more emotionally distraught than\nnonwidowed samples, past studies may have attrib-\nuted reduced levels of social participation among\nwidowed persons to spousal bereavement rather than\nto selection traits. Without a control group and with-\nout consideration of the true levels of baseline social\nparticipation, the effects attributed to widowhood\nmay have been overstated in past studies.\nData from the CLOC study make it possible to\novercome each of the above limitations and thus pro-\nvide a more complete answer to how social participa-\ntion is affected by late-life widowhood. First, the\nCLOC data include two separate multi-item measures\nof social engagement (formal and informal social par-\nticipation) to explore whether the effect of widowhood\ndiffers by type of activity. Second, the CLOC sample is\nstratified by gender. Third, the CLOC study contains\nan age-matched control group, which distinguishes\nbetween widowhood and age effects. Fourth, the\nquality and breadth of baseline (prewidowhood) data\neliminates potential selection bias found in widow-\nhood research. In sum, this article explores how older\nadults alter their everyday social participation follow-\ning widowhood and compares these results to the pre-\ndictions derived from activity, continuity, and disen-\ngagement theories.\nMethods\nSample\nAnalyses are based on the CLOC study. CLOC is a\nprospective study of widowhood that used a two-\nstage area probability sampling technique to collect\ninformation from married individuals in Detroit,\nMichigan. Eligibility was restricted to noninstitution-\nalized English-speaking married couples in which the\nhusband was at least 65 years old. Of those sampled,\n1,532 individuals completed a baseline interview,\nyielding a 68% response rate.\nvital status of the respondent's spouse was monitored\nwith monthly death records from the state of Michi-\ngan. The National Death Index was used to verify all\nspouses' deaths. Those respondents who lost spouses\nduring the study period were reinterviewed 6, 18,\nand 48 months after the deaths. Controls from the\noriginal sample, individually matched on age, race,\nand sex, were also reinterviewed at comparable\ntimes. Because the Wave 1 interview occurred 6\nmonths after the death of the spouse, not 6 months\nafter the initial baseline interview, there are signifi-\ncant variations in interview timing depending on\nwhen spouses died in relation to the baseline inter-\nview. Baseline assessments were more temporally dis-\ntant for those who lost their spouses at later dates. To\naddress the differences in interview timing, all analy-\nses controlled for the duration (in months) between\nthe baseline interview and the Wave 1 interview. This\ncontrol variable was not significant in any of the\nanalyses, nor was it significant when interacting with\nwidowhood status.\nAnalyses were based on a sample of 297 older\nboth the baseline and Wave 1 interviews. The ana-\nnonwidowed controls. Women were oversampled in\norder to maximize the number of bereaved respon-\ndents during the 5-year study period. Controls were\navailable for only some of the bereaved spouses be-\ncause funding for the control sample was cut from\nthe proposed budget and not reinstated until halfway\nthrough the data collection period for Wave 1. A final\ncentered weight, adjusting for unequal probabilities\nof selection and nonresponse, was applied to all data\nbefore analyses were performed. The unweighted\nMeasures\nDependent Variables.--Two statistically and con-\nceptually distinct dimensions of social participation\nwere considered. Informal social participation ( \n.52) is an index consisting of the following: (a) How\noften do you get together with friends, neighbors, or\nrelatives and do things like go out together or visit in\neach other's homes? and (b) in a typical week, about\nhow many times do you talk on the telephone with\nfriends, neighbors, or relatives? Formal social partic-\nipation (  .71) included the following three items:\n(a) How many hours did you spend doing volunteer\nwork during the last 6 months? (b) how often do you\nattend meetings or programs of groups, clubs, or or-\nganizations that you belong to? and (c) how often do\nyou attend religious services? Each item was mea-\nsured with a five-category response ranging from at\nleast once a day to less than once a month. The scales\nwere standardized, with higher values indicating\nhigher levels of social participation. Although un-\nstandardized scales produced similar findings, we\nchose to use the standardized dependent variables for\nease of interpretation and comparability.\nPredictor Variables.--Widowhood identified those\npersons who became widowed between the baseline\nand Wave 1 interviews. Baseline formal and informal\nsocial participation were identical to the two scales\ndescribed above, except they were based on baseline\nresponses rather than Wave 1 responses.\nControl Variables.--Both the social participation\nand the widowhood literature have asserted that de-\nmographic characteristics are important determinants\nTherefore, all analyses controlled for sex (a dichoto-\nmous variable indicating female), age (measured con-\ntinuously in years at the time of the baseline inter-\nview), education (a continuous measure ranging from\n3 to 17 completed years of schooling), total house-\nhold income at baseline (natural log of income), home\nownership at baseline (a dichotomous variable where\n1  owns home), and race (a dichotomous variable\nindicating White).\nConfounding Variables.--Analyses also included\nseveral variables thought to expose potentially spuri-\nous relationships between widowhood and social par-\nticipation levels. Variables considered in the analyses\ninclude individual- and couple-level health dynamics,\nindividual personality characteristics that may make\none more resilient or \"protected\" in times of stress\nor constraints that may affect one's ability to engage\nin social activity. Widowed persons may significantly\ndiffer from nonwidowed persons on these variables;\ntherefore, the inclusion of these confounding vari-\nables in the analyses is imperative to distinguish the\neffects of widowhood from those associated with age-\nrelated declines. Other couple-level characteristics such\nas the quality of the marital relationship or the nature\nof the death itself are important predictors of grief\n(Carr et al., 2000; Carr, House, Wortman, Nesse, &\nKessler, 2001), but such variables did not account for\nthe variation in social participation following the loss\nand thus were not included in the analyses. Presum-\nably, the baseline measures of social participation suf-\nficiently captured the relevant qualities of the mar-\nriage and the nature of the death. With the exception\nof depression, all the following variables were mea-\nsured at baseline.\nTo assess the role of individual- and couple-level\nhealth characteristics, analyses included three mea-\nsures of respondent's health and two measures of\nspouse's health. Activity limitation (  .77) was a\nstandardized scale measuring the respondent's func-\ntional health and disability, with higher values indi-\ncating higher levels of activity of daily living impair-\nment. Self-rated health was a dichotomous variable\nindicating poor or fair baseline health. The respon-\ndent's depression (  .81) was assessed with a subset\nof 9 negative items from the 20-item Center for Epi-\ndemiological Studies\u00adDepression scale (Radloff, 1977),\nwith higher values indicating higher levels of depres-\nsion at Wave 1. Although the three measures of indi-\nvidual health were significantly correlated (activity\nlimitation and self-rated health  .37; activity limita-\ntion and depression  .13; self-rated health and de-\npression  .16; p  .05), each tapped into a distinct\naspect of health that may influence one's social partic-\nipation levels. Activity limitation described physical\nimpediment to activity performance, depression was\nassociated with reduced energy levels and activity in-\nvolvement, and self-rated health was a global mea-\nsure of overall health assessment. Two additional\nhealth measures were included to assess the dynamic\nrole of couple-level health characteristics. Spouse\nhealth indicated those respondents who reported\ntheir spouse's baseline health as poor or fair. Provided\ncare for spouse was a dichotomy indicating those re-\nspondents who provided in-home care for a spouse.\nSpouses who provided at least 1 hr of care per week\nwere identified as the baseline caregivers.\nOne personality measure was included in the anal-\nysis. Extraversion (  .53) was a standardized scale\nrepresenting how emotionally connected, socially ac-\ntive, and outgoing the respondent was. Higher values\nindicate higher levels of extraversion. Other personal-\nity characteristics such as self-esteem, openness, agree-\nableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability\nwere initially included, but were later excluded be-\ncause they were insignificant predictors of social\nparticipation.\nFinally, three variables represent possible constraints\nto activity performance. Employed was a dichotomous\nvariable indicating persons who worked for pay at\nbaseline. Employment may enhance social participa-\ntion by expanding one's social network or limit it\nby representing a competing use of free time. Drive\nautomobile was a dichotomous variable indicating\nthose persons who drove an automobile at baseline.\nOlder adults who are able to drive themselves may be\nmore socially engaged as they have the means for self-\ndetermined transportation. No children identified re-\nspondents who had no living children. Children may\nencourage their elderly parents to remain actively en-\ngaged in social activities.\nAnalytic Plan\nThe analyses used a variety of descriptive tech-\nniques to describe the patterns of social participation\nfollowing the loss of a spouse. Some analyses com-\npared widows with controls in order to differentiate\nthe effects of widowhood from aging, whereas addi-\ntional analyses compared subgroups within the wid-\nowed sample to assess the differential responses to\nwidowhood. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) re-\ngression techniques, we compared widowed persons\nwith controls to estimate formal and informal social\nparticipation levels 6 months postwidowhood. Esti-\nmated regression coefficients for widowhood and\nbaseline social participation were evaluated in a test\nof the three competing hypotheses. If the effect of\nwidowhood was positive, support for the activity the-\nory would be achieved; if the effect of widowhood\nwas negative, support for the disengagement theory\nwould be achieved; and if the effect of baseline social\nparticipation was positive, support for the continuity\ntheory would be achieved.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nTable 1 demonstrates that the widowed and non-\nwidowed samples were remarkably similar in terms\nof major demographic characteristics. The average re-\nspondent was approximately 70 years old with nearly\na high school education and an annual household in-\nand had at least one child. More than two thirds\ndrove automobiles, and few (15%) were employed.\nAlthough respondents did experience moderate activ-\nity limitation levels, only a quarter to a third of re-\nspondents reported their health as being fair or poor.\nA few notable, but expected, differences existed be-\ntween the two samples. Widowed persons had signif-\nicantly higher levels of depression compared with the\ncontrols (p  .001). Widowed persons were more\nlikely than controls to have provided care for their\nspouses at baseline (p  .001) and to report their\nspouses' baseline health as poor or fair (p  .001).\nFigure 1 graphically illustrates the mean levels of\nsocial participation at baseline and Wave 1 for both\nthe widowed and nonwidowed samples. Compared\nwith the still-married persons, the informal social\nparticipation of widow(er)s was significantly lower at\nTable 1.

On the other hand, formal social participa-\ntion did not differ by marital status. Using a repeated\nmeasures t test, we found that controls exhibited a\nsignificant decline in both informal (p  .001) and\nformal social participation (p  .05), whereas the so-\ncial participation of widowed persons remained rela-\ntively constant over time. These descriptive results\nsuggest that the social participation of widowed per-\nsons significantly differs from that of their married\ncounterparts. These results also question whether\nwidowed persons alter their social participation in cu-\nrious ways before the actual death of their spouses.\nTo explore whether adjustment to widowhood be-\ngins before the date of death, Table 2 presents OLS re-\ngression coefficients predicting baseline (preloss) levels\nof social participation. As suggested in the descriptive\nanalyses, those persons who later became widowed\nhad significantly lower levels of baseline informal par-\nticipation than the continuously married (informal\n\n.29, p  .01). Spousal health was also an important\npredictor of reduced social engagement (informal\n\n.31, p  .001). This analysis suggests that adjust-\nments do occur before the actual loss and reinforces\nthe importance of considering characteristics of both\nthe husband and the wife when assessing the daily ac-\ntivities of older adults.\nThe Effect of Widowhood on Social Participation\nThe multivariate analysis presented in Table 3 fur-\nther explores how the social participation levels of\nolder adults change over time and in response to wid-\nowhood. Model 1 showed the effect of widowhood\ncontrolling for demographic characteristics; Model 2\nadded in potentially mediating variables including the\nhealth status of both the husband and the wife, indi-\nvidual personality characteristics, and other struc-\ntural constraints; and Model 3 controlled for baseline\nsocial participation levels.\nAs shown in Model 1 and replicated in Models 2\u00ad\n3, widowhood significantly predicted informal social\nparticipation levels, but not formal social participa-\ntion levels. Model 3 showed that widowed persons\nhad informal social participation scores 0.44 stan-\ndard deviation units higher than nonwidowed per-\nsons, whereas widowed persons did not differ from\ncontrols in their level of formal social participation.\nAlthough not shown here, we ran identical models\npredicting social participation 18 months postwidow-\nhood. The resulting coefficients were similar to those\npresented in Table 3, suggesting that changes in social\nparticipation occurred within the first 6 months after\nwidowhood and continued to persist across longer\ntime horizons. In sum, widowhood yielded a sus-\ntained increase in informal activity levels, but no\nchange in formal social participation levels.\nModel 2 considered the effects of individual- and\ncouple-level characteristics that may predispose one\nto certain levels of social engagement. As expected,\nextraverted persons participated more in social activ-\nities (formal\nwhereas depressed persons participated less in infor-\nmal social activities (informal\ning an automobile and not having children were also\nimportant predictors of increased activity. Surpris-\ningly, neither individual health nor spouse's health\npredicted level of social participation at Wave 1.\nHowever, as previously noted in Table 2, spousal\nhealth characteristics were influential in determining\nbaseline levels of social participation.\nModel 3 considered baseline social participation as\na possible predictor of future social participation.\nBaseline social participation was highly influential in\ndetermining subsequent social participation, reveal-\ning that persons with high social participation at\nbaseline continued to have relatively high social par-\nticipation at Wave 1 (formal\n\n.31, p  .001). The addition of baseline social partic-\nipation in Model 3 significantly improved the fit of\nthe models, as evidenced by the increasing of the\nadjusted R2 from .13 to .46 for formal social partici-\npation and from .16 to .29 for informal social partic-\nipation. Despite the potentially disruptive effect of\nwidowhood, continuity prevailed as widowed per-\nsons adjusted to the loss of their marriage partners\nFigure 1.

The Widowhood  Sex interaction term was not\nsignificant in any model, suggesting that the effect of\nwidowhood on social participation was similar for\nwidows and widowers. The analyses also considered\nwhether the effects of the predictor variables differed\nby whether one becomes widowed or remains contin-\nuously married. Identified with a superscript a in Ta-\nble 3, widowhood interacted with income, education,\nand race, signifying that African American widowed\npersons and those with lower socioeconomic status\nhave significantly lower levels of social participation\nthan nonwidowed persons or widowed persons of\nhigher socioeconomic status. Widowed persons with\nno children also exhibited particularly low levels of so-\ncial participation following widowhood.\nGiven the above analyses, it is unclear if the in-\ncreases in social participation among widowed per-\nsons were due to the bereaved seeking out additional\nactivity or to the inclination of friends and relatives to\noffer care and support to recently widowed persons.\nAdditional analyses using only the widowed sample\nshed light on whether the increased social participa-\ntion was a result of passive reaction or active re-\nsponse. A majority of widowed persons (71%) had\nthe same amount of interest in having contact with\nrelatives and friends as when their spouses were alive;\nhowever, more than a third (35%) reported that\nfriends and relatives showed more interest in having\ncontact with them when they became widowed. Very\nfew widowed persons expressed less interest in social\nparticipation following widowhood, either on their\npart (12%) or on the part of friends and relatives\n(6%). The results presented in Figure 2 suggest that\nthe predicted increase in informal social participation\nnoted in Table 3 is perhaps attributable to being\nsought out by concerned friends and relatives rather\nthan to seeking out additional forms of social activity\nto fill the void left by the spouse's death. Sex differ-\nences are not apparent in this analysis, meaning that\nmen and women received increased support from\nfriends and relatives equally. Although for men the\ndeath of their wives often represents the loss of their\nsocial coordinator, widows and widowers were likely\nto exhibit similar behavioral outcomes because much\nof the change in social participation is attributable to\nreceiving additional support rather than to coordinat-\ning additional social activities.\nAlthough continuity prevails in their behavioral\nadjustments, most widowed persons considered in-\ncreased social activity an effective way to combat the\npsychological distress associated with the loss. Figure\n3 shows that a majority of widowed persons (87%)\nsaid that they \"tried to keep busy or tried to get in-\nvolved in some activity as a way to cope with the neg-\native effects of widowhood.\" When comparing the\ndemographic characteristics of these two groups,\nthose respondents who reported increasing their ac-\ntivity tended to be younger and have higher incomes,\nand were more likely to own their home, be White,\nand drive an automobile. If increased social participa-\ntion is beneficial to the successful adaptation to wid-\nowhood, older widow(er)s who are not as economi-\ncally well off are perhaps structurally disadvantaged\nin their ability to successfully cope with the poten-\ntially devastating losses associated with widowhood.\nDiscussion\nSummary and Conclusions\nThis research explored how the social participation\nof older married and widowed persons changes over\ntime and whether theoretical explanations from so-\ncial gerontology are useful in explaining the patterns\nof change. We found that social participation consists\nof two distinct subtypes--formal and informal--that\nFigure 2. Do widowed persons seek out more social participation or do others seek out widowed persons (n  210 widowed\npersons)?\nrespond differently to widowhood. Widowed persons,\nboth men and women, exhibited a sustained increase in\ninformal social participation following spousal loss,\nwhereas formal social participation levels did not fluc-\ntuate over time or in response to widowhood. A ma-\njority of widowed persons admitted to using in-\ncreased social participation as an active coping\nstrategy to deal with the negative effects of widow-\nhood. These behavioral patterns suggest that social\nparticipation, particularly informal activities such as\ntelephone contact and getting together with friends, is\nan aspect of daily life that is deeply affected by late-\nlife bereavement. Formal social participation may not\nprovide the emotional and instrumental support that\ninformal social participation does, thus explaining\nwhy formal social participation levels remain con-\nstant after widowhood.\nFour broad themes, which encompass broader is-\nsues related to late-life bereavement, characterize the\nmajor findings of these analyses. The first theme holds\nthat a desire for continuity dominates the adjustment\nprocess following widowhood. Widowed persons over-\nwhelmingly expressed a desire for continuity when\nasked about how much contact they preferred to have\nwith others compared with how much contact they\nhad before the loss. Analyses demonstrated that prior\nsocial participation is, by far, the best predictor of\nsubsequent social participation. Despite the disrup-\ntion caused by widowhood, survivors displayed tre-\nmendous resiliency when adjusting their levels of\nsocial activity and community involvement. In both\npreferences and actual behaviors, older adults dem-\nonstrated a sense of continuity when faced with the\nunfortunate experience of becoming widowed.\nThe second theme contends that widowhood is a\nprocess rather than a discrete event or static state.\nMuch of the past research has characterized widow-\nhood as a discrete event defined by the spouse's date\nof death or as a marital status defined as being wid-\nowed rather than married, single, or divorced. Past re-\nsearch has largely been based on cross-sectional or\nretrospective data, whereas the current analyses used\nprospective, longitudinal data from a widow\u00adcontrol\nsample. Our findings, using the methodologically\nunique CLOC study, insinuate that widowhood is a\nprocess of adjustment that begins before the actual\ndate of death and extends well beyond the initial\nmourning period associated with spousal bereave-\nment. Future widow(er)s and those with ill spouses\nmay have a sense-of-death forewarning and devote\ntheir time and energy to their spouses in their final\ndays or months, thus reducing their preloss levels of\nsocial engagement. Following the actual death, wid-\nowed persons continue their process of adjustment,\ngenerally exhibiting a sustained increase in extrafa-\nmilial social activities. The use of prospective, longi-\ntudinal data is imperative to evaluate the processual\nnature of widowhood.\nA third theme concerns the interrelatedness of so-\ncial actors. Although only the survivor assumes the\nwidowed label, the effects of widowhood are not ex-\nperienced in isolation. We found that the increased\nsocial participation among the widowed sample was\nperhaps a function of others rallying around the be-\nreaved, rather than of the survivor's seeking out addi-\ntional social activity. Consistent with past research,\nolder adults receive an outpouring of support from\nfriends and relatives during times of perceived need\nthat social involvement increases after widowhood\nbecause friends, relatives, and neighbors uncondition-\nally offer emotional and instrumental support to the\nrecently bereaved. As childless widow(er)s exhibit\nparticularly low levels of social integration, kin may\nbe particularly crucial to the adjustment process by\nencouraging elderly parents to remain socially en-\ngaged. Increased social participation, whether pas-\nsively or actively acquired, is a reflection of how mul-\ntiple actors experience and influence the transition to\nwidowhood.\nA fourth and final theme assumes that there are\nmultiple pathways to individual bereavement out-\nFigure 3. Do older adults alter their social participation following the loss of a spouse (n  210 widowed persons)? T tests were used\nto assess significant differences between means; *p  .05.\ncomes. Our findings imply that the patterns of behav-\nioral adjustment following widowhood depend on\nthe psychological, familial, and socioeconomic re-\nsources of the survivor. Some widowed persons--\nwhether due to race, class, or some other constraint\nsuch as the availability of transportation or the pres-\nence of children--exhibit significantly lower levels of\nsocial participation than widowed persons with more\nfavorable characteristics. The traditional theories of\naging, as well as the general bereavement literature,\nimplicitly assume that all persons have equal resources\nas they age. Our findings question the universality or\nwidespread availability of the economic, intellectual,\nand interpersonal resources needed to successfully ad-\njust to old age generally or the event of widowhood\nspecifically. Because the pathway to widowhood and\nits ensuing grief may be structurally determined\nand diversified by the particular resources available to\nthe survivor, bereavement research must consider\nboth the material and the interpersonal resources\navailable to widow(er)s in order to understand the ad-\njustment process.\nEvaluation of Activity, Disengagement,\nand Continuity Theories\nIn addition to providing an empirical analysis of\nthe behavioral adjustments related to late-life widow-\nhood, we also explored the utility of three theories\nfrom social gerontology to explain why older adults\nadjust their social participation levels. Despite its crit-\nicism as an explanatory model, continuity theory pre-\nvails as the most applicable theory (among the three\ntheories considered) for the longitudinal study of\nsocial participation among older adults. Both married\nand widowed persons are likely to exhibit levels of\nsocial participation in the future similar to those they\ndisplayed earlier in the life course. Additional results,\nusing the widowed-only sample, indicated that older\nadults preferred to maintain similar pre- and postloss\nlevels of contact with relatives and friends. These\nfindings offer convincing support for the existence of\nand desire for continuity, throughout the life course\nas well as in the face of widowhood. However, our\nanalyses, which are limited to persons older than 65,\ncannot capture whether individuals may have selec-\ntively narrowed their social networks before age 65\n(Carstensen, 1992). Developmental research has sug-\ngested that social networks are highly adaptive\nthroughout the life course, with preferences for cer-\ntain social partners beginning as early as age 3 (Ma-\nIf this is the case, have widowed persons really main-\ntained continuity throughout the life course or have\nthey merely exhibited stability between the two waves\nof data collection?\nGiven our finding that widowed persons have in-\ncreased levels of informal social participation, do the\nanalyses offer empirical support for the activity hy-\npothesis? Activity theory implies that the person ex-\nperiencing the losses will actively replace the lost\nsocial roles with compensatory social roles, rather\nthan passively acquire increased social support as\nsuggested by our analyses. Thus, although the direc-\ntion of change is reminiscent of activity theory, we ar-\ngue that our findings offer little empirical support for\nactivity theory. Nor do the empirical results offer con-\nvincing support for the disengagement hypothesis, as\nwidowed persons do not exhibit significant declines\nin social participation following the deaths of their\nspouses, as hypothesized. Nevertheless, soon-to-be\nwidowed persons or persons with sick spouses do\nhave reduced levels of social participation, suggesting\nthat older adults may experience a social withdrawal in\ntimes of spousal illness or impending spousal death.\nAlthough this exercise in theory testing is largely\ninconclusive, it is not altogether futile. None of the\ntheories, as hypothesized in the context of widow-\nhood, are wholly supported nor wholly refuted. This\nlimited and tempered support provides further testa-\nment to the inability of the classical theories of social\ngerontology to adequately explain the empirical real-\nities of aging (Bengston, Rice, & Johnson, 1999). A\ndevelopmental or lifespan perspective may prove use-\nful in assessing late-life changes (Antonucci, 1989;\nBaltes, Reese, & Lipsitt, 1980). For example, Laura\ntional selectivity and Toni Antonucci and her colleagues'\n& Antonnuci, 1980) social convoy model seem to be\nmore appropriate in understanding the changing social\nrelations among older adults. Socioemotional selec-\ntivity theory suggests that levels of social participa-\ntion in late life are a culmination of strategic selec-\ntions made throughout the life course to form social\nnetworks that maximize social and emotional gains\nand minimize social and emotional risks. The social\nconvoy model states that people age throughout the\nlife course, experiencing the stress of transitions and\nturning points with a highly selected group of people\nfrom whom they derive a basis for self-identity as well\nas emotional and instrumental support.\nDespite activity, continuity, and disengagement\ntheories' inimitable presence in social gerontology,\ntheir explanatory power has fallen short in trying to\nexplain how or why older adults alter their social par-\nticipation in the face of widowhood. These classic\ntheories of aging cannot capture the diversity in reac-\ntions or the processual nature of the human life\ncourse, whereas developmental perspectives such as\nsocioemotional selectivity theory and the social con-\nvoy model may be more successful in understanding\nthe ongoing adjustments that unfold over the entire\nlife course. As opposed to the grand theories of so-\ncial gerontology, middle-range theories that consider\nunique life trajectories may provide the most promis-\ning avenue for future theory building related to late-\nlife stress and adjustment.\nLimitations and Future Research\nAlthough the CLOC data have provided both\nempirical and theoretical findings related to old age\nadjustment, no study is without limitations. Our\nmeasure of social participation is an improvement on\nearlier studies, in that it captures statistically and con-\nceptually unique realms of social engagement and\ncommunity involvement. By separating formal and\ninformal social roles, we were able to distinguish the\nunique effects of spousal loss on two broad types of\nsocial participation. Nevertheless, future research\nmay benefit from evaluating the effects of spousal loss\non even more specific types of social participation. In\naddition, future research should consider including a\nmeasure of the subjective meaning derived from each\ntype of activity, as past research has suggested that\nrate of contact may not capture the emotional quality\nof the relationship or activity (Rosow, 1967). Perhaps\nthe quality or value attached to an activity affects\none's willingness to adopt or abandon that role upon\nwidowhood. Future studies may also want to explore\nthe perceived stress associated with particular behav-\nioral changes, as this may expand understanding of\nthe mechanisms that create psychological distress fol-\nlowing widowhood. The loss of marriage represents\nnot only the loss of a significant other, but the loss of\nthe instrumental arrangements between the couple\n(Miller & Wortman, in press; Umberson et al., 1992).\nThe stress and strain produced by changes in the sur-\nvivor's instrumental and social spheres may elucidate\nthe differential vulnerabilities to psychological dis-\ntress following widowhood.\nFuture research should also consider the role of\ncouple-level characteristics that determine one's level\nof social integration. We have found that the partner's\nhealth status acutely influences the social activities of\nolder adults. This finding reiterates the importance of\nconsidering individual behaviors within the context\nof related social actors (Elder, 1998). Using couple-\nlevel data, future research should explore the patterns\nof social participation across the life course, paying\nparticular attention to transitions in marital status\nand the underlying health characteristics of both hus-\nband and wife. Consideration of both the husband\nand the wife is necessary in order to understand the\ndynamics of the marital relationship and the proces-\nsual nature of widowhood.\nPractical Applications and Implications\nFinally, the results derived from the preceding anal-\nyses should be extended to devise effective care and\nsupport strategies for the recently bereaved. A clear\nmajority (87%) of widow(er)s admit to actively keep-\ning busy or getting involved as a way to cope with\nfeelings of grief and loneliness; therefore, increased\nsocial activity is one way older adults can potentially\nreduce the perceived psychological distress associated\nwith widowhood. Although prior research has consis-\ntently found that higher levels of social integration\nyield favorable physical and mental health outcomes\nsuming that activity for activity's sake is the most effec-\ntive way to provide support for the recently bereaved.\nSenior centers play a vital role in keeping older adults\nengaged in the community. However, the vast major-\nity of older adults do not take advantage of such for-\nmal integration efforts (Carstensen, 1991). Instead,\nolder adults, particularly those experiencing a devas-\ntating or stressful loss such as widowhood, tend to\nrely on the convoy of lifelong social relations from\nwhom they derive support, self-definition, and a sense\nof stability and continuity (Antonucci & Jackson,\ntrate that widowed persons, in both their intentions\nand their behaviors, prefer to maintain the relation-\nships and activities that have been most meaningful\nand rewarding throughout the life course. Thus, sim-\nply providing widowed persons with an abundance of\nnew activities will not be as effective as having others\n(e.g., family members, friends, religious communities,\nand neighbors) assist them in achieving a continuity\nof lifestyle and stability in social relations.\nIntervention efforts should aim to minimize the\ndisruption in social roles rather than maximize the\navailability of compensatory social activities. One\nsuch proposal is to offer affordable and flexible trans-\nportation to older persons, especially to those who no\nlonger drive. The use of the telephone, the Internet,\nand other means of communication that allow older\nadults to maintain contact despite geographic dis-\ntance or physical impairment (Litwak & Longino,\n1987) may also be invaluable to successful adaptation\nto widowhood. Although support via communication\ntechnology may be a more effective support strategy\nfor future cohorts of older adults, any programmatic\nor policy intervention should seek to minimize dis-\nruption in daily activities rather than to construct a\nnew life with new activities and new acquaintances.\nFurthermore, intervention efforts should target those\npersons most likely to benefit from the outreach ef-\nforts. Our findings imply that persons with low socio-\neconomic resources and those with no children may\nbe particularly vulnerable to social isolation upon wid-\nowhood. Also the soon-to-be widow(er) and those per-\nsons with ailing spouses may need as much support as\nrecently widowed persons. Outreach efforts, therefore,\ncould be directed at married couples experiencing the\nfinal stages of a spouse's life rather than only at those\npersons who have recently lost spouses.\nThe findings from this study not only expand our\nknowledge about the daily social adjustments that ac-\ncompany late-life bereavement, but also add to the on-\ngoing debates in social gerontology regarding the util-\nity of activity, disengagement, and continuity theories\nto explain the variations in how individuals adapt to\nthe aging process. In addition, this article provides\nmultiple suggestions for future research and offers\npractical implications that may help families and\npractitioners offer more effective care and support to\nthe recently bereaved.\nReferences\nAnderson, T.
