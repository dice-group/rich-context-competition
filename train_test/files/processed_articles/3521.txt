We hypothesized that RYGB-\ninduced anatomic GI changes modify\nGI metabolic functions, thereby affecting\nsystemic metabolism. The small intestine is a\nneuroendocrine organ that expresses more\nthan 30 gene-encoding hormones under\nseveral cell-signalling pathways and pro-\nduces hundreds of bioactive peptides that\nparticipate in food control and glycaemic\ninduced anatomic changes have been\nshown to modify intestinal gene-encoding\nhormone expression, in turn affecting glu-\ncose metabolism.15 Another consequence of\nintestinal anatomic changes is alteration of\nthe resident microbiota, which appears to\ninfluence a wide range of diseases including\nobesity and T2DM.16 After RYGB,\nincreased richness of the intestinal micro-\nbiota was observed and found to be asso-\nciated with changes in white adipose tissue\ngene expression.17 This observation suggests\na possible role of intestinal bacteria as\ndrivers of postoperative metabolic effects.\nMultifactorial mechanisms can thus\ninfluence the metabolic effects potentially\ninduced by RYGB, implying the need for a\nmulti-integrated study approach. We are\nconducting a prospective clinical study to\nexamine whether T2DM remission after\nRYGB is driven by postoperative changes\nin GI ``omic'' functions. The SURgically\ninduced Metabolic effects on the Human\nGastroIntestinal Tract (SURMetaGIT)\nstudy considers the human GI tract to be a\ncentral organ driving RYGB-induced meta-\nbolic effects, including not only TD2M\nremission and recurrence but also improve-\nment or worsening (e.g., micronutrient\ndeficiency) of other obesity-associated\ncomorbidities. The main challenges faced\nin the development of our protocol were\nminimization of patient risk associated with\nbiopsy collections and identification of key\nassociations between postoperative GI\ntranscriptomic changes and local and sys-\ntemic responses related to surgically induced\nmetabolic effects. With the intent of facil-\nitating researchers' performance of studies\ninvolving multi-integrated analysis, this art-\nicle describes the design of the\nSURMetaGIT protocol and discusses how\nwe have overcome these challenges. We also\npresent the initial results of the patient\nselection and data collection, which reflect\nthe success achieved by the practical appli-\ncation of this protocol.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThe SURMetaGIT study is an obser-\nvational, longitudinal, prospective study\ntesting the general hypothesis that RYGB-\ninduced anatomic alterations modify GI\nfunction as an adaptive mechanism that\naffects systemic metabolism. The study\nprotocol comprises several steps to con-\njunctly investigate associations between\npotential RYGB-induced changes in GI\ngene expression and postoperative bio-\nmarkers related to improvement or worsening\nof obesity-associated comorbidities, mainly\nT2DM remission. The SURMetaGIT study\nwas approved by the local ethics committee\nThe protocol is currently being implemented;\nthe steps completed and those still in the\nprocess of completion are shown in Figure 1.\nPatient selection\nPatients were recruited from the Surgical\nGastroenterology Department of the\nHospital das Cli\u00b4nicas at the Medical\nSchool of the University of Sa\n~ o Paulo\n(HC-FMUSP) according to the following\ninclusion criteria: female sex (approximately\n80% of patients undergoing BS at HC-\nFMUSP are female), age of 18 to 60 years,\nestablished diagnosis of T2DM (fasting glu-\ncose concentration of ! 126 mg/dL and\nglycated haemoglobin level of !6.5%) and/\nor use of an oral antidiabetic drug, body\nmass index of !35 kg/m2, candidacy for\nRYGB, absence of a diagnosis of GI\nHelicobacter pylori infection, and interest\nin and availability for study participation.\nThe exclusion criteria were refusal to par-\nticipate in the study, use of insulin, diagnosis\nof thyroid or hepatic disease, candidacy for\nanother BS procedure, antibiotic use in the\nmonth preceding faecal material collection,\nprobiotic and/or prebiotic use, dementia and\nother cognitive and behavioural problems,\nand current or recent participation in\nanother interventional study protocol.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom each patient prior to participation in\nthe trial.\nPrimary and secondary endpoints\nThe primary endpoints of the SURMetaGIT\nstudy are potential changes in the expression\nof GI genes that may affect glucose\nhomeostasis and contribute to the short-\nterm remission of T2DM observed following\nRYGB. To determine whether such changes\noccur, the protocol involves assessment of the\ntranscriptomic profiles of GI biopsy speci-\nmens before and at 3 and 24 months after\nRYGB to test their correlations with the\nfollowing systemic and local data obtained at\nthe same time points: a) systemic (plasma or\nserum) biochemical and hormonal markers\nof glucose homeostasis, b) plasma proteomic\nprofiles, c) plasma lipidomic profiles, d)\nplasma and 24-h urine metabolomic profiles,\ne) faecal microbiota profiles, and f) faecal\nwater profiles.\nThe study was designed to examine several\nhypothesis-generating secondary endpoints\nrelated to the improvement or worsening of\nobesity-associated metabolic comorbidities\nother than T2DM in the short term and\nT2DM recurrence in the long term. For\ninstance, obesity is associated with nutri-\ntional deficiencies and changes in body com-\nposition that may affect health and can be\nWe thus planned to examine potential\nFigure 1.

All patients underwent standardized\nRYGB without silicon rings and with bilio-\n\u00ad 120 cm) limbs. RYGB reduces the stomach\nvolume by creating a proximal gastric pouch\nwith a capacity of approximately 30 mL,\nexcluding the rest of the stomach, duode-\nnum, and proximal jejunum from the flow of\nnutrients. After RYGB, about 95% of\ningested food bypasses the stomach, the\nentire duodenum, and a short portion of\nthe jejunum (Figure 2).\nDouble-balloon enteroscopy for GI biopsies.\nDouble-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) was per-\nformed at the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\nUnit of HC-FMUSP about 1 week before\nand 3 and 24 months after RYGB. Before\nDBE, the patients fasted for 12h and\nabstained from diabetes medication for 3\nto 5 days. Briefly, each patient was placed in\nthe left lateral position under deep sedation,\nachieved with 1 mg/kg of fentanyl (Fentanest;\nCrista\n\u00b4 lia, Sa\n~ o Paulo, Brazil), 5 min before\nanaesthetic induction. For anaesthesia, we\napplied our institution's standardized proto-\ncol for severely obese individuals as follows:\ndexmedetomidine (Precedex; Hospira, Lake\nFigure 2.

The safety of the\nenteroscopic procedure was monitored con-\ntinuously by electrocardiography, pulse\noximetry, and blood pressure assessment.\nAfter establishment of anaesthesia, the\nJapan) was inserted orally and advanced\nthrough the GI tract (including the excluded\nstomach in the postoperative period), with\nsystematic pleating of the small bowel on the\nenteroscope.20 A flexible hose and two bal-\nand deflated sequentially, allowing the\ninstrument to progress through the small\nintestine with simultaneous visualization.\nThese actions limited intestinal stretch and\nimproved transmission of the manoeuvres to\nposition and stabilize the end of the entero-\nscope. GI mucosal biopsy specimens\n(approximately 15 \u00ad 20mg each of the stom-\nach cardia, stomach fundus, duodenum,\njejunum, and ileum) were then collected and\nstored immediately in liquid nitrogen and\nthen at \u00c080C. The GI biopsy sites were\nmarked preoperatively with India ink (Spot;\nGI Supply, Camp Hill, PA, USA), allowing\nsample collection from the same sites in the\npostoperative period.\nPrimary endpoint analyses. GI transcriptomics.\nFor transcriptomic analysis, total RNA was\nextracted from approximately 15 to 20 mg of\ntissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according\nto the manufacturer's instructions. RNA\nconcentrations were measured with a spec-\nTechnologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), and\nquality was assessed with the RNA integrity\nnumber using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer\nsystem (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,\nCA, USA). For each sample, 300 mg of total\nRNA was used for microarray analyses\nconducted with the GeneChip 1.0 ST\nArray for Humans (Affymetrix, Santa\nClara, CA, USA). Sample preparation, pro-\ncessing, and hybridization were conducted\naccording to the instructions provided in the\nGeneChip expression analysis technical\nmanual. Array quality was checked using\nboxplots, correlation analysis, and principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA). Expression\nvalues were obtained using the robust multi-\narray average data pre-processing method.21\nThe combat method (http://jlab.byu.edu/\nComBat/Abstract.html) was used to remove\nbatch effects.22 The significance of micro-\narrays23 and rank products24 methods were\nanalysed to select differentially expressed\ngenes using the criterion of P < 0.05 (cor-\nrected for the false discovery rate).25 All\nanalytical tools are available in the R\nBioconductor program (http://www.biocon-\nductor.org/). Real-time reverse-transcription\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction was\nperformed to validate the significance of\nchanges in some genes of interest identified\nby microarray analysis using TaqMan gene\nexpression assays (Life Technologies,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA).\nBiochemical and hormonal markers of\nglucose homeostasis. The concentrations of\nglucose, insulin, glucagon, and C-peptide;\nlipid profiles (low-density lipoprotein chol-\nesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nand triglycerides); and concentrations of GI\nhormones (glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-\ndependent insulinotrophic peptide, peptide\nYY, and ghrelin) were measured in plasma or\nserum samples collected several weeks before\nafter RYGB; and at 1 and 2 years after\nRYGB. The glycated haemoglobin concen-\ntration was also measured before, 3 months\nand at 1 and 2 years after RYGB. All blood\nsamples were collected after 12-h fasts, and\nliquid formula diet (Ensure; Abbott, Abbott\nPark, IL, USA). The glucose, glycated\nhaemoglobin, insulin, and C-peptide concen-\ntrations and lipid profiles were analysed at\nthe Clinical Laboratory of HC-FMUSP\nusing enzymatic methods (glucose and lipid\nprofiles), liquid chromatography (LC) (gly-\ncated haemoglobin), and electrochemilumi-\nnescence (insulin and C-peptide). GI\nhormones were analysed using the multiplex\ntechnique (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA,\nUSA). At the time of initial blood collection,\nadditional samples were collected to obtain\nplasma (EDTA tubes, centrifugation at\nproteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic ana-\nlyses. For GI hormone and proteomic assess-\nments, plasma samples were treated with a\nprotease inhibitor (Complete Mini; Roche,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA).\nPlasma proteomics and lipidomics. We\nplanned to correlate the activity of differen-\ntially expressed GI genes with plasma prote-\nomic and lipidomic data obtained by mass\nspectrometry (MS) at the systemic level.\nGlobal plasma lipid profiles were assessed\n(shotgun lipidomics) before and after\nRYGB by matrix-assisted laser desorption/\nionization MS. Shotgun proteomic analyses\nwere performed for protein profiling using\nnano-scale LC tandem MS (LC-MS/MS), a\nwell-established technique for peptide iden-\ntification from complex mixtures (i.e., pro-\ntein digests). We planned to further validate\nthe identification of proteins of interest by\nshotgun analysis using MS, with a targeted\napproach when necessary.26\nPlasma and urine metabolomics. Plasma\nobtained from EDTA-treated blood samples\nwas aliquoted in polypropylene microtubes\nand stored at \u00c080C until metabolomic\nanalysis. Next, 24-h urine samples were\ncollected in appropriate containers, the\nsupernatants were removed (15 min of cen-\ning samples were aliquoted in polypropylene\nmicrotubes and stored at \u00c080C until meta-\nbolomic analysis. We planned to assess the\nplasma and urine metabolomic profiles\nusing global (to describe a large number of\nmetabolites) and targeted approaches,\nenabling the collection of qualitative and\nquantitative data. The following analyses\nwere also planned: global metabolomic ana-\nlysis, performed as described previously27,28;\ntargeted metabolomic analysis, described in\nhtml); metabolite quantification, performed\nusing a reference and appropriate internal\nstandards; and metabolite panels compris-\nproteinogenic amino acids, ornithine, and\ncitrulline; 19 biogenic amines; sum of hex-\noses; 76 phosphatidylcholines; 14 lyso-phos-\nphatidylcholines; and 15 sphingomyelins).\nThe web-based analytical pipeline Metabo\nAnalyst 2.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca) and\nthe ROC Curve Explorer & Tester (http://\nwww.roccet.ca/ROCCET/) were used for\ndata upload and importation, respectively.\nThe MetaboAnalyst protocol was used to\nnormalize data for univariate and multivari-\nMetagenomics. The patients performed self-\ncollection of faecal samples at home using a\nspecimen collection system (Fisherbrand\nCommode Specimen Collection System;\nFisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), as\ndescribed previously.17 The samples were\nfrozen immediately at \u00c020C and trans-\nported to our laboratory by a motorcycle\ncourier service specializing in the transport\nof biological samples under temperature\ncontrol. At the laboratory, the faecal sam-\nples were aliquoted immediately (without\nthawing) and stored at \u00c080C until DNA\nextraction and storage at \u00c020C, as\ndescribed previously30 and as detailed in\nInternational Microbiome Standard IHMS-\nSOP06 (http://www.microbiome-standards.\norg). Library preparation for the MiSeq\nSequencing System (Illumina, San Diego,\nCA, USA) involved amplification of the V3\n\u00ad V4 region of 16 S ribosomal DNA genes,\nas described previously.17,31 Amplification\nrelied on MolTaq 16 S and the correspond-\ning master mix. The polymerase chain reac-\ntion mix contained 10 ng of DNA, 1 mL of\nand reverse primer (20 mM), and 0.5 mL of\nTaq in a total volume of 50 mL. The program\nfor 60 s, and final extension at 72C for\n10 min. Sequencing was performed using\nMiSeq technology and the Genopole\nToulouse Midi-Pyrenees genomics platform\n(http://get.genotoul.fr/). The resulting\nsequences were assigned to taxonomic\nlevels ranging from phylum to genus using\nthe Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.\ncme.msu.edu/). To identify metagenomic\nchanges after RYGB, we planned to further\ncluster these sequences into operational\ntaxonomic units or phylotypes at 97%\nidentity using QIIME software32 and the\nMetabolomics of faecal water. In micro-\ntubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany),\nwater were homogenized at 25C for 5 min\n10min. The supernatants of faecal water\nwere aliquoted (1mL) and stored at \u00c080C.\nEventual residues were further extracted with\nice-cold methanol following the same first-\nstep extraction procedure. Analysis of faecal\nwater metabolites was performed using LC-\nTOF; Agilent Technologies) with subsequent\nmetabolite confirmation by LC-MS/MS.\nChromatographic separation was performed\nSpectra were accumulated and processed\nusing mass hunter qualitative analysis. To\nassess faecal metabolomic changes, we chose\nto perform PCA (3:11 Pirouette software;\nInfometrix, Bothell, WA, USA) with data\nfrom a database matrix based on the relative\nintensity of ions (m/z values) in the profiles\nobtained by LC-MS using Lab Solutions\nsoftware (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and\nExcel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).34\nOther discriminant techniques available for\nthe analysis of metabolomic datasets, includ-\ning partial least-squares discriminant analysis\n35 and orthogonal partial least-squares dis-\ncriminant analysis36, may be used.\nSecondary endpoint analyses. Nutritional\nintake. Nutritional intake was assessed sev-\nRYGB. Two trained dietitian oriented the\npatients as described previously.37 The types\nand amounts of food and beverages con-\nsumed were assessed using three nutritional\ntools: 24-h food records, 7-day food records,\nand food frequency questionnaires. The\namount of food consumed was recorded\nin terms of cooking units (e.g., table-\nspoons, cups) as guided by the Consumo\nAlimentar: Visualizando Porc\n\u00b8o~es (Food\nConsumption Book: Viewing Portions).38\nData were used to calculate total calories\nand macronutrient and micronutrient\nconsumption with Virtual Nutri Plus soft-\nware (www.virtualnutriplus.com.br).39 The\nfollowing data sources were chosen to\ndetermine the food nutritional composition:\nthe food chemical composition table devel-\noped by Philippi40 and the Brazilian food\nchemical composition table.41 We planned\nto analyse pre- and postoperative nutritional\nconsumption using recommendations for\ndaily nutrient intake from the dietary refer-\nence intakes of the Food and Nutrition\nBoard, Institute of Medicine,42 as a\nreference.\nAnthropometric measurements. Anthro\npometric measurements were performed\npreoperatively, every 15 days for 3 months,\nand 1 and 2 years after RYGB. Body weight\nwas measured using an electronic platform\nscale with the patient standing in the centre\nof the scale platform while barefoot and\nwearing only light clothes. Height (cm) was\nmeasured using a stadiometer (Sanny;\nAmerican Medical do Brasil, Sa\n~ o Paulo,\nBrazil) with the patient standing barefoot,\nheels together, spine erect, and arms\nextended next to the body. The body mass\nindex (weight/height2) was also calculated.43\nThe circumferences of the waist (narrowest\ndiameter between the xiphoid process and\niliac crest or near the umbilical region) and\nhip (widest diameter over the greater tro-\nchanters) were measured by adjusting a tape\nin the horizontal plane, and the waist-to-hip\nBody composition. Body composition was\nassessed by bioelectric impedance analysis\n(QuadScan4000; Bodystat, Douglas, Isle of\nMan, British Isles) and air-displacement\nplethysmography (ADP) (BOD POD BC\nsystem device; Life Measurement\nInstruments, Concord, CA, USA) in the\nafter RYGB. The tetrapolar body bioelec-\ntric impedance analysis equipment gener-\n200 kHz with a calibrated signal applied to\nthe skin via adhesive electrodes placed on\nthe right-side limbs. Resistance and react-\nance were used to calculate the total body\nwater, fat mass, and fat-free mass.46,47 For\nADP, Boyle's law (P1.V1 \u00bc P2.V2, where P\nis pressure and V is volume) was used to\ndetermine body volume and to calculate\nbody fat and fat-free mass by applying\ndensitometry principles (d \u00bc m/v) and using\nwhere BF is body fat and D is density.\nAll ADP measurements and calculations\nwere performed automatically by the sys-\ntem's software, based on air volume and\npressure variations inside the equipment\nchamber when empty and when occupied\nations, the patients wore only underwear\nand a cap to keep the hair contained and\nremained in a seated position inside the\nchamber. The patients removed metallic\nobjects such as earrings, rings, chains, and\npiercings for both assessments performed to\nestimate body composition.\nIndirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry\nwas used to estimate the resting energy\nexpenditure (REE) preoperatively and at 3\nmonths and 1 and 2 years after RYGB. The\npatients were assessed after a 12-h overnight\nfast and were instructed to refrain from any\nunusual physical activity in the 24-h period\nbefore REE measurement. After the patients\nhad rested for 30 min in a recumbent pos-\nition, their oxygen consumption and carbon\ndioxide production were measured continu-\nally for 35 min using a ventilated hood and\nopen circuit under a canopy (Deltatrac\nMonitor II MBM-200; Datex-Engstrom\nDivision, Instruments Corp., Helsinki,\nFinland), as described previously.48 The\nREE was calculated without using urinary\nurea nitrogen, according to the Weir equa-\ntion.49 Before each REE measurement, the\nmonitor was calibrated using mixed refer-\nence gases of known composition.\nPostoperative follow-up: other clinical\nmeasurements. Outpatient follow-up was per-\nformed immediately postoperatively, every 2\nafter RYGB. Data on medication use, blood\npressure, and heart rate were obtained.\nSURMetaGIT study data were obtained\nduring 24 scheduled medical visits. The pro-\ncedures are detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3.\nStatistical analysis\nSample size calculation. A sample of 20 par-\nticipants was considered to be adequate for\nTable 1.

This sample was\ndetermined to provide 80% power for the\ndetection of other general systemic effects of\nRYGB using parametric (one-way analysis\nof variance) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test) approaches, with an esti-\nmated alpha value of 0.05. The effect size\nwas calculated under the assumption that GI\nhormone variation would be twice as great\nin the postoperative than the preoperative\nperiod.\nData analysis. The challenge faced in our\nmulti-omics analyses was the integration of\nall data while dealing with the restrictions of\na small sample. The statistical methods used\nto analyse multi-omics data consist of high-\nthroughput data-generation platforms that\ndemand high computational performance,\nincluding machine learning.50 Before inte-\ngration, we planned pre-processing of each\nomics dataset by procedures such as nor-\nmalization or scaling, missing value imput-\nation, variable selection, and dimension\nFor microarray gene expression analysis,\nwe planned to primarily use the software\nIngenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen,\nRedwood City, CA, USA). This tool per-\nforms a functional analysis (in silico), result-\ning in networks of gene interactions.52\nFor ``omics'' integrated analysis, we\nplanned to perform initial exploratory data\nanalyses.

We also considered the appli-\ncation of approaches that allow the visual-\nization of different omics data types on\npathway maps; the use of classification\ntrees to identify variables predicting the\nexpression of associated genes53; and the\napplication of other advanced statistical\nmethodologies that have been used in\nmulti-omics analysis, such as the construc-\ntion of artificial or Bayesian neural net-\nworks54 and the application of dynamic\ncontrol system theory. These approaches\nwould allow for the creation of a global\nnetwork of pathway interactions from gen-\netic, proteomic, and metabolomic data.\nAdditional statistical analysis of each study\nvariable and its temporal relationship, as well\nas analyses integrating all omics data, were\nalso planned. The R statistical software\n(http://www.r-project.org), including the R\nBioconductor repository, was chosen to con-\nduct the statistical tests. For integrative ana-\nlyses of diverse omics data, we planned to use\nGalaxy (https://usegalaxy.org) and STATegra\n(http://www.stategra.eu) software.\nResults\nInitial results\nThe first 20 obese patients selected for omics\nanalysis were included in this study (demo-\ngraphic data are provided in Table 2); the 5\npatients to be used for validation remain\nunder selection. The 20 initial patients com-\npleted all GI tissue, blood, urine, and faecal\nsample collections. In addition, all omics (GI\ngene expression, plasma protein, plasma\nmetabolite, plasma lipid, faecal metage-\nnomic, and faecal metabolite), nutritional,\nanthropometric, body composition, and\nREE data were obtained preoperatively and\n3 months postoperatively, and statistical\nanalyses are underway. Urinary metabolites\nremain to be assessed, and data from 24\nmonths after RYGB are under collection.\nThe protocol steps completed and those in\nthe process of completion for these 20\npatients are shown in Figure 1.\nDiscussion\nIdeally, research questions should be sim-\nple and involve only a few key variables.\nHowever, the multifactorial nature of some\ncontemporary diseases has hindered the\nachievement of this premise. Modern\nresearchers increasingly face the need to\ndevelop studies involving a wide range of\nvariables to answer simple questions.\nAiming to contribute to the resolution\nof this issue, our article describes the proto-\ncol for a pan-omics clinical study of\nobese patients, a useful research approach\nthat is rarely applied because of its great\ncomplexity.\nObesity is a multifactorial disease that\ninvolves several metabolic disturbances and\nchronic inflammation associated with the\ndevelopment of a wide range of comorbid-\nities. A major challenge of our study was to\ncorrelate a large number of GI findings with\nseveral systemic datasets to answer the main\nquestion of whether potential RYGB-\ninduced changes in GI genes affect T2DM\nremission and long-term T2DM recurrence.\nA specific statistical approach was designed\nto overcome this obstacle.\nTable 2. Descriptive data for obese female\npatients (n \u00bc 20) obtained before and 3 months\nafter surgery.\nVariable Preoperative Postoperative\nData are presented as mean \u00c6 SD.\nOur statistical design aimed to enable\ncorrelation of a large number of variables\nin relation to single clinical outcomes.\nFor this purpose, all analyses were initiated\nindividually, considering each variable and\nits relationship to the study time points;\nsignificant findings will then be integrated\nto examine potential interrelationships\namong variables. This statistical integration\nwill be conducted after concluding data\ncollection and analysis for the time point\nof 2 years after RYGB. During application\nof the statistical integration, small adjust-\nments in the statistical design will likely\nbe necessary.\nChallenges and limitations of our proto-\ncol encountered to date have been related to\nthe acquisition of GI biopsy specimens.\nThe development of invasive procedures\nfor use in humans is a main challenge of\ntranslational clinical hypothesis testing.\nThe local ethics committee was initially\nreluctant to approve the collection of GI\nbiopsy specimens from patients for this\nstudy. Our Digestive Endoscopy Unit is a\nworld reference centre at the forefront of\nDBE development that enabled us to\nobtain approval after intense discussions\nand under the condition of properly advising\npatients that biopsy specimen collection was\nspecific to the study protocol, and not part of\nstandard care, on the informed consent form.\nThe DBE technique has been well toler-\nated by patients in most studies, and biopsy\nspecimen collection during such a procedure\nis quite safe. Practitioners from a German\ncentre reported a <1% complication rate\namong a total of 3894 DBE interventions,\nincluding those performed in patients with\nmild to moderate acute pancreatitis\nsmall bowel bleeding (0.15%), the latter two\nof which were related mainly to polypect-\nomy.55 In our centre, no major complica-\ntions have been reported for 364 DBE\nprocedures, 112 of which included biopsy\nThe amount of GI tissue obtained from\nthe pre- and postoperative biopsies in this\nstudy was sufficient for gene expression\nanalysis for all enrolled patients. However,\nthe excluded stomach portion was inaccess-\nible for postoperative biopsy sample collec-\ntion in some patients because of stenosis in\nthe biliopancreatic limb (n \u00bc 3) and the\ndifficulty of reaching this portion of the GI\ntract (n \u00bc 10). The excluded stomach may be\nin a ``fallen'' position because of an excess of\ngastric fluid in this region secondary to\nduodenal bile reflux, which hinders passage\nof the enteroscope.\nOur strict patient selection criteria and\nrequirement for consent to the performance\nof additional invasive procedures signifi-\ncantly hindered patient recruitment. In add-\nition, to ensure the safety of the DBE\nintervention, the number of biopsy specimens\ncollected was limited. We are still seeking to\noptimize our methods to achieve minimum\ntissue use during GI genetic analysis, but this\nlimitation will probably prevent us from\nperforming intestinal proteomic and meta-\nbolomic analyses, which could improve the\ninterpretation of potential RYGB-induced\nchanges in intestinal function.\nOne relevant point to be observed in\nconducting clinical studies is the potential\nscientific contribution and clinical applica-\ntion. BS has positive effects on obesity-\nrelated comorbidities and is associated with\ndecreased mortality in obese patients.4\nAlthough currently recognized as the most\neffective available treatment for obese\npatients, this procedure is invasive and has\npotential for complications. Due to the\nmarked burden of obesity and related comor-\nbidities on many patients worldwide, new\nand effective noninvasive treatments are\nurgently needed.\nThe performance of BS, especially tech-\nniques involving malabsorptive procedures,\nhave an enigmatic metabolic effect that\nmanifests primarily as T2DM remission\nalmost immediately postoperatively. Among\nthe several hypotheses proposed to explain\nthis phenomenon, the effect of reduced post-\noperative food intake is the only proposed\ntheory that does not involve bowel-induced\nmetabolic factors. This hypothesis suggests\nthat deprivation of oral ingestion in the\nimmediate postoperative period minimally\nchallenges pancreatic b cells, but the hypoth-\nesis is weakened when we consider that food\ndeprivation occurs regardless of the surgical\ntechnique applied and that postoperative\nglycaemic control is minimal after strictly\nrestrictive procedures.57\nThe other proposed hypotheses (which\nimplicate intestinal gluconeogenesis, the\nhindgut, and the foregut) involve the poten-\ntial participation of intestinal products in\nT2DM remission, mainly by correcting the\nimbalanced release of anti-diabetogenic sig-\nnals (incretins and other insulinotrophic\nhormones) and diabetogenic signals (incom-\npletely understood anti-incretin factors) that\nare apparently involved in its pathophysi-\nology.58,59 Taken together, these hypotheses\nstrongly suggest that the GI tract actively\nparticipates in the metabolic effects of some\nBS procedures on glucose homeostasis; to\ndate, however, these hypotheses are sup-\nported only by experimental data. The\nSURMetaGIT study was designed to con-\ntribute to this issue by providing clinical\nevidence explaining the molecular mechan-\nisms involved in T2DM remission after\nRYGB, with consideration of the human\ngut as the major driver of these processes.\nIn addition to their benefits in terms\nof T2DM remission, RYGB-induced meta-\nbolic changes may contribute to the\nimprovement or worsening of other obe-\nsity-related comorbidities involving meta-\nbolic factors. For instance, preoperative\nbone metabolism dysfunction and osteope-\nnia are common in obese individuals and are\nassociated in part with vitamin D deficiency.\nIn the postoperative period, these bone\ndisturbances may be accentuated and corre-\nlated partially with weight loss, even when\nvitamin D deficiency is reduced by supple-\nmentation and other bone health markers\nhave improved.60 In this context, although\nthe SURMetaGIT study focuses on T2DM\nremission, its complex design may provide\nunpredictable additional answers concern-\ning the remission or enhancement of other\nobesity-related conditions, such as meta-\nbolic syndrome, changes in cognitive func-\ntion, and bone metabolic disorders.\nIn conclusion, application of our proto-\ncol allowed us to collect essential data that\nwill contribute to the understanding of\nmolecular mechanisms involved in the\nremission of T2DM and other obesity-\nrelated comorbidities. These data may also\nguide the design of new noninvasive treat-\nment approaches for obesity-related meta-\nbolic disorders, particularly T2DM. The\npotential scientific contributions of the\nSURMetaGIT study are promising, and\ntheir successful manifestation will require\nproper statistical analysis of the data gener-\nated and the application of knowledge for\nlarger-scale interpretation. Our partial\nresults demonstrate the applicability of our\nprotocol by showing reliable patient adher-\nence and data collection over time. Effects\ndata are not presented here because they are\nbeyond the scope of this article, which only\ndescribes our protocol. Confirmation of\nT2DM remission (using the primary end-\npoints) at least 1 year after RYGB and the\nstatistical integration of data after the 2-year\nfollow-up will likely generate several articles\nthat better detail our findings.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nFundac\n\u00b8 a\n~ o de Amparo a\n` Pesquisa do Estado de\nSa\n~ o Paulo (FAPESP).\nReferences\n1.
