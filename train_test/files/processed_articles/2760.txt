Although originally uncompromising--almost anyone with a\ncriminal record could be denied employment--court rulings and policy changes have\nforced criminal background checks to become more nuanced. One motivation for al-\nlowing more individuals with criminal records to work is to decrease recidivism and\nencourage desistance. In this article, we estimate the causal impact of receiving a clear-\nance to work on subsequent arrests for individuals with criminal records who have\nbeen provisionally hired to work in certain nonlicensed health-care jobs in New York\nState (N = 6,648). We employ an instrumental variable approach based on a substan-\ntive understanding of the state-mandated criminal background check process. We ex-\namine age-graded effects within this group of motivated individuals and differential ef-\nfects by sex in the rapidly growing health-care industry, which is typically dominated by\nwomen. Our estimated local average treatment effect indicates a 2.2-percentage-point\ndecrease in the likelihood of a subsequent arrest in 1 year and a 4.2-percentage-point\ndecrease over 3 years. We find meaningful variations by sex; men are 8.4 percentage\npoints less likely to be arrested over the 3-year period when cleared compared with a\n2.4-percentage-point (and nonsignificant) effect for women. Older women in particular\nare driving the nonsignificant results for women.\n Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online\nDirect all correspondence to Megan Denver, School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany,\nmdenver@albany.edu).\nThe authors are extremely grateful to our New York State partners who made this project possible.\nWe would like to thank Terry Salo and Leslie Kellam and their team at the Division of Criminal\nJustice Services; Daryl Barra and his team at the Department of Health; and the research staff at\nthe Department of Labor for their encouragement, access to data, and complete support.

These changes have\noccurred in part because of developments in technology--primarily the Internet--\nand perceptions of increased risk arising from events like 9/11 (Bushway et al., 2007;\nSEARCH, 2005). One major source of criminal background information is official crim-\ninal record repositories. Originally created for criminal justice purposes by states us-\ning fingerprint cards, the volume of fingerprint-based background checks for noncrim-\ntrict of Columbia (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2008, 2015). During the same period,\nthe volume of fingerprint-based checks for criminal justice purposes declined 6 percent\nmost of the 24 million fingerprint-based criminal background checks conducted by staff at\nrepositories were for noncriminal-justice purposes. The practitioners at these repositories\nprocessed an additional 19.4 million name-based criminal background checks in 2014 for\nnoncriminal-justice purposes.\nAlthough these numbers are large, they are undoubtedly dwarfed by the biggest source\nof criminal background checks for employers: consumer reporting agencies. Consumer\nreporting agencies are private commercial vendors whose staff members conduct name-\nbased searches using information collected from court records and other publicly avail-\nable data sources (Jacobs, 2015: 75). For example, the commercial vendor LexisNexis\n(n.d.) reported maintaining a national database spanning all 50 U.S. states and containing\nmore than 250 million criminal records for more than 100 million individuals. Although\nthere are not clear national estimates on how many employers conduct criminal back-\nground checks using these sources, the existing evidence indicates that these searches are\ncommon, particularly for large companies (Bushway et al., 2007; EEOC, 2012; Holzer,\nThe use of these records for employment decisions, regardless of the source of criminal\nhistory record information, is governed by state laws and federal court rulings about po-\ntential disparate impact under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (King and Fliegel,\n2011). In the seminal Green v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (1977) case, a federal\ncourt of appeals banned employers from implementing \"blanket bans\" or from using an\napplicant's conviction record as an absolute bar to employment. Instead, employers were\nencouraged to clear individuals with records to work unless there was a business necessity\nto deny the applicant (EEOC, 1987). Despite this guidance, blanket bans remain com-\nmon, particularly in the context of occupational licenses. More than a quarter of the U.S.\nworkforce was covered by license requirements in 2008, which was a dramatic increase\nof Columbia currently allow a blanket ban denial approach for individuals with criminal\nconvictions in the licensure process (White House, 2015).\nThe results of recent social science research have not supported the idea of blanket\nbans; instead they have supported the idea that individuals with criminal records can be\n(DOH).

Based in part on this research, the federal Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC, 2012) further revised its guidance to encourage the\npractice of individualized assessments, which include the consideration of mitigating in-\nformation that might assuage concerns raised by the criminal record. The EEOC has also\nfiled several high-profile lawsuits against large employers over their use of criminal back-\nground checks (Fliegel, Hartstein, and Mora, 2013). At the same time, the \"Ban the Box\"\nmovement has been spreading across the nation, moving criminal background inquiries\nto later stages in the hiring process with the goal of increasing employment for those with\ncriminal history records (Smith, 2014) and there is evidence that the move to more for-\nmal, regulated criminal background checks has led employers to clear more people with\ncriminal records than they might have previously (Hartstein et al., 2012; Lageson, Vuolo,\nFurthermore, policy makers are actively pushing for increased hiring of such individu-\nAttorney General Eric Holder wrote a letter to all state attorneys general requesting a\nreview of state laws that impose restrictions on individuals with criminal records, with the\ngoal of eliminating restrictions that are unnecessary for public safety. Part of his argument\nwas that \"research reveals that gainful employment and stable housing are key factors\nthat enable people with criminal convictions to avoid future arrests and incarcerations\"\n(Holder, 2011, para. 5). The argument is straightforward: Increasing the rate at which in-\ndividuals with criminal records are cleared to work can both increase employment and\ndecrease crime.\nEven though it is clearly plausible in theory (Bushway and Reuter, 2001; Fagan and\nFreeman, 1999; Laub and Sampson, 2001), the argument that a criminal background check\nclearance will decrease crime has never been validated empirically. Moreover, the con-\nnection between work and crime for individuals with criminal records has been tested\nalmost exclusively on men. Although men are overrepresented in the criminal justice\nsystem, criminal background checks are increasingly relevant for women as well. Brame\net al.'s (2014) estimate that approximately 15\u00ad20 percent of women experience at least\none nontraffic arrest by 23 years of age only seems small when considering that the male\narrest rate is approximately two times larger.\nJust as importantly, many industries that are most likely to conduct criminal back-\nground checks, like health care, child care, and education, are dominated by women, par-\nticularly for entry-level positions (Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll, 2006; National Women's\nagencies to conduct criminal background checks for home health-care aides (Office of\n(Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, 2014). The relevance of this issue will only grow:\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015) anticipates that health-care support positions will\nexperience the largest growth in low-wage jobs in the next decade and that the female\ncivilian labor force is projected to increase by 9 percent (more than 6.4 million individ-\ncreasingly affected by criminal background checks.\nAlthough women have lower recidivism rates when compared with those of men\n(Durose, Cooper, and Snyder, 2014; Gendreau, Little, and Goggin, 1996; Langan and\nLevin, 2002), and may have a different relationship with work, both normatively and eco-\nnomically (Urahn et al., 2014), there is some evidence that women with criminal records\nmay be more affected than men with criminal records. For example, men with incarcera-\ntion histories tend to secure jobs at higher rates than women with incarceration histories\n(La Vigne, Brooks, and Lloyd, 2009), and an incarceration record does not seem to influ-\nence employers' responses for men nearly as much as for women when submitting online\njob applications for entry-level job positions (Decker et al., 2014). This presents a dual\ndisadvantage--not only might women work in industries that are more likely to conduct\ncriminal background checks, but women with criminal records might also be viewed more\nnegatively than men with criminal records.\nThis article strives to provide insight into the overall question of how a criminal back-\nground check affects subsequent criminal justice involvement for individuals with records.\nAs this is fundamentally the study of a policy-based criminal background check, any\nstudy of this question must include information about individuals who are being reviewed\nas part of a particular background check process. In the absence of an experiment, re-\nsearchers can generate inferences by substantively modeling the criminal background\ncheck in practice to identify exogenous variation in the outcomes associated with the\ncheck.\nIn much of Europe, criminal background checks are decided by the centralized govern-\nment repository in response to a request from the employee (Jacobs and Larrauri, 2015).\nAs a result, a study in Europe might be possible at the national level. In the United States,\nhowever, criminal background checks are much more fragmented, and they are usually\nconducted by an employer or state agency responsible for a particular job sector, such\nas teachers or hospital employees. As a result, we focus on a criminal background check\nconducted by one state agency in New York for a set of direct-care, nonlicensed jobs for\ntwo large industries in the state--licensed nursing homes and home health-care agencies.\nOur sample includes the population of individuals in 2008 and 2009 with formal criminal\nhistory records (as recorded in the official state and federal repositories) who have ap-\nplied for and been provisionally hired to work in such jobs, conditional on passing the\nstate-mandated criminal background check. Because we can model the decision, we can\nprovide the first causal estimate of the impact of the criminal background check outcome\non individuals with records.\nNevertheless, the necessary focus on a particular state, industry, and type of individual\nwith a criminal record (i.e., those actively seeking legitimate employment and provision-\nally qualified for the position) also means that our results have limited generalizability.\nThis limitation is shared by other research in this area. For example, researchers who\nhave conducted audit studies on the negative impact of having a criminal record have fo-\ncused on specific local labor markets, including Milwaukee (Pager, 2003), New York City\n(Pager, Western, and Bonikoswki, 2009), and Minneapolis (Uggen et al., 2014). Likewise,\nthe aims of recent experimental evaluations of transitional job programs for individu-\nals exiting prisons have also been limited to tests for individuals in one type of transi-\ntional job in a particular labor market (Bushway and Apel, 2012; Visher, Winterfield, and\nGiven that this is the first study to evaluate the impact of the outcome of a criminal\nbackground check on subsequent recidivism, we believe the trade-off between internal\nvalidity and external validity is warranted. Examining a standardized criminal background\ncheck process provides a unique methodological opportunity where we can identify the\ndifferent factors that determine the background check decision. Furthermore, New York\nState is an excellent laboratory for this analysis because the state's legal context antici-\npated the developing national situation. New York is one of the few states to formally\nprevent blanket bans (King and Fliegel, 2011; NY Correction Law Article 23-A) and to\nrequire the consideration of rehabilitation and good conduct information. In doing so, the\nlaw explicitly recognizes the need to balance public safety concerns about hiring people\nwith demonstrated risk with the potential benefits of encouraging the licensure and em-\nployment of people with prior conviction records (NY Correction Law Article 23-A). As\na result, an analysis examining transparent decision processes followed by a large state\nagency should be particularly informative for policy makers trying to understand the con-\nsequences of criminal background checks. Furthermore, because the sample derives from\na job setting with mostly women, the article is uniquely situated to look separately at\nthe impact of employment opportunities on recidivism for women and men with criminal\nhistory records.\nIn addition to providing new insight about the consequences of criminal background\nchecks, this article also contributes to the criminological literature on the relationship\nbetween employment and recidivism. In research that has examined employment and\nrecidivism, most studies have focused on men recently released from prison (Apel and\ntached from the labor market, a fact that might account for the largely null relationship\nbetween employment programs and subsequent recidivism for this population. By exam-\nining criminal background checks, we can test the employment\u00adrecidivism relationship\nin a sample of individuals who are, by definition, attached to the labor market. Finally,\nthe article also provides an opportunity to test the life-course idea that the impact of life\nevents, like work opportunities, are age-graded (Elder, 1975; Laub and Sampson, 1993;\nUggen, 2000). Because the sample consists of individuals who are all in the labor market,\nwe can distinguish the concept of age from more general concepts like motivation or job\nreadiness.\nThe article proceeds by discussing the literature on work and recidivism, with a particu-\nlar focus on potential age-graded effects and variations by sex. The following two sections\ndescribe the data and our empirical strategy. We implement an instrumental variable ap-\nproach based on substantive knowledge of the two-stage criminal background check pro-\ncess in our study context. Specifically, after the initial criminal background check decision\noccurs, everyone who receives a proposed denial has the opportunity to contest the deci-\nsion by providing some additional information, and the decision-makers then consider the\nadditional information (when applicable) before making a final determination. We esti-\nmate a relevant local average treatment effect (LATE) for the causal impact of a criminal\nbackground check decision on subsequent arrest over the shorter (1 year) and the longer\n(3 year) run, while attempting to explain the mechanism through which these effects play\nout. The article concludes with the results and a discussion of how the empirical evalua-\ntion of a criminal background check, which is interesting in its own right, sheds new light\non the complex theoretical relationship between work opportunities and recidivism.\nFrom an economic perspective, a legitimate source of income caused by a crimi-\nnal background check clearance to work might change the cost\u00adbenefit calculation of\ncrime for the rational decision maker (Becker, 1968). In addition, access to employment\ncould generate an important source of social control for individuals with criminal records\n(Laub and Sampson, 1993). Furthermore, a positive clearance decision could help erad-\nicate, rather than exacerbate, the \"stigma\" of a criminal record (Becker, 1963; Lemert,\nThis intuition has not been tested in the context of a criminal background check, but\nit has been tested extensively with research on the causal impact of employment and job\ntraining programs on recidivism for individuals involved in the criminal justice system.\nSurprisingly, rigorous evaluations of employment-based programs often find null effects\nWilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie, 2000). Part of the problem is that many employment\nprograms do not actually increase employment (Cook et al., 2015; Wilson, Gallagher, and\nMacKenzie, 2000). Theoretically, work programs should not reduce crime unless they\ncause meaningful improvements in employment and earnings (Bushway and Apel, 2012;\nNevertheless, even transitional jobs programs, which clearly and unambiguously in-\ncrease employment during the duration of the program, often do not reduce recidivism\net al., 2015; Zweig, Yahner, and Redcross, 2010). One possible explanation for this find-\ning is that employment programs may need to be targeted at the small subset of individ-\nuals who are ready for employment (Latessa, 2012). Perhaps individuals are only ready\nfor employment when other criminological needs have been met (Cook et al., 2015). This\nidea fits well with the growing consensus from the risk\u00adneeds\u00adresponsivity movement\nthat effective programming targets the right program for the right person at the right\ntime (Andrews, Bonta, and Wormith, 2006). Bushway and Reuter (2001) have also sug-\ngested that employment only \"works\" for individuals who are motivated. From this line of\nthought, programs that identify and employ individuals who are motivated to work might\nbe more likely to find a relationship between employment opportunities and crime than\nthe standard studies that use samples of individuals exiting prison.1\nAnother line of scholarship from the life-course tradition has produced results that\nsuggest that the key contextual factor is not motivation but age (Uggen, 2000). Uggen\nreevaluated Supported Work, an experimental subsidized work program conducted in\nthe 1970s that found no relationship between subsidized work and crime (Piliavin and\nGartner, 1981). After interacting the treatment with age, Uggen found that the Supported\nWork did lead to a negative, significant, and substantively meaningful reduction in recidi-\nvism for those individuals with criminal history records who were older than 26 years of\nage, which indicates that the impact of employment on crime is age-graded. As individuals\ntransition into adulthood and prepare to \"settle down\" and desist (Bachman et al., 2014;\nMassoglia and Uggen, 2010), obtaining legitimate work becomes relevant and meaningful.\nNinety-six percent of Americans believe working full time is \"at least somewhat impor-\ntant\" for claiming adult status (General Social Survey, 2002 as cited in Furstenberg et al.,\n1. Bushway and Reuter (2001) did not provide an operational definition of motivation, but they fo-\ncused on people who self-select into work or work training programs. In this article, we claim that\nindividuals who have obtained a job offer in the direct-care industry in either a nursing home or\nhome health-care agency are motivated to work.\nIt is not always possible to disentangle motivation or readiness from age. Older individ-\nuals may be more \"ready to desist\" (Paternoster and Bushway, 2009; Shover, 1996) and\ntherefore better able to take advantage of the job. But Uggen (2000) found that younger\nindividuals did not reduce their illegal earnings even while participating in the work pro-\ngram, suggesting that the work may not have been salient for these participants, who\ncould and did work. To date, there has been no test of whether the age-graded impact of\nwork is conceptually distinct from motivational or job readiness perspectives. In this arti-\ncle, we examine whether the impact of a background check clearance has an age-graded\nimpact on recidivism among a sample of motivated, job-ready individuals. Evidence that\nthe impact is age-graded in this sample would be solid evidence that age is more than just\nanother way to describe motivation or job readiness.\nUnlike age, sex has received scant attention in the discussion of work and crime.\nWomen form a small minority of individuals who participate in the criminal justice sys-\ntem. As a result, researchers do not usually conduct studies that differentiate the theo-\nretical justification for the role of employment between men and women, and only a few\nsamples have enough women to study them separately. Nevertheless, in our sample of in-\ndividuals provisionally hired to work in the health-care industry, women comprise more\nthan two thirds of the individuals with criminal records. Greater than 90 percent of home\nhealth aides in the United States\u00ad\u00adthe fifth fasting growing occupation in the county\u00ad\u00adare\nwomen (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015; Khatutsky et al., 2011). And although women\nhave less lifetime involvement than men in the criminal justice system, their rates of in-\nvolvement are still substantial (Brame et al., 2014). The current study provides a unique\nopportunity to examine the impact of employment on recidivism by sex in an employment\ncontext where a criminal background check is becoming a legal prerequisite for obtaining\na job.\nFew articles study differences in the way employment affects participation differently\nfor men and women. Nonetheless, it is clear that sex variations in criminal participation\ndo exist (Greenfeld and Snell, 1999; Reisig, Holtfreter, and Morash, 2006; Steffensmeier\nand Allan, 1996). One natural consequence is a debate about whether traditional risk\nassessment tools developed mostly on male samples apply to women (Reisig, Holtfreter,\nand Morash, 2006). For example, a traditional rational choice orientation might lead to\nthe conclusion that the financial incentives for committing a crime are higher for men\nthan for women because they are more likely to be the primary earners in the household\nVerbruggen, Blokland, and van der Geest (2012) discussed how the psychological ef-\nfects of being unemployed, including stigmatization, may also fall more heavily on men,\nwhereas women might have easier access to other social roles. Specifically, social factors\nlike marriage, raising children, and household tasks may better explain women's deci-\nsions to participate in illegal activities (Freeman, 1999). Within a marriage, for example,\none partner may be able to insure him- or herself against negative income shocks through\nthe spouse's earnings. Furthermore, the opportunity cost of committing a crime should\nincrease with the number of children because children increase the added disutility or\nharm from going to jail (Campaniello, 2014).\nNevertheless, there have been major increases in labor-force participation for women\nin recent decades, along with changes in social and family dynamics. As a result, the\nimpact of employment on crime for women relative to men is an open question. In\na recent study, researchers used welfare reform legislation in the 1990s that increased\nemployment among women to examine variation in the impact of employment on crime\nby sex (Corman, Dave, and Reichman, 2014). The authors found significant negative ef-\nfects of women's work incentives on women's property crimes but no effect on other types\nof crime.\nIn a study analyzing the Transitional Aid Research Project (TARP) experiment among\nnewly released felons, Jurik (1983) gave at least two reasons to expect sex differences in a\npopulation of people with criminal records. First, women tend to have different criminal\nrecords than men have in terms of the nature of past offenses; and second, women may\nhave different family obligations than men have. For example, many mothers may have\nsole custody of small children, increasing the burden of child-care responsibilities. Despite\nthese differences, Jurik (1983) found little difference in the effects of TARP payments by\nsex, although she did find that number of weeks employed has a smaller negative effect\non women's crime.\nThis mixed evidence does not provide much guidance in predicting what we will find in\nthe current study, which deviates from previous work in several ways, but we can specu-\nlate. Everyone in the current study sample is active in the labor market and provisionally\nhired to work in the health-care setting, which is not the usual context for individuals re-\nturning home from prison where involvement in the labor market is the exception rather\nthan the rule (Apel and Sweeten, 2010). Furthermore, the individuals in our sample are\nexperiencing a criminal background check decision that has broad employment implica-\ntions beyond one individual job. DOH's clearance decision impacts all related jobs falling\nunder the DOH criminal background check mandate in the state (i.e., low-wage jobs in-\nvolving direct access to patients or residents in licensed institutions and agencies). There-\nfore, in addition to the background check analysis, we will also explore the effects of these\nincreased employment opportunities from the background check clearance, which serves\nas the mechanism for our main effects.\nOur sample predominantly comprises women and is older than the average individual\ninvolved in the criminal justice system. As a result, the individuals examined in this article\nhave a higher average risk when compared with the general population, but they have a\nlower average risk when compared with a typical pool of individuals with criminal records.\nIn this sense, we might anticipate small recidivism effects of employment in absolute terms\nsimply because the risk is lower than in standard studies of men recently released from\nprison. To examine this possibility, we will compare the effect of clearance across these\nimportant subgroups (men vs. women and older vs. younger individuals).\nIn 2006, the New York State Department of Health (DOH) was mandated to con-\nduct criminal history background checks on all individuals provisionally hired to work\nin certain low-wage, direct-access jobs in the health-care industry. \"Direct access\" refers\nto nonlicensed positions that involve contact with patients or residents, such as orderlies\nand nurse aides, in licensed nursing home, assisted living, and home health-care facilities.\nLicensed positions, such as nurses or psychologists, and volunteers are excluded from this\nparticular background check process.\nDOH's criminal background check process involves two decision points: a proposed\n(or initial) clearance decision and a final clearance decision. Between the two deci-\nsions, everyone who receives a proposed denial has the option to submit evidence of\nTable 1. Sample Stratification\nDecision Point Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4\nInitial/Proposed Decision Cleared Denied Denied Denied\nSubmitted Evidence of Rehabilitation N/A Yes Yes No\nFinal Decision Cleared Cleared Denied Denied\nNOTE: Based on the group classification table in Siwach (n.d.).\nrehabilitation in an attempt to reverse the proposed denial. The two-stage decision pro-\ncess essentially flips the proposed denial decision to a final clearance for a nontrivial (ap-\nproximately 16 percent), nonrandom proportion of the sample. In other words, DOH\nuses the additional information to clear another 16 percent of the sample during this\nadditional review. In addition to being substantively important, this step has important\nimplications for our analytic strategy. This section describes how the legal context directs\nthe initial decision and the implications of the two-stage process from a methodological\nperspective.\nState laws regulate when the criminal background check process occurs and outline\nthe requirements for the background check decision. DOH only conducts criminal back-\nground checks on individuals after they are provisionally hired by the local employer,\nwhich is beneficial to us analytically. Although we cannot observe the self-selection and\nemployer-selection process, within this group of provisionally hired individuals, DOH\nmakes the first-round background check decision based only on available criminal history\ninformation. This formal and independent criminal history review process does not con-\nsider (and DOH does not have access to) additional factors that employers may also care\nabout (such as personality or employability), which might be correlated with recidivism.\nFurthermore, state laws specify the factors that decision-makers must consider (Article\n23-A of the NY Correction Law) and specific offenses that automatically disqualify indi-\nviduals from these positions in the health-care sector (Public Health Law 28-E).\nAfter this initial clearance decision occurs, every individual who receives a proposed\ndenial has 30 calendar days to \"explain . . . why the prospective employee's eligibility for\nemployment should not be disproved\" (NYCRR Title 10, Part 402). This coincides with\nArticle 23-A's provision that employers need to consider evidence of rehabilitation and\ngood conduct in the criminal history background check, and DOH provides individuals\nreceiving proposed denial decisions a list of 13 examples that could be used as evidence\nof rehabilitation in a submission.2\nThe second stage of the decision process presents a complication to an otherwise\nstraightforward and predictable clearance decision. The option to contest the proposed\ndenial, and the subsequent reevaluation for those who do provide evidence of rehabili-\ntation, separates individuals into four groups. As displayed in table 1, the initial decision\nand the decision to contest the proposed denial defines how individuals are grouped into\nthe four subsamples. In previous research with these data, researchers used the groups\n2. Examples include letters of recommendation from previous employers or evidence of successfully\ncompleting an education, probation, or drug/alcohol treatment program. DOH notes that this list\nshould not be considered complete and that individuals may submit other indicators of rehabilita-\ntion and good conduct.\nto identify in part the average treatment effects (through bounding) in the likelihood of\nsubsequent arrest and found variation across the groups (Siwach, n.d.). The most impor-\ntant comparison is between groups 3 and 4, which both receive proposed denials and are\nultimately denied clearance. Individuals in group 4, who never contest the proposed deci-\nsion, have worse subsequent arrest outcomes when compared with those who unsuccess-\nfully submit evidence of rehabilitation (group 3; Siwach, n.d.). The two-stage process is\nproblematic in the current analysis because individuals in group 2 successfully contested,\nconverting the proposed denial to a clearance decision. We cannot observe factors such as\nmotivation, personality, human capital, or other social dynamics that may have influenced\ntheir decision to submit evidence of rehabilitation or their success in doing so.\nAs selection into the second clearance round introduces endogeneity, the ordinary\nleast-squares (OLS) estimates from regressing recidivism on final clearance are expected\nto be biased. To deal with this bias, our empirical strategy follows an instrumental vari-\nable approach, where we use the initial decision by the DOH decision maker as the instru-\nment. This initial decision is based solely on the criminal history record of the candidate.\nImportantly, the decision maker never meets the candidate and is not involved in the orig-\ninal hiring decision. In addition, we have access to the same criminal record information\nused by the DOH decision makers. Of course, the decision maker is not randomly as-\nsigning people to the treatment (clearance). Nevertheless, the internal policies that DOH\nimplements, along with the legal and policy context, create a situation where initial de-\ncisions are unusually predictable to researchers with access to extensive criminal history\ninformation. Kurlychek et al. (n.d.) demonstrated that we can correctly predict the initial\ndecision 89 percent of the time by following DOH's decision rules (i.e., the factors listed\nin Article 23-A and Public Health Law 28-E) and by using only the criminal record in-\nformation available to the decision-maker. We can almost perfectly predict cases that\nare guided by state law or internal policies, which represent high- and low-severity crim-\ninal histories, respectively (Kurlychek et al., n.d.). The less certain predictions are cases\nwith criminal records that fall in the discretionary middle (i.e., are subject to decision\nmaker discretion), but we also can control extensively for the criminal record characteris-\ntics that comprise this group and any minor decision-maker variation is exogenous to the\nindividual's subsequent arrest behavior.\nWe also observe additional detailed information on the person's arrest record and em-\nployment history (which the decision-maker does not see) that are correlated with offend-\ning. After fully controlling for the available information that determines the first-round\ndecision and this additional information, the leftover variation in the instrument (initial\nclearance) is plausibly random with respect to the outcome. With this framework, we es-\ntimate a LATE of the criminal background clearance decision on recidivism. We further\nbuild on this framework by exploring different treatment effects by sex and by interacting\nour treatment with age to evaluate variations in the impact of clearing someone for an\nemployment opportunity.\nDATA\nDOH provided us with information on everyone provisionally hired for the first time\nin 2008 or 2009 to work in specific low-wage, direct-access jobs in the health-care in-\ndustry in New York State. This includes demographic information (race, sex, age at the\ntime of the decision), contextual information (regional facility location, facility type), and\napplication information (the date the background check process started, decision letters,\nand decision dates). With a starting sample of 7,541 individuals with convictions (and no\nopen arrests), we link these data to detailed criminal history information from the New\nYork State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). The DCJS files contain all prior\narrest and conviction offenses and 3 years of follow-up data after the clearance decision.3\nWe then link these data to employment information from the New York State Depart-\nment of Labor (DOL) to include controls for employment and earnings in the 3 years\nprior to the clearance decision.4 Finally, we drop cases missing arrest or conviction infor-\nmation (n = 299). Our final sample size consists of 6,648 individuals.\nTraditionally, criminal history variables are the best predictors of future criminal be-\nhavior (Gendreau, Little, and Goggin, 1996). We use two sets of criminal history con-\ntrols: all arrest history available to us from DCJS and prior convictions known to DOH.\nAlthough the EEOC has recommended against the use of arrests in most cases for em-\nployment decision-making, this information is commonly used in risk prediction models\nin the criminal justice system (Gendreau, Little, and Goggin, 1996). Therefore, the arrest\ncontrols are intended to capture the propensity to engage in crime based on our clos-\nest measure to (unobservable) actual behavior. We include time since last arrest (linear\nand squared), age at first arrest (linear and squared), and the number of prior arrests for\ndifferent felony offenses (violent, property, drug, and other) and misdemeanor offenses\n(violent, property, drug, larceny, and other). Larceny misdemeanors are included as a\nseparate category because individuals cleared to work are anticipated to have full access\nto resident or patient personal property; therefore, this crime type is of particular interest\nin the current job context.\nFor prior convictions, we only include conviction events that would be visible to DOH\nat the time of the final decision (i.e., we exclude sealed convictions). The purpose of\nincluding the conviction controls is to mirror the information DOH used in the final\ndecision-making process as closely as possible. We include time since last conviction,\nage at first conviction, and the number of prior convictions for different felony offenses\n(violent, property, drug, and other) and misdemeanor offenses (violent, property, drug,\nlarceny, and other). We also include higher order and interaction terms in the models\nto saturate fully the influence of certain conviction types on DOH's decision-making. In\naddition to the squared terms for time since last conviction, age at first conviction, the\nnumber of felonies for a particular conviction type (violent, property, drug, or other), and\nthe number of misdemeanors for a particular conviction type (violent, property, drug,\nlarceny or other), we also interact time since last conviction with age at first conviction and\nwith the number of convictions for each conviction category (number of violent felonies,\n3. We link DCJS and DOH data by using New York State identification (NYSID) numbers, a unique\nfingerprint-based identifier that is created when individuals submit their fingerprints for the back-\nground check. Fifty individuals were missing a 3-year subsequent arrest follow-up window and are\ndropped. Arrests that do not lead to dispositions are not linked to a person in New York State until\nthe person's first conviction (after which, all arrests are linked to the individual's NYSID). There-\nfore, an individual with a conviction record may also have other NYSIDs for arrests that occurred\nprior to their first conviction, and as a result, we are undercounting arrests in our control variables.\n4. We link DOL and DOH data by using Social Security numbers (SSNs), and we lose 544 unmatched\ncases in the process. Reasons for missing NYS DOL data might include noncitizenship status, work-\ning outside the state, or illegitimate work that is not captured by the state, and it is a limitation of\nthis study.\nnumber of violent misdemeanors, number of drug felonies, etc.). This set of conviction\ncontrols is critical for our identifying assumption that after fully controlling for criminal\nhistory, including the information used by DOH, the initial decision is plausibly exoge-\nnous (see the Methods section).\nWe also use the DCJS data to measure two outcomes of interest: a subsequent arrest\nin New York State in the shorter term (within 1 year of the final clearance decision)\nand in the longer term (within 3 years of the final clearance decision).5 At a descriptive\nlevel, 11 percent of the sample was arrested within 1 year and 22 percent was arrested\nwithin 3 years of the final clearance decision. There are stark differences in the arrest\nrates for the cleared and denied groups; individuals perceived as lower risk by DOH were\ncleared for employment, but may have also experienced a causal effect from the em-\nployment opportunity. Table 2 shows that approximately 7 percent of the cleared sample\nwas arrested within 1 year (17 percent within 3 years), whereas a substantively higher\n17 percent of the denied sample was arrested within the same period (33 percent within\nThis sample is unusual in comparison with most criminal record studies in that it pri-\nmarily comprises women (more than two thirds). Approximately half of the sample is\nWhite, and the other half is Black. A large percentage of the sample (31 percent) was\nprovisionally hired to work in a facility in New York City, and these facilities are typi-\ncally licensed home-care services agencies (49 percent) or nursing homes (50 percent). In\nthe 3-year period prior to DOH's criminal background check, the sample worked a little\nmore than 1.5 years on average in jobs covered by unemployment insurance in New York\nState, and it earned approximately $10,200 per year on average in the preperiod. In terms\nof criminal history, the most common type of official reported crime involves property of-\nfenses; more than 60 percent of individuals in our sample have been arrested for at least\none property crime, whereas 47 percent have been convicted of a property offense. Indi-\nviduals in this sample have an average of 1.7 felony arrests and 3.7 misdemeanor arrests,\nwith an average of .4 felony convictions and 1.7 misdemeanor convictions. See table 2 for\nadditional sample descriptive statistics.\nMETHODS\nWe begin our analysis by estimating a linear probability model (LPM) predicting re-\ncidivism in New York State after the final decision letter. The LPM model estimates the\nfollowing:\nSi\nCi\nXi\nEi\nVi\nAi\n+ ui\nwhere Si\nis a binary variable for the recidivism outcome and Ci\nis a binary variable for\nwhether the individual was cleared in the final decision. Xi\n, Ei\n, Vi\n, and Ai\nare individ-\nual vectors for demographic/contextual factors, employment history, conviction history\n5. Although we originally planned to incorporate FBI records to measure subsequent arrests outside\nof New York State, the FBI changed its data-sharing arrangement with the National Institute of\nJustice during our grant period and we could not obtain the data for this study. We do observe\nand include out-of-state prior arrest and conviction information as part of the criminal history\ninformation that DOH was able to see.\nTable 2.

Subse-\nquent arrest is a useful recidivism measure because it is an early official point of contact\nwith the criminal justice system. In addition, subsequent arrests have particular mean-\ning to decision-makers and employers in this context because DCJS follows a \"rap-back\"\nprocedure whereby the agency reports all subsequent arrests to DOH (SEARCH, 2010).\nThese arrests are not adjudicated by DOH, but subsequent arrest notifications are passed\non to employers.\nBefore we introduce our instrumental variable approach, it is important to recognize\nthat we follow a linear estimation method (OLS, and as we will see later, 2SLS) through-\nout the entire analysis, even though our dependent variable is a binary outcome. There are\ntwo common concerns with using a linear model when the outcome variable is binary: The\npredicted outcome can lie outside the unit interval, and the error term is heteroskedas-\ntic by definition (the variance will vary with the latent probability p). Econometricians\nhave shown that coefficient estimates are unbiased and that the slopes estimated from\na linear model are similar to the marginal effects computed after probit (Angrist and\nPischke, 2009). As long as our purpose is to estimate the partial effects of the treatment\nvariable on the outcome, the fact that the predicted probabilities may lie outside the [0,1]\ninterval is not a concern (Wooldridge, 2010). Moreover, the concern about heteroskedas-\nticity can be easily overcome by reporting heteroskedasticity-consistent robust standard\nerror estimates in a LPM. We focus on the results from linear models in this study6 be-\ncause they are easier to interpret, but we also report the probit estimates in the tables in\nthe online supporting information,7 which confirm that our results are robust to model\nspecification.\nIn the basic model, our treatment is the final clearance decision. Therefore, as men-\ntioned, the treatment effect estimated from this model will be biased so long as there are\nunobservable factors that impact an individual's decision to contest the proposed/initial\ndenial that also impact recidivism. More formally, we expect:\nE(Ci\n, ui\nOne way to solve the problem of omitted variable bias, absent an experiment,\nis through some type of quasi-experimental design. Here we implement an instru-\nmental variable (IV) approach based on DOH's decision-making practices and use\nthe initial decision as an instrument for modeling the final decision and subse-\nquent recidivism relationship.

As robustness checks we estimated probit and instrumental variable probit (IV probit) models and\ncompared the marginal effects computed at the means of the covariates. We also employed a new\nmethod, local average response functions (LARF) (Abadie, 2003), which accounts for heterogene-\nity across our conditioning variables through a weighting mechanism. We found that our 2SLS\nresults were robust to all model specifications, and we only report those results here. We include\nthe IV probit results in the online supporting information.\n7. Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online\nTable 3. DOH Background Check Potential Outcomes and Groups\nDelivered Treatment\nCi\nAssigned Treatment (Instrument) Final Decision: Denial Final Decision: Clearance\nFi\nProposed Initial Denial (Compliers) (Always takers)\nFi\nInitial Clearance (Defiers) (Compliers)\nAlthough we can assume that everyone initially denied would have retained a final decision of clearance had\nthey experienced an initially cleared potential outcome, we cannot assume that group 1 would have retained a\nfinal clearance decision had they received a proposed initial denial. Therefore, not all individuals in group 1 are\nanticipated to be compliers based on the potential outcomes framework.\nvalid instrument should satisfy the following assumptions: 1) random assignment; 2)\nstrong correlation with the treatment; 3) exclusion restriction; and 4) individual-level\nmonotonicity.\nWe contend that as a result of the formal and informal legal and policy structures that\nguide initial decisions, after fully controlling for the candidate's criminal history known to\nDOH and other demographic and geographic characteristics, the leftover variation in the\ninitial decision is as good as random. We argue that this is true because the only factors\nthat are possibly endogenous between the initial decision and an individual's likelihood of\nrecidivism are included in the individual's conviction history. DOH uses this information\nin the background check process, and it is fully observable to our research team. Further-\nmore, as we discuss in the Results section, DOH's initial decision is strongly correlated\nwith its final decision. This is unsurprising considering that the first decision is the final\ndecision for individuals who are cleared in first decision, or those who are not cleared and\ndo not successfully contest the proposed denial. Hence, assumptions 1 and 2 are satis-\nfied by the instrument. Assumption 3 requires that the instrument should only impact the\noutcome through the treatment. We argue that the initial clearance decision only impacts\nrecidivism through the employment opportunities the final clearance decision provides.\nThe two-stage clearance process is fully contained within the DOH context, and DOH's\ninitial clearance decision cannot influence recidivism through another outlet external to\nDOH's final decision.\nThe final assumption that requires monotonicity of the instrument is best understood\nin a LATE framework. The IV approach provides a causal estimate of the impact of the\nclearance decision on subsequent arrest outcomes for a subsample of individuals known\nas \"compliers,\" or individuals who comply with the treatment only when they are assigned\nto it. In following Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), the compliance types in our study are\ngiven in table 3. Let Ci\nbe a binary variable for the treatment that equals 1 if the indi-\nvidual is cleared in DOH's final decision and 0 otherwise. Let Fi\nbe a binary variable for\nthe instrument, which equals 1 if the individual is cleared in DOH's first decision, and 0\notherwise. We look at potential outcomes Ci\n(Fi\n), such that:\nCi\n(Fi\n) =\nCi\n(1) , if Fi\nCi\n(0) , if Fi\nThe monotonicity (or no-defiers) assumption implies that:\nCi\nIn our particular context, no individuals are cleared in the first decision but denied in the\nfinal decision. In other words, once cleared in the first decision (Fi\n= 1), the final decision\nis always cleared (Ci\n= 1). This implies that the following equation will always hold:\nCi\nEquation (5) automatically satisfies equation (4), and therefore, our instrument plausibly\nsatisfies assumption 4.\nThe instrumental variable estimation is done through a two-stage, least-squares (2SLS)\nmodel with clearance in the first decision as an instrument for clearance in the final de-\ncision. More formally, for the variables defined in equation (1) and a binary variable for\nclearance in DOH's first decision Fi\n, the two-stage estimation is given by:\nCi\nFi\nXi\nEi\nVi\nAi\n+ vi\nSi\n^\nCi\nXi\nEi\nVi\nAi\n+ ui\nWe argue that Ci\nin equation (1) is potentially endogenous because of the candidate's dis-\ncretion to contest a proposed decision (or not) if denied. Equation (6) estimates Ci\nwith\nthe instrument Fi\n, and we insert the estimated final clearance decision, ^\nCi\n, in equation\n(7) to estimate Si\n. The inclusion of ^\nCi\nin equation (7) allows us to use only the exoge-\nnous variation in the final decision (or the part that is uncorrelated with the error term),\neliminating the endogeneity problem.\nin equation (7) generates the LATE by estimating the average\ntreatment responses for the compliers. The compliers in our study include everyone who\nwould receive the same treatment status (i.e., final decision) as the instrument (or initial\ndecision), irrespective of whether they were cleared or received a proposed denial in the\ninitial decision. In the case of one-sided compliance as supported by equation (5), every-\none receiving a proposed denial in the initial decision and denied in the final decision is\na complier, despite whether they contested the proposed denial decision (groups 3 and 4;\nsee table 1). The outcome of equation (5) implies that had these individuals been cleared\nin the initial decision, they would have retained that clearance status (and would not have\nthe option or ability to switch to a denial status).\nBased on the same reasoning, some individuals in group 1 are expected to be com-\npliers. Although the proportion of compliers can be estimated, the specific individuals\nwho comprise the group of compliers cannot be determined (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin,\n1996). Instead, we again rely on expectations based on the potential outcomes framework\n(Imbens and Angrist, 1994). Had the individuals in group 1 received a proposed denial,\nsome likely would have contested the decision and received a final clearance decision (re-\nsulting in noncompliance). Others may not have, resulting in compliance. Individuals in\ngroup 2, on the other hand, switch their treatment status between the first and final de-\ncisions. Group 2 individuals are classified as \"always takers\"--i.e., they always take the\ntreatment (clearance) irrespective of the instrument. In the current study, there are no\n\"never takers,\" as observed in equation (5), because individuals cannot be denied after\nreceiving clearance in the initial decision. Because LATEs only produce estimates for\nindividuals moved by the instrument, always takers and never takers are excluded from\nthe LATE.\nFinally, after establishing the strength of our instrument and the main treatment ef-\nfects estimated by the 2SLS, we look at heterogeneity within these effects. We estimate\nseparate models for men and women, and we include interaction effects of treatment (fi-\nnal clearance) and age, where we specify age as continuous and as a dummy variable for\nwhether the candidate was older than 30 years old at the time of receiving DOH's final\ndecision. This exercise enables us to compare the effect of being cleared for work on re-\ncidivism for four different profiles of people: young men, young women (30 years old),\nolder men, and older women (>30 years old).8\nRESULTS\nLPM, first-stage, and 2SLS results for any subsequent arrest in 1 year and 3 years are\nshown in table 4. First we display the F statistic results in panel A. Our F statistic for the\ninstrument in the first-stage estimation is close to 3,700. These values are also large in the\nseparate models for men and women, with the larger F statistic for women reflecting the\nlarger sample. In all cases, the F statistics are well above the guidelines proposed by Stock\nand Watson (2003), and F statistics of this size are unusual (Angrist and Kreuger, 2001).\nIn this context, though, the power of the instrument is not surprising because the initial\nproposed decision is, for most individuals, the same as the final decision.\nIn the basic LPM for the whole sample, as displayed in panel B, a final clearance de-\ncision is related to approximately a 2.7-percentage-point decrease in official arrests in\nthe subsequent year. Next, we incorporate our initial clearance decision instrument into\nthe model to address the potential endogeneity in the final clearance decision/subsequent\narrest relationship. The 2SLS estimator indicates only a slightly more conservative (\u00ad2.2-\npercentage-point) impact of clearance to work on subsequent arrest in 1 year. The results\nare substantively large (the overall sample base rate is 10 percent) but not statistically\nsignificant at the .05 alpha level for a two-tailed test. The longer term (3 years) subse-\nquent arrest results are displayed in panel C. The basic LPM model suggests an almost\n4-percentage-point decrease in the likelihood of arrest over the 3-year postperiod from\nclearance to work, whereas the 2SLS estimate is slightly larger at (negative) 4.2 percent-\nage points. Unlike the 1-year results, the 3-year postperiod result for the full model is\nsignificant at the 5 percent level.\nIn addition, we look at the main effects of sex and age at the time of the DOH decision\non arrest probability. When considering the full model, men are 4.1 percentage points\nmore likely to be subsequently arrested within a year as compared with women (panel\nB). This difference is both statistically significant and substantively large. We also find\n8. Uggen (2000) used a cutoff of age 26. Although the mean age in his sample was approximately 25,\nour sample mean is around 39. As a result of having too few people younger than age 26 in our\nsample, we are underpowered when we use Uggen's cutoff point. Therefore, we use a marginally\nhigher age cutoff of 30 in our analysis, although we do find that the general direction of the treat-\nment effects hold when replicating Uggen's analysis with age 26 as the cutoff. We only report the\nage 30 results here.\nTable 4. Subsequent Arrest Outcomes\nPanel B\nSubsequent Arrest in 1 Year\nPanel C\nSubsequent Arrest in 3 Years\nPanel A\n2SLS First Stage Full Men Women Full Men Women\nNOTES: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Note that in the first-stage models, the final clearance decision (and not subsequent arrest) is the depndent\nvariable. Not all control variables are shown. The R\u00b2 value does not have a natural interpretation in the second stage (Wooldridge, 2003) and is therefore excluded\nhere. See the tables in the online supporting information for the full models with all control variables.\nABBREVIATIONS: 2SLS = two-stage, least-squares model; F Stat = F statistic; LPM = linear probability model.\nthat age is negatively related to the likelihood of subsequent arrests in a year with a .4-\npercentage-point decrease with every additional year of age. Neither result is surprising--\nmen are more likely than women to be arrested and older people are less likely than\nyounger people to be arrested, all else constant. Men are also much more likely than\nwomen to be subsequently arrested in 3 years (6.3 percentage points), and being older by\nan additional year reduces the likelihood of arrest by .7 percentage points (see full model,\npanel C).\nAs described, our sample is female dominated, and we run the entire model separately\nfor men and women to exploit this study feature and examine heterogeneous effects\nof clearance by sex. The 2SLS results in table 4 (panel B) show that the impact of get-\nting cleared to work is 7.8 percentage points for men in the first year after the decision\nwhen holding other factors constant. Conversely, at least in the short term, we find that\nclearance to work has no impact on women's subsequent arrest outcomes, which suggests\nthat men benefit substantially more so than women from clearance in terms of reduced\nrecidivism.\nAs with the 1-year results, the effect of clearance is largely concentrated on men in the\nlonger term--the models in panel C suggest men are 8.4 percentage points less likely to\nbe arrested over 3 years when cleared, whereas the effect for women is only 2.4 percent-\nage points and not statistically significant. The difference between the effect sizes for men\nand women is statistically significant over the first year (t statistic of 2.34) but insignificant\nover the longer term (t statistic of 1.39). It is important to keep in mind when comparing\neffects across different samples that the standard errors will always be affected by the\ndifferent properties of the two samples. Therefore, although the difference between men\nand women may not be statistically significant in 3 years, the different criminal histories\nbetween them (which produce different estimates) could potentially be a reason for this.\nIn summary, we conclude that men are more affected by clearance to work when com-\npared with women, and a potential explanation is that men and women look different\nin terms of their overall criminal histories--a major factor that defines the relationship\nbetween work and recidivism.\nOne thing to note is that the effect sizes from the 2SLS models, at least when esti-\nmated on the whole sample, are not so different from the linear probability estimates\nin both short- and long-term models. Indeed the results of the traditional endogeneity\ntests9 confirm that the differences between the basic and IV results are not statistically\nsignificant. Nevertheless, the endogeneity tests only compare the models examined here,\nand this conclusion does not apply to all instruments used even within our sample con-\ntext. The 2SLS models estimate a local average treatment effect, which is based on the\ntreatment for the compliers (see table 3). As compliers are those individuals who are\nmoved or influenced by the instrument, using different instruments will identify different\ngroups of compliers and, therefore, different local effects. LPMs, on the other hand, esti-\nmate an average association between clearance and recidivism. The endogeneity tests are\ncomparing the \"compliers-specific\" LATE based on our instrument\u00ad\u00adand not an average\ntreatment effect (ATE)\u00ad\u00adwith the LPM results, so we are unable to say that the LPM\nmodel is unbiased. In addition, the results from the statistical tests should be interpreted\n9. This can be obtained from either the Wald test of exogeneity from the IV model or by including\nthe residuals from the first-stage equation into the original (potentially endogenous) equation of\ninterest and examining the \"residual\" variable's z value.\nwith caution because failing to reject the null hypothesis of no endogeneity does not im-\nply that the treatment is exogenous. This is particularly relevant in the subsamples by sex\nbecause small sample sizes will reduce statistical power. Moreover, there are substantive\ndifferences between the LPM and 2SLS estimates for men (almost a 2.5-percentage-point\ndifference), who experience the highest impact of clearance, suggesting that the 2SLS es-\ntimates are consistent over the LPM estimates, and should be used for interpreting the\ncausal effects of clearance to work.\nTo summarize, we find that our instrument identifies the LATE with substantial power.\nEssentially, the proposed decision, conditional on observable information, creates an ef-\nfective identification strategy in this study context where decision makers are making\nnarrowly defined decisions with a clearly defined set of inputs that are observable to re-\nsearchers. We find large heterogeneity in the treatment effects by sex, where clearance has\nalmost no effect on women but reduces the likelihood of subsequent arrests by almost 8\npercentage points for men in the first year after the criminal background check.\nTo understand the variation in these treatment effects, we next estimate heterogeneous\ntreatment effects by age in our instrumental variable models. In addition to the new Treat-\nment \u00d7 Age interaction, we also include Instrument \u00d7 Age in the first stage, which en-\nables the model to remain just-identified. Table 5 presents the 2SLS estimates for the\ntreatment variable, as well as the interaction terms with age, for a subsequent arrest in 1\nyear (panel A) and in 3 years (panel B).\nWe allow the age interaction with clearance to take two forms. In the first model, we\ninteract the treatment variable (clearance) with the actual age of the individual at the\ntime of DOH's decision (given in columns 1A, 2A, and 3A). Similar to Uggen (2000), we\nalso include a dummy analysis for age (30 or >30) (given in columns 1B, 2B, and 3B).\nAs the results in columns 2A and 3A suggest, being older by 1 year reduces the absolute\nimpact of a DOH clearance by .5 percentage points for men (p = .057) and by .2 percent-\nage points for women (p = .121). When we look at the interaction between the treatment\nand the dummy for age higher than 30 years old, we do not find evidence that the effect of\nclearance varies for men in a statistically significant way by age in 1-year or 3-year post-\ndecision (columns 2B and 5B). For women, there is only a statistically meaningful effect\nfor subsequent arrests in 3 years (column 6B), where we find that women older than\n30 years experience almost no effect from the clearance decision, whereas women\nyounger than 30 years are 7.7 percentage points less likely to be rearrested because\nof clearance and have a 7.5-percentage-point larger treatment effect relative to older\nwomen. When we consider the fact that almost 74 percent of women in our sample are\nolder than 30 years old, it is not surprising that disregarding the heterogeneous effects by\nage leads to a null impact for all women.\nThe effect of the clearance decision should come from increased employment op-\nportunities for cleared individuals, which is in turn expected to reduce their likelihood\nof future engagement in illegal activities. In our case, approximately 83 percent of the\nindividuals who were cleared to work had formal employment of some kind in the quar-\nter after the period when the final criminal background check decision was made, and\nTable 5.

Some of those cleared did not end up working at the job for\nwhich they were provisionally hired, some did not last long (i.e., into the next quarter)\nbecause of the high turnover rate in these jobs, and others seem to have moved to other\njobs outside the industry.\nThese conditions present us with a unique opportunity to test the mechanism by which\nclearance works to reduce recidivism. If the impact of clearance works through employ-\nment and not through another mechanism, then the effect from comparing those who\nwere cleared and actually worked with those who did not work should be bigger than the\nresults displayed in table 4. In terms of employment effects, the results in table 4 are \"di-\nluted\" by individuals who are cleared but do not work (and by individuals who are denied\nbut still work). To test this idea, we use the initial decision to instrument first for health-\ncare employment and then for overall employment in the quarter immediately after the\nbackground check. By doing so, we can capture the effect of increased work (employ-\nment as the treatment) because of the initial clearance decision (first-stage relationship).\nIn a situation where some cleared individuals may not work, as in this situation, the effect\nwill get larger but only if the effect of clearance works mainly through employment. To\nensure that we avoid reverse causality, we remove individuals who were arrested within\nthat initial postdecision quarter and we use subsequent arrests within the first year as the\noutcome of interest. The 2SLS results from using employment instead of clearance as the\ntreatment of interest are given in table 6.\nAs displayed in panel A, we find that working in the health-care sector in that ini-\ntial quarter reduces the likelihood of arrests by 3.8 percentage points for the entire sam-\nple; although this coefficient does not reach the conventional thresholds for statistical\nsignificance, the result is in the anticipated direction. The result is statistically significant\nfor men; as before, we find that men experience an effect of almost 11 percentage points,\nwhereas women have no effect of health-care employment on their arrest outcomes. To\nget an even tighter estimate on the mechanism, because some individuals who were de-\nnied could have gone on to obtain employment elsewhere, we look at the effect of overall\nemployment in the first quarter on subsequent arrests in the first year (panel B). This ef-\nfect should be even bigger, if the mechanism is through employment, because the gap in\nemployment levels for those cleared compared with those not cleared is not as big as the\ngap in health-care employment. We find that even though women still have a low-to-null\neffect, the men in our sample experience a substantial impact from employment, reducing\ntheir 1-year arrest outcomes by 16 percentage points if employed in the initial quarter.\nIn summary, the large effect of clearance on arrests for men can be explained by in-\ncreased employment opportunities in the health-care industry that would otherwise be\nunavailable. Indeed, individuals who were cleared to work by DOH had average earnings\nof approximately $15,300 in the year after the DOH decision--more than twice as much\nas those denied in the criminal background check (\u00df$6,700 on average).\nThis article uses an instrumental variable analysis to generate an estimate of the impact\nof a criminal background check clearance on recidivism outcomes for a sample of individ-\nuals with criminal records who are attached to the labor market and provisionally hired to\nwork. Our results indicate that receiving clearance on the basis of a criminal record alone\ndecreases the likelihood of a subsequent arrest by 2.2 percentage points over 1 year. Dur-\ning a 3-year period, clearance leads to a 4.2-percentage-point decrease in the likelihood\nof a subsequent arrest. More importantly, we find that this effect is driven by the men in\nour sample, whereas older women in particular experience an almost null effect of this\nparticular work opportunity on their arrest outcomes.\nAlthough the current study context enables us to generate causal estimates within the\nvast and growing health-care industry in New York State, these results cannot speak to\nall industries or all criminal background check processes. We believe our results are most\ngeneralizable for individuals with criminal records who are pursuing jobs that involve\nstate-mandated, formalized criminal background checks, which includes those applying\nfor occupational licenses (Thompson, 2008). Our results might also be particularly rele-\nvant for employers and states expanding criminal background checks in the nursing home\nindustry as part of mandates in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (CNA, 2012). Future\nwork should examine whether our findings apply to other criminal background check\ncontexts in the United States. In addition, researchers may be able to generate national\nestimates in European countries such as Spain and the Netherlands, where one central\nrepository provides employee clearances across most job contexts (Jacobs and Larrauri,\nThe effects in the current study are substantively large, especially when compared with\nearlier findings from employment and job training programs that often do not find that\nwork opportunities lead to meaningful reductions in recidivism (Bushway and Apel, 2012;\nGallagher, and MacKenzie, 2000). The difference in the size of the impact may be the\nresult of the differences in the sample--provisionally hired employees who are motivated\nand in the labor market--or the nature of the treatment. The most plausible reason for\nthe decrease in subsequent arrests is through employment, which in the short run is driven\nalmost mechanistically by the clearance decision.\nIt is also interesting to note that the point estimate in this study is nearly twice the size\nof the upper bound of the ATE that Siwach (n.d.) estimated with a partial identification\nstrategy on the same data.10 Based on the bounds in that study, the difference in sub-\nsequent arrests in 3 years for an average individual who was cleared and for an average\nindividual who was not cleared in the entire sample should be at most 2.2 percentage\npoints. In this study, we estimate the LATE for those who comply with DOH's first-stage\ncriminal background check decision. Some individuals, particularly those who are willing\nto contest the original denial decision, may not respond in the same way to the treatment,\nand Siwach (n.d.) pointed to these variations, indicating that individuals who successfully\ncontest the initial denial experience null treatment effects.\nBecause our instrument identifies the effect for compliers with the first clearance de-\ncision, those who successfully contest the initial decision are excluded. Therefore, the\nLATE in this study points to a much larger estimate than does the ATE. Both estimates\nare potentially important to policy makers; in the current study, it is advantageous to study\nthe impact coming from the initial decision because most policy rules regarding criminal\nrecords are used in determining that initial proposed decision, not the final decision. The\nLATE in this article speaks directly to the effects of those policy rules.\nAnother significant contribution of our study is the identification of the heterogene-\nity in the LATE by sex and age. We find that, on average, older individuals experience\nsmaller treatment effects (.3 percentage points less for every year older) on subsequent\narrest. Yet we also find substantial differences in the effect of clearance between men and\nwomen by age, with older women experiencing almost no effect of clearance to work on\ntheir subsequent arrest outcomes. Our sample contains older individuals, on average, and\nolder women, in particular. Because everyone in our sample was provisionally hired, the\nsample composition differs from that in many other prior studies that explored the rela-\ntionship between employment and recidivism. Potentially for this reason, unlike Uggen\n(2000), we find that both younger and older men seem to be responsive to the background\ncheck decision.\nThe strength of the age-graded effects is notably different for women, where we find\nthat older women are not responsive to clearance in terms of reduced recidivism. The\nresults of prior research have led to the suggestion that women experience different path-\nways into crime (Daly, 1992) and that the transition from adolescence into adulthood is\nassociated with desistance for women but not for men, meaning that women desist ear-\nlier than men do, typically as a result of important life transition events (Graham and\nBowling, 1995; Liu, 2015). It is possible that younger women are disproportionately af-\nfected by a clearance for work largely because the older women in our sample are simply\nnot likely to be arrested, despite whether they receive a clearance to work.\nThe results inevitably highlight the need to consider both the benefits of clearance to in-\ndividuals with criminal records and the potential public safety costs associated with failing\nto do adequate criminal background checks. With more than 109,000 residents in certified\n10. Partial identification does not create a point estimate but instead provides a range of viable esti-\nmates associated with different plausible assumptions (Manski and Pepper, 2000).\nnursing facilities in New York State in 2008 (Harrington, Carrillo, and Garfield, 2014),\nDOH is directly responsible for safeguarding a sizeable group of vulnerable individuals\nbeing cared for by those individuals who pass the background check. This article does not\naddress this second half of the equation--we do not explore the costs of clearing individ-\nuals who ultimately do go on to offend on the job. The base rates of arrest for our sample\nare not trivial (22 percent over 3 years), and approximately 8 percent of the sample has a\nfelony subsequent arrest and 5 percent has an automatic disqualifying subsequent arrest\noffense within 3 years. The trade-off between the benefits to those with records who are\ncleared for employment and the costs to those in direct care who might be harmed by em-\nployees is not a simple policy choice, and it is not immediately clear how to balance these\ncosts better. This lack of clarity becomes even muddier if, as suggested by our heteroge-\nneous treatment effect analysis, those with the highest risk (young people, men) are also\nthe most likely to benefit from clearance. Future research is clearly needed to explore the\ntrade-off for specific rules guiding these criminal background checks.\nThere is also the potential for future studies that aim to explore whether actuarial risk\nassessment tools can improve the efficiency of this criminal background check by more\naccurately identifying \"risky\" individuals in this population. A more systematic risk as-\nsessment tool might also allow policy makers to identify cases where expanding criminal\nbackground check clearance can reduce recidivism without increasing harm to employers\nas well as the patients of nursing home facilities and home health-care agencies.\nGiven the increasing use of criminal background checks in employment decisions, it\nis becoming ever more important to identify the potential costs and benefits associated\nwith these decisions. By providing an estimate of the benefits associated with offering an\nopportunity to work to individuals with criminal records, we supply the motivation and\nan essential starting point for the growing discussion surrounding optimal policies regard-\ning criminal background checks for employment purposes. Future research is needed to\nboth identify the potential benefit of further increases in criminal background clearance\nrates as well as guidance for identifying the best candidates for clearance who will not\njeopardize public safety.\nREFERENCES\nAbadie, Alberto. 2003.
