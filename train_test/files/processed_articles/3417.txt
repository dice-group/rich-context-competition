Population with DS was found\nto have typically sedentary lifestyle, to participate less in\nsport activities, and to fail the Chief Medical Officer's\na day (Frey, Stanish, & Temple, 2008; Gonzalez-Aguero\nquence is the risk of intensifying clinical diseases by devel-\noping specific health-related complications such as the\naccumulation of bone mass, the type 2 diabetes, and motor\nfunctional impairments (Barr & Shields, 2011). Similarly,\nhigh levels of inactivity are stated in typically developing\npeople despite data demonstrating physiological and psy-\nchological gains from PA. A 60% of inactivity is reported in\nItaly, as shown by data from the Special Eurobarometer 412\n(March 2014) on the issue \"Sport and Physical Activity.\"\nNevertheless, the participation in sport activities is a mul-\ntidimensional construct that involves a variety of facilitators\nand barriers. The first are positive factors enhancing the par-\nticipation of people with DS in PA, for example, parental\nsupport, opportunities and programs for participation, acces-\nsible transportation, access to resources, and so on.

In the\noriginal model, higher predictors of child engagement in PA\nare the predisposing factors, such as child's self-efficacy,\nattitudes and personal beliefs on PA, and physical self-com-\npetence. Moreover, reinforcing factors are conditions sup-\nporting PA behaviors in childhood, such as family, peer, and\nteacher/coach influence. Equally important are enabling fac-\ntors such as the child's physical skills and fitness level as\nwell as the access to gyms and environment. Indirect influ-\nence is played by personal demographics, such as age, eth-\nnicity, and socioeconomic status. Recently, an adapted model\nof the YPAP was developed by Downs, Boddy, Knowles,\nFairclough, and Stratton (2013). It included enabling, predis-\nposing, and reinforcing factors to PA for children with DS.\nEnabling factors involved environment, seasonal variation\nsuch as decrease in PA during winter months, access and\ntransport, level of fitness and kind of activity (swimming,\ntrampolining, dance, bowling), skills, and independence.\nPredisposing factors to PA engagement included enjoyment\nand play, social interaction, understanding of PA, and to be\nable to follow the instructions. Finally, reinforcing factors to\nPA were support and opportunities, and parents and care pro-\nviders' education about the importance of PA.\nSo, as for children with intellectual disability, three main\ncategory factors influence the engagement in PA: individual,\nfamiliar, and environmental variables (Downs et al., 2013;\nMahy, Shields, Taylor, & Dodd, 2010). Individual character-\nistics include age, gender, the level of sport motivation,\nmotor and cognitive abilities, and the kind and the severity of\ndisability. Females, older individuals, and people with lower\nlevel of education and higher level of severity of disability\nare more likely to show decrease in variety, frequency, and\nduration of PA (Kristen, Patriksson, & Fridlund, 2002;\nLippold & Burns, 2009). Therefore, personal factors which\nencourage greater participation are higher level of self-\nesteem or self-determination and mastery motivation to face\nchallenging motor tasks (Badia, Orgaz, Verdugo, Ullan, &\nHay, & Faught, 2013). Second, family variables that might\nencourage greater participation in PA are mainly emotional\nand economic support. The first arouses the children's sense\nof competence and determination, while the latter allows to\nbear the costs of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) programs\n(George, Shacter, & Johnson, 2011; Trost, Kerr, Ward, &\nPate, 2001). Finally, environmental characteristics might\nconcern the availability of APA programs for children with\nPA and APA will be used in an interchangeable way. As com-\npared with traditional, the APA is an individualized PA that is\nspecifically modified to address the needs of people with dis-\nabilities in accordance with the international classification of\nfunctioning (ICF) model (World Health Organization\n[WHO], 2001). It enhances the acceptance of individual\ndifferences by promoting the access to active lifestyle and\nsport encompassing gymnastics, dance, movement, exercise,\nsports, games, recreation, and physical education.\nConsequently, the APA employs adapted methods, such as\npeer tutoring, in the context of large size class teaching;\nadapted equipment and rules, such as bigger balls to enable\nbouncing; adapted environmental variables such as a lower\nnet height for the volleyball; and qualified and expert at dif-\nferent kinds of disabilities coaches (Hutzler & Sherrill,\nTo sum up, personal, familiar, and environmental charac-\nteristics are interrelated by reciprocally reinforceing links.\nFor example, the few number of gyms offering APA exercise\nprograms can oblige families to move for long distances by\nenhancing the costs of transportation and, in the long run,\ndecreasing the motivation to engage in PA.\nHowever, barriers and facilitators are to be found by\nfocusing on factors influencing parents' decisions to stimu-\nlate their children in sport participation. Family support\nrevealed to be a crucial factor influencing the choice of sport\nand leisure activities and the subsequent maintenance of\ncompliance to exercise programs in the population with DS\n(Inglis, Lohn, Austin, & Hippman, 2014).\nMenear (2007) investigated parental beliefs concerning\nPA needs in DS by interviewing parents of children with DS\nfrom preschool age to adolescence. She compared themes\nderived from four focus groups (preschoolers' parents, ele-\nmentary-age children's parents, teenagers' parents, and\nmixed age groups). Four themes were quite frequent across\nall four of the focus groups: (a) short- and long-term health\nbenefits of PA on their children, (b) social benefits from rela-\ntionship with peers, (c) sport opportunities to play an indi-\nvidual sport for teenagers, and (d) need to receive parent\neducation concerning home-based PA intervention programs\nor to enhance community-based PA programs delivered for\nchildren with DS. So, Menear pointed out the need to edu-\ncate parents and care providers on the benefits of PA and\nactive lifestyle.\nBased on these issues, this study aims at comparing the\nbeliefs on facilitators and barriers to participation in PA\namong parents of children1 with DS and parents of TDC.\nA phenomenological theoretical framework was chosen\nto carry out semistructured interviews with the parents.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 35 families subdivided into two groups:\nthe first group was composed of 19 families with children and\nadolescents with DS and the second one was composed of 16\nfamilies with TDC. In the first group, there were 11 mothers\nand 8 fathers. The parents'median age was 54.59 years (range\nchildren had the diagnosis of Trisomy 21 and from early\nchildhood had been engaged in structured speech therapy or\npsychomotor activities or music therapy. Parents' inclusion\ncriteria were (a) to be a parent of a child with DS, (b) to have\npresent or past experience with their children's engagement in\nsport activities, (c) to be an Italian speaker, and (d) to be\nCaucasian race.\nIn the second group, there were 13 mothers and 3 fathers.\n\u00b17.23). The children were eight boys and eight girls with a\nchildren were typically developing. These parents were\nmatched to those of the first group along with their chil-\ndren's, here hypothesized, cognitive profile. We chose this\ncriterion, despite their chronological age, because of the big\ndifference in lifestyle among adolescents and young ones\nwith DS and typically developing peers.\nAll the parents were from medium socioeconomic level.\nThe parents of children with DS were recruited through\ngyms or nonprofit associations offering support and commu-\nnity resources for people with DS and their families. They\nwere invited to meet with researchers, to become familiar\nwith the goals of the study and its procedures. Following this\nfirst meeting, the participation rate to the interview was of\nabout 60%, while the parents of TDC were recruited through\nschools attended by their children.\nPrior to the start of the study, appropriate local ethics\ncommittee approval provided by the University of Palermo\nwas obtained.\nInterview\nA semistructured interview was developed to investigate\nthe parental beliefs on facilitators/barriers to activities as\nwell as physical and psychological benefits of sport in\nchildren.\nFirst, data were collected on the children's history and the\nfamily background by the evaluation of parameters such as\nparents' academic history and jobs. Second, the interviewer\nfollowed a schedule of focused and open questions on facili-\ntators/barriers and benefits of PA.\nAll the interviews were conducted by the same researcher\nand lasted no more than 25 min.\nData Analysis\nAll the interviews were transcribed to allow the thematic\nanalysis of answers. Transcripts were read independently by\ntwo researchers to identify quotes revealing meaningful\nthemes and remove inappropriate quotes. Consequently, the\naccepted quotes were clustered into categories highlighting\ncommon themes which were classified on the basis of their\nfrequency of occurrence to identify the most important\nthemes as facilitation or barrier. Similar procedure was fol-\nlowed for both the groups.\nThe identified themes were displayed into four figures:\nTwo figures show facilitators to PA identified by the parents\nof children with DS and TDC (Figures 1 and 2), and two\nfigures show barriers to PA identified by the parents of chil-\ndren with DS and TDC (Figures 3 and 4).\nResults\nIn the group of parents with children with DS, three main\nfacilitation themes were identified: (a) the support from fam-\nily, (b) the presence of expert at APA instructors and coaches\nFigure 1. Facilitators to PA identified by the parents of children\nwith DS.\nNote. PA = physical activity; DS = Down syndrome; APA = Adapted\nPhysical Activity.\nFigure 2.

Benefits identified by the parents of children with DS.\nNote. DS = Down syndrome.\nFigure 6. Benefits identified by the parents of children with TDC.\nNote. TDC = typically developing children.\nand the availability of gyms, and (c) the challenging nature\nof sport activities (Figure 1).\nThe family revealed to be considered the first facilitator.\nThe parents of children with DS showed to recognize the key\nrole of siblings (11) and themselves (18) to motivate their\nchildren in sport participation. However, the majority (13) of\nthem judged not relevant to their personal engagement as a\nmodel for children. The second facilitator was the availabil-\nity of instructors able to train children with DS using theAPA\n(18). This factor was strictly associated to gyms with special-\nized sport machines and without architectural barriers (13).\nThe last facilitating theme identified in our interviews was\nthe nature of PA: socialization (19), challenging (15), or\nenjoying (11). Sport activities were considered as an oppor-\ntunity to experiment successes by facing up to themselves\nand the others with similar characteristics.\nIn the group of parents with TDC, two main facilitation\nthemes were identified: (a) the support from family and (b)\nthe characteristics of sport activities (Figure 2).\nIn this group, the family revealed to be considered the\nfirst facilitator. The key role of siblings (5) and them-\nselves (16) to motivate their children in sport participa-\ntion and to act as a model (11) was recognized. The\nsecond facilitator was the expertise of instructors at PA\n(14) as well as the nature of PA characterized by chal-\nand agonistic activity (5).\nWith concern to the barriers, the parents of children with\nDS identified three main themes: (a) the lack of expert at\nAPA instructors and coaches, (b) the DS characteristics, and\n(c) the worries of parents (Figure 3).\nParents argued that the lack of adapted exercise classes\n(13) and programs of inclusion (10) for children with DS\nwere the main barriers. Moreover, the scarce presence of\nexpert at APA coaches was acknowledged (13).\nAnother significant barrier concerned the physical and\nmedical characteristics of DS, such as gross motor impair-\nments (11), hypotonicity (9), weight (8), heart impairments\n(7), and coordination difficulties (4). With regard to psycho-\nlogical domain, limited cognitive abilities (7) were consid-\nered as a barrier to the engagement in sport more than the\nlimited communication abilities (2). Taken together, these\nfactors increased the worries of parents (7) by creating an\nextra obstacle.\nThe parents of TDC recognized the family as the\nmain barrier: no time to spend for sport activities (13),\nthe difficulties of transportation (13), the economical\nresources (10), and the worries about eventual failures\nFinally, similar physical and psychological benefits were\nadvanced by all our interviewed parents (Figures 5 and 6).\nFor the parents of children with DS, the physical benefits\nincluded reducing the obesity (12) and improving the motor\ncoordination (9). The psychological benefits concerned\nincreasing self-esteem (16) and self-image (13), and improv-\ning socialization skills (13) and cognitive functions such as\nmemory and attention (8).\nFigure 4. Barriers to PA identified by the parents of children\nwith TDC.\nNote. PA = physical activity; TDC = typically developing children.\nFor the parents of TDC, the physical benefits were reduc-\ning the obesity (15), improving the motor coordination (16),\npreventing the diabetes (15), and decreasing the insomnia\n(12). The psychological benefits included increasing self-\nesteem (16) and self-image (16), and improving socializa-\ntion skills (16) and cognitive functions such as memory and\nDiscussion\nThe main goal of the described study was to investigate the\nparental beliefs concerning facilitators/barriers and benefits\nof PA among the families of children with DS and the fami-\nlies of TDC.\nOn the whole, all the interviewed parents stated that fam-\nily plays a key role to influence children's engagement in PA.\nThe parents of children with DS recognized the role of fam-\nily both as facilitator and barrier to the participation of chil-\ndren in PA. This result is consistent with previous research,\nwhich demonstrated how parents deliver emotional/motiva-\ntional and economic support. These are necessary to face\nchallenging tasks as well as the transportation and the costs\nThe costs of sports programs, the equipment, and the trans-\nportation are expensive and rely on family available econom-\nical resourcess (Cordes & Howard, 2005; Van Naarden\nBraun, Yeargin-Allsopp, & Lollar, 2006).\nHowever, as previously mentioned, family is consid-\nered as a barrier at the same time because of parental wor-\nries regarding gross motor impairments, hypotonicity,\noverweight, heart impairments, and limited cognitive and\ncommunication abilities linked to the specific disability of\ntheir children. All these factors may increase the family\noverprotection by limiting the participation to sport activ-\nity in their children (Frey et al., 2008). These parents, as\nopposed to the parents of TDC, did not recognize their role\nof model to influence the starting and maintaining compli-\nance to exercise programs by their children. Research\ndescribes the family modeling as an important factor in\ndetermining the amount, the duration, and the complexity\nof their children's sport activities (Temple & Stanish,\nThe study findings showed that the availability of expert\nat APA instructors and coaches is another main factor, both\nas facilitator and barrier, which plays a crucial role in the\nengagement in PA by children with DS. This staff was\nrequired to be specifically trained for the special needs of\ntheir children. Our parents identified that a support staff may\ninitiate and sustain the participation in PA over the time.\nThese findings are in agreement with other research that\nfound a close relationship between the limited opportunities\nto participate in PA and the lack of specific training programs\naddressed to people with DS (Mahy et al., 2011). Moreover,\nthis barrier is often strengthened by the lack of accessible\nservices and facilities such as gyms and buildings with spe-\ncialized sport machines and without architectural barriers.\nOther differences in parental beliefs between our two\ngroups emerged in the perception of features characterizing\nsport activities. The parents of children with DS evidenced\ncharacteristics such as socialization, challenge, and enjoy-\nment. This result agrees with research on this issue.\nSocialization features derive from social opportunities in\nsport including cooperating with others, respecting rules,\nmastering new skills suitable for everyday life, experiencing\npersonal achievement, and obtaining the encouragement of\nother people with the same disorder (Battaglia et al., 2013).\nPA is also judged enjoyable because of the opportunity to\nexperiment leisure experiences and execute lovely and excit-\ning exercises with music and games (Mahy et al., 2011).\nNevertheless, the nature of sport allows to develop indepen-\ndence skills by facing challenging tasks and experimenting\nthe sense of competence and self-empowerment (Badia et al.,\nThe parents of TDC introduced in this category two new\ncharacteristics such as having successful experiences and par-\nticipating in agonistic activities. This last result is explained\nas the product of stereotypes widely spread in Western societ-\nies which associate sport and values such as success, power,\ncompetition, and the importance of winning.\nAll our interviewed parents stated the physical and psy-\nchological benefits of PA. For the parents of children with\nDS, physical benefits were the prevention or the control of\nmedical diseases such as obesity and motor coordination\nimpairments. Specifically, the control of the obesity was con-\nsidered the main benefit. It is now largely recognized how\nhigh levels of overweight and obesity among people with\nintellectual disability are closely associated to higher level of\ninactivity and unhealthy dietary practices (Battaglia et al.,\n2013). So, PA was acknowledged by parents as a worthy\nweight control intervention as an alternative to medicine ther-\napies (Slevin, Truesdale-Kennedy, McConkey, Livingstone,\nFor the parents of TDC, physical benefits were more gen-\neralized. They not only included the prevention of over-\nweight, but they also take account of other factors such as the\nprevention of diabetes and the decreasing of insomnia. On\nthe whole, the great importance attributed by all parents to\nPA in the control of overweight confirms the awareness of\nthe crucial role of family in the weight management by con-\ntrolling the quantity and the quality of food, making the rules\non food and meals, and outlining a healthy home environ-\nment (Prussing, Sobo, Walker, & Kurtin, 2005).\nPsychological benefits concerned for all parents the\nincrease of self-esteem and self-image, as well as the\nimprovement of cognitive functions such as memory and\nattention. The main difference between the two groups was\nthat the parents of children with DS attribute more impor-\ntance to motivational benefits rather than cognitive improve-\nments. In recent years, researchers have shown how regular\n6 SAGE Open\nPA is useful to face the fear of humiliation, the low athletic\nself-perception, and low self-efficacy because it allows self-\nevaluation by comparing oneself performance with others on\na variety of physical and motor tasks (Alesi & Pepi, 2013;\nMoreover, parents of TDC stated positive effects of PA on\nmemory and attention. This is consistent with results from\nstudies using magnetic imaging techniques (functional mag-\nnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) which demonstrated how\nregular aerobic exercises modifie the brain function in the\nanterior cingulate cortex withimprovements in cognitive per-\nformances such as speed of processing, working memory,\nplanning and control strategy employ (Alesi, Bianco, et al.,\nOn the whole, the current findings are added to a grow-\ning body of literature on the parental beliefs of PA as a key\nfactor to contribute to well-being of their children. It is\nwidely accepted by researchers and practitioners that a sed-\nentary lifestyle is an important risk factor able to exacer-\nbate medical diseases and enhance welfare assistance and\nuse of medical services. So, high economic health costs are\nthe consequence.\nThe main shortcoming of this study is the age range of the\nchildren which is widely disparate, with young adults\nincluded in the group of people with DS, and only children\nyounger than teen age years in the TDC group. However, this\nmay be the strength of this study as the results within each\ngroup are homogeneous. What parents think about PA may\nnot be influenced by the age of their children but by their\ndevelopmental age and disability. All parents recognized the\nphysical and psychological benefits associated with chil-\ndren's participation in PA. However, the primary benefits\nidentified by the parents of children with DS concerned\nphysical themes as reducing obesity or improving motor\ncoordination as well as psychological gains like increasing\nself-esteem, self-image, and socialization skills. These par-\nents wished for APA intervention programs that better met\ntheir children's needs and encouraged their participation. On\nthe contrary, the parents of children with TDC stated other\nbenefits as decreasing the insomnia or increasing memory\nand attention. So the findings of this study, although prelimi-\nnary, suggest some interesting implications on the educa-\ntional field for future practice. First, it is crucial to organize\nsettings aimed at encouraging the sport participation in typi-\ncal and atypical population. Second, it would be decisive to\ndevelop specially designed programs and training aimed at\nincreasing participation in PA involving both children with\nDS and their parents.\n"
