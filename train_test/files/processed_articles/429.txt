However, in Black women reduction in risk of\nprehypertension could be possible by instituting public\nhealth measures to reduce abdominal obesity to the\nlevels seen in White women. Intervention programmes\ndesigned to reduce overall obesity may also lead to\nreduction of abdominal obesity, and consequently may\ncurb prehypertension in these population groups.

Among its recommendations was\nthe use of abdominal obesity as an important factor\nfor identifying increased relative risk for obesity\ncomorbidities.1 In 2003, the Joint National Commit-\ntee (JNC-7) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,\nCorrespondence: Dr IS Okosun, Institute of Public Health, Georgia\nE-mail: iokosun@gsu.edu\nwww.nature.com/jhh\nand Treatment of High Blood Pressure in their\nseventh report defined a new guideline for hyper-\ntension prevention and management.2 JNC-7 defined\na new category of abnormal blood pressure, pre-\nhypertension. According to JNC-7, patients with\nprehypertension are at increased risk for advance-\nment to hypertension. The NIH expert panels\nrecognize abdominal obesity as a major cardiovas-\ncular risk factor, while the JNC-7 committees\nrecognize the need for early identification of\nsubjects with abnormal blood pressure values that\nare likely to lead to hypertension.\nIncreased abdominal obesity is associated with\nmany diseases, including type II diabetes,3,4 hyper-\ntension5,6 and cardiovascular disease mortality.7\u00ad9\nAbdominal obesity is also highly correlated with\nimpairment of body homeostasis characterized by\nabnormalities such as hyperinsulinaemia, glucose\nintolerance and dyslipidaemias (hypertriglyceridae-\nmia, high levels of low-density lipoprotein and low\nlevels of high-density cholesterol).10\u00ad15 Abdominal\nobesity, defined as waist circumference value of\nwomen is associated with increased relative risk for\nobesity comorbidities for most adults.1 Proposed\noriginally by Lean et al16 and Han et al,17 these waist\ncircumference cut points were proposed for health\npromotion to give optimal enrichment to indivi-\nduals in need of weight management because of\noverweight/obesity or central obesity.\nJNC-7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood\nAccording to JNC-7, patients with prehypertension\nare at increased risk for advancement to hyper-\ntension.2 These prehypertension subjects should be\nconsidered for health-promoting lifestyles to pre-\nvent cardiovascular diseases.2 Thus, the classifica-\ntion of prehypertension by JNC 7 underscores\nthe need for public education to decrease blood\npressure levels and avert the development of\nhypertension.\nMany studies investigating the association be-\ntween adiposity and blood pressure are often\nrestricted to conceptual frameworks where\nabnormal blood pressures are defined using systolic\nblood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater and diastolic\nknowledge, the association between abdominal\nobesity and prehypertension among and between\nvarious US racial/ethnic groups has not\nbeen investigated. The objective of this investi-\ngation was therefore to estimate the risk and\nattributable risk of prehypertension that is due to\nabdominal obesity in White, Black and Hispanic\nAmerican adults. We also sought to determine how\nmuch of the relative difference in the risk of\nprehypertension between high-risk groups (Blacks\nand Hispanics) and the low-risk group (Whites)\ncould be explained by their differences in abdom-\ninal obesity.\nMethods\nData source\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) as\nprovided by National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) were used in this study. These datasets were\nfrom cross-sectional surveys that were carried out\namong noninstitutionalized US civilian popula-\ntions. Descriptions of the plan and operation of\nthese surveys have been described by other inves-\nmost recent of the health examination surveys\nstratified multistage probability sample based on\nselection of counties, blocks, households, and\npersons within households. About 9965 persons\nused to obtain blood pressure was based on the latest\nrecommendations of the American Heart Association.24\nThree and sometimes four blood pressure measure-\nments were taken on all eligible individuals using a\nmercury sphygmomanometer. Participants who are 50\nyears and older who were unable to travel to the\nmobile examination units were offered an abbreviated\nexamination in their homes.25 Waist measurements\nwere made at the natural waist midpoint between the\nlowest aspect of the rib cage and highest point of the\niliac crest, and to the nearest 0.1cm.\nOnly adults who were identified as non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Americans\nbetween 18 and 79 years old were included in this\ninvestigation. This study was also restricted to\nsubjects who were measured for waist circumfer-\nences and blood pressures. Women who were\npregnant at the time of the surveys were excluded\nfrom this analysis. In terms of variables we did not\nconsider for our analysis, those who were excluded\ndue to missing variables of interest were not different\nfrom the population examined in our study.\nDefinition of terms\nAbdominal obesity was defined as waist circumfer-\nrespectively.1 Prehypertension was defined as not\nbeing on antihypertensive medication and having\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical programs available in SAS for Windows26\nand SUDAAN27 were utilized for this analysis.\nTo account for unequal probabilities of selection,\noversampling, and nonresponse, appropriate sample\nweights were utilized for the analyses.

Sex and\nrace/ethnic-specific association between abdominal\nobesity and prehypertension was determined using\nodds ratios from the logistic regression analysis. In\nthe regression models, statistical adjustments were\nmade for age, blood glucose, total cholesterol,\nexercise and current smoking, Prevalences of ab-\ndominal obesity and prehypertension were age-\nadjusted by direct methods using the 2000 US\npopulation census data.\nPublic health consequences of abdominal obesity\nfor prehypertension were quantified using popula-\ntion attributable risk (PAR) expressed in percentage.\nThe population attributable risk was estimated as29\nPE\nwhere PE\nis the prevalence of abdominal obesity and\nOR is the odd ratio comparing individuals with\nabdominal obesity with those who were not abdom-\ninally obese. PAR, also called population attributa-\nble risk, is defined as the proportion of a\npopulation's disease rate that would not occur if\nthe risk factor(s) of interests had been absent.29\nTo estimate the fraction of White to non-White\ndifferences in rate of prehypertension that was due to\ntheir relative differences in the prevalence of abdom-\ninal obesity, we estimated relative attributable risk in\npercentage (RAR). RAR is defined as the proportion\nof the excess disease rate in the high-risk population\nthat would disappear if the high-risk population had\nthe same prevalence of risk factor(s) as the low-risk\npopulation.30 RAR is based on the assumption that\nthe association between abdominal obesity and\nprehypertension is causal. RAR was estimated as:31,32\n\u00bc\nwhere PH and PL denote the prevalence on pre-\nhypertension in high-risk (Blacks and Hispanics) and\nlow-risk group (Whites), respectively. PLH is the rate\nof prehypertension in the high-risk group if the\ndistribution of abdominal obesity is identical to that\nlow-risk group. R \u00bc PL/PH denotes the rate ratio of\nprehypertension rates of the two groups.31,32 Assum-\ning the relation between prehypertension and ab-\ndominal obesity was homogenous across groups,\nPLH/PH was estimated as follows:33\nPLH\nPH\n\u00bc\nPH\nX\nK\nwi\n\u00bc\nPH\nX\nK\nwi\n\u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 PARH\u00de\nX\nK\nwi\nwhere PARH is the population attributable risk due\nto prehypertension in the non-Whites, PHi\nand Wi\ndenote rates of prehypertension in the ith abdominal\nobesity category among non-Whites and abdominal\nobesity prevalence of the ith category in Whites,\nrespectively (i \u00bc 0, y, K; i \u00bc 0 refers to the reference\ncategory). Hence, by substituting Eq. (3) into Eq.

Hence, in this study, we took\nto describe the association between abdominal\nobesity and prehypertension in White, Black and\nHispanic American adults.\nIn epidemiological studies of hypertension, much\nattention are focused on estimating population\nattributable risks and odds ratio of potential risk\nfactors of abnormal blood pressures.6,34\u00ad36 Relatively\nlittle attentions are paid to the important question\nof: how much of the relative differences in the\nprevalence of abnormal blood pressures between\ntwo populations is explained by the differences in\npattern of exposure to a particular risk factor? Hence\nin this investigation we estimated the fraction of\nWhite to non-White differences in risk of prehyper-\ntension that was due to White to non-White\ndifferences in rates of abdominal obesity.\nThis is the first investigation to use the new\ncategory of prehypertension as defined by the\nJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detec-\ntion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood\nPressure in their seventh report.2 The use of the\navailable data for this analysis because of its\nrepresentativeness and national in scope. The\ntraining programme and quality control measures\ninstituted in the surveys give an added reliability\nto the data.\nThe main finding from this investigation is that\nabdominal obesity is associated with increased risk\nof prehypertension in American men and women. In\nthis study, abdominal obesity was associated with\nincreased risk of prehypertension in Whites, Blacks\nand Hispanics, independent of age, blood glucose,\ntotal cholesterol, exercise and current smoking.\nProportions of risk of prehypertension explained\nWhite, Black and Hispanic men, respectively. The\n32.5%. These attributable values indicate that\nprehypertension could have been avoided if abdom-\ninal obesity was absent in both men and women of\nthe three ethnic groups.\nThe data further indicated gender differences in\nthe response of abdominal obesity for prehyperten-\nsion. In men, abdominal obesity accounted B7% of\nethnic differences on the risk of developing\nprehypertension between Whites and Blacks, and\nbetween Whites and Hispanics. The positive values\nfor relative attributable risks in Black men, Hispa-\nnic men and Hispanic women despite having lower\nrates of abdominal obesity than their White\ncounterparts may indicate that other factors may\nhave important explanatory power for racial differ-\nences in prehypertension in these groups than\nracial/ethnic differences on the risk of developing\nprehypertension between Whites and Blacks, and\nbetween Whites and Hispanics were due to their\nrelative differences in rates of abdominal obesity.\nThus, if Black and Hispanic women had the same\nprevalence of abdominal obesity as the rates that\nwere observed in White women, the risk of\nprehypertension would be reduced by B40 and\nSome limitations must be taken into account in\nthe interpretation of results from this study. First,\nbias due to survey nonresponse and missing values\nfor some variables cannot be ruled out. However,\nprevious studies based on data from National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys have\nshown little bias due to survey nonresponse.36\nSecond, as a cross-section study, directionality of\nthe associations cannot be clearly established.\nThird, several well-known hypertension risk fac-\nTable 2 Association between abdominal obesity and prehyper-\ntension in US men and women\nWhite Black Hispanic\nMen\nAbdominal\nobesity\nGlucose\n(mg/dl)\nTotal\ncholesterol\n(mg/dl)\nWomen\nAbdominal\nobesity\nGlucose\n(mg/dl)\nTotal\ncholesterol\n(mg/dl)\nOR, odds ratio from the logistic regression model.\nTable 3 Population and relative attributable risk of abdominal\nobesity for prehypertension in US men and women\nWhite Black Hispanic P-value\nMen\nRelative attributable risk (%) -- 6.5 6.9\nWomen\nP-value is a test of abdominal obesity response for prehypertension\nacross racial/ethnic groups.\nAbdominal obesity and prehypertension\nIS Okosun et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\ntors were not examined. These unmeasured risk\nfactors may have significant implications on\nmagnitude of the observed association between\nabdominal obesity and prehypertension in the\ndifferent ethnic groups. Fourth, our analysis was\nbased on one time blood pressure measurements,\ncompared to the recommendations of JNC 7, which\nprovides that blood pressure measurements be\nbased on the mean of two or more properly\nmeasured seated readings on each of two or more\noffice visits.2 The implication of these differences\non the risk of prehypertension needs further\ninvestigation.\nFinally, as an observational study, caution must be\nused regarding the interpretation of population and\nrelative attributable risks. For pedagogic reasons,\nthese concepts are used in this manuscript to imply\nthat the elimination of abdominal obesity would\nlead to a measured decrease in prehypertension.\nThis assertion supposes that abdominal obesity\ncauses prehypertension. Unfortunately, the only\nway to be sure that a cause\u00adeffect relationship exists\nbetween abdominal obesity and prehypertension is\nby system intervention to eliminate abdominal\nobesity. In absence of such evidence, a cautious\ninterpretation of attributable risk is necessary. In this\nmanuscript, attributable risk was used to describe\nthe proportion of prehypertension explained by\nabdominal obesity in a limited sense of statistical\nassociation.\nConclusion\nThe result of this analysis discloses the independent\nrole of abdominal adiposity in prehypertension. We\nhave shown that a decrease in prehypertension\nincidences is possible by developing public health\nstrategies designed to reduce abdominal obesity in\nthe ethnic groups that were examined. Among Black\nand Hispanic women, we have also shown that a\nreduction in risk of developing risk of prehyperten-\nsion could be possible by instituting public health\nmeasures to reduce rates of abdominal obesity even\nto the levels seen in White women. Finally, inter-\nvention programmes designed to reduce overall\nobesity through life-style modifications including\nexercise and diet may have public health conse-\nquences in reducing the incidence of prehyperten-\nsion in these populations. The positive association\nbetween abdominal obesity and prehypertension in\nthese at-risk-populations provides a compelling\nreason for initiating an early race/ethnic and\ngender-specific public health obesity intervention\nin the United States.\n"
