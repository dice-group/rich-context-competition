Limitations in our knowledge of\nvariations in needs and treatment standards for substance use and psychiatric\nillnesses make such disorders an easy targetfor management. Costs for behav-\nioral health care services have been reduced ata faster pace than has been the\ncase for general medical care costs. The most severely ill face the potential\nburdens of managed care as access and intensity of care become more uniform\nacross patient populations.\nIt i s co mmo nly as s erted tha t the organizational ap-\nproaches and strategies of managed behavioral health care (in-\nvolving capitated payment and utilization management) will al-\nlow wiser and more efficient use of resources, thereby facilitating\nparity with general medical care.1 Such optimism derives from the\nlarge reductions in costs that managed behavioral health care has\nachieved for public and private employers. In addition, studies of\nparticular employer health plans under behavioral health care carve-\nouts suggest that parity can be achieved with small additional yearly\npremiums if the structures and strategies for management are in\nplace. The passage of the Mental Health Parity Act in 1996 can be\nattributed in part to research evidence showing that management\nstrategies could contain costs, even while benefits were expanded.\nThis paper addresses a number of issues that are fundamental to\nparity but that have not typically been central to discussions of\nmanaged care's impact on spending. First, we examine national\ntrends in behavioral health care spending as a proportion of all\nhealth spending. We ask whether there are attributes of mental\nhealth practice that have made it an easier target for cost reduction\nthan are other areas of health care. Second, because reductions in\ncosts do not necessarily imply poor care, we make some effort to\nlook into the \"black box\" of managed care and inquire whether the\nresults of care management strategies appear to be rational. The data\nare inadequate for answering such questions definitively, but they\nprovide cautionary guides for future monitoring efforts. Third, we\nfocus on the clients with the most serious illnesses and greatest\ndisabilities, and we consider the consequences of managed care for\nachieving parity for these groups. We examine evidence that man-\naged care strategies \"democratize\" the provision of services and thus\nreduce the intensity of care for the sickest patients.\nWe argue that the concept of parity, as typically applied, remains\nlimited. As ordinarily used, parity refers to maintaining the same\nannual and lifetime benefits, coinsurance arrangements, and limits\non hospital days and visits that apply to general medical conditions.\nEven this ambitious goal is narrow because it fails to account for the\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nM e n t a l H e a l t h P a r i t y\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

More-\nover, the implementation of parity depends on being able to ensure\naccess to appropriate care of high quality. Management strategies\nmay enable or inhibit such implementation.\nManaged Behavioral Health Care And Spending\nA recent study comparing national spending for alcohol, drug, and\nthat average annual growth of such expenditures was 7.2 percent,\ncompared with 8.3 percent for overall personal health care.2 Find-\nings from studies of health spending by employers are consistent\nwith this national trend. The Hay Group estimated that behavioral\nhealth benefits, as a proportion of total employer health care costs,\nshould be interpreted cautiously, because we know very little about\nthe representativeness of this convenience sample. Jeffrey Buck and\nBeth Umland, using a convenience-panel survey of large employers\ncollected by Foster Higgins, similarly report that ADM costs fell\nfrom 9 percent of all health costs in 1989 to approximately 4 percent\nin 1995.4 They also report that ADM spending among employers\nwith 500 or more employees declined from about 6 percent of health\nThese studies have limitations, but they plausibly suggest that\nspending for behavioral health care is falling behind other areas.\nGiven the consistent body of research that documents large un-\ntreated ADM conditions in the general population, clinical studies\nthat repeatedly document minimal and inadequate treatment, and\nthe pattern of discrimination against and stigmatization of persons\nwith ADM problems, behavioral health spending's failure to keep\npace with health spending overall requires continuing scrutiny.5\nA case can be made that the slower growth of behavioral health\ncare spending is a correction of a pattern of indiscriminate growth in\nthe early 1980s. Saul Feldman, chief executive officer of a behavioral\nhealth care company, reports that by the mid-1980s the proportion\nof total health care costs attributable to behavioral health care in\nlarge companies climbed to 15\u00ad18 percent or even more but has now\nstabilized at below 10 percent.6 He reports that the introduction of\nmanaged care strategies achieved savings of 30\u00ad40 percent or more\nin the first few years; this is generally consistent with the literature.7\nHowever, many large companies that became clients of behavioral\nhealth care companies were motivated to do so by very high, and\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In part, these in-\ncreases were catching up with unmet need, improved treatment,\nand reduced stigma associated with seeking such care. But they also\nreflected the opportunistic behavior of specialty providers that\ncould offer services to the level of enriched insurance coverage.\nThus, in the early period of managed care it appeared relatively easy\nto bring costs down without doing harm.\nManaged care may function very differently, when expenditures\nare initially moderate or low, relative to the success stories reported\nby companies such as IBM and Xerox that have so often been re-\nported in the literature.8 Given similar levels of overall health spend-\ning, the consequences of reducing behavioral health spending from\n15 percent to 10 percent of expenditures are different from reduc-\ntions from 10 percent to 5 percent and even to 3 percent, as some\nreport. Experience also is likely to depend on the total constellation\nof strategies for dealing with employee problems, including em-\nployee assistance programs (EAPs). In many of the instances noted\nin the literature, significant savings were made by attacking \"low-\nhanging fruit,\" such as routine inpatient alcohol and other substance\nabuse treatment, long hospital stays for children and adolescents,\nand other excesses of cost-based reimbursement. By curtailing inpa-\ntient days and bargaining aggressively with providers and facilities,\nmanaged care companies initially have not faced much difficulty in\nreducing costs. Forecasts that parity could be achieved because of\nthe substantial saving possibilities inherent in managing care may\nbe based, therefore, on evidence that cannot be reliably generalized.\nA case also can be made that the reductions in growth of ADM\nspending, compared with overall personal health care spending, re-\nflected a widening gap between the benefit packages employers\noffered for mental and physical health care. There is much evidence\nof a growing deficit in benefits for ADM services over the past\ndecade. Limits in coverage for mental health care have become more\ncommon, and cost sharing has increased more substantially for men-\ntal health care than for general medical care.9 This situation was\ninadequately addressed by the Mental Health Parity Act.\nHealth care spending commonly follows new knowledge and\ntechnology, new treatment opportunities, changing patterns of ill-\nness, opportunities created by new reimbursement rules, and the\nsupply of professionals and facilities.

There is no\ninherent logic in maintaining that ADM spending needs to grow at\nthe same pace as other spending. But in light of the trends, it does\nseem prudent to inquire whether ADM care is being targeted more\nthan physical health care and, if so, what the consequences are for\nthose who require the most intensive services. Parity in benefit\nstructures means little if ADM care is managed more stringently\nthan other types of health care. We now turn to this issue.\nTargeting And The `Black Box' Of Managed Care\nADM services have been an easy target for managed care because\nthey traditionally have been based in institutions, with longer\nlengths of inpatient stay than was the case for most other medical\ncare. While lengths-of-stay also have been falling for medical and\nsurgical conditions for several years, ADM inpatient care has had a\nlonger way to fall.10 The greatest reduction in patient days continues\nto be in mental hospitals, where the aggregate number of such days\nhas fallen markedly over time.11 Even in general hospitals, length-of-\nstay among persons with primary psychiatric disorders has fallen\nsharply over the past decade. For example, average length-of-stay\namong persons with a primary psychiatric diagnosis in private, non-\nprofit general hospitals--the primary place for acute inpatient\nseverely ill patient population.12\nIndividual studies suggest that managed care may be targeting\nADM services more than other types of medical care. Thomas\nWickizer and Daniel Lessler performed a retrospective analysis of\nthe effects of utilization management on hospital use among almost\nwere rarely denied, but concurrent review of length-of-stay caused\nhospital days to plummet. Patients with mental illness were most\naffected by these utilization review strategies: While they only con-\nstituted 5.7 percent of inpatient cases that were reviewed, they ac-\ncounted for 55 percent of the gap between the total number of days\nrequested and the number of days approved. Requests for bed days\nfor patients with psychoses were allowed at no higher a rate (54.6\npercent) than were those for all mental health admissions (54 per-\ncent). In contrast, approved bed days for obstetrics, medical admis-\nsions, and surgical admissions were 93 percent, 86 percent, and 83\npercent, respectively. Average length-of-stay (adjusted for sex, age,\nand region) fell significantly for all types of admissions but espe-\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Full understanding\nof how managed care works, however, requires knowledge of the\nepidemiology of need in each population, the utilization levels that\npredate the managed care carve-out, the structure of the managed\ncare contract, and the degree of local competition among mental\nhealth facilities and providers. Such information is almost never\navailable, so we have to make inferences from ambiguous data.\nCase studies of large employment groups and state employees'\nprograms indicate that managed care carve-outs do achieve substan-\ntial savings per enrollee. However, the data suggest various explana-\ntions for the savings. For example, Ching-to Ma and Thomas\nMcGuire, in a study of a carve-out for Massachusetts state employ-\nees, found a 10 percent increase in mental health inpatient admis-\nsions and only a slight reduction (5 percent) in length-of-stay but a\nThe decline in costs for inpatient substance abuse care was similar,\nexcept that admissions decreased by 5 percent and length-of-stay\nincreased slightly. In contrast, William Goldman and colleagues, in\na study of a large West Coast employer, reported a 24 percent reduc-\ntion in inpatient admissions and a 43 percent reduction in length-of-\nstay.15 Roland Sturm and colleagues, examining the implementation\nof a managed care parity benefit among Ohio state employees, re-\nported a reduction of more than 75 percent in inpatient days.16\nIf managed care strategies are functioning properly, we anticipate\nthat large reductions in inpatient care should be accompanied by\nsizable increases in alternative services that can reasonably substi-\ntute. We observe this pattern in some studies. Goldman and col-\nleagues reported substantial increases in claims paid for outpatient\ntreatment, and more modest increases in claims paid for residential\nand day treatment, during the years following implementation of a\ncarve-out when inpatient claims were declining.17\nIn other instances, however, we see no significant substitution,\nsuggesting that the motivation is more to manage costs than to\nmanage care. Ma and McGuire, for example, found reductions in\noutpatient costs per enrollee for both mental health and substance\nabuse outpatient care (\u00ad47.9 percent and \u00ad50.8 percent, respec-\ntively).18 This cost reduction reflected declines in number of users\nand number of visits per year. Similarly, in comparing the periods\nbefore and after the carve-out, Sturm and colleagues observed sub-\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nM e n t a l H e a l t h P a r i t y\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One notable exception is Ma and McGuire's invaluable\ncase study of the Options contract in Massachusetts.20 They evalu-\nated the performance of the managed care organization relative to\nwhat might have been expected from the formal economic incen-\ntives built into the contract. They found, in this instance, that the\ncontractor continued to reduce utilization and costs well beyond\nthe target and the financial gains that would accrue. They speculate\nthat the contractor was going beyond the contract to build its mar-\nket reputation and to position itself for future competition.\nThere are indications that reductions in the intensity of care may\ngo too far. Wickizer and Lessler examined whether reduced length-\nof-stay resulting from utilization management made it more likely\nthat patients would be readmitted to the hospital within sixty\ndays.21 For every day of reduced stay, the odds of readmission within\nsixty days increased by 3.1 percent. This is not a large increase, since\nthe risk of readmission within sixty days is small. However, for\nthose with large reductions (ten or more days), the risk of readmis-\nsion within sixty days was 37 percent higher than for patients\nwhose days of care were not reduced. This is one of the few studies\nthan begins to enter the \"black box\" and alert us to possible prob-\nlems in utilization review strategies.\nIt is disconcerting when investigators observe that reductions in\nintensity of care are comparable across diagnostic groups with dif-\nferent needs. Haiden Huskamp, analyzing data from the carve-out\nfor Massachusetts state employees, found that decline in costs of\nfacility-only and outpatient episodes was much greater for patients\nwith unipolar depression than for patients with less serious disor-\nders; reductions in cost were no smaller for persons with schizo-\nphrenia and bipolar disorders than for persons with less severe dis-\norders.22 In this instance, managed care appeared to reduce intensity\nof care for the patients who we would anticipate to have the greatest\nneed. Some very disabled high users may require a high intensity of\ncare, and the \"democratization\" in the distribution of services that\nmay occur under managed care may not serve them well.\n\"The `democratization' in the distribution of services that may\noccur under managed care may not serve some patients well.\"\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The chaotic introduction of Medicaid man-\naged care by TennCare Partners in Tennessee, while not necessarily\nrepresentative of any other state, provides useful cautionary tales on\nhow not to proceed and how easy it is to do harm. A valuable case\nstudy by Cyril Chang and colleagues suggested that the process of\nimplementation not only reduced services overall but also shifted\n\"resources away from severely mentally ill individuals, for they now\nmust compete for scarce resources with enrollees who have milder\nmental health needs.\"23\nThe evaluators of the Utah managed care program found a reduc-\ntion in utilization among patients with schizophrenia who had the\nmost intensive service use prior to managed care. These seriously ill\npatients had worse outcomes with managed care.24 It is plausible\nthat within a context of many needs and constrained resources there\nis an inclination toward increased democratization of care. We need\nto understand much better how judgments on intensity of care are\nmade and the extent to which managed care is substituting forms of\ncare. Reductions across the board should be carefully audited, par-\nticularly with highly vulnerable clients and in situations where the\noverall pattern of service use is not unduly high.\nMedicaid Managed Care And Vulnerable\nPopulations\nThe Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) estimates that\nhalf of Medicaid beneficiaries will soon be under managed care ar-\nrangements.25 Initially cautious about enrolling disabled popula-\ntions in such arrangements, some states have begun to move them\ninto some type of managed care. The structure of managed behav-\nioral health care varies widely from one state to another, but careful\nstudies of individual cases are beginning to appear. These indicate\nthat managed care can reduce Medicaid costs with little evidence of\nimpaired overall quality.26\nConcepts of parity, however, require a different perspective when\napplied to Medicaid and to persons with greater disabilities. Medic-\naid has had a more comprehensive benefit structure that better re-\nsponds to long-term care problems than most private insurance and\nhas often been effectively coordinated with other public services.\nThus, usual concepts of parity appear overly narrow when applied\nto the population of persons with the most severe psychiatric ill-\nnesses. A study examining spending for persons with severe and\npersistent mental illness in Wisconsin found that more than half\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nM e n t a l H e a l t h P a r i t y\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The boundaries\ndefining the responsibilities of the managed care vendor, other pub-\nlic programs, and the general medical system need to be specifically\naddressed, and accountability needs to be well defined. Criteria for\nevaluating performance should be explicit, with appropriate ar-\nrangements made to ensure that the data required to monitor per-\nformance will be available and appropriately formatted. Excellent\nlegal work has been done to assist states in understanding their\ncontractual roles in arrangements with vendors that are typically\nmore expert in contracting than the states are.28\nThe Vacuum In Evaluating Quality\nThe history of mental health services has taught us that it is quite\neasy to reduce utilization and cost simply by administrative fiat.29\nMany localities emptied their mental hospitals but failed to provide\nthe necessary substitutive services in the community. They served\nthe mentally ill population badly and did a great deal of harm. This is\nnot to suggest that managed care practices will necessarily repeat\nthis experience. But it should make clear that reducing admissions,\nlength-of-stay, hospital days, or other services, and their associated\nexpenditures, is the easy part of the process. Doing so in a manner\nthat provides high-quality care and good outcomes is the more diffi-\ncult and more important task.\nThe importance of developing indicators of quality has been well\narticulated, and there is a consensus that measuring quality is im-\nportant.30 Moreover, we have seen substantial efforts by proprietary\ncompanies, government agencies, and other stakeholders to develop\nstandardized quality measures for behavioral health care.31 These\nefforts are relatively young, which makes it difficult to judge their\neventual utility. Early experiences, however, do provide some reason\nfor circumspection. Within the propriety sector, for example, the\nAmerican Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA)\ndevised a set of measures (Performance Measures for Managed Be-\nhavioral Healthcare Programs, or PERMS) to be used by behavioral\nhealth care companies to assess quality; indicators range from meas-\nures of access to measures of satisfaction. Results among thirteen\nmanaged care companies using these indicators ranged widely, so it\nis nearly impossible to judge whether the observed variations were\nthe result of quality differences or methodological problems.32\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Others have\nstrongly argued for the need to collect outcome indicators, in addi-\ntion to indicators of processes of care, yet it may prove difficult to\ninclude such measures in large databases.34 Despite these consider-\nable efforts, we continue to be nearly flying blind. Complaints and\nanecdotes do exist, and these may be indicative of real trouble\nspots.35 However, anecdotes are not evidence.\nThe few good outcome studies we have give us grounds for cau-\ntion. The RAND Medical Outcomes Study found that depressed\npatients were less likely to be recognized by primary care physicians\nin health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and, when identified,\nwere less likely to receive the medication continuity that fee-for-\nservice patients received and had poorer outcomes.36 Evaluations of\nmanaged care for the Medicaid populations in Minnesota and Utah,\nwhich had longer follow-up periods than most other such studies,\nsuggest that clients with the most serious illnesses, and who were\nthe most intensive users of services, were more likely to show wors-\nened outcomes.37 In one of the more comprehensive investigations of\nchanges after implementation of a prepaid plan for Medicaid en-\nrollees with schizophrenia in Utah, Michael Popkin and colleagues\nreport that the prepaid plans were associated with poorer outcomes\nin terms of patients' terminating treatment, overreliance on crisis\nintervention, poor medication management, and reduced use of\nSome of these studies are now out of date, and each refers to\ndifferent managed care arrangements. Thus, we should be careful\nnot to generalize their findings too widely or to make too much of\nthem. Managed care is a work in progress, and management strate-\ngies are presumably being improved with experience. The studies\nthemselves all have limitations. Nevertheless, they provide the cau-\ntionary guideposts that are greatly needed as we continue down the\nmanaged behavioral health care road. They raise some important\nquestions: Do some managed care practices shift costs, increase\nrisks of suicide and violence, reduce work productivity, or limit\nfunctioning and quality of life?\n\"Parity should be a configuration of management strategies fitted\nto careful assessment of patients' needs.\"\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nM e n t a l H e a l t h P a r i t y\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The uncertainties that\npersist within any kind of evidence-based framework make it rela-\ntively easy to reduce services in a shotgun fashion. The call for parity\nby advocates came within the context of indemnity insurance, but\nfew believed that this could be achieved without managing services.\nBehavioral health care management thus offers advantages in ex-\npanding the range of insured services and giving more patients ac-\ncess to a mental health service.

Parity is not simply some match in service limits to what\na medical or surgical patient experiences. It should be a configura-\ntion of management strategies fitted to careful assessment of pa-\ntients' needs and a response that is consistent with our best scien-\nA Concluding Note For The Policymaker\nThere is much rhetoric about managed behavioral health care, but\npolicymakers must appreciate the uncertainties. Most state policy-\nmakers have been wise in moving slowly and cautiously in extending\nsuch practices to their disabled populations. Most disabled persons\nenroll voluntarily in managed care, and only a few states have re-\nquired participation of severely and persistently mentally ill persons.\nManaged behavioral health care has gained much valuable experi-\nence with employed populations and in moderating some of the\nexcesses of traditional patterns of fee-for-service and cost reim-\nbursement in mental health care. But until we have (and use) more-\nsophisticated quality measurement, the temptation will remain to\nmanage costs and not care. Awareness of the mental health parity\nissues has increased in recent years, and there is growing support for\npolicies that remove discrimination against the mentally ill. A well-\nmanaged parity benefit need not be expensive, as some analyses\nhave suggested. But it is equally important to understand that any\nparity policy must be implemented through access that extends\nbeyond traditional concepts of medical necessity, particularly in\nrelation to public clients.\nManaged behavioral health care is new to the arena of disabled\nclients and their multiple needs. It is still unclear whether such\nclients will be attractive to managed care providers, given their\ncomplex needs and the financial constraints likely to be imposed by\npublic purchasers. But to the extent that such clients are attractive,\npublic purchasers take on new and important roles. First, they must\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

They need to become expert in contracting, under-\nstanding not only the elements of appropriate benefit design but\nalso the boundaries between contracted responsibilities and what\nremains of the public safety net. They also need to give attention to\npreserving the safety net, because experience indicates that it will\nstill be needed. Behavioral health care is an area in which it is rela-\ntively easy to shift costs and responsibilities to other sectors, so\nboundaries have to be clear and transparent to monitoring efforts.\nHowever inadequate the existing outcome studies are, they make it\nclear that aggregate outcomes for populations often fail to reveal the\nconsequences for small subpopulations who have the greatest needs\nand who are often the most disadvantaged and vulnerable.\nQuality measurement in behavioral health care is still relatively\nprimitive. In the long run, the accountability of managed care will\ndepend on our ability to develop a reasonable consensus on practice\nstandards and quality indicators. Work is proceeding on such devel-\nopment, but the field is not advanced enough to provide the needed\nassurance. As a start, policymakers and purchasers in both the pub-\nlic and private sectors must ensure, through their contracting, that\nthe necessary data are available to monitor access and performance\nand that such data are not simply proprietary products.\nWe are now entering a period in which the challenge of managing\ncare and reducing expenditures will become more difficult without\ndoing harm. Several elements contribute to this. First, most of the\neasy reductions have already been made, and the cost/quality trade-\noffs are tougher. Second, purchasers, having had a taste of the possi-\nble cost reductions, have learned to bargain more aggressively with\nbehavioral health care organizations. This puts greater pressure on\nthese organizations to keep utilization low. Third, consumers and\ntheir advocates have become more knowledgeable and aggressive\nand will increasingly act as a countervailing force. Fourth, the avail-\nability of new, more expensive drugs, and coalitions between phar-\nmaceutical companies and consumers to make drugs more available,\nwill contribute to increased costs. Fifth, increasing government\nregulation of managed care practices in general, and behavioral\nhealth care in particular, in response to many complaints by con-\nsumers and advocates, will make cost reductions more challenging.\nIt is too easy to blame managed care for all of the defi-\nciencies of mental health practice.

    "reduced_content": "Mission Unfulfilled:\nPotholes On The Road\nTo Mental Health Parity\nThe questforparity should be driven by the desire to provide the\nbestcare, notby indiscriminate cuttingof costs and services.\nby David Mechanic and Donna D. McAlpine\nPROLOGUE: The rapid emergence of managed behavioral health\ncare has transformed the treatment of the mentally ill in many\nways that have been documented. But there are other\ndimensions that have been less well explored. In this lead\npaper prepared by David Mechanic and Donna McAlpine of\nRutgers University, the most important (and disturbing)\nconclusion they reach is that as managed behavioral health care\nhas grown to dominate treatment of the mentally ill, an\nincreased democratization of that care has occurred. That is,\nindividuals, however ill, have tended to receive a similar level\nof treatment. This approach obviously places at greater risk\nthose patients suffering from the most serious forms of mental\nillness.\nMechanic is the Ren\u00e9 Dubos University Professor of\nBehavioral Sciences at Rutgers University. He also directs the\nuniversity's Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging\nResearch. Mechanic's research and writing focus on the social\naspects of health and health care, with a particular emphasis on\npatients' perspectives. He has been elected to membership in\nthe National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of\nArts and Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine. Mechanic has\nwritten or edited twenty-four books and some 400 research\npapers, chapters, and other publications on subjects spanning\nhealth policy and research, medical sociology, and the\nbehavioral sciences. McAlpine, who holds a master's degree in\nsociology from the University of Western Ontario, is a research\nassociate at the Rutgers institute. She is the coauthor of a\nnumber of influential papers on managed care and other topics\nin medical sociology.\n\u00a9 1999The People-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
