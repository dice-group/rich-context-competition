Inattention and HAI are considered\nwhen six or more characteristic symptoms\nhave persisted for at least 6 months, to a\ndegree that is inconsistent with developmen-\ntal level and negatively impacts directly on\nsocial and academic/occupational activities.\nADHD is assessed according to the current\nlevel of severity, as follows. Mild: Few, if any,\nsymptoms in excess of those required for a\ndiagnosis of ADHD are present, and symp-\ntoms result in no more than minor impair-\nment in social or occupational functioning.\nModerate: symptoms or functional impair-\nment between ``mild'' and ``severe'' are present.\nSevere: many symptoms in excess of those\nrequired for a diagnosis of ADHD are present,\nor several symptoms that are particularly\nsevere are present, or the symptoms result in\nmarked impairment in social or occupational\nfunctioning.1 In diagnosing ADHD, there are\nthree sub-types: ``predominantly inattentive\ntype'', ``predominantly hyperactive/impulsive\ntype'', and ``combined type'' with characteris-\ntics of the first two subtypes. The subscales of\nADHD are based on the predominating\nsymptoms in the last 6 months.2\nToday, it is widely accepted that the effects\nof mental problems experienced during child-\nhood are not only limited to the periods of\nchildhood and puberty but they continue and\ncan lead to secondary problems during\nadulthood.3 Population-based surveys have\nreported that the prevalence ADHD is about\n5% among children and 2.5% among adults\nin most cultures.4 For this reason, it is\nconsidered to be a major health problem\nowing to the considerable lifelong effects of\nADHD and related disorders.5\nADHD is characterized by behavioural\ndisorders and difficulties during childhood\nor puberty that are inappropriate for devel-\nopmental age. ADHD may manifest as\nantisocial personality disorders and may\nadversely affect social and academic life,\nsocial relationships, and communication.\nAs with any medical condition, the devel-\nopment of health strategies directed toward\nearly diagnosis and treatment of ADHD\ndepends on robust epidemiological data.1\nADHD is one of the most diagnosed\nand investigated disorders among chil-\ndren worldwide, and its prevalence has\nincreased explosively in countries through-\nout the world. The American Psychiatry\nAssociation has reported that the propor-\ntion of children diagnosed with ADHD in\nchildren; this rate increased to 8\u00ad12% in\nmented a pooled worldwide prevalence of\nstudies have pointed out, the prevalence of\nADHD ranges from as low as 1% to as high\nincrease in the prevalence of ADHD among\nschool-aged children in Turkey is similar to\nthe global trend, with current studies report-\ning am ADHD prevalence of about 13% in\nthat population.11,12 However, some studies\nhave observed oppositional defiant disorder\n(ODD), which often accompanies ADHD,\nthe development of disruptive behaviour\ndisorders (DBDs) is a controversial issue,\nthe relationship between ODD and ADHD\nmay be an indicator of the early onset of\nThe differences in the reported prevalence\nof DBDs among published epidemiological\nstudies may be the result of different meth-\nodologies used (e.g., parent-, teacher-, or child-\nbased, strict criteria, or clinical evaluation of\nimpairment), sampling differences (different\nage ranges, stratified cluster sampling, school\nsampling, clinical sampling), different scales\napplied (e.g., ICD, DSM-IV, DISC-IV, PIC-\nGAS, or CBLC), and cultural differences.16\nThe references cited in our study may also\ninclude these kinds of variations.\nThe aetiology of ADHD is not well\nunderstood. Biologic, genetic, and environ-\nmental factors have been implicated in\nthe development of the disorder. The rate of\nErcan et al.11 explained that a high preva-\nlence of ADHD in the Turkish population\nstudents) is related to migration and presence\nof the DRD4 gene. Although some studies5,8\nhave reported that ADHD is seen 2\u00ad5 times\nmore frequently in boys than in girls, recent\nstudies have argued that the disorder is\npresent equally in both sexes. Differences\nrelated to sex mostly show up in ADHD and\nother DBDs; therefore, certain symptoms\ncome to the forefront, such as HAI in boys\nand attention deficit (AD) in girls.6\nThe prevalence of ADHD also differs\naccording to age and socioeconomic status.\nSomeresearchershavestatedthatthedisorder\nis most often seen among school-age chil-\ndren18 and may potentially be more present\namongpopulationswithlowersocioeconomic\nstatus.19\u00ad22 ADHD can be well-managed with\nmedication; however, its early diagnosis is\ncritical owing not only to the behavioural,\nsocial, and psychological problems that arise\nduring childhood but also to the secondary\nproblems ADHD may cause during adult-\nhood, once the disorder has become chronic.\nIn Turkey, there have been limited com-\nprehensive, population-based studies on\nto better plan health services and implement\nstrategies for detection and early interven-\ntion, targeted epidemiologic data must be\nobtained through population-based research\non ADHD prevalence and its associated risk\nfactors in Turkey. The present study aimed to\nobtain the frequency of ADHD and other\nDBDs and to examine the relationships with\nsociodemographic factors among schoolchil-\ndren aged 7\u00ad15 years old in Kayseri.\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in\nKayseri, Turkey between February and April\napplied in the study. In the first stage, 99\nprimary schools were classified into sub-\ngroups of low, middle, and high socioeco-\nnomic level, using a randomized stratified\nsampling method and considering the socio-\neconomic level of the families of students, as\ndefined by the Ministry of National\nEducation, Provincial Directorate of Kayseri.\nIn the second stage, 7 of 21 socioecono-\nmically similar schools were included in the\nsample, with a 33% sampling rate in each\nstratum, to facilitate accessibility to the\ntarget population. The sample included\nthree schools classified as low socioeconomic\nlevel (Seyrani, _\nIstiklal, Sehit Jandarma\nKomando Er Haci Aydinci), two as middle\nsocioeconomic level (Mehmet-Cemile\nOgulcuklu, Cumhuriyet), and two schools\nclassified as high socioeconomic level (Osman\nHilmi Kalpaklioglu, Refika Kucukcalik).\nWe assumed a prevalence of ADHD in\nTurkey of about 20%, a confidence interval\nsample size was estimated at 2135 children,\nusing means of NCSS statistical software\nand PASS sample size software (NCSS,\nLLC, Kaysville, UT, USA). Using a\nfrom low socioeconomic level schools, 735\nfrom middle-level schools, and 760 from\nhigh-level schools (Figure 1).\nData collection\nThe data were collected using a questionnaire\ncomprising two parts. The first part was\nrelated to demographic characteristics of\nstudents (age, sex, and number of siblings)\nand parents (age, marital status, education\nlevel, average monthly income, employment\nstatus, and family type).\nThe second part of data collection was\ndone using the Turgay DSM-IV Disruptive\nBehavioural Disorders Rating Scale\n(T-DSM-IV-S)25, to assess symptoms of\nDBDs. The T-DSM-IV-S and demographic\ndata form were delivered by school adminis-\ntrators in a sealed envelope to the parents of\nthe randomly selected children. One week\nquestionnaires were returned. Completed\nforms were received in a sealed envelope by\nthe researchers from the school administrators.\nThe T-DSM-IV is a 4-point Likert-type\nscale based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria\nfor inattention, HAI, ODD, and CD. It\nconsists of a total 41 items, with items on the\nscale being identical to the list of symptoms\ndefined as the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD\n(AD: 9 items and HAI: 9 items), ODD\n(8 items) and CD (15 items). The T-\nDSM-IV-S was developed by Turgay25 in\nSymptoms are scored by estimating the\nseverity for each item on a 4-point Likert-\ntype scale, as follows (0 \u00bc not at all;\n1 \u00bc just a little; 2 \u00bc severe; 3 \u00bc very severe).\nFor diagnosis, ratings of severe and very\nsevere were considered positive for each\nitem. To diagnose for inattention disorder,\nthe severity of at least 6 of 9 items should be\nrated 2 or 3; and for hyperactivity/impulsiv-\nity disorder the severity of at least 6 of 9\nitems should be rated 2 or 3; and for\noppositional defiant disorder, at least 4 of\n8 items should be rated 2 or 3; and for\nconduct disorder, at least 2 of 15 items\nshould be rated 2 or 3. In all these cases,\nsymptoms should be present for 6 months to\na year. Subscale scores on the T-DSM-IV\nare calculated by summing the scores for the\nitems of each subscale.\nEthical statement\nThis study was approved by the Ministry of\nNational Education Provincial Directorate\nReview Board of Kayseri.\nN %\nFigure 1. Distribution of the sample group according to grade level.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analysed using the IBM SPSS\nversion 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY\nUSA) statistical software. Total scores\nand subscale scores were calculated for the\nT-DSM-IV-S. The quantitative variables\nwere summarized as mean \u00c6 standard devi-\nation. Scores obtained from the scale were\ncategorized as having symptoms of ADHD\nor other DBDs or not having symptoms of\nthese disorders. The chi-square (2) test was\nused for categorical variables to examine\nassociations between DBD symptoms and\nsociodemographic characteristics (age, sex,\nmarital status, monthly income, occupation,\neducation level, family type) of the children\nand their families. Independent groups were\ncompared using the Student's t-test and one-\nway analysis of variance (ANOVA). The\nresults were assessed using a 95% CI and a\nsignificance level of p < 0.05.\nResults\nSociodemographic characteristics\ngirls and 47.2% were boys, a well-balanced\nsex distribution of study participants.

Thus, this study is\nimportant owing to its use of parent-based\nestimates to determine the prevalence of\ncommonly observed ADHD and other\nDBD symptoms among Turkish primary\nschool children.\nThe prevalence of ADHD was 6.2% in\nour study. The most common comorbid\ndisorders were CD (14.4%) followed by\nODD (6.7%). The rate of detected DBD\nsymptoms in this study (27.4%) was lower\nthan those reported in Chile (38.3%), Hong\nKong (38.4%), and the city of _\nIzmir in\nprevalence found in this work was higher\nthan that reported by Canino et al.28 from\nPuerto Rico (19.8%). Differences in the\nreported prevalence of DBD symptoms in\nepidemiological studies may be the result of\ndifferent information sources (e.g., parent or\nteacher-based, strict criteria), differences in\nsampling methods (stratified cluster sam-\npling, school sampling, clinical evaluation)\nand different scales applied (e.g., ICD-10,\nIn our study, the ADHD prevalence rate\n(6.2%) was similar to the pooled worldwide\nadolescents.9,4 At the same time, our find-\nings are consistent with previous studies24,29\nconducted among elementary school chil-\ndren using parent based-estimates, which\nhave reported ADHD prevalence between\n2.7% and 9.6%.

In recent studies, ADHD\nsymptoms have been suggested to be 2\u00ad5\ntimes more prevalent in boys than in girls34\nand the predominantly inattentive subtype\nof ADHD has been shown to be significantly\nLikewise, our study found that some sub-\nscale scores and overall mean scores were\nsignificantly higher in boys, children whose\nparents were illiterate, those whose mothers\nwere homemakers, children whose fathers\nwere manual labourers, and those whose\nfamily had lower monthly incomes.\nIn our study, the sex ratio for ADHD and\nother disorders (ODD and CD) ranged from\nis 9:1 in clinical sampling, it increases to\n4:1 in population screenings. For the pre-\ndominantly hyperactive/impulsive subtype,\nthe sex ratio is 4:1; however, in the pre-\ndominantly inattentive subtype, this ratio\ndecreases to 2:1. In other words, girls are\nmore vulnerable to the predominantly\ninattentive subtype of ADHD.39 In a study\nby Toros and Tataroglu38 in Turkey, the\nanother study among 219 primary school\nchildren diagnosed with AD, this ratio was\nstudy by Aktepe et al.8 of 763 children aged\n7\u00ad12 years who were admitted to the\nPsychiatry Clinic of Suleyman Demirel\nUniversity Faculty of Medicine, the most\nfrequently diagnosed disorder in boys was\nADHD (15.8%) whereas females were diag-\nnosed with ADHD at a rate of 5.2%. In\nence between male and female ratios of\nADHD decreased significantly in our study.\nUnlike those reports, in another study of 401\nchildren diagnosed with ADHD, whereas\nthere was no significant difference by sex in\nthe combined type (coexisting AD and HAI),\nthe predominantly hyperactive subtype was\nmore prevalent among boys and the predom-\ninantly inattentive subtype was more preva-\nConsequently, it is clear that DBD symp-\ntoms are more prevalent in boys than in girls\nwhen the symptom distributions and sub-\ntypes are taken into consideration. However,\nthis prevalence rate must be further investi-\ngated to prove it is in fact more dominant in\none sex. The tendency of these disorders to\nmanifest in the form of attention deficit and\ncognitive difficulties in females owing to\nbiological characteristics may lead to DBDs\nbeing less diagnosed in females. For instance,\nsimple signs like having less motivation or\nspending less time studying may be con-\nsidered the reason for poor academic per-\nformance; thus, it may be possible to miss the\nmore serious underlying reasons behind such\nchanges; because the problem is attributed to\nother causes, no treatment-seeking behaviour\ntakes place. Male children are reported to\nhave a greater tendency for extrinsic prob-\nlems owing to their biological and genetic\ncharacteristics. They are also shown greater\ntolerance by those around them for these\nproblems, which in turn results in such\nbehavioural problems becoming more\nThe presence of AD and poor cognitive\nabilities in boys owing to problems such as\nCD, impulsivity, hyperactivity, and intra-\nand extra-familial social problems related to\nthese (e.g., quarrels, arguments, and causing\naccidents) means that boys get more atten-\ntion and more effort is made to seek a\nsolution. This in turn decreases the likeli-\nhood of overlooking the disorder in boys.\nIt is obvious that ADHD is more prevalent\nin boys than in girls. Nevertheless, it should\nbe borne in mind that the sex ratio differ-\nence, as stated in our study and in other\nstudies, may be lower in reality. The fact\nthat many studies base their assessments on\ndiagnostic criteria decreases the significance\nof these stated justifications; however, our\napproach may still be significant. This is\nowing to certain symptoms being given more\nconsideration than others because the\nassessment of individuals is based on assess-\nment by their families.\nIn our study, the prevalence and severity\nof HAI was found to be significantly higher\namong boys, children aged 7\u00ad12 years, those\nwhose parents were illiterate, children whose\nmothers were homemakers, and those from\nlow-income families, consistent with previ-\nthe degree of communication between chil-\ndren and mothers with higher education\nlevels is usually such that mothers can spot\nany unfavourable changes in their children\nearlier, and they will ask for professional help\nwhen necessary. Because mothers with higher\neducation levels can more easily recognise\nbehavioural changes in their children and will\nseek treatment at an early stage, and because\nthey are more deeply involved in their chil-\ndren's education, they can more easily dis-\ncourage any unfavourable attitudes and\nbehaviours observed in their children.\nSimilarly, we found the prevalence and\nseverity of ODD to be significantly higher\nin boys and in children whose mothers were\nhomemakers, from low-income families,\nand whose fathers were illiterate. Because\nhomemakers have a more intense and pro-\nlonged relationship with their children than\nmothers who work outside the home, there\nmay be more opportunities for mothers and\ntheir children to disagree; thus, ODD may\nbe observed more intensely in children, as a\nreaction to such conflict.\nIn our study, the prevalence and severity\nof CD was found to be significantly higher in\nboys, in children aged 13\u00ad15 years, and in\nthose whose mothers are homemakers and\nfrom low-income families (p < 0.01). C\n\u00b8 ak\net al.45 stated in their study that there is a\nrelationship between being from a family\nwith high socioeconomic status and fewer\ndiagnoses of AD and HAI disorders. Based\non the traditional knowledge that unfavour-\nable family and environmental factors have\na significant role in causing, triggering, and\nthe prognosis of mental problems, the prog-\nnosis in children with ADHD is expected to\nbe adversely affected by conditions such as\nsevere marital problems, lower social class,\nextended family structure, fathers with a\ngreater inclination toward criminality,\nmaternal history of a mental disorder, and\nbeing in foster care, all of which are con-\nsidered family and environmental factors.46\nDespite some limitations in this research,\nours is one of the few studies evaluating\nADHD, ODD, and CD together in school-\nage children. In addition, this population-\nbased study also examined the association\nbetween sociodemographic factors and\nDBD symptoms.\nConclusion\nThe prevalence of ADHD and other\nDBD symptoms was 27.4% in our study.\nThe most prevalent disorder was CD.\nThe detected DBD symptoms were closely\nassociated with children's age and sex, as\nwell as parental education level, occupation,\nmonthly income, and family structure.\nADHD and other DBDs were more preva-\nlent among boys and children from less\neducated, low-income families compared\nwith their peers. In terms of exposure, boys\nwere found to be more vulnerable to DBDs.\nThe awareness of parents and treatment-\nseeking behaviour are highly valuable for\nearly diagnosis and appropriate treatment of\nthese disorders.\nLimitations of the study\nThe main limitation of our study is that the\nchildren were not actually examined diag-\nnosed with ADHD by a physician.\nTherefore, because the research data were\nbased on reports of family members and\nsociocultural differences exist between\nfamilies, the collected data are likely to be\nsubjective, even if only to a small degree. In\nother words, there may be differences\nbetween educated and illiterate parents in\nperceiving and interpreting the same symp-\ntoms. In this context, not having matched\nparents is a subjectivity factor.\nAnother limitation was that because of our\ndata were obtained based only on parental\nreporting, the prevalence of ADHD and other\nDBDs may have been over- or underreported,\ncompared with information gathered from\ncombined sources such as parents plus tea-\nchers or clinicians plus parents.\nInformed Consent\nAn invitation letter explaining the purpose of the\nstudy and a voluntary consent form were sent,\nalong with data collection tools, in a sealed\nenvelope to parents of the selected students.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the\nparents of children who participated in this study.\n"
