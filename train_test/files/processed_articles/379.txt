In 2006, the largest mumps outbreak in the United States in 20 years occurred. To understand\nprior mumps seroprevalence and factors associated with the presence of antibody to mumps virus, data from the\n1999\u00ad2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed.\nMethods. A mumps virus\u00adspecific enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the seroprevalence of serum\nimmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody among NHANES participants aged 6\u00ad49 years. Participants were grouped on\nthe basis of 10-year birth cohorts, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using SUDAAN software, and\nlogistic regression was used to identify independent predictors.\nethnicity/birthplace were independent predictors in at least 1 of the birth cohorts.\nConclusions. The overall estimate of 90.0% is at the lower end of the estimated population immunity (90%\u00ad\n92%) needed to achieve herd immunity.

For mumps control, high vaccine coverage and high population immunity must be achieved\nand maintained.\nMumps is an acute viral illness characterized by uni-\nlateral or bilateral parotitis preceded by nonspecific\nsymptoms, such as fever, headache, malaise, and my-\nalgia.

Mumps is\nendemic in most of the world, and many countries do\nnot include mumps vaccine in their routine childhood\nstates had included mumps vaccine in their national\nimmunization programs, most by including the com-\nbined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine [1].\nThese include a majority of industrialized nations and\ncountries undergoing economic transition [1].\nIn the United States, live mumps vaccine was licensed\n[2]. By 2000, the number of reported mumps cases in\nthe United States had declined to 338 [3]. Because this\ncases [4], the United States set a goal of mumps elim-\nported in the United States, a decline of 99.7% since\nhad been inoculated with at least 1 dose of mumps vaccine.\nThe occurrence of this outbreak led some to question the fea-\nsibility of mumps elimination and prompted us to evaluate the\nseroprevalence of antibody to mumps virus in the US popu-\nlation, specifically in those age groups most affected by the\n2006 outbreak. Data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative\nwere used to assess mumps seroprevalence.\nMETHODS\nSurvey design and participants. NHANES is conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, to provide national statistics on the\nhealth and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US\ncivilian population. Since 1999, NHANES has been a contin-\nuous survey, with data released every 2 years. The present anal-\nsampling plan for the survey is a stratified, multistage, prob-\nability-cluster design, to provide a sample that is representative\nof the US population [8]. Black Americans, Mexican Ameri-\ncans, adolescents, and low-income persons were sampled at\nhigher frequencies than were other participants, to provide sta-\nble estimates for these groups. Participants in the survey un-\ndergo household interviews and then standardized physical ex-\naminations and the collection of biological samples at special\nmobile examination centers [8].\nSerum samples from participants 6\u00ad49 years of age were\navailable for testing for the presence of immunoglobulin G\n(IgG) antibody to mumps virus. Race/ethnicity was categorized\non the basis of a participant's self-identification as non-His-\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American. Par-\nticipants who did not fit into one of these categories were\nclassified as other and were analyzed with the combined pop-\nulation but were not analyzed separately. Other variables an-\nalyzed included the following: (1) family income, based on a\npoverty-index ratio calculated by dividing total family income\nby the poverty-threshold index adjusted for family size at the\nyear of the interview and categorized as either below the poverty\nlevel or at or above the poverty level [9]; (2) birthplace, cat-\negorized as within or outside the United States; (3) health in-\nsurance, categorized as any or none; (4) regular source of health\ncare, defined as having 1 or more sources of health care; (5)\neducation, based on individual education for those aged 20\u00ad\n49 years and education of head of household for those aged\n6\u00ad19 years, measured as last year of school completed and\ncategorized into 2 levels (less than or equal to high school\ngraduate or more than a high school education); and (6) crowd-\ning index, derived from household size and number of rooms\nin the household (not including bathrooms), calculated as the\nnumber of persons per room (PPR), and categorized as !0.5,\nall participants, and the Ethical Review Board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, approved the protocol.\nLaboratory testing. A commercially available indirect en-\nzyme-linked immunosorbant IgG assay (Mumps IgG ELISA II;\nWampole Laboratories) was used for the detection and quali-\ntative determination of IgG antibody to mumps virus in serum\nspecimens. As reported by the manufacturer, the relative sen-\nsitivity of this test is 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI],\nvirus, based on index standard ratio (ISR) values, were as fol-\nlows: seronegative, ISR of 0.90; indeterminate, ISR of 0.91\u00ad\nnegative or indeterminate results for mumps virus IgG were\nretested with an equal number of randomly selected positive\nserum samples. If retested samples had positive results, they\nwere reported as IgG seropositive. Serum samples testing either\nnegative or indeterminate were considered negative for pur-\nposes of this study. For quality assurance purposes, a 10%\nrandom-sample repeat of the entire specimen collection set was\nperformed.\nStatistical analysis. Participants were grouped into 10-year\nbirth cohorts based on the age groups that were affected during\nthe 2006 mumps outbreak, to assess the seroprevalence of an-\ntibody to mumps virus, to identify differences in mumps an-\ntibody seroprevalence that might have occurred in correlation\nto changes in vaccination policies, and to ensure that there was\na sufficient sample size for each group. The birth cohorts were\nEstimates of seroprevalence were weighted to represent the total\ncivilian noninstitutionalized US household population and to\naccount for oversampling and nonresponse to the household\ninterview and physical examination [10].

Because of the strong\nassociation between place of birth and mumps seroprevalence,\nthe variables race/ethnicity and birthplace were combined (race/\nethnicity/birthplace) in the modeling procedures and grouped\nas follows: US-born non-Hispanic whites, US-born non-His-\npanic blacks, US-born Mexican Americans, and non\u00adUS-born\nMexican Americans. In addition, because of the small numbers\nof foreign-born non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks\nin the sample, these subgroups were not included in the mod-\neling procedure.

The lower seroprevalence for this birth cohort might reflect\nchanges in the epidemiology of mumps in the United States\nand changes in US mumps vaccination policy and practice. In\n1967, when live mumps vaccine was first licensed, the Advisory\nCommittee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended\nthat the vaccine be considered for use in children approaching\npuberty, in adolescents, and in adults, especially men [22]. In\n1968, the recommendations were expanded to consider im-\nmunizing all susceptible children 11 year of age, but mumps\nvaccine was not introduced into the routine immunization\nlicensed MMR vaccine; 6 years later, in 1977, the ACIP rec-\nommended routine immunization with MMR vaccine [2] at\nolder schoolchildren, students on college campuses, and young\nadults were most affected [24].

In addition, this cohort was born too early to receive the\nsecond dose of vaccine at school entry (as recommended in\n1989) and less likely to have been affected by the school im-\nmunization laws [22, 27].
