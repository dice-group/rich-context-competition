Male and female participants were recruited from university psychology courses\nand administered the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), Mental Health Inventory, Eating Self-Efficacy Scale, Revised\nRestraint Scale, and Eating Disorder Inventory. Results confirmed the multidimensionality of excessive exercise for both\nmales and females. Profiles of male and female exercisers were developed based on the clustering of scores on the OEQ's\nfactor analytically derived subscales. Specific qualitative aspects of exercise (e.g., emotionality and obsession), rather than\nthe quantity of exercise, were found to be associated with eating disorder traits and, for some groups, psychological distress\n(PD). For other groups, such as female excessive exercisers, exercise seems to act as a coping mechanism, thereby lessening\nPD and enhancing well-being.\n",

Researchers\nagree that excessive exercise encompasses both quantitative\nand qualitative aspects. In fact, a number of assessment tools\nsuch as the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ;\nThompson & Pasman, 1991) and the Compulsive Exercise\nTest (CET; Taranis, Touyz, & Meyer, 2011) acknowledge\nthe multidimensional nature of excessive exercise with ques-\ntions targeting both its quantitative and emotional aspects.\nWhile there may be an emerging consensus on the multi-\ndimensionality of excessive exercise, there have been several\ndifferent definitions and labels assigned to this construct.\nExcessive exercise has been described as obligatory exercise\n(Pasman & Thompson, 1988), compulsive exercise (Yates,\n1991), exercise dependence (Ogden, Veale, & Summers,\nand dysfunctional exercise (Calogero & Pedrotty-Stump,\n2010). Since a universal definition and underlying cause\nhave not yet been determined, the more general term exces-\nsive exercise will be used in this article whenever possible.\nThe multidimensionality of excessive exercise has been\nreaffirmed in numerous studies (Hausenblas & Downs, 2002;\nMeyer, Taranis, Goodwin, & Haycraft, 2011). In their review,\nHausenblas and Downs (2002) suggested that excessive\nexercise (termed exercise dependence by the authors) be\ndefined as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exer-\ncise manifested by three or more of the following: tolerance\nto higher levels of exercise, withdrawal symptoms, intention\neffects (more exercise than was intended), loss of control,\ntime, conflict with other activities, and continuance despite\nphysical or psychological problems related to the exercise.\nAn evidence-based model developed by Meyer and col-\nleagues (Meyer et al., 2011) suggested that the definition of\nsuch exercise should refer to (a) weight and shape concerns\nand (b) avoidance of negative affect and perceived negative\nconsequences of discontinuing the exercise.\nResearchers have investigated the association between\nexcessive exercise and eating disorders to understand the\nnature of their relation (Johnston et al., 2011). To date, studies\nhave demonstrated that the frequency and intensity of the exer-\ncise (i.e., the quantitative dimension) are not associated with\ndisordered eating attitudes and behaviors (Adkins & Keel,\nBrehm and Steffen\n1University of Cincinnati, OH, USA\n2University of Hawaii, Social Science Research Institute, Chicago, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBonnie J.

The results of\nsuch studies that are limited to women may not be general-\nized to men. One study that examined associations among\nexcessive exercise, eating disorder behaviors, and certain\npsychological traits in college women used cluster analysis\nof OEQ subscale scores to identify distinct profiles of exer-\ncisers, particularly a subgroup of excessive exercisers who\ndemonstrated clear links among exercise beliefs and behav-\niors, eating disorder characteristics, and psychopathology\n(Ackard et al., 2002). Using the same method of typing exer-\ncisers based on clustering OEQ scores, the aims of the pres-\nent study were (a) to determine if excessive exercise was\nrelated to eating disorder and psychological characteristics in\ncollege men, in a way similar to that found among women\nand (b) to document additional psychological characteristics\nof eating disorder\u00adlinked exercise in both men and women.\nWe surveyed participants about their attitudes and behav-\niors related to exercise and diet. In addition, we used mea-\nsuresofeatingself-efficacy,eatingrestraint,andpsychological\ndistress (PD) and well-being. It was expected that, consistent\nwith their generalized negative cognitive framework (De\nMarti, & Fischer, 2008), excessive exercisers will feel ineffi-\ncacious with regard to their ability to control their eating\nbehavior, will likely engage in substantial restraint related to\neating behaviors, will be psychologically distressed and con-\nversely low in well-being, and will exhibit disordered eating\nbehaviors and beliefs. Such findings will reaffirm the profiles\nof female exercisers developed in prior research (Ackard\net al., 2002) and, more importantly, will inform the develop-\nment of male exercisers' profiles based on the clustering of\nscores on the OEQ's factor analytically derived subscales.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were students at a large Midwestern university\nwho volunteered in partial fulfillment of their introductory\npsychology course requirements. Announcements of the\nstudy and sign-up sheets were posted in the Psychology\nDepartment. The study was approved by the university's\nInstitutional Review Board.\n(13.3%), and seniors (5.9%) also participating. In regard to\nrace and ethnicity, the majority of participants (77.4%) were\nWhite, with the remainder being Black, non-Hispanic\nand American Indian/Alaskan Native (less than 1%). Among\nmales, the average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.96 \u00b1\nwere similar.\nProcedure\nAll questionnaires were completed in small groups of par-\nticipants with trained research assistants (RAs) as facilitators\nover four academic quarters. The RAs obtained informed\nconsent from each participant and then distributed packets\ncontaining the study questionnaires. Five orders of the instru-\nments were randomly chosen and used to counterbalance\norder effects. Most participants completed the anonymous\nquestionnaires in approximately 1 hr. After returning the\nquestionnaires and optical scan answer forms, participants\nwere given credit slips, indicating that they had completed\nthe study in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an\nintroductory psychology course.\nMeasures\nParticipant/lifestyle characteristics.A brief questionnaire was\ndeveloped by the investigators to obtain information about\nparticipants' age, sex, ethnicity, race, and year in school, as\nwell as self-reported height, weight, and ideal weight. Infor-\nmation about the frequency of dieting and type, frequency,\nand amount of time spent exercising was also obtained.\nThere are no data available on this measure's psychometric\nproperties as it was developed for use in the current study.\nExercise. The OEQ (Pasman & Thompson, 1988; Thompson\nattitudes and activities related to exercise. The instrument's\nreliability and validity have been documented among oblig-\natory exercisers and sedentary individuals recruited from\nroad races, weight training facilities, and undergraduate\npsychology courses (Pasman & Thompson, 1988) and\namong runners (Coen & Ogles, 1993). Individuals report on\na 4-point Likert-type scale how often they experience each\nBrehm and Steffen 3\nexercise-related situation. Higher scores indicate a stronger\nsense of obligation to exercise.\nMental health. The Mental Health Inventory (MHI; Veit &\nWare, 1983) is a 46-item measure of mental health status that\nwas developed for use in the Rand Medical Outcomes Stud-\nies. It is a hierarchically structured measure that has a first-\norder overall measure, the Mental Health Index, 2\nsecond-order subscales measuring Psychological Well-\nBeing (PWB) and PD, and 6 third-order constituent sub-\nscales that measure Anxiety, Depression, and Loss of\nBehavioral and Emotional Control (PD) and Emotional Ties,\nGeneral Positive Affect, and Life Satisfaction (PWB). There\nhas been a wide array of studies with diverse populations\nattesting to this instrument's internal consistency, test-retest\nreliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity\nManning, Duan, Wells, & Newhouse, 1984).\nEating self-efficacy.The Eating Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES)\nis a 25-item questionnaire to assess perceived control over\nfood consumption, with demonstrated internal consistency,\ntest-retest reliability, and convergent validity among male\nand female undergraduate college students (Glynn & Ruder-\nman, 1986). The Negative Affect subscale reflects perceived\ndifficulty controlling eating when experiencing negative\nfeelings, while the Socially Acceptable Circumstances sub-\nscale assesses difficulty controlling eating during social\noccasions. Individuals rate their difficulty controlling eating\non a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 7 (most difficulty) for each\nof 25 conditions. Higher scores are indicative of less eating\nself-efficacy.\nRestrained eating.The Revised Restraint Scale (RRS; Her-\nthat assesses the extent of and concern about dieting. High\nscores indicate elevated levels of dietary restraint. Internal\nreliability of the RRS was high and similar (.77 and .78)\namong both male and female college students (Klem,\nKlesges, Bene, & Mellon, 1990). The scale's validity as an\nindicator of the intent to diet and susceptibility for overeating\nhas been adequately documented in adult men and women\nEating disorder characteristics. The Eating Disorder Inventory\ndimensional self-report instrument that assesses psychologi-\ncal and behavioral characteristics of anorexia and bulimia\nnervosa. Reliability estimates have been documented among\nmale and female students in undergraduate psychology\ncourses (Wear & Pratz, 1987), as well as content, construct,\nand criterion-related validity in patient and nonpatient sam-\nsubscales that assess specific eating disorder attitudes and\nbehaviors. Items are presented in a 6-point format and are\nscored by assigning the three least pathological responses a\nscore of 0 and the other responses 1, 2, or 3 in order of lowest\nto highest pathology. Higher scores reflect greater degrees of\nthe measured characteristic.\nIn the analyses that follow, the first step involves factor\nand cluster analyses of the OEQ to identify excessive exer-\ncise patterns, separately, in male and female participants.\nThen types of exercisers are compared on the measures of\neating disorder and psychological characteristics.\nResults\nFactor Analysis\nThe OEQ was subjected to a principal axis factor analysis\nwith an oblique rotational solution (Direct Oblim in SPSS).\nOblique rotation was used because the factors appeared to be\nmoderately correlated with one another, even under an\northogonal rotation. This analysis produced a four-factor\nsolution for both males and females that explained, respec-\ntively, 54.8% and 54% of the variance in the item set.\nAlthough there are slight differences between males and\nfemales in the items constituting each factor, the majority of\nthem are similar. The Exercise Frequency/Intensity factor\nincludes items addressing the type and frequency of exercis-\ning and the drive to exercise; the Exercise Emotionality fac-\ntor's items describe negative feelings associated with\nexercising or lack of exercising; the Exercise Commitment\nfactor includes items that describe recording and scheduling\nof exercise sessions; the Exercise Obsession factor's items\ndescribe preoccupation with exercising and exercising\ndespite adversity.\nTables 1 and 2 contain the OEQ items, subdivided by\ntheir factors, for males and females, respectively, with their\ncorresponding factor loadings and internal consistency reli-\nabilities (Cronbach's ) for each factor scale. The reliabili-\nties were acceptable for all scales except for males' Factor 3\nwhich was quite low (.374). For men, Factors 1 (Exercise\nFrequency/Intensity) and 2 (Exercise Emotionality) were\nmoderately correlated with Factor 4 (Exercise Obsession) at\nrelated with the other factors. For women, Factor 1 (Exercise\nEmotionality) was slightly to moderately correlated with\nFactor 2 (Exercise Frequency/Intensity), Factor 3 (Exercise\nObsession), and Factor 4 (Exercise Commitment), .279,\nerately correlated (.423) with Factor 4.\nMale Typology\nParticipants were then clustered with their OEQ subscale\nscores as the clustering variables using Hierarchical Cluster\nAnalysis with Ward's Method on squared Euclidian dis-\ntances in SPSS. For men, a three-cluster solution provided\nthe clearest differentiation among groups. Table 3 includes\ndescriptive statistics for the three cluster analysis-derived\ngroups of males on the OEQ subscales. Members of Group 1\n4 SAGE Open\n(n = 100) scored high on exercise frequency/intensity, aver-\nage on exercise commitment, and low on emotionality and\nobsession; thus, this group was labeled \"Exercisers.\" Males\nin Group 2 (n = 60) were characterized by low scores on all\nfour subscales and were labeled \"Non-Exercisers.\" In con-\ntrast, participants in Group 3 (n = 33) scored high on all four\nfactors, particularly exercise emotionality and obsession, and\ntherefore were assigned the name \"Emotional/Obsessive\n(EO) Excessive Exercisers.\"\nSeparate univariate and multivariate analyses of variance\n(MANOVA) and chi-square analyses were conducted to\nexamine the effects of the three cluster groupings on the dif-\nferent sets of variables. Effect sizes were estimated post hoc\nusing phi () and, following Cohen (1988), interpreting val-\nsquared (2) was used to estimate effect sizes for univariate\nanalyses of variance, interpreting values of .01 as small, .059\nas medium, and .138 as large.

With regard\nto Interpersonal Distrust, no individual group was signifi-\ncantly different from any other.\nDiscussion\nThe extent and nature of excessive exercise and its links with\neating disorders among either men or women are unclear and\nstill evolving. The absence of an operational definition of\nexcessive exercise has led to the use of various instruments\nthat measure sundry constructs; therefore, study results are\noften contradictory, being dependent on the measurement\ntool and the researcher's conceptualization of excessive\nexercise. Defining excessive exercise by the amount of time\nengaged in an exercise activity alone ignores its multifaceted\nThe results of this study confirm past findings that exces-\nsive exercise is a multidimensional concept (Ackard et al.,\nthe OEQ has subscales that reveal multiple factors associated\nwith excessive exercise. In the current study, four factors that\nwere nearly identical for men and women were identified:\nExercise Frequency/Intensity, Exercise Emotionality,\nExercise Commitment, and Exercise Obsession. Similar to\nprior research, some factors (i.e., Exercise Emotionality and\nExercise Obsession) describe negative consequences of\nexercising or not being able to exercise (Ackard et al., 2002;\non these factors feel concerned, guilty, and irritated when\nthey miss an exercise session and are driven to exercise in\nspite of injury or fatigue.\nThe first aim of this study was to determine if excessive\nexercise was related to eating disorder and psychological\ncharacteristics in men, in a way similar to that found among\nwomen. A review by Ricciardelli and McCabe (2004) con-\ncurred that several risk factors (e.g., exercising for weight\ncontrol and appearance) associated with disordered eating\namong adolescent boys are similar to those found in girls.\nAlthough research indicates that the biological, psychologi-\ncal, and sociocultural risk factors related to the development\nof disordered eating are similar among adolescent males and\nfemales (Keel, Klump, Leon, & Fulkerson, 1998), such com-\nparison studies are lacking in the area of excessive exercise.\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to develop\nprofiles of male exercisers based on the clustering of scores\non OEQ subscales and to examine the profiles of male exer-\ncisers simultaneously with those of female exercisers.\nBased on a factor-informed cluster analysis of male par-\nticipants, three subgroups were identified with distinctive\nprofiles related to exercise-related attitudes and behaviors.\nAlthough almost 70% of the males (i.e., those in the\nExercisers and EO Excessive Exercisers groups) were cate-\ngorized as exercisers by their Exercise Frequency/Intensity\nscores, only the EO Excessive Exercisers displayed a pro-\npensity toward eating restraint and a drive for thinness,\nessential characteristics of eating disorders. This analysis\ncontinues to substantiate the premise that excessive exercise\nis multidimensional, even for men, and that there appears to\nbe aspects of exercise, namely, exercise emotionality and\nobsession, that are linked to PD and eating disorders. On the\nother hand, exercise appears to relieve or buffer stress and\npromote a sense of well-being for some persons, as shown by\nthe Exercisers' well-adjusted scores on the mental health\nmeasures (i.e., lowest scores on distress and highest scores\non well-being).\nThe typology of the female exerciser differs from that of\nthe male in several ways. Rather than three distinct groups,\nthe cluster analysis identified five groups of females based\non OEQ factor scores. These groups are similar to the six\ngroups identified in previous research with female college\nstudents (Ackard et al., 2002). Both studies revealed distinct\ngroups of maladjusted exercisers and non-exercisers who\ndemonstrated specific exercise beliefs and behaviors, eating-\ndisordered characteristics, and psychopathology, as well as\nBrehm and Steffen 9\ngroups of exercisers and non-exercisers who were well-\nadjusted in terms of psychological attributes.\nIn the present study, two groups (i.e., EO Non-Exercisers\nand EO Excessive Exercisers) scored high on the Exercise\nEmotionality and Exercise Obsession factors and also scored\nsignificantly higher on eating disorder measures, such as\ndrive for thinness and both subscales of the ESES, indicating\nperceived difficulty controlling eating during emotionally\nnegative and social occasions. Again, these findings reaffirm\nprior work that demonstrated the significant link between\nexercise-related cognitions and emotions and eating-disor-\ndered traits, independent of exercise frequency (Ackard et\nsubstantive nor statistically significant differences between\nthese two groups on any measures except for the MHI sub-\nscales of PD and Well-Being with the EO Non-Exercisers\nfaring significantly worse than the EO Excessive Exercisers.\nThese results lend some support to the notion that excessive\nexercise may serve as a strategy to regulate affect for people\nwho have eating disorders (De Young & Anderson, 2010;\nThe second aim of this study was to identify additional\npsychological attributes associated with eating disorder-\nlinked excessive exercise. Our findings related to this aim\nare less clear cut. While both male and female EO Excessive\nExercisers scored highest or nearly highest on most eating\ndisorder characteristics, particularly eating restraint and\ndrive for thinness, male and female EO Excessive Exercisers\nwere not as differentially distressed on the MHI subscales.\nThe EO Excessive Exerciser males were similar to the Non-\nexercisers in both well-being and distress but they appeared\nto be more psychologically distressed than the Exercisers.\nOn the other hand, the EO Excessive Exerciser females\nscored among the lowest on distress and highest on well-\nbeing when compared with their counterparts. As noted ear-\nlier, these findings suggest some psychologically palliative\neffect of exercise.\nAlternative factors that may contribute to the association\nbetween excessive exercise and eating-disordered attitudes\nand behaviors have been addressed by several researchers.\nFor example, diverse motives for exercise have been shown\nto influence exercise and eating-disordered characteristics\ndifferentially. Adkins and Keel (2005) found that health and\nfitness motives were linked with less eating-disordered traits,\nbut a greater compulsion to exercise than other reasons for\nexercising, such as appearance and weight management.\nMond and colleagues demonstrated that exercising for\nweight or shape and extreme guilt after missing exercise\nwere strongly associated with eating disorder psychopathol-\nogy in both clinical and nonclinical samples (Mond &\nAlthough motivation for exercise was not assessed in the\npresent study, it is possible that participants who were exer-\ncising for intrinsic reasons did not display the maladjusted\npsychosocial characteristics that were evident in exercisers\nwho were motivated by external appearance-related factors.\nStudy results showed that both male and female EO Excessive\nExercisers were more likely to have dieted within their life-\ntime and within the past year than other exercisers, and thus\nmay have been driven to exercise by extrinsic motivators\nsuch as weight management. This might explain the exis-\ntence of disparate groups of exercisers (i.e., those with well-\nadjusted and those with maladjusted psychological attributes)\namong both male and female participants.\nIn the current study, the presence of an EO Non-Exerciser\ngroup among females, but not males, may be related to\ngreater concern about weight and appearance and the high\nprevalence of body dissatisfaction among female undergrad-\nuate students (LePage, Crowther, Harrington, & Engler,\nNon-Exercisers reported dieting now and in the past. Perhaps\ntheir weight-related concerns, accompanied by guilt about\nnot engaging in exercise, are linked with their increased psy-\nchopathology, as previously demonstrated in excessive exer-\nThe regulation of negative affect is another common\nmotive for exercising, particularly among females. A\nrecent study showed that those who undertake exercise to\nimprove negative emotional states tend to exhibit an\n\"obligatory\" compulsion to exercise, eating-disordered\nbehaviors and concerns, and lower self-esteem (De Young\n& Anderson, 2010). It is important to note that the quality,\nnot the quantity, of exercise differed between those who\nexercised to alleviate negative affect and those who did\nnot, reaffirming the multidimensionality of excessive exer-\ncise. These study results suggested that exercising for\nmood regulation is potentially harmful and may be a \"red\nflag\" for associated psychopathology. On the other hand,\nnegative affect is significantly lessened from pre- to post-\nexercise (De Young & Anderson, 2010; LePage &\nCrowther, 2010). Thus, for some persons, exercise may be\nan effective method of coping with negative emotional\nstates. Again, the motivation to exercise (i.e., regulation of\nnegative affect) may have contributed to the present\nstudy's discovery of groups of exercisers that are dissimi-\nlar in terms of psychological health.\nIn general, outcome-oriented motives for exercise have a\nnegative impact on psychological health. However, Calogero\nand Pedrotty-Stump have demonstrated that \"mindless\"\nunhealthy exercise that focuses on outcomes rather than pro-\ncess may be reduced by practicing new patterns of exercise\nand modifying the motivators and contexts of mindless exer-\nStump, 2010). Importantly, the adoption of process-focused\nexercise diminishes the \"obligatory\" emotional element of\nexercise (Calogero & Pedrotty, 2004). Programs aimed at the\nprevention or treatment of eating disorders may benefit from\nthe inclusion of mindful exercise (i.e., positive mindset\ntoward exercise) that is associated with improved psychopa-\nthology (Calogero & Pedrotty-Stump, 2010).\nThis study has several limitations to its design and the\nexternal validity of its findings. A chief limitation is its reli-\nance upon self-report and any unanticipated response biases\nthat may consequently ensue. However, the consistency of\nour results with past studies adds a degree of credibility to\nour finding of the links between certain types of emotion-\nladen excessive exercise and eating disorder beliefs and\nbehaviors. The generalizability of our findings is clearly lim-\nited to the population of college students and may not apply\nto those persons of other demographics. Replication of our\nmethods of typing exercisers using dissimilar populations\nwould be beneficial.\nConclusions\nExcessive exercise is a multifaceted concept that cannot be\ndefined solely by the frequency of the activity; it must also\nconsider the exerciser's emotions and cognitions about the\nexercise. Consistent with previous research, those frequent\nexercisers who are emotional and obsessive about their\nexercise routines are likely to display eating disorder\nbehaviors such as drive for thinness, eating restraint, and\nsome other psychological maladjustment. While males\nwho fit this profile of the excessive exerciser (i.e., those\nwho score high on the Emotional and Obsession factors)\nshowed increased PD, it appears that excessive exercise\nmay act as a coping mechanism for females with a similar\nprofile, thereby lessening their PD and enhancing well-\nbeing. With our societal emphasis on physical fitness,\nexercise itself may become psychologically rewarding and\nsocially reinforcing, perpetuating its intensity and\nfrequency.\nThis study provides evidence for the existence of dis-\ncrete types of exercisers (both male and female) who are\nrepresented by clusters of psychosocial characteristics.\nFuture research is needed to confirm the typologies of male\nand female exercisers developed in this study. Longitudinal\nstudies would provide important information related to the\ndevelopmental sequencing of excessive exercise and eating\ndisorders and the directionality of their relationship. In the\nmeantime, clinicians should be aware of the link between\nexcessive exercise and eating disorders to screen better for\nthe co-occurrence of these conditions. They should further\nassess the emotionality and obsession toward exercising\nand interruption of exercise routines, as well as eating-\nrelated attitudes and behaviors, of those patients who exer-\ncise frequently (Thome & Espelage, 2007). While exercise\nmay buffer the PD caused by disordered cognitions related\nto exercise and eating, attention to potential co-existing\npsychopathologies is essential.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAckard, D., Brehm, B.
