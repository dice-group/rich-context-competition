ALI and ARDS are asso-\nciated with high morbidity and mortality\nand a long-term decrease in health-related\nquality of life;1 they account for a high\nproportion of intensive care unit (ICU) bed\nuse. Invasive mechanical ventilation\nthrough an endotracheal tube is often a\nlife-saving intervention, but it may cause or\nexacerbate lung damage in patients with\nALI/ARDS.2 A number of complications\nmay occur during invasive mechanical ven-\ntilation, such as complications of intubation,\nventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),\nventilator-induced lung injury (e.g. baro-\ntrauma, volutrauma and biotrauma) and\ncardiovascular events.2 Noninvasive posi-\ntive-pressure mechanical ventilation\n(NIPPV) delivers a positive pressure support\nto the lungs without the use of an invasive\nartificial airway. During the past 15 years,\nNIPPV has become one of the most import-\nant developments in respiratory medicine3,4\nand is increasingly being used in many\ncountries.5 NIPPV can provide a more con-\nvenient, comfortable and economic type of\nventilation, and has a good safety profile,\ncompared with invasive mechanical ventila-\ntion.6 NIPPV can avoid endotracheal intub-\nation and intubation-related complications,\npermits patients to eat, drink, talk and\nexpectorate, and has become the standard\nof care in hypercapnic respiratory failure\nsecondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease.7 The application of noninvasive\nmechanical ventilation (NIV) in hypoxaemic\nacute respiratory failure (ARF) has also\nbeen an area of research over the last two\ndecades.8 Although two meta-analyses of\nrandomized controlled trials found no\nrobust evidence to support the role of\nNIV in hypoxaemic ARF and ALI/ARDS,\nrespectively;9,10 the use of NIV in specific\nsettings of hypoxaemic ARF (e.g. for pneu-\nmonia in immunocompromized individuals\nand following lung resection surgery) has\nbeen shown to reduce endotracheal intub-\nation rates and even mortality.11 Although\nthe role of NIPPV in ALI/ARDS remains\ncontroversial, research has indicated that\nthe use of NIV increased tidal volume and\ndecreased the inspiratory muscle effort, with\na consequent improvement in dyspnoea and\noxygenation status in patients with ALI.12 A\nrandomized clinical trial showed the benefit\nof using initial NIV treatment in strictly\nselected ALI patients.13\nConventional NIPPV is usually provided\nby a mini-ventilator using the bilevel posi-\ntive airway pressure (PAP) mode. The appli-\ncation and outcomes of NIPPV treatment\nare limited by the function of the machine\nand other aspects. Compared with the use of\nmini-ventilators for NIPPV, modern large\nICU ventilators have unparalleled advan-\ntages because they offer a full range of\nfunctions, excellent performance and mul-\ntiple modes of operation. For example, most\nmini-ventilators are triggered by a posterior\npressure sensor, whereas large ICU ventila-\ntors are usually triggered by an anterior\nflow-rate sensor and are therefore more\nsensitive. Mini-ventilators are commonly\nemployed to deliver NIV, but they use\nsingle-limb tubing that can increase the\namount of CO2\nrebreathing. However,\nlarge ICU ventilators can deliver NIV by\ndouble air circuits that can make patients\nbreathe more smoothly and constrain CO2\nretention. Large ICU ventilators have a\nhigher ventilating pressure and can give\nenough tidal volume and minute ventilation\nvolume. Moreover, they have a wider range\nof ventilation modes that can be used for\ndifferent types of patients. Our clinical team\nhas achieved satisfactory results in the treat-\nment of ALI by NIPPV delivered using a\ncomplex critical care ventilator in clin-\nical practice (personal communication).\nTherefore, the current study was undertaken\nto test the hypothesis that there would be\nbetter clinical outcomes following the treat-\nment of ALI by NIPPV delivered using a\nlarge complex critical care ventilator, com-\npared with a conventional mini-ventilator.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study enrolled consecutive patients who\nmet the ALI diagnostic criteria14 and were\nadmitted to the Department of Emergency\nMedicine, the Department of Respiratory\nDiseases and the surgical ICU (SICU) of the\nGeneral Hospital of Tianjin Medical\nsevere bacterial or viral infection, trauma\n(abdominal surgery not included) and pan-\ncreatitis. During mechanical ventilation,\nconventional supportive treatments, anti-\ninfective agents and antishock treatments\nwere simultaneously administered as and\nwhen required. The study was approved by\nthe Ethics Committee of the General\nHospital of Tianjin Medical University\nwritten informed consent was obtained from\nall patients or their authorized carers/legal\nguardians.\nStudy design\nThis study consisted of a prospective part\nand a retrospective part. The NIPPV part of\nthe study was prospective, with enrolled\npatients meeting the following inclusion\ncriteria for ALI patients: (i) willing to\naccept NIPPV with a disposable full orona-\nsal mask and gastrointestinal decompression\nif necessary; (ii) respiratory rate >23\nbreaths/min at the beginning or using ancil-\nlary respiratory muscles; (iii) arterial oxygen\npartial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen\nnasal cannular oxygen therapy. Delivering\nNIPPV via a complex critical care ventilator\nonly needs the patient to be able to trigger\nthe flow sensor at a flow rate of 3 l/min, so a\nmore obvious degree of consciousness, syn-\nchronized capability, and respiratory inten-\nsity and depth were not required.\nA subgroup of patients with ALI met the\ndiagnostic criteria for ARDS,14 therefore to\ncompare the use of a complex critical care\nventilator to deliver NIPPV with invasive\nmechanical ventilation via an endotracheal\ntube, this study also retrospectively recruited\npatients with ARDS treated with artifi-\ncial airway mechanical ventilation.14 These\npatients had been treated at the Department\nof Emergency Medicine, the Department of\nRespiratory Diseases and the SICU of the\nGeneral Hospital of Tianjin Medical\nAugust 2009. These patients did not provide\nwritten or verbal informed consent because\nthis part of the study was a retrospective\nreview of case history data, with no treat-\nment intervention.\nMechanical ventilation interventions\nFor the prospective NIPPV part of the\nstudy, enrolled patients were divided ran-\ndomly into three groups using a random\nnumber table at study entry and were\nventilated for 8 h continuously according\nto the schedules described below. The ven-\ntilator parameters could be modulated\naccording to the conditions 8 h later.\nGroup A was treated using a conven-\ntional mini-ventilator (BREAS iSleep 22\nBIPAP; Breas Medical AB, Mo\n\u00a8 lnlycke,\nSweden), a disposable oronasal mask and\nan auto-bilevel PAP mode, i.e. pressure\nsupport ventilation (PSV) \u00fe positive end\nexpiratory pressure (PEEP), 7\u00ad8 l/min\noxygen flow by an infusing tube (FiO2\nflow rate could be\nincreased when PaO2\nously. The high-pressure phase was\nlow-pressure phase was 6 cmH2\nO, triggered\nO.\nGroup B was treated using a new type of\nlarge critical care ventilator (Hamilton\nGalileo Gold Ventilator; Hamilton Medical\nAG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), a disposable\noronasal mask and a spontaneous mode, i.e.\ncould be increased when PaO2\ncontinuously. The PSV was 9 cmH2\nO, but\nO when plus PEEP, which was\nO. The trigger flow-rate was 3 l/min\nat the anterior extremity. The expiratory\ntrigger sensitivity (ETS) was 45%. The\npressure rising time (Pramp) was 25 ms.\nGroup C was treated using the same new\ntype of large critical care ventilator, a\ndisposable oronasal mask and a Duo PAP\nmode (Duo PAP \u00fe PSV). FiO2\ncould be increased when PaO2\n<40 mmHg continuously. The PSV was\nO during\nthe low-pressure phase. The high-pressure\nO and the low-pressure\nphase (PEEP) was 6 cmH2\nO. The low-pres-\nsure phase could be overlapped by PSV. The\nhigh-pressure phase time was 1.5 s.\nThe mandatory rate was 10 times per min.\nThe flow-rate trigger was 3 l/min at the\nanterior extremity; the ETS was 45%, and\nthe Pramp was 25 ms.\nClinical parameters (including respira-\ntory rate, PaO2\n, arterial CO2\npartial\npressure [PaCO2\n] and blood pH) were rec-\norded and the Murray ALI score was\nmeasured to evaluate the severity of ALI\nbefore the initiation of NIPPV.15 Each\npatient was asked try their best to expector-\nate, or a sputum suction tube was used to\naspirate any secretions and then the patient\nwas given gastrointestinal decompression.\nAn oropharyngeal tube was used to prevent\nthe tongue root from falling, if necessary.\nThis airway secretion aspiration procedure\nwas performed every 1\u00ad2 h as this improves\nthe effects of treatment. Clinical parameters\nwere collected again after 8 h of ventilation.\nThe clinical parameters of groups B and C\nincluded oral obstructive pressure at 0.1 s\nafter initiation of inhalation (P0.1), rapid\nsuperficial breath (RSB) index, stationary\ncompliance of the lung (Cstat) and inflection\npoint, which were computed and analysed\nusing algorithms and analytical software\nbuilt-in to the large critical care ventilator.\nAir leakage from the mask was carefully\nrestricted by adjusting the tighntess of the\nheadband. The pressure was high, to ensure\nventilation volume, and gastrointestinal\ndecompression helped to relieve abdominal\ndistension and prevent digestive tract\nhaemorrhage.\nThe retrospectively enrolled patients with\nARDS (retrospective group), who were\nmechanically ventilated using an artificial\nairway via the mouth, were treated using the\nsame large critical care ventilator and a\nDuo PAP \u00fe PSV mode. The initial FiO2\nwas\nwere modulated according to clinical condi-\ntions in individual patients.\nThe treatment was considered to fail after\nthe standard 8 h of ventilation when the\npatient met any one of the following criteria:\n(i) cannot tolerate NIPPV; (ii) arterial\noxygen saturation <85% or PaO2\n<50 mmHg, or arterial oxygen saturation\n!50 mmHg but the patient\nneeds >60% of the continuous oxygen con-\ncentration during and after the 8 h of treat-\nment; (iii) serious difficulty with\nexpectoration; (iv) aggravating symptoms\nthat were too serious to allow successful\nventilation (e.g. spontaneous respiratory\nrate fewer than five breaths per min, too\nweak to trigger a breath, low tidal volume);\n(v) having to establish an artificial airway;\n(vi) patient's death.\nThe inflection point was measured by the\npressure\u00advolume tools included within the\nlarge critical care ventilator. Although\nduring noninvasive ventilation there was a\nminor error in calculating the inflection\npoint, recording this information\nremained valuable. An improvement in the\ninflection point was defined as: lower inflec-\ntion point disappeared; lower inflection\npoint enlarged to a steep inflection fragment;\nthe slope rate of the line connecting the\nupper and lower inflection points increased;\nthe slope rate of the tangent line of the\npressure\u00advolume curve across the lower\ninflection point increased.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 11.5\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data are presented as mean\n\u00c6 SD or n of patients. Statistical compari-\nsons of demographic and baseline clinical\ncharacteristics and improvements in the\nclinical parameters among different groups\nwere performed by one-way analysis of\nvariance. Independent-samples t-test was\nused to compare demographic and baseline\nclinical characteristics, and total respiratory\nsupport times, between group C patients\nwith ARDS and the retrospective group of\npatients with ARDS. Exact probabilities in a\n2 \u00c2 2 table were used to analyse the devel-\nopment of VAP and treatment failure\nbetween groups. A P-value <0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 51 consecutive patients were\nenrolled in the prospective part of this\nstudy and were randomly divided into\nthree treatment groups.

A\nsubgroup of nine patients with ALI, rando-\nmized to group C, met the diagnostic criteria\nof ARDS. Consequently, the study retro-\nspectively enrolled a further nine patients\nwith ARDS who were treated with artificial\nairway mechanical ventilation. The results\nof this study indicated that delivering\nNIPPV using a large complex critical care\nventilator for patients with ALI was more\nclinically effective than delivering\nNIPPV using a conventional mini-\nventilator.\nTraditional mini-ventilators are usually\ntriggered by a posterior pressure sensor,\nwhile the complex critical care ventilator\nthat was used in the present study was\ntriggered by an anterior flow rate sensor,\nand was therefore more sensitive than the\nmini-ventilator used in group A. Triggering\nby an anterior flow rate sensor can decrease\nthe reactive time;16 in addition, the complex\ncritical care ventilator has an adjustable ETS\nand Pramp.17 Mini-ventilators, commonly\nemployed to deliver NIV, use single-limb\ntubing that can increase the amount of CO2\nTable 3.

Complex critical care ventilators can\nshorten the inspiration rising time, which\ndecreases the cross product of time and\npressure (which is used to estimate the\nconsumption of respiratory work) and\nincreases the initial inspiration flow rate,\nboth of which are efficacious in the inspira-\ntory assistance provided by PSV. In add-\nition, complex critical care ventilators can\nmeet the demands that ALI patients have for\na high initial inspiratory flow rate.19 With a\nhigher ventilating pressure combined with\nan oropharyngeal airway, complex critical\ncare ventilators can provide adequate tidal\nvolume and minute ventilation volume, and\nimprove the oxygenation of patients. The\npresent study identified better improvements\nin the oxygenation index (PaO2\n) of\ngroups B and C compared with group A.\nComplex critical care ventilators do not\nneed to offer a strong matching ability\nbetween patients and they can open the\nupper airway more definitely and attain\nbetter synchronization than mini-ventila-\ntors.

However,\nNIPPV also has some drawbacks. For\nexample, airway resistance and dead space\nare more obvious during NIPPV. The par-\nameters and curves measured cannot fully\nreflect the real situation of the patients\nbecause the ventilation tube is not com-\npletely sealed.\nThe high pressure that can be delivered\nby a large complex critical care ventilator\nallows operators to use complex modes\nwhen ventilating patients. In this present\nstudy, the Duo PAP \u00fe PSV mode was used\nin group C to deal with the `sponge lung\nmodel' of patients with ALI. Computed\ntomography scans of lungs with ALI have\nshown that lung density increases from the\nventral to the dorsal part, similar to a\nsponge soaked with water.23 The air is\nprogressively extruded out from the basilar\nlung area, causing compressive atelectasis\nand consolidation. The Duo PAP \u00fe PSV\nmode allows patients to breathe spontan-\neously at the alternative two positive pres-\nsure levels. Under the Duo PAP mode, there\nare two alternative positive pressure phases\nthat can produce two functional residual\ncapacities and the difference between the\nfunctional residual capacities drives the\nventilation of patients. Using the active\nrespiratory valve (which automatically and\ndynamically assists spontaneous respiration,\nincreases the mean airway pressure and\ndecreases the peak airway pressure), pro-\nlongs the high functional residual capacity\nphase and decreases ventilator-associated\ninjuries. During NIPPV, using the active\nrespiratory valve can reduce pulmonary\ncirculation suppression, open basilar alveoli\neffectively and ensure spontaneous respir-\nation, and also reduces the use of deep\nsedation and muscle relaxants.\nIn the retrospective part of the present\nstudy, NIPPV delivered using a complex\ncritical care ventilator demonstrated simi-\nlar efficacy as conventional artificial airway\nventilation in the treatment of a small\nsubgroup of patients with ARDS. These\nfindings suggest that using a complex crit-\nical care ventilator to deliver NIPPV could\nreduce the use of endotracheal intubation.\nMore importantly, delivering NIPPV using\na complex critical care ventilator can begin\nearlier than artificial airway mechanical\nventilation and has a wider indication\nrange compared with conventional nonin-\nvasive ventilation using a mini-ventilator in\nclinical practice.24 Therefore, using a com-\nplex critical care ventilator makes it easier\nfor physicians to decide whether or not to\nuse noninvasive mechanical ventilation.\nFor patients with acute hypoxaemic\nrespiratory failure, early selective NIPPV\ntreatment can reduce the need for intub-\nation, reduce the risk of severe complica-\ntions, improve survival and discharge\nrate;11 and is associated with a low inci-\ndence of pneumonia and mortality.25 In\naddition, patients who accept invasive\nmechanical ventilation are at risk of emo-\ntional stress because they cannot talk; in\naddition, it is often extremely difficult for\nthem to communicate their needs because\nof the presence of an endotracheal tube.\nThis stress may negatively impact on ven-\ntilator weaning and survival.26 The delivery\nof NIPPV using a complex critical care\nventilator can relieve such stress because\npatients can continue to eat, drink, talk\nand expectorate. In patients who survive\nfollowing a period of mechanical ventila-\ntion, those treated by NIPPV have a\nshortened ventilation support time,27\nwhich would be expected to be associated\nwith a lower consumption of medical\nresources.\nThis present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, the sample size was rela-\ntively small so the evidence should be con-\nsidered with caution. Future research to\ninvestigate the potential usefulness of com-\nplex critical care ventilators in the delivery\nof NIPPV should be undertaken in larger\npatient populations. Secondly, the two\ngroups of patients with ARDS were not\ntreated during the same time period, so the\nresults may have been affected by bias.\nIn conclusion, the findings of this present\nstudy suggest that more satisfactory clinical\noutcomes were achieved in the treatment\nof patients with ALI when NIPPV was\ndelivered using a complex critical care\nventilator compared with a conventional\nmini-ventilator.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by grants from the\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\nReferences\n1.
