    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhen predominantly White participants in Western countries are asked to shoot individuals in a computer game who may\ncarry weapons, they show a greater bias to shoot at outgroup members and people stereotyped as dangerous. The goal\nwas to determine the extent to which shooter biases in the Middle East would vary as a function of target ethnicity and\nculturally appropriate or inappropriate headgear. Within a sample of 37 male Saudi Arabian residents, we examined shooter\nbiases outside of Western nations for the first time. Targets in this task were either White or Middle Eastern in appearance,\nand wore either American style baseball caps or a Saudi Arabian style shemagh and igal. Our results replicated the bias to\nshoot racial outgroup members observed in Western samples; we found a bias to shoot White over Middle Eastern targets.\nUnexpectedly, we also found a bias for Saudi participants to shoot at people wearing culturally appropriate traditional Saudi\nheadgear over Western style baseball caps. To explain this latter finding, we cautiously speculate that relative perceptions of\ndangerousness in the Middle East may be influenced by media exposure and changing social conditions in the region.\n",

When\npredominantly White participants in Western countries are\nasked to shoot individuals who may carry weapons in com-\nputer games, they show a greater bias to shoot at people who\nare Black than White (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink,\n2002), Middle Eastern than White (Unkelbach, Forgas, &\nDenson, 2008), wearing Muslim headgear than those not\nwearing Muslim headgear (Unkelbach et al., 2008,\nUnkelbach, Goldenberg, M\u00fcller, Sobbe, & Spannaus, 2009),\nand male than female (Plant, Goplen, & Kunstman, 2011).\nThus, when presented with targets from distinct social cate-\ngories, people display the greatest shooter bias toward out-\ngroup members and members of the categories stereotyped\nas relatively more dangerous. The aim of the present research\nwas to quantify the extent to which ethnic group membership\nand culturally appropriate or inappropriate headgear would\ninfluence perceptions of dangerousness by people living in\nthe Middle East.\nPast research on the shooter bias has exclusively exam-\nined Western cultures (i.e., North America, Western Europe,\nand Australia). Consistent with the strong stereotypes that\nBlack men are dangerous (Devine, 1989), the original shooter\nbias research found that both Black and White Americans\ndisplayed a bias to shoot Black targets over White targets\n(Correll et al., 2002). Prior research has reliably shown that\nperceived danger (in addition to ingroup bias) plays a critical\nrole in biases to shoot (Correll, Urland, & Ito, 2006; Correll,\nWittenbrink,Park,Judd,&Goyle,2011;Miller,Zielaskowski,\n& Plant, 2012). For instance, participants show a greater bias\nto shoot targets superimposed on dangerous compared with\nsafe backgrounds (Correll et al., 2011). Western participants\nalso show a stronger neural marker of threat (P200) to Black\nthan White faces in the shooter task (Correll et al., 2006).\nIndividuals who believe that the world is a dangerous place\neven shoot at outgroup members not stereotyped as danger-\nous more than ingroup members (Miller et al., 2012).\nMoreover, the shooter bias is not solely attributable to simple\noutgroup bias because Black Americans shoot more at Black\nthan White targets, and men shoot more at male than female\n1University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia\n2University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA\n3King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding Author:\nTimothy P.

Denson1\n Keywords\nrace, Middle Eastern, White, weapon, stereotype, headgear, social categorization, shooter bias\n2 SAGE Open\nOutgroups are often perceived as dangerous (Stephan &\nStephan, 2000). The little attitudinal data from within the\nMiddle Eastern, Arabic, and Islamic world shows that\nWestern outgroups are perceived as dangerous. Muslims, and\nparticularly those Muslims living in non-Western countries,\nview people in Western countries as violent (Pew Global\nAttitudes Project, 2006). In fact, Muslims are more likely to\nview Westerners as violent than Westerners are to view\nMuslims as violent (Pew Global Attitudes Project, 2011). In\nline with the previously discussed work showing the danger-\nousness basis of shooter biases, we expected that Middle\nEastern participants would show biases to shoot at targets\ncontaining markers of a Western outgroup. In the present\nresearch, two distinct markers were used: race and clothing\n(specifically headgear).\nWe hypothesized that the race bias (Unkelbach et al.,\net al., 2009) typically observed in Western nations toward\nMiddle Eastern targets would be reversed in a Saudi Arabian\nsample. This reversal would be consistent with the percep-\ntions of Westerners as dangerous among Muslims in non-\nWestern countries. More specifically, we hypothesized that\nSaudi men would display\n1. A relatively greater bias for shooting White targets\nover Middle Eastern targets and\n2. A relatively greater bias for shooting those wearing\nAmerican style baseball caps over those wearing the\nculturally appropriate shemagh and igaal.\nNo interaction was hypothesized. Prediction of an interac-\ntion would mean that we believed that the meaning of head-\ngear varies by target race (or race by target headgear): While\npossible, we saw no reason to make this prediction. Both\nrace and headgear should exert independent, additive effects\non shooter biases. White race and baseball caps should both\nbe indicative of the outgroup for Saudi participants and\ntherefore induce greater shooter biases.\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nForty-four non-White male residents of the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia participated in the experiment (M\nage\nyears, SD = 1.4) after giving written informed consent. The\nstudy protocols were approved by the department chairman,\nwho was independent from this research project. Participants\nwere reimbursed the equivalent of AU$10 for their participa-\ntion. An a priori power analysis suggested that 34 partici-\npants were required to provide a target power of .80 to detect\na medium effect (d = .50) with  set at .05 (Faul, Erdfelder,\ntion, given the rarity of this sample, it was important not to\nhave a Type 2 error, and as such, it was deemed important to\nrecruit as many students as possible in the semester: A sam-\nple of 44 participants gives power of .90. Moreover, this\nsample size assured power of at least .80 after filtering par-\nticipants. Most of the participants were Middle Eastern\n(79.5%), some were Asian (typically Pakistani; 9.1%), one\nreported being of more than one race (2.3%), and some did\nnot report their race (9.1%). Prior large-scale surveys have\nshown that 97.0% of the Saudi population is Muslim and that\n82.2% view cultural invasion by the West as a serious or very\nserious issue (World Values Survey Association, 2005).\nMaterials and Procedure\nShooter task.The shooter task was based on the computer\ngame described in Unkelbach et al. (2008) and is similar to\nthe shooter tasks used in other experiments (Correll et al.,\npants are asked to shoot if an armed person appears but not if\nan unarmed person appears. In the present task, targets\nappeared superimposed on one of six randomly selected\nlocations along the balconies of a three-floor apartment\nbuilding. Three target properties were manipulated within-\nparticipants: the presence of a weapon (gun vs. object), target\nrace (White vs. Middle Eastern), and target headgear (Saudi\nArabian shemagh and igal vs. American baseball cap).\nAs per Unkelbach et al. (2008), pictures of prison inmates,\nsourced from the Florida Department of Correction website\n(http://www.dc.state.fl.us), were used to manipulate target\nrace. The pictures contained the head and neck only (see\nFigure 1). Stimuli were 10 men, half of whom were Caucasian\nand half of whom were non-Caucasian with darker skin.\nThere is no Middle Eastern option in the classification sys-\ntem used by the Florida Department of Corrections.\nConsistent with Middle Eastern origins, the non-Caucasian\ntargets had been classified as \"non-Black\" and \"non-Asian\"\nby the website. A sample of 38 participants recruited through\nAmazon's mTurk service confirmed each Middle Eastern\nand White target was perceived as such. For each Middle\nEastern face, the majority of participants classified them as\nof \"Arab/Middle Eastern\" origin rather than \"East Asian/\nSouth Asian,\" \"Indian,\" \"Black/African,\" or \"European/\nWhite face was classified by the majority of participants as\n\"European/Caucasian/White\" (lowest: 94.74%, highest:\n100%). Chi-square goodness of fit tests against chance levels\n(i.e., 20% correct, 80% incorrect) indicated that all faces\nwere recognized as being of the correct race at significantly\nSuperimposed on each face was either a Saudi Arabian\nshemagh and igal or anAmerican style baseball cap (depicted\nin Figure 1). The shemagh is a traditional Arab headdress\nfashioned from a square scarf. The shemagh is held in place\nby the igal, which is a black chord that sits atop the head.\nSuperimposed next to each face was a hand holding either a\nSchofield et al. 3\ngun (black gun, or silver gun) or a harmless object (black\nsoft-drink bottle, silver thermos; see Unkelbach et al., 2008).\nParticipants commenced each trial by pressing the space\nbar. After a 300-ms delay, the background of the three-floor\napartment block appeared alone for 600 ms. The target then\nappeared, and participants had up to 800 ms to decide\nwhether to \"shoot\" or \"not shoot.\" The correct decision was\nto shoot suspects carrying guns but not to shoot those carry-\ning objects. Correct decisions scored points, whereas errors\nsubtracted them. The points were weighted such that shoot-\ning was favorable over not shooting (Correll et al., 2002).\nSpecifically, correctly shooting an armed target earned 10\npoints, correctly not shooting an unarmed target earned 5\npoints, incorrectly shooting an unarmed target deducted 20\npoints, incorrectly not shooting an armed target deducted 40\npoints, and being too slow to make a decision deducted 10\npoints. At the end of each trial, participants were displayed\ntheir current points total.\nParticipants completed eight practice trials with novel tar-\ngets, before completing 20 trials of each Race \u00d7 Headgear \u00d7\nObject type combination.\nStatistical Analyses\nSignal detection theory has been crucial to understanding the\ndecision to shoot (Correll, Hudson, Guillermo, & Ma, 2014), as\nit allows differences in the respondent's sensitivity to the pres-\nence of a gun and their bias to shoot to be modeled separately.\nWithout signal detection procedures, it is impossible to tell\nwhether an individual who successfully shoots at all armed\ntargets was able to readily discriminate between guns and\nobjects or simply held a bias to make the decision to shoot.\nIndividuals who can readily tell apart the guns and objects\nare said to be highly sensitive to the presence of a weapon.\nHigh sensitivity emerges when participants readily hit armed\ntargets and correctly reject the opportunity to shoot unarmed\ntargets. Sensitivity here is reported as d', with higher scores\nindicating a better ability to discriminate guns from objects.\nIndividuals who do not require a lot of evidence to shoot are\nsaid to have set a low criterion for shooting, that is, they are\nbiased to shoot. We report bias to shoot via the  parameter,\nwith lower scores indicating a bias toward shooting and that\nless evidence is required for a shoot response.\nMeasures of d' and  were calculated separately for each\nRace \u00d7 Headgear combination in line with the formulas pub-\nlished by Stanislaw and Todorov (1999). Summaries of the\nraw hit rates and false alarm rates used to calculate d' and \nare presented in Table 1. Because raw hit rates of 1 and false\nalarm rates of 0 need to be adjusted before signal detection\nanalyses, hit rates of 1 became 1 - (1 / 2n), and false alarm\nrates of 0 became 1 / 2n, where n is the number of on-time\nresponses for that trial type.\nFor at least one target type, three participants could not\ndiscriminate between guns and objects (i.e., d'  0), sug-\ngesting that these participants were unlikely to be respond-\ning based on what the target was carrying. As it is most\nlikely that these participants were responding indiscrimi-\nnately, these three participants were removed from the\nanalyses. A further four participants scored greater than \u00b13\nSDs from a sample  mean, and hence were outliers. Their\ndata were removed from the analyses to prevent the undue\ninfluence. None of the reported results change if outlying\nscores on  means were winsorized to prevent their undue\ninfluence instead. Final analyses were conducted using 2\n(race: White vs. Middle Eastern) \u00d7 2 (headgear: shemagh\nand igal vs. baseball cap) repeated measures ANOVAs.\nThe weapon factor was not explicitly included in the\nanalysis as it is used to calculate the measures of\ndiscrimination and bias.\nTable 1. Raw Means and Standard Errors in the Shooter Task.\nArab White\n\nBaseball\ncap\nShemagh\nand igal\nBaseball\ncap\nShemagh\nand igal\nNote. These means are used to calculate the signal detection measures of\nsensitivity and response bias. Participants hit when they decided to shoot,\nrather than not shoot, an armed target. Participants made a false alarm\nwhen they decided to shoot, rather than not shoot, an unarmed target.\nFigure 1. Response bias () as a function of target type in\nExperiment 1.\nNote. Lower scores indicate a greater bias for shooting. Higher scores\nindicate a greater bias against shooting. A score of 1 indicates neither a\nbias to shoot nor a bias against shooting. Sample stimuli of each target\ntype are presented in the bars and vary by race and headgear (black\nbars across eyes were not visible during the task). The Saudi headgear\nconsisted of the shemagh (headdress) and igal (black wreath holding\nshemagh in place). Within-subject error bars \u00b11 SE, calculated within each\ncondition and across all trial types using Cousineau (2005).\n4 SAGE Open\nResults\nShooter Bias\nConsistent with Hypothesis 1, participants showed a greater\nbias to shoot at White targets than Middle Eastern targets,\n= . (Figure 1). Contrary to\nHypothesis 2, participants were also more biased to shoot at\ntargets wearing the shemagh and igal than targets wearing a\n= . . The Target\nRace \u00d7 Headgear interaction was not significant, F(1, 36) =\n= . .\nSupplementary analyses.The patterns reported above were\ninternally replicated using (a) a different set of participant\ninclusion criteria and (b) reaction times. Overall, the supple-\nmentary analyses demonstrate internal consistency across\ncut-offs and methods of analysis in the observed response\nbiases.\nA different set of participant inclusion criteria. Rather than\nfilter outliers and those who could not discriminate guns\nfrom objects, Unkelbach et al. (2008) excluded participants\nwho failed to respond within the response window more than\n20% of the time. Two participants in the present sample met\nthis exclusion criteria; neither of these individuals was fil-\ntered in the original analyses. Under these conditions, there\nwas a bias to shoot White targets over Middle Eastern tar-\n= . , and participants\nwere more biased to shoot at targets wearing the shemagh\nand igal than targets wearing a baseball cap, F(1, 41) = 6.06,\n= . . There was no interaction, F(1, 41) =\n= . .\nReaction times.Faster reaction times indicate a more\naccessible decision than longer reaction times (see Correll\net al., 2014). Latency results consistent with the observed\nresponse biases would be either (1) faster hit latencies or (2)\nslower correct rejection latencies for (a) White targets than\nMiddle Eastern targets and (b) the shemagh and igal rather\nthan baseball caps. All responses made within the response\nwindow were used to calculate participants' mean latencies:\nThese latencies are reported in Table 2. Given the relative\ninfrequency of incorrect latencies (i.e., misses and false\nalarms), these were not analyzed. Faster hit latencies were\nobserved for White targets than Middle Eastern targets, F(1,\n= . , but there was no effect of\n= . , and no inter-\n= . . Slower correct\nrejection latencies were observed for targets wearing the\n= . , but there was no effect of race, F(1, 36) =\n= . . Thus, the reaction time data is consistent\nwith the observed response biases.\nWeapon Discrimination\nThe ability to discern the presence of a weapon was not\n= . ,\nbut was marginally higher when the target wore the shemagh\np\n= . . This was qualified by a significant interaction\np\n= . . Follow-up comparisons revealed that participants\nwere significantly more sensitive to the presence of guns\nwhen the target was White and wearing a baseball cap (M =\n . . There were no\nsignificant differences in discrimination between the other\nRace \u00d7 Headgear combinations (White with shemagh and\nigal, M = 2.71, SD = 0.81; Middle Eastern with baseball cap,\n . .\nDiscussion\nWe found support for Hypothesis 1 (race bias) in that Saudi\nArabian men were more likely to shoot at their racial out-\ngroup than ingroup. This pattern of behavior is identical to\nthat observed in racial majorities in Western samples (Correll\nContradicting Hypothesis 2 (headgear bias), Saudis unex-\npectedly displayed greater bias toward shooting targets wear-\ning the shemagh and igal over those wearing baseball caps.\nThis result replicates prior research in which Western partici-\npants displayed greater shooter bias toward people wearing\nArab headgear (Unkelbach et al., 2008) but failed to support\nour hypothesised reversal of the effect in Saudi Arabia. The\nresults were internally consistent. Participant inclusion crite-\nria did not alter the conclusions of the study, and reaction-\ntime-based analyses supported the conclusions drawn from\nthe signal detection analyses.\nIn the present SaudiArabian sample, we found the hypoth-\nesized link between being a member of the racial ingroup\nand increased likelihood of shooting the racial outgroup\nmember. Although these results may appear intuitive, it must\nbe emphasized that racial biases in non-Western populations\nhave not been the subject of much quantitative investigation.\nShooter biases are relative effects and do not necessarily\nTable 2. Mean Latencies in the Shooter Task.\nArab White\n Baseball cap\nShemagh and\nigal Baseball cap\nShemagh and\nigal\nNote. CR refers to correct rejections. The numbers in parentheses indicate the\nstandard error of the mean latency.\nSchofield et al. 5\nindicate that White people and the shemagh and igal are per-\nceived as dangerous in absolute terms. Rather, we cautiously\nspeculate that the present findings may indicate that White\ntargets may have been perceived as relatively more danger-\nous (or less safe) than Middle Eastern targets. Moreover, tar-\ngets wearing the shemagh and igal may have also been\nperceived as relatively more dangerous (or less safe) than\ntargets wearing American style baseball caps.\nIt is important to consider why we may have found the\npredicted ingroup\u00adoutgroup pattern for race but not cultural\nmarkers. One possibility for this surprising finding is that it\nwas a Type 1 error: Future research should try to replicate\nthis effect in both Saudi Arabia and the Middle East more\nbroadly. However, given the same pattern emerged in the\nanalyses of response times, it is worth considering non-sta-\ntistical explanations. The bias toward shooting targets wear-\ning the shemagh and igal more than baseball caps may be a\nresult of favorable shifts toward the Western world or nega-\ntive shifts away from traditional-conservative values. Young\nSaudis are increasingly technologically engaged, and\nWesternized (Samin, 2012) especially in their clothing\nchoices (Assad, 2008). Due to the immutability of race, these\nsocial changes should not shift danger and safety perceptions\nof White targets relative to Middle Eastern targets: however,\nincreasing globalization may have changed perceptions of\nWestern cultural markers relative to traditional Saudi cultural\nmarkers of the shemagh and igal.\nThe alternate possibility is that Saudi clothing is becom-\ning more negatively perceived for the traditional-conserva-\ntive values it represents. Such a shift could be a result of\nSaudi Arabian participants internalizing Western media ste-\nreotypes aboutArabs, Muslims, and/or those from the Middle\nEast. These stereotypes are resoundingly negative, with only\n5% of Hollywood films presenting Arabs in normal roles\n(Shaheen, 2003). Exposure to this type of stereotyped media\nis known to increase anti-Arab bias in Western samples\n(Saleem & Anderson, 2013). Consequently, exposure to\nthese Western stereotypes may have resulted in their inter-\nnalization, and development of an anti-Arab bias among\nSaudi youth. This process may be similar to Black partici-\npants' internalized stereotypes about Blacks explaining their\nbias to shoot at Black targets (Maddox & Gray, 2002; Plant\net al., 2011). Contrary to this explanation, however, are\nobservations of relatively minimal mass demonstrations in\nSaudi Arabia during Arab spring (Samin, 2012) and the\ndefense of traditional-conservative values on Saudi Internet\nIn an increasingly globalized society, it is important to\nknow how one's race and culture may be perceived not only\nat home but also abroad. Due to the Western bias in experi-\nmental research on racial hostility, this information had not\nbeen previously available. The present findings may be help-\nful for White people traveling or interacting with people in\nMiddle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia. For instance,\nrather than conforming to a culturally normative dress-code,\nit may be better to dress in a stereotypically Western manner.\nFurthermore, the present findings provide unique insight into\nsocial perception processes that may be affected by the rap-\nidly changing cultural milieu in the Arab world. However,\nbecause our study consisted of only male University stu-\ndents, caution must be practiced when generalizing to the\nbroader Saudi population.\nConclusion\nConsistent with research in the West, our participants showed\na greater bias to shoot at a social outgroup: in this case, White\ntargets. This mirrors the effect shown in Western countries in\nwhich participants show a greater bias to shoot Middle\nEastern targets (Unkelbach et al., 2008). However, when\nexamining clothing, we found that people wearing culturally\nappropriate Saudi attire may have been perceived as more\ndangerous. Our findings highlight the necessity of consider-\ning cultural variation in social perceptions of social\ncategories.\nAuthors' Note\nTimothy P.
