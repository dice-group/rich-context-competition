Four therapeutic\nregimens were defined: diet only, insulin only, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only, or OADs\nplus insulin. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine changes in antidiabetic regimens\nand glycemic control rates over time, adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors. The\noutcome measure for glycemic control was HbA1c\n. Glycemic control rates were defined as the\nproportion of type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c\nRESULTS -- Dietary treatment in individuals with diabetes decreased as the sole therapy from\non OADs only increased from 45.4 to 52.5%. Combination of OADs and insulin increased from\nCONCLUSIONS -- Treatment regimens among U.S. adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\nhave changed substantially over the past 10 years. However, a decrease in glycemic control rates\nwas also observed during this time period. This trend may contribute to increased rates of\nmacrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications, which may impact health care costs.\nOur data support the public health message of implementation of early, aggressive management\nof diabetes.\nInadequate glycemic control among in-\ndividuals with diabetes constitutes a\nmajor public health problem in the\nU.S. Uncontrolled diabetes is associated\nwith premature death and disability as\nwell as decreased quality of life and sig-\nnificantly adds to national medical health\ncare expenditures (1). Recent estimates\nshow that the minimum direct and indi-\nrect expenditures attributable to diag-\n(2). Glycemic control remains the major\ntherapeutic objective for prevention of\ntarget organ damage and other complica-\ntions arising from diabetes. Studies have\nshown that a comprehensive and aggres-\nsive management approach is effective in\ndecreasing the rate of progression of mi-\ncrovascular complications (3). Treatment\nregimens of diet and exercise, insulin, and\noral hypoglycemic agents are known to\nimprove glycemia (4,5), and current ap-\nproaches to disease management that in-\nclude greater patient self-participation are\nHowever, the adequacy of adherence\nto American Diabetes Association guide-\nlines, as reflected in estimates of glycemic\ncontrol (8), have not been published re-\ncently for the U.S. population. A study of\nreported that the glycemic control rate\nwas only 44.6% among patients with di-\nagnosed type 2 diabetes (9). Recently, the\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ndata have been released, providing an op-\nportunity for further analysis.

For our analysis, we defined the\n20 years who responded \"yes\" to the\nquestion \"Other than during pregnancy,\nhas a doctor ever told you that you had\ndiabetes or sugar diabetes?\" and in whom\n                                                \nFrom 1GlaxoSmithKline, Upper Providence, Pennsylvania; and the 2University of Maryland, Baltimore,\nMaryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Carol E.

To limit the\nanalysis to adults with diagnosed type 2 di-\nabetes, we excluded subjects whose age at\ndiagnosis was 30 years and who started\ninsulin therapy within 1 year of diagnosis.\nWe also excluded subjects for whom infor-\nmation on type of diabetes medication,\nBMI, or duration of diabetes was missing.\nAfter applying the exclusions, 1,215 sub-\nfor analysis. We used the NHANES sam-\npling weights and primary sampling units\nto estimate the number of individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes, by various demo-\ngraphic, treatment, and glycemic control\ngroups, in the overall U.S. population.\nFour antidiabetic therapeutic regi-\nmens were defined for this study: diet,\ninsulin, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs;\nmonotherapy or in combination), and\nOADs plus insulin. These were defined\naccording to a \"yes\" or \"no\" response to\nthe following questions: \"Are you now\ntaking insulin?\" and \"Are you now taking\ndiabetes pills?\" We classified individuals\nwho answered \"no\" to both of these ques-\ntions as using diet-only therapy. The\nnumber and percent of adults diagnosed\nwith type 2 diabetes on each therapeutic\nregimen was calculated, as was the esti-\nmate of those who achieved glycemic con-\ntrol using a cutpoint HbA1c\n(8). Glycemic control rates were calcu-\nlated as the proportion of type 2 diabetic\npatients with an HbA1c\nlevel 7%. In\nwas\nmeasured by high-performance liquid\nchromatography assay, as in the Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial (12).\nThe upper limit of normal for HbA1c\nin\nthe assay system is 6.1%, which is identi-\ncal to the upper limit of normal recom-\nmended by the American Diabetes\nAssociation using the same assay system.\nAffinity High Performance Liquid Chro-\nmatography system (Primus, Kansas City,\nMO) (13), which has been standardized\nto the reference method used for the Dia-\nbetes Control and Complications Trial.\nBecause the HbA1c\nmeasurements were\nstandardized to the same reference\nmethod, there were no differences in nor-\nmal range or upper limit for HbA1c\nin\nIn addition to univariate analysis, we\nused multiple logistic regression to exam-\nine whether demographics, treatment\nregimen, and other differences between\nthe survey participants might explain any\nobserved changes in national glycemic\nthis logistic model, glycemic control was\nthe dependent variable, the particular\nNHANES survey was the independent\nvariable, and treatment regimen, age, sex,\nethnicity, BMI, and duration of diabetes\nwere potential confounding factors. In\nsimilar fashion, logistic models were used\nto determine whether changes in treat-\nment regimens between the two surveys\nmight be due to demographic and other\ndifferences between the surveys' partici-\npants rather than real temporal changes.\nSUDAAN software (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nwas used to account for the nonrandom\ncluster sample design in calculating vari-\nance estimates (14). Standard errors were\ncomputed for all prevalence rates via Tay-\nlor approximations. Using SAS statistical\nsoftware (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), logis-\ntic regression models were run with sam-\npling weights provided by the NHANES\nsurveys, allowing population-based effect\nestimates. In the logistic models that in-\ncluded both surveys, it was not possible to\ncalculate CIs for the effect estimates (odds\nratios [ORs]), because the sampling meth-\nods of the two surveys differ.\nRESULTS -- Changes in demographic\nand risk factor information between\nnumber of prevalent cases of adults with\ndiagnosed type 2 diabetes increased from\nincreased from 45% in NHANES III\n2000 were slightly younger than those in\nthe earlier survey. The percentage of non-\nHispanic whites among patients with di-\nagnosed type 2 diabetes decreased from\nother hand, there was a slight increase in\nthe percentage of non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican Americans, and the propor-\ntion of ethnic groups other than non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans increased from 6\nto 17%.

We also observed changes\nin the demographic distribution of the\nadults with diagnosed type 2 diabetes\ncreased proportion of men and minority\ngroups other than non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican Americans. In recent years,\nindividuals with diagnosed diabetes\ntended to be younger, to weigh more, and\nto have a longer duration of diabetes.\nHowever, we found that these demo-\ngraphic differences did not fully explain\nthe lower glycemic control rates seen in\nrecent years. Other reasons might ac-\ncount for the observed declining rates\nover time, such as changes in patient com-\npliance with treatment programs despite\nmore aggressive management. Another\npossible explanation for this observation\nmay be surveillance bias due to a prefer-\nential increased screening for diabetes in\ncompared with the previous decade.\nIn addition to changes in demo-\ngraphic features among patients over\ntime, we also observed changes in the\ntherapeutic regimen. The proportion of\ncurrent individuals with diagnosed diabe-\ntes following diet-only or insulin-only\ntreatment regimens has decreased since\nOADs only or OADs in combination with\ninsulin has increased. This change may be\ndue to a larger selection of marketed oral\nagents. The increase in use of OADs from\nnylureas were available in the earlier time\nperiod. By 2000, at least six new products\nin four new classes of OADs had become\navailable. Another reason for the observed\nchange may be a trend toward more ag-\ngressive and earlier treatment with OADs\nand OAD/insulin combinations.\nWe have also demonstrated that gly-\ncemic control was better in older individ-\nuals with diagnosed diabetes, those with\nhigher BMI, and those with a longer du-\nration of diagnosed diabetes (Table 3). Di-\nabetic control was worse in minority\nethnic groups and those taking medica-\ntions (as compared with those on diet\nonly). It is not clear why glycemic control\nmight be better in older individuals, but\nMedication type\nAdjusted* OR for medication\ncompared with NHANES III\nn Percent (SE) n Percent (SE)\n*Adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and duration of diabetes.\nTable 3--Multiple logistic regression model\nof glycemic control between adults diagnosed\nVariable\nOR for glycemic\ncontrol*\nSurvey\nAge\nEthnicity\nSex\nBMI (kg/m2)\nMedication use\nDuration of diabetes (years) 1.01\n*Glycemic control defined as an HbA1c\nlevel\n7.0%; for 1 additional year of diabetes duration.\nKoro and Associates\nsome studies have suggested that older\npatients may have better access to medical\ncare, are more motivated to receive care,\nand are more compliant with medication\nuse (15). This finding is somewhat in con-\ntrast to that of the U.K. Prospective Dia-\nbetes Study (UKPDS), which suggested\nthat glycemic control rates among indi-\nviduals with diabetes decrease with dis-\nease duration and, thus, with age (16).\nAlso in contrast to the current study, Har-\nris et al. (9) found that obesity was not\nrelated to glycemic control. They attrib-\nuted their results to the cross-sectional\ndesign of the survey.\nThere are several limitations to the\ncurrent analysis. The sample size from the\nsurvey continues over the next few years,\nmore subjects will accrue, and the analy-\nsis can be repeated. Another limitation is\nthat medication use is self-reported, and\nthis may cause some misclassification in\nmeasured treatment regimens. Addition-\nally, because NHANES surveys are cross-\nsectional in design, some of our findings\nmay be related to survival bias in that in-\ndividuals with diabetes having the poor-\nest control may have died over time and\ncould not participate in surveys. Also, in\nchanged the diagnostic criteria for diabe-\ntes, which may have influenced preva-\nlence estimates of diagnosed diabetes\nbetween the two NHANES surveys (8).\nWe conclude that the proportion of\nadults in the U.S. with diagnosed type 2\ndiabetes that is controlled is inadequate\nand less favorable than in previous years.\nThe cardiovascular and other conse-\nquences of inadequate glycemic control\nwarrant serious consideration by treating\nphysicians and others who care for indi-\nviduals with diabetes. These data lend\nsupport to public health initiatives advo-\ncating early and aggressive management\nof diabetes.\nReferences\n1.
