    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to explore in detail the factors that affect the consumer behavioral intention to adopt broadband Internet\nin a developing country perspective. Various attitudinal, normative, and control constructs were identified and investigated\nfor their possible influence on broadband Internet adoption. The empirical data for this study were collected using a self-\nadministered questionnaire that included items related to various attitudinal, normative, and control constructs. Descriptive\nstatistics and regression analysis were used to test these constructs for their possible influence on Indian consumers' adoption\nof broadband Internet. The findings suggest that perceived ease of use (PE), social outcomes (SO), hedonic outcomes (HO),\nservice quality (SQ), facilitating conditions resources (FCR), and self-efficacy (SE) were very significant predictors of Indian\nconsumers' behavioral intention to adopt broadband Internet. This study has multifold significance. The integrated research\nframework used in this study is an extension of previous well-established research models (such as Model of Adoption of\nTechnology in Households [MATH], Diffusion of Innovation [DOI], and Theory of Planned Behavior [TPB]) and provides an\nenhanced comprehension of broadband Internet by the Indian household consumers.\n",

Broadband is the\nnew innovation high-speed Internet access technology that\nprovides not only economic and public benefits but also\nimproves people's lives (B. Anderson & Tracey, 2001;\nChoudrie & Dwivedi, 2006a). Broadband Internet diffusion\nnot only increases national competitiveness (thus increases\nForeign Direct Investment [FDI] in the country; Bankole,\nincrease international competitiveness by leveraging e-com-\nmerce activities (Armenta, Serrano, Cabrera, & Conte, 2012;\nAyanso, Cho, & Lertwachara, 2014; Choudrie & Dwivedi,\nOne of the significant changes in Internet technologies\nhas been the replacement of narrowband (dial-up) connec-\ntion by high-speed broadband connection (Choudrie &\nDwivedi, 2004). Broadband is considered a technology that\nprovides high-speed broadcast with greater bandwidth,\nhigher data transmission rates, and always-on access to\napplications, services, and content (Qureshi, 2010; Sawyer,\nAllen, & Lee, 2003). The exponential growth of Internet\ntechnology has given rise to increased customer expectations\n(Wei, 2004). Many research studies have been conducted to\nlook into various applications of broadband that have huge\npotential of increased revenues for communications indus-\ntries (Crandall, Lehr, & Litan, 2007; Jung, Perez-Mira, &\nWiley-Patton, 2009; Katz, Vaterlaus, Zenh\u00e4usern, & Suter,\nfore, has a key role to provide an ever more-connected world\nto the consumer communities (Bell, 2008).\nBroadband in India\nFirst broadband connection in India was given in 1998.

India is considered one of the largest and\nfastest growing major telecom markets in the world.\nBroadband Internet in India is growing mainly due to the\nrapid growth in Indian telecommunication sector. India's\ngrowing economy, rapidly expanding middle class, low tar-\niffs, and highly competitive market have further supported\nthe continuous expansion of the broadband sector\nSuccessive Indian governments introduced comprehen-\nsive reforms over the last decade that changed the landscape\nof telecommunication in India. Indian government has taken\nmany initiatives, such as Indian PC program, e-governance,\ne-learning, and e-healthcare services, to spur the growth of\nbroadband Internet. Broadband network expansion and\nupgrades are underway in India to match up with comparable\nAsian broadband markets. Indian government has made\nthree priorities for its plans to increase broadband penetra-\ntion and usage: lower cost-per-engagemen pricing, afford-\nable broadband software and hardware, and cheap, consistent\nbroadband interconnectivity among villages (Pereira, 2011).\nThe Indian government has continued its policy of an open\nand competitive broadband market. Some of the key steps in\nthis regard included issuing licenses to new telecom opera-\ntors, allowing global operators to work with local compa-\nnies, privatization of the country's long-distance market,\nbandwidth sharing among Internet service providers (ISPs),\nallowing the use of Ku-band in both Indian and foreign satel-\nlites, and launch of mobile number portability (MNP; the\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India [TRAI], 2010). In\n2011, the fixed line penetration in India was 3% and around\n98% of the Indian population had some form of access to a\ntelephone (BusinessWire.com, 2011). During the last decade,\nheavy investment was made in telecom infrastructure. The\nIndian government continued to force completion of restruc-\nturing of telecommunications regulatory regime. The TRAI\ncontinued its structural reforms such as adoption of unified\nlicensing, increased infrastructure sharing, and revised FDI\npolicy, increasing foreign ownership limit from 49% to 74%\napproved a national broadband plan. The objective of the\nplan was to provide high-speed Internet access and e-govern-\nUnder this plan, an open access countrywide optical-\nfiber-based broadband network will be established, which\nwill provide connectivity to all areas with population of 500\nBroadband Internet and Economic Development\nThere are many factors that boost economic growth, includ-\ning product, process, and organizational innovations, and the\ndistribution and generation of information and ideas.\nTechnological changes result from small incremental\nimprovements over a period of time. However, even a small\nimprovement in technology can alter how and where eco-\nnomic activity is managed (Czernich, Falck, Kretschmer, &\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nOECD (2008) defines broadband as a general-purpose\ntechnology that when incorporated with other information\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) can change how and\nwhere economic activities are managed. This change is\naffected through many channels. A clear impact occurs from\ninvesting in the infrastructure itself and related ICTs. Indirect\nimpacts come from all aspects of economic activity affected\nby broadband and which drive economic growth (Collins,\nAmple academic literature is available that has examined\nthe impact of broadband on firm-level productivity (Holt &\nJamison, 2009). A central theme of the academic literature is\nthe ability of broadband to create new business models, pro-\ncesses, and innovation. It helps in increasing the productivity\nand efficiency of the firm. The study of Allen Consulting\nGroup (2002) reported results from a survey of Australian\nbusiness on the cost saving obtained from using broadband\nInternet. The results of the survey showed that around 6.3%\nbusinesses experienced cost saving from the utilization of\nbroadband Internet as compared with the 1.5% from the uti-\nlization of dial-up Internet. The research declared that for\nAustralian businesses, the average cost saving would result\nin an overall output gain of approximately 0.32%. These\nresults are consistent with the most recent research by the\nAustralian Industry Group (2008) who claimed that more\nthan 93% of the firms investigated showed that broadband\nhas a positive influence on the efficiency and output.\nA panel of 6,060 New Zealand firms was analyzed by\nGrimes, Ren, and Stevens (2012) in a study to find the effect\nthat various forms of Internet access have on the firm's out-\nput. The information collected from the surveys conducted\nby Statistics New Zealand permitted the authors to control\nfor a range of firm characteristics including those factors that\nmay determine a firm's choice of Internet access. The two\nestimation approaches used were an instrument variable (IV)\nestimator and propensity score matching (PSM) estimator.\nThe (IV) estimation results showed higher productivity\nimpacts from the utilization of broadband. The utilization of\nbroadband increased the productivity of firms by 21% to\n25%. The PSM results showed that productivity increased by\n6.9 to 9.7 due to broadband utilization. These effects were\nconsistent across different types of firms with no significant\ndifferences across an urban versus rural split or across high\nversus low knowledge industries. Although the results firm\nIV estimation were greater than those gathered from PSM,\nthe authors of the study favored PSM estimation due to their\nlow confidence on IV results. This low confidence resulted\nfrom their lack of specific knowledge about the correct func-\ntional specification in relation to a firm's labor productivity\nrelative to its sector.\nIn addition to examination of broadband Internet on firm-level\nproductivity, there is growing academic literature that examines\nthe association between broadband and macroeconomic-level\nindicators such as economic growth and employment.\nOECD countries, using an instrumental variable model, to\nestimate the impact of broadband infrastructure on economic\ngrowth. Czernich et al. concluded that the broadband intro-\nduction and diffusion had a significant impact in the growth\nof gross domestic product (GDP) in the OECD countries\nincluded in the panel study. After the introduction of broad-\nband, the per capita GDP of a country was on average 2.7%\nto 3.9% greater than before the introduction of broadband,\ncontrolling for country and year fixed effects. It was further\nconcluded that an increase in 10% points in the diffusion of\nbroadband raised annual growth per capita by between 0.9%\nand 1.5% points annually.\nThe effect of broadband penetration on the employment\ngrowth, rents, wages, business growth, and industry structure\nat the community, industry, and state level was analyzed in\nthe study by (Lehr, Bauer, Heikkinen, & Clark, 2011)). Lehr\net al. concluded that the take-up of broadband promotes the\neconomic activity with major effects in the growth of job and\nbusiness, especially for larger business and business in\nIT-intensive sectors. It was further concluded that the take-up\nof broadband had no substantial effect on the wages but that\nthere was an important link between residential property val-\nues and broadband take-up.\nQiang, Rossotto, & Kimura (2009) used the Barro cross-\nsectional and endogenous growth model by using the data\nfrom 120 developing and developed countries to evaluate the\neffect that broadband has had on the long-term economic\nthe empirical analysis recommend a strong and substantial\ngrowth dividend from broadband access in developed coun-\ntries. Keeping other factors constant, in a developed country,\na 10% increase in the penetration of broadband would result\nin 1.21% increase in the growth of economy. It was found\nthat keeping other factors constant, a 10% increase in the dif-\nfusion of broadband in developing countries would cause a\n1.38% increase in the growth of an economy.\nThe research by Koutroumpis (2009) used a macroeco-\nnomic production function with microeconomic model for\nbroadband investment to estimate how broadband infrastruc-\nture investment contributed in economic growth in 22 OECD\nFindings showed a strong causal relationship between eco-\nnomic growth and broadband. The results also suggested that\nthere are increasing returns to investment in broadband infra-\nstructure. Countries with broadband penetration rates of\nmore than 30% gained higher returns from broadband invest-\nments relative to those countries with lower broadband pen-\netration rates.\nThe study by Crandall et al. (2007) assessed the impacts\nof broadband penetration on economic output and employ-\nment, in aggregate and by industry sector, for 48 states of the\ncluded that non-farm employment in several industries was\npositively associated with broadband use. Particularly, for\nevery 1% increase in broadband penetration in a state,\nemployment increased by 0.2% to 0.3% each year. The study\nalso concluded that employment in both manufacturing and\nservice industries (especially education, finance, and health\ncare) was positively associated with broadband penetration.\nMoreover, the state output of goods and services was posi-\ntively associated with the utilization of broadband.\nThe Broadband Adoption\nThere exist both macro- (Choudrie & Lee, 2004; Feijoo,\nGomez-Barroso, Ramos, & Rojo-Alonso, 2006; Garfield &\n; Sim, Kong, Lee, Tan, & Teo, 2012) and micro-level (Chia,\nDwivedi, Lal, & Williams, 2009; Irani, Dwivedi, & Williams,\nadoption and diffusion. Most studies have been conducted in\nthe context of developed countries. There exist few studies in\nthe context of developing countries (Dwivedi, Choudrie, &\nDwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007; Khoumbati,\nThere exists room for further research to better under-\nstand the current state of broadband Internet deployment,\nuptake, and diffusion in developing world and a research that\nmay assist in explaining the factors that may hasten the pro-\ncess of broadband adoption. It is believed that broadband\nInternet can significantly boost Indian economy by enhanc-\ning the well-being of its people by assisting in the release of\neducation, health, and telecommunications services at a more\naffordable rate to the masses (Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007).\nGiven such perceived benefits, it is pertinent to gain an\nunderstanding of the factors affecting the consumption,\nacceptance, and usage of broadband among Indian\nconsumers.\nMany research studies have been conducted on broadband\nadoption in the developing countries such as Bangladesh,\nIndia (Dwivedi, Williams, Lal, & Bhatt, 2007)), the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia (KSA; Dwivedi & Weerakkody, 2007), and\nMalaysia (Ooi, Sim, et al., 2011). These studies identified\ndifferent factors significant in determining the behavioral\nintentions (BIs) of consumers to adopt broadband. Table 1\nlists the factors.\nIn the era of continued development of ICTs and emerg-\ning network economy, developing countries, such as India,\nare faced with various challenges as well as opportunities\n(Kapur, 2001). Inadequate broadband access may result in\nnegative impact on Indian productivity and is likely to result\nin higher operational costs for a number of businesses. This\nnot only affects the performance of existing Indian firms but\nalso hinders the attractiveness of India as a potential invest-\nment place. Broadband is immensely important to India\n4 SAGE Open\nbecause it can accelerate the economic growth through ICT,\nwhich has been identified as a key factor to improve produc-\ntivity performance. Considering the relatively low levels of\nbroadband adoptions in developing countries, including\nIndia, a research in this area may be helpful in understanding\nand accelerating the process of broadband Internet adoption\nby consumers in India. It is essential to conduct an empirical\nstudy in India, given the slow rate of broadband adoption.\nThis study extends the research conducted by Khoumbati et\ndeeper comprehension of consumers'perception and attitude\ntoward the usefulness of broadband technology.\nAfter witnessing the Korean broadband success and the\nresultant economic development (Jin, 2005), academicians,\ngovernment telecom officials, and information technology\nexperts around the world are interested in knowing how the\nKorean success story can be replicated by gaining an under-\nstanding of the factors that influenced such a quick embrace\nof broadband technology by Korea. This research would be a\nvaluable addition to existing literature as the reasons for\nadoption of consumers can be understood in a more advanced\nlevel from a developing country that is situated in a strategic\nlocation neighboring China. The knowledge of such reasons\nwould provide a good foundation for other developing coun-\ntries that plan to deploy broadband services and to reap asso-\nciated economic and development benefits.\nResearch Questions and Theoretical Model\nThis study addresses two research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the decisive factors in\nconsumers' BI to adopt broadband?\nResearch Question 2: Which of the factor(s) most sig-\nnificantly influence consumer's BI to adopt broadband?\nThe factors to be studied in the theoretical model of this\nresearch have been derived from theoretical models of\nDiffusion of Innovation (DOI), Theory of Planned Behavior\n(TPB), and Model of Adoption of Technology in Households\n(MATH). Other factors might have an effect on the adoption\nof broadband and these factors have been taken into consid-\neration to predict the intention to adopt broadband Internet.\nThere are five sections of this study. The first section pro-\nvides an overview of the research undertaken. The next sec-\ntion provides a discussion of the theoretical background and\nresearch model. This is followed by the discussion of meth-\nodology. After that, a discussion and detailed interpretation\nof findings will be presented. The last section provides a con-\nclusion with implications, limitations, and suggestions for\nfuture research.\nTheoretical Background and the\nResearch Model\nTheoretical Basis\nThis study utilizes some important theoretical models, such\nas TPB, DOI, and MATH, to examine broadband diffusion.\nAccording to TPB, the IT usage among individuals is driven\nby their BIs. These BIs comprised of Attitudes (personal\nbeliefaboutexpectedoutcomesoftheusageofIT),Subjective\nNorm (belief about personal behavior regarding IT usage\nwith respect to other people expectations), and Perceived\nBehavioral Control (personal belief about degree of usage\ncapability of IT). Many researches have used and adopted\nTPB to study the adoption and implementation of informa-\nstudies have extended TPB to fit varying needs of researches\nsuch as the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior\n(Decomposed TPB; Cheon, Lee, Crooks, & Song, 2012;\nHernandez, 2010; Ramayah, Rouibah, Gopi, & Rangel,\nMATH framework is based on three main elements, namely,\nattitudinal belief (consisting of utilitarian outcomes [UO],\nTable 1. Factors Affecting Broadband Adoption in Different Developing Countries.\nCountry Significant factors in broadband adoption\nBangladesh Attitude, primary influence, secondary influence, and facilitating conditions resources (Dwivedi, Khan,\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia Usefulness, service quality, age, usage, type of connection, and accommodation (Dwivedi, Williams,\nPakistan Primary influence, facilitating conditions resources, cost, and perceived ease of use (Khoumbati,\nIndia Relative advantage, hedonic outcomes, and cost (Dwivedi et al., 2008)\nMalaysia Primary influences (PI), secondary influences, relative advantage (RA), utilitarian outcomes (UO),\nfacilitating condition resources (FCR), and self-efficacy (SE; Ooi, Sim, Yew, & Lin, 2011)\nhedonic outcomes [HO], and social outcomes [SO]), norma-\ntive belief (consisting of primary and secondary influences),\nand control belief (consisting of perceived knowledge [K],\nperceive ease of use [PE], and perceived cost). This frame-\nwork has also been used in research considering it to be more\nappropriate and useful to study broadband adoption\n(Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). The Rogers's DOI has been\nused to study the pattern of diffusion and adoption of new\ntechnology to predict the success of new technology inven-\ntion. This model focuses on both the usage and subsequent\nusage aspect (Rogers, 1995). One element of DOI, relative\nadvantage (RA), has been found to be easily applied and\nintegrated with other constructs used to examine diffusion of\nbroadband (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2004). Against this back-\ndrop, this research uses a modified framework that extends\nexisting models to investigate the factors that affect the BI of\nconsumers to adopt broadband Internet. The definitions of\neach variable are shown in Table 2.\nIt was found that constructs such as RA, UO, HO, primary\ninfluence, secondary influence, self-efficacy (SE), facilitat-\ning conditions, overall service quality (SQ), and service\nvalue and satisfaction significantly influenced BI to adopt\nDwivedi et al., 2006; Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou,\nbe applied to examine broadband adoption. For this study,\nwe have divided the facilitating conditions variable into two\nvariables, namely, facilitating conditions resources (FCR)\nand facilitating conditions technology (FCT). The purpose is\nto look separately at the impact of general facilitating condi-\ntions and facilitating conditions related to technology. This\nstudy postulates that BI to adopt broadband is influenced by\nseveral independent variables, which can be categorized into\nKhoumbati, Williams, & Lal, 2007). These are as follows:\n1. Attitudinal factors, which describe the individual's\nperception toward broadband technologies (RA, UO,\nHO, SO, SQ);\n2. Normative factors, which describe the social influ-\nences that may affect the intention to adopt broad-\nband (referents influence [RI], social influence [SI]);\nand\n3. Control factors, which control or influence the abil-\nity to initiate and maintain a broadband subscription\n(K, skills [SK], FCT, FCR, PE, SE).\nRA and UO have been found to be significant factors in\ndetermining broadband adoption (Dwivedi & Irani, 2009;\nDwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007; Venkatesh &\nBrown, 2001). Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework\nused by this research. This framework is adapted and modi-\nfied from Dwivedi (2005) and Dwivedi, Choudrie, &\nBrinkman (2006). This framework takes broadband adoption\nas an independent variable that is affected by a number of\nindependent variables that can be categorized as attitudinal,\nnormative, and control factors. Because very few studies\nhave examined the broadband adoption in developing coun-\ntries (especially Southeast Asian countries), it was decided\nthat all the possible and appropriate constructs (within the\nIndian context) from previous studies, as described in Table\n2, would be included in this study.\nHypotheses\nBased on the literature review and the developed conceptual\nmodel, following hypotheses were developed for this study.\nHypothesis 1. Attitudinal, normative, and control factors\nsignificantly influence consumers' BI to adopt broadband\nHypothesis 2. The proposed conceptual model of broad-\nband adoption provides an appropriate level of explana-\ntion of variance in the consumer's BI to adopt broadband\n(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi & Weerakkody,\nResearch Method\nSampling and Data Collection\nFor the purpose of exploratory research, such as the current\nstudy, the survey is considered a suitable instrument for pri-\nmary data collection (Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2005). A self-\nadministered questionnaire was developed and used.\nLiterature review provided the foundation for development\nof questionnaire. First, a draft questionnaire was prepared.\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 21 questions. The Likert-\ntype scale questions were adapted from Dwivedi (2005) and\nDwivedi et al. (2006) and the demographic categories were\nadapted from Choudrie and Dwivedi (2006a). Each question\nwas a statement followed by a 5-point Likert-type scale rang-\ning from \"strongly disagree\" through \"neither agree nor dis-\nagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" Questionnaires were distributed\nboth in hard copy format and via e-mails.\nProfile of Respondents\nTable 3 provides the breakdown of various residential con-\nsumers in our sample.\nThe Sample Plan\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the identity of consumers\ncurrently using the broadband facility and the nomadic\nnature of access, the snowballing sampling technique\n(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi, Khoumbati, et al.,\n2007) was used. The researcher sought help from his friends\n6 SAGE Open\nin India. Initial respondents from academia, the private sec-\ntor, government, students, and the public within Mumbai city\nwere first identified. They in turn referenced their friends and\ncolleagues from other cities of India who utilized broadband.\nThis progressively increased the sample size (Selamat et al.,\nquestionnaire being administered to 600 broadband users\nquestionnaires administered, 203 respondents returned com-\npleted and usable questionnaires. Thus, a response rate of\n33% was achieved. This response rate is comparable with\nresponse rates in recent studies on broadband adoption\n(Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007; Dwivedi, Khoumbati, et al.,\nData Analysis\nIn the initial phase of data analysis, responses were checked\nand assigned a unique ID number (Fowler, 2002; Holmstr\u00f6m,\nTable 2.

The same software\nwas used for reliability testing and regression analysis of\nresearch data collected through questionnaires (Hinton,\nBrownlow, McMurray, & Cozens, 2004; Straub, Boudreau,\nReliability Test\nReliability of constructs was estimated using Cronbach's\ncoefficient (; Table 4).\nHigher values of Cronbach's alpha represent the higher\ninternal consistency of the construct. Values of alpha greater\nthan .9 represent very high consistency whereas values\nbetween .5 and .7 represent moderate consistency (Hinton\net al., 2004). In this study, Cronbach's alpha varied between\n.879 for SO and .911 for BI. The values obtained suggest that\nall constructs were internally consistent.\nTesting of Multivariate Assumptions\nBefore data analysis, we checked the multivariate assump-\ntions (such as multicollinearity; Fotopoulos & Psomas, 2009;\nHair, Tatham, Anderson, & Black, 2005; V.-H. Lee, Ooi, Tan,\n& Chong, 2010). Table 5 shows the variance inflation factor\n(VIF) values of various independent variables. The values\nTable 3.

There were no\nindependent variables that had condition indexes above 30\ncoupled with 2 variance proportions greater than .50\n(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Hence, based on these basic\nassumptions of the multivariate model, it implies that there\nwere no statistically significant violations (V.-H.

That means that predictor variables\nconsidered in the model of this study are significant in under-\nstanding the consumers' BI to adopt broadband.\nIn this validated model, six predictor variables were found\nsignificant for explaining the variation in BI (Table 12).\np < .001). The regression equation for the validated model\nwas found to be as follows:\nThe value of  suggests that the PE had the largest impact in\nthe explanation of variations of consumer BI to adopt broadband,\nfollowed by SO, SQ, SE, FCR, and HO. RA, The variables UO,\nRI, SI, K, SK, and FCT did not significantly affect the BI.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study is to examine the significant factors\nthat influence the consumer attitude toward broadband adop-\ntion and usage in India. India is progressing fast in IT infra-\nstructure development and broadband adoption rate. In\ncomparison with a study on Bangladesh (Dwivedi, Khan, &\nPapazafeiropoulou, 2007), a previous study on India\n(Dwivedi et al., 2008), the KSA (Dwivedi & Weerakkody,\nSim, et al., 2011). Our results show that four constructs--PE\nFCR, SE, FCT, and HO--have similar results with the previ-\nous studies. Meanwhile, the findings on SO, SQ, RI, SI, RA,\nK, and FCR were found to be contradicted as compared with\nthe same studies. Following is the explanation of the com-\nparison of the differences between our findings and previous\nstudies in other developing countries.\nThe RI and SI were found to have no significant effect on\nconsumers' intention in adopting broadband. This implies\nthat the influences perceived from social groups (such as\nfamily and peers) and secondary sources (news, newspaper,\nor magazines) have no significant effect on consumers'\nintention in adopting broadband. This is a significant con-\ntrast compared with previous studies. The broadband usage\nin India is increasing although not at the pace comparable\nwith its neighbor China. With this, the influence from refer-\nence groups should be a trusted information source for con-\nsumers deciding to adopt and use broadband. However, the\nresults indicate a deficit of consumer trust on information\nprovided by the reference groups. Therefore, the strategy of\nemphasizing on primary influence as a driver to increase\nbroadband adoption in early stages may require rethinking.\nFor FCR, our results showed significant effect toward\nintention to adopt broadband. This may imply that the strat-\negy to increase broadband adoption rate by providing facili-\ntating conditions and supporting facilities (Rogers, 1995)\nseems to have significant impact. This is in agreement with\nprevious studies of Pakistan (Khoumbati et al., 2007) and\nBangladesh (Dwivedi, Khan, et al., 2007). The results sug-\ngest that facilitating factors (such as technical and support\nfacilities) are important to facilitate and boost up the broad-\nband uptake in nations. This finding has significant implica-\ntion for ISPs in India investing significantly on enhancing\ntheir technical and support facilities.\nTable 9. Descriptive Statistics for Normative Construct (N =\nFactors Detailed factors M SD Rank\nFor FCT, our results showed no significant effect toward\nintention to adopt broadband. Considering the various fac-\ntors used to analyze facilitating conditions of technology\n(availability of electricity, reliability of broadband connec-\ntion, availability of diverse access technologies, and choice\nof different service providers), we can explain this finding by\nlooking at the current highly competitive landscape of broad-\nband services in India. With the emergence of many service\nproviders providing various broadband access technologies\nand low switching costs, consumers have liberty to switch\nservice providers quickly.\nFrom our findings, HO was found to be least significant in\ninfluencing broadband adoption, while UO was found to be\nnot significant. It appears that consumers'adoption of broad-\nband is not affected by either hedonic reasons or utilitarian\nreasons. This finding has significant implication for service\nproviders who invest millions of dollars in broadband ser-\nvices to satisfy the consumers' emotional needs and pleasur-\nable experiences. This finding is in contrast to experiences of\ndeveloped nations, such as South Koreas and the United\nKingdom, that successfully promoted and increased broad-\nband adoption in the country by utilizing online games, real-\ntime sport events, and on-demand video or music to attract\nconsumers to subscribe to broadband (H. Lee, O'Keefe, &\nYun, 2003). The authorities or industry players in developing\nnations may need to revisit this strategy of providing enter-\ntainment-based products in their particular national context\nto find out what application or content consumers prefer to\nsubscribe to broadband.\nFrom our results, SO exhibits significant relationships on\nintention to use broadband services. No previous study\nincluded this construct in their research model. The finding\nsuggests consumers believe that use of broadband services\nenhance their social status. Combining this finding with the\nfinding on RI and SI, we could explain by saying that con-\nsumers probably do not trust the information provided by\nreference groups but believe that use of broadband Internet is\nan aid to enhance their social status. This suggests that broad-\nband Internet has a strong social connection with respect to\nconsumer preferences. This has significant implication for\nbroadband service providers. Service providers may need to\nstrengthen the brand image of their broadband services.\nThe non-significant relationship between RA and con-\nsumers' intention to adopt broadband is a significant shift\nbecause previous literature has consistently showed strong\npositive influence of RA on broadband adoption (Dwivedi,\nTornatzky & Klein, 1982). Broadband service providers in\ndeveloping countries have been focusing on providing their\ncustomers various advantages as compared with traditional\ndial-up connection (such as faster downloads, instant com-\nmunication, always-on connectivity). The finding of this\nresearch suggests that perception of broadband is becoming\nless important as an aid to speed up the overall broadband\nadoption process. Service providers should not put too much\nemphasis on emphasizing broadband benefits to increase\nbroadband adoption by consumers.\nA significant positive relationship of SE with BIs was\nexpected as mentioned by previous literature (Dwivedi et al.,\n2006; LaRose, Gregg, Strover, Straubhaar, & Carpenter,\n2007). With higher level of confidence in technology, con-\nsumers are more likely to adopt broadband. The industry\nTable 12.

It appears that most consumers already possess the req-\nuisite knowledge and skills to adopt broadband services.\nCurrently, the government of India is following a push strat-\negy by providing more facilitating infrastructure, such as\nskill-oriented courses, to motivate consumers learn and use\nnew technologies such as broadband Internet. The research\nfindings suggest that governments and industry players may\nneed to revisit this strategy to make it meaningful for con-\nsumers and to increase broadband adoption.\nFrom our results, knowledge (K) did not exhibit signifi-\ncant relationships on intention to use broadband services. It\nis in contrast with previous studies (Choudrie & Lee, 2004;\nDwivedi, Khoumbati, Williams, & Lal, 2007)) that showed a\nsignificant relation of knowledge (K) with BI. PE exhibited\nsignificant relationship on intention to use broadband ser-\nvices. It was expected as suggested by previous literature\n(Dwivedi, Khan, & Papazafeiropoulou, 2007).\nFor knowledge (K), the consumers appear familiar in\nusing computer and Internet technologies. The government\nof India has taken many initiatives to boost computer learn-\ning. This finding suggests that the computer learning initia-\ntivesneedtobefurtheremphasizedbyeducationalinstitutions\n(such as schools and universities) by offering different vari-\neties of computer learning programs that best suit consumer\nneeds. For PE, it could be explained that Indian consumers\nmay lack the knowledge and skill to use Internet technolo-\ngies. If we combine it with the finding on knowledge (K), a\nfurther explanation could be that even if the consumers feel\nthat they have the requisite knowledge to use Internet tech-\nnologies, they tend to have less desire in adopting new tech-\nnologies and this may prove to be a barrier in using the\nparticular services. Interestingly, this finding is in contrast\nwith B. Anderson's (2008) study of European broadband\nconsumers. B. Anderson found that those users who had the\nknowledge and experience of using broadband were most\nbenefited with broadband Internet, whereas those who lack\nthe skills, knowledge, and perhaps self-confidence were left\nfurther behind. Therefore, successful broadband adoption\nrequires further motivation of consumers about broadband\nusage and benefits to develop their positive attitudes toward\nbroadband adoption and use.\nFrom our results, SQ exhibits significant relationships on\nintention to use broadband services. This is in line with the\nprevious study of the KSA (Dwivedi & Weerakkody, 2007).\nOne reason could be that in the KSA, only one service pro-\nvider provides broadband services and consumers have no\nliberty of switching in case of dissatisfaction with the ser-\nvice. In India, many broadband service providers are offering\ndifferent packages to different consumer segments. The\nswitching costs are low and consumers switch quickly if they\nare not satisfied with a service provider. In the past 5 years,\nmany service providers, especially in the wireless Internet\nservices, have emerged and created challenges to improve\ncompetitiveness among service providers by providing better\nquality of broadband services. To develop knowledge-based\nsocieties in developing countries, it is imperative to improve\nquality of broadband services.\nConclusion and Implications\nPractical Implications\nThis study contributes in several ways to the research litera-\nture. At a methodological level, this study proposes and tests\na new model for broadband adoption in a developing country\nperspective. Furthermore, it contributes to the ongoing\nsearch for policies that are more effective and strategies to\nincrease broadband penetration by providing a more detailed\nexamination of factors that possibly influence broadband\nadoption by household consumers. In line with other recent\nstudies, we find that broadband penetration is positively\ninfluenced by broadband SQ, knowledge (K), and RA. In\naddition, this study identified a new construct SO, which is\npositively related with broadband adoption by household\nconsumers.\nThe findings of this study generate a number of issues that\nmay be helpful for various stakeholders in Indian broadband\nservices, namely, service providers, policy makers, regula-\ntors, academia, general public, and so on, for informed deci-\nsion making and developing a strategy for accelerated\nbroadband diffusion in India. This informed decision making\nis important due to the established positive impact of\nincreased broadband deployment on economic development\nof a country (Bauer, Madden, & Morey, 2014; Ng, Lye, &\nThe gradual adoption of broadband by the consumers in\ndeveloping countries is a concern for both the industry and\ngovernment due to the strong positive impact of broadband\ndeployment on national economic development. Therefore,\nthis research should offer a substantial contribution to all inter-\nested stakeholders including the ISPs and government.\nPractitioners could use the findings of this study when revising\nand restructuring their marketing strategy. Academicians\ncould use the findings of this research to enhance their knowl-\nedge of broadband adoption in a developing but fast emerging\neconomy. Such knowledge can provide a basis for further\nresearch in broadband adoption in other emerging economies.\nThis study provides useful guidelines for both ISPs and\npolicy makers to understand factors that can influence con-\nsumers' intention to adopt broadband technology. Service\nproviders and policy makers can use this study to get useful\nguidelines and improve their strategies of increasing broad-\nband Internet adoption rate. This research identifies many\nfactors that stakeholders need to focus on to attract more\nbroadband consumers.\nThe findings of this research suggest that RI and SI have\nno significant relationship with BI. RI has more significance\nthan SI. Taking this into account, service providers need to\nrethink their customer communication strategy to make it\nmore effective by creating a more effective impression\ntoward consumers. This is essential so that customers are\nattracted to spread positive word of mouth in their social\ncircles and attract more consumers toward broadband.\nThe significant influence of self-efficacy on the broad-\nband adoption among Indian consumers suggests that service\nproviders should invest in developing responsive and avail-\nable technical support (such as in the form of user manuals,\nlive streaming on the company website) to attract consumers\nwho are likely to learn and are confident in exploring the\nbroadband services.\nWith less significance attached to the RA, service provid-\ners need to think about some innovative RAs that broadband\ncan provide, for example, developing content that is specifi-\ncally available with broadband services. The more innova-\ntive benefits customers receive, the more likely they will\nsubscribe or use the broadband service.\nThe significance of SO suggests that service providers\nneed to think about ways to make their service a tool of social\nstatus enhancement, for example, by branding their service.\nIt is similar to what happened with the cellular phone in\ndeveloping countries. Initially, it was a communication\ndevice. Later on with proliferation of cellular phone devices,\nthe prices fell and everyone had access to a cellular phone.\nThe consumers started to make cellular phone a social status\nsymbol, for example, by buying expensive branded cellular\nphones.\nThe least significance attached to HO has a significant\nlearning for service providers. They need to look into HO\nfrom the consumers' perspective and provide those applica-\ntions to the consumers that could drive their adoption of\nbroadband. Enhancement and upgradation of broadband ser-\nvice may improve consumer experience with broadband ser-\nvices. Finally, the high significance attached to the FCR\nsuggests the need for service providers to invest more on\nproviding customer-centric services.\nTheoretical Contributions\nThis research, with its advanced and progressive standpoint,\ndiffers from previous research on broadband adoption. This\nresearch is similar to the work done by Venkatesh and Brown\n(2001). However, it differs in that it found subjective norm a\nnon-significant determinant of broadband adoption. Tan and\nfactors essential for technology adoption. Both studies found\nthat attitudinal and control factors were highly significant\npredictors of technology adoption or non-adoption. On simi-\nlar lines, this research found that subjective norm was a non-\nsignificant predictor of broadband adoption by Indian\nhouseholds. Anchor also suggested the differences between\nthe critical barriers for e-commerce adoption and adoption of\ncomputers in U.S. households (Venkatesh & Brown, 2001).\nBy examining the relationships between BI to adopt\nbroadband and the 14 constructs, this research provides an\nextended model based on three previous models. The model\nused in this research provides a greater understanding of con-\nsumers' adoption of broadband in a developing country con-\ntext. India is a fast growing Southeast Asian nation where\nconsumers still value their traditions despite becoming urban\nand technology savvy.\nLimitation and Future Studies\nEvery research has its limitations and this research is no\nexception. First, this study used a larger snowball sample\nsize but it does not ensure the homogeneity of target respon-\ndents. Therefore, the results obtained may not be generalized\nfor the population of India as a whole. Future research on\nbroadband adoption may emphasize considering a cross-\ncountry or cross-cultural survey. Second, the study was con-\nducted in four major cities of India. The findings may not be\napplicable across geographies and cultures. However, con-\nsidering the embryonic stage of development of broadband\nin India, the selected cities still represent a good sample to\ninvestigate broadband adoption in India. Third, the study did\nnot supplement the survey-based approach with interviews\nto have longitudinal data. Future research can use a longitu-\ndinal data collection mechanism to generate better statistical\nresults. Fourth, this study did not take into account the cor-\nrelation of factors and effect on others. Future research may\nconsider including some moderating constructs to examine\nthe inter-relationships among various factors affecting BI.\nThis research identified five factors--PE, SO, SQ, FCR,\nand SE--that influence consumers'adoption of broadband in\nIndia. Therefore, the first research question has been veri-\nfied. From the analysis done, it has been proven that PE has\nthe most significant impact on BI to adopt broadband.\nTherefore, the second research question has been verified.\nIn summary, this research provides stakeholders of the\nbroadband industry some very useful guidelines that would\nbe helpful when industries plan to expand and provide high-\nquality beneficial broadband services to the consumers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nABIresearch.
