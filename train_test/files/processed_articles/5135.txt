Although still a relatively young academic discipline, in less\nthan 20 years it has penetrated virtually every existing branch of psychology, including\nsocial, organizational, cognitive, developmental, clinical and environmental psychology\nevolutionary theory is a `single seamless framework' capable of spanning disciplinary\nEvolutionary psychology in the modern world\ndivides. On this basis, Darwin's vision of evolutionary theory providing a new foundation\nfor psychology appears to be finally reaching fruition.\nHowever, while there is no doubting the power of evolutionary theory in helping to\nexplain human behavior, concerted effort to apply this knowledge in practical ways has so\nfar been less evident than one might expect (but see, for example, approaches in\nGriskevicius, Cantu, and van Vugt, 2012; Roberts, 2012; Roberts, Miner, and Shackelford,\n2010; van Vugt, Hogan, and Kaiser, 2008). We believe this is about to change. The\nrenowned psychologist Kurt Lewin once noted that \"there is nothing so practical as a good\ntheory.\" Evolutionary perspectives should therefore have the potential to provide a\npowerful framework for developing practical applications in many and varied aspects of\nhuman behavior and endeavor. A growing community of researchers is interested in\npursuing this cause, and with some success as this special issue shows.\nThis is not to say that evolutionary psychology is going to be the panacea to cure all\nailments in the human condition. Researchers in other fields can and do approach the same\naspects of behavior and tackle the same issues, without reference to evolution, and meet\nconsiderable success in developing interventions that have considerable practical value. In\nTinbergen's (1963) terminology, they tend to do this at the proximate level of explanation,\nunderstanding immediate cause and effect. However, we would argue that insights into the\nselective forces that shaped behavior in the past (that is, working at the ultimate level of\nexplanation), and mismatches between ancestral conditions and those we experience today,\nprovide a fundamentally important context and backdrop to complement and inform such\nefforts. Full understanding of selection pressures shaping specific behaviors requires\nconsideration of both proximate and ultimate factors (e.g., Nettle, 2011; Tinbergen, 1963).\nParallels with the Development of Darwinian Medicine\nWe thus take the view that understanding the evolutionary history or likely adaptive\nvalue of particular behaviors should be useful in developing novel approaches or in\nspecifying which of a range of possible interventions might have most value in targeting\nparticular outcomes. In this respect, we have argued (Roberts, 2012) that the utility of\napplied evolutionary psychology in addressing societal issues like tackling prejudice or\npromoting cooperation (traditionally the reserves of social psychologists or economists)\nbears close resemblance to the contribution that Darwinian medicine offers conventional\nmedicine. In the twenty or so years following `The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine'\n(Williams and Nesse, 1991), the field has contributed enormously to our understanding of\nhuman illness and in some cases has transformed it (for recent reviews, see Nesse and\nTake, for example, symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, which affects\nup to 90% of pregnant women in some modern societies (Pepper and Roberts, 2006). As\nepitomized by its epithets `pregnancy sickness' or `morning sickness', this was until\nrecently viewed as an illness for which treatment would be desirable. However, according\nto one functional (ultimate) explanation, these symptoms reflect a classic evolutionary\nstruggle - parent-offspring conflict, or the non-overlapping interests of mother and embryo\nEvolutionary psychology in the modern world\n(Haig, 1998). Another view is that these symptoms, along with specific aversions to\nparticular kinds of food, arise as an adaptation to avoid ingestion of teratogens and\nphytochemicals that may harm the health of the mother and foetus (Flaxman and Sherman,\n2000). In fact, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester are now viewed as indicative of a\nhealthy embryo, associated with a range of positive pregnancy outcomes (Weigel and\nWeigel, 1989). The evolutionary perspective has helped to change the perception of this\ncondition, and the old epithets are now considered to be misnomers.\nHowever, in spite of this, acceptance of these insights in conventional medicine has\nyet to live up to its potential. Researchers often face skepticism or indifference from\npractitioners, and few medical courses devote more than one or two lectures to evolutionary\nmedicine. It remains the case that most researchers - and there is a rapidly growing number\nof them - come from an evolutionary background, rather than a clinical one. Even in a field\nwith direct and potentially enormous impact on human health, it seems that it will take time\nto fulfill its promise and to persuade practitioners of the merits of evolutionarily-informed\napproaches.\nThere is an analogy between evolutionary medicine and an applied evolutionary\npsychology. Despite its promise for transforming our understanding of modern world\nissues and problems, perhaps especially social problems, the evolutionary approach is\nsometimes met with antipathy or indifference from colleagues in other branches of\npsychology and those from sociology, anthropology and the like. Indeed, evolutionary\npsychology probably suffers this to an even greater extent than Darwinian medicine, which\nat least has near-unanimous support within evolutionary biology and a developing portfolio\nof convincing empirical studies (Nesse and Stearns, 2008; Stearns, 2012; Stearns and\nKoella, 2007; Trevathan et al., 2007). Furthermore, evolutionary psychology arguably lags\nbehind evolutionary medicine in the extent to which a core body of researchers exists that\nactively seeks and develops applications of their research. With some notable exceptions,\nconcerted effort to apply principle to practice remains patchy. Perhaps this is appropriate to\na young discipline, but one would expect that, as it matures, its scope will broaden towards\ntackling contemporary problems in human society. For this reason, we recently organized a\nwide-ranging seminar series (funded by the UK Economic Social and Research Council),\nentitled Darwin's Medicine, with a series of workshops each devoted to an applied\nevolutionary psychology theme such as philanthropy, sustainability, leadership, and\nintergroup conflict. Other recent developments include the formation of the Applied\nEvolutionary Psychology Society (www.aepsociety.org) and the publication of a dedicated\nThe Benefits of Application\nWe do not expect, of course, that researchers should focus on application to the\nexclusion of further development, refinement and testing of evolutionary theory as it\napplies to human behaviour. Nor do we think that working on application is necessarily for\neveryone. However, we think it is inevitable that interest in harnessing evolutionary\nperspectives to address current social and societal issues is set to become much more\ncommon. There are at least three reasons why we think this.\nEvolutionary psychology in the modern world\nThe first reason is that many researchers may feel they have a moral imperative to\ndo so. If, as evolutionary psychologists, we claim to have a particularly powerful\ntheoretical framework with which to understand human behaviour, then, as the expression\ngoes, we should be able to `put our money where our mouth is' and put this to good use. A\nsense that we want to employ our science for good is relevant to any application, insight or\nperspective\nThe second reason is more pragmatic. An applied perspective will help to develop\nthe impact of evolutionary psychology research. We live in a society that is increasingly\ncurious and informed about scientific results, and that wishes (and, increasingly, expects) to\nsee the potential benefits of research that they, as taxpayers, effectively fund.\nDemonstrating how research, theoretical or applied, might lead to practical benefits for\nsociety at large is therefore of growing relevance to funding agencies. For example, the\nNational Science Foundation in the US uses the term `broader impacts' as one of its two\ncriteria of merit in judging research proposals (the other being `intellectual merit'). In the\nUK, research councils also incorporate impact as a criterion used in the assessment of\nfunding applications, defining impact as including `the demonstrable contribution that\nexcellent research makes to society and the economy\", and includes ways that research may\nfoster global economic performance, increase the effectiveness of public services and\npolicy, and enhance quality of life, health and creativity.\nLast but certainly not least, developing applications and practical approaches to\nspecific problems provides an intellectual challenge that is different to, but arguably no less\nstimulating than theory development. It should not be seen as a `soft option', at least not if\nit is to be done well. A successful application requires sound knowledge of theory, but\nbecause it must also seek to ground theory within the complexity of the `real world,' it also\nnecessitates an ability to test the robustness of effects in a noisy environment and within a\nbroader interdisciplinary perspective (see Buunk and van Vugt, 2007; Klatzky, 2009).\nFurthermore, this process may throw up unexpected results and generate new questions and\ndirections for research back in the lab, or even suggest that the theory itself requires\namendment. In this way, the pathway from theory to application is not unidirectional, but\ncircular. For many, this may be the most persuasive reason to develop applications of their\nown research.\nPractical Issues in Developing Applied Perspectives\nAlthough we believe that applying evolutionary psychology holds great promise,\nthere are some potential caveats. The first is to ensure that we really understand the\nproblem at hand. By this we mean thinking beyond the evolutionary arguments and theory\nwith which we may be familiar to analyze a particular problem within its broader context,\ncarefully considering and incorporating viewpoints and contributions from other\ndisciplines. This may seem trivial and obvious, but consider as an analogy two cautionary\ntales. One comes from the introduction of non-native species into new habitats, where an\napparently straightforward solution to a practical problem can lead to unforeseen new\nproblems. For example, a new predator might be introduced to control a pernicious pest,\nbut the new predator also eats other desirable and non-pest species. Or take another\nEvolutionary psychology in the modern world\nexample from evolutionary medicine. Williams and Nesse (1991) highlight, as one of a\nnumber of examples of the importance of evolutionary explanations to augment the `treat-\nthe-symptom' approach of conventional medicine, the way that fever is treated. If fever is\nan evolutionarily-derived response mechanism to combat bacterial toxins, then treating\nfever may well be counter-productive; they cite as evidence a study that found longer\nrecovery times from chicken pox in patients treated with acetaminophen compared to those\ntreated with a placebo (Doran, De Angelis, Baumgardner and Mellits, 1989). These\nexamples serve as cautions in thinking about practical applications of evolutionary\npsychology, and should make us think hard about the context of the issue, although it\nshould not discourage us from engaging with it.\nSecond, evolutionary psychologists are often accused of arguing that our underlying\nhuman nature dictates how things `should' be, that what is natural is good. This argument is\nknown as the naturalistic fallacy. Typically, this accusation comes from critics outside the\nfield and is based on misinterpretation of the presented arguments, although it is not\nunknown for even well-informed researchers to slip into committing this error. Committing\nthe naturalistic fallacy, or of being perceived to, is probably more likely than ever when\nseeking evolutionarily-informed solutions or applications to practical issues. While it may\nsometimes be the case that what is natural is in fact good, this is not always the case. In\ndeveloping applied perspectives on our work, we should bear this in mind, remaining\ndetached from judgments of value and morality.\nNew Directions\nThis special issue, entitled \"Evolutionary Psychology in the Modern World:\nApplications, Perspectives, and Strategies,\" brings together contributions which introduce\nnew approaches to thinking about application. The contributions vary widely in scope and\nconstitute a very diverse range of interest areas. Fitzgerald and Danner open the issue with\na review of how knowledge of evolutionary psychology might inform the design of the\nworkplace environment to the benefit of employee health and happiness. They argue that\nthis would ultimately benefit the employer through increased productivity from the\nworkforce and associated decrease in other costs. Staying within the workplace, Little and\nRoberts investigate the effects of appearance on success at work. They review recent\nstudies that show how appearance can influence perception of potential employees at\ninterview, discuss the implications of these results in the light of equality legislation and\nconsider cases where discrimination on the basis of appearance might be legitimate and\nuncontroversial, including the perception of political candidates and influence on voter's\nbehavior. Petersen and Aar\u00f8e also discuss perception of political candidature within an\nevolutionary framework, within a wider consideration of the ways in which modern mass\npolitics succeeds or fails in eliciting expected levels of engagement given its social nature\nand our affinity as a social species for social interaction and processes underpinning group\ndynamics.\nSeveral papers address evolutionary perspectives applied to health and health-\nrelated behavior. Buunk, Zurriaga and Gonz\u00e1lez examine perceptions of reciprocity and\nindebtedness in patients suffering from spinal cord injury from the perspective of reciprocal\nEvolutionary psychology in the modern world\naltruism. They show how, surprisingly, lack of reciprocity from close relatives and partners\nmay affect depression more than non-relatives. Gillette and Folinsbee explore evolutionary\napproaches to reproductive health, focusing on effects of early menarche on subsequent\nreproductive health and health of offspring and its implications for public health.\nWhitehead, Ozakinci and Perrett apply insights from evolutionary psychology, specifically\nperception of an individual's health through carotenoid-linked skin coloration, and its\nassociated effects on interpersonal judgments, to design a novel intervention to improve\ndietary health. Finally, Tybur, Bryan and Caldwell Hooper describe ways in which\nevolutionary perspectives might be used to approach challenges faced by health\npsychologists. They discuss how evolutionary insights reveal why healthy behavior is less\ncommon than we might expect, how individuals differ in this regard and why this matters,\nand how evolutionary approaches can help to both identify particular target groups and\nfine-tune interventions in order to maximize effectiveness.\nFinally, various articles address evolutionary approaches to other societal issues.\nBarclay explores the promotion of cooperative sentiment within societies, and describes\nways in which new insights into the power of reputation in promoting cooperation and\nreducing conflict might be harnessed across a range of applied settings. The paper by\nIngram, Campos, Hondrou, Vasalou, Martinho and Joinson considers a related theme: how\nto reduce conflict in children? They describe an evolutionarily-informed game designed to\nhelp children learn conflict resolution skills. In a change of tack, Oesch and Miklousic then\nconsider the growth of the modern dating industry and analyze its marketing strategies\nagainst the background of recent research on the evolutionary psychology of courtship.\nFinally, Brooks describes the issue of population-level sex ratio bias in certain countries in\nthe light of parental investment theory. He argues that evolutionary psychology can\nprovide, along with an eye on cultural history and rapidly changing economic\ncircumstances, more detailed understanding of why and how these biases occur, and\nperhaps a framework for reducing their most severe consequences.\nSummary\nWe have drawn parallels between applied evolutionary psychology and Darwinian\nmedicine, both in their enormous potential for contributing to application and in the uphill\nchallenge both fields face to persuade practitioners of their intellectual and practical value.\nWe also described applied evolutionary psychology as lagging behind Darwinian medicine\nin terms of persuading even evolutionary-minded researchers in biology (let alone other\npsychologists, anthropologists and the like) and in being represented by a group of\nresearchers interested in the practical application of their research. However, we anticipate\nthat this may be beginning to change, and we hope that the articles in this special issue\nprovide further stimulus to the nascent field of applied evolutionary psychology.\nReferences\nBarclay, P.
