For\nthat reason, in patients taking topiramate\nand undergoing craniotomy, documenting\nthe metabolic status is important.\nDespite the importance of this effect of\ntopiramate on metabolic status, topiramate-\nrelated metabolic acidosis has been reported\nin few adult patients, and there are only\nlimited prospective studies in the litera-\nture.6\u00ad10 Only one of these studies is in\nneurosurgical patients, and it retrospectively\nreported the results of blood gas analysis in\nsix patients.10 Therefore, we designed this\nprospective cross-sectional analysis to deter-\nmine the frequency and severity of metabolic\nacidosis, determined through blood gas\nanalysis, in patients taking topiramate who\nwere being prepared for elective craniotomy.\nPatients and methods\nyears) who were taking topiramate and\nplanning to undergo elective craniotomy.\nAll patients gave written informed consent,\nand the study was approved by the institu-\ntional ethics committee.\nWe excluded patients with diabetes melli-\ntus, diabetes insipidus, or hepatic or renal\ndisease, and any patient taking other medi-\ncations likely to cause metabolic acidosis.\nThe demographic data for each patient were\nrecorded, and any signs of metabolic acid-\nosis or topiramate-related side effects were\ninvestigated (e.g., dizziness, drowsiness,\nheadache, somnolence, memory problems,\nor paraesthesia). Each patient's respiratory\nrate was measured at rest and recorded. A\nhigh respiratory rate was described as more\nthan 20 breaths per minute at rest. The\nresults of routine blood chemistry tests were\nalso recorded. These included liver and renal\nfunction tests, total protein, albumin, elec-\ntrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, mag-\nnesium, and calcium), serum osmolality,\nhaemoglobin. Urine analysis results were\nalso recorded. Baseline arterial blood gas\nlevels, including lactate, were obtained at the\ntime of admission (Roche OMNI S,\nMannheim, Germany). The severity of\nmetabolic acidosis was defined according\nto base excess (BE) levels: a BE from \u00c03 to\n\u00c05 indicated mild acidosis, a BE from \u00c05 to\n\u00c010 indicated moderate acidosis, and a BE\nlevel below \u00c010 indicated severe acidosis.\nPatients on topiramate with moderate\nacidosis were switched to another anti-\nepileptic drug. If the acidosis resolved\nwithin 2 \u00ad 4 days of discontinuing topir-\namate therapy, patients were scheduled for\nsurgery. If the acidosis did not resolve, the\nBE was replaced with bicarbonate therapy.\nSeverely acidotic patients with clinical symp-\ntoms were treated with bicarbonate.\nSPSS for Windows version 16.0 was used\nfor statistical analysis, and the results were\nexpressed as the mean \u00c6 standard deviation\n(SD). All variables were tested for normal\ndistribution using the Shapiro\u00adWilk test.\nCorrelations between the variables were\nanalyzed with Spearman's rho correlation\ntest and one-way analysis of variance. A\nP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe demographic characteristics, topira-\nmate dosages, concomitant antiepileptic\ntherapies, topiramate-related side effects,\nand surgical pathologies appear in Table 1.\nBlood chemistry results were within the\nnormal range in all patients, but blood gas\nTu\nanalysis showed metabolic acidosis in 71%\n(n \u00bc 57) of patients.

There was no correlation between\nthe frequency of these side effects and the\nseverity of metabolic acidosis (p > 0.05), or\nbetween the duration of topiramate use and\nthe severity of metabolic acidosis (p > 0.05).\nFor patients with moderate acidosis\n(n \u00bc 45), topiramate therapy was discontin-\nued and the side effects resolved in 2\u00ad4 days.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the frequency of topiramate-\nrelated metabolic acidosis was 71%.\nAmong these patients with metabolic acid-\nosis, 56% had moderate acidosis that\nresolved 2\u00ad4 days after the discontinuation\nof topiramate therapy.\nMetabolic acidosis is a life-threatening\ncomplication of the perioperative period.5\nTable 1.

Patients with\nmild acidosis present no symptoms, however,\nand this absence of relevant clinical symptoms\nrenders it more difficult to recognize the\nproblem without blood gas analysis.\nIn a systematic review of topiramate use,\nDell'Orto and colleagues concluded that\ntopiramate is associated with mild to mod-\nerate hypochloraemic metabolic acidosis.12\nTopiramate can weakly inhibit carbonic\nanhydrase, which may lead to hypochlor-\naemic metabolic acidosis, most likely from\nrenal tubular acidosis rather than from a\nmore central mechanism.9,12 Only three\nstudies (with small sample numbers) and a\nfew case reports have documented the fre-\nquency of topiramate-related metabolic side\nDespite the many reports describing the\nphenomenon in paediatric patients, the lit-\nerature includes only one report of meta-\nbolic acidosis related to topiramate therapy\nin adult neurosurgical patients.10 That study\nincluded only six blood samples after the\ninduction of anesthesia.10 The authors retro-\nspectively reported that metabolic acidosis\noccurred in 60% of patients taking topir-\namate in their case series. However, they\ncollected the data retrospectively, after\nanaesthesia, and their series is a small\nsample size. They recommend that patients\nwho take topiramate should be asked about\nsymptoms during the preoperative evalu-\nation and that blood gas analysis should be\nroutinely performed before patients undergo\nsurgical procedures.10 To date, our series is\nthe largest to document metabolic disturb-\nances related to topiramate in a surgical\nAlthough increased respiratory rate is a\nsign of acidosis, it appears only in patients\nwith moderate to severe acidosis and cannot\nbe detected easily. There are different\nreports of the time required for serum\ncarbon dioxide levels to return to normal\nafter topiramate is discontinued.9 In our\nseries, 10% of patients had increased respir-\nation and blood gases normalized in 2\u00ad4\ndays in most patients after topiramate was\ndiscontinued, a finding that reflects those\nreported in the literature.9\nIn conclusion, the results of this prospect-\nive study suggest that, in patients receiving\ntopiramate, preoperative evaluation should\ninclude the consideration of metabolic acid-\nosis. Baseline blood gas levels can be\nobtained to confirm the presence and sever-\nity of metabolic acidosis.\n"
