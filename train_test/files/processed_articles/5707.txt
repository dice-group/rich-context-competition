Blood samples were taken preoperatively\nand at 1 day, 1 week and 3 weeks after surgery for the measurement of the white blood cell count,\nserum C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and HMGB1.\nResults: Data from 21 patients were analysed. HMGB1 levels changed significantly during the\nsurgical course, increasing from a preoperative median of 6.8 ng/ml to 12.1 ng/ml at 1 day\npostoperatively, and then decreasing to 8.1 ng/ml at 1 week postoperatively and 4.0 ng/ml at\n3 weeks postoperatively. These changes were similar to but were not completely correlated with\nthe changes seen in the other markers.\nConclusion: Serum HMGB1 may be a potential marker to monitor the surgical course in patients\nundergoing surgery for CRC, although further studies are warranted before it can be introduced\ninto routine clinical practice.\n",

Suda\net al.15 reported on its use in monitoring\npatients after oesophagectomy for oesopha-\ngeal cancer,15 whereas Takahata et al.16\nstudied changes in HMGB1 after gastro-\nintestinal surgery in patients with various\ncancers of the gastrointestinal tract, includ-\ning CRC.16 The value of monitoring\nHMGB1 in patients undergoing surgery for\nCRC is still unknown, and the behaviour of\nHMGB1 levels in a normal surgical course in\npatients with CRC needs to be determined.\nThe present study aimed to obtain data on\nthe changes in HMGB1 levels in patients with\nadvanced CRC following elective colorectal\nsurgery without postoperative complications,\nwith reference to concomitant changes in\nconventional markers such as WBC count,\nCRP and SAA.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients with advanced CRC diagnosed by\nsystemic imaging and histological examin-\nation who were scheduled to receive open\ncolorectal surgery at Jichi Medical University,\nPatients requiring emergency surgery and\nthose who developed postoperative infections\nsuch as pneumonia or peritonitis or in whom\nthe CRC lesions could not be resected were\nexcluded from the study. Patients in whom\nblood samples could not be taken at the four\ntime points (preoperatively, 1 day postopera-\ntively, 1 week postoperatively and 3 weeks\npostoperatively) were also excluded.\nAll patients gave written informed con-\nsent and the study protocol was approved\nby the Ethics Committee of Jichi Medical\nUniversity.\nMeasurement of HMGB1 levels\nAt the four time points, venous blood was\ncollected from each patient into tubes con-\ntaining ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid\ndipotassium salt for the WBC counts and\ntubes without anticoagulant for serum sep-\naration. WBC counts were measured using a\nCoulter LH780 device (Beckman Coulter\nCorp., Tokyo, Japan). The blood collected\nfor serum measurements was centrifuged at\nSerum CRP and SAA levels were measured\nusing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\n(Eiken Chemical Corp., Tokyo, Japan)\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSerum HMGB1 levels were also measured\nusing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (Shino-Test Corp., Kanagawa, Japan)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions.17 Coefficient variations in the measure-\nments for each marker were <5%.\nStatistical analyses\nResults were given as the mean \u00c6 SD or the\nmedian and interquartile range. Repeated\nmeasures analysis of variance with multi-\ncomparison tests was used to analyse the\nchanges in each marker. Relationships\nbetween the changes in the different markers\nwere analysed using the Pearson correlation\ntest. WBC counts and CRP, SAA and\nHMGB1 levels were log-transformed\nbefore analysis.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). A P-value < 0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 23 patients were initially eligible\nfor the study; however, two patients devel-\noped postoperative complications, leaving a\ntotal of 21 patients for inclusion in the data\nanalysis. Of these, 17 were male and four\nwere female, with a mean \u00c6 SD age of\nwith an unremarkable surgical course.

In the phase from\npresurgery to 1 day postoperatively, there\nwas a mildly positive but insignificant cor-\nrelation between the changes in HMGB1\nand the other three markers. In the phase\nfrom 1 day postoperatively to 1 week\npostoperatively, the changes in HMGB1\nwere significantly and positively correlated\nwith changes in the WBC count and SAA\nlevels, while there was a mildly positive but\ninsignificant correlation between the changes\nin HMGB1 and CRP levels. In the phase\nfrom 1 week postoperatively to 3 weeks post-\noperatively, there was a mildly positive but\ninsignificant correlation between the changes\nin HMGB1 and SAA levels, while there were\nno apparent correlations between the\nchanges in HMGB1 and the changes in the\nWBC count and CRP levels.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, the serum levels of\nHMGB1 significantly changed over the\ncourse of a normal surgical period in patients\nwith advanced CRC undergoing elective\ncolorectal open surgery, with the highest\nlevels being seen from 1 day postoperatively\nto 1 week postoperatively. The changes in\nHMGB1 appeared to be similar but not\nidentical to the changes in other conventional\nmarkers. These results help to clarify the\nbehaviour of HMGB1 levels during a normal\ncolorectal surgical period and further support\nthe consideration of HMGB1 as a marker for\nmonitoring the surgical course in patients\nTable 2.

In patients who\nunderwent oesophagectomy without compli-\ncations, the peak HMGB1 level was observed\n2\u00ad3 days postoperatively, with the level then\ngradually decreasing until 1 week postopera-\ntively,15 whereas the peak HMGB1 level was\nseen 3 days postoperatively followed by a\ngradual decrease until 1 week postoperatively\nin patients undergoing surgery for gastro-\nintestinal tract cancer.16 These results\ntogether with those of the present study\nsuggest that the trends in the changes to\nHMGB1 levels may be consistent, even\nthough the degree of surgical invasiveness\nand the cancer patient populations are dif-\nferent. Confirmation of these findings would\nbe of value in considering the possible use of\nHMGB1 for monitoring the surgical course\nin patients with CRC.\nThe correlations seen between the changes\nin HMGB1 and those in other conventional\nmarkers are also of interest. Given that the\nconventional markers are more typically used\nto monitor inflammatory conditions, they\nwould not be expected to tightly correlate\nwith HMGB1 under conditions with no\napparent postsurgical inflammation.10 The\nchanges seen in the conventional markers\nmeasured in the present study can be\nexplained by their different responses to\ninvasive stress.4 The WBC count is known\nto show a rapid increase and then decrease in\nthe early stages of a postsurgical course,4\nwhich was observed in the present study.\nWith regard to CRP, the narrow dynamic\nrange of CRP is a disadvantage when obser-\nving the changes during the surgical period;\nthe overall changes in CRP were barely\nsignificant in the present study. In contrast,\nSAA has a wide dynamic range,18 but the\nlarge inter-individual differences in SAA may\nmake it difficult to compare the surgical\ncourse between individuals. In the present\nstudy, mildly positive but insignificant cor-\nrelations between the changes in HMGB1\nand those of the conventional markers in the\nearly phase of the surgical course suggests\nthat the change in HMGB1 may have a\ndifferent origin to that of the other markers in\nthe immediate postoperative period. Mild-to-\nmoderate positive correlations between the\nchanges in HMGB1 and those of the con-\nventional markers, especially the WBC count\nand SAA levels, in the recovery stage (1 day\nto 1 week postoperatively) suggest similarity\nin the origin of the change in HMGB1 with\nthat of the other markers at this stage. In the\nstable stage (1week to 3 weeks postopera-\ntively), an insignificant but mildly positive\ncorrelation was found between the changes in\nHMGB1 and SAA. Throughout the entire\nsurgical course, the changes in HMGB1 were\nclosest to the changes in SAA out of the\nconventional markers studied, although this\ncorrelation was not very strong. Clarification\nof the similarities and differences among\nthese markers merits further investigation\nfor establishing the application of HMGB1\nin the monitoring of patients with CRC\nundergoing surgery.\nThe present study has a number of limi-\ntations. The sample size was relatively small.\nThe study was preliminary in that it did not\ncompare the HMGB1 level among patients\nwith and without postsurgical complica-\ntions. The patient population could not be\nassessed in terms of the extent of surgical\ninvasiveness, as this is not evaluated in\nroutine clinical settings. These points\nshould be addressed in future studies.\nIn conclusion, in the present study serum\nHMGB1 levels significantly changed during\nthe normal surgical period in patients with\nadvanced CRC who received elective colo-\nrectal open surgery and were free of post-\nsurgical complications. The changes in\nHMGB1 were similar to, but not completely\ncorrelated with, those of other conventional\nmarkers. These results suggest the potential\nuse of HMGB1 levels to monitor the surgi-\ncal course in patients undergoing surgery for\nCRC, although further studies are war-\nranted before it can be introduced into\nroutine clinical practice.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported in part by JSPS\nReferences\n1.
