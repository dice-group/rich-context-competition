This is due to the fact that such models cannot\nproperly account for the tendency of large negative asset returns to occur simultaneously \u00ad\nthe property of the joint distribution of asset returns called in statistical terms lower tail\ndependence. Therefore, the probability of joint default events and, in turn, extreme portfolio\nlosses is underestimated. It follows that an extensive utilisation of Gaussian models in risk\nmanagement can be seen as one of the determinants of a massive capital shortfall in the\nfinancial sector during the recent crisis. To address this issue, I elaborate a novel model of\ntail dependent asset returns exploiting the concept of nested Archimedean copulas.\nThe modelling approach presented in this paper has a number of technical merits which\nprovide it with a beneficial flexibility. I specify two dependence levels \u00ad sub-portfolios and the\nwhole portfolio \u00ad although the model can be extended to incorporate more than two levels.\nThis hierarchial dependence structure allows for a stronger dependence within appropriately\nspecified sub-portfolios (e.g. comprising obligors from a particular industry sector) than\nbetween them. This is a desirable property because companies in the same sector usually\nexhibit stronger dependence. The degree of dependence between the companies operating\nin different industry sectors is, however, lower but not zero because of the influence of a\ncommon macroeconomic environment. The model is also flexible enough for differentiated\ntreatment of different sub-portfolios, making it possible to cope with concentration risk.\nAnother advantage is that I avoid by construction built-in parameter restrictions which are\notherwise common in the specification of nested Archimedean copulas.\nFrom a computational point of view, the model benefits from a straightforward sampling\nprocedure involving only uniformly and gamma distributed variables. The corresponding\npseudo-random number generators are, in fact, standard in mathematical and statistical\npackages.\nApart from the technical features described, the suggested model could have implications\nfor risk controlling and banking regulation and, on a large scale, for financial stability. Because\nthis model takes account of the tail dependence of asset returns, its implementation would\nresult in a more conservative assessment of portfolio credit risk and, consequently, higher\neconomic and regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, the model is able to counter the\nsystematic underestimation of credit risk in the banking sector \u00ad one of the basic causes of\nthe recent financial turmoil.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nSowohl im akademischen Bereich als auch unter den Fachleuten der Finanzbranche und\nRegulierern wird vermehrt die Meinung vertreten, dass die auf Normalverteilungsannah-\nmen beruhenden Modelle sich nicht zur Risikomessung von Kreditportfolien oder portfo-\nliobasierten Kreditderivaten eignen. Solche Modelle ber\u00a8\nucksichtigen ausschlie\u00dflich lineare\nKorrelationen zwischen den Firmenwerten der Schuldner. Sie sind nicht in der Lage, die\ntendenziell gemeinsam auftretenden extremen Firmenwertverluste mehrerer Schuldner zu\nerkl\u00a8\naren, die zur H\u00a8\naufung von Kreditausf\u00a8\nallen in einem Portfolio f\u00a8\nuhren (\"lower tail de-\npendence\").

Im vorliegenden Papier\nwird ein stochastisches Modell f\u00a8\nur Firmenwertrenditen vorgestellt, das die Abh\u00a8\nangigkeit der\nunteren Verteilungsflanken ber\u00a8\nucksichtigt. Das Modell basiert auf dem Konzept verschachtel-\nter Archimedischer Copulas.\nDer hier vorgestellte Ansatz weist eine Reihe technischer Vorteile auf, die dem Modell einer-\nseits Flexibilit\u00a8\nat verleihen und andererseits seine Umsetzung erleichtern. Ich spezifiziere zwei\nAbh\u00a8\nangigkeitsebenen: die untere Subportfolio-Ebene und die obere Portfolioebene. Diese hi-\nerarchische Abh\u00a8\nangigkeitsstruktur hat den Vorteil, dass die Firmenwertrenditen von Schuld-\nnern, die ein und demselben Subportfolio zugewiesen sind, st\u00a8\narker voneinander abh\u00a8\nangen\nals die Firmenwertrenditen von Schuldnern aus unterschiedlichen Subportfolien.

Introduction\nInterdependent default events, when defaults of different counterparties tend to occur simul-\ntaneously, pose major challenges for an adequate assessment of credit risk in banks' lending\nportfolios. A prerequisite for estimation of the associated extreme losses is, therefore, a\nportfolio model capable of capturing dependence between rare events. Under the structural\napproach for credit risk modelling, a firm's failure results from the asset value of the firm\nfalling below the value of its outstanding debt. Due to this direct link between the default\nand asset value of a firm, interdependent default events can be modelled based on the joint\ndistribution of asset values or, equivalently, asset returns. Consequently, the tail dependence\nproperties of the joint distribution of asset returns would determine how frequently low-\nprobability events, such as the simultaneous defaults of several obligors, can actually occur.\nThis would eventually affect the amount of portfolio unexpected loss and the capital buffer\nrequired as protection against losses.\nThe above chain of reasoning demonstrates that using portfolio credit risk models with\nincorporated tail dependence can be crucial for a single bank's ability to remain solvent as\nwell as for the sustainability of an entire banking sector. In spite of that, Gaussian dependence\nstructures have been widely used by practitioners and regulators. Owing to a zero lower tail\ndependence coefficient, a Gaussian model generates joint defaults far too infrequently, leading\nto a systematic underestimation of portfolio credit risk and capital requirements and, in turn,\nendangering banks' solvency.\nTo address this issue, I put forward a novel model of asset returns which can be used for\nassessing portfolio credit risk under the structural approach. This model utilises the concept\nof nested Archimedean copulas.\nArchimedean copulas have been actively used in the portfolio risk modelling literature\nbecause they possess a simple explicit representation which can be easily extended to an\narbitrary number of dimensions. An important feature of various Archimedean copulas is\nthat they allow for tail dependence which does not have to be symmetric. A drawback,\nhowever, is the copula's invariance with respect to permutations of its arguments. The latter\n1Natalia Puzanova, Deutsche Bundesbank, Department of Financial Stability, Wilhelm-Epstein-Str. 14,\n60431 Frankfurt/Main, Germany, e-mail: natalia.puzanova@bundesbank.de.\nfeature is likely to be far too restrictive in a portfolio context, but can be overcome by a\nnesting procedure, as utilised in this paper.\nThe nested Archimedean copula described in this paper has two major advantages in terms\nof portfolio credit risk modelling: the lower tail dependence and the hierarchical dependence\nstructure. The first feature takes account of clustering default events. The latter allows for\nstronger default dependence within appropriately specified sub-portfolios (e.g. comprising\nobligors from a particular industry sector) than between them.2 It is a desirable property\nbecause companies in the same sector usually exhibit stronger dependence. The degree of\ndependence between the companies operating in different industry sectors is, however, lower\nbut not zero because of the influence of the common macroeconomic environment. The\nmagnitude of dependence parameters can also vary from one sub-portfolio to another so that\nthe model can cope with concentration risk.\nRegarding related literature, I refer to Embrechts et al. (2003), McNeil (2008) and Hofert\nand Scherer (2011) for more information on Archimedean copulas, nesting procedures and\ncompatibility conditions as well as on using nested copulas for credit risk assessment. In\nthe paper at hand, I modify the nesting procedure in a way which ensures by construction\nthe compatibility of copula generators and removes the usual restrictions on copula parame-\nters. From a computational point of view, this redefined nesting procedure makes sampling\nstraightforward. The work presented in this paper was part of my doctoral thesis published\nin (Puzanova, 2010). In parallel to that work Hering et al. (2010) developed a probabilistic\nmodel for construction nested Archimedean copulas using L\u00b4\nevy subordinators. I refer to the\nlatter paper for more general theoretical results on the redefined nesting procedure.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 outlines the credit portfolio\nsetting used in the paper. Section 3 presents the hierarchical Archimedean copula model.\nIn section 4, I apply this model to two hypothetical test portfolios in order to judge the\nmodel risk compared with a benchmark Gaussian specification. Finally, I summarise the\nmain results and draw conclusions in section 5.\n2. Portfolio setting\nI first define target variables which quantify credit risk at the portfolio level. In the tradition\nof the default-only credit risk models, I look at the distribution of the potential portfolio\nlosses at a one-year risk horizon, whereby the losses can only materialise when one or more\nborrowers go bankrupt. The portfolio loss, denoted PL, is a random variable which can be\ndefined as the sum over the individual losses Li\non every single exposure in the portfolio\n(one borrower - one exposure). A loss variable Li\nequals zero when the ith borrower survives\n2I specify two dependence levels \u00ad sub-portfolios and the whole portfolio \u00ad although the model can be\nextended to incorporate more than two levels.\nbeyond the risk horizon. Otherwise, when the borrower defaults on its obligations, Li\nequals\nthe expected amount of loss given default LGDi\n, i.e., the exposure to this borrower minus\nthe expected recovery. For the sake of convenience, I normalise the maximum total loss to\nunity so that an individual LGDi\nis given as a percentage of the total portfolio LGD.\nThe event of a borrower i's default is determined in the tradition of structural credit risk\nmodels by the standardised returns on the borrower's market value of asset Ri\ndropping below\nthe default threshold defined by the borrower's one-year probability of default PDi\n. The\ndefault threshold equals F-1\nRi\n(PDi\nRi\nbeing the quantile function of the random variable\nRi\n. The portfolio setting can be summarised as follows:\nPL :=\nn\nLi\n=\nn\nRi\n(PDi)\n(Ri\n(X) denotes an indicator function:\n(X) =\n\n\n\n1 for X  A,\n0 otherwise.\nWith regard to the distribution of the portfolio loss variable PL, I am looking for the\nValue at Risk at a pre-specified confidence level q (V aRq\n) and for the Expected Shortfall\n(ESq\n). VaR is commonly used in risk management and controlling as a measure of portfolio\ncredit risk, although it is incoherent (not sub-additive in general). It quantifies the minimum\nportfolio loss in the worst (1 - q) \u00d7 100 per cent of cases. V aRq\n(PL) equals the value of the\nquantile function of the random variable PL:\nV aRq\n(PL) := F-1\nPL\nES is a coherent risk measure which quantifies the expected portfolio loss in the worst (1-q)\u00d7\n(PL) equals the conditional tail expectation beyond the q-quantile\nof the portfolio loss distribution augmented by a discontinuity adjustment:\n(PL) := E PL | PL  V aRq\n(PL) +V aRq\n(PL)\u00b7\n1 - q - Pr {PL  V aRq\n(PL)}\n3. The hierarchical Archimedean copula model\nIn this section, I derive a probabilistic model for asset returns utilising nested Archimedean\ncopulas. I also give details on a particular specification based on a two-fold Gamma mixture\nof powers. I specify the hierarchical dependence structure in subsection 3.1 and investigate\nits properties in subsection 3.2. Subsequently, I provide an appropriate sampling algorithm\n3.1. Derivation of the copula\nThe portfolio dependence structure should be flexible enough to cope with sub-portfolios\nwhich exhibit different dependence properties. Within the scope of Archimedean copulas,\nthis aim can be achieved by utilising a nesting procedure so that the resulting hierarchcal\nArchimedean copula (HAC) would have the following general form\n, . . . , Cspm um1\n, . . . , umnm\n.\nThis is a copula model with two hierarchy levels. The copulas Cspj with j = 1, . . . , m at\nthe lower level of the hierarchy represent dependence functions of distinct groups of obligors.\nThere are m such groups or sub-portfolios each containing nj\nobligors with m\nnj\n= n.\nThose copulas specify the within-group dependence properties. At the top, portfolio level\nof the hierarchy, the copula Cp joins the sub-portfolios. This copula determines dependence\nproperties between distinct groups of obligors. The copula argument uji\nis defined in terms\nof the probability-integral transform uji\n:= FRji\n(Rji\n= xji\n) for the asset return of the obligor\ni in the sub-portfolio j.\nThe model should meet the following general requirements. For the purpose of portfolio\nrisk modeling, it is crucial that the copula allows for lower tail dependence. Moreover, the\nbetween-group dependence should logically be less strong than the within-group dependence.\nFor the sake of flexibility, the nesting procedure should not pose any technical restrictions on\nthe parameters of the copulas Cspj .\nAccording to Joe (1997, p. 86 ff.), an Archimedean copula arises from a mixture of powers.\nThe corresponding representation for the joint cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the\nasset return vector R is given by:\nFR\n(x) =\n\n\n) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Gzsp1\n|Zp\n| zp\n\u00d7\n\nGzspm\n) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Gzspm\nmnm\n(xmnm\n) dMZspm\n|Zp\n(zspm\n| zp\n) dMZp\n(zp\n).\nZp\nis the positive mixing variable at the portfolio level. Its cdf is denoted by MZp\n. Zspj\nrepresents a sub-portfolio-specific positive mixing variable, which depends by construction on\nZp\n. The cdf of Zspj\nconditional on Zp\nis denoted by MZspm\n|Zp\n.\nIf, for instance, the sub-portfolios represent the different industry sectors that the borrowing\ncompanies are operating in, the economic interpretation of the mixing variables could be\nas follows: Zspj\nrepresents all the market and macroeconomic information relevant for the\ncompanies operating in sector j. This information is partly sector-specific3 and not relevant\nfor other sectors. However, in part, it is common for all sectors, such as information about\n3This part of the information flow will be represented by the random variable Yspj\nlater in this text.\nthe general economic environment. This part of the information is represented by the random\nvariable Zp\n.\nThe two-fold mixture given in (3.1) determines the dependence structure of the asset return\nvector. The asset returns are mixtures of powers with mixing variables Zspj\n. Thus, conditional\non a realisation of Zspj\n, j = 1, . . . , m, the returns are mutually independent. The sector-\nspecific random variables Zspj\nare themselves mixtures with the common mixing variable Zp\n.\nThus, conditional on a realisation of Zp\n, the asset returns of the obligors in the different\nsub-portfolios are independent, but those in the same sub-portfolio are not.\nBecause in the credit portfolio context only the dependence structure (i.e. copula) of the\nasset return vector is of interest, we do not have to specify the cdfs Gji\nexactly. Suffice it\nto say that, according to Marshall and Olkin (1988), cdfs Gji\nas implicitly defined by (3.1)\nalways exist.4\nThe HAC corresponding to the mixture representation (3.1) has the form:\n, . . . , Cspm um1\n, . . . , umnm\n= p\np\n) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + -1\np\n spm\nspm\n) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + -1\nspm\n(umnm\n) .\np\nserves as the generator of the outer copula Cp and -1\nspj\nserves as the generator of\nan inner copula Cspj .\nAppendix A provides details on the HAC derivation from the general mixture of powers.\nIn this section, I derive a particular HAC model by defining all M(\u00b7)\nin (3.1) as gamma cdfs.\nThis leads to a relatively simple copula function with lower tail dependence. However, it\nmight be an interesting topic for further research to use other positive mixing variables and\nto compare the dependence properties of the resulting models. Another possible extension is\nto define more than two hierarchy levels.\nBecause I specify all mixing distributions in (3.1) as gamma cdfs, I only need to know the\nLaplace transform (LT) of a gamma random variable in order to derive an explicit formula\nfor the HAC in (3.2). First, I identify the inverse outer generater p\nas the LT of the gamma\nvariable Zp with mean 1 and variance p\n:\np\n() = 1 + p\nSecond, I identify the inverse inner generator spj\nas the LT of the random variable Zspj\n.\n4These cdfs are given by Gji\n(xji\n) = exp --1\nspj\nFRji\n(xji\n) , where spj\ndenotes the Laplace transform of\nZspj\n. In general, the Laplace transform of a positive random variable X is given by  = E exp{-X} =\nexp - with  denoting the corresponding Laplace exponent.\nSince the conditional distribution of this random variable is the gamma cdf MZspm\n|Zp\nand\nthe unconditional distribution is a mixture over MZspm\n|Zp\nwith the mixing variable also being\ngamma-distributed, I refer to the unconditional distribution of Zspj\nas Compound Gamma\n(CG). It is the distribution of a gamma subordinator, say Yspj\n, evaluated at a random, gamma-\ndistributed time given by Zp\n. The gamma random variable Yspj\nhas mean 1, variance spj\nand LT\nYspj\nas follows:\nspj\n() = p\n- ln Yspj\np\nspj\nln 1 +  spj\nFinally, I check that function (3.2) with p\nand spj\ncopula. This is only the case when the compound function\np\n spj\nsatisfies the nesting condition of being in the class L\nn\n. This class of functions is specified by\nL\nn\nBecause a L\u00b4\nevy subordinator evaluated at a random time given by another L\u00b4\nevy subordinator\nis also a L\u00b4\nevy subordinator, the copula generators involved are compatible with each other\nby construction. The compound function w() is just the Laplace exponent of a L\u00b4\nevy sub-\nordinator and, thus, belongs to class L\nn\ncan also be verified by looking at the derivatives of w  - ln Yspj\nwhich are given by\nspj\n-k\nfor k  N.\nThe equation above implies that (-1)k-1w(k) > 0   N holds.\nThe explicit representation of the HAC, obtained from (3.2) by putting in (3.3) and (3.5),\nis given by:\n, . . . , Cspm um1\n, . . . , umnm\nm\nspj\n+\nnj\nexp\nspj\np\nu-p\nji\nThis nested portfolio copula produces two interesting special cases of marginal copulas.\nThe first special case is the nj\n-variate Archimedean copula of asset returns assigned to a\nsub-portfolio j\n, . . . , ujnj\n) = spj\nspj\n) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + -1\nspj\n(ujnj\n)\np\nspj\n+\nnj\nexp\nspj\np\nu-p\nji\nI term this Archimedean copula compound gamma due to the fact that the inverse generator\nof the copula is the LT of a CG random variable. The second special case is the copula of\nasset returns assigned to different sub-portfolios:\n, . . . , umi\n) = p\np\n) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + -1\np\n(umi\n)\nm\nu-p\nji\nwhich turns out to be a Cook-Johnson copula (or Clayton copula in a two-dimensional case).\nIt is worth to mention that the nesting procedure put forward in this subsection is different\nfrom the commonly used one. For instance, Embrechts et al. (2003) and McNeil (2008)\namong others suggest, first, to take some known generator functions, nest them as in (3.2)\nand, second, to proof, whether the inner generators are compatible with the outer generater\nand, if so, under which parameter restrictions. Apart from the initial uncertainty as to\nwhether the resulting function will be a proper copula or not and the parameter restrictions\nthat must be satisfied, this common procedure makes implementation difficult. In fact, we\neither do not know the conditional distribution of Zspj\nat all or this distribution is difficult\nto sample from. By contrast, I use a nesting procedure which, on the one hand, ensures that\nthe compound function (3.6) is actually in L\nn\nwithout any parameter restrictions. On the\nother hand, I am free to choose a distribution for the conditional random variable Zspj\n| Zp\nwhich is easy to sample from. This feature is especially favorable with regard to the model's\nimplementation. In the particular example elaborated in this subsection the random variable\nZspj\nconditional on a realisation Zp\n= zp\nis gamma-distributed with mean zp\n, variance zp\nspj\nand the following LT:\np\n spj\n() = zp\nYspj\n() = 1 + spj\n3.2. Properties of the copula\nConcerning its algebraic properties, the hierarchical Archimedean copula (3.7) is only par-\ntially exchangeable in its arguments whereby the marginal copulas (3.8) and (3.9) are fully\npermutation-symmetric in their arguments.\nRegarding their dependence properties, all Archimedean copulas (ordinary or nested) are\nlarger than the independence copula in the sense of concordance ordering.5 It means that the\nrandom variables involved are positively dependent.\nMoreover, it is ensured by construction that dependence within sub-portfolios is stronger\ninner copulas are then larger than the outer copula (in the sense of concordance ordering) if\nthe compound function w defined in (3.6) is concave. w is given by w = - ln Yspj\nwhich is\nthe Laplace exponent of the random variable Yspj\nand, thus, a concave function so that the\nrequired condition holds.\nIt follows from the above result that Kendall's tau and other measures of concordance,\ndefined in Nelsen (1999, p. 136f.), are greater for the inner copulas than for the outer copula.\nIt holds:\np\n< min spj j=1,...,m\n.\nThe outer Cook-Johnson copula is positively ordered, that is it exhibits stronger dependence\nfor larger parameter values p\ncase. For a fixed value of the parameter p\n, the inner CG copula is also positively ordered\nwith respect to sp\n. To show that for the two-dimensional case, I use the corollary 4.4.6 in\nis nondecreasing on\n(0, 1) for a fixed p\n, then Csp1  Csp2 . The derivative of the inverse function of the CG LT\nis given by\nspj\n() = --p-1 exp\nspj\np\nIt follows that\n()\n()\n= exp\np\n.\nThis function is nondecreasing for a negative power, that is for sp1\n. It follows, that\nfor a fixed value of p\nthe CG family is positively ordered with respect to the parameter sp\n.\nTo illustrate dependence properties implied by the HAC model and to attain some feeling\nfor the parameter sensitivity, I use information provided by contour and scatter plots for the\ntwo-dimensional inner (CG) and outer (Clayton) copulas.\nBecause of the positive dependence, the contour lines of the copulas under consideration lie\nbetween those of the independence copula and those of the maximum copula (the copula of\ncomonotone random variables): cf. Figure 1. Figure 2 illustrates that the magnitude of the\npositive dependence is the greater, the larger the variance of the mixing variables: the contour\nlines converge to those of the maximum copula. For a particular value of p\n, dependence is\nstronger in the case of the CG copula (i.e. within a sub-portfolio) than for the Clayton\n5That is, an Archimedean copula is always greater that the independence copula evaluated for the same set\nof arguments: CArchimedean C.\ncopula (i.e. between sub-portfolios) due to the amplifying effect of the sub-portfolio-specific\nparameter sp\n.\nFigure 1: Contour plots of the independence and maximum copulas.\n(a) p\n= 1 (b) sp\n(c) p\nFigure 2: Contour plots of Clayton (left-hand side) and CG (right-hand side) copulas for\ndifferent parameter values.\nWith regard to the lower tail dependence, we can clearly see clusters of low-probability\nrealisations in the lower left-hand corners of a unit square in Figure 3. These scatter plots were\nobtained by simulation using the algorithm provided in the next subsection. The magnitude\nof lower tail dependence increases with rising values of variance parameters. Again, the sub-\nportfolio-specific parameter sp\nhas an amplifying effect so that the tail dependence within a\nsub-portfolio is stronger then the tail dependence between asset returns of obligors belonging\nto different sub-portfolios. A stronger within-sector dependence of the large negative asset\nreturns can also be inferred from the pairwise scatter plots in Figure 4. The figure shows\nrealisations from a four-dimensional Archimedean copula with two hierarchy levels and two\nsub-portfolios.\nThe property of lower (upper) tail dependence of two random variables describes the prob-\nability that extremely small (large) realisation of both variables occur simultaneously. The\ngeneral and Archimedean-copula-specific lower and upper tail dependence coefficients are\nL\n= lim\nC(u, u)\nu\n lim\n\n()\n,\nU\n= lim\n ()\n.\nThe lower tail dependence coefficient for the two-dimensional outer (Clayton) copula is\ngiven by L\n= 2-1/p so that lower tail dependence is increasing in the parameter. For the\ntwo-dimensional inner (CG) copula, no explicit expression can be obtained L\n. But, because\nof the result Cp  Csp, it holds that L\nis greater for the inner copula that for the outer\ncopula (cf. Hering et al., 2010). Moreover, because for a given value of p\nthe CG family\nis positively ordered with respect to sp\n, the lower tail dependence within a sub-portfolio is\nstronger for rising values of sp\n.\nRegarding the upper tail dependence, it is pointed out by Hering et al. (2010) that if both\nmixing variables used in the mixture of powers have finite mean, then there is no upper tail\ndependence between and within sub-portfolios.\nI illustrate the parameter sensitivity of the tail dependence by means of a graphic represen-\ntation in Figure 5. For u  0 the coefficients converge to values greater than zero indicating\npositive lower tail dependence. It is greater for the CG copula. For u  1 the upper tail\ndependence coefficients converge to zero for both Clayton and CG copulas regardless of the\nmagnitude of the variance parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n

Sampling algorithm\nI will conclude this section by providing a sampling algorithm for the hierarchical Archimedean\ncopula defined in (3.7). It goes as follows:\n\u00b7 Generate Zp\nfrom the gamma distribution with mean 1 and variance p\n.\n\u00b7 Generate Zspj\n| Zp\n, j = 1, . . . , m from the independent gamma distributions with mean\nZp\nand variance Zp\n\u00b7 spj\n.\n\u00b7 Generate variables Xji\n, j = 1, . . . , m, i = 1, . . . , nj\nfrom the uniform distribution on the\n\u00b7 The realisations from the HAC are given by\nUji\n= p\n\n\n\n-\nln Zp\nYspj\n- ln Xji\n/(Zspj\n| Zp\n)\nZp\n\n\n\n.\nThe sampling is particularly easy because we know by construction the distribution of the\nconditional random variable Zspj\n| Zp\n: see (3.10). It was not the case in other papers on\nnested Archimedean copulas, which I have mentioned in the introductory section.\nHaving elaborated the theoretical background, I move to an application example in the\nnext section.\n4. Application to test portfolios\nIn order to judge the model risk which arises from neglecting tail dependence in a credit\nportfolio context, I apply the HAC model introduced in the previous section to two test\nportfolios and compare the results with the outcomes of a Gaussian model. I describe two\ntest portfolios in subsection 4.1. In subsection 4.2, I calibrate the parameters of the HAC\nand the benchmark Gaussian model. The final results are discussed in subsection 4.3.\n4.1. Test portfolios\nThe stylised portfolios used in this section are adopt from Puzanova et al. (2009). The smaller\nportfolio is comprised of 100 credit exposures as summarised in Table 1. 65% of the portfolio\nLGD is attributed to investment garde (IG) borrowers and 35% to speculative grade (SG)\nborrowers according to Moody's rating grades/categories. In each rating category, 80% of\nthe total LGD is evenly distributed among 20% of the largest debtors. The remaining 20%\nof the LGD in each rating category is evenly distributed among the remaining debtors. The\nsecond, larger portfolio comprised of 1,000 credit exposures has exactly the same PD-LGD\nstructure as in Table 1 and is obtained from the small portfolio by subdividing each credit\nexposure into 10 parts.\nTable 1: Structure of the small test portfolio\nRating category PD(%) Share in the total Total # of\nportfolio LGD(%) debtors\nNote: Rating categories and corresponding probabilities of default (PD) were obtained from\nMoody's (2006, p. 33).

Parameter calibration\nIn order to assess the model risk evoked by different tail properties of different asset re-\nturn distributions, I consider a model with a Gaussian correlation structure and calibrate\ndependence parameters of the HAC model in a way that ensures the same linear correlation.\nThe obligors in the portfolio are grouped into two sub-portfolios according to their rating\ngrade: sub-portfolio 1 \u00ad investment garde (IG), sub-portfolio 2 \u00ad speculative grade (SG). I\nTable 2: Model parameters used in the simulation\nModel Parameters Estimates\np\np\nNote: The correlation parameters used in the simulation for the Gaussian model are set follow-\ning Puzanova and Siddiqui (2005).

For the purposes of an illustrative example, I take the estimates of the\nwithin-group correlation from Puzanova and Siddiqui (2005) and set the between-group cor-\nrelation to an arbitrarily chosen value which is smaller than the minimum of the within-group\ncorrelation coefficients. Numerical values of the correlation coefficients are given in the upper\npanel of Table 2.\nThe overall Gaussian copula of asset returns has the correlation matrix given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p\np\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\np\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to calibrate the dependence parameters of the HAC model, I use the following\nrepresentation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient:\n=\n(u, v) - uv dF-1\nX\nY\nfor two random variables X and Y .\nI put the two-dimensional portfolio-level copula in form (3.9) in combination with Gaussian\nmarginal cdfs onto the right-hand side and the between-group correlation coefficient p\nonto\nthe left-hand side of the equation (4.2). Then I solve the equation numerically for the copula\nparameter p\n. Subsequently, I substitute the copula on the right-hand side of (4.2) with the\nbivariate copula in form (3.8) for the sub-portfolio j and the correlation coefficient on the\nleft-hand side with spj\nand solve for spj\n. The results are given in the lower panel of Table 2.\n4.3. Results of the simulation study\nThis subsection reports the results of a simulation study for the test portfolios and model\nsettings described previously. In each setting, I run a Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio loss\ndistribution, repeating the simulation loop s = 1.5\u00d7107 times in order to achieve more precise\nresults. I first generate the probability-integral transforms for both models in question.6 I do\nthis by sampling asset returns from a multivariate normal distribution with the correlation\nmatrix (4.1) and computing Ui\n= FRi\n(Ri\n) for the Gaussian model. For the HAC model I\nsample Ui\ndirectly according to the algorithm in section 3.3. Then I calculate the default\nindicators as\nDi\n(Ui\nFor each of the s simulation loops, I calculate portfolio loss as:\nPLk =\nn\n\u00b7 Dk\ni\n, k = 1, . . . , s.\nAfter s simulation runs have been completed, I compute Monte Carlo estimators for the\nportfolio loss distribution, VaR and ES for each model setting. The estimators are given by:\n^\nFPL\n(xq\n)  ^\nq =\ns\ns\n(PLk),\nV aRq\n(PL) = inf x  [0, 1] : ^\nFPL\n(x)  q = PLs\ns\u00b7q\n,\n(PL) =\ns\nV aRq(PL),1\n(PLk)\ns\nV aRq(PL),1\n(PLk)\n+ V aRq\n(PL)\ns\ns\nV aRq(PL),1\n(PLk)\nq\n.\nHere, PLs\ns\u00b7q\nrepresents the order statistic of the sample (PL1, . . . , PLs) which is either of\norder s \u00b7 q or of a larger order next to it.\nFigure 4.3 demonstrates that the loss distribution based on the HAC setting has a much\nmore heavier tail than the distribution based on the Gaussian setting, which is in line with the\npresence of lower tail dependence although the linear correlation is the same. The difference\nis more pronounced in the case of the larger portfolio because the more debtors are in the\n6In this representation, the sub-portfolio subscripts are omitted for convenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n!\n$%#\n(a) Smaller portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n(b) Larger portfolio\nFigure 6: Log-lin graphs of the simulated portfolio loss tail function for two different model\nsettings: Gaussian and hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC).\nportfolio, the more combinations of joint defaults are possible and the dependence of rare/tail\nevents has a greater effect.\nAs to the measures of portfolio tail risk, the simulation results on VaR and ES at different\nconfidence levels are presented in Table 3. In all cases, the tail risk figures within the Gaussian\nsetting are considerably lower than those within the HAC setting. The difference becomes\nmore distinct, the further into the tail we go. Again, the risk of VaR/ES underestimation if\nthe assumption of zero lower tail dependence coefficient is wrong is considerably higher for the\nlarger portfolio, as illustrated in Figure 7. For the same linear correlation of asset returns, the\nmodel risk might be very pronounced when true joint distribution of underlying risk factors\nexhibits lower tail dependence. According to the values at risk marked in the figure for the\nlarger test portfolio, the 99.99%-VaR within the Gaussian setting lies next to the 99%-VaR\nwithin the HAC framework for the portfolio. That is, according to the Gaussian model, losses\nof about 10% of the total portfolio LGD and greater are supposed to occur once every 10,000\nyears. However, they would occur as often as once a century according to the HAC setting.\nThe results presented above demonstrate that the tail dependence properties of the under-\nlying joint distribution of asset returns influence to a great extent the tail behaviour of the\nportfolio loss distribution. Dependence parameters of the HAC model affect the probability\nof joint borrower defaults and therefore the portfolio tail risk. Table 4 clarifies this issue with\nan example. Thereby, a simplified model setting is considered with the same sub-portfolio-\nspecific parameters for both IG and SG rating grades (spj\n= sp\n). The simulation results for\nthe VaR of the smaller portfolio at different confidence levels demonstrate the impact of the\nincreasing parameter values on the VaR.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n !\"#\n  \n  !\"#\nFigure 7: Comparison of the Value at Risk (VaR) of the larger portfolio at two different confi-\ndence levels for the Gaussian and hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC) settings.\nThe probability distributions for both models under consideration are shown and\nthe corresponding VaR values are marked by vertical lines.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper introduces a novel model for asset returns based on the concept of nested Ar-\nchimedean copulas. The model takes account of tail dependence and, therefore, can be\nvery useful for the purposes of portfolio credit risk assessment. It exhibits a hierarchical\ndependence structure which means that it allows for a stronger dependence within specified\nsub-portfolios or sectors than between them.\nThe hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC) framework presented has a number of techni-\ncal merits which provide it with a beneficial simplicity and flexibility. Because it is ensured\nby construction that the resulting function is a proper copula, there is no need any more to\ncheck compatibility conditions or parameter restrictions for the nested copula. The sampling\nfrom the HAC becomes straightforward.\nApart from the technical features described, the suggested model might have far-reaching\nimplications for risk controlling and banking regulation and, on a large scale, for financial\nstability. Its implementation would result in a far more conservative assessment of portfolio\ncredit risk and, consequently, higher economic and regulatory capital requirements. Therefore,\nthe model is able to counter the systematic underestimation of credit risk in the banking sector\n\u00ad one of the basic causes of the recent financial turmoil.\nTable 3: Comparison of VaR and ES for different settings\nV aRq\nq Gauss HAC Gauss HAC\nSmaller portfolio\nLarger portfolio\nNote: VaR and expected shortfall (ES) at different confidence levels q estimated by sim-\nulation for various parameter settings and two different models: Gaussian and hierarchical\nArchimedean copula (HAC).
