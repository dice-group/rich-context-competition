Nutrition is considered a modifiable risk factor for CVD, particularly for individuals with\ndiabetes; albeit, there is little consensus on the role of carbohydrates, proteins and fats for arterial health for\npersons with or without diabetes. In this study, we examined the association of macronutrients with arterial pulse\npressure (APP), a surrogate measure of arterial health by diabetes status and race.\nHispanics (WNH) with and without diabetes of a weighted sample from the National Nutrition and Health\nExamination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008. The cross-sectional analysis was performed with IBM-SPSS version 18 with\nthe complex sample analysis module. The two-year sample weight for the sub-sample with laboratory values was\napplied to reduce bias and approximate a nationally, representative sample. Arterial stiffness was assessed by\narterial pulse pressure (APP).\n0.082), p = 0.018] than WNH, controlling for diabetes, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), fiber intake, energy\nintake (Kcal) and smoking.

The associations of APP with diabetes, race and dietary intake\nneed to be confirmed with intervention and prospective studies. Confirmation of these results would suggest that\ndietary interventions for minorities with diabetes may improve arterial health.\nBackground\nThe prevalence of diabetes and its health consequences\nhas been growing disproportionately in the U.S. and\nthroughout the world. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is\nthe most prevalent and detrimental complication of dia-\nbetes accounting for about 65% of deaths from heart\ndisease and stroke [1-3]. Death rates among adults with\ndiabetes were 2-4 times higher from heart disease and\nabout 2.8 times greater from stroke, when compared to\nindividuals without diabetes [4,5].\nArterial stiffening which leads to CVD is consistently\nobserved across all age groups for individuals with dia-\nbetes [6]. A complex series of structural, cellular and\nhormonal changes contribute to the lack of resilience of\nthe vascular wall, promoting arterial stiffening [6]. A\npossible link between diabetes and CVD could be due to\nthe pathological changes in the endothelium, at the\nmicrovascular level that leads to the stiffening of arteries\nin persons with diabetes. This stiffening reduces the\n* Correspondence: huffmanf@fiu.edu\n2Florida International University, Robert Stempel College of Public Health\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2011 Vaccaro and Huffman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The difference\nbetween SBP and DBP is referred to as arterial pulse\npressure (APP). A high APP is indicative of increased\narterial stiffness that promotes further stiffening of the\narteries, and has been associated with CVD morbidity\nand mortality [6,9]. Arterial pulse pressure is easily cal-\nculated by the difference between systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure and is a non-invasive, convenient, surro-\ngate measure of arterial stiffness [10].\nFor epidemiological studies and clinical trials invasive\nmethods or the use of expensive instruments (such as\nthose measuring pulse wave velocity) may not be feasi-\nble; yet, measures of arterial stiffness for participants by\ndisease state and social characteristics serve public\nhealth interests. Particularly since CVD is a leading\ncause of death and cardiovascular risk factors such as\nage, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterole-\nmia and smoking have been associated with increased\narterial stiffness and systemic endothelial dysfunction\n[11]. Arterial pulse pressure has been correlated to\nendothelial function in hypertensive patients [12] and\nwith pulse wave velocity and endothelial function in\nhealthy participants [11]. Therefore, APP may be a feasi-\nble method for screening endothelial function and arter-\nial health for epidemiological studies.\nWhile it has been established that diet and dietary pat-\ntern play a role in the prevention of hypertension, the\nrole of diet on APP has not been determined. The pro-\nportion and type of macronutrients (carbohydrate\n(CHO), protein and fat) may be associated with arterial\nhealth. Current dietary guidelines regarding the type and\nproportion of macronutrient for persons with diabetes\nby the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have not\nbeen consistently supported by the literature. While\nADA advocates a high fiber, high CHO diet, studies\nhave found beneficial diabetes outcomes with high pro-\ntein, low CHO diets. Several clinical trials have reported\ndietary composition, mainly proportion of calories from\nCHO, have an effect on blood pressure for normo- and\nhypertensive adults [13-16]; however, few studies com-\npare these effects for persons with type 2 diabetes. The\nhighest dietary type and source of monounsaturated\nfatty acid (MUFA), is from oleic acid found primarily in\nunrefined (virgin) olive oil, followed by high oleic-sun-\nflower and safflower oil and canola oil [17]. A random-\neffect model of ten studies found diets high in CHO\nand low in MUFA were associated with a higher SBP\nmiological studies assessing the effect of MUFA for nor-\nmal populations on blood pressure revealed conflicting\nresults [17]. Even though there were few epidemiological\nstudies from Mediterranean countries, the results all\nindicated that MUFA intake was inversely associated\nwith blood pressure [17]. Patients with type 2 diabetes\n(N = 15) from a 3-week, crossover diet intervention\nwere found to have reduced blood pressure with a 30%\nMUFA/30% CHO diet as compared to a 10%MUFA/\n50% CHO diet [19]. Current analysis in our laboratory\nof Hispanics by diabetes status reported an inverse rela-\ntionship between carbohydrate intake and APP for indi-\nviduals with diabetes; while protein intake was inversely\nassociated with APP for persons without diabetes. Based\non these finding, our objective was to assess APP and\nits association with macronutrient by diabetes status for\na multiethnic sample. We hypothesized that CHO, with\nrespect to total calories and fiber, would be positively\nassociated with higher APP in individuals with diabetes\nregardless of gender and ethnicity. We further hypothe-\nsized that MUFA would be inversely associated with\nAPP for individuals regardless of diabetes status, gender\nand ethnicity.\nMethods\nThis study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,\ndiabetes from three ethnicities: Mexican American (MA);\nBlack, non-Hispanic (BNH); and White, non-Hispanic\n(WNH). NHANES has 5 categories for ethnicity, the sam-\nple size for individuals with diabetes in 2 categories:\n\"Other Hispanic\" and \"Other\" was insufficient for multiple\ncomparisons and were not used in the analysis. Partici-\ndiabetes (n = 4144) and for whom dietary and anthropo-\nmetric data were available. The two-year sample weight\nfor laboratory analyses was used to achieve a non-biased,\nrepresentative sample of the United States population.\nData collection\nRaw data were extracted from datasets collected from\nData were available for use without additional informed\nconsent, since informed consent was obtained by\nNHANES and this was a secondary analysis of unrest-\nricted data. This survey contains data for 10,149 indivi-\nduals of all ages. The NHANES survey design is a\nstratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian\nnon-institutionalized U.S. population. The stages of\nsample selection are as follows: 1) Primary Sampling\nUnits (PSUs), which are counties or small groups of\ncontiguous counties; 2) segments within PSUs (a block\nor group of blocks containing a cluster of households);\n3) households within segments; and 4) one or more par-\nticipants within households. A total of 15 PSUs were\nvisited during a 12-month period.\nFor the household interview, participants were those\nwho understood, agreed to and signed an interview con-\nsent for the household interview portion of the survey.\nAfter the household interview was completed, all inter-\nviewed persons were asked to complete the health exami-\nnation component. Those who agreed to participate were\nasked to sign additional consent forms for the NHANES\nhealth examination component. Informed consent was\nobtained from each subject in the study. The health\nexaminations were conducted in mobile examination\ncenters (MECs); the MECs provide a standardized envir-\nonment for the collection of high quality data.\nThe nutrition assessment was conducted in a private\nroom in the MEC, by trained dietary interviewers fluent\nin Spanish and English. A standard set of measuring\nguides were used to help participants estimate food por-\ntions that they consumed. The first day face-to face\ninterview was used rather than the second day 24-hour\nrecall since the second day interview was conducted by\ntelephone and values were not available for all partici-\npants. In addition, the telephone interview process may\nintroduce subject bias since the conditions were not the\nsame for all subjects telephoned. Finally, comparing sub-\njects telephoned to those interviewed introduces an\nextraneous variable when combining both 24-hour\nrecalls for analysis.\nDiabetes status variable\nParticipants who answered \"yes\" to the question `have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or health professional\nthat you have diabetes or sugar diabetes' were classified\nas having diabetes and those who answered \"no\" were\nclassified as not having diabetes.\nEthnicity and adult status\nFilters were applied to select individuals of age 21 years\nor more and belonging to either MA, BNH or WNH\nethnicities.\nDemographic and anthropometric variables\nThere were insufficient numbers of persons at the high-\nest education level by ethnicity (based on the estimated\nmarginal means) so the education variable was collapsed\nfrom 5 to 4 categories. An obesity variable was con-\nstructed for body mass index (BMI) where BMI  30\nkg/m2 and was transformed by natural logarithm to\nachieve linearity.\nDietary variables\nThe first day 24 hour recall were used to construct all\ndietary variables. The first day 24 hour recall was chosen\nsince it was administered in person; whereas the second\nday 24 hour recall was conducted by telephone. Mono-\nunsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated fatty acid\n(SFA) intakes were transformed by the square root to\nachieve linearity. Carbohydrate and protein were trans-\nformed by natural-logarithm.\nMajor outcome variable\nThe dependent variable, APP was calculated by subtract-\ning the first SBP and DBP readings for all participants.\nThe first reading was chosen rather than subsequent\nreading since values for all participants were available.\nSince a true difference between systolic and diastolic\npressure was sought, actual readings were subtracted\nrather than the average.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics and frequencies were run by com-\nplex sample analysis for participant characteristics. Sepa-\nrate regression models for dietary analysis: fats, protein,\ncarbohydrate by diabetes status, ethnicity and gender\nwere performed for APP by complex sample analysis\n(weighted samples) using the General Linear Model.\nContinuous variables were tested by Q-Q plots and\ntransformed if necessary to achieve linearity. Known\nconfounders such as age, gender, smoking, BMI and\nKcal were used for adjustment in all models. Possible\nconfounders such as poly-unsaturated fatty acids\n(PUFA), blood pressure medication, physical activity,\ndietary sodium and dietary potassium were included in\nthe full model and eliminated in the final model since\nthey were not significant. Statistical analyses were con-\nducted with IBM-SPSS version 18 by the complex sam-\nple module. It has been suggested by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics [21] to select the sample\nweight with the smallest sub-sample based on the major\nvariables. The sample weight from the mobile examina-\ntion center (MEC) for laboratory was used since it con-\ntained the smallest sample size than demographics and\ndietary sub-samples. Since the dietary sub-sample was\nclose in size to the laboratory sub-sample, analysis were\nalso conducted with the dietary sample weight for com-\nparison. The direction of all relationships was the same\nand magnitudes were not significantly different with\neither method. Sample weights were used to achieve an\nunbiased, nationally representative sample of non-insti-\ntutionalized citizens of the U.S. The group WNH was\nuse as a reference for race so that BNH and MA were\ncompared to WNH. For all analyses, p-value of < 0.05\nwas considered significant.\nResults\nDescriptive characteristics of the weighted sample are\npresented by race in Table 1. Statistical analyses by the\ncomplex GLM, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for\nthe weighted proportion, were conducted to determine\nsignificant differences for each continuous variable. The\nfollowing variables were significantly different by race:\nAPP, age, diabetes and smoking status, intakes of dietary\nfiber and saturated fat. Carbohydrate and MUFA intakes\ndid not vary by race. The MA group consisted of a\nhigher percentage of males; while, BNH and WNH were\ncomposed of a higher percentage of females. Black, non-\nHispanics had the highest percentage of reported cases\nof diabetes.\nRace and diabetes status, were independent predictors\nof APP, adjusting for age, gender, BMI, Kcal and smok-\ning (Table 2). Having diabetes and being BNH was asso-\nciated with a lower APP than for WNH with diabetes.\nNext a series of models for protein, carbohydrate and\nfat intakes were conducted with APP as the dependent\nvariable. The final macronutrient models indicated that\nthe dietary variables of CHO and MUFA interacted with\ndiabetes status in determining APP. Protein was not a\nsignificant predictor of APP; however, CHO and MUFA\nwere associated with APP. The reduced models for APP\nregressed on CHO (Model 1) and MUFA (Model 2) are\nshown in Table 3. For Model 1, the simple-sugars-group\nwas not significantly different by diabetes status or race\nand was eliminated for the reduced model. Controlling\nfor CHO, fiber, age, gender, smoking, BMI and Kcal,\nrace by itself no longer predicted APP in the CHO or in\nthe MUFA models. Instead, the 2-way interaction of dia-\nbetes with race was significant for APP (Model 1, p =\nbetes had lower APP than WNH with diabetes (Models\nhave significantly different APP compared to WNH\nCHO and MUFA were modified by diabetes status for\ndetermining an association with APP and was indepen-\ndent of race. Having diabetes and consuming lower\nCHO was associated with higher APP, adjusting for\nfiber, calories, race, BMI, smoking, gender, and age (p =\n0.001). Similarly, having diabetes and consuming lower\nMUFA was associated with higher APP (p = 0.011).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined a non-invasive, surrogate indicator\nof arterial health, APP and its relationship to diet for\nindividuals with and without diabetes.

Although several studies and a meta-analysis indi-\ncate higher protein, lower CHO diets have a more\nfavorable effect on blood pressure, there are contradic-\ntory findings regarding the proportion of dietary carbo-\nhydrate with respect to daily caloric consumption for\npersons with diabetes. There are limited studies of\nMUFA and blood pressure and no known studies of\nOur study found differences in APP by diabetes status\nwith MUFA and CHO. Specifically, lower intake of\nCHO and MUFA were associated with higher APP for\npersons with diabetes as compared to persons without\ndiabetes, independent of race. These associations may\nbe due, in part, to the replacement of SFA and/or trans-\nfatty acids (TFA) with CHO and/or MUFA. The effect\nof SFA on CVD has been well-established in the litera-\nture. In the last decade, TFA have been implicated as a\nCVD risk factor. Although rare in nature, TFA, ubiqui-\ntous in margarines, baked goods, shortenings, fried and\npackaged foods, are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils\nwhere approximately 30-60% of the naturally occurring\ncis unsaturated double bonds are converted into trans-\nunsaturated double bonds [22]. TFA adversely affecting\nlipid profile in several randomized clinical trials and\nmay promote endothelial dysfunction [[22] and\nreferences therein]. Our findings that PUFA was not\nassociated with MUFA and APP were in accordance\nwith a 14 year follow-up study of coronary heart disease\n(CHD) in men (N = 45,722) initially free of known CVD\n[23]. The authors found MUFA intake and CHD were\nindependent of PUFA intake [23].\nDiets high in CHO and low in MUFA were associated\nwith a higher SBP for a random-effect model of ten stu-\ndies [18]. This meta-analysis combined one pre-hyper-\ntensive, one hyperlipidemic, four normotensive and four\ntype 2 diabetes studies. Although the investigators used\nthe random-effect model which controlled for disease\nstate, they did not compare individuals with to those\nwithout type 2 diabetes. Rasmussen et al [19] reported a\nreduction in SBP and DBP with no change in lipids for\na high fat, a high MUFA diet as compared to an isocalo-\nric and high CHO diet for individuals with type 2 dia-\nbetes. High protein/low CHO composition diets were\nassociated with improved glycemic index, blood pressure\nand weight loss in persons with diabetes in several stu-\ndies [13-16]. Yet, high protein/low CHO diets may not\nprove to be beneficial for arterial health for individuals\nwith certain metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes\nor metabolic syndrome) since the long-term effect of\nthese diets are not known [24]. Glycemic improvement\nwas most likely a result of weight loss rather than the\nparticular diet. Isocaloric diets that promote weight\nmaintenance as opposed to weight loss may be more\nTable 2 Diabetes status and race as factors of APP*\nIndependent Variables B-unstandardized coefficient (95% CI) SE P*\nWNH (reference) \nWNH (reference) \nCovariates\nDependent Variable: APP\nAbbreviations: MA = Mexican American; BNH = Black, non-Hispanic;\nWNH = White, non-Hispanic; APP = arterial pulse pressure; Kcal = kilocalories per day (energy intake); BMI = body mass index.\n* Complete data were available for N = 4237 participants and sample weights were applied.

However, few studies of fat-type have\nbeen conducted in individuals with diabetes. It has been\nshown that endothelial function is affected by fatty acid\ncontent in blood [25] and ratio of polyunsaturated to\nsaturated (P/S) fatty acids [26]. The mechanisms invol-\nving MUFA on blood pressure and arterial health are\nless clear. There is evidence that endothelial products\nresponsible for thrombogenesis were diminished by a\nTable 3 Effect of Diabetes status, race and diet on APP*\nModel 1 Carbohydrate/Fiber B-unstandardized coefficient (95% CI) SE P\nWNH (reference) \nDiabetes(yes) WNH (reference)  - - -\nModel 2 MUFA/SFA B (95% CI) SE P\nWNH (reference)\nDiabetes (yes) WNH (reference) \nAbbreviations: APP = arterial pulse pressure; MA = Mexican Americans; BNH = Black, non-Hispanics; WHN = White, non-Hispanics; MUFA = monounsaturated fatty\nacids; SFA = saturated fatty acids; Kcal = kilocalories per day (energy intake); BMI = body mass index.\n* Complete data were available for N = 4236 participants and sample weights were applied.

These results suggest that\nMUFA, in the form of olive oil, may have a protective\neffect on endothelial function in individuals with type 2\ndiabetes [28]. Olive oil, in addition to oleic acid, con-\ntains many polyphenols in different amounts and types\nfrom other MUFA oils and these polyphenols may play\na role in enhancing endothelial function by promoting\nthe formation of nitric oxide and suppressed the forma-\ntion of adhesion molecules [23-29]. One reason why\nthere are conflicting results concerning MUFA intake\nand blood pressure may be attributed to the type of\nMUFA [17]. Oleic acid may be responsible for the\nmechanism promoting blood pressure regulation [17] as\nwell as endothelial function.\nA limitation of this study was its cross-sectional nat-\nure; and therefore, causality cannot be inferred. Diabetes\ndiagnosis was by self-report and not by medical records;\nalbeit, the American Diabetes Association[30] and the\nWorld Health Organization [31] endorses the determi-\nnation of diabetes hyperglycemia and/or self-reported\ndiabetes. Although the results were from data weighted\nto a nationally representative sample, this comparison\nwas for three major ethnic groups and did not include\nAsians and Hispanics other than Mexican Americans.\nMexican Americans constitute a larger proportion of\nnon-U.S. citizens and undiagnosed cased of diabetes\nthan BNH and WHN; therefore, the weighted sample\nmight not have take into account these differences. We\nwere not able to assess TFA intake and it may have\nbeen a confounder with CHO and APP. Finally, the\nsources of MUFA were not quantified in this study and\nvariations in antioxidant properties may have been a\nconfounder in the association of MUFA with APP.\nConclusion\nThis is the first study that demonstrated relationships\namong CHO and MUFA intakes by diabetes status and\nrace with APP. Arterial stiffness is a major surrogate\nindicator of CVD that is associated with complications\nof diabetes. This study suggests the balance between\nmacronutrients for arterial health may differ by diabetes\nstatus and race. Both MA and BNH had higher APP\nthan WNH, controlling for current smoking and age.\nClinical trials and prospective studies are needed to\ndetermine if dietary CHO and MUFA intakes may be\nbeneficial for APP for persons with diabetes or if the\nreplacement of SFA and TF with CHO and MUFA is\nprotective of arterial health. The inverse relationship of\nMUFA intake and APP was observed for Blacks with\ndiabetes, a population who are disproportionately\naffected by elevated BP and diabetes complications.\nIdentifying the role of macronutrients in arterial health\nfor individuals with diabetes, would address an impor-\ntant public health issue since compromised arterial\nhealth may be prevented by dietary modifications of\nmacronutrient balance.\nAbbreviations\nAPP: arterial pulse pressure; BMI: body mass index; BNH: Black, non-Hispanic;\nCDC: Center for Disease Prevention and Control; CHD: coronary heart\ndisease; CHO: carbohydrate; CI: confidence interval; CVD: cardiovascular\ndisease; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; DHNES: Division of Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys; MA: Mexican American; MEC: mobile\nexamination center; MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acids; NCHS: National\nCenter for Health Statistics; NHANES: National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey; P/S: polyunsaturated to saturated; PSU: Primary\nSampling Units; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acids; SBP: systolic blood\npressure; SFA: saturated fatty acid; WNH: White, non-Hispanic.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank NHANES for making the data publically available.\nAuthor details\n1Florida International University, Robert Stempel College of Public Health\nW. 8th Street, Miami, FL 33199, USA. 2Florida International University, Robert\nStempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Department of Dietetics\nAuthors' contributions\nJAV and FGH contributed to the design of the study, manuscript\ndevelopment, interpretation of the data and editing.
