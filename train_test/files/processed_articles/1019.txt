After 100 years in this country,\nmost acute infectious illnesses are preventable or\ncurable. In 2005, we find ourselves in the era of\nchronic illnesses.2 Many of the chronic illnesses of\n1905, such as leprosy, syphilis, and (until recently)\ntuberculosis, have become so rare as to be unknown\nby young physicians. The conspicuous exception in\nthis history of progress is mental illness. In spite of\nnew medications and psychosocial treatments, men-\ntal illnesses, such as schizophrenia and mood\ndisorders, are as much of a public health challenge\nnow as they were a century ago. Mental illnesses are\nincreasingly recognized to be chronic and disabling,\nbelonging to a group of serious medical illnesses that\nincludes heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. How-\never, as we argue throughout this essay, researchers\ncontinue to approach mental illnesses as fundamen-\ntally different from these other medical diseases.\nWhile the goals of biomedical research for heart\ndisease, diabetes, and cancer are generally cure and\nprevention, very little research for the mental ill-\nnesses has set the bar this high. Mental illness\nresearch has generally sought incremental advances.\nHere we ask: What would be a strategy for seeking a\ncure for a mental disorder? What are the impediments\nto raising the bar? How can we ensure that less than\n100 years from now schizophrenia, mood disorders,\nand autism will join the ranks of leprosy, syphilis,\nand tuberculosis?\nThe public health challenge\nAs a starting point, it is important to recognize the\nchallenge. Mental illnesses are common, chronic, and\ndisabling. The recent National Comorbidity Survey-\nReplication (NCS-R) study used a population-based\napproach to estimate the prevalence of mood, anxiety,\nand substance use disorders in a household survey.3\nEven leaving out schizophrenia, 6% of this household\npopulation was identified as having a `serious'\ndisorder, defined as a suicide attempt with serious\nlethal intent, work disability or substantial limita-\ntions, or being out of role for at least 30 days in the\npast year. As the NCS-R did not count some of the\nmost severely disabled who are in hospitals, prisons,\nor homeless, the 6% estimate must be considerably\nlower than the rate of severe disability from mental\nillness in the general population. Indeed, schizophre-\nnia affects roughly 1% of the population; most people\nwith this disorder are unemployed, unmarried, and\non public assistance.4 Autism spectrum disorder, also\nnot counted in the NCS-R, has been estimated to\naffect between 0.3 and 0.6% of children, many with a\nE-mail: insel@mail.nih.gov\nwww.nature.com/mp\nlifelong absence of language and severe social\ndeficits.5\nIn an attempt to quantify the public health burden\nof each of the major medical illnesses, the World\nHealth Organization launched the Burden of Disease\nstudy. This study, which used the metric of `dis-\nability-adjusted life years' to take into account the\nduration as well as the severity of the disability,\nidentified mental illness as the number one source of\ndisability from all non-communicable medical causes\nin developed nations.6 Relative to other major sources\nof morbidity and mortality, such as heart disease,\ncancer, and stroke, mental illnesses are chronic and\nthey strike early in life. In the 15\u00ad44-year-age bracket,\ndepression and substance abuse disorders account for\nmore than 50% of the disability from all medical\ncauses. Indeed, as shown in Table 1, all of the top five\nsources of medical disabilities are mental disorders in\nthis age bracket in the US and Canada.\nIt is also clear that these illnesses account for\nconsiderable mortality. There are approximately\nto a mental disorder.7 This is greater than the number\nall but three forms of cancer (lung, breast, and colon).\nWhile suicide is usually associated with depression,\nthe relative risk of death from suicide is increased\nnearly 10-fold in schizophrenia and 50-fold in\nanorexia nervosa.8,9\nWhat is perhaps most surprising in looking at\nmorbidity and mortality data is that we have made so\nlittle progress on some of the most serious mental\ndisorders. While we are seeing recent reductions in\ndeaths from cardiac disease, AIDS, certain cancers,\nand even homicide, the mortality rate as measured by\nthe number of suicides has changed little in the past\ncentury.7 Are we reducing morbidity? The epidemio-\nlogical data on prevalence and severity are not\nencouraging. Clearly, more people are receiving\ntreatment over the past decade, but there is little\nevidence thus far that this has led to reductions in\nProgress: the glass half full\nThis sober accounting of the state of mental health\ncare neglects substantial progress in many areas. For\nthe most common major illnesses, we now have\nmedical and psychosocial interventions of proven\nefficacy in randomized, controlled trials. Exceptions\ninclude anorexia nervosa and autism where we still\nlack large-scale, controlled trials. However, even for a\nchronic, disabling illness like schizophrenia, we have\nmedications that predictably reduce most of the\npositive symptoms, allowing patients to leave hospi-\ntals. Many patients with mood disorders will respond\nto treatment and some will recover completely.\nHow does this availability of effective treatments\nsquare with the persistent morbidity and mortality of\nthese disorders? The traditional answer is that we fail\nat service delivery, that is, too few patients receive\nevidence-based interventions. There are good data to\nsupport this argument. The PORT study demonstrated\nthe low rate of use of several evidence-based\ntreatments for schizophrenia.11 A recent meta-analy-\nsis of 28 studies demonstrates that family psycho-\neducation can reduce relapse in schizophrenia by\n50%, but only 31% of patients receive this relatively\ncost-effective intervention.12,13 The NCS-R study\nreports that only 50% of those with depression\nreceive any treatment and approximately 20% receive\nminimally adequate care.10 Cognitive behavioral\ntreatment has been demonstrated to be an effective\npsychotherapy for mood and anxiety disorder, but a\nrecent survey documents that the majority of psy-\nchotherapy training programs in the US do not\nprovide adequate training in this or any other\nevidence-based treatment (Weissman, 2005, personal\ncommunication).\nLimitations: the glass half empty\nWhile there can be little doubt that we have not fully\nutilized the available treatments, it is important to\nrecognize that the available treatments are insuffi-\ncient. To repeat an oft-used metaphor from the history\nof polio, while we can continue to make more and\nbetter iron lungs available, we also need to go after the\nvaccine. All current medical treatments for mental\nillnesses are palliative, none are even proposed as\ncures. Yes, too few people receive evidence-based\npalliative care. However, to stretch the polio meta-\nTable 1 Defining the public health burden at the beginning\nCauses of disability by illness category (all ages)\nRespiratory diseases 7.6\nMusculoskeletal diseases 6.8\nSense organ diseases 6.4\nCardiovascular diseases 5.0\nDigestive diseases 3.4\nCauses of disability by specific illness (ages 15\u00ad44 years)\nBipolar disorder 3.7\nHearing loss (adult onset) 2.4\nIron-deficient anemia 2.2\nDiabetes mellitus 2.2\nValues represent percent of disability due to either class or\nspecific illness.

Indeed,\nwhile the recent President's New Freedom Commis-\nsion on Mental Health Care proclaimed `recovery' as\nthe goal of mental health care, few research studies\nhave aimed for `recovery' as an outcome.14\nIn fairness, researchers may avoid the term `recov-\nery' because it is difficult to quantify. Remission has\nbeen a more widely accepted term, with several\nattempts to provide consensus definitions of remis-\nsion in mood disorders and schizophrenia.15\u00ad17\nResnick et al.18 have recently described two defini-\ntions of recovery: recovery as an outcome (which\nmight be defined as remission over an extensive\nduration) and recovery as an orientation (defined as\nlife satisfaction, hope and optimism, knowledge\nabout mental illness and services, and empower-\nment). While the latter definition of recovery may be\nmore achievable with the provision of current\nservices as envisioned by the President's New Free-\ndom Commission, we suspect this goal would fall far\nshort of what most researchers in cancer or heart\ndisease would accept as success. We suggest that in\nmental illnesses as in other medical illnesses, we\nneed to aim for a goal of recovery defined by a\ncomplete and permanent remission. In other areas of\nmedicine, this approach has been called `cure\ntherapeutics' (URL: www.jdrf.org).\nIf cure therapeutics is the goal, how insufficient are\ntoday's treatments for mental illnesses? For some\ndisorders such as autism and anorexia nervosa, we\nsimply lack biomedical treatments for the core\nsymptoms. For others, such as schizophrenia, current\ntreatments target only select symptoms. Neuroleptics,\nboth conventional and atypical antipsychotics, re-\nduce psychotic symptoms but may not treat the\ncognitive deficits or negative symptoms of schizo-\nphrenia.19 While five decades of research have shown\nthat antipsychotics have greater efficacy than placebo\nfor reducing hallucinations and delusions in schizo-\nphrenia, the effectiveness of these drugs remains\ndisappointing. The recent Clinical Antipsychotic\nTreatment Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial\ndemonstrated that only about one in four patients\nwith chronic schizophrenia continued either a first or\nsecond generation antipsychotic throughout an 18-\nbegan this trial revealed that less than 10% met cross-\nsectional criteria for symptomatic and functional\nremission at the 18-month end point (S Scott,\npersonal communication). Of course the patients in\nCATIE were chronically ill and partially treatment\nresistant, so a low rate of recovery should not be\nsurprising. However, even in a 5-year follow-up of\n118 schizophrenic patients after their first episode of\npsychosis, only 13.7% met criteria for full remission\nlasting 2 years or more.21 Schizophrenia remains a\nchronic, disabling disorder, just as it was a century\nago. We know that psychosocial interventions, such\nas supported employment and family psychoeduca-\ntion, reduce relapse and may help patients to achieve\na life in the community. Surprisingly, we do not know\nhow many or which patients with schizophrenia will\nrecover with the optimal combined application of\ncurrent medical and psychosocial interventions. And\nour expectations continue to be limited. For instance,\nthe recent consensus definition of remission for\nschizophrenia developed by an American Psychiatric\nAssociation working group does not even include a\nrequirement of improved functioning, which many\npatients and families view as the essence of recov-\nAre treatments for mood disorders much better?\nAntidepressants, the third most commonly prescribed\nclass of medications in the US, have been shown to\nreduce the symptoms of major depressive disorder,\nbut these drugs are generally better than placebo only\nafter 6 weeks of administration and in most studies,\npatients on medication continue to have substantial\ndepressive symptoms.22 A consensus definition of\nremission published in 1991 has helped the field to\nmeasure remission as a target in the treatment of\nmajor depressive disorder. How often do SSRIs result\nin remission? In a large-scale effectiveness study of\nthe SSRI citalopram less than a third of patients met\ncriteria for remission (defined as a 17 item Hamilton\nRating Score < 8 or last observed QIDS-SR16 of < 6)\nafter 12 weeks of treatment.23 Placebo was not used as\na comparison for this trial, so it is not clear how many\nof these patients would have recovered without active\nmedication. However, even accepting that roughly\none-third meet criteria for remission, is the treatment\nsufficient? In an illness characterized by intense\nemotional suffering, hopelessness, and suicidal idea-\ntion, should we be satisfied with treatments that\nrequire several weeks to be effective and will not lead\nto remission in the majority of patients? Would our\ncolleagues in medicine be satisfied with these out-\ncomes for an illness characterized by intense pain,\nhigh morbidity, and a 4% mortality rate?\nIn considering the shortcomings of current treat-\nments, one can hardly ignore the absence of progress\nin developing medications with new mechanisms.\nWhile scores of new antipsychotics and antidepres-\nsants have been introduced over the past three\ndecades to reduce side effects or improve efficacy,\nvirtually all of these `new' medication are simply\nvariations on old themes. In contrast to other areas of\nmedicine, there have been few medications with new\nmechanisms of action developed in the past three\ndecades for schizophrenia and depression (Figure 1).\nIn fact, after more than three decades, we do not truly\nknow the mechanisms or targets for the first genera-\ntion medications, so one can hardly be certain if\nnewer atypical antipsychotics or SSRIs represent\ncompounds with different mechanisms of action or\nsimply chemical analogues with fewer or different\nA different approach\nWhether one focuses on the glass as half full or half\nempty, there can be little doubt that we need a\nCure therapeutics and strategic prevention\nTR Insel and EM Scolnick\nMolecular Psychiatry\ndifferent approach for medication development for\nmental disorders. For the past five decades, the\nbiological study of mental illness has been dominated\nby the study of the action of the available drugs. In\nretrospect, this might have been productive if the\ndrugs targeted the core pathophysiology of the\ndisorders. Certainly, the study of insulin action has\nbeen useful for developing new approaches to\ndiabetes and research on adrenergic pharmacology\nhas been helpful for cardiovascular medicine. How-\never, as we have just reviewed, the available medica-\ntions in psychiatry are insufficient for treating the\ndisorders. Indeed, after five decades, we need to\nrecognize that we may never get from neuropharma-\ncology to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe canonical approach to treatment development\nin psychiatry is essentially a recipe for developing\n`me-too' compounds, as the entire process is based on\ndeveloping drugs modeled on an existing, insufficient\ndrug (Figure 2). In other areas of medicine, from heart\ndisease to cancer, treatment development begins by\ndefining pathophysiology (Figure 2). Through cell\nbiology (identifying the tyrosine kinase for myeloid\ncell division) or epidemiology (recognizing the role of\ncholesterol in heart disease), the process begins with\ntarget identification.\nHow will we identify new targets for mental\ndisorders? This will happen just as it is happening\nin the rest of medicine, through research on the core\nmechanism of these diseases. There are three key\nsteps in this process. First, comprehensive studies of\npeople with these disorders, using genomics, tran-\nscriptomics, and proteomics, should identify cellular\npathways that are affected. This will undoubtedly be\nmore difficult than in other areas of medicine, but\ngenetics is already providing some hints. The study of\nthe serotonin transporter promoter demonstrates that\nthe short allele is associated with an increase in the\nvulnerability to depression.25,26 This allele also is\nassociated with a reduction in the volume of Area 25\nin the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region with\none of the most intense serotonergic innervations in\nthe forebrain.27 Along with reduced volume of this\nbrain region, the short allele is associated with a\nfunctional dissociation of this region from the\namygdala during the processing of negative affect.27\nUnderstanding how this allele alters development of\nArea 25 and affects functional connectivity in the\nforebrain could serve as a starting point for defining\ntargets for major depressive disorder.\nHowever, the search for genomic variations asso-\nciated with mental illness is really just beginning.\nWith the recent completion of the human haplotype\nmap and the advent of rapid genotyping capacity, we\nshould finally make rapid progress identifying some\nof the vulnerability genes and thus critical pathways\nfor the pathophysiology of the major mental ill-\nnesses.28 In other complex genetic diseases, such as\nage-related macular degeneration, this strategy is\nalready revealing new targets that would not have\nbeen suspected based on decades of descriptive\nA second step, the use of in vitro screening, will be\ncritical for identifying new compounds. What we\nhave learned elsewhere in medicine is that target\nidentification is a long and high-risk process with\nmany false leads. It is also the easy part, in that\n# of Mechanistically\nDistinct Drugs\nDepression Schizophrenia Heart Disease\nFigure 1 Drug development in the past 50 years. While\npharmacologic research in cardiovascular medicine and\nother areas of medicine has developed medications with\nnew mechanisms of action, psychiatry has enjoyed less\ninnovation in terms of drug development. Over the past 50\nyears, new medications for schizophrenia and depression\nhave been almost exclusively based on existing medications\nwithout developing compounds that have either new\nclinical targets (e.g. the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia\nor suicidal behavior in depression) or new molecular\nmechanisms (beyond dopamine receptor blockade for\nschizophrenia or monoamine transporter or enzyme block-\ners for depression).\nClinical observation\nMechanism of action\nAnimal studies\nClinical trial\nPsychiatric Medications\nClinical trial\nSmall molecule screening\nAnimal studies\nMolecular pathophysiology\nModern Drug Discovery\nFigure 2 Pathways for drug development. The traditional\npathway for medication development in psychiatry has\nbegun with a serendipitous clinical observation of efficacy\nfollowed by intensive study of the drug's actions. Based on\nneuropharmacology, new drugs have been developed with\ngreater specificity or potency and these, in turn, are tested\nin animal studies and clinical trials. This is a recipe for\ndeveloping new drugs that will mimic existing drugs. The\nmodern approach to drug development begins with identi-\nfying a molecular or cellular target based on pathophysiol-\nogy, then uses high throughput screening of small molecule\nlibraries to detect potential hits that can be refined by\nmedicinal chemistry into drugs for testing in animals and\nultimately adapted for clinical trials.\nCure therapeutics and strategic prevention\nTR Insel and EM Scolnick\nMolecular Psychiatry\ncellular pathways frequently have specific pressure\npoints for modifying function and these may be\nimplicated in many diseases. The second step,\ndeveloping small molecules that affect these pressure\npoints, may prove more difficult. Indeed, this step has\nhistorically been ceded to the pharmaceutical indus-\ntry. The recent creation of a molecular library screen-\ning centers network (MLSCN) in universities and the\nNIH has, for the first time, encouraged academic\ninvestigators to engage in the early phase of identify-\ning small molecules for influencing specific cellular\npathways.30 The MLSCN uses a library of small\nmolecules, an array of assays recommended by the\nfield, and high throughput screening centers to\nidentify `hits' for any given target. Of course, there\nwill be a vast amount of medicinal chemistry\nnecessary to translate a `hit' in a small molecule\nscreen into a drug, but this network promises to\nincrease the number and the range of targets that can\nbe interrogated. One might expect that early years of\nthis project will largely be focused on cancer and\nmetabolic targets, but the advent of targets for mental\ndisorders should allow rapid development of new\ncompounds for cell biology, some of which may\ngraduate to medications with novel mechanisms of\naction.\nOnce new compounds are available from in vitro\nscreening, they can be tested in whole animals.\nWhereas `animal models' in psychiatry have largely\nbeen developed to simulate psychopathology and\nvalidated by their response to existing medications,\ndrug discovery models are created based on a\npathologic mechanism and used to search for new\ntargets and ultimately new compounds. For instance,\nthe identification of the role of specific genes in\nAlzheimer's disease has led to the creation of flies,\nfish, and mice with homologous alleles, a similar\nphenotype, and a model system for testing new\ninterventions.31 While similar progress has been\nreported in a number of neurodevelopmental dis-\norders recently, including Fragile X and Rett syn-\ndrome, we have not yet seen the first `animal model'\nof a psychiatric disorder in which various genetic\nlesions are used to develop the phenotype.32,33\nFinally, new compounds can be tested in clinical\ntrials. Trials may increasingly be public rather than\nprivate. The NIH Roadmap as part of its effort to re-\nengineer clinical research has proposed the develop-\nment of a national network of clinical trialists who\ncan move quickly to test the efficacy and the\neffectiveness of new treatments. Networks have\nalready been developed in pediatric cancer and cystic\nfibrosis, such that nearly every patient becomes a\nparticipant. The NIMH effectiveness trials, such as\nCATIE, STAR-D, and STEP-BD may represent the\nbeginning of such a network for mental illness.\nPrevention\nOur discussion to this point has focused on the\ndevelopment of new medications that could be cures.\nThe approach described above has proven effective\nfor acute myeloid leukemia. The discovery of a single\ntyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL, with effects on myeloid\ntransformation led to a small molecule, imitiab, that\nhas already revolutionized treatment of leukemia and\nother blood disorders.34 This spectacular success is\nnotable because it lays out a pathway of discovery\nthat could lead to cures of many illnesses based on an\nunderstanding of pathophysiology, identifying targets\nfor intervention, and developing effective small\nmolecules. It is also notable because it is relatively\nrare in medicine.\nThe great public health success stories of the past\ncentury are largely stories of prevention. From\nsanitation to vaccines to smoking cessation to the\nuse of statins, we have proven much more successful\nat pre-empting disease than curing it. What do we\nneed to pre-empt or prevent mental disorders? As\nwith sanitation, there are undoubtedly public health\ninterventions that will change social norms and\nimprove functioning. For instance, a nurse visitation\nprogram for new mothers reduces antisocial behavior\nin their offspring even 15 years after the interven-\ntion.35 This is an important contribution but there is\nno evidence that such public health interventions\nreduce morbidity and mortality of schizophrenia,\nmood disorders, or autism. Psychiatry will need to\ndevelop strategies for prevention for each of these\ndisorders.\nTwo recent approaches offer promise. Most people\nwith schizophrenia have symptoms of this illness for\nmore than 18 months before they become overtly\npsychotic.36 Studies of the prodrome have reported a\nstrategy to identify those who will go on to have a\npsychotic break with 86% sensitivity and 91%\nspecificity.37 Analogous to identifying those at risk\nfor myocardial infarction, one can imagine that early\nintervention could pre-empt the psychotic break and\nprevent the long-term disability of this illness. In\ncardiology, biomarkers (plasma lipids), family history,\nand functional imaging are all critical for identifying\nrisk, and statins, exercise, and even surgical inter-\nventions are essential for prevention. In schizophre-\nnia, we lack biomarkers and imaging has not yet been\ndeveloped for clinical use. Also, we do not know if\neither medication or psychosocial interventions will\npre-empt a psychotic break. Nevertheless, we have an\nopportunity to develop a strategy for pre-emption that\ncould have an impact as great as or even greater than a\nnew, effective class of drugs.\nIn many ways, PTSD is a disorder defined by a\nfailure of recovery. Following trauma, an acute\nemotional response is expected and potentially\nadaptive. Whereas, most individuals recover from\ntrauma, a small percentage subsequently develop\nPTSD, the actual percentage resulting from a complex\nmix of individual vulnerability and the nature of the\ntrauma. Identifying who is at risk for PTSD could\nfocus intervention efforts, much as we do now in\ncardiovascular disease. Shalev and co-workers have\ntested a transcriptional approach to identify a finger-\nCure therapeutics and strategic prevention\nTR Insel and EM Scolnick\nMolecular Psychiatry\nprint for susceptibility; others have recommended\nspecific clinical features of the early stress response\nthat indicate a high likelihood for subsequent\nPTSD.38,39 We do not yet have the equivalent of\ncholesterol or Thallium imaging for PTSD, but the\nmodel clearly has promise as there are several\nbehavioral and medical interventions that might pre-\nNote that both of these examples require a better\nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of mental\ndisorders, not for developing interventions but for\nidentifying risk. As in the rest of medicine, genomics\nwill be essential, but we will need epidemiology and\ndevelopmental neuroscience to understand how these\nillnesses develop if we are to pre-empt them.\nConclusion\nMental illnesses are among the most disabling of\nmedical illnesses. Currently evidence-based medical\nand psychosocial treatments are not delivered to the\nmajority of patients who would benefit. These\npalliative treatments are necessary but not sufficient.\nEven with optimal care, many patients with mental\nillness will not recover, where recovery is defined as\npermanent remission. Patients need rapid, effective\ntreatments that target the core pathophysiology of\nthese illnesses. And they need tools for early detec-\ntion and preventive interventions. Psychiatric re-\nsearch can develop new diagnostic markers and\ntreatments, but this will require defining the patho-\nphysiology of these illnesses. We now have the\nresearch tools necessary. Now is the time for research\nto set an ambitious goal of finding cures and\npreventive interventions for these disabling illnesses.\nReferences\n1 Kennedy M.
