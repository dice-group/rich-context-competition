    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current study adapts the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health behavior to injection drug using\nrisk behaviors and risk for Hepatitis C (HCV). Briefly, this model postulates that prevention behaviors are directly influenced\nby an individual's knowledge about a disease, their motivation to avoid the disease and their skills and capacity to engage in\nprevention behaviors, while information and motivation also directly influence behavioral skills. Scales for HCV information,\nmotivation and behavioral skills were included in the New Orleans arm of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS)\nof Injection Drug Use study. A structural equation model was tested on a sample of 108 current injection drug users\nrecruited in December 2012. Results showed good fit of the IMB model. Although participants had high levels of information\nand knowledge about HCV transmission, information was not found to relate to either behavioral skills or needle sharing.\nHigher levels of skills were directly related to lower levels of needle sharing. In addition, motivation had an indirect effect on\nneedle sharing that was mediated through skills. Many approaches to HIV and HCV prevention focus on increasing awareness\nand information about HIV and risk behaviors. This model, however, appears to indicate that increasing awareness may not\nbe as effective as interventions or programs that increase behavioral skills or motivation coupled with skills building. Although\nsome HIV/STD prevention interventions, such as motivational interviews do attempt to capitalize on this relationship, more\nefforts should be made to incorporate this important link into high impact prevention programs.\n",

In the United States alone, it\nhas been estimated that more than three million people are\nliving with chronic HCV (Centers for Disease Control and\nmortality due to HCV has now surpassed deaths due to HIV\n(Smith et al., 2012). Although the CDC has declared HCV a\ngeneralized epidemic and recommends screening for persons\nabove 55 (Smith et al., 2012), injection drug use remains the\nmain route of transmission for HCV. Prevention of and\nunderstanding needle sharing and other unsafe injection\npractices therefore is critical to reducing the spread of HCV.\nJ. D. Fisher and Fisher (1992) originally proposed the\nInformation-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model\ndescribing HIV prevention behaviors. This model postulated\na direct relationship between HIV prevention behaviors and\nthree independent constructs (factors). The first construct is\nthe amount of prevention-related information an individual\npossesses, such that information about prevention behaviors\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition for engaging in the\nbehaviors themselves. Second, motivation to engage in pre-\nvention behaviors increases the likelihood of performing the\nbehavior. Finally, an individual's skill in performing the\nbehavior is directly related with behavioral completion. In\naddition to these direct paths, the effect of information and\nmotivation is mediated through behavioral skills such that\nboth may affect skill acquisition and therefore behavior.\n1LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans School of Public Health, USA\n2`Louisiana Department of Health, Office of Public Health STD/HIV\nProgram, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nWilliam T.

A.\nFisher, 2012), abstinence (Bazargan, Kelly, Stein, Husaini, &\nBazargan, 2000), as well as broader general health topics\nincluding nutrition, diabetes, and dieting behaviors (Gao,\nWang, Zhu, & Yu, 2013; Goodell, Pierce, Amico, & Ferris,\nMatseke, & Zuma, 2011), substance use, and smoking cessa-\ntion (Shell, Newman, Perry, & Folsom, 2011).\nSome of these studies have met with limited success at dem-\nonstrating all theorized relationships (i.e., paths) predicted by\nthe IMB model leading some to suggest that the utility of the\nmodel is best suited as a framework for intervention develop-\nment (Kalichman, Picciana, & Roffman, 2008). Many studies\nhave either adapted portions of the model for use in intervention\nresearch (Konkle-Parker, Amico, & McKinney, 2014; Kudo,\nused path analytic approaches to test the relationships in the\nmodel (Amico, Toro-Alfonso, & Fisher, 2005). Few studies\nhave applied the model to specific risk factors of needle sharing\nand unsafe injection practice. None, however, have included\nneedle sharing behavior or hepatitis disease risks as outcome\nconstructs. The purpose of the current study then is to adapt the\nIMB model to injection behaviors and HCV risk and to test the\nfit of the resultant model within a structural equation modeling\n(SEM) environment.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFive hundred four persons who inject drugs were surveyed as\npart of the New Orleans Louisiana arm of the CDC NHBS\nsystem during August to December 2012. Eligibility require-\nments were that participants were 18 years of age or older,\nwere a residents of the New Orleans seven parish metropoli-\ntan area, were able to take the survey in English, and had\ninjected drugs within the past 12 months. Current injector\nstatus was carefully screened using visible signs of recent\ninjection and/or detailed knowledge of injection practice.\nRecruitment\nParticipants were recruited through the NHBS of Injection\nDrug Use study using respondent driven sampling (RDS)\nprocedures, which have been described elsewhere (Lansky\net al., 2007). RDS is a modified chain referral approach that\nuses a dual incentive structure, which has been shown to\nhave success recruiting members of hidden populations such\nas persons who inject drugs (Abdul-Quader et al., 2006;\nRobinson et al., 2006). Following these procedures, a set of\neight known members of the target population acted as initial\n\"seeds,\" were surveyed, and were offered a free HIV and\nHCV test. Each seed was then given the opportunity to\nrecruit up to five members of their social network who were\nknown by them to be current injectors. Each respondent was\nthen also surveyed, offered an HIV test, and given the oppor-\ntunity to recruit up to five respondents. Recruitment pro-\nceeded in this fashion until both a sufficient number of waves\nto reach equilibrium and the desired sample size was reached.\nRespondents received a US$20 value gift card for survey\nparticipation and an additional US$20 gift cart for HIV test-\ning. An additional US$10 gift card was provided for each\nsuccessfully recruited additional respondent.\nInstruments\nThe NHBS core survey instrument was administered to each\nparticipant. The approximately 40-min survey covers a wide\nspectrum of questions on sexual behavior, substance use, and\nHIV testing behaviors as indicators of HIV risk. An addi-\ntional set of scales for the information, motivation, and\nbehavioral skills constructs were developed by adapting\nitems from the literature. These items were asked to a subset\nof respondents during the last month of the survey; therefore\nonly the 108 individuals who completed the survey in\nDecember 2012 were used for purposes of these analyses.\nHCV transmission information (Cronbach's  = .64) was\nindicated by a set of five knowledge items on the ways HCV\nis transmitted adapted from Balfour's HCV knowledge scale\n(Balfour et al., 2009). Although some IMB studies have con-\nceptualized the information factor as containing domains of\nprevention knowledge as well as generalized knowledge\nabout the disease of interest, only transmission information\nwas included in this study. Questions were a set of statements\nsuch as `HCV is a virus transmitted by blood' that partici-\npants were asked to rate as true or false. Correct answers\nwere coded at unity while incorrect answers and responses of\n\"don't know\" were coded as zero. Table 1 presents all ques-\ntion wording.\nMotivation (Cronbach's  = .74) to avoid HCV infection\nincluded four items such as \"I would never share needles or\nworks with anyone who had hepatitis.\" These items were\ncoded on a 5-point Likert-type scale of agreement (i.e., 0 =\nstrongly disagree; 1 = disagree; 2 = neither agree nor dis-\nagree; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree).\nThe HCV Behavioral Skills scale (Cronbach's  = .87)\nconsisted of five Likert-type items on perceived behavioral\ncontrol of personal injection practices adapted from Kang,\nDeren, Andia, Colon, and Robles (2004). Example questions\nincluded \"I am sure that I could always use a clean needle to\nRobinson 3\ninject with.\" Questions were worded such that higher scores\nreflected greater certainty in risk behavior avoidance (0 =\nvery unsure, 1 = unsure, 2 = neither sure nor unsure, 3 =\nsure, 4 = very sure).\nThe endogenous risk construct of the IMB model was\ndefined in terms of Needle Sharing Behaviors (Cronbach's \n= .86), which was operationalized by four core survey items\ndescribing frequency of sharing needles, sharing injection\nequipment, sharing cotton, and sharing water. Each item was\nmeasured on a 5-point Likert-type scale with end and mid-\npoints describing frequency of each behavior within the past\n12 months (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = about half the time, 4 =\nmost of the time, 5 = always). Higher levels indicate more\nfrequent risk behaviors (e.g., \"In the past 12 months how\noften did you use needles that someone else had already\ninjected with?\").\nEach respondent was also offered a free rapid HIV test\nwith a Clearview Complete HIV-1/2 screening performed\non blood obtained by fingerstick, which was followed by\nconfirmatory Western blot if needed. Respondents were\nalso offered a rapid OraQuick Rapid HCV antibody\nscreening test. Based on the result of the rapid HCV test\nand self-reported previous HCV diagnosis, HCV status\nwas collapsed into a single categorical variable (HCV\nnegative, previous HCV positive, newly detected HCV).\nAll respondents received the results of their HIV and HCV\nscreening tests and appointments were made for individu-\nals who received confirmatory exams to receive their\nresults within 2 weeks. All participants received appropri-\nate referrals for services based on the responses to the sur-\nvey and test results.\nAnalyses\nThe hypothesized IMB model was tested using Mplus\nVersion 7 (Muthen & Muthen). Figure 1 displays a graphic\nrepresentation of the model with the two covarying exog-\nenous constructs of information and motivation with\ndirect paths leading to the behavioral skills and risk\nbehavior constructs. In addition, direct paths from behav-\nioral skills onto risk behavior and from risk behavior to\nHCV disease outcome were included. Total, direct and\nindirect effects from information and motivation onto risk\nwere assessed. Because the model included dichotomous\nitems identifying the information construct and the cate-\ngorical disease outcome measure, robust weighted least\nsquares (WLSMV) estimation methods were used to\nobtain model estimates. The specified model was overi-\ndentified with 58 degrees of freedom and converged\nnormally.\nTable 1.

Fifty-nine percent of respondents were African\nAmerican, 34% were White, and 3% were Hispanic. Previously\ndiagnosed HIV positive individuals comprised 6.5% of the sam-\nple, and 1.8% were newly identified based on HIVconfirmatory\ntesting. One quarter of participants (25%) had been ever told by\na doctor that they had HCV (also confirmed by screening), and\n29.6% were newly detected HCV cases. Table 2 presents the\nfull correlation matrix between indicator variables.\nMeasurement Model\nThe overall model fit was good with several standard mea-\nsures indicating good fit of the model. Chi-square for the ini-\nTucker\u00adLewis fit index (TLI = .892) were adequate. The root\nmean square error of approximation was .036 (confidence\nsatisfied the tests of closeness of fit (p = .815) and exactness\nof fit. All paths from latent constructs to the manifest indica-\ntors in the measurement model were found to significantly\nload on their respective construct with the exception of the\npreviously diagnosed HCV variable (H1 see Figure 1).\nStructural Model\nThe standardized direct structural path from the behavioral\ninjection risk construct was found to be significant (see\nFigure 1).

Overall fit of the model was\ngood. The structural paths from behavioral skills as well as\nthe mediational path from motivation through behavioral\nskills were found to be significant while knowledge did not\nmeaningfully contribute to the structural model. Furthermore,\nthe path from HCV risk behaviors to detection of HCV\nthrough a rapid screening procedure was found to be\nsignificant.\nOne interesting aspect of this study may be the inclusion\ndirect measures of HCV disease status as well as behavioral\nrisk factors as outcomes in an IMB SEM model. An\nFigure 1. IMB structural model of injection-related risk and HCV infection.\nNote. All paths are presented in standardized form. IMB = information-motivation-behavioral skills.\n*Correlations significant at least the .05 level.\nRobinson 5\nexploratory model including the additional outcome of HIV\ninfection was considered, however, was discarded because all\nquestion domains were specific to HCV rather than HIV risk\nand infection and because inclusion of the HIV indicator led to\nlinear dependencies within the model due to small cell sizes.\nAlthough the current model fit the data adequately, some\nweaknesses of the current study should be noted both in\nterms of methodology as well as measurement. These include\nthe standard methodological issues with self-report and cross\nsectional nature of the NHBS parent study. This is especially\nrelevant given the possible differential in timeframes between\nHCV infection and risk behavior in the past 12 months. It\nshould also be noted that, while the RDS sampling procedure\nshould yield asymptotically correct population parameter\nestimates after applying adjustments for homophily and net-\nwork size (Heckathorn, 2002), these adjustments were not\nmade. This was due to the fact that the additional IMB ques-\ntions were administered to a subset of respondents thus inter-\nrupting the recruitment chains needed to achieve the\nequilibrium needed by RDS estimation procedures.\nFurthermore, the primary interest in this study is to model the\nassociations between manifest variables and underlying fac-\ntor patterns rather than the point prevalence estimates and\nmethods for adjusting these correlational measures have not\nyet been fully developed.\nIn terms of measurement error, other studies using longer\nscales have shown higher reliability as well as lower levels\nof HCV knowledge in the injection population (Heimer\ndifficulty of items may have resulted in range restriction and\ncould have contributed to the lack of observed relationship\nbetween the knowledge construct and other hypothesized\nfactors. J. D. Fisher and Fisher (1992) specifically caution\nabout this, warning that specialized knowledge in high risk\npopulations may make finding this relationship difficult\nstating,\nFinally, in some relevant populations (e.g., urban gay men who\nbelong to homophile organizations, college students), extant\nlevels of the type of knowledge measured on such ecologically\ninvalid instruments are extremely high, and ceiling effects make\na knowledge-prevention relationship difficult to detect.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the factors as measured in\nthis study did not fully capture the domains of the IMB model.\nFor example, information was operationalized specifically as\nknowledge about HCV transmission whereas the construct\nhas been conceptualized elsewhere as more global disease-\nrelated knowledge. Similarly, the motivation construct was\nindicated by items that centered more heavily on behavioral\nintentions and less so on other domains such as social norms.\nFinally, the behavioral skills items have also been operation-\nalized differently in other studies in that these questions are\nrelated to perceived behavioral control (i.e., \"How sure are\nyou . . . ?\") rather than perceived ability (i.e., \"How easy\nwould it be . . . ?). Ultimately, the current study provides valu-\nable information on the utility of the IMB model in describing\nthe relationships between a person's motivation, knowledge,\nand behavioral skills to avoid injection risk behaviors.
