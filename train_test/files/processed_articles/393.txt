One response was the Nursing Home Reform\nAct, passed as part of the Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1987. This stressed the\nphysical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of\neach resident and increased government regulation as\na strategy to improve quality care (Winzelberg,\n2003). As concerns continued, new models of\ncommunity-based care emerged, such as assisted\nliving facilities, adult foster care, residential care, and\nmodel programs such as the Program of All-Inclusive\nCare for the Elderly (Eng, Pedulla, Eleazer, McCann,\n& Fox, 1997; Kane, Kane, Illston, Nyman, & Finch,\n1991; Park, Zimmerman, Sloane, Gruber-Baldini, &\nEckert, 2006). In spite of these developments, health\nprofessionals, service providers, older adults, and\nfamily members have continued to challenge long-\nterm care practices. Talerico, O'Brien, and Swafford\n(2003) described care as too often being an ``in-\ndustrialized, assembly line model of care'' (p. 15)\nemphasizing organizational routine, staff needs, and\nregulatory concerns over the needs and preferences\nof residents. Such practices are characterized as\ndepersonalizing and disempowering both for those\nwho receive care and for the direct care workers\n(DCWs) who, after family, are those who are most\nintimately involved in providing care. As examples,\npersonal care such as bathing is scheduled by staff\nwith limited attention to resident preferences; meal\nservices are regimented, with limited resident choices\nwith respect to when, where, what, and with whom\nto eat; and too little attention is given to nurturing\nrelationships among residents or between residents\nand staff.\nMore recently, multiple providers, policy makers,\nand researchers have offered alternatives to this\ninstitutional approach with the aim of improving\nAddress correspondence to Dr. Diana White, Institute on Aging,\nE-mail: dwhi@pdx.edu\n1Institute on Aging, Portland State University, Portland.\n2Psychology Department, Portland State University.\n3School of Nursing, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.\nquality of life and quality of care. These efforts to\ntransform the way society cares for and supports\nthose who are disabled or infirm have occurred in\nhospital settings (e.g., Coyle & Williams, 2001;\nFrampton, Gilpin, & Charmel, 2003), within the\ndisabled community (e.g., O'Brien & O'Brien, 2002;\nSmull & Lakin, 2002), and within long-term care\nParticular attention has been given to supporting\npeople with dementia (e.g., Beck et al., 2002;\nAs a result of these collective efforts, experts have\nproposed or developed new models of long-term\ncare, including the Wellspring Model, Eden Alter-\nnative, Green House Project, Live Oak Regenerative\nCommunity, and others. At the federal level, the\nVeterans Affairs administration sponsored a national\nsummit on culture change in 2005, and the Centers\nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services are supporting\nwork in culture change (Bowman & Schoeneman,\n2006). The Pioneer Network, a movement that began\nin the 1990s, is an umbrella organization supporting\nthe development and implementation of these\n``culture change'' models (Fagan, 2003; Lustbader,\n2001). Through this collective work, a new paradigm\nof person-centered care is emerging that stresses the\nuniqueness and worth of each individual and the\nnecessity to be respectful and reflective of individu-\nals' distinct histories, values, and preferences in\ndesigning long-term care environments and in pro-\nviding care.\nThe practice models described previously depend\non a stable and educated workforce (Rader &\nHarahan, 2004). Yet, for multiple reasons, long-term\ncare systems face significant shortages of staff and\nhigh turnover at all levels. The Better Jobs Better\nCare (BJBC) program, funded by the Atlantic\nPhilanthropies and the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation and administered by the Institute for\nthe Future of Aging Services, was developed to\naddress the looming long-term care workforce crisis\nby attending to the needs of DCWs and building\nwork environments that will support both workers\nand those they serve. Oregon received of one of five\ndemonstration grants.\nThe overarching goal of the Oregon BJBC\ninitiative was to instill a person-centered philosophy\nof care and to operationalize that philosophy\nthrough person-directed care (PDC) practices in\na range of long-term care settings. The project\nidentified four objectives to help accomplish this\ngoal: (a) to improve relationships between DCWs\nand their supervisors, (b) to improve relationships\nbetween DCWs and residents/clients and their\nfamilies, (c) to provide opportunities for career\ndevelopment, and (d) to increase workforce diversity\nand support for diversity. Loosely modeled after the\nWellspring model (Stone et al., 2002), each partici-\npating organization identified a site coordinator\nresponsible for project implementation. They de-\nveloped a practice site team consisting of DCWs,\nsupervisors, and others who would determine how\nobjectives would be met at their organization. All\nOregon BJBC site coordinators met monthly, usually\nwith their practice teams, to receive training and\nresources specific to project objectives. Consultation\nwas available to each site from the BJBC project\nmanager. Each practice site received $75,000 over the\n3 years of the grant to support BJBC activities as\ndetermined by that site.\nA local evaluation team assessed success in\nmeeting project goals and objectives. Because PDC\nwas a central concept, it was imperative to measure\nthe extent to which each organization was using\nPDC practices. This proved challenging; a cohesive\ndefinition or even agreed-upon terms related to these\nconcepts had not yet emerged (Lauver, Ward, et al.,\ndirected care is used to denote the action of\nproviding support to those in care, other terms\nhave also been used, sometimes interchangeably,\nincluding person-centered planning, person- or\nresident-centered care, or individualized care. We\nelected to use the term person directed because of\nour emphasis on the person himself or herself\ncontrolling or guiding care regardless of disability.\nWe found no existing instruments that captured the\nkinds of dimensions that experts in person-centered\nand person-directed practice were providing to the\nOregon BJBC practice sites. Therefore, we sought\nto develop our own measure. The purpose of\nthis article is to describe three phases in the develop-\nment and testing of a measure to assess PDC: con-\ncept analysis, item development and analysis, and\nfactor analysis.\nPhase 1: Concept Refinement and Item\nGeneration\nDefining PDC and developing an instrument was\nan iterative process that began with experts who had\nextensive research and practice experience. Included\nwas a research team coordinated by the Oregon\nHealth & Science University Hartford Center of\nGeriatric Nursing Excellence with interests and\nresearch experience in areas related to PDC, such\nas individualized care, autonomy, dementia care, and\nDCWs. Practice experts included experienced clini-\ncians and providers who had long emphasized\nindividualized care or person-centered planning and\nwho provided training and consultation to Oregon\nBJBC practice sites specific to PDC.\nBased on discussions within each of these expert\ngroups, we generated items to capture the essence of\nPDC that was emerging in each group. We divided\nthese items into two broad categories: (a) what was\nknown about residents' preferences, values, and\nchoices about a wide range of care issues; and (b)\nwhat staff did to act upon that knowledge. Both\nresearch and practice experts reviewed items, with\npractice experts adding several more. The result was\n113 items that were administered across the eight\npractice sites. Only 114 staff completed the surveys.\nIn addition, we presented the tool at the national\n2004 Pioneer Network meetings. The audience\ncontained both researchers and practice experts\nwho provided feedback on items and design.\nStatistical analysis revealed variability in response\nto most items, and feedback from BJBC site\ncoordinators indicated that the items were meaning-\nful. Because of the large number of items and small\nsample, however, findings were difficult to interpret.\nFeedback from Pioneer Network attendees indicated\nthat more conceptual development was needed.\nConcept Development\nThe research team returned to the literature to\nclarify concepts and systematically develop a defini-\ntion of PDC. We searched for person-centered care,\nperson-centred care, dementia care, individualized\ncare, elder care, and culture change. After reviewing\napproximately 25 articles, we began to cluster similar\nconcepts contained in these articles. We identified five\ncentral dimensions of PDC: personhood, knowing\nthe person, autonomy and choice, comfort care, and\nnurturing relationship. We also identified a sixth\ndimension, a supportive environment, that appeared\nto be critical for supporting PDC practices. Included\nwere physical and organizational aspects of the\nenvironment. No single article described all six\ndimensions, although articles typically included\nmore than one. We continued to review the literature,\nwhich provided additional support for these dimen-\nsions. Our research experts reviewed and supported\nthe dimensions and definitions, providing additional\nface validity for these concepts. We present brief\ndescriptions of each concept here.\nPersonhoodemphasizes that each person is unique,\nhas inherent value, and is worthy of respect and\nhonor regardless of disease or disability (Booker,\nBrown, Weston, McWhinney, & Helns, 1995). Care\ncenters on the individual in contrast to the provider\nor caregiver, with emphasis on understanding the\nperspectives of those receiving care as well as the\nmeaning they attach to their circumstances (Beck\nstrengths, abilities and possibilities are considered, as\nare social contributions the person continues to make\nStrumpf, & Burger, 1996; Holburn, Jacobson,\nSchwartz, Flory, & Vietze, 2004). Continuing de-\nvelopment of one's total self is assumed as reflected by\ntheir interests, values, preferences, spirituality, and\nhopes and dreams (Coker, 1998; Ford & McCormack,\nThe second dimension was knowing the person\nEach person has his or her own life story, cultural\nexperiences, personality, pattern of daily living,\nvalues, needs, and preferences (Williams, 1990;\nWolverson, 2003). Care involves supporting continu-\nity between who the person has been and who the\nperson isnowbyproviding carein amanner consistent\nwith that person's biography and with what is\nimportant to the person now (Rader, 1995; Sanborn,\n1988). Knowing the person is essential to individual-\nHolmes, Benenson,Manaco,Barrett, & Koren, 1992) .\nFurthermore, it is critical for understanding the\nmeaning of behavioral symptoms in individuals with\ndementia or other cognitive impairment.\nFor care to be person directed, individuals must\nhave maximum control over their own care and\nenvironments (Grant & Norton, 2003; Happ et al.,\nKane et al., 2003; Matthews, Farrell, & Blackmore,\ntherefore, involved autonomy and choice. In a person-\ndirected environment, the assumption is that inde-\npendence enhances competence and that care must\nbe supportive of personal agency. Emphasis is on\nempowering residents, even those with cognitive\nimpairments, to make their own decisions about their\ncare, schedules, and activities. In cases of severe\nimpairment, choices are to be supported by DCWs,\nwho spend the most time with the person, to ensure\nthat care reflects individual preferences, interests, and\nvalues. This means no fixed schedules for activities\nsuch as dining, bathing, or other personal care\nservices (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Rabig,\nThomas, Kane, Cutler, & McAlilly, 2006). Addition-\nally, the right of individuals to take risks and, in\nsome cases, to make ``poor'' decisions is emphasized\nThe fourth dimension involved nurturing rela-\ntionships. Each person lives and functions within\na web of relationships. Person-centered environments\nstrive to reduce social isolation and promote friend-\nrelationships between care providers and the person\n(and his or her family) promote communication,\nconsistency, trust, attachment, friendship, and part-\nnership and minimize isolation and conflict. Positive\nrelationships between staff and residents, therefore,\nare necessary if staff are going to know the person\n(Rader, 1995) or appropriately promote quality of\ndimension of PDC are encouraging staff to eat\nwith residents, spend time talking with them, and\notherwise be engaged together in a wide variety of\nactivities (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Rabig\net al., 2006). Consistent assignments are considered\none way to promote staff-resident relationships\n(Teresi et al., 1992). People often lose contact with\nthe community at large once they become dependent.\nFormer ties are supported through PDC, both by\nbringing the community into a facility (e.g., volun-\nteers, the arts, youth) as well as enabling people to\nleave the premises to spend time at places or with\nindividuals important to them.\nComfort care includes attending to both physical\nand emotional care needs using the highest standards\nof practice (e.g., pain control, comfort, alternatives to\nrestraints, bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, skin\ncare, wheelchair seating) that are tailored to in-\ndividual needs and preferences (Beck et al., 2002;\nBowers, Fibich, & Jacobson, 2001; Hoeffer, Talerico,\n1990). A balance between freedom and choice with\nfort care means attending to mental health and psy-\nchological needs (Bowers et al., 2001; Harr &\nKasayka, 2000). It is especially important to view\nbehaviors associated with dementia as symptoms of\nunmet needs, such as uncontrolled pain, medication\nside effects, or fear and feelings of insecurity. Practices\nsuch as consistent assignments contribute to comfort\ncare because staff who have relationships with res-\nidents are more likely to notice physical or emotional\nchanges requiring attention (Teresi, et al., 1992).\nThe final dimension concerned a supportive envi-\nronment. The ability to provide PDC is dependent\nupon characteristics of the system in which care is\nprovided. Research has identified two components of\nthe environment: physical and organizational. Cutler,\nKane, Degenholtz, Miller, and Grant (2006) identified\nlayout, furnishings, dining areas, bathing areas,\npersonalized living areas, and outdoor space as linked\nto quality of life. Increasing attention has also been\ngiven to environments that support autonomy, par-\nticularly for individuals with dementia (Beck et al.,\nSlaughter, Calkins, Eliasziw, & Reimer, 2006; Sloane\net al., 2002). The culture change movement empha-\nsizes creating home by eliminating medicine carts,\noverhead pages, long corridors, and tray carts (Cutler\nMany organizational attributes contribute directly\nto quality care including management practices that\nempower and support DCWs; provide training and\nsupport for communication and resident care, skilled\nsupervision and leadership, adequate staffing and\nappropriate workload; and support staff retention\nand reduce staff turnover (Barry, Brannon, & Mor,\nRantz, Hicks, Grando, et al., 2004). Grant and\nNorton (2003) developed a conceptual model of\nculture change that encompasses both physical and\norganizational attributes including decision making,\nstaff roles, physical environment, organizational\ndesign, and leadership practices. According to Harr\nand Kasayka (2000), ``When management and staff\nrespect each other as persons and honor the dignity\nof personhood that implies, high quality of care will\nbe a natural by-product'' (p. 42).\nPhase 2: Item Development and Analysis\nOnce PDC dimensions were established, we\nreturned to item development, creating items that\nwould be reflective of the six dimensions identified\npreviously. We began by sorting the items developed\nin Phase 1 into the six PDC categories and then\ndeveloped new items based on the literature and\nfeedback from practice experts to ensure an adequate\nnumber of items for each concept. We reviewed each\nitem multiple times, discussing clarity of meaning and\nrelevance to the concept it was designed to measure.\nBJBC site coordinators (who included nurses, human\nresource directors, and social services providers)\nreviewed the item pool as content experts. They\nsuggested changes in wording, identified additional\nitems, and recommended items to delete due to\noverlap, lack of relevance, or lack of clarity. Items\nwere tested with DCWs in two nursing homes and an\nassisted living facility that were not part of the BJBC\ninitiative. After each test, we changed or deleted\nitems that were confusing. For example, ``understand\ntheir preferences for care'' became ``know their\npreferred routines (for example, morning, evening,\nmealtime),'' and ``decide who they will live with''\nbecame ``decide who they will share a room with.''\nThe resulting item pool consisted of 89 items (ranging\nfrom 7 to 19 items for each of the six scales). We used\ntwo question stems: ``Thinking about the people in\nyour care, for how many can you . . .?'' and\n``Thinking about the people in your care, how often\n. . .?'' Items were scored from 1 to 5 on a Likert-type\nscale, where 1 indicated ``very few or none'' or\n``rarely or none of the time'' and 5 indicated ``all or\nalmost all'' or ``all or almost all of the time.''\nData Collection for Initial Item Analysis\nThe tool was administered to all levels of staff (e.g.,\nDCWs, nurses, administrators, housekeeping, thera-\npists, social services) in eight organizations partici-\npating in the Oregon BJBC demonstration site (one\nhome care agency, two assisted living facilities, one\nresidential care facility, and four nursing homes).\nTime to complete the surveys (which contained 52\nadditional questions related to other Oregon BJBC\nobjectives) ranged from 20 to 45 min, with nonnative\nEnglish speakers generally taking longer. Research\nstaff was on site to administer and collect completed\nsurveys, including for the night shift in some facilities.\nThe process varied by site according to the preferences\nof the site coordinator and the organization. The 467\nrespondents represented about 60% of the eligible\nstaff across facility-based settings. Home care work-\ners completed surveys at inservices, typically attended\nby about a quarter of the workforce. We eliminated\nrespondents who answered less than 75% of all items,\nresulting in an overall sample for analysis of 423. Most\nof those eliminated were administrative staff or\n``other'' who had little contact with clients or\nresidents. Less than 3% of DCWs who composed\nthe majority of the sample (n = 197 after screening)\nwere removed from the sample because of high levels\nof missing data. Similarly, certified medication aides,\nregistered nurses, licensed practical nurses, admin-\nistrators, and nurse leaders had relatively complete\nlevels of data.\nItem Analysis\nWe conducted several analyses to identify the\nstrongest items and eliminate poorly performing\nitems. We assessed item endorsement by dichoto-\nmizing those scoring high (original response range\n4\u00ad5) and those scoring low (original response range\n1\u00ad3) on the extent to which they felt those in their\ncare received PDC. We calculated mean scores to\ndetermine the proportion of respondents who en-\ndorsed each item. We considered an indication of\nadequate endorsement to be items that scored above .3\nendorsement). We kept one item in the autonomy\nscale that was endorsed by few because it was con-\nceptually important: ``decide who they will share a\nroom with.'' This is a level of autonomy not available\nto most people living in congregate settings but is\nnonetheless illustrative of personal choices that most\nadults make. An example of an item eliminated was\n``Thinking about the people in your care, for how\nmany do you know what they want to be called?,''\nwith 90% of respondents indicating that they did\nknow this about residents/clients in their care.\nWe determined item discrimination by calculating\nthe mean difference between respondents in the top\nand bottom thirds of the distribution (i.e., those\nreporting high levels of PDC and those reporting low\nlevels of PDC). For the item to be retained, the mean\ndifference between these two groups had to exceed\n.20. The item ``Thinking about the people in your\ncare, how often are you able to work with the same\nclients/residents?'' is an example of an item that did\nnot discriminate well. Items intended to assess levels\nof noise and bad odors in the environment failed\nto discriminate and were eliminated. Other analyses\nused to identify and eliminate poorly performing\nitems included exploratory factor analyses and cal-\nculation of Cronbach's alpha. We also considered\nrespondent burden and eliminated some items that\nmet all of the above criteria if analysis of correlations\nand internal consistency reliabilities demonstrated\nthat they were captured by other items. For example,\nin the autonomy scale, we retained the item\n``Thinking about the people in your care, how\nmany of these residents/clients make decisions about\ntheir personal care routines?'' and eliminated several\nitems asking specifically about choices related to bed\ntime and morning routines, choices about eating,\nand choices about bathing. Although each of these\neliminated items represents a different aspect of\ncare, respondents tended to answer them in similar\nways. Eliminating them did not significantly reduce\nreliabilities as measured by Cronbach's alpha. The\nrevised instrument contained 64 items, with each\nsubscale comprising between 7 and 10 items.\nPhase 3: Exploratory Factor Analysis\nData Collection\nTherevisedinstrumentwasadministeredtothesame\norganizations 1 year later, again targeting all staff in the\nparticipating organizations. Based on lessons learned in\nPhase 1, we provided food for staff completing the\nsurveys and once again research staff was on site to\nencourage participation, reassure participants of the\nconfidentiality of their individual responses, and collect\ncompleted surveys. Site coordinators were invaluable in\narranging space and encouraging staff to participate.\nAll employees were paid for the time they took to\ncomplete thesurvey. We weregenerally on site for more\nthan 1 day. In some cases we left surveys for staff to\ncomplete but left envelopes or other secure methods for\nthem to return surveys. These surveys, which also\ncontained items in addition to the PDC items, were\nTo reduce missing data, we were more explicit\nwith instructions to staff who do not routinely\ninteract with residents/clients (e.g., administrative\nsupport staff). We asked them to give their general\nimpressions about the care in their facility or\nprogram. The overall response rate for facility-based\nprograms was approximately 61%. The response rate\nfor the home care program at 25% was considerably\nless. Data from the home care program were\ncollected once again at inservice meetings, introduc-\ning a possible bias toward those who were motivated\nto attend educational programs.\nSample\nWe received a total of 477 surveys across all\nsettings. In spite of efforts to obtain more complete\ndata, we were not entirely successful. Consequently,\nwe eliminated from further analysis those complet-\ning less than 75% of the total items. This resulted in\na final overall sample size of 430. As before, most of\nthe individuals whose responses were eliminated\nfrom the analyses worked as office staff or were\nthose who self-identified as ``other.'' However, this\nprocedure also caused us to lose about 8% of the\nDCWs in the sample. Most of the attrition came\nfrom one nursing home and one assisted living\nfacility where a high proportion of staff spoke\nEnglish as a second language. This may have made\nit more difficult for them to complete the survey.\nTable 1 presents the composition of the sample prior\nto the elimination of cases and the final sample, by\njob title and place of work.\nItems designed to tap organizational environ-\nmental attributes, although essential to supporting\nPDC, were conceptually different from those that\ntapped PDC, exerting a more supportive influence\non PDC. Consequently, we conducted two sets of\nanalyses, first of items developed to reflect the five\nPDC dimensions (personhood, autonomy/choice,\nknowing the person, comfort, nurturing relation-\nships; 45 items), followed by items developed to\ncapture the physical and organizational environ-\nData Analysis: PDC\nThe correlation matrix revealed correlations\nranging between .04 and .79. Two items (``know\nwhat kinds of TV programs they prefer'' and ``help\nstay dry'') did not correlate well with any items.\nEight items had correlations above .70 (e.g., ``keep\nthem connected to their families''). Next, we cal-\nculated item endorsement and discrimination scores\nby using the procedures and cutoffs described\npreviously. We then employed exploratory factor\nanalyses to aid in the identification of the underlying\nstructure of the items and to help in the ultimate\nreduction of items within components.\nAn initial principal components analysis of the 45\nitems for the five major PDC domains suggested nine\nTogether these explained 69.11% of the variance.\nHowever, an examination of the scree plot indicated\na clear break after five factors. Principal axis\nfactoring with direct oblimin rotation, which allows\nfactors to be correlated, was then run with the\nstipulation of five factors. Clear simple structure was\nachieved using a cutoff for loadings on the pattern\nmatrix of .40 and with the exception that one item\n(i.e., ``share some things about yourself'') failed to\nload above .29 on any factor.\nExamination of item endorsement and discrimi-\nnation scores, means, standard deviations, inter-item\ncorrelations, factor loadings, and theoretical judg-\nments led to the deletion of nine items. We reran\nprincipal axis factoring, resulting in five factors with\nclear simple structure. These factors explained 61%\nof the variance. All items loaded above .40, with\ncommunalities ranging from .34 to .82. Each factor\nshowed good internal consistency: Table 2 presents\nthe final items, factor loadings, and Cronbach's\nalphas.\nTable 1.

Each job type contains the original number of respondents on the left-hand side, followed on the right-\nhand side by the number of respondents after we screened out those who answered less than 75% of the items.\nData Analysis: Environmental Support for PDC\nWe ran analyses in a similar fashion with the\norganizational items. Inter-item correlations for the\nEnvironment Support items ranged from .09 to .72.\nWe followed this with analyses to examine scores for\nitem endorsement and discrimination. A principal\ncomponents analysis of the 19 items suggested\na three- (56% of the variance) or four-factor (62%\nof the variance) solution with eigenvalues of 7.18,\nwas better, we conducted both a three- and four-\nfactor principal axis factoring with direct oblimin\nrotation. Neither solution produced the desired\nsimple structure initially. Based on a combination\nof the item endorsement and discrimination analyses,\ninter-item correlations, and information from the\nfactor analyses, we dropped four items. We then\nreran principal axis factoring stipulating three\nfactors and achieved good simple structure. This\nsolution explained 60% of the variance. Conceptually\nTable 2.

We are also\ninterested in comparing staff perceptions about PDC\nto family and resident/client perceptions of care. A\nmeasure of family perspectives about PDC is in\ndevelopment (White, Lyons, Boise, & Newton-\nCurtis, 2005). The resident or client voice, however,\ntends to be missing from research. An exception is\nwork by Mahan (2005), who developed a measure of\nresident autonomy. Research is needed to explore the\nconcepts of PDC with residents/clients to determine\nthe extent to which the five dimensions resonate\nwith their preferences and values. If they do, the\nfield needs valid measures to determine if residents/\nclients feel they are viewed as unique and valued\nindividuals, experience autonomy, feel well known\nby those who are providing intimate services, are\nemotionally and physically comfortable, and experi-\nence opportunities to be in relationships with those\nthey care about.\nThe PDC measurement tool needs further testing.\nThose participating in BJBC are generally high-\nperforming facilities. Eliminated items might have\nhad lower endorsement in other settings and there-\nfore could be used to distinguish between high- and\nlow-performing organizations. Although this process\nhas helped to build evidence of validity through\nwork with practice and research experts, more work\nis needed to determine whether staff perceptions of\nPDC match more objective assessments of PDC.\nSimilarly, it would be useful to compare responses to\nthis measure with others tapping into related\nconcepts. Examples include the measures of culture\nchange being developed through the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services, or various quality-\nof-life measures that have been developed in long-\nterm care. As PDC practice evolves, this instrument\nwill need to develop further as well. We eventually\neliminated items felt to measure key aspects of PDC\nfrom our final measure because they did not fit\ncriteria of inclusion (e.g., How many residents/\nclients in your care select who they will share a room\nwith? Are you evaluated by how well you support\nresident choices?). Yet these items are considered\nrepresentative of desired culture changes. Accom-\nmodation is also needed for those who are nonnative\nEnglish speakers. We did not have the resources to\ntranslate surveys and would recommend doing so in\nthe future. Interviews by someone who speaks the\nsame language may also be an important method of\nreaching those who feel uncomfortable with reading\nand writing.\nThroughout BJBC and other culture change\ninitiatives in Oregon, we have observed a progression\nin understanding of PDC practices. The initial\nresponse to PDC, especially among administrative\nstaff, was that ``we are already doing that.'' It was not\nuntil months after learning more about the concepts\nand working to implement new practices that some\nstaff reported ``we weren't as person centered as we\nthought.'' Preliminary analysis suggests that PDC\nscores declined in some settings over time, which\nindicates to us that staff are more critically evaluating\ntheir ability to provide PDC services. Longitudinal\nresearch is needed to determine whether PDC scores\ntypically decline and then increase as new PDC\npractices become more integrated into the setting.\nFinally, we believe individual items have the\npotential to provide concrete guidance to long-term\ncare providers who want to change practice but are\nuncertain about what that change might entail or\nwhat it might look like when it occurs. Also\nimportant to note is that some items previously\neliminated because of low respondent endorsement\nor because of statistical redundancy may nonetheless\nhold practical significance for training purposes and\nthus should not be disregarded completely.\nReferences\nBarry, T., Brannon, D., & Mor, V.
