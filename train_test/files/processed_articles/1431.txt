WHR increased with age between\nages 20 and 49. WHR showed signi\u00aecant positive associations with log serum ferritin concentration independent of age and\nbody mass index (BMI). The association was strongest at age 20 \u00b1 29 y among those with BMI below the median. Associations\nwith other indices of body fat distribution and overall obesity are described.\nCONCLUSION: Serum ferritin concentration is associated with WHR and other indices of body fat distribution and obesity.\nFurther research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and signi\u00aecance of these \u00aendings.\nKeywords: ferritin, serum; Hispanics; male; adipose tissue; age factors; obesity\nIntroduction\nFew studies have examined the relationship of body iron\nstores and indices of body fat distribution, despite the\nrelationship postulated for both variables with coronary\nheart disease and ischemic stroke.1 \u00b1 6 One study of Nor-\nwegian men reported independent associations of serum\nferritin, the best serum indicator of body iron stores, with\nwaist-to-thigh ratio and body mass index (BMI).7 In a small\nstudy of healthy volunteers, no association of serum ferritin\nwith waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was found, although serum\nferritin was associated with insulin sensitivity among those\nin the upper half of the ferritin distribution.8 Well estab-\nlished are associations of body circumference measures and\nskinfold measures of body fat distribution and fatness with\ninsulin sensitivity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, and\nother cardiovascular risk factors of the insulin resistance\nsyndrome.4,9,10 In order to test the hypothesis that circum-\nference and skinfold indices of body fat distribution are\nsigni\u00aecantly associated with body iron stores as indicated\nby serum ferritin concentration independent of overall fat-\nness, gender, ethnicity, age or maturity level, data from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination  \n(NHANES III) were examined. Mexican Americans were\nselected for study because of the reported higher prevalence\nof obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance compared to non-\nHispanic white or black people.11 Serum ferritin levels were\n*Correspondence: RF Gillum, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nsimilar in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white people in\nNHANES II.12 The study was restricted to men to eliminate\nconfounding by gender, pregnancy, menopause, parity, oral\ncontraceptives or female hormone replacement therapy and\nreduce possible confounding by iron de\u00aeciency and iron\ntherapy. The study was restricted to persons older than 19\nand younger than 50 y to reduce possible confounding by\ngrowth and development, and chronic metabolic and\nin\u00afammatory diseases, such as Type II diabetes and arthritis,\ncommon in the elderly.\nMethods\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nnationwide multi-stage probability sample of approximately\n40000 persons from the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation aged 2 months and over of the United States excluding\nreservation lands of American Indians. Of these, 31311 were\nexamined. The descriptive analyses of serum ferritin concen-\ntration and WHR in this report are restricted to 1416 Mex-\nican American men aged 20 \u00b1 49 y examined with valid\nserum ferritin, height, weight, waist and hip circumference\nmeasurements in the survey. Numbers of persons in various\ncorrelation and regression analyses that follow may vary\nslightly due to differing numbers with missing values on\nselected other variables. Details of the plan, sampling,\noperation and response have been published as have\nprocedures used to obtain informed consent and to maintain\ncon\u00aedentiality of information obtained.13,14\nDemographic, medical history, and behavioral informa-\ntion was collected prior to the examination by household\ninterview. Medical records of participants were not available.\nRace and Mexican American ethnicity were determined by\nself-report.13 Examinations were carried out in a mobile\nexamination center.\nBlood samples were obtained at the examination center.\nBlood in a red-top Vacutainer tube was allowed to stand for\n45 min at room temperature to allow complete clotting and\nclot retraction. Samples were centrifuged at 1500 \u00c2 g for 30\nmin at 4C. Samples were frozen at 720C. Ferritin in serum\nwas measured by the Division of Environmental Health\nLaboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental\nHealth, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using\nthe Bio-Rad Laboratories' Quantimmune Ferritin IRMA kit\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).15 This is a single-incu-\nbation, two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) based on\nthe general principles of assays as described elsewhere.15 \u00b1 18\nThe reference range for the overall population was consid-\nconsidered to have elevated levels.19 C-reactive protein con-\ncentration, a marker of in\u00afammation, was measured at the\nImmunology Division of the University of Washington (Seat-\ntle, Washington) with latex-enhanced nephelometry.15\nTechnicians measured height to the nearest 0.1 cm,\nweight to the nearest 0.01 kg, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac\nand mid-thigh skinfold thickness to the nearest 0.1 mm and\nwaist and buttocks circumference to the nearest 0.1 cm as\ndescribed in detail elsewhere.13,20,21 With the sample person\nstanding at minimal respiration, waist circumference was\nmeasured in a horizontal plane at the level of the high\npoint of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm. This method\nwas chosen to maximize reproducibility.13,20 Hip circumfer-\nence was measured in a horizontal plane at the maximum\nextension of the buttocks. Thigh circumference was mea-\nsured at mid-thigh in a plane perpendicular to the long axis\nof the thigh. The following were computed: waist-to-hip\ncircumference ratio (WHR), waist-to-thigh circumference\nratio (WTR), ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness\n(SFR), central-peripheral skinfold ratio (CPR  (subscapular\nskinfold  suprailiac skinfold)a(triceps skinfold  thigh skin-\nfold); sum of the four skinfolds (SSF); and body mass index\n(BMI  weightaheight2, kgam2). Extensive descriptive data\non height, weight, BMI and obesity prevalence as well as\nserum ferritin in the NHANES III population are being\npublished elsewhere and will not be duplicated here.19,21\nStatistical analysis.\nThe plan of the present analyses was as follows. Detailed\ndescriptive statistics and measures of association were com-\nputed initially using unweighted data using the Statistical\nAnalysis System (SAS).22 Pearson partial correlation was used\nto assess the association of the natural logarithm (LN) of\nserum ferritin concentration with other variables controlling\nfor age or age and BMI.22 Correlation analysis results are\npresented because of their familiarity, ease of interpretation\nby a wide audience, and use in previous reports that may be\ncompared to the present one. Linear multivariate regression\nanalysis was used to develop models for predicting serum\nferritin.22 Only variables with prespeci\u00aeed hypotheses were\nentered into the regression models. Following these preli-\nminary analyses, \u00aendings of the unweighted analyses were\ncon\u00aermed using techniques that incorporated sampling\nweights and design features of the survey.23 Population\nestimates for means and percentiles of WHR were produced\nusing weighted SAS or SUDAAN procedures.24 Pearson corre-\nlations of LN serum ferritin with other variables were con-\n\u00aermed by SAS weighted analysis and statistical testing and\nvariance estimation were performed using the PROC\nREGRESS procedure for linear regression models in the\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of serum ferritin concentra-\ntion by age. Mean levels are shown in Table 1. The distribu-\ntion shifted towards higher levels between the third and\nfourth decades of life with little further change in the \u00aefth\ndecade. LN serum ferritin was correlated with age overall and\nat age 25 \u00b1 29 y, but not within the fourth and \u00aefth decades\n(Table 2). Figure 2 shows the distribution of WHR by age.\nSerum ferritin and body fat distribution\nRF Gillum\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nMean levels are shown in Table 1. The distribution shifted\nprogressively towards higher levels between the third and\n\u00aefth decades of life.\nDescriptive analyses of WTR, SFR, waist girth and BMI\nrevealed variation with age similar to that described for WHR\n(not shown). CPR and SSF increased between the third and\nfourth decades, but changed little between the fourth and\n\u00aefth decades (not shown). The distribution of WTR became\nincreasingly skewed towards higher values with increasing\nage. Table 1 shows means by age for all these variables.\nTable 2 shows weighted correlation coef\u00aecients within\nstrata of age of LN serum ferritin concentration with the\nfour indices of body fat distribution (WHR, WTR, SFR and\nCPR). In Mexican American men, the largest positive coef\u00ae-\nratios were much smaller than those for circumference\nratios. Partial correlation coef\u00aecients controlling for age\nwithin strata gave virtually identical results (not shown).\nTable 2 shows correlation coef\u00aecients by age of log serum\nferritin concentration with measures of overall fatness or size\n(waist circumference, hip circumference, SSF, BMI). In\nMexican American men, the positive coef\u00aecients of waist\ncircumference, BMI and SSF were similar to those for WHR\nbelow age 40, and larger than those for WHR above age 40.\nFigure 1 Cumulative distribution of serum ferritin in Mexican American men aged 20 \u00b1 49 y in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nTable 1 Mean (s.e. mean) serum ferritin concentrations and indices of\nbody fat distribution and obesity by age in Mexican American men aged\n20 \u00b1 49 y: Third National Health and Nutrition Examination  ,\nAge, y\nWHR, waist-to-hip ratio; WTR, waist-to-thigh ratio; SFR, subscapular to triceps\nskinfold ratio; CPR, (subscapular  suprailiac)a(triceps  thigh); Waist, waist\ncircumference; Hip, hip circumference; SSF, sum of four skinfolds; BMI, body\nmass index, kgam2.\nTable 2 Correlations* of log serum ferritin concentration with indices of\nbody fat distribution and obesity in Mexican American men aged 20 \u00b1\n49 y: Third National Health and Nutrition Examination  , 1988 \u00b1\nAge, y\nWHR, waist-to-hip ratio; WTR, waist-to-thigh ratio; SFR, subscapular to triceps\nskinfold ratio; CPR, (subscapular  suprailiac)a(triceps  thigh); Waist, waist\ncircumference; Hip, hip circumference; SSF, sum of four skinfolds; BMI, body\nmass index, kgam2.\n*Pearson correlation coef\u00aecients; coef\u00aecients ` 0.10 not shown.\nSerum ferritin and body fat distribution\nRF Gillum\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nPartial correlation coef\u00aecients controlling for age within\nstrata gave virtually identical results (not shown).\nTable 3 shows partial correlation coef\u00aecients controlling\nfor BMI within strata of age for LN serum ferritin concentra-\ntion with the four indices of body fat distribution (WHR,\nWTR, SFR and CPR). Compared to unadjusted coef\u00aecients,\nthe BMI-adjusted coef\u00aecients for WHR and WTR were\nreduced in magnitude by about half below age 40 and to\nnearly zero at age 40 \u00b1 49. Effects of adjustment for BMI were\ninconsistent for SFR and CPR.\nLinear regression models were \u00aet with LN ferritin as the\ndependent variable and WHR as the exposure variable con-\ntrolling for age, BMI, age \u00c2 BMI, WHR \u00c2 age, and WHR \u00c2 BMI\nto determine whether WHR was signi\u00aecantly associated with\nferritin independent of overall fatness and age. In the full\nmodel with all the above terms, each term including WHR\nwas found to be statistically signi\u00aecant, indicating an inde-\npendent effect of WHR (P  0.001) on serum ferritin and\nsigni\u00aecant effect modi\u00aecation by age and BMI. Table 4 shows\nthe change in the mean value of LN serum ferritin for a one-\nunit change in WHR at various levels of effect modi\u00aeers age\nand BMI. The positive change in LN serum ferritin was\nnegligible at age 45 at both higher and lower BMI for age\n40 \u00b1 49. Thus, the effect of WHR on serum ferritin declined\nwith increasing age and BMI.\nDiscussion\nWHR, WTR, SFR and CPR showed consistent positive asso-\nciations with serum ferritin levels across age subgroups in a\nnational sample of Mexican American men aged 20 \u00b1 49 y.\nWhen age and BMI were controlled for, WHR remained\nsigni\u00aecantly associated with serum ferritin; the association\nweakened with increasing age and BMI.\nFigure 2 Cumulative distribution of waist-to-hip ratio in Mexican American men aged 20 \u00b1 49 y in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nTable 3 Partial correlations* of log serum ferritin concentration with\nindices of body fat distribution and obesity controlling for BMI in\nMexican American men aged 20 \u00b1 49 y: Third National Health and\nAge, y\nWHR, waist-to-hip ratio; WTR, waist-to-thigh ratio; SFR, subscapular to triceps\nskinfold ratio; CPR, (subscapular  suprailiac)a(triceps  thigh); Waist, waist\ncircumference; Hip, hip circumference; SSF, sum of four skinfolds; BMI, body\nmass index, kgam2.\n*Pearson partial correlation coef\u00aecients controlling for BMI; coef\u00aecients ` 0.10\nnot shown.\nTable 4 Change in the mean value of LN serum ferritin for a one-unit\nchange in waist-to-hip ratio at various levels of effect modi\u00aeers age and\nbody mass index\nAge, y\nBMI, body mass index, values are age-speci\u00aec 25th and 75th percentiles.\nModel: dependent variable LN serum ferritin; independent variables waist-to-\nhip ratio (WHR), body mass index, age, BMI \u00c2 age, WHR \u00c2 age, WHR \u00c2 BMI.\nSerum ferritin and body fat distribution\nRF Gillum\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nMechanisms\nFerritin is a major iron storage protein found in all cell types\nwith isoferritin moieties identi\u00aeed in liver and spleen (L\nisoferritin), and for heart and kidneys (H isoferritin).25,26\nIron-free apoferritin is a spherical protein (MW 480 kDa) with\n24 subunits surrounding a central cavity, which can store over\n4000 moleculesofironasferrihydrite.26 Inmaturecells,ferritin\nexpression is regulated at translation via mRNA. Serum ferritin\nis iron-poor (mostly apoferritin). Serum ferritin may be synthe-\nsized and released from the liver andaor reticuloendothelial\nsystem.26 It most resembles L isoferritin with a plasma half-life\nof up to 30 h. A signi\u00aecant proportion is glycosylated. Most\niron in plasma is bound to transferrin, with only very small\namounts in ferritin, which has very high af\u00aenity for iron.\nBecause iron directly induces synthesis of apoferritin, a repre-\nsentative fraction of ferritin being released into blood plasma\nunder most metabolic circumstances, serum or plasma ferritin\nconcentration correlates well with body iron stores.25\nIncreased iron stores in the liver are postulated to induce\nliver-mediated insulin resistance, with reduced hepatic insulin\nextractionandhyperinsulinemiaandreducedability ofinsulin\nto suppress hepatic glucose production.8 Increased iron stores\nin muscle could enhance oxidation of free fatty acids which\nmight interfere with glucose disposal.27 Serum ferritin levels\nhave been found to be associated with decreased insulin\nsensitivity and increased fasting serum insulin and blood\nglucose.8,27 These abnormalities might lead to increased adip-\nosity. In several studies, serum ferritin was correlated with\nother components of the insulin resistance syndrome.8,28\nWHR and waist circumference re\u00afect intraabdominal fat\nmass in adult men;29 \u00b1 31 SFR and CPR re\u00afect distribution of\nsubcutaneous fat. Both are related to cardiovascular disease\noccurrence in adults.4 \u00b1 6,32 \u00b1 34 In a study using computed\ntomography, subcutaneous abdominal fat was at least as\nstrong a correlate of insulin sensitivity as visceral fat, and\nremained signi\u00aecant after controlling for visceral fat.35\nFurther, an android pattern of skinfold thicknesses was\nassociated with greater absolute and proportional amounts\nof visceral adipose tissue than a gynoid pattern.31 Therefore\nit is puzzling why skinfold ratios showed minimal corre-\nlation with serum ferritin in contrast to WHR. Use of\ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for accurate body fat mea-\nsurement and assessment of regional fat distribution\nmight resolve some of these problems in future studies.36\nDespite preliminary conjectures and reports, a large body of\nresearch has accumulated that fails to demonstrate a rela-\ntionship of serum ferritin or various other measures of body\niron stores with the incidence of coronary heart disease or\nComparisons with previous reports\nOnly a few studies have assessed associations of obesity and\ncentral or abdominal fat distribution with serum ferritin\nconcentration, yielding inconsistent results.7,8 Consistent\nwith the present \u00aendings, among over 300 male Norwegian\noil workers, WTR and BMI were signi\u00aecantly associated with\nferritin in models including multiple cardiovascular risk\nfactors.7 The effect of WTR was linear and independent of\nBMI (also linear). In 36 volunteers in a metabolic study, the\nlog of serum ferritin was not signi\u00aecantly correlated with\nWHR; BMI (but not WHR) was correlated with ferritin only\namong those in the top half of the ferritin distribution of the\nsample.8 No studies of skinfold ratios were found.\nLimitations of the present study include possible bias\narising from survey nonresponse and from missing values\nfor some variables. Several special studies of earlier HANES\nand NHANES III data have indicated little bias due to non-\nstrated for serum ferritin.15 Day-to-day variability in serum\nferritin would tend to bias reported associations towards the\nnull.39 Ferritin shows no appreciable circadian rhythm.25\nBlood collection conditions in NHANES III were standar-\ndized with regard to body position and vein constriction.\nMales donating blood four or more times a year may have\ndepleted iron stores and reduced serum ferritin; however,\nblood donors were not excluded since serum ferritin still\naccurately re\u00afects body iron stores.25 Since serum ferritin is a\npositive acute-phase protein and does not accurately re\u00afect\nbody iron stores in the presence of in\u00afammation,25,40 the\nregression analyses were repeated excluding 49 men with\nC-reactive protein concentrations ! 1 mgadl or excluding\n288 with any detectable C-reactive protein in serum\n( b 0.21 mgadl); \u00aendings were essentially unchanged. The\nlack of a single, generally accepted measurement protocol\nfor body circumferences remains a problem for interstudy\ncomparisons, perhaps explaining in part inconsistencies\namong studies. Confounding by variables not controlled\nfor cannot be excluded. Controlling for smoking status in\naddition to the variables presented above did not change\nresults. Alcohol intake is positively associated with both\nserum ferritin concentration and WHR.41,42 Controlling for\nalcohol intake would be expected to diminish the correla-\ntions of the latter variables. However, it is unclear whether\ndoing so would be controlling for a confounder or inappro-\npriately controlling for a variable in a causal chain linking\nferritin and WHR.\nThe large sample size in NHANES III provided good\nstatistical power. Since the number of tests was restricted to\nthose of regression models and P-values for WHR were\n` 0.01, chance is an unlikely explanation of the \u00aendings.\nThe representativeness of the sample and the use of sample\nweights provides wide generalizability of the results to\nUnited States Mexican American men of the same ages.\nConclusions\nFuture research should include longitudinal studies of body\nfat distribution and serum ferritin in non-Hispanic white\nand black and Hispanic men and women to determine\ntemporal sequence of the relationship. Dual-energy X-ray\nabsorptiometry or other techniques for accurate body fat\nmeasurement and assessment of regional fat distribution\nSerum ferritin and body fat distribution\nRF Gillum\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nshould be used to determine whether adipose tissue in\nvarious depots varies in its association with serum ferritin.\nBody fat distribution and serum ferritin should be assessed\njointly as risk factors for development of noninvasively\nmeasured atherosclerosis (eg carotid intima-medial thickness)\nand non-insulin dependent diabetes.\n"
