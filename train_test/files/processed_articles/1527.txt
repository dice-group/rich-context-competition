By taking advantage of several\nrecent advances in the in-home collection of biomeasures\n(Lindau & McDade, 2007), NSHAP was able to obtain\nbiomeasures of visual, tactile (touch), gustatory (taste), and\nolfactory (smell) function (auditory function was assessed\nvia self-report only). The purposes of this article were to\ndescribe the methods by which these measurements were\nobtained, to report on the quality of the resulting data, and to\nillustrate how these data may be used analytically.\nSensory function is an important aspect of health, espe-\ncially as people age. Declines in sensory function may be\nsymptomatic of underlying disease and can affect personal\nsafety (Anstey, Wood, Lord, & Walker, 2005), quality of\nlife, and perceived health (Ostbye et al., 2006). In addition,\na decline in sensory function may limit participation in in-\ntimate relationships and other types of social activities,\nwhich may in turn have additional negative consequences\nfor health. Exploring this type of dynamic process in which\nhealth and social interaction are intertwined was one of\nNSHAP's primary objectives (Lindau, Laumann, Levinson, &\nSeveral population and clinical studies have documented\nage-related decline in sensory function. For example, stud-\nies in the United States (Murphy et al., 2002), Germany\n(Hummel, Kobal, Gudziol, & Mackay-Sim, 2007; Landis,\nKonnerth, & Hummel, 2004), and Sweden (Bramerson,\nJohansson, Ek, Nordin, & Bende, 2004) have found the\nlikelihood of olfactory dysfunction to increase substantially\nafter age 55, affecting a larger proportion of the population\nthan previously thought (Landis & Hummel, 2006). Data\nfor gustation are limited to much smaller clinical studies but\nalso suggest a decline in gustatory function with age inde-\npendent of the decline in olfaction (Fukunaga, Uematsu, &\non vision and hearing are available from the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey and indicate that the\npresence of both visual and hearing impairments increases\nsubstantially with age (Li, Healy, Wanzer Drane, & Zhang,\nstudies have found a decrease in hand sensibility with age\n(Desrosiers, Hebert, Bravo, & Dutil, 1996; Ranganathan,\nSiemionow, Sahgal, & Yue, 2001; Wickremaratchi &\nLlewelyn, 2006). Our objective was to confirm these results\nwith the NSHAP data while investigating the psychometric\nproperties of each measurement module.\nAssessment of Sensory Function in the National Social\nLife, Health, and Aging Project\nL.

The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project assessed functioning of all 5 senses using both self-\nreport and objective measures. We evaluate the performance of the objective measures and model differences in sensory\nfunction by gender and age. In the process, we demonstrate how to use and interpret these measures.\nMethods. Distance vision was assessed using a standard Sloan eye chart, and touch was measured using a stationary\n2-point discrimination test applied to the index fingertip of the dominant hand. Olfactory function (both intensity detec-\ntion and odor identification) was assessed using odorants administered via felt-tip pens. Gustatory function was measured\nvia identification of four taste strips.\nResults. The performance of the objective measures was similar to that reported for previous studies, as was the rela-\ntionship between sensory function and both gender and age.\nDiscussion. Sensory function is important in studies of aging and health both because it is an important health out-\ncome and also because a decline in functioning can be symptomatic of or predict other health conditions. Although the\nobjective measures provide considerably more precision than the self-report items, the latter can be valuable for imputa-\ntion of missing data and for understanding differences in how older adults perceive their own sensory ability.\nAnalytic Approach\nMultiple Measurements\nThe protocols for measuring olfactory, gustatory, and\ntactile functioning each involved administering several dif-\nferent stimuli in blinded fashion and asking respondents to\nidentify each one from a list of possible alternatives. It is\nassumed that the ability to identify the stimulus correctly\nreflects the respondent's underlying level of function in that\nparticular sensory domain. A standard way to analyze such\ndata is with an item-response model. Assuming yij\nis the re-\nsponse for respondent i to the jth item, the simplest such\nmodel is\ng E y\nij ij\nij i j\n( ( ))\n,\n=\n= +\n\n  \nwhere E(yij\n) is the mean of yij\nconditional on hij\n, g() is known\nas the link function, and ai\nand qj\nare sets of respondent-\nspecific and item-specific parameters, respectively. When yij\ntakes the values 0 or 1, a common choice for g() is the logit\nlogit(Pr )\n( ) .\ny\nij i j\n= = +\nModel 1 is the well-known Rasch model (Rasch, 1960) de-\nveloped for evaluating and scoring educational tests com-\nposed of binary items and may be fit to NSHAP's sensory\ndata by coding each identification item as either correct (1)\nor incorrect (0). The parameter qj\nmay then be thought of as\nthe underlying difficulty of the jth identification task and the\nparameter ai\nas the underlying ability of the ith respondent\nto perform such tasks.\nModel 1 has two important limitations (Skrondal & Rabe-\nences in ability affect performance on all items equally. This\nmay be true of a well-constructed test battery or psycho-\nlogical scale but may not be true of NSHAP's sensory func-\ntion modules because they were not designed with this\ncriterion in mind. To accommodate this, we may extend\nEquation 1 in the following way:\nlogit(Pr )\n( ) ,\ny\nij j i j\n= = +\nwhere the lj\nare analogous to factor loadings in a factor\nanalytic model (note that only j - 1 of the lj\nare identifi-\nable). This is referred to as a two-parameter item-response\nmodel (Birnbaum, 1968) because each item is now repre-\nsented by two parameters (qj\nand lj\n).\nA second limitation evident from Equation 1 is that for\nany given item, the probability of a \"correct\" response ap-\nproaches 0 as the respondent's sensory ability decreases.\nThis is clearly not realistic in cases where the response in-\nvolves choosing from a fixed set of possibilities, as in the\ncase of NSHAP's sensory identification items (despite this,\nEquation 1 and Equation 2 are still often used to analyze\ndata from multiple choice items). A more realistic model is\nPr( ) ( ) ( ),\ny c c g\nij j i j\n= = + +\nwhere in the case of the logit link g-1(x) = ex/(1 + ex). In this\nmodel, as ability approaches -, the probability of a correct\nresponse approaches c, which can therefore be interpreted\nas the probability of a pure guess (i.e., by someone with no\nability) being correct. Although c is represented here as be-\ning constant across items, this can be relaxed (Birnbaum,\nIn cases where sensory function is hypothesized to de-\npend on certain observed covariates, this can be accom-\nplished within the context of these models by specifying a\nstructural model for ai\n:\n \ni\n= x\ni\nE\nE,\nwhere xi\nis a vector of covariates for respondent i (note that\nif xi\nincludes a constant one of the qj\nmust be set to 0 for\nidentification). The resulting model is referred to as the\nMultiple Indicator Multiple Causes model (Joreskog &\nIn addition to models in which sensory function is\ntreated as an outcome, one may also wish to treat it as an\nexplanatory variable in analyses of other outcomes--as,\nfor example, in exploring the hypothesis noted above that\npoor sensory function may limit one's ability to engage in\nsatisfying intimate relationships (in reality, this relation-\nship may be bidirectional). Such analyses may be con-\nducted in two ways. First, one may estimate a full structural\nequation model (Bollen, 1989) combining one of the mea-\nsurement models above with another model in which ai\nis\nalso used as a predictor. A second, simpler approach is to\nuse the fitted measurement model to compute empirical\nBayes predictions of the ai\nand then simply use these esti-\nmates ^\na\ni\nas covariates in another model. It is important to\nnote that although the ^\na\ni\ndiffer from the true ai\n, this ap-\nproach can still yield consistent (though less efficient) es-\ntimates for the model of interest, though the standard errors\nwill be biased downward because the ^\na\ni\nare being treated\nas nonrandom (Whittemore, 1989). A possible way to ad-\ndress this would be to bootstrap the entire process (i.e.,\nboth the estimation of ^\na\ni\nand the model of interest; Efron\nAll the models described above are examples of General-\nized Linear Latent and Mixed Models (GLLAMMs; Skrondal\n& Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) and may be fit in Stata (StataCorp,\n2007) using the gllamm package (Zheng & Rabe-Hesketh,\n2007). For convenience, we assume that the ai\nare distrib-\nuted Gaussian with mean given by the corresponding struc-\ntural model (if specified).\nObjective Versus Subjective Measurement\nIn addition to biomeasures of sensory function, NSHAP\nalso obtained self-reported measures of function for each of\nthe five senses. Because self-reported measures of function\ncanhavepoorreliability(e.g.,Landis,Hummel,Hugentobler,\nGiger, & Lacroix, 2003) and/or be affected by reporting\nbias, such measures are typically of interest only in cases\nwhere biomeasures are unavailable. For example, because\nNSHAP's visual acuity testing was performed on only half\nof the respondents, while the self-reported measure was ob-\ntained from all, one could use the half sample with both\nmeasures to develop and estimate a model for the self-report\nprocess and then use this model to impute visual acuity for\nthose who were not tested. Similarly, one might use self-\nreports of olfactory, gustatory, and tactile function to impute\nmissing values for the corresponding biomeasures due to\nnonresponse (note, however, that in these three cases, the\ncorresponding self-reported measures were obtained from\nonly half of the respondents).\nIn addition to obtaining objective measurements of sen-\nsory function as part of a holistic assessment of health, the\nNSHAP research team was also interested in the effects that\na decline in sensory function may have on an older adult's\nparticipation in intimate and other types of social activity.\nBecause such effects may be due in part to self-limitation,\nthe way in which respondents perceive their sensory\nfunction--as distinct from their actual level of function--\nbecomes important. This leads to consideration of the\ndistribution of self-reported function conditional on ai\n, and\nthe way in which this distribution depends on various cova-\nriates. Such an analysis can be performed using the methods\ndescribed earlier. Because vision was assessed using only a\nsingle measure of visual acuity, one can model self-reported\nvision using visual acuity directly as a covariate (e.g., see\nAt the conclusion of each interview, NSHAP interview-\ners were asked to rate the respondent's vision and hearing\nusing a 5-point scale. The resulting data (not presented here)\nmay be used in models for imputing missing values of vi-\nsual acuity and/or self-reported vision and hearing.\nOlfaction\nOlfactory function was assessed in all respondents using\ntests of both odor sensitivity (i.e., the lowest concentration\nat which an odor can be detected) and odor identification.\nOdorants were administered using commercially available\nfelt-tip pens, each filled with an individual odorant at a spe-\ncific concentration. This device is inexpensive, convenient,\nand ideally suited to delivering odorants at a constant con-\ncentration (Hummel, Sekinger, Wolf, Pauli, & Kobal, 1997).\nAfter we developed the NSHAP protocol, another short\nscreening method using the pens was independently devel-\nThe test of odor sensitivity involved presenting a series of\nfive pens, the first containing only the diluent propylene gly-\ncol (1,2-propanediol) followed by steadily increasing con-\nand 8.00%). Each pen was held by the interviewer (who wore\na cotton glove to eliminate residual odors) approximately\nhalf an inch from the respondent's nostrils; respondents were\nthen asked to inhale through the nose, during which time the\npen was waved slowly back and forth for no more than 3\u00ad4 s.\nFollowing each pen, respondents used a visual analog scale\nranging from 0 (labeled no smell at all) to 10 (labeled smells\nvery strong) to record their perception of odor strength.\nAlthough there is not sufficient space to present the sen-\nsitivity data here, we note that there was some variation\namong respondents in the way in which the visual analog\nscale was completed. Respondents were given a choice be-\ntween recording their responses directly on the interview-\ner's laptop computer (using the mouse to position a slider)\nor on a paper version of the scale. Nearly two thirds of those\nwho completed the olfactory module chose the paper ver-\nsion (61%), and the likelihood of choosing paper was higher\nfor women and increased with age. Despite instructions to\nmark an X on the line representing the scale, 17%\u00ad18% of\nthose who recorded their answers on paper wrote an integer\nFollowing the sensitivity test, respondents were presented\nwith a five-item identification test. A single odor was pre-\nsented, and respondents were asked to identify it from a set\nof alternatives (responses were recorded by the interviewer\non the computer). This was repeated using five individual\nodors. The response sets were as follows (in order of admin-\nistration and with the true odorant indicated in italics): (a)\nchamomile, raspberry, rose, or cherry; (b) smoke, glue,\nleather, or grass; (c) orange, blueberry, strawberry, or onion;\n(d) bread, fish, cheese, or ham; and (e) chive, peppermint,\npine, or onion. Following a forced-choice paradigm, re-\nspondents were not permitted to answer \"don't know\";\nhowever, for each test, 1%\u00ad3% of respondents refused to\nanswer. Although these refusals are excluded from the anal-\nyses presented here, they may in many cases reflect uncer-\ntainty about the correct response, and therefore, other\nanalysts may wish to handle them differently.\nResults for the identification tests are presented in\nTable 1. For this analysis, we have focused solely on\nwhether the respondent was able to identify the odorant\ncorrectly; a more in-depth analysis might examine the dis-\ntribution of responses among the various incorrect alterna-\ntives. Each of the five odorants was identified correctly by\na majority of respondents, with peppermint identified cor-\nrectly most often (92%) and leather identified correctly\nleast often (71%). Item nonresponse (including item-spe-\ncific refusal to give a response plus 61 respondents [2%]\nwho declined the entire olfactory module, 1 respondent\nwho broke off the interview at an earlier point, and one\ninstance of an equipment problem) was highest for the first\nitem (5%) and declined steadily thereafter. The increasing\nlikelihood of a correct response coupled with decreasing\nitem nonresponse is consistent with the possibility that\nsome respondents became more adept at the task after the\nfirst couple of tries. However, because the order of the\nitems was identical for all respondents, it is not possible\nto distinguish between such order effects and true item-\nspecific differences in difficulty.\nEstimates for Model 1 and two versions of Model 2 (see\nMultiple Measurements) are also presented in Table 1, ob-\ntained using all respondents for whom data from at least one\nitem were available. Model 1 reflects the same ordering in\nitem difficulty observed in the percent correct and estimates\nthe variance of the ai\nto be 1.27 on the logit scale, indicating\nthat a 1 SD increase in individual ability roughly triples the\nodds of correctly identifying a given odor. Model 2A per-\nmits the effect of a change in individual ability to vary\nacross items; a likelihood ratio test of this model against\nModel 1 yields a p value of <.001, indicating that the items\ndo differ in their ability to discriminate among individuals.\nEstimates of the discrimination parameters ^\n\nj\nindicate that\npeppermint provided the best discrimination, whereas rose\nand leather provided the worst.\nModel 2B extends 2A by incorporating a structural\nmodel for the ai\ncontaining the covariates gender and age\ngroup. The estimated odds ratio for women (vs. men) is\nwith a 67% decrease in the odds of identifying an odor\ncorrectly from the youngest (57\u00ad64 years) to the oldest\nfidence interval of 0.26\u00ad0.43). These results are consistent\nwith previous studies of gender and age differences in ol-\nfactory function assessed by odor identification (Hummel\nGustation\nAssessment of gustatory function was performed on all\nrespondents using a series of taste-impregnated strips of fil-\nter paper (Mueller et al., 2003). Four strips were presented\nin the same order to each respondent: The first tasted sour,\nthe second bitter, the third sweet, and the fourth salty. Be-\nfore tasting each strip, respondents were asked to take a sip\nof water; they were then instructed to put the strip on their\ntongue and to describe the taste using one of the following\ndescriptors: \"salty,\" \"sweet,\" \"bitter,\" or \"sour.\" In addition,\nthey were asked to rate how certain they were that they had\nidentified the taste correctly using a visual analog scale\nranging from 0 (labeled very uncertain) to 10 (labeled very\ncertain). To facilitate use of the scale, respondents were\nasked to record their answers directly on the laptop; those\nwho were uncomfortable doing so were provided with a pa-\nper version of the items. As with the olfactory module, the\nmajority of respondents who participated in the assessment\n(58%) chose the paper version.\nNonresponse was higher for this module than for the ol-\nfactory module. One hundred and thirty-seven respondents\n(5%) declined to participate, and equipment problems pre-\nvented administering the module in an additional 58 cases\n(2%). Although respondents who recorded their answers on\nthe laptop were not given the option \"don't know,\" they\nwere permitted to indicate that they had tried and were un-\nable to perform the task, at which point no further strips\nwere administered. Fifty-nine respondents (2%) reported\nbeing unable to rate one of the four strips. In addition, be-\ntween 5 and 21 respondents who recorded their answers on\nTable 1.

Although re-\nspondents who were truly unable to identify a particular\ntaste are likely represented in each of these categories, only\nthose recorded as \"tried, unable to do\" or who wrote in\n\"don't know\" are counted as legitimate (incorrect) responses\nin the analysis presented here; all others are excluded.\nResults for the identification items are presented in Table 2.\nThe least-recognized taste was sour (39% correct), whereas\nthe most recognized taste was sweet (86% correct). Because\nthe four tastes were presented in the same order to all\nrespondents, it is not possible to distinguish between item-\nspecific differences and a possible learning effect, though\nthe fact that only 67% identified the final taste (salty)\ncorrectly suggests that a learning effect cannot account for\nall the differences observed. Item nonresponse was highest\nfor the bitter strip, reflecting a larger number of blank,\n\"don't know,\" and refused responses.\nEstimates for Model 1 mirror the item ordering observed\nin the percent correct, whereas those for Model 2A suggest\nthat the sour and salty tastes load more heavily on the single\ndimension of ability being picked up here (a likelihood ratio\ntest comparing Model 2A with the more restrictive Model 1\nyields a p value of .004). Under 2A, the variance of the ai\nis\nestimated to be 0.95, indicating that a 1 SD increase in ability\nincreases the odds of correctly identifying a taste with a\nloading of one by a factor of 2.65. Model 2B adds a struc-\ntural model for the ai\nincluding gender and age group as\ncovariates. The ability of women to identify tastes correctly\nis estimated to be 0.60 logits higher than that of men, whereas\nage is associated with a more modest decline of only 0.22\nlogits by the oldest age group relative to the youngest.\nFor comparison, Table 3 shows the results from logistic\nregression models fit separately to each of the taste identifi-\ncation items including both gender and age group as covari-\nates. The estimated gender effects are similar in magnitude\nto the estimate from the structural model; however, age-\nrelated declines are observed for only the tastes bitter and\nsalty. This indicates that the unidimensional model is inad-\nequate for the purpose of describing the effects of age on the\nability to identify these four tastes.\nVision\nDistant visual acuity was assessed in both eyes together\nat 3 m using a chart with Sloan optotypes manufactured by\nPrecision Vision (catalog number 2104). Respondents who\nnormally wear glasses or contact lenses for driving or dis-\ntance vision were instructed to wear them during the test.\nInterviewers followed a detailed protocol to ensure consis-\ntent distance from the chart (using a premeasured string laid\nout on the floor), line of sight (respondent seated with inter-\nviewer holding chart at respondent's eye level), and lighting\n(sufficient light for reading with low glare or strong back-\nlighting). Respondents were asked to begin by reading the\nsmallest discernible line and, depending on the outcome,\nwere then successively directed up or down one line at a\ntime until the smallest line that could be read accurately was\ndetermined.\nTable 2.

Results for the remaining 1,437 respon-\ndents are shown in Table 3.

First, one might attempt to model the mean directly,\nsome appropriate transformation thereof (e.g., the logarithm\nof the minimum angle of resolution, which linearizes the\ngeometric sequence of the chart). A second approach is to\nmodel the cumulative probabilities of being at or above a\ngiven ability using ordinal regression (McCullagh & Nelder,\n1989). The advantage of the latter is that it does not require\nadvanced knowledge of the biometrics of visual acuity, and\nmore importantly, it yields conclusions that are immediately\ninterpretable in clinically relevant terms (e.g., the effect of a\ncovariate on the log odds of having vision equal to or better\nthan a given threshold).\nTable 3 shows estimates from a logistic model with the\ncovariates gender (female vs. male) and age group (65\u00ad74\nTable 3.

The estimates for each covariate are\nroughly similar across the different cutpoints; likelihood\nratio tests of equality across the cutpoints yield p values of\n75\u00ad85 years, respectively. Estimates for the proportional\nodds model (in which the effects of the covariates are as-\nsumed equal across the cutpoints) are also provided and\nindicate that the odds of being at or above a given level of\nfor women than for men. The effect of age appears roughly\nodds of being above a given cutpoint than those aged 57\u00ad64\nyears. A likelihood ratio test of the interaction between gen-\nder and age (2 df) yields a p value of .847. Of course, al-\nthough the proportional odds model does a good job of\nsummarizing the effects of gender and age on visual acuity,\nthere is no guarantee that this model will be appropriate for\nother covariates.\nNote that because respondents were randomly selected\nfor visual acuity assessment, analyses like those just de-\nscribed using only those individuals who were assessed will\nyield unbiased results. However, in situations where work-\ning with half of the sample is not adequate, one could use\nself-rated vision (asked of all respondents) together with\nother covariates to impute values of visual acuity for those\nwho were not administered this module (Rubin, 1987).\nHearing\nHearing was the one sense that NSHAP did not measure\nobjectively. This was not due to a lack of interest; rather, por-\ntable audiometers--the standard method for assessment in\nthe field--were too costly, and technical problems precluded\nthe possible integration of an audiometric application directly\ninto the computer-assisted personal interview instrument\nprior to going into the field. Thus, the primary measure of\nhearing was the question \"Is your hearing excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor?\" This question was asked of all\nrespondents; respondents who use a hearing aid were asked\nto describe their hearing while using it. Respondents were\nalso asked the question \"Do you feel you have a hearing\nloss?\" to which 44% answered yes; this single question has\nbeen shown to have reasonable sensitivity and specificity for\nhearing impairment (Sindhusake et al., 2001). Finally, as\nnoted above, the interviewer's rating of the respondent's\nhearing is also available. Because the interviewer had en-\ngaged in a 90-min or longer face-to-face conversation with\nthe respondent, one might expect his or her rating to be fairly\nsensitive to deficits severe enough to affect conversation.\nResults from the self-report question are shown in Table\n3. Only 18% of respondents rated their hearing as excellent,\nwhereas roughly one third each rated their hearing as either\nvery good or good. Twenty percent rated their hearing as\neither fair or poor. Estimates for the unconstrained ordered\nlogit model are similar to those for the proportional odds\nmodel, with likelihood ratio tests comparing the two yield-\nThus, we estimate that the likelihood of being above a given\nfor men and decreases with age at an increasing rate, declin-\nage group.\nTouch\nTactile function was assessed via 2-point discrimination--\na standard and reliable method for measuring the finger's sen-\nsation to touch (Dellon & Keller, 1997; Dellon, Mackinnon, &\nCrosby,1987;Finnell,Knopp,Johnson,Holland,&Schubert,\n2004). These tests were performed using a multisided hand-\nheld discriminator with graded intraprong distances devel-\noped specifically for NSHAP by a metallurgical engineer.\nAlthough more sensitive and accurate devices are available\n(e.g., Mayfield & Sugarman, 2000), their cost and the time\nrequired to administer them preclude using them in a large,\nmultipurpose study conducted by survey interviewers in the\nhome (the desire to obtain data comparable to existing stud-\nies was also a factor). Respondents were first asked to close\ntheir eyes, after which the interviewer touched the tip of the\nindex finger of their dominant hand lightly with two small\nmetal points located a fixed distance apart. Respondents\nwere then asked whether they had felt one or two points; re-\nsponses such as \"three points\" or \"I feel something but I'm\nnot sure how many points\" were recorded by the interviewer\nas one point. Four tests were performed in succession: the\nfirst at 12 mm apart, the second consisting of only a single\npoint, the third at 8 mm, and the fourth at 4 mm.\nIn order to reduce the average length of the interview, the\nassessment of tactile function was administered to the same\nrandom half sample who received the vision assessment. Of\nequipment problem was reported by the interviewer in three\ncases, and 1 respondent broke off the interview at an earlier\npoint, leaving 1,474 respondents who completed at least\npart of the module. As with the taste identification module,\nafter each stimulus, respondents were permitted to indicate\nthat despite trying, they were unable to perform the task, at\nwhich point no further stimuli were administered. However,\nonly 39 respondents (3% of those participating) indicated\nthat they were unable to complete one of the tests; these\nresponses--together with the response \"I didn't feel any\npoints\" (1%\u00ad4%)--are treated as incorrect in the analyses\npresented here.\nTable 4 shows the percent correct and item nonresponse\nfor each of the four stimuli. As expected, respondents found\nit substantially more difficult to distinguish between points\nthat were 4 mm apart (only 41% correctly identified these as\ntwo distinct points). Interestingly, however, the same per-\ncentage of respondents (79%) were able to distinguish be-\ntween points 8 mm apart as were able to distinguish between\npoints 12 mm apart, suggesting that there is a plateau in the\nresponse function over this interval. Only slightly more\n(86%) correctly identified the single point.\nThe same item-response models used above were also fit\nto the 2-point discrimination data. Model 2A shows that the\n4 mm and single-point tasks load substantially less on the\nindividual factor being captured by the model. Regressing\nthat factor on gender and age group shows no difference in\nsensory ability between men and women but a decrease\nwith age, especially among the oldest group. For compari-\nson, Table 3 shows results from individual logistic regres-\nsions fit to each of the four items. The decline with age is\nmost evident for the 4 and 12 mm items and is not evident\nat all for the single-point item. Although women were\nslightly less likely to discriminate between the 12 mm points\n(this could, e.g., reflect a tendency on the part of the inter-\nviewers to touch the discriminator initially less heavily\nagainst some women's fingers), none of the other items ex-\nhibited a gender difference.\nFor expository purposes, we have modeled the single-\npoint item in the same manner as the other three. However,\nthe primary function of the single-point item was to prevent\nrespondents from simply guessing that all the stimuli in-\nvolved two points. Given this, together with the fact that\nidentifying a single point clearly represents a different task\nfrom discriminating between two points, one might argue\nthat this item should instead be modeled differently. This is\nunderscored by the fact that the likelihood of answering the\nsingle-point item correctly was not related to age.\nConclusions\nThe National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project is the\nfirst U.S. national study of older adults that has attempted to\nobtain a comprehensive assessment of sensory function. Con-\nsistent with previous clinical and population-based studies, the\ndata show age-related declines in functioning across each of\nthe five senses. Researchers may now use this data set to\nexamine whether certain subgroups exhibit greater declines\nthan others. In addition, researchers may now--for the first\ntime--begin to explore among older adults the relationships\nbetween sensory function and both the level of social par-\nticipation and the quality of intimate relationships. Future\nwaves of NSHAP will offer the ability to study changes in\nsensory function over time, providing an opportunity to\nexplore causal hypotheses involving sensory function and\nsocial interaction. Use of the self-report measures in con-\njunction with the objective assessments should also prove\ninformative here because one's perception of one's abilities\nmay serve to mediate the effects of actual changes in func-\ntion on social interaction.\nTo the best of our knowledge, NSHAP is the first survey\nstudy to attempt objective measurements of olfactory, gus-\ntatory, or tactile function. Although item nonresponse for\nthe gustation component ranged from 10% to 14% (the\nslightly higher rate was perhaps to be expected given the\nmore invasive nature of putting an object in one's mouth), it\nwas less than 5% for olfaction and touch. Results for olfac-\ntion and taste identification are similar to those obtained\nTable 4. Item-Response Models Fit to 2-Point Discrimination Data (SEs)\nDistance between points Percent correcta Item nonresponseb Parameter\nItem difficulty\nItem discrimination\nStructural model\nGender (vs. men)\nNotes: a Responses \"didn't feel any points\" and \"tried, unable to do\" are counted as incorrect.\nb Includes 32 respondents for whom entire taste module is missing (28 refusals, 3 due to equipment problems, and 1 interview break-off).\nfrom more in-depth studies using the same methodologies\nin more controlled settings, indicating that these protocols\ncan be administered successfully by field interviewers with\nolder adults in the home. The analyses presented here also\nshow that the resulting data may be analyzed with standard\nitem-response models. The 2-point discrimination data may\nprove to be an exception here because there is some indica-\ntion that the three graded distances, when taken together, do\nnot measure a single underlying dimension. More work is\nneeded to determine whether and how these items should be\nused together.\nThe analysis of the multi-item measures (i.e., olfaction,\ngustation, touch) presented here is intended merely to illus-\ntrate how the items may be combined for the purpose of in-\nvestigating the relationship between sensory function and\nother variables. However, scoring each item as either correct\nor incorrect as we have done here ignores the possibility that\nadditional information may be recovered by distinguishing\nbetween the various incorrect alternatives (e.g., the differ-\nence between salty and bitter may not be as large as the dif-\nference between salty and sweet). Polytomous choice models\nsimilar to those described here may be used to address this\nissue. Similarly, researchers interested in hearing may wish\nto analyze the two self-report measures together with the in-\nterviewer rating in order to investigate possible biases in the\nself-reports and to achieve a more efficient analysis.\nFinally, we note that a detailed analysis of a particular\nsensory function will likely require explicit consideration of\nseveral specific physiological factors known to affect that\nfunction. Because NSHAP included a broad assessment of\nhealth, many of these factors have been measured and are\ntherefore available for analysis. For example, a history of\neither nasal surgery or head injury is relevant to olfactory\nfunction and was included in the assessment of physical\nhealth. Similarly, the presence of several comorbid condi-\ntions (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes) and a complete\nlog of current medications were also obtained (see corre-\nsponding article in this volume for more details). These\ngreatly enhance the value of the sensory data.\nAuthor Contributions\nM.M., S.W., S.L., J.L., T.H., and S.T.L. all participated in designing the\nsensory function protocols used in the study.
