The higher\ncost per calorie of some recommended healthful foods, such as\nfruit and vegetables, may restrict their use by people with limited\nresources (2\u00ad6). Research on the relation between food prices and\ndiet quality can help explain the observed social disparities in\nnutritional status across socioeconomic strata (7). Although di-\netary surveillance in the United States at the individual level has\nnot accounted for food prices historically, a national food price\ndatabase has now become available (8).\nBased on individual nutrient intakes, dietary energy density,\nfruit and vegetable consumption, or adherence to a healthful diet\noverall, studies in Europe and Japan have linked higher diet costs\nwith higher-quality diets (9\u00ad15). In other observational studies,\na higher diet cost was positively associated with biomarkers of\nnutrient intake and was negatively associated with BMI (11, 14,\n16). In 2 US-based studies, persons with higher energy-adjusted\ndiet costs consumed fewer calories and had higher intakes of\nvitamin C, potassium, and fiber (17, 18). This relation between\ndiet quality indicators and diet cost was more pronounced for\nwomen than for men (17). Recent analyses of the Nurses' Health\nStudy data showed a positive association between the alternative\nHEI4 score and energy-adjusted diet cost, and, notably, that not\nall components of a healthy diet were cost sensitive (19).\nAs noted in a recent USDA report (20), analyses of diet quality in\nrelation to diet cost in the United States have been hampered by\na lack of appropriate data. On one hand, dietary intake and health\ndatabases, all at the individual level, have lacked information on the\nmonetary cost of the foods consumed. On the other hand, databases\non food expenditures and the economics of food purchase behavior\ntypically provide food-purchasing data at the household or higher\nlevels of aggregation, rather than at the individual level. Moreover,\nsuch data sets provide no details on actual food consumption or\nhealth at the individual level.\nIn the present study, individual-level diet costs for 4744 par-\nsurvey were calculated by attachment of the national food price\ndatabase to dietary intake data. This linkage allowed for a de-\nscriptive characterization of the relation between diet cost and diet\nquality across socioeconomic strata, all at the individual level.\nNHANES\na single 24-h dietary recall, in which respondents reported all\nfoods and beverages consumed the previous day, from midnight\n1 From the School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.

The 24-h recall data set included the amount in\ngrams and a description of each individual food and beverage\nconsumed, based on an 8-digit USDA food code. All recalls\nidentified as reliable by NHANES staff and that met the minimum\ncriteria for completeness were included in this study. The ex-\namination protocol, data collection methods, and factors used to\nevaluate the reliability and quality of each 24-h recall are\ndocumented elsewhere (21). Individuals who completed a reli-\nable 24-h recall were included in the present study (n = 4744 of\nData from the demographic and food-security questionnaires\nwere also used in the present analyses. Primary stratification\nvariables from the demographic questionnaire were age group\nethnicity (Mexican American/other Hispanic, non-Hispanic\nwhite, and non-Hispanic black), family income-to-poverty ratio\n(,2, 2\u00ad3.99, or 4), and educational attainment (,high school,\nhigh school graduate/equivalent, some college, or college grad-\nuate). The Mexican American and \"other Hispanic\" groups were\ncombined because of small numbers in the \"other Hispanic\"\ngroup. Individuals who indicated that they belonged to another\nrace group or multiracial group were included in all analyses,\nbut their cost and diet quality estimates were not presented\nbecause this group was heterogeneous and the point estimates\nwere highly variable because of the small sample size. Family\nincome-to-poverty ratio adjusts for the number of adults and\nchildren in each family. Analyses of educational attainment\nwere limited to adults aged 25 y, because most adults have\ncompleted their education by this age. Household food security\nwas assessed by an 18-item Food Security Survey Module. In-\ndividuals were dichotomized as either fully food secure or not\nfully food secure (with or without hunger).\nFood price database\nThe CNPP price database, released in May 2008, provided the\ncost per 1 g edible portion of all foods and beverages reported in\nNHANES dietary recalls, with the exclusion of alcoholic bev-\nerages and water (8). The prices were based on retail prices paid\nby members of the Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel during\nreflected the average prices paid by households across the United\nStates. In creating the database CNPP made the assumption that\nall foods and beverages were obtained from stores. Accordingly,\nthe database did not permit estimations of actual food expen-\nditures. Rather, merging of the CNPP database with the NHANES\nprovided estimates of the monetary value of foods consumed,\nwhich can be used in the assessment of the \"economic acces-\nsibility\" of a healthy diet.\nFull documentation of how the food price database was created\nis available from the CNPP (8). In brief, all foods reported in the\ndiet recall were translated into a purchasable form. Mixed dishes\nthat were prepared from a recipe were decomposed into ingre-\ndients in purchasable form. For example, a portion of vegetable\nlasagna reported in NHANES was broken down into 17 separate\ningredients, which included 3 types of fresh cheese; canned\ntomato paste; raw spinach; and cooked, enriched macaroni. Each\nfood had to be in purchasable form and was adjusted for prep-\naration and cooking losses and gains. In some cases, mixed dishes\nwere deemed to be in ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat form, which\nmeans that no ingredients were analyzed because the dish could\nbe obtained either from a deli section or refrigeration case. Next,\nthe list of all foods and beverages in purchasable form was\nmatched to price data for the foods and beverages reported in the\nNielsen panel. Finally, prices were computed per gram edible\nportion based on the average purchase price. The prices for\na small number of foods and beverages (n = 32) were missing or\nwere identified as potentially extreme within-group outliers and\nwere substituted with prices for comparable foods (eg, the price\nper gram of grape nuts was 3 times higher than that of similar\ncereals, or prices for some berries such as loganberries and\nmulberries were missing). This substitution was done by the\nauthors.\nAdditional data from the CPI Average Price Data Series were\nused to estimate the prices of alcoholic beverages (22) that were\nnot available from the CNPP. Prices were available for beer, wine,\nsystematically different from those in the CNPP database, be-\ncause the CPI database is used for retail price monitoring, not to\nreflect consumer expenditures. In light of this, we first compared\nthe prices of select foods with known prices from the CNPP\ndatabase with the prices from the same year's CPI, to evaluate the\ndegree by which the CNPP database may under- or overestimate\nthe prices compared with the CPI database. The comparison\nfoods were fresh celery, ground coffee, and white bread. These\nitems were selected based on the availability of price estimates\nfor multiple years in the CPI, the high frequency of consumption\nof these foods in NHANES, and the variability of food groups\nrepresented. We showed that prices per edible portion were\n10.4% lower in the CNPP database compared with the CPI data,\nso the CPI alcohol prices were downwardly adjusted by this\namount to account for this systematic difference. The final step\nwas to attach these adjusted prices to the CNPP database, in-\ncluding the creation of recipes for mixed drinks with the use of\ncommon drink recipes. For example, the estimated price per 1 g\nof vodka tonic was 0.33 \u00b7 price of vodka/g + 0.67 \u00b7 price of\ntonic/g multiplied by the portion in grams consumed.\nDeriving monetary value\nThe monetary value of the diet was computed from each\nindividual's dietary recall in combination with the price database\nby multiplication of the price per gram by the portion of each food\nconsumed by the respondent, and then the summing of these\nvalues for each participant. Diet cost was estimated for all foods\nand beverages, including alcohol. Tap and bottled water were\nexcluded from the monetary cost estimation.\nBecause the monetary value of the diet was highly correlated\nwith the total quantity of food and energy consumed (r = 0.72 for\ngrams and r = 0.78 for kilocalories), the energy-adjusted diet\ncost was computed and expressed per 2000 kcal with the use of\nthe residual method of energy adjustment (23). The distributions\nof both energy and diet cost were positively skewed, so energy\nand cost were log transformed and back transformed into natural\nunits to ensure that the energy-adjusted diet cost variable was\nuncorrelated with energy. The energy-adjusted cost variable is\nmore meaningful when comparisons are made between sub-\npopulations that may have different energy requirements or in-\ntakes. The energy-adjusted diet cost variable was grouped into\nquintiles for all analyses.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThe HEI-2005 was the primary outcome variable. As docu-\nquality was based on consumption of 2 nutrients (sodium and\nsaturated fat) and 9 food/beverage groups (total fruit, whole fruit,\ntotal vegetables, dark green and orange vegetables, milk, total\ngrains, whole grains, meat and beans, and oils) and a measure of\nempty calories (SoFAAS). Each HEI-2005 component score can\ncontribute 5 points (eg, total fruit or total grains), 10 points (eg,\nmeat and beans, or energy from saturated fat), or 20 points\n(SoFAAS). Higher HEI-2005 scores indicate better diet quality;\nand each subscore are calculated on a per-calorie basis and\nare therefore adjusted for energy. For saturated fat, sodium, and\nenergy from SoFAAS, higher HEI subscores reflected lower\nintakes. For the remaining 9 HEI-2005 food groups to encourage,\nhigher subscores reflected higher intakes.\nAnalytic approach\nAge-adjusted diet costs and energy-adjusted diet costs by\nindependent variables of interest were estimated by the fitting of\nsurvey-weighted linear regression models with diet cost as the\noutcome, and the independent variable of interest (eg, race-\nethnicity or income-to-poverty ratio) and age group as covariates.\nThe predicted marginal for each level or category was estimated\nto determine the mean diet cost for each category or level of the\nindependent variable. These values represented the mean at the\naverage age distribution for the population of interest. A com-\nparable approach was used to estimate the age-adjusted mean\nHEI-2005 scores by demographic and sociodemographic varia-\nbles of interest. This approach is described in more detail below.\nBecause a single 24-h dietary recall does not sufficiently\ncapture usual dietary intakes, which are ultimately the target of\ndietary recommendations and guidance, we used the score of the\npopulation ratio method recommended by Freedman et al (26) in\nanalyses of HEI-2005 scores and subscores. This method has\nbeen shown to best reflect group-level dietary patterns when only\na single 24-h recall is available. The method adapted for use here\nis described in detail elsewhere (27). A survey-weighted linear\nregression model was first separately fit for total energy and each\nsubscore (eg, total fruit consumption) that included the in-\ndependent variable of interest (eg, quintiles of energy-adjusted\ndiet cost) and covariates (eg, age group). The predicted marginals\nwere then estimated for each level of the categorical independent\nvariable. With the use of the formula for each component and the\ncovariate-adjusted calorie estimate, the HEI-2005 subscores were\nthen estimated. This step was repeated for each independent\nvariable of interest. Each subscore was truncated at the specified\nthe truncated subscores. The SEs of the adjusted HEI-2005 and\nthe subscores were estimated with the use of a stratified jackknife\nvariance estimator, which was the approach described by Korn\nand Graubard (28) and used by Breslow et al (27). The SEs and\nsubsequent hypothesis tests based on this method were notably\nmore conservative than the Taylor-series linearization SE esti-\nmates with survey data. However, the reduction in bias of an\nHEI-2005 score that reflected actual intake greatly outweighed\nthe loss of statistical precision. For hypothesis testing for unordered\ncategorical predictors, a survey-weighted Wald test was used. For\nordered categorical variables, a linear trend test was used. P\nvalues ,0.05 were considered statistically significant. When\na significant trend or association was observed, pairwise tests\nwere conducted with the use of a survey-weighted Wald test.\nAnalyses of the association between energy-adjusted diet cost\nand HEI-2005 used the same approach, with adjustment for age\ngroup, sex, and race-ethnicity. Effect modification by sex was\nexpected, based on previous reports, and a multiplicative in-\nteraction term was significant (P , 0.01 in a model with ad-\njustment for age group and race-ethnicity) (18). An exploratory\nanalysis evaluated the association between diet cost and the\nHEI-2005 subscores, with adjustment for age group and race-\nethnicity. The adjusted means for each subscore by energy-\nadjusted diet cost quintile were estimated for men and women\nseparately with the use of the same score of population means\napproach described above for each subscore. The HEI-2005 was\ncalculated with the use of SAS software (version 9.1; SAS In-\nstitute) and statistical analyses with the use of Stata software\nRESULTS\nDiet cost and HEI-2005 by sociodemographic strata\nDiet costs and HEI-2005 scores by demographic strata are\nprovided in Table 1. The age-adjusted mean diet cost was $4.81\ncalories and the HEI generally increased with age. Women had\nDifferences in diet cost and the HEI were also observed by race-\nethnicity. The age-adjusted mean diet cost for non-Hispanic white\nadults was greater than among Hispanic and non-Hispanic black\nadults. There was some indication that Hispanic respondents had\nhigher HEI-2005 scores than did non-Hispanic whites, but the\ndifference was not statistically significant.\nLower family income-to-poverty ratio and educational at-\ntainment were associated with lower diet cost and lower HEI-\n2005 scores. Living in a food-secure household was associated\nwith higher energy-adjusted diet cost and higher HEI when\ncompared with individuals who lived in a household with any\ndegree of food insecurity.\nModeling the relation between diet cost and HEI-2005\nFor men and women combined, and for both sexes separately,\nthere was a significant and positive association between higher\ndiet cost and higher HEI-2005 score (Table 2). Persons in the\npoints higher than those with the lowest-cost diets. As expected,\nthe association was stronger among women, as shown by the\nlarge difference in the values between quintiles of diet cost.\nHEI-2005 scores for men and women in the highest quintile of\ndiet cost were, respectively, 9.7 and 17.1 points higher than for\npersons in the lowest quintile. Additional adjustment for edu-\ncational attainment and income-to-poverty ratio did not alter the\nobserved association between energy-adjusted diet cost and HEI\n(data not shown). Secondary analyses with the use of a ratio of\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwere conducted and yielded nearly identical results (results\navailable from authors).\nModeling the relation between diet cost and HEI-2005\ncomponent scores\nHigher-cost diets were associated with a significantly higher\nconsumption of fruit and vegetables per 1000 calories, as shown\nin Table 3. The trend was apparent for both sexes but was\nstronger for women. Among men, only the highest-diet-cost\nquintile failed to earn the maximal HEI-2005 subscore for total\ngrains. Among men, a weak negative association was observed\nfor diet cost and the subscore for milk, whereas a nonsignificant\npositive association was observed for women. For neither sex\ndid we observe a trend between diet cost and HEI-2005 sub-\nscores for whole grains. Higher-cost diets contained less satu-\nrated fat and less energy from SoFAAS as a percentage of total\ncalories. The negative relation between diet cost and SoFAAS\nwas markedly stronger among women. Higher-cost diets con-\nsumed by women included more meat and beans than did lower-\ncost diets. Of dietary components to limit, only consumption of\nsodium increased with more costly diets.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize dif-\nferences in diet cost by sociodemographic groups with the use of\nindividual-level data from a nationally representative sample of\nthe US population. A significant association between diet cost\nand HEI-2005 score was observed for the entire US population\nand for men alone, and it was especially strong for women. This\nassociation held after adjustment for additional sociodemo-\ngraphic factors (income and educational attainment).

Within the United\nStates, diet costs varied by population subgroups as characterized\nby race-ethnicity, education, and income. Non-Hispanic whites\nhad higher diet costs than did non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmerican/other Hispanics. However, despite lower diet costs,\nthere was some suggestion that Hispanics had higher HEI-2005\nscores than did non-Hispanic whites. We also identified some\ngroups that consumed lower-cost, yet higher-quality diets; these\ngroups included older adults, women, and Mexican Americans/\nother Hispanics (see Table 1). Studies of the relation between\ndiet quality and diet cost at different levels of income and educa-\ntional attainment can add to our understanding of the mechanisms\nbehind the observed disparities in nutrition and health.\nRecent dietary guidelines have emphasized an increase in the\nconsumption of fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and\nwhole grains, whereas energy from solid fat and added sugars is\nreduced (29, 30). An examination of each component score of the\nHEI-2005 separately in relation to diet cost showed that some\ncomponent scores were associated with higher diet costs, whereas\nother component scores were not. Higher consumption of total\nvegetables, dark-green/orange vegetables and legumes, and whole\nfruit among both men and women was associated with higher\ncosts. By contrast, total grains, whole grains, and milk and milk\nproducts were largely cost neutral. Food pattern modeling studies\nare required to determine whether the implementation of the 2010\nDietary Guidelines on a population basis would entail an addi-\ntional diet cost.\nIt is important to emphasize that the present analyses were\nbased on the intrinsic monetary value of the diet and not on actual\nfood expenditures. For example, the present estimate of mean diet\ncost for a NHANES participant was $4.81/d. By contrast, the\n2002 CEX estimated individual expenditure on food and alco-\nholic beverages to be $6.30/d, based on yearly purchases (31).\nHEI-2005 component scores by energy-adjusted diet cost quintile1\nscores for men\nscores for women\n1 Values are means 6 SEs adjusted for age and race-ethnicity.

First, the\nestimates based on NHANES data included only foods actually\nconsumed, whereas CEX data were based on expenditures for all\nfoods purchased but not necessarily consumed. Second, the as-\nsumption made by the USDA in creating the CNPP food price\ndatabase was that all foods were purchased in retail settings and\nprepared at home. Whereas foods and beverages consumed in\nrestaurants and other eating establishments are included in the\ncurrent estimates, the CNPP food price database does not account\nfor the added cost for service and preparation (8). In contrast, the\nCEX did include all food expenditures from retail stores and\nrestaurants. Although the approach used here did not permit\nestimations of food expenditures, it provided estimates of the\nmonetary value of the foods consumed. The latter measure might\nbe useful in future research to evaluate the affordability of a\nhealthy diet with current eating patterns.\nThe substitution of prices from restaurants and other food\nservice establishments with store-bought foods for prices in the\nCNPP database represents one of the limitations of this study.\nEvidence from the CEX suggests that the purchase of away-from-\nhome foods accounts for a greater proportion of food spending for\nindividuals who live in more affluent households, which suggests\nthat the differences by socioeconomic status observed here are\nlikely to be even more profound. Another limitation is that the\nfood price database was computed from prices paid by a national\npanel that lacked geographic specificity, which do not represent\nthe prices actually paid by respondents in the sample. Variation\nmay occur at the regional level (ie, differences in prices between\nthe northeast and southwest regions of the United States) or local\nlevel (ie, difference in food prices between types or location of\nretailers within a city or region) (32). For these reasons, the\nobserved differences of diet cost between sociodemographic\nsubgroups were most likely conservative, especially if more\naffluent individuals were more likely to purchase foods from\nmore expensive grocery stores or purchase more costly versions of\na nutritionally comparable food (eg, organic free-range chicken\ncompared with nonorganic chicken).\nMoreover, the diet costs reported here are based on the 24-h\nrecall dietary assessment, which can underestimate portion sizes\nor fail to include foods and beverages that are either forgotten or\nconsumed infrequently, yet these limitations are inherent in all\ndietary assessment methods (8, 23). Together, these factors\nproduce a downward bias on the diet cost estimate and contribute\nto the difference between the estimates observed here and the US\nconsumer food expenditures in the CEX survey. In addition,\nbecause only a single 24-h recall was used to estimate diet cost,\nthe distribution observed here is wider than would be observed\nif multiple recalls were available (23). The data used here are\nthe only data for individual diet cost, diet quality, and health\nmeasures in a nationally representative sample.\nHowever, the results of the present analyses, based on 24-h\nrecalls and retail food prices, are consistent with past results. In\npast studies, dietary intake data obtained from food-frequency\nwere merged with local or national food store prices, as was done\nin this study. To our knowledge, no study has measured actual\nfood expenditures at the individual level in relation to diet quality\nand health. The strengths and weaknesses of dietary intake data\nhave been well documented (23). Many of the same issues relate\nto the estimation of diet cost (ie, error from misestimation of\nportion size or omitted foods or in the nutrient or price database\nmay result in error in the diet cost estimate). Despite the diverse\nassessment methods and diet quality measures, the results of\ninvestigations into the association between cost and diet quality\nhave been consistent.\nIn this study we observed an association between diet quality\nand diet cost: higher-cost diets tended to be higher in quality. The\nassociation between diet cost and diet quality observed here may\nbe one mechanism that contributes to diet-related health dis-\nparities (35). Identification of features of low-cost yet nutritious\ndiets is an urgent priority, given that under current consumption\npatterns, more-costly diets were associated with higher diet\nquality. Previous work has shown that eggs, beans, whole grains,\ncitrus fruit, potatoes, and carrots were among affordable yet\nThe goal of this observational study was to describe the as-\nsociation between diet quality and costs in the diets consumed by\nUS adults. Whether high-quality diets would still be associated\nwith higher diet costs if population eating habits were to change is\na different question, best addressed by diet optimization mod-\neling (36). Modeling studies, based on linear programming, can\ntake nutritional and consumption data and cost constraints into\naccount to create food-intake patterns that are nutritionally im-\nproved but cost neutral (37). One important avenue of research is\nthe identification of individuals and groups that consume lower-\ncost yet higher-quality diets. In this study, these groups included\nolder adults, women, and Mexican Americans/other Hispanics.\nFurther examination of the diets of these groups is warranted and\nmay help inform policies and guidance to promote food patterns\nthat are both healthful and affordable. The combination of\nNHANES and the CNPP food price database remains a practical\nresource, useful in the evaluation of diet cost and diet quality in\nthe US population.\nWe thank 3 anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on a previous draft.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--CR, PM, and AD: design\nand conducting of the research.
