Vega3\nThe authors investigated whether self-rated health (SRH) had differential mortality risks for Latino(a) adults of\nvarious acculturation statuses living in the United States. They used cumulative National Health Interview Survey\nfiles (1,364 deaths) that match records from the National Death Index through 1997.The authors specified survival\nmodels to estimate the effect of SRH on mortality and further stratified their model by birth and duration in the\nUnited States as proxies for acculturation. These estimates were compared across strata. Poor SRH was found to\nbe a weaker predictor of subsequent mortality risk among the less acculturated, although the overall risk among\nthe aggregated sample is similar to the risk reported in previous studies. The relation between poor SRH and\nmortality risk increases with United States acculturation among Latinos. While poor SRH was significantly\nassociated with short-term mortality among the least acculturated, this association did not persist beyond 2-year\nmortality risk.

Finch, School of Public Health,\nmail: bkfinch@uclink.berkeley.edu).\nThe validity of self-rated health (SRH) measures, in terms\nof their predictive import for mortality risk, has been estab-\nlished in multiple studies. A well-cited review concludes\nthat SRH is an independent predictor of mortality, above and\nbeyond physician assessments of health (1). Global SRH\nmeasures generally include a question such as \"How would\nyou rate your overall health?\" and offer five response cate-\ngories that range from excellent to poor. SRH measures are\noften dichotomized as fair/poor versus all other categories\nsince the poor/fair categories represent expressions of health\ndistress and/or the presence of disease; a rating of fair/poor\nalso represents a heightened mortality risk.\nResponses to SRH may vary depending on the race/\nethnicity of the person being interviewed, however. For\nexample, Latinos may somatize their emotional/mental\nhealth into physical health constructs (2) such as SRH.\nSomatization in this regard is defined as the tendency to pre-\nsent health complaints that are indicative of personal or\nsocial problems. Because of this tendency, Latino immi-\ngrants rate themselves in poorer health than do native-born\nLatinos; several studies have confirmed this result (3\u00ad5).\nThis finding is a troubling anomaly amidst burgeoning\nevidence of an inverse relation between acculturation and\nhealth (5). Numerous studies have demonstrated that higher\nlevels of acculturation among immigrant Latinos are posi-\ntively related to the following health outcomes: adult mor-\n(13), psychologic distress (14), deleterious health behaviors\nfor several nonfatal morbidities (19). Therefore, what\nshould we make of the apparent anomalous relation between\nSRH and acculturation? After all, a growing Latino popula-\ntion in the United States, largely due to increased immigra-\ntion, has important implications for the ability of health\nresearchers to quickly and easily compare the health status\nof multiethnic populations in the United States through the\nuse of SRH questions.\nFollowing McGee et al. (20), we sought to assess the\nvalidity of SRH for mortality risk by using a sample of\nLatino adults who were characterized as having different\nlevels of acculturation to US society. Our primary research\nquestion was, \"Are subsequent mortality risks among\nLatinos who rate themselves in fair/poor health moderated\nby levels of acculturation?\"\nData set\nWe utilized a unique data set that aggregates multiple\n(NHIS) (21) and is linked to the NHIS: Multiple Cause of\neach year of the NHIS were searched for in the National\nDeath Index and matched according to a complex scoring\nalgorithm. Potential matches were classified according to\nthe strength of the match, and we utilize the match that is\nrecommended by National Center for Health Statistics and\nhas been estimated to classify more than 97 percent of the\nsubjects correctly.\nWe selected only the subsample of respondents who self-\nidentified as Latino/Hispanic from each year of the NHIS;\n75 percent of respondents live in California, Texas, New\nYork, Florida, Illinois, Arizona, and New Jersey. Although\nwe excluded those for whom a self-rating of health is miss-\ning (n  160), we utilized dummy variables for each covari-\nate that controlled for missing data to minimize nonresponse\nbias. Our final sample size included 37,713 Latino adults\nwho were age 18 years or older at the time of the survey\nof the 1997 matching with the National Death Index.\nMeasures\nOur key predictor variable was SRH, and our key interest\nwas in the estimated magnitude of this variable on mortality\nrisk across respondents of varying acculturation status. We\ntreated SRH as a dichotomous measure, distinguishing\nbetween those who rate themselves in fair/poor health ver-\nsus all others (excellent/very good/good). Since the lan-\nguage of the survey was not available, we used a proxy for\nacculturation from duration of stay in the United States; this\nvariable was categorized into three strata, including\n1) recent immigrant, less than 10 years in the United States\nalso included dummy variables for national origin, compris-\ning Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central/\nSouth Americans, and other Latinos.\nOther demographic variables included age, sex, and mar-\nital status. Socioeconomic controls included education,\nannual family income, and employment status. Since these\nvariables came from a cross-sectional survey, they were\nmeasured at the time of the baseline survey only and were\ntime invariant.\nMethodology\nWe first used weighted Cox proportional hazards models\n(23) to estimate the effects of SRH on mortality risk. Our\nmodeling strategy was to look first at the overall risk of\nmortality by SRH status among our entire Latino sample\nand then to stratify this relation according to birth/duration\nin the United States. We also estimated piecewise constant\nhazard models (23), which served two purposes. First,\npiecewise constants allowed us to account better for hetero-\ngeneity of hazards over time (i.e., nonproportionality), and\nsecond, piecewise constant models allowed us to determine\nwhether SRH ratings had a short- or long-term predictive\nvalue for mortality risk.\nRESULTS\nWe present the results of our proportional hazards models\nas hazard ratios in tables 1 and 2; 95 percent confidence\nintervals directly follow the hazard ratios.\nTable 1 presents the models, stratified by birth/duration in\nthe United States. The overall mortality risk (right-hand col-\numn) for rating oneself in fair/poor health relative to better\nhealth was nearly twofold (hazard ratio  1.80) over the\nsubsequent follow-up period (net of covariates). Our strati-\nfied models show a monotonic increase of SRH on mortal-\nity risk as level of acculturation increases. That is, the mor-\ntality risk of fair/poor SRH for recent immigrants is 1.28\ntimes that of those who rate themselves in better health, but\nis statistically nonsignificant. Among long-term immigrants,\nfair/poor SRH is associated with a risk of dying that is 1.74\ntimes that of those who rate themselves in better health; this\nrisk rises to 2.04 among native-born Latinos.\nWe performed a formal chi-squared check of the propor-\ntionality assumption for SRH and mortality risk. Although\nproportionality was confirmed with 95 percent statistical\nconfidence among immigrants, the hazard ratios among the\nnative born begin to converge over the course of the follow-\nup period. Thus, we specified piecewise-constant hazard\nmodels to assess differential mortality risk over several dif-\nferent time periods. We ran four separate regression models\nthat specify two constants for the following time periods:\nfull results for each of these models, we present only the\nhazard ratios (table 2) for each acculturation level, control-\nling for the full set of social and demographic factors.\nIn model 1 (table 2), for example, a fair/poor rating of\nhealth is associated with a two and a half-fold or higher mor-\ntality risk for 2-year mortality follow-up (0\u00ad24 months)\namong all acculturation groups. However, although poor\nSRH is predictive of mortality beyond 2 years for native-\nborn and long-term immigrant respondents, it is not predic-\nsimilar pattern emerges when examining different periods of\nfollow-up risk. That is, fair/poor SRH is predictive of mor-\ntality only for a very short period of risk (i.e., less than 2\nyears) among recent immigrants and is not a statistically sig-\nnificant predictor for any period of time beyond that. On the\nother hand, for both long-term immigrants and native-born\nrespondents, fair/poor SRH is predictive of mortality risk for\na much longer time period. However, the strength of this\nassociation diminishes over time such that fair/poor SRH is\nno longer predictive of mortality risk after an initial 5-year\nobservation period.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results indicated that SRH has limitations in predict-\ning mortality risk among Latinos. A previous study has\nshown that all race/ethnic groups exhibit similar mortality\nrisks for fair/poor SRH (20); we observe a similar risk\namong the pooled sample of Latinos in our study. However,\nValidity of Self-rated Health 757\nour study indicates that these cross-ethnic comparisons may\nnot be valid when immigrants make up a large portion of\nstudy samples. More specifically, although fair/poor SRH\nwas associated with short-term mortality risk among those\nwith low levels of acculturation, this rating was not predic-\ntive of long-term mortality risk (i.e., after 2 years). On the\nother hand, as levels of acculturation increase among\nLatinos, fair/poor SRH has stronger effects and longer-\nlasting predictive power for subsequent mortality risk. That\nis, the predictive power of SRH among the more accultur-\nated should more closely match those of non-Hispanic\nWhite and non-Hispanic Black respondents who are born in\nthe United States.\nAs a cautionary note, differential rates of return migration\nTABLE 1.

However, if those who rate them-\nselves in fair/poor health are lost to follow-up because of\nreturn migration to Mexico, at higher rates than those who\nrate themselves in good health, then our results may be\naffected by this bias.\nOur findings imply that the use of SRH for cross-ethnic\ncomparisons of physical health may be problematic.\nDemographically, since foreign-born respondents make up\ngreater percentages of survey samples (because they are\nbecoming a greater proportion of the US population), the\nability to quickly assess health for all subjects equally\nthrough the use of SRH becomes more problematic.\nTherefore, it is very important to control for levels of accul-\nturation within and between groups for whom comparisons\nare being made so that potentially artifactual components of\nSRH can be factored out.\nREFERENCES\n1.
