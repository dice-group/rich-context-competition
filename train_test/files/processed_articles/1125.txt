Household and neighborhood en-\nvironments have substantial effects on body weight (e.g.,\n3,4), related health behaviors [e.g., PA (5,6), and fast food\nintake (7)] and are important modifiable risk factors for\nobesity prevention/reduction strategies.\nQuantifying genetic and environmental influences on\nhealth outcomes is challenging. Genetic factors affect phys-\niological processes related to PA (8) and weight (9,10), but\nepidemiological studies of environment effects typically do\nnot account for genetic predisposition. The extent to which\ngenes contribute to body size, exercise, and/or food prefer-\nences is widely debated. For example, an estimated 50% to\n90% of variability in adiposity is attributable to genetics\n(11). Population-wide genetic differences may substantially\nlimit the ability to detect environmental effects on health\n(particularly modest effects) using cohort studies of non-\nrelated individuals.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Family/\nhousehold environments during childhood may influence\nlong-term health behaviors and may confound or bias esti-\nmates of environment-health associations. These method-\nological concerns continue to fuel the widespread debate\nover the true magnitude of environmental effects on obesity\nand related health behaviors.\nPedigree studies provide a unique opportunity to address\ngenetic variation in a population and the influence of un-\nmeasured or poorly measured confounding encountered in\nobservational cohort studies. The transition from adoles-\ncence to adulthood, when a substantial number of individ-\nuals relocate to new environments, allows assessment of\nrelative contributions of environmental and genetic influ-\nences in shared vs. non-shared environments. Following\nindividuals who are genetically similar and share childhood\nhousehold and neighborhood environments, we can evalu-\nate variation in health behaviors and subsequent behavior\nchanges as individuals move into different environments.\nBy concurrently assessing individuals with varying degrees\nof genetic relatedness (in shared households as children and\nadolescents), we can account for multiple shared environ-\nmental and genetic sources of variation, providing the op-\nportunity to better tease apart causal effects on health using\nmethods not possible with traditional cohort studies.\nOur analyses use sibling data from the National Longi-\ntudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). As ado-\nlescents, participants shared household and neighborhood\nenvironments plus various other unmeasured genetic and\nfamilial factors. As young adults, some continued to share\nhouseholds, whereas others moved to new environments.\nTherefore, this design provides a natural experiment that\ncan be used to supplement findings from cohort studies\nquantifying environmental effects on health trends during\nthis critical stage of life. The specific aims of this paper\nwere to examine the correlations of various health measures\nin monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins\ncontinuing to live together as young adults, vs. those who\nlive apart, and to quantify additive genetic and household\neffects on BMI and related health behaviors in a large\nsample of siblings and non-siblings sharing family and\nhousehold environments.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nAdd Health\nAdd Health is a nationally representative, longitudinal\nsurvey of youths, grades 7 to 12.

We hypothesized that such differences reflect the\ninfluence of external characteristics on behavior (e.g., phys-\nical environment and resource accessibility) (30,31). For\nexample, compared with twins living together, MZ twins\nliving apart had greater discordance in BMI gain and young\nadult BMI, and DZ twins had greater longitudinal change in\nMVPA and young adult fast food intake. In contrast to our\nhypothesis, however, MZ twins living apart were more\nhighly correlated in longitudinal and young adult sedentary\nbehavior, and DZ twins were more highly correlated in\nlikelihood of achieving 5 bouts of MVPA per week. We\ncould not determine the extent to which twins' non-shared\nhousehold environments differed in adulthood. Future work\nshould investigate how specific differences in non-shared\nenvironments affect these inconsistencies in divergent\nhealth patterns.\nOverall, our findings highlight important genetic and\nenvironmental influences on obesity and related health be-\nhaviors. Genetic influences are robust during the adolescent\nand young adult periods. These results indicate that additive\ngenetic effects account for approximately one-third to one-\nhalf of variation in overweight/obesity during this time, as\nwell as 12% to 60% of variation in obesity-related behav-\niors.\nThe influence of childhood environment is also impor-\ntant, persisting into young adulthood, even after households\nare no longer shared. Our results show that the household/\nphysical environment during childhood/adolescence ac-\ncounted for 10% of variation in adolescent fast food\nintake and sedentary behaviors and 50% of adolescent\noverweight. Interestingly, household effects on MVPA were\nsubstantially greater in young adulthood (accounting for\n50% of variation) compared with adolescence (when\nhousehold effects accounted for 10% of variation). Our\nresults underscore the importance of household and physical\nenvironments as determinants of behavior, leaving a lasting\nimpression on youth that may affect future decision-making\nand the adoption of healthy behaviors in new environments\nlater in life.\nMoreover, our findings indicate that environmental ef-\nfects may vary, becoming more influential in determining\nphenotypic extremes (as evidenced by the increasing house-\nhold component accounting for variation in BMI-for-age z\nscores, risk for overweight, and overweight, respectively).\nThese findings suggest that in conducting genome-wide\nlinkage studies to identify obesity-related quantitative trait\nloci, the practice of specifically targeting pedigrees with\nphenotypic extremes in childhood (32) may not be helpful\nbecause the effects of environmental influences seem to be\nlarger in individuals with phenotypic extremes during ado-\nlescence.\nAlthough our findings show a substantial influence of\nyoung adult household environments on frequency of fast\nfood intake (accounting for 12% of variation), other sig-\nnificant effects of households were not detected. At this\nstage of the life course, however, individuals may have been\nexposed to their new environments for relatively short du-\nrations. The environments of young adults may have not\nbeen stable for a long enough time period to substantially\ninfluence these behaviors. Therefore, detecting environmen-\ntal effects on some behaviors may be possible only later in\nadulthood. Future research is needed to assess individuals in\nmid-adulthood, where environmental effects may be more\npronounced.\nInterpretation of our findings requires additional caveats.\nFirstly, our diet measures are broad indicators of dietary\npatterning and do not provide quantification of energy bal-\nance, which is likely under both genetic and environmental\ncontrol. Furthermore, our findings show a noteworthy im-\npact of unmeasured/unknown (residual) effects on outcomes\nof interest, especially behaviors that are difficult to measure\nwith precision (e.g., activity and dietary characteristics, in\ncomparison with BMI). In particular, between Waves II and\nIII, genetic and household effects generally decreased,\nwhereas residual effects increased. These residual effects\nmay represent several different factors including differential\nresponses of individuals to similar exposures (e.g., house-\nhold/neighborhood environmental exposures) and/or mea-\nsurement error. More importantly, residual variation may\njointly affect numerous weight-related phenotypes, as illus-\ntrated by our bivariate analyses, and, thus, may be important\nto explore.\nIn addition, our estimates of genetic effects may be mar-\nginally inflated. For example, twins may share additional\nhousehold, parental, or other influences that other siblings\nliving in the same household do not share, thus violating any\nequal-environment assumptions (11). In our analyses, these\neffects would be included as additive genetic effects. Our\nstudy design is limited by not sampling related individuals\nliving in different adolescent households, thus reducing our\nability to precisely distinguish genetic and adolescent\nhousehold effects and potentially influencing effect estimate\nstability. Thus, we suggest that future work build on twin\nand extended pedigree models to include detailed measures\ncharacterizing specific attributes of shared and non-shared\nenvironments (among related and unrelated individuals) to\nbetter understand determinants of health behavior, tease\napart residual effects, and describe factors that may vary\nbetween siblings in a family.\nImpact of Shared Environments on BMI, Nelson et al.\nDespite these caveats, our findings provide important\ninsight into obesity etiology and, to our knowledge, are the\nfirst to use these methods in a large longitudinal sibling\nsample to quantify environmental and genetic influences on\nBMI and health behavior during this critical life stage.\nAlthough a strong genetic component of resting energy\nexpenditure has been previously established by twin and\nfamily studies (e.g., 33), the importance of heritability in PA\nand sedentary behavior has been less studied. Familial re-\nsemblance in physical performance, exercise response, and\nlong-term exercise frequency has been demonstrated in\nadults (34\u00ad37) and, to a more limited extent, in children\n(38,39), although the literature has not been entirely con-\nsistent in documenting these similarities (40). In adoles-\ncence, we estimated that the variance accounted for by\nadditive genetic effects of PA was 60% and of adolescent\nweight status, fast food intake, and sedentary behavior was\n30% to 35%. Genetic effects on these factors were similar\n(although somewhat lower) in young adulthood, except for\ngenetic effect on BMI (estimated to be 50%).\nThe transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical\nlife course stage, reflecting a phenomenal jump in obesity\nrisk (1). These results illustrate important environmental\ninfluences on weight gain, PA, and dietary characteristics\nduring the transition to adulthood, particularly highlighting\nthe substantial role that household and physical environ-\nments play in establishing healthful behavior patterns that\ncan persist even after young adults have established new\nhouseholds that are independent of their parents and family.\nThese findings underscore the increasing need for obesity\nprevention strategies aimed at the household environment in\nchildhood and adolescence.\n"
