In addition,\nthe possible moderating effects of age and gender have not been comprehensively examined. The\ngoals of this study were to clarify: (i) how depressive symptoms affect the levels and trajectory of\nalcohol use-related problems, (ii) how alcohol use-related problems affect the levels and trajectory\nof depressive symptoms, and (iii) whether there are differences in these associations at different\npoints in development or between males and females.\nMethods: Participants for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (AddHealth) data set, a community-based sample of 20,728 adolescents fol-\nlowed from adolescence through early adulthood. Multilevel models were used to assess how each\nproblem affected the level and rate of change in the other problem over time; gender was consid-\nered as a possible moderator of these associations.\nResults: The results indicated that alcohol use-related problems and depressive symptoms had\nreciprocal, positive associations with each other during the period from early adolescence through\nearly adulthood; however, these effects differed somewhat by gender and age. High levels of\ndepressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels of alcohol problems (particularly\namong females), as well as faster increases in alcohol problems over time among males. High lev-\nels of alcohol problems were associated with higher initial levels of depressive symptoms (particu-\nlarly among females), as well as less curvature in the slope of depressive symptoms so that\nalthough there was a large difference between people with high and low depressive symptoms in\nearly adolescence, by early adulthood the difference was smaller (particularly among females).\nConclusions: These results highlight the importance of examining gender and age in studies on\nthe associations between affective disorders and substance use disorders.\nKey Words: Alcohol, Depression, Comorbidity, Longitudinal, Adolescence.\nF OR DECADES, THEORISTS and researchers have\ndiscussed associations between depression and alcohol\nuse disorders (e.g., Zucker, 1986) and recent commentaries\nhave noted the need for research on the relation between alco-\nhol use disorders and mood disorders (e.g., Li et al., 2004).\nHowever, the results of empirical studies on the nature of this\nassociation have been inconsistent. These inconsistencies may\nbe due, in part, to the fact that different studies use samples\nthat vary in their gender and age composition. This study\nexamined the longitudinal associations between alcohol prob-\nlems and depressive symptoms in a community-based sample\nof youth. By using an analytic approach that examined\nwithin-person trajectories of change over time (i.e., how levels\nof 1 problem predicted both level and rate of change of the\nother problem) it provides a unique angle on these associa-\ntions across the period from early adolescence through early\nadulthood. It also adds to the existing literature by reporting\ncross-sectional correlations between continuous measures\nof depressive symptoms and alcohol use-related problems\nfrom early adolescence through early adulthood in a single\ncommunity-based sample.\nPrevious Research on Alcohol Problems and Depression\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) has long been linked to\nalcohol use disorders [here, these disorders are considered\ntogether with depressive symptoms and alcohol use-related\nproblems due to evidence that levels of these symptoms fall\non a continuum in the population (e.g., Hankin et al., 2005;\nHasin et al., 2006)]. These 2 problems have been discussed\ntogether for theoretical reasons, with the concept of ``negative\naffect alcoholism'' dating back several decades (see Zucker,\n1986 for a discussion of this). Alcohol (or other substances)\nmay be used by people with depressive feelings to help them\ncope (``self-medication''); substance use may be especially\nreinforcing for depressed people because it can decrease\nFrom the Rutgers University, Camden, New Jersey.\nReprint requests:  , PhD, Rutgers University,\nrutgers.edu\nCopyright \u00d3 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.\nAlcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research Vol. 33, No. 1\nnegative feelings. In turn, alcohol problems may predispose\npeople to depression, either through physiological effects of\nheavy substance use or because the consequences of problem\nuse (e.g., family problems, school or work problems) may be\ndepressing. Alternatively, both depression and alcohol prob-\nlems may be different expressions of an underlying risk factor\n(such as difficulty with emotion regulation, poor family rela-\ntionships, etc.), a shared comorbid condition, or a shared\ngenetic diathesis (Nurnberger et al., 2002). Evidence has sup-\nported both models that emphasize the likelihood that alcohol\nproblems and depression act as risk factors for each other (see\nSwendsen and Merikangas, 2000 for a review) and models\nthat support the potential shared neurobiological underpin-\nEvidence is conflicting regarding the temporal association\nbetween depression and alcohol problems. Some studies have\nfound that depression predicts alcohol problems (e.g., Abra-\nham and Fava, 1999), whereas others have found that alcohol\nproblems (or substance problems in general--including illicit\ndrug-related problems) predict depression (e.g., Bovasso,\nhave found a reciprocal association: that depressive disorders\npredict substance problems and substance problems predict\nimportant to note that for each of these patterns, there are\nalso negative findings--findings that 1 problem does not\npredict the other over time.\nThere are several potential factors that could account for\nthese discrepant findings. First, these associations may differ\nby age. Among studies that include frequent assessments,\nthere is some indication of more reciprocal prediction (depres-\nsion predicting substance abuse and the reverse) in early to\nmid-adolescence (Stice et al., 2004; in univariate analyses pre-\ndicting the onset of each problem by the other problem) than\nin late adolescence to early adulthood (Rao et al., 2000). Sev-\neral other studies are consistent with the notion of closer asso-\nciations between these problems among younger people: (1) a\nretrospective study indicated that adolescent-onset substance\nuse disorders (SUD--abuse and dependence) may be more\nstrongly related to depression than adult-onset SUD (Clark\net al., 1998); (2) a prospective study found that persistent\ninternalizing problems predicted persistent substance use in\npreadolescence, but the same was not true during adolescence\n(Loeber et al., 1999); and (3) in the same sample, the level of\ndepression among 13-year-olds was associated with concur-\nrent level of alcohol use but did not predict change in alcohol\nuse over time (White et al., 2001). It is not clear whether the\npossible closer associations between SUD and depression\namong younger people are related to aspects of the disorders\nor developmental periods themselves or whether early-onset\ncases represent more severe variants, which would make it\nmore likely that people with early-onset cases had either par-\nticularly strong genetic predispositions (to both problems or\nto a neurobiological factor that increased risk for both prob-\nlems, such as difficulties with emotion regulation) or particu-\nlarly noxious environments (e.g., severe abuse; Clark et al.,\n2003). Adolescent-onset depression does predict risk for later\ndepression and impaired functioning (Weissman et al., 1999)\nand early-onset binge drinking does predict later alcohol\nabuse and dependence (Chassin et al., 2002), although\nwhether these increased risks carry over to increased risk for\nother problems remains an open question.\nSecond, these associations may differ by gender. Several\nstudies have found that the link between depression and sub-\nstance problems is stronger in females than males (Bukstein\nsome contradictory evidence exists (Costello et al., 1999;\nHenry et al., 1993), and several studies have found that associ-\nations between depression and substance problems are similar\nfor males and females (e.g., Hettema et al., 2003; Marmor-\nnal studies, no clear pattern has emerged, although it is\npossible that SUD may more commonly precede MDD in\nmales, while MDD may be equally likely to precede or follow\nThird, these associations may differ by type of substance\n(alcohol vs. illicit drugs), although there is limited evidence to\nsupport this notion. Of the prospective studies discussed\nabove, the 1 that examined adolescent alcohol use disorders\nfound that they predicted later MDD (Rohde et al., 2001);\nsimilarly, the one that focused on drug use disorders found\nthat cannabis abuse predicted later depression among adults\n(Bovasso, 2001). Retrospective studies do not indicate any\nclear difference in patterns between alcohol and illicit drugs\nevidence to conclusively state whether these associations differ\nby type of substance.\nFourth, there may be a difference in associations between\ndepression and substance problems when diagnoses versus\nsymptoms are considered. However, no clear pattern based on\nthis distinction emerges in the literature to date. When SUD\nand depressive diagnoses are considered, some evidence\npoints to SUD predicting depressive disorders (Bukstein\nis also evidence of reciprocal prediction (Clark et al., 1997;\nexamined depressive and substance-related symptoms, but the\nevidence from those also tends to point to substance-related\nsymptoms predicting depressive symptoms [Bovasso, 2001;\nStice et al., 2004 (which examined substance-related symp-\ntoms as predictors of the onset of depressive pathology)]. This\nsimilar pattern of results is not surprising, given that depres-\nsion and substance-related problems occur on continua in the\nFifth, these associations may differ based on whether the\nsamples were recruited from clinics or from the community.\nHowever, no clear pattern based on sample origin emerges.\nClinic samples have yielded results indicating that depression\npredicts alcohol problems (Abraham and Fava, 1999), that\nsubstance problems predicts depression (Bukstein et al.,\n1992), and that there is a reciprocal association between the 2\nsamples have yielded results indicating that substance prob-\nprocal relation between the 2 problems (Hettema et al., 2003;\nSwendsen et al., 1998). The lack of community-based studies\nfinding unidirectional effects from depression to substance\nproblems may not reflect a true lack of effect, although, since\nmultiple community-based studies have found reciprocal\nrelations between the 2 problems.\nCurrent Study\nThe goals of this study were to clarify: (1) how depressive\nsymptoms predict the levels and trajectory of alcohol use-\nrelated problems, (2) how alcohol use-related problems pre-\ndict the levels and trajectory of depressive symptoms, and (3)\nwhether there are differences in these associations at different\npoints in development or between males and females. The\nperiod from early adolescence through early adulthood was\nconsidered, and a community-based sample of youth was\nused to avoid the biases associated with treatment-seeking\npopulations.\nA multilevel modeling approach was used. Simple variable-\ncentered prospective analyses, in which a variable at 1 point\nin time is used to predict another variable at a later point in\ntime, have traditionally been used but are limited in several\nways. For example, only 2 assessment points can be exam-\nined. Also, if the sample is a single uniform age, these studies\ncan only tell us about the relation between the variables at the\n2 assessment ages; if the sample includes youth of different\nages, important developmental differences may be masked.\nThus, for developmentally focused research, multilevel model-\ning has significant advantages. This approach first determines\ntypical trajectories of each type of problem over this time per-\niod, then examines how each problem relates to increases or\ndecreases in the level and rate of change of the other problem\nwithin individuals. Potential gender differences were assessed\nby entering gender into the model as another possible predic-\ntor of trajectories. By examining the shape of these trajecto-\nries over time and the effects of each problem on the slope of\nthe trajectories, the possibility that these associations differed\nat different ages/developmental stages was examined.\nHypotheses were developed based on both theoretical rea-\nsons (the self-medication model of substance abuse and the\npossibility that heavy substance use may cause physiological\nand/or psychosocial consequences that increase risk for\ndepression) and empirical evidence supporting reciprocal\npathways between depression and alcohol problems. Overall,\nit was expected that higher levels of depressive symptoms\nwould be associated with both higher levels of alcohol use-\nrelated problems and faster increases in alcohol use-related\nproblems over time. Reciprocally, it was expected that higher\nlevels of alcohol use-related problems would relate to both\nhigher levels of depressive symptoms and faster increases in\ndepressive symptoms over time. It was tentatively expected\nthat, if gender differences were found, associations between\nthe 2 problems would be stronger for females, compared with\nmales. It was also expected that, if developmental differences\nwere found, the reciprocal effects of these problems would be\nstronger among younger, compared with older, youth.\nIn addition to these analyses addressing the effect of each\nproblem on the trajectory of the other problem, we also\nreport cross-sectional correlations between these problems at\neach age, by gender. These analyses allow for an examination\nof developmental trends in the concurrent associations\nbetween alcohol use-related problems and depressive\nsymptoms.\nParticipants\nParticipants for this study were drawn from the restricted-use con-\ntractual data set of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (AddHealth) data set (Udry, 2003). The Rutgers University\nInstitutional Review Board approved the data analysis project pre-\na stratified, random sample of students from high schools in the Uni-\nted States; the high schools were stratified into clusters based on\nregion, urbanicity, size of school, type of school, percentage of school\nthat was white, percentage of school that was black, span of grades\nincluded in the school, and type of curriculum the school offered.\nParticipating high schools then identified middle schools or junior\nhigh schools that contributed at least 5 students to the entering class\nof the high school; students from 1 feeder school per high school were\nselected for inclusion in this study. Students from 145 middle, junior\nhigh, and high schools participated in this initial phase of data collec-\ntion. Next, in-home interviews were completed with a core sample\nfrom each community as well as participants from some ``saturated\nschools'' (schools in which all students were included in the in-home\nsample) and over-samples of some special populations (adolescents\nwith limb disabilities, black participants from well-educated families,\nChinese, Cuban, and Puerto Rican adolescents, and adolescents\nresiding with other genetically related or nonrelated adolescents in\nthe sample). Mothers of these in-home interview participants were\nat this assessment and were most likely receiving special education\nservices or were learning English as a second language]. Approxi-\nmately 1 year later (1996), in-home follow-up interviews (wave 2)\nrange = 11 to 23); adolescents who were no longer in high school\n(i.e., participants who were in 12th grade at wave 1) were not\nfollowed-up at this time. Approximately 6 years after the initial\ninvited to participate in in-home interviews again (wave 3); 73% of\ntional information regarding the design of this study can be found in\nAt wave 1, participants in this study were a mean age of 15.66\nAfrican-American, 8% were Asian-American or Pacific Islander, 4%\nwere Native American, and 61% were Caucasian. In addition, 17%\nwere Hispanic or Latino. About 82% of mothers had graduated\nfrom high school or gotten their GED, and 23% of mothers had\ngraduated from college by the time of the wave 1 assessment. Moth-\ners reported that 9.7% of families were receiving some form of public\nassistance (such as welfare).\nand 77.4% at wave 3. To assess for the possibility of differential attri-\ntion, participants who completed both the wave 1 and wave 3 assess-\nments were compared with participants who completed the wave 1\nassessment only on levels of depressive symptoms and alcohol prob-\nlems (wave 2 was not included in this analysis since participants who\nhad graduated from high school between wave 1 and wave 2 were\nintentionally not assessed at wave 2). There were no differences in\nlevels of wave 1 depressive symptoms between these groups\nbut this effect seemed to be related to the higher levels of wave 3 non-\nresponse among older participants (who were more likely to have\nhad alcohol problems at wave 1, due to being in late, as opposed to\nearly, adolescence). Specifically, mean levels of wave 1 alcohol prob-\nlems among participants who did and did not participate at wave 3\nwere similar when participants of similar ages were examined [e.g.,\nwhen wave 3 participants and nonparticipants who were 12 to 13\nand 17 to 18 at wave 1 were compared separately, there were no dif-\nferences in alcohol problems between the groups (t = )1.44,\nMeasures\nDepressive Symptoms. Nine depression-related questions, drawn\nfrom the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale\n(CES-D; Radloff, 1977), were asked of participants at all 3 assess-\nments. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (never/rarely, some-\ntimes, a lot of the time, most of the time/all of the time), resulting in\na scale ranging from 0 to 27 (actual maximum score = 27). The par-\nticipants were instructed to report on symptoms they may have had\nduring the past week. The mean total score (across all waves and\nages) was 5.55 (SD = 4.26); among people who had used alcohol at\nized Cronbach's alpha coefficients for this scale ranged from 0.80 at\nthe first assessment to 0.81 at the third assessment. Although this was\na shorter scale than that used at waves 1 and 2 and previously shown\nto have considerable validity (e.g., Rende et al., 2006; Steuber and\nBanner, 2006), it correlated highly with the longer scale that was\n2). The CES-D has been shown to be strongly associated with diag-\nnoses of major depression in other community-based samples of\nadolescents (e.g., Prescott et al., 1998).\nAlcohol Use-Related Problems. Seven questions regarding\nalcohol use-related problems were asked of participants at all 3\nassessments. Each asked about the participant's frequency during\nthe past 12 months of experiencing various types of problems that\nmay occur as a result of alcohol use (e.g., ``...you've had prob-\nlems at school or with school work because you had been drink-\ning''; ``...you had problems with your friends because you had\nbeen drinking''). All items were either developmentally appropriate\nat all ages (e.g., gotten into a physical fight due to drinking) or\nwere modified to be developmentally appropriate (e.g., the item\nabove relating to problems with school or school work was chan-\nged at wave 3 to reflect problems with school or work). Each\nitem was rated on a 5-point scale (ranging from ``never'' to ``5 or\nmore times''), resulting in a scale ranging from 0 to 35 (actual\nmaximum score = 28). The mean score (across all waves and\nhad used alcohol at least 2 to 3 times, the mean score was 2.82\ncoefficients for this scale ranged from 0.74 at the first assessment\nto 0.76 at the third assessment. Scores on this measure were log-\ntransformed due to skew.\nGender. The biological sex of each participant was recorded\nwhen demographic information was collected during the first assess-\nment. Males were coded zero and females were coded 1.\nAge. The age of each participant was recorded at the time of\neach assessment.\nStatistical Analyses\nPrior to analyses being conducted, each participant's score on each\nmeasure at each assessment wave was converted to a score at each\nage he or she was assessed. This resulted in a data structure in which\neach participant contributed data at his or her set of 3 ages (e.g., ages\nFirst, means and standard deviations for depressive symptoms and\nalcohol use-related problems were computed for participants at each\nage. Then, cross-sectional Pearson correlations between these prob-\nlems were computed for males and females separately at each age.\nMultilevel models for predicting change were used to investigate\nthe effect of depressive symptoms on alcohol use problem trajecto-\nries over time and the effect of alcohol use problems on depressive\ntrajectories over time. This method is functionally the same as\ngrowth curve modeling or mixed effects models (e.g., Singer, 1998).\nModels were estimated using PROC MIXED in the Statistical\nAnalysis System (SAS) version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).\nFull information maximum likelihood estimation (ML) was used\nto compare directly the fit of nested models to the data and to use\nall available data, given the presence of missing observations,\nwhich were treated as missing at random (Singer and Willett,\n2003). Both the likelihood ratio test (LRT; comparing the )2 log\nlikelihood of nested models) and the Bayesian Information Crite-\nrion (BIC) were used to assess model fit (Singer and Willett, 2003).\nFirst, unconditional growth models for alcohol use-related prob-\nlems (dependent variable) were estimated and investigated to examine\nwhether a linear or quadratic model best fit the data. Then, the\npotential influence of gender on alcohol problems was investigated\nby entering gender as a time-invariant predictor. Next, depressive\nsymptoms at each time point (a time-varying predictor) were added\nto the model to examine whether depressive symptoms, alone or in\ncombination with gender, affected the trajectory of alcohol problems\nover time. The final model was determined by examining both the\npattern of significance of the predictors and the fit statistics of the\nmodels.\nNext, analogous models were estimated using depressive symp-\ntoms as the dependent variable and age, gender, and alcohol use-\nrelated problems as predictor variables. Briefly, models including: (1)\na linear slope, (2) a quadratic slope, (3) slope terms plus gender, and\n(4) slope terms, gender, and alcohol problems were examined.\nInitially, participants who reported not having a drink of alcohol\n>2 or 3 times in their lives and never drinking outside the family\nwere assigned a score of 0 on the measure of alcohol problems. After\nthese primary analyses, all analyses were re-run including only partic-\nipants who reported having had alcohol at least 2 to 3 times in their\nlives to examine whether the associations were similar in the entire\nsample and in the subsample of alcohol users.\nThese analyses resulted in models in which main effects of each\npredictor reflected the influence of the predictor on the initial level\nof the dependent variable, while the interaction effects of the pre-\ndictors with the slope terms indicated how, at each age, the predic-\ntor variable deflected the individual's score on the dependent\nvariable off of the typical developmental trajectory. In models of\nthis type, if the association between these problems remained the\nsame at different ages, that would be indicated by a nonsignificant\ninteraction between the independent variable (alcohol problems or\ndepression) and the term(s) in the equation that represented slope\n(linear and/or quadratic). In contrast, a significant interaction\nbetween the independent variable and slope term(s) would indicate\nthat the effect of the predictor varied at different points in develop-\nment. The intercepts and slopes are estimated independently, so\nwhile earlier levels of the dependent variable are not statistically\n``controlled for,'' the estimate of initial values is separated from the\nestimate of change over time.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nMeans and standard deviations for depressive symptoms\nand alcohol use-related problems are presented in Table 1.\nDepressive symptoms peaked at age 17 and alcohol problems\nPearson correlation coefficients representing the cross-\nsectional associations between depressive symptoms and\nalcohol use-related problems are also presented in Table 1.\nInspection of these values indicates that for males, there\ntended to be a curvilinear pattern of these correlation coeffi-\ncients, with them tending to be fairly low in early adolescence\nand the mid-20s and higher in between (with a peak at age\n16). In contrast, in females, these correlation coefficients were\nhighest in early adolescence and then tended to decrease over\ntime. These patterns indicate that (1) the cross-sectional asso-\nciations between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems\nchanged with age, and (2) these associations showed different\npatterns in males and females. Therefore, we next examined\nthe influence of each problem on the trajectory of the other\nproblem over time, considering gender as a possible modera-\ntor of these associations.\nTrajectories of Alcohol Use-Related Problems\nParameter estimates, along with standard errors, the signifi-\ncance levels of t-values associated with each parameter esti-\nmate, and fit statistics for all models, are presented in Table 2.\nUnconditional Growth Model. First, a linear growth\nmodel was fit to the data. As expected, it indicated that alco-\nhol problems tended to increase with increasing age (linear\nslope = 0.0310). A quadratic model provided a significantly\nbetter fit to the data than the linear model (LRT: differ-\nmodel was retained for future analyses. The negative value of\nthe quadratic term indicated that with each squared value of\nage, the rate of change in the slope slowed, resulting in a slope\nthat increased more steeply in adolescence and less steeply in\nearly adulthood.\nModel Including Gender as a Predictor. Next, gender\nwas entered as a time-invariant predictor. The model includ-\ning gender fit the data significantly better than the uncondi-\ntional growth model (LRT: difference = 280.0, df = 4,\np < 0.001). Parameter estimates indicated that although\nfemales had slightly higher initial levels of alcohol problems,\nmales experienced a steeper increase in alcohol problems over\ntime than females did.\nModel Including Depressive Symptoms and Gender as\nPredictors (Full Model). Next, depressive symptoms were\nadded to the model as a time-varying predictor. The model\nincluding gender along with depressive symptoms fit the data\nsignificantly better than the model including only gender as a\nTable 1.

Mean numbers of depressive symptoms differed (p < 0.05) between males and\nfemales at all ages except age 26. Mean numbers of alcohol problems differed (p < 0.05) between males and females at all ages except 12, 16,\nand 26. Correlations between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems differed (p < 0.05) between males and females at ages 12, 13, 14,\n*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Values are expressed as mean (SD). Only ages at which there were at least 100 participants assessed\nare included in this table.\nExamination of the parameter estimates indicated that\ndepressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels\nof alcohol problems, especially for females. There was also a\ntrend-level (p = 0.08) interaction effect of gender and depres-\nsive symptoms on the linear slope such that males with higher\nlevels of depressive symptoms experienced more rapid (stee-\nper) increases in their alcohol problems than did females.\nFinal Model. In an attempt to find a model that provided\na good fit to the data yet was parsimonious, first, all terms from\nthe full model that were not significant at the p < 0.05 level\nwere removed. However, this model provided a significantly\nless-good fit to the data (LRT: difference = 261.5, df = 4,\np < 0.001). Therefore, all terms except those relating to the\nquadratic slope were retained. This model provided a good fit\nthe BIC was smaller for this model, indicating a better fit).\nThis final model indicated that initial levels of depressive\nsymptoms were associated with higher initial levels of alcohol\nproblems, especially for females. However, males overall, and\nespecially males with high levels of depressive symptoms, had\na faster rate of growth in their alcohol-related problems, com-\npared with females or males with low levels of depression.\nA prototypical plot of this model is depicted in Fig. 1.

A quadratic model pro-\nvided a significantly better fit to the data than the linear\np < 0.001). Therefore, the quadratic model was retained for\nfuture analyses.\nModel Including Gender as a Predictor. Gender was\nnext entered as a time-invariant predictor. The model includ-\ning gender fit the data significantly better than the uncondi-\ntional growth model (LRT: difference = 771.9, df = 4,\np < 0.001).

Next, alcohol problems\nwere added to the model as a time-varying predictor. The\nmodel including gender along with alcohol problems fit the\ndata significantly better than the model including only gender\np < 0.001). Examination of the parameter estimates indi-\ncated that early alcohol problems were associated with higher\ninitial levels of depressive symptoms, especially for females.\nHowever, depressive symptoms increased most rapidly for\nmales with high levels of alcohol problems--that is, males\nwith high levels of alcohol problems were especially likely to\nbe increasing (or decreasing less than other participants) in\ntheir depressive symptoms at any given point in time. In addi-\ntion, alcohol problems were associated with less curvature in\nTable 2.

For analyses using alcohol problems to predict depres-\nsive symptoms, the quadratic terms were not significant;\ntherefore, the best-fitting model included only the intercept\nand linear slope terms.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study indicate that alcohol use-related\nproblems and depressive symptoms have reciprocal, positive\nassociations with each other during the period from early\nadolescence through early adulthood; however, these effects\ndiffer somewhat by gender and age. Overall, higher levels of\ndepressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels\nof alcohol problems (particularly among females), as well as\nfaster increases in alcohol problems over time among males.\nReciprocally, high levels of alcohol problems were associated\nwith higher initial levels of depressive symptoms (particularly\namong females); however, while the trajectory of depressive\nsymptoms among participants overall was curvilinear, high\nlevels of alcohol problems were associated with less curvature\nin the slope of depressive symptoms over time (particularly\namong females), so although there was a large effect of alco-\nhol problems in early adolescence, that effect was smaller by\nearly adulthood.\nCross-sectional correlations between depressive symptoms\nand alcohol problems at each age illustrate these trends in a\ndifferent way. These correlation coefficients showed a curvi-\nlinear pattern among males, being fairly low in early adoles-\ncence and the mid-20s and higher in between. Among\nfemales, these correlation coefficients were highest in early\nadolescence and tended to decrease over time. These findings\ncomplement the longitudinal findings summarized previously\nby illustrating that in early adolescence, there were closer\nassociations between these 2 problems among females, while\nlater in development this was not the case.\nThere are many possible explanations for these longitudinal\nassociations between depressive symptoms and alcohol prob-\nlems. As noted by Swendsen and Merikangas (2000), it is\nlikely that there are multiple pathways leading to comorbidity\nbetween these problems, and the population of individuals\nwith both problems is probably quite heterogeneous. Some\nsupport for a common genetic diathesis has been found (e.g.,\napparent shared genetic risk may actually be due to the\ngenetic risk for antisocial personality disorder, which is fre-\nquently comorbid with both depression and alcohol depen-\ndence (Fu et al., 2002). Research integrating an examination\nFig. 2. Longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms, by gender and level of alcohol use-related problems. The trajectories referring to participants\nwith low alcohol problems refer to participants at the 25th percentile of alcohol problems; those referring to high alcohol problems refer to participants at the\n75th percentile of alcohol problems. This figure is derived from analyses including all study participants (n = 20,728).\nof antisocial behavior along with depression and alcohol\nproblems would be useful in teasing apart whether this joint\ncomorbidity accounts for the apparent association between\ndepression and alcohol problems. There are several ways in\nwhich neurobiological factors may link these disorders, and\nbased on evidence from animal studies, substance use in ado-\nlescence may have more effects on the brain than substance\nuse in adulthood (see Rao, 2006 for a review)--which could\nresult in more risk for depression stemming from heavy alco-\nhol use in adolescence, compared with heavy alcohol use in\nadulthood. Evidence also indicates that physical and sexual\nabuse may predispose adolescents to both depression and\nalcohol use disorders (Clark et al., 2003). In addition, it seems\nlikely that each disorder influences risk for the other, whether\nbecause people sometimes drink heavily to cope with negative\nfeelings or because the problems that go along with having an\nalcohol use disorder (e.g., social and occupational impair-\nment) also are stressors that can precipitate a depressive\nepisode.\nThe findings of the current study regarding the interactive\nassociations between gender and age on associations between\nalcohol problems and depression are somewhat consistent\nwith the existing literature. Two previous studies also found\nclose associations between substance problems and depres-\nsion-related problems in early adolescence, although these\nstudies used a sample of boys only (i.e., Loeber et al., 1999;\nfound that internalizing problems predicted substance use\nmore strongly during pre-adolescence than during adoles-\ncence, and White and colleagues (2001) also reported that\ndepressive symptoms were associated with alcohol use in early\nadolescence. Some studies of both genders that found closer\nassociations between these problems among girls compared\nwith boys used mid-adolescent samples [13 to 18 in Bukstein\net al. (1992)], and studies reporting no gender differences used\nmid-adolescent through adulthood samples [17 in Marmor-\nThe reasons for these gender differences are unclear. In\nearly adolescence, rates of depression among girls increase at\na markedly faster rate than among boys (e.g., Hankin et al.,\n1998); perhaps young girls are more likely to self-medicate\ntheir depressive symptoms by drinking alcohol, or perhaps\nsome girls become depressed because they are either drinking\nor engaging in behaviors that may be associated with drinking\n(e.g., spending time with delinquent peers). Reciprocally, in\nearly adulthood females may stop drinking heavily earlier\nthan males (e.g., Labouvie, 1996), so depression may become\nless associated with alcohol problems among young women\nduring that time period. Future research using more closely-\nspaced assessments and examining other potential mediating\nand moderating factors would be useful in explaining this\npattern of associations.\nThis study confirms that clinicians should be aware that\nyouth experiencing high levels of depression or alcohol-\nrelated problems are at risk for the development of the other\nproblem. Given the prominence of the ``self-medication''\nmodel of alcoholism, clinicians should be especially alert to\nthe other direction of risk--alcohol problems predicting\ndepression. These links are especially striking among early\nadolescent girls, so clinicians treating 1 of these problems\namong this group should make sure to assess and continually\nmonitor clients for the development of the other problem.\nThe cross-sectional correlations between these problems were\nsomewhat less strong for women in early adulthood and for\nmales in both early adolescence and early adulthood, so clini-\ncians working with these age groups may be less likely to find\nthese associations in their clients.\nThere were several limitations of this study. The measures\nof depressive symptoms and alcohol problems were continu-\nous; clinically significant syndromes were not examined.\nTherefore, it is not clear how these would apply to people\nwith major depressive disorder or with alcohol abuse or\ndependence. Also, studies examining associations between\nthese problems are complicated by the differing natures of\ndepression and alcohol problems: specifically, depression is\nconceived of as an episodic disorder, while alcohol problems\n(particularly dependence) are relatively more stable (although\nindividuals can have waxing and waning symptoms). In this\nstudy, depressive symptoms were assessed using a measure\nthat asked about experiences during the past week; in con-\ntrast, alcohol problems were assessed using a measure that\nasked about experiences during the past 12 months. There-\nfore, problems that occurred at times other than the assess-\nment windows for depressive symptoms and alcohol\nproblems were missed, and problems that appeared to be con-\ncurrent could actually have reflected alcohol problems that\npreceded depressive symptoms within a single year. Cases in\nwhich depressive symptoms preceded (or occurred together\nwith) alcohol problems but remitted by the week before the\nassessment would have been missed. Although unfortunate\nfor analytic purposes, these differing assessment time frames\nmay be appropriate given differences in memory for these\nproblems. For example, a youth who had problems in school\ndue to drinking in the past year would be likely to remember\nthat event (e.g., being suspended), while a youth who felt sad\n(but was not severely depressed) in the past year may not\nremember that more transient feeling. Finally, due to the\nwave 1 sampling strategy, these participants may not have\nbeen completely representative of adolescents in the United\nStates (e.g., home-schooled adolescents and incarcerated ado-\nlescents were not included); the results cannot be generalized\nto the population of adolescents in the United States. Future\nresearch examining whether associations between these prob-\nlems are similar in people from different racial/ethnic back-\ngrounds and different socioeconomic strata would be useful.\nThis study contributed to our understanding of associa-\ntions between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems\nin several ways. Its use of a sample whose ages spanned\nfrom early adolescence through early adulthood enabled us\nto examine associations across this entire developmental\nperiod and not just part of it (e.g., during adolescence).\nThis age span, combined with the fact that the sample\nincluded both males and females, allowed us to detect the\neffects of gender during different developmental periods.\nThe community-based nature of the sample allowed us to\navoid the biases associated with treatment-seeking or high-\nrisk samples. In addition, this study's use of a growth\ncurve analytic approach allowed for an examination of\nhow each problem was likely to affect the trajectory of the\nother problem within individuals. This approach differs\nfrom most studies that examine whether 1 variable pre-\ndicts another variable at a later time point and, therefore,\nprovides a unique and informative perspective on the\nissue of how depressive and alcohol problems relate\nlongitudinally.\nThe results of this study indicate that both gender and\ndevelopmental stage are crucial factors to consider in examin-\nations of associations between depressive symptoms and alco-\nhol use-related problems. Although each type of problem\ntended to be associated with both increased levels of and\nincreased growth in the other problem, the initial associations\nwere stronger among females but growth in each problem\nwas predicted more strongly among males. Future research\nexamining the mechanisms behind these findings would be\nuseful in developing effective prevention and treatment pro-\ngrams for adolescents and young adults with depressive\nand/or alcohol use-related problems.\n"
