    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough noodles occupy an important place in the dietary lives of Americans, up until the present time research and in-depth data on the noodle\nconsumption patterns of the US population have been very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the food consumption and diet patterns\nof noodle consumers and non-consumers according to age, gender, income, and ethnicity. The 2001-2002 NHANES databases were used. The NHANES\nAccording to the results, the mean noodle consumption was 304.1 g/day/person, with 334.3 g for males and 268.0 g for females. By age, the intake\nAlso, according to income, the intake amount for the middle-income level (PIR 1~1.85) of consumers was highest at 312.5 g. Noodle intake also\nshowed different patterns by ethnicity in which the \"other\" ethnic group consumed the most noodles with 366.1 g, followed by, in order, Hispanics\nwith 318.7 g, Whites with 298.6 g, and Blacks with 289.5 g. After comparing food consumption by dividing the subjects into noodle consumers\nand non-consumers, the former was more likely to consume milk, fish, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages while the latter preferred\nmeat, poultry, bread, and non-alcohol beverages.\n",

Growth in the\ndomestic food use of wheat has accelerated during the last two\ndecades and wheat flour is used to produce noodles. The U.S.\nmarket for pasta and noodles increased at a compound annual\npasta/noodles category led the pasta and noodles market,\nJapanese style (e.g., udon) and Chinese-type noodles (e.g.,\nramen) as well as spaghetti are frequently consumed in restaurants\nand at home. However, the effects of noodle consumption on\nthe diet patterns and eating habits of Americans have not been\nstudied in detail.\nExamining patterns of food group consumption has emerged\nas an important focal point for understanding the role of diet\nin disease risk [2-4]. Instead of determining single nutrients,\nstratifying the food groups is more likely to reflect habitual food\nintake, and embody characteristics of the total dietary intake\n[2,4,5], and embody characteristics of the total diet, including\nall nutrient interactions.\nHowever, in the case of noodles, little is known about noodle\nconsumption patterns and the contribution that noodle provide\nin the American diet. Dietary patterns and food groups reflect\ndifferent ethnic eating traditions [5]. Mediterranean and Asian\ndiets are widely known to incorporate higher intakes of legumes,\nfish, vegetables, and fruits, contrasted with the American dietary\npattern consisting of higher intakes of deep-fried fast foods,\nrefined grains, processed meats, commercially baked products,\nand sweets. Understanding these ethnic differences in food group\nconsumption becomes increasingly significant in the United\nStates as the US Census Bureau has reported that, from 1990\nrepresent 13% of the total US population [6].\nBui and Small [7] analyzed the thiamin contents of white\nsalted, yellow alkaline, and instant noodles that were\nmanufactured differently. Fu [8] categorized noodle types by\nmanufacturing methods and Miskelly [9] studied the historical\naspects of noodles.\nNoodle studies have focused on manufacturing methods or\ncomposition analysis, or have been confined to food and cultural\nThis research was supported by grants from Nongshim Co.

It also offers analyses of\nnoodle consumers by income, race, and ethnicity. The primary\nobjective of the research was to gain a better understanding of\nnoodle consumption in the United States and whether consuming\nnoodles has a beneficial effect on total diet, in which they may\nplay a role in healthful eating. The contribution of economic,\nsocial, and demographic factors related to noodle consumption\nwere examined. The differences in noodle consumption by\nincome level and ethnic background provide insights into the\nfactors that affect food selection among these groups. The results\nprovide useful information for designing food programs and\nplanning national food supply strategies.\nSubjects and Methods\nData and procedures\nWe used data collected in the National Health and Nutrition\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. Each survey was a stratified,\nmultistage, national probability sample of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population of the United States. The subjects\ncollected dietary information with the use of a 24-h recall\nadministered by trained dietary interviewers, and the dietary\na computer-assisted dietary interview that included a 4-step\nmultiple pass approach. In NHANES 2002, the dietary data were\ncollected using a 5-step multiple pass approach with dietary recall\nmethods that are part of the integrated US Department of\nAgriculture and NHANES protocol \"What We Eat in America\"\nIdentification and classification of noodle consumers\nThe noodle consumers were identified and classified based on\nthe intake of noodles consumed in food items. Information from\nthe NHANES code book was used to identify foods that contained\nnoodles. Foods containing noodles, spaghetti, macaroni, and pasta\nwere included. Noodles from other sources (chicken noodle soup,\netc.) were not counted in the selection. The classification of\n\"noodle consumer\" was assigned to individuals who reported\neating noodles during one day, and other individuals were\nclassified as non-consumers.\nThe food groups were classified according to USDA food group\nclassifications and were regrouped as 38 food groups, including\nnoodles (noodles, macaroni, pasta, spaghetti) (Table 1).\nStatistical analysis\nWe examined the associations between noodle consumption\nvariables and socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age,\nincome, and ethnicity. All statistical analyses were adjusted for\nthe sample weights and the complex sample design of NHANES\nby using SAS (release 9.13, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and\nSUDAAN (release 10.1, Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) [31]. All data sets were weighted to be\nnationally representative and standard errors were calculated by\nTaylor linearization variance estimation. Comparison of noodle\nconsumption by gender was tested using t-tests, and Bonferroni\nmultiple t-tests were used to analyze the differences in noodle\nintake by several ethnicity and income groups.

When the\naverage amounts of consumption for the entire age ranges were\nconsidered, the ranking of noodles among the vast quantity intake\nfoodstuffs was 5th, which included noodles, macaroni, pasta, and\nspaghetti. The consumption amount of non-alcoholic beverages\nwas highest, followed by milk, alcoholic beverages, and fruit\njuices, in order (Table 2).\nof 2,035 individuals consumed noodles during the survey period.\nthat the noodle consumption frequency of females was higher\nthan that of males. The average amount of noodles consumed\nwas 304.1 g a day. The average amount of noodles consumed\nby the males was 344.3 g, which is significantly higher than\ntests; however, the relationships between gender and noodle\nconsumption patterns were not significant.\nAcross age groups, the highest noodle consumption was in 9-18\nthe highest ratio of noodle consumers was for those between\nconsumed the highest amounts of noodles. Except for the 1-8\nyear-old consumers, males had higher noodle consumption than\nfemales across all age levels, where those who were 9-18 years\nabove (P < 0.05) had significantly higher intakes compared to\nthe females (Table 3).\nTable 3 shows the ranking of quantitatively consumed food\ngroups by age.

In terms of quantity, non-alcoholic\nbeverages were the most highly consumed food group for both\nmen and woman. This was followed in the order of alcoholic\nbeverages, milk, and fruit juice for the men, and milk, fruit juice,\nand fruit for the women.\nAfter comparing the intakes of two age groups of consumers,\nthose under 18 years old and 19 years old and above, significant\nrelationships between age and noodle consumption (P < 0.0001)\nwere found. Comparisons across males and females separately\nalso resulted in significant relationships between age and noodle\nconsumption. In addition, when comparing intake levels among\nold and above, significant relationships between age and noodle\nconsumption (P < 0.0001) were found. Furthermore, comparisons\nacross age levels by dividing the subjects by gender revealed\nsignificant relationships between age and noodle consumption,\nexcept for those who were under 1 year old.\nIncome, ethnicity, and noodle intake\nIn order to examine the association between noodle consumption\nand the social/economic status, the PIR (Poverty Income Ratio)\nwas used. The PIR refers to the poverty level ratio (or poverty\nthreshold), which determines income or poverty. If PIR is 1.0,\nfor instance, it implies living at the poverty level, and if PIR\nis 0.5, it indicates a living status at half under the poverty level.\nAccording to the U.S Census Bureau, a PIR of 0.5 means\n\"severely poor\", and a PIR 1.25 means \"near poor\". In\naccordance with the U.S PIR standards, we distinguished the\n\"above 3.5\" to explore the rankings of food consumption by\nincome level. For PIRs below 3.5, noodle intake ranked 5th\nwithout notable differences among the three PIR categories. On\nthe other hand, in the higher income group with a PIR above\n3.5, noodle intake ranked 8th and showed differences from other\nthe three PIR groups. In the group with PIRs above 3.5, the\n5th and 6th ranked food groups were fruits and vegetables,\nrespectively, and the 8th was breads, rolls, pancakes, and waffles\n(Table 4).\nThe results of noodle intake by income showed that the ratio\nof noodle consumers was highest in the group with PIRs below\n1.0, but it was concluded that noodle consumption was not\nsignificantly related to income. The relationships between noodle\nintake amounts and income levels did not show consistent\nTable 6.

In order to examine\nnoodle consumption patterns by ethnicity, we categorized the\ngroups into Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,\nand others. After analyzing the food groups most consumed\naccording to ethnicity, noodles ranked at remarkably different\npositions (Table 6). Noodle intake ranked 8th for Hispanics, 6th\nfor non-Hispanic Whites and 5th for non-Hispanic Blacks and\nothers. Therefore, non-Hispanic Blacks and others consumed the\nmost noodles while Hispanics consumed the least. Different from\nthe other ethnic groups, ready-to-eat cereals ranked within the\ntop 10 most consumed foods in those classified as \"others\",\nwhereas the consumption of alcoholic beverages was less than\nthose of the other ethnic groups.\nThe ratios of noodle consumers and intake amounts by\nethnicity are shown in Table 7. The \"other\" ethnic group showed\nthe highest noodle intake amount with 366.1 g, followed by\nnon-Hispanic Blacks with 289.5 g. The average noodle intake\nsignificantly lower than 254.9 g for Hispanics' of the same age\n(P < 0.01). According to the chi-square test results, the\nrelationships between ethnicity and noodle intake were not\nsignificant.\nComparison of food consumption patterns between noodle\nconsumers and non-consumers\nAfter dividing the subjects by noodle consumers and\nnon-consumers, we compared food consumption amounts for the\n37 food groups for studying food group consumption pattern.\nBased on re-categorized foods, we analyzed additional food\nitems that noodles were consumed with, which showed a variety\nof ranges (Table 8). Those who ate only noodles without other\nfoods accounted for 64%, while the remaining 36% consumed\nnoodles with other foods. Those who dipped noodles in soup\nor mixed them with salad represented 3% and 2.5%, respectively.\nThe results also indicate that frozen meals, ready-to-eat cereals,\nsandwiches, dried beans and vegetables, bread/baked products,\nand tortilla products were added when consuming noodle.\nIn all age groups, the noodle consumers showed significantly\nhigher intakes of beef (P < 0.05), poultry (P < 0.05), sandwiches\ncereals (P < 0.05), grain mixtures (P < 0.01), white potatoes (P\nbeverages compared to the non-consumers.

In the noodle non-consumer group, those\nunder 18 years old consumed more food from all food groups.\nThe noodle non-consumers had significantly higher intakes of\nwith non-meat items (P < 0.01), ready-to-eat cereals (P < 0.05),\ngrain mixtures (P < 0.05), fruit juice (P < 0.05), and beverages\n(P < 0.01). The noodle consumers seemed to consume more milk,\nmeats, such as lamb, veal, game, and other meats, as well as\ntomatoes than the non-consumers (Table 10). In adults older than\n19 years of age, the noodle non-consumers ate significantly more\ngrain mixtures (P < 0.05), other fruits (P < 0.05), other vegetables\nconsumers had a tendency to consume more milk, yogurt, fish,\ncitrus fruit, and tomatoes (Table 11). From the results, the noodle\nconsumers consumed more milk, fish, and fruits, and the\nnon-consumers consumed more meat, legumes, breads, and\nbeverages.\nFood groups\nTotal Noodle Consumer Noodle Non-Consumer\nN Mean \u00b1 SE N Mean \u00b1 SE N Mean \u00b1 SE\n1) Difference = intake (Noodle Consumer - Noodle Non-Consumer)\n* Means are significantly different at  = 0.05 by t-test.\n** Means are significantly different at  = 0.01 by t-test.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides information on noodle consumption in the\nUnited States and shows similarities and differences in the dietary\nsources of those who consume noodles compared to those who\ndo not. The research focused on examining noodle consumers,\nunderstanding any differences in noodle consumption according\nto demographic factors, and analyzing how the food intake of\nnoodle consumers differed from that of non-noodle consumers.\nEven though noodles and ramen are not consumed frequently\nby all consumers in the United States, noodles are a main dietary\nsource, especially for some ethnic groups. Moreover, the noodle\nconsumers differed from the non-noodle consumers in their food\nintake. When the two groups were compared, the noodle\nconsumers showed food choices that contained more tomatoes\nand less beef, poultry, sandwiches, legumes, breads, ready-to-eat\ncereals, grain mixtures, white potatoes, and vegetable mixtures.\nWhile a causal relationship was not found, noodle consumption\nwas associated with the choice of other food groups that were\nconsumed with noodles.\nAge exerted a significant influence on noodle consumption,\nindicating that noodle intake may differ by demographic factors.\n250 Noodle consumption patterns of Americans\nFood groups\nTotal Noodle Consumer Noodle Non-Consumer\nN Mean \u00b1 SE N Mean \u00b1 SE N Mean \u00b1 SE\n1) Difference = intake (Noodle Consumer - Noodle Non-Consumer)\n* Means are significantly different at  = 0.05 by t-test.\n** Means are significantly different at  = 0.01 by t-test.\nNoodle intake also differed by ethnicity, showing cultural\nbackground to be an important factor for differences in food\ngroup intake and can affect the nutritional status of different\nethnic groups. There were significant differences between ethnic\ngroups in their rankings of the vast quantity intake foodstuffs\nas compared to other demographic factors such as gender, age,\nand PIR. Differences in noodle consumption among age and\nracial groups explain changes in both food preferences among\nthe age groups and the different populations. In the case of the\n\"other\" ethnic group, including Asians, noodles and ready-to-\neat-cereals held especially high rankings in the vast quantity\nintake foodstuffs. These results are due to Asian culture where\nnoodles are a staple food. There are, however, a number of\nproblems that remain to be explored. In this study, the source\nof data lacked accurate demographic information. NHANES data\nmake no distinction between \"other\" ethnic groups. Therefore,\nit is difficult to research the actual conditions of noodle intake\nin various racial and ethnic groups belonging to the \"other\"\ncategory. Another limitation of our analysis is there was no\nconsideration for eating location (at home or away from home).\nThe current study indicated that individuals consuming more\nnoodles showed higher consumption of tomatoes. It is probable\nthat the major sources of noodles are pasta and spaghetti. On\nthe other hand, the noodle consumers had a tendency of\nconsuming less amounts of vegetables, beans and domestic fowl\nas compared to those of non-noodle consumers. The inclusion\nof noodles in planning menus for school lunch programs or food\nassistance programs may further encourage the consumption of\na varied diet that contains more vegetables, legumes, poultry,\nand beef. In addition, noodle consumers may benefit from new\nrecipes in which noodles, particularly nutrient fortified noodles,\nare used in combination with vegetables and legumes. Finally,\nfurther research is necessary to examine shifts in noodle\nconsumption by passage of time and demographic factors.\nReferences\n1. PR-inside.comv [Internet].
