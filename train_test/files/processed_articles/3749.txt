Cultural norms underpin-\nning these intergenerational asset and wealth transfers (e.g.,\nthrough wills) are shifting due to social and demographic\nchanges (Sappideen, 2008). The impact on intergenerational\ntransfers of these major social and demographic changes as\nwell as the changes in levels of retirement income and asset\nsize and complexity has received limited attention. Family\nstructures are changing with increased acceptance of cohabi-\ntation, same sex relationships and shared parenthood, multi-\nple marriages, and blended and step families. Such changes\nto the traditional patterns of marriage and parenthood can\ncreate complexity regarding definitions of who is immediate\nfamily and hence the nature of testator and beneficiary obli-\ntransfers and estate planning are also more difficult due to\nuncertainty about policy changes to private and public pen-\nsions and the need to provide for potentially higher user\ncharges in health and aged care in later life. The transmission\nof multiple and large asset holdings, family businesses, and\nrural properties raises particular issues around sequencing\nand timing of asset transmission as well as principles under-\npinning distribution and transfer (Gaffney-Rhys & Jones,\ngration, Australia is increasingly a culturally diverse society.\nNorms and prescriptions in all cultures specify expectations\nregarding inheritance and expectations and practices around\nintergenerational transfers, reciprocity, and other societal\nobligations.\nIt is important that researchers, lawyers, policy makers,\nand legislators are cognizant of these changes and their\npotential to influence community expectations regarding\nasset transfer. Family provision legislation in Australian\nlegal jurisdictions reflects principles of reciprocity (i.e., a\nbeneficiary's deservingness based on the level of contact and\ncare they provided to the deceased) and need (i.e., a testator's\nresponsibility to provide for individuals based on their level\nof need; Sappideen, 2008). How well these laws work in bal-\nancing testamentary freedom with obligations to provide for\nfamily and broader expectations around inheritance and fam-\nily relationships is open to challenge. There is also emerging\nevidence that the number of will contests is growing\n(McGregor-Lowndes & Hannah, 2009).

These provisions may or may not fit\nthe needs of the increasingly complex range of family struc-\ntures and relationships and/or may result in inequity. For\nexample, assumptions about family support underpinning\nintestacy provisions do not necessarily fit all cultural groups\n(Vines, 2011). In the event of contestation of an intestate\nestate pursuant to family provision legislation, a court may\ndetermine, in accordance with the criteria in that legislation,\nto distribute the assets in a different way. This process can\ncause additional cost, inconvenience, and stress to families at\nwhat is already a difficult time.\nTo date, research has provided little consistent insight into\nthe reasons why some individuals die intestate. Knowing\nwho does not make a will and why is important in under-\nstanding changing practices and intentions. It is important to\nbetter understand the attitudinal, cultural, informational, and\nsystemic reasons why people do or do not make a will and\nuse of alternatives to a legally drafted will. Furthermore,\nunderstanding the range of attitudes toward will making is\nvital in enhancing methods of organizing, managing, and\nmarketing estate management and developing programs to\nincrease the prevalence of current and valid wills within the\nadult population. This article explores the prevalence of will\nmaking, identifies who are most and least likely to draft a\nwill, and what prompts people to make and change wills. It\nforms part of a larger project on the prevalence, patterns, and\npractices of wealth transfers through wills in Australia, the\nprinciples commonly underpinning this form of asset distri-\nbution and will contestation.\nBackground\nPrevalence and Predictors of Will Making or\nChanging\nThe proportion of adults reported to have a valid will at any\none point in time has varied markedly across research sam-\nples, time frames, and countries. For example,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In an online survey, 31% of a representative sample of\nAmerican respondents aged 19 or older (n = 324) had\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 37% of English and Welsh respondents aged 16 years\nand above who completed face-to-face surveys (n =\n1,556) had made a will (Douglas, Woodward,\nHumphrey, Mills, & Morrell, 2011; Humphrey, Mills,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 58% of a representative sample of Australian respon-\ndents aged 18 and above surveyed by telephone inter-\nview (n = 6,209) had made a will (Giving Australia,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 66% of a representative sample of American respon-\ndents aged 70 or older (n = 521), a subsample from the\nStudy of Aging and Health Dynamics (AHEAD), had\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 79% of Queensland (Australian) respondents (n =\n820) aged above 35 interviewed through a telephone\nsurvey had made a will (Wilson & Tilse, 2012)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 96% of Australian respondents aged above 50 (n =\n6,789) who completed a written questionnaire had\nResearch has been able to identify personal characteristics\nassociated with will makers, for example, older age\ngender (Baker & Gilding, 2011; Gaffney-Rhys & Jones,\n2013), being married or in a relationship (Humphrey etal.,\nhigh value estate (Dekker & Howard, 2006; Olsberg &\nWinters, 2005). There are, however, some conflicting find-\nings relating to whether being a parent (Wilson & Tilse, 2012)\nand having greater financial worth (State Trustees Limited,\nwill makers. There is less understanding of circumstances or\nevents that motivate an individual to prepare a will.

The authors\nfound that participants who had become widowed, diagnosed\nwith cancer, retired, or had increased their assets were most\nlikely to have made a will. A study of 41 men and women\nfrom different age cohorts and socio-economic situations in\nthe United Kingdom reported similar triggers (Rowlingson,\n2000). In-depth interviews revealed illness of self or signifi-\ncant others, the death of a relative or friend, acting as an\nexecutor, changes in family circumstances and planning to\nundertake long distance travel triggered will making\n(Rowlingson, 2000). However, many people who do not\nexperience significant life events make wills and conversely\nsome do not make wills despite experiencing such events. In\na national survey of England and Wales, respondents who\nhad children living with them were half as likely to have a\nwill as those without children living in the household\n(Brooker, 2007) suggesting that currently having dependent\nchildren is not necessarily a trigger for making a will.\nResearchers still do not fully understand the various triggers\nof will making, their interaction, and their impact at different\nlife stages.\nTilse et al. 3\nResearch exploring triggers for decisions to make a will\ngenerally does not make a distinction between making and\nchanging a will. Making a will for the first time, however, is\nlikely to differ from updating a will in that the former involves\ndeciding to take action to plan for the future, whereas the latter\nis about updating due to life changes or re-evaluating life cir-\ncumstances having already shown a propensity to plan. Recent\nresearch undertaken by State Trustees Limited, Victoria (2012)\nfound that around half of the respondents with a will had\nupdated it at least once, although fewer respondents under 50\nyears of age had changed their will. This suggests that with\nincreasing life expectancies, most people who have wills are\nlikely to update them at least once in their lives.\nPrevalence and Predictors of Non-Will Making\nFew non-will makers make a deliberate decision not to make\na will (Humphrey et\nReasons for not making a will range from a view that the\ndistributive principles embodied by intestacy laws are suffi-\ncient (Browder, 1969), psychological fears regarding mortal-\nity or an unwillingness to contemplate death, perceptions\nthat the process of making a will is overly costly, complex,\nand obscure (Weisbord, 2012), having other arrangements\nsuch as joint accounts in place and/or believing there is noth-\ning of value to leave (Finch & Mason, 2000; Wilson & Tilse,\n2012).

Following project approval by (university\nname and approval number left blank for blind review)\nEthics Committee, a telephone survey was administered.\nQuota sampling based on population size within each State\nand Territory was used, with oversampling in smaller legal\njurisdictions (Australian CapitalTerritory, NorthernTerritory,\nand Tasmania) to ensure adequate numbers for analysis. The\nsample was age-stratified to ensure at least half of respon-\ndents were aged 18 to 45 years. The inclusion of a substantial\nproportion of younger respondents is important as prior\nresearch suggests that this group is the least likely to have\nmade a will. Age stratification also ensured the sample\nreflects the age distribution of the Australian population in\nwhich approximately half of adults are aged 18 to 45 years\n(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011b).\nSurveys were conducted in August and September 2012\nusing random fixed-line contact numbers to recruit the sam-\nple. Random number generation, as opposed to using pre-\nexisting lists, provides greater coverage. Although sampling\nwas limited to fixed-line numbers, we do not expect this to\nhave significantly affected the results. When compared with\n2013), the sample obtained was broadly representative of\nthe Australian population with respect to age, gender, cul-\ntural characteristics, and rates of home ownership. It has\nbeen shown that younger males, renters, and those from cul-\nturally diverse backgrounds are more likely to have only a\nmobile phone (Jackson, Pennay, Dowling, Coles-Janess, &\n4 SAGE Open\nA total of 12,110 households were randomly contacted by\ntelephone with 40% (4,846) of calls falling outside the sam-\nple (e.g., no one above 18 available, jurisdictional or age\nquotas already met).

Any response that did not fit within a\npre-existing category was recorded verbatim and later coded\nby the authors.\nRespondents were fairly evenly distributed across age\ngroups, except for the very young (18-24) and very old (75+)\nwho were slightly under represented.

Statistical significance was set at 5% (p \n.05). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate sta-\ntistics, including frequencies, cross-tabulations, chi-square\ntests, and t tests. Logistic regression was used to identify pre-\ndictors of having or not having a will.\nResults\nPrevalence of Will Making\nNon-will makers were more prevalent among younger peo-\nple (see Table 1). For example, 90% of those aged between\nrespondents aged 70 years or older had one.\nPredictors of Will Making\nVariables significantly associated with will making at the 5%\nlevel in bivariate analyses were considered for inclusion in\nmultivariate logistic regression. These variables (gender,\nrelationship status, parenthood, ethnic diversity, acting as an\nexecutor, and becoming a guardian) were entered into a mul-\ntivariate logistic regression equation alongside age and esti-\nmated estate value (Table 2). Other demographic variables\nnot associated with will making behavior in the current\nresearch, but shown in previous research to be associated\nwith will making, were also entered into the model. These\nincluded level of education, receiving a bequest, experience\nadvising others about will making, and being involved in a\nlegal dispute over the way in which a person's assets should\nbe distributed after his or her death.\nResults revealed that age (being older) and higher estate\nvalue were the strongest predictors of whether or not people\nhad a will, whereas other characteristics (e.g., relationship\nstatus, gender, and ethnic diversity) contributed little to the\nability to distinguish between will makers and non-will mak-\ners. Age alone was able to accurately classify three quarters\nof the sample as either a will maker or non-will maker.1 For\neach year older an adult grows, his or her likelihood of hav-\ning a will increases by 10%. Age and estimated estate value\ncombined accurately classified 78% of the sample.2 Adding\nin the remaining variables improved the model's ability to\nclassify respondents by only 1%.3\nDifferentiating those who do and do not have a will.Non-will\nmakers constituted 41% of the respondents. Of this group,\n54% expect to make a will in the future. A lack of time and/\nor interest appears to account for the majority of non-will\nmaking behavior. For example, the most common reasons\ngiven by respondents for not having a will were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nOnly a few non-will makers identified barriers to will\nmaking such as the costs involved in preparing a will (n = 16,\n2%) or complex process issues (n = 15, 1%), although these\nfactors may contribute to procrastination. Of those who did\nnot currently have a will, fewer than 1% cited unwillingness\nto consider mortality as a contributing factor. However, it is\npossible that most people unwilling to contemplate these\nissues did not agree to participate in the survey.\nTable 1.

Perceptions of the value of assets and the signifi-\ncance of life stage responsibilities seem to be important in\ndecisions about making a will. For the vast majority of those\nwithout a will, making a will is something they should \"get\naround to doing\" rather than relying on the state to distribute\ntheir assets according to intestacy legislation. No non-will\nmakers spoke about using alternatives to wills such as inter-\nvivos transfers or an unwillingness to pass on assets to the\nnext generation as a motivation for not having a will.\nKnowledge of the Consequences of Dying\nIntestate\nNon-will makers were asked what they thought the law said\nwould happen to a person's assets if they died without a will.4\nThe response options are included in Figure 1. There was also\nan \"I don't know\" option; however, very few respondents (n\n= 29, 3%) stated they did not know what would happen. A\nhigher proportion of respondents incorrectly believed that the\nlaw said that family members (n = 387, 39%), rather than\nintestacy laws (which were described in general terms in the\nsurvey; n = 269, 27%), would determine how assets should be\ndivided between surviving relatives. A similar proportion of\nnon-will makers believed the law said that the courts would\nbe required to divide assets between family members (n =\n156, 16%) or they believed the law gave the government the\nThis pattern was largely consistent across key demo-\ngraphic variables, including age, gender, relationship status,\nethnic diversity, and estate value. Significant differences\nwere observed, however, between non-will makers who\nintended to make a will at some stage and those who did not\nintend to make a will (see Figure 1).5 Non-will makers who\nintended to prepare a will were significantly more likely to\nbelieve that the law said the government had first right to\ntheir assets than believe that their family can determine how\nassets are divided. By contrast, non-will makers who did not\nintend to prepare a will were significantly more likely to\nbelieve family members and relatives were responsible for\ndividing up the assets.6\nThis research provided little evidence to suggest that the\ndecision not to make a will is driven by an awareness of the\nconsequences of dying intestate. For example, only seven\nout of 980 non-will makers reported not having a will because\nthey believed existing laws would divide their assets\nappropriately:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm happy with the laws\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I don't think about death. I presume my assets will go\nto my closest relatives\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I have faith in the system\nHowever, there was wide variation in their understanding\nof intestacy laws among non-will makers who do not intend\nto prepare a will. Three respondents believed laws set out\nhow their assets would be divided, two believed family\nwould be responsible for dividing their assets, and two\nrespondents believed the government or the courts would\ndivide their assets.\nOverall, non-will makers'understanding of intestacy laws\nvaried markedly. It is also interesting to note that only 8%\nFigure 1. Non-will makers' beliefs about what the law says about how their assets will be divided if they die intestate as a function of\ntheir intention to prepare a will.\nTilse et al. 7\n(n = 108) of will makers described their main purpose in hav-\ning a will as being to ensure the government does not step in.\nThus, it appears that it is not concerns about intestacy laws\nthat prompt will making.\nTriggers That Prompt Will Making\nWill makers were asked what events had triggered their will\nmaking. The three most commonly reported events were as\nfollows:\nefforts to get organized in general (n = 751, 53%)\nVery few will makers attributed their decision to prepare\na will to generic advertising or third party suggestion (e.g.,\nfrom family members or professionals). Most (n = 1,170,\n82%) believed that no one had prompted them to prepare\ntheir most recent will. These findings suggest that although\nthere are a range of circumstances that potentially trigger\nwill making, the circumstances that ultimately lead an indi-\nvidual to prepare a will are likely to be specific for that per-\nson. Most individual will makers reflect a view that the\ndecision to make a will must come from them and be moti-\nvated by self-assessment of their circumstances. Having\nmade the decision to prepare a will, respondents were most\nlikely to seek advice about making a will from their partner\nNon-will makers were asked what events might trigger\nwill making in the future. The majority of non-will makers\nbelieved changes in health, financial, or family circumstances\nwould prompt will making. Circumstances that received\nendorsement as a likely trigger of will making by at least 20%\n(n = 196) of all non-will makers included the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 being diagnosed with a serious illness (n = 772, 79%)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 efforts to get organized in general (n = 399, 41%)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nWill making can be reactive or proactive. It is of interest to\nnote that non-will makers were much more likely to nominate\na serious illness as a potential trigger in contrast to those who\nhad made a will. This suggests the importance of a real and\ntangible confrontation with their own mortality as a primary\nmotivator for non-will makers in contrast to will makers who\nappear more likely to plan in response to taking on (adult)\nresponsibilities such as having children or acquiring assets.\nTriggers That Prompt Changes to Wills\nOf the 1,425 will makers who participated in this research,\njust under half had made changes to their will (n = 658,\n46%). Within this group,\nthe remaining quarter had made changes three or more\nCompared with people who had not made changes to their\nwill, respondents who had made changes were older7 and had\nestates of higher estimated value.8 For those who had made\nthree or more changes, having children or grandchildren and\nrelationship changes were significantly associated with will\nrevisions rather than changes in financial circumstances,\nwork, or health.\nThose circumstances that prompted changes to wills were\nsimilar to those that prompted individuals to prepare their\nfirst will. The most commonly reported reason was having\nmost likely to address asset distribution and least likely to\nreflect alterations to instructions regarding funeral, guardian-\nship, or health care arrangements.9\nThe relationship between demographic characteristics\nand types of changes participants made to their wills reflected\nthe links between age and life course events. For example,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 people who added a beneficiary10 or changed guard-\nianship instructions11 were, on average, younger than\npeople who had not made these changes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 people who had changed executors12 or amended\nfuneral instructions13 were, on average, older than\nthose who had not\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a higher proportion of respondents not in a relationship,\nin a new relationship, or in a de-facto relationship than\nthose who were currently or previously married had\nremoved a beneficiary.14\nTable 3.

Percentages reflect the proportion of all will makers who reported making changes to their wills.\n8 SAGE Open\nThese results suggest that the changes made adjusted pro-\nvisions to meet evolving life circumstances in terms of the\ncurrent asset base, family responsibilities, and relationship\nchanges. For many, will making is part of ongoing planning\nto protect assets and provide for family.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nResults revealed that approximately 59% ofAustralian adults\nhave a will, the greater proportion of these being older adults\nand those who have acquired more assets. This is, interna-\ntionally, a relatively high figure (DiRusso, 2009; Douglas\net\nnon-will makers suggest that procrastination, a lack of time\nand/or interest, and perceived relevance for life stage, rather\nthan systemic barriers or resistance to the idea of will mak-\ning, account for most non-will making behavior, even among\nthose respondents who do not currently intend to prepare a\nwill. This is consistent with other research (Humphrey etal.,\nlimited resistance to making will suggest that making a will\nis generally accepted as a social norm.\nThe higher prevalence of will making in Australia than in\nother Western countries especially the United States is inter-\nesting. Even for comparable older age cohorts, Australian\nrates of will making are much higher than in the United\nStates and the United Kingdom. Some American research\nsuggests dying without a will is the product of an overly\ncostly, complex, and obscure will making process (Weisbord,\n2012); conversely, Australians surveyed here identified few\nbarriers in terms of cost or access to advice. This does not,\nhowever, explain the difference between prevalence rates in\nAustralia, and in England and Wales (37% of those aged 16\nand above); as in Australia, few non-will makers in England\nand Wales identified lack of knowledge or cost as disincen-\nhowever, it is important to explore further whether procrasti-\nnation actually masks other barriers such as not knowing\nwhere to access information, concerns about discussing\ninheritance in complex families, or lack of knowledge about\nthe utility of wills for more than asset distribution, for exam-\nple, guardianship arrangements.\nThere are a number of other differences between coun-\ntries that might help to explain some variation in will making\nprevalence. Compared with Americans, a higher proportion\nof Australians have significant assets such as their own home\nKingdom), a second home or investment property (20% cf.\n5% in the United States and 11% in the United Kingdom),\nand a personal superannuation (non-government pension\nplan; 80% cf. 25% in the United States and 76% in the United\nKingdom15; Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013; Office for\nfairly similar rates of asset ownership in the United Kingdom\nand Australia, a more important factor may be that, unlike\nthe United States and the United Kingdom, there are no\ninheritance taxes in Australia. Hence, in Australia, there are\nno tax incentives to distribute wealth prior to death\n(Wiepking, Madden, & McDonald, 2010), encouraging the\ncompletion of a will to distribute assets after death.\nAge and estate value were strongly associated with will\nmaking, in keeping with earlier studies (e.g., Dekker &\nin previous research to be associated with will making behav-\nior, such as gender, parenthood, and relationship status\nWinters, 2005), were less useful in distinguishing between\nwill makers and non-will makers here. Some studies suggest\nthere may be a misconception among younger people that\nestate planning is only relevant to older and wealthier people\n(Rowlingson & McKay, 2005). However, younger individu-\nals can acquire significant assets, including life insurance\nand superannuation payouts made at death. Younger people\nwith superannuation to be paid to their estate rather than a\nnominated beneficiary require a will to ensure assets are dis-\ntributed according to their preferences. Younger people may\nalso fail to recognize that wills are not only useful in transfer-\nring assets but are importantly a mechanism to put in place\nguardianship and trust arrangements for dependent children\nand to include or exclude ex-partners. It can also be impera-\ntive to provide for a new partner for those who have sepa-\nrated but not divorced.\nWhat is clear is that knowledge (or more accurately lack\nof knowledge) of the implications of dying intestate does not\ndrive the decision to make or not make a will. These findings\nsupport previous research which has suggested that individu-\nals have very little understanding of the consequences of\ndying intestate (Rowlingson & McKay, 2005; Weisbord,\n2012). It is worth noting that beliefs surrounding the value of\nassets to bequeath influenced around one fifth of non-will\nmakers, the effect on non-will making rising as the value of\nassets declines. This finding is consistent with earlier work\nWilson & Tilse, 2012) and demonstrates that having both the\ntime and believing there is something to leave are influential\nfactors in the decision to draft a will.\nThe circumstances that trigger will making in previous\nresearch include a range of changes in personal circum-\nstances (e.g., marriage, parenthood, death of a loved one) or\npersonal wealth (e.g., buying a home, receiving an inheri-\ntance; Humphrey et\nof respondents identified more than one trigger for will mak-\ning, suggesting that a combination of factors leads people to\nprepare a will. Will makers failed to consistently identify any\nsingle specific change in personal circumstances that moti-\nvated them to draft a will. Instead, when asked what trig-\ngered them to prepare a will, respondents were most likely to\nrefer to general efforts to \"get organized.\" This finding sug-\ngests most individuals prepare a will at times when they are\nTilse et al. 9\ntaking steps to get their life in order. What triggers getting\ntheir life in order requires further investigation. Responses to\nquestions about intentions in making or changing a will sug-\ngest that providing for family and adjusting to changing fam-\nily circumstances are important. What is clear and consistent\nis that most had accepted an obligation to make a will.\nIn this study, slightly less than half of respondents had\nmade changes to their will. The extent to which respondents'\nwills reflected their current intentions and/or circumstances\nwas not clear. It is important that wills reflect testators' cur-\nrent situation and intentions; accordingly regularly review-\ning and updating a will are extremely important throughout\nlife. Contestation arising from not having an up to date will\ncan substantially reduce the value of the estate or even con-\nsume it all (Begleiter, 1994) and leave a legacy of family\nThe policy and practice issues arising from this research\ninclude how to (a) ensure people have a valid and up-to-date\nwill that truly reflects current assets, life circumstances, and\nintentions, and (b) encourage people with dependents to see\nwills as the way of formally nominating guardians and trust-\nees for minors.\nThe findings of few attitudinal and systemic barriers to\nwill making, and the common view that will making is indi-\nvidually initiated rather than prompted by advertising sug-\ngest that awareness raising campaigns (e.g., advertising by\nthe Public Trustees highlighting free will making services\nand educating the community about the purpose of will mak-\ning) are likely to have little impact on non-will makers. Most\nwill makers consider that the decision to make a will must\ncome from them in response to a self-assessment of their cir-\ncumstances. This suggests that the appropriate timing and\nmethods of targeting Australians to encourage making the\ninitial will need to be considered in more detail.\nDespite the above limitations, the research findings sug-\ngest some useful avenues for targeted public education.\nEfforts to get organized, especially in combination with life\nstage and asset changes, trigger will making. Targeted cam-\npaigns promoting will making for various age groups that\nlink to life stage events are therefore likely to have impact. A\nkey focus should be on the quite large cohort of younger\npeople (those aged less than 50 years) who did not have\nwills, particularly those with dependents. Intestacy laws are\npoorly understood; however, this research indicates that pub-\nlic education on this topic is unlikely to increase will making.\nAn alternate message of public education campaigns may be\naround looking after family given that intestacy creates prob-\nlems for families in terms of practical inconvenience.\nEducation campaigns also need to target current will mak-\ners about updating their will to ensure their will reflects cur-\nrent circumstances and intentions. As with making an initial\nwill, prompts to consider updating wills in the event of\nchanges in assets, for example, as part of conveyancing\npackages for properties (Brooker, 2007) and/or changing\nfamily circumstances such as marriage, divorce, separation,\nor the birth of a child could be useful. Campaigns intended to\npromote will making may benefit from identifying the coin-\ncidence of factors that encourage people to \"get organized\"\nand include will making in educational and advertising strat-\negies to raise awareness about financial, retirement, and care\nplanning.\nVery few participants reported using their wills to leave\nadditional instructions (e.g., funeral instructions). Although\nwills are predominantly used as means of asset distribution,\nthey can be used for much wider purposes including nomi-\nnating guardians for dependents to provide for their ongoing\ncare and support. Broadening the understanding of what a\nwill is for, how and when it should be updated, and the risks\nand costs of contestation is an important issue to consider in\nany social marketing strategy.\nA strength of this study is that it is the first large-scale,\nbroad-based, nationally representative survey focusing spe-\ncifically on will making undertaken in Australia. With a few\nGoetting & Martin, 2001), existing data are primarily based\non non-representative samples. A limitation is the relatively\nlow response rate (33%). However, this is similar to other\nestate planning and may reflect an avoidance of discussing\nthese issues. Furthermore, the sample was representative of\nthe broader Australian population on a number of indicators.\nAn additional limitation is that cross-sectional surveys do\nnot allow for exploration of changes in attitudes and prac-\ntices over time and generations.\nIn the context of predicted large wealth transfers between\ngenerations, increased cultural diversity, and changing fam-\nily structures, baseline data on the making and changing (or\nlack of changing) of wills are critical. Failure to have a will,\nor having a will that does not reflect current intentions, can\nlead to distributions of wealth not wanted by a person as well\nas contestation by family and others. This has significant\nadverse consequences not only for the individuals involved\nbut also for the state, for example, through the cost of engag-\ning the judicial process to resolve these disputes. The starting\npoint for tackling these issues is understanding who is not\nmaking or updating wills and why. This article provides an\nevidence base for policy makers and will drafters to respond\nto these challenges.\n"
