The National Research Council\nappointed an advisory committee called the Committee on\nVeterans Medical Problems (now the Board on the Health\nof Select Populations) and subsequently a subcommittee on\ntwins (now the Committee on Twins Studies). MFUA is cur-\nrently within the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC.\nWho is in the cohort?\nbirth certificates for White male multiple births (from all\nstates except Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,\nMaine, Missouri, Utah, Vermont and the city of New\nOrleans, thus representing 93% of population of the USA\nat the time). Whereas all multiple births were identified, it\nwas decided that the registry would include only White\nmen (who made up nearly 90% of the WWII-era service\nmembers) to create a more homogeneous cohort.3\nVeterans Administration (VA) records were used to find\nserved in the Armed Forces.1,2,4,6 These efforts led to iden-\nStarting in 1965, the men were mailed a brief question-\nnaire (Q1) requesting their enrolment in the study and\nincluding questions to determine zygosity. Of those who\nQuestionnaire 2 (Q2), constituting the baseline assessment,\nwas mailed after the man replied to Q1. Q2 was an epi-\ndemiological questionnaire largely identical to a survey\nwho had previously answered Q1, 72.6% responded to\nMilitary records were reviewed in 1970 at the National\nPersonnel Records Center in St Louis, MO, with the ab-\nstracted information archived on microfiche in the MFUA\noffice in Washington, DC. Essentially, 99% of the twin\npairs have birth certificates and information extracted\nfrom their service records, including induction data. If ser-\nvice record data are used to compare men selected for the\ncohort who did not participate at baseline with those with\nbaseline data: there is no difference on age at which they\nentered the service; those who participated at baseline\nserved on average 100 days longer; and officers were more\nlikely to participate than enlisted men. Those who\nKey Messages\n\u00b7 The NAS-NRC Twin Registry permits use of classical methods that compare the similarity of monozygotic (MZ) twin\npairs and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and co-twin control methods that compare twins having a disease (or exposure)\nwith their healthy (or non-exposed) co-twins.\n\u00b7 Findings show that interplay between genes and environments over time is associated with healthy ageing as well as\nwith liability to diseases and conditions including cardiovascular diseases, dementing illnesses and age-related macu-\nlar degeneration.\n\u00b7 Heritability was greater for manic-depressive psychosis than for schizophrenia and for Alzheimer disease than for\nParkinson disease.\n\u00b7 Key environmental exposures included smoking, which is associated with greater risk of cancer, cardiovascular dis-\nease, poor cognition and eye disease.\n\u00b7 The NAS-NRC Twin Registry is a unique research resource, representing the generation of American men who served\nin World War II.\nparticipated had 0.4 more years of education at the time of\nenlistment and were taller by 7.5 mm.\npairs in the registry and provides descriptive statistics for\nthe men who participated at each wave.\nHow often have they been followed up?\nThe entire registry has been followed up by mailed ques-\ntionnaire (Q) three times--Q3, Q7, Q8--with a fourth\nmailing comprising the NEO Five Factor Personality\nInventory. The other Qs were either administrative mail-\nings or were part of ancillary data collection.\nThe Q3 questionnaire, focused on schooling and earn-\nhad valid addresses and had not requested to be removed\nresponded; 0.2% were newly deceased.6 Responses to Q3\nwere only coded for pairs where both members responded.\nThe most thorough analysis of representativeness of the\nsample and of the pairs who responded was carried out at\nQ3.6 These investigators reported that little evidence of\nbias was detected. Q3-responding twins were quite com-\nparable to the entire twin panel: there was slightly better\nsurvival starting at age 47 compared with the general US\nWhite male population; among responding pairs, rates of\nreceiving disability benefits were similar to those among all\nWorld War II veterans; a higher percentage had completed\n16 or more years of school compared with all US White\nmale veterans; and twin respondents were more likely to\nfall into the highest earnings category than were all White\nmale veterans or all US White males.\nTable 1.

Q1 (not shown here) was a request to enrol in the study. Q2 constituted the baseline data collection.\nQ3 was a follow-up focusing on education and work. Q4 (not shown here) was a request for permission to link to medical records. Q5 was part of the ancillary\nNHLBI study. Q6 has been lost to history. Q7 and Q8 were follow-up surveys replicating many of the questions asked at Q2.\nIn 1985, the second epidemiological questionnaire\n(Q7), similar to the first epidemiological questionnaire\n(Q2), was mailed to all individuals in the registry. In 1998,\nthe third epidemiological questionnaire (Q8) was mailed to\nall surviving pairs and to `singleton' twins (i.e. whose co-\ntwin was not available, due to death or lack of a valid ad-\ndress) who had previously completed both Q2 and Q7.\nNEO Five Factor Personality Inventory11 was mailed to\nsurviving twins. It measures the personality dimensions\nof Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience,\nAgreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Questionnaires\nMortality updates use the Veterans Affairs' Beneficiary\nIndex and Records Locator System database, the National\nDeath Index and LexisNexis. LexisNexis is a corporation\nproviding an electronic database for legal information and\npublic records. Dates of death are currently available\nthrough 2012, and updating cause of death is in progress.\nAncillary data collection, described below, occurred be-\ntween these waves to target informative subsets of the twin\npairs. These ancillary data are not currently available at\nBlood Institute (NHLBI), a sample of 514 twin pairs from the\nregistry living near: Indianapolis; Framingham, MA; or San\nFrancisco, Davis or Los Angeles, CA; were selected for clin-\nical examination. This subset of twins is known as the\nNHLBI Twin Study.12,13 Five longitudinal assessments of this\npanels, structural MRI during the last three waves and blood\nsamples from 711 men in the third wave for genotyping.\nThe Duke Twins Study of Memory and Aging was a study\nof dementia entailing four waves of telephone cognitive\nscreening with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status\n(TICS).14 The sample comprised all twin pairs from the ori-\nginal registry in which both members were thought to be alive\npositive for dementia (N\u00bc 550 over the four waves) and their\nco-twins were given a complete clinical workup, including a\nneuropsychological battery and collection of blood or buccal\nsamples. The second telephone interview of all individual\ntwins believed to be alive in 1992 included screening not only\nfor dementia, but also for Parkinson disease, cardiovascular\ndisease eye disease and cancer. Based on that screening, par-\nticipants were identified for further ancillary studies of\nParkinson disease16 and age-related macular degeneration.17\nWhat has been measured?\nTable 2 summarizes the data that have been collected.\nCopies of the epidemiological questionnaires may be found\non the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Studies of U.S. Veteran\nTwins website. The main longitudinal data are the repeated\nepidemiological surveys encompassing height, weight, car-\ndiovascular symptoms, problems breathing, other health\nconditions, smoking, alcohol use and other health behav-\niours. There are up to 145 diagnoses reflecting diseases and\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) based on VA\nadmissions records. Also available at one or more times of\nmeasurement are: education; employment history; occupa-\ntions of father, mother, spouse and twin brother; whether\nthe respondent grew up in an urban or rural area; and con-\ntact with his twin brother. From service records, branch,\nrank and dates of entry and separation were obtained.\nThere are standardized ability test scores including Army\nGeneral Classification Test (AGCT) / Armed Forces\nQualification Test (AFQT) scores for 2438 men and\nGeneral Classification Test (GCT) scores for 2386 men.\nClassification of zygosity, crucially important in twin\nstudies, initially relied on responses to two questions: (i)\n`As children were you and your twin as alike as two peas in\na pod or of only ordinary family resemblance?'; and ii) `In\nchildhood, did parents, brothers and sisters or teachers\nhave trouble in telling you apart?'2,7 At baseline, responses\nof both members of a pair were used to classify zygosity\nand certainty of the classification. When compared with\nblood typing results for 741 twin pairs, agreement was\n95%.2 More recently, DNA genotyping has become avail-\nable from various ancillary studies. Accuracy of question-\nnaire classification of zygosity when validated by DNA\nuses DNA if available, and the baseline zygosity classifica-\ntion based on questionnaire responses, blood typing and\nphysical similarity2 if DNA was not available. To facilitate\nuse of all of the data in biometric modelling, the question-\nnaire classification of zygosity has been recast as the twin\npairs' probability of being monozygotic, rather than as\nMZ, DZ and unknown categories, based on a logistic re-\ngression model that used available DNA19 as the gold\nWhat has been found?\nThe project bibliography currently includes 367 publica-\ntions addressing cardiovascular risk factors, schizophrenia,\nair pollution, eye disease, socioeconomic indicators, alco-\nhol use, smoking, obesity and cognitive functioning. A list\nof publications can be found at the IOM website.\nEarly publications included methods papers and publi-\ncations concerning psychopathology that took advantage\nof linkages with medical records from the armed\nforces and the VA. For example, in one early analysis of\nschizophrenia in the twin panel, the authors found no dif-\nference in incidence of schizophrenia among MZ as com-\npared with DZ twins, although onset in the MZ pairs\noccurred at a younger age. The age-corrected pairwise\ntwins.20 In MZ pairs, schizo-affective psychosis had double\nthe pairwise concordance rate compared with schizophre-\nnia, whereas pairwise concordance was similar for schizo-\naffective psychosis and manic depressive psychosis.21\nWork in this area contributed to formulating the diathesis-\nstress theory that the occurrence of schizophrenia reflects\nthe interaction of genetic vulnerability with environmental\ninfluences (including prenatal environment).22,23\nThe epidemiological questionnaires have been used in\nmultiple studies that have helped to establish the import-\nance of smoking in the population's health. A 24-year\nmortality follow-up for smoking-discordant twin pairs\nidentified in Q2 found more than twice the rate of death\namong the twins who smoked compared with their non-\nsmoking co-twins.24 For lung cancer, the relative risk was\n5.0 in MZ and 11.0 in DZ smoking-discordant pairs.\nWithin the NHLBI subsample, several analyses explored\nthe interaction of measured genes with smoking; for ex-\nample, whereas smoking was associated with poorer cogni-\ntive function, this harmful effect was weaker among APOE\nepsilon4 carriers than among noncarriers.25 Smoking was\nTable 2.

The Q8 questionnaire was\nused to derive a trait of `wellness' among the respondents,\nwho were on average nearly 75 years old.10 Wellness en-\ntailed the absence of any of the major chronic diseases\n(heart attack, coronary surgery, stroke, diabetes, prostate\ncancer). Heritability estimates for wellness were over 50%.\nData from the Duke Twins Study have shown lower\ndementia risk associated with greater cognitive activity in\nmidlife27 and with occupations that require use of\ndata, academic skills or extensive vocational training.28\nExposure to solvents, especially trichloroethylene, ascer-\ntained from task-based occupational histories, raises\nParkinson disease risk.29 In the NHLBI sub-study, glucose\nload measured over 30 years previously was associated\nwith risk of death from coronary heart disease, controlling\nfor other vascular risk factors.30 These studies demonstrate\nthe value of the data in connecting exposures over the life\ncycle to later life morbidity and mortality, while control-\nling for genetic and environmental factors shared between\nco-twins.\nWhat are the main strengths and\nweaknesses?\nThe NAS-NRC Twin Registry is a unique longitudinal\nsample, representative of their cohort, the so-called\n`Greatest Generation'.31 Nonetheless, it must be kept in\nmind that the sample was selected to include only White\nmale pairs in which both members survived and passed a\nphysical examination to enter military. The longitudinal\ntwin design is a strength. Being a twin registry, investiga-\ntors can study the interplay of environmental with genetic\ninfluences on health and socioeconomic conditions. The\nwealth of data collected from these men over 40 years,\nincluding self-assessments as well as record linkage, pro-\nvides the basis for better understanding the contributions\nof a lifetime of influences to longevity and health in\nold age.\nThe main weakness stems from the lack of infrastruc-\nture funding to MFUA for maintaining the registry.\nTherefore, neither health utilization records nor cause of\ndeath have been comprehensively updated for over two\ndecades, although updating of death records is currently in\nprocess. Further, the impact of the men's military experi-\nences has not been fully explored, and a fire in 1973 des-\ntroyed original service records for a substantial proportion\nof the members of the registry, making further data gather-\ning and verification of data problematic. Biological\nsamples, including genotyping, were only collected from\nmen who participated in ancillary projects in which they\nwere evaluated in person--these represent <5% of the co-\nhort. Finally, all of the data from the ancillary projects\nhave not been integrated into the registry, although this\ntoo is in process.\nHow can I access the data?\nInformation about access to the NAS-NRC Twin Registry\ncan be found on the IOM website, [http://www.iom.edu/\nActivities/Veterans/TwinsStudy.aspx].
