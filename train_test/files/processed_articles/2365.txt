Demographic and socioeconomic status differences in perceptions of difficulty with mobility in late life.\n\u00a9 The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \n \nMOBILITY functioning is one of the most important\nfactors that affects independence and quality of life in\nlater years. Among older adults, difficulty with mobility is\nassociated with less time spent outside the home and worse\nperceptions about general health status (Iezzoni, 2003;\nSingh-Manoux et al., 2006). Older adults with mobility\nlimitations are also at higher risk of falling, developing dis-\nability, and dying earlier (Abellan van Kan et al., 2009; de\net al., 2008). Given the potential impact that mobility limi-\ntations can have on the well-being of older adults, research-\ners have had a long-standing interest in whether mobility\ndisability varies among groups defined by demographic\ncharacteristics and socioeconomic status.\nTypically, measures used to assess disparities in mobility\ndisability have been based on self-reported answers to ques-\ntions regarding difficulty with various activities. Many sur-\nveys of older adults, for example, ask whether a respondent\nhas difficulty (and if so, how much difficulty) with tasks\nup stairs, or getting into or out of a bed or chair. Responses\nto these types of questions often vary by such factors as age,\nsex, marital status, or socioeconomic status, suggesting the\npresence of disparities in mobility limitations.\nHowever, differential understanding and use of self-\nreported response categories may contribute to these dispari-\nties (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, & van Doorslaer, 2008; Bago\nd'Uva, van Doorslaer, Lindeboom, & O'Donnell, 2008;\nIburg, Salomon, Tandon, & Murray, 2001; Lindeboom &\nvan Doorslaer, 2004). For instance, two individuals with the\nsame underlying level of mobility function may report dif-\nferent levels of difficulty with mobility-related tasks be-\ncause they may not have the same ideas and attitudes about\nwhat defines difficulty (Melzer, Lan, Tom, Deeg, & Guralnik,\n2004). Differences in reporting difficulty also could result\nfrom varying expectations about health, differences in liv-\ning environments that affect the ability to perform tasks, or\nfrom dissimilarities in the use of or access to combinations\nof personal and technological assistance with mobility-\nrelated activities (Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer, et al.,\nSalomon, Tandon, Murray; World Health Survey Pilot\nStudy Collaborating Group, 2004). In turn, these causes for\ndifferences in reporting behaviors may vary by individual\ncharacteristics resulting in systematic differences in report-\ning patterns and what is often referred to as reporting het-\nerogeneity (Shmueli, 2003) or response category cut-point\nDemographic and Socioeconomic Status Differences in\nPerceptions of Difficulty With Mobility in Late Life\nJennifer C.

This study assesses whether socioeconomic and demographic differences in reported mobility limitations\nare attributable to differential perceptions of mobility difficulty that result in the differential use of response categories.\nMethods. Data come from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study and its parent study, the Taiwan\nLongitudinal Study of Aging. Ordered probit models with person-specific cut-points are used to test whether, after con-\ntrolling for underlying mobility using objective performance measures, cut-points for reporting mobility limitations vary\nacross groups defined by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.\nResults. Age is the only characteristic that is consistently associated with the location of the cut-points for reporting\nmobility difficulty: At the same level of underlying mobility difficulty, older adults are more likely than younger adults\nare to report difficulty with all tasks except short walks. Other variables showed differences but only for one specific\nactivity, for example, urban residents are more likely to report difficulty running than are rural residents with the same\nunderlying level of mobility function.\nDiscussion. For most mobility activities, there are no systematic differences in the perception of difficulty by individual\ncharacteristics. Thus, for older Taiwanese adults, differences in mobility limitations associated with socioeconomic status are\nmore likely to reflect underlying differences in function than differences in how these groups report the same capacity.The usual\nloss of mobility with age, however, reflects both a decrease in capacity and a lowering of the threshold for reporting difficulty.\nKey Words: Cut-point shifts--Mobility difficulty--Older adults--Taiwan.\n(threshold) shifts (Murray et al., 2003). For example, be-\ncause income can afford many advantages, older adults with\nhigher incomes may believe that they should be in good\nhealth. As a result, older adults with higher incomes may\nhave higher thresholds for reporting difficulty (i.e., are less\nwilling to acknowledge having difficulty) than older adults\nwith lower incomes who may have lower expectations for\nhealth. Alternatively, the higher expectations of higher in-\ncome adults could result in small problems making them feel\nthat they are having difficulty, resulting in lower thresholds.\nCut-point shifts occur when, at a given level of \"true\" or\nunderlying health, population subgroups systematically pro-\nvide different evaluations of their health (Lindeboom & van\nexample, Figure 1 shows how the same level of actual mo-\nbility functioning can be mapped into different categories of\na three-category ordered response variable for difficulty\nwalking (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Iburg et al.,\nTandon, Murray, Salomon, & King, 2003). The centerline\nrepresents the unobserved underlying level of difficulty\nwalking a short distance. The scale on the left shows re-\nsponse category thresholds (t1 and t2) for men and the scale\non the right shows the thresholds for women. The thresholds\nmark the levels of underlying mobility limitation at which\nan individual will choose one category over another (Bago\nSalomon et al., 2004). The lower thresholds mark the boundar-\nies for reporting no difficulty with walking versus any diffi-\nculty with walking. The higher thresholds indicate the\nability level for which a respondent would report the inabil-\nity to walk rather than difficulty with walking. Given the\ntrue level of mobility indicated by the dotted line in Figure 1,\na male respondent would report no difficulty, whereas a\nfemale respondent would indicate having difficulty. (Note\nthat although Figure 1 shows that both thresholds are lower\nfor women than for men, it is possible that one threshold\ncould be lower and one higher; Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell,\nThis analysis focuses on cut-point shifts in reporting mo-\nbility difficulty among older adults. Are differences in re-\nported mobility difficulty attributable to differential\nperceptions of health that result in the differential use of\nresponse categories? We examine whether cut-points for re-\nporting mobility limitations among older Taiwanese adults\ndiffer across demographic and socioeconomic groups.\nBackground\nIn addition to measurement error, variation in reports\nof difficulty is driven by two factors (King et al., 2004;\nSalomon, Tandon, Murray; World Health Survey Pilot Study\nmobility difficulty are a function of underlying physiological\nJette, 1994). Second, as the previous discussion of Figure 1\nsuggests, self-reports of mobility difficulty are also influ-\nenced by perceptions of difficulty that reflect differences in\nhealth expectations as well as differences in social and phys-\nical environments. These perceptions affect the translation of\ncapacity into reports of difficulty. Demographic and socio-\neconomic disparities in measures of self-reported mobility\ndifficulty, therefore, can emerge from group differences in\nunderlying capacity and from group differences in percep-\ntions of difficulty that result in cut-point shifts (King et al.,\nResearch on older adults that examines socioeconomic\nstatus and demographic variation in reports of mobility dif-\nficulty using techniques such as ordered logit or probit mod-\nels assumes that all respondents use the same scale or criteria\nto define difficulty and, therefore, does not account for cut-\npoint shifts (Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003; Salomon,\nall cross-group differences in reports of mobility difficulty\nare attributed to underlying mobility capacity, and the po-\ntential influence of differing perceptions is ignored. Results\nfrom such studies, therefore, may reflect both group differ-\nences in underlying capacity and group differences in the\ntranslation of capacity into reports of difficulty. Disregard-\ning the association between demographic and socioeco-\nnomic characteristics and cut-points can lead to under- or\noverestimation of cross-population differences in underly-\ning mobility capacity in the cross-section and changes in\ncapacity over time (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008;\nTandon et al., 2003). Studies that assume that respondents\nuse difficulty scales in an identical manner cannot isolate\nand make cross-population comparisons of mobility capac-\nity (some might argue that capacity is the preferred measure\nof health for cross-population comparisons; Salomon,\nWomen\nMen\nNo difficulty\nNo difficulty\nAny Difficulty\nAny Difficulty\nUnable\nUnable\nUnderlying\nMobility\nFigure 1. Illustration of cut-point shifts by sex for difficulty walking (adapted\nMathers, et al., 2003). These studies, however, can identify\ndisparities in the disablement process, specifically dispari-\nties in the manifestation of capacity in the social and physi-\ncal environment (Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003).\nA complementary line of research focuses on socioeco-\nnomic and demographic variation in perceptions of diffi-\nculty that results in cut-point shifts. The detection of\ncut-point shifts is rooted in a method that uses exogenous\nobjective measures of health to fix the level of ability or\nstandardize the underlying mobility scale so that remaining\ndifferences in reported difficulty can be attributed to cut-\npoint shifts (Tandon et al., 2003). To analyze cut-point shifts,\nresearchers have extended standard ordered probit models to\nallow the cut-points to vary by individual characteristics\npossible to tease out the effects of a covariate on latent mo-\nbility capacity and on the cut-points without additional in-\nformation or identifying assumptions (Tandon et al., 2003).\nOne school of work has used objective mobility perfor-\nmance tests in the hope that these measures capture the ef-\nfects of background variables on latent mobility, leaving\nonly their effects on the cut-points. Iburg and colleagues\n(2001) use seven measured performance tests to control for\nlatent mobility in assessing the effect of background charac-\nteristics on the cut-points for self-reported and physician-\nassessed mobility ability. Melzer and colleagues (2004) use\nthe MOBLI index of mobility limitations as a control in as-\nsessing cut-point shifts by age, sex, race, income, and edu-\ncation. Although these studies identify the presence (or\nabsence) of cut-point shifts, it is possible that some socio\ndemographic differences in cut-points may also reflect\nsociodemographic differences in underlying capacity.\nNonetheless, these studies provide insights into disparities in\nmobility difficulty by establishing whether part of the variation\nis attributable to differences in perceptions or how they are\nreported. Systematic variation in cut-points by socioeconomic\nand demographic characteristics indicates that perceptions play\na role in disparities of reported mobility difficulty. Conversely,\nthe absence of cut-point shifts across population subgroups,\nsuch as sex, suggests that differences in reported difficulty\nare more likely to reflect differences in underlying capacity\nrather than differences in perceptions (Melzer et al., 2004).\nAnother school of work has supplemented self-reported\nmeasures by preparing a set of vignettes intended to repre-\nsent various levels of latent mobility and asking the respon-\ndent to classify these vignettes using the same categories as\nthe self-reports (see Tandon et al., 2003 for details). Be-\ncause all respondents classify the same vignettes, this addi-\ntional information can be used to anchor the cut-points,\npermitting estimation of the effects of the same covariate on\nlatent health and on the cut-points. However, because we do\nnot have vignettes, we rely on the same type of exclusion\nrestriction as the studies by Iburg and colleagues (2001) and\nMelzer and colleagues (2004) and use two mobility perfor-\nmance tests as controls in assessing differences in the per-\nception of the cut-points by a number of socioeconomic\nstatus indicators and demographic characteristics.\nThis study expands on existing literature in a number of\nways. First, we examine reporting heterogeneity in Taiwan.\nBecause the translation of capacity into reports of difficulty\noccurs within a social environment (Freedman, 2009), pat-\nterns of cut-point shifts in Taiwan may differ from patterns\nin countries that have different social support and health\ncare systems and different expectations for and beliefs about\nhealth. Unlike many Western populations examined in other\nstudies of cut-point shifts, Taiwan has a social support sys-\ntem for older adults based more on family support and\nstrong norms of familial obligation than on institutional or\npublic assistance (Knodel, Ofstedal, & Hermalin, 2002); a\nuniversal health care system that supports the use of preven-\ntive care and the use of both Western and traditional Chinese\nmedical providers (Ofstedal & Natividad, 2002); and beliefs\nabout health and well-being that are influenced by several\nChinese philosophies and religions, including Taoism, Bud-\ndhism, Confucianism, and the belief in Yin and Yang or the\nbalance within one's body and between the body and the\ncut-point shifts in a new setting will provide more insights\ninto the role that the social and cultural context plays in the\nreporting of mobility limitations by older adults.\nSecond, we examine the potential effects of perceptions\nfor multiple mobility-related activities. With some excep-\ntions (e.g., Iburg et al., 2001), studies tend to focus on a sin-\ngle measure of general or gross mobility function (e.g., Bago\nd'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer,\nsearch shows that variation in reporting behaviors may be\nTherefore, when evaluating the mobility ability of older pop-\nulations, it is important to know whether and how reporting\ndifferences may vary across specific mobility-related tasks.\nFinally, we test for perceptual differences in mobility dif-\nficulty across infrequently examined demographic groups.\nAlthough previous research has also investigated health dis-\nparities by marital status and urban/rural residence, fewer\nstudies have examined whether reporting heterogeneity ex-\nists for groups defined by these characteristics. The present\nstudy, therefore, also will shed additional light on whether\ndifferences in mobility difficulty by urban residence and\nmarital status are more likely to reflect differences in capac-\nity or a combination of capacity and perceptions.\nMethods\nData\nThe data used for the present analyses came from the So-\ncial Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS)\nand its parent study, the Taiwan Longitudinal Study ofAging\n(TLSA). TLSA was first conducted in 1989 on a nationally\nrepresentative sample of persons aged 60 and older (Hermalin,\nLiang, & Chang, 1989). Follow-up interviews have been\nconducted approximately every three years. The original\n1989 sample has been extended twice to include a randomly\nselected representative sample of adults aged 50\u00ad66 years in\n1996 and a randomly selected representative sample of\nwas conducted in 2000 and included a randomly selected\nsubset of respondents interviewed in the 1999 wave of\nTLSA. SEBAS included both an in-home interview and a\nhospital-based physical exam (see Goldman et al., 2004 for\na description of SEBAS). The sample for the second wave of\nSEBAS, which was conducted in 2006, consisted of the sur-\nviving exam participants from the first wave of SEBAS and\na randomly selected sample of respondents who first entered\nOur analyses focused on the 2006 wave of SEBAS, the\nfirst wave in which physical performance measures of mo-\nbility were collected.

At-\ntrition of SEBAS I participants was not significantly related\nto sex or educational attainment. Respondents from the\n2003 wave of the TLSA who were LFU or who died before\nbeing interviewed were more likely to be Fukienese but\nwere no different from interviewed respondents in terms of\nage, sex, education, or mobility ability. Sample attrition,\ntherefore, could result in under- or overestimation of cut-\npoint differences by age and between ethnic groups.\nThe final analysis sample excluded respondents who\nwere missing data on key indicators. We excluded 39 cases\nthat were missing either the performance-based measures\n(n = 31) or the self-reported mobility measures (n = 8) and\nan additional 54 cases missing covariates of interest. The\nresulting analysis sample contained 1,191 Taiwanese adults\nMeasures\nPerformance-based measures.--Analyses adjusted for\nunderlying mobility function by incorporating two widely\nused measures of physical performance as the exogenous\nobjective measures of mobility capacity: a timed 3-m walk\nand timed chair stands, both performed in the respondent's\nhome. Respondents were asked to walk a distance of 3 m at\ntheir usual walking speed. Because of space limitations, 12\nrespondents walked fewer than 3 m. For these respondents,\nwho walked between 2 and 2.5 m, we scaled the time up\nproportionally. Respondents were allowed to use assistive\ndevices if needed. Each respondent was timed for two\nwalks. The Pearson correlation between the two walks was\n.9. Based on standard practices in the literature, the faster of\nthe two walks was used (see, e.g., Guralnik et al., 2000;\nRivera, Fried, Weiss, & Simonsick, 2008).\nFor the chair stand test, respondents were asked to stand\nup and sit down from an armless, straight back chair with a\nhard seat five times as quickly as possible.

Respondents were timed from the starting\nseated position to the final standing position at the end of\nthe fifth stand. Chair heights differed from home to home.\nExploratory regressions of chair stand completion times on\nchair height, controlling for age, sex, and respondent's\nheight, revealed that chair height was significantly associ-\nated with completion times (results not shown). Chair stand\ntest results, therefore, were adjusted to account for the vari-\nation in chair height. We regressed chair stand time on chair\nheight, person height, and age separately for men and\nwomen. Based on these results, we adjust the observed\ncompletion time as follows:\n( )\ni i i\nc c h h\n= + -\n,\nwhere ci\nrepresents the observed completion time for indi-\nvidual i, b is the coefficient for chair height, h is the mean\nchair height across the entire sample, and hi\nis the height of\nthe chair used by the individual.\nSome respondents did not complete the timed walk or\nchair stand tests, most often for health or safety reasons. In\norder to include these respondents, we analyzed a number\nof different specifications of the timed walk and chair stand\nmeasures (results not shown). These analyses showed that\n(1) results were sensitive to the inclusion of those who could\nnot perform the tests; (2) completion times for the walk and\nchair stand tests had a nonlinear relationship with the under-\nlying level of mobility capacity; and (3) a small number of\noutliers on each test influenced this relationship. We, there-\nfore, included for each performance measure a log transfor-\nmation of the time it took to complete the test and a dummy\nvariable indicating whether a respondent was unable to per-\nform the test. We also examined a model including for each\nperformance measure a linear term, quadratic term, and an\nindicator for inability (data not shown), but cut-point results\nvaried little compared with the model using the log transfor-\nmations. If a performance test was not completed because a\nrespondent or the respondent's family refused, the timed\nwalk and chair stand measures were considered missing,\nand these respondents were excluded from analyses.\nSelf-reported mobility.--We examined cut-point shifts in\nactivities that require lower extremity function as a major\ncomponent: running a short distance (20\u00ad30 m), walking\n200\u00ad300 m, walking up two or three flights of stairs, squat-\nting, and lifting or carrying something that weighs 11\u00ad12\nkg. Respondents also reported on difficulty moving about\nthe house and getting out of bed/standing up/sitting in a\nchair. However, because too few respondents reported dif-\nficulty with these activities, statistical models (described\nbelow) could not be run for these outcomes. For each of the\nother five activities, respondents were asked if they had any\ndifficulty doing the activity and, if so, how much (some dif-\nficulty, great difficulty, or unable to do the activity). The\nsmall number of respondents reporting great difficulty pre-\nvented us from examining reporting differences across all\nfour categories. Therefore, we examined cut-point differ-\nences between no difficulty (coded as 0), some or great dif-\nficulty (coded as 1), and unable to perform the task (coded\nDemographic and socioeconomic characteristics.--We\nexamined cut-point shifts for groups defined by demo-\n75 years or older), sex, marital status (currently married vs.\nnot currently married), residence in an urban versus rural\narea, and ethnicity (Fukienese, Hakka, and Mainlander).\nEthnic groups have been defined, in part, by the timing of\ntheir migration to Taiwan and the point of origin on main-\nland China. The Fukienese, coming from the southern\nFukien province, and the Hakka, coming from the eastern\nKwangtung province, began their migration from Mainland\nChinese migration from Mainland China, beginning in\n1949, consisted of nationalist military soldiers and nonmil-\nitary supporters of the nationalist government (Mainlanders;\nWe also investigated whether reporting behaviors dif-\nfered by socioeconomic status as measured by (1) the\nrespondent's and, if married, the spouse's monthly income\n(measured in 2003 and categorized in quartiles) and (2) the\nrespondent's education (no formal education, primary, sec-\nondary, and postsecondary education).\nStatistical Procedures\nTo examine whether demographic and socioeconomic\ndifferences in reported mobility difficulty are attributable to\ndifferential perceptions of mobility that result in the differ-\nential use of response categories, we use an ordered probit\nmodel that allows the cut-points to depend on individual\ncharacteristics (Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer, et al., 2008;\nTandon et al., 2003). The model is based on the assumptions\nthat (1) there is an unobserved continuous latent variable *\ni\nY\nthat represents an individual's perceived mobility level; (2)\n*\ni\nY is normally distributed with a mean mi\nand variance of 1\nand reflects the true underlying mobility level plus measure-\nment error; and (3) mi\nis a function of a series of objective\nperformance measures Xi\n  \n\n=\n\n* ( ,1) and\ni i i i\nwhere \ni\nX is a row vector with the predictors of latent mobility\nbased on the timed walk and timed chair stands.\nThe model further specifies that responses to the self-\nreported mobility items, yi\n, are observed assuming a cut-point\nmodel in which cut-points are allowed to depend on individual\nfore, for a three-category outcome variable, responses yi\n, are\nobserved as follows:\n\n= -  < <\n*\ni i i\ny Y\n \n=  <\n*\ni i i i\ny Y\n\n=  < \n*\ni i i\ny Y\nThe cut-points, tij\n, are modeled as a function of individ-\n \n\n=\ni\nZ and  \ni i\n\n- = i\nZ\ne\nwhere \ni\nZ is a row vector containing the individual-level\ncharacteristics, g is a coefficient vector reflecting differ-\nences in the location of the first threshold, and d is a coeffi-\ncient vector reflecting differences in the distance between\nthe two thresholds (King et al., 2004). Therefore, unlike a\nstandard ordered probit model that ignores the potential in-\nfluence of perceptions on reports of difficulty, this model\naccounts for the effect of perceptions by allowing the trans-\nlation of mobility capacity into categories of the self-\nreported mobility measures (i.e., the cut-points) to vary by\nindividual characteristics.\nAn important caveat is that the model assumes that, once\nwe have controlled for the performance measures, socio-\neconomic characteristics are not associated with actual mo-\nbility functioning. If this assumption is incorrect, some of\nthe cross-group differences in the cut-points could reflect\ndifferences in underlying capacity as well as perceptual dif-\nferences in mobility difficulty.\nThe estimates of b, g, and d are derived using maximum\nlikelihood methods, based on the assumption that responses\nare independent across study participants. A significant coef-\nficient for a predictor of the cut-point between no difficulty\nand any difficulty, ti1, indicates that, controlling for the per-\nformance measures, the threshold for reporting difficulty var-\nies by the predictor under examination. A significant d\ncoefficient signifies that, given the objective level of perfor-\nmance, the distance between the difficulty and inability cut-\npoints (ti2 - ti1) differs by the characteristic of interest. For\nexample, a significant negative coefficient for being female\nfor the difficulty cut-point, with no effect on the perceived\ndistance between the two cut-points (e.g., a significant g coef-\nficient and a nonsignificant d coefficient), indicates that\nwomen have a lower threshold than men for reporting both\ndifficulty and inability to complete a task. This scenario is\ndepicted in Figure 1 in which the location of the cut-points for\nreporting difficulty, t1, and inability, t2, are lower for women\nthan for men, but the distance between the first and second\ncut-point, t2 - t1, is the same for men and women. Thus, at\nthe same level of underlying performance, women are more\nlikely than men to report difficulty or inability with a task.\nFor each self-reported mobility outcome, we run a single\nmodel that includes the two performance measures to control\nfor underlying mobility and simultaneously examines the ef-\nfects of all socioeconomic and demographic covariates on the\ncut-points. For cut-point predictors with multiple categories--\nsuch as ethnicity, which has three--we perform a Wald\ntest with a chi-square distribution to determine whether\nany of the categories differs from the others (StataCorp,\nLinear Latent and Mixed Models procedure (Rabe-Hesketh,\nResults\nTable 1 shows the distribution of the self-reported mobil-\nity difficulty measures overall and by sociodemographic\ncharacteristics. Overall, approximately 9%\u00ad16% of respon-\ndents report difficulty with a specific mobility-related activ-\nity (running, walking, going up stairs, squatting, and lifting\nor carrying 11\u00ad12 kg; see Table 1). The percentage report-\ning inability in an activity varies more widely, with as many\nwalk up several flights of stairs.\nThe average time to walk 3 m is 4.3 s (SD = 3.1), with\n4.6% of respondents being unable to perform the test (data\nnot shown). The average time to perform five chair stands is\nthe test (data not shown).\nReported difficulty with each of the five mobility-related\nactivities varies significantly by sociodemographic charac-\nteristics (Table 1). For all five activities, difficulty differs by\nage, sex, marital status, income, and educational attainment.\nSpecifically, reported difficulty increases with age, is worse\nfor women than for men, and worse for respondents not cur-\nrently married compared with currently married respon-\ndents. Reported difficulty is negatively associated with both\nincome and education. In addition, difficulty running 20\u00ad30 m\ndiffers significantly by ethnicity (Mainlanders have the\nmost difficulty), and walking up stairs differs by urban-rural\nresidence, with residents of rural areas reporting more dif-\nficulty.\nThe results of tests for differences in thresholds for re-\nporting impairment are shown in Table 2. In general, there\nis variation in the location of the threshold for reporting dif-\nficulty, t1, but no significant differences in the spread of the\nthresholds for reporting difficulty and inability (i.e., no dif-\nferences in log(t2 - t1)). Older adults have significantly\nlower thresholds for reporting difficulty versus no difficulty\nm (for which differences in t1 across age groups are not\nsignificant; c2 = 4.17, p = .12). In other words, older adults\nare more likely to report difficulty with most mobility-\nrelated activities than are their younger counterparts with\nthe same mobility capacity.\nDifferences across other groups are less consistent.

Thresholds do not differ signifi-\ncantly by income.\nAlthough there are no significant differences in the spread\nbetween cut-points, significant differences in the location of\nthe first threshold imply that inability thresholds are also\n(1) lower for older adults in reports of inability to perform\nall mobility activities except walking a short distance;\n(2) lower for women than for men in reporting the inability\nto lift and carry heavy objects; (3) higher for Hakka than\nMainlanders and for more educated than for less educated\nrespondents in reports of the inability to run; and (4) lower\nfor urban than for rural respondents in reporting the inability\nto run.\nDiscussion\nWe identify cut-point differences in reporting mobility\ndifficulty for groups defined by various demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics. Two clear patterns emerge\nfrom the results. First, the location of thresholds for report-\ning difficulty versus no difficulty differs across some demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic status groups but the spread\nbetween the thresholds for difficulty and inability do not.\nPerceptions, therefore, may have an effect on the absolute\nposition of the thresholds but do not have an effect on the\npositioning of the thresholds relative to each other. Second,\nage emerges as the only characteristic that is consistently\nassociated with difficulty cut-points. In the presence of con-\ntrols for mobility capacity, older adults have lower thresh-\nolds for reporting impairment. In other words, at the same\nlevel of mobility performance, older adults are more likely\nthan younger adults to report difficulty. Other respondent\ncharacteristics are not consistently related to reports of dif-\nficulty or inability for the mobility-related activities we ex-\namine. Therefore, with the exception of age differences,\nmost of the socioeconomic and demographic differences in\nmobility difficulty reported in Table 1 are more likely to\nreflect differences in capacity rather than differences in per-\nceptions that result in cut-point shifts.\nOur results regarding age differences in thresholds for re-\nporting mobility difficulty are consistent with findings from\nseveral studies. In both this study and the Melzer and col-\nleagues (2004) study on older adults in the United States,\nyounger respondents, compared with older respondents,\ntend to be more physically impaired before mobility diffi-\nculty is reported. Similarly, using the vignette approach,\nBoga d'Uva, O'Donnell and colleagues (2008) find that\nyounger adults in China, India, and Indonesia are more\nlikely than older adults with similar levels of actual mobility\nto report no difficulty moving around. These results suggest\nthat younger and older adults may have different expecta-\ntions for their health. Although older adults may find it ac-\nceptable to respond that they have difficulty, younger adults\nmay not. Differences in reporting behaviors by age could\nalso result from systematic age differences in the propensity\nto use assistive devices, in the availability and use of per-\nsonal assistance, or in environmental demands (Melzer\net al., 2004). It is also possible that these age differences\nmay reflect cohort changes in perceptions of and expecta-\ntions for health. Although the current generation of older\nadults has large families, low levels of education, and often\nworked in agriculture, future generations of elderly will\nhave fewer children, more education, and more varied work\nexperiences (Knodel et al., 2002). It will be interesting to\nsee whether and how reporting heterogeneity changes over\ntime in Taiwan.\nBecause patterns of cut-point shifts differ across the tasks\nwe examine, our findings indicate that cut-point shifts are\nsensitive to the activity under review. For instance, we find\ndifferences by sex only for carrying 11\u00ad12 kg and urban-\nrural differences in thresholds exist only for jogging a short\ndistance. Similarly, older adults have lower thresholds for\nreporting behavior could be related to the frequency with\nwhich an activity is done (Rahman & Liu, 2000). Women\nmay not regularly carry heavy objects, and urban residents\nmay not jog very often. Walking is a fairly common task\nfor most older adults, but the other mobility-related activi-\nties examined here may be performed less often. Respon-\ndents who do not perform certain tasks regularly may be\nmore likely to report difficulty than those who do the activ-\nity more often (Rahman & Liu, 2000). In a study of rural\nBangladeshi men and women, Rahman and Liu (2000)\nfound that differences by sex in reporting behaviors are larg-\nest for gendered activities and smallest for gender-neutral\ntasks.\nDifferences in reporting behaviors across tasks could also\nbe related to the sensitivity with which the walking and\nchair stand tests capture the underlying functioning neces-\nsary to perform the mobility-related outcomes in the study.\nFor example, we find the most sociodemographic differ-\nences in cut-points for running a short distance and no cut-\nexertion than running. Because we control specifically for\nwalking ability, the model may better account for the level\nof functioning necessary for walking than for running. How-\never, we also control for timed chair stands, which reflect,\namong other things, an individual's level of exertion (Lord,\nMurray, Chapman, Munro, & Tiedemann, 2002; Lindemann\net al., 2007). In fact, our results show that the chair stand test\nis a better predictor of underlying mobility functioning than\nis the walking test (see Supplementary Table 1) and, there-\nfore, plays a more important role than the walking test in\nassessing individual heterogeneity in cut-points.\nIn the context of previous work, our study results suggest\nthat reporting heterogeneity may be culture specific. Unlike\nmany other studies of socioeconomic and demographic dif-\nferences in thresholds for reporting mobility difficulty (e.g.,\nBago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Bago d'Uva, van\n2004), we find little evidence of systematic differences in\nreporting behaviors by sex, education, or income. Nor do\nwe find evidence for threshold differences by marital status\nor urban residence. These differences across studies could\nbe related to the homogeneity of the study population. In\nmore homogeneous societies, cultural norms and values\ncould more strongly influence health-reporting behaviors\nthan do social or economic status, whereas the reverse may\nbe true in more culturally heterogeneous populations. In\nTaiwan, dominant cultural norms and values are shaped by\nConfucian, Taoist, and Buddhist philosophies that stress,\namong other things, family interests and obligations over\nindividual needs and the importance of balance and har-\nmony between body and environment (Chen, 2000; Lai &\nSurood, 2009). Previous research on health in Chinese cul-\nture suggests that, given these underpinnings of Chinese\nsociety, older adults of Chinese descent may not only adapt\nmore readily to age-related illness and deficits than older\nadults in Western societies but also may be more likely to\nregard age-related health changes as an accepted part of grow-\ning older (see, e.g., Leung, Wu, Lue, & Tang, 2004 and Ikles,\n1998). As a result, many potential sources of socioeconomic\nand demographic differences in reporting behaviors--such as\ndifferences in health expectations, access to personal assis-\ntance and/or assistive technology, or living conditions with\nvarying environmental demands--may be less relevant to\nreporting behaviors in Taiwan. However, as previously sug-\ngested, the age differences we report could indicate that\ncohort differences in reporting behaviors are emerging.\nChanging familial, educational, and work experiences of\nTaiwanese adults could lead to a shift in the relative influ-\nence of cultural norms versus social or economic status on\nreporting behaviors.\nThis research also points to the utility of collecting infor-\nmation on both self-reported mobility difficulty and mobil-\nity capacity as measured by physical performance tests.\nSelf-reports of mobility difficulty are based on both under-\nlying physiological capacity and perceptions of difficulty\n1994). These difficulty measures, therefore, reflect an\nindividual's belief of how well they have adapted to func-\ntional deficits within the environments in which they live.\nHowever, without measures of capacity, it is not possible to\ndetermine whether the translation of capacity into difficulty\nalso reflects perceptions. At the same time, performance\nmeasures of capacity alone do not speak to whether or how\nwell individuals may have adapted to functional limitations\n(Guralnik, Branch, Cummings, &, Curb, 1989). To fully un-\nderstand the causes of, and potential interventions for mo-\nbility disability and disparities in mobility disability,\ninformation on both capacity and self-reported difficulty are\nneeded.\nThere are several limitations to this study. Although we\nare able to detect whether there are threshold differences in\nreporting mobility problems for groups defined by demo-\ngraphic characteristics and socioeconomic status, the iden-\ntification of effects in our model comes from two\nassumptions: First, the relatively mild assumption that the\nperformance tests have no effect on the cut-points within\ngroups defined by the background characteristics and sec-\nond, the stronger assumption that the background character-\nistics have no effect on true latent mobility after controlling\nfor the performance measures. If the objective tests fail to\nfully control for the effects of background characteristics,\nour estimates of cut-point shifts may reflect in part some\ndifferences in underlying mobility capacity. On the other\nhand, studies that ignore cut-point shifts attribute all ob-\nserved differences to underlying capacity. We are also lim-\nited by having few respondents who reported difficulty with\nwalking across a room or transferring in or out of a bed or\nchair, so we could not run the statistical models for these\noutcomes. Both of these activities frequently appear in ag-\ning surveys; it would be useful to understand whether there\nare differences in reporting behaviors for these tasks. Fi-\nnally, because cultural differences in the aging experience\naffect analyses of cut-point shifts, these results cannot be\ngeneralized beyond the older Taiwanese population. The re-\nsults do indicate, however, that future analyses of disability\ndisparities in other settings need to account for or address\nthe potential effects of reporting heterogeneity.\nMobility disability is most often assessed using self-\nreported responses to questions that ask respondents to indi-\ncate how much difficulty they have doing such tasks as\nacross the room, and the like. In general, the criteria respon-\ndents use to decide and report whether they have difficulty\nwith an activity are unknown. Two individuals with the\nsame underlying mobility ability, therefore, may have dif-\nferent perceptions of what constitutes difficulty, resulting in\ndifferent reports of the level of difficulty with mobility\ntasks. The analyses presented here control for measured\nperformance tests to detect whether perceptions of mobility\ndifficulty vary across population subgroups. In general,\nwith the exception of threshold differences across age\ngroups, we find relatively little evidence of cut-point shifts\nfor reporting mobility difficulty or inability among older\nTaiwanese adults. Therefore, within this population, differ-\nences in mobility limitations by sex, socioeconomic status,\nmarital status, or urban residence are more likely to reflect\ndifferences in mobility capacity rather than differences in\nreporting behaviors stemming from varying perceptions of\ndifficulty. The usual loss of mobility with age, however, re-\nflects both a decrease in capacity and a lowering of the\nthreshold for reporting difficulty.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Demography and Epidemiology Unit of\nthe Behavioral and Social Research Program of the National Institute of\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material can be found at: http://psychsocgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/\n"
