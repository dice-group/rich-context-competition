Is the adverse effect\nof lower socioeconomic status uniform across the entire distribution of health status?\nDesign: Nationally representative telephone survey of the US population in 1996.\nSetting: 60 US metropolitan and rural areas.\nParticipants: 47 076 adult respondents to the community tracking study.\nMain outcome measures: Self rated physical and mental health status, measured by the Short Form-12\ninstrument.\nResults: There is considerable variability in self rated health within socioeconomic strata and that\nvariability increases in a step-wise fashion at each lower stratum of income. Most of the increased\nvariability is accounted for by changes in the middle and lower (10th, 25th, and 50th centiles) rather than\nthe upper (75th and 90th) portions of the distribution. A resilient subgroup of lower socioeconomic status\npeople seems to maintain excellent self rated health throughout life, while a more vulnerable lower\nsocioeconomic status group experiences rapid deterioration in health status as people reach middle age.\nConclusions: Within the population level social structuring of health there are differences in individual\nresilience and vulnerability that are amenable to further exploration and potential modification.\nThere is an inverse gradient between socioeconomic status\n(SES) and health across the spectrum of health condi-\ntions, including diseases,1 risk factors,1 emotional dis-\nimprovements in public hygiene and medical care, health\ndisparities across socioeconomic levels have persisted and\nevenwidened.8 Reducing health disparities has risen near the\ntop of the US public health agenda, as reflected in Healthy\nIn the extensive literature on socioeconomic health\ndisparities, less attention has been paid to examining the\nvariability in health outcomes within social or economic\ngroups.10 The approach taken by most studies of SES and\nhealth has been to compare health across levels of SES,\nsummarising the health experience within each SES stratum\nby a single measure, such as mean or rate. This method\npermits an overall comparison among SES strata, but\nconceals the variability in outcomes within SES groups.\nHowever, understanding the extent of this within group\nvariability in outcomes--and its sources--is an important\nstep in tackling health disparities, for two reasons. The first\nissue, relevant to public health interventions, is assessing the\nrange of variation in individual vulnerability to the effects of\nadverse socioeconomic conditions. Because of differences in\ntheir genetics, psychosocial circumstances, and other factors,\nindividuals are likely to differ in their susceptibility to the\nadverse effects of the SES gradient. The interaction of these\nfactors with SES may generate significant differences at both\nextremes of susceptibility. A resilient subgroup of disadvan-\ntaged persons that maintains good health might have\nimportant lessons to teach us about those who have\nsuccessfully weathered disadvantage and the factors that\nexplain their success. Conversely, especially vulnerable\nsubpopulations that suffer disproportionately from social\nstresses may require special interventions. Thus, by focusing\non the heterogeneity within SES groups we can refine our\nunderstanding of how individual factors interact with SES to\nproduce population outcomes.\nThe second reason to study heterogeneity in health\noutcomes is to further our theoretical models of social\ncausation. An illustrative example of how understanding\nvariability can trigger theoretical insights is provided by\nresearch on aging. A robust finding in aging research is that,\nwithin the general pattern of age related declines in physical\nfunctioning, variability in many physiological parameters\nincreases with age.11 To explain those patterns, current\ntheoretical explanations posit that aging results from the\naccumulation over time of random (``stochastic'') damage to\nstructural and biochemical mechanisms for maintenance and\nrepair of physiological systems, eventually resulting in\nfailures of homeostasis.12 13 The damage derives from both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors, but its random progress means\nthat a population of aging people becomes more hetero-\ngeneous over time.\nIn a parallel way, a coherent theory of social causation\nmust account not only for observed social gradients but also\nfor patterns of heterogeneity within those gradients. For\nexample, suppose that within the known association between\neducation and overall health status, less educated groups\ndisplay less variability in health status than better educated\ngroups. From a psychosocial theory perspective,14 perhaps the\nsegregation of low income persons into relatively homo-\ngeneous adverse environments translates into exposure to a\nrelatively homogeneous set of psychosocial stressors, leading\nto relatively homogenous health outcomes. An alternative\nexplanation might posit that the higher mortality rate in low\nincome populations truncates the bottom of their health dis-\ntributions in population surveys, thereby reducing observable\nAbbreviations: SES, socioeconomic status; CTS, community tracking\nstudy; PCS, Physical Component Summary; MCS, Mental Component\nSummary\nwww.jech.com\nheterogeneity. This last hypothesis would also predict that\nlow income populations' diminished variability would\nbecome more evident in middle aged and older populations,\nas the force of differential mortality grew.\nOn the other hand, suppose the opposite to be true, that\nless educated groups display more variability in health status.\nAgain, psychosocial theory would postulate that greater\nvariability would emerge from exposure to more hetero-\ngeneous patterns of psychosocial stress. Another possibility is\nthat, given a range of individual susceptibility to the effects of\nsocioeconomic position, individual vulnerability functions as\nan ``enabler'' of premature illness in unfavourable environ-\nments. This last scenario would predict that lower SES would\ndemonstrate a greater effect on lowering the floor of poor\nhealth status outcomes (by sickening vulnerable people) than\non lowering the ceiling of best possible outcomes (because it\nis harder to sicken resilient people).\nIn this study we explore the distribution of a functional\nhealth status measure (the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm\u00ad12 (SF-12)) both within and across levels of socio-\neconomic status in order to understand the range of possible\noutcomes associated with position in the SES spectrum. Is\nthere evidence that certain subpopulations within a given\nSES stratum are more resilient or vulnerable than others? Is\nthe effect of lower SES on health status to lower the ceiling of\nbest possible outcomes? Or does lower SES pull down the\nfloor of worst possible outcomes? Or both? And what is the\nnet effect on overall variability in health status?\nMETHODS\nData source\nThis is a secondary analysis of data from the community\ntracking study (CTS) that was administered to a stratified\nrandom sample of the US population between July 1996 and\nsurvey; provision was made to sample persons without\ntelephones by providing them with cellular telephones with\nwhich to access the survey. Survey questions covered\ndemographics, health insurance, satisfaction with health\ncare, use of health services, and health status. The response\nrate was 65%. Responses from persons between the ages of 18\nThe CTS imputed missing data for certain variables using\nsequential hot-deck imputation methods.16 Six per cent of the\nhealth status data and about 1% of the income data used in\nthis study had been imputed. Complete data were available\nfor age.\nMeasures\nThe health status questions administered included the SF-12\nquestionnaire,17 a validated health status instrument with\ntwo subscales covering mental and physical health status.\nThe overall SF-12 score and its subscales are all scaled to have\na mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 10. The Physical\nComponent Summary (PCS) score and the Mental\nComponent Summary (MCS) subscales are the primary\noutcomes examined for this study. The PCS is constructed\nfrom SF-12 items covering physical limitations, role func-\ntioning, pain, and general health status. The MCS is\nconstructed from items on social functioning, role limitations\nattributable to emotional problems, and mental health\n(psychological distress and psychological wellbeing.\nAnalysis\nThe survey population was divided into quintiles of family\nthe age by income matrix, we then calculated mean SF-12\nPCS and MCS scores and the PCS and MCS scores corres-\nhealth status score distribution for that cell. Twenty four of\n400 respondents. All analyses applied person level weights\nappropriate to derive estimates for the US population.\nWe evaluated the variability of physical and mental health\nstatus within income strata in several ways. Firstly, we\ncreated a series of box and whisker plots of the PCS and MCS\ncentile scores within the age by income cells. The centre line\nof each box and whisker plot displays the median score; the\nbox's lower and upper ends display the 25th and 75th\ncentiles, respectively; the lower and upper whiskers closest to\nthe box display the 10th and 90th centiles, respectively; and\nthe whisker ends display the extreme values of the distribu-\ntions (though outliers more than three box lengths from the\nedge of the box have been trimmed). Secondly, to quantify\nwithin group variation, we calculated the 90th\u00ad10th centile\nrange, by subtracting the 10th centile score in each cell from\nthe 90th centile score. As a further measure of within group\nvariation, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean\nwithin each age by income cell.\nWe compared the between group variability in physical and\nmental health status scores among income strata with two\napproaches. To quantify between group variation by income,\nwe calculated the difference in health status centile scores\nbetween the lowest and highest income quintiles. For\nthe lowest income quintile was subtracted from the 90th\ncentile score in the highest income quintile. The calculation\nSecondly, a Levene's test18 for equality of variances was used\nto evaluate the null hypothesis of equal variances for PCS or\nMCS scores across income quintiles.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the sample sizes by age group and income\nquintile. The mean SF-12 PCS score for the CTS sample was\n50.0 with a standard deviation of 9.9. The mean MCS score\nwas 52.1 with a standard deviation of 9.6. PCS and MCS\nscores displayed only a weak correlation (r = 0.069;\nKey points\nN Numerous studies have reported the inverse gradient\nbetween socioeconomic position and health.\nN Less work has been done to understand the population\nvariability in health outcomes within socioeconomic\nlevels and the extent to which there is resilience or\nvulnerability to the adverse effects of lower socio-\neconomic position.\nN Lower income groups exhibit more variability in health\nstatus than higher income groups. This increased\nvariability stems more from changes in the floor of\nthe health status distribution than from the ceiling. For\nexample, the best 25% of health status scores in lower\nincome quintiles are virtually identical to the best 25%\nof scores in high income quintiles, while the middle and\nlower segments of the health status distribution are\nmarkedly shifted downwards in lower income persons,\nbeginning in early adulthood.\nN Future research should explore the sources and\nimplications of this differential vulnerability to the\nadverse effects of socioeconomic position.\nwww.jech.com\nFigures 1A and 1B display box and whisker plots for the\nPCS and MCS scores by age and income quintile. Several\nobservations can be made from the box plots. Firstly, self\nreported physical health status was positively related to\nincome and generally declined with age, although there was\nan upward trend in mean PCS scores in the lowest income\nhealth status was also positively related to income, but in\ncontrast with physical health status, generally increased after\nThe second observation is that within group variability in\nphysical and mental health status increases stepwise as\nincome level decreases. A measure of this variability, the\nrange between the 90th and 10th centiles within each age by\nincome group, is displayed in figures 2A and 2B. Variability in\nboth physical and mental health status in middle age (ages\nin the highest income quintile. Making the same low-high\nincome comparisons using the standard deviation as an\nalternate yardstick for variability yields differences of 63%\u00ad\n75% in variability in middle age. A Levene's test evaluating\nthe null hypothesis of no statistical differences among the\nfive income specific variances within each age interval was\nrejected at p,0.001 for both PCS and MCS scores.\nThe third observation from the box plots is that the greater\noverall variability in lower income quintiles stems more from\nvariability in the lower centiles (floor) of health status scores\nthan from the upper centiles (ceiling). As elaborated in\nfigures 3A and 3B--which now focus on between group\nvariability--substantial differences in the 10th and 25th\ncentiles of PCS and MCS scores among income quintiles are\nalready apparent at age 18\u00ad24 and these changes are\nmagnified over the ensuing three decades. In contrast, the\n90th and 75th centiles of PCS and MCS scores show little\nchange among income quintiles. In general, the maximal\ndifferences between the lowest and highest quintiles are\nDISCUSSION\nConsiderable variability in age specific health status is\nevident within SES groups. Although health status is strongly\nrelated to socioeconomic status, a subgroup of lower income\npersons of all ages demonstrates high health status scores.\nThe overall pattern displays a progressive elasticity of the\nhealth status distribution with respect to income: the largest\neffect of lower socioeconomic position is in lowering the floor\nof worst possible outcomes, while having an intermediate\neffect on the middle of the distribution, and only minimal\neffect on lowering the ceiling of best possible outcomes. The\neffect on the floor of the distribution is large (the 10th centile\nof PCS or MCS in the lowest income group being 7\u00ad20 points\nlower than the highest income group), impairing physical\nhealth status to a degree greater than that observed with\nmajor physical illness. For example, in the medical outcomes\nstudy, the PCS score averaged 8.67 points lower in those with\nserious physical illness than in those with minor medical\nThe degree of variability in health status is itself strongly\nrelated to SES; at each lower level of income, variability\nprogressively increases. In middle aged persons the range of\nhealth status encompassed by the 90th and 10th centiles in\nthe poorest quintile was twice that in the most affluent\nquintile. The observed patterns are similar for both physical\nand mental health status. The income differences in\nvariability peak in middle age.\nCorrectly interpreting these findings depends on under-\nstanding the sources of variability in health outcomes and\nparticularly why that variability might increase with lower\nSES. We propose that a useful conceptual model might be a\n``statistical mechanics of health.'' Statistical mechanics is the\nbranch of physics concerned with deriving the macroscopic\nproperties of physical systems from the aggregate probabil-\nistic behaviour of large numbers of microscopic units such as\natoms and molecules. For example, although the motion of\nany individual gas molecule is unpredictable, the law of large\nnumbers makes the overall distribution of air molecules in a\nroom very predictable. Applied to social epidemiology,\nstatistical mechanics can help us model how population\npatterns of illness emerge from individual level events.\nAlthough the health trajectory of any individual cannot be\npredicted with certainty, large numbers of persons exposed to\ngradients of risk-producing social and physical environments\ngenerate the observed social gradients in morbidity and\nmortality. Broad population level forces, social, economic,\nand cultural, set the parameters of exposure (What kinds of\nrisks? At what frequency and intensity?) to risk producing\nsocial and physical environments that determine overall\ndisease prevalence. The contribution of social epidemiology\nhas largely been to describe the relation between these\nadverse social circumstances (for example, neighbourhood\nenvironment, housing, diet, recreation, job control) and\nhealth, with individual SES often serving as a proxy for a\nset of socially stratified life circumstances.19\nIn the statistical mechanics of health, the societal struc-\nturing of experience progressively exposes persons at each\nlower level of SES to a higher probability of adverse circum-\nother pathways results in premature morbidity and mortality.\nBut within those macro patterns, there is heterogeneity\nwithin levels of SES that needs explanation, and we will\nconsider three possible sources of heterogeneity. The first\nsource possibility is that macro level social structuring could\nbe, by itself, the major determinant of within SES group\nvariability in health outcomes. Within any SES stratum,\nsignificant differences in the political, social, cultural, and\neconomic characteristics of specific areas will produce\nheterogeneity in outcomes. A key question, however, given\nthe empirical results of this study, is whether there is reason\nto expect that heterogeneity in social environments should\nincrease as SES decreases. In fact, there is reason to expect\nthe opposite. Greater affluence offers choices to live up or\nTable 1 Sample size (un-weighted) by age category and income group\nIncome quintile\nVariations in health status 383\nwww.jech.com\ndown the scale of living environments, depending on how\npeople choose to spend their money, whereas lower income\ngenerally can buy entry into only a limited set of living\nenvironments. The source of heterogeneity at lower income\nlevels is therefore more probably attributable other factors.\nThe second candidate source of variability is individual\ncharacteristics. Unlike gas molecules, individuals obviously\ndiffer in many important respects, and the variable health\ntrajectory of any individual at a given level of SES may arise\nfrom individual differences in genetics,23 24 childhood develop-\nment, social support,25 and psychological traits such as sense of\ncontrol.26 (The distinction between macro and individual\nfactors is analogous to Geoffrey Rose's distinction between\nthe determinants of prevalence and the determinants of\nFigure 1 (A) Physical Component Summary box and whisker plots by age and income quintile. (B) Mental Component Summary box and whisker\nplots by age and income quintile.\nwww.jech.com\nincidence27). These individual susceptibility factors can either\nbuffer or exacerbate the effect of socioeconomic position, and\nwe hypothesise that the variability in health status outcomes\ntherefore emerges from the interaction between socioeco-\nnomic standing and these individual level factors.\nSocioeconomic position will have greater effect on health\noutcomes in susceptible persons.\nPresupposing that individual susceptibility factors are\nevenly distributed by SES (as seems to be the case for\ngenetics,28 though highly structured caste societies may prove\nan exception; see Bamshad et al29), the interaction between\nSES and individual characteristics would be linear; if,\nhowever, some individual susceptibility factors are also\nsocially structured into a gradient, as other studies demon-\nstrate,1 30 then a non-linear, multiplicative effect of SES on\nhealth would be evident. The social epidemiology literature\nsuggests such a non-linear effect.\nThe third potential source of increased individual level\nvariability in health within lower socioeconomic groups is a\ndirect physiological effect suggested by the literature on\naging. Current theories of aging view it as process without a\ngenetically determined blueprint (because aging occurs after\nreproduction and is therefore not subject to selection factors\nfor reproductive success), but rather attributable to the\ncumulative effects over time of randomly occurring damage\nto structural and biochemical maintenance systems.12 13 As\nthese maintenance systems fail, the organism becomes\nsusceptible to a broad range of physiological insults from\neither environmental or internal sources. The observable\nsignature of failing homeostasis is the robust observation that\nvariability in many physiological parameters increases with\nThe parallels between susceptibility observed in aging\npersons and those with lower socioeconomic status are\nprovocative, including vulnerability to a wide range of\npathophysiologically distinct morbidities and the way in\nwhich lower SES groups tend to resemble higher SES groups\na decade or so older on many health indicators.31 A possible\nmechanism linking adverse social circumstances and mor-\nbidity is that lower SES persons' higher rate of exposure to\nenvironmental and physiological stresses accelerates and/or\nexploits the cumulative stochastic damage of aging.\nFigure 2 (A) Differences between the 90th and 10th centiles of Physical Component Summary scores by age and income quintile. (B) Differences\nbetween the 90th and 10th centiles of Mental Component Summary scores by age and income quintile.\nVariations in health status 385\nwww.jech.com\nThe strengths of the study are that we analyse a large,\nnationally representative sample of the US population, apply\na well validated measure of health status, the SF-12, and\nexamine a phenomenon that is usually ignored in the health\ndisparities literature--the variability in health outcomes\nwithin socioeconomic strata.\nAt least five potential limitations apply to these results.\nFirstly, we applied a cross sectional design to the inherently\nlongitudinal problem of age related declines in health status.\nAlthough recent data demonstrate that within person\nchanges in population health status measured by the SF-36\nare greater than those calculated from cross sectional data,32\nwe cannot verify from our data that individuals track\nconsistently at a given centile of the health status distribu-\ntion. In fact, we hypothesise that a degree of artefact from the\ncross sectional design is observable as the increase in physical\nincome quintile. Higher mortality rates among the less\naffluent selectively cull out those with worse health status,\nleaving a healthier low income group available for sampling.\nThis hypothesis could be tested with a longitudinal cohort.\nSecondly, we used income as our sole stratifying variable\nfor SES, and income is sensitive to health status, raising the\npotential for reverse causation, wherein poor health leads to\nlow income rather than vice versa. To assess this, we repeated\nour analyses using education as the stratifying variable and\nthe patterns were unchanged.\nThirdly, it is possible that ceiling effects on the SF-12\nobscured our ability to detect differences in health status at\nthe highest reaches of the health status scale. This concern is\nlessened by the observation that the 90th centile scores on\nthe SF-12 PCS and MCS were still 10 points below the\nmaximum scores in the sample, but the scales may not\nadequately differentiate between gradations of excellent\nhealth. Fourthly, we examined only the association between\nSES and self rated health--it is possible that other health\noutcomes will not demonstrate the same pattern we have\ndescribed here. Fifthly, respondents' estimates of their\nAge\nA\nPCS range (high\u00adlow income)\nAge\nB\nMCS range (high\u00adlow income)\nFigure 3 (A) Differences between the lowest and highest income quintiles in the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th centiles of the Physical Component\nSummary scores, by age.

Perhaps those\nwho score high on the SF-12 are predisposed to view life\nthrough rose coloured lenses, no matter what their objective\nlevel of functioning.33\nIn summary, we find that the best 25% of health status\nscores in lower income quintiles are virtually identical to the\nbest 25% of scores in high income quintiles; it is the middle\nand lower segments of the health status distribution that are\nmarkedly shifted downwards in lower income persons,\nbeginning in early adulthood. There seems to be a resilient\nsubgroup of lower SES people whose self rated health\nremains excellent throughout life, while vulnerable persons\nof lower SES see a rapid deterioration in health status as they\nreach middle age. The findings remind us that within the\n``deterministic'' social structuring of health there are differ-\nences in individual resilience and vulnerability that are\namenable to further exploration and potential modification.\nUnderstanding these individual-environment interactions--\nthe ``ecology'' of social causation--will deepen our under-\nstanding of social epidemiology.\nAuthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nR L Ferrer, R Palmer, Department of Family and Community Medicine\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio,\nTexas, USA\nREFERENCES\n1 Marmot M, Davey Smith G, Stansfeld S, et al.
