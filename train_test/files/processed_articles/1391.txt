Fruit and vegetable consumption was obtained from a food frequency question-\nnaire; the percentages of total calories from fat and saturated fat were obtained from a 24-h food\nrecall. Physical activity was based on self report during the month before the survey.\nRESULTS -- Of individuals with type 2 diabetes, 31% reported no regular physical activity\nand another 38% reported less than recommended levels of physical activity. Sixty-two percent\nof respondents ate fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Almost two thirds of\nthe respondents consumed 30% of their daily calories from fat and 10% of total calories from\nsaturated fat. Mexican Americans and individuals over the age of 65 years ate a higher number\nof fruits and vegetables and a lower percentage of total calories from fat. Lower income and\nincreasing age were associated with physical inactivity. Thirty-six percent of the sample were\noverweight and another 46% were obese.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The majority of individuals with type 2 diabetes were overweight, did\nnot engage in recommended levels of physical activity, and did not follow dietary guidelines for\nfat and fruit and vegetable consumption. Additional measures are needed to encourage regular\nphysical activity and improve dietary habits in this population.\nDiet and exercise are considered im-\nportant components of the treat-\nment strategy for adults with type 2\ndiabetes. Appropriate use of diet and ex-\nercise can improve insulin sensitivity and\nglycemic control and decrease the need\nfor oral medications or insulin (1,2). Al-\nthough there is some controversy over the\noptimal diet for adults with type 2 diabe-\ntes (high fiber, glycemic index ap-\nproaches, low versus moderate fat) (3,4),\nthere is a consensus to increase consump-\ntion of fruits and vegetables and decrease\ndaily consumption of saturated fats (4,5).\nRegular, moderate-intensity physical ac-\ntivity for 30 min at least 5 times per week\nis recommended for most Americans (6).\nPrevious studies suggest that individ-\nuals with diabetes may not follow recom-\nmended guidelines for diet and exercise,\nalthough there have been no nationally\nrepresentative U.S. studies examining\nnutritional intake among adults with type\nwith diabetes, the most frequently\nreported barriers in diabetes self-\nmanagement were adherence to diet and\nexercise (7). Only 60% of individuals\nwith diabetes in the National Health In-\nterview Survey report that they \"follow a\ndiabetic diet\" (8), and several non-U.S.\nstudies have reported that actual nutrient\nintake among individuals with diabetes\nmay be suboptimal (9\u00ad12). In addition,\nthe majority of individuals in the U.S.,\nincluding those with diabetes, are not\nmeeting national physical activity goals\nThe purpose of this study is to de-\nscribe both dietary intake and physical ac-\ntivity from a nationally representative\nsample of adults with type 2 diabetes. We\nassessed compliance with national guide-\nlines for physical activity (6,14) and total\nfat, saturated fat, and fruit and vegetable\nconsumption (4,5). In addition, we exam-\nined the association of socioeconomic fac-\ntors with diet and exercise practices. This\ninformation will be critical to assess the\neffectiveness of current clinical practice\nand help identify groups at high risk for\npoor dietary intake and physical inactiv-\nity.\nMETHODS -- The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), was conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics at 89\n1994. The survey used a stratified, multi-\nstage probability cluster design with over-\nsampling of Mexican Americans, African\nAmericans, and the elderly to ensure min-\nimum sample sizes of these populations.\n                                                \nFrom the 1Primary and Specialty Medical Care Service, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle; the\n2Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle; the 3Epidemiologic Research and Information\nCenter, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle; and the 4Department of Epidemiology and Health\nServices, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Karin Nelson, MD, MSHS, VA Puget Sound Health Care\nkarin.nelson@med.va.gov.\nAbbreviations: BRFSS, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; NHANES III, the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\nC l i n i c a l C a r e / E d u c a t i o n / N u t r i t i o n\nThe survey consists of multiple compo-\nnents including a household interview, a\nphysical examination, and laboratory\ntests. Descriptions of the standardized\nprotocols used for participant recruit-\nment, interviews, and examinations have\nbeen previously published (15).\nInformation on a medical history of\ndiabetes was obtained during the house-\nhold interview among all adults over the\n1,608 adults reported a diagnosis of dia-\nbetes. For this analysis, we excluded\nwomen who were diagnosed with diabe-\ntes only during pregnancy (n  105) and\nindividuals with type 1 diabetes, defined\nas those who were diagnosed at 30 years\nof age and who had continuous insulin\nuse since diagnosis (n  23). The remain-\ning 1,480 respondents were considered to\nhave type 2 diabetes. Based on previous\nstudies demonstrating that self-reported\ndiagnosis is valid and reliable, we believe\nthis sample accurately represents a na-\ntional population of adults with type 2\nsidered to be treated with diet alone if\nthey reported taking neither oral hypogly-\ncemic medications nor insulin.\nStanding height and weight were ob-\ntained during the physical exam for 1,312\nindividuals and were used to calculate\nBMI. Individuals were considered obese if\ntheir BMI was 30 kg/m2 and were con-\nsidered overweight if their BMI was 25\u00ad\nvalues were\ncollected during the laboratory exam and\nDietary assessment was based on data\nfrom both the food frequency question-\nfrequency information was collected dur-\ning the household interview and has been\nshown to be a valid and reliable method\nfor assessing average consumption (19).\nRespondents were asked how often over\nthe past month they had eaten the speci-\nfied food items. Foods were reported as\nnumber of items consumed per day, per\nweek, per month, or never. All frequen-\ncies of consumption variables were stan-\ndardized as times per day using the\nconversion factor of 30.4 days/month. If\nthe frequency of consumption was re-\nported as \"never,\" the value was recorded\nas zero. For this analysis, we created a\ncombined variable for daily fruit and veg-\netable intake that includes all portions\nfrom both the fruit and vegetable groups.\nThe fruit group included all fresh, frozen,\ndried, and canned fruit and fruit juices\nbut excluded fruit drinks. The vegetable\ngroup included all raw or cooked fresh,\nfrozen, or canned vegetables and juices\n(19). Information on the percentage of\ndaily calories from total fat and saturated\nfat was based on a 24-h food recall inter-\nview. We used the cut points of five fruits\nand vegetables per day, 30% of daily cal-\nories from fat, and 10% of daily calories\nfrom saturated fat based on recommenda-\ntions from national guidelines (4,5).\nIndividuals were classified as inactive\nif they did not report engaging in any of\nthe following activities during the previ-\nous month: walking, jogging, bike riding,\nswimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthen-\nics, gardening, lifting weights, or other\nphysical activity outside of their occupa-\ntion. Physical activity was classified as\nmoderate or vigorous intensity based on\nmetabolic equivalent intensity levels (21).\nIndividuals were considered to fulfill na-\ntional recommendations for physical ac-\ntivity if they reported five or more\nepisodes per week of moderate-intensity\nphysical activity or three or more episodes\nper week of vigorous-intensity physical\nactivity (6).

Multivariate logistic analyses\nwere used to assess the independent asso-\nciations of socioeconomic and health\ncharacteristics with obtaining no regular\nphysical activity, having a diet high in sat-\nurated fats, and reporting low consump-\ntion of fruits and vegetables.\nRESULTS -- Table 1 displays the pop-\nulation characteristics from this nation-\nally representative sample of individuals\nwith type 2 diabetes.

Of individuals who\nreported no difficulty in walking a quar-\nter-mile or in walking 10 steps without\nresting, 43% reported insufficient physi-\ncal activity. BMI was not associated with\nlevel of physical activity. In a multivariate\nlogistic regression, age  65 years, female\nsex, and low income were independently\nassociated with inactivity (Table 4). Phys-\nical inactivity was not associated with\nlevel of education, BMI, or type of diabe-\ntes treatment in multivariate analyses.\nWhen ability to walk a quarter-mile was\nincluded in this multivariate model, age\nwas no longer independently associated\nwith reporting no physical activity (data\nnot shown).\nBivariate associations between nutri-\ntional intake and socioeconomic and\nhealth variables are displayed in Table 3.\nIndividuals 65 years were less likely to\nconsume a high-fat diet and more likely to\nreport eating more than five servings of\nfruits and vegetables per day. There were\nno associations between the three nutri-\ntion intake variables and sex, education,\nor type of diabetes treatment. In multivar-\niate analysis, individuals 65 years and\nMexican Americans were less likely to\nconsume 10% of their daily calories\nfrom saturated fats and eat fewer than five\nservings of fruits and vegetables per day\n(Table 4).\nCONCLUSIONS -- The majority of\nadults with type 2 diabetes in this nation-\nally representative sample ate a diet high\nin saturated fat and consumed fewer than\nthe minimum daily recommended serv-\nings of fruits and vegetables. In addition,\nalmost one third reported no regular\nphysical activity, and another 38% re-\nported insufficient levels of physical activ-\nity. Higher consumption of fruits and\nvegetables and diets lower in fat were\nmore common among individuals over\nthe age of 65 years and among Mexican\nAmericans. Older individuals, women,\nand those with low incomes were more\nlikely to report no regular exercise. The\nmajority of this sample was overweight or\nobese, consistent with recent reports\nabout the increasing prevalence of both\ndiabetes and obesity in the U.S. (25).\nThe main limitations to this data are\nthe potential biases introduced by the\nself-report of food frequency data, the\n24-h food recall, and level of physical ac-\ntivity. In addition, we do not know the\nactual duration of physical activity. Previ-\nous studies have shown that white-collar\nworkers were more active during leisure\nTable 3--Bivariate associations with dietary intake in adults with type 2 diabetes in NHANES III, n  1,480\n30% of daily calories\nfrom fat\n10% of total calories\nfrom saturated fats\n5 servings of fruits or\nvegetables/day\nAge (years)\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nIncome (% of federal poverty level)\nEducation\nBMI (kg/m2)\nDiabetes treatment\nData are % (95% CI).

Be-\ncause we do not have information on non-\nleisure physical activity, total activity\nlevels may be underestimated. Despite\nthese limitations, our study is consistent\nwith other national data from the general\nU.S. population regarding poor dietary\nquality (27\u00ad29) and low levels of physical\nactivity (30). The most recent Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\nsurvey reported that almost one third of\nadults did not engage in any physical ac-\ntivity and another third were not regularly\nactive (30). In the National Health Inter-\nview Survey from 1990, only one third of\npeople with diabetes reported exercising\nAlthough poor nutrient intake among\nindividuals with diabetes has been re-\nported outside of the U.S. (9\u00ad12), we are\nnot aware of any data on the dietary intake\nfrom a nationally representative sample of\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes in the\nU.S. Our results are consistent with stud-\nies of dietary intake in the general popu-\nlation suggesting that a majority of\nAmericans are consuming an inadequate\nquantity of fruits and vegetables (25,31).\nOnly one quarter of the participants inter-\nviewed in the most recent BRFSS con-\nsumed the recommended five servings of\nfruits and vegetables (25). In addition,\nour data regarding healthier diets among\nMexican Americans are consistent with\nprevious reports suggesting that on aver-\nage, Latinos have healthier diets than\nPrevious studies have reported low\nlevels of physical activity (13) and higher\nlevels of disability among individuals with\ndiabetes than in the general population\n(34). Disability among individuals with\ndiabetes is primarily from coronary heart\ndisease and obesity, followed by poor vi-\nsion (34). For individuals with significant\ndisability, an individualized program for\nphysical activity is essential. In our study,\nindividuals who reported the inability to\nwalk a quarter-mile were less likely to re-\nport regular exercise. However, 40% of\nthose who reported that they could walk a\nquarter-mile engaged in insufficient\nphysical activity and could be an impor-\ntant target population for interventions to\nincrease exercise activity.\nHealthy diets and regular physical ac-\ntivity can improve glycemic control\namong individuals with type 2 diabetes\n(35\u00ad38). Intervention studies have shown\nthat physical activity plays an important\nrole in glucose tolerance and insulin sen-\nsitivity (35). A recent meta-analysis found\nthat, on average, moderate-intensity\nphysical activity can reduce HbA1c\nby\n0.6% among individuals with type 2 dia-\nbetes (39). According to data from the\nU.K. Prospective Diabetes Study, this is a\nlevel sufficient to reduce the risk of micro-\nvascular complications by 22% (40). Life-\nstyle modification involving nutrition and\nphysical activity also has the potential to\nimprove cardiovascular risk factors such\nas blood pressure and lipid levels (39,41).\nBecause physical activity and suboptimal\ndietary behaviors are associated (42), tar-\ngeting both exercise and diet may be\nneeded for the optimal treatment of indi-\nviduals with type 2 diabetes.\nA recent systematic review of diabetes\nself-management studies suggests that tai-\nTable 4--Multivariate logistic regression of physical activity and nutritional intake\nNo regular physical activity\n10% of daily calories from\nsaturated fat\n5 servings of fruits or\nvegetables/day\nRace/ethnicity\nWhite Reference Reference Reference\nIncome (% of federal poverty level)\n301% Reference Reference Reference\nEducation\nCollege Reference Reference Reference\nBMI (kg/m2)\n25 Reference Reference Reference\nDiabetes treatment\nDiet alone Reference Reference Reference\nData are odds ratios (95% CI).

Increasing physical activity levels\ncan be achieved by a variety of means,\nincluding public health programs and\ncommunity-based interventions (14). Pri-\nmary care\u00adbased physical activity coun-\nseling is also moderately effective (44),\nalthough few studies have been specifi-\ncally designed for individuals with type 2\ndiabetes. The current challenge is trans-\nlating research findings into routine clin-\nical practice and public health efforts to\nimprove health outcomes for all individ-\nuals with type 2 diabetes (45).\n"
