Yet industrial policy change has been a recurring\nfeature of political discourse in Britain since 2008, as demonstrated principally by the\n`rebalancing' narrative espoused largely by Conservative politicians and particularly by\nthen Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne's now infamous rhetoric on `the march\nof the makers'. In general, this discourse extols the importance of rebuilding Britain's\nmanufacturing sector, therefore suggesting the need for a stronger focus by government on\nsupporting manufacturing industries through industrial policy (Berry and Hay, 2016;\nFroud et al., 2011). The discourse appears to have been matched by a plethora of policy\ninitiatives emanating principally from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\n(BIS) (led under the 2010\u00ad2015 coalition government by the Liberal Democrat cabinet\nminister Vince Cable) which suggest new directions in British industrial policy in favour\nof a stronger role for government in relation to the market, and the value of a sectoral as\nwell as horizontal approach to industrial policy. Although the Conservative Party's interest\nin industrial policy arguably waned after the 2015 election, if not before, Theresa May\nappeared to make industrial policy one of her key priorities in her first speech after replac-\ning David Cameron as Prime Minister following the European Union (EU) referendum.\nBritish policy-makers are claiming that industrial policy is changing or will change in\nresponse to economic crisis, yet scholarly interest in this possibility has been muted. This\narticle is an attempt to fill this gap. Industrial policy is often defined with reference to the\ndistinction between `horizontal'approaches (improving the general business environment\nacross the whole economy) and `vertical' approaches (supporting a single set of indus-\ntries). The distinction has in fact been a significant feature of policy-making discourse in\nBritain, especially recently, but it should be pointed out that this article assumes the latter\nis more appropriate in terms of defining industrial policy. Industrial policy essentially\ninvolves deliberately favouring particular industries over others, irrespective of market\nsignals. This approach will involve favouring and indeed empowering some private eco-\nnomic actors over others, but also represents a means by which the behaviour of these\nactors is kept in check, as they are incentivised to pursue public goods. The public good\nat the heart of industrial policy is essentially productivity. It is for this reason that support-\ning manufacturing industries is at the core of most meaningful industrial policy defini-\ntions because, irrespective of how well this is captured by statistical typologies, as the\nterm theoretically encompasses all instances of technology being applied to natural\nresources, the sector is the progenitor of productivity growth within capitalist systems\ntrial policy in some ways (especially, as explored below, in relation to shaping market\nforces), but generally speaking, it is the long-term and risky nature of the investment\nrequired to upgrade manufacturing processes that generates the `market failure' which\nindustrial policy seeks to remedy.\nThe article surveys post-crisis industrial policy in Britain through the prism of Peter\nHall's (1993) institutionalist `three orders of policy change' framework--used to explain\nthe shift from Keynesianism to monetarism in British macroeconomic policy in the late\nchange within financial regulation in Britain. First-order change refers to the revision of\nnumerical or quantitative terms associated with existing policy instruments, and second-\norder change denotes the replacement of these instruments with alternative policy levers.\nThird-order change is largely synonymous with a Kuhnian `paradigm shift' and relates\nboth to the ideas and assumptions that underpin key policy priorities and the ordering of\npriorities within economic statecraft. The three orders of change may occur concurrently\nrather than consecutively; Hall's argument is that processes of first- and second-order\nchange, involving policy learning and entrepreneurship, are necessary before third-order\nchange can be complete. Baker, however, introduces a new variable into the framework,\nbased on the notion that there are `varieties of economic crisis'. Simply, while Hall docu-\nmented policy change during and after the `slow burn' crisis of Keynesianism, involving\nsluggish growth and obstinate inflation in the 1970s, Baker is documenting policy change\nfollowing the `explosive' financial crisis of 2008. As such, he sought to demonstrate that\nthe third-order paradigm shift in financial regulation occurred relatively quickly after the\ncrisis, as elites appeared to agree on the need for macroprudential regulation, but that the\nfirst- and second-order implementation of the related policy instruments has been much\nmore difficult due to contestation by key stakeholders.\nThe focus here on industrial policy allows further reflection upon the difference that\nthe density and status of the institutional arrangements make to the character of policy\nchange and how it is discussed publicly by elites. It is certainly the case that elites have\npronounced significant industrial policy change in the post-crisis period--yet the practi-\ncal significance of the new programmes actually implemented is less clear. The article's\nobjective is to understand what industrial policy change tells us about post-crisis eco-\nnomic statecraft in Britain and what we can learn from this case about the process of\npost-crisis economic policy change in general. It is recognised, however, that unlike mac-\nroeconomic policy and financial regulation, the institutional framework within Britain\naround industrial policy cannot be taken for granted. The analysis here is essentially\ndeveloped through an institutionalist lens since policy is ultimately a function of institu-\ntions but recognises both variations in institutional forms and the political-economic con-\ntexts within which policy-making institutions operate. One of the key, specific concerns\nhere is the role of a particular set of policy-making and delivery bodies within a wider\ninstitutional framework of economic statecraft. This topic necessitates a focus on both the\nmaterial context which shapes hierarchies among institutions and the ideational meanings\ncontained in seemingly technocratic inter-institutional dialogue.\nThe article's most important claim is that in assessing post-crisis economic policy\nchange, we need to assess not only the type of crisis that has seemingly occurred but also\nthe place of the economic activities (and the surrounding policy framework) said to have\nexperienced crisis within the wider model of economic growth. Hall and Baker could take\nfor granted not only that an identifiable institutional framework in the policy area being\nstudied existed but also that the economic activities to which it pertained related to core\nfeatures of the British economy. The fact that this is not the case in relation to manufactur-\ning and industrial policy not only helps us to understand the nature of the change that has\noccurred, it may also paradoxically explain why elites were able to adopt such a radical\npro-manufacturing discourse in the wake of the 2008 crisis: they were able to speak\nfreely, and perhaps somewhat duplicitously, because the possibility of paradigm change\nwithin British industrial policy was so distant, even inconceivable. The discourse on\nindustrial policy may have seemed to invoke radical ideas, but its meaning was ultimately\nconservative insofar as it upheld and perhaps even reinforced the dominant assumptions\nof sound economic management more generally. The article first explores the Hall/Baker\nanalytical framework, in the context of other developments in institutionalist scholarship\nand political economy in general, before examining in depth the development of British\nindustrial policy (and associated discourses) since 2008, with reference to the historical\ncontext of manufacturing decline.\n832 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nPolicy change, institutions and growth models\nPeter Hall's 1993 paper `Policy paradigms, social learning, and the state'has proven to be\na landmark publication in the development of institutionalist thought. Hall developed the\nnotion that policy-making processes are sites of learning, experimentation and entrepre-\nneurship, and inverted conventional wisdom on how paradigm shifts in post-crisis policy\ntransformation may occur, in that such phenomena are shown to precede paradigmatic\nchange as the perception that a crisis is evident takes root among elites. The emergence of\nalternative intellectual frameworks in response to perceived crises is of course part of the\ncontext within which policy learning, experimentation and entrepreneurship occur, but\nthird-order change is only secure once piecemeal and technocratic reforms gain wider\npolitical support, leading to the political elite in general reordering the hierarchy of eco-\nnomic policy goals.\nOf course, Hall's conclusions were based on a single case study, that is, British macro-\neconomic policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as Keynesian instruments were\nreplaced by monetarist instruments. In examining financial regulation following the 2008\ncrisis, Andrew Baker (2015) introduces a variable not substantively considered by Hall,\nthat is, the variety of crisis to which elites are seeking to respond. The crisis of\nKeynesianism was `very much a slow burning long term economic crisis of stagnation'\n2008 crisis, especially in relation to the finance sector (hence its normal designation as a\nfinancial crisis), was `explosive', `dramatic' and `extreme' and related not to a persis-\ntently under-performing economy, but rather an exigent `malfunction' in the financial\ntightening, created both an empirical demonstration of the falsity of the efficient markets\nparadigm that had hitherto underpinned financial regulation and an urgent need for an\nalternative approach to regulation to be enacted.\nWhat quickly emerged was a near-universal endorsement of macroprudential regula-\ntion, principally in the form of capital requirements on financial institutions, among eco-\nnomic policy-makers in Britain (and replicated elsewhere). As such, `the sequencing at\nwork in the case of the macroprudential ideational shift was exactly the reverse of that\n355). However, while third-order change came easily, subsequent first- and second-order\nchange has been slower, with significant debate over the precise details of the new restric-\ntions on financial institutions. As Baker explained in greater depth in an earlier article, the\napplication of new forms of financial regulation has become contested, thereby risking\nthe dilution of the policy content (Baker, 2013; see also Baker and Widmaier, 2014). Yet\nas Baker's earlier analysis and direct engagement with Hall demonstrates, while the pro-\ncess of policy change may be explicable due to the variety of crisis, macroprudential\nregulation is also a very different type of policy change than Hall's monetarist shift, in\nterms of both policy form and content. Indeed, macroprudential regulation actually\nresembles industrial policy as understood here, insofar as it is focused on shaping a par-\nticular industry, both empowering the finance sector (by mitigating its volatility) and\ncurbing the excesses, in the name of public good, that a largely market-based structure\nappears to permit. Ostensibly, macroeconomic policy has no such objectives and focuses\nrather on the environment within which all industries operate. Although it is clearly not\nthe case that monetarism faced no opposition, this perhaps helps to explain how its imple-\nmentation faced a less organised (and perhaps less politically astute) form of resistance.\nBaker's engagement with Hall's approach, two decades on, is clearly cognisant of sub-\nsequent developments within institutionalist theory, including within Hall's own work.\nThe `varieties of capitalism'framework, developed by Hall and David Soskice (2001), has\nrightly been criticised for appearing to endorse a form of rational choice institutionalism,\nwith different capitalist varieties each producing policies consistent with the form of equi-\nlibrium dictated by their institutional configuration (Clift, 2012; Hay, 2005). But it is, at\nroot, an attempt to demonstrate the role of material context in shaping processes of policy\nlearning within institutions and has subsequently been applied as such (see also Streeck,\n2011). Mark Blyth (2013b), one of the leading advocates of constructivist or discursive\ninstitutionalism, argues that the `three orders'framework hinges around a tension between\nHall's rational choice proclivity and a constructivist account of policy innovation which\nemphasises the ontological significance of the ideational realm. For Blyth, the aftermath of\nthe 2008 crisis means the constructivist dimension of Hall's work has been vindicated,\nprecisely because of the absence of paradigmatic change in relation to macroeconomic\npolicy. First- and second-order change in the immediate wake of the crisis did not coalesce\nwith third-order change because the third order, for Blyth, is to some extent autonomous.\nIdeas gain weight within institutionalised processes, but cannot be reduced to them.\nThe key contention of constructivist or discursive institutionalism is that inter-subjective\nideas about economic context are as important as (or constitutive of) the materiality of\neconomic life in terms of shaping economic policy (Blyth, 2002; Hay, 2006; Schmidt,\n2010). The perspective does not simply rest on the assumption that `ideas matter' within\ninstitutionalised environments. The aim is not simply to bring ideas back in, but rather to\nuse ideational analysis to demonstrate the connections between institutional practice (and\nchange) and wider political and economic contexts, insofar as these are reflected in the\nconduct of situated, reflexive agents (cf. Bell, 2011). (Indeed, constructivist institutional-\nism is not immune to the charge that it remains wedded to a materialist ontology in\nway, the operation of institutions is shaped by their (re)production within a particular\nsocio-economic context and also by the agents of (re)production, who will have (both\nconflicting and complementary) ideas about this context, and the nature and purpose of\nthe institutions they are situated within.\nClearly, unless institutionalists are able to bring the wider material and ideational envi-\nronment into analysis of policy-making institutions, they will struggle to account for how\nnew policy ideas are generated. Baker (2015: 354) is able to side-step this problem by\nfocusing on a dense set of institutional practices within which the idea of macroprudential\nregulation had `a prior intellectual presence' domestically and internationally. This focus\ngives Baker licence not to inquire into the genesis of the set of ideas in question and there-\nfore raises doubts about the applicability of his approach to areas of policy where the\nsame conditions might not pertain. The existence (or otherwise) of a prior intellectual\npresence for a more activist approach to industrial policy is probably inconsequential\ngiven the subservience and vulnerability of industrial policy-making bodies within the\nwider economic policy arena. However, even in the case of macroprudential regulation, it\nappears that relevant ideational factors are being overlooked, insofar as Baker neatly\ndistinguishes between disruption in the `foundational assumptions'of financial regulation\nsince 2008 and continuity in those pertaining to macroeconomic policy. Yet it is surely the\ncase that the disruptive ideas in the former case remain largely consistent with the ideas\nin relation to macroprudential regulation among international institutions). This should not\n834 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nsurprise us given that, at the highest elite level, there is a significant overlap across the groups\nof policy-makers that determine both macroeconomic policy and financial regulation. As\nexplored below, we can say the same about industrial policy, even if the same dynamic pro-\nduces different results. The institutionalised overlaps between different policy-making insti-\ntutions must be part of any institutionalist account of policy change.\nAs such, although this applies to every policy area to some extent, it is clearly the case that,\nespecially in Britain, industrial policy outcomes do not simply consist of the policy choices\nthat industrial policy institutions produce. There are clearly fewer formal institutions dedi-\ncated to industrial policy, and those that do exist do not enjoy a commensurate degree of\nautonomy from more powerful bodies and established practice. The `growth model'analytical\nframework developed by Colin Hay (2013) with reference primarily to the British case, but\nwith antecedents in the more comparative varieties of capitalism and regime theory literatures,\noffers a useful device for recognising the interaction between institutions, ideas and economic\npractice.Agrowth model is understood here as the coalescence of the main sources of growth\nwithin the economy (especially insofar as they are distinguishable from other economies), the\norientation of political and economic institutions configured to enable the associated eco-\nnomic activities (and reconfigure these activities when necessary), the ideas about economic\nlife (and how it should be governed) that sustain the established order and the distribution of\nwealth and power that both results from and helps to reproduce the status quo.\nThe seemingly limited importance of manufacturing to the British economy compared\nwith similar economies obviously helps to explain the limited attention post-crisis indus-\ntrial policy has received among political scientists and political economists, yet acknowl-\nedging this status is also crucial to understanding how industrial policy has developed in\nrecent years. It was noted earlier that there were ostensible similarities between macro-\nprudential regulation and industrial policy, suggesting that Baker's work demonstrates\nthat the focus of the latter on one particular sector enabled an organised, yet subtle, form\nof resistance. Of course, the industries impacted by the two policy areas differ substan-\ntially in terms of their centrality to the British economy (or at least its distinguishing\nfeatures). It is perhaps not the existence of organised resistance to industrial policy change\nwhich matters most, but rather the absence of any organised advocacy.\nIndustrial policy in post-crisis Britain\nThe implication for the current inquiry is that post-crisis industrial policy change matters,\nbut it should not be approached as equivalent to macroeconomic policy or financial regu-\nlatory change. Hall and Baker were able to take for granted that the policy area being\nstudied was of paramount importance to the growth model (in Hall's case, of any capital-\nist economy, and in Baker's case, certainly the British economy) and that there existed a\ndedicated and relatively dense set of institutions and institutionalised practices to study\nfor signs of transformation. Analytically, manufacturing and industrial policy have a\nlower status within the British growth model. Whether occurring before, after or along-\nside third-order change, there is less scope for first- and second-order policy changes\nwithin actual policy mechanisms, since the required institutional arrangements are under-\ndeveloped. After briefly discussing the relevant historical context in terms of manufactur-\ning decline and industrial policy traditions in Britain, this section details policy and\ndiscursive changes relating to manufacturing and industrial policy, drawing upon official\npolicy documents, public remarks by policy-makers and, to a lesser extent, material\nrelated to the perspectives of non-governmental elite actors.\nHistorical context\nAlthough `declinist' accounts of British economic history remain controversial, there is\nlittle doubt that, defined in conventional terms, the British manufacturing sector has been\nindeclineforaverylongperiodoftime,arguablysincethelate19thcentury.Manufacturing\noutput and employment have fallen significantly as a proportion of overall output and\nemployment in the British economy and British manufacturing has fallen significantly as\na proportion of global manufacturing on the same measures. Furthermore, the faster pace\nof manufacturing decline in the postwar era is not simply a function of the recent and\nfairly rapid economic development of East Asian countries; Britain has also been losing\nhigher skilled manufacturing jobs to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries in recent decades and has shown few signs of develop-\ning high-tech or advanced manufacturing economies on any significant scale (English\nWilliams et al., 1983). Decline has continued since the 2008 crisis. The manufacturing\nsector suffered disproportionately during the recession; even before the very recent tur-\nmoil associated with Brexit, output was more than 6% below its pre-crisis `peak'in 2007,\nand manufacturing had shrunk in relative terms to comprise an even smaller portion of the\nBritish economy. A total of 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over this period--\nyet this actually represents a slower rate of job losses than has been evident from the\n1980s onwards, and particularly the immediate pre-crisis years.1\nWhile political discourse around manufacturing since 2008 (or more precisely 2010)\nsuggests that policy-makers are responding to an exigent crisis in the sector, it would clearly\nbe inaccurate to describe British manufacturing as having experienced an `explosive' crisis\nin 2008, despite the impact of the subsequent recession; there was no malfunction, but\nrather, arguably, an exacerbation of extant trends. Overall, the events of 2008 do not repre-\nsent a significant moment of upheaval for British manufacturing. Does this mean that manu-\nfacturing has experienced a `slow burn' crisis? Perhaps, but the decline of manufacturing\nhas been treated by policy elites not as a problem to be solved, but rather a habitual condi-\ntion or a fact to be accommodated--or indeed celebrated, insofar as it might be considered\nthe flipside of other, more welcome economic trends. If manufacturing ever was central to\nthe British growth model, it became significantly less so by the late 20th century. This was\nboth demonstrated and reinforced by the failure to firmly establish industrial policy mecha-\nnisms in the late 19th and early 20th century as Germany, Japan and the United States\n`caught up' to the manufacturing capacity developed in Britain following the industrial\nrevolution. This view relies of course upon the definition of industrial policy (and its rela-\ntionship with manufacturing) advanced in the `Introduction' section. British policy-makers\nwould generally claim that Britain has long upheld a functional industrial policy regime,\nalbeit one that operates `horizontally' to improve the general business environment across\nthe whole economy, rather than `vertically' to support a single set of industries.\nAs such, direct support for manufacturers has generally taken the form of `soft' inter-\nventions such as advice services and the dissemination of best practice and tax allowances\nfor R&D or capital investment (Buigues and Sekkat, 2009). British industrial policy has\noften essentially taken the form of regional policy--an orientation that intensified in the\n1990s and especially after the election of Tony Blair's Labour government in 1997.\nHowever, while through regional policy mechanisms parts of the state appeared to take\non a more interventionist pose, this was often limited, again, to defensive moves, in sup-\nport of regions undergoing hardship associated with deindustrialisation. Interventions\n836 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nhave often took the form of offering investment incentives to foreign corporations. Most\noften, the regional layer simply replicated the horizontal approach of national govern-\nment, and indeed probably reinforced it, by encouraging all regions to pursue similar\neconomic objectives, often in competition with each other and paradoxically with little\nsense that strategies were genuinely `place-based' (Bailey et al., 2015; Bailey and\nDriffield, 2007). It should be noted that in the 1970s, Harold Wilson's Labour govern-\nment introduced a more interventionist approach, involving direct subsidies and planning\nagreements, although the agenda became largely focused on defensive interventions to\nrescue unproductive firms and industries (Coates, 2015). While short-lived, this episode\nis interesting for illuminating a point made in the previous section, that is, that policy\nchange in relation to manufacturing may be propelled not simply by a perception of crisis\nin British manufacturing, but rather difficulties in the economy more generally requiring\na renewed focus on the manufacturing sector--yet this may in fact help to explain its\nephemerality. In contrast, we can speculate that policy change associated with macropru-\ndential regulation arises from the perception of crisis which pertains to the finance sector\nalone, rather than the economy more widely. These perceptions may differ precisely\nbecause manufacturing and finance occupy different places within the British growth\nmodel, but the constraining effect on policy innovation is nevertheless quite similar.\nPost-crisis industrial policy and discursive change\nIndustrial policy became more prominent within British economic policy before the\nestablishment of the coalition government in 2010. Gordon Brown created BIS in 2008,\nto coincide with the return to front-line politics of Peter Mandelson, as both Business\nSecretary and First Secretary of State (the de facto Deputy Prime Minister). BIS was of\ncourse largely a reinvention of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), which Brown\nhad split a year earlier into the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory\nReform (BERR) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS),\nalthough it retained oversight of higher education, which had not been part of DTI. The\nnew department published the flagship statement of Labour's post-crisis industrial pol-\nicy--the green paper New Industry, New Jobs--in April 2009 (HM Government, 2009).\nNew Industry, New Jobs explained that the two key flaws of British industry were low\nR&D spending and a lack of success in translating scientific expertise into commercial\nproducts. Many of the policies that the coalition would go on to champion as their own\nwere developed during this period, including greater venture capital investment through\nthe Technology Strategy Board (which was established in 2007), more investment in\nskills, initiatives to improve access to finance for some small and medium-sized enter-\nprises (SMEs) and efforts to introduce a more strategic approach to government procure-\nment (with, again, a focus on SMEs).\nInterestingly, manufacturing featured relatively little in New Industry, New Jobs,\nalthough the paper did coincide with the announcement of some new funding for advanced\nmanufacturing research centres. It is also worth noting that BERR and DIUS had in\nSeptember 2008 jointly announced a new `manufacturing strategy', although the accom-\npanying document focused on celebrating what Labour had already done in government\nrather than advocating a new approach (BERR and DIUS, 2008). New Industry, New Jobs\nendorsed a more `strategic'approach for government in supporting the British economy's\n`competitive strengths' and indeed alluded to industrial policy's institutional subservi-\nence by explaining that `[t]his means making Britain's economic and industrial strength\nthe remit of not just the Department for Business, but of all Government departments'\n(HM Government, 2009: 5; emphasis original). However, the paper also repeatedly\nstressed that the Brown government rejected a mythical `Old Labour' view of the state,\noutlining `important limits' to state intervention based on a `pragmatic but not dismissive\n[view] about the way markets work'. `The last thing the Government wants to do', BIS\nexplained, `is revive old theories or to invent a new ideology in managing the economy'\nSince 2010, the notion of `rebalancing' has become one of the defining motifs of the\ncoalition and Conservative governments, with an apparent imbalance between manufactur-\ning and the finance sector one of the core features of the rebalancing narrative. In his 2011\nbudget speech, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, argued that `manufac-\nturing is crucial to the rebalancing of our economy'; the finale of his speech added oratorical\nflair to this statement and indeed has quickly entered British political folklore:\nWe want the words `made in Britain', `created in Britain', `designed in Britain', `invented in\nBritain' to drive our nation forward. A Britain carried aloft by the march of the makers. That is\nhow we will create jobs and support families. We have put fuel into the tank of the British\neconomy. And I commend this Budget to the House. (Osborne, 2011)\nThe budget also marked the publication of the coalition's `plan for growth'. The docu-\nment's foreword--co-signed by Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable, a Liberal\nDemocrat minister--offers a quite remarkable critique of Britain's pre-crisis growth\nmodel, based as it was on `rising levels of debt, over-leveraged banks and an unsustain-\nable property boom'. The foreword also bemoans a severe decline in manufacturing out-\nput and employment and points longingly towards the success of Germany in developing\na high-tech manufacturing base and maintaining its share of world exports (HM Treasury\nand BIS, 2011: 3\u00ad4). Critical scrutiny of the ideological connotations of the rebalancing\nconcept suggests that it offers a rather conservative narrative of post-crisis economic\npolicy change (Berry and Hay, 2016; Froud et al., 2011), undermining the notion that\nwholesale change in British economic statecraft is being pursued. But this does not pre-\nclude a priori the possibility of meaningful industrial policy change.\nThere are elements of both horizontal and sectoral policies in coalition industrial policy.\nAccess to finance has been an important objective, although this agenda has focused hori-\nzontally on supporting SMEs, rather than manufacturers in particular. It has included loan\nguarantees that could amount to around \u00a32\nbillion, in addition to the Bank of England's\nFunding for Lending scheme, although this scheme was initially used predominantly to\nsupport mortgage lending. The British Business Bank enabled a more direct form of lend-\ning to SMEs, albeit with funds of only around \u00a31.5\nbillion. Other horizontal measures\ninclude additional efforts to focus government procurement on SMEs, some additional\nfunding for apprentices and the creation of enterprise zones offering tax and planning con-\ncessions (and superfast broadband) for companies relocating to these areas. It is certainly\nthe case, however, that the coalition government was comfortable in its public discourse\nwith endorsing also a sectoral approach to manufacturing, with the emphasis in its 2012\nindustrial strategy on 11 key sectors as the focus of government action. Many of the sectors\nconstitute or encompass manufacturing industries or industries which might feed directly\ninto manufacturing (aerospace, automotives, life sciences, nuclear, offshore wind) but also\ninclude many less directly relevant to industrial production (agricultural technologies, con-\nstruction, information economy, international education, oil and gas, professional and\n838 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nbusiness services) (HM Government, 2014). Supporting advanced manufacturing, in gen-\neral, was singled out in The Plan for Growth as an important industrial policy priority. This\nfocus is borne out by some of the sectoral strategies, but also in the creation of theAdvanced\nManufacturing Supply Chain Initiative (at a cost of around \u00a3240million) and, more spe-\ncifically, catapult centres--most of which have some connection to high-tech manufactur-\ning industries--where firms and universities can collaborate on R&D and access common,\npublicly funded resources (the centres are expect to attract private funding in the medium-\nterm). The coalition also consistently expanded tax allowances related to capital invest-\nment, which primarily benefit manufacturers.\nClearly, however, the notion that there has been a significant shift of resources--or an\nallocation of new resources--to vertical industrial policy would be an over-statement.\nAssessing the plan as a whole, it is clear that manufacturing and industrial policy played\na relatively restricted role within the coalition's growth plan. In The Plan for Growth,\narguments that might support a more interventionist industrial policy run alongside sup-\nport for fiscal conservatism, lower taxes and deregulation, and flexible labour markets\n(albeit with a higher skilled workforce). Increasing investment and exports is stated as\none of four main ambitions, yet attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) is listed as the\nmain specific goal in this regard--the prospect of nurturing domestic investment is not\nexplicitly referenced. Crucially, it is not simply the Treasury's leadership of the growth\nplan that accounts for the restricted place of vertical industrial policy. In `sector analysis'\npublished by BIS in 2012, the department stressed that `[h]orizontal policies, such as set-\nting the legal and regulatory frameworks in which businesses across the economy oper-\nate, form the bedrock of industrial strategy', but added, `[w]ithin this framework, it is\ncrucial to take into account sector-specific effects'(BIS, 2012: 7). The coalition's rhetori-\ncal focus on sectors is justified by officials almost entirely in terms of the government's\nsupport for the overall business environment. They did, however, concede that some sec-\ntors have a higher risk of innovation failure than others--therefore circumscribing quite\ncarefully the grounds upon which government may intervene in particular sectors to cor-\nrect market failures.\nThere was clearly an appetite, however, among BIS ministers to have gone much fur-\nther. In a 2011 speech, Vince Cable (2011), while maintaining that `picking winners' is\nillusory, argued that government has a `legitimate and necessary' role in supporting man-\nufacturing innovation:\nOne of the first decisions I took was to put manufacturing at the centre of our long term\neconomic vision ... Manufacturing contributes disproportionately to overall levels of\nproductivity as well as generating half the UK's exports of goods; and is responsible for much\nof the business R&D in this country and the innovation which drives growth. So providing the\nright framework of incentives and support will have a material effect on future rates of growth.\nCrucially, he argues that R&D in some high-tech manufacturing industries is not\nonly `risky' (an argument which correlates with the overall coalition position) but also\n`simply too complex or resource-intensive for an individual company to make the nec-\nessary investment'. Cable offers therefore a more strident critique of private sector\nefficiency than most of his coalition partners. In an open letter to David Cameron and\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (Cable's party leader) in 2012, seemingly an attempt\nto bypass the Treasury and George Osborne (and perhaps even his own department), he\nargued that\nthere is still something important missing [in the government's industrial strategy]--a\ncompelling vision of where country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess; and a clear\nand confident message about how we will earn our living in the future ... Market forces are\ninsufficient for creating the long term industrial capacities we need. (Cable, 2012)\nHe continued that `our actions, frankly, are rather piecemeal'.\nHe appears to have enjoyed the support of Conservative science minister David\nWillets, who argued in favour of a sectoral approach to industrial policy in a 2012 speech,\nsurmising that `[g]overnments find themselves making decisions about allocation of\nresources and we should not pretend that we do not. The coalition's pledges on rebalanc-\ning the economy depend on such a view'. The Cable view was also largely endorsed by\nformer Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, whose 2012 review for the coalition\ngovernment, No Stone Unturned, is often credited with propelling the Conservative\nParty's newfound interest in devolution (as discussed in the next sub-section). However,\nHeseltine also advocated emphatically the notion that the state, at both national and local\nlevels, must support strategically important industries, such as those related to advanced\nmanufacturing, and commit substantial resources to this task.\nThis is not to suggest that Cable et al. offered a genuinely radical vision for a paradig-\nmatic shift in industrial policy--they broadly advocated a more clinical focus on\n(advanced) manufacturing and supported higher spending on industrial policy, but\nstopped short of arguing against other post-crisis economic policy objectives (such as\ndeficit reduction) or questioning the wider institutional framework within which indus-\ntrial policy mechanisms were situated. Justin Bentham et al. (2013: 2) refer to it as `a\nnon-disruptive form of policy innovation'. Nevertheless, even this mild critique appears\nto have struggled to gain support not only within government but among elites more gen-\nerally. Senior BBC economics journalist Evan Davis' (2012: 84) book Made in Britain--\npublished to accompany a documentary series of the same name--argued that\nmanufacturing decline `is a sign of success, not failure'. He argued that rebalancing was\nrequired following the financial crisis, but only `to make some adjustments to our course\nrather than reverse the direction we have taken' (Davis, 2012: 7).\nManagement consultancy McKinsey made similar arguments in an influential 2010\nreport titled `How to compete and grow'. They argue that while governments should adopt\neconomic policies `tailored' to particular sectors, manufacturing cannot be relied upon to\nThe authors unhelpfully elide job creation and output growth in this regard; manufacturing\nmay be indispensable to the latter in the long term through productivity improvements,\neven while contributing disproportionately less to the former. Nevertheless, the report was\ncited in the BIS (2012: 7) sector analysis, by way of circumscribing the scope of the rebal-\nancing agenda, with the document stating simply that `McKinsey have argued that the\ncompetitiveness of sectors matters more than the sector mix in producing growth'.\nThe Cable position did enjoy the support of both the Confederation of British Industry\nand the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in pursuing the new industrial strategy after 2010\n(Bentham et al., 2013)--yet this is most significant insofar as it signifies the absence of a\nmore radical approach to industrial policy among the trade unions. Even manufacturing\ntrade body EEF (2015) has restricted itself to fairly limited or `non-disruptive' proposals\nfor supporting British manufacturing: its 2015 `manifesto for manufacturing' advocated\nhigher investment in skills and infrastructure, as well as lower taxes, but also largely\nendorsed the government's record in establishing catapult centres and widening access to\nfinance for SMEs. Hence, in industrial policy debates, we see the inverse of the organised\n840 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nresistance to macroprudential regulation identified by Baker; advocates of industrial pol-\nicy largely accepted the conservative connotations of the coalition government's dis-\ncourse. Even if some groups would like government to be slightly more ambitious or to\nimplement reform more quickly, there are few signs of sustained, widespread pressure for\na more genuinely radical agenda, even among manufacturers.\nBy 2014, it was clear that George Osborne, as chief economic policy-maker, had shifted\ndecisively away from the idea of an activist industrial policy or at least any position that\nmight constitute a paradigm shift: despite the threadbare evidence, his speeches began to\ncelebrate the coalition's success in rejuvenating British manufacturing (see Osborne,\nindustrial policy to the notion of `backing businesses' as part of the `long term economic\nplan', alongside deficit reduction, cutting tax, and investing in education Osborne (2014b).\nThe post-election budget in 2015 also marked the publication of the Conservative govern-\nment's `productivity plan'. The associated document Fixing the Foundations did not con-\ntain a single reference to manufacturing. There is a clear lack of strategic thinking evident\nin Fixing the Foundations; it lists the two drivers of productivity rather vaguely as `long\nterm investment' and `a dynamic economy'. Objectives related to `long term investment'\ninclude skills, infrastructure, science and innovation, albeit with tax cuts at the top of the\nagenda, and alongside highly tenuous references to the Osborne agenda around reforming\npensions tax relief (which was abandoned in early 2016). A flexible labour market appears\nto be the main objective of the `a dynamic economy' category (with the inclusion of\nOsborne's contentious `high pay, low welfare' rhetoric). This section of the document also\nprioritises `planning freedoms, more houses to buy' (HM Treasury, 2015: 7).\nRevealingly, the final objective listed in this category is `Resurgent cities, a rebalanced\neconomy and a thriving Northern Powerhouse'; the productivity plan therefore endorses\nConservative plans for devolution to newly formed city-regions (HM Treasury, 2015: 41).\nIn this regard, the coalition and Conservative governments appear to have continued the\ntraditional role of sub-national layers in the delivery of industrial policy--yet their\napproach encompasses a subtle but important variation on previous practice. The coali-\ntion abolished Labour's regional layer of industrial policy, the Regional Development\nAgencies (RDAs), as soon as it took office. It replaced them with Local Enterprise\nPartnerships (LEPs), relatively loose networks of local civic and business leaders, with\nfew resources to invest or powers by which to leverage private investment, broadly organ-\nised on a smaller, city-regional basis (although the Regional Growth Fund, which offers\nseed investments to projects able to attract private investment in areas most affected by\npublic sector cuts, has distributed \u00a32.7billion since 2010). As the structure of local gov-\nernment is reorganised around mayor-led city-regions with lower revenue grants from\ncentral government, we can broadly interpret these changes as a hollowing out of the\n(fairly limited) regional layer of vertical industrial policy that Blair and Brown had aug-\nmented, in favour of a reinforcement of purely horizontal industrial policy mechanisms at\nthe local level.\nYet just as it appeared the true colours of `Osbornomics' were being revealed, 23 June\n2016 happened, and in the aftermath of Britain's decision to leave the EU, Theresa May\nreplaced David Cameron as Prime Minister, and George Osborne was banished to the\nbackbenches. May (2016) made a noteworthy speech during her abbreviated leadership\nelection campaign in which she advocated `proper industrial policy' and criticised\nOsborne's record in this regard, implying that more radical `economic reform'was neces-\nsary to improve productivity. The speech in fact echoed a speech in 2013 (when May was\nHome Secretary) in which she advocated `a more strategic role for the state in our economy'\n(while simultaneously eschewing a so-called `beer and sandwiches' approach to indus-\ntrial policy and `failed seventies-style corporatism') (May, 2013). The 2016 campaign\nspeech also included a rebuke for Osborne's approach to regional policy, in calling for `a\nplan to help not one or even two of our great regional cities, but every single one of them'.\nYet her speech concentrated on issues around corporate governance rather than industrial\npolicy per se and made only a passing reference to manufacturing when signalling she\nwould have blocked the takeover of leading British-based pharmaceuticals firm\nAstraZeneca by global giant Pfizer had it proceeded (her words were revealed as rather\nhollow when she acquiesced in the first week of her premiership to the takeover of\nBritain's world-leading microchip producer ARM by the Japanese firm SoftBank). She\nalso neglected to address what impact `Brexit' might have on British manufacturing\nexports, despite stating categorically in the same speech that `Brexit means Brexit'. The\nspeech advocated, at most, a Cable-lite industrial strategy, calling simply for `a better\nresearch and development policy' and `more Treasury-backed bonds for new infrastruc-\nture projects', in an unwieldy list which also included policy proposals on domestic\nenergy costs and house-building.\nIt is worth noting that, unlike The Plan for Growth in 2011, Fixing the Foundations was\npublished solely by the Treasury (despite its foreword being co-signed by the new Business\nSecretary, Sajid Javid). Its publication therefore marks symbolically the neutering of BIS\n(and its ministers) that had begun towards the end of the coalition era. The November 2015\nmatching the cut it had endured 2010\u00ad2015. Although the science budget was partially\nprotected, cuts included the abolition of the Manufacturing Advisory Service. After leav-\ning office, Cable promulgated more systematically the notion that the Treasury had under-\nmined his industrial policy ambitions, in a letter co-authored with Labour's former business\nspokesperson Chuka Umunna. Cable and Umunna (2015) criticised the Treasury for per-\nennially `undermining or abandoning productive, long term government interventions'.\nTheresa May has actually replaced BIS with the Department for Business, Energy and\nIndustrial Strategy, but her approach to the departmental configurations of industrial policy\nremains unclear. While the return of a direct reference to industrial policy in the depart-\nment's name is noticeable, so too is the fact that the department has lost responsibility for\nhigher education and trade policy (both integral to industrial policy) and effectively been\nmerged with the Department for Energy and Climate Change.\nIndustrial policy has been an important feature of the early tenure of Jeremy Corbyn,\nthe left-wing member of parliament (MP) selected as leader of the Labour Party after the\n2015 election. His ally and shadow chancellor John McDonnell has drawn upon Marianna\nMazzucato's (2013) work on `the entrepreneurial state'to advocate higher levels of public\ninvestment in advanced manufacturing R&D, principally through a national investment\nbank (see Stewart, 2015), although Corbyn (2015) himself has (seemingly inadvertently)\ncriticised the tax allowances offered to many companies to incentivise R&D and capital\ninvestment, by denouncing so-called `corporate welfare'(see Farnsworth, 2015). There is\nlittle evidence of a coherent Corbyn industrial policy approach, with the incoherence of\nCorbyn's position underlined by his own apparent indifference regarding Brexit. In con-\ntrast, Corbyn predecessor Ed Miliband had a much clearer approach to industrial policy,\n842 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(4)\nalbeit not one that differed significantly from that pursued by the coalition. Reviews led\nby Mike Wright (2014) (Executive Director of Jaguar Land Rover) for the party, and\nformer Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis for Labour-friendly think-tank Policy\nNetwork (2014), essentially endorsed the direction of policy development proposed by\nVince Cable, albeit with higher levels of public investment. Adonis (who later accepted a\nrole within the Conservative government as chair of the National Infrastructure\nCommission) was slightly more critical of existing practice, in that his review made the\ncase for a stronger BIS department. Nevertheless, even as the Conservative Party moved\naway from this agenda in 2014 and 2015, Labour did not make industrial policy a feature\nConclusion\nThe period since the 2008 crisis in Britain has seen a plethora of initiatives related to\nindustrial policy, often focused on manufacturing. Policy innovation was propelled, it\nseems, by a new degree of comfort among policy elites, especially since 2010, towards\nacknowledging the unbalanced nature of Britain's pre-crisis economy. The agenda seemed\nto wane after 2014--indicating perhaps the hollow nature of the `paradigm shift'--but\nthe ascendance of Theresa May following the referendum on EU membership perhaps\nsignals the resumption of the coalition government's earlier agenda. Yet the process of\npolicy change has followed neither Hall's nor Baker's account of the `three order'of post-\ncrisis policy change in relation to, respectively, macroeconomic policy and macropruden-\ntial regulation. Industrial policy innovation is not the product of a `slow burn' crisis in\nmanufacturing that resulted in a policy learning process because manufacturing decline\nhas been at least decades in the making. There is also the fact that apparent innovation\nwas clearly triggered by the crisis of 2008, with little evidence of incremental policy\nchange before this point. But 2008 was above all a financial crisis which did not dispro-\nportionately disrupt existing trends within the manufacturing sector. The rebalancing nar-\nrative implicated manufacturing but essentially represented the co-option of the motif of\nmanufacturing decline into attempts by elites to manage wider economic problems.\nInnovation has stalled not because key stakeholders have resisted meaningful reforms at\na later stage of implementation, but rather because the relevant policy-making bodies lack\nthe power, resources, expertise and even inclination to push for a more radical industrial\npolicy agenda. Generally speaking, post-crisis industrial policy innovation represents a\nshift in policy discourse not matched by policy substance. In fact, the radical discourse\nsmuggles some quite conservative meanings into elite framing of manufacturing decline,\nwhich have served to constrain innovation ideationally and reinforce rather than address\nincoherence within industrial policy delivery mechanisms.\nBaker adds a `variety of crisis' variable to the `three orders' framework to account for\nthe process of policy change in relation to macroprudential regulation; this is a highly\nrelevant variable to this study, but Table 1 summarises two further variables required to\naccount for post-crisis industrial policy change in Britain since 2008. First, the differ-\nences in the institutional framework in which policy is forged are a decisive factor.\nMacroeconomic policy and financial regulation both have well-established institutional\nprocesses encompassing powerful public bodies--the former houses key economic pol-\nicy functions discharged by agents with near-peerless authority to set agendas, and the\nlatter comprises largely depoliticised bodies which enjoy a privileged autonomy within\ngovernment (partly because of the patronage of the former framework), including the de\nfacto ability to reform its own formal structures. Of course, these differences may help to\nfurther explain the different processes of policy change identified by Hall and Baker--the\ndepoliticised institutions of financial regulation may have empowered policy insiders to\nresist change more fiercely, despite evidence of economic malfunction in the finance sec-\ntor. Yet industrial policy provides an even starker contrast. Industrial policy mechanisms\nare operated by a relatively junior government department or local authorities. In fact, the\nshape and powers of both institutional settings are highly dependent on the preferences of\nagents elsewhere within the institutional framework of Whitehall and are frequently\nreformed via top-down processes to suit wider political initiatives. It is little surprise that\nradical policy discourse translates into, at most, moderate reform. The opponents of\nmacroprudential regulation have an arena in which to contest reform, whereas the advo-\ncates of industrial policy have far more limited opportunities to promote their agenda.\nWe must also consider, second, the status of the associated economic activities in the\nBritish growth model. Manufacturing clearly plays a subordinate role in the economy.\nEven if we were to accept that elite actors sought to substantially boost manufacturing\nthrough a more activist industrial policy in the wake of the financial crisis, we can con-\nclude that the paucity of the ideational and institutional resources available to them rep-\nresented a significant barrier to meaningful change. Clearly, macroeconomic policy and\nfinancial regulation do not perform the same function within the growth model: the for-\nmer plays a foundational role in establishing the parameters within which capitalism\nTable 1.

However, while the industries in ques-\ntion for financial regulation are integral to the British growth model, this is not the case\nfor industrial policy and the manufacturing sector. As such, whereas the macroprudential\nregulation agenda acts in part to contain demands for more radical policy change, in\nindustrial policy, radical policy rhetoric serves to obscure the limited capacity of the\nBritish state to deliver policy innovation.\nIt is clear that an industrial policy paradigm shift has not occurred in Britain (and is not\nlikely to). But the case raises important questions about post-crisis economic policy change\nin general. While there has been a great deal more noise around industrial policy since\n2008, and especially 2010, it seems that this noise paradoxically serves the same purpose\nas the pre-crisis silence from most parts of the political elite regarding manufacturing and\nindustrial policy. The ongoing attempt by some key actors to proselytise the importance of\nmanufacturing and the need for a new industrial policy approach may actually serve to\nreinforce its subservience, insofar as the discourse is framed by the conservative rebalanc-\ning narrative, therefore circumscribing the limits of policy innovation. Clearly, while the\ndiscourse challenges some of the tenets of neoliberal economic statecraft, we can more\nfully evaluate the significance of this shift by studying its status within a wider institutional\nand ideational environment. Thus, we can better comprehend how what could be seen as a\npartial repudiation of neoliberalism can nevertheless serve to reinforce a growth model\nanimated by neoliberalism. This may have important implications for how policy change\nin the wake of capitalist crises is understood, insofar as ideas, institutions and interests are\nshown to interact in different ways due to a wide variety of factors.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
