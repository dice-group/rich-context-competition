    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe examined how perfectionistic people conceptualize perfectionism and narrate life events using thematic analysis.\nParticipants included 20 university students who qualified as highly perfectionistic based on cutoffs on the Almost Perfect\nScale\u00adRevised (n = 6 adaptive, n = 14 maladaptive). Participants completed a qualitative interview. Using thematic analysis,\nwe identified five themes regarding participants' conceptualization of perfectionism. The most common themes supported\nprior theory (high personal standards, performance is never good enough), along with a few comparatively understudied\nthemes (being neat and orderly, feels superior to others, gets caught up in the details). We also identified five themes in a\nlife narrative interview (relationship success, relationship problems, agentic redemption, agentic contamination, and academic\nsuccess), which provided insight into how young, perfectionistic university students create meaning and identity through\nautobiographical narratives. \"Relationship success\" themes were most central to adaptive perfectionists, whereas \"agentic\nredemption\" themes were most central to maladaptive perfectionists.\n",

Numerous quantitative analyses on perfectionism\ndemonstrate positive correlations between perfectionism and\npsychopathology, particularly anxiety, depression, and eat-\ning disorders (Boone, Soenens, & Luyten, 2014; Kawamura,\nHunt, Frost, & DiBartolo, 2001; Klibert, Lamis, Naufel,\nYancey, & Lohr, 2015; Luo, Forbush, Williamson, Markon,\n& Pollack, 2013). Although extensive quantitative (numeri-\ncal) research on perfectionism exists, there is comparatively\nlittle qualitative (nonnumerical) research. The present study\nused a qualitative design analyzed using thematic analysis\n(Braun & Clarke, 2006) to develop a greater understanding\nof how perfectionistic individuals define and are affected by\ntheir perfectionism.\nWhat Is Perfectionism?\nPerfectionism is frequently conceptualized as a multidimen-\nsional construct, with variation in its conceptualization\nHewitt & Flett, 1991; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, &Ashby,\nfactor analysis to combine many different perfectionism\nmeasures into two latent dimensions. For example, Stoeber\nand Otto (2006) proposed two latent variables, which each\nrepresent a \"family\" or \"constellation\" of subtraits derived\nfrom an array of different research traditions. Perfectionistic\nStrivings includes demanding perfection of oneself, achieve-\nment striving, and having high personal standards.\nPerfectionistic Concerns, often conceptualized as the more\nmaladaptive dimension, includes excessive concern over\nmistakes, doubting the quality of one's actions, self-criti-\ncism, a feeling of falling short of one's own high standards,\nand feeling others demand perfection of oneself. Some\nauthors suggest that categorical personality types can be\nderived from these two dimensions, with three-category\nmodels being common, including (a) nonperfectionists, who\nhave low levels of both dimensions; (b) adaptive perfection-\nists, who have high levels of Perfectionistic Strivings and\nlow levels of Perfectionistic Concerns; and (c) maladaptive\nperfectionists, who have high levels of both perfectionism\nVarious studies have identified positive relationships\nbetween perfectionistic concerns, perfectionistic strivings,\nand numerous psychopathologies, such as depression,\n1Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nSean P.

Similar\nfindings have been found for categorical perfectionism mod-\nels. For example, Gnilka, Ashby, and Noble (2012) found\nthat anxiety was highest for maladaptive perfectionists and\nlowest for adaptive perfectionists, with nonperfectionists\nfalling somewhere in between. By further examining how\nthese dimensions manifest within qualitative data, we hope\nto better understand the impact of perfectionism in the lives\nof highly perfectionistic people.\nQualitative Research on Perfectionism\nAlthough considerable quantitative research on perfection-\nism exists, the body of qualitative research is much smaller\n(Mackinnon, Sherry, & Pratt, 2013). Speirs-Neumeister\n(2004) used inductive data analysis to examine what factors\ncontribute to the development of Socially Prescribed and\nSelf-Oriented Perfectionism. Socially Prescribed\nPerfectionists described being subjected to authoritarian par-\nenting styles and witnessing parental perfectionism. These\nindividuals displayed preconceived expectations of their par-\nents having demanding expectations for them, their self-\nworth as being dependent on achievement, and a fear of\ndisappointing others. In addition, participants suggested\nparental perfectionism, experiencing mastery of early aca-\ndemic experiences without effort, and a lack of previous\nexperience with academic failure were precursors to Self-\nOriented Perfectionism.\nEgan, Piek, Dyck, Rees, and Hagger (2013) used qualita-\ntive analysis to explore perfectionists' motivation to change\ntheir standards and cognitions after failure. They conceptual-\nized negative perfectionists as a clinical sample whose per-\nfectionistic behavior functioned as negative reinforcement\n(Slade & Owens, 1998). Athlete perfectionists were the com-\nparison group. High negativity perfectionists demonstrated\nmore dramatic, catastrophic, and negative reactions when\nhaving experienced negative consequences (Egan et al.,\n2013). Moreover, negative perfectionists tended to make\nnegative internal attributions of failure, whereas the athletic\ngroup made more external attributions (e.g., blaming the\nweather).\nMackinnon et al. (2013) conducted a longitudinal mixed\nquantitative and qualitative analysis exploring whether per-\nfectionists expressed increased themes of agency (power,\nstatus, achievement, self-mastery) and difficulties in the\ndomain of communion (friendship, support, mutual dialogue,\ntogetherness). First-year university students completed a\nsemistructured autobiography interview (McAdams,\nHoffman, Day, & Mansfield, 1996) and questionnaires at the\nbeginning and end of term. Themes of agency within the nar-\nratives were positively correlated with Perfectionistic\nConcerns, Perfectionistic Strivings, and Perfectionism\nCognitions. However, dimensions of perfectionism were\nuncorrelated with themes of communion.\nMerrell, Hannah, Van Arsdale, Buman, and Rice (2011)\nconducted a qualitative analysis to assess the thoughts and\nfeelings of 14 maladaptive perfectionists using the consen-\nsual research paradigm (Hill et al., 2005; Hill, Thompson, &\nWilliams, 1997). There were a number of common themes\n(e.g., stress about perceived academic inadequacy, avoidant\ncoping, interactions with loved ones, and perfectionism) pro-\nviding insight into how maladaptive perfectionists express\ntheir feelings through narrative.\nLife Narratives\nMost personality research focuses on traits (i.e., features of\npersonality that remain stable across time and contexts)\nusing self-report questionnaires and quantitative analysis.\nHowever, some have criticized this narrow focus, suggesting\nthat life narratives (i.e., autobiographical stories about one's\nlife) are essential to understanding the whole person.\nMcAdams and Pals (2006) proposed an integrative model of\npersonality that incorporates other features beyond traits.\nThis model describes three core features of personality: (a)\ndispositional traits (traits that change little across contexts\nand time), (b) characteristic adaptations (context-specific\nresponses to life events, such as goals and values), and (c)\nlife stories (how one narrates autobiographical events).\nUnlike other personality theories, it highlights the impor-\ntance of autobiography when understanding personality.\nMost researchers have focused on correlates of trait per-\nfectionism (Cruce, Pashak, Handal, Munz, & Gfeller, 2012;\nand how these traits interact with aspects of perfectionists'\ngoals, values, and motivations (Clark, Lelchook, & Taylor,\nHowever, research on perfectionists' life narratives is sparse.\nExamining these narratives will provide a novel perspective\ninto the lives of these individuals, and how their perfection-\nistic traits manifest within their autobiographical narratives.\nThus, the study of highly perfectionistic individuals using\nMcAdams's (2008b) Life Narratives Interview is likely to\nadvance our understanding of perfectionism.\nThe Current Study\nResearch exploring how perfectionists narrate their lives is\nsparse. Existing qualitative research has important limita-\ntions. Prior qualitative research has not generally asked par-\nticipants to define perfectionism. Instead, researchers have\neither defined perfectionism for the participants (Egan et al.,\n2013) or focused on auxiliary issues such as achievement\ngoals (Speirs-Neumeister, 2004) or stress and coping (Merrell\ncontrasted the experiences of adaptive versus maladaptive\nperfectionists. To address these gaps, the present study asked\nboth adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists to define\nFarmer et al. 3\nperfectionism and to describe whether they viewed it as a\npositive or negative influence in their lives. We also com-\npared the overall life themes of adaptive and maladaptive\nperfectionists using the Almost Perfect Scale\u00adRevised (APS-\nR) cutoffs (Rice & Ashby, 2007), which represents a novel\ncontribution to the literature.\nPrior research has also tended to eschew broader metathe-\noretical issues in personality psychology (cf. Mackinnon\noping a complete understanding of the individual's narrative\nidentity is crucial for understanding the whole person, and a\ncore component to studying personality. Therefore, by exam-\nining life narratives, the current study will develop a better\nunderstanding of the \"whole perfectionist.\" The present\nstudy is thus also in line with a broader theoretical perspec-\ntive in personality psychology that advocates for the integra-\ntion of life narratives into research on human personality.\nThe present study examined the narrative identity of\nhighly perfectionistic individuals, using a combination of\nopen- and closed-ended interview questions and utilizing\nthematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Our research\nquestions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: How do people high in maladap-\ntive or adaptive perfectionism define perfectionism?\nResearch Question 2: What major themes emerge in the\nautobiographical narratives of people high in perfectionism?\nThese questions were left open-ended to allow for fortuitous\nfindings and to decrease chances for preconceived researcher\nbiases to influence the data interpretation (Maxwell, 2009).\nMethod\nSelection Criteria\nOur selection criteria were based on cutoff scores on the\nparticipants were required to meet cutoff scores for an adap-\ntive or maladaptive perfectionist. Adaptive perfectionists had\nto score 42 or higher on the Standards subscale and less than\n42 on the Discrepancy subscale. Maladaptive perfectionists\nhad to score 42 or higher on both the Standards and\nDiscrepancy subscales. Participants were administered the\nAPS-R twice, once during prescreening via an online survey,\nand again when arriving at the lab. When determining eligi-\nbility for the study based on Rice and Ashby's (2007) cutoff\nscores, we calculated the average of prescreening and labora-\ntory scores on the APS-R. Two participants did not meet eli-\ngibility requirements after arriving at the lab (i.e., their\naverage perfectionism scores were lower than the cutoff of\n42). These two participants were omitted from the analysis.\nA third participant was classified as an adaptive perfectionist\nat prescreening but was reclassified as a maladaptive perfec-\ntionist after the APS-R was readministered in the lab. This\nparticipant was retained as a maladaptive perfectionist. All\nother participants had the same perfectionism classification\nthey were assigned at prescreening. Our goal was to collect\ndata from 20 participants, with an equal number of adaptive\nand maladaptive participants. Due to difficulty in finding\nparticipants who met the criteria for adaptive perfectionism,\nmore maladaptive than adaptive perfectionists were actually\nrecruited.\nGiven our selection criteria, mean scores on Standards\nscores on Discrepancy were high for maladaptive perfection-\n(2007) cutoff scores are well validated, they were normed on\nan American population, rather than a Canadian population\nof students. Mean Discrepancy scores from the mass testing\npool collected at Dalhousie University during the same year\nto be larger than the sample from the southeastern United\nand Ashby (2007). Indeed, the mean Discrepancy scores at\nDalhousie University exceed the cutoff for maladaptive per-\nfectionism suggested by Rice and Ashby (2007). This may\nsuggest a social context of heightened perfectionism at\nDalhousie University.\nParticipants\nTwenty perfectionistic participants (six adaptive, 14 mal-\nadaptive) were recruited from the student population at\nDalhousie University via flyers and online advertisements.\nThis student sample was primarily young (M\nage\nyears, SD = 2.67) and female (n = 15), with participants\nreporting their ethnicity as Caucasian (n = 14), Asian (n = 5),\nor Caribbean (n = 1). They had a variety of university majors,\nwith the most common being psychology (n = 7). Moreover,\nfour participants (all maladaptive perfectionists) indicated\nthat they were currently receiving treatment from a mental\nhealth professional.\nMaterials\nAPS-R. The APS-R is a 23-item scale that measures facets of\nperfectionism. In the present study, we used two subscales\nfrom the APS-R: Standards (\"I have high standards for my\nperformance at work or at school\") and Discrepancy (\"I\noften feel frustrated because I can't meet my goals\"). Partici-\npants responded to items on the APS-R using a 7-point scale\nranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The\nAPS-R has high reliability, demonstrating high internal con-\nsistency for each of the subscales (Standards:  = .85, Dis-\nexcellent sensitivity and specificity when used as a categori-\ncal measure using cutoff scores (Rice & Ashby, 2007).\n4 SAGE Open\nPerfectionism interview questions. There were three sections of\ninterview questions used to address our two research ques-\ntions. In the first section, we used a combination of open and\nclosed-ended questions to assess participants' understanding\nof perfectionism. The specific questions were as follows: (a)\nHow would you define perfectionism or perfectionistic peo-\nple? (b) Do you think you are a perfectionistic person? Why\nor why not? (c) Do you know anyone other than yourself\nwho is a perfectionistic person? Why do you think they are\nperfectionistic? (d) What are the best things about someone\nbeing a perfectionist? (e) What are the worst things about\nsomeone being a perfectionist? These author-generated ques-\ntions were adapted from a prior qualitative study on perfec-\ntionism (Rice, Bair, Castro, Cohen, & Hood, 2003).\nLife narrative interview. The life narrative interview is a short-\nened, semistructured interview that was created by using\nquestions from McAdams's (2008a) life story interview. We\nasked participants about nine critical life events from this\ninterview: a high point, a low point, a turning point, a mis-\ntake story, a drinking story, a positive childhood memory, a\nnegative childhood memory, a parent story, a same-sex friend\nstory, and \"other important person\" story. A high point is a\nmoment in which participants experienced positive emo-\ntions, such as joy, excitement, happiness, inspiration, or deep\ninner peace. A low point is an event in which participants\nexperienced negative emotions, such as despair, disillusion-\nment, fear, or guilt. A turning point is an episode in which\nparticipants undergo an important change in the way they\nunderstand themselves. A mistake story is a story where a\nperson feels he or she made the wrong choice. The two child-\nhood scenes (positive and negative) are similar to high and\nlow points, but must occur during childhood or early adoles-\ncence. The mistake story was author generated, following the\nsame framework as the questions developed by McAdams\n(2008a). The final three relationship narratives were adapted\nfrom previous studies conducted by Mackinnon, Nosko,\ntionship defining scene is an event or experience with a par-\nticular individual that \"illustrates what the relationship is all\nabout.\" We asked about relationship defining scenes in three\ndomains: (a) a parent, (b) a same-sex friend, and (c) any\nother important person not discussed so far.1\nProcedure\nThis study has received ethics approval from the Dalhousie\nUniversity University Health Sciences Research Ethics\nTo participate in the study, participants initiated contact via\nemail after viewing an advertising flyer (n = 15), an online ad\n(n = 3), or hearing about it via word of mouth (n = 1). One\nperson declined to indicate how he or she heard about the\nstudy. All participants were prescreened by completing an\nonline version of theAPS-R and were admitted into the study\nonly if they met Rice and Ashby's (2007) cutoff scores for\nadaptive or maladaptive perfectionists (see \"Selection\nCriteria\" section).\nParticipants came into the lab for approximately 2 hr. The\nsession was conducted in a single, closed room, with only the\nresearcher and participant to ensure the participant's privacy.\nParticipants first read and signed a consent form. Next, par-\nticipants completed pen and paper questionnaires, including\nnot only the APS-R but also other measures not reported on\nin this article. Following the questionnaires, the researcher\nturned on the audio-recording device and read aloud the\ninstructions on the interview protocol. The participant was\ngiven the opportunity to ask questions before beginning both\nsections of the audio-recorded interview. A paper containing\nquestion prompts asked during each of the descriptions of the\nparticipants' critical life events was provided to the partici-\npant as a reference. The prompts consist of the following:\n\"what happened, where it happened, who was involved, what\nyou did, what you were thinking and feeling, what impact\nthis experience may have had upon you, and what this expe-\nrience says about who you were or who you are.\" During the\ninterview, the researcher did not lead the participants'\nresponses, only prompting them to elaborate if the researcher\nfelt the participant had not fully responded to the question.\nAll participants provided consent to use anonymous quota-\ntions. Finally, participants received a debriefing form and\nwere compensated. Compensation consisted of one of three\noptions: (a) $40(CAD), (b) two bonus points to be adminis-\ntered toward qualifying psychology courses via the online\nundergraduate participant pool in the Department of\nPsychology and Neuroscience at Dalhousie University, or (c)\na combination of $20(CAD) and one bonus point.\nThe audio-recorded data were transcribed into text format\nin Microsoft Word, by the first and third authors. Any infor-\nmation that could have been linked back to the participant, or\ncould have led to their identification (e.g., names, places,\ndates), was removed from the transcripts during this process.\nAll qualitative data analysis used the transcribed interviews.\nQualitative Analysis Strategy\nWe used inductive thematic analysis to analyze the interview\nquestions. Thematic analysis involves open-ended qualitative\nanalysis to summarize the content of the raw interview data\n(Braun & Clarke, 2006). The researcher begins the analysis by\nfamiliarizing himself or herself with the raw data (the tran-\nscript), generating initial codes within the written or spoken\ndata, and coding sections of the transcript for theoretically\ninteresting features (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The codes sum-\nmarize each data item. The researcher is then required to\nassemble these diverse codes into holistic themes, which sum-\nmarize the data in a meaningful way (Braun & Clarke, 2006).\nThey review the themes to ensure that they have accounted for\nall of the codes, proceeding to name and define each theme\nuntil the data are concisely and completely summarized.\nFarmer et al. 5\nInductive thematic analysis involves describing data with\nas few preconceptions as possible (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A\npreconceived notion of what themes to expect may bias the\nresults, either causing the researcher to miss fortuitous find-\nings, or to unintentionally manipulate the presence of a pre-\ndicted theme within the data (Maxwell, 2009). To reduce\nbias, we did not attempt to predict the qualitative results of\nthe study beforehand and instead sought to describe the data\nin rich detail. Participants did not provide feedback on tran-\nscript accuracy, nor the final analysis.\nResearch Team and Reflexivity\nThe first author, a female Caucasian who was an undergradu-\nate student at a Canadian university at the time of the analy-\nsis, conducted this project as part of her honors thesis. She\nwas trained in thematic analysis by the second author and\nhad experience conducting thematic analysis once before in\nthe nonprofit sector. The first author conducted all of the\ninterviews and did much of the thematic analysis and writ-\ning. The second author, a male Caucasian university instruc-\ntor with a PhD in experimental psychology, supervised the\nfirst author's honors thesis. Although his specialization is\nprimarily in quantitative statistics, he has also published two\nstudies using thematic analysis in the context of mixed-\nmethods designs. The second author was involved in all\naspects of the research design, analysis, and writing. He also\naudited the thematic analysis, resolving any discrepancies in\ninterpretation through discussion. The third author, a female\nCaucasian paid research assistant, transcribed the majority of\nthe data and was currently completing her undergraduate\ndegree in psychology at the time the study was being con-\nducted. She also assisted with writing and editing the final\nmanuscript for publication.\nParticipants had no relationship with the interviewer (first\nauthor), but knew she was completing her honors thesis. As\nthe study was cross-sectional, participants knew there would\nbe no further interaction with the first author following the\ninterviews, and participants were assured that their responses\nwould be anonymous and confidential. Thus, there was no\npreexisting relationship with participants that might bias\nresults; however, it is possible that the lack of a preexisting\nrelationship may have resulted in some participants being\nmore reluctant to fully disclose their feelings during the\ninterview. Moreover, the first author was not fully blinded to\nparticipants' perfectionism subgroup status, which could\nhave influenced the interview. The participants did not inter-\nact with the second or third author.\nWe not only ascribed to epistemological constructivism\n(i.e., people construct narratives within a sociocultural con-\ntext) but also assumed the narratives reflected real lived\nexperiences (ontological realism). This is consistent with\nprior research using McAdams's (2008b) life narrative inter-\nview, and can be broadly categorized as a \"psychosocial\"\napproach to studying autobiography (Smith & Sparkes,\n2008). We preferred thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,\n2006) to language-based approaches such as discourse anal-\nysis (Barker, Pistrang, & Elliott, 2016) because it is more\ncompatible with our ontological realist stance and our\nemphasis on the individual rather than broader societal issues\n(Smith & Sparkes, 2008). We preferred thematic analysis to\nnarrative analysis (Barker et al., 2016) because the perfec-\ntionism questions did not produce data that were in narrative\nform (i.e., stories with a clear narrative arc). Thus, thematic\nanalysis was preferred as an approach that could analyze\nresponses to both the perfectionism questions and the life\nnarrative interview.\nAlthough all attempts were made to remain unbiased dur-\ning the thematic analysis, it is worth noting that the second\nauthor comes from a theoretical tradition that assumes per-\nfectionism is a maladaptive risk factor for psychopathology,\nwhich may bias interpretation to the extent that such a bias is\nin turn passed on to his supervised students. Specifically, his\ntraining can be traced back to the Hewitt and Flett (1991)\ntradition of measurement and research, which comes with its\nown assumptions about the definitions and correlates of per-\nfectionism. Moreover, the second author tends to ascribe to a\ntwo-dimensional model of perfectionism (i.e., perfectionistic\nconcerns vs. perfectionistic strivings; Stoeber & Otto, 2006),\nwhich is commonplace in Canadian research on perfection-\nism. Finally, the classification system created using the\nAPS-R cutoff scores (Rice & Ashby, 2007) contains implicit\nassumptions about the well-being of participants. That is,\n\"adaptive\" perfectionists are thought to have positive well-\nbeing, whereas \"maladaptive\" perfectionists are thought to\nhave adjustment difficulties and mental health problems.\nIndeed, a value judgment is built directly into the construct\nnames through the use the adaptive versus maladaptive\nlabels. This may have influenced the qualitative analysis\ntoward portraying adaptive perfectionists more favorably,\nand maladaptive perfectionists more unfavorably. Attempts\nwere made to bracket and set aside such assumptions as a\ncore part of thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006).\nHowever, any such attempt is liable to be imperfect, and\nreaders are encouraged to keep our assumptions and biases in\nmind when interpreting the qualitative analysis.\nThematic Analysis of Perfectionism Questions\nWe combined data from the five perfectionism questions\ntogether into a single section before analyzing with thematic\nanalysis. This section of the interview was divided into 166\ndata items, which were in turn collapsed into five themes. A\nfull list of all these themes and their descriptions are presented\nin Table 1.3 The prevalence of all themes (i.e., the proportion\nof participants who endorsed a given theme at least once),\nsplit by perfectionist status, sex, ethnicity, and whether or not\nthey were seeking mental health treatment, is contained in\n6 SAGE Open\nSupplementary Table 1. Participants' subgroup status is indi-\ncated as maladaptive perfectionists (MP) or adaptive perfec-\ntionists (AP) throughout this section to facilitate comparison.\nHowever, because there were not many differences between\nthe responses of adaptive versus maladaptive perfectionists in\nthis section of the interview, we describe the themes overall\nwhen collapsed across all participants.\nThe \"high personal standards and goals\" theme was the\nmost common theme. This theme consisted of high expecta-\ntions and standards for one's own performance, working\nvery hard on tasks, and demonstrating a good work ethic. For\nexample, Participant 11 (MP) described the best thing about\nbeing perfectionistic as \". . . you want to make sure that it\n[work] is the best it possibly can be . . .\" Although partici-\npants often described these as \"high goals,\" it was also quite\ncommon to highlight the strong work ethic of perfectionistic\npeople, particularly when asked to describe what is best\nabout perfectionism.\nWe called the second largest theme \"performance is never\ngood enough.\" Here, perfectionists described feeling dissat-\nisfied when their performance was inadequate in some way,\nusually leading to negative emotions. For example,\nFeeling like you're never good enough leads to a lot of feelings\nof unworthiness and loneliness because you retreat . . . I ended\nup dropping lots of courses in high school because I just felt I\nwasn't good enough to even sit in the room and learn the material\nbecause I couldn't learn it as fast as others. (P3, MP)\nAlthough the above quote is an unusually self-punitive\nexample, this theme always involved a subjective sense of\nfailing to reach high standards, with negative emotions such\nas shame, anger, or depression.\nAlthough the majority of participants described perfec-\ntionism using these two themes, there were also a number of\nsmaller themes endorsed by comparatively few participants.\nThe most common of these small themes was \"being neat\nand organized,\" which refers to a preference for organization\nand orderly environments. For instance, one participant\ndescribed his or her mother as a perfectionist:\nUm, I think my mom is perfectionist (chuckles) [laughs] like\ncause she always wants everything in the house clean, like looks\nperfect . . . if there's something like just moved like, five\ncentimeters away from its own place like she would just yell at\nIn this example, we can see not only a preference for order\nbut also displeasure with disorder. This theme also contained\ninstances where participants were overly meticulous in car-\ning for their physical appearance.\nAnother theme was \"feels superior to others.\" This\ntheme had both positive and negative features. For instance,\nparticipants indicated that perfectionism can lead to objec-\ntively superior performance and praise from others, usu-\nally when describing what is \"best\" about perfectionism.\nHowever, participants also described perfectionists as the\nsort of people who are highly critical of others. For exam-\nple, one participant describes her father as perfectionistic\nbecause \". . . if I get a good grade that is an A average but\nthere's one, B+ or A\u00ad or something then he would still\ncomplain about that and ignore the rest of it . . .\" (P7, MP).\nSo this theme is fundamentally social in nature, suggesting\nthat some perfectionistic people seek praise for their agen-\ntic accomplishments, and criticize others for failing to\nreach high standards.\nFinally, a few participants also described a tendency to\n\"get caught up in the details.\" In this theme, participants\ndescribed perseverating on small details in tasks, resulting in\nwork taking longer than expected. Typically, participants\nwould suggest that this detail-oriented trait was likely to\ninterfere with other areas of life, such as social relationships.\nFor example, \"spending a lot of time on things, so you don't\nhave a lot of time for other things . . .\" (P20, AP). Overall,\nthis theme appeared somewhat reminiscent of obsessive\ncompulsive personality traits.\nThematic Analysis of Life Narrative Interview\nThe life narratives interview consisted of 544 data items. Of\nthese items, 31 were highly idiosyncratic or uncodable, and\nwere coded as \"miscellaneous.\" The remaining data items\nwere distilled into five themes, which are presented in order\nfrom most to least common. See Table 2 for a full list of all\nfive themes and their descriptions. The prevalence of all\nthemes split by selected demographic variables is contained\nin Supplementary Table 1. Again, there were no clear differ-\nences between the responses of adaptive versus maladaptive\nperfectionists in this section of the interview; thus, we\ndescribe the themes overall when collapsed across all\nparticipants.\nTable 1. Themes Identified From the Perfectionism Interview\nQuestions.\nTheme Description\nHigh personal\nstandards and\ngoals\nHaving high standards and expectations of\nperformance. Always striving to do their\nbest, especially at work or school\nPerformance is\nnever good\nenough\nA feeling that performance is inadequate in\nsome way, frequently leading to negative\nemotions\nBeing neat and\norganized\nBeing very organized, favoring orderly\nsurroundings, and/or meticulous care for\none's own physical appearance\nFeels superior to\nothers\nPerfectionism leads to superiority over others\nand criticism of others' imperfections\nGets caught up\nin the details\nTending to get lost in the details and taking a\nlong time to finish a task. Spending all their\ntime working interferes with other areas of life\nNote. Themes are listed in order from most to least common.\nFarmer et al. 7\nTheme 1: Relationship success.The largest theme was rela-\ntionship success, that is, positivity regarding relationships\nand accepting aid from others. Although the nature of the\nrelationships varied across participants (e.g., friends, family,\nromantic partner), these moments of appreciation for one's\nloved ones were treasured as positive memories by all par-\nticipants. Nonetheless, agentic concerns (i.e., personal power\nand accomplishment) served as the contextual backdrop for\nmany of these stories. For example, P15 describes a feeling\nof interpersonal closeness after writing a letter to her grand-\nparents, but is also proud when the letter was read in front of\nothers:\n. . . my grandmother decided to read the story to my entire\nfamily, and I guess it just made me feel really good that she\nthought that it was important enough to share with the other\nmembers of my family. . . . I just feel proud that my grandparents\nknow that they've made such a difference in my life. (P15, AP)\nAlthough the relationship is clearly quite intimate, the par-\nticipant chooses to emphasize agentic concerns (i.e., feelings\nof pride, public "
