As a consequence,\nmate and in-law preferences do not overlap, and each party tends to prefer more the traits\nthat give it more benefits. This paper tests the hypothesis that this divergence in preferences\ninteracts with the tradeoffs nature of mating to give rise to parent-offspring conflict over\nmating. In particular, using a design where mate choice is constrained by a budget, three\nhypotheses are tested: First, asymmetries between in-law and mate preferences result in\nasymmetrical compromises in the choice of an in-law and a spouse. Second, the hypothesis\nis tested that when choice is constrained, disagreement spreads to traits where there is no\ndivergence between in-law and mate preferences. Finally, it is hypothesized that there is a\nnegative relationship between mate value and parent-offspring conflict over mating.\nEvidence from two independent studies in two different countries provides support for all\nthree hypotheses.\n",

This relationship, however, meets\nthe strong opposition of their parents who, not particularly interested in looks or\npersonality, disapprove of the family background of their prospective in-laws. Such stories\nreflect the real fact that what mate seekers value in a spouse is not always the same with\nwhat parents value in an in-law. In turn, this raises the question of why in-law and mate\npreferences do not overlap.\nThe answer lies in the fact that parents and offspring are not genetically identical:\nAll of offspring genes come from their parents, but not all of parents' genes are inside their\noffspring. Differences in genetic relatedness result in the same traits giving different\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\n1974). For instance, the coefficient of relatedness of parents to children is 0.5, but the\ncoefficient of relatedness of grandparents to grandchildren is only 0.25. Consequently, the\nodds of a particular gene of an individual being passed into the next generation would be\n50% by spouse or 25% by an in-law. Therefore, individuals reap more genetic benefits\nfrom a spouse than from an in-law of superior genetic quality and accordingly they should\nvalue genetic quality more in a spouse than in an in-law.\nConsistent with this argument, a number of studies have produced evidence that\nbeauty, a proxy of genetic quality, is valued more in a spouse than in an in-law (Apostolou,\nFleischman, and Buss, 2011). Divergence between in-law and mate preferences, however,\nis not confined only to beauty. Research has identified that individuals value good family\nbackground and similar religious background more in an in-law than in a spouse, whereas\nthey value exciting personality more in a spouse than in an in-law (Apostolou, 2008b,\nIt has been argued that preference asymmetries result in asymmetrical compromises\nand eventual conflict between parents and children (Apostolou, 2008a; Buunk et al., 2008).\nHowever, if I prefer vanilla-flavored and you prefer chocolate-flavored ice cream, this does\nnot necessarily mean that we are in conflict over ice cream choice. If our budget allows us\nto get the ice cream we like, there would be no conflict between us, only differences in\npreferences. Similarly, the fact that in-law and mate preferences do not overlap does not\nnecessarily mean that parents and offspring are in conflict over mating. If both parties\ncould get what they want, there would be no conflict between the two. The tradeoffs nature\nof mate choice, however, prevents each party from getting what it wants, and conflict\nbetween the two arises.\nTradeoffs and Conflicts\nWhen mate/in-law choice is exercised, each party (parents, offspring) is constrained\nby its own mate value with respect to the mate value of a spouse/in-law it can get. This is\nbecause individuals of high mate value will not engage in long-term mating with\nindividuals of low mate value (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, and\nagree to marry a \"5.\" This means that if you are a \"5\" you will probably want to marry a\n\"10,\" but you will need to settle for someone closer to \"5.\" Consequently, when you\nexercise mate choice, you have to make compromises because you are constrained by your\nown mate value. Similarly, if your parents exercise mate choice for you, they also need to\nmake compromises as they are also constrained by your mate value: They want to get a\n\"10,\" but they have to settle for someone around \"5.\" The key point is that since traits give\nunequal benefits to parents and offspring, the compromises that each party is willing to\nmake differ, which results in conflict between the two (Apostolou, 2008a; Buunk et al.,\nFor instance, because more benefits are reaped from a spouse than from an in-law\nof superior genetic quality, when they exercise mate choice, individuals will be willing to\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nexchange more \"units\" of other traits (say social status) in order to get more of beauty (a\nproxy of genetic quality). This imposes a cost on their parents as their loss in social status\nis not compensated by the gain in beauty, since this trait gives them fewer benefits than it\ngives to their children. Conversely, if parents were to exercise choice for their children,\nthey would be willing to give up more \"units\" of beauty to get more of other traits such as\nsocial status. This imposes a cost on the offspring as the gain in social status does not\njustify their loss in genetic quality because the latter is more valuable to them than it is to\ntheir parents.\nOverall, mate choice involves compromises, but the compromises each party is\nwilling to make are expected to be different because not all traits give the same benefits to\nparents and offspring. It is hypothesised then that divergence between in-law and mate\npreferences results in asymmetrical compromises individuals are willing to make on the\nbasis of whether they are choosing a spouse or an in-law.\nMoreover, the tradeoffs argument mandates that when the choice is constrained by a\ngiven mating value, disagreement spreads to traits that are valued equally in an in-law and\nin a spouse. For instance, assume that beauty is valued more in a spouse than in an in-law,\nwhile social status is valued equally in a spouse and in an in-law. In this scenario, offspring\nwill be willing to exchange more \"units\" of social status than their parents would like in\norder to gain more beauty \u00ad a trait which is more valuable to them than to their parents.\nThus, they would end up being romantically linked to someone of a poorer social status\nthan their parents would consider to be optimal. Therefore, in effect, children will disagree\nwith their parents over the social status of a prospective mate even if this trait is preferred\nequally in a spouse and in an in-law.\nIn addition, individuals of high mate value need to make fewer compromises than\nindividuals of low mate value. If you are a \"10\" you can get a \"10\" so you do not need to\ncompromise anything. This indicates that as mating quality increases, the divergence in\ncompromises between an in-law and a spouse decreases, with a consequent decrease in the\nmagnitude of conflict between parents and offspring. Accordingly, it is further\nhypothesized that there is a negative relationship between mate value and parent-offspring\nconflict over mating.\nFinally, previous studies on parent-offspring conflict over mating asked participants\nto rate a set of characteristics without any reference to their own mate value. The problem\nwith this approach is that if participants have no constraints imposed on their mate value,\nthey are put into a position of someone answering a question about how to spend imaginary\nlottery winnings (Li et al., 2002; Li and Kenrick, 2006). In addition, rating traits\nindividually does not reveal the tradeoffs that people normally make when they select\nmates/in-laws whose traits come in bundles. For instance, exciting personality is a desirable\ntrait but it may be irrelevant if a given mate is below the threshold on, say, social status.\nThus, considering traits in isolation might simply assume acceptable levels in other traits\n(Li et al., 2002; Li and Kenrick, 2006). This being the case, the importance of certain\ncharacteristics may be distorted and lead to distorted conclusions on parent-offspring\nconflict over mating for these traits. Accordingly, this paper also aims to examine whether\nconflict in previously identified traits is also found when individuals exercise choice\nconstrained by a given mate value.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nThis paper presents the results of two independent studies that attempt to test the\naforementioned hypotheses. In Study 1, a within-participants design is employed in which a\ngroup of parents are asked to design desirable spouses and in-laws. This design controls for\nsocialization and age effects, thereby enabling the identification of innate predispositions.\nHowever, it does not provide information on what happens between parents and their actual\nchildren. In order to compensate for this limitation, Study 2 employs a between-participants\ndesign in which parents and their children are asked to design desirable in-laws and spouses\nrespectively.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nonline survey. The mean age of male participants was 50.42 (SD = 11.7) and the mean age\nof female participants was 46.36 (SD = 11.4). A private company was employed\nspecializing in recruiting participants for online research in psychology. The participants\nwere selected from a large database of people willing to take part in online psychological\nresearch, and have registered through the company's web site. To take part in the study,\nparticipants had to be parents with at least one biological child. Parents had on average 0.92\n(SD = 0.8) male children and 0.84 (SD = 0.7) female children. The mean age of the oldest\n(SD = 13.35). Most participants were married (70.1%), followed by those in a relationship\npayment for completing the survey in the form of credit (about $3) that can be used to\npurchase goods from online stores.\nMaterials\nThis study combines the within-participants design employed by Apostolou\n(2008a,b) to study parent-offspring conflict over mating with the budget allocation design\nMore specifically, the survey consisted of four parts. In the first part, demographic\ndata were collected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, and number\nof sons, age of the oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. The rest of the\nsurvey was divided into three parts. In each part, participants were given a different budget\nof \"mate points\" (low budget \u00ad 15 mate points, medium budget \u00ad 30 mate points, high\nbudget - 45 mate points), and they were asked to allocate them across eight different traits\nfor a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law and a husband or wife. For each trait they could allocate\na maximum of ten mate points. The presentation order of budget, role (parent, mate-\nseeker), and characteristic varied randomly between participants.\nResearch on parent-offspring conflict over mating identified four traits over which\nparents and offspring disagree: namely, exciting personality, good family background,\ngood looks, and similar religious background. These items were added to a cluster of four\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\ntraits (ambition-industriousness, education-intelligence, favorable social status, good\nfinancial prospects) which are associated with resource provision and which research has\nestablished are valued equally in an in-law and in a spouse (but see Buunk et al., 2008 for\nthe education trait), to give us a set of eight traits. In this way, we are able to examine\nwhether compromises also involve non-conflicting traits inducing a direct resource cost for\nthe party not making the selection.\nIn-law vs. mate preferences comparisons\nThis study uses a within-subjects design where sexually mature individuals with\nchildren, who can act both as parents and mate seekers, were chosen as participants. This\ndesign has been employed because it controls for alternative explanations based on social\nlearning and accumulated life experience (Apostolou, 2008a). In particular, as people grow\nolder and gain life experience, they may re-evaluate the way they see certain traits in a\nmate. Accordingly, a between-participants design would not be able to distinguish between\nevolved predisposition and life experience effects.\nFurthermore, previous studies indicate that the ratings of desirable traits are\ncontingent upon the sex of the spouse (Buss, 1989) and the sex of the in-law (Apostolou,\n2007, 2010b). Consequently, if comparisons are made between in-laws and spouses without\ntaking into consideration the sex of the rater and the sex of the ratee, this would result in\ninformation loss with respect to identifying differences in budget allocations. Therefore, the\npoints that the female participants allocated to each characteristic for a son-in-law were\ncompared with the respective points allocated for a husband, and the points the male\nparticipants allocated for a daughter-in-law were compared with the respective points for a\nwife.\nIn order to obtain information on conflict between mothers and sons and fathers and\ndaughters, the budget allocations that female participants gave to each characteristic for a\nhusband were compared with the budget allocations male participants gave for a son-in-\nlaw. For instance, if for a given trait women were allocating significantly more points for a\nhusband than men were allocating for a son-in-law, this would indicate a potential conflict\nbetween fathers and daughters over this trait. Similarly, the budget allocations for each\ncharacteristic that male participants gave for a wife were compared with the budget\nallocations female participants gave for a daughter-in-law.\nResults\nSelf vs. daughter\nTable 1 depicts the percentages of the budget spent on each trait across all three\nbudgets. For each trait, the percentage allocated to an in-law is subtracted from the\npercentage allocated to a spouse and the difference is reported in a third column (D). The\nnumbers in this column thus represent the gains (losses) of offspring (parent). The P-P plots\nanalysis indicates that the sampling distribution of the differences between scores is not\nnormal; thus, to estimate whether the differences in budget allocations are significant, a\nseries of Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests was applied. Since the analysis involves multiple\ncomparisons alpha was set to the more conservative level of .01.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nTable 1. Within-participants comparisons: Mean percentages allocated to each\ncharacteristic\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nFor the low budget, when women designed a mate as opposed to a son-in-law, the\nbiggest compromise they made was on good family background, followed by education-\nintelligence and similar religious background. They allocated the points they had saved to\nget more good looks, exciting personality and ambition-industriousness. An alternative way\nto see this is that when women designed a son-in-law as opposed to a husband, they\ncompromised more on good looks, exciting personality and ambition-industriousness, and\nallocated the points they have saved in getting more of good family background, education-\nintelligence, and similar religious background. In the low budget we also find disagreement\nover ambition-industriousness and education-intelligence, traits that have not been\nidentified as conflicting by previous research.\nIn the medium budget, when women designed a mate they compromised on good\nfamily background, similar religious background and good financial prospects, and they\nallocated the points they had saved in getting good looks and exciting personality. In\ncomparison with the low budget, however, the magnitude of the difference is smaller,\nindicating that conflict is reduced in the medium budget. For instance, the cost incurred by\na parent on good family background in the low budget was 4.5; however, in the medium\nbudget it was only 2.3.\nIn the high budget, when women designed a mate they compromised on good\nfamily background and similar religious background to get exciting personality and good\nlooks. In the high budget, we observe a further decline in the amount of in-law-spouse\ndisagreement, with differences in ambition-industriousness, education-intelligence, and\ngood financial prospects not appearing as significant. Overall, we can see that as budget\nincreased, parental losses (positive number) and offspring losses (negative number) started\nconverging towards zero (Figure 1, panel A). The sharpest decrease took place when we\nmoved from low budget to medium budget. Nonetheless, even in the high budget there is\nstill conflict as the two did not reach zero.\nTo estimate the overall effects of role and budget, a two-way repeated measures\nANOVA was applied in each trait with role (mate seeker, parent) and budget (low,\nmedium, high) entered as the independent variables. The dependent measure was the\npercentage of the budget spent on a characteristic. Partial eta squared was used to estimate\neffect size (.01 small effect size, .06 medium effect size, and .14 large effect size), and the\nalpha level was set to .01. The results are presented in Table 2 where we can see a number\nof significant main effects for role and budget along with several significant interactions.\nA significant main effect of role indicates that participants changed their budget\nallocations for a given trait on the basis of whether they act as parents or mate-seekers. The\ndirection of the main effects is the same with the results of the analysis based on t-tests\n(e.g., participants allocate more points to the good looks of a spouse than of an in-law). A\nsignificant main effect of budget indicates that points' allocation to a given trait changed as\nbudget was relaxed. Finally, a role-budget interaction indicates that self and offspring\nspending patterns differ at each budget level.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nFigure 1.

To put it differently, when men designed a daughter-\nin-law they compromised on exciting personality and good looks and allocated the points\nthey had saved to good family background and education-intelligence. In the medium\nbudget, when men designed a wife they compromised on favorable social status and\nallocated the points they had saved to good looks and exciting personality. Finally, on the\nhigh budget, men compromised only on good family background to get good looks.\nWe observe that as budget increased the magnitude of conflict was substantially\nreduced. For instance, in the low budget, men would trade 3.4 percentage points of beauty\nto get other desirable traits, but in the high budget they would only trade 1 percentage\npoint, which translates into 2.4 percentage points less loss for a mate seeker in a higher\nbudget. We can see that as budget increased, parental losses (positive number) and\noffspring losses (negative number) started converging towards zero (Figure 1, panel B).\nThere was substantial decrease in conflict when we moved from low to medium budget,\nand a substantial decrease in conflict when we moved from medium to high budget. Even at\nthe high budget, however, there is still conflict as the two did not reach zero.\nAs before, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied in each trait with\nrole and budget entered as independent variables. As before, the alpha level was set to .01,\nand the results are presented in Table 2.\nHusband vs. son-in-law\nTable 3 depicts the percentages of the budget spent on each trait across all three\nbudgets. In each case, the percentage allocated to an in-law is subtracted from the\npercentage allocated to a spouse and the difference is reported in a third column (D). The\ndata in this column thus represent the gains (losses) of offspring (parent). The P-P plots\nanalysis indicates a moderate violation of the normality assumption. Therefore, to estimate\nwhether the differences are significant, a series of Mann-Whitney U tests was applied. As\nbefore the alpha level was set to .01.\nFor the low budget, we can see that the biggest difference in the budget allocations\nis found in good looks where women allocated significantly more units to their husbands\nthan men to their sons-in-law. This is followed by good family background, where more\npoints were allocated to a son-in-law than to a husband, and exciting personality, where\nmore points were allocated to a husband than to a son-in-law. Finally, more points were\nallocated to education-intelligence for a son-in-law than for a husband.\nAs budget increased and participants had more mate points at their disposal conflict\nsubstantially decreased. In particular, at a medium budget, conflict was confined only to\ngood looks where more points were allocated to a husband than to a son-in-law. For the\nhigh budget there were no significant differences in budget allocations. The decrease in\nconflict is depicted in Figure 2, panel A.\nTo estimate the overall effects of role and budget, a two-way mixed-design\nANOVA was applied in each trait with role entered as the between-participants factor\n(mate seeker, parent) and budget (low, medium, high) entered as the within-participants\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nfactor. The dependent measure was the percentage of the budget spent on a characteristic.\nThe alpha level was set to .01, and the results are presented in Table 2.\nTable 3.

Also, more points were allocated by women to the good family background of a\ndaughter-in-law than by men to the good family background of a wife. Similarly, more\npoints were allocated to the similar religious background of a daughter-in-law than that of a\nwife. Finally, more points were allocated to the exciting personality of a daughter-in-law\nthan that of a wife.\nAt the medium budget, women allocated significantly fewer points to the good\nlooks and exciting personality of their daughters-in-law than men to the good looks and\nexciting personality of their wives. Furthermore, mothers allocated more points to the good\nfamily and similar religious background of their daughters-in-law than men to their wives.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nFor the high budget, conflict is confined only to good looks where more points were\nallocated to a wife than to a daughter-in-law. The decrease in conflict is depicted in Figure\n2, panel B.\nAs before, a two-way mixed-design ANOVA was applied, with role entered as the\nbetween-participants factor and budget entered as the within-participants factor. The alpha\nlevel was set to .01, and the results are presented in Table 2.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThree research assistants were employed to carry out data collection. The research\nassistants recruited families who were willing to participate in the survey. Participation was\non a volunteer basis and no payment was given. To qualify for participation a family should\nhave at least one child who is over 13 years of age. The assistants visited the family home\nand administered the survey. Caution was taken that each family member filled in the\nquestionnaire without been influenced by other family members. Completed questionnaire\nwere put in an unmarked envelope and were sealed.\nmarried, 9.4% were divorced and 0.6% were in a relationship. Furthermore, 97.4% of\nfathers were married, 1.7% were single and 0.9% were in a relationship. With respect to\nwere divorced. With respect to sons, 60.5% were single, 20.9% were in a relationship, 14%\nwere married, and 4.7% were divorced.\nMaterials\nA modified version of the instrument developed in Study 1 was employed here. In\nparticular, two separate surveys were prepared, one for parents and one for their children.\nThe parents' survey consisted of three parts. In the first part, demographic data were\ncollected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, and number of sons,\nage of the oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. The rest of the survey was\ndivided into two parts. In each part, participants were given a different budget of \"mate\npoints\" (low budget \u00ad 15 mate points, medium budget \u00ad 30 mate points, high budget - 45\nmate points), and they were asked to allocate them across eight different traits for a\ndaughter-in-law and a son-in-law. For each trait they could allocate a maximum of ten mate\npoints. The presentation order of budget and in-law was counter-balanced. The survey\nadministered to children had a similar format, with the difference being that participants\nhad to allocate their mate points in obtaining a husband or a wife. The presentation order of\nbudget was counter-balanced.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nResults\nMother-daughter and mother-son comparisons\nTable 4 depicts the percentages of the budget spent on each trait across all three\nbudgets. In each case, the percentage allocated to an in-law is subtracted from the\npercentage allocated to a spouse and the difference is reported in a third column (D). The\ndata in this column thus represent the gains (losses) of offspring (parent). As the\nassumptions of parametric tests hold reasonably well for this dataset, a paired sample t-test\nwas employed to make comparisons between the budget allocations for each characteristic\nfor mothers and their children at each budget level. Since, the analysis involves multiple\ncomparisons, alpha was set to the more conservative level of .01.\nTo begin with, we can see that daughters allocated a greater percentage of their\nbudget than their mothers in getting good looks and exciting personality across all budget\nlevels. To \"finance\" this spending, they compromised on traits such as good family\nbackground, similar religious background, and ambition and industriousness. On the other\nhand, mothers allocated more of their budget in good family background and similar\nreligious background. Divergence in budget allocations is weaker for similar religious\nbackground as a difference is found only in the low budget; in medium and high budgets\nthe difference is in the predicted direction but it is not significant. To \"finance\" their\nspending, mothers compromised on good looks and exciting personality. Finally, there is a\ndivergence in budget allocations in ambition-industriousness trait, with mothers allocating\nmore of their budget to obtain it than their daughters.\nSons on the other hand allocated more of their budget to getting good looks in a\nwife than mothers in a daughter-in-law. This difference remained significant across all\nbudget levels. To get more beauty, sons compromised on good family background,\nfavorable social status and similar religious background. However, as opposed to mother-\ndaughter comparisons there was no divergence in budget allocations over exciting\npersonality. Additionally, in the high budget, sons allocated a greater percentage of their\nbudgets than their mothers to ambition, industriousness trait. On the other hand, mothers\nallocated more of their budget to getting good family background across all budget levels.\nDivergence in budget allocations for similar religious background is significant only in the\nhigh budget where mothers allocated a greater percentage of their budget to getting this\ntrait than their sons. Also, in the low budget mothers allocated a greater percentage of their\nbudget to obtaining favorable social status than their sons. To \"finance\" their spending,\nmothers predominantly compromised on good looks.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nTable 4. Mother vs. children comparisons: Mean percentages allocated to each\ncharacteristic\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nThe mean cost to parent and the mean cost to offspring for each budget level are\ndepicted in Figures 3 and 4, where it can be seen that conflict decreases as budget\nincreases. However, the magnitude of conflict decrease is generally small. In particular, in\nFigure 3, panel A we can see that the size of conflict between mothers and daughters\nremains roughly the same at all budget levels. In panel B we can see that when budget\nchanges from low to medium there is a substantial reduction in conflict between mothers\nand sons, but when the budget changes from medium to high conflict remains relatively\nstable.\nFigure 3.

A similar procedure\nwas followed in order to estimate the overall effects of family member and budget for\nmothers versus sons.\nThe alpha level was set to .01, and the results are presented in Table 5. A significant\nmain effect of family member indicates a difference in budget allocations between parents\nand their children. The direction of the main effects is the same with the results of the\nanalysis based on t-tests (e.g., parents allocated more points to the good family background\nof an in-law than their children to a spouse). A significant main effect of budget indicates\nthat points' allocation to a given trait changed as budget was relaxed. Finally, a role-budget\ninteraction indicates that parents and offspring spending patterns differ at each budget\nlevel.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nTable 5.

Table 6 indicates that across all budget levels daughters allocated\nsignificantly more of their budgets to getting good looks and exciting personality for their\nhusbands than their fathers for their sons-in-law. To \"finance\" their spending, daughters\ncompromised on traits such as good family background, ambition industriousness, and\nfavorable social status. On the other hand, in medium and high budgets fathers allocated\nmore of their budgets to good family background, while in low and high budgets they\nallocated more to favorable social status, and in medium budget they allocated more units\nto ambition-industriousness. This spending was \"financed\" by compromises in good looks\nand exciting personality. Finally, with respect to similar religious background no\ndifferences were found at any budget level.\nSons spent significantly more of their budget than their fathers on obtaining good\nlooks across all budget levels. With the exception of the high budget, sons allocated a\ngreater percentage of their budgets than their fathers to exciting personality, and they\n\"financed\" their spending by making compromises in good family background, similar\nreligious background and favorable social status. On the other hand, across all budget\nlevels fathers allocated a higher percentage of their budget to obtaining good family\nbackground, while in low and high budgets they allocated more of their budget to obtaining\nsimilar religious background. Also, in low budget they allocated more of their budget to\nobtaining favorable social status for their daughters-in-law. This spending was \"financed\"\nby compromises on good looks and exciting personality.\nIn Figure 4, panel A we see a small decrease in conflict between fathers and\ndaughters when budget increases from low to medium and from medium to high. In panel\nB we can see that there is a considerable reduction in conflict between fathers and sons\nwhen budget constrain is relaxed from low to medium and from medium to high.\nTo estimate the overall effects of role and budget for fathers versus daughters, a\ntwo-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied in each trait with family member (parent,\nchild) and budget (low, medium, high) entered as independent variables. The dependent\nmeasure was the percentage of the budget spent on each characteristic. A similar procedure\nwas followed in order to estimate the overall effects of family member and budget for\nfathers versus sons. In both cases, the alpha level was set to .01. The results are presented\nin Table 5.\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nTable 6. Father vs. children comparisons: Mean percentages allocated to each\ncharacteristic\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nDiscussion\nThe results from two independent studies indicate that asymmetries between in-law\nand mate preferences have consequent asymmetries in the compromises people make when\nthey exercise mate and in-law choice. In particular, when individuals were asked to spend\ntheir budget on a spouse, they compromised on traits such as good family background to\nget more of beauty and exciting personality. On the other hand, when they were asked to\nspend their budget on an in-law they compromised on traits such as beauty to get more of\ngood family background and similar religious background.\nFurthermore, asymmetrical compromises were also found for traits such as\neducation and intelligence, which have not been identified as conflicting by previous\nresearch. Finally, in-law-spouse differences in budget allocations decreased substantially as\nbudget increased; however, this budget effect was smaller in parents versus children than in\nparents versus self comparisons.\nAlthough the two studies produced similar results that are consistent with the\noriginal hypotheses, there were also differences. In particular, the degree of conflict was\nnot equal across traits, while there was a trend towards a higher level of conflict in Study 2\nthan in Study 1. In addition, the budget effect was much more pronounced in Study 1 than\nin Study 2. These differences may reflect cultural differences, as all of the participants in\nStudy 1 were British, while all of the participants in Study 2 were Greek Cypriots. More\nimportantly, the results of Study 1 reflect innate predispositions while the results of Study 2\nreflect innate predispositions plus socialization and age effects. For instance, if people\nemphasize beauty more when they are younger than when they are older, this would\namplify the differences in budget allocations in Study 2 by making conflict less sensitive to\nbudget effects. Moreover, in Cyprus, people are much more religious than they are in the\nUK, which means that in the former context, parents and children may agree to a greater\nextent that a similar religious background is important in a prospective mate. This may\npotentially account for the lower level of conflict that was found regarding this trait in\nBased on these findings it can be predicted that when compromises need to be made\n(which is usually the case given that it is very rare for individuals to enjoy such a high mate\nvalue that they do not need to make any compromises) in societies where parents have the\nupper hand in mate choice (e.g., India), their children are going to find themselves married\nto individuals who are not as good looking and who do not have so many desirable\npersonality traits, because their parents have compromised on these qualities. In contrast, in\nsocieties where individuals are generally free to exercise choice (e.g., the UK), parents are\ngoing to find themselves with in-laws of a poorer family background than they desire and\nperhaps even of a different religion from their own. This is because their offspring have\ncompromised on these qualities in favor of beauty and personality traits.\nIn addition, it is expected that parents will frequently complain that their children\nhave married individuals who are poorer and have a lower status than they could get.\nHowever, this disagreement is not because parents and offspring disagree over how much\nthey value wealth and social status in an in-law and in a mate respectively; it is because\nchildren have compromised on these qualities more than their parents would like in order to\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nget traits, such as beauty, that they prefer more than their parents.\nMoreover, the inverse relationship between mate value and conflict indicates that in\na scenario where mate seekers have a high mate budget (e.g., they are good looking, they\nhave good personalities, etc.), the conflict with their parents should be less than when their\nbudget is small (e.g., they are not good looking, they have a health problem, etc.). In the\nrare case where an individual enjoys a very high mate value, there is the possibility that\nparent-offspring conflict over mating completely disappears as individuals do not need to\nmake any compromises. Nonetheless, if you are a \"10\" it is not easy to find another \"10\" to\nmarry, simply because \"10s\" are very rare. This means that you may also need to make\ncompromises that are different from the ones that your parents are willing to make.\nAccordingly, even in this scenario, conflict over mating does not disappear completely.\nFurthermore, wealthy and high-status families have more at stake in the mating\nchoices of their children and thus they are more eager to control their mating behavior,\nwhich may amplify any parent-child conflict (Goode, 1982). In addition, highly attractive\noffspring may have more suitors and more opportunities to initiate sexual intercourse early\nin life, something that will meet with strong opposition from their parents (Apostolou,\n2010a). Thus, although an increased budget creates the potential for less conflict, certain\nmoderating factors diminish this potential.\nThe strength of Study 2 is that it employs parents and their actual children. Also,\nalong with Study 1, it replicates parent-offspring conflict over beauty, similar religious\nbackground, good family background and exciting personality using a different method,\nwhile it is only the second study that explores parent-offspring conflict over mating using\nparents and their actual children. This study is not without limitations however, one being\nthat the sample was not equally balanced between female and male participants. This is\nbecause men were less willing to participate in the study than women. As consequence,\nmen with specific characteristics (e.g., prone to cooperativeness) may be overrepresented in\nthe sample. Although it is unlikely that this has affected the results, a future study that will\ninvolve a monetary reward, so as to get a better response rate from male participants, can\naddress this issue.\nA further limitation is that the design employed does not control for alternative\nexplanations based on social learning. For instance, most people would ascribe the finding\nthat children value beauty more and family background less in a spouse than their parents\ndo in an in-law to differences in socialization: Life experience has taught parents that\nbeauty wears off with time, so it is not a characteristic that mate choice should be based on.\nSimilarly, older people who have experienced the importance of a good family background\nin a spouse (e.g., support) would value this trait more than younger and less experienced\nones.\nThis limitation is addressed by Study 1. In particular, the social learning argument\npredicts a difference in budget allocations between parents and their offspring for beauty\nand family background. What it does not predict is that the same individuals with the same\nlife experiences differentiate their budget allocations on the basis of whether they are\nchoosing spouses or in-laws. This provides strong evidence for the evolutionary argument\npresented here because it limits the space for alternative explanations based on social\nlearning. It may still be the case that when making decisions as a parent, participants were\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\ninspired by different social norms than when making decisions about their own partner. To\nsupport this argument, however, one needs to identify these norms and demonstrate that\nthey actually affect mate choice.\nLast but not least, regarding the way in which the studies are constructed, at higher\nbudgets participants are \"forced\" to buy up the remaining traits as they cannot spend more\nthan 10 units on any trait (a ceiling effect). This is potentially a limitation; however, it\nreflects a real-world situation. In particular, the value of a trait cannot increase ad\ninfinitum, as there is a ceiling effect in regards to how beautiful, strong, healthy,\nhardworking, etc. one can be. Thus, individuals with a high mating value will inevitably\n\"spend\" their surplus budget on traits that may not interest them as much.\nTo summarize, if divergence between in-law and mate preferences do not lead to\ncostly compromises for the party not exercising choice, then parent-offspring disagreement\nover mating would have been evolutionary neutral. Actually, if this was the case,\ndivergence in preferences would not have evolved in the first place. However, the results\npresented here demonstrate that this is not so: Asymmetries between in-law and mate\npreferences interact with the tradeoffs nature of mating resulting into asymmetrical\ncompromises that are costly to the party not exercising choice.\nAccordingly, if parents leave their children free to exercise mate choice, they will\nsuffer fitness costs from losses in desirable qualities. This has substantial implications for\nthe evolution of human behavior: Evolution should have optimized parents' behavior to\ncontrol offspring's mating decisions in a way that promotes their own in-law choices. In\nturn, this would give rise to social structures such as arranged marriage that uphold this\ncontrol, and effectively will determine the direction of sexual selection by leading to\ndifferential reproduction of individuals with traits that appeal to parents (Apostolou,\n2010c). The substantial implications of parent-offspring disagreement over mating should\nbe the focus of future research efforts.\n"
