    "abstract": "Abstract\nOur aim was to examine the effects of food acculturation on Mexican Americans' (MA) diets, taking the Mexican diet as\nreference. We used nationally representative samples of children (2\u00ad11 y) and female adolescents and adults (12\u00ad49 y)\nMA born in Mexico (MAMX) (n = 1488), MA born in the United States (MAUS) (n = 3654), and non-Hispanic white\nAmericans (NH-White) (n = 5473). One 24-h diet recall was used to examine the percentage consuming and percentage\nenergy consumed from selected food groups. Most of the food groups analyzed displayed a fairly linear increase or\ndecrease in percent energy/capita intake in this order: Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, NH-White. However, few significant\ndifferences were observed among the US subpopulations, especially among MAUS and NH-Whites. Overall, compared to\nMexicans, the US subpopulations had greater intakes of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and salty snacks, pizza and French\nfries, low-fat meat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk, as well as decreased intakes of corn tortillas, low-fiber\nbread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast food. Furthermore, the patterns were similar in all age groups. Although we found a\nmix of positive and negative aspects of food acculturation, the overall proportion of energy obtained from unhealthy foods\nwas higher among the US subpopulations. Our findings indicate that within one generation in the US, the influence of the\nMexican diet is almost lost. In addition, our results reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful components of the\n",

Despite higher levels of poverty, lower educational at-\ntainment, and other socioeconomic disadvantages, Hispanic\nimmigrants do better than, or comparable to, non-Hispanic\nWhites (NH-Whites)6 in overall mortality as well as cardiovas-\ncular disease and malignant neoplasms mortality (4). A pro-\nposed explanation for this so-called Hispanic health paradox\nsuggests that the original culture might be protective among new\nimmigrants; however, as they undergo the acculturation process\nand learn or adopt aspects of the US culture, those protective\nbehaviors are lost (4,5). The adoption of the US diet, here called\n\"food acculturation,\" or other obesity-related behaviors seems\nto be of particular importance when explaining the health\nparadox. Studies using country of birth, generational status, and\nlength of time in the US as a proxy of acculturation have found\nthat the more acculturated Hispanics have higher BMI than\nthose who were less acculturated (6\u00ad8). However, overall, there\nis a higher prevalence of obesity among Mexican Americans\n(MA) than among NH-Whites (9).\nThe health paradox becomes more complex when we con-\nsider that the original MA immigrants' culture is also undergo-\ning changes.

These studies have\ncompared the diets of MA in the US with different levels of\nacculturation using the less acculturated group as the reference.\nHowever, strictly speaking, all MA groups have already under-\ngone at least some degree of acculturation. All are self-selected\nimmigrants and all have been directly exposed to the US\nenvironment. To fill this important gap and better understand\nthe effects of food acculturation on the quality of the MA diet,\nwe used a nonacculturated group as the reference, namely, the\nMexican population.\nThis study used data from Mexico and the US. The foods in\neach data set were linked to systematically group identical foods\nin both surveys. This allowed us to compare the diets of persons\nresiding in Mexico with 3 subpopulations residing in the US:\nMexican Americans born in Mexico (MAMX), Mexican Amer-\nicans born in the US (MAUS), and NH-White. Our aims in\ncomparing these 4 subpopulations with different degrees of\nexposure to the US environment were, first, to identify the\nbeneficial or deleterious effects of adopting a US diet, using the\nMexican diet as reference, and, second, to assess the influence of\nthe Mexican diet relative to the influence of the American diet\non the MAMX and MAUS subpopulations. This information\nprovides insight into how to address and intervene in the\nnutrition-related problems of the MA population. In addition,\nwe examined a number of key age-gender groupings, including\nchildren of both genders, female adolescents, and adult women.\nMethods\nParticipants. This analysis used secondary data from nationally rep-\nresentative samples from both Mexico and the US. For Mexico, we used\ndata from the MNS 1999, conducted by the Mexican National Institute\nsurvey, a probabilistic sample representative of urban and rural areas\nwas selected. A detailed description of the sampling strategy and survey\nmethodology was previously published (18). Due to budget restrictions,\nonly information for women (12\u00ad49 y old) and children (2\u00ad11 y old) was\ncollected and dietary information was collected from a nationally\nrepresentative subsample of the MNS 1999. For this analysis, we in-\ncluded all women and children with complete dietary data.\nFor the US, we used data from NHANES, which includes a rep-\nresentative sample of the US population of all ages. People $60 y old,\nAfrican Americans, and Hispanics are oversampled.

For this analysis, we included women (12\u00ad49 y\nold) and children (2\u00ad11 y old) and created comparison groups among\nparticipants that identified themselves as MAMX, MAUS, and NH-\nWhites. The Institutional Review Board of the National Institute in\nMexico approved data collection and provided expedited approval for\nuse of these secondary data for this article. For NHANES, written\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants; by utilizing\nsecondary NAHNES data, we were exempt from institutional review\nboard monitoring for this paper.\nDietary intake, food composition tables, and food groups. Dietary\nintake analysis was based on a single 24-h dietary recall from each\nsurvey, whereby participants reported all foods and beverages consumed\nduring the previous day. For MNS 1999, one 24-h recall was performed\nat the household of the participant. Trained personnel applied the\nquestionnaires and converted each reported preparation into grams or\nmilliliters of individual foods; however, no standardized probing method\n(i.e. 5-pass method) was used in this survey. For NHANES, the 24-h\nrecalls were conducted in English or Spanish by dietary interviewers with\na computer-assisted automated data collection system. Beginning in\n2002, the collection system changed to a multiple 5-pass method, which\nto complete a second 24-h dietary recall interview by telephone. To\nmaintain consistency among all surveys, we included only the first 24-h\nrecall from each in this analysis.\nThe NHANES nutrient intake was estimated using the USDA\nFNDDS, which is based on the USDA-SR. The main differences between\nthe databases are that the FNDDS does not have missing values and\nincludes a larger variety of portion sizes and food mixtures. The\nBase (22); therefore, for these years, we used FNDDS 1.0 (NHANES\nin FNDDS 1.0. For these foods, the original food composition table was\nused and sugar content was imputed based on the carbohydrate:sugar\nratios of similar foods.\nMNS 1999 originally used a comprehensive nutrient composition\ndatabase compiled from diverse references by the Nutrition and Health\nResearch Center, National Institute of Public Health. This compilation\nwas based on the USDA-SR for one-half of the foods (348 of 680 foods\nreported in our sample). For the present analysis, we revised this\ndatabase to make it more comparable to the one used in NHANES. After\nan exhaustive review, food-by-food, we found that FNDDS was ap-\npropriate for 375 of the foods, because the energy content and/or the\ndescription of the food were similar in both food composition tables. We\ncontinued to use the initial compilation's source for the rest of the foods,\nwhich was the USDA-SR for 105 foods. The revised database still had 93\nfoods with sugar content missing, so we imputed these values based on\nthe carbohydrate:sugar ratios of similar foods.\nDiet comparisons were based on a food grouping system developed at\nThe University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (23). By using this system,\nwe could summarize intake in a nutritionally and behaviorally mean-\ningful way. The system was developed by further disaggregating the\nmajor food groups of the USDA by fat and fiber content. The version we\nused had 107 food groups and, for this study, we added 3 more groups:\ncorn tortillas (including other corn products), wheat tortillas, and atole\n(corn- or other cereal-based Mexican beverages). We first performed the\nanalysis using all groups. Then, we focused only on the food groups that\nwere captured well by both surveys. In the MNS 1999, most of the intake\nwas reported by ingredient and not by the food as prepared, whereas, in\nthe NHANES, reporting the food as prepared was more common.\nTherefore, we observed, e.g., a higher consumption of oils, sugar, and\nflour and a lower consumption of hamburgers or other mixed dishes in\nthe MNS 1999 compared to the NHANES. Because this discrepancy\nresults from the way diet is reported and not from actual intake\ndifferences, we did not present information on these groups.\nFor adult and adolescent women, we wanted to capture the intake of\nsugar-sweetened beverages like coffee, tea, and fruit drinks. So, in both\nsurveys, we aggregated the beverage ingredients that were recorded\nseparately into a single food group. For example, if coffee, milk, and\nsugar were recorded as part of a single preparation, we combined that\ninformation into a single group called \"coffee with milk and sugar.\" We\nalso aggregated some foods groups that had similar nutritional or\nbehavioral values. In addition, we do not present the food groups that\ncomprised ,1% of the total energy intake per capita or food groups with\nnoncaloric items consumed by ,5% of the participants in either\nsubpopulation.\nStatistical analysis. Both the MNS 1999 and NHANES are complex\nsample surveys; therefore, we analyzed each of them separately using the\nappropriate weighted survey commands to account for the study designs\nand sampling methods. Diets can differ between subpopulations with\nrespect to the proportion of people consuming a specific food group and/\nor the amount of that food group each person consumes. Therefore, for\nexamination of dietary data patterns, we focused on 3 measures of a food\ngroup's intake: the percentage consuming each food group (percent\nMexican-American food acculturation 1899\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nconsuming); the mean percentage of total energy from that food/\nbeverage group among consumers (percent energy/consumers); and, for\nthe total sample, the mean percentage of total energy per capita (percent\nenergy/capita). The last is a summary of the first 2, because it is obtained\nby multiplying percent consuming by the percent energy/consumers.\nData are presented as means or percent 6 SEM.\nAge standardization based on census 2000 population data (10-y\ngroup distribution) was used for all adult women. Statistical compar-\nisons were performed with a z-test using the SE computed for each mean\nor proportion with survey commands, as previously suggested (24). In\nthis case, using the sample variance instead of the population variance\nwas a fair approximation because of our sample sizes. To confirm this,\nwe also computed the t test when possible; e.g., when comparing groups\ncoming from the same survey (NHANES), both the z-test and the t test\nwere concordant when identifying significant results (though results\nfrom t test are not shown). We adjusted the P-value for multiple\ncomparisons with Bonferroni correction. P , 0.01 was considered\nsignificant. All analyses were conducted in Stata 11.1 (StataCorp).\nResults\nDemographics. A few important differences in demographic\ncharacteristics existed (Table 1). NH-White adult women were\nslightly older compared to all other subpopulations (P , 0.01).\nThe proportion of adult women with less than a high school\neducation was higher in the Mexican and MAMX subpopula-\ntions compared to the MAUS and NH-Whites. Among children\n(7\u00ad11 y old), the proportion of overweight or obese individuals\n(BMI for age $85th percentile) (25) was significantly lower in\nthe Mexicans compared to all other subpopulations. However,\namong adult women, the proportion was significantly lower for\nNH-Whites compared to all other subpopulations.\nMexican vs. US diets: the positive and negative effects of\nfood acculturation. Total energy intake was lower in Mexicans\nof all ages than in all other subpopulations (P , 0.01) (Table 1),\nwhereas there were no significant differences among the US\nsubpopulations. Consequently, we present all dietary results as a\npercentage of energy/day (percent energy). Based on nutrients,\nMexicans had a more suitable dietary profile, with a lower\nproportion of energy from saturated fat and sugar compared to\nall other subpopulations (P , 0.01).\nWith respect to beverages, among adult women, we observed\na mix of positive and negative effects of acculturation to the US\ndiet. The proportion of participants consuming coffee without\nsugar was higher among Mexicans compared to all others,\nwhereas the proportion that consumed coffee with milk and\nsugar and tea with sugar was higher in the US subpopulations\nthan in Mexicans. (Fig. 1; Supplemental Table 4). In the case of\nsodas, the proportion that consumed regular soda was signifi-\ncantly higher among MAMX and MAUS compared to Mexi-\ncans, and the proportion consuming diet sodas was significantly\nhigher among MAUS and NH-White adult women compared to\nMexicans and MAMX.\nAlthough in all subpopulations a higher proportion preferred\nhigh-fat milk, a benefit of food acculturation was that the ratio\nof adult women drinking high-fat milk to those drinking low-fat\nmilk was lower in the US subpopulations (139.4 among\namong NH-Whites). The consumption of milk with chocolate\ndid not differ, and the proportion of adult women consuming\natole was higher in the Mexican population compared to all\nother subpopulations (P , 0.01).\nSimilar patterns across subpopulations were found in female\nadolescents and children (Supplemental Tables 1\u00ad3). As ex-\npected, a generally lower proportion of adolescents and children\nconsumed coffee and tea and a higher proportion consumed\nmilk and soda compared to adult women. Remarkably, consid-\nerably more Mexican children consumed coffee (30% of 7\u00ad11 y\nWith respect to food groups, we also noticed a mix of positive\nand negative adoptions (Table 2). Considering only food groups\nwith large differences in percent energy/capita ($4% difference\nbetween at least 2 subpopulations) among adult women (Fig. 2),\nthe positive aspects of acculturation included a higher intake of\nlow-fat meat and fish and high-fiber bread and a lower intake of\nlow-fiber bread and Mexican fast food among the US subpopu-\nlations compared to Mexicans. On the negative side of accultur-\nation to the US diet, we observed that consumption of dessert and\nsalty snacks as well as pizza and French fries was higher among\nthe US subpopulations. Another important difference was that\nMexicans had a remarkably greater consumption of corn tortillas.\nThe effects of acculturation in terms of percent energy/capita\ncan be due to a difference in percent consuming, percent energy/\nconsumers, or both. In the case of medium- and high-fat meat\nand eggs, nuts and seeds, ready-to-eat cereal, Mexican fast food,\nand pizza and French fries, the percent energy/consumers was\nbasically the same across all 4 subpopulations (P . 0.01)\n(Supplemental Table 4). This means that differences in percent\nenergy/capita were due to differences in percent consuming. On\nthe contrary, in the case of low-fiber bread, corn tortillas, and\ndessert and salty snacks, both the percent consuming and\npercent energy/consumers differed among subpopulations in the\nsame direction as percent energy/capita. This means that, e.g.,\nthe higher percent energy/capita in corn tortilla consumption\nobserved among Mexicans was due to both a higher percent\nconsuming and a higher percent energy/consumers.\nThe general patterns in adult women were fairly similar to\nthose among female adolescents and children. Nevertheless, the\nintakes (percent energy/capita) of ready-to-eat cereal, dessert\nand salty snacks, pizza, and French fries were higher in female\nadolescents and children compared to adult women; also, the\nintake of corn tortillas was lower in children 2\u00ad6 y old than in\nadult women (Supplemental Tables 1\u00ad4).\nWhen we aggregated many food groups into healthy and\nunhealthy options (Fig. 3), we saw that the percent energy/capita\nof healthy foods was significantly higher among Mexicans\ncompared to all other subpopulations if we included tortillas in\nthis category. However, if we did not include tortillas as a\nhealthy item, then the percent energy/capita of healthy foods\nwas lower or similar among Mexicans compared to the US\nsubpopulations. In the case of unhealthy foods, the percent\nenergy/capita generally increased as we moved from Mexicans\nto NH-Whites. In addition, unhealthy foods provided a higher\nproportion of energy intake for children and female adolescents\nThe influence of the Mexican diet on the MA population.\nWhen we ordered the data by degree of exposure to the US\nenvironment (Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, and NH-White), we\nnoticed in most of the food groups and in the healthy or\nunhealthy categories, a linear pattern between the percent\nenergy/capita and the subpopulation's degree of US exposure\n(Supplemental Tables 1\u00ad4; Fig. 2). This may reflect a decrease in\nthe influence of the Mexican diet within MA generations.\nImportant exceptions to this linear pattern were fruits and\nvegetables and fruit juices, in which MAMX had a significantly\nhigher intake compared to all other subpopulations, especially\namong adult women.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nAnother important finding was that the differences among\nsubpopulations were mainly between Mexicans and all of the US\nsubpopulations. We saw some differences between MAMX and\nMAUS or between MAMX and NH-Whites, but we did not find\na difference $5% in percent energy/capita when we compared\nthe MAUS to the NH-White subpopulation. This could be an\nindication that the influence of the Mexican diet relative to that\nof the American diet was almost absent in the MAUS subpop-\nulation. In addition, for children and female adolescents, the\ninfluence of the Mexican diet might be even lower among the\nMAMX subpopulation. There were fewer significant differences\nwhen we compared MAMX to MAUS among children and\nfemale adolescents than among adult women. Also, fewer\nsignificant differences across all subpopulations were found\namong children 2\u00ad6 y old compared to other age groups when\naggregating foods into healthy or unhealthy options.\nTABLE 1 Sample characteristics and mean daily nutrient intake of Mexicans (MNS 1999), MA,\nMexican MAMX MAUS NH-White\nDaily nutrient intake\nDaily nutrient intake\nDaily nutrient intake\nDaily nutrient intake\n1 Values are means or percent 6 SEM.

The beneficial\ndietary aspects we found included increased intake of low-fat\nmeat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk and decreased\nconsumption of low-fiber bread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast\nfood. The deleterious aspects we found in our comparison\nincluded increased intake of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and\nsalty snacks, pizza, and French fries. Overall, when we aggre-\ngated foods into healthy or unhealthy categories, the percent\nenergy/capita of unhealthy foods was higher among the US\nsubpopulations. The results for the healthy category depended\non how tortillas were classified. The percent energy/capita of\nhealthy foods was highest in Mexicans, relative to the US\nsubpopulations, when tortillas were included and lower or\nsimilar in Mexicans when tortillas were excluded.\nThe largest difference was the much lower consumption of\ncorn tortillas among MA compared to Mexicans. Corn tortillas\nare a low-fat, low-sodium, and high-fiber food that could be\nconsidered as healthy and, therefore, the lower intake of this\nfood among MA may be classified as a negative effect of food\nacculturation. However, minimal research has focused on the\nhealthfulness of tortillas. About 25% of the energy per capita\namong Mexicans came from corn tortillas; thus, if a reduction in\ntortilla intake promotes the inclusion of more varied and\nhealthier foods in the diet, which we cannot determine, this\nreduction might be viewed as beneficial.\nThe main contribution of this study is that it included the\ndiets of Mexican residents of ages comparable to the ages of the\nUS subpopulations included. This allowed a clearer identifica-\ntion of the reasons for the similarities and differences between\nforeign-born and US-born MA. We could assess if these differ-\nences are related to influences of Mexican origin or to other\nunique features of these subpopulations. For most of the food\ngroups, we found a fairly linear pattern between the percent\nenergy/capita and the degree of exposure to the US environment.\nThis means that the differences between MAMX and MAUS\nsubpopulations could be seen as steps moving from the Mexican\nto the American diet. However, for some food groups, notably\nfruits and vegetables, fruit juices, and fruit drinks, the MAMX\nsubpopulation had the highest percent energy/capita intake\namong adult women.\nFruit and vegetable intake has been repeatedly reported as\nhigher among the MAMX subpopulation or first-generation\nHispanics compared to the MAUS or second-generation His-\ndiet does not include a high intake of fruits and vegetables. A\nstudy that retrospectively evaluated the diets of women of\nMexican descent living in California prior to and after their\nmigration found that the consumption of vegetables and fruit\njuices increased after migration (28). The authors noted that, in a\ntraditional Mexican diet, vegetables were used mainly as ingre-\ndients in the preparation of soups, rice, pasta, and meat, whereas\nsalads and vegetable side dishes that were less common in Mexico\nwere consumed more frequently after immigration to the US. This\nmay explain why, in our results, the MAMX adult subpopulation\nconsumed more fruits and vegetables than the Mexicans. How-\never, it remains unclear why the MAMX subpopulation has a\nhigher intake of fruits and vegetables compared to the MAUS\nsubpopulation in this and previous studies.\nBy adding NH-Whites to our comparison, we were able to put\ninto perspective the importance of the Mexican influence on MA\npopulations. We can see that the diets of MAMX and MAUS had\nmore in common with the American diet than with the Mexican\nFIGURE 1 The percentage of Mexican, MA, and NH-White (NHANES 1999-2006) adult women consuming different types of beverages. n =\ncorrection).

This was especially true for the diets of the MAUS\nsubpopulation, which showed very few significant differences\nfrom that of the NH-White subpopulation. Moreover, the differ-\nences seemed to be even fewer among children and female ado-\nlescents. Also, relative to the differences between the MAMX and\nthe Mexican diet, the differences between MAMX and MAUS\nseemed small; perhaps a stratification of MAMX by length of time\nin the US could enlarge the differences in this study.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous study has\nsimultaneously compared Mexican and MA diets with the\nobjective of assessing food acculturation. One earlier study\nexamined household food insecurity among 5-y-old children of\nMexican descent living in migrant communities in California\nand Mexico. The authors did not directly compare the Mexican\nand Californian children's diets due to slight differences in the\nFFQ used in each country. Nevertheless, that study notes a more\nfrequent intake of fruits, dairy, sweetened beverages, and fast\nfoods and a less frequent intake of tortillas among children living\nin California compared to those living in Mexico (29). Although\nwe did not use the exact same food groups or dietary measures,\nour results are in general consistent with this previous finding.\nNumerous studies have compared the diets of Hispanics with\ndifferent degrees of acculturation (30,31). Some of the studies\nthat used place of birth as a proxy for acculturation to compare\nthe diets of populations of Mexican descent reported results\nsimilar to ours for the common food groups studied. In addition\nto fruits and vegetables and fruit and vegetable juices mentioned\nabove, previous studies agreed that Mexican-born participants\nexhibited higher intakes of corn tortillas (15,26), legumes\nsodas (26) compared to US-born participants.\nThe higher overall percentage of energy per capita coming\nfrom unhealthy foods found among MAUS compared to\nMAMX might help explain why some studies have found higher\nBMI in the more acculturated MA than in those less acculturated\n(6\u00ad8). However, it is well known that NH-Whites have a lower\nprevalence of obesity compared to MA (9) and in this study we\nalso found that the intake of unhealthy foods was similar or\nslightly higher among NH-Whites than among MA. This\nsupports that the cause of obesity among MA is complex and\nthat other factors might interact with the diet.\nTABLE 2 Mean difference in percentage of total energy per capita between Mexicans (MNS 1999) and other US subpopulations\nFood groups\nMean difference in percent energy/capita between Mexicans and\n% energy/capita\nPositive effects of food acculturation\nHealthy foods with higher intake in the US\nUnhealthy foods with lower intake in the US\nNegative effects of food acculturation\nHealthy foods with lower intake in the US\nUnhealthy foods with higher intake in the US\nOther effects of food acculturation5\n1 Values are mean difference in percent energy/capita between Mexicans and each of the US subpopulations. *The difference of Mexicans vs. the US subpopulation (MAMX,\nin Mexico; MAUS, Mexican American born in the US; NH-White, non-Hispanic white; MNS, Mexican Nutrition Survey.\n5 This category includes the foods that were not classified as healthy or unhealthy (ready-to-eat cereals, corn tortillas, wheat tortilla, atole, and fruit juices) or foods with\ninconsistent results across groups (fruits and vegetables).\nMexican-American food acculturation 1903\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nAlthough the current study provided good insight regarding\nhow the country of birth influences food acculturation in MA\npopulations, we need to keep in mind that these results described\na scenario representative of roughly a decade ago.

A more recent national survey in Mexico in\nto the methodology used in NHANES. Many ongoing changes\nin both Mexico and the US might affect the differences among\nthe subpopulations in this study. For one, Mexico is undergo-\ning a nutrition transition. A significant increase in energy from\nbeverages was reported in Mexican preschoolers and school-age\nsweetened juices, and sugared coffee more than doubled in\nwomen in that time period (33). Based on the Mexican\nHousehold Income and Expenditure Surveys, the percentage of\nMexican households purchasing soda increased from 57% in\ncould hypothesize that Mexicans, due to their country's geo-\ngraphical proximity and highly influenced relationship with the\nUS, could be approximating the dietary profiles of the MA\ndescribed in this study.\nChanges in the US may also influence the food acculturation\nprocess. It has been suggested that, in areas of high Latino\ndensity, acculturation could be expected to occur in the opposite\ndirection; i.e. non-Hispanic Americans are becoming accultur-\nated into the Latino culture (31). Modifications in the US food\nsupply and increased availability of Mexican ingredients and\nfoods might also help MA preserve their original diets. The\ndifferences among NH-Whites, MA, and Mexican diets that\nexist now and in the near future can only be explored as new\nadequate data become available.\nOur results should be viewed with caution in the sense that\nwe compared data obtained from 2 different surveys. Even\nthough both countries used 24-h dietary recalls, some evident\nand nonevident survey differences might affect the results. An\nimportant evident difference was that, in Mexico, most of the\nintake was reported by ingredient, whereas in the US, a larger\nproportion was reported as the final prepared food. Although we\nmade an effort to combine the ingredients of key foods into a\nsingle food group, like beverages, and to report only food groups\nthat were captured well by both surveys, we still might have\nmissed some crucial information. Moreover, because the 24-h\nmethodology in Mexico did not include a 5-pass or similar\nprobing method, we cannot reject the possibility that the degree\nof underreporting or differential reporting of healthy or un-\nhealthy foods was different in the 2 surveys.\nAnother limitation of this study is that it does not include\ninformation on male adolescents and adults or on older adults of\neither gender. This fact severely limits the general picture we can\nget of how food acculturation affects the diets of all age and\ngender groups.\nWe also acknowledge that acculturation is a complex\nphenomenon that cannot be quantified by a simple static proxy\nindicator like birthplace. As has been suggested, the accultura-\ntion process is complex and multidimensional. Hispanics may\nbecome assimilated, integrated, segregated, or marginalized to\nthe American mainstream culture (31). Our intention in this\nstudy was therefore to use birthplace as a proxy of exposure to\nthe US environment rather than an overall measure of the degree\nof acculturation. We think that by assessing the Mexican and US\ninfluences on the diets of MA born in Mexico and those born in\nthe US, we are, indeed, approaching a better understanding of\nthe food acculturation process of these subpopulations with\ndifferent degrees of exposure to the US environment.\nIn sum, our results indicate that Mexicans in 1999 appeared\nto have eaten a healthier diet than US subpopulations between\nenvironment increased, the MA diet shifted toward an un-\nhealthier one. MAMX who had adopted many aspects of the US\ndiet but still preserved many from their original Mexican culture\nappeared to have healthier diets than MAUS. In addition, the\ndifferences between the MAUS and NH-White subpopulations\nwere minimal, suggesting that the food acculturation process\nmight be almost completed within one generation among the\nMA population. These results strengthen our understanding of\nacculturation to the American food environment among MA\nand they reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful\ncomponents of the American diet among MA.\n"
