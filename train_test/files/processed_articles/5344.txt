    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Several polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 genes are associated with\nthe development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Certain genetic polymorphisms may modify the deleterious effects\nof environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and may also modify the inherited risk. We investigated the associa-\ntion of six ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms with ESRD to determine whether a relationship exists between gene\u00adsmoking\ninteractions and ESRD.\nMaterials and methods: We performed a case-control association study and genotyped 683 ESRD patients and 653 healthy\npolymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction\u00adrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nResults: Significant associations were observed between ACE I/D and G2350A polymorphisms and ESRD. There was\nno difference in ACE2 genotype distribution between ESRD patients and healthy controls. Haplotype analysis showed\nthat DAA and DAT haplotypes were risk factors for ESRD. Moreover, a gene\u00adenvironment interaction was observed\nbetween ACE I/D polymorphism and cigarette smoking.\nConclusion: ACE I/D and ACE G2350A polymorphisms were associated with the development of ESRD. The interac-\ntion between ACE I/D polymorphism and smoking is also associated with an enhanced risk of ESRD.\n",

Moreover, the exact\nmechanism by which ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms\naffect ESRD progression is unclear. We hypothesized that\ninteractions between multiple genetic variants of ACE and\nACE2 and smoking status are associated with ESRD.\nTherefore, in this study, we investigated the association of\nACE and ACE2 gene polymorphisms, and interactions\nbetween these gene polymorphisms and smoking status,\nwith ESRD susceptibility.\nMaterial and methods\nvisiting the Cardinal Tien Hospital and five haemodialysis\ncentres in Taipei, Taiwan. The enrolled patients were sta-\nble (without clinical complications), aged over 20 years\nand had undergone haemodialysis (HD) for more than 6\nmonths. Patients with autoimmune diseases, malignancy\nand acute or chronic infections were excluded. The cause\ntensive nephropathy in 83 patients (12.2%), systemic\npatients (8.2%). The study also included 653 healthy con-\n\u00b1 13.59 years) from the Center of Physical Examination of\nthe Cardinal Tien Hospital, with an estimated glomerular\nteinuria. The healthy controls had no kidney damage, pro-\nteinuria, haematuria or abnormalities on abdominal\nultrasonography. Clinical information and biochemical\nparameters were obtained retrospectively from hospital\nrecords. The study was reviewed and approved by the\ninstitutional ethical committee of the Cardinal Tien\nwas obtained from all participants after giving them a\ncomplete explanation of the study.\nCigarette smoking\nCigarette smoking status (current, former, never) was\nascertained at the time of enrollment. Individuals who had\nnot smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were\nclassified as never-smokers, based on common conventions\nin epidemiologic research.17 Former smokers were those\nwho had smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes\nbut did not currently smoke.18 Current smokers were\ndefined as those who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes\nin their lifetimes and still smoked at the time of the survey.\nCurrent and former smokers were grouped together in the\nsmoker's group, and their data were compared with those\nof individuals in the never-smoker's group to determine the\neffect of smoking on development of ESRD.\nGenomic DNA extraction and\ngenotyping\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood sam-\nples by standard procedures with proteinase K (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) digestion and phenol/chloroform\nphisms were screened using polymerase chain reaction\u00ad\nrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).\nPrimers were designed using published sequences20 or\nprimer Z software (http://genepipe.ngc.sinica.edu.tw/prim-\nerz/beginDesign.do). The PCR program included the fol-\nlowing steps: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were\ndigested with the respective restriction endonucleases (New\nEngland Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and the resulting\nfragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 3.0% aga-\nrose gel containing 0.5 g/mL ethidium bromide at 100 V and\nvisualised under UV light. Genotyping was performed by\nblinding the case or control status. Two independent investi-\ngators interpreted the pictures from each gel, and all ambig-\nuous samples were analysed twice. To validate genotyping\nresults, at least 10% samples were randomly selected for\nrepeated genotyping.\nStatistical analysis\nFor each SNP, deviation from the Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium (HWE) was assessed using the standard 2 test.\nGenotypic and allelic frequencies were compared between\nESRD patients and healthy controls using the 2 test or\nFisher's exact test, when appropriate. The demographics\nwere evaluated using Student's t-test for continuous varia-\nbles and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).\nLogistic regression analysis was used to estimate the crude\nand adjusted (age, gender, body mass index and smoking)\nodd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as\nmeasures of association with the risk of ESRD. Linkage dis-\nequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses were performed\nusing Haploview software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/\nhaploview/).21 The interaction was tested using a term of the\nproduct of two variables in a multiple logistic regression\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS\n18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nBasic characteristics of the study population\nTable 1 shows the characteristics and biochemical and clin-\nical data of the studied individuals.

Our study also presents sta-\ntistical evidence of significant association between ACE\nI/D SNP and smoking status interaction and the risk of\ndeveloping ESRD. These findings support our hypothesis\nthatACE gene polymorphisms and potential gene\u00adsmoking\ninteractions may contribute to ESRD susceptibility.\nPrevious studies showed that the ACE I/D polymorphism\nwas expressed phenotypically by significant variations in\nACE serum levels, with DD individuals having the highest\nlevels.22 The increased level of ACE is associated with the\npathogenesis of renal disease. ACE I/D polymorphism has\nbeen studied extensively in relation to ESRD23,24; however,\nthe findings of these studies remain controversial. Previous\nstudies have indicated that a significant association exists\nbetween the DD gene and ESRD risk in Caucasians25,26 and\nEast Asians27,28; however, this association is not observed in\nthe Turkish population.29 Our results are consistent with those\nof studies in Caucasians and East Asians, which indicate that\nthe ACE DD genotype is associated with a significantly ele-\nvated risk of ESRD. This suggests the presence of a geogra-\nphy- or ethnicity-specific difference in the ACE gene and the\nassociation of gene polymorphisms and ESRD risk.\nSeveral studies have reported that serum and plasma\nA-240T31 polymorphisms. In this study, we also found an\nassociation between ACE G2350A polymorphism in a Han\nChinese population; however, no association was observed\nwith ACE A-240T polymorphism. Carriers of the A allele\nof ACE polymorphism were more frequent in the patient\ngroup than in the control group. Our results are consistent\nwith those of previous studies, which indicate that the ACE\n2350A allele is associated with a significantly elevated risk\nof chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension in the\nHan Chinese population.\nMany genes of the RAS pathway have been assessed for\ntheir associations with ESRD. However, research on the\nACE2 gene is limited. The ACE2 gene is located on the\nXp22 chromosome, contains 18 exons and is mainly\nexpressed in the kidney. The ACE2 gene has been impli-\ncated in kidney disease, hypertension and cardiac func-\ntion.32 Previous studies have also shown that expression of\nthe ACE2 gene is altered in the diabetic rat kidney33 and in\nhumans with renal diseases.34 This suggests that an associa-\ntion exists between ACE2 gene variants and ESRD.\nHowever, no associations were observed between ESRD\nand ACE2 gene polymorphisms in this study. ACE2 poly-\nmorphisms may have a small effect on susceptibility to\nESRD, but we were unable to detect such an effect.\nThe biological consequences of gene\u00adsmoking interac-\ntions have been investigated extensively over recent years.\nSmoking is one of the established risk factors of ESRD, but\nits exact pathogenesis has not yet been clarified. Several\nstudies have already reported that smoking status may\ninfluence the effects of the ACE genotype on peripheral\narterial disease (PAD)35 and endothelial function.36 In the\npresent study, the interaction between ACE I/D polymor-\nphism and cigarette smoking had an additive effect on the\nrisk of developing ESRD. Smokers with the variant geno-\ntype (ACE DD) had the highest risk of developing ESRD.\nOur results are consistent with those of previous studies.\nButler et al. reported a significant blunting of the endothe-\nlial function in DD carriers, especially in smokers.37\nAnother study showed that the D allele was associated with\nincreased systolic blood pressure in smokers.38 Sayed-\nTabatabaei et al. showed a combined effect of smoking and\nthe ACE gene on intima media thickness (IMT), with a sig-\nnificant increase in the mean carotid IMT in current smok-\ners carrying the D allele.39\nSeveral studies indicate that high levels of LD exist\nacross the ACE gene.40,41 Haplotype analysis performed in\na previous study showed an association between the ACE\nhaplotype and major depressive disorder.42 Wetmore et al.\nshowed that the ACE haplotype is associated with survival\nin a cohort with prevalent ESRD.43 Our data showed that\nESRD patients carrying the DAA or DAT haplotype had a\nhigher risk of developing ESRD than those not carrying\nthese haplotypes. To test the potential of the genes high-\nlighted by haplotype research more completely, a follow-up\nstudy that explores the role of haplotypes on genetic sus-\nceptibility to ESRD might be desirable.\nIn conclusion, this case-control study in a Han Chinese\npopulation showed that ACE I/D and G2350A polymor-\nphisms may modulate the risk of development of ESRD. No\nassociation was observed between ACE2 polymorphism\nand ESRD susceptibility. ACE polymorphism and smoking\ninteractions confer an increased risk of developing ESRD,\nindicating that ACE gene polymorphisms might identify\nsmokers who are more susceptible to ESRD. However,\nthese results must be confirmed in future studies.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by grants from the Cardinal Tien\nHospital and Bureau of Health Promotion, Taiwan, ROC\nReferences\n2.
