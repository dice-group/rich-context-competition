Subjects with primary caregiver-reported\ninformation on ACE exposures ascertained at 5 years and teacher-reported outcomes at the\nend of the child's kindergarten year were included. Outcomes included teacher ratings of\nacademic skills, emergent literacy skills, and behavior. We included 8 ACE exposures on the\nbasis of the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kaiser study and created\nan ACE score by summing individual adversities. We examined the associations between\nteacher-reported academic and behavioral outcomes and ACE scores by using logistic\nregression.\nRESULTS: In the study sample, 1007 children were included. Fifty-five percent had\nexperienced 1 ACE and 12% had experienced  3. Adjusting for potential confounders,\nexperiencing  3 ACEs was associated with below-average language and literacy skills\n(adjusted odds ratio [AORs]: 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1\u00ad2.9) and math skills\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study of urban children, experiencing ACEs in early childhood was\nassociated with below-average, teacher-reported academic and literacy skills and behavior\nproblems in kindergarten.

Adverse\nExperiences in Early Childhood and Kindergarten\nchildhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with\npoor health outcomes in children and adults. Little is\nknown regarding links between adverse experiences\nin early childhood and academic and behavioral\noutcomes in kindergarten.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: ACEs in early childhood\nwere associated with poor academic skills and\nbehavior problems in kindergarten, which are\nstrong predictors of educational trajectory. These\nfindings underscore the importance of integrated\napproaches for addressing the developmental needs\nof vulnerable young children.\nEarly childhood experiences lay the\nfoundation for well-being throughout\nthe life course.1 The rapid pace of\nchild development and brain growth\nfrom birth through age 5 make it a\ncritical time period of opportunity\nand vulnerability.2 Several studies\nhave linked adverse childhood\nexperiences (ACEs), broadly defined\nas household dysfunction and abuse,\nto poor health outcomes.3\u00ad7 More\nrecent work has linked ACEs with\nlower levels of school engagement in\nmiddle childhood and adolescence.8\nMost studies linking ACEs to poor\noutcomes rely on adult recall of\nevents before age 18 and provide\nlimited information about exposures\ntaking place in the critical birth-to-\nage-5 time period. Although ACEs\nin early childhood have been linked\nto poor physical health outcomes,9\nlittle is known regarding associations\nbetween early childhood ACEs and\ndevelopmental and behavioral\noutcomes.\nTo address this gap, we used a unique\nbirth cohort to explore associations\nbetween ACEs and academic skills\nincluding literacy and behavior in\nkindergarten. We focus on these\noutcomes in kindergarten because\nacademic skills and behaviors at\nthat time point are strong predictors\nof educational trajectory.10 We\nhypothesized that ACEs in the\nbirth-to-age-5 time period would\nbe associated with poor teacher-\nreported academic skills including\nemergent literacy and behavior\ndifficulties.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Data Source\nWe conducted a secondary analysis\nof data from the Fragile Families and\nChild Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). The\nFFCWS birth cohort consists of nearly\nBy design, most children in the study\nwere born to unmarried parents.\nThis longitudinal data set includes\npostpartum interviews with mothers\nand fathers, follow-up interviews\nafter the child's birth, and in-home\nchild assessments and educator\ninterviews at key time points. A more\ndetailed description can be found\nutilizes data on ACEs reported in the\nmother's 5-year follow-up interview\n(which took place when the child\nwas 61 months old, on average), as\nwell as data on teacher-reported\nschool performance in the last month\nof the child's kindergarten year.\nBecause mothers were asked to recall\ninformation about past exposures\nand the teacher interviews occurred\nwell after the mother's interviews,\nthe exposures clearly preceded the\noutcomes.\nStudy Population\nThe study sample was limited to\nchildren for whom teacher-reported\noutcomes as well as primary\ncaregiver-report information on 8\nACE exposures on the basis of the\nCenters for Disease Control and\nPrevention Kaiser ACE study13 were\navailable. Given 98% of primary\ncaregivers in the sample were\nbiological mothers, we refer to them\ngenerically as mothers in this article.\nOutcomes\nTeacher-Reported Academic Outcomes\nThe children's teachers were\nasked to rate the child's academic\nskills during the last month of\nthe child's kindergarten year on\na 5-point Likert scale (\"far below\naverage\" to \"far above average\")\nin the following: (1) literacy, (2)\nscience and social studies, and (3)\nmath. We created a dichotomous\nvariable (\"far below average\" or\n\"below average\" versus all others).\nTo explore literacy in depth, we also\nanalyzed teacher-rated emergent\nliteracy skills during the last month\nof kindergarten. Teachers rated these\nskills on a 5-point Likert scale (\"not\nyet\" to \"proficient\") and answers\nwere dichotomized to \"not yet\" or\n\"beginning\" versus all others.\nTeacher-Reported Behavior Problems\nTeachers were asked to describe\nchild classroom behavior during\nthe last month of kindergarten\nby using questions from the Child\nBehavior Checklist.14 Teachers\nrated statements about child\nbehavior as \"not true,\" \"somewhat\nor sometimes true,\" and \"very\ntrue or often true\" for the child.\nScores were summed for each of\n3 subscales (attention problems,\nsocial problems, and aggression)\nassigning values of 1 for not true, 2\nfor somewhat or sometimes true,\nand 3 for very true or often true, with\nhigher scores representing greater\nbehavior difficulties. We created a\ndichotomous variable for scores in\nthe top 10th percentile versus lower.\nMissing data for outcome variables\nExposures\nACE measures were created from\nmaternal reports at 5 years. These\ncovered 9 out of the 10 ACEs included\nin the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention Kaiser ACE study,13\nalthough emotional and physical\nneglect were characterized by using a\nsingle measure because the available\ninformation did not allow us to\ndistinguish between the 2. We did not\ninclude parental divorce/separation\nas an ACE because the FFCWS\noversampled nonmarital births, and\nrecent qualitative work with urban\nyouth did not endorse parental\ndivorce/separation as an ACE\nbecause many children had parents\nwho were never married.15 Overall,\nour measures of ACEs included 4\ncategories of child maltreatment\n(physical, sexual, psychological\nabuse, and neglect) and 4 categories\nof household dysfunction (substance\nuse, mental illness, caregiver treated\nviolently, and incarceration).\nIndividual ACEs were dichotomized\nas exposed or not and then summed\nto create a score ranging from 0 to\n8. We then created a categorical\nvariable consisting of \"0,\" \"1,\" \"2,\" and\n\"3\" ACEs on the basis of the sample\ndistribution.\nChild Maltreatment\nThe FFWCS contains information\nregarding child maltreatment in 2\nforms: (1) The mother was directly\nasked whether Child Protective\nServices (CPS) had been contacted\nfor the child regarding physical,\nsexual abuse and/or neglect since\nthe child was born, and (2) mothers\ncompleted the Parent-Child Conflict\nTactics Scale(CTS-PC)16 in reference\nto their own behavior and the child's\nsecondary caregiver's behavior (if\napplicable). The CTS-PC screens\nfor child maltreatment and has 3\nrelevant domains: psychological\naggression, physical assault, and\nneglect. The FFCWS includes 5\nitems about physical assault (eg,\nhit, slapped), 5 items about neglect\n(eg, failure to provide supervision),\nand 5 items regarding psychological\naggression (eg, threatened). The\nmother was asked how many times\neach behavior occurred in the\nresponses were assigned a score (0\nfor never or not in the past year, 1 for\nevent occurred once, 2 for twice, 4\nand we created a dichotomous\nvariable considering domain scores\nin the top 10th percentile as high risk\nfor maltreatment.\nPsychological aggression was\nconsidered present on the basis of\nthe CTS-PC score for the mother\nand/or secondary caregiver.\nNeglect and physical abuse were\nconsidered positive on the basis of\nthe CTS-PC score for the mother\nand/or secondary caregiver and/\nor if the mother reported CPS\ninvolvement for the relevant\ndomain.\nSexual abuse was considered\npositive if the mother reported CPS\ninvolvement for sexual abuse.\nHousehold Dysfunction\nMental illness: Maternal depressive\nsymptoms, which were included\nunder the \"mental illness\" category\nin the original ACE study,13 were\nassessed with the Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview-\nShort Form. The Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview-\nShort Form has been used in\npast studies and categorizes\nrespondents as having experienced\na depressive episode in the past 12\nmonths on the basis of Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders, Fourth Edition criteria.19\nSubstance use: Mothers were asked,\n\"In the past 12 months, was there\never a time when your drinking or\nbeing hung over interfered with\nyour work at school, or a job, or\nat home?\" and \"Did you use any\nof these drugs during the past 12\nmonths?\" They were also asked\nwhether the biological father and\ncurrent partner if applicable \"had\nproblems such as keeping a job\nor getting along with family and\nfriends because of alcohol or drug\nuse?\" An affirmative response\nfor the mother, father, or current\nlive-in partner was considered an\nexposure.\nIncarceration: Incarceration was\nassessed by maternal report of\nwhether the child's father had\nspent time in prison or jail in the\npast 2 years, whether a current\nlive-in partner spent most of the\nprevious week in jail or prison, and\nwhether she had been convicted\nof a crime during the past 2 years.\nAlthough conviction does not\nalways result in incarceration, it\nstill may cause turbulence in the\nchild's life. An affirmative response\nfor any of these was considered an\nexposure.\nCaregiver treated violently: This\ninformation was based on\nquestions that were drawn from\nthe Conflict Tactic Scale, as well as\nqualitative interviews with victims\nof domestic violence20 and have\nQuestions explored physical and\nsexual violence (eg, slap or kicks,\nhits with fist, tries to make you\nhave sex) by the biological father\nor current partner in the past year.\nA reply of \"sometimes\" or \"often\"\nto any items as opposed to \"never\"\nwas considered an exposure.\nWe also considered whether the\nmother had a physical fight with\nthe biological father or current\npartner (if applicable) in front of\nthe child in the past 2 years and\nwhether she had been seriously\nhurt in a fight with the father or\ncurrent partner (if applicable),\nwith an affirmative response\nconsidered an exposure.\nCovariates\nGuided by past studies,6,7,9 we\ncontrolled for the child's age (in\nmonths) and gender, the mother's\nrace and ethnicity, the mother's\neducation and the relationship\nstatus of the parents at the time of\nchild's birth, and household income\nat the time of the 5-year follow-up\n(dichotomized based on the poverty\nthreshold for a family of 4). We used\nan imputed variable for household\nincome provided by the FFCWS given\nSupplementary models included\nbirth weight, maternal report of the\nchild's health status, and the number\nof siblings as covariates.\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, we computed sample\ncharacteristics. Next, we assessed\nindependent variables for\ncolinearity and found none to be\nhighly correlated (r  0.7). Then\nwe estimated both unadjusted and\nadjusted logistic regression models\nof associations between ACEs and\nthe outcomes of interest. Finally, we\nassessed sensitivity to construction\nof key measures and model\nspecification. We used Stata 13 (Stata\nCorp, College Station, TX) to conduct\nall analyses.\nThe Rutgers Biomedical Health\nSciences Institutional Review Board\ndetermined this study to be exempt.\nRESULTS\nStudy Sample\nmothers in the original FFCWS\nsample completed 5-year follow-up\nanalysis sample) had available data\nfrom their children's kindergarten\nteachers and mother-reported\ninformation on ACEs. At 5 years, 97%\nof mothers in our sample reported\nliving with their child most of the\ntime, 26% reported a romantic\nrelationship with a new partner, and\n56% of mothers with new partners\nreported living with their current\npartner most of the time (results not\nshown).\nSociodemographic characteristics of\nthe study sample are summarized\nin Table 1 along with corresponding\nmeasures for the full 5-year follow-up\nsample. Almost half of children in the\nsample were African American and\none quarter were Latino. Although\nonly 27% of the mothers were\nmarried to the father of the child at\nthe time of the birth, the majority\nof parents (93%) had some kind\nof a relationship. Socioeconomic\ncharacteristics were similar for the 2\nsamples.\nForty-five percent of the children had\nmost common ACEs were exposure\nto incarceration and physical\nand psychological abuse. African\nAmerican children and children\nmore likely than their non-African\nAmerican and higher income\ncounterparts to experience at least 1\nACE (Supplemental Table 6).\nApproximately one quarter of the\nchildren had below-average teacher-\nrated literacy skills and math skills\n(Table 3). Not yet or beginning\nratings by teachers ranged from 10%\nto 26% for emergent literacy skills\n(Table 4). A general pattern of worse\nacademic, literacy, and behavior\noutcomes with increased number of\nACEs is apparent (Tables 3, 4, and\n5). The average number of ACEs for\nchildren with poor academic and\nbehavioral outcomes was higher for\ncompared with those without\nLogistic Regression Analysis\nIn unadjusted models, experiencing\n1 ACE was associated with poor\nteacher-reported language and\nliteracy skills (odds ratio [OR]:\nas well as not yet or beginning to\nunderstand and interpret a story\nor other text read to the child (OR:\nfound that 1 ACE was associated\nTABLE 1 Demographic Characteristics\n(No.)\nGender\nRace\nEthnicity\nMaternal educationb\nParents' relationship statusb\nIncomed\na Mothers interviewed during FFCWS 5-y wave.\nb At birth of child.\nc Includes mothers who responded that they \"hardly talk\" with the biological father, \"never talk\" talk with the biological\nfather, or the biological father is unknown.\nd Includes imputed data.\nTABLE 2 Adverse Childhood Experiences (n =\nVariable % (No.)\nChild maltreatment\nHousehold dysfunction\nTotal ACEs\nwith teacher-reported attention\nand aggressive behavior (OR:\nexceptions, increased ACEs were\nassociated with increased odds\nof below-average academic skills\nand behavior problems.

Relative to\nchildren with no ACEs, children who\nexperienced ACEs had increased odds\nof having below-average academic\nskills including poor literacy skills,\nas well as attention problems,\nsocial problems, and aggression,\nplacing them at significant risk for\npoor school achievement, which is\nassociated with poor health.23 Our\nstudy adds to the growing literature\non adverse outcomes associated\nACEs during early childhood as a\nrisk factor for child academic and\nbehavioral problems that have\nimplications for education and health\ntrajectories, as well as achievement\ngaps and health disparities.\nOur findings add insight into the\npathways linking early childhood\nadversity to poor adult wellbeing.29\nComplementing past work that\nfocused on physical health,9 our\nfindings provide information\nabout links between ACEs and\nearly childhood outcomes at the\nintersection of learning, behavior,\nand health.29 We found that ACEs\nexperienced in early childhood were\nassociated with poor foundational\nskills, such as language and literacy,\nthat predispose individuals to low\neducational attainment and adult\nliteracy, both of which are related\nproblems, social problems, and\naggression were also associated with\nACEs and also have the potential to\ninterfere with children's educational\nexperience given known associations\nbetween self-regulatory behavior\nConsistent with the original ACE\nstudy and subsequent research,\nwe found that exposure to more\nACEs was associated with more\nadverse outcomes, suggesting a\ndose\u00adresponse association.3\u00ad8 In fact,\nexperiencing 3 ACEs was associated\nwith below-average performance\nor problems in every outcome\nexamined.\nOur findings highlight the cross-\nsector nature of the associations\nbetween ACEs and wellbeing.\nGiven their frequent contact\nwith children,36 pediatricians\nare uniquely positioned to detect\nboth ACEs and associated adverse\ndevelopmental and behavioral\noutcomes and to link families to\ncommunity resources that can\nprovide necessary assistance and\nfoster resilience. Bright Futures, the\nAAP health promotion initiative,\nprovides resources for pediatricians\nto detect both ACEs and adverse\ndevelopmental outcomes.36\nPrograms like Reach Out and Read, in\nwhich pediatricians distribute books\nand model reading, simultaneously\npromote emergent literacy and\nparent\u00adchild relationships through\ncannot be addressed in isolation\nand require collaborative efforts\nwith partners in the education,\nhome visitation, and other social\nservice sectors in synergistic efforts\nto strengthen families.29 In this\nway, programs like Help Me Grow39\nthat create streamlined access\nto early childhood services for\nat-risk children can play a critical\nrole in building an integrated\nsystem that connects families to\nneeded resources to enhance the\ndevelopment of vulnerable children.\nOur study is subject to limitations.\nCausality cannot be inferred\nfrom our findings. Although we\ncontrolled for several confounders\nTABLE 5 Association Between ACEs and Teacher-Rated Behavior\nOutcome No. of ACE\nExposures\nSample Sizea Prevalence, % OR (95% CI) Adjusted OR (95% CI)b\nTeacher rating of behavior\na Sample sizes not equal because of missing data.\nb Adjusted for child age, gender, race, ethnicity, and income, as well as maternal education and parent relationship status at birth of child.\nc Score in top 10th percentile on teacher-rated Child Behavior Checklist subscales.\nthat had little impact on the\nobserved associations, there may\nbe unmeasured factors that account\nfor the associations between\nACEs in early childhood and end-\nof-year kindergarten outcomes.\nThe study sample was from large\ncities; our findings therefore do\nnot necessarily generalize to all\nsettings. For example, in a national\nsample of kindergarteners in\nthe spring of the academic year,\n95% were considered proficient\nin letter recognition.40 In our\nsample, ~10% could not yet or\nwere just beginning to easily\nrecognize letters. We limited our\nsample to children with available\ninformation on ACEs. Although\nour estimates were insensitive to\nincluding children with missing\nACEs information and coding them\nas not exposed, it is possible that\nwe underestimated ACEs in our\nstudy. Similarly ACE information\nrelied on maternal reports and we\nused relatively high thresholds for\nthe standardized scales assessing\nchild abusive behavior, both of\nwhich could have underestimated\nACEs. We did not include direct\nassessments of academic skills.\nHowever, teachers are professionals,\nobserve many children, and are\nindependent reporters from the\nmothers, and previous work\nrevealed that teacher assessments\nof reading skills in kindergarten are\npredictive of outcomes on direct\nreading assessments in first and\nthird grade.41 Finally, richer data\nwould have enriched the analyses.\nInformation from the 1- and 3-year\nfollow-up interviews had insufficient\ndetail to allow us to incorporate\nACEs ascertained at those time\npoints. Information on the nature\nand characteristics ACEs (eg, timing,\nchronicity) was also unavailable. We\nwere unable to distinguish between\nemotional and physical neglect with\nour data, and because emotional\nneglect is independently associated\nwith poor outcomes, future work\nwould benefit from distinguishing\nthe 2.42 Also we were unable to\nconsider fathers' and partners'\nreports of the mother being violent\nagainst them without a large sample\nloss; given that violence often occurs\nwould benefit by incorporating\nthis information. Despite\nthese limitations, the current\nstudy assesses both ACEs and\ndevelopmental outcomes by using\nseveral standardized instruments\nat important points during a critical\nstage of the life course that has been\nunderstudied in this context.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study revealed strong links\nbetween ACEs in early childhood and\npoor academic readiness by the end\nof kindergarten, which place children\nat elevated risk for poor educational\nachievement and subsequent health.\nThus, adverse outcomes associated\nwith ACE exposure begin in early\nchildhood and impact multiple\naspects of children's lives. The\nfindings from this study underscore\nthe need for integrated cross-\nsector approaches to enhance the\ndevelopment of vulnerable children.\n"
