Liver-related mortality among those infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been described,\nbut little is known about non\u00adliver-related mortality. Our objective was to determine HCV-associated all-cause,\nliver-, and non\u00adliver-related mortality in the general US population.\nMethods. A prospective cohort study of 9378 nationally representative adults aged 17\u00ad59 years was performed\nutilizing the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) Linked Mortality File that\nResults. There were 614 deaths over a median follow-up of 14.8 years.

Chronic HCV all-cause mortality is more than twice that of HCV-negative individuals. This\nsuggests that those with chronic HCV infection are at a higher risk of death even after accounting for liver-related\nmorbidity and should be closely monitored.\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is a bloodborne infection\nthat affects nearly 2.2% of the world's population, or\nnewly infected cases progress to chronicity; of those,\n20%\u00ad30% will develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and\nliver failure, and 2%\u00ad5% will advance to hepatocel-\nlular carcinoma [2\u00ad6].\nIn the United States, data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES\nber of persons positive for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV\npositive) increased from 3.9 million persons in\nsame time period, the number of chronically infected\npersons (anti-HCV positive and HCV-RNA positive)\nincreased from 2.7 million to 3.2 million.

Approxi-\nHCV-associated end-stage liver disease is the leading indication\nfor liver transplantation among adults [9\u00ad11].\nMultiple studies have sought to quantify or project the\nburden of mortality from HCV. Data from the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that an\naverage of 12,000 HCV-related deaths from CLD occur each\nyear [12]. Other studies produced more modest findings and\n[13, 14]. These latter calculations were based on conservative\nestimates of deaths among individuals with CLD or HIV-\ninfected patients with concurrent HCV infection, rather than\na broadly representative sample of HCV-infected individuals\nfrom the US population.\nSince HCV is predominantly asymptomatic and not routinely\ntested for in the general US population, it is difficult to quantify\nthe overall long-term mortality burden, particularly among\nthose without liver disease. However, the recent release in 2010\nof the NHANES III Linked Mortality File with mortality follow-\nto address this question. In this study, we evaluated the associ-\nation of HCV status with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.\nSince mortality was ascertained in the same NHANES III par-\nticipants over 12\u00ad18 years, this study is a true prospective cohort\nstudy among HCV-infected individuals in a representative\nsample of the general US population.\nMETHODS\nStudy Participants\nParticipants from the NHANES III survey aged $17 years at\ninitial enrollment and with vital status follow-up data in 2006\nwere included in this analysis. NHANES III is a multistage\nCenter for Health Statistics [15] designed to represent\nnoninstitutionalized American civilians, which oversampled\nnon-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and older adults\n[16]. Our initial analysis included all participants $17 years\nparticipants aged 17\u00ad59 years for whom HCV covariate risk\nfactor information was available (including drug use and sexual\nactivity data), and additional covariate-adjusted analyses could\nbe performed. The University of Maryland School of Medicine\nInstitutional Review Board formally reviewed this study and\ndetermined the secondary analysis of this de-identified data set\nto be exempt.\nStudy Variables\nNHANES III survey and data collection procedures [15], and\ndetailed descriptions of laboratory assays and quality control\nprocedures are available elsewhere [17]. Briefly, NHANES in-\ncluded an interview, physical examination, and blood draw.\nTesting for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) was performed using\na second-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a supple-\nmental test (EIA 2.0 and HCV MATRIX, Abbott Laboratories).\nHCV-RNA was tested on anti\u00adHCV-positive samples using\nreverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction amplification\nof the 5# noncoding region (Boehringer Mannheim) [7].\nBody mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated using mea-\nsured height and weight. Self-reported number of alcoholic\nwere classified as ,1, 1\u00ad2, and .2 drinks/d, respectively. Par-\nticipants self-reported age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other), marital\nstatus, education, smoking status, lifetime number of sex\npartners, lifetime marijuana and cocaine use, and physician\ndiagnosis of cancer and diabetes. Poverty income ratio was\ncomputed as the total family income divided by the poverty\nthreshold based on year of interview, as defined by the US\nCensus Bureau.\nThis analysis used the 2010 public-release NHANES III\nLinked Mortality File which included mortality follow-up\ntional Death Index records using 12 identifying variables.\nMatching was validated via manual review of a subsample of\ndeath certificates. Cause of death was classified using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [18], for\nClassification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [19] for deaths\nbased on ICD-10 causes. The primary outcome studied was all-\ncause mortality. Mortality ascribed to liver-related causes in-\ncluding malignant neoplasm of liver (code C22), viral hepatitis\n(codes B15\u00adB19), alcoholic liver disease (code K70), and other\nchronic liver disease and cirrhosis (codes K73\u00adK74) was a sec-\nondary outcome.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo accommodate the complex survey design, we used the survey\npackage of R software version 2.10.0 [20]. We calculated stan-\ndard errors using linearization to account for stratification and\nclustering [21]. All estimates were weighted to represent the US\npopulation. Survey-weighted all-cause mortality rates and 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) stratified by HCV status, age, and sex\nwere calculated for participants aged $17 years. A separate\ncomparison for participants aged 17\u00ad59 years was made between\nanti-HCV negative, anti-HCV positive, and anti-HCV and\nHCV-RNA positive (chronic HCV infection), with respect to\nbaseline characteristics using Wald v2 tests or t-tests and\nall-cause mortality using weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves\nand weighted Cox proportional hazards models [22]. Those who\nwere anti-HCV positive but HCV-RNA negative were included\nwith those who were anti-HCV positive and RNA positive\n(chronic HCV infection) under the ``anti-HCV positive'' group\nand were not analyzed as a separate group due to small num-\nbers. Three models assessed associations of HCV status with\nmortality. First, we fit a model adjusted for age and sex, followed\nby a partially adjusted model that additionally included\ndemographics (race/ethnicity, marital status, education, poverty\nincome ratio), lifestyle behaviors (alcohol consumption, smok-\ning, lifetime cocaine and marijuana use, lifetime number of\nsexual partners), BMI, and comorbidities and viruses (cancer,\ndiabetes, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis E antibody). Finally, we\nfit a fully adjusted model that additionally included liver func-\ntion biomarkers (ALT and total bilirubin). We initially planned\nto adjust for hepatitis B virus surface antigen but excluded it due\nto data sparseness, given that only 45 participants tested positive\nfor it among whom only 4 were also positive for anti-HCV, and\nonly 3 were also positive for HCV-RNA. A sensitivity analysis\nshowed that exclusion of HBV had negligible impact on model\nestimates (data not shown).\nResults from the fully adjusted model were used to calculate\nexpected survival. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models\nwere also used to separately analyze liver-related and non\u00ad\nliver-related mortality. Due to small numbers of liver-related\nTable 1.

The\nestimates were calculated as weighted average annual mortality\nrates 3 N, where N was the estimated total population aged\n17-59 years who were anti-HCV positive or chronically HCV-\ninfected. We calculated the attributable risk percentage as\n(mortality rate ratio [MRR]-1)/MRR 3 100 from the fully\nadjusted Cox models. We performed similar calculations for\nliver-related and non\u00adliver-related deaths. All P-values were\n2-sided; P , .05 was considered statistically significant.\nWhile NHANES III did not collect data on HIV serostatus,\nwhich may confound the association between HCV and mortality,\nthe NHANES III Linked Mortality File included HIV as a cause\nof death (codes B20\u00adB24). As a sensitivity analysis, we reanalyzed\nthe data by censoring deaths ascribed to HIV. Among those\nTable 3.

HCV status\nwas not significantly associated with non\u00adliver-related mortality\nafter partial and full covariate adjustment (P . .10).\nAfter generalizing to the US population, the estimated total\npopulation size of 17\u00ad59-year-olds who were anti-HCV positive\nwas 3.22 million. Table 5 shows that within this group there was\nan estimated 33,759 deaths per year from all causes occurring\nthe presence of anti-HCV. Similarly, the estimated total pop-\nulation size of those aged 17\u00ad59 years and chronically infected\nattributable to HCV infection. There was an estimate of 9569\nliver-related deaths per year among those who were chronically\nutable to HCV infection.\nWhen deaths ascribed to HIV were treated as censored,\nall-cause mortality MRRs for anti-HCV were attenuated by\n2%\u00ad4%, but all were still statistically significant. Similarly,\nall-cause mortality MRRs for anti-HCV and HCV-RNA were\nattenuated by 3%\u00ad6%, but all were still statistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing data from a large representative sample of US adults\nup until 2006, we found that all-cause and liver-related mor-\ntality among adults with positive anti-HCV antibodies, and\nthose with chronic HCV infection was higher than those who\nwere anti-HCV negative. Our reported liver-related deaths\nwere 9569 per year, which is consistent with other estimates\nthat ranged between 12,000 annual HCV-related deaths esti-\nstudies [12\u00ad14, 23]. The lower estimates in these latter studies\nmay be explained by (1) their narrow definition of HCV-\nrelated deaths that depend on coexisting CLD or HIV as the\ncause of death; and (2) our more inclusive definition that\nincorporated ICD codes for liver-related malignant neoplasms,\nviral hepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease.\nOur reported deaths from all-causes, however, were much\nhigher than those of previous studies [24\u00ad27]. A study in the\nUnited Kingdom following HCV-infected patients at secondary\nFigure 1. Survival probability by HCV status. Unadjusted survival\nprobabilities from weighted Kaplan-Meier (A), and covariate-adjusted\nexpected survival probabilities from weighted Cox proportional hazards\nmodels (B).\ncare centers found a 3-fold higher mortality than the general\nEnglish population, but no difference in non\u00adliver-related\ndeaths [24, 25]. Another report from Switzerland followed\nHCV-infected patients attending secondary and tertiary care\ncenters for 2 years and found no excess mortality compared with\nthe general Swiss population after adjusting for lifestyle factors,\nHIV, and other diseases [26]. Another study of transfusion\nrecipients showed no increase in all-cause mortality among\nHCV-infected patients compared with uninfected controls [27].\nHowever, it is plausible that our findings may still underestimate\nboththetrueall-causeandliver-relatedmortalityburden.NHANES\nIII participants were informed of their infection after HCV testing\nandhadtheopportunityto(1) seek better medical care and follow-\nup; (2) benefit from improved therapeutic modalities and better\nharm reduction initiatives that were adopted since their enroll-\nment; and (3) appropriately manage other comorbidities such as\nHIV coinfection, all of which may have greatly reduced their\nmortality. Furthermore, NHANES III results are only generaliz-\nable to noninstitutionalized individuals and likely underestimate\nmortality among institutionalized individuals. A study of US\ncorrectional facilities (prisons and jail systems) found that HCV\ninfection among inmates was more than 10-fold higher than in the\ngeneral US population [28].\nMost of the non\u00adliver-related deaths in our study were ascribed\nto HIV, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other causes, al-\nthough they were not significantly associated with HCV. This is\nbiologically plausible given that several studies describe an asso-\nciation between HCV and diabetes [29, 30], and between HCV\nand coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis [31\u00ad34].\nNon\u00adliver-related deaths may also be due to other factors such as\nhigh-risk behaviors, lower socioeconomic status (as reflected by\nsignificantly lower poverty index), barriers to accessing health\ncare, and genetic predisposition. This last point is illustrated in\na study of siblings of HIV/HCV\u00adcoinfected patients that showed\nhigher mortality in this group compared with siblings of either\nHIV monoinfected patients or control subjects [35, 36].\nFew studies have attempted to examine long-term excess\nmortality due to HCV infection, particularly non\u00adliver-related\nmortality [24\u00ad27]. To our knowledge, only one other study in\nthe United States described significant excess liver-related and\nnon\u00adliver-related mortality among anti-HCV positive blood\ndonors compared with a matched sample of anti-HCV negative\ndonors over a mean follow-up period of 7.7 years [37]. Although\nthis study sample is not representative of the general US pop-\nulation, it is more similar to our study in that the participants\nwere not previously aware of their HCV infection, and hence\nHCV-positive individuals without any known liver morbidity\ncould be included. Their inclusion of a large number of\nHCV-positive individuals (.10,000) may explain their signifi-\ncantly higher non\u00adliver-related mortality.\nOur current study had many strengths including a large\nrepresentative sample of US adults with no prior knowledge\nof their HCV status, objectively measured HCV antibody and\nHCV RNA, a long follow-up period, and validation using\nmultiple analysis techniques. Some limitations should be\nnoted when interpreting study results. First, while the\nmortality was prospectively assessed, NHANES III was an\nobservational study; therefore, the potential exists for\nunmeasured or excluded confounding factors. We attempted\nto mitigate this possibility by controlling for many known\nconfounders and performing sensitivity analyses. Second, this\nstudy relied on self-reported data for behaviors and co-\nmorbidities. Third, non\u00adliver-related deaths may have been\noverestimated due to underlying undiagnosed liver disease.\nConversely, unknown antiviral treatment or liver trans-\nplantation may have lowered liver disease mortality, espe-\ncially in the latter years of the study. Lastly, the fully adjusted\nanalyses were limited to those who provided complete data\non high-risk covariates; however, sensitivity analyses showed\nrobust study conclusions.\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that mortality among HCV-\ninfected individuals in the general US population is higher than\npreviously described. Given these findings, and the greater\navailability and affordability of various HCV testing methods,\nperhaps increased testing, earlier therapy, and closer monitoring\nof all HCV-positive individuals, particularly those with\nnon\u00adliver-related morbidities, should be considered by health\ncare providers.\nTable 5.
