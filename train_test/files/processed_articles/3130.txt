The ratios of nonfatal to fatal firearm-\nrelated injuries were 4.0 (children 0-4 years old), 4.4 (chil-\nlet gun). Boys 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 years old had the highest\nrates of injury related to nonpowder firearms, an esti-\npercent of those 15 to 19 years old were assault victims.\nAn estimated 48% of children and adolescents with pow-\nder firearm\u00adrelated gunshot wounds and an estimated\n4% with nonpowder firearm injuries were admitted to\nthe hospital.\nConclusions: Nonfatal injuries related to powder fire-\narms and nonpowder firearms (BB or pellet guns) are an\nimportant source of injury among US children and ado-\nlescents. Ongoing surveillance of nonfatal firearm-\nrelated injury among children and adolescents is needed.\nTHE RATE OF firearm deaths\namong US children far ex-\nceeds that in other industri-\nalized nations.1 Nonfatal\nfirearm injuries outnumber\ninjuryfatalities,however,informationabout\nthem is limited.2-4 While the first compre-\nhensive national estimates of nonfatal fire-\narm-related injuries reported in 1995 pro-\nvided much needed information, they\nprovided limited details about injured chil-\ndren.5 Although firearm-related death rates\nappear to have declined since the mid-\n1990s, they remain a common cause of in-\njury death.6,7 Because detailed national data\nare lacking, we present national estimates,\nbased on data from a representative sample\nof US hospitals, on the number of children\nand adolescents with nonfatal gun-related\ninjuries treated in US emergency depart-\nments (EDs) over a 5-year period.\nRESULTS\nrelated injuries to children and adoles-\ncents between 0 and 19 years old re-\nported through NEISS.

Overall, nonpowder injuries accounted for slightly\nless than half of the cases.\nThe estimated annual rates of powder firearm\u00ad\nrelated gunshot wounds by age, sex, and race are listed\nin Table 2. The ratio of nonfatal to fatal firearm-\nrelated injuries ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 across the age\ngroupings. Rates of nonfatal powder firearm\u00adrelated gun-\nshot wounds by age, sex, and race were calculated: among\nthose younger than 14 years, nonfatal powder firearm\n(white females), 10.8 (Hispanic males), 3.8 (Hispanic fe-\nmales), 23.6 (black males), and 8.0 (black females).

The rates of powder firearm\u00adrelated wounds\nfirst exceeded rates of nonpowder firearm injuries among\nThecircumstancesoftheinjury,byage,forallfirearm-\nrelated injuries are given in Table 3. Among those aged\n14 years and younger, unintentional nonpowder firearm\ninjuries were most common; less than 10% were assaults.\nOf those with powder firearm injuries, an estimated 47%\nwere unintentional and an estimated 41% attributed to as-\nsaults(datanotshowninTable3).Amongadolescentsaged\nries were unintentional and an estimated 66% were as-\nsaults.

Data obtained from these\nhospitals can be weighted to provide unbiased, statis-\ntically valid national estimates of product-related in-\njuries.9 The sampling frame of NEISS was updated in\n91 hospitals. An analysis of weighted data collected\nfrom both NEISS samples during an 8-month overlap\nin 1997 indicated that differences in the national es-\ntimates of firearm-related injuries were less than 1%,\nthus no statistical adjustments were made to adjust for\nthe sampling frame.7 Additional information about the\nNEISS sample is available from us on request.\nGun-related injuries were defined as those cases\nin which a gun was involved in the incident and in-\ncluded powder burns, pistol-whipping, recoil inju-\nries, and injuries sustained during cleaning of the\nweapon, as well as penetrating gunshot wounds. Some\nof the gun-related injuries were from nonpowder fire-\narms (BB and pellet guns).5 Only those who were alive\nat the time of discharge from the ED were counted.\nCases from each hospital were assigned a sample\nweight by NEISS; national injury estimates were pro-\nduced by summing the sample weights. The 95% con-\nfidence intervals of these estimates were calculated\nbased on SEs for firearms reported by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.5,7 National vital\nter for Health Statistics were used to report firearm\ndian year of the sample, were used to calculate age-\nand race-specific injury incidence rates.11 Race-\nspecific rates are reported as white (non-Hispanic) and\nblack; rates for those of Hispanic ethnicity are also\nreported.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

Local data aid in the evaluation of area-specific\nprograms, while national data allow us to recognize na-\ntional trends and discuss national priorities.\nThese data suggest that as gunshot wounds related\nto BB or pellet guns among young teens declined, rates\nof gunshot wounds related to powder firearms in-\ncreased.

Although the actual es-\ntimates of the numbers of nonfatal firearm injuries at\nschool must be interpreted with caution because such low\nestimates are unstable, it is clear that most firearm-\nrelated injuries among school-aged children occur at\nhome. While making schools safe havens from firearm\nviolence is essential, allocation of resources to prevent\nfirearm-related injuries must acknowledge the prepon-\nderance of injuries at home.\nThe distribution of injuries by anatomical area among\nthose younger than 20 years that we report was similar\nto that reported for firearm-related gunshot wounds\namong all ages.5 Nonpowder firearms were associated with\nmore head or neck and upper extremity injuries.\nAn estimated 40% of injuries among both children\ncurred on the weekend. This implies that firearms, or time\nto use firearms, are more available to children and ado-\nlescents during the weekend.\nThe NEISS has been observed to have several limi-\ntations for capturing information on nonfatal firearm-\nrelated injuries. The estimates are imprecise, as indi-\ncated by the wide confidence intervals. This also limits\nanalysis of groups stratified by race or sex. However, we\nobserved that the average annual incidence of firearm in-\nimplying year-to-year stability of the estimates.5\nMuch of the imprecision results from variation in\nthe number of gunshot wound cases treated at NEISS\nsample hospitals, which is affected by the level of care\nprovided in the ED, the location of the hospital, and the\npatient population that is served. Not all firearm-related\ninjuries are brought to medical attention and treated in\nthe ED. While this would not affect the validity of the\nestimates we present for children treated in the ED, it\nwould result in an underestimate of injuries.\nInformation about the circumstances of the injury\nincident was incomplete, as some medical records were\nmissing firearm type, location of the injury, and the victim-\nshooter relationship. Therefore, we do not report the spe-\ncific type of powder firearm (handgun or long gun). We\nreport location of injury based on the available data. De-\nspite incomplete data, it is useful to review the available\ninformation about injury circumstances, as any detail\nabout the circumstances of injury among children is im-\nportant for a better understanding of these injuries.\nThere are many social and cultural barriers to pro-\ntecting children from firearms. It is clear that many chil-\nWhat This Study Adds\nInformation about the rates of nonfatal firearm-related\ninjury among children and adolescents is limited.
