To date,\nno details regarding the amino acid metab-\nolism in short SGA children with and with-\nout GH therapy have been reported.\nThe production of nitric oxide (NO) and\nasymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is\nstrongly linked to amino acids such as\narginine and citrulline (Figure 1). NO has\nmany biological functions, including the\nmaintenance of vascular tone, neurotrans-\nmitter function, and mediation of cellular\ndefense.8 ADMA competes with arginine for\nNO synthase and inhibits NO production; it\nalso promotes superoxide production and\nenhances oxidative stress.9 ADMA was\nrecently employed as a surrogate risk\nmarker for cardiovascular disease, renal\ndisease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\nand other conditions in both adults and\nIn the present study, we investigated the\nblood levels of amino acids, ADMA, and\nNOx13,14 and the impact of GH therapy for\n12 months in short SGA children.\nPatients and Methods\nStudy design and patients\nThis age-matched case-control study was\napproved by the institutional review boards\nof Takarazuka City Hospital (reference\nnumber: 198), Osaka City General\nKobe University Graduate School of\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom the parents of the children prior to\nstudy enrollment.\nTwenty-four short SGA children aged 3\nto 6 years who visited Takarazuka City\nHospital and Osaka City General Hospital\nweight and height standard deviation (SD)\nscores were determined using the standard\ncurve according to gestational age for the\nJapanese population.15\nAt 3 to 6 years of age, the patients had\nvisited hospitals in the vicinity of their\nhomes because of parental concern\nregarding the child's short stature. They\nwere then referred to our hospital for\nthorough examinations. All patients\nshowed normal peak plasma GH concentra-\ntions (>6 ng/mL on arginine, clonidine, and\ninsulin tests). None of the enrolled patients\nhad experienced serious episodes of condi-\ntions such as asphyxia, respiratory distress,\nor severe infection during the newborn or\ninfancy period with the exception of two\npatients who had developed mild hypogly-\ncemia that was resolved by intravenous\nglucose administration a few days after\nbirth. The patients showed normal intellec-\ntual development with the exception of one\npatient who had been diagnosed with a mild\nlearning disability.\nAfter receiving a detailed explanation of\nGH therapy, the parents of 12 children\nrequested to initiate GH therapy as soon\nas possible (Group A), and parents of the\nremaining 12 children requested to initiate\nGH therapy a few years later (Group B).\nChildren in Group A received a subcutane-\nous injection of GH once daily at a dose of\nmonths. For both groups, the following\ndata were monitored for 12 months:\nheight, weight, and various biochemical\nparameters (amino acid profiles, the\nADMA and NOx concentrations, and par-\nameters linked to citrulline\u00adarginine recy-\ncling, such as arginine) (Figure 1). Blood\ninsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was\nalso monitored. Additionally, to evaluate\nthe oxidative stress status that influences NO\nand ADMA production, the plasma con-\ncentrations of the antioxidants b-carotene\nand a-tocophenol were examined.8,9\nA group of 25 age-matched healthy vol-\n6 years) was enrolled at the Kobe Children's\nPrimary Emergency Medical Center to\nFigure 1.

The strong effect of GH in\nincreasing height has been shown in many\npatients. In addition, the metabolic effects of\nGH on lipids and carbohydrates have been\npreviously reported.1,4\u00ad6 Specifically, GH\nlowers the low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol concentration, and a higher dose of\nGH decreases insulin sensitivity, predispos-\ning patients to diabetes mellitus.1,4\u00ad6\nNevertheless, the impact of GH on amino\nacid metabolism has been scarcely exam-\nined.20\u00ad25 Furthermore, few data exist on\namino acid metabolism in short SGA\nchildren.\nThe results of the present study also\nsuggest that basal ADMA production is\npromoted in short SGA children and that in\ncontrast to ADMA, NO production is sup-\npressed. Almost all cells and tissues produce\nADMA as a product of protein degradation.\nADMA is formed from arginine residues in\nproteins and competes with arginine for\neach of the three isoforms of NO synthase\n(NOS) (Figure 1).9 ADMA is mainly meta-\nbolized into citrulline and dimethylamine by\nthe liver, kidney, and endothelium via\ndimethylarginine dimethylaminohydro-\nNOx concentration showed a significant\nnegative correlation with the serum\nADMA concentration in short SGA chil-\ndren without GH treatment in contrast to\nnormal children, who exhibited a significant\npositive correlation. Accordingly, increased\nADMA production is likely to suppress NO\nproduction in short SGA children. The\nmechanistic explanation for the increase in\nADMA remains unknown. Oxidative\nstress stimulates ADMA production by\nsuppressing dimethylarginine dimethylami-\nnohydrolase activity and promoting protein\nThe oxidative stress status in short SGA\nchildren was not fully evaluated in the\npresent study. However, the blood concen-\ntration of the antioxidants b-carotene and a-\ntocophenol were decreased in the short SGA\nchildren and restored by GH treatment\n(Table 4). These results suggest that\nenhanced oxidative stress contributes to\nsuppression of NO production in short\nSGA children.\nThe influence of GH on the NOS-ADMA\npathway has been rarely studied. Only a few\nreports have described ADMA and NO\nAccording to these earlier reports,20\u00ad23 GH\nis thought to exhibit generally favorable\neffects on the NOS-ADMA pathway in\nGH deficiency, possibly leading to reduced\nrisk of cardiovascular events. Most reports\nhave described decreased blood ADMA\nconcentrations in GH-deficient adults and\nincreased basal ADMA concentrations in\nprepubertal to pubertal children undergoing\n\u00a8 nder et al.25 reported\ndecreased ADMA in prepubertal to pubertal\nGH-deficient children, whose basal ADMA\nconcentrations were comparable with those\nof the age-matched controls, by GH therapy.\nThe effect of GH on ADMA production may\ndiffer according to age. The results of the\npresent study suggest that suppressed NO\nproduction in short SGA children is, at least\nin part, restored by GH therapy because the\nserum NOx concentration (reflecting NO\nproduction) was increased at dosages of\nIn contrast, the serum ADMA concentra-\ntion decreased under the former dosage but\nincreased under the latter dosage. In general,\nour results are largely consistent with those\nThe results of the present study also\nshowed that the concentrations of the\namino acids involved in the urea cycle and\ncitrulline\u00adarginine recycling changed with\nGH treatment.13,14 Specifically, the basal\nserum arginine concentration in the short\nSGAchildrendecreasedandwasrestoredafter\nthe initiation of GH treatment; the arginine-\nto-ornithine ratio significantly increased by\nGH therapy, and in contrast to arginine,\nincreased levels of glutamine (a major source\nof ammonia) decreased with GH therapy.\nBased on these data, we speculate that urea\ncyclefunctionispromotedbyGHtreatmentto\nsome degree, resulting in increased arginine\nproduction (Figure 1). Considering that argin-\nine is a substrate for NO, the increase of\narginine may contribute to the increased NO\nproduction, at least in part.\nIGF-1 increases NOS activity by inter-\nacting with a tyrosine kinase membrane\nreceptor linked to insulin receptor sub-\nstrate.31,32 This receptor complex activates\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which acti-\nvates the serine/threonine kinase Akt signal-\ning pathway, promoting NOS activity and\nNO production.29,30 From this context, we\ninfer that the considerably increased IGF-1\nconcentration by GH is attributable to the\nrestoration of NO production.\nShort SGA children exhibit a decrease in\nmuscle volume and an increase in visceral fat\nmass volume.33\u00ad35 The accumulation of vis-\nceral fat is sometimes considerable in\naffected patients.33,34 GH treatment has\nbeen shown to substantially increase\nmuscle mass and decrease adipose\ntissue.1,2,4 Furthermore, a recent study\ndemonstrated that GH therapy also reduces\nthe liver fat content in adults with GH\ndeficiency.36 Such changes in body compos-\nition by GH therapy may also contribute to\nthe favorable changes in the NOS-ADMA\npathway as well as endothelial and liver\nfunction, including urea cycle function.\nADMA not only inhibits NOx activity\nbut may also enhance oxidative stress,\npredisposing to insulin resistance and car-\ndiovascular disease.9,37 In contrast, NO\nexerts multifarious biological functions\nsuch as vasodilation, anti-inflammation,\napoptosis, and regulation of neurological\nsystems.8 In this context, more attention\nshould be paid to ADMA and NO produc-\ntion before and after GH therapy.\nThe main limitations of this study are that\nthe number of enrolled short SGA children\nwas relatively small, the production of intra-\ncellular ADMA and NO was not examined,\nand we were unable to determine the daily\nintake of arginine, glutamine, and other\namino acids that might have influenced the\nresults. Throughout this study, however, we\nevaluated the patients' appetite and dietary\npattern by interviewing their mothers, and\nthese parameters seemed almost unchanged.\nDespite these limitations, the present study\nprovides evidence that GH treatment influ-\nences ADMA and NO production as well as\nrelevant amino acid concentrations in short\nSGA children. Recent meta-analyses have\nrevealed that the onset of cardiovascular\ndisease and stroke are associated with high\nADMA concentrations, suggesting that\nADMA is an independent risk factor for\nsuch diseases.38,39 More extensive and long-\nstanding studies are required to gain better\nknowledge regarding the metabolic effects\nand resultant clinical benefits of GH treat-\nment in short SGA children.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for\nYoung Scientists and Scientific Research of JSPS\nReferences\n1.
