Overall survival was evaluated\nusing the Kaplan\u00adMeier method.\nResults: Serum miR-9 was significantly upregulated in patients with osteosarcoma (n \u00bc 118)\ncompared with healthy control subjects (n \u00bc 60); its upregulation was significantly associated with\nadvanced tumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis stage, larger tumour size and presence of distant metastasis.\nOverall survival duration was significantly shorter in patients with relatively high miR-9\nconcentrations compared with those with relatively low miR-9 concentrations.\nConclusions: Serum miR-9 concentrations are significantly increased in patients with osteosar-\ncoma compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-9 is associated with tumour stage, size\nand metastasis. Serum miR-9 quantification may represent a useful diagnostic and prognostic\nmarker of osteosarcoma.\n",

The aim of this\nstudy, therefore, was to analyse the associ-\nation between serum miR-9 concentrations\nand clinicopathological features and prog-\nnosis, in patients with osteosarcoma.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study retrospectively enrolled patients\nwith primary osteosarcoma who were surgi-\ncally treated in the Department of Ortho-\npaedics, China\u00adJapan Union Hospital of\nJilin University, Changchun, China,\nTumours were classified according to the 6th\nedition of the tumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis\n(TNM) classification of the International\nUnion Against Cancer (UICC).17 Clinico-\npathological features were recorded at the\ntime of serum sampling. Inclusion criteria\nwere no metastasis at presentation and no\nhistory of previous treatment. Patients were\nexcluded if they had a previous or secondary\nmalignancy.\nHealthy control subjects were recruited\nfrom individuals with no previous cancer\ndiagnosis who were undergoing routine\nhealth checks at the Physical Health\nExamination Centre, China\u00adJapan Union\nHospital of Jilin University.\nThe study was approved by the Research\nEthics Committee of China\u00adJapan Union\nHospital of Jilin University and all partici-\npants provided written informed consent\nprior to enrolment.\nQuantitative RT\u00adPCR\nPeripheral venous blood (10 ml) was taken\nfrom all study participants using standard\nmethods, after an overnight fast. Blood was\nkept at room temperature for 60 min then\nSerum was immediately separated, frozen\nand stored at \u00c080C until analysis.\nTotal RNA was extracted from 400 ml\nserum (miRNeasy Mini Kit; QIAGEN,\nHilden, Germany) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions, and miR-9 was quan-\ntified by real-time quantitative reverse\ntranscription\u00adpolymerase chain reaction\n(RT\u00adPCR) using the TaqMan\u00d5 miRNA\nassay system (Applied Biosystems, Foster\nCity, CA, USA). RNA was reverse tran-\nscribed using the Universal cDNA synthesis\nkit (Exiqon; Woburn, MA, USA) according\nto the manufacturer's instructions. Primer\nsequences were 50-UCUUUGGUUAUCU\n(for RNA U6, internal control; both\nInvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR\nreaction mix comprised 4 ml cDNA, 10 ml\nLightCycler\u00d5 480 ProbesMaster (Roche\nDiagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 4 ml\nwater and 2 ml gene-specific TaqMan\u00d5\nprimer/probe mix, in a final volume of\n20 ml. Cycling conditions were an initial\ndenaturation step at 95C for 5 min, fol-\nfor 1 min, then a final elongation step\nat 72C for 5 min. PCR was performed\non a LightCycler\u00d5 480 System II (Roche\nDiagnostics). The concentration of miR-9\nrelative to RNA U6 was calculated accord-\ning to the equation 2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1CT, where\nwere examined in triplicate.\nFollow-up\nFor analysis of survival time, the date of\nsurgery was used as the beginning of the\nfollow-up period. Patients who died from\nother disease or from unexpected events\nwere excluded from the study. Follow-up\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD.\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing Student's t-test or Pearson's 2-test,\nas appropriate. Patients were stratified into\nhigh or low miR-9 groups relative to the\nmedian miR-9 concentration. The associ-\nation between miR-9 serum concentrations\nand overall survival was evaluated using\nKaplan\u00adMeier analysis. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using GraphPad Prism ver-\nsion 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,\nCA, USA) and SPSS\u00d5 version 19.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. All\ntests were two-tailed, and P-values < 0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 118 patients with osteo-\ncontrol subjects (28 male/32 female; mean\nThere were no significant between-group\ndifferences in age or sex. Clinicopathological\nfeatures of the patient group are summar-\nized in Table 1. The median duration of\nmonths). During the follow-up period, 38\npatients (32.2%) died of disease.

MiR-9\nwas significantly upregulated in patients\nwith advanced clinical stage (IIB\u00adIII vs I\u00ad\nIIA), large tumour diameter (!8 cm\nvs < 8 cm) and distant metastasis (vs no\ndistant metastasis) (P < 0.01 for each com-\nparison). There was no significant associ-\nation between miR-9 concentration and age,\nsex or tumour location.\nKaplan\u00adMeier analysis (Figure 1) found\nthat patients with relatively high miR-9\nconcentrations (expression) had signifi-\ncantly shorter survival times than those\nwith relatively low miR-9 concentrations\nDiscussion\nSerum miR-9 concentrations were increased\nin patients with osteosarcoma compared\nwith healthy control subjects in the present\nstudy. In addition, miR-9 concentrations\nwere significantly associated with TNM\nstage, tumour diameter and metastasis, and\npatients with relatively high serum miR-9\nconcentrations had a significantly poorer\noutcome than those with relatively low\nconcentrations. Taken together, these data\nsuggest that miR-9 could be a valuable\nprognostic indicator for osteosarcoma.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to\ninvestigate the clinical significance of miR-9\nin a large number of patients with\nosteosarcoma.\nMicroRNA-9 was identified as a crucial\nregulator of nervous-system development,\nphysiology and pathology in organisms\nincluding zebra fish, Drosophila and mam-\nassociated with the development and pro-\ngression of cancers,22\u00ad25 but the expression\npatterns and role of miR-9 are diverse.

MiR-9 concentrations were\nhigher in patients with osteosarcoma than\nnormal controls in the present study, and\nupregulation of miR-9 was associated with\ntumour aggressiveness and metastasis. Our\ndata support the notion that miR-9 plays\ndifferent roles in different tumours.\nThe current finding that miR-9 was upre-\ngulated in patients with osteosarcoma com-\npared with healthy controls is consistent with\nothers who found that miR-9 was highly\nexpressed in osteosarcoma clinical samples\nand inversely correlated with the predicted\ntarget gene, transforming growth factor b\nreceptor II (TGFBR2).29 The molecular\nmechanisms underlying miR-9 and the regu-\nlation of osteosarcoma carcinogenesis\nremain unclear and require further study.\nIn conclusion, the present study found\nthat serum miR-9 levels are significantly\nincreased in patients with osteosarcoma\ncompared with healthy controls, and that\nthe upregulation of miR-9 is associated with\ntumour stage, size and metastasis. Serum\nmiR-9 may represent a useful diagnostic and\nprognostic marker of osteosarcoma.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial\nsupport provided by The Development of\nScience and Technology Plan Projects of Jilin\nReferences\n1.
