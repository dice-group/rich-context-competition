    "abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the most contentious urban education policy issues in the United States today is the expansion of charter schools\nand its repercussions. Does the expansion of charter schools affect the racial and socioeconomic composition of traditional\npublic schools in the United States? This study provides empirical evidence on this question by relying on a panel design\nthat uses school-level data from two states that have experimented with charter schools for more than 15 years: Ohio\nand Texas. Using county-level, spatial, and enrollment-based measures of charter exposure, the changes from pre- to post-\ncharter-legislation stages in the student compositions of public schools that do and do not face competition from charters\nare examined. The results suggest that charter school presence contributes to aggregate-level changes in the share of non-\nHispanic White and free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools in both states in different ways.\n",

Market-based theories of school\nchoice favoring competition in education argue that increased\nparental choice will enhance the efficiency of not only choice\nschools but also nonchoice schools by stimulating improve-\nment in the entire system (Chubb & Moe, 1990; Hoxby,\n2000). Critics of choice policies, however, are concerned\nabout the unintended consequences of adopting market-\nbased policies in education. One persistent concern is the\npotential increase in racial and socioeconomic segregation in\npublic schools (Frankenberg, Siegel-Hawley, & Wang, 2011;\n1995). Charter schools have had strong bipartisan support for\nmore than 15 years now from both sides of the aisle in\nCongress. Race to the Top program that began in 2009\nrequires states to prepare plans that are in line with the edu-\ncation-reform criteria, which include the growth of charter\nschools. As we move into the new phase of charter school\ngrowth, it is important to keep tracking the improvements\nand changes in nonchoice schools, as well as choice schools,\nand whether and the degree to which the improvements are\naccompanied by stratification along race or socioeconomic\nstatus.\nMost states have adopted charter school legislation and\nsupport the school founders to increase the quality and effi-\nciency of schooling not only in the charter schools them-\nselves but also in the entire public education system. Many\neducational reformers find competition indispensable for\npublic schools improvement (Lubienski, 2006). An early\nreport by U.S. Department of Education showed that the\ncharter school authorizers interviewed cited creating compe-\ntition in the public school system as the primary reason they\nawarded charters (Policy and Program Studies Services\n[PPSS], 2004). Those who support charters see these alterna-\ntive schools as a promising policy option to lift urban educa-\ntion. Scholars have argued that charter schools might reduce\nexisting stratification, particularly in locations where tradi-\ntional public schools are highly segregated, by either reduc-\ning middle-class parents' willingness to move to the suburbs\nor to send their children to private schools or by empowering\ndisadvantaged parents to choose schools without residential\nment has been enjoying wide support from politicians from\nboth sides of the partisan line, a large group of educators, and\nparents, and consequently the number of charter schools has\ngrown rapidly.

Both states had\nusing two-period school-level panel data and several county-\nlevel, spatial, and enrollment-based measures of charter\nexposure, this study explores the systemic effects of charter\nschools on student distributions by addressing the following\nquestions: (a) Does the presence of charter schools contrib-\nute to the aggregate changes in the racial and socioeconomic\ndistributions of students in traditional public schools? (b)\nHow do the sizes and scopes of changes vary according to\ndifferent measures of exposure?\nBackground\nWhile the average changes in the composition of students\nserved by public schools cannot capture the full extent of\nsegregation or integration in schools, this study focuses on\ncomposition of student body as a first step in beginning to\nunderstand whether the charter school movement contributes\nto how student groups are sorted across schools. Empirical\nstudies focusing on racial patterns of enrollment in public\nschools show that most public schools in the United States\nare already highly segregated and that demographics of the\npublic school system in many areas represent an unbalanced\ndistribution of students by race and socioeconomic status\nEvidence from other countries, which have experienced\nwide-ranging school choice reforms, shows that the schools\nhave become significantly more polarized along ethnic and\nsocioeconomic lines than before in some instances (Ladd &\nFiske, 2001) and indicates that unfettered choice could\npotentially increase stratification (Schneider, Elacqua, &\nBuckley, 2006). The conclusions from research on charter\nschools and their effects on student distributions are mixed.\nThe following two sections focus on the theoretical argu-\nments and the empirical studies, respectively.\nTheoretical Arguments\nScholars suggest a variety of reasons why student distribu-\ntions might change (Fiske & Ladd, 2000; Frankenberg et al.,\nHolme, Lopez, & Cooper, 2000). First is the influence of\nseveral aspects of parental demand, which is a key element in\nthe success of any school choice policy. Parents may choose\nschools not only for their academic reputation but also for a\nvariety of other reasons, including peer group preferences\nand geographical proximity. If parents value certain peer\ngroup characteristics and sort their children into schools\nalong racial and class lines, existing stratification may\ndeepen (Smith & Meier, 1995). Although most surveys of\nparents show that all parents value academic quality and that\nfew refer to the composition of the student bodies in schools,\nstudies based on the actual behavior of parents found that\nparental decisions do appear to be influenced by factors such\naspect regarding parental demand is the ability of parents to\nmake well-informed decisions. Research on other forms of\npublic school choice has clearly demonstrated that there are\nsignificant information disparities between different groups\nof parents and that the average parent does not have very\naccurate information about the conditions in schools\n(Schneider, Teske, & Marschall, 2000; Schneider, Teske,\nSecond, despite the racial/ethnic balance enrollment\nguidelines some states set for their charter schools\n(Frankenberg & Lee, 2003a), schools can influence their\nstudent distributions through a variety of mechanisms\n(Wamba & Ascher, 2003), such as recruitment and admis-\nsion policies, marketing mechanisms, and transportation to\nthe school. Wamba and Ascher (2003) described several\nexamples from different states, such as schools tailored to\nspecific populations by adopting specific curriculum con-\ntent to cater to minority parents or private to charter conver-\nsion schools, which take advantage of the new laws to gain\naccess to government funds without necessarily changing\nenrollment. Some of these strategies may lead to concentra-\ntions of certain types of students. In addition, the viability\nof a charter school depends on its financial resources and\nthus its capacity to attract students. When students transfer\nfrom public schools to charter schools, the funding follows\nthe student.2 Critics worry that the new schools will drain\nthe already limited funding of traditional schools. They also\nworry that financial and academic pressures may compel\nschools to avoid high-cost students (Miron & Nelson, 2002)\nor that recruitment and admission policies or marketing\nmechanisms may affect the profile of applicants (Wamba &\nportation of charter students is required or left as a parental\nresponsibility may seriously affect the pool of applicants\n(Wells et al., 2000). Keeping these concerns in mind,\nresearchers warn that existing stratification and segregation\nmay deepen as choice increases if the necessary institu-\ntional arrangements and regulations, such as well-designed\nand enforced equity provisions, are not created (Cobb &\nIn contrast, charter school supporters value and wel-\ncome the competition created by charter schools and per-\nceive these schools as part of the solution to the persistent\nsegregation and stratification problems. While charter\nschools are still public schools, policy allows them to be\nfree of bureaucratic constraints that affect other public\nschools and to develop creative, innovative curricula or to\nuse new teaching methods in hopes of attracting parents\nand students and becoming \"public education's `R&D'\narm.\"3 Charter schools are presented as laboratories that\ncan test and find better approaches to education that can\ntransform the larger public education system (U.S.\nDepartment of Education, 2004). Besides creating oppor-\ntunities for innovation and incentives for other public\nschools, as charter schools do not use established atten-\ndance zones, they may weaken racial isolation by expand-\ning choice to families in poor neighborhood schools\ncal arguments outlined above suggest primarily three ways\nfor charter schools to induce change in public schools.\nFirst, flexible and innovative charter schools may act as\nincubators of new ideas and approaches, which traditional\npublic schools can adopt. Second, if losing students has\ndirect financial effects, public schools have an extra incen-\ntive to adopt better programs and increase performance.\nThird, public schools may also change if charter schools\ninfluence the student composition of public schools by\nabsorbing more disadvantaged or problematic students or\nby attracting the best and brightest students.\nEmpirical Findings\nThe empirical research on effects of competition from char-\nter schools is growing (Carnoy, Jacobsen, Mishel, &\nearlier research regarding this issue is cross-sectional com-\nparisons of whom the schools are serving (see, for example,\nFinn, Manno, & Vanourek, 2000; Frankenberg & Lee,\nCharter Schools sponsored by the U.S. Department of\nEducation concludes that the proportion of White students\nin charter and public schools is about the same, providing\nno evidence of increased segregation (Nelson et al., 2000).\nDuring the same period, in the Charter Schools and Race\nstudy sponsored by the Harvard Civil Rights Project,\nposition and segregation of charter schools by state and\nconcluded that charter schools are largely more segregated\nthan public schools.\nOther studies, primarily focusing on academic perfor-\nmance, examined whether charter schools absorb more\nadvantaged students from public schools and worsen\nschool systems for troubled students, which is sometimes\nreferred to as the academic skimming problem. Hoxby\n(2003) found that on average students with lower grades\ntransferred to charter schools in Chicago, suggesting no\nskimming on an academic basis. Hanushek, Kain, and\nRivkin (2002) in Texas; Booker, Zimmer, and Buddin\n(2005) in California and Texas; and Bifulco and Ladd\nenabled them to track the moves of students from tradi-\ntional public schools to charter schools or back over time.\nAll three studies found that the charters might lead to addi-\ntional racial and ethnic concentrations, primarily because\nof black charter school students selecting into more racially\nisolated schools. More recent studies examining data from\nlar conclusions of charter school intensifying the isolation\nof disadvantaged or minority students in especially some\nurban schools and for some grade levels more than others.\nPetrilli (2009) found promising effects toward integration\nin D.C. schools that use specific and carefully designed\ndiversity policies such as a lottery system to recruit student\nthat takes into account the already segregated neighbor-\nhood patterns.\nThree studies used variations of the difference-in-\ndifferences estimates, also utilized in this article, to study\nthe effects of charter schools on student composition of\npublic schools. The basic idea behind the difference-in-\ndifferences estimator is to model the treatment effect by\nestimating the difference between outcome measures at two\ntime points for the treated and the control observations and\nthen comparing the difference between the groups (Buckley\nstudy of the effects of charter schools on the achievement\nof public school students in Arizona and Michigan, defined\ntreatment school districts as those where charter schools\naccount for more than 6% of district enrollment, based on\naverage annual enrollment change in a Michigan school\nthe Michigan and Arizona public schools raised achieve-\nment in the face of competition from charter schools and\nthat the increased achievement was not a result of cream-\nskimming of students. Dee and Fu (2004) compared\nchanges in the student-teacher ratio and racial segregation\nin Arizona, which introduced charter schools, and New\nMexico, which did not. They found that charter schools\ndrew White non-Hispanic students from traditional public\nschools and caused a reduction of resources in Arizona. In\na district-level analysis, Ross (2005) estimated the effects\nof charter school presence on the segregation of traditional\npublic schools within districts in Michigan. The analysis\nmeasured charter presence first with dichotomous variables\nindicating existence of a single- or multiple-charter schools\nwithin a district then with dichotomous variables indicating\nthat the charter schools account for below or above 7% of\ndistrict enrollment (the median enrollment rate in Michigan\nin 1999). The results show that several forms of public\nschool segregation have been exacerbated in Michigan dis-\ntricts with high levels of charter school enrollment.\n4 SAGE Open\nData and Method\nRegression models relying on the difference-in-differences\nestimation method are used to model the charter school\nexposure effect by estimating the difference between out-\ncome measures at two time points for charter-exposed\nschools and the control schools and then comparing the dif-\nference between the groups. Both states had no charter\nschools. Using the 2009 data, schools are categorized as\nthose that face competition and those that do not, and then\nthe differences in the outcome measure between these groups\nof schools are compared--First, the differences between the\nschools are compared in 2009, and then the same difference\nbetween the same schools are compared in 1995 to control\nfor potential disparities between the two before charter\nschools existed. Then, the difference between the differences\nis compared, hence the name difference-in-differences.\nThe data used in this study come from multiple sources.\nThe main school-level data are drawn from the National\nCenter of Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core Data\nate two-period panel data of traditional public schools in\nTexas and Ohio. The CCD is a comprehensive, annual,\nnational statistical database on all public elementary and sec-\nondary schools in the United States. The school-level data\ninclude information on the racial and ethnic composition of\nstudents and on the number of students on free or reduced-\nprice lunches. The first period represents the last year before\nany charter schools were established and the second period\nincludes the data from the recent post-charter-legislation\nenvironment that can be matched with current county-level\ndata from the U.S. Census Bureau. Table 1 shows the number\nof charter and traditional public schools and students in these\nstates based on U.S. Department of Education data. Both\nschool year, 323 charter schools were operational in Ohio\nand 536 in Texas. A higher percentage of public schools are\ncharter schools in both states in comparison with national\naverages. About 4.7% of public schools are charter schools\nin the nation, compared with 8.5% of Ohio schools and 6.2%\nof Texas schools.\nAfter data on all schools from each state for pre- and\npostlegislation periods were extracted from the CCD,\ncharter, special, vocational, and other alternative schools\nwere removed.4 Then, the schools that were not operational\nfor both periods were taken out, as they cannot be used for\npanel estimates. This reduced the sample size to 2,884\nschools operational in both periods in Ohio and 5,456 tradi-\ntional public schools operational in both periods in Texas.\nData on charter schools were used to create a series of inde-\npendent variables, which are described in detail in the fol-\nlowing section.\nDependent Variables\nThe two main dependent variables for this analysis are the\npercentage of students who are non-Hispanic White and the\npercentage of students who are eligible for free or reduced-\nprice lunches. The first outcome variable was used to track\nthe changes in the concentrations of minority and non-His-\npanic White students. Proportion of non-Hispanic White stu-\ndents is a commonly used and reported education indicator,\nalso featured in the Department of Education's publications\nas an important indicator of the condition of education in the\nUnited States. The second outcome variable provides a proxy\nmeasure of low-income family status. Previous research has\nfound an association between higher percentages of students\nwho are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches and lower\naverage academic scores in schools.\nCompetition Measures\nTo categorize schools into those that are heavily exposed to\ncharters and those that are not, three criteria (specifications)\nhave been used. First, traditional public schools that have\none or more charter schools in the same county are compared\nwith other schools that do not have any charter schools in the\nsame county. Second, the traditional public schools that have\none or more charter schools within a 5-mile radius is com-\npared with other schools that do not have charter schools\nnearby. Third, the percentage of public school students that\nare enrolled in charter schools in each county for school year\n2009 is calculated. Traditional public schools that operate in\ncounties with above-median charter school enrollment were\ncompared with other traditional schools located in counties\nwith less than median charter enrollment.5 Special and voca-\ntional charter schools were also removed similar to the main\nTable 1. Number and Percentage of Public Schools by School Type and State, School Year 2009-2010.\nOhio Texas United States\n Public Charter Public Charter Public Charter\npublic school data set. This means that the analyses do not\ninclude those charters opened to serve students with specific\ndisabilities exclusively.6\nFollowing the literature that points out the importance of\nlocation in school choice and the studies focusing on compe-\ntition effects, the first two of these measures are spatial in\nnature. Location is an important determinant of charter school\nselection by parents, especially for minority and low-income\nhouseholds, because although charter schools are open to stu-\ndents from outside the school district, the transportation costs\nof switching to distant schools would be higher for them\n(Henig & MacDonald, 2002; Kleitz, Weiher, Tedin, &\nMatland, 2000). In creating the groupings, public schools that\nhave at least one, five, or more, or nine or more charter\nschools in the same county are compared with other public\nschools. As all these three specifications produced similar\nresults, comparisons are reported using the first measure.\nBecause counties vary widely in size, the number of schools\nper county may not reflect the actual competitive pressure\nsome schools face. Geographic variables based on spatial\nproximity may provide a better measure to group schools.\nTherefore, a spatial equation was used to convert latitude and\nlongitude differences between traditional public and charter\nschools into actual distances in miles on the surface of the\nearth.7 Then, these distances were used to count the number\nof charter schools within 5 and within 10 miles of each tradi-\ntional public school. These two spatial specifications pro-\nduced similar results. Thus, the second measure on which the\nschools are grouped and the results are reported is whether the\ntraditional public school has at least one charter school within\na 5-mile radius. The third charter exposure measure was\nbased on enrollment. The share of public school population\nenrolled in charter schools still represents a minor portion of\nthe total enrollments in these states, so schools that are located\nin counties with heavy charter attendance may feel more\ncompetitive pressures to maintain their student populations.\nControl Variables\nMany social and demographic characteristics are likely to\ninfluence the student composition of schools, such as the\nracial composition of the local population and levels of pov-\nerty. For example, if there is a general increase in the poverty\nlevels of the school-aged population in the area over the time\nperiod of this study, we would expect to see an increase in the\nshare of free-lunch-eligible students in the schools. Charter\nschools are not confined to students living in the district\nwhere the school is located; in fact, the point of choice\nschools is to enable families to choose schools outside of the\ntraditional school district if they want to. Therefore, to con-\ntrol for other factors that may cause changes in the dependent\nlevel economic and demographic indicators. These controls\nshow the changes between the pre- and postlegislation years\nin the percentage of 5- to 17-year olds in poverty, the\npercentage of the 5- to 19-year-old county population who\nare White non-Hispanics, logarithmic transformation of total\ncounty population, and the real median household income.\nThe data for these control variables come from Small Area\nIncome and Poverty Estimates of the U.S. Census Bureau\n(2010).8 Charter schools are alternatives to not just tradi-\ntional public schools but also to private schools. Changes in\nthe size of the private school population may also affect out-\ncome measures; therefore, the proportion of private school\nenrollment per county was also included as a control.9 To\ncalculate what percentage of students attends private schools\nwithin a county, the Private School Survey (PSS) data from\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, the changes in the mean values for the two outcome\nmeasures for the groups of schools were investigated. To test\nwhether the observed effects were driven by changes across\ncounties during that period, a school fixed effects regression\nmodel, which allowed inclusion of controls for other possi-\nble factors for the change, was used. The model takes on the\nit it\n= + + + \u00d7 +\n    \nX ( ) ,\nwhere Y\nit\nis the dependent variable for school i in year t, X\nis a vector of control variables, T is a year dummy coded 1\ncompetition measure. The parameter of interest is on the\ninteraction term (T \u00d7 C). The coefficient \nmeasures the\nchanges unique to schools that face competition after the\nintroduction of charter schools.\nEndogeneity is a common problem in this type of educa-\ntional policy and program evaluations that use observational\ndata. The main problem stems from the fact that the units of\nobservation may not be randomly assigned to participate in\nthe policy or program in question. In the context of this study,\nit is possible that the observed effects of charter school pres-\nence on the proportion of non-Hispanic White and free-\nlunch-eligible students in the nearby traditional public\nschools actually represents preexisting trends that are also\ndriving the location of the charter schools. Although the dif-\nference-in-differences estimation method provides a simple\nyet powerful technique for estimating treatment effects with\nobservational data (Buckley & Shang, 2003), it is impossible\nto control for everything completely, especially in an open\npolicy area such as school choice. In using this estimation\ntechnique, the models compare the differences between\ngroups of schools as well as the differences of pre- and post-\ncharter-legislation measures so that time-invariant factors\nthat may have affected the student composition and charter\nschool location were differenced out.\nPrevious research utilizing variants of the estimator has\ngenerally used observations from some other control state\n6 SAGE Open\nthat did not experience the policy intervention, for exam-\nple, a neighboring state that did not have charter schools.\nThe selection of the control state is very important and\noften turns out to be grounds for critique, as the model is\nbased on the assumption that the contemporaneous changes\nin the control state reflect the similar unobserved and time-\nvarying determinants of the treatment state. As there are\nmany variations in the charter laws and educational histo-\nries, as well as regional demographic trends in different\nstates, in this article, multiple competition criteria within\nthe same state were used to assign schools to treatment and\ncontrol groups. This ensured that the treatment and the\ncontrol schools are affected similarly by other unmeasured\nfactors such as other statewide policies. It should be noted\nthat in states with charter laws, all schools, including those\nthat do not have any charters in their county, can be affected\nby the charter schools. They may not be directly exposed\nto the risk of losing students who transfer to charters close\nby, but the possibility of new charter schools opening in\nthe area may be enough to stir change. In other words,\nthere is no pure control group. If this is true, then the\nresults from these analyses will underestimate the true\ncharter school effect.\nResults\nTable 2 shows the racial composition and the percentage of\nstudents eligible for free lunches in traditional and charter\npublic schools in the two states based on the sample in com-\nparison with national figures. The charter laws vary from\nstate to state, reflecting the varying educational histories and\nthe power of different political and civil groups supporting or\nopposing charter schools. Some of the provisions in state\nlaws may have direct implications for charter schools'impact\non the public education system. In Ohio, racial/ethnic bal-\nance provisions simply indicate that the racial and ethnic bal-\nance of the schools should not differ from the composition in\nthe community, whereas Texas charter law contains no spe-\ncific discrimination provisions (Frankenberg & Lee, 2003a;\nU.S. Charter Schools Website, 2006). Despite the racial and\nethnic balance guidelines, both states have racially imbal-\nanced enrollments. In both states, the percentage of black\nstudents in charter schools is exceptionally higher than that\nlic charter school students are non-Hispanic White (com-\npublic school students nationwide). Charter schools also\nserve slightly higher proportions of free lunch eligible stu-\ndents in both states.\nResults from the three criteria used to measure charter\nschool presence are reported in Table 3. As discussed previ-\nously, the first treatment group includes traditional public\nschools that have one or more charter schools in the same\nThe second treatment group includes traditional public\nschools that have at least one charter school within a 5-mile\nThe third treatment group includes traditional public schools\nthat are located in counties where charter schools enroll\nmore than the median percentage of public school students\nmeans estimates in Table 3 show that the average share of\nnon-Hispanic White students fell more in traditional public\nschools that faced competition from charter schools in both\nschool year. There is also a decrease in the share of non-\nHispanic White students in other control schools, although\nthe size of the change is considerably smaller. This implies\nthat the introduction of charter schools may have caused this\nreduction. However, charter schools may be located in coun-\nties with different racial compositions in the first place. If\nthe location choice is nonrandom, the observed effects can\nbe biased. The difference-in-differences approach deals\nwith part of this issue by looking at the contemporaneous\nchanges in the control schools, which have no charters in\ntheir county or within their spatial proximity. This is because\nthe estimates control the differences between the two groups\nbefore the implementation of the policy.\nTable 2.

Percentages for free-lunch-\neligible students come from calculations from the CCD data, as reported in National Alliance for Public Charter Schools (2011).\nWhen the difference of the differences between the two\ngroups are calculated (for example, -10.0 to -3.8) in Ohio to\nseparate the impact of charter schools, the initial results show\nthat the introduction of charter schools leads to a 6.2 percent-\nage-point decrease in the share of non-Hispanic White stu-\ndents in Ohio traditional public schools that face charter\ncompetition in their county. The spatial and enrollment-\nbased measures show similar but overall slightly larger\nresults.\nIn the models for free- and reduced-price-lunch-eligible\nstudents, the basic estimates show effects in different direc-\ntions across states. The estimates show that the average share\nof free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools\nrose by 7.9 percentage points with the county-level measure\nand 13.9 percentage points with the spatial measure and 11.2\npoints with the enrollment-based measure from the 1995-\nTexas, the differences of the differences are negative--the\nshare of free-lunch-eligible students increased in this time\nperiod for the treatment and control schools, but more for the\ncontrol schools, suggesting that charter schools contribute to\nthe reduction in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in\ntraditional public schools.\nThe changes in the means suggest some statistically dis-\ntinguishable effects that may occur due to charter presence,\nbut they are only average changes across the groups of\nschools in those states in this time period. Tables 4 and 5\npresent the results from the fixed effects regression models\nthat incorporate the demographic and economic controls. In\nthese tables, the coefficient of interest is the interaction term\nbetween the postlegislation year and the competition vari-\nable. The first column for each state shows the results from\nthe first county-level exposure measure (C1 = school has one\nor more charters in the same county), the second column\nshows the results from the models with the second spatial\nexposure measure (C2 = school has one or more charters\nwithin a 5-mile radius), and the third column shows the\nenrollment measure (C3 = school is in county with above-\nmedian charter enrollment). Significant results are marked\nwith asterisks.\nThe regression results suggest that the existence of charter\nschools contributed to the reduction of the share of non-His-\npanic White students in traditional public schools that face\ncharter competition in both states. The size of the effect and\nthe sensitivity to the competition measure varies across\nstates, but the overall negative effect remains significant\nacross models. The initial differences in the means for Ohio\nschools show the largest change in the share of non-Hispanic\nWhites in public schools with a decline of 6.2 percentage\npoints. With the addition of county-level controls, the size of\nTable 3.

For the schools that experience direct competi-\ntion within a 5-mile radius, the share of non-Hispanic White\nstudents is reduced by 7.6 percentage points. With the addi-\ntional controls, the size of the coefficient is reduced to 6.3\nbut remains highly significant. In the models with the enroll-\nment-based measure, the basic model shows a 6.7 percent-\nage-point decrease in the share of non-Hispanic White\nstudents in the treatment group. The change reduces to 6.1\npercentage points with the controls but remains highly\nsignificant.\nIn Texas, schools that have charter schools in their coun-\nties saw the non-Hispanic White percentages of their students\ndrop by a statistically significant 6.5 percentage points more\nthan schools in other counties. Introducing the county-level\ncontrols reduces the size of the coefficient to 4.3 percentage\npoints, but the coefficient remains significant. Schools with\ncharter schools within 5 miles saw the non-Hispanic White\npercentage drop 5.6 percentage points more than schools\nwithout competition that close. With control variables, we\nstill observe a statistically significant 4.1 percentage-point\nreduction. The results with the enrollment-based specification\nalso suggest that the introduction of charter schools reduced\nthe share of non-Hispanic White students in traditional public\nschools by 4.2 percentage points even after controlling for\nchanges in the county populations and demographics. In sum,\nfor the racial composition outcome, all models show signifi-\ncant and negative effects.\nThe results from the free-lunch-eligible models are pre-\nsented on the right sides of the tables. The results suggest\nthat charter presence in these states is associated with the\nshare of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public\nschools, but the size and direction of the effect vary across\nstates. The results for Texas show reductions in the share of\nfree-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools are\nin counties that experience heavier charter exposure. Relative\nto schools without charter schools in their counties, schools\nwith one or more charters in their counties experienced\napproximately a 2.8 percentage-point drop in their share of\nfree-lunch-eligible students. With the addition of county-\nlevel controls, the size of the effect actually increases to 5.1\npercentage points and remains significant. In the models\nTable 4.

Standard errors in parentheses.\nwith the spatial measure, charter school presence again con-\ntributes to the reduction in the share of free-lunch-eligible\nstudents--by a statistically significant 1.9 percentage\npoints--and with the additional controls, the effect size again\nincreases modestly (compared with the first specification) to\n2.9 percentage points. For public schools located in counties\nwith above-median charter enrollment, with the addition of\ncontrols we observe a significant 4.2 percentage-point drop\nin the share of free-lunch-eligible students, which is similar\nto the results of the other models.\nThe results from the simple model for Ohio schools show\nthat the charter school competition contributes to increases\nin the share of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional pub-\nlic schools. Even after controlling for demographic and\nsocioeconomic changes, the size of the coefficient shows an\nincrease of 4.3 percentage points for the county-level speci-\nfication and 9.5 percentage points for the enrollment-based\nspecification. Relative to other public schools, public schools\nwith charter schools nearby experienced approximately a\n12-percentage-point rise in their share of free-lunch-eligible\nstudents. This model produced the largest effect size among\nall models. In sum, all specifications show significant\ndeclines in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in Texas\nand significant increases in the share of free-lunch-eligible\nstudents in Ohio.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nPoverty and inequality are the biggest challenges facing\nurban public education today and promoting school choice\nhas gained popularity across the country as a way to address\nthese long-standing problems. Majority of the states now\nhave hundreds of charter schools serving thousands of stu-\ndents, and advocacy groups are working to pass charter leg-\nislation in the remaining states and to modify existing\nlegislation to allow for growth and success of these schools.\nAs charter schools continue to proliferate around the country\nand to attract public and scholarly attention, their impact on\nthe public education system comes to the forefront as a major\npublic policy question. Many discussions of such system-\nwide effects revolve around the academic achievement\nissues; however, changes in the composition of the student\nbody is another important dimension of system-wide effects\ncreated by the introduction of charter schools in the public\neducation system. This study focuses on the racial and socio-\neconomic composition of students in traditional public\nschools in two states that have experienced a certain degree\nof charter competition in the last decade. The analysis pro-\nvides additional empirical evidence on observed changes in\nstudent distributions by relying on a panel design and school-\nlevel data. The results based on these data consistently sug-\ngest that the introduction of charter schools is associated\nwith changes in the share of non-Hispanic white students in\ntraditional public schools in both states. The estimates from\nthe race models are negative and robust at the county-level,\nspatial, and enrollment-based specifications, which is consis-\ntent with findings from previous research using data from\nother states. Charter presence measured in all three ways\nshowed significant reductions in traditional public schools'\nnon-Hispanic White student populations, but the magnitude\nof the change generally increased in the models with the spa-\ntially more precise measure. The controls explained away\nsome of the change and reduced effect size, but all coeffi-\ncients still remained significant. The effect size ranged from\n4.1 to 6.3 percentage points across models. The analyses\nshow that charter school presence is associated with changes\nin the share of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional pub-\nlic schools during the time period of the study, but in differ-\nent directions. The regression results showed that while the\ntraditional public schools experiencing charter school com-\npetition more intensely saw a decline in their share of free-\nlunch-eligible students in Texas, but they experienced an\nincrease in their share of free-lunch-eligible students in Ohio.\nThese changes range between 2.9 and 11.9 percentage points.\nThese results do not suggest that charter schools would\nnecessarily lead to additional segregation or concentration of\ncertain types of students. The shifts identified in the models\nhave shown a more complex aggregate impact than simple\nskimming. This suggests that the details of the legislation\nand implementation have the potential to minimize any\nunwanted sorting. Consequently, it is critical that we keep\ntrack of aggregate changes, especially as the observed asso-\nciations are robust and sensitive to different measures and\nsignificant even after controlling for changes in the popula-\ntion and private school enrollments in the area. The current\npopularity of the charter schools is undeniable, yet as\nFrankenberg et al. (2011) stated \"severe lack of essential data\non charters is of concern. Basic questions about the extent to\nwhich charter schools enroll low-income and ELL students\ncannot be conclusively answered and represent major\nresearch and civil rights policy concerns\" (p. 47). To create\nan inclusive school system and realize the integrative poten-\ntial of charter schools, more research and systematic data\ncollection, as well as cooperation and communication\nbetween charter school founders and operators, policy mak-\ners, and researchers are needed. Charter school reform is a\ncomplex policy that has very extensive repercussions on the\npublic education system. No single study can fully character-\nize the systemic impacts created by charter schools in a con-\nclusive manner. In this study, this complex phenomenon has\nbeen studied from a rather narrow empirical perspective, so\nit should be noted that this analysis merely points out a pat-\ntern, it does not explain it. If charter presence is systemati-\ncally associated with declines in the enrollment of\nnon-Hispanic White students in nearby traditional public\nschools, this may imply that some sorting is taking place in\nthe face of charter competition; however, further research on\nthe characteristics of the schools and the policies is needed to\nexplain the underlying mechanisms as this study has certain\nlimitations that need to be taken into account when\nconsidering the results. First, this study uses school-level\ndata; therefore, it is important to interpret the results as aver-\nage changes that do not apply to each individual charter\nschool. Second, the analysis deals with only two states and\ncannot be generalized to other states, which may have\nentirely different experiences with charters. Third, carefully\nselected control variables and school-level fixed effects\nmodels utilizing the difference-in-differences estimation are\nused to address the influence of preexisting trends, but in\nevaluating complex policies involving individual choice, it is\ndifficult to account for all sources of potential endogeneity.\nKeeping these constraints in mind, this study provides an\nempirical account of changes in the student composition of\ntraditional public schools from two states that allow charter\nschools. These observed aggregate-level changes over a\n14-year period put forward many questions and suggest\ninteresting avenues for further research that may increase our\nunderstanding of the charter school effect. First, the effect\nsizes are pretty small, but that is expected as these schools\nare still a minor portion of the educational landscape. Charter\nschools may be still too few to create any substantial effect\non the student distributions in the public school system. As\nthe laws become more permissible and the number of charter\nschools increases, are we going to observe larger effects?\nSecond, why is there a decline in the average proportion of\nnon-Hispanic White students served by traditional public\nschools in these states in the face of charter presence? State-\nlevel data presented earlier show that charter schools serve\ndisproportionately more black students when compared with\ntraditional public schools. If charter schools are not enrolling\nthese White students, does this mean that the schools choose\nto locate in areas with already high levels of minority concen-\ntration and speed up the ongoing departure of non-Hispanic\nWhite families to other areas or private schools?\nThird, while the traditional public schools in both states\nexperienced reductions in their shares of White students, the\nchanges in their levels of free-lunch-eligible students were in\nopposite directions. Can these dissimilar findings in different\nstates be reflecting differences in educational histories, provi-\nsions in the legislations, and operation of charter schools in\ndifferent states? If so, which aspects of legislation and opera-\ntion explain the observed difference? One possible explana-\ntion is the now defunct 75% provision in Texas charter\nlegislation. In 1995, the Texas Legislature passed laws allow-\ning 20 open-enrollment charter schools, which increased to\nnumber of open-enrollment charter schools serving students\nat-risk of failure or dropping out of school. However, if a\nschool enrolled 75% or more at-risk students, it qualified as a\n75% Rule charter school and was not subject to the cap (Texas\nCenter for Education Reform [TCER], 2002). This provision\nwas eliminated in 2001, but the results regarding the share of\nfree-lunch-eligible students in the models may reflect the\ntransfer of the at-risk students from traditional schools to\ncharters under the early 75% rule. Finally, why does the size\nof the effects, especially in the models investigating the\nchanges in the share of free-lunch-eligible students, vary this\nmuch across states and measures? For example, why do we\nsee the largest effects in Ohio schools that have charters in\nclose proximity? Examining the landscape in Ohio, it can be\nobserved that educational management organizations (EMOs)\nare very actively involved in the charter schools in the state\n(Hill & Lake, 2005). Previous research has shown that EMO-\noperated schools tend to be strongly racial segregative for\nminority and majority students as compared with the compo-\nsition of the sending district (Miron, Urschel, Mathis, &\nTornquist, 2010) and they seek out more Black students but\nare also focused on selecting fewer poor students than tradi-\ntional public schools (Ertas & Roch, 2012). Could there be a\nrelationship between the positive and large effect sizes and\nthe possible inclination of some profit-oriented EMOs to\nserve fewer disadvantaged and costly students? What other\npolicy variables such as racial balance provisions or transpor-\ntation requirements in the charter school legislation have\naffected these patterns? As the charter schools proliferate, we\ncan observe the effects in other states in future studies and\nhopefully discover differences in operation and legislation\nthat lead to the most desirable and equitable outcomes.\nAuthor's Note\nOpinions reflect those of the author and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the granting agencies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nsupported by a grant from American Educational Research\nAssociation which receives funds for its \"AERA Grants Program\"\nfrom the National Science Foundation and the National Center for\nEducation Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences (U.S.\nNotes\n1. Texas adopted its charter legislation in 1995, but the first\nschool opened its doors in 1996. Ohio adopted charter school\nlegislation in 1996. Most studies of charter schools, with the\nexception of large projects funded by U.S. Department of\nEducation or charter school interest groups focus on a single\nstate, which limits the ability to generalize from the findings.\nThe analyses in this article use data from two states that dif-\nfer considerably with regard to their demographic makeup\nand policy history, to examine whether similar changes exist\nin different contexts and whether the direction and magnitude\nof the change vary. Two states are in different census regions.\nTexas is in west south central division and Ohio is in east north\ncentral division. By 2011 figures, the percentage of Hispanic\nor Latino Origin were 38.1% at Texas, compared with 3.2% in\nOhio. Percentage of non-Hispanic White were 44.8% in Texas,\nand 81% in Ohio. The legislation and the history of charter\nschools in each state are different as well (see, for example,\nThe charter laws vary from state to state, reflecting the varying\neducational histories and the power of different political and\ncivil groups such as teacher unions. According to charter law\nscores published annually by the CER, Texas was ranked as the\n29th and Ohio as the 18th most charter friendly in the United\nStates (CER, 2012). Ohio also opted for a system of multiple\nsponsors, as opposed to a centralized approach. Alongside\nMinnesota, it is the only other state that allows nonprofit\norganizations to sponsor schools (Palmer, Terrell, Hassel, &\nSvahn, 2006). In sum, two states in the study were selected\nto maximize diversity with regard to geography, social and\npolitical context, and legislative variations. However, it is not\npossible to generalize findings from two states to the entirety\nof the education system in the country. Future research should\ncontinue to examine student distributions across and within\nschools in other states with substantial charter school presence\nsuch as Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, North\nCarolina, and Pennsylvania.\n 2. One may argue that this incentive will work for charter schools\nand regular public schools; however, it is reasonable to expect\ncharter schools to engage in selective admission policies to a\ngreater extent than traditional public schools. Most students\nare assigned to their neighborhood public schools on the basis\nof their residential locations.\n 3. The phrase is taken directly from U.S. Secretary of Education's\nForeword to the Innovations in Education: Successful Charter\nSchools report (U.S. Department of Education, 2004).\n4. School names and the highest grade served were also\nreviewed, and schools whose names contained the following\ncharacter strings were also eliminated from the analyses: juve-\nnile, detention, det., evening, program, center, office, hospital,\nhomebound, teleteaching, special, headstart, deaf, blind, kin-\ndergarten, and early childhood.\n 5.

By law, charter schools must ensure that students receive\nthe program and services on their Individualized Education\nPrograms (IEPs). As charter schools are public schools, under\nthe Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), they\nare responsible for ensuring that special education services\nare available to students with disabilities. However, previous\nresearch on this topic has shown that charters consistently\nserve fewer students with disabilities than public schools, even\nwhen schools for students with specific disabilities are consid-\nered (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Different reasons\nhave been suggested to explain this disparity including poten-\ntial discrimination against students with disabilities for mon-\netary reasons (Ramanathan & Zollers, 1999), unpreparedness\nschool operators regarding obligations under the law.Although\nthe provision of special education services and underrepresen-\ntation of students with special needs in charter schools is an\nimportant topic in charter school research, the issue of whether\nthe needs of students with disabilities are being met is out-\nside the scope of this article. As the numbers served by charter\nschools increase, future research tracking these students across\nschools and those focusing on specialized charter schools will\ncontribute to this literature.\n 7. The equation used is as follows:\nwhere lat_1, long_1 and lat_2, long_2 are the latitudes and\nlongitudes of two points. The result from the equation is multi-\nplied by 69.11, which is the approximate number of miles per\ndegree on the earth.\n8. These variables are merged into the Common Core Data\n(CCD) files by using county identifiers. All control variables\n9. It is important to control for private school enrollment, spe-\ncifically when the states have prevalent voucher programs. For\nexample, Ohio has a number of statewide voucher programs.\nSome are small such as the Autism Scholarship Program\nthat was enacted in 2003 and targets children with autism.\nEducational Choice Scholarship Program (or EdChoice) was\nenacted in 2005 and serves students who attend public schools\nthat are in Academic Watch or Emergency in the state's rat-\ning system. The most recent one (Jon Peterson Special Needs\nScholarship) was enacted in 2011 and provides vouchers to\nstudents who have an IEP. These programs allow private\nschool scholarships to be paid by public funding for students\nattending low-performing schools.\n10. The dependent variables are changes in outcome measures\nestimated using the \"areg, absorb\" command in Stata on data\nin the long format. This is equivalent to adding a dummy for\neach school, but the value of each school coefficient is not\nshown in the tables presenting results from the regression\nmodels.\nReferences\nBifulco, R., & Ladd, H.
