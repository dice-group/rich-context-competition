Design and Methods:We\nengaged in content analysis of activity meas-\nU.S. public use data sets with nationally\nrepresentative samples of older adults. Data sets\nincluded the Health & Retirement Survey (HRS),\nAmericans' Changing Lives Survey (ACL), Midlife\nin the United States Survey (MIDUS), the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), and the Panel Study\nof Income Dynamics survey (PSID). Two waves of\neach data set were analyzed. Results: We iden-\ntified 13 distinct activity domains across the 5 data\nsets, with substantial differences in representation of\nthose domains among the data sets, and variance in\nthe number and type of activity measures included\nin each. Implications: Our findings indicate\nthat although it is possible to study multiple activ-\nity engagement within existing data sets, fuller sets\nof activity measures need to be developed in order\nto evaluate the portfolio of activities older adults\nengage in and the relationship of these portfolios to\nhealth and wellness outcomes. Importantly, clearer\nconceptual models of activity broadly conceived are\nrequired to guide this work.\nKeywords: Activity,Secondarydatasets,Measurement,\nContent analysis\nScientific interest in activity engagement by\nolder adults has expanded in recent years as\nresearchers have sought to better understand the\nrange of activities older adults engage in and the\nimpact of activity engagement on outcomes such\nas health and wellness, quality of life, and life satis-\nfaction. However, despite the increased scholarship\nin the area of activity, there has been less attention\nto defining what activity means conceptually. This\nincludes determining what counts as an activity--\nfor example, is it anything a person does with his\nor her time? Additionally, the measurement of dif-\nferent types of activities (e.g., physical, social, psy-\nchological, and economic) and knowledge about\nhow to use multiple activity variables in statisti-\ncal models are both underdeveloped. In general,\nresearchers target a single domain of activity, like\nphysical activity, volunteering, caregiving, employ-\nment, or social activities, despite the fact that older\nadults can and do engage in multiple activities on a\ndaily basis and at any one time. Research also tends\nto exclude categories of time use that have not tra-\nditionally been thought of as activities, but that\ncan consume significant amounts of an individual's\ntime, such as attending medical appointments and\nThe Gerontologist\nengaging in household chores. Moreover, the rel-\nevance of intensity of participation--for example,\nthe difference between involvement and engage-\nment in activities and roles (James, Besen, Matz-\nCosta, & Pitt-Catsouphes, 2012)--is not always\nconsidered in analysis of activities, yet may be\nimportant for understanding how individuals bal-\nance engagement in multiple activities.\nImproving the ability of researchers to study\nmultiple activity engagement can help to generate\ngreater understanding that helps both to clarify the\ncomplex relationships between activity and health\nand wellness outcomes and to better define activity\nitself. To help move this work forward, we under-\ntook an informed assessment of what our current\ndata resources are for studying multiple activities.\nWe present our study findings here.\nRationale for Assessing Data Resources for\nStudying Activity\nMoving toward understanding activity in a\nmore complex way is supported by continued calls\nto facilitate healthy and positive aging through\npublic health initiatives and evidence-based prac-\ntices (U.S. Department of Health & Human\n2007). The growing body of research literature on\nspecific types of activities have included studies on\nsocial engagement, work, caregiving, volunteer-\ning, religious activity, leisure, and physical activity\nand their relationships to health, cognitive func-\ntion, functional status, and mortality (Buchman,\nWilson, & Bennett, 2008; Glass, De Leon, Bassuk,\nKarp et al., 2006). In general, activity participation\nhas been linked to positive outcomes (Chipperfield,\ncertain activities, like caregiving or employment\nunder certain conditions, have been associated with\nnegative outcomes (Adams, McClendon, & Smyth,\nadults themselves have expressed the idea that\nengagement in activities, from personal hobbies to\nproductive work roles, is vital in the pursuit of a\ngood old age (Bowling & Gabriel, 2007; Clarke,\nLiu-Ambrose, Zyla, McKay, & Khan, 2005).\nResearchers have found that motivation\n(Holahan&Suzuki,2005),higherlevelsofperceived\ncontrol, self-esteem, efficacy (Bailis, Chipperfield,\n& Helgason, 2008), and social support (Wilson &\nSpink, 2006) are all important positive correlates of\nindividual activity engagement, as are the contexts\nin which activities are undertaken, including neigh-\nborhood characteristics (Mendes de Leon et al.,\n2009). Lower levels of formal education (Shaw\n& Spokane, 2008), presence of disease diagnosis\n(Ashe, Miller, Eng, & Noreau, 2009), and greater\nfear of falling (Deshpande et al., 2008) have also\nbeen related to reduced activity engagement.\nWithin the body of research on activity and\nolder adults, measurement of activity contains tre-\nmendous variation, due in part to the lack of strong\nconceptual models of activity that are broadly\ndefined. In our review of the public health, gerontol-\nogy, rehabilitation, and related literatures, we iden-\ntified three main issues that stymie the development\nof knowledge related to activity. First, operation-\nalization of specific activity domains is inconsistent\nacross studies. For example, physical activity has\nbeen evaluated as a specific single item, like walk-\ning (Nagel, Carlson, Bosworth, & Michael, 2008),\nand as a composite ordinal scale of physical activi-\nties that comprise basic activities of daily living\n(Peri et al., 2008). Second, data collection methods\nvary widely depending on the aims of the study,\nproducing findings that are difficult to compare or\nassess. Staying with physical activity, data collec-\ntion modalities range from self-report in activity\ndiaries (Atienza, Oliveira, Fogg, & King, 2006) to\nactigraphs (Chipperfield, 2008) and accelerometers\n(Bailis, Chipperfield, Perry, Newall, & Haynes,\n2008), which electronically track physical activ-\nity. Third, single activities or domains, like physical\nactivity, are generally not reviewed within the con-\ntext of larger activity patterns, making it difficult\nto understand how participation in a given activity\ndomain relates to participation in other domains\n(e.g., physical activity, volunteering, providing\nsocial support, and work) or how such participa-\ntion collectively supports larger health and wellness\noutcomes. Of the few studies we found that consid-\nered multiple activity engagement, results indicated\nthat when a broad set of activity items were reduced\ninto composite domains, patterns in activity were\nevident (Burr, Mutchler, & Caro, 2007). Using this\napproach, analysis of antecedents and outcomes of\nactivity patterns on areas of health and wellness,\nincluding incidence of dementia (Paillard-Borg,\nFratiglioni, Windbald, & Wang, 2009) and depres-\nsion (Arai et al., 2007) have been studied.\nWe believe that to efficiently and effectively\nadvance research on activities and older adults,\nbetter approaches to conceptualizing, measuring,\nand analyzing activities must be developed. The\nprojected scope of this work is large and involves\nseveral components, including (a) improving the\nconceptual specification of activity, (b) identifying\nexisting measures of activity, (c) assessing measure-\nment properties, and (d) evaluating the use of a\ncollection of activity measures to investigate multi-\nple activity engagement. The analysis we present in\nthis article addresses the second component listed\nearlier, completing a partial inventory of activity\nmeasures available. We premised our work on a\nbroad model of activity and contributors to activ-\nity, as described subsequently.\nTheoretical Context for Understanding Activity\nEngagement\nA broad look at nearly 50 years of theoretical\nwork on activity and aging shows that interest in\nactivity has fluctuated over time and has some-\nwhat paralleled pathways of empirical research.\nHavinghurst (1957) first formalized Activity\nTheory in 1957, and since then, activity has been\nincluded either directly or indirectly in a host of\nsignificant conceptual models of aging. A recent\nand global framework of activity receiving wide-\nspread attention is the WHO's (2007) model of\nActive Aging, the centerpiece of its agenda for\nhealthy aging. Although it does not explicitly\naddress the paradigms of successful aging (Rowe\n& Kahn, 1998) or productive aging (Butler &\nGleason, 1985), the WHO's model does posit six\ndeterminants of activity engagement--all of which\nare influenced by culture and gender--that result\nin active aging. There are three individual-level fac-\ntors: personal, behavioral, and social determinants;\nthis is consistent with socioemotional selectivity\ntheory (Carstensen, 1992; Hendricks & Cutler,\n2004). Also, there are three structural-level fac-\ntors--the physical environment, economics, and\nhealth and social services--that align with public\nhealth frameworks, like the social model of disabil-\nity put forth in the International Classification of\nFunction (WHO, 2007). \"Active ageing\" is defined\nas the optimization of \"opportunities for health,\nparticipation and security in order to enhance qual-\nity of life as people age\" (WHO, 2007). The Active\nAgeing Framework guides WHO's global age-\nfriendly communities initiative and is based upon\nthe United Nation's 2002 Madrid International\nPlan of Action on Ageing (United Nations, 2002).\nWeproposethattheconceptofactiveagingimplies\nengagement in multiple domains of activities simul-\ntaneously, which requires greater understanding of\na person's activity portfolio. We distill the idea of an\nactivity portfolio from Birren and Feldman's (1997)\nlarger concept of a life portfolio, a tool for indi-\nviduals to plan and review life investments. In its\nbroadest sense, an activity portfolio would be com-\nposed of things a person does or spends time doing,\nranging from sleeping to thinking to exercising. In a\nmore focused approach, an activity portfolio might\nhave domains that are evaluated for their relevance\nin understanding health and wellness outcomes.\nOur ability to assess multiple activity engage-\nment and activity portfolios using existing data\nsets, however, is limited to the availability of activ-\nity measures in these data sets. To begin the process\nof determining the range and scope of measures\navailable to researchers, we completed a content\nanalysis of activity measures in five U.S.-based\npublic use data sets commonly used to study older\nadults. Our aims were to inventory discrete activ-\nity measures and group them into conceptual\ndomains representing areas of activity engage-\nment. Through this qualitative review, we intended\nto identify potential gaps in activity domains, to\nunderstand challenges in interpreting measure-\nment domains, and to assess data set potential for\nadvancing research on activity and activity pat-\nterns and portfolios among older adults.\nDesign and Methods\nOur analysis was guided by these research aims:\n(a) To determine the number of activity-related\nvariables in the sample of secondary data sets, (b)\nto determine for each data set whether discrete\nactivity variables can be grouped into cogent con-\nceptual domains, (c) to identify gaps in activity\ndomains and challenges in interpreting domains,\nand (d) to determine which of the data sets assessed\nseemed most appropriate for pursuing analysis of\nactivity patterns and portfolios in future research\non activity and older adults.\nSample\nWe selected public use data sets readily avail-\nable and regularly used by gerontology researchers.\nCriteria for initial data set selection were: self-report\nsurvey, nationally representative population of the\nUnited States, inclusion of older adults (65+), and\nsurvey content covering at least one area of activ-\nity recognized in the literature (e.g., physical activity\nand volunteering). Our initial sample included nine\ndata sets: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),\nAmericans' Changing Lives Study (ACL), Midlife\nin the United States (MIDUS), National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS), Panel Study of Income\nDynamics survey (PSID),American Time Use Survey\n(ATUS), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n(BRFSS), American Community Survey (ACS), and\nLongitudinal Studies of Aging (LSOAs). From this\nsample, we chose five longitudinal data sets (HRS,\nACL, MIDUS, NHIS, and PSID) that contained\nsimilar measures of physical and emotional health\nfor purposes of modeling outcomes of activity par-\nticipation. Descriptions of these are presented in\nTable 1. Three data sets (ATUS, ACS, and BRFSS)\nwere excluded because data are cross-sectional only.\nLSOAs were excluded because the sample starts at\nage 70 and limits assessment of activity at younger\nages. To meet our research aims, we reviewed the\ntwo most recent waves of data collected at the time\nof our analysis. Earlier waves of some data sets may\nbe reviewed in future analyses to better understand\nlongitudinal patterns of activity engagement.\nMeasures\nFor the purposes of this study, we intention-\nally defined activity broadly, and we did not select\nmeasures using an existing theory or model of\nactivity. Instead, we wanted to identify the widest\nuniverse of activity measures without prejudice and\nto determine a data set's potential to inform sub-\nsequent analyses of multiple activity engagement.\nAlthough we understand the relevance of exist-\ning conceptual schematics of participation to the\nproject, including the International Classification\nof Function (WHO, 2001), we determined not to\nmake this link for this analysis.\nBased on this approach, we devised a simple test\nto identify an activity measure.First,we determined\nwhether the intent of a survey item was to inquire\nabout \"doing\" something, regardless of how it\nwas phrased. This is in comparison to inquiring\nabout feeling, thinking, believing, having, getting\nhelp with, or similar question stems. Second, if it\nseemed a survey item was about \"doing,\" we tested\nour assessment by rephrasing the survey question\nto see if it was possible to reword it as \"do/did you\ndo X\" or \"how much/often do you do X?\" If it was\nnot possible to rephrase the measure into either of\nthese two ways, we determined it was not an activ-\nity measure. Third, we reviewed the time period of\nthe activity. If the question was about whether an\nactivity was done or not within the standard look-\nback range of the survey (e.g., the HRS inquires\nabout activities done the year of the survey and the\nyear prior), we included it. If the question asked\n\"did you ever do X. . .,\" but did not ask when that\nactivity was done, we logged it in our notes but\nexcluded it from the analysis because we could not\nassign it a specific temporal frame that would per-\nmit it to be analyzed as part of an activity portfolio\nthat included measures with the same look-back\nperiod. Measures that asked about the experience\nof doing the activity (e.g., where/when the activity\nis done, effort required to complete the activity, or\nany other description of the activity or the context\nwithin which it was performed) were also noted in\nour logs but not included in the analysis. In sum,\ninclusion criteria required that it was possible to\nrecode the measure into either a binary or ordinal\nvariable that could be empirically assessed to indi-\ncate whether a person was doing an activity or not.\nData Collection and Analysis\nWe selected content analysis as a method of data\ncollection and analysis because of its suitability for\nreviewing discrete items systematically and report-\ning findings of counts, categories, and subdomains\nlection involved identifying all activity items within\nin Table 1. Data analysis involved sorting meas-\nures into categories and generating descriptive sta-\ntistics (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s, 2008). Reliability was based\non intercoder agreement (Burla et al., 2008). Our\nanalysis met four primary standards of rigorous\ncontent analysis including purposive sampling of\na defined population (publicly available secondary\ndata sets with nationally representative samples\nof older adults), variable selection based on past\nresearch or theory (activity domains and meas-\nures), defined medium of review (electronic files),\nspecific research aims (Aims 1 and 2 above), and\noperationalized definitions of critical analysis vari-\nables (activity measures are defined in Measures\nsection earlier).\nIn Part 1 of the content analysis, two review-\ners compiled lists of all activity-related variables in\neach wave of the data set under review and then\ngrouped them into general domains according to\nlike variables. They assigned each survey item to\nonly a single domain. For survey items with a single\n20c) were reviewed as individual variables. Only\nTable 1.

In surveys\nwith skip patterns (e.g.,\"if yes, go to. . .\" and \"if no,\nskip to. . .\"), we counted all questions in the \"yes\"\npattern in order to capture all of the activity meas-\nures under a single question line.Surveys that sought\nto validate responses by asking multiple questions\nabout the same activity were noted in our data files,\nbut these items were not multiply counted. In the\nage-stratified data sets, we did not select any ques-\ntions related to activity that were asked of younger\nadults but not asked of older adults.\nIn Part 2, findings from each data set were\nreviewed in a series of conference calls with four\nresearchers and discussed until agreement was\nreached regarding inclusion or exclusion of activity\nitems for each wave. The researchers simultaneously\nengaged in review of categorization of individual\nitems into conceptual domains. During this review\nprocess, we recorded decision rules for identification\nof activity items and definitions of categories and\nestablished guidelines for categorizing measures into\nconceptual domains. We added and further refined\nrules throughout the process. After a final rule book\nwas established, we retroactively applied all rules to\neach wave of each data set and completed a com-\nparative review of its application by two researchers.\nAny discrepancies in application of the final rule set\nwere discussed until agreement was reached.\nResults\nTable 2 presents the 13 domains identified in the\nanalysis and their definitions.

Civic activities Activities that require individuals to actively participate in formally organized events,\nmeetings, programs, or events (e.g., volunteering and going to meetings or clubs).\nE. Leisure activities Activities done by choice during an individual's free or discretionary time (e.g., reading,\nwatching TV, listening to music, dining out, and attending lectures). In this analysis,\nleisure does not include activities specified in other domains, like physical activity,\nalthough some people may view these as leisure.\nF.

Computer activities Activities related to general computer use (e.g., sending e-mails and searching the\ninternet) that are not otherwise identified as having an explicit purpose, such as\ne-mailing a doctor or a family member.\naims 1 and 2 are reported in Table 3, which pre-\nsents numerical counts of measures by domain\nand data set wave. The number of activity meas-\nures identified across the five data sets ranged from\ntwo data sets with the most domains were MIDUS\n(n = 12) and HRS (n = 12). Employment/paid work\nand physical activity were the only domains pre-\nsent in all five data sets. Health risk behavior activ-\nities were present in four of the five data sets.\nThe number of measures that are the same across\nwaves of a data set is also reported by domain in\nTable 3. In most cases, the survey measures across\nwaves are identical. In others, the wording may be\nslightly different (e.g., ACL 1994: \"Including paid\nvacationsandsickleave,howmanyweeksaltogether\nwere you employed during the past 12 months?\"\nand ACL 2002: \"How many weeks altogether were\nyou employed during the past 12 months, includ-\ning paid vacations and sick leave?\"). Survey items\nthat address similar concepts but either have dis-\ntinctly different wording that changes the focus\nof the question or include different examples of\nactivities were not counted as being the same (e.g.,\ndo you engage in moderate physical activity [e.g.,\nbowling or using a vacuum cleaner?]\" and MIDUS\nate physical activity, that is not physically exhaust-\ning, but it causes your heart rate to increase slightly\nand you typically work up a sweat? [Examples lei-\nsurely sports like light tennis, slow or light swim-\nming, low-impact aerobics, or golfing without a\npower cart; brisk walking, mowing the lawn with a\nwalking lawn mower].\"). Additional details of the\ndata analysis not presented in this article are avail-\nable from the authors.\nLimitations\nLimitations for this analysis included a small\nsample size and our assessment of only 2 years of\nsurvey instruments. We recognize that our cod-\ning of some items as activities (such as health risk\nbehaviors) may be questioned, but we believed it\nwas important to include them in this initial activ-\nity item review. Despite these limitations, we find\nthat the content analysis provided the benefit of\ncreating a replicable example of assessing activ-\nity items within secondary data sets that could be\napplied to other surveys. It also yielded a broad\nrange of activity domains for consideration in\nempirical work.\nDiscussion of Findings\nResults from our analysis showed that each data\nset contained multiple activity domains. Although\nno data set contained all of the identified domains,\nHRS and MIDUS contained most of them. Within\neach data set we reviewed, the number of activ-\nity items per domain varied. The specific activity\nitems within domains also differed across data sets.\nMoreover, in cases where similar activities were\ninquired about (i.e., volunteering), often the meas-\nures themselves were not the same across data sets.\nOne reason that there might be more activity items\nin a particular domain may be extensive triangula-\ntion of information in some data sets, such as the\nPSID, which rigorously measures employment so\nthat fluctuations in employment and employment\ntrends over time can be confidently investigated.\nA reason that very few items may exist in a domain\nmay be that these activity domains were not consid-\nered to be essential to the mission of the study. That\nsaid, we recognize that a small number of items does\nnot necessarily equate to limitations in measure-\nment, and item quality is highly relevant to obtain-\ning adequate and meaningful data. Additionally, we\nnote that some items, such as \"helping neighbors\"\nor\"helping others manage medications,\"may repre-\nsent complex activities that include social, physical,\npsychological, and other components (e.g., financial\nmanagement and time spent on a computer).\nStill, we found the analytical grouping of activ-\nity measures into domains to be useful in under-\nstanding data resources available to assess multiple\nactivity engagement. In the following sections, we\nconsider the implications of identified gaps in\ndomains and variance in activity items within and\nacross data sets, as well as challenges in interpret-\ning the domains. This is followed by recommenda-\ntions for this work going forward.\nGaps in Activity Domains and Variance in\nActivity Items\nAs noted earlier,our findings resulted in the iden-\ntification of a broad set of activity domains across\nthe five data sets but clearly showed gaps within\nand between data sets in terms domain representa-\ntion and content.The only universal domain across\nsurveys was employment although the number of\nitems within this domain that fit the \"do you do\"\ncriteria ranged from 32 in the PSID to just 2 items\nin the HRS. The PSID inquires extensively about\nstatus, nature, and time spent in employment, tri-\nangulating data to ensure both rigor and ability\nTable 3.

In\ncontrast, the HRS asks only about current employ-\nment status and hours spent per week working for\npay. The other surveys fall somewhere in the mid-\ndle, asking additional questions about type, nature,\nand specifics of employment. Depending on what a\nresearcher's aims are, variables providing dynam-\nics of employment may be particularly relevant\nwhen investigating the interaction of employ-\nment factors and other life activities. On the other\nhand, if formal employment status (employed and\nnot employed) is the only variable of interest, the\none or two employment items may be enough. In\nan empirical analysis exploring multiple activity\nengagement, employment status and hours spent\nworking may be the most salient measures.\nCivic activities and religious activities were cov-\nered in four of the five data sets, with MIDUS hav-\ning the greatest number of items in each category\noverall. In MIDUS, ACL, and HRS, items related\nto civic and religious activities were similar in\nwhat they measured (e.g., volunteering and attend-\ning religious services). MIDUS more extensively\nmeasured what type of organizations or popula-\ntion groups individuals volunteered to work with\nand collected more details regarding religious\nengagement.\nThe fact that PSID had no civic activity items\nand NHIS had only one was disappointing given\ncurrent interest in volunteering and productive\naging and their relationships to positive health\noutcomes. This limits investigation of patterns\nof employment and transition to or inclusion of\ncivic activities in retirement and their relationship\nto positive health outcomes using these data sets.\nThe lack of religious activities in these data sets\nsimilarly stymies researchers' ability to investigate\nrelationships between health and spiritual and/or\nactivities like volunteering. As noted earlier, these\nomissions may be attributed to the original mis-\nsion of each survey, and the survey developers,\ntherefore, should not be faulted for exclusion;\nrather, survey developers could be encouraged to\nconsider the possibility of adding items in unrep-\nresented activity domains to facilitate research\nexploring complex interactions of multiple activity\nengagement.\nHousehold chore activities were assessed by\nmany items in ACL and HRS, but very few in the\nother data sets. In many of the physical activity\nitems, engagement in housework and exterior yard\nwork were used as examples for explaining dis-\ntinctions between light, moderate, and vigorous\nphysical activity and/or exercise. With the excep-\ntion of the 2004 wave of MIDUS, only a few items\nin each data set inquire about physical exercise.\nGiven the likely empirical correlation of household\nchores and physical activity, understanding how\nthese domains differ (if they do) becomes important\nto delineate. Helping others may also link closely\nto activities in both the aforementioned domains.\nIn creating all three of these domains (household\nchores, physical activity, and helping others), our\nresearch team felt interpreting the intent of what\neach survey item was trying to assess was useful in\nassigning each item to a single domain. At the same\ntime, we recognize that what these items measure\nspecifically may overlap (e.g., physical engage-\nment), suggesting the need for greater conceptual\nand measurement work in these cases and others\nof a similar nature.\nFinancial management and computer activity\ndomains are not routinely included. In each, the\nitems are somewhat generic (time spent managing\nbills and using a computer) but do capture activi-\nties that can consume large amounts of time. From\na similar viewpoint, help-seeking activities, present\nin four of the five data sets, may range from barely\nany time spent to significant time spent. In all of\nthe domains, fluctuations in time spent may influ-\nence time or effort available for other domains of\nactivities. The larger number of items in NHIS and\nMIDUS ask specifically about types of help sought\n(e.g., physician, psychologist, and dentist), offer-\ning more detail about the range of help seeking.\nIn contrast, the time spent using a computer, a sin-\ngle item in this domain, only generically inquires\nabout use of the machine, not what it was used for.\nIn trying to asses this, our research team returned\nto what became a familiar refrain for us during this\nanalysis: It likely depends on the specific research\naims as to whether the number of items and their\nquality are strong enough to produce a meaningful\nanalysis of multiple activity engagement.\nDifficulty in Interpreting Domains\nIn terms of interpreting domains, we struggled\nin determining whether health risk behavior was\na legitimate domain of activity. In the literature,\nhealth behaviors are treated distinctly from physi-\ncal and social activities. However, in our iterative\ndiscussions, we found that we could make the case\nfor including health risk behavior as these activi-\nties are sometimes done with singular focus (e.g.\ntaking a smoking break) or done in tandem with\nother activities (drinking alcohol and socializing).\nWithin our formula of asking \"do you do X?\", we\ndetermined health risk behavior qualified as an\nactivity domain, but we recognized much more\nthought would be required if this domain was to be\nincluded in a broad conceptual model of activity.\nLeisure, unexpectedly, also became a troubling\ndomain for our research team. We determined that\nonly two data sets, HRS and MIDUS, include lei-\nsure items, because most other activity items fit\ninto domains with sharper parameters. One per-\nson's leisure activity is not always another's; per-\nsonal preference and interpretation of activity\nseem important in deciding what exactly leisure is.\nSimilarly, within the basic activity domain, items\nlike sleeping, eating, and having sex fit our inclu-\nsion criteria but may or may not be useful items in\ninvestigating an activity profile unless put into a\nspecific context.\nImplications for Studying Multiple Activities or\nActivity Domains Simultaneously\nBased on our findings, we suggest that it is\npossible to categorize activity items within exist-\ning data sets into domains and that the resulting\ndomains lend themselves to the study of multi-\nple activity engagement (activity portfolios) and\nolder adults. As for the question of whether or\nnot there are currently enough activity items\nwithin the data sets reviewed to begin to study\nactivity portfolios, we would answer yes based\non the quality of the data sets and the fact that\nat least two--HRS and MIDUS--contain most\nof the identified domains. We offer a strong\nnote of caution, however, in that it is unclear\nwhether the best measurement of activity items\nis presented in these surveys and whether enough\nitems exist within each domain to truly capture\nwhat a domain might represent. Depending on\nthe research aims, missing domains or limited\nitems within each domain may be handled dif-\nferently by researchers. Despite these challenges,\nnext steps in this work might include assessing\nthe potential to create composite measures based\non activity domains and exploring the existence\nof activity patterns and portfolios. Examining\nactivity change over time using multiple waves\nof the longitudinal data sets assessed here also\nholds potential for better understanding activity\nengagement over the life course.\nOur findings also highlight the need to bet-\nter conceptually align measures of functional\nlimitations (activities of daily living) and meas-\nures of activity engagement. Arguably, the \"Do\nyou do X?\" criterion we employed in this analy-\nsis to identify activity variables within data sets\nis broad enough that it could capture some func-\ntional capacity items. In most surveys, the intent\nof functional limitation questions are differenti-\nated by inquiring \"can you do X?\" versus \"do you\ndo X?\". However, it is possible that future work\nassessing activity portfolios may help researchers\nbetter understand the relationship of functional\nlimitation to multiple activity engagement among\nolder adults by exploring its role as an antecedent\nand outcome of health and wellness across a broad\nrange of activity domains.\nFinally, although our findings identified 13 dis-\ntinct domains in the five data sets we examined,\nwe believe there are likely more domains rel-\nevant to the development of activity portfolios.\nThese include areas that range from more internal\nactivities, like thinking or self-reflection, to more\nexternal activities like pursuing educational oppor-\ntunities. We also believe that there may be utility in\nsubdividing our identified domains to create more\nrefined categories of activity that more adequately\ncapture motivation or intent of activities. For\nexample, attending religious services may be quite\ndifferent than meditation despite the fact that both\nmight be viewed as spiritual. Empirical analysis of\nactivity domains can help determine activities that\nare similar enough to become composite variables\nfor a single domain within a data set, but it will not\nidentify missing components of domains. For this,\nmore attention should be given to the development\nof a conceptual model of activity portfolios.\nConclusion\nOur analysis highlights the need for greater\nattention to creating strong data resources for\nstudying multiple activity engagement among\nolder adults. Our assessment of five of the most\ncommonly used data sets in gerontology research\nsuggests that there is potential to use them in\nthis work, but that inclusion of a fuller range of\ndomains, attention to the items included within\neach domain, and the measurement of those items\nis essential for generating robust research find-\nings. Moreover, our analysis draws attention to the\nlack of conceptual clarity around activity, broadly\ndefined, and the distinct need for development of\nstronger theoretical models of activity to support\ninvestigation of activity portfolios.\nFunding\nThis work is supported by a grant from the National Institute on\n"
