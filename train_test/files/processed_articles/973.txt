Popkin\nInterest in ethnicity-specific definitions of obesity has been hindered by a lack of data clarifying whether or not\nobesity-related comorbid conditions occur at different levels of body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height (m)2)\nin different ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to examine ethnic differences in the strength of the\nassociation between BMI and hypertension. Cross-sectional data obtained from adults aged 30\u00ad65 years in\nused. Higher BMI was associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension in all ethnic groups. However, at BMI\nlevels less than 25, prevalence difference figures suggested a stronger association between BMI and\nhypertension in Chinese men and women but not in Filipino women, compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Non-\nHispanic Blacks and Filipino women had a higher prevalence of hypertension at every level of BMI compared\nwith non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans. These ethnic differences in the strength of association\nbetween BMI and hypertension and in underlying prevalence warrant further investigation into the use of\nethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs in clinical settings to more accurately identify individuals at risk from obesity.

In Caucasian\npopulations, the association between BMI and mortality is \"J-\nshaped,\" and the nadir of the curve occurs between the BMI\nthe World Health Organization has devised a classification\nunderweight, those with BMIs above this range are considered\noverweight or \"at risk,\" and those with BMIs greater than or\nequal to 30 are considered obese (4, 5).\nIn the effort to quantify the global obesity epidemic, it has\nbecome common practice for epidemiologists to apply these\ncutoffs to disparate populations and ethnic groups. A prob-\nlem arising from the interpretation of these comparisons is\nan assumption that different ethnic groups have similar risks\nof morbidity and mortality at similar levels of BMI. There is\nno evidence to suggest that this assumption is valid (6).\nIndeed, limited evidence that Asians have a higher preva-\nlence of disease at lower BMI levels than Caucasians has\nprompted an international task force (the World Health\nOrganization/International Obesity Task Force) to recom-\nmend that overweight status for Asian adults be based on a\ncomes primarily from a cross-sectional study of a workforce\npopulation of Hong Kong Chinese in which morbidity risk\nfor type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and albu-\nminuria increased at a BMI of approximately 23 (8). A\nhigher risk of type II diabetes was also observed among\nIndian Asians from Mauritius at this BMI level (7). Other\nstudies have found that Asians have smaller frames than\nCaucasians and therefore have higher levels of body fat at\nsimilar BMIs (9, 10). However, each of these studies repre-\nsents a distinct Asian ethnic group, and rather than support\nthe notion of a set of cutoffs that is generalizable to all\n\"Asian\" populations, as has been recommended, they point\nto cutoffs for defining obesity and overweight that are spe-\ncific to individual ethnic groups.\nEthnic differences in disease morbidity and mortality have\nalso been recognized in US racial/ethnic groups (11), as have\ndifferences in body composition (12). However, to our knowl-\nedge, ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs for defining overweight\nand obesity have not been contemplated in the United States.\nThere is a renewed focus in the United States on understand-\ning these racial/ethnic disparities in health (13, 14), and\nredefining weight status according to ethnicity could dramat-\nically influence how these disparities are viewed.\nIn this study, we used data obtained from two racial/\nethnic groups in Asia and three racial/ethnic groups in the\nUnited States to examine ethnic differences in the associa-\ntion between BMI and hypertension.\nEthnic Differences in the BMI-  Relation 347\nSubjects included in our investigation were nonpregnant\nparticipants aged 30\u00ad65 years from three different health\nsurveys: the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the Cebu\nLongitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey from the\nPhilippines, and the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey from the United States.\nThe China Health and Nutrition Survey is an ongoing lon-\ngitudinal survey conducted jointly by the Chinese Academy\nof Preventive Medicine and the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill. The survey used multistage random\ncluster sampling to select participants from 3,800 house-\nholds in eight provinces of China that vary considerably in\nterms of geography, stage of economic development, and\nhealth status. Further details on the design of the China\nHealth and Nutrition Survey have been published elsewhere\nfrom 3,423 nonpregnant participants with blood pressure\nmeasurements.\nThe Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey is an\nongoing study of a cohort of Filipino women who gave birth\nwomen were included in this analysis.\nFor comparison with the Asian populations, similar data\nfrom 7,957 participants in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey were included. This survey,\nconducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics in\npling design to obtain national estimates of the health and\nnutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US population.\nNon-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans were over-\nsampled. Details on this survey have been published else-\nwhere (17) and can also be found at the National Center for\nHealth Statistics website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.\nhtm).\nStandard procedures for the measurement of blood pres-\nsure were used in all surveys (18). Three blood pressure\nmeasurements were taken by trained personnel on the right\narm of each participant, who had been seated prior to mea-\nsurement. Standard mercury sphygmomanometers were\nused with appropriate cuff sizes. Systolic blood pressure\nwas measured at the first appearance of a pulse sound\n(Korotkoff phase 1) and diastolic blood pressure at the dis-\nappearance of the pulse sound (Korotkoff phase 5). We used\nthe average of the three measurements from each of the sur-\nveys.   was defined as a systolic blood pressure\ngreater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood\npressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or the use of\nantihypertension medication.\nAn important issue related to this definition of hyperten-\nsion is the potential for weight loss among persons who had\nbeen prediagnosed (i.e., those on antihypertension medica-\ntion). Weight reduction is the primary lifestyle modification\nrecommended for persons with hypertension. Moreover, this\neffect would be different between ethnic groups because of\ndifferences in the proportion of prediagnosed individuals\n(see tables 1 and 2). However, after conducting an analysis\nstratified by diagnosis, we chose to include persons with\nprediagnosed hypertension along with persons who were\ndiscovered to be hypertensive in the surveys, not only to\nmaximize cell size but also because including them biased\nthe data towards the null value or had no effect. For men,\nChinese women, and non-Hispanic Black women, persons\nwith prediagnosed hypertension had higher BMIs, thereby\nincreasing the strength of the association between hyperten-\nsion and BMI in each of the ethnic groups. However,\nthe impact of including persons with prediagnosed\nhypertension in China was minimal, because the\nproportion of prediagnosed individuals was very low (6.4\ncompared with non-Hispanic Whites). Thus, differences\nobserved between non-Hispanic Whites and Chinese are\nlikely to be conservative estimates of the true association\nbetween newly diagnosed hypertension and BMI. For non-\nHispanic White and Filipino women, there were no signifi-\ncant differences in mean BMI between hypertensive persons\nwho had been prediagnosed and those who were discovered\nto be hypertensive during the surveys. Including prediag-\nnosed individuals simply shifted the prevalence of hyper-\ntension upward, and strength-of-association comparisons\nbetween the ethnic groups were unaffected.\nIn each survey, height was measured in centimeters while\nthe participant stood without shoes, and weight was mea-\nsured in kilograms while the participant stood without shoes\nand in light clothing. BMI was calculated as weight in kilo-\ngrams over height in meters squared. Waist circumference\nwas measured in centimeters at the midpoint between the\nbottom of the ribs and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circum-\nference was measured at the largest posterior extension of\nthe buttocks.\nData from the three surveys were pooled. All analyses\nwere stratified by gender and ethnic group. Ethnicity was\nself-defined in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey and geographically defined in the\nChina Health and Nutrition Survey and the Cebu\nLongitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. The data were\nnot weighted because the two Asian surveys were not\ndesigned to be nationally representative.\nTwo statistical methods were used to compare the associ-\nation between BMI and hypertension across ethnic groups.\nFirst, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of\nprevalent hypertension across a range of BMI categories\nas the referent category. We then constructed a pooled model\nthat included ethnicity and interaction terms between ethnic-\nity and BMI categories to examine ethnic differences. There\nare a number of factors that may confound the relation\nbetween BMI and hypertension. In preliminary analysis, we\ntested for confounding of this association by physical activ-\nity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption within each\nethnic group. For all of the gender/ethnicity subgroup mod-\nels, the only group for which the BMI cutoff coefficients\nchanged in any meaningful manner was non-Hispanic Black\nwomen. Even for this group, however, the  coefficients did\nnot change more than 10 percent, and the significance of the\nBMI-hypertension association was not changed. Thus, only\nage, as a continuous variable in the range 30\u00ad65 years, was\ncontrolled for in the models. Second, we examined the age-\nadjusted prevalence of hypertension across the BMI cate-\ngories and calculated prevalence differences. Statistical\nsignificance was accepted at p < 0.05, and all analyses were\ncarried out using Stata software, version 7.0 (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nCompared with the US ethnic groups, Chinese men and\nwomen had a lower prevalence of hypertension and over-\nweight. Filipino women were less overweight but more\nhypertensive than non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican\nAmericans. After adjustment for age differences between\nthe ethnic groups, Chinese men had a significantly lower\n(p < 0.001) mean systolic blood pressure than each of the\nUS ethnic groups and a significantly lower mean diastolic\nblood pressure than non-Hispanic Blacks (table 1). Chinese\nmen were also significantly less hypertensive ( p < 0.001),\nand those who were hypertensive were less likely to be on\nantihypertension medication. They had a significantly lower\noverweight and obesity (BMI  25), and less central adipos-\nity (p < 0.001 for waist circumference and waist:hip ratio).\nA similar pattern was observed for Chinese women,\nalthough they had a higher mean diastolic blood pressure\n( p < 0.001) than non-Hispanic White and Mexican-\nAmerican women (table 2). There was no difference in\nmean blood pressure between Chinese and Filipino women\n(p  0.941), but Filipino women had a significantly higher\ndiastolic blood pressure ( p < 0.001) that was similar to that\nfor non-Hispanic Blacks. Filipino women were more hyper-\ntensive than Chinese, non-Hispanic White, and Mexican-\nAmerican women, and, in comparison with Chinese women,\na much higher proportion of Filipino hypertensive women\nwere on antihypertension medication ( p < 0.001). They\nwere intermediate between Chinese and US women with\nrespect to overweight prevalence but no different from\nChinese women in terms of central adiposity ( p  0.976).\nThere were also differences in hypertension and body\nmass between the US ethnic groups. In brief, non-Hispanic\nBlacks were more likely to be hypertensive and to receive\nmedication for their hypertension compared with non-\nHispanic Whites and Mexican Americans. Non-Hispanic\nBlack men were less obese (BMI  30) than Mexican-\nAmerican men, but non-Hispanic Black women had the\nhighest obesity prevalence of all the ethnic groups.\nThe odds of prevalent hypertension increased more\nsteeply with higher BMIs for Chinese men in comparison\nwith non-Hispanic Whites. Chinese men in the BMI range\nodds ratios for Mexican-American, non-Hispanic White,\nand non-Hispanic Black men were 1.23 (95 percent CI:\npercent CI: 0.86, 2.22), respectively. Adjusting for waist:hip\nratio attenuated the ethnic differences but did not eliminate\nthem. Among women, the odds of hypertension for Chinese\nand Filipino women did not differ significantly from the\nodds for non-Hispanic White women at low levels of BMI\n(figure 2). However, the odds of hypertension increased\nquite steeply for Chinese women with BMIs above 27, to a\nlevel that was not matched by non-Hispanic Whites until\nattainment of BMI levels around 30.

Our data add to evidence suggesting that the curve is\nsteeper in Chinese populations. Ko et al. (8) found that the\noptimal BMI cutoff for predicting hypertension in Hong Kong\nChinese was 23.8, which is considerably lower than the cutoff\nof 25 recommended for Caucasian populations. Optimal cut-\noffs for type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria were\nalso lower than 25. A study from Japan noted that the risk of\nhypertension for persons with BMIs greater than or equal to\n25 was twice that of persons with BMIs of 22 (7); this is a\nhigher risk than has been observed for Caucasians. However,\nwe could not provide evidence to suggest that the association\nbetween hypertension and BMI is stronger in Filipinos.\nTo explain why these ethnic differences in the strength of\nthe BMI-hypertension association exist, we need to consider\ngenetically determined differences in body composition and\nmetabolic response, as well as clustering of risk factors due\nto differences in social and environmental factors (Bell et\nal., unpublished manuscript). East Asian populations are\nknown to have greater levels of total body fat and abdomi-\nnal body fat at lower levels of BMI than Caucasians.\nDeurenberg et al. (10) have observed ethnic differences in\nBMI at similar levels of percentage of body fat. They found\nChinese, Indonesian, and Thai populations to have BMI val-\nues that were 1.9, 3.2, and 2.9 BMI units lower than those of\nCaucasians (American, Australian, and European Whites\nanalyzed as one group) with a similar percentage of body\nfat. The distribution of body fat may also differ between eth-\nnic groups. For example, Asian Indians have been found to\nhave more abdominal fat than Caucasians (27). In this study,\nadjustment for waist:hip ratio only slightly attenuated the\ndifferences between racial/ethnic groups, and waist:BMI\nratio (centimeters of waist circumference per unit of BMI)\nwas very similar for Chinese men (3.5 cm per BMI unit) and\nwomen (3.4 cm per BMI unit) as compared with non-\nHispanic White men (3.6 cm/unit) and women (3.2 cm/unit),\nrespectively. One mechanism through which body fat is\nthought to influence hypertension is increased insulin resis-\ntance. Body fat, particularly abdominal fat, may lead to an\nincrease in fatty acids in the portal blood vessels, enhancing\ninsulin resistance and leading to the development of hyper-\ntension and other metabolic complications (28, 29). It is also\npossible that Asian populations are more insulin-resistant\nthan Caucasian populations for reasons other than increased\nresults of a series of studies which showed that relative risk\nof insulin resistance and adult-onset diabetes is high in\nAsians and Hispanics compared with Caucasians.\nSocioeconomic and cultural factors may also contribute\nto these ethnic differences. The prevalence patterns reveal\nconsiderable underlying variation in hypertension preva-\nlence. Stress and/or other unmeasured risk factors, such as\nacculturation in the case of Mexican Americans, may play\nan important role in determining this underlying variation.\nIn other work, we found that unmeasured or poorly mea-\nsured risk factors associated with socioeconomic status were\nmore strongly associated with hypertension in US women\nthan obesity, physical activity, and alcohol consumption\n(Bell et al., unpublished manuscript). A direct comparison of\nsocioeconomic status was not possible in this study of pop-\nulations from countries at different stages of development.\nOur analysis of the relation between BMI and hyperten-\nsion was complicated by differences in the baseline preva-\nlence of hypertension between ethnic groups. The odds ratio\nanalysis obscured these differences by assuming that the\nodds of hypertension were identical for each of the ethnic\ngroups in the referent BMI category. This is potentially mis-\nleading, because it enhanced the odds of hypertension with\nincreasing BMI among Chinese men and women and dimin-\nished the odds of hypertension with increasing BMI among\nFilipino women and non-Hispanic Blacks. The prevalence\ndifference analysis allowed for differences in baseline\nprevalence but in this case did not lead to different conclu-\nsions regarding Chinese men and women. Prevalence differ-\nences tell a different story for non-Hispanic Blacks,\nhowever. They may in fact be at greater risk of hypertension\nwith increasing BMI than non-Hispanic Whites, rather than\nat lower risk as the odds ratios suggested. Filipino women\nmay also be at greater risk, but there was no evidence of a\ngreater prevalence difference between the BMI categories\ninterest.\nThis study was limited by the use of cross-sectional data.\nTo truly test for differences in risk of hypertension with\nincreasing BMI, one would need to monitor people from\nthese populations over time. In preliminary analyses, we\ntested physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking\nas potential confounders of the BMI-hypertension associa-\ntion. These factors did not appear to be confounders, but the\nvariables were not identical between the ethnic groups (i.e.,\nwe used work-related physical activity in China and leisure-\ntime physical activity in the United States).\nFinally, blood pressure is somewhat sensitive to salt\nintake, and we did not have adequate measures of salt con-\nsumption in any of the populations. Compared with the US\npopulation, the Chinese and Filipino populations probably\nhave lower salt intakes, and inconsistent associations\nbetween BMI and blood pressure have been found in popu-\nlations with low salt intakes (33). However, this study and\nother recent studies have shown strong associations (34).\nShould there be lower cutoffs to define overweight and\nobesity status for Asian populations? Our data suggest that\nthe new Asian BMI cutoff values are appropriate for Chinese\nmen and women, on the basis of a stronger association\nbetween BMI and hypertension in comparison with Whites,\nand possibly for Filipino women, on the basis of a high base-\nline prevalence. Moreover, these data provide some evidence\nthat the association between BMI and hypertension and\nunderlying prevalence varies within US ethnic groups. The\nutility of having a single international weight classification\nbased on BMI is the ability to compare populations and mon-\nitor changes over time using a simple measure. At this level,\nwe do not see the advantage of having a separate classifica-\ntion for Asians, particularly if it does not apply to all Asians.\nIn addition, \"Asian\" ethnicity is very difficult to define. In a\nclinical setting, however, the value of ethnicity-specific BMI\ncutoffs can readily be seen. They would enable clinicians to\nEthnic Differences in the BMI-  Relation 353\nmore appropriately identify individuals at increased risk of\nhypertension and other comorbid conditions. Further\nresearch is needed to test the utility of ethnicity-specific BMI\ncutoffs for defining obesity in clinical settings.\n"
