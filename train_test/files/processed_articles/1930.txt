    "reduced_content": "Health Care Finance and Policy\nestimated that only 2.7% of state\nresidents remained uninsured as\nmakers have turned to Massa-\nchusetts as a potential model for\nfederal health care reform, and\nreform proposals recently put for-\nward in Congress include elements\nfrom the Massachusetts plan, such\nas the individual mandate to buy\ninsurance, public-program expan-\nsions, and a health insurance ex-\nchange.\nDespite the state's low percent-\nage of uninsured residents, na-\ntional reviews of the Massachu-\nsetts reform have been mixed,\nespecially in recent months. Al-\nthough some reports have drawn\nattention to the state's insurance\ngains and indicated that health\ncare costs, though growing, have\nnot exceeded early projections or\nexpectations, others have argued\nthat high costs and some report-\ned problems with access to care\nshould be taken as warnings of\nthe problems the country might\nface if a similar reform were im-\nplemented nationally. For exam-\nple, Michael Tanner of the Cato\nInstitute has called the Massa-\nchusetts reform \"unsustainable\"\nbecause of its \"failure to restrain\nthe growth in health care costs\"\nand the fact that it has \"set the\nstage for . . . price controls and\nexplicit rationing.\"3 Similarly, a\nMassachusetts reform on the blog\nof John Boehner of Ohio, the Re-\npublican leader in the U.S. House\nof Representatives, said that \"out\nof control costs\" and \"rationing\"\nhave been consequences of uni-\nversal coverage in Massachusetts.\nWe know from previous re-\nsearch that the Massachusetts\npublic is favorable toward the\nstate's legislation,4 but physicians\ncan provide critical insight into\nhow the law is actually function-\ning and how it has affected ac-\ncess to high-quality health care.\nIn previous studies, Massachu-\nsetts physicians have been inter-\nviewed about their experiences\nwith and impressions of other\nreform issues, such as managed\ncare and a potential single-payer\nhealth care system, but only one\npoll to date has asked physicians\nabout Massachusetts health care\nreform.

Its results suggest that re-\nform in Massachusetts is putting\npressure on emergency room ca-\npacity.5 In a poll we conducted\nwith support from the Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation and\nthe Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mas-\nsachusetts Foundation, we turned\nto physicians in Massachusetts\nmore broadly to assess their per-\nceptions in three areas: their over-\nall support for the legislation,\ntheir views of its effect on their\nown practice, and their views of\nits effect on health care through-\nout the state.

The lev-\nels of support among primary\ncare doctors and among special-\nists were similar. When asked\nabout the law's future, 75% in-\ndicated that they want the law\nto remain in place -- 46% with\nsome changes, and 29% as is.\nPhysicians' Views of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law -- A Poll\nPoll Methods\nStudy Design and Fielding\nThe poll was designed and analyzed by a team of researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. The fielding process was coordinated\nby an independent survey research firm, Social Science Research Solutions.\nSources of Data\nThe data are from a randomized poll of 2135 Massachusetts physicians. Researchers obtained a random sample of physicians practicing in\nMassachusetts from the SK&A database, which is a comprehensive list of physicians based on published association and trade directo-\nries as well as federal and state license files. Information in the directory is updated and verified every 6 months.\nPhysicians were invited to participate in the study by means of a mailed letter and were offered an incentive ranging from $50 to $100 for\ncompleting the poll. The incentive amount was determined by the physician's specialty, as is standard practice in polls of physicians. All\nrespondents were offered the opportunity to complete the poll by mail, Internet, or telephone; all chose mail or Internet.\nPoll Questions\nA complete list of questions asked as part of the poll is available in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at\nNEJM.org.\nData Collection and Statistical Analysis\nThe poll was conducted from August 11 to September 15, 2009. This period was chosen to help ensure the relevance of the data to the na-\ntional debate on health care reform. Congress had originally been expected to vote on a health care reform bill in October 2009. The peri-\nod was short to ensure that we captured views during a relatively uniform period that was less likely than a longer period to be interrupt-\ned by changes in the environment, such as media reports on the issue, that might affect physicians' views differentially over time. We is-\nsued a higher number of initial mailings and predicted a lower response rate than in longer-term surveys, and we used weighting tech-\nniques to ensure that the final responses reflect the views of the overall physician population. This approach is similar to standard tech-\nniques for polls of the public. It has been shown to be more accurate than surveys of the public with longer field times for issues that are\nsensitive to changes in media coverage, such as election campaigns. Independent studies have shown that statistically weighting the\ndata for known population variables reduces the effects of a lower response rate.1,2\nMore physicians wanted to participate in the poll than we had expected, so we allowed those who wanted to complete the poll after the\ndeadline to submit their responses with the understanding that they would not be provided with an incentive. We compared the demo-\ngraphic profiles of those who responded within the window when incentives were offered to the profiles of the full sample and to the pro-\nfiles of all physicians in Massachusetts. We found few differences in either comparison, although both of our samples include a smaller\nfraction of medical subspecialists than the population of Massachusetts physicians does. We also compared responses to a key substan-\ntive question (whether the respondent supports or opposes the legislation) between our two samples and did not find a significant dif-\nference in the level of support for the legislation.\nTo ensure that we used a representative sample, our analysis weighted the final sample to reflect the composition of Massachusetts physi-\ncians. Characteristics included in the weighting were specialty, regional location, and setting of practice (urban, suburban, or rural).\nWhen interpreting our findings, it is important to recognize that all polls are subject to sampling error, and results may differ from what\nmight have been found if all physicians in Massachusetts had been polled. The sampling error for this poll is \u00b11.9 percentage points.\nPossible sources of nonsampling error also include nonresponse bias and effects of the wording and ordering of the questions. As calcu-\nlated with the use of a standard of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the response rate was 28%.\nIn comparing responses among subgroups of physicians, we used t-tests that accounted for the weighting of the data. All reported P values\nare based on two-sided tests.\nYeager DS, Krosnick JA, Chang LC, et al.

About one quarter of\nphysicians reported negative ef-\nfects in the overall cost of care\nfor patients, their financial situ-\nation, and the amount of time pa-\ntients wait for an appointment.\nAs for the broader effects on\nthe state, 3 years after implemen-\ntation of the law, Massachusetts\nphysicians rate the state's health\ncare system positively. Nearly twice\nas many physicians rate the Mas-\nsachusetts system for providing\nmedical care as excellent or good\nas rate the national system that\nIn this section of the poll, we\nalso asked physicians to assess\nthe impact of the law on health\ncare in the state as a whole. We\nqueried them about 10 aspects\nof health care in Massachusetts\nthat might be affected by the law.\nTable 3 shows the responses in\ndescending order of the number\nof negative responses. In 9 of\nthese 10 aspects, a majority or\nplurality said that the law either\ndid not have much of an effect\nor was having a positive effect\non the situation in the state. For\nexample, more than three quar-\nters of physicians (79%) believed\nthe law was positively affecting\npeople who had not had health\ninsurance before the law went\ninto effect. The second most pos-\nitively affected aspect was the\nquality of care in Massachusetts\n(with 37% reporting that the law\nwas helping). The one feature of\nthe law's impact that received\nnegative evaluations from a ma-\njority of physicians (53%) con-\ncerned the overall cost of care in\nthe state. The next most negative-\nly affected aspect was patients'\nability to see a primary care pro-\nvider (with 34% reporting that\nthe law was hurting that), although\nnearly as many physicians re-\nported that the law was helping\nof physicians said they did not\nknow what effect the law was\nhaving on each of five areas: the\noverall cost of care in Massachu-\nsetts, the cost that Massachusetts\npatients pay, primary care prac-\ntices, hospitals, and specialty\npractices.\nMassachusetts has the lowest\nproportion of uninsured residents\nin the United States. Our results\nshow that there is widespread\nsupport among Bay State physi-\ncians for the law that led to this\nhigh level of coverage. At the same\ntime, physicians believe that it has\ncontributed to some problems with\nhealth care in the state.\nExamination of physicians'\nviews on care for their patients\nprovides little evidence to sup-\nport criticisms that the law is\nnegatively affecting the quality of\ncare that most physicians deliver.\nWith regard to their own prac-\ntices, a sizable minority of physi-\ncians indicate that the legislation\nhas increased their administrative\nburden.\nPhysicians' views concerning\nthe effect of the law on the state's\nhealth care environment are more\nmixed. Most believe it is helping\nthe formerly uninsured, but that\npositive view is coupled with a\nmajority belief that the program\nis driving up the cost of health\ncare in the state. In addition, phy-\nsicians are divided about whether\nit has imposed pressures on the\nstate's primary care capacity.\nTaken together, these findings\nsuggest that it is possible both\nto provide near-universal coverage\nof the population and to have a\nsystem that most physicians be-\nlieve improves care for the unin-\nsured without undermining their\nability to provide care to their pa-\ntients.
