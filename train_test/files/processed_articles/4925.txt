Although\nthe pathological mechanism of migraine is\nunclear, evidence suggests inflammation\nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a key\ncytokine involved in inflammatory reactions\nand inflammation-related hyperalgesia.5\nTNF may play a pivotal role in migraine\nvia activation of meningeal nociceptors,\nreducing threshold cerebral excitability and\npropagating neuronal hyperexcitability.6,7\nThe TNF superfamilies (TNFSF) and TNF\nreceptor superfamilies (TNFRSF) have\nextensive actions in cell differentiation and\nsurvival, and in controlling expression of\ninflammatory cytokines.8 TNFSF/TNFRSF\ngene polymorphisms have now been re-\ncported in migraine. These include TNF-\nshown to exert therapeutic efficacy for\ninflammatory diseases in experimental\nanimal models,13 suggesting a role in the\nprogression of inflammation. TNFSF10\npolymorphisms are also correlated with\ncancer susceptibility,14,15 but there is no\ndirect evidence that TNFSF10 polymorph-\nism is associated with migraine.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate\nthe correlation between migraine in a Chinese\npopulation and a 4 base pair (GAGT) inser-\nlocalized near the 3' end of TNFSF10.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study enrolled unrelated ethnically Han\nChinese patients with migraine, attending\nthe Neurological Outpatient Service, First\nAffiliated Hospital of Soochow University,\nSuzhou, China, for diagnosis or follow-up\nMigraine was diagnosed and classified\naccording to the International Classification\nof Headache Disorders-II criteria, as recom-\nmended by the International Headache\nSociety.16 Ethnically Han Chinese control\nsubjects were recruited from individuals\ncompleting a nutritional survey in the same\ngeographical area as the patients. Subjects\nwith migraine, a family history of migraine,\nor any severe or recurrent headache in direct\nrelatives were excluded. Data regarding\ntobacco use (more than one cigarette per\nday for >1 year) and alcohol use (at least one\nalcoholic drink per week) were recorded for\npatients and control subjects.\nThe ethics committee of Soochow\nUniversity, Suzhou, China approved the\nstudy, and all subjects provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nGenotyping\nPeripheral blood (3 ml) was taken from each\nsubject and stored at \u00ad20 until use. DNA\nwas extracted from whole blood17 and poly-\nmerase chain reaction (PCR) for TNFSF10\nwas carried out as described.18 Primer\nsequences were: forward 50- GGC\nPCR cycling conditions were 94C for\nfinal extension step at 72C for 5 min. PCR\nproducts were separated by 7% nondenatur-\ning polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and\nvisualized by silver staining. Genotype was\ndetermined by number and size of bands on\nthe gel. In order to confirm the reproduci-\nbility of PCR genotyping, 10% of samples\nwere randomly selected and re-examined by\nanother technician.\nStatistical analyses\nHardy\u00adWeinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was\nanalysed by 2-test. Between-group com-\nparisons of genotypic and allelic distribution\nwere made by 2-test. Logistic regression\nanalysis (adjusted for sex, age, alcohol and\ntobacco use, and clinical characteristics) was\nconducted to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the\nmigraine risk. All statistical analyses were\ntwo-sided and performed using SAS statis-\ntical software, version 8.0 (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC, USA). P-values 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 269 patients with migraine\nThere were no significant between-group\ndifferences in age, sex distribution, tobacco\npatient group are shown in Table 1.\nRepeat PCR confirmed that PCR geno-\ntyping was 100% reproducible. Genotype\nfrequency was in HWE, in patients and in\ncontrol subjects. Data regarding allele\nand genotype frequencies are presented\nin Table 2. There were no statistically\nsignificant between-group differences in\nallele or genotype distribution, with or\nwithout adjustment for sex, age, tobacco\nand alcohol use.\nResults of stratification analysis for the\npatient group are shown in Table 3. There\nwere no significant differences in allele or\ngenotype distribution when patients were\nstratified by sex, age of disease onset, family\nhistory of migraine or migraine type.\nDiscussion\nOur study found no association between\ngenotype or allele distribution of the\nand migraine in Chinese patients with\nmigraine.\nMigraine is a primary headache disorder\nwith an unclear pathogenesis, although\nevidence suggests that $ 40% of migraine\nsusceptibility is due to multiple genetic\nfactors.19,20 Studies support the involvement\nof proinflammatory cytokines (especially\nTNF) in migraine.21,22 Our earlier study\nrevealed a relationship between TNFRSF1B\npolymorphism and an augmented risk of\nmigraine.12 TNFSF10 is involved in acute\nand chronic inflammatory central nervous\nsystem disorders23 and has many functions\nin the peripheral and central nervous system,\nincluding cell death and immune modula-\ntion.24 There is no evidence for a correlation\nTable 1.
