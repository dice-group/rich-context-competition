    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite widespread agreement that physicians who practice\ndefensive medicine drive up health care costs, the extent to which\ndefensive medicine increases costs is unclear. The differences in findings\nto date stem in part from the use of two distinct approaches for assessing\nphysicians' perceived malpractice risk. In this study we used an\nalternative strategy: We linked physicians' responses regarding their levels\nof malpractice concern as reported in the 2008 Health Tracking\nPhysician Survey to Medicare Parts A and B claims for the patients they\ntreated during the study period, 2007\u00ad09. We found that physicians who\nreported a high level of malpractice concern were most likely to engage\nin practices that would be considered defensive when diagnosing patients\nwho visited their offices with new complaints of chest pain, headache, or\nlower back pain. No consistent relationship was seen, however, when\nstate-level indicators of malpractice risk replaced self-rated concern.\nReducing defensive medicine may require approaches focused on\nphysicians' perceptions of legal risk and the underlying factors driving\nthose perceptions.\nThere is widespread consensus that\nphysicians alter their behavior to\nreduce their malpractice liability,\nbut there is considerable disagree-\nment about the magnitude of costs,\nharms, andpotentialbenefits associatedwith the\npractice of such defensive medicine.1 Prior stud-\nies have produced conflicting findings, creating\nconfusion for policy makers.2\nIn this article we explain why existing studies\nhave not been able to provide conclusive infor-\nmation about the extent of defensive medicine.\nWe also present a new analysis that combines the\ngreatest strengths of the available approaches\nwhile avoiding some of their weaknesses. Link-\ning physicians' survey responses with their pa-\ntients' Medicare claims, we examined whether\nphysicians' self-reported level of malpractice\nconcern was associated with their patients' use\nof diagnostic imaging services and other tests,\nemergency department (ED) visits, and hospital\nadmissions.\nOur analysis examined assurance behaviors\n(sometimes called positive defensive medicine),\nwhich include a physician's ordering additional\ntests, procedures, or visits and reducing his or\nher threshold for hospitalizing patients or refer-\nring them to other physicians. Another type of\ndefensive medicine is avoidance (or negative)\nbehaviors--such as physicians' taking steps to\navoid treating patients or conditions perceived\nto represent high legal risk.3 Although avoidance\nbehaviors have troubling implications for pa-\ntients' access to care, policy makers tend to be\nmore concerned about assurance behaviors be-\ncause they contribute to escalating national\nhealth care costs.2\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nEmily R.

Opinion surveys typically query physi-\ncians about their assurance behaviors when\npresented with specific clinical vignettes or sce-\nnarios; researchers subsequently examine corre-\nlations between the physicians' self-described\ndecisions in these hypothetical scenarios and\nvarious measures of liability risk, usually mal-\npractice insurance premiums or tort-reform laws\nin a state.3\u00ad5 In contrast, we used a validated\nsurvey instrument included in a national survey\nof physicians who provided direct patient care,6\nand we linked the physicians' responses regard-\ning their levels of malpractice concern to Medi-\ncare claims for the patients they treated during\nthe study period.\nComparing claims for physicians who report\nhigh levels of concern about malpractice to\nclaims for those who report less concern pro-\nvides a better, more objective comparison of the\ntwo groups' practice behavior in response to the\nmalpractice environment than using the results\nof opinion surveys alone. On surveys, physicians\nmay sometimes exaggerate their responses to\nquestions that assess liability pressure, possibly\nto help make the case for malpractice policy re-\nforms. Alternatively, physicians may be unable\nto discriminate between the effects of liability\npressure and those of otherfactors thatinfluence\ntheir decisions to order extra services, such\nas patients' expectations and reimbursement\nincentives.\nLinking claims data to a physician survey also\navoids an important limitation of many claims-\nbased studies: reliance on the absence or pres-\nence of tort reforms or high malpractice insur-\nance premiums in the state where a particular\nphysician practices as a proxy for that physi-\ncian's propensity to practice defensively. Studies\nusing this approach have found small effects of\ndefensive medicine on costs, typically less than\n2 percent of total spending.7\u00ad9 Studies that focus\non specific high-risk specialties and patients\nhave found larger effects.10,11 It is difficult to\ndefinitively conclude that differences in care\nuse across geographic areas are attributable to\ndifferences in liability pressure, as opposed to\nother factors.\nAdditionally, these studies rarely incorporate\ndirect measures of an individual physician's per-\nsonal assessment of his or her malpractice risk,\nrelying instead on state-level measures. In earlier\nwork we found state measures of malpractice\nrisk and specific malpractice tort laws to be only\nweakly associated with physicians' fears of mal-\npractice suits,6 providing a possible explanation\nfor the small estimates of the cost of defensive\nmedicine in claims-based studies.\nHypotheses\nWe hypothesized that physicians with high levels\nof malpractice concern would be more likely\nthan others to order tests and procedures or\nrefer patients to other providers to rule out the\nmost worrisome potential diagnoses, all other\nfactors being held equal. Of note, we would\nnot expect malpractice-sensitive physicians to\nuse more of all types of services for patients with\nall symptoms, because some services play little\nrole in the diagnosis of potentially worrisome\nconditions. Instead, we would expect those\nphysicians to increase their use of specific ser-\nvices to either diagnose or rule out severe con-\nditions as causes of the symptoms in question,\nwithout changing their use of other services.\nFor reasons described below, we chose to ex-\namine the use of services for patients visiting\nphysicians with complaints of chest pain, head-\nache, or lower back pain.\nFor chest pain patients not initially seen in the\nED, we expected malpractice-sensitive physi-\ncians to use more conventional and more ad-\nvanced imaging and to be more likely to have\ntheir patients visit the ED or be admitted to\nthe hospital, compared to their less sensitive\npeers. We expected that the use of stress testing\nmight be inversely associated with malpractice\nconcern, if physicians with lower levels of con-\ncern were more likely to use this test to assess\npatients' risk in lieu of hospitalizing them. For\nheadache, we expected malpractice-sensitive\nphysicians to use more advanced imaging and\nED referrals, but not more hospital admissions\nor conventional imaging. For lower back pain,\nwe expected malpractice-sensitive physicians to\nuse more conventional imaging and more ad-\nvanced imaging, and possibly more ED referrals,\nbut not more hospital admissions.\nWe found that higher levels of malpractice con-\ncern were indeed associated with significantly\nhigher use of diagnostic services when the com-\nparison employed self-reported levels of mal-\npractice concern. However, that relationship\nwas not observed when state-level measures of\nrisk wereused instead. This finding suggests that\ncomparisons between states that have differing\nmalpractice environments might not detect the\npresence of defensive medicine.\nPhysician Office Practice\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Survey sampling\nweights were applied to the beneficiary sample\nto make it nationally representative.13\nMeasures Of Physicians' Malpractice\nConcerns The Health Tracking Physician Sur-\nvey included five previously validated questions\nregarding physicians' fears of malpractice law-\nsuits and their propensity to engage in positive\ndefensive medicine.14\u00ad16 These questions are\nshown in online Appendix Table A1.17 Each ques-\ntion elicits physicians' responses on a five-point\nLikert scale that ranges from \"strongly agree\" to\n\"strongly disagree.\" We calculated physicians'\noverall level of malpractice concern by summing\nthe scores for the five questions, and we then\nclassified physicians into terciles based on their\ntotal scores. An alternative specification based\non questions directly focused on defensive medi-\ncine yielded similar results (see Appendix\nTable A2). Further information about the physi-\ncian sample is available in Appendix Table A3.17\nTo further investigate which measures of mal-\npractice risk best explain variations in the use of\ncare, we compared findings from our survey-\nbased index of malpractice concern to those\nfrom similar analyses based on state-level indica-\ntors of malpractice risk that have been used in\nprior claims-based comparisons. The first state\nvariable was a risk index, defined as malpractice\nclaims per 1,000 physicians times the average\ndollar amount of the award.18 The second was\na binary variable indicating whether the state\ncapped malpractice awards (noneconomic, pu-\nnitive, or total damages). Caps on damages are\noften touted as a key mechanism for controlling\ndefensive medicine.19 This step allowed a com-\nparison between the estimates of defensive\nmedicine based on a comparison of claims from\ndifferent states and the estimates from our com-\nparative approach.\nMeasures Of Defensive Medicine We exam-\nined three measures of potentially defensive\nmedicine that could occureitherduring an initial\nvisit to a physician's office--rather than the ED--\nfor a worrisome complaint or within the week\nfollowing the visit. Specifically, we noted\nwhether the patient received certain diagnostic\nimaging services or other tests, was referred to\nthe ED, or was admitted to a hospital. As previ-\nously noted, we analyzed patients who visited a\nphysician with an initial complaint of one of the\nfollowing threesymptoms: chestpain, headache,\nor lower back pain. These three common symp-\ntoms werechosen because they represent a range\nof potential underlying problems, from mild and\nbenign to severe and life threatening (see\nAppendix Figure A1 for details)17 and because\nphysicians have considerable discretion in re-\nsponding to these complaints.\nSymptoms were indicated in claims using\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision (ICD-9), diagnostic codes. The initial\nvisits we considered took place between July 1,\nfied when claims data indicated that during the\nprevious eighteen months, the patient had nei-\nther received any services for the same or a re-\nlated diagnosis nor had a diagnosis for another\ncondition that would justify the diagnostic\ntest or service in question. Details on the in-\ncluded and excluded diagnoses are provided in\nAppendix Tables A4 and A5; unadjusted results\nare available in Appendix Tables A6 and A7.17\nResults were insensitive to the length of the ob-\nservation period following the initial visit.\nAnalysis Using logistic regression, we related\nservice use during and after the initial visit to the\nphysician's level of malpractice concern,control-\nling for beneficiary and physician characteris-\ntics. Specifically, our models controlled for\nbeneficiaries' demographic characteristics,20 co-\nmorbid conditions,21 and urbanicity of resi-\ndence, as well as the specialty of the physician\nat the initial visit. Full regression results are\nsults are presented as adjusted percentages, by\ntercile of malpractice concern.\nWe stratified our analyses by whether the ini-\ntial visit was to an ED or a physician's office.We\nfound that service use was dramatically higher\nwhen the initial visit was to an ED (see Appendix\nTable 6).17 For example, subsequent hospitaliza-\ntions were fifteen to twenty-six times more likely\nfor chest pain and lower back pain, respectively,\nwhich suggests that patients seen initially in EDs\nhave very different clinical profiles than those\nwho visit physicians' offices instead. Moreover,\ndiagnostic testing equipment is more readily\navailable in the ED. In addition, emergency\nmedicine physicians report higher rates of mal-\npractice concern than other physicians do.6\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As a result,\nresidual confounding could have biased our uti-\nlization results.\nIn addition, our sample included only patients\nwho were diagnosed with a relatively benign\ncause of the presenting symptom and those for\nwhom no underlying cause was identified (for\nexample, chest pain of unknown origin).We ex-\ncluded patients who were assigned a serious or\nlife-threatening diagnosis. For example, patients\nwith a diagnosis of nonspecific headache were\nincluded, but those diagnosed with subarach-\nnoid hemorrhage were excluded. We excluded\npatients with serious, definitive diagnoses be-\ncause we expected that they would have been\nseen by multiple other physicians whose level\nof malpractice concern was not measured.\nBecause physicians with high malpractice con-\ncern might be expected to conduct a more ag-\ngressive diagnostic evaluation initially, any bias\ncreated by this choice would tend to under-\nestimate the use differences between physicians\nwith high and low levels of malpractice concern.\nAppendix Figure A117 describes the range of\nhealth conditions that might be associated with\nthe three symptoms and the types of tests used\nto diagnose these conditions in our analysis\nsample.\nStudy Results\nBeneficiary And Visit Characteristics Of the\nnearly 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries in our\ninitial visit for one of the three symptoms in a\nphysician's office or an ED (Exhibit 1). The sub-\nsamples differed only modestly from each other\nin patients' demographic and health character-\nistics and in characteristics of the state's mal-\npractice environment (Exhibit 1).17 Some bene-\nficiaries with initial visits were missing data used\nin the statistical adjustment and thus are not\nrepresented in the adjusted samples.\nWhen we focused on services provided to pa-\ntients whose initial visit was to a physician's of-\nfice, we found that rates of hospitalization and\nreferral to the ED were generally low (Exhibit 2).\nRates of diagnostic tests were also low, with the\nexception of conventional imaging forchest pain\nand lower back pain, supplemental testing\n(stress tests) for chest pain, and advanced imag-\ning for headache.\nSelf-Reported Malpractice Concern And\nDefensive Medicine Patients with chest pain\nhad a significantly higher probability of being\nreferred to the ED if their physician had a high\nor medium level of malpractice concern, com-\npared to a low level (Exhibit 3; unadjusted per-\ncentages are shown in Appendix Table A6).17\nPhysicians with a high level of malpractice con-\ncern were significantly less likely than those with\na low level to order stress tests, consistent with\nour hypothesis that they would be less inclined to\nuse stress tests as a substitute for a more exten-\nsive inpatient workup. The hypothesized rela-\ntionships between higher malpractice concern\nand higher rates of advanced imaging and hos-\npitalization were observed but were not signifi-\ncant.\nPatients with headache who saw physicians\nwith a high level of malpractice concern had a\nsignificantly higher probability of receiving ad-\nvanced imaging than patients who saw physi-\ncians with a low level of concern--11.5 percent\nversus 6.4 percent (Exhibit 3). As expected, rates\nof conventional imaging and hospitalization\nwere extremely low for both groups and were\nnot significantly associated with the physician's\nlevel of malpractice concern. Contrary to our\nexpectations, there was no significant associa-\ntion between level of concern and referral to\nthe ED.\nPatients with lower back pain who saw physi-\ncians with a high level of malpractice concern\nhad a significantly higher probability of re-\nceiving conventional and advanced imaging\nthan patients seeing less-concerned physicians\n(Exhibit 3). There was no significant difference\nin their probability of hospitalization.\nState-Level Malpractice Risk And Defen-\nsive Medicine Only three significant associa-\ntions emerged in our models analyzing state-\nlevel malpractice risk as a predictor of services\nreceived by Medicare beneficiaries (Exhibit 4).\nTwo of these associations were in the opposite\ndirection from those in the malpractice-concern\nmodel--that is, use was lower in states with a\nhigher level of malpractice risk.\nModels using the presence of caps on damages\nrather than malpractice risk as the liability mea-\nsure indicated that caps were associated with\nthe greater use of some services (Appendix\ntive finding might reflect a problem of reverse\ncausality--that is, a high prevalence of mal-\npractice concern (and defensive medicine)\namong physicians might make a state more likely\nto adopt a damages cap.\nPhysician Office Practice\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, these\neffects were not observed when state-level mea-\nsures of malpractice risk were used in lieu of\nindividual physicians' reported concerns.\nCompared to office-based physicians who re-\nported a low level of concern about malpractice\nrisk, physicians who reported higher levels of\nconcern had higher rates of use of diagnostic\nimaging for lower back pain and headache.\nAlthough our analysis represents an initial effort\nto measure physicians' behavior, physicians' re-\nported levels of concern appeared more strongly\npredictive of their use of services than were state-\nlevel measures of malpractice risk in the ambu-\nlatory care setting. Office-based physicians with\nhigher levels of concern were more likely to or-\nder advanced imagingforpatients withheadache\nand lower back pain and conventional imaging\nfor patients with chest pain and lower back pain,\ncompared to physicians with low levels of con-\ncern. And compared to less-concerned physi-\ncians, more-concerned physicians were less\nlikely to use stress testing for patients with chest\npain and more likely to refer them to the ED,\nwhere a more extensive workup and observation\nwould likely be performed.\nInsights This study provides insights into the\nmagnitude of defensive medicine in the United\nStates. Most previous studies have focused on\nthe use of care in the hospital setting, especially\nobstetric care and the evaluation of patients in\nthe ED. Our study provides a rare look at what\nhappens in physicians' offices.\nIn addition, previous studies usually focused\non patients who constitute a relatively high\nliability risk.

In addi-\ntion, ED physicians often lack detailed medical\nrecords for their patients and thus face greater\nuncertainty than office-based physicians. In con-\ntrast, our nationally representative sample was\ncomposed of elderly patients who were initially\nseen in a physician's office. Although this is not a\ngroup that experts would identify as high risk\nfrom a liability perspective, the use of health\nservices was significantly greater in this group\nof patients if they were seen by physicians with\nhigher levels of concern about malpractice\nlawsuits.\nFurthermore, our study helps reconcile the\ndiscrepancy between prior estimates of the cost\nof defensive medicine based on physician sur-\nveys and those based on state-to-state compari-\nsons of defensive medicine.We found that asso-\nciations between malpractice risk and use of\nhealth services were much stronger when the\nrisk measure used was the physician's perceived\nrisk rather than objective, state-level measures of\nliability risk, such as claims costs or tort reforms.\nOur results suggest that prior cost estimates\nbased on comparisons between states with and\nwithout caps on damages or high malpractice\nrisk, malpractice premiums, or claims costs (in-\ncluding comparisons of variations in states over\ntime) may not reflect physicians' behavior or\nfully capture the influence of physicians' mal-\npractice concerns on defensive medicine.\nAlthough it is impossible to say which ap-\nproach captures the true prevalence of defensive\nAdjusted Percentages Of Likelihood That A Visit To A Physician's Office Resulted In Services During The Visit Or Within The Following 7 Days, By\nPhysician's Reported Level Of Malpractice Concern\nPhysician's concern level, by symptom\nService Low Med.

Linking survey reports\nof physicians' malpractice concern with claims\ndata offers a promising way to generate more-\naccurate estimates of defensive medicine.\nLack Of Clear Association We found no\nclear association between physicians' mal-\npractice concerns and the services their patients\nused when patients initially visited an ED instead\nof a physician's office. One possible explanation\nfor this finding is that emergency physicians\nhave incorporated defensive practices into their\nroutine care, so that even those who perceive\nthemselves to have low levels of malpractice con-\ncern already practice in a defensive manner.22\nIn addition, we did not observe a consistent\nrelationship between malpractice concern and\nthe use of diagnostic imaging in patients with\na new complaint of chest pain. This lack of asso-\nciation may indicate either that physicians do\nnot practice defensively for patients with chest\npain or that any defensive practices are obscured\nbecause a broader range of diagnostic ap-\nproaches and the involvement of multiple clini-\ncal services may be required to rule out poten-\ntially serious causes of this complaint.\nFinally, we did not observe a significant rela-\ntionship between outpatient physicians' mal-\npractice concern and ED use by their patients\nwith headache in the days following the physi-\ncian's initial evaluation. This may reflect the fact\nthat patients with the most severe headache\nsymptoms are more likely to go directly to an\nED instead of visiting a physician's office. Find-\nings for lower back pain were more consistent\nwith an association between physicians' concern\nand patients' ED use. Patients seen by a physi-\ncian with a medium level of concern were signifi-\ncantly more likely to visit the ED than were\npatients seen by a physician with a low level of\nconcern. Patients seen by a physician with a high\nlevel of concern were also more likely to visit the\nED, but that result was not significant.\nOvercoming Physicians' Fear Of Mal-\npractice Claims Previous comparisons of\nstates with and without tort reforms (such as\ncaps on damages, limits on attorney's fees, and\nreductions in the time that plaintiffs have to file a\nclaim) suggest that the presence of tort reforms\ndoes little to limit use of health care. This has led\nto inferences that the total cost of defensive\nmedicine is low.23 An alternative explanation,\nempirically supported by previous work, is that\nthe kinds of tort reforms that states have adopted\nto date do not appreciably reduce physicians'\nlevel of malpractice concern,6 and it is perceived\nrather than actual risk that determines how\nphysicians behave.\nPolicy approaches that target the underlying\ncauses of physicians' malpractice concerns\nmight reduce defensive medicine more effec-\ntively than current estimates suggest. Being sued\nis associated with substantial distress for physi-\ncians, but tort reforms are generally aimed at\nlowering the cost of eventual payouts to the ex-\nclusion of otherapproaches. Physicians' extreme\ndread of malpractice litigation may stem from\ntheir perception that it is unpredictable, un-\ncontrollable, and potentially disastrous both fi-\nnancially and psychologically.6\nTo some extent, this fear might be ameliorated\nsimply by better informing physicians about the\nactual dynamics of the malpractice claims proc-\ness. For example, prior studies show that physi-\ncians greatly overestimate their risk of being\nsued;24 the actual risk of facing a malpractice\nclaim in specialties such as emergency medicine\nmay not be any greater than the average risk for\nall physicians;25 only about one in fifty injuries\ncaused by negligence result in a claim;26 lawsuits\nare virtually never settled for amounts in excess\nof a physician's insurance policy limits (and thus\ninvolve little personal financial risk for physi-\ncians);27 claims are resolved in ways concordant\nwith their merit three-quarters of the time;28 and\nmalpractice plaintiffs lose four out of five trials.28\nPhysicians, most of whom are unaware of\nthese data, may have exaggerated perceptions\nof legal risk. However, our prior work,6 which\nfound that physicians' levels of malpractice fear\nare not substantially different in states with and\nwithout tort reforms, suggests that physicians'\nattitudes may be hard to align with their ac-\ntual risk.\nThis persistence in risk perceptions may,\nagain, reflect the dread involved in perceptions\nof this type of risk. The experience of being sued\nis undeniably distressing--it has been described\nReforms need to\nreassure physicians\nthat medical injuries\ncan be resolved\nexpeditiously and\nfairly, in a less\nadversarial manner.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reforms need to reassure physi-\ncians that medical injuries can be resolved\nexpeditiously and fairly, in a less adversarial\nmanner.\nTo achieve this goal, reforms need to facilitate\ncommunication between physicians and pa-\ntients about why adverse outcomes occurred;\nto explain, in some cases, that the standard of\ncare was met; to provide reasonable compensa-\ntion rapidly when it was not met; and to keep\ndisputes from escalating into full-blown litiga-\ntion. Several approaches are promising.23\nCommunication-and-resolution programs, in\nwhich health care institutions proactively dis-\nclose errors, apologize, and offer compensation\nbefore the patient files a claim, could reduce the\nnumbers and costs of lawsuits and speed the\nprocess of resolution. So could expanded use\nof mediation.\nAnother, farther-reaching reform would be to\nreplace litigation in the courts with an adminis-\ntrative compensation system, akin to workers\ncompensation. Administrative compensation\nproposals typically suggest that patients should\nnot have to prove that their providers were neg-\nligent, only that their injury could have been\navoided in an optimal system of care. Although\npolitically challenging, such proposals are ap-\npealing because trying to avoid the emotional\ndistress of being labeled as negligent may drive\na great deal of defensive behavior among phy-\nsicians.\nA final approach is to give care providers a\nstrong defense to allegations of malpractice,\nknown as a \"safe harbor,\" if they can show that\nthey followed an applicable, well-accepted, evi-\ndence-based practice guideline. By promoting\nnational, evidence-based standards of care, in-\nstead of holding physicians to the prevailing\nstandard in their state or community, safe har-\nbors also have the potential to reduce geographic\nvariation in the provision of some services.33\nConclusion\nMalpractice reform alone is unlikely to solve the\nproblem of overuse of health care services, which\nhas multiple drivers. Fee-for-service reimburse-\nment provides a financial incentive to order\nmore services. Patients' demands for services\nmay be hard to resist. Finally, physicians may\nbe averse to the risk of missing something and\nharming the patient--not just the risk of being\nsued when such harm occurs. Human beings'\nknown tendency to overestimate the probability\nof rare but serious risks reinforces physicians'\ntendency to take excessive precautions.\nAlthough malpractice reform can't root out all\nof these problems, it needs to be part of their\nsolutions. Our study suggests that innovative re-\nforms that address the underlying causes of de-\nfensive medicine have potential rewards far be-\nyond their advantages for individual patients\nand clinicians--rewards that make them worth\npursuing. \nThis study was funded by the National\nInstitute for Health Care Reform. The\nviews expressed in this article are those\nof the authors and do not necessarily\nrepresent the views of the Department\nof Veterans Affairs.\nMalpractice reform\nalone is unlikely to\nsolve the problem of\noveruse of health care\nservices.\nPhysician Office Practice\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
