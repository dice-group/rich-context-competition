    "abstract": "Abstract\nFor over 30 years, researchers such as Eisenberg and McGinty have investigated the relationship between 3-D visualization\nskills and choice of college major. Results of the present study support the fact that science and math majors tend to do\nwell on a measure of 3-D visualization. Going beyond these earlier studies, the present study investigated whether a\nmeasure of Rapid Automatic Naming of Objects--which is normally used to screen for elementary school students who\nmight struggle with speech, language, literacy, and numeracy--would further differentiate the choice of majors by college\nstudents. Far more research needs to be conducted, but results indicated that college students differentially clustered in\nscatterplot quadrants defined by the two screening assessments. Furthermore, several of these clusters, plus a statistical\nmultiplier, may lead to a new understanding of students with phonological processing differences, learning disabilities, and\nspeech and language impairments.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Article\nFinding That College Students Cluster\nin Majors Based on Differing Patterns\nof Spatial Visualization and Language\nProcessing Speeds\nRichard M. Oldrieve1 and Cynthia Bertelsen2\n Keywords\nliteracy, visualization, phonological processing, learning disabilities, science, math, and technology, STEM, neuroscience\nThis article describes a study with three levels of focus. The\nfirst level was confirmatory. Since at least Eisenberg and\nMcGinty's study was published in 1977, it has been known\nthat college students majoring in science and math tend to\nhave better visualization skills than students enrolled in\nmath courses for other majors, such as elementary\neducation. Furthermore, as has been shown by Medina,\nGerson, and Sorby (1998), there seems to be a minimum\nlevel of visualization skill necessary for college students to\nsucceed in majors such as science, technology, engineering,\nand mathematics (STEM). More recently, researchers have\nfound visualization is useful to perform some STEM-related\ntasks outside the classroom (Lathan & Tracey, 2002;\nMenchaca-Brandan, Liu, Oman, & Natapoff, 2007; Piburn\net al., 2005). In addition, researchers have begun to\ndemonstrate visualization can be improved in ways that\nhelp students succeed in college. For example, Sorby\ncollege engineering students with low visualization skills\ninto mini-courses designed to improve their visualization\nskills. These studies found that the mini-courses not only\nimproved the student's visualization skills, but they raised\nthe student's grade point averages (GPAs) and a higher\npercentage of them graduated with an engineering degree.\nSimilarly, Onyancha and Kinsey (2007) have shown\nengineering courses can be designed to improve\nvisualization.\nThus, to set a baseline for future implementation of\nvisualization courses, the research question for the\nconfirmatory level of focus was, \"Do college students\nenrolled in a calculus class for math and science majors\nhave higher levels of visualization ability than Early\nChildhood majors enrolled in a literacy assessment\ncourse?\"\nThe second level of focus was to determine if there were\nother majors where visualization could be predicted to be\nnecessary. For example, students were tested in three fine\narts courses: Music Theory, Printmaking, and the\nFoundations of 3-Dimensional Art. The study also\nexpanded beyond elementary education majors to several\nother education majors where it could be expected\nvisualization may or may not be required. For example, this\nstudy's participants included future K-3 early childhood\nteachers, Grades 4 to 8 middle childhood teachers, and high\nschool science, math, language arts, and social studies\nteachers.\nThe research question for this second level of focus was,\n\"Do students enrolled in college classes that seem to present\nprima facie evidence of requiring visualization have higher\nscores on a test of visualization than students enrolled in\n1Cleveland State University, OH, USA\n2Bowling Green State University, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: oldrieve@aol.com\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\nclasses and majors where visualization does not seem to be\nrequired?\nThe third level of focus was exploratory. Researchers in\nthe field of learning disabilities have long believed that with\nproper early intervention, students with learning disabilities\nwho are given appropriate early interventions might\nsucceed in certain fields. Corina et al. (2001) referenced the\nAesop Fable to suggest that proper early intervention can\nhelp the methodical tortoise outrace the hare. A metaphor\nthat is based on a tortoise seems appropriate to this study\nbecause slow times on assessment of rapid automatic\nnaming (RAN) have long been correlated with the\nphonological processing disorders manifested in many\nstudents with speech and language impairments and\nlearning disabilities. For example, in their meta-analysis,\nthe National Early Literacy Panel (2008) found that\nmeasures of RAN of Objects have a moderate correlation\nwith early reading failure (Objects r = .32 and\nLetters/Digits r = .40).\nUnfortunately, Aesop's fable version of the tortoise\nmetaphor relies on the hare being lazy. A better tortoise\nmetaphor might be built around E. O. Wilson's (1999,\nCharles Darwin's studies of the ecology of the Galapagos\nIslands. In terms of evolutionary biology, a tortoise trades\noff the advantage of carrying around a defensive shell for\nthe disadvantage of slow mobility. Thus, the tortoise does\nnot have to \"catch\" the hare to thrive; the tortoise merely\nhas to live in an ecological niche where a defensive shell is\na bigger advantage than possessing blazing speed.\nThe fact that RAN speed can differ depending on the\ntask is supported by MacLeod (1991) theory of parallel\nprocessing. He suggested that differences in the quantity of\nparallel processors would explain differences in how long\nindividuals take to complete a RAN task that has cognitive\ninterference (i.e., Stroop effects). For example, it is much\neasier to name a series of objects when a word printed on\ntop of the object is the same as the name of the object than\nwhen the printed word is different from the name of the\nobject. Similarly, if the object is a line-drawing of a boat,\nthen naming the object as being a \"boat\" is easier to do if\nthe word \"boat\" is printed on top of a pictured boat than it\nwould be to do if the printed word is \"car.\" Similarly, if the\nword \"red\" is printed in purple ink, it takes longer to name\nthe ink as being purple than it is to name the printed word\nas being \"red.\"\nWhen interpreting the results of an earlier study on a\nstudents with slow times on RAN would tend to devote\nmore parallel processors to a given task than students with\nfast times. And that in early elementary school, this\ntendency makes it harder for them to make appropriate\npaired associations--for example, a beginning reader\nlearning to\n\u00b7 Identify that a specific letter sound is represented by a\ngiven written letter;\n\u00b7 Identify that a given letter makes a specific sound;\n\u00b7 During spelling, match spoken phonemes to written\ngraphemes; and\n\u00b7 During reading, decode written words into spoken\nwords.\nYet, with more complex comprehension and problem-\nsolving tasks--like those found in upper level college\ncourses--the Oldrieve hypothesized that a student who tends\nto devote more parallel processors to a given task would have\nan advantage. Thus, Oldrieve hypothesized that students who\nname objects more slowly than their peers in elementary\nschool, and who succeed in learning how to read, write, and\ndo arithmetic (with or without having been officially\ndiagnosed with a phonological processing disorder), and who\nsucceed in getting accepted into college, may do well in\ncollege courses where complex comprehension and/or\nproblem solving is required.\nAdmittedly, this is a correlational study instead of a\nlongitudinal study. Therefore, it cannot causally show that\nthe students who manifested slow rapid automatic times\nwhen they were tested for this study would have manifested\nslow times in elementary school. Therefore, the two third-\nlevel research questions are as follows:\n\u00b7 What college majors would college students with\nslow RAN of Object times tend to be found?\n\u00b7 Would there be any interaction effects between RAN\nof Objects times and Purdue Spatial Visualization\nTest: Rotations (PSVT:R) percentages that could be\nfound on scatterplots?\nMethod\nMulti-level Research Team\nJust as this study has three levels of research questions, this\nstudy was conducted with the help of a three-level research\nteam. At the top level, the overall funding grant for this\nstudy came from a consortium of four universities, an open\nenrollment community college that serves as a feeder\nschool to the universities, and dozens of K-12 schools. The\nmission of COSMOS: the Northwest Ohio Center for\nExcellence in STEM Education is to improve math and\nscience education for kindergarten to doctoral-level\nstudents.\nThe second level originated within a teaching and\nlearning community sponsored by one of the participating\nuniversities. This teaching and learning community focuses\non improving science and math education at the university\nwhere it is held. Members include professors and graduate\nstudents who teach college students algebra, biology,\ncalculus, chemistry, environmental health, geology,\nphysics, psychology, statistics, math education, science\nOldrieve and Bertelsen\neducation, and literacy assessment. To fund the present\nstudy, six members of the teaching and learning community\nhelped write a grant from the overarching consortium. They\nalso helped collect the data within their math and science\nclasses. They also recruited a member of the overarching\nconsortium to collect data at her community college.\nIt was Oldrieve who convinced the other members of the\nteaching and learning community's research team to include\nWiig, Semel, and Nystrom's (1982) assessment of RAN of\nObjects. Furthermore, Oldrieve recruited the fine arts and\nliteracy assessment professors to grant us 30 min of class\ntime to assess their students.\nIn addition, Oldrieve recruited Bertelsen, a fellow\nliteracy professor, to supervise the \"blind\" data handling,\nand to help write and edit conference proposals, conference\npresentations, and this article. Graduate students in the\nliteracy program were then recruited by the literacy\nprofessors to proctor the assessments in the literacy\nassessment and fine arts classes. The graduate students then\nhelped collect, collate, and input the data into an excel\ndatabase. The complete team of Oldrieve, Bertelsen,\nDarabie, Bullerjahn, Filippova, Bragg, Keil, & Meel (2008)\nreported preliminary results at a conference sponsored by\nthe COSMOS consortium which funded the study.\nAfter the excel database was created, it was analyzed by\n(a) Oldrieve, who conducted the SPSS analysis and\nformatted the scatterplots; (b) a statistics professor, Nancy\nBoudreau, who made the suggestion of using fine arts\nclasses and who conducted an SAS analysis to check\nOldrieve's work; and (c) a doctoral student in statistics,\nNgoc Nguyen, who found the statistical multiplier. Then the\nresults were checked again by another statistics professor,\nMike Gillespie.\nNext, several of the math and science professors\nparticipated in a presentation of this study's overall results\nat the consortium's annual symposium. The math and\nscience professors then used the data set to focus on the\nvisualization data to improve their own teaching and decide\nwhether to replicate the 10-week visualization course\ndeveloped by Sorby (2000) and her colleagues (Boersma et\nIt is also important to note that both the overarching\nconsortium and the university's faculty research\norganization have provided additional grants for developing\nonline administration of the assessments. In addition, as a\nfollow-up to this study, the organizers for the consortium's\nlast two annual symposiums allocated the two literacy\nprofessors a conference room to conduct an all-day\nparticipatory action research project, where symposium\nattendees could stop in for 20 min to take the demographic\nsurvey and two assessments on iPads.\nParticipants\nThe original study included a total of 356 students who\nwere either enrolled at a Community College located on\nthe outskirts of an industrial city of a few hundred\nthousand residents or at a mid-sized State University\nlocated in a semi-rural area approximately 20 miles\noutside the city's limits. The Midwestern Community\nCollege (MWCC) serves as a feeder school to the\nMidwestern State University (MWSU). MWSU is\nmoderately selective and serves a predominately\nresidential undergraduate student population.\nAt MWCC, five sections of introductory Biology 201 for\nhealth and science career majors were assessed. In addition,\nMWCC participants were tested from three sections of\nMicrobiology 251--the third course in the biology\nsequence. Fortunately, the testing went well in Biology 201.\nUnfortunately, the projector and computer combination in\nthe Microbiology classroom did not sync with the MS Excel\nprogram that was being used as the official timer. It could\nhave been the computer was incompatible with the\nprojector, or the computer's operating system was\nincompatible with the special software coding being\nused by the timer's MS Excel file, or the computer's\nmicroprocessor was too slow. Thus, the RAN of Objects\nresults for the three sections of the Microbiology class\nresults could not be used in the study's grand mean.\nConsequently, the results from the microbiology students\non the PSVT:R were also excluded from the study's grand\nmean. Nonetheless, the PSVT:R for these Microbiology\nstudents will be used for comparative purposes in the\n\"visual analysis\" section.\nAt the university level, professors volunteered their\nclasses from a variety of fields. These included one\nfreshman/sophomore-level art printmaking and one\nfreshman/sophomore-level 3-D art course, one sophomore-\nlevel music theory (Aural Music IV), three senior-level Early\nChildhood Education (ECE) reading assessment, two senior-\nlevel Middle Childhood Education (MCE) reading\nassessment, three senior-level Adolescent and Young Adult\n(AYA) classroom assessment classes, one introductory\ncalculus for math and science majors, and one junior-level\nindustrial hygiene class. Although both art classes were\nfreshman/sophomore level, there was little overlap in which\nart majors were taking the two courses the semester they\nwere assessed. Finally, it must be noted that no engineering\ncourses were enrolled because MWSU does not have an\nengineering program.\nAll 356 students were tested at the beginning of the\nsemester. About half of these students were tested a second\ntime at the end of the semester to determine if there were\nany classes which improved the visual processing of\nenrolled students. Most of the research team would have\nhypothesized that the 3-D art class would have had the best\nprospect of improving visualization ability. No class had\nmarked improvement.\nIn statistical terms, it is recognized that each student's\ndata are an artifact of each student being nested within a\nparticular section, a particular class type, within a given\nfield, and within a given university situation. In general,\n4 SAGE Open\nclass type was used when conducting statistical analysis of\nthe numerical data and visual analysis of the scatterplots.\nNonetheless, for each section of a class, a visual analysis of\nthe scatterplots and a statistical analysis of the numerical\ndata were conducted to see if they represented the same\ntrend as the class as a whole.\nInstrumentation\nSelf-reported data. During the class session before the\nassessments were administered, professors distributed a\ncover letter that explained the purpose of the study. They\nalso distributed a permission slip approved by the Internal\nReview Boards of both MWCC and MWSU. Then, during\nthe next class session, members of the research team would\nshow an MS Power Point presentation that explained the\npurpose of the study. Students were also given a chance to\nask questions about the tests, the permission slip, and/or\ntheir ability to opt out of taking the assessments. Because\nvarious members of the research team presented the MS\nPower Point to a given class, there could easily have been\ndifferent points of emphasis and tones.\nAfter the MS Power Point, participants were asked to\nanswer 12 demographic questions. Some questions\npertained to grade level, age, gender, and college major. As\nthere were only five possible responses to the questions\nabout the ethnic/racial background of the students, some\nstudents expressed discontent and wished more choices,\nsuch as \"multi-racial,\" had been offered as opposed to\nAfrican American, Asian American, White European\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and International\nStudent/ESL. The last category was meant to separate out\nstudents who might be naming objects in their second\nlanguage.\nPSVT:R. After reviewing numerous tests purporting to\nmeasure \"visualization,\" the team members settled on\nBodner and Guay's (1997) PSVT:R sub-test as a good core\nassessment of visualization to be used for this study. On a\nwritten request to use the assessment, and to eventually post\nan online version of it, Bodner himself sent the research\nteam a 20-question version with a 10-min time limit. One\nreason for choosing the PSVT:R was that it seems to\nmeasure a key component of visualization that would be\nrequired for doing well in math and science:\nThe spatial visualization factor measures the ability to mentally\nrestructure or manipulate the components of the visual stimulus\nand involves recognizing, retaining, and recalling\nconfigurations when the figure or parts of the figure are moved.\nThe PSVT:R also had four other key features that would\nmake it easy to give within the 20 to 25 min time frame\n(i.e., half a typical 50 min college class) that even the art\nand music professors were willing to allot:\na. The PSVT:R assessment has a 10-min time limit.\nb. The PSVT:R was designed to be given to large\ngroups.\nc. Many researchers have used the PSVT:R in the\npreviously mentioned studies of college students\n(Charyton, Jagacinski, Merrill, Clifton, & DeDios,\neffects in outside the classroom situations (Lathan &\nd. The PSVT:R is an open source and therefore costs\nnothing to administer to hundreds of students.\nSee Figure 1 for the introductory sample question from\nthe PSVT:R.\nIt should also be noted that in a personal communication,\nof the PSVT:R has 30 questions in which 20 min are\nallotted, and that her team had developed a 10-question\nversion in which participants were allotted 7 min.\nMathematically, it would then stand to reason that a 20-\nquestion version should have been allotted 14 min. As will\nbe explained later, results also supported a 14 min limit.\nThus, the online version for future studies was given a 14\nmin time limit instead of a 10-min limit.\nRAN of Objects. The Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) of\nObjects assessment used in this study was developed by\nWiig et al. (1982) to help screen for Specific Language\nImpairments (SLI) in elementary schools. In addition,\nWiig et al. mention that their assessment should be useful\nfor screening for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) and\ndyscalculia. Wiig et al.'s assessment has eight objects\narranged in an 8 \u00d7 4 grid in which six items are repeated 4\ntimes, one object is repeated 5 times, and another object is\nrepeated 3 times. The object names of key, comb, pen,\nring, book, cup, cat, spoon would have been familiar to\nthe 8-year-olds used in Wiig et al.'s study as well as the\ncollege students used in this study (though when\npracticing, college students often named the spoon as\ntennis racquet or magnifying glass). The names were\npurposely chosen by Wiig et al. to intermix the /k/ sound\nin the first and last position in five of the eight words,\nwhile the nasals of /m/,/ n/, and /ng/ are intermixed in four\nof the eight words. Each of the eight words contains a\ndifferent medial vowel sound.\nThe protocol asks the test administrator to have the\nparticipant practice naming the objects in advance of the\ntests so as to allow clarification and ensure everyone is\ncalling the spoon a spoon as magnifying glass or tennis\nracquet would take longer to say than spoon. Consequently,\nany hesitations and/or misnamings would be assumed to\noccur more often due to the processing difficulties posed by\nmemory searching and/or the phonological processing\nneeded to complete the task.\nOldrieve and Bertelsen\nFigure 1. Introductory sample question from PSVT:R.\nNote. PSVT:R = Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Rotations.\nLike the PSVT:R, one reason for choosing Wiig et al.\n(1982) RAN of Objects assessment is that it is open source.\nAnother reason is that Wiig et al. report that the RAN of\nObjects is relatively immune to improvement through\npractice on the task. Then, in a more recent study, Wiig,\nZureich, and Chan (2000) found that teenagers with\ndiagnosed learning disabilities continued to have slower\nRAN of Objects times than matched aged control students.\nIn contrast, Wiig et al. (2000) found that other assessments\nof RAN, such as those focusing on numbers, letters, and\nsight words, lose their predictive value for speech,\nlanguage, and SLD as the students learn the academic skill,\nand become fluent in naming the numbers, letters, and\nnumbers. Thus, Wiig et al.'s RAN of Objects assessment\nshould prove useful for longitudinal studies.\nAs was mentioned earlier, the fine arts and literacy\nassessment professors who allowed us into their classes\npreferred that the assessment battery be completed within a\n20 to 25 min time frame (half of a typical college class\nperiod). Thus, it was clear that it would be too time-\nconsuming to have three or four graduate students\nindividually assess all the students enrolled in a 50-person\nclass. As a concession to time limitations, each participant\nwas asked to concentrate on naming the objects amid the\nverbal chaos of a simultaneous reading, and then when they\nwere finished they were asked to look up at a projected\ntimer and record their own time.\nBecause of fortuitous extenuating circumstances in\nseveral classes, 58 students took the test one-on-one\nAFTER taking it en masse. For example, one professor let\n6 SAGE Open\nus administer the assessments on the day he was leaving to\nattend a conference. Thus, after he introduced us, he left for\nthe airport, and we had 48 min to show the power point,\nhave students fill out the survey, take the PSVT:R, and take\nthe RAN of Objects Assessment both en masse and one-on-\none. Even with the extra time required to administer the\nRAN of Objects assessment one-on-one, class members\nwere happy because we let them out 10 to 15 min early.\nThe correlation between the en masse and one-on-one\ndemonstrates the en masse administration made the results\nless reliable and valid, but lower validity was already a\ngiven as Wiig et al.'s assessment was designed for\nelementary school students and had not been used on\ncollege students. (See the results of Aural Music IV for\nmore explication on the slightly lower r value than normally\nconsidered \"valid\" and \"reliable.\").\nGrades. At the end of the spring semester, every professor\nwhose class participated in the study sent the research team\na list of each student's name, ID number, the letter grade,\nand the percentage the student earned in the class. The\npercentages were then converted to z scores to compare one\nclass to another. The research team was aware that there\nwere differences among classes of different grade levels,\nand although they were not ideal, z scores seemed like they\nwould be the best comparative tool.\nResults\nOverall Statistics Related to PSVT:R\nTable 1 contains the overall means for the PSVT:R and the\nRAN of Objects. For the PSVT:R, Table 2 contains the\naverage PSVT:R percentages and standard deviations for all\nnine class types sorted from highest to lowest. Table 2 reveals\nthat there was a large gap between the highest class average of\n70.91% for Printmaking at MWSU, and the lowest class\nin Table 3, an ANOVA followed by a Tukey's analysis (see\nTable 4) revealed there was a statistical difference between\nBiology 201 and the classes of Music Theory IV and Calculus\nfor Math and Science Majors. Due to smaller class sizes,\nneither printmaking nor 3-D art were found to be significantly\ndifferent from Biology 201. Although, when combined into a\nsingle category of \"visual arts,\" the combined class was\nsignificantly different from that of Biology 201.\nTable 1.

Nevertheless, the\naverage PSVT:R percentage for this third course in the\nMWCC's biology sequence for biology and health career\nmajors was 64.16%. This percentage is right in line with the\nPSVT:R percentages for MWSU's Industrial Hygiene for\nhealth career majors (64%).\nBrief Discussion of PSVT:R Results\nIn many ways, the fact that the Biology 201 PSVT:R scores\nwere the lowest of any class measured seems rather\nincongruous with the hypothesis that students enrolled in\nmath and science courses would tend to attain high scores\non the PSVT:R. Even more so as Biology 201 is the first\ncourse in the sequence of courses designed for future\nbiology majors while Biology 101 would be the course non-\nmajors would take. Nonetheless, the community college has\nan open enrollment policy while the university has\nminimum requirements for ACT scores. Furthermore, other\nthan the three fine arts courses, the university students\nwould have been required to have taken or placed out of the\nOldrieve and Bertelsen\nTable 4.

Thus, it is important to note that 11 students enrolled\nin Biology 201 scored more than 2 standard deviations below\nthe grand mean (approximately 20% or less) for\nvisualization, then two courses later in the sequence only 1\nstudent in Microbiology 251, and no students enrolled in the\nuniversity, scored that low. Thus, Biology 201 seems to be an\nMWCC course that serves to either: (a) that improve the\nvisualization skills of potential science and health\nprofessionals who come to school with low visualization\nability; or (b) sort out students who are low in visualization\nability from completing the Bio sequence.\nFurthermore, the fact that Aural Music IV and a\ncombined score for Printmaking and 3-D art would be\nsignificantly higher than Biology 201 supports a prima facie\nlogic test that music majors and visual arts majors would be\nbetter at visualization.\nIt also seems to be important to point out that Sorby (2000)\nand Boersma et al. (2004) set a cut-off percentage of 60% for\ndetermining whether engineering students should be advised to\ntake a mini-course in visualization. The average PSVT:R\npercentages for all the courses, except Biology 201 and Early\nChildhood Literacy Assessment, exceeded the cut-off\npercentage of 60%. And the Early Childhood average percent\ncorrect of 58% was off by less than one wrong answer.\nOverall Statistics Related to RAN of Objects\nAs can be seen in Table 5, on the RAN of Objects\nassessment there was nearly a 2-s gap between the fastest\nclass average time of 16.79 s for Aural Music IV and the\nslowest class average time of 18.47 for Middle Childhood\nReading Assessment. Nonetheless, an ANOVA followed by\na Tukey's analysis revealed no statistical differences\nbetween any classes matched against any other class.\nIn contrast, when looking at the individual student, a\nstatistically significant multiplier was found that indicated\nslower times might lead to better class grades. For example,\nfor each second, longer a student took to complete the RAN\nof Objects assessment, the student had a 1.04 greater chance\nto earn a course grade that was half a standard deviation\nabove the mean for that particular course.\nBrief Discussion of RAN of Objects Results\nThe fact that there were no statistically significant\ndifferences from one class to another on RAN of Objects\nseems to suggest that students do not use their intuitive\nsense of their own naming speed to influence their choice of\na major. This was supported by the demographic survey's\nself-identification profiles when there was a statistically\nsignificant correlation of r = .398 between how a student\nthought they would do on the PSVT:R and how well they\nactually did. In contrast, there was a much lower, though\nstill highly significant correlation of only r = .169 between\na student's prediction of being fast or slow and their actual\nresults (see Table 6).\nYet, the fact that for every second slower a student takes to\ncomplete the RAN of Objects assessment increases the odds\nthe student will do well in a given course, suggests that\ncollege professors might \"value\" whatever benefits slow times\non RAN of Objects tests might bequeath to a given individual.\nIn essence, the National Early Literacy Panel (2008) and\nMi\nass\naw\nco\nRA\near\nrel\nsen\non\na\npro\nVis\nan\nA\ntha\nco\nfro\nsug\ndif\nev\nsig\nwh\ntha\nco\nto\nco\n\"lo\nbo\nrep\nfas\ned\nthe\nqu\nsca\nY-\nor\nve\nSim\nbis\npe\nor\nfou\nichel, and Ovr\nsessments is co\nwareness and p\nntrast, this stud\nAN of Objects i\nrn a high gra\nlationship was\nnse as there ar\nn time in any cla\nfast-processor,\noject, or take-ho\nsual Inspectio\nnd RAN of Ob\nkey premise o\nat there is litt\nmparing a sma\nom condition A\nggests that w\nfferent results\nvidence that a\ngnificant effect\nhether there mi\nat would show\nmbined PSVT:\nTo make the a\n\"visualization\nrrespond to be\now visualizatio\nottom of the sc\npresent times o\nst times nearer\ndge.

A quick visual analysis of\nthe scatterplot for Biology 201 (see Figure 2) indicates that\nthe students enrolled in Biology 201 are spread fairly evenly\nbetween the four quadrants defined by the PSVT:R\npercentages and RAN of Objects times. Although, a closer\ninspection reveals that there are many more students in the\nlower left quadrant than the upper right quadrant. Also, a\nvisual analysis of the scatterplots for Biology 201, found\nthat 11 students scored more than 2 standard deviations\nbelow the mean for PSVT:R. Then, when the scatterplots\nfor all of the other classes were analyzed, only 1 MWCC's\nMicrobiology 251 student and no MWSU student scored\nmore than 2 standard deviations below the mean. Hence, a\nreasonable conjecture would be the community college's\nopen admission policy allowed some students to enroll in\nBiology 201 who were either low on visualization or less\nmotivated than their counterparts to take the PSVT:R\nassessment seriously.\nVisual analysis of MWSU's Early Childhood Literacy Assessment.\nStudents enrolled in the Early Childhood Reading\nAssessment class at MWSU (see Figure 3) mirrored the\nresults of the students enrolled in Biology 201 at MWCC,\nwith students found in all four quadrants (compare Figures\n2 and 3). One major difference being that the extremes in\nall four directions were muted with most students within 1\nstandard deviation of the grand mean of both visualization\nand processing speed. In particular, as was already noted,\nthere were 11 students enrolled in Biology 201 who scored\nmore than 2 standard deviations below the Grand Mean on\nthe PSVT:R, whereas, there were no students enrolled in\nEarly Childhood Reading Assessment or any other class at\nMWSU who scored this low. The fact that there were no\nstudents with extremely low scores on the PSVT:R could be\nexplained because Early Childhood majors may NOT enroll\nin the assessment class UNTIL they (a) pass a 200-level\ncourse targeting math skills, (b) earn a 3.2 overall GPA\n(grade point average), AND (c) either pass the Praxis I\nexam with a 172 on the math section or earn a 22 on the\nVerbal analysis of MWSU's Calculus class for math and science\nmajors. A similar \"centered\" pattern was found in the\nCalculus class for math and science majors. The key\ndifference between Calculus, Early Childhood Literacy\nAssessment, and Biology 201, is that the top score for\nCalculus was almost 1 standard deviation higher than it was\nfor Early Childhood Literacy Assessment, and the lowest\nscore was between the mean and 1 standard deviation below\nthe mean. This is higher than that between 1 and 2 standard\ndeviations below the mean for Early Childhood Literacy\nAssessment, and more than 2 standard deviations below the\nAs noted earlier, the PSVT:R scores for calculus were\nfound to be significantly different from those of Biology\n201. Thus, as predicted by the previous results of Eisenberg\nvisualization there was trend up the Y-axis when moving\nfrom Biology 201, to Early Childhood Reading Assessment,\nand on to Calculus. Based on course prerequisites and the\ndemands of the fields, presumably scores on a norm-\nreferenced math assessment such as the Praxis I, the ACT,\nand/or the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) would\nfollow the same upward trend.\nIt should also be noted that a few sections of\nMicrobiology 251, the third course in the sequence of\ncourses for MWCC biology majors, also participated in\nthis study. As noted earlier, there was a projector,\ncomputer, and/or software synchronization issue with the\nMS Excel timing program and so the PSVT:R scores and\nRAN of Objects were not included in the Grand Mean.\nNonetheless, the average PSVT:R score for Microbiology\nthe PSVT:R averages for Industrial Hygiene (64%) at\nVisual analysis of MWSU's Aural Music IV. A quick visual\ninspection of Aural Music IV suggests that most of the\nstudents were located in the upper-left quadrant of Fast\nRAN times and High Visualization scores (see Figure 4).\nA closer visual analysis indicates all but 7 of the 55\nstudents were faster than the grand mean on the RAN of\nObjects. A check through the self-promoted demographic\nprofiles of these seven students found that all seven of\nthese individuals self-identified as ambidextrous. This\ncreated a distinct contrast with their classmates as NONE\nof their classmates who were faster than the mean self-\nidentified as ambidextrous. This might suggest more\ndetailed interviews are needed to determine underlying\nfactors of this fast/slow divide, especially as other\nresearchers such as Goldberg (2001) have noted\nambidexterity can be a hallmark of creativity and the fact\nstudents are using both hemispheres of the brain; or in\nterms of MacLeod (1991), creative students may be\nusing more parallel processors.\nPlus, going back to the correlation between the\nindividual administration of the RAN of Objects correlation\nof r = .638 and p < .001, it is interesting to note that it was\nthe Aural Music IV class which not only had the fastest\naverage time of 16.79 s, but the largest standard deviation\nof 7.66 s. The fastest average times seems to make prima\nfacie sense for a major where musicians are trained to\nsimultaneously try to fit into the group while paying\nattention to their own score and performance; this is\nbecause they would tend to be less flustered by aural chaos.\nHowever, the largest standard deviation seems to be\nsurfacing another neurological trait of those who were\nsimultaneously slower than the grand mean and\nambidextrous. Future studies could target musicians to ask\nthem what field of music they were majoring in and\nwhether they were training to become a performer, director,\nor composer.\nFig\nOb\nNo\nVis\nFig\ngra\nNo\nVis\nFig\nHig\nNo\nVis\ngure 4.

At the request\nof two reviewers, a discriminant analysis of the high school\nteachers was conducted. As could be expected from the\nabove description, there was no statistical significance\nfound when social studies teachers were included in the\ndiscriminant analysis. This is because the social studies\nformed bi-modal clusters where approximately half fell into\nthe quadrant of science teachers and the other half fell into\nthe caddy-corner quadrant of language arts teachers.\nIn contrast, when focusing on science, math, and\nlanguage arts teachers as being situated in distinct quadrants\ndefined by the RAN of Objects and PSVT:R, for Function 1\nthe Eigenvalue was .628, the percentage of the variance was\n2, the Eigenvalue was .307, the percentage of the variance\nNext, for Test of Functions 1 to 2, the Wilks's lambda\nfreedom and a significance of .004. For the Test of Function\n2, the Wilks's lambda was .765 and the chi-square was\nFinally, in a discriminant analysis, the baseline\npercentages for randomly assigning a given individual to a\nparticular group would be\nCompared with these baseline percentages, 66.7% of the\ncases were categorized correctly for \"original grouped cases,\"\nand 62.5% of cases were categorized correctly for \"cross-\nvalidated grouped cases.\" Thus, the categorization of science\nteachers is considerably above the generally accepted\nstandard of 25% greater than baseline, while the\ncategorizations of math and language teachers straddled the\nborderline of the generally accepted standard of 25% greater\nthan baseline. (It should be noted that the ns listed above do\nnot necessarily match up with the number of dots on a given\nscatterplot because 2 or 3 students might have the same\nmatch of PSVT:R percent and RAN of Objects time.)\nAdmittedly, conducting a series of statistical tests\nincluding the discriminant analysis, the Wilks's lambda,\nchi-square, and one by one ANOVA comparisons run into\nall sorts of methodological issues because statistical\nanalysis was performed on sub-samples that were not\nspecifically proposed in the research questions. Similarly,\nthe Bonferroni adjustments that would be needed could\nnegate the statistical significance, especially if similar\nbreakout comparisons were made for every participating\nclass in regard to the exact major of every single student in\nthe class. Nonetheless, in this exploratory study, the after\nthe fact discriminant analyses and ANOVAs support the\nreasonableness of using visual inspections based on the\nlogic of single-subject research described by Kazdin (1982).\nThen, in the future targeted studies where the research\nquestions would focus solely on differences between high\nschool science, math, and language arts teachers, there\nwould not be as many statistical adjustments needed.\nPatterns for Other Classes That Were Tested\nIn general, the pattern for all of the other classes was\ncentrist in regard to both RAN of Objects and Visualization.\nThough there was a subset of four Middle Childhood social\nstudies teachers who had Low Visualization scores and\nslow times on the RAN of Objects. Thus, these four Middle\nChildhood social studies teachers mimicked the cluster of\nHigh School social studies teachers.\nLimitations\nLimitations include the fact that Wiig et al. (1982) RAN of\nObjects test was being used for adults when it was normed\nusing students in elementary school. Furthermore, the RAN\nof Objects test was administered en masse to reduce the\ntime spent in a given classroom and reduce the number of\ngraduate students required to help proctor a testing session.\nThus, there are no pre-existing \"norms\" for comparison. In\naddition, though math and science majors were assessed,\nthere is no engineering program at the university where\nmost of the testing was conducted. Next, the test results\nsurfaced questions that should be added to the demographic\nsurvey. For example, it would be good to know whether a\ngiven individual enrolled in Music Theory IV was interested\nin musical composition, performance, teaching, and/or\ndirecting.\nWhat cannot be determined without a longitudinal study\nis whether students intuitively chose a major because their\npre-existing thinking style matched the thinking style\nrequired to succeed in the field, or whether students chose a\ngiven field and then they were shaped into thinking in a\ncertain way by the way the subject is taught.\nDiscussion\nAs noted in the introduction, back in 1977 Eisenberg and\nMcGinty published an article describing how visualization\npredicted a student's field of study. What this study adds to\nprevious research on visualization is that it contains both a\ntest for 3-D visualization (Bodner & Guay, 1997) as well as\none for RAN of Objects (Wiig et al., 1982), and the results\nsuggest both assessments may be needed to give\nappropriate guidance to students about their future\nacademic majors and career choices.\nThe premise that RAN of Objects might surface\ndifferences in choice of college majors originates from the\nfields of special education and speech and language\npathology. Researchers in these fields have long used RAN\nof Objects assessments to screen for pre-school and\nOldrieve and Bertelsen\nkindergarten students who struggle to learn how to speak\nfluently, develop phonemic awareness, and ultimately learn\nhow to read. Thus, it only makes sense that RAN of Objects\nmight also sort where students with slow RAN of Objects\ntimes end up in college if they learn how to read, write, and\ndo arithmetic.\nAs noted earlier, researchers such as Corina et al. (2001)\nhave used the Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare to\ndescribe how students with learning disabilities might end\nup successful. Our research team suggests that a metaphor\nof a tortoise living in the appropriate ecological niche of\nDarwin's Galapagos Islands might better explain this\nstudy's counter-intuitive findings. For example, there was a\nstatistically significant multiplier that for every second\nSLOWER a college student took to complete the RAN of\nObjects Assessment, the student had greater odds of earning\na high grade in the class he or she was enrolled. Or, the\nsupporting counter-intuitive finding that as fast times on\nRAN of Objects assessments are typically associated with\nearly reading success (National Early Literacy Panel, 2008),\nit would seem that future language arts teachers would be\nfound in the bottom-left-hand corner of low Visualization\nand fast RAN of Objects; instead this study found them in\nthe bottom right hand corner where they had low\nVisualization and slow RAN of Objects.\nYes, there undoubtedly is a chicken or the egg\ncomponent to any field of academic learning. As Sorby\nal., 1998) have shown, engineering students who score\nbelow 60 on the PSVT:R benefit from taking a 10-week\ncourse in visualization. Compared with their low scoring\npeers who do not take the 10-week visualization course,\nstudents who take the course have increased GPAs and\ngraduation rates. Thus, direct training in how to visualize 3-\nD objects was effective in helping students \"think like an\nengineer.\" Similarly, Bruner (1999) said the goal of a math\nteacher should be to have their students learn how to think\nlike a mathematician and that science teachers should be\nhelping their students think like scientists. Thus, in the\nprocess of teaching their students to think like\nmathematicians, scientists, poets, and so on, the professors\nand teachers of any academic discipline may also be\nshaping the cognitive processing of their students. Yet, it\ncould also be true that more explicit training in the\nunderlying neurologically based skills needed to think like a\nhigh school science, math, and social studies teacher might\nmake future teachers better prepared to teach their subject\narea.\nFuture Directions\nThis study supports the research of Eisenberg and McGinty\n(1977) who found that visualization skill tends to be higher\nin college students majoring in math or science than for\nelementary education majors. This study expands on their\nwork by also finding that students majoring in music and\nthe visual arts match or even better the visualization skills\nof future math and science majors. Finally, this research\nproject found that a combination of PSVT:R percentages\nand RAN of Objects time creates scatterplots on which\nstudents in different majors cluster either in a centrist\nposition or in one of four quadrants. To provide more\nsupport and added depth for these findings, our research\nteam proposes four lines of follow-up research.\nFirst, several larger n studies are needed to\nspecifically target future and current high school science\nand math teachers. These larger n studies could then\nprovide stronger evidence that except for approximately\na 30% overlap near the grand mean, there are statistically\nsignificant categorical differences in the RAN of Objects\ntimes between high school science and math teachers.\nFurthermore, if this difference is confirmed, STEM\neducators could provide more guidance to prospective\nmath and science teachers and help them choose the\nsubject area which fits their cognitive profile. For\nexample, prospective teachers who are deciding whether\nto teach high school math and/or science could be tested\nfor their RAN of Objects times. Then, individuals who\nname objects more than half of a standard deviation faster\nthan the grand mean, could be counseled to become\nscience teachers. In contrast, those who name more than\nhalf of a standard deviation slower than the mean could\nbe counseled to become a high school math teacher.\nFinally, individuals whose time is close to the grand\nmean might be counseled to pursue both math and\nscience teaching--so that they could make themselves\nmore marketable to small school districts. In contrast, a\nfuture teacher who does not receive appropriate guidance\nand chooses incorrectly might decide to quit teaching\naltogether because they sense they do not fit in with their\ncolleagues. This would be particularly regretful if the\nprospective teacher perceived that they were feeling\nuncomfortable due to difference in race, religion, gender,\nor sexual identify.\nSecond, as is represented in Figure 10, our research team\ntheorizes the thinking styles reflected in this study's\nscatterplots align with the four types of thinking outlined by\nRowe and Neitzel (2010). To prove this, a longitudinal\nstudy is needed that tracks students from kindergarten until\nthey go to college and choose a major and career.\nThird, even though this study showed high school math\nteachers have profiles of high visualization and slow\ncognitive processing, our research team predicts that\naccountants and other mathematically related professions\nwith precise regimentation will end up in the quadrant of\nhigh visualization and fast cognitive processing. Similarly,\neven though future science teachers ended up in the\nquadrant of high visualization and fast processing, our\nresearch team predicts many theoretical physicists,\nchemists, biologists, and/or economists with fuzzy logic\ntendencies would tend to end up in the quadrant of high\nvisualization and slow processing.\nFig\npa\noth\nPS\nha\nesp\nme\ncre\nFourth, even\narallel process\nher in the sorti\nSVT:R and th\nave the highest\npecially for stu\n6 journey.
