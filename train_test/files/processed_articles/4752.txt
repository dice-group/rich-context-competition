These animals were chosen since it\nwas previously reported that APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - triple-\nmutant mice performed as well as WT (wild-type) con-\ntrol and GD3S- / - mice on a number of reference mem-\nory tasks. Cholinergic neuron-specific gangliosides, such\nas GT1a and GQ1b, were elevated in the brains of\ndouble-Tg mice (APP/PSEN1), as compared with those\nof WT mice. Remarkably, in the triple mutant mouse brains\n(APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ), the concentration of GT1a was el-\nevated and as expected there was no expression of GQ1b.\nOn the other hand, the level of c-series gangliosides, includ-\ning GT3, was significantly reduced in the double-Tg mouse\nbrain as compared with the WT. Thus, the disruption of\nthe gene of a specific ganglioside-synthase, GD3S, altered the\nexpression of cholinergic neuron-specific gangliosides.

ASN NEURO\n Key words: Alzheimer's disease, amyloid  protein, Chol-1\nganglioside, transgenic mouse\nINTRODUCTION\nGangliosides are sialic acid-containing GSLs (glycosphin-\ngolipids) expressed primarily, but not exclusively, in the outer\nleaflet of the plasma membrane of cells of all vertebrates\n[gangliosides are abbreviated using the nomenclature rules\nThose GSLs are particularly abundant in the nervous sys-\ntem. Ganglioside metabolism is closely associated with brain\ndevelopment, and in some cases with the pathology of neu-\nrodegenerative diseases such as AD (Alzheimer's disease). AD\nis the most common type of dementia with clinical symp-\ntoms that include deficits in memory, judgment, thinking and\nT. Ariga and others\nbehaviour. The accumulation of As (amyloid -proteins) is\none of the major pathological hallmarks in AD. Although the\nfunctions of gangliosides in the pathogenic mechanisms of\nAD are not completely understood, evidence has accumu-\nlated to indicate a critical role for gangliosides in binding\nto and aggregation of As, the toxic peptides in AD brain.\nThus, gangliosides are frequently used as biomarkers associ-\nated with the pathological events of AD (Ariga et al., 2011;\nWe recently examined the ganglioside composition of\nthe brains of a double-Tg (transgenic) mouse model [APP\n(amyloid precursor protein)/PSEN1 (presenilin-1)] of AD that\nco-expresses mouse/human chimeric APP with the Swedish\ndouble-mutation and human PSEN1 with a deletion of exon\n9 (Ariga et al., 2010). Although the accumulation of A was\nconfirmed in the double-Tg mouse brains and sera, the con-\ntent and composition of the major ganglio-N-tetraosyl-series\ngangliosides in the brains were not significantly different be-\ntween the double-Tg mice and WT (wild-type) mice (Ariga\net al., 2010). This latter finding was in line with that re-\nported by Sawamura et al. (2000), who also did not detect\nany changes in the major ganglioside patterns in the mu-\ntant PSEN2 double-Tg mice as compared with those in WT\nmice. The most interesting finding of our previous study was\nthe increased expression of the Chol-1 antigens, GT1a\nand GQ1b, especially GQ1b, in the brains of double-Tg\n(APP/PSEN1) mice as compared with those in WT mice.\nA2B5 antigens, including the c-series gangliosides such as\nGT3, GT1c and GQ1c, are well-known marker molecules of\nglial precursor cells, O-2A progenitor cells, which differenti-\nate into type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Raff et al.,\nbryonic mouse brains using A2B5 mAb (monoclonal antibody)\nand the expression of GT3 was significantly diminished during\nlater development (Ngamukote et al., 2007).\nIn a previous study, we established the triple-Tg mouse\n(APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) by cross-breeding the double-Tg\n(APP/PSEN1) mouse model of AD with GD3S- / - mice\nble for the biosynthesis of GD3, a key intermediate for the\nbiosynthesis of b- and c-series gangliosides, including two of\nthe major brain gangliosides: GD1b and GT1b. Surprisingly,\nA plaques and the associated neuropathology were almost\ncompletely absent in the triple-Tg (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - )\nmice, resulting in cognitive improvement. These triple-Tg\nmice performed as well as WT controls on all behavioural\ntests of sensorimotor function, anxiety and cognition. We\nreasoned that there must be a correlation between the patho-\ngenesis of AD and the unique ganglioside composition in the\nGD3S knockout animals. For this reason, we undertook a de-\ntailed analysis of the minor gangliosides, particularly GT1a,\nGQ1b and GT3, in the brain of the double-Tg and triple-Tg\nmice and found that these minor gangliosides were signifi-\ncantly altered. The elevated expression of GT1a in the triple-\nTg animals was particularly pronounced. Our data suggest\nthat the elevated cholinergic-specific ganglioside, GT1a, in\nthe triple-mutant mouse brains (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) may\ncontribute to diminished plaque formation and, concomi-\ntantly, functional recovery in these mice.\nGangliosides and antibodies\nChol-1 gangliosides, GQ1b and GT1b, were isolated from\nGD3 ganglioside was isolated from buttermilk (Ren et al.,\nmouse immunized with 8-day chicken embryo retinas (Eisen-\nbarth et al., 1979); the hybridoma cells were obtained from\nATCC (Manassas). Mouse Chol-1 mAb (GGR-41) was ob-\ntained by immunizing mice with a GQ1b-enriched gan-\nglioside fraction extracted from bovine brain according to\nconventional procedures (Kusunoki et al., 1993).\nAnimals\nThe double-Tg mouse model of AD (APPswe\n+ PSEN1) was\npurchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor; stock\nexpress the chimeric mouse/human APP gene harbouring\nPSEN1 gene with a deletion of exon 9. The triple-Tg\nmouse model of AD (APPswe\n+ PSEN1 lacking the gene\nencoding GD3S (ST-II; ST8 -N-acetyl-neuraminide, -2,8-\nsialyltransferase 1; St8sia1) was prepared as previously\ndescribed (Bernardo et al., 2009). All animals, both male\nand female, used for ganglioside analysis were from 7\nto 9 months of age. The use of animals for this study\nwas approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittees at the Georgia Regents University and University\nof Tennessee Health Sciences Center.\nGanglioside isolation\nGangliosides were isolated from brain slices containing hip-\npocampal/cortical tissue from WT, GD3S- / - , double-Tg and\ntriple-Tg mice (n = 3 per group) as previously described (Yu\nand Ledeen, 1972) with some modifications (Ariga et al.,\n1988). Briefly, total lipids were extracted from brain tis-\nsues with 5 volumes each of chloroform\u00admethanol (1:2, 1:1\nSolvent A). Then, the combined extracts were evaporated\nand dissolved in 5 ml of Solvent A, and applied to a DEAE-\nSephadex A-25 column (acetate form, 2-ml bed volume), fol-\nlowed by elution with 20 ml of solvent A to remove the neu-\ntral lipids.

In GD3S\ngene knockout mice, all b-series gangliosides, including\nGD3, GD2, GD1b, GT1b and GQ1b, are deleted, and a-series\ngangliosides such as GM1, GD1a and GM2 show accretion\n(Okada et al., 2002). Chol-1 gangliosides are normally\nminor species in the brain and serve as unique markers of\ncholinergic neurons (Ando et al., 1992; Hirabayashi et al.,\n1992). They have also been shown immunocytochemically\nin human central nervous system (Obrocki and Borroni,\nin human neuropathology. The expression of Chol-1\ngangliosides in rat brain regions such as the hippocampus\nis developmentally regulated, and their concentrations\nincrease with aging (Derrington and Borroni, 1990). Ando\net al. (2004) further showed that treatment of anti-Chol-1\nmAb inhibited the release of acetylcholine from synapto-\nsomes. Interestingly, the memory and learning abilities of\nrats given anti-Chol-1 mAb were remarkably suppressed.\nOn the contrary, treatment of Chol-1 gangliosides of\nthe synaptosomal preparation induced choline uptake and\nenhanced acetylcholine synthesis. Thus, Chol-1 gangliosides\nmay participate in maintaining cognitive functions such\nas memory and learning. In addition, Chol-1 gangliosides\nwere shown to alleviate the decreased synaptic functions of\naged brains (Ando et al., 1998). These findings suggest that\nChol-1 antigens may play an important role in cholinergic\nsynaptic transmission and participate in cognitive function.\nIn our current study, we confirmed the expression of Chol-1\nantigens in GD3S- / - mice (Figure 2A, lane 2). As expected,\nthere was no expression of GQ1b in the brain of GD3S- / -\nmice, but the levels of GT1a were significantly elevated\n(Figure 2A, lane 2). In contrast, the concentrations of both\nChol-1 ganglioside, GQ1b and GT1a, were increased in\nthe brains of double-Tg mice as compared with those in the\nbrains of WT mice, as shown in Figure 3(B), lane 2 and 3(C).\nThe APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - triple-mutant mice lack b-\nseries gangliosides, which was compensated by a correspond-\ning increase in the a-series gangliosides, GM1 (63.8%) and\nGD1a (50.8%), as compared with those of WT mice (Bernardo\net al., 2009). In the present study, we found that the triple-\nmutant (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) mice expressed GT1a, but\nnot GQ1b; the lack of GQ1b was clearly because of the\ndeletion of the GD3S gene (Figure 3C). Remarkably, we found\nthat deletion of the gene encoding GD3S actually resulted in\na significant overexpression of GT1a ganglioside (Figures 2\nAnother interesting aspect of the ganglioside composi-\ntion in the brains of double-mutant (APP/PSEN1) and triple-\nmutant (APP/PSEN1/GD3S- / - ) mice was the expression of\nthe c-series gangliosides.

Please note that in lane 4, the amount of the two standards was too low to be revealed by the resorcinol-HCl reagent.

In triple-Tg mice, the concentration of GT1a was significantly elevated compared with those in the WT and double-mutant\nmice. No detectable amounts of GQ1b was present in the triple-mutant mouse brains.\nare normally present in very low abundance in adult\nbrain, but are robustly expressed in embryonic brain (Yu\net al., 2004); during brain maturation the biosynthesis\nof gangliosides is switched from the c- to the a- and\nb-series gangliosides (Yu et al., 2004). For this reason, A2B5\nimmunoreactivity has been widely used as an indicator of\nimmature neurons and glia. In contrast with the Chol-1\nantigens, a c-series ganglioside, GT3, was significantly\nreduced in double-mutant (APP/PSEN1) mouse brains as\ncompared with that in WT mouse brains (Figure 4). This\nfinding is different from previous immunohistochemical\nresults found in human AD brains (Takahashi et al., 1991;\nfound to be increased in AD brain. This discrepancy may be\nowing to the specificity of the mAb A2B5, which has been\nreported to cross-react with sulfatide in AD brains (Majocha\net al., 1989). It is possible that the immunoreactivity of the\nmAb A2B5 used in their study could arise not only from\nc-series ganglioside, but also from sulfatide, resulting in an\noverestimation of the immunohistochemical intensity.\nRecent advances on the disruption of genes encoding\nglycosyltransferases for ganglioside biosynthesis have facil-\nitated studies on the functional role of these glycolipids in\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nT.

The mutant\nmice did not express GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b, but ro-\nbustly expressed GM3 and GD3, as reported by Takamiya et al.\n(1996). The mutant mice also showed a significant increase\nof A accumulation in vascular tissues and formation of a\nsevere dysphonic form of amyloid angiopathy in the brain.\nMost recently, Wu et al. (2011) reported that in mutant mice\nwith a disrupted gene encoding GalNAcT, -synuclein ex-\npression was significantly elevated in the substantia nigra\npars compacta of the brains. These mice showed overt motor\ndisability on aging, loss of dopaminergic neurons and aggre-\ngation of -synuclein, resulting in Parkinson-like symptoms.\nOn the other hand, Okada et al. (2002) established a GD3S\ngene knockout mouse in which all b-series gangiosides were\ndeleted. Interestingly, these mice showed no morphologi-\ncal changes in the brains and apparent abnormal behaviour.\nMoreover, no differences in Fas-mediated apoptotic reac-\ntion in lymphocytes compared with the WT mice were found.\nHowever, the mutant mice exhibited reduced regeneration\nof axotomized hypoglossal nerves compared with the WT\nmice, suggesting that b-series gangliosides are more impor-\ntant in the repair of damaged nerves than in the differ-\nentiation of the nervous system.

These observations suggest that b-series\ngangliosides derived from the action of GD3S are one of the\nmajor causes of A accumulation and AD. Analysis of these\ntriple-mutant mice may contribute to our understanding of\nthe neurobiological and behavioural characteristics of A-\nganglioside interaction as an essential step toward eluci-\ndating the early pathological events in AD. Thus, inhibition\nof GD3S may be a useful therapeutic target to restore the\ncognitive deficits, amyloid plaque formation, and neurode-\ngeneration observed in AD (Bernardo et al., 2009). Several in-\nvestigators have described aberrant ganglioside metabolism\nmay be participated in the pathogenesis in AD (for review, see\nAriga et al., 2011). In this regard, it is interesting to note that\nchronic infusion of GM1 into the lateral ventricle of patients\nwith AD for 1 year resulted in remarkable improvement of\ntheir memory function (Svennerholm et al., 2002). The un-\nderlying mechanism of the GM1-induced effect is a sub-\nject of considerable speculation. Nonetheless, an increased\nlevel of GM1 in the triple mutant mice is consistent with the\nabove observation and may also contribute to the observed\nimproved cognitive improvement in these mice.\nIn conclusion, Chol-1 antigens and A2B5-positive c-\nseries gangliosides are normally found as minor components\nin mouse brains and their expression is developmentally reg-\nulated (Ngamukote et al., 2007). At present, the functional\nrole of those gangliosides, especially Chol-1, in the patho-\ngenesis of AD is still unknown. Our current findings that those\ngangliosides are overexpressed in the triple Tg model of AD,\nwhich also exhibits improved memory function and no amy-\nloid formation, could provide some important directions for\nfuture research.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported, in part, by a VA Merit Award [grant\n(to M.P.M.)].\nREFERENCES\nAndo S, Hirabayashi Y, Kon K, Inagaki F, Tate S, Whittaker VP (1992) A\ntrisialoganglioside containing a sialyl alpha 2-6 N-acetylgalactosamine\nresidue is a cholinergic-specific antigen, Chol-1 alpha.
