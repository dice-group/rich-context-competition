International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:107\nBackground\nSedentary behaviour (too much sitting as opposed to too\nlittle exercise) has recently emerged as a candidate inde-\npendent risk factor associated with several detrimental\nhealth outcomes [1,2]. Sedentary behaviours are defined as\nany waking behaviour characterized by an energy expend-\niture 1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture\n[3,4]. High volumes of time spent sitting or engaged in se-\ndentary behaviour have been associated with an increased\nrisk of all-cause mortality [5-7] and risk of developing type\n2 diabetes [8], obesity [9-11] and cardiovascular disease\n[12-15]. Importantly, in some studies these associations\nwith mortality and health have occurred irrespective of\nwhether an individual meets the core adult physical activity\nrecommendation of 150 minutes of at least moderate-\ninternational health authorities have recently provided for-\nmal recommendations citing the importance of reducing\nUntil recently, public health surveillance has prima-\nrily focused on understanding the distribution of popu-\nlation leisure-time physical activity (e.g. structured\nmoderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise) [22,23] and\nactive travel (e.g. walking and cycling for transporta-\ntion) [24,25]. The lack of population studies assessing\nsitting time was recently highlighted by the recent Lan-\ncet Series on physical activity [26]. One of the potential\nreasons for the insufficient population data on sitting\ntime may be that it has been considered as a chronic\ndisease risk factor for less than a decade [27]. Moreover,\nuntil recently, there has been a lack of consistency in\nmeasurement instruments used to assess sitting time and\nhence it is difficult to compare sitting time across coun-\ntries [28]. The International Physical Activity Question-\nnaire (IPAQ) assesses self-reported sitting time. It has\nbeen shown to have acceptable reliability and validity\n[29,30] and is therefore applicable for use in population\nstudies. The IPAQ has two versions, a long and short ver-\nsion, and each have recently been used in several large-\nscale multi-country physical activity surveillance studies\nThe International Prevalence Study (IPS) of physical acti-\nvity is one of the few population studies that examined the\nprevalence and correlates of sitting time concurrently across\nseveral countries [28]. In this 20 country comparison, the\nmean daily weekday sitting time, assessed using the IPAQ\nshort version, for the overall sample (N = 49,493; age range\ndiffered from smaller scale single-country studies that have\nused the IPAQ sitting time question. For example, in a study\ntime was 421 minutes/day [33]. Additionally, a study of\nbal Physical Activity Questionnaire identified that median\ndaily sitting time was 300 minutes/day [34]. Even though\nthe IPS used a harmonized instrument, there were consid-\nerable between-country variations in sitting time [28]. For\nexample, adults within Japan and Saudi Arabia reported\napproximately double the median daily sitting (~360 mi-\nnutes per/day) than those from Portugal and Brazil\n(~180 minutes/day). Furthermore, the IPS study identified\nthat high volumes of sitting were more prevalent among\nyounger adults (18\u00ad39 years) and those with greater than\nExamining how sitting time differs across levels of phys-\nical activity may also warrant attention. For example, within\npopulations there may be sub-groups who engage in dispar-\nate patterns of sitting and physical activity. Of particular\ninterest for public health surveillance may be adults classi-\nfied as high-sitting/low-active, which reflects the combined\nrisks of sitting and inactivity. Therefore, as an alternative to\nexamining sitting and physical activity in isolation, it is of\ninterest to examine how sitting time differs according to\nphysical activity levels. However, at present few studies have\nexamined how sitting and physical activity levels differ\nwithin populations and within different sociodemographic\ngroups and across countries.\nThere is a need to report cross-country population sit-\nting data [26]. Such research is important because this will\nprovide international and national public health policy\nand health services with current sitting data for tracking\ntrends and geographical patterns of sitting time, identify-\ning `at risk' populations, and informing evidence-based ap-\nproaches to reducing sitting.\nThe primary aim of this study is to describe the preva-\nlence and correlates of daily sitting time among a large rep-\nresentative sample of adults from 32 European countries,\nand to assess between and within country variations. A\nsecondary aim is to examine the prevalence and correlates\nof high-sit/low-active populations within the sample.\nMethods\nRecruitment and participants\nThe Eurobarometer survey series, running since 1970, is a\ncross-national longitudinal study designed to compare and\ngauge trends within Europe. The Eurobarometer survey is\ntypically carried out each autumn and spring [35]. The\nEurobarometer 64.3 was conducted between November-\nDecember 2005 and assessed a number of factors, inclu-\nding health questions. Field work for the study was carried\nout by a consortium of market and public opinion re-\nsearch agencies, requested by the European Commission,\nDirectorate-General Press and Communication, Opinion\nPolls (see http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/\nfrom the Eurobarometer survey series are publicly access-\nible. With the exception of using the data for commercial\npurposes, the reproduction of Eurobarometer data is autho-\nrized [35]. The applicable EB 64.3 survey methods are\ndescribed in at http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/\nindex_en.htm. The European Commission approved the\nprotocols and written informed consent from all partici-\npants was obtained [35]. Eurobarometer 64.3 utilized a\nmultistage random sampling design in all countries, and\nall interviews were conducted face-to-face in people's\nhomes, in the national language. Computer-assisted per-\nsonal interview (CAPI) was used in countries where that\ntechnique was available and, where unavailable, paper-\nbased surveys were conducted [35].

For sitting time, a\nquestion was asked as follows: During the last seven days,\nhow much time did you usually spend sitting on a week-\nday? The weekday was chosen to reflect habitual behav-\niour for the short IPAQ instrument (www.ipaq.ki.se),\nwhich has been identified to have acceptable reliability\nand validity for assessing usual sitting time [30]. The sit-\nting data were truncated at 960 minutes/day (16 hours),\nunder the assumption that an otherwise healthy ambula-\ntory adult would be mobile for at least 8 hrs each day (e.g.\nlight-intensity walking from place to place, around the\n(0.2%) were truncated for reporting sitting >960 minutes/\nday. As shown in Table 1, the mean, median and inter-\nquartile range of daily sitting times were generally con-\ncordant across categories. Therefore, to aid interpretation\nof results, we report these sitting data as means of usual\nweekday sitting time. The sitting data were also presented\nPhysical activity was assessed using six items in the\nIPAQ short version, which asked about frequency and\nduration of vigorous intensity, moderate intensity and\nwalking physical activity. The questionnaire was scored\nusing established methods (www.ipaq.ki.se). We classi-\nfied participants into three levels of physical activity:\nhigh-, moderate-, and low-active groups. The activity\ncategory `high' given to participants who met either of\nthe following two criteria: a) vigorous-intensity activity\non at least 3 days achieving a minimum total physical\nactivity of at least 1500 MET-minutes/week; or b) 7 or\nmore days of any combination of walking, moderate-\nintensity or vigorous-intensity activities achieving a\nminimum total physical activity of at least 3000 MET-\nminutes/week. The pattern of activity to be classified as\n`moderate' was meeting either of the following three cri-\nteria: a) 3 or more days of vigorous-intensity activity of at\nleast 20 minutes per day; b) 5 or more days of moderate-\nintensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per\nday; or c) 5 or more days of any combination of walking,\nmoderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achiev-\ning a minimum total physical activity of at least 600 MET-\nminutes/week. Participants who did not meet criteria for\ncategories `moderate' or `high' were considered to have a\n`low' physical activity level (www.ipaq.ki.se). These physical\nactivity and sitting time assessments have been shown to\nhave acceptable reliability and validity [29,30].\nUsual daily sitting time was compared across the 32 par-\nticipating European Union countries. To examine whether\nsitting time varied across sociodemographic factors, sitting\ndata were compared across the following explanatory vari-\ntwo categories (18 yrs and less, and 19 yrs and over); phys-\nical activity level in three categories, (low-, moderate-, and\nhigh-active); self-reported general state of health in four\ncategories (very good, good, neither good nor bad and\nbad/very bad); and main activity in three categories:1) low\nsitting occupations (responsible for ordinary shopping,\nunemployed, unskilled manual worker, fisherman, skilled\nmanual worker and farmer); 2) mixed sitting occupations\n(student, retired, unable to work, supervisor); and 3) high\nsitting occupations (employed position at desk, general\nmanagement, employed professional middle management,\nprofessional employed travelling position, owner of a\nshop, craftsmen and service job).\nWe examined the distribution of sitting time across\nsociodemographic factors and countries among specific sub-\ngroups at the highest/lowest risk based on physical activity\nand sitting time. For these analyses, we used the three phys-\nical activity categories described above: low-, moderate-, and\nhigh-active. In parallel, the sitting data was divided into\nthree groups based on quartiles of sitting time: low-sit (low-\nest quartile: 0\u00ad211 minutes/day); medium-sit (quartiles two\nfrom physical activity level and sitting time was used to\ncategorise the sample as: 1) high-sit/low-active; 2) low-sit\n/high-active; and 3) neither high-sit/low-active nor low-sit\ntotal sample) were classified as high-sit/low-active, and\nther high-sit/low-active nor low-sit/high-active.\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were conducted using SAS software, Ver-\nsion 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows.

Also, the interquartile range and quartiles of\nsitting time were reported to reflect increasing categories of\nsitting time. Independent t-tests were used to assess\nwhether sitting time differed by gender and by education\nlevel. A one-way ANOVA was performed with Scheffs\npost-hoc test to examine whether sitting time differed be-\ntween levels of age, occupational category, physical activity\nlevel, general health and country. A Pearson's chi-squared\ntest examined whether there were differences by country\nand selected sociodemographic factors among participants\nclassified within the high-sit/low-active or low-sit/high-active\nsub-groups.

Ad-\njusted odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were\nreported for these analyses. The response variable was di-\nchotomous and indicated if a participant belonged to the\nquartiles one to three of sitting time (0\u00ad419 (minutes/day).\nThe model included the explanatory variables: gender (re-\nference = \"Male\"); education level (reference = \"18 years\nand less\"); age (reference = \"15-24 years\"); occupation ca-\ntegory (reference = \"low-sitting\"); physical activity level\n(reference = \"high-active\"); general state of health (refe-\nrence = \"very good\") and country (relative to the mean\nodds for all countries analysed). In separate logistic regres-\nsion models, we assessed the odds of belonging to the\n\"high-sit/low-active\" group and the odds of belonging to\nthe \"low-sit/high-active\" group. Except for physical activity\nlevel, the model included the same explanatory variables\nused in the previous logistic regression analyses.\nResults\nInformation on the Eurobarometer 64.3, sampling and re-\nsponse rates have been described [35].

Our\nstudy is the first, to our knowledge, to provide a com-\nprehensive comparison of sitting prevalence across a\nlarge cross-section of European countries.\nThe key finding of our analysis of the Eurobarometer\n64.3 was that IPAQ assessed usual weekday sitting time\nwas geographically distributed, with countries within\nnorth-western Europe generally reporting higher sitting\ntimes than countries situated within south-eastern Europe\n(Figure 1). Within the scope of the present study it is pos-\nsible only to speculate on the causes of this geographical\npattern. However, an explanatory factor may be the un-\nequal distribution of wealth between the more affluent\nTable 3 Percentage of sample classified as high sit/low-\nactivea or low-sit/high-activeb by sociodemographic\nfactors and by country\nHigh-sit/\nlow-active\nLow-sit/\nhigh-active\n% (n)c % (n)c\nGender\nAge\nEducation\nGeneral state of health\nUsual activity\nCountry\nTable 3 Percentage of sample classified as high sit/low-\nactivea or low-sit/high-activeb by sociodemographic\nfactors and by country (Continued)\naHigh-sit/low-active group calculated by being in the low active group\n(assessed by IPAQ) and the highest quartile of sitting group\nbLow-sit/high-active calculated by being in the high active group (assessed by\nIPAQ) and the lowest tertile of sitting group (0\u00ad211 mins/day).\nc Percentages are given relative to the proportion of total number within each\nsociodemographic factor and country.\nnorth-western countries, when compared to less wealthy\nsouth-eastern Europe countries. Wealth inequalities could\ntheoretically influence sitting time across all sitting domains\n(e.g. occupation, transport, leisure-time and household).\nWithin the occupational setting, it is likely north-western\ncountries have greater proportions of adults in white collar,\noffice-based occupations (which require greater volumes of\nsitting), and greater exposure to technology at work (e.g.\ncomputers and other labour saving devices). Moreover, un-\nequal wealth disruptions across Europe may result in\ngreater proportions of passive transport (car use). For ex-\nample, when compared to south-eastern Europe countries,\nnorth-western countries may be more likely to have build-\ning and transportation practices that require car use for\nmost trips, [36]. Within the household domain, it is also\npossible that those within north-western countries have\ngreater access to labour-saving devices and technology\n(e.g. internet, electronic entrainment) [36]. Although these\ndata were collected in a similar time-frame (November-\nDecember 2005), it is possible that climatic factors may\npartially explain differences in sitting times across coun-\ntries. For example, northern European countries tend to\nbe in the highest quartile of sitting time, where the climate\nis colder than in southern European countries where\nfewer people belonged to the highest quartile. Further-\nmore, cultural differences in interpreting sitting questions\nand reporting biases may have contributed to some of the\ndifferences in sitting time between countries [37].\nTable 4 Adjusted odds ratiosa (OR) and 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CI) of belonging to high sit/low-activeb or\nlow-sit/high-activec by sociodemographic factors and by\ncountry\nIndependent variables High-sit/\nlow-active\nLow-sit/\nhigh active\nGender (ref: male)\nEducation\n(ref: 18 yrs and less of education)\nGeneral state of health\n(ref: very good)\nUsual activity\n(ref: low sitting)\nCountry\n(ref: mean odds of all countries)\nTable 4 Adjusted odds ratiosa (OR) and 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CI) of belonging to high sit/low-activeb or\nlow-sit/high-activec by sociodemographic factors and by\ncountry (Continued)\naadjusted for age, gender, education, usual activity, general state of health\nand country.\nbhigh-sit/low-active group calculated by being in the low-active group\n(assessed by IPAQ) and the highest quartile of sitting group\nclow-sit/high-active calculated by being in the high-active group (assessed by\nIPAQ) and the lowest tertile of sitting group (0\u00ad211 mins/day).\nThe present study showed that usual weekday sitting time\namong 32 European countries was 309 minutes/day. This\ndaily sitting time was slightly lower than what was observed\nby the IPS which reported a mean sitting time of 346 mi-\nnutes/day [28]. When compared to population studies\nusing objective assessment instruments, sitting time may be\nunderestimated by self-report measurements [38,39]. For\nexample, sitting data from the IPS and Eurobarometer 64.3\nindicated that adults self-reported 5\u00ad6 hrs of sitting per\nday. However, accelerometer data from several national\npopulation representative samples has shown daily seden-\nparity between objective and subjective tools, it is not clear\nwhether the prevalence of sitting observed in this study are\nharmful to health because at present there is no consensus\namong researchers surrounding the dose\u00adresponse rela-\ntionship between sitting and detrimental health outcomes\n[43,44]. In parallel with the wide variations in physiological\nadaptations to exercise training [45], it is likely that the dose\nand volume of sitting and associated health consequences\ndiffers from individual to individual [45,46]. Moreover, the\nway sitting time is accrued within the context of a whole\nday may be important [47]. Recently, controlled laboratory\nstudies further examined the acute cardiometabolic effects\nof breaking up prolonged sedentary time [47,48]. In these\nexperiments, when prolonged sitting was displaced with\nlight- or moderate-intensity walking, there was a significant\nlowering of postprandial glucose and insulin levels [47], and\nimproved whole-body insulin sensitivity [48].\nThe adjusted analyses identified that being low-active,\nbeing in poor health and having high sitting usual activ-\nities were among the strongest correlates of reporting high\nsitting time. These findings are somewhat similar to other\nfrom the IPS [28], suggest that high levels of education are\nassociated with higher levels of sitting. This result may be\nexplained by the fact that those with higher education\nlevels may have occupations that require higher volumes\nof sitting. Although we assessed sitting time in a some-\nwhat younger population than the IPS study (EB 64.3:\n15 years vs. IPS: 18 years), both studies show a trend\nfor younger people to report higher sitting times. Potential\nexplanations may be that in contrast to older adults, a\ngreater proportion of younger adults may be students,\nover, despite younger adults having a greater amount of\nleisure time, time use studies have shown that 85-90% of\ntheir leisure time is spent sedentary [49,50]. Last, younger\nadults may be less likely to household activities (which are\noften not sedentary) [50]. These self-report data on sitting\ntime and its relationship to age are to some extent incon-\nsistent with studies using objective physical activity assess-\nment tools. For example, in the U.S. population NHANES\nshowed a linear trend, with sitting times increasing with in-\ncreasing age [13]. However, a potential explanation of these\ninconsistent findings may be the age differences of the par-\npopulation studies assessing accelerometer-defined seden-\ntary time of Belgian adults and children (n = 2,083) showed\nthat those aged between15-18 years had the highest levels of\nsedentary time when compared to other age groups [51].\nThese conflicting findings highlight the need for further re-\nsearch that objectively assesses cross-country sedentary time\nwithin population-representative samples and among a wide\nvariety of age groups.\nThe findings around sitting time and physical activity\nlevels are consistent with previous research, with the IPS\nstudy showing a similar inverse relationship between sitting\ntime and levels of physical activity [28]. This finding differs\nfrom some small-scale research using objective assessments\nof physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns. For ex-\nample, when accelerometer-assessed physical activity and\nsedentary time were examined among participants in short-\nterm exercise studies, those engaging in high levels of\nmoderate-to-vigorous exercise may compensate for high ac-\ntivity levels by being more sedentary during non-exercise pe-\nriods [52,53], resulting in no net gain in energy expenditure\n[54]. While the present study does not support this hypoth-\nesis, it may be possible that adults reporting high physical\nactivity levels may under report their sitting time. The pos-\nsible compensation for increased sitting time among adults\nwith high levels of physical activity warrants further investi-\ngation in population-representative samples. Furthermore,\nobjective assessments tools, such as accelerometers and in-\nclinometers, should be used to examine relationships be-\ntween sitting and physical activity behaviour patterns.\nHowever, population studies that implement objective phys-\nical activity assessment tools have significant cost and logis-\nA novel aspect of this study was the description of the\nhigh-sit/low-active and low-sit/high-active specific sub-\ngroups within the Eurobarometer 64.3 sample, which\nreflects the combined risks of sitting and levels of physical\nactivity. The cross-country distributions of these sub-\ngroups suggested another potential geographical pattern.\nThere was a greater tendency for adults from north-\nwestern European countries to be classified as high-sit/low-\nactive. In contrast, those within south-eastern countries\nwere more likely to be classified as low-sit/high-active.\nWhile this trend requires replication, this geographical pat-\ntern suggests that adults within north-western European\ncountries may be at risk of health consequences associated\nwith a combination of high volumes of sitting and low\nlevels of physical activity. Another observation was that\nsome countries that scored high on sitting prevalence\n(Netherlands, Denmark, West-Germany), scored relatively\nlow in the high-sit/low-active category. This seems to indi-\ncate higher levels of physical activity in these countries,\nwhich might be partly due to the good active transportation\ninfrastructure in these countries. In contrast, Great Britain\nwhich has poorer active transportation infrastructure scored\nmuch higher on the high-sit/low-active category. More edu-\ncated adults were classified more frequently as high-sit/low-\nactive, and less frequently as low-sit/high-active. These\nfindings differ from previous research examining physical\nactivity levels without relation to sitting time. Research has\nconsistently shown a positive association between increased\neducation levels and high physical activity levels [23,55]. Al-\nthough the analyses adjusted for usual activities, this finding\nmay be explained by higher educated adults employed in\noccupations that require higher volumes of sitting. Future\nstudies should continue to assess sitting and physical acti-\nvity patterns concurrently. Research examining the preva-\nlence and correlates of high-sit/low-active individuals may\nbe used to target at risk populations in intervention studies.\nStrengths of this study include the recruitment of a large\nsample of adults across a large number of European coun-\ntries. This resulted in a reasonably heterogonous sample,\nmaking it possible to compare sitting data across various\nsociodemographic factors. A further strength was the use\nof a standardised sitting time assessment instrument, which\nmakes it possible to compare the findings of the present\nstudy to future research. Limitations include the cross-\nsectional design, which makes it difficult to infer causality\nfrom the study findings. Moreover, given that the modest\nresponse rate of 54.6%, there may be limitations around the\ngeneralisability of these results. Further limitations included\nthe use of self-report measures of sitting and physical activ-\nity, which may result in social desirability and recall biases\n[56]. Furthermore, it is also possible that those who partici-\npated in the study may have different sitting patterns than\nnon-participants. Therefore, these factors might have\nresulted in the under-reporting of sitting time, which may\nsuggest our estimates of sitting time in Europe are on the\nconservative side. However, given the large sample size\nacross a wide-variety of countries, objective sitting and phys-\nical activity assessments (e.g. accelerometers and inclinome-\nters) were too difficult to implement due to high cost,\nlogistical issues and participant burden. Furthermore, des-\npite limitations around the validity of self-reported methods,\namong large samples, standardised self-report tools have a\nuse for ranking individuals sitting time and physical activity\nConclusion\nWith emerging evidence suggesting that high volumes of\nsitting may be an independent health risk factor, there is a\nneed to describe the prevalence of population levels of sit-\nting. However, large-scale multi-country sitting surveil-\nlance studies are scarce. The Eurobarometer 64.3 survey\nprovided a unique opportunity to examine the prevalence\nof sitting time among a population sample of adults from\n32 European countries. This paper identified a large vari-\nation in sitting time across European countries, with indi-\ncations that populations in north-western Europe sit the\nmost. Moreover, high sitting volumes were more prevalent\namong males, younger age groups, low-active adults, and\nthose with higher education levels. Given the recent trend\nfor technological and societal advancements across deve-\nloped and developing countries, sitting is, and will become\nincreasingly entrenched in many modern lifestyles. Regu-\nlar public health surveillance studies using consistent\nmethods and survey instruments on population sitting\nlevels should be a priority for national and international\nhealth departments.\nConsent\nThe European Commission approved study protocols and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from the partici-\npants for the publication of this report [35].\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJB designed the study, developed the research plan and conducted the\npreliminary data reduction/analysis and wrote the manuscript.
