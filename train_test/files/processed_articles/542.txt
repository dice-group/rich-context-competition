However, the literature on Multidimensional\nPoverty (MDP) presently does a poor job of acknowledging the new challenges that high-\ninformation measures of MDP present to comparative cross-contextual studies of MDP. Using\nthese more refined and data-intensive measures has the potential to reduce the ability to\nassess and compare poverty across contexts for reasons that range from mundane but\nimportant restrictions imposed by data collection and the use of secondary data sources to\nsignificant questions about the meaning, relevance, and significance of various dimensions\nto the overall assessment of poverty across contexts.\nMethodologically, differences across the data sets used in studies of MDP \u00ad in data\ncollection strategy, rigor, and substantive purpose \u00ad create a host of challenges, some of\nwhich are error-related, and others of which take on theoretical importance. Based informally\nupon our own experience in attempting to construct high-information MDP measures for\ncomparative work, the relationship between the number ofindicatorsusedin an MDP measure\nand the availability of that measure (or taking it to the next level, of any measures of a given\ndimension) in all study areas is a negative one. In short, the likelihood that all relevant\nmeasures exist across all comparison contexts is low, and any success in obtaining such a\nmatch is due mostly to good fortune rather than systematic coordination.\nThis creates an unpleasant choice for researchers: forego cross-contextual comparisons\nof MDP altogether due to a lack of suitable data, or accept a largely unknown degree of\nbias due to the omission of important variables or dimensions of poverty in one or more\nsites. Of further concern is the likely possibility that specification and measurement of MDP\nexhibit a dependency on context rendering cross-contextual comparison difficult even with\ncomplete substantive coverage in the data. Much more work is needed to address these\nissues systematically, particularly the empirical exploration of context-dependence with\nhigh-information MDP measures. In this paper, we suggest an approach which represents a\ncompromise between the two options described above.\nWe address the methodological challenges of comparing high-dimensionality MDP\nmeasures across contexts through the identification of multidimensional profiles (so-called\n\"extreme profiles\") of poverty and well-being that are determined through a hybrid process\nthat incorporates both data reduction and researcher judgment rather than pure, or na\u00efve,\ndata reduction strategies. Once these extreme profiles exist, we proceed to use fuzzy logic\nto assign whole or partial membership to each profile for every unit in the sample for each\nsample of comparative interest (GUEDES et al., 2012). The result is a summary measure of\nrelative well-being that allows for the differential contribution of specific dimensions to the\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\noverall measure of well-being, both across samples and within samples. Known asvagueness,\nthis property enables us to move from seeking strict cutoff points to identifying gradations of\nWe address the theoretical challenge of cross-contextual poverty comparisons using\na sequential process in which we sort all available measures of poverty for all contexts of\ninterest into two groups. The first, termed plenary measures, consists of all those measures\nof any dimension of poverty that are available for all contexts. The second, termed idiomatic\nmeasures, consists of all additional measures which are unique to one or more contexts or\ndatasets. We then construct two models of poverty \u00ad one which includes only the plenary\nset and a second which includes both the plenary and the idiomatic indicators. Doing so\nenables us to identify the effect, within a single context, of moving from a lower-information\nto a higher-information (site-specific) measure of MDP on overall MDP estimates within that\ncontext. While this approach still does not enable us to determine the level of poverty in\nother contexts under the counterfactual scenario in which these other factors were measured,\nit does serve as a rudimentary form of sensitivity analysis, capable of alerting researchers\nto instances in which comparative statements are not supportable, or in need of careful\ninterpretation and scrutiny.\nIn the analysis that follows, we identify a large set of plenary poverty measures (P) and\nan equally large set of idiomatic poverty measures (I) for two distinct contexts: \u00ad one in\nNortheastern Thailand and a second in what is known juridically in Brazil as \"Legal Amazon,\"\nUsing a Bayesian approach, we determine that the best fitting models are indeed those\ncontaining the most parsimonious set information (in our terminology, the models including\nvariable set \"P\", the shared measures). Indeed, on a wide range of important and policy-\nrelevant individual measures, the observed relationship is robust to the use of either model\nP +I or model P, suggesting that stronger comparative statements based upon model P may\nbe acceptable, with the standard caveats about unmeasured variables and their complex,\nqualitative association with the shared indicators. In our example, we find the pattern is\nconsistent for a variety of forms of capitals, ranging from financial to human to social, and\nfor a variety of livelihood activities. The methodology also enables us to quickly assess which\nfactors display a common distribution across contexts and which show a more complex\nrelationship. These results represent a major first step in the unraveling of the relationship\nbetween contexts generally and MDP using high-information measures.\nOur suggested approach seeks to overcome three important limitations of the current\nempiricalandmethodologicalliterature on MDP: 1) we derive our scalar measure ofwell-being\nfrom multi-thematic survey data at the local level, taking a bottom-up like perspective on how\nfamilies experience deprivation in its multiple dimensions; 2) we focus on the ability of our\nMDP scalar to be robustto cross-contextualcomparisons, and3) our MDP measure represents\nan alternative to other proposed scalars at the household/family level, such as the Family\nDevelopment Index (FDI) or the Human Poverty Index (HPI) (BARROS; CARVALHO; FRANCO,\n2003, 2006). Instead of directly adding up variables independently and then assigning a\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nweighting scheme, as done in the FDI and HPI indices, we depart from the observed, data-\ndriven multivariate correlation structure of well-being dimensions at the household level to\nthen compare itto a theoreticalpattern ofwell-being.Thisiskeyto tackling the problem ofhow\nto assign the weighting structure of a summary scalar: instead of creating a post-estimation\nweight matrix, we use the distance of the multivariate correlation structure from the real data\nto this theoretical pattern as the weighting scheme.\nWe begin in Section II by drawing attention to the lack of studies attempting to make\nquantitative cross-contextual comparisons of MDP using highly dimensional measures and\nbriefly summarizing the literature on MDP assessment. Section III presents our fundamental\nframework and describes the specific contexts, data, and methods employed. The case\nstudies used in this article are intended to test the robustness of our approach. Thus, we\nspend more time in this section describing the limitations of current literature on MPDs\nand how to tackle them by combining different methodologies and theoretical approaches,\ninstead of focusing on a rich description of the Altamira and Nang Rong contexts. Descriptive\nresults are reported in Section IV. We conclude in Section V with a discussion of the future\nof cross-contextual examinations of MDP, and offer additional practical suggestions\nto researchers struggling to colonize the middle ground between the rich, single-site\nexaminations and the fairly shallow cross-contextual comparisons that characterize the\npresent state of MDP research.\nBackground\nCross-contextual comparisons of multidimensional poverty\nResearch identifying independentdimensionsofpovertyandconstructing summarymulti-\ndimensional poverty (MDP) measures constitutes a large and diverse literature (KAKWANI;\nSILBER, 2008a; 2008b). Such research benefits from improved depth and breadth of\npoverty-relevant survey research in recent decades across a wide range of contexts (BETTI et\nal., 2005). But despite the greater availability of secondary data sources supporting detailed\npoverty assessments, the MDP literature as a whole displays a reasonably strong bifurcation.\nOn the one hand are numerous studies using large multi-thematic datasets to construct\nhigh-information, high-dimensionality poverty measures (e.g. BELLIDO et al., 1998; LUZZI\net al., 2008; RAMOS et al., 2008). The chief price paid for such detailed measurement is\nreduced external generalizability, a limitation acknowledged in many of these single-context\nstudies. At the other extreme are comparative studies of poverty across contexts (e.g. CHEN;\nCROSS, 2009). While these also compare poverty multidimensionally across a large sample\nof contexts (most often, nations), they rely upon a much smaller number of dimensions and\nspecific indicators. The latter are also generally carried out at the macro-level, which while\nshedding light on certain aspects of the poverty experience may simultaneously leave other\naspects of MDP, including cross-scale interactions, hidden or obscure.\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nBetween these extremes lies a challenging task: developing the methodology and the\nsupporting datasets needed to make cross-contextual comparisons of multidimensional\npoverty based upon high-information measures of MDP. To better demonstrate this\nbifurcation in the literature, and the corresponding gap, we undertook a survey of recent\nempirical studies of MDP. We selected a recent peer-reviewed edited volume (KAKWANI;\nSILBER, 2008b) and supplemented it with additional articles found using ISI and JSTOR\nsearches on the term \"multidimensional poverty\". In all, we examined 21 studies between\n2004 and 2008 that measure multidimensional poverty using various methodologies \u00ad\nlatent class, fuzzy set, structural equation, and axiomatic approaches. Figure 1 presents\nour classification of these studies according to two measures: 1.) the number of unique\nindicators used in each MDP measure, and 2.) the number of unique contexts over which the\nMDP measure was employed. The pattern that emerges is an abundance of low-information,\nhigh-comparison studies and many high-information, low comparison studies. There is\nlittle activity in the \"middle territory\" representing high-information and many-comparison\nstudies of MDP (Figure 1). Given the continued importance for both policy and scientific\naims of the comparison of poverty \u00ad degrees of poverty, shares of the impoverished\npopulation, and rankings within and across context \u00ad we find this observation about the\ncurrent literature troubling.\nTwo paths to more information-rich comparisons charted atop cross-classification of recent MDP\nA\n!\"\nContexts Compared in Analysis\nIndicators Used in Analysis\nCross-Contextual\nComparisons of\nHigh-Information\nMDP Measures\nB\nSource: Based on 21 published articles on multidimensional poverty (see references for specific articles).\nSuperimposed on Figure 1 are two possible paths forward to high-information cross-\ncontextual comparisons of MDP, labeled \"A\" and \"B.\" Path A corresponds to enlarging\nthe scope of current cross-contextual comparisons to include additional measures. The\nchallenge with this approach is the extreme difficulty in obtaining reliable data on additional\ndimensions of poverty for the full sample of countries used in such studies. In all likelihood,\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\ncurrent studies of this type (e.g. CHAKRAVARTY; SILBER, 2008) may already be approaching\nthe upper bound on the number of poverty indicators it is possible to compile for many\ndozens of countries at around 5 or 6 (typically GPD per capita, expenditure estimates, life\nexpectancy at birth, food expenditure estimates, and literacy rates or school enrollment\nlevels). Path B represents, for us, a more tractable set of challenges. This path corresponds\nto increasing the number of contexts involved in high-information MDP comparisons.\nDoing so requires that we address a number of concerns, discussed in detail in the\nfollowing section.\nTheoretical obstacles to cross-contextual comparisons of MDP\nDepth studieshelp usto understandthe dimensionalstructure ofMDP in specificcontexts,\nandprovide detailedunderstanding ofitsconstituentelements. Buttheyprovide questionable\nbasis for cross-contextual comparison on a theoretical level. Chief among these is that not all\nentities that contribute to well-being are A.) monetizable or B.) commensurable. To become\nmonetized, a service, object, or other valued entity must have its value to potential users\nfixed with reference to a monetary unit of account, such as dollars, pesos, or conch shells.\nDespite centuries of attempts to fix value in human societies to a single base unit, many\nvalued entities that influence both subjective and objective measures of MDP remain non-\nmonetized, for example: a.) the value of child care and housework when provided by family\nland that has been passed down over generations (CARNEIRO 2001; VANWEY; CEBULKO,\n2009; VANWEY; GUEDES; D'ANTONA, 2011), or c.) the monetary value of scholarly advice\nand editorial services rendered between colleagues (PRENDERGAST; STOLL, 1996). Even if\nthe monetary value of such entities can be determined in principle, there are several reasons\nwhy researchers should be cautious in doing so. In cases like those above, humans generally\nare not simply lacking the ability to monetize a good or service, but actively resisting such\npecuniaryvaluation in deference to cultural norms, mores, and social institutional restrictions\nthat researchers are wise (if not ethically bound) to honor.\nThe challenge imposed by monetization and commensurability is especially important\nwhen one wants to study material rural well-being. In rural settings, the possession of money\nmay be of little importance for certain goods and services, for whose markets are imperfect\nor nonexistent. Reciprocity rules are a good example of quasi-economic institutions that\npromote well-being among rural households without the need to assess traditional market\nfor tangibles, such as food, clothing or farm work (BEBBINGTON, 1999; DE SHERBININ et al.,\n2008). Place-specific capital is also ignored as an important component of well-being in most\nMDP measures, such as HDI, which focus exclusively on formal educational attainment. In\nthis regard, an urban-bias among current aggregate MDP indices seems to prevail.\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nJust as important, humans also continue to stubbornly impose a complex web of non-\neconomicvaluations and concerns overtop of exchange transactions.These protectedvalues\n(BARON; SPRANCA, 1997) restrict the range of goods and services that are commensurable,\nand raise concerns about how to quantify values that humans themselves actively resist\nquantifying. These concerns are both ethical and pragmatic. Ethically, if a respondent states\nthat no monetary price can or should be affixed to vital services rendered by friends and\nfamily, it may not be justifiable for the researcher to assign monetary value to them anyway.\nPragmatically, in avoiding attaching an arbitrary monetary value to various constituent\nelements of well-being, we encounter commensurability in a different form. In a specific\ncontext like Altamira, Brazil, for example, land is valued based upon many complex factors,\nonly some of which are directly monetizable, and to complicate matters further, land is not\nbought and sold with a regularity sufficient to establish a reliable price standard for land.\nYet the natural capital embodied in the land is a central component of household well-being\nin this context (GUEDES et al., 2012). Thus, the practical challenge is how to include land\nin a measure of MDP along with per capita income, for example, without forcing the value\nand contribution of the former to be artificially computed in the units of the latter. One\napproach is to explicitly reject single-unit calculations of wealth. Such approaches, while\navoiding the need to make financial capital and natural capital directly commensurable,\nare limited by the difficulty in making overall comparisons across units of analysis when\neach unit may have multiple differing \"scores\" for poverty \u00ad one for each class of valued\nentities assessed.\nAn alternative approach is to consider each indicator as having an underlying distribution\nof some sort and calculate the position in that distribution for each subject. By \"adding up\"\nthe relative positions of subjects on each dimension, one comes closer to a measure of MDP\nthat assesses the value of a bundle of goods, capitals, and other valued entities that are not\nstrictlycommensurable.Thisapproach hasbeen proposedbyBrazilian researchersatthe IPEA\nInstitute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Both the Family Development Index(FDI) and\nthe Human Poverty Index (HPI) render summary multidimensional scalars of poverty at the\nfamily/household level that are easily collapsed up and down to different levels of interest\n(BARROS; CARVALHO; FRANCO, 2003, 2006). Although representing an important advance\nto previous multidimensional indices, such as the HDI (UNDP, 1990), such an approach still\nfails to consider the interactive potential of a household possessing sufficient amounts of\ntwo capitals, such as land and labor, that provide much greater levels of wealth and well-\nbeing in conjunction with each other than separately. That is, the weighting scheme applied\nto these scalars lacks the ability to capture the joint functioning of multiple dimensions that\nare frequently idiosyncratic to each household.\nOur answer to this problem is to utilize Grade of Membership (GoM) modeling, which\nbelongs to a class of latent class models which can simultaneously consider the relative\nposition of a household on each distribution and assign that household an overall score\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nof belonging to each of a set of \"extreme profiles\" measuring MDP. These profiles articulate\nthe specific responses given by a hypothetical model household that would be considered\nas impoverished or as wealthy as possible. Our resulting measure, the distance between\na household and each extreme profile, represents not an absolute measure of total\nassets, well-being, or poverty, but rather a relative measure which can be interpreted\nas a household's (or other unit's) location on a distribution of distances from \"maximal\nwealth\" or \"maximal poverty.\" Importantly, the vagueness of a fuzzy approach to poverty\nmeasurement ensures that the relative contribution of each separate constituent member\nis permitted to vary across households and across contexts. If land ownership, for example,\nrepresents a different relationship to total MPD in two different research locations, this\nmethod permits the accurate estimation of the contribution of land to MDP in each location,\nwhile maintaining overall comparability. In the next section, we describe this approach in\ngreater detail.\nIn addition to incorporating a flexible weighting scheme, allowing for the structure\n(composition) of the household's portfolio of capitals in each context, our tentative\nmethodology seeks to address an \"urban bias\" present in other MDP measures, basing our\nreference group (the maximum well-being profile) on solid theoretical frameworks, such as\nthe livelihood strategies approach as well as the capital portfolios' perspective. This way,\nan important part of the methodological proposition relies on identifying what defines a\nreference group. As a heads-up, we alert for the need to adapt the theoretical comparison\ngroup in urban contexts, for instance, when some of the capitals may reach high levels of\nincommensurability or contextual irrelevance.\nData and methods\nData and context\nWe selected two sites at different stages of transitioning from frontier to established\nagricultural regions to illustrate our approach (VANWEY; HULL; GUEDES, 2013). Nang Rong\nDistrict, Thailand, began to witness dramatic population growth attributable to an influx of\nfrontier settlers in the 1950s. Altamira, located in the Brazilian state of Par\u00e1 on the threshold\nof the Amazon, also experienced a large influx of settlers following the opening of the Trans-\nAmazon highway in the 1970s. In both cases, extensive field work has been paired with\nlongitudinal data collections to produce a detailed picture of relative household poverty\nover time (for detailed descriptions of methodology, see RINDFUSS; ENTWISLE; WALSH,\nVANWEY; GUEDES; D'ANTONA, 2011; GUEDES et al., 2012 for Altamira). As a result, we have\ntwo socioeconomic survey instruments which have undergone extensive field-testing over\nmany years to improve the validity of individual items and the overall breadth of domains\nrepresented in the questions.\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nIn our Altamira study site, 402 households and farm properties were sampled.\nThe stratified sample of farm units by cohort of settlement is representative of the\nfarm units in the region. Both heads of the households were interviewed, along with\nany other females aged fifteen and over. Males responded to an economic and land\nuse questionnaire, while females answered questionnaires covering family socio-\ndemography, reproductive history, and the use of contraceptive methods. For poverty\nmeasures using multidimensional variables, we restricted our sample to the 1997/1998\nowners who had complete information on income and additional selected characteristics\nIn our Nang Rong study area, we use data collected during the year 2000 non-\nagricultural season. A complete census was conducted in 92 villages. Household\ninterviews were conducted with key informants on a wide range of subjects, including\ndemography, life histories for some household members, migration histories, economic\nmeasures, agricultural production, and land use. Community-level interviews were carried\nout with key informants in every village in the district, which were used to construct some\nmeasures in the present analysis. In total, 8,583 out of 8,638 households provided\nusable responses for this analysis.\nSelecting indicators\nRecent research suggests that a hybrid approach to constructing MDP measures\ninvolving both systematic data reduction and expert judgment can be as effective as\nunsupervised methods alone (ALKIRE, 2007). We use a hybrid approach focused on\nindicators rather than dimensions in order to remove measurement errors that may be\nintroduced by differing linkages between indicators and dimensions. To do so, we begin\nby grouping all indicators from each dataset into two categories. The first, termed plenary,\nor shared, poverty measures (P), includes all poverty indicators existing in all datasets\nwhich also have relevance in all contexts. The second, termed idiomatic, or unique, poverty\nmeasures (I), are all other poverty indicators of interest which are not available for all\ndatasets or relevant in all contexts.\nBoxes1 and2 listthe plenaryandidiomaticindicatorsusedin thisanalysis. Box1 isa side-\nby-side comparison of indicators judged to be similar enough to allow for a direct comparison\nacross study sites. Box 2 lists all indicators for which no corresponding measure is available\nin the other dataset. The existence of such idiomatic measures is likely to be common when\nworking secondarily with two or more data sets collected for different purposes in different\ncontexts. While it is extremely important that researchers continue to press for new multi-\ncontext, multi-thematic datasets, the abundance of single-site multithematic datasets makes\nthe development of a methodology capable of supporting the measurement and analysis of\nMDP with existing data an important goal.\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nPlenary measures of multidimensional poverty (model P) used for Nang Rang, Thailand (2000) and\nLevel Measure: Nang Rong Measure: Altamira\nOrdinal Educational attainment of the household\nhead\nEducational attainment of the household\nhead\nDichotomous Sex of the household head Sex of the household head\nDichotomous Child with parent absent in the household Child with parent absent in the household\nDichotomous Multiple household on the same property Multiple household on the same property\nOrdinal Demographic dependency ratio of the\nhousehold\nDemographic dependency ratio of the\nhousehold\nDichotomous Household has at least one refrigerator?

We estimate two models, first\nwith only the plenary poverty measures (P), and second incorporating variables from both\nthe plenary and the idiomatic sets of indicators (P +I). This procedure allows us to compare\nMDP between contexts using the plenary measures common to both contexts, while enabling\nus to determine the effect of excluding the idiomatic poverty measures from the first model.\nThe latter provides an answer to the question of what happens to MDP within context as the\nset of indicators used in measurement is altered, essentially a sensitivity test that conditions\nthe nature, strength, and generalizability of the conclusions drawn from the first set of cross-\ncontextual comparisons. This comparative framework is summarized graphically in Figure 2.\nFramework for comparison of multidimensional poverty across contexts\nPlenary Indicators\nPlenary Indicators +\nIdiomatic Indicators\n(1) Metrics: Mean MWB, FGT (0,1,2), Inequality (Gini, Mehran, Piesch), Lorenz Curve, % MDP by Indicators.\nContext A Context B (Context C)\nSensitivity Tests\nCross Contextual Comparisons\nSource: Authors' elaboration.\nWe expect that in many contexts the results of the first (P) and second (P +I) models will\ndiverge in non-trivial ways. This is an important consequence of using this approach. When a\nresearcher requires the most accurate measurement possible of poverty in a single context,\nnumerous existing approaches may prove adequate. But if the aim is to understand the\ninteraction of context and poverty measurement, then our simple heuristic may be of great\nvalue in helping researchers to identify potentially invalid comparisons. In the absence of\na single, common metric for the determination of all value, the best one can do is compare\nthose thingsthatare common first, andthen attemptto gauge the impactofadding in the rest.\nGrade of Membership modeling applied to multidimensional scalars\nWe utilize Grade of Membership (GoM) modeling, a fuzzy logic methodology (MANTON;\nWOODBURY; TOLLEY, 1994), to generate a single continuous measure of the extent to\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nwhich a household is multidimensionally poor, while avoiding the direct commensuration\nof various household assets. To do this, we compare empirical profiles of each household\nin each sample to theoretical profiles of maximal well-being, generating a measure of the\ndistance between the household's lived experience and a sociological ideal type of maximum\nwell-being (GUEDES; CARMO, 2012; GUEDES et al., 2012). Following Garcia; Soares-Filho;\nSawyer (2007) we call this approach the hierarchical latent scalar approach, differing from\na traditional exploratory latent class approach where profiles of well-being would freely arise\nfrom empirical correlation structure of the data.\nInstead of using initial random probability matrices for the locational parameters\nestimation within GoM environment, as done is most of the applied literature (SAWYER; LEITE,\nprofiles, K = 2, where for each variable, j, in profile k =2, the category representing the most\nwell-off, will receive probability equal to one (kjl\n= 1,000), and zero for the others. For profile\nk= 1 the opposite is done, that is, for the least well-off category of a variable j, the probability\nequalsone andzero for allthe others.With thisstrategy, the fuzzypartition parameter (gik=2\n, or\n) measuresthe observedmultidimensionalintensityofwell-being for each individual\nin the sample. An example of such a matrix is presented in Table 1. Once the fuzzy partition\nis estimated, we use it as the empirical function of multidimensional well-being. We use\nthis function to estimate various traditional poverty and inequality indices, which hold the\nsame axiomatic properties as the original measures, but are based on a multidimensional\nscalar rather than monetary income.\nExemplifying the hierarchical latent scalar approach for multidimensional well-being estimation \u00ad\ninformed hierarchical latent probability matrix (kjl\n) using educational attainment of household head\nVariable Unconditional\nProbability Hierarchical Latent Probability (kjl\n)\nEducational Attainment of the Household Head\n(Nang Rong, Thailand)\nSample\nPopulation K = 1 K = 2\nSource: Based on Nang Rong Survey Data (2000).\nMultidimensional poverty and inequality assessment\nWe use three summary measures of poverty and two measures of inequality in order\nto assess differences between models P and P+I. FGT (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke) metrics\ncorrespond to a set of indices based on headcounts and poverty gaps. These indices are\nwidely applied in poverty studies and used to measure several aspects of poverty such\nas proportion, intensity and severity (STEWART, 2006). Instead of substitutes, they can be\nseen as complementary, since they respond to different aspects of poverty (FOSTER; GREER;\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nTORBECKE, 1984; HOFFMANN, 1998).The three FGT measures used are: the headcount ratio\n(HC), the poverty gap index (PGI), and the squared poverty gap index (PGI). FGT measures are\ntraditionally used to estimate poverty based on per capita income level, but we extend them\nto our scalar measure of multidimensional well-being in order to assess both the change\nin MDP levels using model P and P+I and the distribution of composite well-being across a\nvariety of individual indicators.\nWe applytwo ofthe mostcommon income inequalitymeasuresin the empiricalliterature:\nGini and L Theil. Gini coefficient can be derived from the synthetic well-being distribution or\nfrom the Lorenz Curve. Gini coefficient graphically represents the increase in the cumulated\nproportion of income due to the cumulated proportion of population over the i-th person.The\ncloser to unity, the higher the inequality of the population (DORFMAN, 1979). Interpretation\nof LTheil is similar to the Gini coefficient, although it has a wider range of scalar variation and\nis bound to 0 and infinity. The closer to zero, the lower the inequality is. Different from Gini,\nL Theil is not applicable to households with no income (HOFFMANN, 1998).\nPlotting proportions of poor across the range of key variables\nOnce the summary MDP measures are calculated for models P and P+I, we plot the\nproportion of households in each sample that are considered multidimensionally poor\nover a ranges of individual indictors. Doing so enables us to quickly assess changes in the\nrelationship between overall MDP and individual components for multiple contexts when\none moves from the ideal site-specific model (P+I) to one appropriate for cross-contextual\ncomparisons (P). This lets us answer the question of how the relationship between the\nindividual indicator and the overall MDP measure changes when the total amount of\ninformation in the model is altered. To guide interpretation, we introduce a three-part\nheuristic, summarized in Figure 3. The first possibility is no observed change in the level or\ndistribution of poverty across a variable's range comparing models P and P+I. This indicates\nthat inclusion of additional variables in model P+I has no impact. The second scenario is\na change in the levels of poverty across different levels of a variable, without a change to\nthe functional form of the distribution. This implies that it is defensible to talk about the\npatterned relationship between MDP and that variable in a comparative sense using\neither model, so long as numerical comparisons of poverty are avoided. The third class\nconsists of variables for which both the level and the overall shape of the distribution\nof MDP across levels of a given variable change markedly between models P and P+I.\nFor this group, the extra dimensions and information included in model P+I are highly\ncorrelated with other variables in model P, introducing bias when they are omitted and\nfundamentally altering the conclusions reached about the relationship between that\nvariable and overall MDP.\nThis process yields a determination about which of these three conditions holds for each\nkey variable. If the first holds, then one can generalize about both levels and patterns for\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nthat variable across contexts. If only the second is true, some generalizations across context\nstill make sense, but only those that pertain to general patterns. Generalizations about the\nlevel of poverty in this case are unreliable because the estimates of poverty levels are highly\nsensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of factors that are highly specific to that single context.\nIf the third obtains, no generalizations are warranted, as both the level and the pattern of\nrelationships between specific variables. In this case, additional qualitative investigation\nis called for to understand how the intersection of dimensions affects the overall poverty\nexperience (LAWSON; MCCKAY; OKIDI, 2006).\nGeneralized patterns of response to inclusion of idiomatic poverty measures\n\u00ad +\nLevel of Variable of Interest\n+\n\u00ad +\nLevel of Variable of Interest\n+\n\u00ad +\nLevel of Variable of Interest\n+\nMeasures\n) No change ) Change in Level ) Change in Pattern\nProportion of Sample MDP\nProportion of Sample MDP\nProportion of Sample MDP\nSource: Authors' elaboration\nResults\nModel fit\nTable 2 reports fit statistics for each model. It is important that we confirm the\nimproved fit of model P for both contexts according to the AIC. Decreased model fit in\nthe higher-information model indicates that idiomatic information for each context is not\nadding valuable additional explanatory power to the selected indicators available in both\ncontexts (that is, in model P). In substantive terms, model P+I represents a redundant\nset of estimates in comparison with model P, adding an excessive amount of information\nto the core of compared measures. This redundancy arises from two main sources of\nnoise: a) imperfect proxies for a specific dimension; b) the existence of a more complex\ncorrelation structure between the shared and unique measures within context that is\nnot being fully represented by the empirical measures, requiring qualitative scrutiny. To\nbetter understand the numerical nature of this degradation as additional information is\nadded, we look at what happens to the estimates for each of the FGT measures and the\ntwo inequality measures.\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nModel K N L  G P LN(L) AIC\nComparing levels of MDP and inequality\nFigure 4 presents estimates for the FGT measures by model and context. In Nang Rong,\nhead count poverty estimates jumps from 20 percent to 23 percent when one moves from\nthe idiomatic to the plenary model. Despite the change in absolute terms, the proportion\nof poor is quite similar for both models. In Altamira, the same jump is more substantial \u00ad\nfrom 22 to 34 percent, implying that idiomatic measures may have a greater influence on\nestimates of poverty in Altamira than in Nang Rong.The same pattern is seen with the PGI and\nsquared-PGI. As previously suggested, the sensitivity to levels and patterns may be reflective\nof various sources of noise: a) imperfect proxies, b) more complex correlational structure of\ndimensions than the one expressed by the survey-based measures. A similar result obtains\nfor the Gini and L Theil measures of inequality, except that the greater increase from model\nP+I to model P occurs in Nang Rong, where inequality on the Gini measures jumps from\n0.24 to 0.33 when one moves to the lower information model. The corresponding jump in\nBased on the AIC coupled with results from Figure 4 and Figure 5, we can conclude that\nuse of model P will lead to a more efficient, parsimonious, and conservative picture of poverty\nand inequality, since it satisfactorily summarizes the structure of well-being with the shared\nmeasures, at the same time that it avoids bias from limited information about the source of\nidiomatic noise. The sensitivity test supports our stated intention of determining whether any\nconclusionsaboutpovertyanditsassociationwithspecificfactorsofinterestmaybewarranted\nacross multiple contexts. The potential for interaction between context-specific indicators of\npoverty and our overall measure renders the comparison of models containing substantially\ndifferent idiomatic measures potentially suspect, a classic apples-to-oranges comparison if\never there was one.\nDespite thesupportfortheplenarymodelaccordingtotheAICstatistics,wewanttoassure\nthattheoverallfitholdsforspecificindicatorswhencomparingmodelsPandP+I.AICisasgood\nas the quality of information provided to the model.

These selected variables enable us to take a rapid summary view across each of\nthese five capitals in two contexts and observe the extent to which the choice of model\nimpacts the observed relationship. Generally Figure 6 provides little support for the\nconclusion that interpreting the lower-information model (gray lines) would result in a\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\ndifferent set of interpretations from those obtained using the optimal model (black lines).\nIn some instances, as with natural capital measure in Altamira, we do observe a shift in\nthe estimated level of poverty for each quintile group. But the shift occurs across the\nboard and appears to show no more complicated interaction with this measure of area\nused for agriculture.\nThe observation that the functional forms of MDP distributions across variables are\nconsistent between models permits us to interpret these patterns substantively. One piece of\ncontextual information that is extremely relevant for interpreting these results in both sites\nis that the Nang Rong study site occupies a later stage of a general frontier transition than\nthe Altamira research area (VANWEY; HULL; GUEDES, 2013). Interpreting the present results\nin light of this observation, natural capital displays a simple monotonic positive relationship\nwith well-being (proxied by area in agriculture). This is consistent with a broad literature\nciting the significance of natural capital in frontier contexts. Physical capital as proxied by\nirrigation investments shows a similar relationship, with households that possess irrigation\nequipment showing lower levels of MDP. Moving to social capital as proxied by the number\nof migrants remitting cash or goods, however, we observe another interesting difference.\nWhile households with more migrants display a greater level of multidimensional well-being\nin Nang Rong, those households in Altamira with the greatest level of well-being occupy an\nintermediate set of values on the number of remitting migrants. The data suggest important\ndifferences in the significance and success of migration as a strategy for poverty alleviation\nin these two sites, with Nang Rong presenting a more mature and integrated frontier with\ngreater opportunities for migrants. Discrepant patterns are likewise evident across sites for\nfinancial capital (per capita income) and human capital (education attainment of household\nhead). While each incremental increase in the quintile of per capita income is associated\nwith a reduction in the proportion poor for Nang Rong, in Altamira the association takes a\ncurvilinear form. Among households in the lowest quintile of financial capital we observe\nlower overall levels of MDP than for the next two higher quintiles. This observation again\nspeaks to the youth of this frontier context, in which it is possible for households to achieve\nwell-being in the absence of large stocks of financial capital.\nWe can conduct the same sort of analysis using a second set of measures that\nroughly proxy a variety of significant livelihood strategies in both contexts. As with\nFigure 6, we are limited to the plenary set of indicators. From this set, we selected four\ntheoretically interesting livelihood practices and one additional measure that proxies\nthe stage of the household lifecycle (MCCRAKEN et al., 2002). These four livelihood\npractices \u00ad off-farm labor, operation of a small business or market stall, livestock raising\n(large stock like cattle), and participation in the monetized labor exchange economy\nrather than relying upon in-kind exchange \u00ad represent prominent (and often interlocking)\nstrands in complex and diverse livelihoods in both the Thailand and Brazil study site, but are\nnot exhaustive. In Nang Rong, perhaps even more than Altamira, households engage in a\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nwide array of occupations, pursuits, and enterprises directed at obtaining greater well-being\nlivelihoods is challenging because of the temporary and fleeting nature of some livelihood\npractices (RIGG, 2003), but where the impact of livelihood diversity on development has been\nexamined, the effect of greater diversity has been positive in contexts similar to Altamira and\nNang Rong that are or were historically agricultural (ELLIS, 1998). The long-term investment\nrequired to successfully incorporate these practices in a household livelihood strategy and\nthe involvement of multiple broad capital classes in their execution makes them useful as\nindicators. As one example, the use of paid labor for the rice harvest in Nang Rong requires\nnumerous adjustments by households who must acquire sufficient cash for payments, setting\nthem on a very different path of household labor allocation, economic activity, and livelihood\ncompatibility than those exchanging labor in kind (HULL, 2010).\nProportion MDP over range of key capitals, plotted by context and model (gray = P, black = P+I) \u00ad Nang\n-\nto to +\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nto to +\nModel P Model P+I\nEducation of Household Head\nNang Rong, Thailand\n-\nModel P Model P+I\nHousehold Per Capita Income\n-\n+\nModel P Model P+I\nNumber of Remitters\n-\nModel P Model P+I\n-\n+\nModel P Model P+I\nAltamira, Brazil\n(continue)\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\nIrrigation/Water Diversion\n-\nModel P Model P+I\nArea Used for Agriculture\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nModel P Model P+I\nProportion MDP over range of livelihoods, plotted by context and model (gray = P, black = P+I) \u00ad Nang\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nModel P Model P+I\nInvolved in O -Farm Employment\nNang Rong, Thailand Altamira, Brazil\n-\nHousehold Operates Small Business\nNumber of Livestock Owned\n(conclusion)\n(continue)\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\n< >\nModel P Model P+I\n-\nNo Yes\nModel P Model P+I\n-\n< >\nModel P Model P+I\nUses Some Paid Agricultural Labor\nHousehold Demographic Dependency Ratio\nA broad pattern of consistency across models is observable with these livelihood\nmeasures, suggesting that generalizations about the relationship of overall MDP with these\nselected indicators are again supported. We do, however, observe changes in the level\nof estimated poverty across the range of many of these variables, making it necessary to\nrestrict the interpretation to statements about the general pattern of association between\neach livelihood strategy and overall MDP if we want to be conservative. All four livelihood\nfactors \u00ad involvement in off-farm employment, ownership of a small business, participation\nin livestock raising, and the use of monetized agricultural labor \u00ad represent alternatives\nto a traditional smallholder subsistence livelihood. Thus, it comes as no surprise that we\nobserve a comparative reduction in MDP among households that are involved in these\nlivelihoods in both Thailand and Brazil. In each case, the effect of including additional\ninformation in model P+I is to attenuate slightly the magnitude of this improvement,\nsuggesting that a more nuanced measure of poverty reveals additional routes to well-being\ncompared to a more limited measure. A similar pattern is apparent in Nang Rong, though\nthe degree of the mitigation is slighter. The demographic dependency ratio, our proxy of\nhousehold lifecycle stage, displays a consistent pattern of increasing MDP levels as the\nshare of dependents relative to working age individuals increases. However, the greatest\ndecline in well-being associated with dependency ratio occurs at lower levels in Nang Rong\nthan in Altamira, indicative of contextual differences in how such demographic burdens\ntranslate into poverty.\nIn all, differences across contexts may be reflective of multiple causes: context, levels of\ncommensurability and monetization, protectedvalues, stage of frontier development. Rather\nthan a causal model of MDP, our proposal methodology, empirically illustrated with two\nagricultural frontiers located in different time scales over frontier development, represents\n(conclusion)\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\na way to picture overall differences and similarities that can only be fully understood by a\ndeeper exercise of contextual characterization. In any circumstance MDP summary measures\ncan be meaningfully compared without a close eye on temporal and spatial characterization\nof the territories of poverty and inequality.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nWe have presented a frameworkfor comparison of micro-level MDP across different social\nand economic contexts. Our systematic approach enables researchers to compare relative\nMDP levels among households in settings where the constituent elements of household well-\nbeing may not be identical, as long as there is some shared set of common measures. With our\nmethodological strategy, researchers compare a model that uses the full extent of information\nabout each locale to a more limited model that can support useful comparative inferences. We\nbelieve our approach innovates in three important ways: 1) by deriving a synthetic scalar of\nwell-beingfrommulti-thematicsurveydataatthelocallevel,takingabottom-uplikeperspective\non how families experience deprivation in its multiple dimensions; 2) by rendering an MDP\nmeasure robust to cross-contextual comparisons, and 3) by providing an alternative to other\nproposed scalars at the household/family level, such as the Family Development Index(FDI) or\ntheHuman PovertyIndex(HPI),thatdo notexplicitlyincorporateabuilt-insensitivityanalysisor\ncross-site comparison and are tied to the arbitrariness of a weighting structure of dimensions.\nOur methodological strategy is not intended to replace existing approaches to poverty\nmeasurement and analysis (what we term depth and breadth approaches), but rather to\nprovide researcherswith a meansofmaking meaningfulhigh-information comparisonsacross\nrelevant contexts of interest. Because our method incorporates built-in sensitivity analyses,\nit helps direct attention to the nuances and qualifications that are often necessary when\nmaking valid cross-contextual comparative statements.\nOur primary concern in this paper has not been the explanation of poverty, or even simply\nthe measurement of poverty, though both of these are related. Instead, we have attempted to\nopen the door to improved studies of the influence of context on poverty measurements. As\nwe have shown, such cross-contextualcomparisons can providevaluable generalizationsthat\nsupport both policy refinements and the development of other types of theory. In particular,\nour emphasis on the returns to various sorts of assets, whether human capital, physical\ncapital, social capital, or others, advances ongoing efforts to characterize development and\nhousehold well-being in frontier contexts, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Our\napproach allows us to gauge in a more precise, quantitative way the strength of comparative\nstatements about MDP, explicitly addressing strategies to deal with commensurability and\ncomparability under contextual, idiomatic noise.\nOur approach also encourages researchers to use site-specific knowledge derived from\nmultiple methods \u00ad quantitative and qualitative \u00ad to inform the process of constructing MDP\nmeasures rather than relying solely on data reduction techniques. While this may seem at\nRebuilding Babel\nHull, J.R. e Guedes, G.\nfirst glance to open the door wider to subjective bias, we argue that the present approach\nto MDP is already rife with subjectivity which becomes readily apparent when one attempts\ncomparative work. Judgmentisroutinelyexercisedanytime research foci are chosen, measures\nare selected, or concepts are mapped onto indicators. While the most effective strategy for\nachieving better comparative measurement of MDP must obviously include systematization\nof these earliest stages of research planning and execution, particularly between studies, a\npragmatic approach is also needed in the present moment that enables researchers to take\nadvantage of the many large datasets already in existence. Vital to the usefulness of any\nsuch approach is that it must focus attention directly on the limitations of existing sources\nof data and indicators used in assessing MDP, which our approach does explicitly, opening\nthe door wider to the high-information comparative study of MDP cross-contextually while\npreserving scientific integrity.\nReferences\nALKIRE, S.

Em primeiro lugar, estimou-se\numa medida multidimensional de pobreza, baseada em l\u00f3gica nebulosa, para duas \u00e1reas de fronteira\nagr\u00edcola: Nang Rong, na Tail\u00e2ndia, e Altamira, no Brasil. Para que a compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre os contextos\nfosse poss\u00edvel, uma segunda estimativa foi obtida, utilizando-se um subconjunto das medidas\npresentes nas duas \u00e1reas de estudo. Os resultados sugerem que o padr\u00e3o de resposta em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a\nv\u00e1rias caracter\u00edsticas-chave \u00ad por exemplo, educa\u00e7\u00e3o, renda e raz\u00e3o de depend\u00eancia demogr\u00e1fica \u00ad \u00e9\nrobusto \u00e0 especifica\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo. Conclui-se que generaliza\u00e7\u00f5es comparativas, \u00fateis na formula\u00e7\u00e3o\nde pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas que sejam custo-eficientes quanto \u00e0 interven\u00e7\u00e3o em contextos distintos, poderiam\nser identificadas em diversas situa\u00e7\u00f5es. Mais genericamente, a presente abordagem fornece aos\npesquisadores e gestores de pol\u00edticas um arcabou\u00e7o que possibilite entender a intera\u00e7\u00e3o do contexto\ncom a constru\u00e7\u00e3o subjetiva de bem-estar.
