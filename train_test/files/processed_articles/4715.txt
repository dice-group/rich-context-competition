This question is not as trivial as it may seem at\nfirst. Drawing is one of the earliest visuomotor tasks that humans mastered, arriving well before writ-\ning (at least 40,000 BCE against 3200 BCE) and perhaps emerging around the time at which language\nevolved. This order of appearance is also seen in child development, where young children start to\nlearn handwriting by drawing the letter's shape, but with practice the drawing and the writing pro-\ncesses become dissociated, with writing becoming more automated (e.g. Adi-Japha & Freeman, 2001;\nFeder & Majnemer, 2007). Drawing and writing both require a fine motor control, so why do many\npeople master writing but fail at accurate drawing? One key difference is the amount of time spent\nlearning to write versus learning to draw. While most children in developed countries spend many\nhours learning to write, only a subset extensively practice their drawing skills. What are the conse-\nquences of this extensive training? Does it alter the way a trained draftsperson sees the world, creating\na more photorealistic perception? Or does training leave perception unaffected and instead change the\nrobustness of the representations of objects and scenes, creating more stable codes for complex object\nstructure just as master chess players create stable codes or chunks, for complex chess configurations\nThe motivation for our study derives from Cohen and Bennett's (1997) description of three fac-\ntors that contribute to better drawing accuracy: motor coordination, the perception of the model, and\nthe selection of the relevant, to-be-drawn object's features. These authors ruled out coordination as a\nfactor because both artists and non-artists had equally accurate hand movements in a tracing task. The\nsecond factor--more veridical perception by artists of the to-be-drawn object (e.g. \"the innocent eye\"\nof Ruskin, 1912)--can also be ruled out. Initially, it was reported that individuals with better drawing\nskills saw objects more veridically, that is, they were less affected by size or shape constancies (Cohen\ntheir size constancy task). However, many failed to show that artists' perceptual judgments are veridi-\ncal (McManus, Loo, Chamberlain, Riley, & Brunswick, 2011; Ostrofsky et al., 2012, for their shape\nfound no differences between artists and non-artists in size, lightness, and shape constancies. Indeed,\nThe artist's advantage: Better integration of object\ninformation across eye movements\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 381\neven across studies reporting a link between drawing skill and ability to discount visual constancy,\nthe reduction in visual constancy (ranging from 0%, Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2011, to 5% to 10%,\nOstrofsky et al., 2012) is far from the 100% reduction required if visual artists had indeed a veridical\nperception of the object as suggested by the innocent-eye hypothesis (Ruskin, 1912; see also Perdreau\n& Cavanagh, 2013, for a discussion of this point).\nIf neither motor coordination (Cohen & Bennett, 1997; Kozbelt, Seidel, ElBassiouny, Mark,\nPerdreau & Cavanagh, 2011) explains the artists' advantage, which leaves the third factor (Cohen &\nBennett, 1997): the selection and representation of the relevant object structure. Indeed, recent studies\nreport that more skilled artists reproduced significantly more junctions in a drawing task than novices\n(Kozbelt et al., 2010; Ostrofsky et al., 2012), suggesting better knowledge of what must be selected\nfrom the object to produce an accurate drawing. However, although the selection of the relevant fea-\ntures is a necessary step, it is not the only requirement. What may be more important is the representa-\ntion of the spatial relations between these features, as these relations underlie the object's structure and\nHere again, studies have provided evidence for this advantage for spatial relations in artists. For\ninstance, artists are better and faster at encoding complex sets of lines than novices (Glazek, 2012) and\nalso better at recalling complex Rey-Osterrieth figures after relatively short delays (30 s; McManus\net al., 2010). In these tasks, the object's structure must be encoded and also maintained in memory.\nThese abilities repeatedly come into play during a drawing task as the object is processed sequentially\nover numerous gaze shifts between the object and the drawing (Cohen, 2005; McManus et al., 2010).\nInterestingly, Glazek's study (2012) found that more skilled subjects tend to have more motor output--\ndraw more--than novices during the same fixation duration, whatever the object's complexity. This\nsuggests that drawing accuracy might be related to the ability to encode more structural information\nfrom a single fixation. However, in Glazek's study, participants were free to scan the entire object\nwhile drawing it and could thus encode information present in both central and peripheral vision.\nThese studies show the importance of selection and representation of spatial relations but they did not\ncompare the relative contribution of these two components.\nThe present study addresses the role of these two processes to examine whether an artist's advan-\ntage lies in (1) the ability to construct a robust, global representation in visual memory (visual chunks)\nacross fixations or (2) the encoding of larger spatial extent of the object's structure on each fixation\n(visual span). To do so, we designed two experimental tasks using a gaze-contingent moving window\nand a gaze-contingent moving mask that controlled the amount of visual information available from\ncentral and peripheral vision (e.g. Geisler, Perry, & Najemnik, 2006; Rayner, McConkie, & Zola,\n1980). In the first experiment, the moving window only allowed the participants to see the center of\ntheir vision field (window radius varying from 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0), the surround being masked. Participants had\nto identify, within a limited time, whether the stimuli were structurally possible or impossible objects\n(see Figure 1 for examples). However, making such a decision requires either seeing the entire object\nor building up a mental representation across individual glimpses, for both possible and impossible\nobjects share the same local features (vertices and junctions; e.g. Biederman, 1987; Soldan, Hilton, &\nStern, 2009). If the artist's advantage is explained by the ability to build and maintain a more robust\ndescription of an object's structure, then they should be able to perform better with sparser inputs,\nconstructing an internal model of the object from smaller samples (i.e. smaller window sizes). In other\nwords, they may have access to more complex and robust codes for objects--bigger chunks (e.g.\nChase & Simon, 1973)--that allow them to hold more complex structures in memory as they build\nup a representation from small samples. In contrast, our second experiment was identical except that\nit used a gaze-contingent central mask (from 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 of radius) that left the surround visible. The\nmotivation for this task was to evaluate whether training and skill in drawing lead to better integration\nof structural information in peripheral vision. This increase in integration area on each fixation might\nbe developed in order to process the global structure of an object while focusing on the local features\ncurrently being drawn, allowing them to be more appropriately placed relative to the overall structure.\nIf this is the case, both experienced and skilled participants should be able to integrate information\nacross larger visual spans (e.g. Rayner, 1998; Reingold, Charness, Pomplun, & Stampe, 2001) and be\nmore tolerant of this central scotoma.\nTo foreshadow our results, our data support the idea that the artists' advantage lies, at least in part,\nin a better integration of the visual information picked up from different locations as the eyes move over\na scene (experiment 1) but not in a better integration of that information across space (experiment 2).\nMoreover, we show that this advantage increases monotonically with the experience in drawing, and\nto a limited extent with drawing skill when foveal information is available.\n2 Experiments\nIn two experiments, participants determined whether a test object was structurally possible or impossi-\nble while viewing the figure through a gaze-contingent window of various sizes (experiment 1) or with\na central scotoma with various sizes (experiment 2). To evaluate the ability to integrate object structure\nfrom across fixations and across space, we compute a critical window size that led to 75% correct\nresponses. By correlating the estimated critical window size and scotoma size with drawing skill and\nexperience, we examined whether artists can better construct an accurate memory representation of\nthe test object from smaller samples.\nAll the experiments used the same apparatus. The participant's head was always held by a chinrest\nso that his or her eyes were approximately 57 cm from the center of the screen. The stimuli were\nprojected on a 22-inch CRT screen, with a resolution of 1024  768 pixels and with a frame rate of\n120 Hz. The experiments were programmed in MATLAB using the Psychophysics and Eyelink Tool-\nan Apple computer.\nParticipants' eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracking system (Eyelink 1000 monocu-\nlar, 35-mm lens) at a 1000-Hz sampling rate. The eye tracker was always calibrated for the partici-\npant's dominant eye. Finally, eye movement events and saccades were parsed using the Eyelink 1000\nalgorithm (saccade acceleration threshold 5 9500 deg/s\u00b2, saccade velocity threshold 5 35 deg/s).\nThe majority of the possible and impossible objects were taken from the studies of Schacter, Cooper,\nDelaney, Peterson, and Tharan (1991) and Soldan et al. (2009), used with the authors' permission\n(Figure 1). The rest of the objects were designed by one of the authors (PF). In order to avoid any\nambiguities about the objects' nature, we first asked 20 independent observers, not participating in\nthe experiments, to judge all the line drawings as structurally possible or impossible. We specifically\ninstructed them, according to Schacter et al.'s procedure (1991), that each object's edges were neces-\nsarily represented with lines, that surfaces were flat and could only face a single orientation, and that\nFigure 1. Examples of possible and impossible objects used in the two experiments.\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 383\nthe drawings represented solid and 3D objects. The 20 independent observers saw all the objects in\na random order. For the main experiments, we only kept the objects that had an inter-observer agree-\nment of 95% or better, leaving 85 possible objects and 66 impossible objects. However, we used\ntwo random subsets that were different across the experiments. These subsets had 30 objects of each\ncategory. Objects were distributed among the trials so that they were repeated three times within the\nsame experiment, but never in the same orientation and never with the same window size. The objects'\npictures were presented at 21\u00b0  21\u00b0 of the visual angle and were centered on the screen.\n3.3Gaze-contingent display\nIn the \"moving window\" experiment, the gaze-contingent display was a circular, fully transparent area\nwith a diameter that was the independent variable, whereas it was a circular, fully opaque area in the\n\"moving scotoma\" experiment. Their position was continuously updated and centered on the subject's\nfixation location provided by the eye-tracking system. We measured the effect of window and mask\ndiameter on task performance with eight different sizes ranging from 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 in radius (1\u00b0, 1.5\u00b0, 2.1\u00b0,\n2.6\u00b0, 3.1\u00b0, 3.7\u00b0, 4.2\u00b0 and 5\u00b0) in the \"moving window\" experiment, while the scotoma radius ranged\nTwenty-six participants were tested (mean age of 28.3  1.9 years, 11 males, 15 females). Twenty-\nfour of the participants ran in both experiments. One participant ran only in the first experiment and\none only in the second. All the participants were informed of the experiment's purpose and risks,\nand all gave their informed consent before starting the experiment. Finally, all participants were paid\n20 euros for the entire session. The characteristics of participants are described in Table 1.\nFor convenience in this article, we have referred to our more skilled and trained participants as\nartists even though there is no real definition for \"artist\" or \"visual art,\" and clearly drawing accuracy\nalone does not make someone an artist. Nevertheless, using this very general label is not unreasonable,\nfor drawing is a common task in many different artistic activities (e.g. illustration, movie or dance; for\na discussion of this point, see Seeley & Kozbelt, 2008).\nEach experiment included 9 blocks of 20 trials each, and began with a practice block of 8 trials. Each\nblock was preceded by a calibration of the eye movement monitor. The first block served as a baseline,\nwhere the objects were fully visible, while the eight other blocks used the gaze-contingent window.\nExcept for the presence of the window, the procedure was identical for all the blocks.\nEach trial started with a fixation dot at a randomly chosen location within the image. The subject\nhad 1 s to fixate it for 250 ms. After this fixation test, the gaze-contingent display (Figure 2) appeared\ncentered on the fixation dot's coordinates. The participants had to report whether the object was struc-\nturally possible or impossible as fast as possible by pressing the appropriate key (\"L\" if possible, \"S\" if\nimpossible). The display only remained for 10 s, and participants had to give their response within this\ntime. In the cases where the participants did not, a new screen appeared asking them to give a response.\nWe tested eight window sizes in addition to the full-view condition tested during the first block\n(\"baseline\"). There were 20 trials per window size, 20 trials for the baseline condition, and thus\n90 trials per object category (possible and impossible), for a total of 180 trials.\n3.6Evaluation of drawing skill\nParticipants'drawing skills were evaluated, first with a short set of questions about their drawing expe-\nrience and then with a drawing task where they had 15 min to make a pencil drawing of a 31\u00b0  21\u00b0\ngray-scale photograph of an octopus (the same as used by Kozbelt et al., 2010). The participants were\ninstructed to copy the original as realistically and accurately as possible, that is, without emphasizing\naestheticism and creativity. They were allowed to use all the drawing techniques they knew and to\nerase and correct their drawing as many times as they needed. Once the 15 min were over, the model\ndisappeared from the screen.\nTo score the subject's drawing skill, we asked eight independent judges, blind to the participants'\nidentities, to evaluate the accuracy and the realism of the productions.Accurate drawings respected the\nmodel's proportions, the position and shape of the shadows, and details of the texture. During the judg-\ning, the drawings were presented on a computer screen simultaneously with the model. In a first step,\nthe raters could look at all of the drawings, without making a decision, to get an idea of the range of\nTable 1. Participants. Some of our participants were or are following a formal\ntraining in visual arts (reported in the \"School\" column. Years of experience\ncorresponds to full years of weekly training. \"Years of experience\" was set to\n0 for participants with no training in drawing. The \"Rating\" column reports\nmean rating that participants obtained in our drawing task. Handedness is\nreported as follows: \"R\" for right-handed, \"L\" for left-handed. Finally, in the\n\"Gender\" column, \"F\" and \"M\" correspond to female and male, respectively.\nName Age Handedness Gender School Experience Rating\nskills (Figure 3). Then, in a second pass, the drawings were presented in a random order and the judges\nrated each on an 8-point scale (1 for a very low accuracy and 8 for the best accuracy). This ratings\ncycle was repeated five times with the drawings in a new random order each time. All the judgments\nwere consistent within and between the raters (Cronbach's ; intra-: 0.94  0.01; inter-: 0.97).\nThe mean of the judges' ratings was taken as each participant's drawing score (Table 1).\nThe data of the two baseline blocks (unobstructed, full view of the line-drawn objects) were pooled\ntogether (from both experiments 1 and 2), giving 40 baseline trials. Participants who did not reach 75%\ncorrect responses in the baseline condition were excluded from the analysis (n 5 3). However, in the\nfirst experiment, one subject's behavior strongly deviated from others and could reasonably be consid-\nsubject reached the 75% criterion in the baseline condition, she never exceeded 50% correct in the test\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 385\nconditions, seriously skewing her threshold value. In the following section, we will present the results\nwithout this subject but, overall, this had little effect on the results. Consequently, 21 participants were\nincluded in the first experiment's analyses and 22 participants in those of the second experiment.\nWe used two approaches to evaluate the influence of drawing skill and years of experience: (1)\nwe took their drawing skill and self-reported years of experience in drawing as indexes to correlate\nwith their performance; (2) we split our participants into two groups, separately accordingly to their\ndrawing rating (skilled vs. unskilled) and their years of experience (trained vs. untrained). For drawing\naccuracy, participants were considered as unskilled if their rating was smaller than the median of all\nratings, whereas were taken as untrained participants who had no experience in drawing.\nTo measure the critical window and scotoma size in the possible versus impossible task, we\nplotted each participant's performance against the size of the viewable area. Psychometric curves\nwere then fitted (Figure 4) with Weibull functions using a maximum likelihood method (Prins, 2012;\nfor the first experiment's fits, and of 8.43 (SE: 1.11) for the second experiment's (all p values 0.05).\nThe participant's critical window and scotoma size were both defined as the viewable area leading to\n75% correct responses. In both experiments, reaction times decreased as performance increased with\nFigure 2. Trial procedure. (a) The trials started with a fixation dot appearing at a random position. Once the\nparticipant fixated it for 250 ms, the gaze-contingent window appeared, allowing the participant to only see the\ncenter of his or her vision (except in the baseline block, where the stimuli were fully visible). The participant had\nto respond, as fast as possible, whether the partially hidden object was structurally possible or impossible. If the\nparticipant did not respond within 10 s, the object and the window disappeared and were replaced by a screen\nasking him or her to give a response. (b) In experiment 2, the procedure was similar to that of the first experiment,\nexcept that we manipulated a gaze-contingent moving mask (scotoma) that blocked central vision.\nWe then plotted each participant's critical window size and critical scotoma size against his or her\ndrawing score and separately against his or her years of drawing experience. Because the distribution\nof our data violated assumptions of bivariate normality, we used a non-parametric, rank-based Spear-\nman's correlation to evaluate the relationship among these variables (p-values are adjusted for multiple\ncomparisons with a Holm\u00adBonferroni sequential procedure; Holm, 1979). The confidence intervals of\nthe correlation coefficients were computed with non-parametric bootstraps (10,000 runs) and we used\nthe percentile method for the confidence interval computation (DiCiccio et al., 1996).\nIn the \"central window\" experiment, we found (Figure 4) a significant negative correlation\nas well as a significant, negative correlation between the critical window sizes and self-reported years\ncant is not very surprising since drawing scores and experience were also strongly correlated [r(19) 5\nscotoma\" experiment, no significant correlation was found between critical scotoma size and either\nSimilar results were found when comparing the participants in groups for both drawing accuracy\nand experience.

However, despite insignificant correlations between critical scotoma sizes and both experience\nand drawing accuracy, the group comparisons show a significant advantage for more skilled partici-\nThese results suggest that increased drawing practice and drawing skill are related to increased\nability to integrate object structure from smaller samples of foveal information (experiment 1). Is\nthere any difference between the contribution of drawing practice and drawing skill in this task?\nFigure 3. Examples of hand drawings made by the participants during the drawing task. Drawings presented in\nthe lower row are those judged as less accurate, while the upper drawings were judged more accurate.\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 387\nTo compare the two correlation levels--for years of experience and for drawing score, which are\nthemselves correlated--we used Fisher's Z transformed correlation coefficients (Meng, Rosenthal, &\nRubin, 1992). We found no significant differences between these correlation coefficients in the first\nexperiment [rratings\nOne simple explanation of the link between years of practice and better performance with smaller\nwindow sizes in the first experiment is that participants with more drawing practice were just better\nFigure 4. (a) Scatter plots of the subjects' critical window size against subjects' years of experience and drawing\naccuracy. We first fit Weibull function to each participant's proportion of correct response and we took the critical\nwindow size as the size leading to 75% correct response (the left panel shows an individual fit). We then correlated\nparticipants' critical sizes to their experience and drawing rating (right panel, top row). We found a significant\nnegative correlation between the subjects' critical window size and their amount of training as well as with their\ndrawing skills (dotted lines are 95% confidence interval of the regression line). Similar results were also found\nwhen comparing groups of participants made accordingly to levels of skill and of experience (box plots in the\nright panel, bottom row; error bars are 95% confidence intervals of the means). This effect cannot be attributed\nto age, which was not correlated with critical window size, or to a better knowledge of what is an impossible or a\npossible object, represented by how subjects performed in the baseline condition, which was not correlated with\nyears of experience. (b) Scatter plots of the subjects'critical scotoma size. We did not find a significant correlation\nbetween the participants'critical scotoma size and either their amount of training or their drawing skills.

Nevertheless, we again checked the possible contributions of\nsecondary variables and, as in experiment 1, we found no significant correlations between age and\ncritical scotoma size or between baseline performance and years of experience [age: r(20) 5 0.13\nWe next analyzed possible learning effects. Our test objects were presented three times with differ-\nent rotation angles in each experiment, and some of them already appeared fully visible in the baseline\ncondition. Since it is known that visual artists show an advantage in recalling complex figures after a\ndelay of 30 s (McManus et al., 2010), it is possible that our results could be due to a learning effect that\nwould be greater in more skilled subjects. To test this hypothesis, we computed the participants' mean\nperformance for each block of trials and we ran a linear regression for each individual to determine if\nthere were any improvements across blocks in either experiment. Participants' slopes were on aver-\nHowever, when correlating individual regression slopes against participants' experience and drawing\naccuracy separately, we found no evidence of a greater learning rate in more skilled participants with\nthe critical central window size in experiment 1 [ryears\nFinally, we examined whether there was any performance advantage for the 20 of 60 objects that\nwere seen in the baseline condition and then seen again in the subsequent central window and scotoma\ntest conditions.

This suggests that in the presence of a moving scotoma, more experienced and\nmore skilled subjects took more time when less peripheral information was visible. However, this had\nno effect on these participants' performances, since we found no correlation between critical scotoma\nsizes and either experience or drawing accuracy.\nFinally, mean reaction times were not correlated to participants' drawing experience in either\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 389\nThe correlation between drawing score and reaction time in the first experiment baseline condition is\nonly marginally significant but it suggests that more skilled (but not more trained) participants took\nless time to categorizing possible versus impossible objects when they were fully visible.

This might suggest that more skilled participants are indeed faster at encoding complex set of lines\n(Glazek, 2012). Whatever the case, this reaction time advantage for skilled participants was no longer\nseen when the stimuli were partially visible.\nWe next analyzed whether artists used different strategies to explore the test images and that could\nexplain the better performances of our skilled and experienced participants in our tasks. We began by\nFigure 5. (a) Mean reaction times (RTs) against the viewable area sizes (baseline excluded) for the first experiment\n(central window).

However, none of the correlations between either years of experience and draw-\ning ratings with mean fixation rates was significant in either experiment [all P 0.05].\nNext, we analyzed the fixation patterns from the full-view conditions, where participants could\nmake saccades toward visible features, to see if they revealed any strategy for classifying the objects\nthat might differ with experience and drawing accuracy. We constructed fixation maps for every object\nand classified each fixation as falling on (within a 1\u00b0  1\u00b0 region; gaze position accuracy: 0.15\u00b0)\nempty space, a line segment (but not a junction) or a junction (using Harry corner detector, Harris\n& Stephens, 1988, and Canny filter, Canny, 1986, to define these features).

Subjects' fixation coverage was computed using Wooding's\nprocedure (Wooding, 2002) on fixations made in the test conditions (baseline excluded). We found no significant\nlink between subjects' fixation coverage and their years of experience or the ratings of their drawing.\nFinally, we examined whether more trained and skilled participants were more efficient in placing\ntheir eye movements in order to sample a larger extent of the image in each trial. To do so, we com-\nputed how much of each image landed on participants'foveas as they scanned the image in the moving\nwindow conditions (experiment 1, baseline excluded), using Wooding's procedure (Wooding, 2002).\nWe counted only the 2\u00b0-diameter foveal area for each fixation (dcrit\nered on average 4.1% (SE: 0.1) of the test images (Figure 7b) and the extent of coverage did not differ\nbetween novices and either the more skilled or more trained participants [drawing skill: t(19) 5 1.32\nAltogether, these results provide no evidence for different fixation patterns between skilled or\nexperienced subjects and novices. This suggests that the better performance found in more trained and\nskilled participants may be due to a more robust internal representation rather than a different pattern\nof visual exploration.\n5 General discussion\nThis study investigated whether drawing skill and years of practice in drawing lead to a more efficient\nanalysis of objects and scene organization. Making a drawing requires an accurate integration of the\nto-be-drawn object's features in order to reproduce it in proper proportion. Our hypothesis was that\ntraining would (1) increase the size of the integrated object structure (larger visual chunks) and (2)\nimprove the ability to encoding information from a larger extent of peripheral vision (larger visual\nspan). To test these hypotheses, we designed two experiments using a gaze-contingent moving win-\ndow and moving scotoma that controlled the amount of information available in central and peripheral\nvision, respectively. Our participants had to categorize line drawings of objects, seen through these\ncentral or peripheral samples, as either possible or impossible.\nThe results of experiment 1 demonstrated that both the number of years of drawing experience\nand drawing accuracy reliably predict better performance in the identification of an object's structure\nfrom small foveal samples. This result was not explained by the participants' age or by overall skill in\ndiscriminating possible from impossible objects. Our first hypothesis was confirmed.\nIn addition to improving the integration of sequentially acquired samples from central vision,\ntraining might also improve integration over larger spatial areas in each fixation. This larger visual\nspan should allow accurate performance even with larger amounts of central vision blocked out. How-\never, when we varied the size of a moving central mask in our second experiment, we found no signifi-\ncant correlation between the participant's experience in drawing or drawing scores and their critical\nscotoma size. Our second hypothesis was not confirmed: we found no evidence that the artist's training\naffects the efficiency in the use of peripheral information.\nMoreover, we found no significant difference in the fixation patterns of our participants. The more\nskilled and trained subjects did not fixate salient features (junctions or vertices) more frequently nor\ndid they scan a larger extent of space during each trial to see more of the object. In the absence of any\nstrategic differences in scanning the images, our results suggest that the artists' advantage must be in\nthe representation of the information sampled from the partial images.\nAlthough we found a relation between drawing experience and skill and the performance in our\ntasks, it still remains unclear what is acquired when learning to draw. Our tasks were perceptual, so\nwe are unable to assess the contribution of changes in motor coordination in our findings. Moreover,\ndrawing accuracy and drawing experience shared about half of their variance, so that we are not able\nto conclude whether this advantage for more trained subjects is the result of training or simply a pre-\nexisting, innate ability that led them to pursue drawing. Despite this ambiguity, we favor the effect\nof practice as a source of improved performance in our experiments. We have two reasons for this:\nfirst, performance was more correlated to years of experience than drawing skill itself; and years of\nexperience is an imperfect measure of the choice of a career in art since many in our population are\njust starting their training. Moreover, it has been shown that children's drawing skill is improved by\ntraining and by learning drawing rules (Rand, 1973), suggesting that experience--the time spent at\npracticing--may play a crucial role in developing drawing skills.As hypothesized by Gombrich (1960),\nlearning explicit rules is indeed a first step in the acquisition of drawing skills, but it has to be embod-\nied through practice, thus becoming an implicit visuomotor knowledge or schema. Nevertheless, to\nArtists better integrate object information across eye movements 393\nshow that training causes the improved performance in our tasks, we would need longitudinal training\nexperiments that control for the subjects' initial drawing skill.\n5.1Visual integration and drawing\nIf the artists'advantage arises from a better integration of visual samples into a more robust representa-\ntion of object structure, how is this related to the demands of drawing? Several studies have examined\nthe contribution of object representation to drawing skills (Cohen & Bennett, 1997; Glazek, 2012;\ncoherent representation of an object to make an accurate copy of it and that \"coherence\" might be spe-\ncifically tuned to the requirements of reproducing it. For example, Kozbelt et al. (2010) and Ostrofsky\net al. (2012) have shown that people more skilled in drawing selected and reproduced more structural\ninformation (e.g. vertices and junctions) than those who were less skilled. The relevant structural\ninformation must also be combined with accurate spatial relations between elements. While construct-\ning a drawing, these spatial relations are built up across many sequential eye movements, where local\nsamples of the original scene are independently encoded at every fixation location (Coen-Cagli et al.,\n2009; Locher, 2010). Consequently, a key requirement for constructing an accurate representation of\nthe objects in a scene must be to integrate these local samples, spaced appropriately according to the\nsize of each eye movement and this integration must require a representation that is robust enough to\nretain its accuracy during this building process. Our results showed that participants with more train-\ning and better accuracy in drawing are indeed better able to integrate samples of information across\neye movements. Constructions of robust representations have been observed in expert chess players\nwho develop robust representations of the structure of the chess pieces (Curby, Glazek, & Gauthier,\narise from the ability to represent more complex sets--or chunks--of relevant visual information\nobtained from small local samples. In particular, while creating drawings, the artist is continually\nfocusing on small portions of a scene in order to reproduce it patch by patch, all the while keeping\ntrack of the larger organization of the object and the scene in order to place each element appropriately\n(Coen-Cagli et al., 2009; Tchalenko & Miall, 2008). Over thousands of hours of training, we suggest\nthat this particular style of attention to the scene leads the artists to develop robust representations that\nare optimal for the step-by-step production of the drawing and the motor planning of hand movements.\n"
