The causes of the ongoing obesity epidemic are\nnot well established and despite the great economic and health\ncare significance of the obesity epidemic there are relatively few\nlongitudinal population-based data examining this issue. At the\nmost basic level weight is the end-product of energy consumed and\nenergy expended. Physical activity is the only modifiable variable\ncontributing to total energy expended and can be segmented into\noccupational (i.e., work-related) and non-occupational or leisure-\ntime physical activity.\nUsing a variety of data sources and statistical modeling there have\nbeen a number of papers suggesting that increased food intake is\nlargely, if not completely, responsible for the obesity epidemic [3\u00ad5].\nOne of the arguments to support this hypothesis is that time spent in\nleisure-time activity has remained unchanged in recent decades\nleading to the conclusion that it is solely excessive caloric intake that\nhas led to the present predicament. Even though the stability of\nleisure time activity argument is not compelling for a variety of\nreasons not to be examined here, the time spent in leisure-time\nphysical activity represents a relatively small portion of the total hours\nin a week. Importantly, occupational physical activity has an even\ngreater potential to have a significant impact on total caloric\nexpenditure. While a common assertion is that occupational physical\nactivity has decreased in recent decades, to our knowledge this has not\nbeen examined in detail, nor have changes in occupational physical\nactivity been associated with changes in mean body weight or the\nprevalence of obesity [6].\nUsing nationally representative data sources we examined\ntrends in occupational physical activity during the past 5 decades\nand explore how these trends relate to changes in mean body\nweight and the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. Having a better\nunderstanding of the relative importance of occupational physical\nactivity in the ongoing obesity epidemic should help in the\nformulation of a comprehensive evidenced-based plan, with\npolicies, strategies and tactics to combat this continuing problem.\nMethods\nThe prevalence of obesity (body mass index $30.0 kg/m2) in\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\n[7,8]. NHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability sampling\ndesign to select participants who are representative of the civilian,\nnon-institutionalized U.S. population. Sample weights are as-\nsigned to each individual to represent the U.S. population and\nallow for the development of national prevalence figures. The\nprevalence of obesity for each examination period was age-\nadjusted by the direct method to the year 2000 U.S. Bureau of\nWe chose this age group because it has the highest percent of\nemployed individuals for both men and women [9]. The National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) ethics review board approved\nthe original survey protocols, and informed consent was obtained\nfor all NHANES participants.\nEmployment data were derived from the Current Employment\nmonthly survey of businesses and government agencies conducted\nby State employment security agencies in cooperation with the\nBureau of Labor Statistics. The survey provides employment,\nhours and earnings estimates based on payroll records of business\nestablishments dating back to 1939, but is limited to nonagricul-\ntural industries. Occupations are broadly categorized as goods-\nproducing or service providing. Goods-producing further sub-\ncategorized into mining-logging, construction and manufacturing,\nwhile service-providing occupations are further divided into the\ncategories of trade (whole sale and retail), transportation/utilities,\ninformation, financial services, professional/business services,\neducation/health services, leisure/hospitality and other. Agricul-\ntural employment data were derived from the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) which is a monthly survey of households conducted\nby the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The\nCPS provides a comprehensive body of data on the labor force\nincluding employment, unemployment and persons not in the\nlabor force. While CPS has agricultural employment data dating\nback to1940, it only has detailed occupation and industry data\nMedian, minimum and maximum physical activity intensity\n(Metabolic Equivalents: METs) were assigned to each occupation\nbased on previously published classification schemes [11]. Industries\nwere then categorized into physical activity intensity groups based on\nthe median METs value. The intensity categories were sedentary (,2\nStatistical Analyses\nThe prevalence of individuals in specific occupations by year\nwas calculated by dividing the number of individuals in a given\noccupation by total U.S. occupations in private industry from CES\ncombined with total agricultural occupations from the CPS for\nthat year. The prevalence of individuals in sedentary, light, and\nmoderate intensity category industries was calculated for each\nyear. Mean occupational-related METs for each year were\ncalculated as follows: the number of individuals employed in each\noccupation was multiplied by the median METs for the\noccupation with the product for each occupation added together\nand the sum divided by the total number of employed individuals\nfor that year. To estimate daily occupation-related physical activity\nenergy expenditure we assumed an 8 hour work day, used the\nwomen and 76.9 kg for men) and used the mean MET value for\neach year with the formula: daily caloric expenditure = hours\nEnergy Balance Differential Equation Model\nTheoretical predictions of weight gain as a result of changes in\nenergy expenditures were computed using a validated energy balance\ndifferential equation model for weight change [16,17]. The model is\nderived from the first law of thermodynamics and predicts weight\nchange resulting from changes in energy intake and energy\nexpenditures. The predictions account for weight dependent changes\nin energy expenditure through specific formulations of weight\ndependent terms for physical activity and resting metabolic rate.\nIn order to compare model predictions to the NHANES data, we\ndetermined the average weight gain in kg per kcal decrease in energy\nexpenditure resulting from the trends in occupational activities.\nSpecifically, after decreasing energy expenditures by increments of\nactivity, the model was simulated until steady state was reached. The\npredicted change in weight per decrease in kcal/d energy expenditure\nwas determined by averaging the three ratios of the change in steady\nstate weight per 50 kcal/d. From the model men gain 0.090 kg for\nevery kcal of energy expenditure decrease and women gain 0.092 kg\nfor every kcal of energy expenditure decrease.\nResults\nThe top panel of Figure 1 depicts the prevalence of service\noccupations, goods producing occupations and agricultural occupa-\nagriculture occupations there has been a decrease over the last 5\ndecades while there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of\nservice occupations (p for trend,0.001 for each). Within the goods\nproducing occupations (middle panel), construction has been relatively\nconstant (p trend=0.5) while there has been a large decrease in the\nprevalence of manufacturing and mining/logging occupations (p for\ntrend,0.001 for each). Whereas more than 30% of U.S. private sector\noccupations were in manufacturing in the 1960's this number\ndecreased to approximately 12% of U.S. private sector jobs by 2008.\nIn the service occupations category (lower panel), the information\ncategory of occupation has seen a negative trend (p trend,0.001) while\nall other service occupations have seen an upward trend in prevalence\n(p#0.01 for each). The occupation categories of professional services,\nhealth/education and leisure/hospitality in particular have seen large\nincreases. Together, these three service occupation categories made up\napproximately 20% of U.S. occupations in the early 1960's and by the\nTable 1 summarizes the estimated median and range of physical\nactivity intensity (METs) as well as the estimated caloric expenditure\nof each occupation. Mining/logging, construction and manufactur-\ning all qualified as moderate intensity activity. All service occupation\nsectors were either sedentary or light intensity activity.\nFigure 2 presents the trends in the prevalence of sedentary,\nWhile there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of\nsedentary and light intensity physical activity occupations since\n1960, the prevalence of moderate intensity physical activity\ntrend,0.001 for each).

The energy balance model predictions\nassumed a 5 day work week. For both men and women the\npredicted weight based on changes in occupational energy\nexpenditure closely matches the NHANES weight for each\nexamination period.\nDiscussion\nOver the last 50 years in the U.S. there has been a progressive\ndecrease in the percent of individuals employed in goods producing\nand agriculture occupations whereas there has been an increase in the\npercent of individuals employed in service occupations. This has\nresulted in a shift away from occupations that require moderate\nintensity physical activity to occupations that are largely composed of\nsitting and sedentary behavior. In the early 1960's almost half of\nprivate industry occupations in the U.S. required at least moderate\nintensity physical activity and now less than 20% demand this level of\nactivity. We estimate that daily occupation-related energy expendi-\nture has decreased by more than 100 calories in both women and\nmen, and further, this reduction in occupational energy expenditure\naccounts for a large portion of the observed increase in mean U.S.\nweight over the last 5 decades.\nExamining secular changes in total daily physical activity is a\ncomplex endeavor. Two examples include the observation that\ntime spent in recreational activities has increased but so has time\nspent watching TV. At the same time, time spent on household\nwork has greatly decreased in women but slightly increased in men\n[6]. Dissecting the relative importance of each of these activities of\ndaily living on body weight is challenging. Here we chose to focus\non occupation-related energy expenditure because time spent at\nwork represents the largest segment of waking hours for most\npeople in the age range we studied. It is important to note that we\nexamined the prevalence of different occupations, not absolute\nnumber of jobs in a given occupation. This is important because\nthe workforce is not a static population and over the last 50 years\nthe prevalence of Americans in the Labor Force has increased\nfrom approximately 40% to 50% [18]. One of the driving forces\nbehind the increased prevalence of working Americans is the\nwomen were in the labor force and by 2007 this increased to 60%\nof women. This fact may also explain why occupation-related\nenergy expenditure estimated a higher mean weight during the\nGiven that it is unlikely that there will be a return to occupations that\ndemand moderate levels of physical activity; our findings provide\nfurther strong evidence of the public health importance of promoting\nphysically active lifestyles outside of the work day. Our estimation of a\nreduction of more than 100 calories per day in occupation-related\nenergy expenditure over the last 50 years would have been adequately\ncompensated for by meeting the 2008 federal physical activity\nrecommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity\nactivity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity activity [13].\nWhile it is often noted that the prevalence of Americans who achieve\nthis recommendation has been constant over recent decades, the fact\nremains that based on self-report data only 1 in 4 Americans achieve\nTable 1. Estimated median and range of physical activity\nintensity (METs) as well as the estimated caloric expenditure\nof each occupation.\nMedian (min, max)\nActivity\nCategory\nGoods-Producing\nService-Providing\nTrade (wholesale & retail),\ntransportation, and utilities\nFigure 2. Trends in the prevalence of sedentary, light and moderate intensity occupations from 1960 to 2008.\nTrends in Occupation Physical Activity & Obesity\nthis level [19]. It is important to note that when physical activity is\nassessed with accelerometers the number of Americans that achieve the\nphysical activity recommendations falls to 1 in 20 [20]. Thus since\nenergy expenditure has largely been removed from the work place the\nrelative importance of leisure-time physical activity has increased and\nshould be a major focus of public health interventions and research.\nBased on estimated caloric consumption from food production\nand food disappearance (food waste) estimates, previous reports\nhave concluded that increased caloric consumption could account\nfor most, if not all, of the weight gained at a population level in the\nU.S. [3\u00ad5]. Nonetheless, a recently validated differential equation\nmodel was used to identify a conservative lower bound for the\namount of food waste in the U.S. [21]. This analysis deter-\nmined that prior estimates of national food waste were grossly\nunderestimated; indicating that the national average caloric intake\nwas lower than previously estimated. These results and the results\nof the present study indicate that changes in caloric intake cannot\nsolely account for the observed trends in national weight gain.\nOur analysis has strengths and weaknesses that deserve mention. A\nmajor strength of this analysis is that for both the U.S. obesity and\noccupation data we used nationally representative databases. Further,\nwe used a previously published and well-recognized classification\nsystem to assign physical activity intensity levels to each occupation\ncategory thus minimizing the possibility of misclassifying occupation-\nrelated physical activity intensity [11]. However, we used the same\nphysical activity classifications across the 5 decades examined and in\ndoing so we did not take into account changes in technology that have\nreduced physical labor. While technological advances have greatly\nreduced the physical labor associated with most manufacturing\noperations this phenomenon would drive our results towards the null\nand thus we may be underestimating the true loss of moderate\nintensity occupations in the work force. Our analysis was focused on\ntype of occupation, and there are many aspects of occupation related\ndaily energy expenditure we did not examine such as mode of travel\nto work, total sitting time and stair usage. Another weakness of our\nanalysis is that not all agricultural or goods producing occupations are\nFigure 3. Occupational METs and energy expenditure since 1960. The upper panel of Figure 3 plots the mean occupation-related METs since\n1960 and the lower panel presents the mean occupational daily energy expenditure in men and women since 1960.\nTrends in Occupation Physical Activity & Obesity\nassociated with higher levels of physical activity and conversely some\nservice-related occupations are associated with higher levels of\nphysical activity. However, there are no adequate data to examine\nthis level of detail and we were very conservative in assigning MET\nvalues in order to minimize the effect of such misclassification within\noccupation types.\nConclusions\nOver the last 50 years in the U.S. there has been a progressive\ndecrease in the percent of individuals employed in occupations\nthat require moderate intensity physical activity. We estimate that\ndaily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased by\nmore than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure\naccounts for a significant portion of the increase in mean U.S.\nbody weight for women and men over the last 5 decades.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: TSC DMT RQR CB.\nPerformed the experiments: TSC CKM.
