    "abstract": "Abstract\nSo far, color-naming studies have relied on a rather limited set of color stimuli. Most importantly,\nstimuli have been largely limited to highly saturated colors. Because of this, little is known about\nhow people categorize less saturated colors and, more generally, about the structure of color\ncategories as they extend across all dimensions of color space. This article presents the results\nfrom a large Internet-based color-naming study that involved color stimuli ranging across all\navailable chroma levels in Munsell space. These results help answer such questions as how\nEnglish speakers name a more complex color set, whether English speakers use so-called basic\ncolor terms (BCTs) more frequently for more saturated colors, how they use non-BCTs in\ncomparison with BCTs, whether non-BCTs are highly consensual in less saturated parts of the\nsolid, how deep inside color space basic color categories extend, or how they behave on the\nchroma dimension.\n",

For example, in contemporary English, we tend\nto refer to the color of objects using terms like black, white, red, blue, green, yellow, brown,\npink, orange, purple, gray more often than we use terms like tan, peach, or violet (Lindsey &\nBrown, 2014; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995). The apparently preferred color expressions have\ncome to be known as ``basic color terms'' (or BCTs, for short).1\nThese observations result partly from color-naming studies. Most color-naming studies\nconducted in the past century have used the Munsell system (Munsell, 1941).

Thus, while the participants in the\naforementioned studies were presented with color chips systematically varying across\nseveral hues and value levels, they were only presented with one high chroma level for\neach hue and value combination. Consequently, these studies identified color categories\nthat were shown to extend over hue and value ranges, but without providing any\ninformation about the way categories behave along the dimension of chroma. This led\nKay et al. to make the following comment:\nLack of focus appears to be characteristic of desaturated terms, and probably of heterogeneous\nterms generally. Since the WCS data contain only hues at maximum available saturation, careful\nstudy will be required to decide if and when a `desaturated' term may name an unbroken volume\nof the [Munsell] color solid. (Kay, Berlin, Maffi, & Merrifield, 1997, p. 34)\nThe data from previous studies show BCTs, which are used at the surface of the solid\n(Boynton & Olson, 1987; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995), to extend over an unbroken area\n(or what is known in topology as a connected region). What naming behavior can be\nexpected in desaturated parts of the system? Kay et al. recognize that though color terms\nused to name the most saturated colors have been shown to delimit unbroken areas on the\nsurface of color space, it is still an open question whether this finding generalizes to less\nsaturated colors, for data from previous studies seem to suggest that terms in the desaturated\nparts of Munsell (a) may be diffuse, or lack focus, or (b) have a patchy or scattered extension\n(more on this in the following paragraphs). To date, no free color-naming study involving a\nlarge number of participants has been conducted using the totality of the Munsell system,\nmost importantly including the less saturated or desaturated chips. This being said, various\nstudies have analyzed color naming in different ways, in some cases including less or much\nless saturated colors.\nFor example, in Sivik and Taft's (1994) color-naming study, all the colors available in the\nSwedish Natural Color System (NCS) were used, including all the less saturated ones. The\nNCS is a descriptive color system that relies on Hering's (1878/1964) primaries as variables to\njudge color appearance. These variables can be reduced to blackishness (or brightness),\nchromaticness (or saturation), and hue. Sivik and Taft (1994) preidentified 16 color terms\nof interest, to wit, six ``elementary'' color terms: Swedish terms for white, black, yellow, red,\nblue, and green; seven additional common terms: Swedish terms for gray, brown, beige, lilac,\nFigure 1. The 330 Munsell chips used as materials in most color-naming studies.\norange, violet, and pink; and three less common terms: Swedish terms for rose, olive green, and\npurple. They then conducted a typicality task where participants were provided with a color\npatch, the preidentified color terms shown one at a time, and a 7-point Likert scale along\nwhich participants were asked to ``mark how well the color sample corresponds with what\nyou mean by the color word shown above'' (p. 147). The study shows that Swedish terms for\nbrown, beige, pink, and olive green extend exclusively in parts of the NCS space that are of\nmiddle to lower chromaticness (saturation).\nAnother notable study is Boynton and Olson's (1987) mapping of Berlin and Kay's (1969)\nBCTs in a color space that would be perceptually uniform along the three dimensions. They\nproceeded with a free color-naming study using the Optical Society of America Uniform\nColor Space (OSA\u00adUSC) system. The latter consists of a set of 558 color chips, varying on\nthree dimensions (L, for lightness; j, a yellow\u00adblue dimension; and g, a red\u00adgreen dimension).\nTheir results confirm the findings of Berlin and Kay and the World Color Survey (WCS),\nshowing that people used BCTs most frequently. Also, participants were fastest when they\nused BCTs in comparison with non-BCTs. Boynton and Olson (1987) were also interested in\nthe location of basic color categories in color space and their spatial relations to each other.\nThey noted that all basic colors except brown and gray lie toward the outside of the color\nsolid. Brown and gray ``bridge'' between nonadjacent colors, meaning that as these categories\nextend inside color space and not at its surface, they bear similarity relations to categories\nthat extend at the surface of the solid and are nonsimilar to each other. But ``a region of color\nsamples remains for which there is no such inside bridge, within which color naming is erratic\nand inexact.'' That is the region participants ``struggle'' to name, and where the nonbasic\nBoynton and Olson's experiment was in turn extended by Sturges and Whitfield (1995)\nwho used the Munsell system. In this study, a subset of 446 samples from the Munsell system\nwas used. Like Boynton and Olson, Sturges and Whitfield observed an overwhelming use of\nBCTs; only ``a relatively small portion of the names given were nonbasic'' (p. 366).\nDespite the interesting insight into naming behavior across several levels of chroma that\nthese studies provide, there are some limitations that leave the question of desaturated\ncategorization without a satisfying answer. Although in Sivik and Taft's (1994) study the\ncolors used unambiguously ranged across all three dimensions of the NCS, their stimuli\ncannot be directly compared with data collected with Munsell stimuli. It is also to be\nrecalled that Sivik and Taft did not conduct a free naming task. In the case of Boynton\nand ``134 intermediate samples, which cover near-neutral regions of colors of middle\nlightness'' (p. 94) were excluded. As a result, it is not clear to what extent less saturated\ncolors were included and, therefore, how these are named. Also, Boynton and Olson's study\ninvolved only seven participants, and though all three dimensions of the OSA\u00adUSC system\nwere used, the observations they share in their article mainly pertain to hue and value, and\nreference to saturation is limited. Finally, Sturges and Whitfield (1995) needed to choose a\nlimited number of samples, which were equally spaced across the Munsell system. That was\nproblematic because, due to the shape of the system, low-chroma chips are more similar to\neach other (more closely spaced) than high chroma chips at the same hue\u00advalue combination.\nSturges and Whitfield's solution to this problem was to sample more colors as chroma level\nincreased. As a result, their set includes more high-chroma colors than low-chroma colors,\npossibly favoring a prevalence of BCTs in comparison with non-BCTs among their\nparticipants' responses.\nThere is indeed a relationship between BCTs and saturation (e.g., Olkkonnen Witzel,\nHansen & Gegenfurtner, 2010, p. 14), which led some to wonder whether different\nJraissati and Douven 3\nconsensual color terms would emerge if different, perhaps less saturated, color stimuli were\nincluded in naming experiments (Witzel, 2016). This is an important question because, apart\nfrom the frequency of their use, BCTs have several other interesting characteristics. The\ncategories these terms refer to appear to be universal in that some or all of them are\nlexicalized in many spoken languages (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Cook, Kay, & Regier, 2005;\nbut see also Kuschel & Monberg, 1974; Levinson, 2001). Moreover, basic color categories\nappear to be graded--that is, items can fall under these categories to different degrees--where\na central member or central area (or region) elicits highest consensus, fastest reactions times,\nand is identified as the category's best example or set of examples. Consensus tends to taper\noff (and reaction times become larger) as we move away (in the Munsell system, or in OSA\u00ad\nUSC) from the best examples. Various authors have argued that what makes these color\ncategories basic has to do with the makeup of our perceptual and cognitive apparatus\nRegier, Kay, & Khetarpal, 2007; but also see Abbott, Griffiths, & Regier, 2016; Jraissati &\nDouven, 2017). Thus, the results of color-naming studies have important implications\nregarding our understanding of sensory categorization, which is an important reason to\ncall for a more complete view of color-naming behavior than has hitherto been undertaken.\nIt is expected that BCTs will name mostly saturated colors, but exactly how unsaturated\ncolors can be while still being named by a BCT is unknown. Indeed, color categories are\ngraded, as mentioned. We are aware of the tolerable degrees of hue and value variation for\ncolor categories identified at the surface of the Munsell system, but no such information is\navailable for chroma. In the context of her studies on color codability and memory, Rosch\n(Heider, 1972), who also uses Munsell colors, suggests that basic color categories' focal colors\n(or best examples) are most saturated, and inherently more codable. Specifically, Rosch\nreports that ``the boundaries of Dani chromatic terms do not extend as far into the\nunsaturated colors as boundaries of English chromatic terms'' (p. 456), thereby suggesting\nthat English color categories do extend deep into the unsaturated layers of the Munsell\nsystem, though it is not clear how deep these terms extend (note that the naming responses\nfor unsaturated colors were limited to 40 color chips in Rosch's study). Yet, some conflicting\nobservations stem from the work of Roberson, Davidoff, Davies, and Shapiro (2005), who\npoint out that ``[f]or Himba speakers, as for English and Berinmo speakers, these very\ndesaturated stimuli are poor examples of their basic categories, and thus hard to name''\nIn what follows, we present the results of a new, large color-naming study that was meant\nto gather data using all colors available in Munsell (insofar as it is representable in RGB\nspace), including the nonmaximally saturated ones. We thereby hope to partly answer the\nquestion stated in the earlier quote from Kay et al.'s (1997) article while also taking some first\nsteps toward addressing the concern of whether a different set of colors, including less\nsaturated ones, might lead to different consensual expressions.\nIn our analysis, we were specifically interested in the following questions: How do English\nspeakers name a more complex color set (i.e., including very low saturated, intermediately\nsaturated, and saturated colors)? Do nonbasic color expressions and terms emerge as\nconsensual categories? Are basic color categories still overwhelmingly used? More\ngenerally, how frequently do native speakers of English use BCTs in comparison with\nnon-BCTs when categorizing the whole of the Munsell system? And over what portion of\ncolor space do basic color categories and nonbasic color categories extend? Do basic color\ncategories lie mostly at the surface of the solid, as Rosch (Heider, 1972) and Roberson et al.\n(2005) suggested? If so, how deep inside the Munsell system do they extend? More generally,\nhow does color-naming behavior relate to chroma? Specifically, taking consensus as a\nmeasure of graded membership (see see Section Chroma, consensus, and BCTs, p. 12 for\nreferences), we can ask whether membership to color category is graded along the chroma\ndimension as well.\nStudy\nThe study to be reported here was conducted online. Online studies have rapidly gained\npopularity among psychologists and social scientists, thanks to the availability of\ncrowdsourcing services such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower. These services\nenable scientists to gather large amounts of data in a matter of days, sometimes even hours, at\nmoderate costs. To obtain comparable amounts of data in laboratory studies would often be\nimpossible because it would be unaffordable or because of other impracticalities. While the\nmethodology of running surveys over the Internet has been widely accepted by the scientific\ncommunity, one might have concerns over its use for perception studies and other studies that\nhave traditionally been carried out under strictly controlled viewing conditions in laboratories.\nThe control that researchers have in a laboratory setting is obviously absent in Internet-based\nexperiments, with participants using different monitors, operating systems, or web browsers.\nThis lack of control may seem especially problematic for online color experiments, given that in\ncolor research, viewing conditions may be even more important than in research on, say, slope\nestimation or the recognition of facial expressions.\nRecently, however, there have been a number of efforts to check the validity of online\ncolor research. Moroney (2003), Mylonas and MacDonald (2010), Mylonas, Paramei, and\nMacDonald (2014), and others report successful replications in Internet-based studies of\nexperiments that had previously been conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. We\ntake these studies as a justification of sorts for the methodology of our study while also\nacknowledging that the results to be reported are to be interpreted with some caution.\nMethod\nParticipants. There were 1,870 participants in this study. All participants were from Australia,\nCanada, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United States. They were recruited via\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk service, where they were directed to the Qualtrics platform via\nwhich the study was administered. Participants were financially compensated for their\ncooperation. Repeat participation was prevented through the Qualtrics software.\nWe first removed data from 381 participants who had submitted incomplete response sets.\nNext, we removed data from the fastest and slowest 2.5% participants, as well as from\nparticipants who indicated that they were nonnative speakers of English, color blind, or\nwho answered in the negative to a question of whether they had taken the task seriously\n(by adding this question, we followed a recommendation of Aust, Diedenhofen, Ullrich, &\nMusch, 2013). This left us with 1,338 participants. From those participants, we further\nremoved the ones who failed a color-sorting task that was presented at the end of the\nsurvey and served as a quality check (see Douven, Wenmackers, Jraissati, & Decock,\nthem were female; 972 indicated that they had a college degree, 188 indicated that they had\nhigh school as their highest education level, and 17 indicated a lower education level.\nAlthough the sorting task served as a data quality check, we are aware of the importance\nof individual differences in color perception (Lindsey & Brown, 2014; Witzel & Gegenfutner,\n2013) and the fact that such differences will almost certainly have affected our results.\nJraissati and Douven 5\nEqually important, given that our study was conducted online, is that Qualtrics registered a\ngreat variety of browsers, operating systems, and types of screen that had been used by our\nparticipants. Specifically, 67% had used the Chrome browser, 21% Firefox, 5% Safari, and\nthe rest some other browser (e.g., Edge, MSIE, Opera); as for operating systems, 76% had\nused some version of Windows, 21% some version of the Macintosh operating system, and\nthe rest some other operating system; finally, screen resolution varied so greatly that\nno summary description is possible (detailed information is easily retrievable via the R file\nin the Supplementary Materials). With this in mind, we would like to emphasize that we\naim to present a first broad exploratory study that, we hope, will indicate interesting\ndirections for future experiments, which would then be ideally carried out under better\ncontrolled conditions.\nMaterials and procedure. The stimuli consisted of a set of 1,625 Munsell chips available from the\nwebsite of the Program of Color Science, Munsell Color Science Laboratory, Rochester\nInstitute of Technology (PoCS/MCSL). The 1,625 stimuli were randomly divided over 25\nsets of 65 stimuli each. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of those sets and\nwas administered the 65 stimuli in the set, individually and in an order randomized per\nparticipant. Some Munsell stimuli are out of gamut and cannot be represented in RGB\nspace. These stimuli are therefore not in the conversion file provided by the PoCS/MCSL.3\nThe RGB coordinates given in that file were used to define the colors in the Qualtrics software.\nTwo hundred ninety-three stimuli out of the 1,625, randomly spread across the Munsell\nsystem, were discarded due to a coding error on Qualtrics that affected their RGB\ncoordinates and compromised their rendering (the list of compromised colors is provided\nin the Supplementary Materials). The current study therefore presents the naming responses\nof the remaining 1,332 colors. The analyses to be presented in the following included only the\nAt the start of the survey, participants were informed that they would be shown 65 color\npatches one by one and were instructed as follows:\nPlease name, in English, each of the 65 colors the way you spontaneously feel is most\nadequate--imagine you are conversing with a friend and need to identify an object by\nits color.\n(1) Do not overthink your response!\n(2) Be as concise as possible.\n(3) Each color is unique, although some colors might very much look alike: So do not worry\nif you need to use the same color label several times.\nAfter filling an online demographic questionnaire (age, gender, education level, normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision, color blindness), participants started the free naming task. Each\nstimulus appeared on a separate screen as a uniformly colored patch of 225 \u00c2 225 pixels\ncolor patch appeared the question, ``How would you name the above color?'' Beneath this\nquestion was a text box in which participants could type their response.\nResults and Discussion\nAll data and files for the analysis are available at https://osf.io/tujhb/?view_only=\nthe Mathematica notebook and the R file that were used for the analysis are also given in the\nfollowing and can be used to obtain further results by readers who have access to the requisite\nsoftware packages. While R is open source, Wolfram's Mathematica is proprietary software.\nFor readers who do not have access to Mathematica, the online materials include a\ncomputable document format (CDF) document. This document can be viewed in\nWolfram's CDF Player, which is freely available at https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/,\nbut which offers limited functionality.\nDescriptive statistics. There were in total 74,874 responses given to the 1,332 stimuli. Each of\nthe stimuli received an average of 47 responses (\u00c63.8), with a range from 38 to 55. On\naverage, 30.22 (\u00c613.11) of a participant's responses consisted of exactly one word.\nA Mann\u00adWhitney U test showed that female participants were significantly more likely to use\na compound expression than male participants, though the effect size was small\nTable 1 shows the 100 most frequently used terms, together with the corresponding counts.\n(The full list of terms can be generated by running the relevant part of the R file in the online\nmaterials.) Because too many spelling mistakes occur that more often than not make it\nimpossible to identify the color terms intended, in this table, we present the counts\nreporting participants' responses exactly as they are.\nNotably, at the top of the frequency list appear the majority of the BCTs. In English, these\nterms have so far been identified as white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, gray/grey,\npurple, orange, and pink (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Lindsey & Brown, 2014; Sturges & Whitfield,\n1995). In our study, these terms appear in the following order, from most to less frequent:\npurple, green, blue, pink, brown, black, orange, gray, yellow, and red. White is still quite\nfrequent, but less frequent than the nonbasic terms tan, peach, and maroon or certain\ncompound expressions including a BCT.\nThus, looking only at frequency, it would seem that the traditional distinction between\nBCTs and non-BCTs is roughly maintained. Clearly, frequency of term use varies\ncontinuously, and it is possible that terms traditionally considered as nonbasic are in the\nprocess of stabilizing and becoming basic. In fact, the 10 most frequent non-BCTs observed\nin this study (see later) were also observed in a recent American English color-naming study\n(Lindsey & Brown, 2014), which featured the 330 Munsell chips of the WCS. The question of\nthe possible stability with which these nonbasic terms refer to specific color stimuli is raised and\nwill be addressed in the following sections. For the purpose of convenience, we will stick here to\nthe distinction, common in the literature, between basic and nonbasic terms. The BCTs\nappearing in our study are white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, brown, gray/grey, pink, and\npurple; and the 10 most frequent non-BCTs are teal, tan, peach, maroon, mauve, violet, lavender,\nmagenta, beige, and lilac.\nA BCT occurred in 49,181, or 66%, of the responses. In the following, we distinguish\nbetween pure and impure references to BCTs, where the former are responses that consist of a\nsingle BCT, while the latter are responses that contain a BCT as part of a compound\nexpression (as in forest green, baby blue, light pink, purplish gray, etc.). Pure BCTs made\nresponses.\nBeyond mere frequencies of color terms, we were interested in systematic relations between\nthe terms used and color coordinates. We were especially interested in how color naming\ndepended on chroma.\nJraissati and Douven 7\nThe analysis to be given consists of both relevant statistics and relevant visualizations of\nthe results. All statistics were carried out assuming the Munsell coordinates. However, in the\ncase of some visualizations, we used the CIE 1976 L*u*v* space (or CIELUV space), which is\nrecommended by the Commission Internationale de l'E\n\u00b4clairage (CIE) for the characterization\nof colored displays on television or computer screens (Malacara, 2002, pp. 86\u00ad90). To display\nthe stimuli in CIELUV space, we converted their RGB coordinates as provided in the PoCS/\nMCSL file to CIELUV coordinates using Mathematica's built-in ColorConvert function.\nFigure 2 shows the stimuli in CIELUV space.\nModal and majority responses\nHue/chroma representation of naming frequencies. There are a number of different ways to\nsummarize the color-naming data in relation to the coordinates of the stimuli.\nStraightforward summaries are given in the figures in Appendix A, which feature mode\nmaps at three value levels. The maps feature Munsell hues on the x axis and Munsell\nchroma on the y axis (please note the gamut limitation at high chroma mainly in the G\u00adB\nrange). In the mode maps featuring most frequent responses in association to one color chip,\nwe used all color responses, and we treated any compound expression as an instance of the\nmonolexemic color term appearing in that expression. So, for example, dark blue and sky blue\nare treated as instances of blue; light teal, as an instance of teal.\nTable 1. Frequencies of the 100 Most Frequently Used Color Terms.\nTerm Count Term Count Term Count Term Count\nIn Figure A1, which presents a mode map of most frequent expressions, a mix of BCTs\nand non-BCTs appears. At value 9, 6, and 3 (V9, V6, and V3), the consensus for blue and\ngreen is overall quite low (usually not exceeding 0.3). Yellow's extension is largest at V9, but\nconsensus for yellow surprisingly peaks (0.6) at 10YR where maximal chroma is limited to\n8 and 6 (C8 and C6), and at 5Y, at low chroma (0.7 at C4). Purple reaches highest consensus\nat V3. The consensus for pink is highest (0.5) at V6, at high chroma (C14 and C22). As for\nnon-BCTs, peach occurs at V9, and peaks (0.5) at C6 while also reaching a high consensus\n(0.4) on most its extension. Teal is most visible at V6 and V3, reaching a very high consensus\n(0.7) at V3, at low chroma (C4). Other notable non-BCTs that reach relatively high consensus\nchroma (C6).\nThus, in these mode maps featuring most frequent expressions, the pattern of response in\nrelation to chroma is unclear. One possible explanation pertains to the use of modifiers and\nqualifiers. For example, if there is a consensual use of forest green for unsaturated shades of\ngreen, this will translate in mode maps as an increased consensus for green at low chroma.\nAnother possible explanation of the absence of a clear response pattern in relation to chroma\npertains to the fact that BCTs and non-BCTs might overlap rather than jointly partition\ncolor space (more on this in the Discussion and Concluding Remarks section). Indeed, using\nmode maps as a tool to explore the way color space is categorized rests on the assumption\nthat apart from marginal overlapping at the periphery of categories, most frequently used\nexpressions refer to categories that do not overlap, but jointly categorize the space. However,\nif these BCTs and non-BCTs overlap, looking at reached consensus levels across all\nexpressions might be confusing, leading to scattered extensions. Thus, if these various\nexpressions overlap rather than jointly partition color space, mode maps as in Figure A1\nwould possibly conceal the extensions of categories in some cases, and thereby obscure a\npossible relation to chroma. It would therefore be more useful to look at the extensions of\nthese two sets of unmodified expressions separately. In what follows, we examine pure BCTs\nand pure non-BCTs separately.\nWhen taking into consideration only pure BCTs (Figure A2), the frequency pattern gains\nin clarity, as can be seen in the respective bottom charts. The consensus of yellow (at V9, 0.8\nFigure 2. Different viewpoints of the set of 1,332 stimuli placed in CIELUV space.\nJraissati and Douven 9\nchroma levels and decrease at lower chroma.\nThus, when it comes to the use of pure BCTs, and in contrast to the mode maps featuring\nall expressions including modified and qualified BCTs (Figure A1), the tendency in the\nfrequency pattern is to increase with increasing chroma.\nWe now turn to the mode map including only non-BCTs, specifically the 10 most frequent\nmonolexemic, or pure, non-BCTs: mauve, lavender, maroon, violet, peach, tan, beige, lilac,\nmagenta, and teal (see Figure A3).\nNon-BCTs in this figure appear mostly in the R\u00adY hue ranges (peach, maroon, tan, beige)\nand in the P\u00adRP hue range (mauve, lavender, violet, magenta, lilac). Indeed, as in the case of\nBCTs, the G\u00adB hue range is overall named by fewer terms than the R\u00adY and P\u00adR hue ranges,\nprobably because of varying sensitivity of human receptors across the spectrum (MacAdam,\nComparing Figures A1 and A3, we see that the extensions of non-BCTs in the latter figure\nare somewhat less scattered than in the former. Overall, consensus is quite low. Non-BCTs\nThis result confirms that non-BCTs seem indeed to overlap with BCTs, without coinciding\nwith them exactly. Comparing Figures A1 to A3, one can see that teal, for example, at V6\nranges from GY to PB, reaching highest consensus at the boundary of blue and green. Peach\nextends over parts of pink and parts of orange. The extension of tan overlaps partly with that\nof brown and partly with that of orange. The extension of magenta is mostly within that of\npink, extending only over the most saturated parts. Lavender extends within purple, but only\nin the P hue range, while mauve extends within purple, but only in the RP range at low value,\nand parts of pink.\nHowever, because overall consensus is low, it is hard to detect a pattern in naming\nresponses that would inform us about the structure of these categories, in particular, in\nrelation to chroma. Low consensus suggests either that people still use BCTs relatively\nfrequently in reference to these colors or that they use too many different expressions on a\ngiven chip for one non-BCT to stabilize.\nChroma/value representation of response frequency. Perhaps a different view of the Munsell\nsolid might reveal different patterns. To make sure that this is not the case, the present section\nexamines the relation between consensus and Munsell chroma in mode maps featuring\nchroma on the x axis and value on the y axis at one specific hue. The relevant\nvisualizations are in Figures A4 to A6 in Appendix A.\nIn the mode maps featuring most frequent responses in association to one color chip, as\npreviously described, we used all color responses and treated compound expressions as an\ninstance of the monolexemic color term appearing in that expression. Each mode map is at\nAs we have seen in the hue\u00adchroma chart featuring all expressions (Figure A1), the pattern\nin frequency of response in the chroma\u00advalue chart featuring all expressions (Figure A4) is\nnot clear. For the same reasons stated earlier (see Hue/Chroma Representation of Naming\nFrequencies section), we look at pure BCTs and pure non-BCTs separately in what follows.\nFigure A5 shows mode maps including only pure BCTs, on a two dimensional chroma\u00ad\nvalue diagram, at five different hues. The trend that can be discerned in Figure A2 can also be\nseen here: Consensus is higher at high chroma for blue (0.5 at 10B, V4 and V5, at C6 and C8),\nBrown peaks at low chroma (0.6 at 10R, V3, C2), as one would expect.\nFinally as to the most frequently used pure non-BCTs, Figure A6 shows naming responses\nfor the 10 most frequent monolexemic, or pure, non-BCTs, displayed in two dimensional\nchroma\u00advalue diagrams.\nAs observed in Figure A3, overall consensus is low. Specifically, most consensual and least\nscattered categories are teal, which is used most frequently at 10G (0.4 at 10G, V5, C8), and\nscattered, though less consensual than teal and peach (magenta, beige, and maroon), or they\nreach a high level of consensus, but their extension here looks scattered (tan). The remaining\nmost consensus pure non-BCTs (mauve, lavender, violet, and lilac) are below 0.2 of consensus\n(violet, lavender, lilac) or have too scattered extensions (mauve, lilac) at these hues (10B, 10P,\nVisual examination of the extensions of BCTs and non-BCTs in various mode maps, in\ntwo different views of the Munsell system (on hue vertical planes and value horizontal\nplanes), suggests that consensus in the use of BCTs typically increases with chroma. BCTs\nare still used at low chroma, however, though at lower consensus. Like BCTs, non-BCTs are\nused across chroma levels. Some expressions, such as tan, beige, or peach, seem to refer to low\nchroma, others, such as magenta, to high chroma, while expressions like teal do not seem to\nhave a particular relation to chroma (knowing however that high-chroma colors are out of\ngamut in the hue range of interest, G\u00adB). Overall consensus is low in the case of non-BCTs,\nand these results are therefore not conclusive.\nChroma, consensus, and BCTs. Starting with BCTs, we get a first understanding of the\nconnection between consensus and chroma by looking at correlations between level of\nconsensus and mean chroma value. We calculated, for each BCT, the mean chroma value\nof the stimuli that were described by a pure use of that BCT by at least % of the participants\nwho saw the stimulus, for  going in steps of 5% from a minimum of 5% consensus to the\nmaximum level of consensus achieved for the given BCT (for most BCTs, this was between\n60% and 70%). We then looked at the correlations between those mean chroma values and\nthe levels of consensus. The results, reported in Table 2, showed that, for the most part, there\nare moderately strong to very strong correlations between consensus and chroma.\nThe correlations are also in the directions one would expect them to be; in particular,\nthere are negative correlations for the achromatic colors.\nTo investigate further the connection between chroma and consensus, we used the lme4\npackage (Bates, Ma\n\u00a8 chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014) for R to fit a linear mixed-effects model\nwith level of consensus as outcome variable and the mean chroma values as predictor\nvariable, looking specifically at the chromatic colors. For control purposes, we included as\na covariate the means of the Munsell values for the same levels of consensus for which we had\nmean chroma values, and we included chromatic BCTs as random effects, where we used the\nfull random-effects structure, as recommend in Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily (2013).\nA likelihood ratio test showed that this model improved significantly upon the same model\nwith mean chroma values removed as predictor. The fit of the full model was excellent,\nwith an R2 value of .91. The complete results of the model comparisons, which also\nincluded an intercept-only model as well as a model with mean chroma values as the only\nJraissati and Douven 11\npredictor, are given in Table 3. Figure 3 plots the marginal effects on consensus of chroma\nand value, as estimated in the full model.\nIt is seen from the table that the full model does best across all standard model comparison\ncriteria. In this model, there was a significant relationship between chroma and consensus:\nthe chromatic colors, an increase in mean chroma of 1 point is associated with an average\nincrease of close to 11% in consensus; or in other words, moving from the center of the\nMunsell system toward its surface, for every point in chroma, we get closer to that surface, we\nsee, on average, and keeping all else fixed, an increase in consensus in the use of chromatic\nBCTs of 11%. The control variable--mean Munsell values--was not significant in this\nWe followed this up by fitting linear models for each of the BCTs separately. The overall\npicture was consistent with the previous findings: In these models, chroma was typically a\nhighly significant predictor for consensus, with value also sometimes being significant. For\nmost BCTs, the fit of the corresponding model, as expressed by the R2 statistic, is excellent,\nmostly above .8 and for five BCTs (green, yellow, red, purple, and pink) even above .9. The\nMathematica notebook contains the full regression tables. Appendix B shows plots of the\nlinear models to exhibit the effect of chroma on each color individually.\nTable 3.

AIC is the Akaike Information Criterion and BIC the\nBayesian Information Criterion, two metrics that weigh model fit against model complexity. Their values are to be used\ncomparatively, in that models with smaller values are taken to be predictively more accurate than ones with larger values.\nThe \u00c1AIC and \u00c1BIC columns give the differences with the best model, according to AIC and BIC, respectively. The R2\nvalues were calculated using the r2 function in the sjstats package (Lu\nrecommendations of Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013).

BCT \u00bc basic color terms.\nThe Mathematica notebook contains additional machinery to visualize the relation\nbetween consensus level and chroma. The function animConsPure in Section 4 of the\nnotebook allows one to create animations, with stimuli being shown almost seamlessly for\nincreasing values of the consensus threshold , for any of the BCTs one wishes. Running\nthese animations confirms that, for virtually all BCTs, stimuli meeting higher consensus levels\ntend to be located more toward the surface of the space. The function densPlotPure in\nSection 5 of the notebook produces a three-dimensional density plot for any given BCT.\nFor both functions, it is to be kept in mind that they use CIELUV space, which is not the\nsame as the Munsell system, the latter being assumed in our statistical analyses. Nevertheless,\nthe higher the Munsell chroma value of a stimulus, the further out, from the center of\nCIELUV space, it tends to be. The Mathematica notebook also contains counterparts to\nanimConsPure and densPlotPure for impure references to BCTs.\nTo summarize, our statistical analysis of naming patterns reveals the chroma of a color\nstimulus to be a major determinant for whether or not people use a BCT to describe the\nstimulus. The visual presentations of the Munsell system that we provided in Modal and\nMajority Responses section are only partial, necessarily limited to some value levels or some\nhues that were selected at random, for illustrative purposes. Nevertheless, a similar pattern is\nobserved in the case of most pure BCTs.\nTaking consensus as a measure of membership--in the manner of, for instance, Hampton\nstructures that are graded not only along the hue and value dimensions, as was already\nknown from previous studies, but also along the chroma dimension.\nChroma, consensus, and non-BCTs. We conducted a mixed-effects models analysis similar to the\none reported in Chroma, Consensus, and Basic Color Terms section, and in light of the\naforementioned observations, we were not surprised to find that neither Munsell chroma\nnor Munsell value was a significant predictor of level of consensus for non-BCTs. (The R\ncode is in the Supplementary Materials, for readers interested in the details. We also fitted\nordinary least squares models for the most frequently used non-BCTs individually. Plots of\nfour of those models are shown in Appendix B, for comparison with the plots of the ordinary\nleast squares models for the individual BCTs. Regression tables of the models for the ten\nmost frequent non-BCTs can be found in the Mathematica notebook.) Thus, in view of our\ndata, the answer to Kay et al.'s (1997) question of whether non-BCTs form unbroken\nFigure 3. Marginal effects of chroma (left) and value (right) on consensus, shown with 95% confidence\nbands.\nJraissati and Douven 13\nvolumes carving up the inner layers of Munsell must be negative. Figure A6 (representing\nconsensus in the use of the ten most frequent non-BCTs in a chroma\u00advalue diagram at 5\ndifferent hues) and Figure A3 (representing consensus in the use of the 10 most frequent non-\nBCTs in a hue\u00adchroma diagram at 3 levels of value) taken together suggest that non-BCTs\nreach overall low consensus levels, with only few of them appearing to have a rather\ncontinuous, nonscattered, extension; that is, most non-BCTs extend over somewhat broken\nvolumes, with no clearly delimited area where consensus tends to peak.\nDiscussion and Concluding Remarks\nThis study was meant as a straightforward exploration of English speakers' naming behavior\nof the Munsell system, and most importantly, its inner layers. We had two main questions:\nFirst, how do people name the inner parts of Munsell? Second, if BCTs are overwhelmingly\nused at the surface of the system, how would their structure vary along the chroma\ndimension? To this end, we designed a naming experiment as similar as possible to the\nWCS, with the main difference that it also included a large number of intermediately and\npoorly saturated Munsell colors. Moreover, the free naming was not constrained in any way,\nand people were not instructed not to use complex expressions if they so desired, although\nthey were encouraged to be concise.\nOur study confirmed that English speakers overwhelmingly use BCTs in their color\nnaming. Our study also confirmed that most BCTs refer to saturated colors. Frequency of\nuse of BCTs, and especially pure BCTs, was highest in the middle to high chroma levels, and\ngenerally consensus increased with chroma. Although this behavior was expected on the basis\nRosch, 1972; Sturges & Whitfield, 1995), it was never systematically observed in a large-scale\nnaming study involving colors with low saturation.\nInsofar as the use of non-BCTs in our study goes, it is characterized by a rather low\nconsensus across chroma levels. A few expressions seem to manifest a peak of consensus\nwith decreasing chroma, such as peach, the consensus of which peaks at C6, and tan, at C4.\nMost non-BCTs have a rather diffuse extension. We were hoping to observe a different\nbehavior at low saturation, but these observations do not come as a surprise (Boynton &\nnot take our results to offer a list of reified categories currently in use in English. What our\nresults suggest is that, given a set of colors that vary across levels of chroma, presented once,\nindividually, and in random order, participants tend to use BCTs more often and more\nconsensually. They also use them more in relation to saturated colors.\nNonetheless, and even if their extensions are rather patchy and scattered, we do observe\nthe use of several non-BCTs in our study. Does the fact that some of these terms (tan and\npeach) reach their highest consensus levels at low chroma mean that non-BCTs should be\nexpected to categorize less saturated parts of color space?\nThis is precisely one of the issues we set out to examine. One observation that sheds some\nlight on it is that (what we here called) basic and nonbasic categories seem to overlap rather\nthan jointly partition the space. This observation would need to be verified in future naming\nstudies, but meanwhile it raises interesting questions and possibilities. First, are these\noverlapping and less consensual expressions here labeled non-BCTs for convenience, ``not\nbasic'' in the sense that they are subordinate categories? Do they have extensions that are\nincluded in the extensions of BCTs, or are they hyponyms (see the basic color terms criteria in\nBerlin & Kay, 1969)? For a color to be magenta seems to imply that it is of pinkish color, but\nalso highly saturated. Magenta could perhaps in this sense denote a ``kind of pink.'' But this is\nnot the case for the other non-BCTs examined in this study. The extension of teal overlaps\nwith those of green and blue at low chroma. Teal seems to pick up both colors that are not\nobviously blue and colors that are not obviously green (perhaps because of their relatively low\nchroma), as much as it picks up colors that are ambiguously blue or green at all chroma levels\n(see again Figure A1; also Lindsey & Brown, 2014). Teal is therefore not a kind of blue or a\nkind of green. The extensions of peach and tan are also not entirely included within that of any\nBCT. At high value, peach overlaps with yellow and pink, and at medium value, it overlaps\nwith orange and brown. In other words, peach behaves differently than any of these categories\nboth on hue and value. As for tan, it overlaps with orange and brown at medium value, medium\nto low chroma, but more toward the YG hue range than peach. It would indeed seem that the\noverlaps we observe here might correspond to what others have called coextension (e.g.,\nMacLaury, 1997), where coextension is a semantic relationship that does ``not fit our\npreconceptions of synonymy, near synonymy, inclusion, or complementation'' (MacLaury,\nIt would be reasonable to conclude that the non-BCTs in this study are used to mark an\naspect of color experience that is not captured by BCTs. What different aspects of our color\nexperience do non-BCTs and BCTs mostly mark? An intuitive answer would be that\nBCTs (excluding brown) mark hue, for the most part. That is, what distinguishes one BCT\nfrom another is in most cases its hue. Non-BCTs, on the other hand, seem to mark more than\nthe particular hue of a color experience, picking up chroma as well as value variations (see the\nnotions of ``desaturated-complex'' and ``saturated-complex'' in MacLaury, 2007). Is this the\nreason why use of BCTs increases with chroma? Chroma increases hue contrasts, and if BCTs\nmostly mark hue differences, an increase in chroma would be expected to lead to an increased\nuse of BCTs.\nAn interesting follow-up question is this: If BCTs name most saturated colors\nbecause these favor hue contrasts, would participants still use BCTs most consensually to\nname the (relatively) most saturated colors of a color set that is overall poorly saturated? Or,\non the contrary, would the relatively most saturated colors of an overall poorly saturated\ncolor set tend to be named by BCTs less frequently? In other words, might the relationship of\nBCTs to chroma be relative to the color set in use? Such is a possible sense in which BCTs\nwould essentially be a way to linguistically mark distinctive hues. And how would non-BCTs\nrelate to BCTs in such a set?\nFrom this perspective, the expectation that non-BCTs would carve up poorly saturated\nparts of Munsell like BCTs carve up highly saturated parts of the system in a color set\nfeaturing high- and low-chroma colors, seems to result from a mistaken hypothesis: Non-\nBCTs and BCTs do not seem to relate to chroma in similar ways. Perhaps people's\nfavoring the use of BCTs for most saturated colors leads to non-BCTs being more\nvisible at low chroma. However, what relation non-BCTs bear to low chroma, and\nwhether such terms are truly preferred for naming low-chroma colors, remain open\nquestions.\nWe hope the data we here share will encourage much needed future studies involving,\namong other things, response times and within-subject consistency measures that would\nallow to assess how salient non-BCTs are to the individuals who use them. Meanwhile,\nthis study furthers our understanding of the lexicalization of color. Given the connection\nbetween consensus and graded membership that many researchers assume (as mentioned\npreviously), the study also advances our understanding of category structure and graded\nmembership and can be useful in testing various extant categorization models\nDietz, & E\n\u00b4 gre\nJraissati and Douven 15\n"
