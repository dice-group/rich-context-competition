This includes, in\naddition to glucose lowering, the control of blood pressure\n(BP) and lipids, weight management, smoking cessation\nand, when indicated, anti-platelet therapy.3,4 Despite these\nrecommendations, it is known to be difficult for most\npatients in clinical practice to reach their therapeutic goals.7\nExplanations include prevailing patient factors and clini-\ncian factors superimposed upon the progressive nature of\nSGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular\nrisk: Proposed pathways and review\nof ongoing outcome trials\nSilvio E Inzucchi1, Bernard Zinman2, Christoph Wanner3, Roberto\nFerrari4,5, David Fitchett6, Stefan Hantel7, Rosa-Maria Espadero8,\nHans-J\u00fcrgen Woerle9, Uli C Broedl9 and Odd Erik Johansen10\n Keywords\nType 2 diabetes, cardiovascular complications, review, macrovascular, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors\n1Section of Endocrinology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA\nLunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital,\nUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\n3Division of Nephrology, University of W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany\nDepartment of Cardiology and LTTA Centre, University Hospital of\nFerrara, Ferrara, Italy\nMaria Cecilia Hospital, GVM Care & Research, E.S: Health Science\nFoundation, Cotignola, Italy\n6St Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\nFeature Article\n7Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

In light of the multi-\nfaceted pathogenesis of CV disease in diabetes, it would be\nviewed as an advantage if a specific intervention could\nattenuate atherosclerosis risk in a multi-dimensional fash-\nion, and beyond glycaemic control alone.\nThe potential effect of such interventions on CV risk\nmight ultimately be dependent on the mode of action of the\ndrug in terms of which CV pathway(s) were being modu-\nlated. However, to date, the potential effects of specific\nglucose-lowering agents, that is, sulphonylurea (SU), glin-\nides, metformin, thiazolidinediones, insulin, glucagon-like\npeptide-1 receptor analogues or dipeptidyl-peptidase-4\n(DPP-4) inhibitors, on CV events in patients with T2DM\nremain uncertain.8 This was recently illustrated with the\nneutral effect for the composite CV death, myocardial\ninfarction (MI) or stroke from the first two placebo-con-\ntrolled trials involving the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin\n(i.e. SAVOR-TIMI53)9 and alogliptin (i.e. EXAMINE),10\na class associated with beneficial effects on several factors\nand biological processes linked to atherogenesis in mecha-\nnistic and preclinical studies.11 It should be noted that both\nSAVOR-TIMI 53 and EXAMINE were relatively short in\nyears, respec-\ntively) and included patients predominantly, or exclu-\nsively,withovertCVdisease\u00adtwoimportantconsiderations\nwhen assessing the potential CV risk modulation of any\ncompound, although this is also contingent on the mode of\naction of the therapy being studied. A sufficient duration of\ntreatment might be important since macrovascular (as well\nas microvascular) disease may be a relatively late compli-\ncation of a complex and progressive pathogenic process\nthat spans years.12 In addition, in T2DM patients with\nestablished CV complications, who are often targeted by\nthese studies, it may be more difficult to further reduce the\nresidual CV risk beyond that which standard of care can\nSodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors \u00ad\nbeyond glucose lowering?\nSodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are\na new class of glucose-lowering agents that reduce\nhyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM by reducing renal\nglucose reabsorption; as a result, they increase urinary glu-\ncose excretion (UGE).14 SGLTs are found in the proximal\ntubule as SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT-1 is a low-capacity,\nhigh-affinity transporter present in parts of the tubule (seg-\nment 3), but that also is expressed in the small intestine (to\na greater extent than in the kidney) and in the heart. In\ncontradistinction, SGLT-2, a high-capacity, low-affinity\ntransporter, is present in segment 1 of the tubule and nor-\nmally accounts for ~90% of the glucose reuptake.15\nThere are currently three drugs of this class that have\nbeen approved by US Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA): canagli-\nflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (Table 1),16\u00ad25 with\nseveral others in global or regional development (e.g. ipra-\ngliflozin, ertugliflozin, remogliflozin, luseogliflozin,\ntofogliflozin and sotagliflozin). In placebo-controlled\nphase III trials in patients with T2DM, these agents, as\nmonotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lower-\ning drugs, improve glycaemic control with a low risk of\nhypoglycaemia. They also reduce body weight and BP\nwithout compensatory increases in heart rate and have\nsome effects on plasma lipids (increase in high-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), increase in low-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), with no change in\nHDL-C/LDL-C).26 The class has also been reported to\nincrease the incidence of urinary and genitourinary tract\ninfections modestly, in particular in females.26 Common\nfor all labels of the class are also potential volume deple-\nThis review provides an overview on the potential for\nSGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce CV risk beyond glucose-\nlowering effects and presents an overview of the similari-\nties and differences of the currently six ongoing outcome\ntrials from this class, currently involving more than 41,000\npatients.\nPotential for modulation of non-\nglycaemic CV risk factors with SGLT-\n2 inhibitors\nThe kidneys play an important role in the modulation of\nsystemic glucose levels, filtering and reabsorbing glucose\nTable 1.

These include a\ndiminished effect of SGLT-2 in the nephron owing to a\nphysiological decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nduring sympathetic nervous system activation from hypo-\nglycaemia,28 as well as a putative compensatory increase in\nhepatic gluconeogenesis.29 With the potential for the class\nto also correct post-prandial glucose levels,22\u00ad24 one could\nat this point also speculate whether such reductions in glu-\ncose variability could have beneficial CV effects. Both\npost-prandial hyperglycaemia and glucose variability have\nbeen linked by some investigators to increased CV risk.30\nRecent studies have also suggested that enhancing glu-\ncosuria with SGLT-2 inhibitors improves insulin sensitiv-\nity as measured by peripheral glucose uptake.29,31 One\ninvestigation found that insulin-mediated tissue glucose\ndisposal increased by approximately 18% after 2\nweeks\nwith dapagliflozin,31 although such changes are likely sec-\nondary to reductions in glucose toxicity, which improves\nbeta cell function, as also has been demonstrated with this\ndrug class. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia have\nbeen associated with increased atherosclerosis risk,32\nalthough proof that improving insulin sensitivity (and/or\nreducing plasma insulin concentrations) leads to CV ben-\nefit remains elusive. Moreover, the CV relevance from any\nindirect changes in insulin sensitivity as a result of SGLT-2\ninhibition is entirely unknown.\nReduction in BP and arterial stiffness\nIn most phase III pivotal trials with SGLT-2 inhibitors, a\nreduction in systolic BP in the magnitude of ~3\u00ad5mmHg\nand diastolic BP of ~2\nmmHg has been documented.26\nImportantly, this has been observed without a compensa-\ntory increase in heart rate.\nFigure 1. Identified potential and novel pathways associated with CV effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors based on clinical and\nmechanistic studies.\nDedicated 24-h ambulatory BP measurement stud-\nies33,34 have confirmed these data, and interestingly, the BP\nreduction seems to be of the same magnitude irrespective\nof background therapy, that is, number or type of antihy-\npertensive agents.35\nThe reason for the observed BP reduction with SGLT-2\ninhibitors is not fully understood but likely involves sev-\neral pathways including a modest diuretic effect,34 weight\nreduction and potentially some sodium depletion.26\nInterestingly, data from an 8-week mechanistic trial dem-\nonstrated that empagliflozin reduced arterial stiffness in\npatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM);36 thus, a\ndirect vascular effect might also contribute the BP changes.\nSGLT-2 inhibitors may also improve endothelial function\nor the vascular architecture, that is, collagen, elastin,\nadvanced glycation end-products and other components of\nconnective tissue that participate in the process of arterial\nThe findings of no increased heart rate in the setting of\nBP reduction are also of note since it may be interpreted as\na relative reduction in the sympathetic nervous system\ntone, although modulation of other neurohormonal factors\nalso could play a role.36\nReduction in body fat and fat mass\nWith selective SGLT-2 inhibition, glucose reabsorption in\nthe kidneys is decreased and UGE increased, resulting in\nnegative energy balance and weight reduction.14 The gluco-\nsuria induced by the agents is typically associated with a\nday38 leading to weight reductions in studies of ~2\u00ad3\nkg\nover 24\u00ad52weeks. This is a consistent finding in the pivotal\nprogrammes for the class.26 With SGLT-2 inhibition, as cir-\nculating glucose levels are reduced, glucosuria decreases\nbut remains elevated even in those who achieve near-nor-\nmal glucose control.22\u00ad25 The reason for a lesser weight loss\nthan expected from UGE and a plateauing of weight loss\nafter ~3\u00ad6months of therapy is not known, but it has been\nsuggested that this likely could be related to a compensa-\ntory increased energy intake39 since these drugs do not\naffect either resting or meal-induced energy expenditure.29\nOf potentially greater interest from a CV risk factor\nreduction perspective is how they change visceral fat\nmass. Visceral adiposity is associated with increased risk\nof T2DM, CV complications and overall mortality, pri-\nmarily related to abnormal adipocyte biology, with\naltered production of adipocytokines, leading to modula-\ntion of CV pathways that could promote atherosclero-\nsis.40,41 In dedicated body composition studies comparing\ncanagliflozin with glimepiride for 52\nweeks43 or empagliflozin\nwith glimepiride44 over 104weeks and assessing changes\nin visceral adiposity (VA) mass by dual-energy X-ray\nabsorptiometry (DXA), computer tomography imaging\n(CTI) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was\ndemonstrated that the majority of weight loss associated\nwith SGLT-2 inhibition was due to reduction in visceral\nfat or subcutaneous (SC) fat (Table 2). Interestingly,\neven in shorter term studies, assessing changes in indi-\nrect markers of visceral adiposity, that is, visceral adi-\nposity index,45 waist circumference (WC) or index of\ncentral obesity,46 significant reductions have also been\nobserved.47 Data on effects on circulating adipokines are\ncurrently sparse. After 24weeks of therapy, dapagliflozin\ndid not significantly alter either adiponectin or leptin\nlevels in one study.48 Whether reductions in\nvisceral adiposity with SGLT-2 inhibition contribute to\nCV risk reduction remains to be demonstrated, but it is\nan interesting characteristic of this class of agents given\nthe discordant impact on visceral fat with other classes\nof glucose-lowering agents, for example, thiazolidinedi-\nones reduce visceral fat whereas SU does not.49\nEffects on proteinuria and kidney function\nSGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with reductions in uri-\nnary albumin excretion as described in dedicated renal\nstudies with canagliflozin,50 dapagliflozin51 or empagliflo-\nzin52 or in pooled analysis of phase III studies.53 To what\nextent such a reduction translates into potential CV bene-\nfits remains to be clarified; but from a vascular perspec-\ntive, this is interesting in light of the haemodynamic renal\nchanges associated with diabetes. At the onset of diabetes\nmellitus, hyperglycaemia causes increases in proximal\ntubular reabsorption due to an upregulation of the SGLT-2\nexpression54,55 leading to secondary increases in sodium/\nglucose cotransport. The increase in proximal reabsorption\nleads to a decrease in solute load to the macula densa,\nalteration of the tubuloglomerular feedback and an increase\nin GFR. In a renal mechanistic study in T1DM, it was\nobserved that renal hyperfiltration was reduced with\nSGLT-2 inhibition,56 attributable to increasing afferent\narteriolar resistance without altering efferent arteriolar\nresistance,57 thereby leading to a partial correction of\nabnormally high baseline glomerular hydrostatic pressure\nin the context of hyperfiltration that characterizes early\ndiabetic nephropathy.58 These data suggest that SGLT-2\ninhibition increases distal tubular sodium delivery, which\nin turn leads to altered tubuloglomerular feedback and\nattenuated intraglomerular hypertension. This is also inter-\nesting from the single-nephron theory perspective since it\ncould in part explain why a slight reduction in GFR is\nobserved when treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors is started\n(i.e. as a consequence of reducing hyperfiltration in func-\ntional nephrons). It has been observed that this GFR reduc-\ntion, in patients with stage 2\u00ad4 chronic kidney disease, is\nreversible when the medication is stopped.52\nReduction in levels of uric acid\nUric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in\nhumans, and hyperuricaemia is a diagnostic marker for\ngout. Increased uric acid levels have, however, also been\nassociated with chronic kidney disease,59 CV complica-\ntions60 and congestive heart failure,61 although a cause and\neffect relationship of uric acid and CV outcomes is far\nfrom proven.62 Reduction in levels of uric acid has consist-\nently been seen with SGLT-2 inhibitors,63\u00ad65 presumably\nmediated by the actions of solute carrier family 2, facili-\ntated glucose transporter member 9 (SLC2A9), also called\nGLUT9, an urate transporter which secretes urate back\ninto the urine in exchange for glucose.66 It is entirely\nunclear whether these uric acid effects might translate into\nlong-term beneficial outcomes on either renal function or\nmacrovascular complications.\nEffect on lipid parameters\nSGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with a small increase in\nHDL-C as well as an increase in LDL-C with concomitant\nthese small lipid changes are clinically relevant and\nwhether they could potentially offset any potential CV\nbenefit with SGLT-2 inhibitors will need further\nclarification.\nEffects on other CV risk pathways\nIn animal and mechanistic models, SGLT-2 inhibitors have\nbeen shown to reduce leuokocytosis induced by hypergly-\ncaemia70 and to reduce inflammation and oxidative\nstress,71\u00ad73 which are processes involved in the pathophysi-\nology of atherosclerosis.\nSince inhibition of SGLT-2 leads to glucosuria with an\naccompanying diuresis, weight and BP reductions, all of\nwhich are theoretically beneficial in patients with heart fail-\nure, it is also conceivable that impaired ventricular function\nand remodelling could be improved with such an interven-\ntion. Although clinical data are yet to be reported, an animal\nstudy suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition could attenuate the\nincrease in left ventricle mass and left ventricle end diastolic\ndiameter in a rat model of progressive heart failure.74\nTable 2.

The limita-\ntion of these analyses is that the pooled data of limited\nnumber of CV events was from heterogeneous, short-term\nfollow-up studies that were neither adequately powered\nnor designed to address CV outcomes.\nOutcome trials in progress\nGiven the relationship between CV risk and T2DM, and\nthe uncertainty surrounding the CV risk of some glucose-\nlowering therapies, the US FDA and EMA require evalua-\ntion of CV risk for new compounds being developed as\ntherapies for T2DM.78,79 To comply with this, several large\nclinical trials assessing the CV safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors\nare ongoing.\nThere are several common features of these trials\n(Table 4). They are all double-blinded and placebo-\ncontrolled, with patients recruited all having T2DM and\nbeing at increased CV risk. In addition, study patients are\nall receiving standard of care according to recommended\nguidelines. The trials differ in size and, to some degree, in\ntheir target population spanning from higher to lower CV\nrisk, with some studying only people with established CV\ndisease (i.e. the highest CV risk population) and others a\nmixed population consisting of those with CV risk factors\nand/or previous macrovascular complications. Primary\noutcomes also vary. Common to the four trials with a\nprimary CV focus is a primary endpoint definition of a\nclassical 3-point MACE composite (and not 4-point\nMACE). In contrast, two trials remain focused primarily\non renal outcomes.\nIn each of the trials, CV events are being adjudicated by\nan independent Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC), as\nalso requested in the FDA safety requirements and EMA\nguidance.\nThe first outcome trial expected to report will be\ngating the CV profile of empagliflozin versus placebo\nsuperimposed upon prevailing standard of care. There are\nseveral other secondary and tertiary outcomes preplanned\n(e.g. hospitalization for heart failure and several renal\ncaptured, it will allow for both non-inferiority assessment\nof CV safety as well as CV superiority assessment.

Of the large num-\nber of antihyperglycaemic drug classes now available for\npatients with T2DM, none is recognized unequivocally to\nreduce CV events over and above any modest effects of\nglucose lowering itself. Metformin, which is widely\nviewed as having CV benefits, has actually never been\nstudied in a large properly designed randomized clinical\ntrial powered to answer this specific question.\nSGLT-2 inhibitors are novel oral glucose-lowering\nagents that offer the potential to improve glycaemic con-\ntrol with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, independent of\ninsulin secretion, offering a modest reduction in BP and\nbody weight. Their mode of action, which is independent\nof endogenous insulin secretion, enables their use in any\nstage of T2DM. However, while the potential for CV\nbenefits from the SGLT-2 inhibitors is alluring, an actual\neffect on CV outcomes remains to be proven.\nPreliminary attempts have been made to quantify long-\nterm effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on macrovascular events.\nThese have included pooled analyses, showing beneficial\ntrends, from smaller randomized trials being performed\nprimarily to demonstrate glucose-lowering efficacy and an\nTable 4.
