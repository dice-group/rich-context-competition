Given that Drucker's ideas are deeply rooted in, and\ninfluenced by, an Aristotelian perspective, the notion of\nknowledge workers'virtues can be explored from within this\nperspective. This view espouses both intellectual virtues\n(geared toward developing innovative and creative compe-\ntencies) and moral character (geared toward acquiring moral\ncompetencies).Although much has been written on the latter,\nthe idea and role of intellectual virtues (see Table 1) have not\nbeen fully developed in the literature, and they are particu-\nlarly important as such virtues are the source of critical and\ncreative thinking.\nWe single out the intellectual virtues and moral character\nthat knowledge workers need to make lasting contributions\nto a functioning knowledge society. We identify prudence,\neffectiveness, excellence, integrity, and truthfulness as\nknowledge workers' intellectual virtues, and practical wis-\ndom, responsibility, cooperation, and courage as moral\ncharacter.\nAccording to Peter Drucker (1994), \"[n]o century in\nrecorded history has experienced so many social transforma-\ntions and such radical ones as the twentieth century\" (p. 53).\nUnfortunately, such social transformations have recently\nbeen accompanied by waves of corruption. With respect to\nsuch trends, Fukuyama (1999) has coined the term Great\nDisruption to describe deteriorating social conditions and\nchanges in social values throughout most of the industrial-\nized world as a result of the transition from an industrial to an\ninformation era. Equally, we should point out that certain\nshifts may reveal values that are latent. Meanwhile, Drucker\nsocial and technical transformation evolved during a particu-\nlar moment in the history of humanity that he labels\n\"Knowledge Society.\" Nevertheless, Machlup (1962) docu-\nmented empirically for the case of the United States that the\nknowledge society was created by a shift in the nature of\nwork.\nAt the turn of the millennium, there were various expres-\nsions of a lack of morality exacerbating corruption at differ-\nent societal levels. In fact, at present, societies assume high\ncosts owing to ethical failures originating in an evident lack\nof leadership and oriented management processes that lead\nsome authors to identify a \"pathological mutation\" in capi-\n1Universidad de La Sabana, Chia, Colombia\n2The University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago\nCorresponding Author:\nAlvaro Turriago-Hoyos, Universidad de La Sabana, Campus del Puente del\nComun, Km 7 Autopista Norte de Bogota, Chia 53753, Colombia.\nEmail: alvaroth@unisabana.edu.co\nKnowledge Workers and Virtues in Peter\nDrucker's Management Theory\nAlvaro Turriago-Hoyos1, Ulf Thoene1, and Surendra Arjoon2\n Keywords\nintellectual virtues, moral character, ethics, Peter Drucker, knowledge workers, knowledge society\n2 SAGE Open\nas if a new expression of capitalism exists that has trans-\nformed the traditional values of an owner's capitalism into\nthe new values of a manager's capitalism which functions\nprimarily to enrich corporate managers as a social grouping.\nAll of these new circumstances stem from changes in the\ncurrent economic system, demonstrating the weakening of\nlinks among management, ethics, and morality.\nIn addition to all these novelties in ethics and morality,\ntechnical change must also be taken into account. Nowadays,\nit is hard to ignore the ubiquitous nature and importance of\ninformation and communications technologies (ICT) and\ntheir centrality in all spheres of social, economic, and politi-\ncal life. The technical change brought about by ICT has\nbecome a reality in many socioeconomic transformations,\ndriving remarkable trends, especially with respect to the\nworldwide workforce. According to Miller (2001), the\n\"twentieth century has marked transitions in the developed\nworld from an agricultural to an industrial to an information-\nbased society\" (p. 147). \"As the primary workforce has\nevolved from farmers to labourers to knowledge workers, the\nbases of wealth, power, and social interaction have moved\nfrom land to mass production to e-commerce,\" Miller (2001,\nIn summary, social transformations have entailed high lev-\nels of corruption, together with a migration of owner capital-\nismtomanagercapitalisminaknowledgesocietyenvironment\nimplying technological, social, and ethical changes that call\nfor new management approaches: \"It is easy to look good in a\nboom. But also, every boom . . . puts crooks in at the top\"\nhighs bring about financial predators as well as prosperity. In\nporary management has improved profitability by raising\nproductivity and streamlining, downsizing, outsourcing, and\nout-competing the competition. All these factors lead us to\nunderstand and accept that the origin of many current troubles\nin diverse areas such as finance, government, sports, labor,\nand pharmaceuticals can be found in a deficient function of\nmorality, leadership, and management in organizations\n(Arjoon, Turriago-Hoyos, & Thoene, 2015).\nFollowing on from these introductory paragraphs, the sec-\nond section discusses the role of knowledge workers within\nthe knowledge society. In the third section, we synthesize\nDrucker's management theory following Maciariello (2009).\nThe fourth section summarizes knowledge workers' charac-\nteristics from a perspective that considers their intellectual\nvirtues and practical wisdom as an obligation and an attribu-\ntion of knowledge workers. We analyze knowledge workers'\nintellectual virtues and moral character in the fifth section,\nwhich is followed by the concluding paragraphs.\nThe Role of Knowledge Workers in the\nKnowledge Society\nDrucker (1985) praises the relevance that management has\nwrought for the transition from the managerial toward the\nentrepreneurial economy, stating that\n[m]anagement is the new technology (rather than any specific\nnew science or invention) that is making the American economy\ninto an entrepreneurial economy. It is also about to make\nAmerica into an entrepreneurial society. Indeed, there may be\ngreater scope in the United States . . . for social innovation in\neducation, health care, government, and politics than there is in\nbusiness and the economy. And again, entrepreneurship\nin society . . . requires above all application of the basic concept,\nthe basic techn\u00e9, of management to new problems and new\nopportunities. (pp. 15-16, emphasis in original)\nDrucker's (1985) analysis of capitalism leads him to hypoth-\nesize links between technological changes and the manage-\nment response to new social trends. To demonstrate this\nrelationship, he argues that capitalism has faced two crucial\nperiods (managerial and entrepreneurial economy) through-\nout the evolution of management.\nAccording to Drucker (1985), \"[w]hat is happening in the\nUnited States is . . . a profound shift from a `managerial' to\nan `entrepreneurial' economy\" (p. 1). The entrepreneurial\neconomy relies upon knowledge generation as the source of\nwealth in society. Improving, exchanging, and protecting\nknowledge are the main challenges to management\nTable 1.

Turriago-Hoyos, Thoene, & Arjoon (2016).\nTurriago-Hoyos et al. 3\nnowadays. In addition, in the current historical epoch,\nDrucker (1985) states that management is a new knowledge\narea that forms the basis of traditional companies, especially\nthose in high-tech industries. The application of high tech-\nnology, especially through the deployment of ICT, is an\nexpression of the knowledge society.\nDrucker (1994) develops more sociological ideas about\nthe knowledge society in The Age of Social Transformation,\nwhere he argues that \"[t]he old communities--family, vil-\nlage, parish--have all but disappeared [and their] place has\nbeen taken by the new unit of social integration, the organi-\nzation [simultaneously] is a means to a person's ends, a tool\"\n(p. 72). Human organization mediates between the individual\nand society. Besides, Drucker (1994) claims that, as the main\nsource of wealth, knowledge implies a new worldwide socio-\neconomic order in which its allocation will be the compass\nneedle of social and economic development based on knowl-\nedge. This enables competitiveness to be improved and mea-\nsured. According to Drucker (1994), \"[the] knowledge\nsociety will inevitably become far more competitive than\nany society we have yet known [and especially] more com-\npetitive for individuals than were the societies of the begin-\nning of this century, letalone earlier ones\" (p. 68).\nAt the advent of the entrepreneurial economy and knowl-\nedge society, there has emerged a new social class that\nDrucker refers to as \"knowledge workers\" (Kelloway &\nBarling, 2000), whose principal function is the generation of\nknowledge. Crucially, \"[k]nowledge work is not defined by\nquantity [but] by its results\" (Drucker, 1967, p. 7). As a new\nsocial class of specialized workers, knowledge workers will\ndemand new rules of management because they\nwill give the emerging knowledge society its character, its\nleadership, its social profile. They may not be the ruling class of\nthe knowledge society, but they are already its leading class.\nAnd in their characteristics, social position, values and\nexpectations, they differ fundamentally from any group in\nhistory that has ever occupied the leading position. (Drucker,\nNevertheless, recent research suggests that knowledge work-\ners are not immune to experiencing \"unfilled aspirations and\nIt is important to address what would appear to be new\nsocial class conflicts within the knowledge society. For\nA society in which knowledge workers dominate is under threat\nfrom a new class conflict: between the large minority of\nknowledge workers and the majority of people, who will make\ntheir living traditionally, either by manual work, whether skilled\nor unskilled, or by work in services, whether skilled or unskilled.\nFurthermore, an additional socioeconomic variable pro-\nducing change is innovation. The key question is where\ninnovation originates. The answer becomes rapidly evident\nas innovation is inherent in knowledge workers' own func-\ntions, expressed by entrepreneurship. Knowledge workers\nhave to bring about innovation (Magnier-Watanabe & Senoo,\nperhaps impressed by the Kudos knowledge workers as\nagents possess--having reflected on various key moments of\nhis personal life and professional career, as well as on the\nlives of historical figures, and especially on the works of his\npersonal friend and intellectual mentor JosephA. Schumpeter\nIn summary, the knowledge society, according to Drucker,\nis the new evolving environment that supports change\nthrough the influence of innovation. Innovation stems from\nintrinsic goods and affects on productivity and output. As an\nactivity, it sits alongside the process of converting the mis-\nsion into the achievement of results. Drucker (1985) suggests\nthat innovation is a discipline and entrepreneurship must be\nlearned, exploited, and integrated into the activities of an\norganization (Maciariello, 2009). Knowledge workers are an\norganization's main actors whose key function is to generate\nknowledge, which is the backbone of innovation. Knowledge\nin this context should be understood as technical knowledge\nthat has the power to improve the \"can-do\" attribute.\nIn this way, it becomes the leading dimension of the pro-\nductive process, the primary condition for its expansion, and\nthe key driver of competitive advantages within and among\nsocieties. Besides, knowledge has strong sociological impli-\ncations as it has the social significance of language, writing,\nand printing (Stehr, 2015). Knowledge implies the capacity\nfor action in social life. This means that the realization and\nimplementation of knowledge depends upon the social, eco-\nnomic, and intellectual context (Stehr, 1996). For these rea-\nsons, knowledge has to be available, interpreted, and linked\nto local circumstances.\nPeter Drucker's Management Theory\nDrucker is considered the father of modern management and\na leading analyst of social change. He began to deploy his\nintellectual interests in the mid-1930s when he emigrated to\nthe United States. His new life in America drove him to for-\nmulate some critical considerations concerning the function-\ning of society, inspired by the harsh experience he endured\nduring the build-up to the Second World War, when totalitar-\nian political regimes were spreading throughout Europe.\nDrucker's (1939) first writings in his adopted country were\nThe End of Economic Man--The Origins of Totalitarianism,\nand The Future of Industrial Man (Drucker, 1942). In these\nworks, he studies the functioning of capitalism and social-\nism, concluding that the hedonistic and materialistic goals of\nthe idealized homo economicus would lead these socioeco-\nnomic systems to eventually fail. The homo economicus is,\nof course, an abstraction that both capitalism and socialism\nfounded and promoted as an important ideal of effectiveness.\n4 SAGE Open\nIndeed, his conclusion is short and concise: \"Economic Man\nhas not only made himself superfluous through his material\nsuccesses; he has also failed politically, socially and meta-\nIn 1954, Drucker became a management consultant at\nGeneral Motors, the world's biggest corporation at the time,\nproviding him with firsthand experience of the analysis of\nmanagement processes. Prior to this, The Concept of the\nCorporation (Drucker, 1946) was his first systematic reflec-\ntion on the functions and structures of large businesses. For\nexample, he identified basic principles such as decentraliza-\ntion, promotion, and training that any firm should consider to\nbe competitive. If it is true that Drucker structured a theoreti-\ncal management model identifying some outstanding princi-\nples, he \"seldom brought these together into an integrated\nThis lack of a holistic systemic vision challenged\nMaciariello (2009) to formulate a number of proposals con-\ncerning a \"Drucker Management System\" (DMS) which inte-\ngrates and places marketing and innovation at the forefront.\nMaciariello develops a holistic model of Drucker's manage-\nment work--with the major purpose of evolving and validat-\ning an organization's \"theory of the business\" (p. 36). Within\nthis theoretical framework, we see the knowledge worker as\nequivalent to an executive. Maciariello's proposal acknowl-\nedges the overall integration of an executive's human actions\nthat should pursue effectiveness in marketing and innovation.\nExecutive effectiveness is the main goal of these special-\nized agents, according to this model. The analytical model is\ndeployed in four categories--skills, practices, tasks, and\nspirit of performance (i.e., the culture, the way that work gets\ndone)--that should be put into practice considering social\nimpacts and the common good of society (Drucker &\nagement theory recognizes that, in Drucker's thought, effec-\ntiveness is the basic and necessary condition of an executive's\nactions. To delimit the functions of agents, we will consider\nthe addition and interaction of skills, practices, spirit of per-\nformance, social impacts, and the good achieved by any\nhuman being or agent within this Druckerian model (Drucker,\nwithin an executive's mind, whereas they are simultaneously\nthe essence of motivation that grants the executive skills,\ntasks, and practices necessary to fulfill their functions.\nAt this stage of the article, it is possible to point to ethical\nissues and the morality in Drucker's thought. This last point\nof view demands making value judgments about the morality\nof human actions. One of Drucker's most important intel-\nlectual influences, the thought of Joseph A. Schumpeter,\nclassified the economic factor of work into entrepreneurs,\nworkers, and capitalists. Although Drucker acknowledges\nthe individual roles of the entrepreneur, the manager, and the\nworker, contemporary knowledge society demands that all of\nthese types take on the responsibilities and tasks of the\nknowledge worker.\nInitially, we clarify that there are two types of workers in\nDrucker's model. The first are manual workers identified\nwith managerial capitalism who work on the basis of pre-\nestablished routines with the ultimate goal expressed as\nimproving productivity. The second are knowledge workers\nidentified with entrepreneurial capitalism. In principle, from\nlow margin of initiative and creativity. His analysis, how-\never, needs to be seen against the background of U.S. indus-\ntrial productivity during and after the Second World War.\nThe role of manual workers in Drucker's models is over-\nshadowed by the role played by knowledge workers. Yet we\nshould also be aware that a fair number of service workers\nare engaged in the production and distribution of knowledge\nThe Characteristics of the Knowledge\nWorker\nHuman action is an outstanding variable in our analysis of\nknowledge workers' characteristics, intellectual virtues, and\nmoral character. Human action is an effective intervention in\nprocesses. A process is a series of events that are underway.\nAccording to Drucker (1967), \"[t]o be effective is the job of\nthe executive [and] the executive is, first of all, expected to\nget the right things done\" (p. 1, emphasis in original). As\nhomo sapiens faber, persons intervene in physical processes\nby means of technology. If they had not intervened in a vari-\nety of issues, many things would not exist. Therefore, human\naction takes on a creative and innovative sense (Polo, 1993).\nAs active beings who modify processes, people bring about\nfuture scenarios. Following classical thinking, we can divide\nhuman action into productive action and government action\n(Polo, 1993). Productive action refers to material and physi-\ncal processes (Polo, 1993). Government action refers to poi-\nesis or bringing forth, coming into being, and it is political in\nthe sense that it implies interrelationships among actors. The\ntruly practical in political action is language (Polo, 1993).\nGovernment action aims for improvement of societal\nactors by seeking to further their development via virtues,\nespecially via dialogue (Polo, 1993). Prudence is the intel-\nlectual virtue, and practical wisdom is the human character\ntrait underpinning government action. Applied to the prac-\ntice of management and the business world, government\naction refers to the activities of effective executives and\nmanagers who give orders within the confines of a frame-\nwork of norms, but who at the same time have to obey and\nreflect on their actions. Productive action and government\naction are interdependent phenomena. The former is impos-\nsible to achieve without the latter. Interdependency brings\nabout effectiveness.\nHuman action is related to ethics. Ethics is composed of\nvirtues, the common good, and norms (Polo, 1993). As\nopposed to vices, virtues demarcate an ultimate objective,\nwhich by definition is good. Human action requires goals,\nTurriago-Hoyos et al. 5\nmotivation, and resources (Polo, 1993). As we have seen,\nnorms are implicit in government action.\nA knowledge worker is a knowledge generator. As wealth\ngenerators par excellence, their human action contributes to\nthe most effective performance of the knowledge society.\nNowadays, knowledge workers \"own the tools of produc-\nstates that, as individuals,\nknowledge workers are dependent on the job. They receive a\nwage or salary. They have been hired and can be fired. Legally\neach is an employee. But collectively they are the capitalists;\nincreasingly, through their pension funds and other savings, the\nemployees own the means of production. (p. 71)\nDrucker outlines a number of personal characteristics that\nshape knowledge workers' productivity. More specifically,\nhe argues that, as opposed to the manual worker, the \"knowl-\nedge workers themselves define what the task is or should\nstresses that the knowledge society imposes responsibility\nfor their productivity on individual knowledge workers\nthemselves. In other words, \"managing oneself\" and being\nautonomous are central features of work in the knowledge\nsociety insofar as a knowledge worker needs to become\naware of personal strengths via feedback analysis, self-\nexamination, and building self-awareness (Drucker, 2005,\nFailing to follow these steps on a regular basis can easily\nlead to \"intellectual arrogance\" and \"bad habits,\" which\ndeter \"effectiveness and performance,\" eventually having a\nnegative effect on an individual's manner (Drucker, 1999,\np. 102). Perhaps more vital to managing oneself, however, is\nthe issue of a knowledge worker's values. Drucker refers to\nthis issue as the \"ultimate test,\" and warns that \"what one\ndoes well--even very well and successfully--may not fit\nwith one's value system\" or the value system of the organiza-\nMoreover, a central element in the life of a knowledge\nworker is the contribution the individual makes to an enter-\nprise and to society at large. Put differently, a knowledge\nworker's preoccupations need to be,\nWhat should my contribution be? . . . What does the situation\nrequire? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my\nvalues, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs\nto be done? And finally, what results have to be achieved to\nMoreover, managing oneself entails \"taking responsibil-\nity for relationships\" as, generally, \"people work with oth-\ners and are effective with other people\" (Drucker, 2005,\np. 107). Owing to the fact that the modern workplace is a\ncomplex site of human action with a diverse set of tasks and\nresponsibilities, understanding and knowing one's cowork-\ners and \"communicating sufficiently\" are pivotal factors in\naccording to Drucker (2005), nowadays enterprises \"are no\nlonger built on force but on trust\"; people do not actually\nneed to get along, but they must \"understand one another.\"\nFurthermore, Drucker (1985) follows a Schumpeterian\napproach, defining \"[i]nnovation [as] the specific tool of\nentrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an\nopportunity for a different business or a different service\" (p.\n17). Knowledge workers should \"[continue] innovation [as]\npart of [their] work, [their] task and [their] responsibility\"\nneed for \"continuous learning on the part of the knowledge\nworker,\" \"continuous teaching,\" and prioritizing quality over\nities which we can link with love of knowledge, love of\nlearning, and tenacity (see Table 1).\nA knowledge worker should be seen \"as an `asset' rather\nthan a `cost'\" and they should prefer \"to work for the organi-\nzation in preference to all other opportunities\" (Drucker,\nresearch-generated knowledge, so innovation produces\nresults which should be judged by its aims. Finally, human\naction is the conscious, free, and effective intervention in a\nThe Intellectual Virtues and Moral\nCharacter of the Knowledge Worker\nTaking into consideration that Drucker's work could be con-\nceptualized as a management system, as Maciariello (2009)\nproposes, and acknowledging the ethical problems of our\nage, the knowledge worker's actions and patterns of behav-\nior need to be explored via a set of virtues. Virtues design\ngood and stable human qualities, perfecting human intelli-\ngence and will by establishing capacities to know the truth\nand to excel in their actions to flourish within an environ-\nment that promotes freedom. Virtue is right conduct. The\n\"virtuous person\" is the person who practices virtues (Mel\u00e9,\n2009, p. 87). Virtues should be exercised daily to reach the\nideal of human virtuousness. In a nutshell, intellectual vir-\ntues can be taught and learned, whereas moral character\n(moral virtues) may be acquired by action, doing, repetition,\nDrucker's thought has deep Aristotelian roots (Kurzynski,\n2009). Aristotle coined the term eudaimonia, which can be\ntranslated as \"happiness\" or human flourishing, a notion that\nincludes both behaving well and faring well. In short, a life\nthat is complete and satisfying as a whole to the last, which\nis at the same time one's highest or supreme good (MacIntyre,\nSeveral authors have identified a number of intellectual or\nepistemic virtues (de Bruin, 2013; Rawwas, Arjoon, &\nWood, 2007), but they are not grounded in any philosophical\n6 SAGE Open\nor conceptual framework. We can understand the list of intel-\nlectual virtues within an Aristotelian framework (Macaulay\n& Arjoon, 2013). This framework identifies five founda-\ntional categories within which the list of virtues identified by\nthe various authors fit: understanding (the ability to grasp\ntruths without discursive reasoning), wisdom (the ability to\nunderstand realities in light of ultimate causes), science (the\nability to grasp conclusions in some specialized knowledge),\nart (the ability to make useful and artistic things), and pru-\ndence (the ability to discern the purpose of human activity\nand choose the appropriate means to achieve it).\nAlthough understanding, wisdom, and science are directed\ntoward knowledge, art and prudence are geared toward\naction and production. Table 1 provides the integral compo-\nnents of each of the five intellectual virtues, which are impor-\ntant for knowledge workers to possess and exercise. Table 1\nwas developed by matching the theoretical (the literature)\nwith the practical (Drucker's extensive work). From a survey\nof the literature of the intellectual or epistemic virtues, we\ncategorized the integral components (de Bruin, 2013; Hart,\nThe cardinal virtues of practical wisdom (prudence in\nclassical nomenclature), justice (friendship), courage (forti-\ntude in classical nomenclature), and moderation (temperance\nin classical nomenclature) develop the will. Prudence can be\nseen as both an intellectual and a moral virtue (Pieper, 1965).\nIn other words, we can learn prudence (i.e., identifying the\nright thing to do in a given situation) by instruction and by\naction or repetition.\nAccording to Drucker (2000), the virtue that guides the\nstudy of ethics in the West is prudence or practical wisdom.\n\"Practical wisdom therefore aids practical rationality in iden-\ntifying the right thing to do in each situation, in resolving\nconflicts between spontaneous motivations, and also in pro-\n`informs' the other virtues; it confers upon them the form of\ntheir inner essence. . . . Prudence works in all the virtues; and\nall virtue participates in prudence\" (Pieper, 1965, p. 7-8).\nKnowledge workers' actions are in the public domain and\nsubject to judgment, analysis, discussion, and interrogation.\nPrudence demands exemplary behavior of social agents. In\nthe West, prudence has sometimes ended in \"hypocrisy\"\nbecause it is nuanced in elaborated and judicious public rela-\ntions procedures (Drucker, 2000). Prudence is the intellec-\ntual virtue that supports all others. Second, prudence\ncontributes to the moral character trait of responsibility that\nensures the virtue of effectiveness in production processes\nand governance.\nThe whole idea of responsibility is associated with the capability\nof answering for one's own acts. [Responsibility] presupposes\nfreedom; that is, that individuals who act are in control of their\nactions [and] a responsible person is one who acts with\ndeliberation about his deeds and their consequences. (Mel\u00e9,\nIf a knowledge worker is self-managed and receives\nongoing feedback, it is due almost entirely to the fact that\nthey accept instruction and guidance, that is, coachability\n(see Table 1). Truthfulness (speaking the truth and not con-\ncealing it) is the intellectual virtue that ensures self-knowl-\nedge and discernment (see Table 1), but it is also supported\nby previous feedback activity carried out by superiors and\npartners to achieve an effective process (Drucker, 2005).\nTruthfulness also requires a certain dose of the moral charac-\nter trait of courage, \"persevering or pursuing what is good in\nspite of obstacles\" (Mel\u00e9, 2009, p. 88), to achieve consistent\nand constant corrective processes.\nFor Drucker (2000), another aspect is Confucianism,\nmarking an important difference between Eastern and\nWestern paradigms, which Drucker refers to as the Ethics of\nInterdependence, and which we link with responsibility as an\nelement of knowledge workers' moral character. We can\nassimilate interdependence with respect to others in personal\nrelationships by taking into account hierarchical position, for\nexample, from subordinates to chiefs. In the Eastern Ethics\nof Interdependence, all agents have obligations which are\nsocially oriented (Fernando & Moore, 2014). Confucian eth-\nics considers the abuse of strength and power in any relation-\nship to be unethical. Harmony is finally achieved if equity is\npresent in individual duties.\nDrucker (1954) explicitly identifies the morality required\nin the work of management, stating that\nmanagement . . . needs concrete, tangible, clear practices. These\npractices must stress building on strength rather than on\nweakness. They must motivate excellence. And they must\nexpress and make tangible that spirit is of the moral sphere, and\nthat its foundation therefore is integrity. (p. 146)\nIn fact, \"integrity . . . or the lack thereof . . . has enormous\neconomic implications [and] integrity is a factor of produc-\ntion as important as labour, capital, and technology\" (Erhard\nbased on individual integrity and morality. \"Integrity confers\nunity in making decisions coherent with [an individual's] per-\nsonal life project, and in integrating various relationships\n(family, business, and so on) into one's personal life. The\nFern\u00e1ndez (2009) points out, Drucker recognizes the spiritual\nconnection between individuals and their contribution to soci-\nety, so that by channeling knowledge into performance, people\nadvance their spiritual selves and improve social justice.\nKurzynski (2009) summarizes the work of management,\nstating that\nDrucker regarded the business corporation as a human\norganization, a social organization, a community and micro-\nsociety of the larger macro-society, in addition to being an\neconomic entity. His management philosophy is based on a\nTurriago-Hoyos et al. 7\ncommunitarian philosophy grounded in the belief that even in\nour individualistic society people still seek connection, meaning\nPut differently, this perspective highlights the importance of\nthe individual, and of the individual within the community.\nAs a cornerstone of Drucker's theoretical management foun-\ndations, it is possible to claim that, within the organizational\nlife, there are two primary assumptions.\nThe first is that management should consider the person\nas a whole, in other words, someone with virtues, responsi-\nbilities, and purpose. Second, the organization must be\nresponsible for developing the people employed by it but\nalso bear responsibility to society, that is, sustain the achieve-\nment of the common good. We also argue that it is advisable\nto analyze the ethical scope of innovation in the knowledge\nsociety because it is human action par excellence, and for\nthis reason, it is possible to frame ethics and value\njudgments.\nIn fact, if knowledge workers are responsible for their own\nactions, they then seek control over the consequences of inno-\nvation. They can carry out this reflection or \"feedback analy-\nresults, not only by having consciousness and control of their\nactions (limited form of self-knowledge) but also by master-\ning the processes that facilitate the advancement of innova-\ntion. Innovators may be responsible for these future events by\nmaintaining a constant willingness to correct and rectify, and\nalso complete tasks, which ties in with thoroughness, open-\nmindedness, and intellectual honesty (see Table 1).\nFurthermore, innovators are responsible for their actions\nin the process itself, whether a complete or incomplete pro-\ncess, whether it is starting or ending, and whether the agent\ndiscovers that the process is likely to produce undesirable\neffects. Polo (1993) argues that it is radically unethical when\nthere is no intervention in the process, in spite of knowing,\nfor instance, the malignant effects of an action. It is also not\nethical if nothing is done. Active and hands-on intervention\nis prudent because it seeks to achieve control today of future\neffects. The corrective involves formulating practical wis-\ndom or prudence.\nAnother important ethical reflection pertains to moral\ncharacter and, more specifically, to collaborative action or\ncooperation. This action should be expedient owing to col-\nlective human action always being performed in specialized\nteams. Innovation is a process and an activity that necessi-\ntates learning by interacting, and applying foresight and cul-\ntivating curiosity (see Table 1). This collaboration also means\nhaving effective access to sources of information. The notion\nof collaboration is linked to the principle of the common\ngood. According to Mel\u00e9 (2009), \"living in society, and more\nspecifically, in relationships with other people does not\nalways come about due to purely utilitarian interests.\nCollaborating and cooperating with others, and even helping\npeople, can be regarded as an end in itself.\" (p. 84)\nIn summary, as information is the pillar of knowledge,\nand knowledge, in turn, is pure organized information gained\nthrough research advanced by interdisciplinary teams, then\nresearch into the knowledge society is absolutely indispens-\nable, as if this is lacking, the outcomes pertaining to effec-\ntiveness and competitiveness are likely to be disturbing.\nIn short, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and work-\ners in the knowledge society are all knowledge workers. The\ncommon function of all coincides with the generation of\nknowledge, which is at the same time essential to bring about\ninnovation. Value judgments imply reasoning about the\nmorality of any action, good or bad. If virtues are defined as\nsomething that implies doing good, we can point out that any\naction that does not fulfill the requirement of a virtue is not a\nmoral action.\nConclusion\nIn the first place, some intellectual virtues and moral charac-\nter traits of knowledge workers are considered on an indi-\nvidual level. These are prudence, effectiveness, excellence,\nintegrity, truthfulness, practical wisdom, responsibility,\ncooperation, and courage. The same features, required by the\ncontemporary human labor collective, are elevated to organi-\nzational and societal levels with respect to the fulfillment of\nthe common good. The common good is simply a designa-\ntion to live the intellectual virtue and moral character of\neffectiveness and responsibility, both inside organizations\nand in society, under the umbrella of the authority principle.\nWe also establish that Drucker identifies two different\nethical systems. The first deployed in Western societies in\nwhich prudence is the guiding virtue, and the second, which\nDrucker denominates Ethics of Interdependence, in which\nauthority relationships are subscribed to that flourish in\nEastern societies.\nMorality is constituted as outcomes of human actions and\nis deployed with respect to excellence, integrity, exemplarity,\nand right behavior. It is worth noting that processes exist to\nimprove ethics and morality; practices must stress building\nupon strengths rather than upon weaknesses. At an organiza-\ntional level, the existence of organizations responsible for\ndeveloping the competencies and virtues of the people they\nemploy should be mandatory. Organizations and their boards\nof directors should consider the potentiality of persons as a\nwhole to improve their capabilities.\nDrucker's theoretical framework of knowledge workers is\nappropriate to describe the new person's functions within the\nknowledge society because it indicates the main functions\nneeded to achieve innovation. Knowledge supports innova-\ntion, and knowledge workers principally generate\nknowledge.\nCurrently, knowledge is the main source of human-gener-\nated wealth in the knowledge society. We can also state that\ninnovation is pure human action and it has a profoundly\nmoral character and significance as it is based on the social\n8 SAGE Open\nnature of human beings. Consequently, it also provides the\ncriteria for the discernment, orientation, and ultimate organi-\nzational foundations of social interaction.\nFor Drucker, the functions of knowledge workers are\ngrounded in a strong and well-defined ethical and anthropo-\nlogical framework. These functions arise from the need to\nachieve effectiveness and competitiveness in organizations\nand in society as a whole. These functions are specialized,\ncovering both the individual and social outlooks.\nThe complete fulfillment of knowledge workers' func-\ntions of applying critical and creative thinking promotes the\naccomplishment of the principle of the common good guid-\ning the primary goal of human affairs with respect to produc-\ntion, trade arrangements, political institutions, and social\nwelfare.\nTo develop lines of future research, we may consider how\nmanagement can foster practical ways to develop knowledge\nworkers'intellectual virtues and moral character in the work-\nplace. Furthermore, implications for management education\nshould be reflected upon to \"harness the power of each indi-\nvidual's unique reasons to act in a virtuous manner\" in con-\ntemporary knowledge society (Manz, Marx, Manz, & Neal,\n\"effectiveness can be learned\" over time via a process of rep-\netition that is similar to other pedagogical processes (p. 21).\nYet we should also be aware that cultivating knowledge\nworkers' virtues and moral character is fraught with diffi-\nculty because each virtue has a corresponding vice by defect\non one hand, and a vice by excess on the other. This then\nrepresents a real challenge both for the development of virtu-\nous behavior in the workplace and for management\neducation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArjoon, S., Turriago-Hoyos, A., & Thoene, U.
