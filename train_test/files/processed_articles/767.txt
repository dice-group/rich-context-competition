The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between religious activities and cigarette\nsmoking in community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods. Cigarette smoking and religious activities were assessed in a probability sample of 3968 persons age 65\nyears or older participating in the Duke Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) survey. Partici-\npants were asked if they currently smoked, if they ever smoked, and how many cigarettes per day they smoked. Atten-\ndance at religious services, participation in private religious activities (prayer or Bible study), and use of religious\nmedia (religious TV or radio) were also assessed. Data were available for Waves I--III of the survey (1986, 1989, and\n1992). Analyses were controlled for age, race, sex, education, alcohol use, physical health, and in the longitudinal anal-\nyses, smoking status at prior waves.\nResults. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that participants who frequently attended religious services were signifi-\ncantly less likely to smoke cigarettes at all three waves. Likewise, elders frequently involved in private religious activ-\nity were less likely to smoke (Waves II and III). Total number of pack-years smoked was also inversely related to both\nattendance at religious services and private religious activities. Watching religious TV or listening to religious radio, on\nthe other hand, was not related to smoking at Waves I and II nor to total pack-years smoked, but was postively related\nto current smoking at Wave III. Among those who smoked, number of cigarettes smoked was inversely related to fre-\nquency of attendance at religious services (Wave I), private religious activities (Wave III), and religious TV/radio\n(Waves II and III). Retrospective and prospective analyses revealed that religiously active persons were less likely to\never start smoking, not more likely to quit smoking.\nConclusions. Religiously active persons are less likely to smoke cigarettes, and if they do smoke, smoke fewer\ncigarettes. Given the association between smoking and disease, and the widespread prevalence of both smoking and\nreligious activity, this finding has implications for public health.\nCIGARETTE smoking is a common behavior in the\nUnited States, where over 25% of the population\nsmokes regularly (1). Most persons begin smoking during\ntheir youth and continue this behavior into adulthood. Peo-\nple continue to smoke not only because of preference or\nhabit, but because they become dependent on nicotine\nwhich is more addictive than alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine\n(2). Although age is inversely related to cigarette smoking,\nand 20% of older adults continue to smoke regularly (1,3).\nCigarette smoking causes an acceleration of the aging pro-\ncess of the lung and a loss of lung reserve (4). The inci-\ndence of lung cancer, now the leading cause of cancer\ndeath in both men and women in the United States, is about\n10 times higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers\n(5,6). Smoking has also been associated with increased\ncancer of the larynx (7,8), tongue (8), pharynx (8), esopha-\ngus (8), pancreas (9), and cervix (10), and has been related\nto leukemia and myeloma (11), hypertension (12), and\ncoronary artery disease (13). In fact, almost 50% of the dif-\nference in mortality rate between the sexes in the United\nStates can be accounted for by smoking alone (14). Cessa-\ntion of smoking by older adults, on the other hand, is asso-\nciated with a rapid reduction in pulmonary and cardiovas-\ncular morbidity and mortality (15).\nReligious belief and activity are also important to many\nolder Americans. Recent Gallup Polls and Barna surveys\nindicate that 53% of persons age 65 or older attend reli-\ngious services at least weekly, over 60% read religious\nConsequently, it is not surprising that nearly 75% of older\nadults report that religion is \"very important\" to them (16).\nIn fact, participation in church or synagogue activity is\nmore common in later life than all other forms of voluntary\nsocial activity combined (18). When health problems pre-\nvent older adults from attending religious services, per-\nsonal religious activities like prayer, Bible study, or reli-\ngious media viewing may become particularly important\n(19,20). Religious beliefs and practices, in turn, may im-\npact health and health behaviors (21).\nReligious groups have long instructed members on what is\npermissible with respect to diet, hygiene, exercise, and alco-\nhol, drug, or tobacco use (22). Examples include Kosher\nlaws that regulate diet and hygienic practices for Jews (23),\nJohn Wesley's teachings concerning health practices among\nMethodists (24), and prohibitions concerning alcohol and\ncigarette smoking by Mormons and Seventh-Day Adveritists\n(25). Although other groups such as Catholics, Episco-\npalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Baptists promote no\nspecific health practices as essential for membership, each\ntradition encourages behaviors that enhance health and well-\nbeing and discourage use of substances that adversely affect\nthe physical body (\"a temple of the Holy Spirit\") (26).\nThe initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking dur-\ning the teen years is strongly influenced by the smoking\nbehavior of both parents and peers (27). Active religious\nparticipation at that time might reinforce negative attitudes\ntoward use of tobacco and enhance social pressure to avoid\nsmoking. As expected, higher levels of religious belief and\nactivity have been associated with lower rates of tobacco\nuse in adolescence and young adulthood (28-32). Thus,\npersons who are religiously active during their early years\nmay never acquire the smoking habit and therefore may be\nspared many smoking-related diseases later in life.\nA number of studies have now demonstrated lower rates\nof certain types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, respira-\ntory diseases, and overall mortality in Mormons (33) and\nSeventh-Day Adventists (34), findings that have been ex-\nplained at least in part by smoking behavior. Greater reli-\ngious activity or commitment has also been linked with\nlower rates of smoking among young adult African Ameri-\ncan women (35) and adults in New Zealand (36) and the\nU.S. (37,38). No study, however, has examined the rela-\ntionship between cigarette smoking and religious activity in\npersons age 65 and older in the United States. We expect\ncertain forms of religious activity, particularly organized\nreligious activity, to be associated with lower rates of\nsmoking in older adults, many of whom may receive much\nsocial support from members of the religious community\n(18,39). Private religious activities like prayer or Bible\nstudy, being reflective of greater religious commitment,\nmight also be associated with lower rates of smoking. More\npassive religious involvement, however, such as religious\nTV viewing or radio listening, may have less of an effect\non such behavior.\nIn the current study, we examine religious behaviors and\ncigarette smoking in a random sample of 3,968 older adults\nliving in North Carolina. North Carolina is located in an\narea of the United States where religious activity is preva-\nlent. Likewise, a relatively large proportion of the popula-\ntion smokes cigarettes, and the tobacco industry continues\nto be an important contributor to the state's economic well-\nbeing, as it has been for many years. Thus, a high rate of\nboth cigarette smoking and religious activity in this loca-\ntion makes it an ideal setting to study the religion-smoking\nrelationship. In addition, the multiwave nature of this study\nenables the examination of how religious activity influ-\nences smoking behavior over time.\nWe hypothesize that (a) increased frequency of religious\nactivity will be associated with lower rates of current and\nprevious cigarette smoking (particularly among elders who\nfrequently attend religious services and pray or study the\nBible); (b) among those who currently smoke, the number\nof cigarettes smoked per day will be lower among those\nwho are more religiously active; (c) greater religious activ-\nity will be associated with cessation of smoking in the past,\nand (d) religious activity at earlier waves will predict lower\nrates of smoking at later waves.\nMETHODS\nThe sample consisted of participants in the three in-per-\nson interviews (henceforth referred to as Waves I--III) con-\nducted as part of the National Institutes of Health spon-\nsored Establishment of Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudies of the Elderly (EPESE) project, Duke University\nsite. Subjects were identified for the initial interview (Wave\nI) using a four-stage stratified probability sample of persons\nfrom five contiguous counties (one urban, four rural) in\ncentral North Carolina. In the first stage, 450 primary sam-\npling units of approximately equal population size were\nselected from the survey area. In the second stage, one list-\ning area was selected from each sampling unit. In the third\nstage, all households in a listing area were enumerated and\na certain number were randomly selected from this list. In\nthe fourth stage, the Kish method (40) was used to select a\nperson age 65 or older from each eligible household (per-\nsons were identified not by letter or telephone call but by\nknocking on doors). Approximately half of the final sample\ncame from the urban county and the rest from the rural\nones. Because one of the original study aims was to exam-\nine black-white differences, blacks were oversampled.\nIn this manner, 5,223 eligible persons were identified;\nexcluded from the present analysis, leaving 4,000 partici-\npant interviews. Data on both smoking and religious activi-\nties were available on 3,968 respondents who formed the\nWave I sample for this report. Wave II took place in 1989\nwhen 3,336 in-person or proxy interviews were conducted;\n664 subjects were not reinterviewed because they.had either\ndied (three quarters), refused, or were lost to follow-up.\nData were available on both cigarette smoking and religious\nactivities for 3,152 subjects, the Wave II sampie for this\nproxy interviews were conducted; the remaining 1,432 par-\nticipants had either died (80%), refused, or were lost to fol-\nlow-up. There were data on both cigarette smoking and reli-\ngious activities for 2,396 subjects, the Wave III sample.\nMeasures\nIn-person interviews were conducted by trained research\nassistants. Included, in the survey was information on par-\nticipants' demographic characteristics, religious activity,\nand denomination, health status, and health behaviors\n(smoking and alcohol use).\nDemographic variables.--Age (years, as a continuous\nvariable), sex (male - 6; female =1), race (white = 0, black\n= 1), education (years, as a continuous variable), and reli-\ngious denomination were measured at Wave I.\nReligious activity.--Religious activities measured at each\nwave included frequency of attendance at religious meet-\nings or services (measured on a six-point scale, from never\nto more than once a week), frequency of prayer, meditation\nor Bible study (measured on a five-point scale, from never\nto daily or more often), and frequency of watching religious\nTV or listening to religious radio (six-point scale ranging\nfrom never to more than once a week). For categorical\nanalyses, response options were combined to reduce the\nnumber of categories and ensure adequate cell size for anal-\nysis; for other analyses (e.g., correlations), response cate-\ngories were left in continuous form.\nPhysical health.--Different religious activities are known\nto be either less common (church attendance) or more com-\nmon (private prayer/Bible reading) among those in poorer\nhealth, and cigarette smoking is known to have adverse\nhealth effects (41). The health measure used in this study\nwas based on the presence of five physical conditions at\nWave I: heart problems, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and\ncancer (42). For each condition (e.g., level of hypertension),\n36 physicians provided ratings to indicate its impact on\nphysical health (43). Physician raters were faculty or fellows\nin the Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Duke\nUniversity Medical Center; all had extensive experience\nwith elderly adults. When a condition was present, a respon-\ndent was given a score equal to the mean physician rating\nfor that condition. These scores were summed across condi-\ntions to form a continuous variable (other analyses not\nshown here indicate that the effects of having multiple phys-\nical illnesses are probably additive, but not multiplicative).\nFor categorical analyses, the variable was dichotomized at\nthe midpoint of its distribution in the population (good\nhealth = 0, poor health = 1); for other analyses (correla-\ntions), it was left as a continuous variable.\nHealth behaviors.--Cigarette smoking was determined at\neach wave by the following questions: (a) \"Do you smoke\ncigarettes regularly now?\"; (b) if no, \"Did you ever smoke\ncigarettes regularly?\" (Wave I); and (c) \"On the average\nhow many cigarettes per day did you [or do you] usually\nsmoke?\". Number of \"pack-years\" was also determined for\ncurrent or former smokers at Wave I. Participants were\nasked how old they were when they first began smoking and\nhow old they were when they last smoked cigarettes regu-\nlarly. The number of years the subject smoked was then\nmultiplied by the average number of packs of cigarettes\nsmoked per day (20 cigarettes per pack) during that time.\nAlcohol use is known to correlate with both smoking\n(44) and religious activity (45). In this study, alcohol use\nwas determined at each wave by asking the following ques-\ntions: \"Have you had any beer or ale during the past year?\";\n\"Have you had any wine during the past year?\"; \"Have you\nhad any liquor in the past year?\". Answering \"yes\" to any\nof these questions indicated alcohol use.\nStatistical Analyses\nSample weights were used to adjust the sample distribu-\ntions for probability of selection within households of vary-\ning sizes, to adjust for biases due to nonresponse, and to\nmatch the demographic characteristics of the five county\narea determined by the U.S. Bureau of Census (particularly\nnecessary because blacks were oversampled). All statistical\nanalyses and percentages, unless otherwise noted, were\nweighted; numbers of subjects (Ns) were actual numbers,\nnot weighted numbers. Cross-tabulation was used to exam-\nine the distribution of smoking status (yes/no) by level of\nreligious activity. For categorical outcomes, two-step logis-\ntic regression was used to examine the association between\nsmoking status and each religious variable. First, the reli-\ngious variable was examined alone in the model; second,\nthe covariates age, sex, race, alcohol use, education, and\nphysical health were added to the model to control for their\neffects. Odds ratios were obtained from the logistic regres-\nsion procedures. For analyses predicting future smoking\nstatus (e.g., Wave I religious activity predicting Wave II\nsmoking status), smoking status during the previous wave\n(e.g., Wave I) was included in the model (residualized\nchange analysis). For continuous variables (number of\ncigarettes smoked per day or number of pack-years), Pear-\nson correlation was used for bivariate comparisons. Partial\ncorrelation was then used to partial out the effects of age,\nsex, race, education, alcohol use, and physical health.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 gives the characteristics of participants at each of\nthe three waves of the survey. Median age at the baseline\nevaluation was 73 years; about two thirds of the sample\nwere women and over 50% were black (due to oversam-\npling). The effects of dropouts were quite small, although\nthere was a trend towards less alcohol use, decreased cig-\narette smoking, and increased private religious activities\nfrom Wave I to Wave III among participants remaining in\nthe study. In general, frequency of religious activities\ntended to remain stable during the six-year follow-up\nperiod; there was no evidence for greater religiousness\namong those who died or dropped out.\nHypothesis 1\nIncreased frequency of religious activity will be associ-\nated with a decreasedfrequency of smoking. This hypothe-\nsis was supported for attendance at religious services and\nprivate religious activity such as prayer or Bible study but\nnot for religious TV or radio. Religious service attendance\nwas significantly related to smoking status at all three\nwaves (Wave I attendance vs Wave I smoking, Wave II\nattendance vs Wave II smoking, and Wave III attendance vs\nWave III smoking) (Figure 1 and Table 2). These associa-\ntions persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, educa-\ntion, alcohol use, and health status. Persons who attended\nreligious services at least once a week at Wave I were 25%\nmore likely not to smoke cigarettes at Wave I than those\nFrequency of private prayer and Bible study was related\nto smoking status at Waves II and III, but not at Wave I.\nUnlike attendance at religious services and private religious\nactivities, however, religious TV watching or radio listen-\ning was unrelated to smoking status--except at Wave HI,\nwhere it was positively related (e.g., persons who watched\nreligious TV/radio frequently were more likely to smoke).\nAge, years\nSex (% women)\nRace (% black)\nEducation, years\nAlcohol use (% yes)\nCigarette smoking (% yes)\nFormer cigarette smoker\u00a7 (% yes)\nCigarettes per day||\nReligious denomination (% Baptist)\nAttend religious services (% one or more per week)\nReligious TV/radio (% once or more per week)\nPrivate religious activities (% daily)\nWave I\nMean (SD) / Col. %\nWave II\nMean (SD) 1 Col. %\n--\nWave III\nMean (SD)/Col. %\n--\nNote: Col., column.\n*Participants with both religious activity and smoking data; n may vary up to 3%.\nt'i may vary up to 9% (primarily due to missing data on alcohol use).\npi may vary up to 10% (primarily due to missing data on alcohol use).\n\u00a7Among those not currently smoking.\n||Among those who smoke.\nB% smoking\nIpack-years\nFrequency of Attendance at Religious Services\nFigure 1.

Private religious activity was also inversely\nrelated to number of cigarettes smoked at each wave,\nalthough the association retained its significance after con-\ntrolling for other covariates only at Wave III. Religious TV\nor radio listening, on the other hand, was more consistently\nrelated to cigarettes smoked. This activity was inversely\nrelated to number of cigarettes smoked at all three waves,\nand associations at Waves II and III retained their signifi-\ncance when other covariates were controlled.\nHypothesis 3\nGreater religious activity will be associated with cessa-\ntion of smoking in the past.

We examined the ability of religious\nactivity at Wave I to predict smoking status at Waves II and\nIII, using logistic regression to control for smoking status at\nWave I, age, sex, race, education, alcohol use, and health\nstatus; the same was done for religious activity at Wave II\npredicting smoking status at Wave III.\nAttendance at religious services and religious TV/radio\nactivity at Wave I and Wave II were weak and nonsignifi-\ncant predictors of smoking status at Wave II and Wave III\n(Table 2). Private religious activity at Wave I, on the other\nhand, was a significant predictor of smoking status at Wave\nII. Persons who prayed or studied the Bible more often at\nWave I were more likely than other participants not to\nsmoke cigarettes (either stop or continue not to smoke) at\nWave II; this effect weakened by Wave III and did not\nreplicate for Wave II private religious activity predicting\nWave III smoking status.

Cigarette smokers, taken as a whole,\nhave a 30-80% higher death rate than nonsmokers, with\nmost of the excess mortality due to coronary heart disease\nand lung cancer (46). In the present study, we found that\nolder adults who frequently attended religious services or\nengaged in private religious activities like prayer or Bible\nstudy were significantly less likely to smoke cigarettes, and\nif they did smoke, smoked fewer cigarettes per day than\nless religiously active elders. Those who both attended reli-\ngious services at least once a week and prayed or studied\nthe Bible at least daily were almost 90% more likely not to\nsmoke than persons less involved in these religious activi-\nties. Participants more likely to pray or study the Bible at\nWave I were also significantly less likely to be smokers at\nWave II. Although religious TV or radio activity was unre-\nlated to or positively related to cigarette smoking, those\nwho smoked and frequently watched or listened to religious\nmedia programs smoked fewer cigarettes per day than other\nsmokers. Thus, all three forms of religious activity mea-\nsured here were related to less overall cigarette smoking.\nDurkheim (47) emphasized the socially integrative aspects\nof religious participation, and how social influences from a\nreligious group may contribute to the development of per-\nsonal identity and consequently affect behavior. Religious\ngroups model prosocial behaviors, and as we noted earlier,\nmay have proscriptions against the use of addictive or physi-\ncally harmful substances. Religious practice offers the person\nan opportunity to form social bonds with others who share\npositive beliefs concerning health and health habits. This pro-\ncess likely begins in adolescence or early adulthood, when\nsocialization experiences within religious settings may be par-\nticularly powerful in preventing the onset of tobacco use.\nFuthermore, older adults who participate in religious\nactivities may cope better with stress and therefore experi-\nence less of a need to depend on tobacco use. Cigarette\nsmoking has increasingly become a marker for deprivation\nassociated with consumption of other drugs and alcohol\n(48,52). In contrast, studies have demonstrated lower rates\n(38,57) for persons who are more religiously involved. The\npositive association between current cigarette smoking and\nreligious TV/radio activity may be relevant in this regard.\nOther reports have found that persons who frequently\nwatch or listen to religious TV or radio have poorer physi-\ncal health and may be more troubled in a variety of ways\n(41,56), perhaps making them more prone to smoking\n(analyses in the present study, though, were adjusted for\nphysical health). We have hypothesized elsewhere that pas-\nsively watching religious TV programs or listening to reli-\ngious radio programs may not have the health benefits of\nmore active religious participation (41).\nInterestingly, the lower rates of cigarette smoking among\nreligiously involved elders in this study did not appear to be\ndue to a higher rate of smoking cessation but rather to never\nhaving smoked. This emphasizes the importance of religious\nactivity in terms of disease prevention, particularly because\nthe negative health effects of smoking tend to be cumulative\nand relate to total exposure to cigarette smoke over a life-\ntime (46). If religious involvement can help prevent the\nonset of smoking in adolescence and young adulthood\n(28-32), it may have considerable impact from a public\nhealth perspective. A lower smoking rate among the reli-\ngiously active can also help explain the lower overall mor-\ntality of this group in general (58-61) and their lower death\nrate from cardiovascular diseases (62-64) in particular.\nTo get a better sense of the impact that smoking might be\nhaving on the health of study participants, we examined the\neffects of being a smoker at Wave I on mortality over the\ncation using Cox proportional hazards regression. Dates of\ndeath were confirmed using death certificates. As expected,\nsmokers were over 50% more likely to die than were non-\nThus, we would anticipate that lower rates of smoking\namong religiously active elderly persons is likely to have\nsubstantial health benefits.\nLimitations\nAlthough the findings from this study include longitudi-\nnal data suggesting that religious activity at one point in\ntime can influence smoking behavior 3 years later, these\nresults were not as robust or as consistent as were the cross-\nsectional associations. This makes statements about reli-\ngious activity \"causing\" lower rates of smoking quite tenta-\ntive. An alternative explanation could be that cigarette\nsmoking has a negative impact on participation in religious\nactivities. It is also possible that other unmeasured variables\ncould account for the associations between religious activity\nand smoking observed here. Nevertheless, the size and con-\nsistency of the associations, the similar results reported by\nother investigators examining different populations and age\ngroups, and the clear rationale for the presence of such asso-\nciations, argue for the validity of these results.\nLack of an objective measure of smoking status may have\nalso affected the results of this study, because religious per-\nsons may have minimized the amount they smoked. The\nmajor focus of the EPESE survey, however, was not about\nreligion. The few questions pertaining to religion were imbed-\nded in a questionnaire with literally hundreds of other ques-\ntions about health and social activities, which was adminis-\ntered by trained secular interviewers. Furthermore, given the\nwidespread knowledge of smoking's effects on health and the\nhealth of others, there is probably a general tendency to mini-\nmize reports of smoking (65). We are aware of no data, how-\never, that suggest that religious persons are intrinsically less\nhonest about their habits than nonreligious persons.\nFinally, the generalizability of our findings may be lim-\nited by the geographic location of the study in the Bible\nBelt region of the United States, where religious activities\nare part of the social fabric of society and over 60% of the\npopulation is Baptist. Over one half of our sample attended\nreligious services at least weekly, prayed, or read the Bible\nat least daily, and three quarters watched religious media\nprograms at least once a week or more. As noted before,\nhowever, older Americans tend to be quite religious in gen-\nFuture Research\nFuture studies are needed to clarify what specific aspects\nof religious activity are responsible for the inverse relation-\nship with smoking. Is it the social aspects of religion, the\npersonal commitment to religion, or the specific content of\nreligious belief that primarily fuels this relationship? For\nexample, it may be interesting to compare a group of\nagnostic elderly persons who attend the YMCA several\ntimes a week or some other social group activity where\nsmoking is prohibited and see if differences in smoking are\nsimilar in magnitude to that seen with those who participate\nin religious activities.\n"
