With a detailed literature review, this study investigated\nthe acquisition sequence, differences, and difficulties of English articles by ELLs with diverse first language backgrounds.\nEighteen college ELLs participated in the study. Data were collected through cloze exercises. The results, through the analysis\nof its database of 6,178 article used, indicated that \"zero article\" was the last to be acquired while article \"a\" is the first\nto be acquired; positive correspondence existed between the growth of the acquisition of article \"a/an,\" \"the,\" and \"zero\"\nbetween \"+Art\" (with article system) group and \"-Art\" (without article system) group. The results also revealed that (a) the\nmost difficult article for participants in both groups to acquire was \"zero article,\" (b) \"the\" was the most difficult article for\nparticipants in \"+Art\" group, and (c) \"a\" was the easiest one acquired by both groups. These findings, in fact, challenge the\ncommonsense belief that \"+Art\" ELLs acquired English articles faster than \"-Art\" ELLs and that when two languages were\nsimilar, positive transfer would occur.\n",

However, English-as-a-second language learners\n(ELLs), especially those whose first languages (L1) do not\nhave the equivalent article systems, tend to have difficulty\nacquiring English articles (Chen, 2000; Ionin & Montrul,\nsequence, differences, and difficulties of English article by\nELLs whose L1 has, or does not have, the equivalence of\nEnglish article system (+Art or -Art).\nDefinition of Definite Article (the),\nIndefinite Article (a or an), and Zero\nArticle\nAccording to Leech and Svartvik (1994), there were two arti-\ncles in English: the definite article the (as in the book) and the\nindefinite article a (as in a book) or an (as in an eye).\nSometimes, noun requires no article at all, the zero article\n(books, eyes). They said, the definite article the, the indefinite\narticle a or an, and zero article were used for different pur-\nposes. The major use of the definite article the was to demon-\nstrate that the noun referred to a particular example of\nsomething (Richards, Platt, & Platt, 1992). They also pointed\nout that the major use of the indefinite article a or an was to\ndemonstrate that the noun referred to something general or to\nsomething not having been identified by the speaker.\nwere two types of zero article. Yotsukura (1970) found it nec-\nessary to separate two types of NP (noun phrase) occurring\nwithout (visible) articles, which he defined as the zero forms.\nThis is consistent with the believes of Palmer (1939), Sinclair\nrated zero (indefinite, with mass and plural) and null (definite,\nwith singular proper nouns and some singular count nouns).\nHowever, no unified theory of English articles was yet\navailable (Chesterman, 1991). This study was governed by\nthe definition mentioned above and focuses on a or an, the,\nand zero article.\n1State University of New York College at Old Westbury, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGanzhao Sun, State University of New York College at Old Westbury,\nEmail: sung@oldwestbury.edu\nThe Acquisition of English Articles\nby Second Language Learners: The\nSequence, Differences, and Difficulties\nGanzhao Sun1\n Keywords\napplied linguistics, English article, language studies, second language acquisition, second language teaching and learning\n2 SAGE Open\nLiterature Review\nStudies on Article Acquisition by L1 Learners\nDespite the abundant studies on second language (L2) acqui-\nsition (Geranpayeh, 2000), the literature has yet revealed\nlimited studies on article acquisition by ELLs. Before the\nexploration of English article acquisition by ELLs, it is\nessential to review the major studies that relate to the acqui-\nsition of English articles by L1 learners.\nOutstanding contributors to the study of article acquisi-\ntion by L1 learners are Zehler and Brewer (1982), Whitman\nZehler and Brewer (1982) examined the sequence and\nprinciples in article system used by L1 learners. They found\nan early acquisition sequence of zero article use, a use only,\nessentially correct a and the patterns of use, and overex-\ntended the use.\nBased on the assumption that English article structure was\na sequence of quantification and determination rather than a\nchoice between specified and unspecified, Whitman (1974)\nrecommended pedagogical sequence.\nAccording to Bickerton (1981), the most comprehensive\nexamination of the acquisition of English articles was that of\nralistic observation that the article system was mastered at a\nvery early stage by L1 learners.\nBickerton (1981) also found that some of Maratsos's\nand Karmiloff-Smith (1979) who questioned the earliness\nwith which the definite\u00adnondefinite distinction was acquired.\nIn his language bioprogram hypothesis, Bickerton (1984)\nindicated that there was a SNSD (specific\u00adnonspecific dis-\ntinction) by English-speaking children. When examining\nchild's early language, he found an outstanding higher per-\ncentage of articles demonstrated in specific-reference NP,\nwhereas zero articles would have continuously existed in the\nnon-specific environment longer than anywhere else. Hence,\nhe claimed the innateness of the SNSD. That is, human beings\nhave an innate ability to make distinctions of specific- and\nnon-specific-reference NP. The SNSD would be quite impos-\nsible to learn by means of linguistic data. It is innate.\nreference was marked by zero article, but the persistence of\nthe notion in advanced--proficiency of non-native English\nspeakers and the evidence from the pidgin studies suggested\nthat unambiguous specific reference was also likely con-\nnected to the zero article (as cited in Master, 1997).\nbelieved that the article system was mastered at a very early\nSNSD, as aforementioned, emphasized the innate perspec-\ntive of article acquisition.\nHowever, Chesterman (1991) challenged the theory of\nSNSD, claiming that it was not helpful to link article use too\ndirectly to noun class, and hence, to the distinction between\ncount and non-count.\nBioprogram and Article Acquisition by ELLs\nWorthwhile to mention are Ionin (2003) and Ionin, Ko, and\nWexler (2004), who applied Bickerton's bioprogram theory\nto English articles acquisition by ELLs.\nIonin (2003) found that through UG (universal grammar),\nELLs could assess semantic distinctions beneath article\nchoice and there was a specificity distinction that discrimi-\nnated the definiteness distinction.\nIonin etal. (2004) investigated the role of specificity in\narticle semantics and asserted that articles could interpret the\nfeature +definite or the feature +specific. They found that\nELLs could approach universal semantic features +definite\nand +specific and there was direct access to universal seman-\ntic features and +specific features.\nStudies on Sequence, Differences, and Difficulties\nof Article Acquisition by ELLs\nUnlike the acquisition of English article by L1 learners, the\nEnglish article system is one of the most difficult aspects of\nEnglish grammar for ELLs and one of the last to be fully\nacquired (Master, 1987). Following are some outstanding\nstudies on the article acquisition sequence, differences, and\ndifficulties by ELLs of various L1 backgrounds.\nEkiert (2004) examined the L2 development sequence of\narticle acquisition by Polish-speaking ELLs and found evi-\ndence supporting the hypothesis that the sequence of L2\narticle acquisition mainly followed the L1 natural order of\narticle acquisition. Lu (2001) investigated acquisition\nsequence by Chinese-speaking ELLs and found an order of\nthe = a > , and the > a > , among all groups.\nThrough the study on the acquisition of the English defi-\nnite article by Chinese- and Malay-speaking ELLs, Wong\nand Quek (2007) found that the acquisition sequence of the\nfour non-genetic uses of the followed a natural order of situ-\nation > structural > textual > cultural, regardless of their L1\nbackgrounds, and the L2 rate of accuracy on article usage\nimproved outstandingly as proficiency level increased.\ntem could be learned through the separation between classifica-\ntion (a and zero) and identification (the). He claimed that\nspeakers of -Art needed more time to acquire the article system\nthan +Art speakers did, but they would eventually acquire it.\nzero--for--the errors would continue to occur until advanced\ninterlanguage for -Art speakers. He found that +Art group pro-\nduced larger number of correct answers than the -Art group.\nThe English articles acquisition order was null > the > a in the\n(-Art) group and the > null > a in the (+Art) group.\nThrough the examination of the acquisition sequence of\nEnglish article functions, Park (1996) found that French and\nGerman students (+Art) earned higher scores than the\nJapanese and Korean students (-Art). In addition, the acqui-\nsition order of English article functions was similar no mat-\nter whether or not L1 had an article system.\nSnape, Garc\u00eda-Mayo, and Gurel (2013) studied L2 acqui-\nsition of English generic NPs by Spanish-speaking ELLs\n(+Art), Turkish-speaking ELLs whose L1 had an indefinite\narticle but no definite article, and Japanese-speaking ELLs\n(-Art). They found that L2 article preference was mainly\ninfluenced by their L1.\nIonin, Montrul, Kim, and Philippov (2011) investigated\nwhether Russian- and Korean-speaking ELLs (-Art) could\ndiscriminate different kinds of English genericity. Their\nstudy showed that although their L2 showed zero article for\nplural nouns and indefinite article for singular generics, it did\nnot demonstrate the acquisition of definite article for singu-\nlar generics.\nIonin and Montrul (2010) examined L2 acquisition of the\nexpression of plural NPs. The results of the study supported the\nhypothesis that Spanish-speaking ELLs (+Art) over-accepted\nthe generic expression of English definite plurals far more than\nKorean-speaking ELLs whose L1 had no article system (-Art).\nIonin, Zubizarreta, and Philippov (2009) investigated English\narticle use by ELLs of adults and children, whose L1 was\nRussian (-Art). They found that both groups of learners dem-\nonstrated sensitivity to definiteness and specificity.\nIonin, Zubizarreta, and Maldonado (2008) explored three\nsources of knowledge in the acquisition of English articles\nby L2 learners: L1-transfer, L2-input, and Universal\nGrammar. They found that all three sources were related to\nthe English article acquisition.\nThrough the examination on L1 transfer in article acquisi-\ntion, Sharma (2005) found that the new article system pro-\nduced by L2 learners showed no resemblance with their L1\narticle system. Definite article the did not disappear com-\npletely in their speech when their L1 had no article, although\nL1 transfer was obvious when it contained the specific indef-\ninite article a. Zegarac (2004) investigated the relevance\ntheory (Sperber & Wilson, 1995) for the acquisition of\nEnglish article \"the\" by ELLs of -Art. He found that L2\nlearning was influenced not only by L1 transfer but also\nthrough the process of designing and testing hypotheses.\nRomaine (2003) found that ELLs of +Art made faster\nprogress than those without one.\nMayo and Pilar (2008) found that (a) the \"four nongeneric\nuse\" of articles demonstrated different difficulty levels for\nthe ELLs, (b) ELLs' \"underuse of obligatory the\" decreased\noutstandingly from elementary to low-intermediate level\nuntil they moved up to advanced levels (pp. 550-565), (c) the\nparticipants' performance in the overuse of the was strongly\ninfluenced by their L1 and improved significantly with pro-\nficiency level, and (d) the difficulty level for an ELL setting\nwas substantial.\nGeranpayeh (2000) examined the difficulties of English\narticle acquisition by Persian-speaking ELLs and found that\nthese ELLs had problems identifying the English definite\nmarker when it was in the subject position.\nChen (2000) indicated that English article could be one of\nthe most difficult grammatical components for Taiwanese\nELLs because L1 (Chinese) did not have article system. He\nalso claimed that errors made by these ELLs were due to L1\ninterference.\nPurpose of the Study\nDespite the outstanding aforementioned studies on English\narticle acquisition, the acquisition sequence, differences, and\ndifficulties by ELLs remain to be further explored. Based on\nthe definition of articles and literature review of article\nacquisition mentioned above, this study examined the\nsequence, differences, and difficulties of article acquisition\ndemonstrated by ELLs with various L1 backgrounds.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants of the study (Table 1) are 18 college stu-\ndents learning English as a second language (ESL) at a lan-\nguage institute in the United States, with age ranging from\n20- (from18) to 30+. The participants were divided into three\nlevels according to the level of ESL class they were\nattending.\nLevel A participants were students placed in advanced\nclasses according to college placement testing (with an\nequivalent Test of English as a Foreign Language [TOFEL]\nmale and three were female. They had various L1 back-\ngrounds--Korean, Chinese, Spanish, French, and Hebrew\nand had been in the United States for at least 2 years.\nLevel B participants were those who were placed in the\nintermediate classes based on college placement test (with an\nwere male and four were female. Their L1s were Polish,\nFrench, Spanish, Russian, and Urdu. They had been in the\nUnited States for at least 9 months.\nLevel C participants were students attending the begin-\nners' classes according to college placement test (with an\nequivalent TOFEL score below 300). Among them, two were\nfemale and four were male. Their L1s were Spanish, French,\nUrdu, and Bangla, and they had been in the United States for\nat least 3 months.\nData Collection\nData were collected by means of cloze exercises (sample,\nAppendix A). Participants were asked to complete conversa-\ntion, dialogues, sentences, and paragraphs with article a or\n4 SAGE Open\nan, the, or zero. The participants were required to complete\nData Analysis\nAfter the cloze exercises of the 18 participants were com-\npleted, the answers were corrected according to the answer\nkeys provided by the resource. The scores were categorized\ninto three groups: Level A (Advanced), Level B\n(Intermediate), and Level C (Beginning) under the forms of\narticle a or an, the, and zero, and the percentage and raw\nscores were documented (sample table of data analysis,\nAppendix B).\nReliability of the Data\nTo insure the reliability of the data, three major consider-\nations were taken. First, the same length of time and condi-\ntion were provided for each group of participants. Second,\nKuder\u00adRichardson reliability coefficient (K-R 21) formula\nto estimate internal consistency. Third, the cloze exercises\nwere corrected according to the answer keys provided by the\nresources so that subjective judgment could be avoided.\nResults of the Studies\nThe results of the study (Appendix Table C1) show that in\nthe group of Level A (Advanced), the participants demon-\n210) for article the.

Participants of the Study.\nLevel Participant Gender Age L1 L1 article system Years learning English Years in the United States\nNote.

The participants whose L1s do not contain\narticle systems demonstrated an accuracy of 87.5% (70 out\nof 80) for article a or an. They demonstrated an accuracy of\nparticipants showed an accuracy of 8.3% (5 out of 60).\nDiscussion, Conclusion, and\nImplications\nThrough the study (Appendix Table D1), the following was\nfound and discussed:\nFirst of all, the scores in Appendix Table D1 indicate that\nthe most significant difference demonstrated in the acquisi-\ntion of article a or an, article the, and zero article at Level B\nbetween ELLs whose L1 had article systems and those whose\nL1 had no article systems.\nNext, significant difference was also demonstrated in zero\narticle acquisition at Levels B and C between ELLs whose\nL1 had article systems and ELLs whose L1 had no article\nsystems.\nFinally, the results shown in Appendix Table D1 indicate\nthat it was consistent with what Master (1987) found: that\n(+Art) group had produced larger number of correct answers\nthan (-Art) group. However, different finding demonstrates\nthat the acquisition sequence of the English articles was a >\nthe > zero for Levels A and C and the > a > zero for Level B\nparticipants in (-Art) group and a > the > zero for Levels A\nand B participants and a > zero > the for Level C partici-\npants in (+Art) group. In other words, the most difficult arti-\ncle for the ELLs in both (-Art) and (+Art) groups to acquire\nwas zero article except for Level C participants in (+Art)\ngroup, who tended to have the most difficulty in learning\narticle the, whereas a was the easiest article for the ELLs in\nboth groups except Level B participants in (-Art) group.\nIn regard to the sequence, differences, and difficulties of\nthe article acquisition by the participants, the following can\nbe concluded based on the results of the study (Table C1,\nAppendix C):\nFirst, zero article was the last one to be acquired and was\nthe most difficult one for L2 learners of all levels; indefinite\narticle a was the first one and the easiest one for L2 learners\nof all levels to acquire.\nSecond, a steady but insignificant growth (4.8 points) has\ndemonstrated for the acquisition of indefinite article a from\nLevel C participants to Level B participants and growth (2.2\npoints) from Level B participants to Level A participants.\nThird, for definite article the, Level B participants demon-\nstrated a growth of 9.8 points from Level C participants, but\nLevel A participants showed a decrease of 1.8 points from\nLevel B participants to Level A participants.\nFourth, for zero article, there was a decrease by six points\nfrom Level C participants to Level B participants but a\nsignificant move up by 14.5 points from Level B participants\nto Level A participants.\nFifth, the results demonstrated that positive correspon-\ndence existed between the growth of the acquisition of indef-\ninite article a and the proficiency level of L2 learners, but no\nregular correspondence had been demonstrated between the\nacquisition of definite article the and zero article.\nFor researchers, educators, and learners in the field, the\nfollowing implications are suggested:\nFirst of all, as aforementioned, the study revealed that the\nmost difficult article for the ELLs in both (-Art and +Art)\ngroups to acquire was zero article, except for Level C partici-\npants in (+Art) group who tended to have the most difficulty in\nlearning article the. In fact, this finding, which is uncommon-\nmonsense belief that ELLs whose L1 contains article systems\n(+Art) acquired English articles faster than ELLs whose L1 did\nwere different, negative transfer would happen (Chen, 2000).\nIn addition, as shown above, a or an was the easiest article\nfor the ELLs in both groups, except Level B participants in\n(-Art) group. What are the underlining reasons for these\ninterlanguage phenomena?\nclaimed the innateness of the SNSD. Does the acquisition of\nthe English articles by English language learners associate\nwith SNSD? If the answer is positive, what is the underlining\nreason for the differences demonstrated in the interlanguage\nproduced by ELLs from various L1 backgrounds with or\nwithout article systems?\ninnate aspect of article acquisition, Chesterman (1991) held\nthat it was not helpful to connect article use too directly to\nnoun class, and hence, to the distinction between count and\nnon-count. Will further study focusing on the article distribu-\ntion on count and non-count nouns by ELLs determine whether\nor not the distinction ever exists in the interlanguage by ELLs?\nIf the answer is positive, how and why does it occur?\nLimitation of the Study\nBecause the number, age, and L1 backgrounds of the partici-\npants in the study were limited, it is necessary to increase the\nscale of the participants in the study with a larger number, more\nvarious age groups, and divers L1 backgrounds before we can\nclaim the universality of the findings demonstrated in the study.\nAppendix A\nSample of Cloze Exercises\na.
