Patients with lupus nephritis,\nallergic purpura nephritis, diabetic nephro-\npathy, nephropathy of amyloidosis, and\nmyeloma nephropathy were excluded.\nPatients were designated as having infectious\ncomplications if there were microbio-\nlogically or clinically documented infections\nconfirmed by infectious disease special-\nists or nephrologists. Microbiologically-\ndocumented infections were defined as signs\nor symptoms of infection with an organism\nthat was isolated by specimen culture (e.g.,\nblood, urine, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid,\nand bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), antigen\ntesting from blood, or histological material\nfrom a definite site of infection. Clinically\ndocumented infections were defined as fever\naccompanied by appropriate clinical find-\nings, such as pulmonary infiltrates or inflam-\nmation of the skin or soft tissue.\nThe severity of infections was classified\naccording to previous studies as severe,\nmoderate, and mild. Severe infections\nincluded severe signs and symptoms, such\nas high fever (>39C), breathing difficulty\nand confusion, unstable vital signs, and\ninfections requiring intravenous antibiotics.\nModerate infections included moderate\nsigns and symptoms, such as moderate\nfever (>38C), cough, yellow sputum, and\ncrackles, stable vital signs, and infections\nrequiring intravenous antibiotics. Mild\ninfections included mild signs and symp-\ntoms, such as mild fever or no fever\n(<38C), sore throat, coughing and stuffy\nnose, stable vital signs, and infection requir-\nThe medical records of these patients\nwere further reviewed and the following\ninformation was obtained: sex, age, renal\npathology, disease duration of NS (the time\nfrom initiation of NS to confirmation of\ninfection), cumulative dose of prednisone\n(5 mg prednisone \u00bc 4 mg methylpredniso-\nlone), and immunosuppressors administered\nprior to infections in the last year, sites of\ninfections, aetiology of infections, labora-\ntory data (when infection was confirmed),\nprophylactic treatments (sulfamethoxazole\nand other antibiotics), and outcomes.\nVariables are described as mean and\nstandard deviation or proportion. ANOVA\nor the 2 test was used to compare differ-\nences among groups. Logistic regression\nanalysis was performed to determine the\nrisk factors for severe infections in patients\nwith PNS. A P value of <0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. All stat-\nistical analyses were performed using SPSS\n17 (IBM, Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nOverall, 138 patients with infections among\nanalysed. There were 45 patients in the\nmild infection group, 60 patients in the\nmoderate infection group, and 33 patients\nin the severe infection group. The most\ncommon site of infections was pulmonary\n(72.4%), followed by the upper respiratory\ntissue (3.6%), gastrointestinal tract (2.1%),\nand central nervous system (1.4%). In the\nsevere infection group, most patients\n(96.9%) had pulmonary infections (Table 1).\nThe causative microorganisms in the 138\npatients with PNS are shown in Table 2.\nIn 51 patients, microorganisms were not\nfound (among them, 15 patients had no\nspecimen to be tested). Among the other\n87 patients, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the\npatients, followed by Gram-negative bacil-\nlus (6.5%), Tubercle bacillus (6.5%), asper-\ngillosis (5.7%), Escherichia coli (5.7%), and\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (5.7%). In the\nsevere infection group, most microorganisms\nwere opportunistic pathogens, including\nPneumocystis carinii (9.0%), Tubercle bacillus\n(9.0%), and Cryptococcus (3.0%). We also\ninvestigated viral infections, such as cyto-\nmegalovirus infection, but no virus was\nisolated in any of the three groups.\nClinical characteristics of infections in\npatients with PNS are shown in Table 3. The\nyears and the female-to-male ratio was\ncumulative prednisone dose was 3.5 \u00c6 5.0 g.\nPatients in the severe infection group had\nthe most cumulative prednisone dose\n(7.1 \u00c6 6.1 g) and this dose was significantly\nhigher than that in the other two groups\nof 34.7% of patients had cyclophosphamide,\nmycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A,\ntacrolimus, or azathioprine therapy.\nPatients in the severe infection group had\nthe highest use of immunosuppressors, and\nthis use was significantly higher than that in\nAll patients had a renal biopsy. The most\ncommon renal pathological types were\nmembranous nephropathy (47.1%), fol-\nlowed by minimal change disease (34.0%),\nIgA nephropathy (10.1%), focal segmental\nglomerulosclerosis (7.9%), and mesangio-\nproliferative glomerulonephritis (0.7%).\nTable 1.

Most previous studies of NS\ncomplicated by infections focussed on chil-\ndren. Ajayan et al.14 found that the inci-\ndence of major infections was 36.6% in\nhospitalized children with NS and the most\ncommon major infection was peritonitis\nTable 2.

In our study, infections were\nfound in 11.4% of patients with PNS in\nhospital, and the most common site of\ninfections was pulmonary (72.4%) and\nthe most common microorganism was\nKlebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%). In the\nsevere infection group, most (96.9%)\npatients had pulmonary infections with\nopportunistic pathogens, including aspergil-\nlosis, nocardiosis, Pneumocystis carinii,\nTubercle bacillus, and Cryptococcus.\nAn interesting finding in our study was\nthat patients in the severe infection group\nhad lower 24-h urine protein and cholesterol\nTable 3.

These\nfindings are not consistent with previous\nstudies. Ogi et al.10 found that hypogamma-\nglobulinaemia and renal insufficiency were\nindependent risk factors for bacterial infec-\ntion in adult patients with NS. Elidrissy\nreported six nephrotic children with perito-\nnitis and two with pneumococcal meningitis.\nAll of these cases had hypoproteinaemia and\nall of those tested had low plasma IgG\nlevels.17 Gulati et al.18 showed that children\nwith NS who developed infectious complica-\ntions had significantly higher serum choles-\nterol levels and lower serum albumin levels\nthan children with NS without infection.\nHowever, in our study, many patients\n(39.1%) were not under corticosteroid ther-\napy, mainly because infection occurred\nbefore steroid use. These patients were all in\nthe mild and moderate infection groups.\nTherefore, after a long time of immunosup-\npressive therapy, the status of NS tends to be\nbetter in patients with severe infection. These\nfindings suggested that hypoproteinaemia\nand hypogammaglobulinaemia were not the\ncause of severe infections in our patients.\nPatients in the severe infection group had\na longer duration of NS, larger cumulative\ndose of prednisone, more immunosuppres-\nsor use, and lower CD4\u00fe cell count.\nGlucocorticoids exert many complex, quali-\ntative, immunosuppressive effects that\ninduce cellular immunodeficiency, and\nincrease host susceptibility to types of\nopportunistic infections. Glucocorticoids\nalso rapidly cause redistribution of lympho-\ncytes from the circulation, depleting circu-\nlating CD4\u00fe T cells, and to a lesser extent,\nCD8\u00fe T cells.19 Different studies have\ndemonstrated that steroid therapy increases\nthe susceptibility for infections because of\nIn the present study, we found two\nimportant risk factors for severe infections\nin patients with PNS. These factors were a\nlarger cumulative dose of prednisone and a\nlower CD4\u00fe cell count. This finding is\nconsistent with previous studies on kidney\ntransplant recipients and those with rheum-\n\u00b4 ndez-Ruiz et al.4\nshowed that monitoring of peripheral blood\nlymphocyte subpopulations effectively iden-\ntified kidney transplant recipients at risk of\nopportunistic infections. Calarota et al.22\nconsidered that determination of T-lympho-\ncyte subsets was a simple and effective\nparameter for identifying heart and kidney\ntransplant recipients at risk of developing\nopportunistic infections. Another study\nshowed that monitoring of T-helper cell\ncounts may be useful for estimating\nthe risk for subsequent infections in\npatients with various chronic inflammatory\nIn conclusion, this study showed that, in\nthe severe infection group, albumin and IgG\nlevels were higher than those in the other\ntwo groups, mainly because the status of\nNS tended to be better with immunosup-\npressive therapy. CD4\u00fe T cells were lower\nin the severe infection group than in the\nother two groups because of immunosup-\npressive effects of glucocorticoids or immu-\nnosuppressors. Therefore, a decline in\nCD4\u00fe T cells could be a risk factor for\npredicting severe infections in adult patients\nwith PNS.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
