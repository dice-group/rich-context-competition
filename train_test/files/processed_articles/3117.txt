    "abstract": "Abstract A poorly devised exit poll question undermined mean-\ningful analysis of voters' concerns in the 2004 presidential election.\nTwenty-two percent of voters picked \"moral values\" from a list of\n\"issues\" describing what mattered most in their vote, more than selected\nany other item. Various commentators have misinterpreted this single\ndata point to conclude that moral values are an ascendant political issue\nand to credit conservative Christian groups with turning George\nW. Bush's popular vote defeat in 2000 into his three million\u00advote margin\nof victory in 2004. We suggest, rather, that while morals and values are\ncritical in informing political judgments, they represent personal charac-\nteristics and ill-defined policy preferences far more than any discrete\npolitical issue. First by conflating morals and values and then by further\nconflating characteristics and issues, the exit poll's \"issues\" list dis-\ntorted our understanding of the 2004 election. In this article, we exam-\nine the flaws in the 2004 National Election Pool exit poll's \"most\nimportant issue\" question and explore the presumed rising electoral\nimportance of moral values and the conservative Christians who over-\nwhelmingly selected this item. Using national exit poll data from 1980\nthrough 2004 and other national surveys, we find that the moral values\nitem on the issues list cannot properly be viewed as a discrete issue or\nset of closely related issues; that its importance to voters has not grown\nover time; and that when controlled for other variables, it ranks low on\nthe issues list in predicting 2004 vote choices. The aggregated exit poll\ndata also show that the voting behavior of conservative Christians is rel-\natively stable over time, and these voters were not primarily responsible\n\"Moral values\" led the list of top issues cited by voters in the 2004 National\nElection Pool (NEP) exit poll, leading to widespread reports that a rise in\nmoral concerns, particularly among conservative Christians, was the driving\nGARY LANGER is the director of polling at ABC News.

This conclusion, the combined result\nof a poorly constructed survey question and incomplete data analysis, is mis-\nplaced.\nVoting behavior depends on a panoply of influences--attitudes and emo-\ntions, issues and attributes alike (Miller and Shanks 1996). Values--and for\nsome voters, morals--are important elements of some such influences. But\nour analysis of the exit poll data shows that \"moral values,\" when controlling\nfor other variables, ranked only as high as fourth of seven competing items in\npredicting vote choices, behind terrorism, the economy, and Iraq and tied with\nhealth care.1 Nor were conservative Christians responsible for Bush's\nimprovement over the 2000 election; neither their share of the electorate nor\ntheir support for Bush increased.2\nThis was not the message delivered by many news outlets in their election\ncoverage. \"Voters who care about moral values delivered the election to Pres-\nident Bush,\" the Washington Times declared in an editorial. It was \"an elec-\ntion that . . . amounted to a referendum on moral values,\" reported USA\nToday. On CNN's Crossfire, cohost Tucker Carlson said, \"Three days after\nthe election, it is clear that it was not the war on terror, but the issue of what\nwe're calling moral values that drove President Bush and other Republicans to\nvictory this week.\"3\nThese and other commentators were led astray by a seemingly simple and\nstraightforward marginal result: Terrorism did not rank first among the issues\npresented to voters on the exit poll questionnaire as \"most important\" in their\nvote. As shown in table 1, 22 percent instead cited moral values; 20 percent,\nthe economy and jobs; and 19 percent, terrorism.4\nThe inclusion of moral values distorted this list (Langer 2004). Compared\nwith the other items, it is not commensurate, comparable, or a discrete political\nissue. Instead it served as an ill-defined grab bag, especially for Bush voters,\nwho, compared with John Kerry's voters, had fewer appealing options among\nthe other items offered and among whom this phrase particularly resonates.5\n1. Moral values tied with health care as the fourth biggest predictor of voting for Bush (in terms\nof predicted probability). See table 9 below. See also Hillygus and Shields (2005) for an evalua-\ntion of vote preference data from an Internet panel.\n3. See appendix A.\n4. The 2004 exit poll was conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool (ABC,\nAP, CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC). The 1996 and 2000 exit polls were conducted by the Voter\nNews Service, a consortium of these same news organizations, absent Fox in 1996. The 1980,\nquestions used in the analysis, see appendix B.\n5. Kerry overwhelmingly won voters who picked four issues--the economy (80 percent to\nBush won voters who picked moral values (80 percent to 18 percent), terrorism (86 to 14 percent),\nand taxes (by a much narrower 57 to 43 percent).\nThe other terms on this list are not entirely precise: \"Health care\" may\ncover subtopics from insurance costs to prescription drug benefits; \"economy/\njobs\" may boil down to interest rates or gasoline prices; and picking \"the war\nin Iraq\" does not tell us, in and of itself, the respondent's position on the war.\nBut these phrases have reasonably specific common meanings in a way that\n\"moral values\" does not.6 A Pew Research Center (2004) survey after the elec-\ntion asked respondents who cited moral values as an important issue in their\nvote what the phrase brought to mind. The open-ended question produced a\nbroad range of responses: Twenty-nine percent said gay marriage; 28 percent,\nabortion; 18 percent, religious belief; 9 percent, honesty or integrity; and\n7 percent, \"other policy issues.\" Six percent cited Kerry as having or lacking\nsuch values; an equal 6 percent cited Bush as having or lacking such values.\nPew produced 17 coded categories in all (multiple answers were accepted),\nincluding 2 percent who cited the media or \"what's on TV.\" The range of\nmeanings underscores the point that moral values are not a discrete political\nissue. We suggest instead that, unlike the other six items on the list, moral val-\nues functions as an amalgam of personal attributes, policy-related predisposi-\ntion, and preference concerning current conditions of immorality (Kinder and\nincluded with such unlike items in a single list question.\nIncluding the word moral (as in \"Moral Majority\") compounded the distor-\ntion, making this not just any misplaced attribute in an issues list but also a\nreligious attribute. Moral is a hot-button word (ill-advised in polling) that res-\nonates with a particular, core Republican group, religious conservatives; its\nuse makes it impossible to differentiate policy attitudes from a recitation of\n6.

In a preelection ABC News poll, likely voters divided by\n51 percent to 41 percent on which candidate best represented their \"values.\"\nIn the exit poll, by contrast, those who selected \"moral\" values favored Bush\nIndeed, the moral values item was overwhelmingly, almost irresistibly,\nappealing to religious conservatives. As shown in table 2, 72 percent of con-\nservative religious evangelical white Christians selected moral values from\nthe seven-item list, as did 61 percent of voters who said that the top attribute\nthey sought in a candidate was \"religious faith,\" 45 percent of conservative\nwhite Protestants or other non-Catholic Christians, 43 percent of weekly\nchurchgoing white Protestants or other Christians, 42 percent of evangelical\nwhite Protestants or other Christians, and 37 percent of conservatives.7 It was\nchosen by far fewer Catholics (17 percent) and those who attend church infre-\nquently if ever (15 percent), the groups that, as we explore below, shifted the\nIn a multivariate model, presented in table 3, attending church weekly, self-\nidentifying as a conservative, and self-identifying as an evangelical Christian\nare the strongest positive predictors of selecting moral values as the top elec-\ntion \"issue.\" Each increases the likelihood of a voter selecting moral values by\nabout 10 percent (being a Democrat has the largest negative impact, lowering\nthe likelihood by 12 percent).\nThe moral values item on the exit poll issues list, then, created its own cen-\nter of gravity. The word religion may just as well have appeared in its place--\ninarguably important to measure but simply not a comparable political issue.\nThe question in effect asked voters: \"What was the most important issue\nin your vote for president--the economy, terrorism, Iraq, health care, taxes,\neducation--or, rather, are you a conservative, religious person?\"\n7. From this point forward, \"other Christians\" refers to other non-Catholic Christians.\nTable 2.

National exit\npolls by the Los Angeles Times included \"moral values\" as an option in 1992\nL.A. Times poll, \"moral values\" was selected by 24 percent; in the 2004 NEP\nexit poll, as noted, by 22 percent.

Again, our argument is not that moral values are irrelevant (see Abramowitz 1995); to the\ncontrary, they are too important to mismeasure (Stoker 1987).\n9. See, e.g., Gallup's \"most important problem\" questions from July 8\u00ad11 and August 8\u00ad11,\n2004. In the July and August Gallup surveys, just 7 percent cited dishonesty, lack of integrity,\nabortion, homosexuality, gay issues, or a decline in ethics, morals, religion, or family as the\ncountry's most important problem (Roper iPoll: USGALLUP.04JULY8.R07, USGALLUP.\nTable 3.

If by topping the list moral values\npointed to this group's true impact, then, perhaps the poorly devised exit\npoll question would not necessarily have distorted election analysis. And in\nfact, political commentary on the election result reached beyond the selec-\ntion of \"moral values\" as the top \"issue\" to a discussion of the voters who\npredominantly selected it. \"The Republicans are in power because the evan-\ngelicals and social conservatives voted them into power,\" the evangelist Pat\nevangelicals used the moral values number not only to proclaim their impact\nbut to demand political payback: \"`Values' voters delivered for the presi-\ndent, and the president must now deliver for them--especially in the\ncourts.\"10 But is the evangelical impact so clear?\nConservative Christians are a core Republican voting bloc (Guth and Green\nrequires that for this group to be responsible for the change in popular vote\nthe electorate and/or supported Bush in disproportionately greater numbers.\nNeither is substantively so.\n10.

Similarly, 34 percent of Bush's 2004 votes came from conservative\n11. We limit this trend analysis to comparable exit poll items.\n12. In the 2004 exit poll, evangelical white Protestants and other Christians correlated highly\nwith each of these groups, e.g., .56 with weekly churchgoing white Protestants and .47 with con-\nservative white Protestants.\nVariable\n% Voting Republican % of the Electorate\nConservative white\nProtestants/other\nConservative white\nWeekly churchgoing white\nWeekly churchgoing\nEvangelical white\nProtestants/other Christians NA 78 NA NA 23 NA\nwhite Protestants and other Christians; in 1980 this group accounted for\nWhile the relative size of these voting blocs has been stable, conservative\nwhite Protestants and other Christians have been increasingly likely to self-\nidentify as Republicans (see table 6).

Frequent church\nattendees did not make up a larger share of the electorate in 2004 than they did\nin 2000; nor, again, was there any significant difference in their likelihood of\nvoting for Bush.

(White Catholics, in particular, have gone with\nwinner. Bush won white Catholics by a 13-point margin in 2004, compared\nwith a seven-point margin in 2000.) But moral values was comparatively less\nimportant to the Catholic vote: As noted, 17 percent of Catholics (and 19 per-\ncent of white Catholics) selected moral values as the most important issue in\ntheir vote, half the number of evangelical white Protestants who did so.14 If\nanything, then, the effect of religion in 2004 was more about Bush's gains\namong infrequent churchgoers and Catholics than his support among the\nevangelical white Protestants who have been the primary focus of postelection\nMomentarily setting aside conceptual problems with the moral values item,\na closer analysis of the data shows that it was far from the \"most important\nissue\" in Bush's electoral victory. A logit analysis predicting Bush votes, pre-\nsented in table 9, shows that moral values ranks much lower than other issues\nin our model. Controlling for partisan self-identification, race, ideology, reli-\ngion, and church attendance, moral values has less predictive power than ter-\nrorism, the economy, and Iraq; it is tied with health care for fourth in terms of\npredictive probability. In the Bush model, moral values has less than half the\npredictive power of the terrorism item.16 (The single biggest predictor of Bush\nvotes, not surprisingly, is self-identifying as a Republican.)\nThese data leave open the question of what moral values actually means,\nbeyond invoking conservatism and religiosity. The Pew results cited above\nsuggest that, albeit only for some respondents, the question may have served\nas a stand-in for two implied but unspecified issues, same-sex marriage and\nabortion. Unfortunately, the NEP exit poll asked the issues list in one version\nof its questionnaire and questions on abortion and same-sex couples on a dif-\nferent version, making cross-tabulation of these variables impossible. (In an\n14. This finding is confirmed by a logit analysis predicting Bush vote that shows that moral val-\nues has a greater estimated effect in predicted probability of voting for Bush among evangelical\nProtestants than it does among Catholics.\n15. These are numerically significant groups: Infrequent churchgoers accounted for 57 percent of\nvoters in the 2004 election, and Catholics accounted for 27 percent, compared with evangelical\nwhite Protestants/other Christians at 23 percent.\n16. This article deals with the direct effects of the most important issues on vote choice, as\nrespondents' choices on that question are strongly correlated with their votes. We also estimated\nmodels with interactions, not shown here, that indicate that while the top issue highlighted in this\nanalysis, terrorism, had a direct effect on respondents' likelihood of voting for Bush regardless of\nreligion, moral values influenced presidential vote choice only for people with particular religious\nbackgrounds, particularly evangelical Protestants.\nABC News/Washington Post poll in April 2005, opposition to abortion and to\nsame-sex marriage, religious conservatism, and the view that elected leaders\nshould rely on their religious beliefs in making policy decisions all related\npositively with one another--with correlations between .23 and .36.)17\nIn the exit poll, 26 percent of voters said both that abortion should be illegal\nin all or most cases and that there should be no recognition of same-sex\nmarriages--roughly equivalent to the 22 percent who selected moral values as\nthe most important \"issue\" in their vote. Bush's support is as highly correlated\nwith opposition to abortion and to same-sex unions (phi = .345; p < .001) as it\nis with the selection of moral values (phi = .311; p < .001).

It is this lack of definition that renders the\nphrase \"moral values\" so inapt as a political \"issue.\"\nThe conflation of political, ideological, and religious views represents a\ncritical aspect of election politics. Measuring and understanding voters' values\nand religious beliefs, and the extent to which these inform vote choices,\ntogether and separately, is crucial to election analysis. Indeed these influences\nare too important to be mismeasured with an ill-defined phrase in an ill-\nconstructed list, as occurred in the 2004 National Election Pool exit poll. The\nTable 10.
