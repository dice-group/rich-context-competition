Pre-,\nintra-, peri- and postoperative clinical data were collected prospectively, including incidence of\npericardial tamponade, cardiac arrest, drainage volume, ventilation assistance time and moderate-\nto-large pericardial effusion.\nResults: In total, 458 patients were included: 230 controls and 228 in the PW group. The incidence\nof pericardial tamponade in the PW group was significantly lower than in controls. Cardiac arrest\noccurred in one patient (0.4%) in the PW group and five (2.2%) controls; this difference was not\nstatistically significant. Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion after drainage extubation and new-\nonset atrial fibrillation were significantly more common in controls than in the PW group. After\nstratification by age ( 70 versus >70 years), there was no between-group difference in duration of\nendotracheal intubation, although in the PW group, after removal of the tracheal cannula, duration\nof noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was significantly longer in older patients.\nConclusions: The pericardial window procedure did not increase the rate or severity of\nprocedure-related complications. This simple technique significantly decreased the incidence of\npostoperative pericardial tamponade and new-onset atrial fibrillation.\n",

Moreover, Pepi et al.3 reported\nthat local effusion (57.8%) was more fre-\nquent than diffuse effusion (42.2%).\nHowever, the traditional pericardial cavity\nand mediastium drainage pathway, with one\nchest tube placed along the right atrium and\nthe other placed retrosternally in the anter-\nior mediastinum, hardly reaches the poster-\nior regions.5 Others8,9 have also experienced\nfailure when attempting to aspirate poster-\nior effusion by percutaneous pericardiocen-\ntesis. Although Georghiou et al.10 and\nMangi et al.11 successfully resolved delayed\nposterior effusion after cardiac surgery by\neither video-assisted pericardial fenestration\nor fluoroscopic guidance, the procedures\nwere arduous and complicated, requiring\ngeneral anaesthesia and single-lung\nventilation.\nAs a result, we have investigated a novel\ndrainage approach, the pericardial window\ntechnique,12 to achieve a free passage\nbetween the limited pericardial cavity and\nthe larger pleural cavity. Theoretically, this\nmanoeuvre facilitates the transmission of\npressure from the pericardial cavity to the\npleural space below. Intrapericardial pres-\nsure increases during intrapleural saline\ninfusion in the same way as intrapleural\npressure. Nevertheless, cardiac output and\naortic blood pressure are better preserved,\npulmonary artery systolic blood pressure is\nhigher, and the degree of pulsus paradoxus\nis lower with intrapleural infusion.13 The\npresent study assessed the efficacy of the\npericardial window technique in preventing\npostoperative tamponade and effusion-\nrelated complications with open heart\nsurgery.\nPatients and methods\nPatient groups and characteristics\nThe present study was undertaken between\npatients (!18 years old) who underwent\ncoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\nand/or valve operation at Zhengzhou\nUniversity People's Hospital and Henan\nProvincial People's Hospital (this is the\nsame institution). Patients' daily function\nand quality of life were classified according\nto the New York Heart Association system.\nPatients were prospectively randomized\nusing a computer-generated randomization\ntable into a control group and a pericardial\nwindow group (PW group). For each\npatient, the randomization result was con-\ncealed in a sealed opaque envelope which\nwas not opened until the patient was put\nunder general anaesthesia. Patients with\nhypertension (systolic level, >140 mmHg,\ndiastolic level >90 mmHg), type 2 diabetes\nmellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease were included in the study. Patients\nwere excluded if they had prior sternotomy\nor cardiac surgery, paroxysmal atrial fibril-\nlation, preoperative coagulant disorders that\ncould have influenced the postoperative\nresults, asthma, and hepatic or renal dys-\nfunction. The Institutional Review Boards\nof Zhengzhou University People's Hospital\nand Henan Provincial People's Hospital\napproved the study, and all patients pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nFor all patients, the following demo-\ngraphic, pre-, intra-, peri- and postoperative\ncharacteristics were recorded: (1) factors\npredisposing to the development of\npostoperative effusion14 such as age, sex,\nbody mass index, hypertension, duration of\ncardiopulmonary bypass and coagulation\nprofile; (2) incidence of postoperative car-\ndiac tamponade, cardiac arrest (excluding\narrests due tocardiogenic factors and elec-\ntrolyte disorders; included arrests were those\ncaused by pericardial tamponade as identi-\nfied at reoperation) and blood transfusion;\n(3) total drainage volume, incidence of peri-\ncardial effusion and volume of effusion\ncollected by thoracentesis or pericardiocen-\ntesis after removal of chest tube; (4) duration\nof mechanical ventilation and noninvasive\npositive pressure ventilation; (5) occurrence\nof new-onset atrial fibrillation and duration\nof intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Some\nparameters (such as mechanical ventilation\ntime and noninvasive positive pressure ven-\ntilation time) were stratified by age 70\nOperative techniques\nDuring the study period, the study centre's\nstandard clinical protocols remained\nunchanged and there was no alteration in\nthe senior surgical or anaesthetic consultant\nstaff.\nCardiac surgery. Prior to anaesthesia, con-\ntinuous electrocardiogram monitoring of\nleads I, II and V5 with automated ST-\nsegment analysis was initiated. The radial\nartery was cannulated under local anaesthe-\nsia to monitor blood pressure directly and to\nsample blood gases. Anaesthesia was\ninduced with intravenous injection of fen-\ntanyl (10 mg/kg), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and\npropofol (2 mg/kg); anaesthesia was main-\ntained with isoflurane 1% in oxygen, entanyl\n(3 mg/kg per h) and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg\nper min). Endotracheal intubation was\nachieved after the intravenous administra-\ntion of pancuronium bromide (0.03 mg/kg\nper h). A triple-lumen central venous\ncatheter was inserted into the internal jugu-\nlar vein to monitor central venous pressure,\nvasoactive drug infusion and blood gas\nlevels.\nAll patients underwent medial sternot-\nomy. The left internal mammary artery was\nthe graft of choice for the left anterior\ndescending coronary artery, and saphenous\nvein grafting was performed for other anas-\ntomoses. In off-pump CABG patients, hep-\narin was given (150 U/kg; activated clotting\ntime !200 s; Tianjin Pharma, Tianjin,\nChina). Proximal anastomosis was per-\nformed with aortic partial clamping; distal\ngrafting was performed using a stabilizer\n(Octopus; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN,\nUSA). In on-pump CABG and/or valve\noperation patients, 300 U/kg heparin was\nused (activated clotting time !480 s; Tianjin\nPharma). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)\nwas established with a roller pump (non-\nmin). Alpha-stat arterial carbon dioxide\ntension management was used, and arterial\nSingle cross-clamp antegrade and retrograde\nblood cardioplegia was used, which was\nrepeated every 20 min before the removal\nof the cross-clamp. Heparin was neutralized\nat the end of the CPB stage by protamine\n(1 mg for every 100 U of initial dose of\nheparin). Cell saver and autologous blood\ntransfusion were performed as required.\nBlood products were not used unless haem-\natocrit was <27%. Extubation was per-\nformed according to blood gas levels\n(inspired O2\nBefore surgery was completed, patient-\ncontrolled postoperative analgesia was\ninitiated via intravenous infusion of 100 ml\nper kg of 20 mg/ml fentanyl citrate and\n16 mg/8 ml ondansetron hydrochloride in\n0.9% normal saline, infused continuously\nat a basic flow rate of 2 ml/h. If the patient\nexperienced pain, a 0.5 ml bolus was given\nvia an automated patient-controlled anal-\ngesia pump.\nPericardial window. Each patient in the PW\ngroup underwent the pericardial window\ntechnique under direct vision (Figure 1).\nFirst, the phrenic nerve was identified and\nan inverse-T incision (2.5 cm long in both\ndimensions) was created. Gauze was used to\nshield the moving (inflating) lung and,\nbefore incision, surgeons identified the phre-\nnic nerve to avoid damaging it. The incision\nwas made into the pleural cavity by non-\ncontinuous electrocautery, parallel and pos-\nterior to the phrenic nerve and extending\nfrom the left inferior pulmonary vein to the\ndiaphragm, as described by Mulay and\ncoworkers.5 As well as protecting the phre-\nnic nerve, adipose tissue around the incision\nwas staunched by electrocautery. Protocols\nwere adjusted in the following conditions:\n(1) if right or bilateral pleurae were inad-\nvertently opened during the sternotomy, a\nright or bilateral pericardial window tech-\nnique was performed; (2) if the patient had\ndense adhesions to the pleurae, the patient\nwas treated by the traditional method.\nA 28 F rubber tube was placed in anterior\nmediastinum and a 28 F silicone tube was\ninserted into the left and/or right pleural\ncavity, through the seventh intercostal space\nat the left midaxillary line. The tubes were\nseparately connected by a waterseal drain-\nage device. If bilateral pleurae were opened,\na second 28 F silicone tube was inserted. To\navoid tube-induced arrhythmia, no drain\nwas placed retrocardially. The tubes were\nsecured to the skin with 4-0 silk sutures and\ncovered with a sterile dressing. After routine\nclosure of the chest, the drains were milked\nand stripped at 30 min intervals to ensure\npatency.\nTraditional drainage. In the control group, a 28\nF rubber drain tube was placed along the\nright atrium in the pericardium and a 32 F\nsilicone tube was placed retrosternally in the\nanterior mediastinum overlying the heart.\nThe tubes were connected using a T-shaped,\nnegative-pressure, drainage device. Tubes\nwere secured, covered and drained as for\nthe PW group.\nChest tube removal. In the PW group, the\nmediastinal drain was routinely removed on\nthe first postoperative day and the pleural\ndrain was maintained until the daily amount\nof drainage was <100 ml. In the control\ngroup, because of the T connection, both\ndrains were maintained until the daily\namount of drainage was <100 ml.\nEffusion measurement and categorization\nAfter removal of the drains, pleural effu-\nsion was measured by echogenicity of 2D-\nechocardiography. Echo procedures were\npostoperation and on the day before\nFigure 1. Position of the inverse-T incision rela-\ntive to the phrenic nerve with the pericardial\nwindow technique.\ndischarge. Patients were kept in the supine\nposition, at an angle of 60 for each meas-\nurement, and all echo procedures were per-\nformed by the same investigator (X.Q.).\nEffusion was categorized by the investigator\n(X.Q.) according to size, as follows: small,\n>80 mm. Similarly, pericardial effusion was\nmeasured by 2D-echocardiography and\ncategorized according to size and site as\nfollows: small, effusion localized in posterior\npericardial cavity, <10 mm; moderate, effu-\nsion involved with anterior wall of right\nventricle, 10\u00ad20 mm; large, circumferential\nOn postoperative days 3 and 5, and\nbefore discharge, 2D-echocardiography\nwas routinely performed to ascertain\nthat there was no recurring effusion in the\npericardial or pleural cavity.\nThoracentesis and pericardiocentesis\nThe indication for thoracentesis was mod-\nerate-to-large pleural effusion. Considering\nthe high risk of pericardiocentesis, the indi-\ncation for pericardiocentesis was strict: (1)\nunder haemodynamic instability, peri-\ncardiocentesis was immediately performed;\n(2) if haemodynamic parameters were\nstable, diuretic therapy was initiated, and\nin cases where this was ineffective,\npericardiocentesis was performed.\nStatistical analyses\nCharacteristics were described as\nmean \u00c6 SD or n (%). Two-sample t-test\nand two-tailed Fisher's exact test were used\nto compare continuous and dichotomous\nvariables between groups, respectively.\nDifferences were considered statistically sig-\nnificant at P < 0.05. Analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS\u00d5 version 13.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nA total of 458 patients were included in this\nstudy: 230 were allocated to the control\ngroup and 228 to the PW group. The\ndemographic, preoperative and intraopera-\ntive characteristics of the two groups are\nsummarized in Table 1. The groups were\nwell matched in terms of factors predispos-\ning to postoperative effusion. There were no\ndeaths attributable to the pericardial\nwindow procedure, and the only complica-\ntion was a bleed from adipose tissue around\nthe cut edges of the pericardium, which was\nidentified after reoperation.\nThe incidence of pericardial tamponade\nwas significantly higher in the control group\nthan in the PW group (Table 2), but the\nbetween-group difference in the incidence of\ncardiac arrest was not statistically signifi-\ncant. There was no difference in the total\nvolume of blood transfusion between the\ngroups.\nA significantly greater total drainage\nvolume was demonstrated in the PW group\ncompared with the control group (Table 2).\nThe number of cases of moderate-to-large\npleural effusion and the volume of pleural\neffusion after removal of the chest tube were\nalso markedly higher in the PW group\n(Table 3). The incidence of moderate-\nto-large pericardial effusion was lower in\nthe PW group (Table 3); at postoperative\nday 10, there was one case of moderate\neffusion in the PW group, in which the\npericardium was diffusely adherent to the\nepicardium by fibrinous adhesions, resulting\nin the occlusion of the window itself.\nPostoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation\nwas significantly lower in the PW group\nthan in the control group (Table 2).\nAn additional analysis was performed\nafter stratification by age (Table 2). In\npatients aged 70 years, there was no sig-\nnificant difference in the duration of mech-\nanical ventilation and noninvasive positive\npressure ventilation between the groups.\nHowever, in patients aged >70 years, dur-\nation of mechanical ventilation was longer\nin the PW group than in the control group.\nFurthermore, in the PW group, after\nremoval of the tracheal cannula, the dur-\nation of noninvasive positive pressure\nventilation was longer. In addition, the\nduration of ICU stay was slightly, but not\nsignificantly, longer.\nIn the PW group, three cases developed\npericardial tamponade with hypotensive,\noliguric and peripheral vasoconstriction,\nTable 1.

One of these cases (with saphenous\nvein graft) was due to dropping of the\nhaemoclip. At urgent bedside reoperation,\nactive bleeding and rapidly accumulating\neffusion were disclosed, and, unexpectedly, a\nlarge blood clot presented a herniation at the\ninverse-T incision. The two other cases of\ntamponade occurred after standard post-\noperative analgesia was stopped: the\npatients experienced dysphoria, hyperten-\nsion (systolic blood pressure >200 mmHg)\nand subsequently showed the clinical fea-\ntures of tamponade. In both patients, trans-\nthoracic echocardiography showed no\nevidence of localized pericardial tamponade,\nexcept for distension of the inferior vena\ncava. Reoperations disclosed discrete bleed-\ning from the right atrial incision and each\nhad a large clot (5 \u00c2 6 cm) that surrounded\nand compressed the right atrium and ven-\ntricle. Surprisingly, the incision still kept\npatency and the posterior pericardial cavity\ndid not show any accumulation of effusion.\nPrompt evacuation of the blood clot led to\nimmediate improvement in haemodynamic\nparameters, in both patients.\nIn the control group, 13 cases encoun-\ntered pericardial tamponade. Two of these\ncases were resolved by thoracentesis instead\nof resternotomy: one patient underwent\nvalve replacement and prolonged CPB; the\nother patient had a preoperative history of\nfrequent chest pain, and tirofiban (0.4 mg/kg\nper min; Yuanda Pharma, Wuhan, China)\nand heparin (10 U/kg per min) were admin-\nistered until sternotomy. Both patients pre-\nsented with loss of blood from the wound\nsurface at the end of operation after surgi-\ncally active bleeding had ceased. After $4\u00ad\n6 h in ICU, the patients presented haemo-\ndynamic instability. Bedside transthoracic\nechocardiography did not reveal pericardial\ntamponade and only indicated a large left\npleural effusion. By thoracentesis, the\npleural effusion showed a projectile feature\nthat implied high intrapleural pressure. A\ntotal of 2.2\u00ad2.5 l of incoagulable blood was\ndrained from each patient, and their clinical\nsigns improved immediately. The other 11\ncases of pericardial tamponade in the con-\ntrol group were resolved by resternotomy.\nDiscussion\nThe pericardial window method was tech-\nnically easy to perform during heart surgery\nand did not increase patient morbidity or the\nnumber of surgical procedures. There were\nno serious complications during surgery\nexcept for one case with bleeding from the\ninverse-T incision. Subsequently, the sur-\ngeons routinely cauterized the incisions and\nchecked for bleeding, and there were no\nfurther cases of bleeding from incisions.\nTherefore, the experience of this study\ncentre is that a T-shaped incision 2.5 cm\nlong in both dimensions is appropriate\nfor the pericardial window method.\nYorganciog\n lu et al.15 reported a protrusion\nof a sequential bypass graft after CABG\nfrom the pericardiotomy side; theoretically,\nthe heart could be squeezed by the pericar-\ndiotomy edges, which would increase the\nrisk of an incisional herniation. Also, a\nlarger incision could lead to the heart\nlosing support from the pericardium and\nmoving within the pericardial cavity.\nOur finding of a significantly greater total\ndrainage volume with the pericardial\nwindow technique compares favourably\nwith the result of Farsak et al.4 The current\nfindings of more cases and greater volume of\npleural effusion, and fewer cases of moder-\nate-to-large pericardial effusion and post-\noperative new-onset atrial fibrillation in the\nPW group, indicate that the pericardial\nwindow technique provides an effective\ndrainage pathway from the pleural cavity.\nWithout the use of this technique, fluid may\ncollect in the pericardium and compress the\nheart.\nOverall, use of the pericardial window\ntechnique resulted in a lower rate of\ntamponade than the traditional drainage\nroute. However, there were still three cases\nof tamponade in the PW group. In the case\nwhere dropping of the haemoclip with\nsaphenous vein graft (leading to active\nbleeding, rapidly accumulating effusion\nand incisional herniation), it is speculated\nthat the rapid formation and collection of\nthe clot before blood could drain from the\npericardial cavity resulted in complete occlu-\nsion of the incision and that, once the clot\nhad occluded the incision, intrapericardial\npressure rose steeply and impaired cardiac\nfilling. For the two cases with discrete\nbleeding from the right atrial incision and\na large clot around the right atrium and\nventricle leading to tamponade, we speculate\nthat the pericardial window technique for\nposterior effusion may be unreliable for\nlocalized, rapidly formed clot masses at\nlocations other than around the right\natrium and ventricle. Transthoracic echo-\ncardiography before reoperation did not\ndisclose the localized pericardial tampon-\nade, possibly because the early effusion with\na low echogenicity gradually became a clot\nwith higher echogenicity, which made it\ndifficult to differentiate it from surrounding\nsoft tissue.\nIn the control group, 13 cases encoun-\ntered pericardial tamponade, two of which\nwere unexpectedly relieved by simple thor-\nacentesis. We speculate that, although these\ncases did not undergo the pericardial\nwindow technique, the accumulated effusion\nin the anterior mediastinum drained into the\npleural cavity through a small undetectable\ngap in the pleural cavity. Transthoracic\nechocardiography did not reveal pericardial\ntamponade in the other cases because of the\neffect of mechanical ventilation on lung\ntissue. With the accumulation of pleural\nfluid, the increasing intrapleural pressure\nwas transmitted to the pericardial space,\nresulting in tamponade-like physiology,\nnamely `extrapericardial tamponade'.16\u00ad19\nVaska et al.13 demonstrated in a canine\nmodel that right ventricular collapse is\nproduced by intrapleural fluid infusion into\nthe pleural space, and that there is a linear\nrelationship between intrapericardial and\nintrapleural pressure. The other cases of\npericardial tamponade were resolved by\nresternotomy because large clots in the\npericardial cavity cannot be resolved by\npericardiocentesis.\nOn the basis of the present study results,\nuse of the pericardial window technique\ndecreased the incidence of tamponade but\ndid not completely prevent its occurrence,\nespecially in patients with active bleeding in\nthe early postoperative period. We consider\nthat the pericardial window technique might\nbe most suitable for patients with coagula-\ntion disorders, because the effusion can be\nimmediately drained into the larger pleural\ncavity, reducing the risk of rapid accumula-\ntion of intrapericardial fluid and a steep rise\nin pressure around the heart.\nThe incidence of moderate-to-large peri-\ncardial effusion in the control group was\nhigher than in the PW group, in the present\nstudy. Fluid accumulating in the pericar-\ndium presents a mechanical stimulus to the\natria, which can trigger arrhythmia,5 and the\ncurrent study observed a decrease in the\nincidence of atrial fibrillation in the PW\ngroup compared with the control group,\nwhich is consistent with that observed by\nFarsak et al.4 Conversely, the current study\ndemonstrated a greater volume recovered by\nthoracentesis in the PW group, which\nimplies that the pericardial window tech-\nnique provides a reliable drainage pathway\nbetween the pericardial and pleural cavities.\nFurthermore, continuous respiratory move-\nment with the pericardial window technique\nremoves fibrinogen from the effusion, which\nresults in uncoagulated blood collecting in\nthe pleural cavity that can be easily drained\nout through the lateral chest tube. This\ncontrasts with the tendency for clots to\nform in the drainage tubes when the trad-\nitional pathway is used. However, at\npostoperative day 10, there was one case of\nmoderate effusion in the PW group, in which\nthe pericardium was diffusely adherent to\nthe epicardium by fibrinous adhesions; this\nresulted in the occlusion of the window\nitself, as described by Sugimoto et al.12\nCompared with those aged 70 years,\npatients aged >70 years in the PW group\nneeded longer ventilation assistance time.\nThe pericardial window technique damages\nthe negative pressure and closed character-\nistics of the pleural cavity and leads to\nalveolar collapse, or even atelectasis.20\nHowever, the significantly lower incidences\nof both pericardial tamponade and atrial\nfibrillation observed in the present study\nsuggest that the advantages of the pericar-\ndial window technique offset its\ndisadvantages.\nOne limitation of the present study is\nthe sample size, which was too small to\nfind significant differences in rates of car-\ndiac arrest between the groups. Pericardial\ntamponade is a rare complication and,\ntherefore, has a low rate of occurrence.\nConsequently, studies with larger sample\nsizes may reveal statistically significant\nfindings in relation to the rate of cardiac\narrest observed with the pericardial\nwindow technique. Another limitation of\nthe present study is that there were no\ninfant cases, so this study could not assess\nthe efficacy of the pericardial window\ntechnique in this patient group. On bal-\nance, in the authors' opinions, the pericar-\ndial window technique may be valuable in\ninfants. Although the pericardial space in\ninfants is smaller than in adults (and\nconsequently pericardial compliance is lim-\nited), the authors of the present study\nwould be in favour of using the pericardial\nwindow technique in infants undergoing\ncomplicated congenital heart surgery and\nprolonged CPB time, which has an adverse\neffect on coagulation function. However,\nthe present study findings do not support\nusing the pericardial window technique in\ninfants requiring simple heart surgery (such\nas atrial or ventricular septum defects).\nIn conclusion, the present study findings\nshow that that the pericardial window\ntechnique is simple, easy to perform and\nwithout serious complications. The tech-\nnique is useful in reducing not only the\nincidence of pericardial tamponade, but\nalso in reducing cases of effusion-related\natrial fibrillation. For patients with marked\neffusion due to coagulation dysfunction,\nthe intraoperative pericardial window tech-\nnique is suggested.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
